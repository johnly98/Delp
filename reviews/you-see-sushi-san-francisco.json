I'll leave this in hopes of helping them to improve. \n\nI typically cal in my order 20 mins prior to picking it up. I  always order the teriyaki chicken bowl extra crispy. I got there and stopped at the counter. The lad said hi then looked behind me and seated them. That kind of through me for a loop cause she didn't say one minute or how can I help. But I'm going to assume she remembered and knew me and knew I ordered to go. \n\nAfter seating them she asked how can I help you? (Confused- safe to say she must have not known). I told her I ordered and gave her my name. I could see my order sitting on the counter behind her. I gave my card to pay and noticed the score card tucked behind the counter (82 ). That made me kinda sad and a little grossed out. She gave my card back and ran out the front door to pop her trunk and let a delivery guy put some things in and stood to talk. I stepped outside and said \"hey my food is right there and I paid, can I just grab it or?\" She runs back in straight to the pick up food counter. The cook says something to her, she run to the seated area took a tray of sushi off someone's table and gave it back to the cook through the window. I lean over again and say \"umm can I get my food please\". She says ohh ohh and run back to the counter and gives me a fork and napkin. I ask for an extra teriyaki sauce (as always). So at this point I have my tray of food, napkin, fork, recipes and extra sauce container and she is kinda rushing like thank you!!! Bye. I say can I please have a bag. She says 10cents. I said you didn't ask me before you ran my card, I don't have cash. She pauses and looks at me, I look at her she looks at me. I say \"forget it I can just carry everything\". And as I'm walking out the door she say here's a bag- no thanks!!\n\nAnd it's again at this point that I realize why they have that 82. Smh. And also realize that as she ran to the trunk and used her hands to open it etc she came right back in and touched that tray of sushi. And tried to put my extra sauce inside my food. I stopped her knowing that her hands touching the sauce weren't clean and stopped her from sitting inside on top of my actual food\n\nDo better guys.

You See is nothing fancy, but it is solid simple Japanese food. The fish is relatively fresh and the rice is soft and seasoned. I highly recommend their reasonable lunch specials--you can get a filling sushi meal for less than $10, which includes miso soup and a few bites of salad. Not bad! Hot green tea is also complimentary. Besides sushi, they also have quite filling bentos (think teriyaki chicken). \n\nAll of my interactions with the service have been pleasant and we haven't had a problem with splitting a bill three ways.

I'm incredibly impressed by what a great time I had eating low cost sushi. \n\nI ordered the Sushi Dinner combo #3, with a tempura roll, a eel and avocado roll, and 4 pieces of Nigiri chosen by the chef (tuna, white tuna, salmon, shrimp). All of this came out to only 12.49, so I was skeptical of the quality. But I was incredibly impressed! The tempura roll was great (shrimp remained crunchy inside the roll), and the avocado and eel roll was exceptional. The eel and avocado didn't have the fishy taste that many poor sushi places get wrong. Definitely not a top tier restaurant quality, but still very good and extremely satisfying. \n\nThe four pieces of Nigiri are quite large, and comes with wasabi applied between the fish and rice (which is how it's supposed to be presented). My friend complained there was too much, but I thought the wasabi was great. The quality of the fish clearly isn't the best in the world, but it still tastes incredible, and it's exactly what I was going for.

However when I Saw Sushi, it did not disappoint P:\n\n[MENU]\n\nTheir menu, especially lunch specials, are very affordable (at med school, this place is referred to as student-friendly, as opposed to resident-friendly and attending-friendly).  The portions are also just enough to leave you satisfied without sinking into food coma.  The prices are a bit higher than Kiki's, but quality is much better--a place where you can eat sushi and actually taste the sashimi, rather than having to order rolls slathered in sauce in order to cover up stale fish.  Variety is also more limited, as you won't be able to satisfy your oyako-don cravings, but they do have a specials menu board posted on the wall.\n\n[LUNCH SPECIAL]\n\nMy favorite is the lunch special #2 with a spicy tuna roll and 4 pieces of nigiri.   It comes with miso soup and a bowl of rice in teriyaki sauce--simple but good.  The tea is served in these vintage mugs with cartoons of sushi, which is actually quite helpful as a quick reference guide in case you forget the Japanese names of fish.\n\n[SERVICE]\n\nAlthough we were off to a bit of a rocky start and had to switch tables after sitting down, overall service is very friendly; you are well taken care of by mama-sans.  They were prompt and attentive, continuously checking up on us to make sure they could take our orders once we were ready.  It was also very nice of them to warn me that some people don't like the mackerel that came with my special, and that I had the option to substitute if I wanted.\n\n[AMBIANCE]\n\nThe ambiance on the inside is quite nice, surpassing what you'd expect from the unpretentious green awning on the outside: clean, simple, comfortable.  It's not a big place, but does not feel cramped.  There's an aesthetic window in the middle of the restaurant, which I at first thought was a mirror illusion but it turned out to be forreals.\n\n[AFTERTHOUGHT]\n\nNote to Cal Bears: I swear, You See Sushi must be a psychological subliminal message, kindling fond memories of CU Sushi. Although the styles are quite different, the consistent quality and convenience make both a go-to student staple.

Its local, palatable and they gave me more rice than usual. \n\nPerhaps the only drawback when ordering a nigiri or a roll is the amount of rice they really give you.

It's a pretty small place so I thought it was strange that she decided to have her dinner there but after seeing the prices on the menu, I understood.\n\nThe scary thing about super cheap prices is worrying about quality. To see cheap prices on sushi is quite enticing regardless. I was still really full from lunch so I only ordered a small order of unagi (eel) sashimi in 3 pieces and a side order of miso soup. Everyone else ordered TONS of sushi.\n\nService was nice but it took them FOREVER to bring our order out. Initially, I figured it was because we had a big group and we ordered a lot but they forgot someone's 2nd order later on. \n\nMy eel was pretty good. The miso soup however, is really strange. It had carrots and cabbage which is something I'm not used to at all. Not bad, just different. I didn't actually like the taste though. I'm not sure what everyone else's thoughts were, but I didn't like it. Cheap though! \n\nMy friend let me sample some of their orders: tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi, uni sashimi, lady in red roll, philly roll, rock n' roll, and some other stuff that I forgot the name of. \n\nThe sashimi is good.

I added a Tako-Maki (Octopus) (6 pieces) for around $2.15? I am not exact on the prices but overall it was cheap.

The joint is pretty popular with the university crowd, especially during lunch, with its more affordable lunch menus.\n\n- The lunch menu contains a variety of items with a wide spectrum of prices. On the cheaper end are a vegetarian bento box ($7) or a chicken teriyaki/California roll bento box ($7). More expensive options are unagi (BBQ eel) over rice ($14) or sashimi lunch special ($16). The prices seem a little funny to me - the cheap items are really great deals, whereas the more expensive lunch specials seem a little overpriced to me, at least by hole-in-the-wall cheap Japanese standards.\n- The service I received here was inexplicably rude. It may have been an English language issue, but I found the workers here unfriendly.\n- I was not impressed with the food. The miso soup tasted like the instant kind. The tempura was oily and soggy (instead of very light and crispy). The chicken teriyaki was dry. The California rolls were fine, though somewhat misshapen.\n\nThe star rating for You See Sushi is difficult to gauge. On the one hand, it's pretty affordable, which is something you can't say about most Japanese restaurants in the city.

They offer simple bento boxes without all the craziness, which can be quite comforting when you want basic Japanese food or sushi.\n\nSure, they start you off with healthy carrot sticks and their miso soup has cabbage instead of seaweed and tofu.  But there's a reason they have been open so long, regulars like us appreciate the slight differences.  I love their huge mugs of tea and I like that their menu rarely changes, nor do the prices.  It's a comforting place.\n\nWhenever I go, I usually stick to the sashimi and some nigiri - hamachi, sake, saba, amaebi, ikura, uni, albacore, etc.  Sometimes I'll throw in a roll to mix it up a bit, but I love my raw fish.  Other friends stick by their Dinner Special which to them means a lot of bang for their buck.  \n\nIt's one of my comfort places...and it's nice when the owners see you and recognize you.

Kept banging my head on it whenever I went to use the restroom.\n- Bathroom sign should be written in English (Bathroom) instead of Japanese (Otearai)\n\n[W] You See, this place is a pretty good spot for bargain sushi that's very tasty as well. You See is conveniently located close to a UC haha... lame joke... anyways we know I'm never going to aspire to be a comedian. Anyways, we always drive past here but never actually tried it until today and we were pleasantly surprised on how good the sushi tasted for its price. \n\n[M] Let's just say we had A LOT of choices to eat for $50 worth whereas if you were at the other sushi spot down a few blocks, you can only get around 4-5 rolls. Bleh~\n\nWe ordered the Tamago Nigiri, California Roll (real crab) Nigiri, Tobiko Nigiri, Uni Nigiri, Rainbow Roll, Futo Maki, 49er Roll, Hawaiian Roll, Philly Roll and Grilled Salmon Teriyaki Roll. \n\n[W] We originally got one order of Tamago, 49er roll, Philly Roll, Rainbow Roll, Tobiko, and the Hawaiian Roll. [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8ed5eduh4zdLGn_y4cCLWA?select=8lqjzL2Dv8vaXA-w3yZUeA]\n] I really enjoyed the Hawaiian roll which had avocado, and scallop topped with Salmon and a thinly sliced lemon. This was a really refreshing sushi roll and delicious as well. All the flavors blended in very nicely. The Tobiko (fish eggs) was really good as well. It tasted fresh and not packaged. I could taste the sweetness of the eggs so that was good. \n\n[M] The Philly roll was my favorite. The cream cheese wasn't overwhelming and it gave a nice separate flavor along with the avocado and salmon. The Rainbow Roll was ok. There wasn't anything extraordinary about it. IT was basically a california roll with salmon, white tuna, and avocado on top. The Uni Nigiri was not the freshest, but for the price of $2.90 you can't it better anywhere else.\n\n[W] Last on our FIRST PLATE (haha yes we had TWO) was the Tamago. That one was a wow. We've tried Tamago at many places and not everyone can make it right. Rather it's just bland or they make it a little thicker to hide their piece that has no flavor BUT this place made it just right. It was sweet and yummy. It was actually so good that I had to order another one haha.\n\nAfter the first plate, we were still hungry so we went for round two. Normally I would just say F-it and leave it as that but this place had such good value that we couldn't pass up trying the other stuff. So on our second plate, we ordered another round of Tamago, Philly Roll again for Mona since she loves that cream cheese, the California Nigiri Roll because the couple next to us ordered it and it looked kind of good, Futomaki, and the Grilled Salmon Teriyaki Roll. [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8ed5eduh4zdLGn_y4cCLWA?select=z-Dkab5w6Z3Kjcik5Ehbsg] Everything was delicious once again other than that California Nigiri Roll. The California Nigiri is one of those things that are better left to be looked at rather than eaten. \n\n[M] They could've used a tad more mayonnaise to give it some more tang in it because it tasted quite dry and flavorless in my opinion.\n\n[W] Other than the food, once again the service is quite slow. I needed more tea (which just basically tasted like hot water) but I could NOT get any of the servers to get some so I had a plan, put my dirty plates on the table next to me and when they come to clean it up, I'll ask them for more tea... and it worked haha. \n\nOverall the food was pretty good but the service was sub-par. The dining room is pretty small so I don't see why they can't attend to all their clients. Our bill at the end came up to be 50 dollars and change. But like I said earlier, it was a GREAT value. A lot of items on the menu were around 3-4 dollars from what I can recall. Most places only give you a couple of rolls for that price including tax and we had a lot of food to try out. I would definitely come back again because of that reason. Parking can be problem here also because it can get pretty busy sometimes but today we got lucky.\n\n[M] P.S.

We were given our soups that came with the lunch dishes and it was very salty miso. I really could only eat the cabbage out of the soup and take a few sips of the soup. Our food came out very scattered from each other. Instead of hot rice and cold sushi, I got cold rice and warm sushi. I did appreciate the generous amount of teriyaki children that came in the lunch bento box and the very spicy wasabi. The avocado in my California Roll was slightly yellow, and the flavor was a little flat for an avocado.

Nothing fancy, but it really doesn't need to be.\n\nFOOD: [****]\n*Miso Soup ($2.30) \nYUM. To me, one of You See Sushi's biggest standouts is actually their miso soup. It can be hard to find miso soup with the perfect balance of robust saltiness and subtle  underlying flavor, but this place nails it. Love the addition soft tofu and tender cabbage. This soup makes miso happy on a cold, foggy, Sunset night.\n\n*Spinach with Sesame ($4.05)\nSimple and delicious. Tender, nutty, sweet, salty, and ever-so-slightly bitter. Cold and refreshing.\n\n*California Maki with Tobiko ($5.70)\nThe classic California roll on steroids! It almost does not have to be said how good simple crab+avocado+rice+seaweed combo is, but I must mention that the addition of ocean-y tobiko (fish roe) on the outside brings this roll to a whole 'nother level.\n\n*Lady in Red Maki ($11.45)\nI seriously need to find out who this lady in red is, because the sure has something good going. Her sushi taste, I mean. The roll consists of spicy tuna, avocado, and green onion wrapped with the usual rice and seaweed and topped generously with tuna sashimi and a drizzle of spicy mayo. Bam! So good!\n\nOverall, this place is exceptional in the realm of weeknight sushi.

With a chef robe, wasabi as my neck, soy sauce (low sodium, of course) dripping from my corner lip, and chopsticks in my left pocket (usually contains a calculator), I trek down memory lane and write about a hidden gem. \n\nAs a sushi addict and founder of SA (sushi anonymous), I craved sushi yet my recent financial advisor would think otherwise.  Not wanting to settle for SPAM on a Friday night, my choice would be a neighborhood joint.\n\nDespite the financial climate, it is still possible to enjoy great sushi at a budget.   Located on a sliding slope in the inner Sunset, the husband-wife team of Paul and Ikuko have been serving vibrant dishes at neighborhood prices.  \n\nOpened since 1991, the restaurant name reflects their main target audience: students and staff from University of California-San Francisco.\n\nLight wooden table, miniature spotlight, and a scenic nature painting all add to a cozy ambiance.  All the times I have dined there, service is attentive in the thirty seat restaurant.  \n\nOnce seated, a cup of carrot sticks are served.  Dressed in a casual attire, the wait staff promptly takes the order.  With my assortment of nigiri and rolls, the food arrives resembles a colorful canvas.  Like a symphony, each sushi carries a special note and tone.\n\nNibbling on a few slices of ginger to refresh my plate, one bite into the buttery hamachi (yellowtail -$2.15) started the meal.  The blushing red maguro (tuna-$2.15) has a great sea-sweet taste.  For a taste of one of the oiliest fish, the saba (mackerel -$2.00) does the trick. Changing to a sweet note, the unagi (eel-$2.15) brushed with tangy sweet teriyaki glaze is worth another order.  \n\nThe uni (sea urchin-$2.90) is my comfort food order.  With a creamy nutty note, uni displays a fresh fishy acquired taste.   With translucent meat, the ameibi (raw shrimp-$2.90) demonstates the goodness of raw seafood.  \n\nA mound of small eggs wrapped in nori creates the tobi (flying fish roe-$2.15). Known as the \"dessert sushi\", the tamago (egg omellete-$1.80) rounded out a great meal.  \n\n-- \n\n**Side bar**\nOpening scene, you're on a date (hot or cold date no matter) who happens to be a food snob, \n\nImpress your dates w/ some sushi notes.\n\nNot only is sushi delicious, but also has many health benefits.  Generally, sushi is low in calories.  Rich fish such as tuna, mackerel, and eel have less than 200 calories per 3.5 oz.  \n\nMackerel and herring are oily fish known to be high in mega-3 fatty acids, which have been known in decreasing the chances of heart disease, stroke, and arthritis.  \n\nAs an excellent source of protein and carbohydrates, rice is not only gluten-free but also suitable for diner with wheat allergies.  Known to help prevent cholesterol deposits from building up in blood vessels, nori (seaweed) contains rich vitamins such as A, B1, B2, B6, niacin and C.  \n\nAiding digestion and rich in vitamin C, wasabi also has antibacterial properties.  Helping the body to fight colds and flu, ginger boost the immune system.  Rice vinegar has been used to preserve food but also lowers the risk of high blood pressure.   \n\n__ \n\nback to review.\n\nServed with fresh crispy seaweed, the make (sushi rolls) are great as well.  Those who enjoy a taste of fusion Japanese food, the 49er, dragon, and tempura rolls are great picks.  \n\nPairing well with the fresh raw fish, the hot sake (regular-$2.75) warmed my palate.  \n\nWhile there are a mile long list of Japanese restaurants in the city, patrons have returned mainly on the price along with quality.", "author": "Rayfil W."}

Now I understand.\n\nThe sushi was great for the price, the udon was not so good and only had like, 8 noodles. I noticed they don't have chicken katsu, which I happen to love. That was also disappointing. Their sushi mug for tea really made up for a lot, though, I have to say. \nWhen I want a big, luscious bowl of fat wormy noodles I will go to Hotei.

It's located right down the block from the UCSF campus so I guess that's why it's named You See. I went there for dinner with a friend. The place isn't too small, not very big either, and the decor isn't much to talk about except the restroom is unmarked, but has a sign next to the door in Japanese that says \"Oterai\" which means restroom.\n\nFor about $13 (tax and tip included) I got chicken teriyaki with rice, soup, salad, and 3 pieces of a California roll, and a Philadelphia roll. The teriyaki chicken isn't like most other places, it's better in my opinion. The sauce is thicker and it's slightly crunchy on the outside which I really liked. The miso soup is different too, instead of tofu and seaweed there's cabbage and carrots which makes the soup more hearty. The Philadelphia roll was the best I've had anywhere.\n\nAlthough the portions were smaller on the entree it was definitely filling. The prices are cheap and the sushi is good.

I've been here before and have quite liked it each time. The place is quiet, food is very good, VERY reasonably priced, service is quick and overall, its a great place to get good, tasty and cheap Japanese food. \n\nI ordered the dinner special with Teriyaki (comes with miso soup) and my friend ordered the California Roll special with eel rolls added. We both got Diet Cokes and desert and the final bill with tip came to $35... not too shabby! And we both were stuffed since the servings were quite big. Tea was nice too.\n\nWe got there at 935PM and they close at 945PM, but the owner was such a sweetheart and seated us and let us take our time ordering and eating. Of course, gentlemen that we both were, we scarfed our food down as fast as we could not wanting them to have to keep the place open any longer than needed. We left satisfied at 1015PM with a warm wave from the owner.\n\nThey also have excellent and quick take out. \n\nToo bad they are located on the odd street of Judah and 6th Avenue. The only other things there are Tikka Masala (indian food... no! really? with a name like that?) and Pomelo (love it!). But other than that, its a dead street. But the 6 Parnassus and 43 Masonic stop right by it, as does the N Judah a block down.\n\nOther than that, its good for eating by yourself, with friends, looks like they can accommodate large groups. So, definitely try them out! They even have a \"Recommended by Yelp\" sticker on their door.", "author": "Amit S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-04-08", "description": "You See Sushi provides average quality sushi at exceptional prices!  I've noticed a growing trend of rising prices among bay area sushi restaurants.  From Koo to Taraval Okazuya to Tokyo Express, I've frequently found myself walking out spending over 60 dollars on dinner for two.  I swear every time we get sushi, it gets more and more expensive.  You See Sushi, on the other hand, offered a nice respite from high priced sushi. Additionally the quality of the sushi was better than expected for the price.\n\nWe called in our order so that we could take it home to eat and watch a movie.  My gf and I love sushi, so we usually order an obscene amount, usually 40 - 50 pieces (most likely the reason sushi dinners are always so expensive for us).  We ended up going with Dragon and Rainbow rolls and various Maki rolls; California, New York, Tokyo, Karaino, Taekka and a few others.  We ordered 7 rolls for the two of us, sounds good!\n\nWe drove over to restaurant and I picked up the Sushi and it was only $32!  7 rolls for $32 dollars!  Wow!  Koo was 4 rolls for $75. So I was already happy with that.  The quality of the sushi was decent, the sashimi on top of the Rainbow roll tasted surprisingly fresh.  The one problem is that the rolls were a little small compared to other sushi restaurants.  We knocked out all 7 rolls with ease; usually we're stuffed to the max with that amount.  The California and Dragon rolls were average, nothing spectacular.  My favorite roll and one I'd definitely recommend is the Grilled Salmon Teriyaki roll with Avocado.  The salmon was cooked well, hot with crispy edges and drizzled with teriyaki sauce.  And it was only 3.95!  \n\nI'm giving You See Sushi 3 stars because the price was there and the taste was decent.  However it was not at the level of other upscale sushi places in the city like Koo and Ebisu.  I'll definitely come back when I want a whole boat load of sushi and don't want to break the bank for it!", "author": "Timothy C."}

We ordered 2 chicken teryaki bento boxes and tempura udon, all arriving at our table within 10 minutes. The chicken teryaki was a tad dry, but was smothered in sauce, I'm not a chicken eater, so I'm assuming its alright.  Iceberg lettuce with carrot and cabbage shreds smothered with too much soy sauce dressing, makes it seem like I'm eating straight sodium instead of a refreshing salad.  Tempura udon was wonderful with the exception of one thing, it came out scalding hot.  I only have so little time to eat it.  Noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was a traditional with a sprinkling of benito flakes.  As a fan of tempura, their tempura is very well done, with a light airy batter and standard dipping sauce on the side.\nWith the little space that they have, probably pack the place with as many seats as the fire marshall will allow them.  That being said, its pretty much like eating in a tuna can.  If you lean back and stretch, you'd probably hit the person behind you.  With the little space in between the tables, everyone hears your conversations. This is not the place if you're going to lunch with 2 talkative Asian woman with marital problems.

Now a days, you will be hard pressed to find someone who is more of a sushi snob than I am (especially for not actually being Japanese).\n\nYou See Sushi (the artist formerly known as We Be Sushi) is a teeny tiny place, w/o a bar, and a handful of tables beneath some tiny and colorful IKEA-style lamps.  We got a sampling of rolls and nigiri.  In fact, we had 4 hand rolls (one of which was a custom made saba-gari roll, which is not on the menu - highly accommodating!), a 49er roll, an eel roll, and some albacore and tai nigiri.  I'll admit, the tai was totally disgusting.  And when I say \"tai\" I don't mean the Japanese snapper either - it's just your run of the mill Red Snapper.  But everything else was pretty decent - fresh even!  The rice was surprisingly pleasant as well (even though there was waaaay too much of it with our nigiri).\n\nWe sat there for a long, long time, sipped our beer, and got very very full.  We were the last people to leave the restaurant having no one to rush or harass us in the least.  And you know what the best part was?  Our total came to $33.

I just discovered this place the other day and went with 6 friends for my birthday. It's my favorite new cheap sushi joint!\n\n5 stars for the quantity and quality of food... now this isn't a 5 star restaurant, obviously. But for cheap sushi in SF, it's a great find. For 7 of us, with at least 5 beers, some sake, and so much food we almost couldn't finish, our total bill was only $100. And their quantity options are great- you can get sashimi in 3, 6, or 9 pieces (and the Toro Maguro sashimi- 3pcs for $3- was to die for!). \n\nThe service is lacking, but I sort of expected that would be the case, so I'm not docking them any stars. You don't go to cheap sushi for the service. They weren't happy that we had so many people coming in at 9pm (they close at the ridiculously early time of 9:45 on weekends!), but we're all good restaurant people and know that sushi is quick, so we felt okay coming in 45 mins before closing. I think they hated us at first, and wouldn't serve us drinks until they sat us (which took about 15 minutes)... but our server got much nicer as the meal wore on, probably because we were nice, undemanding, and she realized it would be a decently large check.\n\nI will definitely be back, although will try to go a little earlier and with fewer people.", "author": "Brandi C."}

Obviously if the money is not an issue, I would go eat at sushi Koo on Irving every day and every meal. But if your budget is tight, you see sushi becomes really appealing especially for such a sushi lover like me. \n\nTo be honest with you, I was a skeptic at first before I even tried out this place. How could good quality sushi be so cheap? But as it turned out, it can.  I LOVE their spicy tuna roll... and have tried a few things on the menu, some of which I like some I don't. If you love spicy stuff like me, I would recommend the dinner #2 and you can ask for a substitution of cucumber roll and Inari if you don't like those things. They charge like 50 cents extra or something cheap if you replace Inari with salmon for example. You can't go wrong with the spicy tuna and their albacore is surprisingly fresh. \n\nI also love how they serve miso soup with cabbage and fresh carrots while you are waiting for your food. I would go there again and again if I live nearby UCSF. For the price they charge, the quality of their sushi is quite top-notched, and for that reason I give this place a 4 stars.", "author": "Mary P."}

It's within walking distance from her work. Their sushi here is cheap but pretty delicious and taste its worth. They give you complimentary tea and miso soup. I say it ain't miso soup if there is no tofu/seaweed. There's has both. Yee. My usual is the chicken teriyaki lunch special. That's what's up and where it should be. I would argue there chicken teriyaki is the best in the city. I will. They grill the chicken and they do this thing with the sauce like they caramalize the teriyaki on top so that when you bite it, it is crunchy. That alone gives it a special flavor and legendary hit. Not to mention their salad is great. Tempura is fried perfectly along with seasoning. \n\nThe waiters are very nice. They remember our faces and pretty much can guess what our order is. \n\nThe place is small and fits about 30, so it's a mad rush since you need to beat the UCSF employees. Wait for food is normal time like 10-15 minutes. Parking is a hassle since it's right near a hospital. Could use UCSF's parking lot and walk. Or just take public transportation since it stops right there. \n\nPrice is cheap and totally worth it. If you don't buy chicken teriyaki when you're there, you will just waste your time.

But their always busy, so i doubt it really affecting them.", "author": "chris l."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-11", "description": "My partner and I love this place.  We've been going at least 2x/month for years, and it's consistently great-tasting, with a friendly & personable owner and staff.  It doesn't try to compete with high-end sushi places and has no fancy airs.  Rather, it's very much a cozy-feeling neighborhood-ish, reasonably priced, locals-pleasing kind of place.  Tourists won't find it unless you bring them there for a funky sushi experience.   I recommend the soft-shell crab roll, or ask what they'd suggest if you want to get creative.", "author": "Cindy R."}
