Laced edibles being distributed throughout the event with about 13 people being transported to the hospital. I heard of hippie hill being \"chill\" and \"relaxing\" and a nice place to go to for 420, but man it was the complete opposite. One man was obviously tripping off of something, and no security was there to help or stop him from harming himself or others. Scary stuff. Also, what made the experience 0/10 for me was the so called \"munchie land\"? There were signs pointing down the hill, so of course my friends and I were drawn to MUNCHIE LAND!? We arrive at the \"munchie land\" and all that was there was a building that sold hotdogs and churros + other unhealthy stuff. Line was incredibly long/slow. So disappointing.

I am one of the drummers playing at hippy hill and for us, we are a community and enjoy playing uplifting rhythms for the entire park. Before I was alive my parents enjoyed listening to the drum circles as well.\n\nTips:\n\n1. There are 10 sunny days in San Francisco and at least 3 of them are warm (so it feels like sometimes.) So it's essentially like a sin to be in doors in San Francisco on such a day. This is when you pick somewhere to go out and hippy hill is a great place: Drums, frisbee, fun for kids, playground, and much more to walk to nearby.\n\n2. If you're a drummer, come join the fun. If you're not, you're welcome to buy one and bring one, or ask to play someone else's, if you have rhythm. :)\n\n3. If you're coming just to check it out, try not to film us or take pictures of us. It really messes up the feeling for us, making us feel like circus art exhibits, and just overall invades privacy.\n\n4. There's plenty of space to practice capoeira, pray frisbee, etc.\n\nI have no idea why I just left a review for a place that has always been, and always will be a super awesome and enjoyable place of community. So for the residents, it's a 5 Star, and for visitors, it can vary, depending on what they're expecting.\n\nI don't do drugs, and many of us don't. The druggies are generally safe and there's nothing to be afraid of.\n\nEnjoy the park! Why is it now a place on google maps? Lol\n\nCheers!", "author": "Marcel S."}

Everything and everybody are happy at Hippie Hill. And, no, not just because they are high.  It's also a park where people bike and play tennis and roller skate, not high.  It's also always sunny on Hippie Hill.  I have had some of my best memories from my teenage years through the end of College.  I have seen some of the best bands, shared ipod earbuds 15 years ago with my best friend listening to Jason Mraz, smoked weed, took a nap with my closest friends out in the sun, had picnics, played tag, ate edibles, taken Mushrooms and explored to always find new things I had never seen before (that may or may not have even been there) on multiple occasions.  I have always had fun and happy times on Hippie Hill.  You are always free to be yourself in San Francisco in general; it isn't like LA in any way, but everyone is welcome on Hippie Hill and people are happy to see you too.

Venice beach, minus the beach and the excessive undercover / beach patrols.. and less people (at times).\n\nOr one of the many high school / early collegiate backyard parties back in the day.. random music blaring, hacky sack, the smell of pungent reefer, 40 oz's, people dancing, loud contagious laughter, drum circles, dogs running around enthusiastically, dealers, out-of-towners, locals, finger foods and so on. It was like a modern flashback to my teenage years.. the demo-graph was that of all walks of life; families, teens, young adults and old timers.. Hippies, punks, tourists, naturists, homeless, rich, and so on.\n\nIt doesn't matter where you enter, once you arrive, it's almost instinct to just plop up hillside and people watch for hours. Non-scripted entertainment directly in front of you. No remote. No tv glares. No volume control and no advertisements. \n\nYou're surrounded by the beautiful outdoors paired with true nature-lovers.. creating a peaceful environment within a larger spectrum. Not only are you neighbored by folks that clearly love their city and lifestyle, but you too are enclosed within natural shades and vibrant greens, browns and blues these Northern Californian parts are home to. Match that with crispy fresh air, the smell of pine (away from pot smoke) and an overtly serene environment.. well, you've got yourself a place that a couch potato, or any adventure seeker / explorer / tourist would be quite envious of. \n\nBe forewarned.. you'll most likely be approached if sitting on the hill. Not in an 'aggressive' manner per say.. but by someone that might simply want to smoke or sell some ganja to you. If it's not your deal, just say 'No Thanks.' People aren't there to rob or hurt you. They know folks are here for a good time and are offering it in the form of smoke. \n\nIt's worth a visit at least once. 90% of the people walking through here a friendly, open, or want to relax and soak it in. Hippie Hill  is an ideal resting spot for a picnic or viewing folks after exploring Golden Gate Park. It's active here!!", "author": "Ryan B."}

It's no longer a place to chill and be a hippie. It's now a hook up spot.\n\nHere's how to find the Hill:\n\nFirst go to Amoeba Music. Then walk down the street toward Golden Gate Park.\n\nWhen you go into the entry to the park there, walk down the pathway until you come to a tunnel/bridge, and walk through the tunnel.\n\nKeep going about a hundred feet until the path veers to the right.\n\nKeep going until you see a peace sign painted on the path that looks like it's been painted over dozens of times.\n\nThe peace sign is directly in front of Hippie Hill.\n\nWell, you're here. Now what?\n\nThis is not a place you go to just hang out and take in the park air. There are plent of other nice places to do that in Golden Gate Park. This hill has a specific purpose.\n\nHippie Hill is one of those places law enforcement ignores. People buy, sell and consume mostly weed and shrooms all day long every day here.\n\nExpect to be asked if you are selling, or want to buy, one of the other of those within the first five minutes of arriving.\n\nHere's the protocol:\n\n1. If you want to buy, make eye contact with someone sitting on the hill. If they're selling they'll say \"buds\" or \"ground squirrel\" or something else weird and obviously not a normal greeting. Ask for what you want.\n\n2. If you want to sell, sit and make eye contact with people who are obviously looking to buy. They're easy to recognize because they're going around asking for what they need.\n\n3. If you're just there to chill out, just say so. But expect to be alone. If you want to smoke, just sit down with any of the gathered groups of people smoking and ask if you can join in. Props if you have some smoke to share.\n\n4. Don't smoke cigarettes. You'll definitely get yelled at.\n\n5. Don't sell or ask to buy anything other than shrooms or weed. This is not the place to buy crack, meth, heroine, etc. People come to the Hill with an expectation that they won't have to deal with that kind of thing and they will be very vocal about it.\n\n6. If you're smoking your own stuff, be ready to share. The Hill is a social smoking spot.\n\n7. Don't call the cops. They'll just take your report and never act on it. They know what people do here.\n\nThat's about all there is to know. Have a great time!", "author": "Nobidy h."}

I remember being the first one out the door and practically running here to enjoy the rest of the afternoon there. This place used to be magical to me....people were friendly, I loved the drum circle, and it was a place you could do things without being harassed by police. I remember this dude would sell us 40s. I made some friends there over the years. From the fellow Jew who sold pipes (waay back in 08) to a man dubbed 'Ocean' who would sing disney songs as he road a long board. \nPark buddies have come and gone, but I still have 3 or  4  people there that I've know for over 5 years. \n\nI don't really come here anymore except on 4/20 or when I'm feeling nostalgic.

Being a bit of a bohemian child myself I was really looking forward to the experience. Idk images from the 60's plagued my mind, I figured I'd find many a people like me there, I even wore one of my many tiedye dresses. To my surprise when I got there I noticed the hippies were missing! I met a few old hippies, the real deal guys, but where were the new generation ones? And was I the only one wearing tie dye??? Instead of 60's and 70s music I found a lot of hip hop and hardcore rap playing in different areas, stuff about \"bitch this and bitch that\"... I felt like I was at the hood and not hippie hill. All the stands were more about selling product or making food than anything else of interests. I guess I was expecting to find art, art of all sorts... I found none. Again, where were all the long haired hippies? :( I did get a few free hugs from complete strangers who were offering them. That was pretty cool. And a few people wanted to take a picture of or with me and my tie dye dress. That was fun. I ran into some cool people. There was a fight that broke out at one point, not too far away from where we were and I noticed everyone pulling out their camera to record it. I was not only disappointed by the lack of hippies, the lack of real music, the lack of art and creativity but also by the amount of garbage left by everyone towards the end of the day... I mean, wow. No true bohemian would ever do that to mother earth. I'm glad to see people looking to recycle some of the garbage and collecting cans, I did my part too, but there was just so much everywhere. Overall the experience was unique, entertaining and one of those bucket lists things to do. But it's no longer what it once was, at least not on 420, if there are any real hippies in the world left, the majority certainly weren't there. I wouldn't go back on 420, but at least I can now say \"Hey, I've been to Hippie Hill in San Francisco on 420.\" If that ever comes up for some reason. Peace.", "author": "Silvermoon R."}

San Francisco, you are a snooty old hippy that has \"made it\" and for this quirky frightening contrast I  love you.\n\nAny odd, Hippie Hill is a fun place to visit, if for no other reason than it's unique character. You will be offered drugs, there will be the namesake hippies. Expect a drum circle and dogs running about.\n\nNot a bad place at all, in my opinion. Yes, the gutter punk kids are a little bit of a nuisance, but that's the city.", "author": "Wes T."}

Trust me, there is a difference between the two.  For me, Dolores is one of the places to see and be seen, loud, happening, like a big outdoor party.  Dont get me wrong, it has good qualities that sometimes i like.  But overall, im more of a peaceful, serene, let my hair down and veg out in my own bubble type.  To some these are just parks - a place to sit out under the sun, maybe meet a whole group of your friends, or hopeful of meeting new people.  No...no...and yeah, no.  Its so much much more than that.\n\nMe, ive been a GGP baby since the womb.  Ive been running a muck in this park  for yearsss and till this day i will still wander into new territory....new secret hideaways.....new sanctuaries.  \n\nHippie Hill is the place where every color, every gender, every walk of life come into one setting and just....be.  Lay out on the grass, listen to the beats, people watch, enjoy a cold one, maybe even get a little contact high from the breeze.   Whatever you're doing on this amazing piece of lawn with all the amazing diversity surrounding you, you're no doubt relaxed.  My conversation with Jessica T. sums it up - this place is food for the soul.  And this is just one part of the park.  Do you have any idea how many other parts are just wonderful?  Oh it just gets better.  Whether you're enjoying it alone or with someone.....it makes your insides smile, your stress disappear, and your heart skip beats.", "author": "Juv C."}

There are a lot of different elements going on simultaneously. You can keep to yourself all you want or be outwardly social. You can keep it cool or get into a whole lot of trouble. You can get drunk and stoned and whatever else or stay sober. You can go when it's sunny or overcast (although sunny is better). And you can probably catch a scathing case of some kind of parasite walking around barefoot, but if that's your thing, plenty do it. I've seen some of the craziest people in my life there. I've also met some really good, down to earth people.\n\nI really only go for the drum circle. There's something mesmerizing and transcending about it. When I first moved to the city, I felt nervous edging into that circle and borrowing a drum. Now I come, get right in there with my OWN instruments and forget about everything but the rhythm. The rhythm of what is up to you. But, listen. It doesn't bode well to jump in there playing some rhythm from left field.\n\nTo me it's a very unique cultural experience - something that has blossomed out of this American society because of and for many reasons. It's also taught me a lot - that we're all playing a different beat, with a different instrument, yet it all comes together, because...well, that's what we do.\n\nIn African dance, traditionally the men drum and the women dance. There are established rhythms and dances. However Hippie Hill is all free-form and improv - in fact it's encouraged - but there is still an element of that drum and dance thing. The similarities and the idea that something like this has risen up in this culture really blows me away.", "author": "Adam L."}

Shit, I just used a WLOAT (whole lot of abbreviations there), anyways the point is that they wanted to do the whole Haight St. / Hippie Hill afternoon, which I said okay to, even though in my heart of hearts I don't like going to Haight Street whatsoever at all, unless I need new kicks or a beehive wig or nag champa and overpriced hipster clothes or whatnot, and even then its still more of a 'chore.'  No offense to anyone, but the massive onslaught of lazy, drugged out and weirdo nobodies from my generation makes me sad and very tired for some reason.  \n\nThis said, my friends and I make it out to the hill.  We are offered meth, chocolate shrooms and weed immediately.  We just say 'no' and plop down on the hill, overlooking the gathering of hippies randomly drumming, dancing, doing capoiera, drinking and getting high. To my right is a small group of squatter punks with a dog. They are on the grass in the sun and sleeping atop each other. I have a great view of one punk's back as his shirt and dirty hoodie are hitched up around his shoulders. There are gross pusslike lesions all up on his back and get this, the dog starts licking them. Why yes, I said the dog was LICKING THEM!!!\n\nUm, yeah...\n\nFast forward to yesterday...\n\nI'm with a group of 'local' friends who wanna picnic on hippie hill.  I try to dissuade them from their location of choice with the above anecdotal story, but they are set on going there. Fine. Whatever. I warn them to use 'protection' in the form of a blanket as obviously you can have NO CLUE whatsoever about what the hell you are sitting on and if I am going to get herpes or random spontaneous sores popping up on my body it will sure as hell be through having some shady ass sex and not from a patch of grass on hippie hill. Hot damn! So... we sit down on a blanket and picnic it up. Wouldn't you know it, some hobo comes directly up to me, yes ME, not them, but ME (is it the 'I heart druggie weirdos' tattoo on my face? yup, it must be) and starts going on about all the drugs he's done, blah blah... THEN, he for no reason at all, asks me if I wanna see the cut on his mouth and proceeds to spread his mouth open with his chubby little dirt encrusted fingers for me and moves very  very close to my face. My, what beautiful sores you have! I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do? Thank god it suddenly got cold and my friends wanted to leave right then and there.

Thats right, tobacco on Hippie Hill, it happens.\nMet a lovely lady with a black eye and lip ring who started chatting us up, and another who offered to load the hooka with something more fun.  Whats more fun than mint flavored tobacco?  Nothing....but needless to say, everyone we met was very nice.  \nI would recommend not necessarily bringing children to this part of the park to hang out, only because when they get older and they have flashbacks to this strange odor, you dont have to explain to them that you once brought them to the coolest hill in GG park.", "author": "Lauren F."}

They will probably be safe, but do you want them being exposed to an ideology of \"rebellion\" centered on coercion and self destruction? The atmosphere for many of Hippy HiIl's residents is more appropriate for the Tenderloin. Remove the grass and the illusion of \"free spirit\", and what do you have?
