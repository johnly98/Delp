They served me my tea in a wine glass which was super cute. I came here today to do work and I can confirm that it's a good spot to work as the tables are large and the WiFi is fast.\n\nThey are a bit different than other coffee shops because they also serve beer and other drinks so people come in the evening to drink and hang out until they close at 9.", "author": "Sydney G."}

When you go to Orson's, you don't just get great food, coffee, wine, and beer; you also get the friendliest, happiest owners that know and care about their customers and will welcome you by name, and a great crowd of locals and visitors alike. \n\nOrson's Belly truly is the \"family room\" of the neighborhood. Come here for good vibes, delicious eats and a welcoming environment. It's a great place to do work, hang out with friends, and meet new people. For my friends and I that live in the neighborhood, Orson's basically feels like an extension of our own home! I even created a Yelp account just to give this place a good review.

Plenty of seating and wall outlets, very solid cappuccino, and an awesome list of small plates that are beautifully plated and great for sharing and snacking. \n\nThe olives are actually incredible. They bathe in oil and Italian herbs, which gives then this lovely sweetness to balance out the saltiness. Seriously you might resist chewing them they're so good just to let rest on the tongue. A surprisingly crisp exterior and juicy interior that will have you craving more. The hummus was also great, not my absolute favorite but the pita is fluffy and its ideal for sharing.", "author": "Jason S."}

There is also a silent film that gets projected on one wall, so there's always something interesting to look at.\n\nA lot of their food is homemade, like the museli and the muhamarra. They are worth the price, so definitely try them both! The museli is technically on their breakfast menu, but the owners are super accommodating and let us order it at 6 PM. According to the owner, the most popular item is the belgian waffle, which I plan to try next time.\n\nLots of natural lighting and a low buzz of conversation make for all around good vibes.

When she starts to scream at you, saying you're not entitled to any service after you quietly ask her about how the order of drinks is made, then you know there's some shit going on.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWalking in on a Sunday morning at 11 AM, the first thing I hear waiting in line is another customer asking for a refund of their $4 back.\n\nOk sure, maybe he just ordered something complicated. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here. An older gentleman walks in and puts his bag and jacket down right where I was about to sit before he gets in line after me to put his order in.\n\nI sigh and wonder why can't people order first and then go to their seat.\n\nI find another seat after I order and two other people walk in after me to place their order.\n\nI wait for about 15 minutes and the people that were in front of me get their drinks and they walk out.\n\nAnother 15 minutes later, one of the owners brings a coffee drink to the old gentlemen that came in after me. After another 5-10 minutes, the two people that ordered after me get their drinks. A sparkly orange drink in a wine glass and a latte.\n\nI go up to ask if my drink has been made and maybe I just didn't see it yet.\n\n\"Hi, any update on the black coffee?\"\n\n\"I haven't forgotten about it. It's right here.\" she says and points at a half-filled mug. She cuts me off before I even finish saying that.\n\nI sit back down and watch as two other people get their drinks personally delivered to them.\n\nMy drink is finally ready and she motions for me to come up and get it at the counter.\n\nI ask, \"I have a question.\"\n\nShe cuts me off once again saying, \"Yes it's half decaf.\"\n\n\"Not what I was going ask. I'm wondering why the order of your drinks being made seem to be off. I ordered my drink before these 3 and somehow got my drink last.\"\n\nAt this, she threw her hands in the air, and shouts, \"Do you have a problem!?\"\n\nWell, I didn't. But it seems now we do.\n\nBy now, the entire cafe is staring in our direction.\n\n\"A house coffee is simple drink. If you have a problem with making my drink for some reason and decided to bump it down on the priority, then I'd like to know why.\"\n\nAt this, she took the coffee back and threw it in the sink, causing a bunch of clanging from the dishes.\n\n\"Take your refund and go!\"\n\nI gladly obliged. The other owner, presumably the woman's husband handed me the amount in cash.\n\n\"Take your friend and get out of here! You think I'm obligated to serve you on time on a Sunday brunch hour?!\"\n\nNo, but I expect my order to come before those who entered after me, especially if it's a simple drink.\n\n\"No wifi!\"\n\nOkay...\n\nIs that what's at the top of your mind? The fact that you think I'm here to stay so you delay my order for half an hour for a black coffee? Or was it that you expected me to stay quiet and not confront you on your bullshit?\n\nNo thanks. This place ought to be called Orson's Bullshit. This was my first and last time here.\n\nHire some people if you're stressed out and can't do shit for your customers.

I noticed that she was struggling, making coffees and taking orders at the same time. So, to kill time I washed my hands in their restroom, sat down, looked at some books on their shelves, went outside and back inside while I was waiting. Meanwhile, so many other customers were in & out the door with their drinks (AND THEY CAME IN 10-15 MINUTES AFTER ME) and I'm still there waiting....and....waiting. \n\nFinally, she called \"1 cappuccino\", and put 1 cappuccino on the counter, then she started taking orders from people that just came in.  Wait, how about the other cappuccino that I ordered? At that point I was already waiting for more than 15 minutes to get one of my cappuccinos and didn't want to wait another. 5 minutes later of waiting, I asked her if I could get $4.00(cost of 1 cappuccino) back since she hadn't started making the 2nd cappuccino AT ALL. I just wanted to get my day going, not be there for 30 minutes. Her response with an attitude was \"EXCUSE ME?\" She annoyingly asked the arriving customers that just came in that \"If You don't mind to wait for him? I've got to make his order\". \n\nI wasn't rude back. I even could forget the whole thing if she'd just not had such a bad attitude. \n\nSo if you wanna wait a half hour for a pretty good cappuccino then Orson's Belly is your spot.

About the environment, Orson's Belly is like a perfect combination of informal reading place, (the place have books available to anyone, wi-fi and films being projected on the wall, vintage posters of Orson's Welles, and fancy chandeliers) with a great coffee house. What someone can desire more? I strongly recommend Orson's Belly, you will not be disappointed.", "author": "Rubim B."}

Even with the location, it's quite a gem of the neighborhood weigh its unique ambience with heavy influences of Orson Welles. If you are in the area, I'm sure you've seen a chalkboard sign of their Turkish coffee, which is \"black as hell, strong as death, sweet as love\".\n\nThis review would be my second go-around with Orson's Belly, with the first time trying the Turkish coffee to go. Comes with a piece of Turkish delight, by the way. \n\nRound two, I decided to stay and have a little breakfast. The menu updated from the pictures I saw prior to dining in and they have quite a list to skim through. This isn't you fast food, $6 meal type joint, so prepare yourself for $9+ items. \n\nI went for the muesli, not something I usually eat on a regular basis and it's vegan, definitely not my typical choice. Now I'm not vegan and likely won't plan to be vegan (apologies to any vegan), but for a vegan breakfast, the muesli really isn't all that bad. The agave syrup drizzle was the thing that made out delicious and pulled the while dish together. It's served cold, yet it is surprisingly filling. Pair that with Turkish coffee, slightly sweeten this time, and it isn't a bad breakfast! Pricey, but not bad! Oh, let's not forget that Turkish delight! Rose flavored too!\n\nIf you have the time in the morning, Orson's Belly is a quiet little caf\u00e9 with plenty of books inside to get lost in. The price might be a little steep, but a great place to splurge a little and enjoy some warm company the staff gives.", "author": "Jeremy L."}

The owners are awesome and some of the friendliest people I know. The coffee, available as espresso, pour over, or Turkish, is consistently excellent. The food is light but delicious. The space is small but quaintly decorated with classic movie posters, books, and art. They often play jazz, and have an old movie playing silently on the wall. There's a table on the sidewalk if you prefer sitting outside (being off the main streets in the Richmond, it's usually pretty calm), and the wifi makes this a popular study spot. \n\nThey periodically host lectures on different directors, as well as the occasional workshop.", "author": "Zach K."}

First, they serve wine in a recycled jam jar for $10, it gave the impression of drinking wine from a box with a gold ribbon price.  Secondly, they try too hard overly friendly at times annoying, especially when saying her name incorrectly.  She continues to overly correct you but in turn she is butchering your name.  \n\nI've not tried the food as the menu was unappealing.  The interior was greatly done but missed the spot in the representation of film memorabilia.  The wall featuring the film is as poorly visible the lighting from the windows washes out the image.  \nWhat I was most excited about was it being a dog friendly place so that was a 5 star and a big deal to me!  Unfortunately, it was short lived as there was another patron who owns two dog aggressive Shih Tzu mixed. They go ballistic seeing another dog entering and start gunning toward you. I've conveyed to the female behind the counter, dogs who behave such a way should not be allowed in establishment as I've gotten bitten from the exact situation.

The quiche took 25 minutes and the sandwich 30. Someone who arrived 15 minutes later got there to go food before I got mine. I was so hungry when the quiche came out, I didn't investigate the inside and burned my mouth. While I was sitting at the bar another patron came up to remind them about the food he ordered that they had clearly forgotten about . Your caf\u00e9 is really cute and it's much needed in that neighborhood, but you need to get your sh*t together.\"\n\nResponse:\n\"Sorry, we cannot take responsibility if you burn your mouth on the food. \nIf you want a place with their \"sh*t\" together go to Peets.

I got a \"farro salad\" that isn't on their online menu (http://www.orsonsbelly.com/food.html), so maybe they don't make it any more.  It was pretty good, and plenty large, but took a long time to make.  We got it 10-15 minutes after the other meals in our party, around the time they were finishing.  I wish they would have told us that it would take 20-30 minutes to make (and we were practically the only people in there!).  If I knew it would take so long, I would have ordered the apple pie.   The coffee was good.  There was an interesting french movie playing on the projector.  The place is clean and bright, and the staff was friendly.   Too bad our (well, my) food didn't arrive faster.  Even so, it's likely I'll go back next time I'm visiting Richmond.", "author": "David L."}

Loved the muesli - got it without agave and it was definitely sweet enough, though they gave it to me on the side in case I wanted it. My friends loved their smoked salmon bagel sandwiches. The only weird thing was it came with a side of grapes and they were unwashed (visible dirt).", "author": "Nina S."}

We made our first trip there today and ordered the vegetarian Cobb and chickpea salads and a large chocolate chip with oatmeal cookie. All 3 items were delicious, more than ample in size, and food I would order again. The owners are very enthusiastic and friendly and I'm sure will appreciate any suggestions people have to make.", "author": "Terry H."}

Coffee and berry tartlet were excellent.  Staff were very nice.  I love that it's open so early on the weekends.  Kid and dog friendly, as evidenced by the water bowls and chalk outside.  I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Nicole S."}

We loved the movie theme which gives the cafe a unique touch. The food was scrumptious- ordered the salmon bagel which came with a large side salad. The owners are lovely people who greeted everyone with a smile :) will definitely be coming back!!", "author": "Eda A."}
