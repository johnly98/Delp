It wasn't too packed but there was only a small walk space between the wall and the bar stools which made it hard to get in and order a drink. Even with just about 20 people at the bar. I've read a lot of reviews about the bouncers being racist against people of color. Well I was by myself and the bouncer was very sweet. Not to mention that he was a man of color himself. Take what people say on Yelp with a grain of salt. I was coming from out of town and wanted to just check it out and get some pictures. I have never been in a bar quite like this before.

Lot's of Porn.  \n\nRight in the friendly confines of The PolkNob, where so many of the bars have gentrified, you have this unapologeticly not gentrified spot.

Worry not, that's not what we're talking about here.  \n\nThere is an air of debauchery here.  Kozy Kar is a really fun spot, and as the night goes on, it gets to be quite a den of iniquity - you know, in a good way.  One second, the TV's in the bar are playing cheesy 70's music videos, the next, they cut to 10-15 seconds of porn.  And then there's the Waterbeds.  You can use your imagination, but as another Yelper pointed out, you may want to dip yourself in hand sanitizer after visiting the one in back with the booth.  Again, in a good way... I guess.  Of course, all of this is done in the context of a dive-bar in one of the nicer neighborhoods in SF.  \n\nBar-wise, I think the service is always terrific.  Cool bartenders, too.  There is no draft beer, but they make up for that by having Olympia in cans.  I haven't had mixed drinks here, but I've heard from fellow imbibers that the drinks are stiff.  (No allusion to the Porn intended)  And, they crowd is the typical Polk Street set.  Depending on the time, it can be quiet - but it usually gets jumping after midnight.

Hilarious and entertaining! \n\nThe bartender, I believe his name was Benny, was so great. One of the best bartenders I've encountered in SF so far. He told us he was from Tampa so we kind of bonded talking crap about FL haha! I had a few drinks here and the prices weren't so bad. Definitely cheaper than drinking in Miami, that's for sure. They accept credit cards here too, if that's important to you.\n\nWhen we closed our tabs, we told Benny we though he was a great bartender. We went to hang out on the waterbed by the entrance while finishing our last drinks and Benny came over and handed the 3 of us a free shot for saying we liked him. That was really cool of him to do!

If you like bars, and you like porn, this is for you.  The entire joint is purposefully tacky, adorned with pornographic images circa 1980.  This sticky spot isn't somewhere that I'd go to leisurely grab a drink on a Friday night, but it's a great place to take visitors and first-timers solely to experience their reaction.  Everything feels and looks dirty and germ-y, so it's best to go late night after you're already liquored up and your inhibitions are low.", "author": "Kristen F."}

Portland hipsers would piss their super-tight peg-leg purple pants over this place. \n\nA bar modeled after a badd-ass 1970's Dodge Van? Oh yeah. Think metallic orange and green puffy vinyl walls, a water-bed up front (and I believe another in back), light fixtures made from chain-link steering wheels and hubcaps, various accoutrements like van grills and ladders on the walls, and from what I hear, an actual dodge van in the back. Oh, and a giant acrylic bong on the wall (for decoration purposes). Combine this with some badass tropical sunset wallpaper and friendly staff, and what do you get? Well, something that's totally Rawesome. (Rawesome = Rad + Awesome) in concept, and pretty damn kool in execution. \n\nThe bar itself serves a mix of bottom-shelf booze, Ameican macro-brews, and box wine (to add to that 1970's drinkin'-in-the-van chic). This is cool and all, but it's also the one factor that would keep me from coming back over and over again. Call me pretentious if you will, but there's a reason they call that stuff \"rot-gut\" booze. Cheap ingredients do a body bad. I've done my time in the trenches with Olympia, and while I'll still drink it on a lark, I wouldn't find myself angling for it every day. \n\nThis is definitely a place to stop in, check out the scene, and have a campy good time. The decor alone is so tubular it makes me want to stay, but the lack of anything meaningful above bottom-shelf would drive me to drink... elsewhere, on a regular basis. \n\nThat said, Kozy Kar has it's appeal, and deserves 4-stars for such a gnarly idea.", "author": "Don B."}

DO NOT frequent this locale.\n\nI had the unfortunate idea of taking my friends to Kozy Kar because it was a place on Polk I hadn't been to before.  It was a HUGE MISTAKE.  \n\nMy friends and I ordered drinks and I sat on an empty seat at the bar.  I was sitting there for at least half an hour when two girls (one with frizzy blonde hair and her friend) come back and say they want to sit there.  I just thought it was weird because who comes and asks to take your seat at a bar???  Anyway, they could have sat next to me on the seat-bench but they chose not to.  \n\nSo, they complained to some bartender (said his name was \"Mattie\" - red shirt - tattooed arm) that liked them and then about fifteen minutes later he comes to my friend and I and VERBALLY ABUSES at us.  So this tyrant screams at us and says:  When some of my customers that I serve want their seats you need to get  F!$#$%$ off the seats and give them to them.  You can finish up your F*^*&^ drinks and leave this F$#$*# bar!!!!!!!!!!  \n\nWe were like what?  We've been at this spot for about an hour now - what's your problem?  Can I speak to the manager?  \n\nNO!!! YOU CAN FiNISH UP YOUR DRINKS AND GET THE F#$#$! OUT OF THE BAR!!  \n\nSo then my friend and I comment to each other maybe he's racist because we're Asian.  He then hears us and is like \"No, I'm half-black.  You're the racist!\"  \n-Ok weirdo, you can still be racist no matter what race you are.  \n\nNeedless to say, I was and still am shocked, appalled, and disgusted.  My friend tried to close out the tab and I tried to tell some guy that said he was the owner.  But the owner guy didn't really seem to care that much - all he said was that he would talk to that guy.  Big deal - I didn't really even get an apology.  \n\nNever going back there.  I knew it was a shady dive bar, but this place is even worst - it's the embodiment of TRASH with a capital T.", "author": "F K."}

But she and some other people were gonna check out Kozy Kar last Friday and she was kind enough to invite me.   Now I'm a complete sucker for 70s nostalgia and Megan always struck me as a funny, cool person, so naturally I accepted.  One time we got in to a heated argument about a burnt cat with broken legs, but that apparently was beer under the bridge at this point.  \n\nI got held up at work and didn't get until 11, at which time there was a line of a dozen people and it was packed inside.  That's to be expected , but after getting inside after a quick 5 minute wait, I realized it would have better to just keep me waiting.  Place was packed, and considering the entry way is about 4' wide, that was not a good thing.  We're talking like shoulder to shoulder, no room to breathe.  Additionally, I was carrying a backpack with my gym stuff in it.  Pretty much a recipe for being bounced around like a fat kid on his first day of jr. high.  I looked for a korner (haha) to set it down at, but was seeing nothing.  \n\nWhen I finally got up the bar, it was a weird scene.  All the seats were taken, but nobody was talking.  They seemed to be kind of mesmerized, although I'm not sure by what.  Maybe they'd never seen pictures of boobies before, who knows.  I'd planned to just have a couple beers since I had a fitness test the next morning, and this really confused me because there were no taps there.  I asked what beer they had, and the reply was \"Olympia, PBR, and Schlitz\".  I was about to say \"...and?\", but then realized that truly was it.  Yep.  3 beers.  Served in a lovely 12 oz can.  \n\nNow the funny thing is I'm from Wisconsin and lived in Seattle for 5 years, so I know these beers quite well.  PBR makes my head hurt, Olympia is really watery with little taste, and Schlitz is the butt of all Wisconsin beer jokes.  I can see what they were going for with the theme, but there's a reason the latter two went out of business.  Call me crazy, but if the owner wants to offer \"beers that sell\", why not throw in High Life or MGD?  Those are my two fallbacks when nothing better is available, but really my point is I don't see how you can call yourself a 70s themed bar without draft beer of any kind.  This was a huge head-scratcher.  \n\nI decided to just pass on the drink and spent a couple more minutes looking for my crew, but realized it just wasn't gonna happen, and decided to bounce.  I felt kinda jipped for not even seeing the decor they've put so much effort in to, but this bar has only been open a few weeks and this type of crowd on a Friday night was not shocking.  My plan was to come back on a weeknight when things were less harry and hopefully after they had some more offerings in the beer department, but based on the owner's comments here, it doesn't appear he's very open to suggestions for improvement.  \n\nI understand starting a business involves tons of effort, frustration, and risk since I'm doing it myself, but it also requires discipline and self-control.  His latest comments here are borderline psychotic.  There are several successful bars in town that people love to rant about (Zeitgeist, Alembic, etc) both on Yelp and other sources, but those businesses don't feel the need to belittle their critics in order to make a point.   They have their silly rules, and you either accept them or decide not to go.  I'd expect a person who's supposedly had 18 years in the business and claims to have so much success to understand that, so my only conclusion is that this is his way of guerrilla marketing.

There are only three booths (and maybe a few tables?), and they don't seat that many. My party was able to nab a table early, and people hovered over us the whole night. \"Are you leaving?\" \"When are you guys planning to leave?\"\n\nThe bar is right by the entrance and has four or five really wide cushioned seats... Comfortable if you're able to nab one. If not, be prepared to order your drink over someone's shoulder or squeezed between one of the bar seats. (If you're ever able to order a drink.) It seems like stools would have made a lot more sense, space-wise.\n\nTrying to get by is an ass ache, as they placed drink counters opposite the bar. So if you want to get to the back of the bar, you're competing with people trying to order drinks on one side, and people maintaining conversations with their friends on the other. I know that bars often have this kind of layout, but it sucks for places that are as tiny as this. (I think there are some Yelp photos that can give you a pretty clear idea of what this looks like).\n\nAs others have mentioned, the bathroom stalls are separated by curtains rather than actual cubicles. When my friend told me the set up they had, I feared the worst. But I must have been pretty drunk, because it ended up not being so bad. That may also be why I didn't notice the reflective floors everyone else mentioned.\n\nThere's a waterbed right by two of the booths. At the time I thought it was a pretty cool feature, but thinking back, it probably would have made more sense to just put in another booth. One booth had easy access to the waterbed, the other booth had this tiny barnyard-door looking thing. In my drunkenness getting in and out, I accumulated a fair amount of scrapes and bruises. There was a huge puddle in the middle of the waterbed... No one was really sure whether the thing was leaking, someone spilled their drink, or someone couldn't make it to the curtain toilets in time, but it was pretty nasty regardless.\n\nThe wide open space between the bar and the booths was the least claustrophobic, and it's worth a mention, because that huge amount of space usually doesn't exist in other dive bars (you know, because they have tables there instead). I guess this was like a dance floor?\n\nThe drinks were good, the prices were normal, the decor is amusing, the four bartenders were worked like dogs, there are naked titty designs all over the place... But I hate clown car bars like this. Especially since the place could have been more comfortable if they hadn't put priority in the decor. I couldn't believe there was actually a line to get in.

It reminded me of a tiki lounge except instead of Polynesia and fruity rum drinks it was all redneck middle America and cheap beer.  It all seems a little contrived because it isn't a dive bar and there never was a bar like this in the era, it pays homage to the 1970s like a pinball game, with lots of lights and noise and things that go bing, not by really recreating what life was like then.  But there's plenty to look at, period photos of naked girls laminated into the bartop.  \n\nA thick crowd of 21-25 year olds seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Everything was clean and orderly, staff was as cordial and efficient as could be given the crush.\n\nIt all made me feel very old, and there wasn't any reason to be here except to say I'd been.  It's a tiny place, not conducive to strike up a conversation with anyone you didn't come with.  The alcohol is a backlash against fancy liquor and artisan cocktails.  It's kind of cool to drink your father's weak canned beer once in a while, Olympia is a great refresher on a hot day.", "author": "Gil S."}

One of the booths in back is a replica of the no window, child molesters vans made popular by the 70s complete with waterbed and captain chairs. \n\nThe downside is the fact that they don't have any wines and while I applaud their commitment to the theme, the beers are all crappy. This is CA and they need to throw a craft beer or two onto the list. \nAlthough, I have to say that that ordering a Schlitz while awkwardly avoiding the 70s porn photos laminated to the bar was an experience.

Truly original and pretty well executed.  \n\nBut, the layout of this place is one of those classic SF travesties.  It's super narrow all the way from the door to the end of the bar, making it virtually impossible to get in and out let alone order a drink. This is only made harder by the giant white van seats that run along most of the bar. Although some think this awesome and I get that it goes with the theme but, uh, would it kill them to get *one* good beer in the place or at least anything on tap? Their liquor selection is equally (purposely) low-ride and just not what I'm really looking for in a bar.\n\nThat being said, because of the awesomeness detailed in Paragraph 1, I think this is a cool spot and would come back for an early evening starter beer when it's not so packed... or a private party.\n\n*Update* The owner has informed me that they have added 21st Amendment IPA, Coors Light and Fat Tire to the beer collection.

I can't really say i have ever seen a bartender do that - especially on a fairly busy night.\n\nAll in all, i ended up having one of the best times drinking on a wednesday that i've had in awhile - and it was largely based on the customer service.\n\nThat said, i do have a little common sense and understand that the scene would probably be different on the weekends and have decided to give it a month or two before i head back. Like any new place in the city, it is going to be jammed when it opens and will draw all types of crowds. Sadly, it seems like a lot of the people engulfed in the lame drama surrounding this place still haven't learned that.", "author": "charlie A."}

Kozy Kar is doing its part by overexposing kids to porno which is pretty much all over the back half of this bar. If the Playboys floor tiles and the movie Debbie Does Dallas playing on the flat screens doesn't scare you away, Kozy Kar is a pretty all around fun place to have a drink and be at a happening place on Polk St.\n\nThe bar definitely gets packed, to the point where they probably should have started a line 30 minutes ago but didn't. Plus the lay out of the bar itself is terrible, there's hardly any space between the counter and the wall for people to stand without getting elbowed and nudged by passer-byers every 15 seconds. But some people are into that, this place definitely has a lot of commotion going on which can add to the excitement of drinking on a weekday.\n\nMy biggest beef with this place is that they don't have a tap. The only time I drink out of a can is if I'm at a house party, I go to the bar to get a fresh pint of beer. On top of that, the beer they do have is about as cheap as it gets. Fortunately I'm not a very picky beer drinker, but if you're not down with PBR, then definitely go with the hard alcohol.\n\nThe music they play is upbeat and not too loud, so you can dance, chat, or just binge drink at your own pace. They generally play some fun dance hits and even the classic 80s songs that everyone knows and loves, whether you want to admit that or not is up to you.\n\nBottom line: Kozy Kar is great for a bar crawl party but not the coolest spot on the block. If you're looking to grab a seat and get comfortable with your friends, I wouldn't suggest this place.", "author": "Anthony C."}

The music is mixed and not insanely loud, so you can actually have a semi decent conversation without using megaphones.

First visit was great.  Tuesday night, good friend, excellent beret-wearing bartender (I think he also works at Bigfoot), and a really great drink.  Next visit was lame.  Friday night, a big group of my friends there for a birthday party with cake, gifts, the works.  When I ask the \"owner\" to turn off the music (which, mind you, is coming from a computer next to the register) so we can sing happy birthday, he flat out refuses.  Quote \"I'm the owner and I don't turn off the music on a Friday.\" Really?  Because singing happy birthday isn't music?  The birthday girl, who is pretty fun, left without my prompting because, as she later told me, the music was terrible!  \nAnyway, if you own a place, you should be thanking customers for supporting your dream, not shutting off at the first interesting suggestion of the night.  It's not like a asked him if I could DJ.  I just wanted his help in celebrating what could have been a great night for a lot of people.  Instead it was mediocre for most, and terrible for me.  I don't think any of us will go back to that bar.  \nIf you find yourself in the neighborhood, I wouldn't say avoid this bar like the plague, but I just think it fair to warn people that it's not the friendliest of places.  My friends hardly knew I was upset about anything, and yet most of them have said they didn't like the bar.  It's about vibes, people, and if you give paying customers a good vibe they'll come back.

I actually used to have a waterbed when I was a bit younger...and I ain't going to elaborate much further on that. But I will say that I do often defend waterbeds when people question the \"liquid-filled furniture\" question of lease applications. Seriously. The only reason I want to own a house is so that I can have a waterbed again. A wall-to-wall one. A waterbed room. How cool is that.\n\nAnother thing. I know that I shouldn't have very high standards for bathrooms in bars. I get it. I know. But seriously, what's up with the Polk St. bars having SHOWER CURTAINS for their \"doors?\" At that, curtains that don't have little hook and eye closures for privacy...or at least curtains that are short enough so that you can see feet under them. You really do have to open the curtains or talk into them in order to see if someone is in the stall. It's not like you can knock! Gah! Peeve. \n\nI also got hit on by more swingers? And some random blonde tried to put her crotch in my face? That's not the bar's fault though....\n\nBut, in all fairness, by about 1 am, it thinned out and was pretty fun. Mr friend really digged it. I recommend it for weeknights. Hopefully they'll actually have Schlitz when I visit again. They were out. And I was not going to drink PBR. It's not ironic anymore, hipsters.

Or if some dude-bag came to execute some terrible pick-up line, you could effectively pull the lesbian card while staring at the floor. \nBut, I must say, It sure seems to draw a crowd... to the point of over population.

The bar itself is tiny, no room behind the bar to mingle or wait for a drink- there is a one person walkway behind the barstool so if you're not seated at the bar, you're in the way.  Make your way to the small back room and there are 3, maybe 4 small car themed booths with oldish monitors playing porn.  This can invoke two reactions: 1) put the porn on the back burner as part of the ambiance or 2) stand and stare at it in front of everyone.  I saw creepy looking men standing and staring fixated at it for a good 20 minutes completely alone, which speaks to the kind of people a porn-themed bar might attract.  In general the place seems like it could use a good cleaning and replacement of everything from the floors to the monitors to the seating arrangements. If that's your bag, Kozy Kar is the right place.  If you want to have fun and dance in a classier setting, go to Blur, Hemlock, Mayes, Vertigo or any of the other fun bars on Polk street.

There a naked centerfolds everywhere so that was a plus until I saw the \nthree dudes just chilling in the back with no shirts on. Def a unique bar worth trying out for the decor but hopefully the dude ratio isn't so high when you go.", "author": "andrew m."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-28", "description": "Wow! This bar ROCKS!! It has an awesome decor. Obviously, vintage car theme, and it has a shag bed you can lay on and sip drinks. It also has a table that rotates and spins in a circle. A small dance floor to boogey down. The vibe is so cool here, and NO COVER! The only complaint is that because it is a small bar, you have to fight to get to the bar to order, but worth the wait! The bar makes you feel like you're in a shaggin' wagon, and the dance floor is a series of vintage playboy pictures.", "author": "Sam S."}

Even if the selection expands there is nothing too special about the place.  Its cool to check out the bar but there is not much to keep you there.  What I did like were the seats at the bar which are super comfortable.  I was there on a Thursday night around 10pm and the crowd was good, not too packed. It was cool for the 30 minutes I was there.  I probably won't be back but maybe.", "author": "Chuck Q."}

Somehow made it over the hill and up to some place that wasn't the marina. Was it Russian Hill, or nob hill or some kind of tender place I've been hearing about recently? Can't quite be sure, its likely the Long Island blurred my memory of the route and geographic location, but not the lounge. I am sitting on a plush couch next to a guy I've met who tells me about this drink I've never heard of. He buys me a Seagrams Seven and Seven, and tells me I'm pretty. Thanks. We sit and talk and he tells me he's from North Carolina which is my favorite place in the whole wide world. I'm not sure if it was Kozy Kar or him that made me smile, but I'd like to think its some kind of combination of the two. There were people dancing in outfits I've only ever seen in the Castro, and the music was dark wave eighties electronica what ever, but all that was just fun to look at and listen to. When I think of Kozy Kar and the music, and the people we watched, I'll always think of sitting on the couch drinking my new favorite drink with my new friend from my favorite place in the world.", "author": "Michelle K."}

I really admired the light bright sign.. it was a clever way to add into the 1970s retro van themed bar.. the bar itself was layed out well.. it has two waterbeds and booths with a tree shaped car freshener hanging from it.. miny dance floor with awesome old school hits playing.. The bar itself has a great vibe to it and i cant imagine anyone having a bad time while they are there.. all of the bartenders kick ass and know how to make a strong drink.. my only complaint is whats with covering up the man parts?! we get titties coming at you from every direction and a multi colored box covering peter and the boys! come on! lets see that thunder from down under! All in all this place is the shit and i cant wait to get my ass back on that waterbed!", "author": "Ashley M."}

It's a great place to just chill and rock to the 70's and 80's.  The decor was very interesting and fun.  The dance floor was a little small but it wasn't too crowded when we went so it worked out.
