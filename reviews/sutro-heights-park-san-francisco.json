One bit of statuary that also still stands is of Diana the Huntress. How she made it unscathed all these years is a marvel. All the rest were demolished, carted off, what-have-you.

When you see lions out in front of anything, you know there's something good behind there, whether it be super expensive houses, dim sum, or in this case, a super chill park.\n\nEntering the park, it looks pretty small, but it's more expansive than it initially appears. You could probably wander for a good hour here without running out of things to explore. There's a great view of the ocean and the Outer Sunset, some weird castle looking things that you can just sit on and chill, and a run-down looking gazebo thing that I wasn't really going to mess with. There are also a lot of little signs scattered throughout the park talking about the history of the area, but I don't come to parks to read, so I didn't read them, but you sure can!\n\nThere were a bunch of little kids learning to ride their bikes, retired people walking and stretching, and teenagers walking their dogs, so it's a good place for all age groups.  And of course, there are a bunch of trees and shade and lots of grass to run around and play in.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice park with an aura of calmness about it.

Really.\n\nI find that after living in SF for 3 years now, I am starting to forget just how amazing some of the places in The City can be.  The first time I stumbled upon Sutro Heights Park, I was actually blown away.  \n\nThe vistas here are stunning.  The views overlooking Ocean Beach and the (actual) Pacific Ocean are, on a clear day, some of the best to be had considering you can get there on a 38 ride for $2.25 and walk 200 more yards through a perfectly landscaped and lavishly vegetated flat stroll. \n\nOnce upon a time, the old Sutro Mansion was up here.  To the North is the Sutro Baths historic site (a downhill walk from here) - to the West are Seal Rocks, and to the South is Ocean Beach.  As you get to the farthest edge to the West, you've got a lot of height and a long view if the day is nice.  As I mentioned, it's amazing from a natural beauty and landscape design standpoint.  There is some history to be had here too.  Oh yeah, it bears making sure to say the following:   You should see the Sun set from here.  The water temperature changes fast and watching the air chill and light change is legitimately the sort of thing that can make you see the world differently.   \n\nThere are many other places that a stop here first after heading West can take you.  Sutro Baths, Lands End and Lincoln Park to the North.  Ocean Beach, Golden Gate Park, The Sunset (and don't forget Hockey Haven over on Balboa!!!) are not far to the South.   You can tie this park into a great day in many ways.  Pick a good day, because the weather will make this worth it if the day is nice.  \n\nAuthors Note:  The park is really on 48th at the end of Geary.

There was also a stable, a conservatory filled with exotic orchids and a rock and sandstone parapet that enclosed an observatory, water towers, and a gallery, The Sutro home was built to take advantage of the views. \n\nThe estate was demolished and the most of the statues were removed after the Sutro family donated the land, the gardens and their home to  San Francisco in 1938. \n\nAll that remains today are the winged lions guarding the entry to the park, and a few other statues.

Every park I visit, I compared to you!  \n\nThere were countless hot, summer days when I would head over to soak up some Vitamin D and escape the confines of my hot, A/C-free flat.  Laying out on the grass, taking in the smells of the ocean, and feeling the sea breeze hit my skin was what got me through some of the hottest SF days.  I loved walking over with a blanket and a book (or my journal) when it was a beautiful, clear day in the 'sco.  I often found comfort in watching the fog roll in on a chilly day, too.   \n\nOn occasion, I would ditch my own flat, which gave me a sunset/oceanview, to sneak in a visit to you, so we could share a sunset with each other.  Sunsets always felt a little more special with you than it did when I was just sitting at my kitchen table or on the couch.  \n\nThis was my \"thinking spot\"!  I enjoyed sitting at the top of the park overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Ocean Beach, the Cliff House, Golden Gate Park and the Sunset District!  It was during a visit to you that I decided to quit my job in San Francisco.  It was on another visit to you that I decided to leave my friends, my family and everything familiar to me to take a job in Seattle.  During times of stress, frustration and uncertainty, you helped ease my mind and gave me clarity.\n\nSelfishly, I am grateful not many SF residents even know you!  I appreciate being among the minority that holds you in such high regard... your beauty and the serenity you offer are a blessing.\n\nI'm thankful you were within walking distance of my residence.  But it's nice to confidently tell others it's not a bad experience getting to you - parking is a cinch around the park and the #18 & #38 buses stop right next to you.  Now, if only we could do something about the many, many miles between you and Seattle...\n\n\nI heart you (forever and ever and ever), Sutro Heights Park,\nChristine\n(formerly of 43rd Ave)", "author": "Christine Z."}

When people would ask where I lived, I'd reference this park.  Roy N. is correct about it's obscurity because people would then ask where Sutro Heights is, and I'd say high above the Cliff House looking out to sea in the NW corner of San Francisco.  People would then mistakenly offer their condolences for my having to live in a cold, wet, and windy place.  Actually the weather clears from the beach eastward.   Many were the days when Sutro Heights was in the sun and the cloudy-foggy weather was hung up on Twin Peaks.  It's warmer in the winter and cooler in the hot late summer due to the moderating influences of the sea.  I'd also get a built in daily walk from Sutro Heights to Lands End to the pathway north of Lincoln Park wherein I could walk to Sea Cliff or pop up past the Legion of Honor.  Many walking options in Sutro Heights.\n\nI've lived in the Avenues since the late 70s (Richmond or Sunset districts). So many were the sunny and warm days that it was the go-to spot for my son's birthday when he was a youngster.  Later it was the spot for the birthday picnics of many close friends and family members.  \n\nMy photos \"looking south\" from Sutro Heights are not as clear as Roberto F.'s or Toro E's.  As Roy would say, it's one of the most glorious places on sunny days in the City because it feels so far away from urban life.  \n\nI find it nice to visit there these days to see the status of the Proteus blossoms that bloom for a surprisingly long period of time.  See:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/laurinhamuse/4073515090/\n\nOn the warmest moments of the day ... usually in midafternoon ... you'll get to see hummingbirds zipping about sampling the flowers that are just about to bloom big time throughout the spring and summer.  \n\nThe readings about Adolph Sutro's home on this site are very interesting and give one a sense of the history of area.  There are a few iconic fixtures left like the Gazebo pictured here on Flickr:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/orange27/357916230\n\nThis is still one of my favorite meet-up places for a walk and talk or even a picnic and party.", "author": "Em S."}

Sometimes your expectations are met instantaneously, like the moment you witness fog rolling over the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge or the breathless wonder that engages you from your omnipotent stance atop Twin Peaks.\n\nOther places, while equally mesmerizing, are oftentimes harder to come by. Sutro Heights Park is one such place. It is elusive and protected, circumscribed by trees and cradled by a row of houses on one side, and on the others a twisted highway and endless sky.\n\nThere's an immediate sense of history when you go here and a quiet understanding that even a city as famous and infamous as San Francisco is not unshakable. Grecian statues still stand, the onslaught of time and the elements reflecting in their missing limbs and yellowing facades. The estate's ruins are in no better condition: to a child they are simply the remnants of a castle, to others a symbol of an opulent dream long brought to reality.\n\nIt is an anomaly, a rare location where you are both in the present and in the past.

Such rave reviews, I wondered how I had not visited when I lived in SF for eight years. So I have seen thousands of city views that are mindblowing. I used to take morning coffee walks alone or with a friend, and was frequently dazzled with a view after turning a random corner. But even San Franciscans were saying it was the favorite view of all time. \n\nWell, I loved the park and the view is, indeed,  fantastic, but I have to say when I thought about whether it would make even my top ten favorite views ever, it did not. People were saying they had traveled all over the world and this is still the favorite view for them. \nWell, I have traveled some, and favorites that rather quickly came to mind above Sutro Park would be Pacifica, the drive on the highway to Pacifica, Montara, Costa Rica, Alaska, especially Skagway sailaway, I believe, that was breathtaking, View from Nob Hill, from Ocean Beach, from Angel Island to the city, bridges from Treasure Island, Cozumel views from ship, sailing into Vancouver, Swiss Alps to Lake Lucerne, Monaco, Nice, Roatan Island, Panama Canal; oh, and Emerald Bay in South Tahoe, view from Homewood Resort of the lake;  these are just a few places that captured my heart more than Sutro, lovely as it was. But it wouldn't make my top ten or maybe even top thirty...or seventy-five....so I just wanted to share that opinion.

Ever. \n\nYou will have many options when you come here. You can walk along the path in Sutro Heights Park (proper) as it curves to the right and the entire north bay acknowledges your presence in a dramatic unveiling. You begin to see the water of the bay... then the mountains of Marin... then the Golden Gate Bridge and everything beyond it. The path continues for a half mile until it dead ends at a staircase. In a San Francisco version of  \"Choose Your Own Adventure,\" you can either take the stairs that fork to the left which will lead you down near the water... or you can continue forward and prepare to be suffocated by amazingness.\n\nThe stairs eventually end and you walk across a narrow dirt path with an extremely steep drop to your right. At this point you'll be thinking you're in picture-taking heaven... but keep going. Walk down a mini dip and back up onto the platform atop the hill in the ocean. Now, look around. You are standing in the middle of the bay with every view you could possibly want. Dramatic cliff sides, waves crashing against the shore, and the fog horn in what feels like an arm length's distance.  When you look down at the next level of this hill, you will find a labyrinth made of pebbles, silently enticing you to walk its multiple paths.\n\nAnd if this doesn't interest you, walk down to the Sutro Baths and check out the remains of old-school San Francisco luxury. You can even walk through a mountain and end up on the other side where multiple rocks, shooting out from the sea, are directly in front of you. I can't help but think of The Goonies every time I'm down there.\n\nAnd if THAT isn't good enough, continue down Geary, follow the road as it curves past the Cliff House and a three mile span of Ocean Beach will suddenly appear. If you see this on a sunny day, when the coast goes on forever until it appears to be swallowed up by the mountains... as the sun sets over the Pacific and the water reflects multiple shades of orange, red and purple... you will understand why I'll never leave this city.", "author": "Jared S."}

The conservatory is long gone and so is his house - which is a shame because the grounds were given to the city of SF and should have been maintained.  At least the lawn is in decent shape and a few statues remain (there used to be hundreds), including the lions that guarded the gate (but the gate is no longer there).\n\nWhen you climb up to where Sutro's home stood (only the foundation remains), you'll see that he picked a spot with breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean and Ocean Beach.  There are a few benches to sit and enjoy the view and some signs that tell you about the history of this location.  \n\nFree parking (and plenty of it).", "author": "Lolia S."}

Firstly, its a dog friendly park, equipped with recycled plastic bags for litter and plenty of friendly dogs and garbage cans throughout.  There are also paved roads perfect for walks and bike rides. There are plenty of park benches scattered throughout the park with breathtaking views overlooking the beach, Seal Rock, and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nI frequent this park to find solitude, read, and enjoy the sun.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-10", "description": "Sutro Heights Park is a wonderful little modern ruin right next to the residential sprawl of west San Francisco.  The form site of Adolf Sutro's mansion, the area is now an open park, with a built up stone foundation where the house once was.  A few of the original sculptures still dot the location, but the real charms lie in the landscaping and the views.  \n\nThe park is a magnet for dog lovers, who come in droves and play with their dogs on the small, shaded field at the heart of the park.  beautifully tended flowers, palms, and other plant life are bunched together on the east side of the foundation, and nicely decorate parts of the west side of the foundation (especially on the southwest side).  \n\nThe view from the top of the Sutro foundation is also fantastic.  On a clear day you can see all the way into Daly City and beyond, stretching far along the coast.  Looking out at the ocean, you can see the waves crashing against Seal Rock.  Views of the mouth of the Golden Gate are limited though.\n\nFor a short (very very short) hike, try starting at the steps climbing up the sand at La Playa and Balboa.  The brief walk up is pleasant, offers beautiful vistas, and drops you right into the park.\n\nFor an added thrill, go on a clear night and look down Ocean Beach at fire that dot its heart and the lights of Richmond and Sunset!", "author": "Eric M."}

When my brother lived in the neighborhood, he, I, and some of his friends would often play frisbee golf here.  No, there's no official course, but we had a pretty cool unofficial one, including the final hole that went down the hill towards La Playa.  We lost a bunch of frisbees on that hole.\n\nBesides its frisbee-golf greatness, Sutro Height Park is interesting because it's such a hodgepodge.  Parts of it are well maintained, and other parts are falling apart.  Gophers have basically taken over a lot of the lawns, while the groundskeepers keep other parts picture perfect.  The falling-apart statues all over the places are also cool, as is the amazing view from the parapet thing.  I think it's a parapet.\n\nI also like that this park, while outlandish in many ways, also functions as a regular old neighborhood park.  You'll find people strolling their children, dogs running around, and people catching sun when there is sun.", "author": "John S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-07-09", "description": "One of the most underlooked treasures in San Francisco.  With fantastic vistas of the Pacific, great smelling eucalytus trees, statues of Diana, ruins of the old Sutro House, rose gardens, big promenade and those lions at the gates -- this is one of my favorite places to stroll and look at the ocean.  There is a dreamy and yes, haunted quality to it. \n\nThe background story on Sutro Park is just fascinating.  From what I remember, Sutro, flush with gold cash, came to SF and instead of doing like all the rich folk did (build a gated mansion in Nob Hill), he bought land on the sand dunes in the \"outer lands\" where nothing was.  People thought was crazy.  Sutro built the park and employed a ton of landscapers to create this gorgeous place with statues, all kinds of trees, and built his old modest but stately home on it.  He even built the cliff that now exists between it and ocean beach.  Then he did the unthinkable and opened it to the public! He also built the nearby Sutro Baths for the public.  My favorite anecdote was that he shocked his prominent guests, like Oscar Wilde, by not abiding by an upstairs/downstairs philosophy and had the servants eat at the same table as everyone else.\n\nI typically take a walk around Lands End after walking in the park here.  Oh, and those lions are replicas of those at Trafalgar Square.  Sutro was really into European sculpture and gardens. Parking is easy and plentiful.  Take visitors and have brunch at the Cliff House. The french toast is good there and the apple turnovers too!", "author": "Ashley S."}

One of my friends took me and my family out here to check out the view and to see the Sutro mansion -- or what's left of it.  It would be a nice hike during warmer weather.  Definitely worth a visit at least once.", "author": "Diana N."}

The history factor is also a big turn on for us history geeks... pretty sweet spot and catch me there at least once a week.", "author": "Gen O."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-15", "description": "Sutro Heights Park is a gem of a park, with beautiful Ocean views, flowers, and a few picnic tables with views of the waves crashing below.  This is a small neighborhood park, and while I would like to keep it to myself, this is a wonderful place to spend an afternoon.  There are steps which descend to Ocean Beach as you walk downhill towards Sutro Heights Avenue....just walk down the path that runs along the side of the big, haunted looking house which is the first house at the edge of the park, and voila, steps to the left of you...and another spectacular view, which you might just have to yourself.", "author": "George S."}

Just to saunter around, enjoy a picnic with friends, make out with my man,  or get some cardio going, Sutro Heights Park is one of the most beautiful spots in the city (and country).", "author": "Agent F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-12-13", "description": "This is an AMAZING park and is definitely one of my favorite spots in the City. I live completely on the opposite side of town but make a point to go to this park at least once a month just because it is so good for the soul. Even with all the touristy crap around, this park is still quiet and peaceful, and also well maintained. The only real downside is that sometimes the Muni buses sit idling across the street and you can smell the exhaust on those rare days when the air is still.", "author": "John R."}

Today my friend and I decided to venture in.  It was right around sunset and the air had a misty san francisco spring quality with birds flying about, children playing amongst lillie's and great views down of the great wide ocean beach.  There are palm trees and lovely expanses of grass.  I was really happy to pause here for a minute on our run.  On another note, one time while running by I witnessed what seriously looked like some sort of cult meeting of men in black trench coats in a circle.  This sorta weirded me out a bit.  Don't go here at night.  But don't, in fact, go anywhere that is not well lit at night.  It just isn't so smart.  And always wear white at night!  (That was a free take home message from my dad greg.)  Bottom line: this a great spot to take friends and loved one's during the day.", "author": "Lauren S."}

Maybe all dog people are good people. We have a couple of pot lucks a year and it's just a lovely, neighborhood place that makes me so grateful that when I finally settled down, dis neighborhood was de place. Never too crowded, lots of well behaved dogs of all sizes, sometimes on leash, sometimes off. The law is on leash but..just be warned of the crazy lady who calls the park police if your dog is off leash if you're coming from the Anza and Camino entrance. Keep them on leash until you pass the first meadow, but you didn't hear that from me!  Also a lovely park for running, strolling, picnicking, whale watching and just generally being grateful to be alive. The view from the Parapet, where the old house used to be, is breathtaking. Look for the stunning statue of Diana just east of the main walkway. Sometimes cold and foggy, always an amazing park.", "author": "Sharon J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-09-10", "description": "I love this little tiny park on a makeshift cliff!  It's very small, but oh so quaint.  It's located across the street from the cliffhouse atop that big rocky cliff.  It seems more or less to be a place where people walk their dogs, but it has a bit other city charm to it.  I would almost compare to Frasier's apartment on the show, where he used the decorating technique of using single fine pieces that stand alone individually, and since they are all nice pieces, they work together without having to be part of some overall design.  There's a statue, there's a strange castle-esque wall, there's individual trees that don't seem to belong there, a small rolling hill, a palatial style balcony that overlooks the ocean, do i need to keep going? It's not big, but if you want a little time to reflect on a cloudy day and want to see the western coastline of San Francisco here's the spot.  Just not everybody ok? I don't want this place overcrowded....", "author": "Raffi Y."}

In fact, the last time was there was a group doing tai chi on the stone platform where Adolph Sutro's house used to sit.  It looked like a setting for Mortal Combat.  The park is also completely secluded--I live only a couple blocks away and only found it by accident.  You can't get better views.", "author": "Nick K."}
