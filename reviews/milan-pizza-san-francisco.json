{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-10", "description": "I've eaten here a lot over the years. Solid late night option after the bars. However, after my last experience I will not patronize this business any longer. I am only applying this rating to the lack of resolution and if there was one, this place in my eyes would rate more favorably.\n\nI work in the area and my coworkers wanted pizza. We looked on Yelp and saw Milan had free delivery so we ordered an extra large special pizza from them. About 10 minutes later we realized we needed more pizza so we called back and added to the order. We had also seen online at www.milanpizzasf.com they had a deal where if you ordered a three topping pizza or more, they'd sell us another x-large pizza of equal or lesser value for half price. However, they said they did not have any such special deal but would give us a smaller discount. We figured we were hungry so we'd order the pizza and go in to correct them later.\n\nAfter shift, I went to explain to the manager the situation and even showed him a screenshot of the deal I saw. He said they don't use that website and referred me to another website, www.milanpizzamenu.com, which did not show the deal. The thing is, both websites show up in the top five in the Google results. My problem is, presumably, both websites belong to them, especially since they have the same addresses and same menus. The manager was very polite but still refused to honor the mistake.\n\nI work in the service industry. Suffice to say, if there was an incorrect advertisement, I would correct it and also resolve any issues it might have caused some customers. The manager is a nice enough fellow and although I'm generally not one to tell someone how they should run their business, I would tell them if you want to keep your customers, then own up to your mistakes and resolve it with your customers. There was no resolution to say the least.\n\nTherefore, I and my place of work will no longer patronize this business. Hopefully, they will take down www.milanpizzasf.com and not confuse potential customers any longer.", "author": "Joshua G."}

The delivery was decent as far as timing. The only knock is the fact that one of my marinara was effectively empty when I received it because of how it was placed in the box. The food however is a different story.\nPizza:\nThe crust was pretty tasteless. The cheese was nothing special either. The thing I tasted the most of was the sauce. It is definitely seasoned, maybe a little too much. Either that or it seems that way because of the blandness of the rest of the pizza. It was definitely edible, but I have had better. Also, the cheese was a little overcooked for my liking.\nCheese Garlic Bread:\nAnother thing I have had better. I assume they cooked it first because the cheese wasn't really melted any more. It has more taste than the pizza, so that is a plus.\n\nOverall, I have had better and I expected a little better. I would still order from this place, but probably something different.", "author": "Neil S."}

Then I realized he was a cross the street on his car on his phone doing who knows what!! He called and again and I told him I was outside and he seem like he wanted me to go to him and pick up my food.. ITS CALL DELIVERY for a reason. Anyways after I got my food I came inside my apartment I open the box off wings and it was 10 of the saddest and driest wings I've seen!! No buffalo sauce literally no sauce not even on the side or even ranch.. I checked my receipt thinking maybe I had made a mistake and order plain wings and it clearly said BUFFALO WINGS.

It was the perfect pizza at the time, and I can only imagine its the perfect pizza at all other times as well. It's thick crust is just magnificent and the toppings on my combo slice seemed pretty fresh.\n\nThey were pretty busy at the time, but we managed to snag a table in the back. It's not the cleanest looking pizza joint on the inside, but it didn't bother me too much - its such a small place and I've seen much worse.\n\nI read several reviews that say their delivery guy/process is awful and awfully slow.

I work in Union Square, and had the misfortune of a 7:45p lunch. With not a lot of choices that fall outside of the Tourist Trap - Overrated by Tourists - Fast Food trifecta, I decided to deal with the extra walk to make it over to Kare-Ken. Unfortunately, it was a Monday, and I was stuck on the outskirts of the TL with 40 minutes left on the clock. After deciding the 10-minute wait for Pharaoh's would be too much to bear, I opted to grab two slices from Milan (one Pepp and Sausage, one Combination). The slices were re-heated, chucked in a box, and came out to $10 even with a Snapple. \n\nThe crust is a thicker build at Milan. I am of the school of thought that if you have a thicker crust, you should compensate for having a healthy quantity of toppings, lest one find themselves eating a mediocre open-faced sandwich. Milan's, suffice to say, did not have this, and the slightly burnt toppings on the Combination did not help. The bright point of the meal (which I ate on the way back to work), was that a homeless dude asked me for a slice (not cash, just a slice), so at least Milan's brightened his night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-11-10", "description": "In supporting this establishment you torment the people who live in the building, especially if you eat here between 10PM and 4AM.\n\nDO NOT EAT AT MILAN PIZZA!!!\n\nSince 09/26/2008, there has been an on going noise issue in this building due to a rooftop exhaust system operated by Milan Pizza. A formal complaint was first filed at that time with the San Francisco Department of Public Health (ComplaintID 26588) by a tenant who lives right underneath this exhaust system and has suffered a great deal due to the noise it generates and the fumes it spills into his studio apartment. He is a senior citizen.\n \nOn May 7th, 2013, Milan Pizza received an Extended Hours Permit through the Entertainment Commission and now on average operates the exhaust system 16-17 hours a day. I only recently found all of this out because in October of 2013, I started to hear a loud clanking and strange humming noise that was keeping me up at night. I live on the third floor and there is still one more floor above me.\n \nI filed a complaint with the San Francisco Department of Public Health in February 2014 to help determine what was making the noise. They determined that it was the exhaust system from Milan Pizza responsible for the loud noise. On 03/11/2014, they measured the noise and found that the exhaust system generates a noise of 5.8 dBA above the ambient noise level. This is a clear violation of SFMPC Article 29 Section 2909[a][1]- Residential Property Noise Limits. It states, no person shall produce or allow to be produced by any machine, or device, music or entertainment or any combination of same, on residential property over which the person has ownership or control, a noise level more than 5 dBA above the ambient at any point outside of the property plane. Nowhere in this original article does it state or imply that the noise needs to be created by residential use in order for it to be enforced; the use of the word \"any\" indicates any and all noise no matter the source. These original limits were set in place to protect the health of the residents living in San Francisco, in any circumstance, from excessive noise.\n \nBecause the noise is being generated by a business in the basement of the building however, the residents in the four floors above the business are intentionally being denied our right to Quiet Enjoyment of our apartments by being forced to live under noise limits that were originally set forth strictly for commercial property. A  business should only be allowed to operate in a mixed-use building if it is able to adhere to Residential Property Noise Limits. Residential Property Noise Limits exist for a reason and should be safeguarded in mixed-use buildings. Failure to do so creates ghettos and marginalizes people as second-class citizens to businesses simply because the City and County stand to make a profit from taxes. The irony is that the City of San Francisco is simultaneously using two different noise limits in mixed-use buildings. A normal resident such as myself cannot make any noise past 10:00 PM and would be in violation of the Noise Ordinance if I were to make the same amount of noise that Milan Pizza makes at this building. I would be evicted if I did not comply. If the owner of the building ran the exact same exhaust system on the roof instead of Milan, the residents would be able to have the city either make the owner replace the fan so it made less noise or have it removed all together. This double standard is unethical and unnecessarily victimizes the residents.\n \nThis incessant noise is in violation of the Warranty of Quiet Possession and needs to be resolved immediately. It is unreasonable and cruel for the City and County of San Francisco to force tenants to live this way.\n \nIntentionally failing to enforce or misuse the codes that are in place for monetary gain is harmful to the residents of San Francisco.\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS.", "author": "Mister E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-15", "description": "Milan Pizza is tough for me because the pizza is actually decent. If I were grading the pizza alone I would give them 3 or 4 stars. But, when you order a pizza there is far more involved than just crust, sauce, cheese and toppings. You also want your order to be correct, you want your pizza to be delivered in a reasonable amount of time and you want the people you interact with to be reasonably friendly. It was in these latter aspects that Milan fails. In most cases it takes them an hour to make a delivery, I consider that reasonable. However, about one third of the time it takes them 2-3 hours. I've had my order incorrect more often than not. For example, in a recent order that was placed through Eat24, I ordered a pizza, wings, and a soda. Instead, I received a pizza, salad and a similar (but not exact) soda. Thinking I had received someone else's order I contacted Eat24 who contacted the store. Milan said they would send the wings out, they had just messed up. Three hours later, wings arrive. The delivery driver immediately gets an attitude and keeps repeating he delivered a salad. That's true, he did. But it's also true that's not what was ordered. That is fairy typical of Milan: You will consider ordering from there because the pizza is good, but eventually they will mess up your order one too many times, they will be rude once too much and you will refuse to do business with them any longer.", "author": "Justin H."}

Well, I break my own obsessively crafted and revised Yelp rules all the time, and I give plenty of businesses five stars when really they only deserve four, but pizza is another category altogether.  My pizza reviews are bigger than me (insert pun here), and so I feel especially conscientious about getting the star level correct.\n\nOK, story time.\n\nRemember Our Friend?  You don't?  Why, he's the guy who used to own Divisadero Farmers Market, the non-farmers market farmers market on Divisadero, silly.  Well, his three main employees were Rafik, who now works at Rose Food Mart in the Mission, another guy who's now a limo driver, and Ahmad.\n\nWhy is this relevant?  Well, because I've run into all three of these characters in other places in SF.  First, it was Rafik.  I've already written enough about him in my Rose Food Mart review.  Soon after reconnecting with Rafik, I saw the other guy standing in front of his limo outside of Divisadero Farmers Market.  I asked him how he was doing, and he said all right.  He randomly asked about Rafik, and I told him I had actually run into him.\n\nOK, here's where it gets better.  The same night I saw the other guy, I ordered pizza from Milan Pizza for the first time.  When the delivery guy showed up, it was Ahmad, the third guy who used to work for Our Friend.  He asked how I was doing, and we talked about Rafik and the other guy.\n\nI've ordered pizza from Milan Pizza a bunch of times, and almost every time, Ahmad has been my delivery guy.  He's always really friendly, and he tells me how things are going.  His cousin, who also works at Milan Pizza, takes the orders over the phone, and his voice is very similar to Ahmad's.  For a long time, I thought the guy on the phone was Ahmad, but I had a surreal experience of talking to that guy on the phone (I was calling to find out when my pizza was coming) and seeing Ahmad get out of his car.  It freaked me out for a second because I wanted to say, \"It's OK, Ahmad; Ahmad just got here.\"\n\n(Cool.  Lightning in San Francisco.  So rare and beautiful.  Tuesday, January 19, 2010, 3 p.m.)\n\nThe pizza itself is really solid.  It's not amazing, but it's consistent, and the toppings are fresh.  They have some pretty good deals on their website.  The more often you order from them, the quicker their service.  I believe this is because Ahmad specifically visits me first when he has multiple deliveries to make on one run.\n\nOK, I lied in the beginning of this review.  Five stars it is.

I call today and they were kind enough to make another pizza and deliver it to us. Let me tell you. It was worth the wait. The dough was thin and crispy. The cheese was amazing. The sauce had a nice kick to it. The best pizza I've had in quite some time. I'm giving them 5 stars for their amazing customer service and delicious pizza. Yum!!!!!", "author": "Nando C."}

Moreover, if you want to say that \"Treasure Island delivery isn't guaranteed\", you should do so at the time of the order and only during rush hour. And perhaps you should look into what \"rush hour\" is defined as because it isn't after 9PM.\n\nYou should also be aware of things such as \"google maps\" and \"traffic.com\" that allow people to look at traffic in the city and on the bridge so they can know quite clearly if you botched their order (like you did with us) or just hit traffic (which you didn't since we had 2 different guests arrive in 2 different vehicles over the course of our 4 hour pizza debacle.

I'm usually not a fan of thick crust, but theirs has a delicious bread-like taste, mixed each day in that huge monolith of a Kitchenaid standmixer in the back room. Slices are large and toppings are generous, but not so overwhelming that it sinks the slice like the Titanic when I hold it in one hand. Just one slice and I'm satisfied with a full tummy and the nostalgia of all those late night noshings a certain stressed out college kid used to do on midterm nights. And considering the amount of OT hours I've been racking up lately, I've become quite a regular here. \n\nI usually ask for the veggie pizza slice, add chicken, and I love how it doesn't taste greasy. Depending on who completes my order, I sometimes get an additional sprinkling of cheese on top, and they'll always give it a quick pop in the oven to re-warm it and make sure the bottom stays crunchy. \n\nIn addition, the guys that run the place are always extra nice to me. From what I've seen they've been very accommodating to picky pizza eaters wanting their slices done a certain way, but get confused easily when someone orders an item others rarely pick (like the antipasto salad). \n\n5 stars, although I haven't tried their delivery services yet.", "author": "ChiYan T."}

They get to me within the allotted amount of time, and the delivery guys are always polite.\n\nI've also tried their mozzarella sticks and french fries, which, separately, are pretty friggin delicious for mozzarella sticks and french fries.

Overall it's good in a jam. We spent some time here waiting for some friends of ours. There is usually a soccer game playing with a crowd watching intently. The interior is nothing special but it is something to write about. As we were sitting there, you could hear water dropping slowly into a bucket. The bucket was by the cash register. A little while later the crack in the ceiling started letting more water through, almost as if the source above had a reason to let more water out (a shower, a toilet, etc are all that came to mind). Sadly we saw this as we left :(", "author": "Greg G."}

I'm in town on vacation and had them deliver it to my hotel.  Ordered a pepperoni pizza and chicken wings for under $20. Only thing I wish was for the pizza to be hotter on delivery but I can't really complain. They are pretty quick on delivery too. Got here in less that 40 minutes.", "author": "Siegfried A."}

For no real reason other than because it was nearby, we chose this place.  The best thing about having no expectations is that there can be pleasant surprises.  The pizza was warm and the pepperoni wasn't the cheap stuff that a lot of places use.  There was copious amounts of cheese on the crust and... need anything more be said?  Lots of cheese!!!!", "author": "Lucius M."}

Thank goodness for my girlfriends for not listening to me that night. I was wasted as usual on our first bachelorette party night. Friends would not get me my onion rings from Mel's Diner so after 3 rounds in the bathroom, I finally came to my senses and ate a slice of this beautiful pizza. It was tasty alright.

It is right around the corner, and honestly the pizza is really really good.\n\nHowever, last night I decided to get a slice after a late night of working.  A plain cheese slice I should say.  So I go home and go to bed.\n\nIn the middle of the night I wake up, my head is spinning.  I try to stand up, but can't at all.  I fall into the wall.  Equilibrium all off.  I can't look at anything, because its just spinning and shaking.  I have to close my eyes.  I climb back into bed and try hard not to move, or else I will lose my mind, and hopefully not throw up, because there is no way I can make it to the bathroom.\n\nSomehow I fall back asleep, and wake up in the morning.  Hoping it was a bad dream.  Nope.  Still the same: can't move, stomach hurts, can't see anything clearly, head spinnning, want to vomit, but can't get anywhere.\n\nI have NEVER had food poisoning like this before.  It is late in the afternoon and only now I can start to see clearly a bit....good enough to write this damn review.  I know it is this place because I had barely ate anything at all yesterday.  Must be their old moldy cheese.\n\nThis is horrible.  \n\nNo matter how much that I think their pizza is delicious, I can not take the risk of this happening to me again.  Not going to go back.  This is horrible....", "author": "Ryan W."}

The massive(ly annoying) crowds at Ambassador had me so mad I decided I was going to leave... alone.\n\nNot a great idea in this area of town at night, you know?!\n\nAfter circling the block a few times, I decided that maybe some pizza would cheer me up.  And it totally did the trick.  A nice warm slice of pepperoni with crushed red pepper.  I sat there with my BlackBerry and read Lance Armstrong's tweets from the Tour de France, eating pizza, and helping inebriated people dispense water from the cooler next to me.\n\nNot too greasy and total comfort food exactly when I needed it.  The workers were so efficient and friendly.  They also had gelato.  Just the fact that it was there in case I needed some mint-chip was uber comforting.  A neighborhood gem for the people who need a time out of Swig, Ambassador, and the other local establishments.  \n\nBut not sure I would frequent this place in the daytime ;-)\n\nFour stars at night after a couple of cocktails.

The dough is a bit too thick for my liking but overall, I never experienced it undercooked or burnt.

It was the Mother's family recipe and it was off the hook, amazing. Her son had to call her down to make one anytime it was ordered (she wouldn't even give her recipe to her son :) Basically as for Pizza Milano, it was the only Pizza option in my neighborhood that was passable/not highway robbery and open late night.
