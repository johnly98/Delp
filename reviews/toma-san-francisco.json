The food was excellent -- I ordered a wet chicken burrito and it was MONSTROUS.\n\nMy partner ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was definitely decent.\n\nThe burrito could easily feed two people with leftovers. The quesadilla might leave you scrummaging through the chip bag afterwards. Between the two, you can easily feed three hungry guys with leftovers.\n\nI was a little floored by the bill. It ended up being $50 for a burrito, quesadilla, chips and guac and three beers.\n\nThe guac was really good and a healthy portion as well. I still debate as to whether I would order it again if I were to return.\n\nThe beers were out of a bottle --standard fare.\n\nI will say, customer service was excellent, especially for a quick-service grab-n'-go-type restaurant that this is. The gentleman who rang us up checked on us a few times and made sure we had utensils and everything we needed.\n\nAll in all, I would come back, though I'd probably ditch the beers and guac because they dirtied the bill and didn't add enough to the experience to justify.", "author": "Nima A."}

I love corn tortillas so I was impressed the base, which was a thick corn tortilla that was perfectly soft yet toasted. The sauce that it came with hardly had any flavor, but the sopes itself was sufficient without the sauce because the meat was well-seasoned and the shreddings were perfect. I really enjoyed my boyfriend's quesadilla -- it had the perfect amount of cheese and meat, and the meat was perfectly seasoned. We were both definitely craving it the next day and were really glad that we found this little gem of a place near the place that we were staying. \n\nMy only complaints are that it was a cold night and the restaurant was cold inside because there is a big window that was open and the door was wide open. Additionally, the wait was pretty long since they seemed to be caught up preparing a lot of phone orders, so that was also a bit annoying. I would suggest that you call ahead in order to save some time waiting, since everyone else seems to do that.", "author": "Molly L."}

But after I got my tacos I realized there is a difference between a freshly made corn tortilla and a HAND-made tortilla. Anyhow, the tortilla itself was thick and too soft - to the point where I could not taste it and it kind of dissolved a bit from the liquid coming from the meat. They have special meats of the day and on Wednesdays it's carnitas. I also got a carne asada and camarones (shrimp) taco. ($3.25 each) The meat quality was great, the carne asada had large chunks of steak that was still a little rare, which I liked a lot. Shrimp and carnitas were made perfectly and well seasoned. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a carne asada quesadilla, a horchata, and a side of guacamole. He too, said the carne asada was really good. The salsa bar is limited and none of the salsas really stood out to me, they were pretty bland. The guac costs an extra dollar-something and they give it to you in a small container the same size as you would get from the salsa bar. I was disappointed to find that the guacamole was even more bland and very lacking in seasoning compared to other Mexican places I've been to. If you check in on Yelp, you get a free bag of chips but you can tell that the chips are not made in store and probably from a bag. *sigh* \n\nThere is a sign that says there is a secret menu if you go on their website, but we went on the website only to find that neither the items on the menu nor the prices match up (it's now more expensive). I think Toma is an okay place to get Mexican food but like another Yelper said, it's not mind-blowing. It's also very small inside with only one table and a few bar style seats against the wall.", "author": "Cecille W."}

There's a real lack of deliciousness that you normally find in burritos, maybe because it's filled primarily with very rice and beans (where's the meat in this thing?)and the meat hasn't seen the love that most Mexican restaurants prioritize in giving? Even if you pay for extras that should probably come standard (cream, guac), I'd set the bar pretty low for you walking out of there satisfied with your $13 burrito; it's just not working, IMO. I can't tell if they're trying too hard or not enough with the ingredients. Like, you know when you go to a restaurant that touts high quality ingredients but then the food comes out and it's just not that good? It's kind of like that but in burrito form which I have to imagine is just not that common. Needless to say I'm surprised at the averageness of the burrito.

I wound up ordering a pork quesadilla and half-chicken, half-beef bowl, with free bag of chips and salsa for checking in on Yelp!\n\nI love TOMA because 1) it's close to my home since I live in the Marina, and 2) it's really reasonably priced Mexican food that isn't Chipotle. Everything on the menu is less than $10 and is made to order, so it's super fresh and steaming hot when you get your food. \n\nThe meat here is really delicious. I think that's why I enjoyed the food so much since the pork, beef, and chicken was so, so tasty. The protein MADE the dish. My quesadilla was super flavorful, though I did expect a larger portion size for the price that I paid. The bowls are a similar price and came with much more stuff.\n\nHonestly, nothing really horrible to say about TOMA other than the fact that I didn't get the nicest vibe from the worker there. He was kind of blunt and slightly rude. It also kind of has a hole-in-the-wall feel to the place, which makes me automatically associate dirtiness with it, regardless of how clean the place actually is. Maybe they could amp up the decor a little bit more to make it seem more clean and welcoming.

I did enjoy their salsa bar - there was one salsa in particular in the back right that was fresh and had a good kick to it.  And I would also recommend their agua fresca - on Sunday they had a honeydew one that was so good!\nAlso, it might be good to know that there's not much sitting space.

They use quality meat and ingredients. Unlike most other tacquerias I've been to, the place doesn't smell like lard and neither does their food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-28", "description": "Burritos. A staple particularly in This City of origin. San Francisco is considered the historic center of the economical and handy meal. How do fringe purveyors compete, with, with the legacy and with the outliers?\n\nTOMA is a huge addition to the Chestnut Street - Union Street communities of those who consider themselves connoisseurs and success stories in our Contemporary Era. When it was covered that, another, local vendor of Latino foods, had been frequented by one of our chosen, illustrious hurlers for a World Champion team of 'ballers, all was the rage, both for that singled-out provider of Fish Taco, but the lane, and its tangents, all providers of nutrition and flavor and texture, seemed to benefit: it is a challenge to arrive on time to one's Apple Store Genius Bar or Online Pickup appointment without having to step off of the curb and ride the bus stop to circumvent the words are wealthy eaters and shoppers at The Gap...\n\nTOMA took over a small insert from a former 'dog vender, which, I could never understand, how they could have possibly made a dent in the food consciousness of those just down the street serving one of the best 'burger meals in town, at Barney's, or, the greenaholics' Vegan food and juicer, The Planet Cafe (don't get me started about the 10 other eateries across a spectrum one also has to consider as you approach this hole in the wall.)\n\nThe uniqueness of TOMA is in its entire presentation of an eatery. Yes, one can gather a traditional fare down and around the corner at Los Hermanos, But, there seems to be a Fish Taco price war heating up between LH and Tacolicious: on the way up, not down, a disservice to the consumer, despite many who have deep pockets.\n\nWhat should one expect to pay for a burrito in San Francisco: any district to any degree of authenticity, substance, healthiness, cleanliness?\n\nAbout $9.\n\nAdd shrimp? Another $2.\n\nMy only complaint with TOMA: the board featuring its daily special meat option is nowhere near the main menu above the register; I had no idea I had an option other than standard fare or their signature, pre-defined burrito.\n\nYet, the staff were kind enough to provide me with a taste sample of the daily special, which was absolutely amazing.\n\nI had already committed to a pork protein which, grilled to order from a container where it had been marinating, was simply divine inside my burrito.\n\nThe size was not ginormous but it was substantial.\n\nThe beans were perfect: firm but giving to the teeth; fresh and flavorful; no extra liquid including the starchy substance one can encounter infusing a burrito.\n\nThe balance in texture, flavor, color, each ingredient layered, fresh: perfect.\n\nI am not a huge fan of any other burrito in San Francisco: consider a venn diagram to consider all burritos in San Francisco - those you may walk or drive to in your local community.\n\nThat is one interesting fact about the distribution of burritos in the San Francisco: somehow, the Illuminati of Ethnic Foods make it impossible to have real choice. Consider La Canasta, on Buchanan. They have an attitude of convenience, a constant pulse of families, au pairs, nannies, 'sitters, double parked to pickup phone orders.\n\nBurritos and pizza are in a neck and neck competition for the Lacrosse Moms and Dads as post- practice nutrition, reward and celebration substance.\n\nTOMA is hungry for success. If you look at reviews on Yelp* over the past 7 months, notice how the criticism, possibly sound, has been matched by the staff in the food in front of you: it is improved at each step and turn.\n\nSomeone is reading these reviews and improving on a dime.", "author": "Jim N."}

My first burrito memories are from an LA food truck in the late seventies, where you could get a gut bomb burrito only slightly smaller than a jr. high football for $1.25.\n\nToma is quite good but the portions are smallish and the price is pricey.  At Los Hermanos which is cheaper, I usually had a decent size portion remaining for a snack.  At Toma, I usually ate the whole thing and was still a bit hungry.\n\nThe guys who own/run the place are awesome, and I wish I could justify a higher rating.

Did like their small salsa toppings bar and the corn taco itself had some good flavor.  Overall found it to be a too tiny portion with too little chicken and flavor underwhelming. \nSo take my review for what it is worth- I didn't splurge for the burrito, as everyone else was ordering, but this tiny taco wasn't worth the price or the annoying 25 minute take-out wait for 1 taco.  Pathetically I later found myself across the way filling up with more flavorful tacos at Taco Bell with a 2 minute wait and half the price.", "author": "Alexandra C."}

Everyone is extremely friendly and attentive.  \n\nFor the food, I would recommend the chicken burritos or tacos.  Those are my constant go-tos.  Squeeze some lime and put the mild red sauce on it and it just tastes delicious.  Also, if you like mushrooms or squash, both choices are excellent and very flavorful. I love mushrooms so sometimes I just get a mushroom burrito and some cantaloupe agua fresca and call it a day.  Speaking of their agua frescas, all the flavors I've ever tried are so so soo good.  Cantaloupe, watermelon, pineapple and the horchata are all amazing and pair perfectly with the food.  I definitely find myself craving the juices on those rare warm days in SF.\n\nThe other day I decided to try a chicken quesadilla with guacamole and sour cream and it was the best decision I made that week!  I love quesadillas with just cheese and chicken, but with the extras it was just unbelievably yummy.

The guy manning the grill proceeded to pull raw chicken out of the marinade bucket and put it on the grill, then use the same tongs to flip and remove the carne asada that was on the other side of the grill. He did this numerous times, potentially cross contaminating the meat that was being pulled off the grill. Dude, that's like cooking 101.  \n\nAfter witnessing this I went to the register to change my order to a quesadilla and side of chips and salsa. You can tell a lot about a Mexican place by their salsa bar.  TOMA's salsas were literally the most watered down and flavorless I've had in my life.

We tried the adobado, carne asada, pollo asado and mushroom tacos. All had excellent seasoning, killer soft, tasty corn tortilla and spot on pico de gallo.  We also split an adobado burrito as well and it was on par with the tacos. The tortilla was thin but chewy, which seems under executed at most places.  To top it all off, Izzy, one of the owners, was super polite and inviting. Good stuff. \n\nLong story short I'm not reaching far when I say that these are some of the best tacos on this side of the city and may keep us from wondering over to Tropisueno!

My first time there, I wasn't sure what to get.  She recommended the champinones (mushroom) and asada burrito and it was delicious!  \nDefinitely eat here!", "author": "Kristen M."}

I had the veggie burrito with added carne asada because I can't go on without meat so I was glad to hit all the food groups with my burrito. The carne asada is as good as everyone praises it to be, and I almost want to do just a carne asada without the veggies next time just because I want more steak! You can definitely taste the freshness here! Best part is, 10 bucks can get you a hefty lunch and some change for your meter.", "author": "annie w."}

The meat is perfectly seasoned, literally freshly chopped before your eyes, and sprinkled with fresh pico de gallo.  While the service isn't fast, I truly appreciate the fresh and home-made food.

I got the chicken burrito with an add of sour cream and chips that I used to test out the homemade salsas (the two hot sauces are HOT). The salsa verde was excellent and I added some of the chopped onions to it to make it a little chunkier and more scoopable. Paid approximately $11 for burrito/chips/coke. Not cheap but good value.

This tiny little Mexican restaurant in the Marina district serves food that is no less than deliciously crafted! Although it may not be the most \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant, it succeeds because it has created its own unique brand of American-Mexican fusion which is, at best, mouth-wateringly, makes-you-want-to-eat-the-whole-burrito-even-though-you-know-you-shouldn't-kind-of-delicious, and, at worst, a great place to get a burrito at 3am after your bar-hopping spree in the Marina.
