We walked over to Blooms Saloon on Wednesday, June 20th and arrived around 8pm.\n\nAfter having cocktails and whisky, I decided to switch it up to beer. Got a Stella Artois while my gf got a chardonnay. I believe it was a Joel Gott 2014. (Don't ask me how I know that. I honestly have no idea.) I paid for the first round, so from recollection, I think both drinks were $14. We ended up sitting down at a giant plush booth. Felt kind of like VIP status as I didn't see any other booths around. My gf ended up getting us a second round of the same drinks.\n\nVibe here is chill. Kinda divey, but in a huge space. It was dark where we were sitting, but I believe there's big windows in the back, so lots of light in that area of the bar. I think they have a back patio, but it seemed roped off that day, so we didn't explore.\n\nThe end of our time here was a little odd. When my gf came back after buying the second round, she asked me if I had any cash. When I asked why, she said the bartender seemed pissed we were ordering and paying by round instead of keeping a tab open. Maybe he was mad about the CC fees? It made us feel unwelcome, so we left after that second round.\n\nNice bar to just chill and drink. Too bad we had that weird experience with the bartender.", "author": "Elena N."}

He barely turned and grunted when trying to place our order. It was very apparent that he didn't want us there, but I grew up in this neighborhood and always wanted to give it a try, so we ordered a couple beers nevertheless. We drank them as fast as we could and left.\n\nThe place maybe had 4 other people there on a Thursday night so I don't understand why you would behave so rudely towards your few paying customers. As a kid, I saw Blooms as a cool neighborhood hangout, so I was very disappointed to feel unwelcome. Maybe as a young asian male, I didn't fit the profile of who would normally walk into this bar, but that really shouldn't matter. Or maybe the bartender was just in a bad mood. If your bartender is like this to everyone though, I'm surprised this place is still around.\n\nRegardless, I will NEVER be going back.

In short, you would think it's a great place to go with friends when you just want to have some beers and chill.\n\nA great place to get beer, that is, if you can get beer. As many reviewers have noted, the bartenders here suck suck suckity suck. On one night I went (after being here multiple times before, mind you) the bartender Nigel was totally drunk. When my friend asked him how a shot of whiskey cost, he got pissed off (I can only assume he misunderstood) and started yelling about how \"If you're going to have an attitude like that, you can leave.\" We tried to explain there must be a misunderstanding, and even a guy at the bar who had overheard the whole thing tried to calm Nigel down, but he had worked himself into quite a tizzy. We waited around a few minutes in the hopes he might calm down and listen to reason, but he just kept giving us stank-eye, tantrum-ing around, and occasionally saying something like \"that's right!\" to assert his dominance.\n\nIt sucks, because we'd been here at least four times and had made friends with some of the regulars who would play pool or darts.

W and I ended up at the local bar because the doors were wide open and quite inviting.  I miss hanging out in Portrero.......Farley's as well as Lingba.  *sigh*\n\nW proceeded to order drinks at the bar when my sight fell upon two pinball machines up along the back wall.  I enjoy pool too, but at the moment, a couple had taken dominance over it.\n\nThe bartender is loud, funny and quite animated.  Not to mention very communicative.  He gave me a double take when I ordered a whiskey sour, which was atrociously strong.  I mentioned to W that not only was I having this on an empty stomach, but the drink was very strong so he'd probably have to end up finishing it off.\n\nThe first machine ate our quarters.  The second machine was much more receptive, but I was so clumsy with the paddles, that the game ended within ten minutes.  That darn Lethal Weapon Pinball machine!\n\nThen, it was off to the golf machine that W had way more experience on.  I scored a +34 on an 18 hole game!  Woohoo!  So much for my being a hacker out on the real greens. UGH.\n\nI had much fun here!  Partly because I was a little dizzy on the strong drink and the bar was cool as were the locals, who shared in singing along to the Eurythmics at the counter.

We came in during a Warriors game and my boyfriend ordered himself a Lagunitas and me a diet coke (I was thirsty) and was given a Laguinitas and an Anchor Steam. My boyfriend explained it was a diet coke not an Anchor steam and the bartender said Well now you got an Anchor steam so pay up! A man at the bar tried to explain he heard Diet Coke too but the bartender just gave us some abuse about learning how to order drinks and made us pay for an extra beer anyways. I feel like anywhere else they would say oh sorry I misheard and we might even have just offered to pay anyways (we are British!) but he was so rude to us! Apparently we also ordered too slow we were told during his random rudeness about the mix up even though we would say one thing and he would just walk away from us, sooo kind of hard to order all at once like he seemed to want... If you had better more consistent service this would be a great bar. I am scared to go not sure if ending up here will ruin my night!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-10-04", "description": "Blooms is about two blocks from my house, where I've lived for almost four years, and I've only been inside it three times. \n\nThis is a sore spot for me. I like to drink and I'm inherently lazy, so my neighborhood bars tend to snag a lot of my money, even if they kind of suck. But Bloom's sucks a whole lot, to the extent that on the rare occasions I want to get totally, horribly hammered, I go somewhere else, despite the obvious advantages of having a less than 2 minute walk home. And I don't ask a lot of bars when I want to do some serious drinking.\n\nThis place is sort of sad. Not to be all emotion-y, but it reminds me of some of my least favorite memories of the 'rents. It's full of people about the age that my father will always be, rocking out on their own to The Eagles and drunkenly discussing the comparative merits of bands whose times came and went before I snuck out the side of a condom and found me an egg. They \"dance\" to 70's rock, and by dance I mean grimace and air-guitar. Singularly depressing, a pocket of the crap atmospheres I left behind in Texas popped up in the middle of my granola-liberal SF dream.\n\nMy S.O. and I got yelled at for ordering an Irish Carbomb here. Are. You. Kidding. If there was a drink that efficient and tasty called the Jewish Occupation, I'd be actively encouraging my goyim friends to drink it. Sadly, all my people have is Passover wine, which tastes like a hangover. Better we should have carbombs, nu? But I digress.\n\nThe important thing to note here is that Bloom's sucks, which is sadder than saying that Random Sports Bar sucks because it continues to have this potential (right near me, not a sports bar, pool table, usually not too packed, poor lighting, contains alcohol) that it absolutely refuses to live up to. \n\n(Interesting anecdote: my S.O. recently discovered Craig's List Personals, specifically the erotic services section. She was looking up the Potrero Hill options, and kept calling me over- \"Hey! That chick's always standing outside Bloom's! And so's that one!\" And it was true.) \n\nYou know what? I hate how negative this review is. I bet Bloom's has some totally positive aspects, like it's really well retrofitted or it used to have a detective agency on the top floor or something. Maybe it kicks ass on, like, Wednesdays around 11 am. A wise friend of mine once told me that you become what you hate, and he's right. I'm heading over to Bloom's right goddamned now for a beer, and I'm going to try as hard as I can to completely enjoy every minute of it. In fact, because I know I'm going to have such an amazingly positive bar experience, I'm going to go ahead and preemptively tack on a second star.", "author": "jason l."}

Bloom's is a treasure for people who know how to drink and for people who appreciate what a real watering hole is.  I went here recently with a SFPD veteran who introduced me to the regulars.  Let's start with the bartender: Rico.\n\nFirst of all Rico rocks.  He gave us two rounds free and then slammed down a bunch of whiskey shots with us.  Rico served in the Marines, and he has his priorities straight.  He understands what makes this city tick, but he also understands that what makes this city tick is not what makes this city run.  He likes people who make the city run: cops, DPW workers, bus drivers, custodians, and ex-Marines.  You should too.  If you don't, then go back to whining and work on your macrame messenger bag.  Rico hates your appletini drinking ass.  \n\nThe booze here is good solid booze: beer, whiskey, bourbon, and gin.  If you order a cocktail  make sure it is one of the old standbys.  Otherwise you deserve to be thrown off the back patio.  (Which has amazing views.)  There are no flavored vodkas here.  If you order a martini, it will be gin...because that's what is a martini is.  (This whole vodka thing is new...and it sucks.)  \n\nAs for the rest of the regulars, I won't say much more than they may be old and crotchtey because they have been dealing with unappreciative hippy wannabes for their entire careers.  For you neighborhood reviewers who complain about them, try buying them a beer and thanking them for making sacrifices and putting themselves in danger every time they went to work for thirty years.  I did.  You know what?  They were nice and thanked me for it.  \n\nGo to Bloom's.  Buy copious amounts of booze.  Tip Rico well.  He deserves it.", "author": "Chris I."}

That was the last time I was there. I was back in town a few months ago and met my attorney at his Portrero office. We decided to pop into Blooms for a cold one or 12. Lo and behold I walk in and there is Thaddeus and Amil sitting in the same spot like they had never left.\nGood Times, lots of bourbon soaked tales of Vegas strip clubs, nightclubs and various shenanigans involving midgets and fire engines and of course strippers. Oh hell I'll give Blooms four stars for pouring mean shots.", "author": "Bill H."}

Usually I don't go to local bars where I don't know because they are not welcome to strangers. but this time I was curious to check out this lovely old style Potrero hill bar so I went inside to check it out for later on.\nThe bartender was very professional and didn't let me leave the bar thirsty. He asked me to join him and the other guy who was drinking with him at the bar. He gave me a shot and asked me what I wanted to drink. what ever you recommend I answered. He started me  with a shot of Irish whiskey and then gave me a pint of  Anchor!\nThat was great: great bartender, sunny SF, san franciscan beer and great old music at the time I did'nt intend to drink!\none more, two mores! I was getting tipsy with an empty stomach. \nThe music, ambiance and decoration was great. \nThe bartender who made my day ( Marak )  was very friendly with a great sense of humor,\nTry this place as soon as you can if you are looking for an authentic local PUB!", "author": "Mahyar M."}

They talk about the view of downtown from this place being great. Unfortunately I was treated to a different view, that of a harry white ass that mooned another guy at the bar for flirting with his girl. I think this should automatically disqualify this place for anything over 3 stars, and that's being nice since I really want to like this place for the sake of Potrero Hill.\n\nI'll come back next '9ers season and give it another chance.", "author": "C P."}

Blooms embodies the definition of a neighborhood bar. We seriously might as well had a sign that said 'Not Regulars' and carried it around.

Great view of the city, friendly service.  A really nice spot to have a beer and catch up with a friend.  Pool table and darks, a juke-box that occasionally plays some classic hits that make all the drunk folks sing at the top of their lungs.

It does't really have much atmosphere though, and it's always REALLY COLD in there, which sort contributes to a slightly sad vibe.
