When it comes down to it, gyros places often seem like a dime a dozen. And in many cases, they are. But Ayola delivers something above the average gyros joint. \n\nMy normal go-to here is the greek salad with gyros meat (sometimes shawarma chicken) on top. The lettuce is fresh, the dressing is tasty, and the meat portion is generous. It's an easy keto meal for my lunchtime needs. I just skip the bread that comes with it, and I add in some of their house hot sauce, which is delicious (and if it's not made in house, someone tell me where I can buy it!). \n\nService is crazy quick during the lunchtime rush.

The service is super quick and it's super convenient for lunch on the go.\n\nThe restaurant is fairly easy to locate but fair warning: it's tiny! Don't anticipate dining in. There are two stools and a tiny counter table probably mostly used for waiting. Probably why they always wrap things to go is because there's no seating really. I really wished they did have some seating options!\n\nI've always gotten their chicken gyros and I stopped by again today and it's still yummy and how I remembered it 2 years ago now so they're doing great on consistency. They cook and spice their chicken so well. The meat is not dry at all, it's super tender. The tzatziki sauce works perfectly with the chicken and the whole experience was not just one note. The pita added a good warmth that balanced the coolness of the tzatziki and the chicken just works well to give the gyro body. \n\nI've also tried their lam gyro, fries and falafel+dolmas and their all pretty well made standard Mediterranean fare but the chicken gyro totally blows my mind so would highly recommend!\n\nMake sure you get the red sauce from the counter!!

I ordered a salad and a piece of baklava. Ok, I know I was just complaining about eating like trash while traveling, but I'm also not insane. If an authentic Greek place has baklava on the menu, of course, I have to order it. Research. You know?\n\nWhoa, baby, my salad was so large, I couldn't even finish it. In most cases, a salad is just a salad, so nothing super memorable about it, and I got the veggies I was hoping for. The baklava hit the spot, too, and I didn't even feel bad after.

I'm big on Mediterranean food and find myself always itching for some lamb- I'm surprised I never felt inclined to visit this place as it is just a block away from my office. I tried the food today for the first time and I regret not ever coming here to satisfy my gyro craving! My first impression of this place was that it was a typical-looking Mediterranean place right next to work, with a typical menu. Nothing too fancy. The place is very casual. The cashier was super friendly and the service was quick. I didn't wait very long for my order. Perfect for a quick bite.\n\nI ordered the gyro (lamb and beef), a chicken gyro (for my brother), and the fries, which they claim to be the best fries in town. So I paid around 22 bucks for two 7-inch gyros and an order of fries- not too bad. You could get an 9-inch gyro for a dollar more. The lamb and beef gyro was dee-lish! The meat was well-flavored but not overly salty, which when too salty, tends to take away from the meat's natural flavors. The lettuce was crunchy and fresh, unlike other places with sad and droopy lettuce (probably because they use romaine rather than the typical iceberg). I really enjoyed the tzatziki sauce they had. But I really enjoyed the hot sauce, which had a subtle tint of oregano....? Whatever it was, the flavor went really well with my gyro. \n\nI'm a fan of fries and I don't know about you, but I'm all about firm, crispy fries. You know, the kind that hold their shape and don't end up soggy after ten minutes? You want crispy fries? Ayola's got them. The fries were nice and firm, they kept their form throughout my entire lunch period, and were really mealy on the inside. The fries weren't seasoned very much, so they weren't too salty, but I like my fries that way. \n\nI basically just found my new gyro joint.

They also have a rice bowl combo which I'm not a big fan of.

I've gotten delivery from Ayola several times through DoorDash and usually bounce back and forth between either the chicken shawarma or a combo platter. \n\nRecommend: \nCHICKEN SHAWARMA is offered in either 7\" or 9\". I always get the 7\" but I also spring for the fries + soda combo. The fries are crispy outside and soft on the inside. I usually can't finish the whole meal because of the fries so I would save half of the shawarma for a late afternoon snack. Yay! Be forewarned that it gets messy eating this since they don't skimp on the chicken so have a fork or fingers ready to pick up the aftermath of your chicken falling off your shawarma. \n\nCOMBO PLATTER is a great way to get a bunch of sides as samplers. I think they have a set combo platter that has: hummus, dolmas, eggplant salad, falafel, and tzatziki sauce. AND it comes with pita bread. I also believe there is baba ganoush in the combo but it isn't listed on the menu. Really good deal if you're too indecisive to pick and choose items. It's also a great value since there's at least 5 items. After trying the combo once, on my second time, I decided to do a choose my own 4-item platter to try out the spanakopita, tabouleh salad, baklava, and falafel (again!). \n\nReviewing the sides alone (from most favorite to least):\n-Baklava: Delicious dessert that is flaky on top and sweet in the middle. \n-Spanakopita: Very flaky pastry with a savory spinach filling.\n-Falafel: Excellent. Crispy outside and flavorful inside. I like to dip it in the tzatziki sauce.\n-Baba ganoush: Slightly smoky flavor. Good to eat on its own.\n-Dolmas: I like the inside filling but the outside had a tad too much lemon juice. \n-Eggplant salad: Alright. Only enjoyed the eggplant. \n-Hummus: Average. But to be fair, I was full from the rest of the combo platter.  \n-Tabouleh salad: Tasted rather plain to me but if you love parsley, then it's your salad.", "author": "Diana C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-21", "description": "Ayola adds a little variety to the neighborhood with Mediterranean dishes - falafel, Greek salads, hummus, tzatziki, and so on. This little Greek spot is essentially the size of a takeout counter. There are only a few seats by the window, but there are public parklets nearby for you to enjoy your lunch. \n\nI usually order a gyro or a shawarma. I'm still not quite clear what is the difference between the two. Hopefully someone will clearly explain it to me one day, but everyone seems to have a slightly different explanation of each. \n\nGyros & Shawarmas are about $8 for 7 inches, and $9 for 9 inches. It is a marginal difference, but the extra dollar is worth the extra 2 inches. I typically order the 7 inch. I once ordered the 9 inch, hoping to eat half and save the rest for later, but ended up devouring the entire sandwich.\nThe shaved gyro meat of lamb & beef are tasty and have good flavor. I couldn't tell the difference between lamb & beef, but I took that as a good sign, since I couldn't detect any gamey taste. \nThe chicken gyro is quite good too. The chicken shawarma, as far as I can tell, is made with roasted chicken instead. The lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, & red onions taste very fresh and crisp. I usually request it without red onions, but sometimes they forget to take them out. Their tzatziki is creamy, yet refreshing. I've tried to make my own tzatziki and it was okay, but of course, not as good as theirs. The best part is the warm, soft, thick pita bread. \n\nTheir fries are delicious as well. I'm not even a big fan of fries, but I can appreciate that they're served hot and seasoned well. They're more of a thick cut with a slightly mushy center. \nThey even have containers of sauces right on the counter, so you can help yourself without having to pump your own sauce. \n\nThe office ordered catering for a meeting once, so I decided to take the opportunity to try all the things I was curious to try. (Speaking of boring meetings, does it bother anyone else to see people show up to take their order & give a rushed, 'Sorry so busy, I can't stay.' Right, yet not too busy for free food.) \nAnyways, I opted for the 4-Item Combo Platter with pita for $10.75. \nI chose Dolmas, Tzatziki, Hummus & Baklava, and added Gyro Meat for $3. \nI slathered some tart hummus on the pita bread. Not bad. \nThen I dunked the pita into the tzatziki and sandwiched it with some gyro meat. Pretty good.\nThe dolmas were too tart for me. I've always been curious to try stuffed grape leaves. I wasn't quite sure what they were filled with, but I was expecting them to be more salty than sour. \nSurprisingly it was more food than I could finish, so I ate the leftovers for a snack later that day.\n\nI was most looking forward to trying the baklava. The sweet layers of crunchy pastry & sweet, crushed walnut filling with some pistachio dust on top was so good. I actually took it home to share with Mr. Joy, who has a slight walnut allergy, but he didn't have a reaction to it. For an extra $2, this is a pretty good way to satisfy a sweet tooth. \n\nThere is usually a line around lunchtime, but there are lines everywhere at noon. Their line actually appears long because they have limited space, so it's not unusual to see people lining out the door, but the service is actually pretty quick. I'll stick to the gyros, but it'll be pretty hard to resist the baklava going forward.", "author": "Joy W."}

Unfortunately, after I made it back to my hotel I found that the salad didn't make it into my bag but the good news is, the chicken and rice soup made up for it. I believe they used the same meat from their chicken shawarma in the soup which really boosted the flavor along with the celery and carrots. This is certainly a go-to soup if you're feeling under the weather. The staff was super friendly and handled their lunchtime crowd with ease.

Yup.\nJust be warned, the handhelds are messy, so make sure you have lots of napkins when consuming!\n\nThe spot is strictly take-out, but there's a park nearby where you can enjoy your food when the weather permits, or just take it back to the office like I did. I highly suggest you order your food ahead of time as the line tends to wrap outside the small eatery right around. Eat24 lets you choose, pay and tip all in a quick transaction with your food being ready for pick-up a short time after. Super convenient.\n\nBack to the gyro. It comes in two sizes, 7\" or 9\". The first time around I went for the smaller portion and regretted my decision quickly after. It's filled with lettuce, tzatziki sauce and a nice heap of tender chicken and surrounded by a giant piece of pita bread and served in a piece of foil. Because they don't skimp, once you take your initial bite, things begin to fall out if you're not careful. This is not a bad thing, but just have a fork nearby to pick up the remnants or you'll look like a caveman scooping up leftovers with your fingers. I did just that in front of my co-workers, but couldn't let anything go to waste.\n\nIf chicken isn't your things, they have a beef, lamb, vegetarian and eggplant versions available for the choosing as well.

That finally gave me an excuse to try Ayola next to the Pac Bell building on New Montgomery. It's such a tiny place that I didn't think it could possibly be worth the wait. But this week, I simply walked in, ordered and even sat down at the one and only table to eat it because no one else came in. I had the 9-inch Lamb & Beef Gyros Sandwich for $7.35 (see photo).\n\nWhile I'm not preoccupied with size except when I'm looking in the rear view mirror where objects appear larger than they appear, I figured the dollar premium was worth the extra two inches. It was quite tasty with the pita quite thick and soft, the tzatziki sauce refreshing, and the meat flavorful enough even if I couldn't tell the beef from the lamb. For another $2.50, you can get a can of soda and a bag of fries. I'm not sure why they give you so many fries, piping hot and very thick, but if you need your starch, by all means, go for it.

I know shwarma to be heavily seasoned spit rotisseried meat (typically lamb or beef) shaved and griddled briefly before going into a pita. Ayola's menu describes it as roasted chicken with sumac and tzaziki, not traditional but sounds good, And what ended up in the sandwich was baked/poached chicken, with a light dusting of seasoning and a bland yogurt sauce. The saving grace was the home made spicy sauce you take with you. It was the only thing with flavor. Along side of the sandwich I ordered fries and dolmades (grape leaves). The fries were under done, and the dolmades were garden variety and served with the same bland tzaziki. \n\nAfter this meal, it was clear the line out the door was because of the fast and friendly service.

Not only is it close to work, but regardless of the line, you're never inside this place for more than a minute or so. You tell them what you want. You sign the receipt. Two seconds later the food's in your hands. Too easy.\n\nAs far as the food itself, I've only had the falafel wrap and fries, but both are pretty good. Maybe a little pricey, but even though the wrap seems small, it fills you up. And if you're really ambitious, you can try the 9 inch wrap (as opposed to 7 inch), and that for certain you will not finish.\n\nAll in all, this place is a pretty solid catch. I'm a big falafel guy, so you know this place is one of my top snacky spots. I'll probably go there a couple times next week.", "author": "Sahil P."}

The meat is not overly salty although I do with it could be a little warmer than room-temp when it's served.

Ten bucks will get you a can of soda or a bottle of water, a 7 inch pita sandwich with lamb and beef gyro meat with lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and tzatziki sauce, and also an order of fries.

I came in for late lunch and went out fulfilled. Had the regular Falafel, that included lamb. I asked for the McD treatment - fries and coke. cheesy? Yes, okay...\n\nThe order came out to a reasonable 10.50 in my mind. I was pumped about eating some lamb. The food came out in minutes and there were a number of people ordering. Great service! When I got down to scarfing down the falafel, it was slightly on the dry side but that's okay the flavor was still there. It felt like it needed some of that good ol' East Side Pocket sauce. Sorry! I would still come here anyway. \n\nThe one thing you have to know about this place is the taste of their fries. It was as if you were to order fries from Burger King and asked them to make them physically larger. That potato is so moist on the inside and it's just perfectly crisped on the outside.

I kept lifting my fork and that piece of hair just kept getting longer and longer. Absolutely disgusting. Shouldn't all employees be required to wear hair nets or tie back long hair? I'm not sure which employee it belonged to, but I stopped eating here after that. \n\nAnd that was the last time I ever went to Ayola.\n\nTry the other location if you must.", "author": "Kari G."}

Both are so good that I never seem to be able to try any of the other options.\n\nThe wrap comes with a spicy or mild option; I always get the spicy.

A friend and I decided to give it a shot - with indoor seating and lunch under $10, why not. \n\nI ordered a 2 item combo platter with gyro meat and spanakopita (flaky pastry stuffed with satueed spinach.) The place is small so a friend and I sat in the corner so as not to feel the cold air or be in anyone's way. My food came out fast, the spanakopita was already pre-made - not sure if they made it that morning or the previous night - but it was soft and soggy. I usually like it to have a crisp, but the inside flavor was pretty good.\n\nAs for the gyro meat, it was really salty, so I was only able to finish about half of my meat. I didn't hate the place and salty meat might be fine for some people, so I gave it an A-OK rating, especially since their staff is so nice,  though I won't be going back.", "author": "Analisa S."}

The gyro was salty inside and soft outside but wasn't explosions in my mouth by any stretch. Same with the dry falafal and hot fries.

Amazing Greek fast food for San Francisco, especially in the FiDi.  Generous portions to make you feel the Big Fat Greek Love.  \n\nGryo Meat: Every slice I enjoyed had a bit of spit seared exterior.  The lamb and beef mixture was well spiced and not too fatty.  Just fatty enough though to make an awesome pairing with the cooling tzatziki!  Could have been a tad warmer, but I appreciate that they didn't refry it.\n\nSpanakopita: Extremely flaky multi-layered exterior that is not at all greasy (unlike lower grade versions that are glistening on the bottom).  The spinach inside is well saut\u00e9ed so it is not bitter.  Could stand to use a bit more feta.\n\nFalafel: I like that the outside was not hard like a rock.  Lightly crispy with a very spice rich soft interior.  Shockingly not dry like most falafels in town!\n\nHummus: A good grainy blended texture that is not too heavy on the tahini.  They put some sort of green pepper pesto on top that adds an awesome kick and helps break the hummus monotony!\n\nTzatziki: Super creamy, almost like eating cheese (in a good way)!  Thankfully they relied more on subtle dill than overwhelming garlic to dominate the flavor.\n\nDolmas: Usually not a favorite of mine because the leaf wrap is often too bitter.  They did a good job of balancing the flavor better, though still best for me when doused in tzatziki.\n\nPita: Definitely not your Safeway store bought variety that invades so many Middle Eastern joints.  The edges were somewhat crispy... either freshly made or at least freshly reheated.\n\nHot Sauce: It's free and I abuse it.  It's somewhere between a spicy marinara and smoky pepper sauce.

I think it could have used more tzatziki sauce, but maybe next time I will ask for it on the side. The pita was very good- fluffy and fresh. \n\nI thought the \"hot sauce\" tasted like vinegar or soap or something. I really didn't like it all. \n\nBut I will go back.

However, we managed to claim a wee corner in which to yearn pitifully for, and then devour, our lunchly items.  The staff were friendly and patient while we scanned the menu and placed our order.  I chose the falafel wrap and fries and my companion ordered a gyro (beef? lamb? I dunno, I have amnesia) and fries.  Holy chrizzlesticks, my wrap was magnificent in its scrumptiousness!  The heavens parted upon this midday hour and plunked forth a plethora of crispy, warm, and flavorful falafel patties into an otherworldly cocoon of tomato, lettuce, tangy hummus, and soft pita.  All of which I couldn't stop ramming into my mouth-hole repeatedly and with great force.  The fries?  Sweet deity on a stick!  Tantalizingly crunchy (twice fried to perfection) and spiced with a delicate, peppery zip.

While eggplant is one of my personal favorites, it can be a more challenging vegetable to find on menus. I stopped in Ayola immediately after spying the eggplant salad on the menu. The restaurant smelled delicious and was very quick with my take-out order.  Unfortunately, I ended up disliking the eggplant salad because it had an odd flavor. I gobbled up the feta on top of the salad, but was severely disappointed with the odd sauce on the eggplant. It was supposed to be olive oil, but it is difficult to describe the peculiar taste that angered my taste buds. I also wish the eggplant was cooked a bit more to be softer as it was too chewy. The saving grace was their hot, grilled pita. Oh my goodness. This perfectly cooked, buttery pita almost melted in my mouth. It has the delicious chewy texture of something fresh out of the oven and was spices accentuated the pita's natural taste. I would actually be willing to try Ayola again and order one of the dips.

I think the Chicken Shawarma is a little taste of heaven on earth! \n\nBecause tons of new places have been opening up in the 2nd street area over past few years, the downtown SF lunch culture has exploded in SOMA. As a direct result, I have slowly become a gourmet salad snob (disclaimer - it's not my fault). So when a coworker suggested we check out the Greek Salad at this place that I've walked past a countless number of times, I was a little apprehensive. That said, I thought it was an inexpensive, filling, and pretty darn good salad overall. And to be honest, it was a really nice change of pace from all those $10 downtown salads that come with \"fancy dressings\" and are dressed up like a drag queen on a Saturday night.\n\nBut the real love story for me began in August of 2007 when I had a craving for something delicious, healthy, and filling. But I didn't feel like having anything that was too heavy. My brain said I should try a falafel, so I popped my head back into Ayola and read the menu. Standing there I thought, \"Wait, hummus and some kind of fancy sauce? That's not what I want. I need something with chicken that is light and refreshing.\" \n\nSo I asked the girls behind the counter. They were extremely nice and accommodating and suggested the Chicken Shawarma. They didn't even make me feel like an idiot for not noticing it on the menu (which I really appreciated). After they explained all the ingredients to me (Grilled Chicken Breast, Cucumbers, and Tahini Sauce in a Pita), I remembered that I've had this before in the past and that it sounded perfect! Plus it was only $7 for the large 9\" wrap. So I said, \"No hot sauce for me please\", and the order was placed...\n\nWithin minutes I was walking back to my desk and soon unwrapped this glorious masterpiece. Embarrassingly I found myself eating it like a rabid dog. The delicious mix of cucumbers, real grilled chicken, and the light tahini sauce put me in a state of ecstasy. The next day I found myself ordering the same exact thing for lunch. And today, three days later, I'm writing a review of Ayola from home because I really want another one for lunch. But because I live by Japan Town and the Fillmore theater, Ayola is a little too far away for me to travel. = (\n\nI honestly can't wait to get back to SOMA where I work so I can taste that little bit of heaven once again. I'm also hoping I can find a comparable Mediterranean take out place in the Fillmore area today. But until I can get back to Ayola, I'll have to put on my sad puppy face.", "author": "George L."}

Not too dried out & flakey (a common problem with SF falafel sandwiches, it seems). Not too chewy. Just thinking about it makes me nostalgic for my years in SF (as I wipe up the drool from my chin).\n\nOh, and the fries are money. Far better than most places.

You look at the clock - by Jove, it's actually a reasonable hour for lunch!  You grab your coat, run out of the building, reach the street, and stop.  Now you must make a decision.  You could eat at Trendy Sandwich Shop No. 1, but you're not feeling particularly ritzy.  There's Salads'R'Us, but no - you need something heartier.  Perhaps you find yourself drifting down New Montgomery as you churn these thoughts over in your mind, heading towards no goal in particular, and then it hits you.  Like, really hard.  What is that smell?!  It smells like meat-and-spice-and-warm-and-hotsauce!  With...yes!  With a hint of fry!!  Yep.  Ayola just hit you.  And it felt like a kiss.  Or the preamble to a gyro.  Or maybe both.\n\nAs all of my legions of followers know, I recently professed a somewhat inappropriate passion for Baladie in the Financial District.  If Baladie is my pool boy, Ayola is the husband to whom I return, time and time again.  Why?  No, it's not a lifetime of codependency brought on by latent psychological issues.  It's because, goshdarnit, Ayola is a really solid place to get a mouthwatering and satisfying Greek meal.\n\nThe menu is rather small, as I've found is typical of Greek and Mediterranean places, featuring all of the familiar players - gyros, falafel, shawarma, Greek salads, hummus, dolmades, etc.  But they are expanding their menu - they've recently started making baba ganoush, and I can tell you it's really quite good!  I'm pretty sure they put olives into it and, if you're into that sort of thing it makes for a really nice variation on a classic dip.\n\nEven with a limited menu, you can trust that Ayola is going to take the classics and do them up right.  My favorite is the hortopita, and if you love eggplant like I love eggplant, it'll be your favorite, too.  The eggplant is cool, but melts in your mouth.  The toppings enhance it, without overshadowing it.  I could have probably done with more feta today, but I understand that the eggplant must remain the star of the show - and that being said, the ingredients all worked together in perfect harmony!  The pita wrapper was soft and fragrant and nice and toasty warm, and it was handed to me mere minutes after I ordered, even in the middle of the lunchtime rush!  \n\nSpecial mention also goes out to the dolmades.  Those things are like candy to me, and Ayola's are beautifully soft and chewy without swimming in oil.  No, instead, you can have them swim in the tub of tzatziki you get with them.  And if you're really on a budget, get the veggie combo plate.  You can probably share it with someone, but if you don't you'll have some killer leftovers!\n\nFor extra ambiance points, see if you can get a seat and wedge yourself onto a barstool in the corner.  It's crowded and not the comfiest seating of your life, but I feel it merely adds to the experience.  And plus, it sure beats taking the food back to your desk!\n\nSo if you're ever in SOMA and you need some really reliably awesome Greek food, Ayola is your place.  It never judges, it never expects too much of you, and it will always welcome you back with open arms.  But not open hands.  Its hands are full of falafel that it's going to stuff into your open and waiting mouth.  Boo.  Yah.", "author": "Becca S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-29", "description": "I wasn't in the mood for any S-foods (sandwich, soup, salad) during the day at work. I asked one of my co-workers for alternatives with a good value, and he suggested \"some place down on New Montgomery that sells falafel\". When he mentioned falafel, I realized I hadn't had a falafel in ages, so I set out on my quest to find this eatery with supposedly no name.\n\nLo and behold, upon approaching the destination, I saw that I was in fact going to Ayola, which I'd seen before on Kearny as well. I had heard good things about Ayola on Kearny, but didn't get a chance to stop by that branch on days after work since it closes by 5pm. The New Montgomery location stays open until 6pm though, so that's a good thing to keep in mind the next time I'm hunting for non-typical food in the Financial District...\n\nThis shop is small, a little cramped, but cute. The menu consists of mostly pita sandwiches and salads (served with pita). The sandwiches come in two sizes, 7-inch or 9-inch. I went with the smaller size since I figured it would still fill me up. Combo platters and party trays are also available for those who need variety or have office lunch gatherings, respectively. Everything is Greek or Mediterranean on the menu with the exception of french fries, which I find a little odd to be included on the menu (it's also the only \"junk\" food on the mostly-healthy menu).\n\nService was lightning-speed fast; I took some time in making my decision on the falafel sandwich (well, I couldn't decide the size at first, and I couldn't decide if I really wanted to tack on fries with the order or not), but the cashier rang me up really quickly and the falafel was already out and ready before I could put my change back into my wallet. The workers must have thought I was a little strange for not hearing my order number at first, but I really thought they were calling out someone else's number until I looked down at my own receipt. Oops.\n\nI was impressed with how much fresh vegetables they topped the falafel sandwich with; vegetables were the first thing I saw when I unwrapped my meal. The pita was soft and warm, and the falafel  itself was chewy and had the right amount of flavor. I requested for hot sauce, but it was only noticeable near the end of the wrap, which was slightly disappointing. Overall, though, the sandwich was still delicious.\n\nPrices are reasonable considering it's not every day (or everywhere) I can find Greek/Mediterranean food. For a small sandwich, the cost is $5.95; for a large, it's only a dollar more. The salads range from $5.95-$7.95, depending on the complexity of the ingredients involved. I'm not entirely sure of the value of the salads since I didn't look around at other customers' meals. There are also sides ranging from $1.50 to $4.75.\n\nI'll be heading to the Kearny Street location next to check out the consistency of the food, service, price, etc. I have to say, though, I am indeed a fan of Ayola as of this past week.", "author": "Helene K."}

This is by far the worst attempt at chicken shwarma I have ever seen or experienced. The chicken looks and tastes like the refrigerated chicken strips you can get at Safeway that are flavorless and mushy. It's DRENCHED in tzatziki sauce, which is awful. The lettuce and tomatoes look and taste like they are from yesterday... maybe the day before yesterday? Honestly, I took two bites, opened this thing up, and looked inside... tried to pick at the chicken, tried to pick at the tomatoes and got actually SCARED of eating it. I don't think this is fresh AT ALL. The pita itself is chewy, which normally happens when it's old... I just spend 7 of my hard earned dollars on this and am so so disappointed. I am also MISERABLE because I was starving by the time I got here and back to my office to finally eat lunch... and NOW I can't even FORCE myself to eat this... I LOVE Mediterranean food and have eaten Shwarma - greek style and middle eastern style - many times and in many countries. THIS weird refrigerator \"grilled\" chicken drenched in sauce with stale lettuce and tomatoes is NOT shwarma by any definition. I really wish I worked closer or had the time to take this thing back and ask for my money back or to try something else... now I am hungry AND super disappointed.

Not possible. One bite of the falafel and I wolfed it down so fast that my tummy now aches from being too full. I wish they put more hummus in the sandwich though. Also, I didn't care too much for the pita bread, which was just standard and not spectacular. Next time, I think I'll get falafel (4 pieces for $3.50) and hummus (1/2 pint served with pita for $3.50).\r\n\r\nUPDATE 7/13/06: I am changing my review from 3 stars to 4 stars. The reason is I have since tried their sparta (greek salad with grilled chicken and pita bread) and it is fucking fantabulous. Yes, it so freakin' good. One of the best salads I have ever had in my life. And usually, I skip the dressing because I am very picky about it. My god! I wanted to drink the salad dressing. Delicious! Get your booty down here and try it. With tax, it is a little expensive at $7.54 but it tastes so good that I think it's worth it once or twice a week.

They're fine and all, though the schawarma sandwiches are drenched in a watery sauce that will spill on you if you're not careful (and will also leak through your bag if you're getting take out). At $7-ish for a large sandwich, this place isn't an amazing value either. \n\nI also don't understand the raving about the french fries. The salt and pepper is nice, but they don't always consistently turn out as perfectly as some of these reviews claim.\n\nIf you happen to be working or walking by the Academy of Art, you have a lot of lunch choices, and while it's not bad, it's not amazing either. I'll stop by there every once in a while for a change of pace, but that New Montgomery corridor alone has a Chipotle, a cafe that serves sandwiches, Lee's (which has sandwiches and a Chinese food buffet and salad bar), Jamba Juice, and The Sentinel sandwiches just up the street.", "author": "A P."}

I say Greekish because it's a fast food restaurant, so it's as Greek as Chipotle is Mexican. But a delicious hint of a foreign land I highly recommend. \n\nThe food is hot and fresh, and wait time is maximum 5 minutes, even at lunch rush. After eating there half a dozen times, I decided to try the calamari salad (I was a little wary of eating squid from a small cafe), and was not disappointed. The squid is fresh and well seasoned, so just imagine how good the more popular foods are.\n\nGyros are top notch, and remind me of the delicious donairs of Canada. The meat is juicy, not tough, and not overly salty. When I leave my office for lunch, this is the first thing I smell, and most of the time I don't make it past their doors. \n\nLike a lot of eateries in downtown San Francisco, this place is packed during lunch time, with seating for maybe 10 people, while about another 20 wait in line or for their food. Not a place to expect to sit and enjoy peaceful lunches. \n\nA couple negatives: If you get something with a salad as a side, you get two olives in it (every time, two olives). More olives would be nice. On occasion, the pita triangles are a bit stale around the edges, I think they might give the day-olds as complementary additions to meals to get rid of them. It's also a little pricey, considering the quantity of food you can get for less money right next door at Chipotle or Lee's. You'll be spending a dollar extra.", "author": "Paul H."}

I ordered the chicken shawarma meal - which left me with a full belly and a smile. Sadly I had to leave some of my fries uneaten - they really are as good as everyone says!", "author": "Rachelle A."}

It was meh. The chicken was pretty flavorless. My girlfriend had the falafel wrap, it was meh too. Both have nothing on Truly Mediterranean in the mission.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-05-09", "description": "After my initial excitement that a new lunch place had opened up near the office had died down, I realized that Ayola is completely mediocre and not worth patronizing. The lamb gyros is dry, the chicken gyros is completely over processed, and the falafel is drier than the lamb gyros. Also, what's up with the sandwiches not being in the pita pocket? They're made of a dry (anyone notice a trend?) piece of pita wrapped around your choice of filling, plus some lettuce and some bad tzatziki. I'd rather eat across the street at Cafe Madeleine for the millionth time than have lunch from here.", "author": "Jon L."}

The falafel sandwich is good, comes in a pita like you'd get in NYC (except $6 rather than $3). I got the 7\" and it's just falafel, lettuce, hummus and sauce, no tomato even, but still hearty. This is unlike say Saffron and Truly Med where they use lavash and create a giant wrap packed with veggies, french fries, etc to rival a burrito. Not sure if that's more what the 9\" version is like here? Also on the pros side their red sauce and fries are awesome. Service was incredibly fast, and friendly. I'd eat here again.", "author": "Dave M."}

I usually get sick of things if I eat them all the time but I honestly think I could eat their chicken gyro, every day, for the rest of my life. Every ingredient has unbelievable flavor, especially the tzatziki (yogurt sauce). Not to mention their spanikopita and AMAZING falafel. And yes, even though I tend to avoid fries, they really are perfection. Service is great.. this is much more of a takeout place as there is limited seating.  \n\nIt's possible that I go here 4 times a week.  My coworkers definitely think I am OCD about this place.", "author": "Rachel M."}
