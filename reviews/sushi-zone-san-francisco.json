I've had lots of sushi in my life and, to this day, Sushi Zone is consistently my favorite. \n\nYes, you'll need to wait if you get there past 7 and yes it's a small/hole in the wall type place (so don't go with more than 4 people). But it will be better/cheaper than any Michelin start restaurant out there. \n\nI've been here over 30 times since 2010 and have always had a consistently amazing experience. The people that work here are so genuinely nice and take great pride in their work. \n\nI recommend getting the Salmon and Tuna Nigiri. Some of the freshest fish you can get in SF, it melts in your mouth.

I actually found the sashimi combo plate quite a decent deal despite the high initial price tag as it came with 14 decent cuts of fish. Ordering nigiri sushi runs you $7-8 per order, at two pieces per order. The rolls are also quite decently priced at about $10-11 each; I enjoyed the king California roll (real crab, avocado, cucumber, fish eggs). They also have goopy apps that will delight gringo tastes, in particular the baked mussels, which come drenched with spicy mayo. \n\nService is matter-of-fact and to the point, while the venue feels like a former diner. All in all, it's about the food here, and it doesn't disappoint. A nice find thanks to all you Yelpers out there!", "author": "Vincent L."}

Just make sure you're not running on a tight schedule since you will probably be waiting a long while to sit, and a long while longer for your food (there is only one sushi chef). I think we actually waited close to an hour before we were able to eat.\n\nHowever, my friend and I were both very impressed by how fresh the fish was. This is no doubt some great quality sushi. I'd recommend the sashimi or Chef's choice combo platters if you have the money to spend, but it seems like the most popular items to order are the maki rolls. My friend and I ordered a tuna and yellowtail maki, Alaskan roll, Rainbow roll, and Hawaiian Roll #2. They were each very delicious, but I think the Rainbow roll and the Hawaiian Roll #2 were the most substantial.\n\nPrices are reasonable for sushi in San Francisco--anticipate spending $25-50 depending on what you choose to order and how hungry you are. Overall, it's a nice hidden gem of a sushi restaurant with great quality fish for the price point.", "author": "Wendy W."}

Very few seats so if you don't get there right when it opens, it's almost worth just waiting an hour and then coming back. I wish they would take your name and number so you can walk away and come back, cause the waiting area is small. We usually get there 15 minutes before opening and there is already a line but with just 2 people, we always can get in.\n\nThe sushi chef doesn't seem to be chatty, so I just give him his space. He'll break up your order just so he can give something to everyone so customers seated are not waiting too long. \n\nBecause it's small, it also means few staff. There is only 1 waitress to take everyone's orders. I would recommend placing your order all at once, cause it'll be a while if you add to it. Everything I've had there, I've liked. Even the sliced ginger, and I don't like ginger.", "author": "Josephine C."}

Wouldn't have checked this place out until our SF friend told us it was the good stuff. They only open from 5-10 Wednesdays-Saturdays so the window for sushi is small. There was a wait before doors opened. \n\nWe waited maybe 30-40 minutes and ordered baked mussel, Hawaiian #2 and Rock-and-Roll. I liked the mango in the Hawaiian #2, and all of their fish seemed fresh. It was not too over-powering and I've never had fruit in my sushi like that. Baked mussel was a win. Read some reviews how everyone was raving about so of course we had to try it. It was good. If you're with people who have never tried this before, this is a good place to let them try it. It was flavorful, not too fishy, and generous. It was diced up instead of the usual whole piece. \n\nGreat people and great food is really all you need for a great time.

Its a 3 person operation with its own unique atmosphere and quality. Fish is cut thick and is super fresh. Flavor profile has a good Hawaiian influence. Rolls and pieces are messy looking, but very delicious.\n\n2. Bring cash. They don't take plastic. \n\n3. Expect to wait. Come early or come late. And sign in. The place only has ~16 seats (8 bar, and 2 tables), so it fills up, and then theres a line. Important to note that people take about an hour to eat. So if you come 30min after they open, expect to wait 1 hour for the people seated to cycle through, which means you might wait 2 hours. \n\n4. Only come if you are in the area.

There's something special when there's a staff of 3-4 waiting on 10-12 people. The service feels more personal and the ambiance, more intimate.\n\n2) sushi bar seating. I love watching the chefs prepare, there's some magic behind the knife work for each fish.\n\n3) off the beaten path. Sure, you can easily stay on Market St. or go to a more high foot traffic area, but I like the feel of being away from the city madness.\n\n4) Japanese operated. Everything feels more authentic when you hear the staff speak in Japanese.\n\n5) fresh fish. You can't go wrong with that!\n\nA few things to note:\n\n1) super long wait. So make sure you bring good company! You'll likely do most of your chatting up while waiting for your seat.\n\n2) cash only. The nearest ATM is pretty far away.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-14", "description": "We came here on a Friday night on a recommendation by a friend. The wait for a party of three was roughly 30 minutes. While we were initially seated by the bar, we were later moved to one of the two table booths in this small but rather cute restaurant. Ambiance was simple and quant - ideal for a casual date/hang out with friends. Service was slow, but expected in this 3-4 staff run joint. It is cash-only so come prepared. \n\nPresentation for the food was spot on. I would've however appreciated that the nigiri sushi was plated separately from the maki rolls as the Smoked Salmon Roll came with sauce that did seep onto the nigiri fish.\n\nSake (Salmon) Sashimi: My favourite. The sashimi pieces were just fatty enough to melt in my mouth. Paired with the lemon, it brings out the flavour so perfectly. Serving was small (4 pieces for $14) but considering how rich it is in taste, you wouldn't want too much of it. \n\nHamachi Nigiri: While it was $8 for two pieces, the fish serving was generous. Tasted fresh and neutral. The rice went very well with the fish. Seasoning was on point; texture was glutinous without it being too wet. Would have appreciated if the Hamachi came out first before the Salmon, but that's out of personal preference. \n\nSmoked Salmon Roll: I was rather disappointed by this Roll just because it didn't live up to what I imagined it would be. For $9.50, it was quite expensive (although subjective as I come from Vancouver where sushi is inexpensive and good tasting). The microgreens, a tab bit overpowering along with the inadequately baked salmon skin made for a mediocre tasting smoked salmon roll. Would skip this and try other maki rolls.\n\nAltogether, I spent just north of $30 (tax+tip incl). I would recommend it for those who haven't been, but it wouldn't become my go-to-neighbourhood sushi restaurant . It is definitely on the higher end of the pricing spectrum so expect to to pay $30-$40 for its authenticity and quality of food but not for its overall dining experience.", "author": "Raymond D."}

I remember when I first tried this place and being really impressed with the flavor and quality of their sushi rolls.  However, I don't know if it is just the loss of novelty or if the quality has fallen off, but on my most recent visits, I thought the sushi was good but not mind-blowing.  I also noticed that the rolls were not very well-constructed, with several pieces falling apart.\n\nIt's a small restaurant that usually has a long wait, and I think the female server deserves kudos for managing the various customers and never seeming bothered or frazzled.  However, during my recent visit, I noticed that the chef making the sushi rolls ate something off of his hands before going right back to making sushi!  Although I've never seen this type of chef behavior before at Sushi Zone, I don't think I can go back if a chef considers that appropriate hand hygiene.

His salmon (sake) nigiri is my favorite because he somehow adds the slightest hint of dill. The baked sea bass app is not to be missed. Your really aren't going to go wrong with any of the time-honored maki rolls, but I really just love the simple mango tuna or mango yellow tail. \nAlways opt for at least one hand roll (Ao is sorta famous for these in the rock-and-roll world) and try something new every time. For me recently it was the uni, which I was informed was from Japan when Ao handed it to me. Expect long lines, but really, it's worth it. Try going on a rainy evening or when a big TV event is on to avoid some of the lines. Thanks again Ao for keeping it real all these years!

After all, I'd finally found a sushi spot in San Francisco that prepares baked mussels. After waiting an hour outside for a seat, my friend and I finally sat down at the sushi bar. Space is limited here - there are 2 tables that can accommodate up to 4, the bar can accommodate around 8. \n\nService is friendly and quick. That should not be too difficult taking in to account the small space. We ordered the Sashimi Combo, which came with 14 pieces of the chefs choice. The platter included Salmon, Mackerel, Yellowtail, Octopus and other selections I was not familiar with. Though there were two slices each, we could cut each slice in half they were so big. You ever have one of those moments about an experience and say.. 'hmm that's a bad idea', then do it anyway? Well that is how I felt when I had my first bite of the salmon. It had a metallic taste to it. The tuna was meaty, though lacking any flavor whatsoever. I passed on the octopus, not my thing. The mackerel was about the same, not much flavor. \n\nWhen the baked mussels arrived I thought, okay those look amazing! The golden brown crust on the outside was deceiving. The inside tasted like mussels and scrambled eggs mixed with mayonnaise. No! Guess I better head back to LA if I want some proper baked mussels.  \n\nAfter not enjoying this meal, we learned it was cash only. I had maybe $19.00 in my wallet and my friend have left her card in her other wallet. You know how women be changing purses. Anyway, I went to the liquor mart next door to withdraw cash. I was able to get cash, but not the amount requested because the machine ran out of bills. I returned to the restaurant and told them what happened and asked, do you not have Stripe or any device to accept payment? 'No we only have a cash register.' Okay, well 1 you need to jump into the 21st century and 2 where is the next nearest ATM? Walk number 2 consisted of crossing Market street at 9:30pm to a laundromat that had an ATM inside. Bill paid, tip left, we lyfted home. As you do. \n\nOhh ho ho but the story does not end there. Around 3am my stomach was not feeling too good. Let's just say my dinner did not remain in my belly very long.... I did not throw it up. \n\nI most certainly will not be returning.", "author": "Jaylena P."}

Well, no longer will I have that first world problem! A friend brought me and 2 others here, and we had to wait for about an hour and a half, which was no problem since we went to the bar next door and had a drink. We then waited inside Sushi Zone and had some sake and chatted while waiting for our table to clear. It's such a neighborhood gem and I had to practice self restraint from ordering everything on the menu. The spicy salmon with mango and the Hawaiian #2 were my favorites, and I really have to give Sushi Zone props on their spicy salmon.

However, the head part (which is deep fried) had no batter. Being that it had no batter, I don't think it was cooked for as long and it wasn't cooked at a high enough heat. Normally when you eat the deep fried head, the head shatters when biting it, but here I couldn't bite into all the pieces and had to throw out some. That was pretty disappointing. The rolls...yea they aren't special. I would say you might get the best value there? That being said, wouldn't come back for the rolls. The sushi plate: we got mackereel, tuna, yellowtail, octopus, albacore, striped bass. Nothing here stood out. The chunks of fish were bigger than other places, but the quality just wasn't there. Some slices didn't even taste like fish. I enjoyed the yellowtail the most, but there wasn't much competition. Overall would not come here. Spent about 40 bucks a person, it's cash only, and wasn't really satisfied. If I spent 20 here I'd say that's very reasonable. I would go to v16 sushi which is also pretty close. You'll spend the same amount of money for much better quality.", "author": "Victor D."}

The quality is top notch and the portions are huge.\n\nIf every seat is able to be occupied the max is 17, including the the 2 tables in the window. People, do the math. If there are 6 names ahead of you on the list that means you could wait a whole turn before you are seated. I usually put my name on the list and go for a walk instead of staring at people eating and counting the moments till its your turn to have a seat. You can also order beer and sake while you wait but that can get dangerous if the wait ends up being 2 hours. Basically, for every 10 guests ahead of you think of it at as a 45 minute wait for your table.\n\nOnce you do get seated it's best not to order all stuff from the sushi chef or you will wait for another 45 minutes since he's got 17 mouths to feed and yours was last to sit down. Order some appetizers and enjoy your night out with some sake and beer. I've seen too many people get super excited about being seated to super hangry for waiting for their sushi. Also. Order ASAP. If you don't put your order in when the server comes to you she will take another tables order first and that just added on another 20 minutes to your wait.\n\nI love this place and know what I'm getting myself into every time. If you want to sit quickly and eat, sushi delight is down the street with no wait. I'm pregnant and have been eating here once a week for the past 4 months of my pregnancy. Never any issues with freshness and always satisfied. There are plenty of places to grab a cocktail while you wait and the neighborhood is cute enough for a stroll.", "author": "tinkerbell e."}

Having been born and raised in this city, I've had my fair share of japanese restaurant explorations and I must admit, I find myself always coming back to the zone. \n\nIt's a small restaurant with 9 spots at the bar and three tables for 4 ppl each totaling max capacity at 22 seats in the restaurant. It's a small venue and there's only one sushi chef and server per night so be prepared to attend with patience. \n\nDue to the minimal seating, plan to either arrive before it opens at 5pm every day or come at the very end (930pm). Arriving anytime in between will result in a 2 hour wait, no doubt.\n\nAt most sushi places, I'll opt for the nigiri but the mango in the rolls here make it taste so fresh and it's not typically an option so I always maximize on the rolls! \n\nHere's my classics:\nSpicy tuna roll add mango (a must!)\nHamachi mango\nSpicy salmon with mango\nHama-masa \nHawaiian#1\nSpicy scallop handroll\nBaked Mussels \nUnagi nigiri", "author": "Lauren Y."}

Luckily when the restaurant opened at 5pm, we got the last table. No waiting! Well, not really. \n\nI understand that food is slow to come since there is only one sushi chef and the sous chef only does appetizers. However, getting our food after an hour of being seated, is OK if the food was crazy amazing. Unfortunately, it was not. \n\nThe rolls we ordered (spicy tuna and spicy hamachi) were drenched with mayo mixture that just ruined the fish. The nigiris (unagi, salmon, hamachi, stripped bass) were ok, with the fish/rice combo just being too big for my liking. A good quality sushi is usually small enough to finish in one bite. These were not. The fish were fresh, but something with the slicing, texture and pairing that was off. The rice however was good. \n\nBottom line: very slow service, server was nice, sushi chef had a \"don't care\" attitude, and the food was average, but decent price.\n\nI will definitely not wait for one hour.

I generally teeter on the purist side but I can hang with the pseu-shi and jive ass rolls when need be.\n\nSushi Zone borders somewhere in between purist and jive, but leans further toward jive. (One of my favorite rolls here is topped with macadamia nuts, cmon now) Still, it doesn't mean Sushi Zone isn't good, in fact it's damn GREAT. \n\nWhile the fish is fresh and it is definitely worth it to order nigiri and sashimi here, the star of this joint is the baked sea bass with mango appetizer. One order is 2 pieces, so unless you're dining solo you better order another. I know damn well that I always want 2 for myself! It's basically sea bass that's diced up and placed into a New England mussel shell with diced up uber sweet mangoes. There's some sort of kewpie mayo mixture that has a slight kick to it. \n\nThe thing I hate most about this place is the wait. I've gotten more patient when it comes to people these past couple of years but when it comes to food? I've lost it. I can't stand waiting anymore. Your wait here will range anywhere between 45 minutes to 2 hours, guaranteed. If by some how you are here and nobody else is, this place is either closed or JUST opened.

We got there a little earlier (6pm on\nA Fri) and were seated immediately, so the wait was definitely not an issue. Having said that, let me just say that there is a reason many reviews crib about the wait...because there's probably a reason to! The place is tiny. It only has two tables and a bar area which seats no more than 8-10.\nAs for the food, it was every bit raving about. The mussels with sea bass and mango: warm and melt in your mouth delicious. Out of the three rolls we got, try the papaya and BBQ Unagi one (unbelievably yum) and the hamachi one with jalape\u00f1o and lime was amazing too. The fish was fresh and portions ample.\n\nThe only reason I take one star off is that they only take cash! --- no checks either.\nWhat an inconvenience this was because there's a single liquor store within walking distance where we had to unwillingly withdraw $ out of (with hiked fees of course).\nAn establishment this well known should really accept cards...at the least checks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-11", "description": "Sushi Zone is, so far, my favorite sushi-ya in San Francisco, both for the high quality and value of their food. However, don't get me wrong, it's also not the most convenient place to stop for dinner on a weekday or weekend night. The main reason being that the restaurant is an incredibly small, family own restaurant with two tables and a sushi bar. Therefore, there is almost always a wait here, regardless of the hour of the day. They also do not take reservations, so sitting is based on a first come (wait), first serve basis. If your party is greater than two people, I HIGHLY recommend arriving upon opening, which is at 5pm, and putting your name on the waiting list; and YES, there is a waiting list when they open. \n\nThat said, Sushi Zone is a great place for authentically crafted sushi, that I wouldn't mind waiting an hour for. Their sushi chef is known for their sushi rolls, nigiri, specials and baked mussels. I have not tried their dinner entrees, although I would not go to Sushi Zone especially for it. \n\nPresentation is rustic, beautiful and homey. It reminds me of a plate of sushi you will get from a good sushi-ya in Japan. I arrived here at around 5:30pm with a friend for dinner. We put ourselves on the waiting list and walked/waited around Hayes Valley for about 30-50minutes before being sitted. My only complaint is that it was a bit of wait to order and receive our order. But it was fine because we could tell everyone was working hard for there is 1 waitress, 1 sushi chef and 1 assistant. \n\nAfter nearly 1.5hrs of waiting, our meal finally commenced. And it was SWEET!\nWe enjoyed each dish ordered and kept talking about the need to revist Sushi Zone. Despite their small menu, you can't go wrong with any choices. However, I suggest getting their AWESOME signature dishes:\n\nFirst off, start with their Baked Mussel and Baked Stripped Sea Bass with Mango. Both are incredibly rich and tasty, unlike anything I have ever had!\n\nThen proceed with: Spicy Hamachi Roll (these are HUGE), any sashimi or nigiri (specials are awesome too), and end in a sweet note with their Hawaiian rolls; we had #2 which was filled with albacore, mango and topped with freshly chopped macadamia nuts. We would have ordered more but decided to save our appetites for the next visit. Next time, we're definitely getting an order of UNI!\n\nMy mouth waters from simply revisiting my last dinner here! If you are a sushi-fanatics, you must make a trip to Sushi Zone! Come early with a ready appetite for delicious, sweet and fresh fish and rolls, you will not be disappointed!", "author": "Jenny Z."}

It is literally just one room with two tables, some stools at the counter, one sushi chef, one waitress and one other worker behind the counter.  We waited two hours to get seated and it was TOTALLY WORTH IT! I would definitely go back here and wait two hours all over again for this place.  I went with my cousin and we just went next door to a bar and got drinks while we waited. You put your name on a white board and then you can leave and come back to check where you are in line. If you aren't there when they call your name, they'll go right back to you when you get back to the restaurant.\n\nWhen we went in to put our name on the white board they were playing some Bob Marley and then it was all Beatles while we were eating. It was a great experience! We sat at the counter and got to watch the chef make all of the sushi. The lone waitress was super attentive and friendly. I don't know what else to say about the sushi besides how fresh and delicious it tasted. Again, this place was definitely the best sushi I've ever had. We also got the hot sake and baked mussels. I definitely recommend the baked mussels as an appetizer. It was great getting to watch the chef prepare our food and then hand it to us. You see all the steps in the preparation of your food.\n\nAlso, the prices are totally reasonable.\n\nI can't wait to go back to San Francisco so that I can go back to Sushi Zone!

Everything tasted really, really excellent. Good mouthfeel on the fish and scallops, and it was very fresh tasting. The integrity of the scallop roll was disappointing though, it feel apart and was bursting at the seams, as though it was rolled too tightly. But whatever, it was delicious, not a big deal. \n\nAs to the interior and ambiance: it's a very small and bare bones place. The kitchen and the food is right out in the open: the actual sushi bar, the grill, the sink, the dishwasher, and bowls with edamame stacked high on top of each other next to the microwave, where they are heated. The industrial refrigerators are in the dining area. And finally, the bathroom was the storage area for all their cleaning supplies which just felt... weird.

All the ingredients are incredibly fresh and combined in the most unique and intricate manner. I came with my sister around 6 pm on a random Monday evening (which is actually the ideal timing / day to come bc the place is tiny and they don't take reservations so it's essentially first come first serve). We ordered the following: \n\n- seaweed salad\n- baked mussels \n- miso soup \n- spicy salmon with mango\n- rock n roll\n- hamachi roll\n- Hawaiian special #2 \n\nThe baked mussels were phenomenal - chopped up mussels with flavorful sauce (literally tasted like creamy buttery deliciousness that just melted in your mouth). Nothing like I've tasted before. Each serving comes with 2 and I definitely wanted more after I downed my one mussel. Maybe order 2 servings so you can have 2 each with your friend / date. \n\nI thought the Hawaiian roll was unique but wasn't as amazing as the spicy salmon w mango and hamachi roll. All in all, the ingredients tasted super fresh and this place is definitely my favorites.

Why is this restaurant constantly touted as one of the best (if not the best) sushi restaurants in the Bay Area? Sure, everything was tasty, but I found nothing about the food to be different from the millions of other good, reasonably priced sushi restaurants in the area.\n\nBaked bass: Creamy and rich with its combination of fish and mangoes. Delicious and a good example of the non-sushi part of Japanese cuisine that is often overlooked. However, I don't know that it's worth a repeat visit as it is a pretty simple dish that could easily be recreated at home.\n\nHama-mass roll, spicy mussel roll and spicy hamachi roll: Larger-than-average pieces, smaller-than-average portions. That translates to about 6 pieces per roll that are each difficult to eat in one bite. I would have much preferred the opposite. My friend and I are both hamachi lovers and we found the hamachi here to be less than fresh--way too soft (almost rubbery) and a little too warm. The mussels were okay, but they were cooked, so it was nothing special.\n\nAmaebi shrimp: One of the specials of the day. Decent portion for the price. The raw body was nothing spectacular, but the battered and fried heads that were later served were fantastic. The best part of the meal, in my opinion. \n\nUnlike some other reviewers, I was actually most impressed with the service. There was only one Japanese woman manning the whole restaurant, but she was super friendly and attentive, always answering our requests with a smile and even teasing us at times when she had a free moment. \n\nFor those concerned with the wait, my friend and I got there at around 6pm on a Friday evening. I was about 5 minutes earlier than her and there was only one other party of 2 ahead of us. The wait time between when my friend got there and when they called our names was roughly another 5 minutes.

Very very good and a must order.\n***Hawaiian Roll - Good, but the textures threw me a bit... really soft melty fish with crunchy macadamia nuts... not sure if I'm a fan.  The roll was falling apart a bit which was a sign that this was hastily put together.\n**Spider Roll - I love soft shell crab, and I've had this roll at many places before... and this one didn't really cut it for me.  The rolls was sliced too thin and the whole thing was falling apart.  The taste wasn't memorable.\n*Papaya Unagi Roll - Kinda weird!  I don't think I enjoyed the mix of a large chunk of papaya with unagi.  It's definitely not a roll for purists.  Papaya just isn't a strong enough fruit to counter the distinct flavor of unagi.\n***Omakase sashimi platter (14 pc, around $40) - nothing special on this plate, but the quality of the fish was good and fresh.  Being a small restaurant, I wasn't expecting anything beyond the usual maguro, hamachi, sake, tako, etc.  But it would have been a nice surprise to see some katsuo or uni or something.  Not sure this plate is worth it... I can get a similar plate at Sushitomi in Mountain View for cheaper and with more variety.

I want to start off by thanking all of the beautiful people of SF for being too busy partying the night before pride and making my wait on a Saturday night only twenty minutes. \n\nYes, the wait can be a real drag. This is were the hidden part comes in. The place is super tiny. Has two booths and about 10 seats at the Sushi Bar, the super limited seating makes it ideal for couples. You walk in put your name on a white board and wait. Stick around because they will skip you if your gone. Bring CA$H! This place is cash only. \n\nNow that we have that out of the way I can focus on telling you how amazing the sushi is. \n\nTo start we had a Miso Soup. Followed by the must have Baked Mussels with spicy mayo and scallions and the even more to die for Baked Bass with mango, spicy mayo, & fish eggs. I dream about that Baked Bass!!! If I had enough discipline to cut back on the sushi here I would order the Baked Bass for dessert. \n\nOkay, next we had the Spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy Tuna Hand Roll, and some very fresh Sashimi Sake. The couple next to us were regulars and highly recommended the Hawaiian Rolls. We ordered them and once again I fell in love. They were so fresh and delicious. \n\nThe freshness and price point make Sushi Zone worth the wait. It is definitely my favorite casual sushi spots in SF.", "author": "Caro S."}

They have a big following and tons of reviews, so go ahead and go if you believe what you write.  As much as I'd love to support a local gem, honestly the sushi was average at best.  The tuna jalapeno pepper app was rubbery and flavorless, the spicy hamachi was sour and boycotted by the sidekick, spicy salmon was good, real crab something roll was fine.  Nothing to rave about esp with the ratings seen here.  My guess is the family vibe makes you want to support it like the paralympics, even though you don't really watch the paralympics.  My faves in and around this city: Zushi Puzzle (a place where the Yelp ratings actually match the hype), Domo, Sushi Time, Sushi Bistro, and Yuzu/Sakae (burlingame...i know, gross).

We tried to go earlyish on a Friday night, but there are about 2 tables and 10 seats at the sushi bar, so we gave up and went somewhere else.  On our way back to the car, it was about 10 minutes before they closed and we decided to have a sushi night cap. It was well worth it.  \n\nWe ordered the stuff jalapeno with ahi. This was amazing, creamy deliciousness that I keep having dreams about. Imagine a baked (in a toaster oven, mind you) jalapeno stuffed with ahi and some kind of delicious sauce (probably mayo) with a nice golden brown top. Sooooo freaking good.

Is it 5 pm and you don't have anything else to do before dinner? Lyft to Sushi Zone, put your name on the list, walk a few blocks to Safeway to withdraw cash, wait to be seated. By the time it's your turn to eat, you'll finally have digested your huge lunch. \n\nSushi Zone has good sushi. However, I hesitantly say that the food was worth the wait (about 2 hours on Friday night) and I doubt I would actually wait again. \n\nFood: \nBaked bass: served with the spicy mayo and mangos in a mussel shell. The mixture tasted really interesting and I enjoyed the contrast between the tangy sweetness of the mango with the creaminess of the sauce over the bass\nBaked mussels: as good as everyone says. The mussels are mixed in the spicy mayo and put back onto the shell to bake \nSpicy tuna roll and spicy hamachi rolls: I'd recommend the spicy hamachi roll over the spicy tuna and to get another non-spicy roll as your second. Not that the spicy tuna wasn't good but because both rolls use fish that is mixed into the spicy mayo. I didn't realize this and would have liked a roll where you could taste the fish more\nHawaiian roll #1: good but the macadamia nuts were a little overpowering \n\nService: I'm amazed at how hard everyone works here. The two chefs and one server work nonstop. We had ordered and started devouring our two appetizers and two rolls when we realized we needed more food. We asked for a third roll and the server put our order in the front and we got it in a matter of minutes!

Yep two hours before we saw food. Service is extremely casual and the waitress spends more time chit chatting with patrons than worrying about the people who are half way into their graves waiting to get seated/being fed.\n\nQuality of Sushi was good but not great.

The slices of fish may as well be sashimi they're sliced so thick! Definitely no complaints from me there.

That said, we went in last night and it's just not the same. The older fella who is usually making the sushi was doing the prep work, and washing dishes. Fish and rice quality was wonderful, as usual - tako, sake, hamachi, albacore, tamago. We had all nigiri and 2 basic hand rolls. \n\nHere's my take away:\n\nBad cuts of fish\nRice ball for nigiri was oversized \nNori wraps on nigiri didn't fully wrap around\nNori paper on hand roll was not toasted - it was soggy. \nHand rolls were not tightly rolled and fell apart - messy. \n\n\nAll in all, just poor skills by the chef. Prep and execution are everything in sushi, and this guy was just pushing volume food, not like love and dedication that old guy put into every piece. \n\nCan the switch back be made? SZ was the best sushi in the west, now it feels like just another volume sushi house with an undeserved following. \n\nBring back the old chef, we miss him.", "author": "Sharon N."}

So, it's probably best to only bring 1-2 friends here at a time. I would also recommend this as a good date spot.\n\nI came here with a friend on a Tuesday night around 8:00 pm and waited an hour for a seat. The wait was fine because we just signed up on the list and went next door to Pisco Latin Lounge for drinks, which was the perfect way to kill time. \n\nAt about 9 pm, we were seated at the bar. There was only one waitress there and she took our order quickly. There is also only one sushi chef there and our order came out in just a few minutes. \n\nWe attempted to be adventurous and ordered the Hawaiian #2, which had mango, hamachi, and macadamia nuts on top. It was surprisingly good! We also ordered the Octopus roll, which was okay, but we thought it was a bit too chewy.\n\nThe couple next to us had the baked oysters which smelled amazing and looked delicious. It was highly recommended to us by the couple, but we were too full at that point to order them. I will have to try them next time!\n\nWe also had the unagi sushi and suzuki sushi.

First came the sea bass - I looked uncertainty at the two shells that looks nothing like the sea bass I normally eat. Turns out it's a creamy concoction with a thin layer of sea bass at the very top, mixed in with some delicious spicy mayo. Yum. The Hawaiian roll is recommended! I love the crunch from the macadamia nuts sprinkled throughout the roll. The mango roll is also yummy as I'm a huge fan of mangos. We were still hungry after this so we continued on with the more expensive rainbow roll ($12) and weren't disappointed. The amount of fish on the top is very generous.

We got the name down for our group of four at 5pm on a Sat. evening, which was pretty much at opening time. \n\nNot good enough. \n\nThere were three other groups of four in front of us, and we had to wait about an hour and fifteen minutes before we were seated at one of only two tables for four. After we were seated, it was about another 45-60min before we were served our main sushi. The wait is somewhat justified by the fact that there's only one sushi chef, and he obviously takes great attention to detail in his work, but just don't expect this to be an expedient affair. \n\nNow on to the actual food.\n\nThis fish is legit. After waiting for an eternity, you're going to want to get your monies worth, so make sure you don't leave this place hungry. I got the Sushi Combination Platter, which featured six pieces of nigiri and a California Roll, and supplemented that with a Hawaiian Roll #2. The cali roll was average, but the nigiri was very impressive, with the salmon and albacore tuna standing out in particular. Next time, I'd probably just get a bunch of salmon nigiri and would be pretty damn happy with just that. The Hawaiian Roll #2 combined albacore tuna and mango for a refreshing taste, topped with macadamia nuts for a sweet/salty taste profile. Different, but definitely tasty. \n\nIt came out to about $30ish per person on just food, no drinks, which isn't that bad considering the quality of fish.

Those were about the only \"good\" things about this place. \n\nTheir \"spicy mayo\" was NOT spicy at all, it was too tangy and they put waaaaay to much in their \"spicy\" rolls. Ordered their spicy: tuna, hamachi, salmon, and scallop. There was only one small piece of fish on each end of the roll and that was it. There were not enough fish IN the roll and too much of their \"spicy\" sauce. I had to dig out the tiny pieces of fish to avoid the sauce! I was not happy. I expected \"phenomenal\" sushi.

Here you won't find the over-reliance on tempura or exotic goos that hide bad cuts of fish in lesser establishments. These rolls stand out because they masterfully combine simple ingredients that accentuate really fresh fish.\n\nMost of the makimono are rolls of six pieces for $8. My favorites are the Hawaiian #2 (albacore tuna, mango, scallion, and mayo sauce, topped with Macadamia nuts) and the Spicy Mussel (with jalape\u00f1o, scallion, cilantro, sprouts, and lime).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-01-18", "description": "For the longest time, I wanted to try this highly rated sushi bar, but I feared the long wait that everyone wrote about.  One day, I decided to face the fear head on.\n\nLOCATION:  With a name like Sushi Zone, I expected a more Western style sushi place like Sushi-Go-Go, but I was pleasantly surprised to see a nice little neighborhood sushi bar.  There was no separate kitchen with refrigerator, stove, and sink all in the same space.  On the day I went, one Japanese chef made all the sushi, one young Japanese guy washed dishes and other kitchen tasks, and one young Japanese lady took the orders.\n\nQUESTION: Best sushi in SF?\n\nMY ANSWER:  Please read my linked opinion about Sushi Customers (http://www.yelp.com/biz/vSkY6bYFXN19f1eBXQXMNQ?hrid=KsBURNfxA2B0vjAgPiqnOg).  I believe that Japanese standards to judge sushi do not apply in the U.S.  In Castro area, there is a large population of customers, enough to form lines out the door, who seek the rolls at Sushi Zone.  To this population, Sushi Zone maybe the best sushi in SF.  If you apply the Japanese Standards, Sushi Zone may not even be considered an Edo (Tokyo) Style sushi bar.  It lacks the basic variety of fish choices.  With over 90% of orders being rolls, chef makes very few nigiri, which Tokyo Style Sushi is known for.  At a sushi bar, you should be able to order directly from the chef, one order at a time, but you cannot do that here with a long waitlist of orders.  Customers that seek sushi like Japan would be highly disappointed at Sushi Zone.\n\nFOOD:  I enjoyed the rolls at Sushi Zone.  I especially liked the rolls with thin slices of lime and jalapenos.  I could not believe how well it went in a sushi roll.  As for mango and Macedonian nuts, it worked well with the rolls, but I did not become a big fan of them.  With a limited number of raw fish in stock, it allowed a fast turnover.  It allowed him to always have fresh fish.   \n\nPROBLEMS:  Sushi chef works very hard and fast to make the rolls as quickly as possible.  However, with no helpers, he cannot get them out quickly enough.  Usually, the apprentice makes the rolls while the master makes nigiri.  Here, I don't think he considers the other guy his apprentice.  Chef didn't even allow the other guy to season the sushi rice.  Come here with plenty of time and don't expect to get your food immediately after ordering.  This will not seem like a big problem when you receive your check, which will be significantly lower than other premium sushi restaurants.  You can go home satisfied for $25/person.\n\nJapanese style sushi fans:  This is more of a 2 Star sushi bar.  Not enough 'neta' selections.  I don't think the chef went through apprenticeship in Japan.  I would definitely encourage you to try this place as their rolls are very creative and good.  \n\n--Useful notes for my next visit---\n8 --- Counter seats\n2 --- Tables for 4 adults\n\nWednesday night in January:\n6:10 --- Two groups ahead of us\n6:30 --- Seated\n8:00 --- Leave restaurant\n\nParking:\nFairly easy on Valencia, just south of Market.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

Arriving around nine in the evening, she's surprised to see it's so packed for a Tuesday night.  Sure, it's been a year since her last visit and we get on the long list of waiting hopefuls.  With only two tables for four and about 10 counter seats, our wait extends out for about an hour.\n\nDiners are in no rush as they linger over sake and Sapporo.  With only one sushi chef, one waitress, and another assistant who manages the fryer and washes the dishes, the pace of food coming out is far from a hurried state.  We get seated a little after ten despite the CLOSED sign being put out a quarter to that hour.\n\nThe waitress takes our drink orders, which is simple with water and tea.  We also throw in some edamame since we're starving and we know the sushi is going to take awhile.  Their menu is brief, one laminated page and their specials board. \n\nThe first item to arrive is the Spicy Tuna Roll (Tuna, avocado & scallion w/ a mayonnaise base $5.50) and I am reminded of why I first started enjoying the spicy tuna roll...the mayonnaise based spicy sauce.  (I hate it when they use that Sriracha sauce. Blah!)  It comes in six pieces and the roll isn't wrapped very tightly, so you definitely have to make it in one bite.\n\nNumber two is the Spider Roll (Softshell crab, avocado, and shiso $9.00), also cut into six pieces.  The crab is still very hot as it just emerged from the fryer.  The shiso adds a nice finish to this crunchy bite.\n\nWe look over at our neighbors and are tempted by their nigiri choices.  We also order one amaebi nigiri ($4.50) and its sweet plumpness is pleasant to our tastebuds.  The deep fried shrimp heads come out shortly.    \n\nLorna D. has an obsession with mango, and anytime she sees a roll with this sweet fruit, she had to get it.  The Mango Hamachi Roll (yellowtail, mango & scallion $5.50) comes out next.  \n\nThe Alaskan Roll (salmon, avocado, & scallion $5.00) is quite satisfying with its chunky salmon bits and I find myself smiling with glee on all this lovely sushi.\n\nIt's way past 11 and I tell Lorna this is our last chance for any additional rolls she may want.  (There's another party behind us that has yet to be served!)  We go for the Spicy Scallop Roll ($5.50) and learn they are out, so we opt for the Spicy Albacore Roll ($5.50) instead.  The spiciness proves a bit too much for Lorna D., but I really couldn't ask for more.\n\nService is what you can expect when there's such few staff.  The waitress will fill your water and tea glass when you ask, just don't expect her to come around and do it automatically.  She's too busy taking orders, bringing sushi platters back and forth, and clearing the dishes.  Patience is definitely a virtue here.\n\nSushi is fresh and good. No frills at all.  Next time I would love to pig out on their sashimi and nigiri since their fatty chunks of fish were making me drool.\n\nAt $42 with tip and tax, we left content and with very full bellies.  \n\nCash only.  Don't bother coming with anyone else besides your plus one, otherwise the wait will be even longer. \n\n(Pics of our sushi dinner can be found in the business profile.)", "author": "Teri C."}

I went on a date here with a girl who loves to go to all the hyped up 2 hour wait places in SF (Zazzies, Burma Superstar, Outerlands).  We had a great time...but is it really worth the 60+ min wait?  \n\nGot here around 7:30 on a Monday and only 2 groups were ahead of us.  We waited, and waited and finally were seated after 40 min (like other reviews, the waitress didn't even say hi or make eye contact with us for the whole time we were waiting, the only interaction we had was when she called our name, kinda rude but whatever, not docking anything for that).  Then you have to wait and wait and wait for all the orders in front of you to be made, and then FINALLY you get your first roll.  \n\nThe food was pretty good, not the best I have had but I would go back just for the food (not the line).  We got 4 rolls to split.  All $8 which is very reasonable for the quality.  The 2 specialty rolls, Hawaiian #2 and the spicy mussel were great.  Hands down some of the best rolls I have had.  The mussel one was cooked and had a great lime flavor which I'd never had in a sushi roll.  The Hawaiian #2 had mango in it which was also a first and pretty damn tasty.  I also appreciated how the specialty rolls were the same prices as the normal rolls, a lot of places will jack up the price on the special rolls but Sushi Zone didn't.  We got two basic Salmon rolls which were just OK, i wouldn't order them again.  We got free green tea with the meal which  hit the spot, and the waitress was pretty attentive with refills.  \n\nTotal bill came to $40 with tax and tip.  Well worth the price.  Was it worth the wait?  No chance in hell.  Are there other places where I can walk in and be eating in 15 min for the same quality of food?  Probably. I would go back again if it were only a 30 min wait, the food was good.  If you go, stick to the specialty rolls, they were awesome and are what probably give this place all the 4 star reviews.  If you go, eat a snack before, because from the time you walk in and put your name down to the time you get your first roll, it will easily be 90+ min (make sure you take a fun date, if he/she is boring you are in for a looooooong night).", "author": "Mark M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-14", "description": "Sushi Zone has been bookmarked for places to try for over a year. As the near year began, I wanted to tackle as many places to try on my growing list of bookmarks. When the opportunity came up to get sushi, I went to my bookmarks and went with Sushi Zone. Reading the reviews of the long wait was somewhat of a deterrent but if I wanted to knock Sushi Zone off my list, I just had to SUCK IT UP!\n\nLuckily, I didn't have to wait too long since Matt L. was waiting on a table while I got off work, drove to Sushi Zone and found parking.  It is street parking in the area so it's the luck of the draw you find good parking. Sushi Zone is SMALL...REALLY SMALL! It seats 8 people at the bar and 2 booths with 4 seats in each...for a grand whopping total of 16 seats for the patrons to fight over. I got there a little late so Matt L. had to give our seat away to the next people on the list since the whole party has to be present for them to seat you. We ended up waiting another 30 minutes before we got seated. \n\nWe got seated in the booth that fits 4 so we got a couple of nasty glares when we sat down. I thought we had to communal with another party but we had the whole booth to ourselves. The waitress came over and got us started with drinks, we had a large Sapporo. That came quickly and we were ready to order when she came back. We ordered the, Baked Mussells, Baked Bass, Spicy Hamachi Roll, Hawaiian Roll #2, Papaya Unagi, Scallop Roll and Sake (Salmon) Nigiri. \n\nThe appetizers, Baked Mussells and Baked Bass came first. The Baked Bass was good but not really really good. The bass was a little over cooked so it had the tough feeling. I enjoyed the mango in the bass though. The Baked Mussells was AMAZING! Perfectly cooked! It was buttery good, wished I got 2 more. These are both baked and served in a mussell shell. (See http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/M175LTlKPJjAWREIUPyMGg?select=YxYdjiGc86rz-YD0R9pF5w and here http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/M175LTlKPJjAWREIUPyMGg?select=CWM2-LObYAxV1k3OrUsp_Q).\n\nIt took a while for the rest of our rolls to come but we expected it since this place was PACKED and there is only one sushi chef behind the counter working his butt off. The rest of our rolls soon came in a big platter, Spicy Hamachi Roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/M175LTlKPJjAWREIUPyMGg?select=loGRPESSoT-C9r_YdCKgHA), Hawaiian Roll #2 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/M175LTlKPJjAWREIUPyMGg?select=W-jEgXnPgCUYZ7adawCleQ), and Papaya Unagi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/M175LTlKPJjAWREIUPyMGg?select=4ojs7fM0he8UaU0Mwboucg). Everything was super delicious and fresh. The Hawaiian Roll #2 was what I was looking forward to due to all the suggestions on Yelp and it did live up to the hype. The macadamia nuts on top added a great contrasting texture to the soft melt in your mouth goodness of the roll.\n\nWe took a quick break from the food and got another beer, this time an Asahi. We flagged down our waitress (there's only one working the entire restaurant) and ordered 2 more dishes. We waited 25 minutes for the rest of our food to come. The Sake Nigiri (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/M175LTlKPJjAWREIUPyMGg?select=id_zuZQ4rt460t5NMJc9qA) was melt in your mouth good. The Scallop Roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/M175LTlKPJjAWREIUPyMGg?select=74u6cOM8660XjhmmCR7u5g) was my least favorite dish of the night, the scallop was super slimy and the texture was just weird to me. \n\nAll in all, the meal took around 2.5 hours with waiting and eating. Overall, I enjoyed the food and the service at Sushi Zone. The food was fresh and a little different from other Japanese restaurants (fruit in the dishes) and the service was attentive. Props to our waitress for working so hard. It's CASH ONLY. I will definitely be back the next time I don't mind waiting for some BOMB Japanese food.", "author": "Myron J."}

I came here with a friend to celebrate our birthdays and we had done our research. We were careful to come early, we were prepared to wait, we brought cash since it's CASH ONLY. \n\nEven though we got there early we waited a completely bogus amount of time. The waitress estimated an hour, we waited a little over two and half hours to be inexact. They have a white board that you write your name on and the waitress occasionally checks to see if you're there waiting and circles your name so she knows who to call next. If she calls your name and you're not there...well then, you're SOL and you're name is taken off the list. \n\nI can't describe the torment of sitting outside of a restaurant in the cold watching tables get their food and savor it slowly. On this particular day there was a lady eating by herself and she was leisurely reading a book. She then had a few drinks and became friends with the people seated at the bar and started up a conversation with the couple sitting next to her. They got more drinks and chatted away long after they were done eating. \n\nI understand that it's awesome to make friends over dinner, but I'm HUNGRY!!!\n\nAnyways, after my little tantrum over book lady, she finally leaves along with the couple sitting next to her. Score! \n\nWe had the opportunity to order while we were waiting so the wait for our food wasn't as long as I saw it take for other tables. We ordered both the mango sea bass and the baked mussels. They arrived at the table and looked almost exactly the same. I thought the sea bass would look more like a piece of fish, but it's placed over diced mango in a mussel shell and covered with sauce. The baked mussels were chopped up mussels mixed with sauce and baked into a mussel shell. They were both good, but come in a pair, so I felt like I wanted more.\n\nThe sashimi appetizer was super duper awesome as well as the rolls and nigiri that we got. They ran out of some fish, which made me sad because I saw other people ordering and eating it, but that's how it goes.\n\nI think if I only had to wait 30 minutes, Sushi Zone would be a solid 4 stars. All the anticipation of food made my dinner seem not as good as it could have been, if that makes sense. I know it's not the restaurant's fault that they are popular, but it's honestly not worth such a long wait. \n\nIf you pass by and the wait doesn't seem to bad, I'd say go for it!", "author": "Grace Y."}

The friendly Japanese sushi chef quickly made and handed my sushi to me. The spicy hamachi tasted like ceviche with the lime and wasn't very spicy. The mangoes were very sweet as I saw the chef toss out the bad mangoes from the batch. The rolls contained a lot of rice compared to minced fish, which might be why the rolls were only $6.50. However, the rice was mushy today making the sushi not very good. \n\nI also tried the baked mussels and baked sea bass with mango ($5.50 each). Considering that the appetizers were baked in a toaster oven, they were tasty, but I didn't expect the mussels and sea bass to be chopped up. I thought I would get a whole piece of mussel and a cut or small fillet of sea bass. Instead, the sea bass was chopped, mixed and baked with cheesy mayo and mangoes in a mussel shell; the resulting baked sea bass tasted more like mayo than fish.", "author": "Diana B."}

So fresh and delicious and totally worth it to go. It's super small (probably only holds no more than 12-15 people in the entire restaurant) so I recommend getting there early. I went with two other people, and we got there right at 5:30 pm on a Friday. We had a 45 minute wait already by that point, but we were luckily seated by 6:00 pm. We ended up ordering seaweed salad, sea bass (2 orders for 3 of us), the chef's sashimi platter, and three rolls (spicy hamachi, spicy tuna, and another special roll I forgot which one). \n\nThe chef's sashimi platter was a GREAT deal and totally filled us up before we even received the rolls. The sashimi platter gave a good variety of fish, even including octopus! It was 14 pieces and they were huge between the three of us. It was so delicious and the rolls were also to die for. I felt more than sufficiently full by the time we were done with our meal. \n\nThe downfall of this place was that everything took forever. We were seated at 6:00pm like I said, and we didn't get the sashimi platter till 6:45 and the rolls till about 7:20. The rolls took more than an hour to arrive from the time we ordered which was annoying, but it worked out in terms of how we wanted to space out the food. However, if they were faster, then people would be able to come in and out of this restaurant way faster. People were waiting forever - the food makes it worth it, but I do think it could be sped up a bit. \n\nI'll definitely be coming back though! This place rocks. So yummy!", "author": "Priya G."}

We arrived at 8PM on a Friday without reservations. There was one waitress who saw us but did NOT acknowledge our presence. AKA, meaning: she knows you are there but doesn't greet you nor ask your name to put on the waiting list. The restaurant had approximately 20 patrons -- sitting at the L-shaped  bar or socializing at two banquette seats.  There was a party of three people before our party of two; however, the waitress didn't acknowledge our presence for 20 minutes until I made a snark comment about terrible hipster customer service within her hearing range. \n\nIn order of presentation: the Seaweed Salad was good.  The Baked Mussels were excellent.  The Baked (Striped) Bass and Mango had a rough texture inconsistent with the presentation which was, ultimately, unappetizing. The $36 chef's choice Sashimi Combo plater was of average quality fish; however, the Papaya and Unagi roll was tasty. We  had two large bottles of Sake and one large Sapporo. Overall, the whole experience was AVERAGE! VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THE YELP RATINGS ON THIS SITE.  The Sushi was worth $50 but we paid $100 for a lackluster experience. Never again!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-31", "description": "This was a three phase talent show between the sushi chef, the nigiri pieces, and fellow Yelper Tom R, who took a colossal chunk of wasabi in the size of futomaki and swallowed the entirety without a flinch. These were my three points of fascination as I joined Maybelline C, her friend Wendy, and Tom R for a sushi dinner in the City. If not for my friends who arrived early to snag a table, I was told the wait could last up to two hours. \n\nMay and Tom are among my most trusted Yelpers so it was nice to sit back as they took care of the ordering.  All together, we shared two appetizers, one roll, and they asked for the chef to bring the house with their freshest assortment of nigiri:\n\nStuffed Jalapenos: Four giant pieces of opened jalapenos smothered with a creamy spicy tuna rendition. The jalapeno was bulky like a bell pepper with a dull kick and the stuffing was too creamy for my taste. I'm a big fan of the concept but the taste and presentation was rugged when compared to the ones that were finesse and sharper tasting at U-Zen.\n\nBaked Bass: Minced bass baked with cream cheese and mayo served in a shell, and sandwiched between small chunks of sweet mangos at the bottom and morsels of masago atop. The sweet mango did not have influence until the bottom was reached while the bass was even creamier than the stuff jalapenos. When it comes to these types of dishes I'm expecting craftiness so the cream laden bass was less than ideal for my taste.\n\nHawaiian Roll: Sushi roll with fresh albacore and more mangoes at the center covered with canned macadamia nuts. I like the fresh albacore but the mango and macadamia nuts were a mysterious combination as they looked and tasted out of place.\n \nFor those sushi eaters with discriminating palates, the best bet here are their nigiri and sashimi. There were some hits and misses as I liked the hamachi, sake, and albacore, but I also find the maguro decent and the hirame disastrous. I was tempted to try their uni but decided against it after faced with the inconsistencies previously mentioned. Otherwise, the fish was generously cut into equal sizes--an art form for which I deeply appreciate.\n\nMy plum wine was a bit medicinal in taste but it was still worth the experiment. The place is a tiny hole in the wall so the huge line of people waiting for a table brought an overwhelming atmosphere with  little elbow room to maneuver outside our immediate area. The noise level was high and the server was a one-person operation who amazingly brought us rounds of awesome tasting water without skipping a beat. Among the three forms of talents being displayed, I thought there were some bright spots about the nigiris but Tom's wasabi trick was the most newsworthy. Here is how Sushi Zone is rated with all considered:\n\n1.) Quality and freshness: 3.5 stars. With the exception of hirame, other nigiris ranged from decent to good. The ones I enjoyed had good moisture and taste, but aside from this dish, the others were either too creamy or the ingredients simply didn't meshed well together.\n2.) Creativity and presentation: 2.5 stars. Perhaps too creative on the appetizers and the only roll we got. The simple look and taste of the nigiris was much more favorable.\n3.) Quantity and substance: 3 stars. We each got a decent piece from all the dishes and were full by the time the meal was completed.\n4.) Accessibility and affordability: 4 stars. We double ordered all the dishes and the total still came out to be $30 per person. The price tag was excellent.\n5.) Service and ambiance: 3 stars. The venue is very small so the overcrowded ambiance could be overwhelming at times. I thought service was decent considering the amount of people waiting to be served with a chaotic line that flooded onto the sidewalk. \n\nTheir largest table can only seat four so the setting arrangement is not ideal for large groups or family friendly. Cash only.\n\n3 stars for the overall experience. With so many great sushi places in San Francisco, this restaurant was worth the try but I will not be returning unless Tom is scheduled to reappear for another wasabi trick.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Planning for an early dinner and standing in line, meant that our party of four was seated immediately when Sushi Zone opened at 5.  The line had at least 6 or 7 parties in it 10 minutes before opening - looked like everyone was thinking the same thing: let's beat the wait.  \n\nThe restaurant is small; there are two booths that can seat four each, maybe five/six if you want to squeeze three people on each side (but I think that's pushing your comfort level). The rest of the seating is at the bar where you can watch the sushi master at work. \n\nAs all the reviews are saying, the fish truly is amazing.  The cuts are fresh and the portions are big. Most rolls (all but two) are $8/roll. \n\nThe Spicy Hamachi was by far my favorite -  for the first time in my life, I was hesitant to dip my roll in my soy sauce wasabi mixture.  I cherished the unique and very subtle flavors of the roll too much.  Lime and hint of jalape\u00f1o in each bite - I didn't think that combination would be good with raw fish - but it was unlike anything I could've imagined. \nThe Spicy Tuna was also great.  They use the spicy mayo really well here-- it doesn't drown your roll and there isn't a fat dollop of it on top. Instead, the mayo is lightly mixed in - it's subtle, and brings out the flavors of the fish. \nI also had the Hama Masa roll which was good (fresh, quality ingredients) but in comparison to the previous two rolls not as unique. \n\nMinor setbacks, the tea was not particularly good nor flavorful and the sake was so so.

That may be true, but sadly that is a more a reflection of how surprisingly mediocre the sushi is in San Francisco.  It's really kinda stunning as SF is otherwise a great city for Asian food.  I suspect it's because there isn't a very large Japanese population in SF relative to other Asian ethnicities and sushi has become very trendy in mainstream American culture.  So the sensibilities for what is \"great\" sushi by most SFers (a city of transplants) is relative to what they had \"back home\".\n\nSushi Zone has all the trappings of a \"to-die for\" hole in the wall: the place is TINY -  as in seats 16 total (8 at the bar, and 2 tables of 4), it's too warm to be sanitary for sushi, is in the middle of nowhere on Market Street, takes forever and a day to get a table (2 hours on a Friday night), and is CASH only.  The only problem is the sushi does not in any way live up to the hype.  It actually rates somewhere just above average.  Certainly not anywhere close to the best I've had.  I've had great sushi plenty of times and without the \"charming\" \"annoyances\" one is really only willing to tolerate when the food is exceptional.\n\nIf you're used to places like Ponzu or Blowfish, then this is certainly more authentic, but it's still highly Americanized.  The crowd is strictly gaijin - no Japanese at all (except staff) while we were there. The menu is English only (another subtle hint about the clientele), and it's dominated by Western style rolls - granted they were more \"Japanese\" than some of the ridiculous concoctions at rock'n roll sushi bars.  \n\nAlthough I only give Sushi Zone 2-stars, It's not a condemnation of the owner/chef.  The food is 3-stars (maybe even 4 if you've never been to Japan).  It's the massive wait times (not his fault) which made it a 1-star experience for me.  He is Japanese and a very competent sushi chef who prepares respectable food.  But the place is too damn small and inconvenient, and he has certainly tailored the menu for his crowd.  Having had the real deal many times, Sushi Zone just doesn't do it for me.  But I guess if you live in SF, this is about as good as it gets.  If you really want to experience great sushi though and can't go to Japan, then visit the suburbs of LA.  There is a HUGE Japanese population around Torrance / Gardena and that's where you'll find the best sushi in America.", "author": "Michael T."}

I know that asking how his day went will keep the person behind me in line waiting another 12s. I'm sorry.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-10-20", "description": "First off this is a small intimate restaurant as others have stated. That's part of its charm. There are two booths that seat 4 people each and the counter which seats 8. Maximum seating capacity is 16 if the booths are filled, most times there's just a couple occupying them. When you walk up to the place based on the size you should expect a wait if the tables/counter are full. For those who complain about having to wait, what would you rather have? 1) A wait and then a leisurely meal where you can savor it all at your pace. 2) No wait and a waitress who delivers indigestion as she encourages you to inhale your food and stands over you breathing down your neck to get you to gulp your tea and vacate your seat.\n\nIf you get there and the tables are full, add your name to the whiteboard (it's on the sideboard). There's a bench near the door and four chairs against the sideboard for waiting. I recommend grabbing one of the chairs against the buffet so that you can watch the Sushi chef. While you wait you can enjoy a Sapporo or sake or nibble on some Edamame. We've waited both times we've gone here - a little over an hour the first time and almost 2 hours the second time. There's a rhythm to the waiting - some people come in, list their names, and reappear just as the seats with their name open up. NOTE: If you wander and then come back to discover that your name has been passed, don't despair. The server will seat you when the next table comes open.\n\nThe first time I came here I didn't know to get the baked sea bass with mango. A friend told me we absolutely had to get it the next time and we'd forgotten about it until we were waiting we saw a baked concoction on mussel shells go by us. It was as good as we'd been told. If you're with another person, don't get just 1 order (2 pieces for each of you), get your own order! \n\nAlso, if you have the choice between a booth or the counter, I'd recommend the counter. When we sat at the booth, the chef wasn't able to judge our pace and sent out the sushi at the same time. At the counter we were able to enjoy each plate on its own. Sushi is meant to be savored from the start as your eyes feast on the presentation to finish as your mouth experiences a symphony of balanced flavors.", "author": "Eden S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-12", "description": "After reading all of the reviews citing 2.5 hour wait times and not complaining, we had to give Sushi Zone a try. We got here at 6:00 sharp and put our name on the list. For those of you who haven't been to Sushi Zone before, putting your name on the list means physically picking up an Expo marker and writing your name on a dorm room whiteboard. Pretty funny. Lucky for us, there were only two parties in front of us, and they both had gone around the corner for a drink, so we were seated within about ten minutes.\n\nBut this review isn't about the wait. It's about the food:\n\nAppetizers (4/5): We ordered both the baked bass with mango and the baked mussels. Both came in mussel shells, so were a little hard to tell apart, until we ate them of course. If I had to choose one over the other, I might lean slightly towards the mussels, but they're pretty small, so go ahead and order both.\n\nRolls (3/5): We had the tuna mango roll and the yellowtail scallion roll. Fish portions seemed a little bigger than other places, but nothing special. We didn't see a lot of creative or unique rolls on the menu, which probably should have been a sign to focus on other things.\n\nNigiri (5/5): This is the shining point. Not only is the nigiri super-fresh, but the slices of fish are incredibly thick and generous. We had uni, maguro, salmon, hamachi, and albacore. We have had better uni elsewhere, but the four fish nigiri we ordered were right up there with some of our favorite sushi spots. I would say that the albacore and salmon were tied for the favorite spot, though the hamachi and maguro were strong contenders as well.\n\nThe next time we go to Sushi Zone, we'll probably order a little more nigiri and skip the rolls--not because the rolls are bad, but because the nigiri is so good.", "author": "Safford B."}

And after a longer than expected walk from my apartment, I was determined to wait out the 3 names before me to see what all the Sushi Zone hype was about.  It's sushi. It's raw. How long could the wait be?\n\n1.5 hour later, I was ravenous. Maybe that's part of the allure of Sushi Zone? You wait so long to eat that you are really hungry and food tastes extraordinarily delicious. However, the sushi here is really good. And I'm confident that the sushi would taste this good even if I hadn't waited as long.\n\nEverything we had was simple, fresh, and very good.  We started with a green salad topped with mango, avocado, and shrimp, served with a miso dressing.  We also ordered a yellowtail/scallion roll, salmon nigiri, and a spicy hamachi roll.  The spicy hamachi roll was our favorite roll.  \n\nAlthough the sushi was very good, the standouts of the meal were the baked mussel and baked seabass.  The baked mussel is a concoction of mayo and chopped mussel, baked in a mussel shell.  The seabass is the same concoction, but with sweet chopped mango in it.  Both were sweet, creamy, and rich.  The seabass was so good that we ordered a second round.  \n\nIf you can get here before the rush or endure the wait, you'll be rewarded with really fresh sushi at unheard-of, cheap prices.", "author": "Monelle A."}

Which I was ok with since my friends and I were at a bar around the corner. \n\nThe thing that I didn't like was how long it took for the food to get to us once we ordered.  Around 40-50 mins later, we finally got to try this \"amazing sushi\" which wasn't so mind blowing fresh but this may also be due to the fact that it took forever. \n\nAll the rolls we ordered were great but was it great enough to wait that long for it?  Nah.  I think you can get just as great quality sushi elsewhere in SF like Tataki!  The good thing about Sushi Zone is that it wasn't expensive.

You will only enjoy this experience if you have a lot of time to devote to waiting patiently for a seat and if you have no where else to go after dinner.\n\nFood: In an age of spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and other ground up sushi fillers that all taste the same, Sushi Zone delivers some of the best food at a reasonable price. This place has some of the nicest cuts of sashimi I've ever had... maybe rivaling even Nobu for the texture and weightiness of the meat. And I really mean that it is a fraction of the price. A bill for 4 stuffed to the gills came out to $120 all in.\nThis is my advice: go beyond the rolls. While they are very nice, they aren't a cut above the rest of the sushi restaurants around the world. For me, the baked mussels and the baked sea bass made the 2.5 hr wait worth it (this was on a TUESDAY night). These appetizers are served very much like baked scallops at dim sum restaurants... meat mixed with some variation of kewpie mayo and loaded onto a sea shell... then baked to a molten golden brown. These items are out of this world... don't miss them if you took the time to wait in line for a seat.\n\nSpace and Decor: The storefront is very unassuming and small. There are 2 tables for 4, and the rest is just areas around the bar. It has a homely, if a bit cramped, feel to it. But luckily, its never freezing cold in the Bay, and if you get a bit claustrophobic, you can step outside and wait.\n\nPS don't come if you plan on going out later.

Will try the baked mussels next time!  The rolls were all delicious, we had tried a variety of rolls, some raw, some cooked but everything was really good and fresh.  The rolls had a very well balanced flavor and their spicy mayo is yummy!  \n\nI've been here twice and the wait is definitely long!  The place is tiny, they can fit about 8 people at the bar and they have 2 tables which fit about 4 each.  Get here before they open and you should be fine.  If not, be prepared to wait at least an hour to two to be seated! The first time we came here, we waited 2hours before we were seated and we were first on the waiting list.  On our second try, we were able to grab the last two seats at the bar.  There is only one sushi chef so it takes some time before your food arrives.  Once the food starts coming, the rest of your food will arrive at a good pace.  Once we finish one item, the chef will have your next item ready.  Besides the wait, this place is awesome!", "author": "Veronica N."}

Luckily, this place isn't too pricey.\n\nI've been here twice, one with a party of 5 and another time party of 2. Both times 1hr+ wait. This place is super tiny so I suggest that you put your name down on the whiteboard and go do something for at least 45 min. Both times we arrived around 7:30-8 and the wait was just as long. Perhaps next time we'll come around opening time which is 5pm (who eats dinner that early). Parking isn't difficult, mostly all meters.\n\nWe ordered: \n\nBaked Bass: DELICIOUS! Chopped up bass meat mixed with some creamy mayo sauce with some ponzu and scallions. One order comes with two pieces.\n\nBaked Mussels: JUST AS GOOD! Pretty much the same concept as bass but with chunks of mangoes added. Mouthwatering goodness! Each order also comes with two pieces.\n\nSashimi Combo: Comes with salmon, red tuna, mackerel, albacore, shrimp, and yellow tail I think? Not skimp on the pieces.\n\nHawaiian Roll #1: Tuna with avocado and a generous amount of chopped macadamia nuts sprinkled on top. YUM!\n\nHawaiian Roll #2: Yellowtail with mango and also with avocado I think, plus the mountain of macadamia nuts sprinkled on top. JUST AS GOOD AS #1.\n\nUnagi papaya: Exactly what the name says, eel with papaya. I am not a fan of papaya so I did not try this but my cousins sure had no problem annihilating it within minutes. \n\nMango Hamachi: The flavors really compliment each other and gives that tropical taste.\n\nHama Masa: One of the few rolls that didn't really leave a strong impression in my head, but nonetheless delicious.\n\nSpicy Hamachi Roll: Exactly how it sounds too. Very fresh, very simple, very good!\n\nSalmon & Albacore Nigiri: Very fresh and generous on the cut.\n\nI like my sushi simple and fresh, because I find restaurants that like to mask the freshness of their fish with some kinda spicy mayo sauce or teriyaki sauce, kinda jive? Kinda overpriced and for no reason. The rolls here have the best of both. Simple yet with a touch of hawaiian influences. The best thing about it is that it won't break the bank. Each roll is about $5.50-$7 for a decent size too. Just remember not to come here hungry because it will be over an hr.", "author": "Elaine L."}

Everything tasted just as they would at another decent sushi joint and the cost seemed to be slightly cheaper overall. \n\nBut the sushi master is the only one making any sort of food for diners, and since everyone is starving when they sit down, each order consists of a billion things, which slows down things for the next diner.

It was a chance encounter for me one night as I passed by at 20 mph on the F Train and seeing activity within the restaurant in an otherwise very dead block. Though I'd seen the high Yelp rating before, it was the sight from that random night that triggered me to finally check it out.\n\nSmall, even for a sushi establishment, Sushi Zone's sushi and maki roll offerings are anything but small in portion and flavor. I find their prices very reasonable especially considering the generous cut of fish you get. What impressed me even more is the freshness of the fish I had. Their rainbow roll is a whopping $15, but it was a rainbow roll on steroids (in a good way).\n\nI didn't care much for the one hour wait at eight o'clock on the Wednesday night I decided to stop by. I guess being rated as SF Weekly's Reader's Best Sushi makes it a highly sought after destination at any night of the week. Unfortunately there's really no place nearby to pleasantly kill time before you get to sit down, unless you fancy yourself a new tramp stamp from the parlor next door. Except for the mango in some of the maki rolls, there's nothing pretentious about this place. Their limited selection of basic fish nigiri sushi and rolls will not disappoint as soon as they enter your mouth. Practically a hole in the wall with bar seating and a couple of booths, your clothes will start to smell like the food if you stay long enough (though nothing was particularly offensive while I was there).

We snagged two seats at the bar and settled in, ordering miso soup and edamame to stave off impending hunger. Being Sushi Zone novices we did not get any of the hot dishes and went straight for the sushi: spicy tuna roll, yellowtail with scallion and mango, unagi, saba and maguro.\n\nMy traditional companion was not a fan of the yellowtail with scallion and mango. As the more adventurous one in our pairing, and a lover of juicy, ripe mango, I thought it was delicious. However, my favorite by far was the spicy tuna roll which arrived studded with avocado - a nice surprise. \n\nOn a misty, cold San Francisco night opt for some of Sushi Zone's hot specialties. From a modest toaster oven comes many delights: baked mussels, shiitake mushroom with salmon and jalapeno peppers stuffed with albacore. Both the salmon and tuna are spreads - chunks of fish in very rich, creamy sauces dolloped on either the shell of a jalapeno or the shiitake cap and allowed to brown. They're inspirational - what else might be possible with a toaster over? I long to know!\n\nOn a busy night, when the sushi chef is a little behind, get some of these hot dishes (made by a different chef). They go especially well with beer. We learned this after envying the orders of everyone around us and finally opting to get some of our own. In future, we'll get the hot stuff at the start of the meal.\n\nDinner for two tonight was potentially the best $70 (that's including tax, tip and beer) I spent on this visit to San Francisco.

Sushi requires a lot of time and patience in fish selection and ingredient preparation, but these all happen before the actual making of the sushi.

So like with so many of the delightful places in SF, Sushi Zone has more reviews than it knows what to do with so why am I adding my two cents? Because I want to ensure that by adding a positive review, SZ continues its good reputation online.\n\nIt's Saturday night and the Husband and I are meeting up with an old college friend of the Husband. We decide on sushi and although Umi tends to be my go-to place, we thought it would be good to try something new. Street parking wasn't as bad as we were expecting but the line at SZ was something else. We waited about an hour for the three of us but they will serve you a drink while you wait if you'd like. So we stood right outside the door drinking our large Sapporos, feeling a little naughty. \n\nOnce we were seated, we were pleased to find that the prices were wallet-friendly. We decided on a sea bass appetizer (it's one of their most popular appetizers - two mussel shells with baked sea bass and mango), a spicy mango salmon maki and a mango hamachi maki along with a 14 piece sashimi combo. The total came out to about $95 without tip and the three of us left quite full and happy.\n\nThe baked sea bass mussel shell was fantastic. I highly recommend it! The sashimi was fresh and the maki were homemade-tasting. I've had more polished sushi but I like the homemade presentation and flavor at Sushi Zone. \n\nWe were kind of squashed up against a group of three guys at the bar and when you're shoulder to shoulder with a stranger, you're bound to become friendly unless you're completely anti-social. The cute old Asian man making all of the sushi was preparing something delicious-looking and I asked the guy next to me what it was that smelled so good. It was apparently his order and the chef apparently overhead me because as he handed my neighbor the plate, he also handed him a small additional plate and nodded to me. It was a small taste for me and the Husband and the Friend! How nice! It was the Chef's Special and I think it was lightly seared tuna.

Well from there we all know the story: this place sits 20 max., the wait was crazy long, a 7 top was ahead of us, my date and I drank loads of nigori... it was all good. We knew what to expect and rolled with the wait and any hiccups.. Besides we drank and ate tapas down the street for most of the wait :)\n\nSo we finally sit, order 3 things: Rainbow roll, Spicy Salmon mango roll, Hamachi scallion roll. Meanwhile the place is full and a 7 top from hell was placing orders left and right, all ahead of ours. The one sushi chef was in the weeds, mainly because the 7 top were shouting loud vulgar comments and ordering and shit ton of food left and right. This place is a victim of their success, so naturally they were not well prepared to take on all the bullshit coming with trying to turnover more numbers than they should be.

Everything tasted amazing, but I think they could fix a few details to make the experience great as well. We didn't have to wait at all like others have mentioned, but I think it's because we arrived at 6:00 on a Thursday.\n\nTo start, we had the stuffed shiitake mushrooms and the stuffed jalape\u00f1os. Both use the same filling, which was this deliciously cheesy, creamy fish mixture. However, the  jalape\u00f1os hadn't been seeded correctly and I got an intense punch of heat in my last bite that was very unexpected and sort of ruined that app for me.\n\nFor sushi, we had the spicy hamachi roll, the spicy tuna roll, and the hawaiian roll. The tuna and the hamachi came first. I wouldn't necessarily use the word spicy to describe them, but they were definitely sweet and creamy. The hamachi had this subtle lime flavor that was really surprising and delicious. The rolls on the end were huge though which made them hard to eat (I hate it when sushi places do this!). The hawaiian roll came later and was this incredible mix of sweet mango, avacado, herbs, and tuna. The macadamia nuts on top gave it a great crunch.\n\nAll things considered, I think the taste made up for everything else and I would definitely visit again!", "author": "Saad A."}

I haven't had phenomenal sushi in SF, but I have had extraordinary sushi elsewhere and I have to rate it based on the entirety of my sushi experience, right?  First of all, there's that \"wow\" factor of the dynamite mussels that are baked and everyone orders them, so they are wafting below your nose while you wait 1.5 hrs for your turn.  Don't buy into that.  Our mussel shells were basically hollowed out; there aren't mussels inside, and it had mostly chopped mango, a sliver of tuna, and a ton of mayonnaise, and it's baked.  Does it make sense to you  to eat that?  I ate it like a hungry hippo because I was starving from the long wait, but... ya know.  Could've done without it.  The baked eggplant sushi, the uni, and the spicy hamachi roll with avocado and scallions were definitely winners. The main thing was the huge chunks of fresh fish/uni they put inside.  The Hawaiian #2, which had mango, hamachi (?), avocado, and chopped macadamia nuts on top was interesting but not really special or flavorful.  The service is good, it has the typical hole-in-the-wall sushi ambiance kind of like Tekka sushi, and they serve alcohol.

It comes freshly prepared with a perfect hint of natural sweetness that coats your tastebuds like a pleasant forgotten memory. In conjunction with the requisite amount of viscosity, it makes for the most delightful treat when ingested prior to the fried shrimp head. I'd gladly devour those shrimp [brain] guts anyday.\n \nDon't even get me started on the mangoes. Luscious, golden food fitting only for gods, this tropical fruit ranges high on my must-eat-on-a-daily list. Sushi Zone has masterfully integrated this natural sugar infested fruit into many of their creatively fabricated rolls. Not being a huge fan of specialty rolls [crouching tiger hidden dragon roll, hot love roll, etc] or anything other than sashimi + nigiri, I surprisingly found myself thoroughly enjoying every bite and more. Unlike the other exceedingly posh Jap eateries, their rolls aren't doused in flavored mayonnaise. If I wanted spicy mayo overpowering my overcooked  rice, flavorless slivers of raw [think stale] fish and additional unnecessary condiments, I would have went to Sushi Bistro or another similar trendy \"sushi\" joint.\n \nIn a nutshell, Sushi Zone = no thrills, zero frills, just good sushi.", "author": "Lisa W."}

Baked with Mangoes and cream sauce that wasn't too heavy or too salty.\nPapaya Unagi- I'm a huge fan of eel, so I thought this would be my favorite, but either the taste of the unagi over powered the papaya or vice versa. I could taste the unagi, but something about the flavor combinations canceled each other out.\nHamachi Roll- Standard, but fresh fresh fish.\nHawaiian Roll (think that's what it's called. I don't remember and they don't have the menu online)- albacore tuna, mango, scallions, macadamia nuts. The best roll that we picked! The ingredients make it seem like an unlikely good combination, but the roll itself was delish. \n\nI like how they serve their patrons. They bring out each item ordered one at a time.

Yes, don't come in at 8pm on a Friday night.\n\nSat around waiting for a seat for what ended up being 2 and a half hours. Was the wait worth it? At that point, nothing is worth it, but if I could do it again, I would.\n\nThe wait gave me plenty of time to learn the finesse and art of making sushi (watching a single person making sushi for the whole restaurant - a management consultant's nightmare) and browse the various yelp reviews for food recommendations.\n\nOnce seated at 10:30pm, ordered the following for 2 people, which was perfectly sufficient for 2 people:\n\n1. Baked Muscles with Spicy Mayo - nothing super special, the muscles were a bit chewy (maybe they over-cooked mine). I would get the Striped Bass over this one.\n\n2. Striped Bass Mango in Mussel Shell - this was my favorite, REALLY REALLY good. You get the soft warm fresh sweet mango lining the inside of the shell and a warm baked sea bass with the consistency of warm pudding filling the rest of the cavity. The combination? Heavenly.  \n\n3. Spicy Hamachi - amazingly fresh fish paired with amazingly soft avocado, just almost melts in your mouth\n\n4. Hawaiian #2 - the ingredients, combinations, and executions are just impeccable. \n\nMy only complaint, is just how incredibly inefficient and non-business savvy the restaurant is. You have the place seating about 16-20 people with only one guy making the sushi. if that's not frustrating enough, the people at their seats love to take their time and order a second round, a third round, or simply just sit in their seats sipping Japanese beer as other customers are crossing the 2 hour mark on their wait time. it's just a tremendous inefficiency that could really be changed for the benefit of the restaurant's profit and reputation and the customers. \n\nHowever, I will say that once sitting down at the sushi bar and the lone sushi maker hand delivered my sushi plate with a smile and a wink, all that frustration went away. That and also you really know that you're getting the consistency of food quality every time you go to this restaurant. I just can't imagine if this guy ever gets sick - hopefully he has trained a few others to deliver the type of quality sushi that he does.\n\nOverall, the sushi was the best I ever had (6 out of 5 stars) which balances out the inefficiency piece (4 out of 5 stars).

The kitchen is right there next to the sushi bar.\nAuthenticity: genuine Japanese chef preparing the rolls right in front of you. menu is relatively no frills but also has some unique Hawaiian influenced rolls.\n\nEverything we ate was pretty delicious from the jalapeno stuffed tuna to the fresh pieces of yellowtail, salmon, and tuna. The albacore and salmon were definitely buttery and melt in your melt. The cuts were generous and tasted very fresh.

Their rolls are creative, but not in an overly done or overly sauced way. You can still taste the freshness of the fish. We ordered: 2 orders baked sea bass, hawaiian roll 2, hamachi mango roll, spicy tuna roll, ikura nigiri, and salmon kama. All of this came out to $48, which is quite a bargain for everything we got! \n\nWe waited about and hour and a half to eat here, but took Muni around SF and did other things during the wait. You can just tell that the sushi chef enjoys what he does. The staff was excellent; although there was a wait, we never felt the need to eat faster nor did we feel rushed by the staff.", "author": "Ruth R."}

The rolls are stuffed with big pieces of fresh fish and the baked sea bass with mango is amazing. The prices are surprisingly low for the quality of the food. There was only one waitress/hostess, but she was really friendly and definitely on top of things considering how busy she was. \n\nThe only downside to this place is that it's super small. We were lucky that we only waited 20-25 min for two seats at the sushi bar, but some people that came in right behind us waited an hour and a half to get sat. You'd better be willing to wait.

This mango was sweet and the flavors go together so well and the subtle salty, sweet crunch of the macadamia nuts is unexpected. Delicious!\nThe sashimi were the strangest cuts- the maguro was cut so thick and the sake sashimi was also cut thick and long-never had sashimi like that and actually prefer a more traditional cut but it was oh so fresh! Didn't care for the flavor of the miso soup- tasted a little smoky. The spicy tuna rolls were phenomenal- the spicy mayo on it was one of the best I've had.\nWe went on a Wed around 6:30pm and waited about 30ish minutes. I notices the wait list got pretty long by about 7pm.\nLove this sushi! It's definitely worth a 30+min wait, however I don't know that I would wait an hour or more.

Here's what i do:\n\nMy secrets to enjoying waiting for sushi zone:\n1. Go by 7:30pm signup and gauge the wait - if it's full, and there are more than 4 names in front of you, perfect, you've got time, especially if you're waiting for a 4-person table!\n\n2. You've got an hour, go to Martunis at Valencia and market, or up the street to the Orbit room or more fun, Kareoke @ The Mint! (but don't eat their sushi!)\n\n3. come back to sushi zone a little buzzed and if your name was called, thats Ok, they'll put you up next if you're reeeeally nice. \n\n4. Enjoy some Saki while you wait, maybe put in your hot-order if they'll let you! =)\n\n5. THE ORDER! (expect to wait anxiously for 30-40 minutes more)\n- Hamachi kama & the muscles are a hot dish, usually served faster than the sushi itself. The kama is a perfect appetizer, flakey soft meat with a sweet tangy teriyaki sauce.\n- Hawaiian #2 roll, albacore nigiri. Their albacore is the best!\n- Spicy tuna or any eel dish my usual.\n\n6. Offer the chef a cup of your saki! At the pace he's going, he needs it!\n\n7. The bill - always $30-40 less what i would end up paying anywhere else for half the quality. Can not be beat!\n\nARIGATOU!!!", "author": "Pierre V."}

Luckily we got to the restaurant early enough to beat the crowd-word has it...the wait can be VERY long. \n\nGood prices at Sushi Zone with rolls ranging around $6.  Our order consisted of:\n\n*Stuffed Jalapenos-no good.  This was an opened jalapeno that cradled some sort of mixture that tasted like tuna salad to me.\n*Baked Bass-I expected something different.  Served on a shell with mangos.  I didn't see what the hype was about this one.\n*Hawaiian Roll #2-this was ok.  But it's one of those rolls where you have so much going on...the fish is no longer the star of the show\n*Assorted Nigiri-I felt better about this.  For the most part, fish was fresh and clean (except for one).  My favorite was the hamachi and salmon.  \n\nOverall, Sushi Zone is not the best sushi I have had, but the prices are real good here.  If I ever come back to Sushi Zone, it will only be for nigiri or sashimi.  I will come early because I do not believe a 2 hour wait is worth it.  I will bring cash because that's all they take.  I will avoid most of the things on the front page of the menu.", "author": "Maybelline C."}

This is probably the best sushi experience I've had to date. \n\nIf you get nothing else here you MUST try the baked mango sea bass! It was unbelievable, simply divine.

I loved the combination of the sweet and salty. It was a real treat. \n\nThis place is incredibly compact and seats next to nobody.

Took us about 10 minutes to get seated at the bar, which was a surprisingly short wait for such a tiny place!\n\nWe shared:\n*Baked Sea Bass w/ Mango appetizer: These are delightfully delicious!  They come in servings of 2 in mussel shells so you probably want one serving for yourself to satiate the intense craving for more that immediately follows after inhaling the first one.  The warm mango was a little strange at first, but you get used to the texture quickly.\n\n*Baked Mussels appetizer: Reminds me of Dynamite, the Japanese appetizer.  I liked that the mussels were diced so they were easier to eat.  This appetizer is also served in mussel shells, which made the following process incredibly efficient: bring shell to mouth, tilt, slurp, and repeat.\n\n*Yellow Tail Kama: Fresh, buttery, delicate fish with a rich, fatty flavor.  The collar was not out of this world, but it definitely exceeded my expectations in quality.\n\n*Hawaiian roll #2 with white tuna, mango, and chopped macadamia nuts: What a unique roll!  This roll embodies the concept in which opposing forces, when thoughtfully combined, can elevate individual ingredients far beyond the levels they would reach if served alone.  The combinations of salty and sweet from the fish and mango and soft and crunchy from the rice and macadamia nuts made my mouth dance with joy!  Juxtaposition at its very best!\n\n*Spicy Hamachi w/ Jalapeno roll: Delicious and fresh, but I wish it was spicier!\n\n*Papaya and Unagi roll: Papaya and Unagi are two of the few things I dislike eating so when my friend suggested that we order this roll, I smiled politely, agreed to ordering it and silently grumbled to myself.  Shockingly, it was actually pretty good, although I will still never order it for myself.\n\nOverall, Sushi Zone is great for its food, but not for its service or atmosphere.  The sushi chefs never once spoke to us even though we were sitting at the bar.  Come to think of it, they didn't speak to anyone at the bar during our meal!  Service is also slow as they are very understaffed, and the kitchen appliances, which can be seen from the bar as they have an open kitchen, desperately need to be replaced.  They are using TOASTER OVENS to cook fish and appetizers!", "author": "Jen Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-24", "description": "Awesome, awesome sushi experience. My friend took me here because she comes to this spot every time she comes to the city from the East Bay. I thought maybe she was in love with a mediocre sushi spot since there probably isn't good sushi in her area. Boy oh boy am I grateful she brought me here!!\n\nWe arrived around 7ish on a Friday and the placed was packed and the little white board already had two columns of names, and we were near the last of the list. Thankfully I wasn't too hungry at the time because we waited a total of nearly two hours. Good thing there is Orbit Room across the street and Destino Pisco Lounge nextdoor-ish because we worked up a good buzz and enjoyed the sushi even more.\n\nThings you must order:\n- Baked Mussels: not your average sushi boat baked mussels, these are truly something special baked in a rich, creamy, spicy sauce that isn't so thick that it makes you feel gross like other baked mussels you mighta had. Plenty of mussel meat. Baked Sea bass was just okay (disappointingly cuz I love Sea bass) because IMO there was too much mango, too little sea bass.\n- Spicy Hamachi: jalapeno, sprout, citrusy goodness! Plus, I love hamachi.\n- Hawaiian Roll #2: When I came back the second time, I thought my bf would love this roll and I was right. Perfectly ripe mango, nice pieces of tuna, and crunchy crumbly rich macadamia nuts. I usually dislike mango/macadamia nut rolls at other sushi places, but my oh my this was sooo good! Not too sweet because it didn't have a ridiculously sweet sauce drizzled all over it like most sushi places like to irresponsibly dress rolls with.\n- And the roll with unagi and avocado (its names evades me at the moment, Rock and Roll?) Super simple and a staple roll at any sushi spot, but some how Sushi Zone master makes it taste so good.\n\nI think this place is reasonably priced for such delicious sushi, but please come with plenty of cash because you will probably want to keep ordering more, and more and then more sake and more sake on repeat.\n\nFinal Words: Sushi Zone offers pretty basic rolls that you can find at any sushi spot... but they have selected a few and perfected each aspect of the roll. The rice, the seaweed, the fish, the flavors. Regular sushi rolls elevated to an extraordinary experience. The service is straightforward, be patient, and respect the sushi chef at work.

The wait is long and even after you sit down it will take some time but I'll basically do anything for delicious food. Sushi Zone really deserves a better name. It sounds so genetic which is why I stayed away for so long. What a mistake. The delicious rolls, sashimi, and nigiris have me kicking myself! \n\nI first tried Sushi Zone two weeks ago before I went on vacation in Florida. My bf and I always have to get our sushi fixes before trips because it's so hard to find a good sushi place when you're traveling. We almost ordered every roll but here were some of my favorites:\n\nThe Hawaiian #2 - is similar to the Hawaiian. It just depends on if you like albacore or tuna better. Huge macadamia nuts and mango pieces make this taste like you really are in Hawaii. So good.\n\nPapaya Unagi - This was just mouthwatering. I never thought papaya and unagi together but I'm sure glad Sushi Zone did. I know I'm ordering this one every time I come here!\n\nSpider Roll - The tempura was perfect. Sometimes it's battered too thickly or it's BREADED and fried (yuck!) but this one was light and crisp. The crab was so fresh, you could taste the guts and juices. I LOVE IT. \n\nRainbow Roll - Each piece was wrapped with a beautiful piece of sashimi. That's awesome. Best rainbow roll ever!\n\nSpicy Scallop - The sushi chef cut nigiri quality scallops to mix into the spicy mayo for this roll. It was sweet, fresh and had just a hint of spice. \n\nThe Sashimi combo plate was a great value too at just $20.50. I also tried the famous baked sea bass with mango. It was good but I'd rather have ordered more rolls! I was actually sad to leave SF the next day since the night before I found such a great sushi joint.

How many cliches can you fit into 15 mins?  If I saw a drag queen running down the street, it would have rounded out the count.\n\nWe were not the first in line.  But we did get the last booth.  Nee-ner-nee-ner-nee-ner.  Nothing makes me feel more entitled than observing the groups of people who showed up after us with children in tow.  Young children.  People who were told that the wait was more than an hour.  Young children who are then forced to wait an hour for dinner becuase they have either sophisticated palates or dip-sheep as parents.  It calls for another bottle of hot sake.\n\nWe ordered the baked sea bass mango, hawaiian #2, spicy hamachi roll, spicy salmon mango roll, king california roll, uni, ama-ebi, and albacore nigiri.  The nigiri was delicious.  The portions were generous, the fish was buttery and melted upon contact.  The uni was caressed in a leaf of shiso and as golden as a solid gold ingot from the Aztec temples.  \n\nThe rolls ranged from good to weird.  Weird in a jive ass way.  The King California Roll was good, but the real crab was real dry.  It was either from a can or purchased in bulk and processed.  I've become such a snoooooob since I've learned how to efficiently rip the flesh from shellfish.  It's a skill that has been good on my wallet because I will no longer accept machine imitations.  Snob, I know.  Deal with it.\n\nSpicy Hamachi had a lot of flavor.  The spicy mayo was creamy without being slimy and overpowering the already flavorful hamachi.  \n\nSpicy Mango Salmon: I think my testate shriveled up and curled back inside my body when i ordered this.  No good will come of a name that includes both \"Mango\" and \"Spicy.\"  The sushi purist inside of me committed seppuku and hung himself out to dry.  Whereas the dumb blond in me said, \"oooooh, mango!\"\n\nBaked Sea Bass Mango - this was the worst thing I've ever had to sit in front of.  It beats out \"foam\" as the stupidest idea for food, style and taste.  You get two mussel shells (but no mussel) which have a layer of diced mango on the bottom, a small sliver of white fish (maybe it's sea bass, maybe it's halibut, maybe it's chicken!) and then frosted over with mayo.  Baked.  Sprinkled with Masago egss.  Not even tobiko.  It was masago.  I think.  For $6.  \n\nThe food would have earned a 4 star rating.  But the service was ridiculously slow.  It took an hour and a half to get our food.  I was late for class.  The sake was watered down and rather expensive for hot sake.  The miso soup had a strange smokey tangy flavor.

Expect a long wait if you get there after 6 pm, and possibly being turned away if you arrive too late.  The menu is simple, but the shock came in when I saw how cheap it was. For around 3 rolls and 2 orders of sushi, it came out to around $24 which was pretty amazing in SF.  The fish was fresh and definitely not skimped on.\n\nI think I found my go-to sushi place if I crave rolls.

Finally!! \nAt Sushi Zone, the style is very simple.  3 people run the place- a front of house (server/busser/hostess), a guy making rolls/cutting sashimi, and an in-between baking apps (like the baked mussels and bass- both fantastic).  The sake sashimi (salmon) is amazing.  The spicy hamachi roll is wonderful.  The rainbow roll is overwhelming.  Playing its simple roll, the menu is relatively limited.  Quite sufficient if you're not high maintenance when it comes to your sushi.  Seemingly boring rolls spring to life in your mouth- tremendous flavor/freshness.\nI have tried 3 times to dine in this shoebox, twice successfully.  This place is all about patience.  If you don't have it, don't bother patronizing this place.  \nThe quality of fish and the cleanliness of the establishment (their health inspection card is on display) are the major reasons for the high ranking.  The wait list doesn't tell the story- see how many people are actually waiting in/around the restaurant.  When dining at Sushi Zone, remember to bring your necessary virtues and appreciate the process as it was intended.  \nCash only- though it's not as expensive as most sushi dinners of lower quality.", "author": "c d."}

Ace and I found parking literally across the street on Market, of course had to jaywalk but it was certainly worth it, if a cop busted us. \n\nWe sat right infront of the bar, two corner seats. Ordered a large Sapporo to share and a large hot sake for starters. This place seats 18 people and we were lucky enough to arrive early before the dinner crowd started to trickle in. \n\nThis cozy hole in the wall served to be the most best kept secret in SF and I kid you not, the food speaks for itself. Be aware of the long wait for food, from what I was told...it's actually the same kind of long wait if you were in Japan. \n\nWe had the baked mussels. These are mouth watering! I could eat six of these! \nWe also had the two hawaiian rolls with salmon and hamachi (with mango and generous amount of crushed mac nuts), the unagi with papaya, the salmon skin roll, etc. I absolutely loved the unagi with papaya roll -- this was refreshing and delicious. \n\nI would recommend this place to anyone and definitely coming back next month!", "author": "Mika D."}

You wait for a seat.  You wait for food to come.  If you are seated at the bar, you must resist the temptation to look at the food that arrived for the person next to you.  For many minutes, you ponder if your sushi will look something like the sushi in front of another person down the bar.\n\nNow, is it worth the wait?  Not so much for me.  The place does sushi rice right and the fish is fresh.  The saba has a unique texture as if there was some sort of ever-so-slight steaming.  No fishy taste, no watery flesh, and a density approaching chicken breastesses.  It's quite wonderful.  The cucumbers are the crunchiest I've ever had.\n\nI would recommend it for the sushi traditionalist, but traditionalists might find the sight of baked mussels and macadamian nut coated rolls too much.  I do and I eat rolls with some crazy made-up names.\n\nTake a girl camping to see what she's like in the rough.  Then, take her here to see how she handles an excrutiatingly long wait for food.

We were seated promptly, but a line soon formed out the door. In the past, I've had to wait up to 2 hours, so be careful about when you go!\n\nThe sushi is good, and consistently fresh. The key term here though, is sushi VALUE., It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but it's some of the best sushi I've ever had for the price I had it at. At $5-6 for a decently ornate roll (I'm not talking california roll here), it's hard to beat. In mathematical terms, where deliciousness is measured in yums and price measured in dollars, the yums per dollar ratio is perhaps greater then any other sushi restaurant I've been to in SF.\n\nRecommend: anything with Mango, such as the hawaiian rolls. Mango roll for 6 bucks? Sushi Zone is making Hawaiian's cry that they don't live in San Francisco. Tropical tears. \n\nAlso, the spicy rolls were done well. I'm forgetting the name of the roll right now, but I'm pretty sure it was a spicy roll and had lime in it. Their technique: they slice a lime into an impossibly thin piece, and it brings just the right amount of sour/fruity taste to make it a unique sushi creation.", "author": "James W."}

But I came to sushi zone for sushi not baked bass. \n\nWe started with the Alaskan roll made with salmon, avo and scallion. the roll was huge, filled with way too much soggy rice, and avocado. The avo over-powered the rest of the roll.  I couldn't even taste the fish. \nThat's ok we thought, avocado does over-power. Maybe it was just one roll. \n\nWe then our striped bass and albacore nigiri. The fish looked like it had been cut by a dull knife with jagged edges on it's side, and to be honest it was subpar fish. It seemed like they remidied that by giving you a lot of it. The fish was hanging off the riceball reminding me that this was quantity over quality. \n\nThe spicy hamachi roll came out out and it was tasty. The jalapeno and lime was a nice change but I can't emphasis how much the roll lost by having horrible rice and loose rolls. It was bittersweet, as if you morn a roll that could have been amazing but turned out mediocre. \n\nNext came a spiced scallion, and a yellowtail roll. The rolls tasted the same, the fish bland. \n\nWhen I see a 4+ star rating I know the sushi will melt in my mouth. What I was left with instead was buffet quality Sushi.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-07", "description": "I've said time and again that once every so often, along comes a restaurant that creates a new standard for a specific food item, or cuisine.  \n \nFor example -  for brunch, I measure any restaurant serving breakfast items against my favorite brunch joint - Fifth Wheel in San Leandro.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/fifth-wheel-san-leandro#hrid:NdW9Y2eTUawSBQWl3cCmlQ\n \nFor gorging on meats, I measure it against my favorite red meat joint, Fogo de Chao.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/fogo-de-chao-beverly-hills#hrid:uk02t8IVKw4LXdXKQVXq4Q\n \nWhen it comes to sushi - I measure everything against my favorite Ino Sushi.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/ino-sushi-san-francisco#hrid:Lyn6QgsDGQ4njA08juAGAQ\n \nMy old friend from high school swears by this place, so I made a true effort to try it out.  I am VERY reluctant to try new sushi joints as I am invariably disappointed when comparing it to Ino, but on this night, it was 9 pm and Ino was closed.\n \nI thought Ino Sushi was small.\nSushi Zone is TINY.  I can see now why everyone is reviewing how long they waited -  my bedroom is larger than this restaurant.  Lucky for us, because we got there at 9:30 PM, we did not have a wait and got seated at the two remaining seats at the otherwise still full bar.\nIt's extremely casual (almost a dive, if you will) and doesn't have a Japanese feel at all, except the entire staff is Japanese.  As \"hole in the wall\" as it felt, it looked clean.\n \nThe staff was friendly, and the chef, while I don't believe it was Aio-san on this evening, was nice enough.\n \nLet's get to the fish.\n \nFirst - my friend recommended the Omakase here, but I was politely informed that they do not do Omakase because they are just too busy.  Perhaps they just do Omakase for my friend Kip and his wife - I am not sure, but even sitting at the bar, it was not chef's choice - we ordered what we wanted and said to include whatever is fresh and NOT COOKED at all  Read my Ino Sushi review and you will see how I feel about getting Omakase.\n \nFirst came the maguro, sake, and hirame.  The tuna and salmon were totally underwhelming at best, the hirame was good.\n \nThe scallop nigiri was quite outstanding - as well as the hamachi-kama we ordered.  Both fish were extremely fresh.  \n \nHaving read some of the reviews, I knew I had to at least try a roll of some sort, and opted to order the hamachi spicy roll.  While I didn't find it spicy, I had  to admit this was a tasty roll - I loved the lime aspect of it and the hamachi was fresh.  Other items, like uni, were good.  Rob loved the tataki seared tuna - and I was not a big fan.\n \nWe ordered plenty of nigiri, and we were stuffed silly by the end of the meal.  \n \nNow, I started to hear the theme song to Jaws, as we requested the bill.  The cost of the meal would be what would determine whether this was a 3 or 4-star experience.\n \nRob spends an astronomical amount of money on taking me out to dinner.  While we both enjoy a good In N Out Burger, we also both appreciate luxury dining at any cost, so long as the food and experience made it worthwhile.  \n \nHaving eaten at Sushi Zone - I knew what I was willing to pay for this experience.  I also knew at which price point this dinner would have become a waste of good money.\n \nWe received the bill and for $100 total - including tip - Grace and Rob were full (read: we ate our usual enormous amount of sushi).  This breaks down to $50 per person, including a small bottle of cold sake (which, by the way, was good stuff).\nNow this was truly an economical meal.\n \nExcellent sushi, I think not.\nBut we ate without crinkling our nose at anything or having to spit anything out, and more than once, we were impressed by the quality of SOME of the fish (though not all), and while the rice is not to my liking in taste or size (a bit too much rice), it was all in all pretty good.  \n \nThe selection of rolls, however, was impressive - and the one roll we did try was very good.  \nThis was also the first time in my life that I have entered a sushi restaurant and ended up being the only Asian party in the restaurant - which explains the popularity of the rolls at Sushi Zone.\n \nFor most of the food, I would only give it 3-stars overall.  The ambiance of the place, while cool in an eclectic sort of way, is also not what I want when I am opting to eat Japanese food - BUT, you factor in the price and Sushi Zone just kind of makes sense.\n \nWill I be back?\nI'm not entirely sure.  I am the type of person who'd rather spend double this amount and eat amazing sushi at Ino rather than eat \"just good\" sushi, but then again, Ino's last seating is at 8:30 pm (if that), whereas Sushi Zone seats until 9:30 pm.  \n \nMost definitely, though - I am not one to wait 2 hours to eat here as many yelpers have claimed to have done.\n \nNo way, no how.", "author": "Grace K."}

After perusing Yelp while riding the BART into the city, we came across the reviews for Sushi Zone.  \n\nFirst of all, people are not exaggerating when they say you will have to wait... and wait... and wait to eat at this restaurant.  However, if you have the time and the patience, I think it's worth it!   Sushi Zone has barely any waiting space (one small bench and a few seats against the far wall), so after writing your name on the list you are likely going to have to wait outside.  There were about 8 people listed ahead of us and not realizing the amount of time we'd have to wait, we stuck it out for 30 minutes.  Then we realized that there are only 16 seats (yup, we counted!), did some quick math, and decided to wait at a nearby bar for awhile.  We came back after an hour and still waited another 30 minutes before we were finally seated.  So total waiting time: 2 hours.  \n\nYou may at this point be wondering why I still gave Sushi Zone a 4 Star rating after such a long wait.  The answer?  The food.  \n\nI cannot remember the exact names of the rolls we ordered, but I'll try to do some describing.   We both started out with miso soup and tea, which both came very quickly.  Then, after seeing table after table consuming these delicious looking baked something or others in shells, my sister and I decided we just had to try them.  After 30+ minutes of examining the menu, we deduced that they were baked striped sea bass with mango.  And they were as tasty as they looked!  There is a reason why everyone orders them and if you go to Sushi Zone, you should too!\n\nIn addition to the soup and bass, we also ordered a tuna roll (very fresh!), a hibachi (?) roll (yum!), and one more which I cannot for the life of me remember right now.  Just know that it was delicious and you can't go wrong with any of their rolls!  \n\nTo top off the delicious cuisine, a final element Sushi Zone has going for them... their prices!  The rolls are relatively inexpensive for how many pieces (6) you get!  The typical range is between $5 and $8, with a few more expensive specials.  The total for my sister and my bill was under $40 with tip!\n\nSo, to sum up this review... Sushi Zone is well worth the wait.", "author": "Suzanna F."}

Be sure either to get there early- even before it opens.  But most good restaurants in SF have a wait anyway.  People line up anywhere from 15-30 minutes before it opens. I've been lucky a couple of times where the timing was right or if there was only two of us. \n\nBesides that, the food is fantastic.  I'm a big fan of just sashimi- not the rolls, the baked stuff, or even the rice- just fish, and it is delicious here.  There's a sashimi platter to share and it's well worth it.  There's a dish with thinly sliced yellowtail and jalepeno that is delicious.  As a filler though, I do enjoy the rolls that are topped with macademia nuts- adds a  little texture to it. \n\nGreat food, good prices, and fun atmosphere- the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the wait.", "author": "Thao T."}

If not for the long wait to get seated, the long wait to put in our orders, and the long wait to receive all of our food, I would have been happy to give this place more stars.\n\nWhat everyone says is true:\n- fish is fresh.  The honey and I had some really amazing, completely un-stinky, super fresh buttery sweet delicious uni here.  Incredible.\n- the wait is long.  We spent an hour waiting to be seated, and an hour waiting for our food.  We had the bad luck of getting seated right after a group of 7 (crammed into one of the booths), and the chefs decide to make all of the food for one table at a time.  We spent close to three hours at Sushi Zone overall, waiting, waiting, eating, waiting, waiting.\n- there is really only one server.  She is a nice lady, but she is very busy.  We watched our potential counter seats sit there uncleaned for close to twenty minutes, until she was able to wipe it down for us to sit down.  Our spot was almost poached by a single older dude, but the waitress is good about regulating the waitlist.  That was nice, because I'm not so nice when my blood sugar gets really low...\n\nOverall, while some things were surprising and delicious (uni, watching the head chef mix together the rice just so, listening to Bob Marley on the sound system), I don't think I'd venture back.  This is more of a sushi-beginner place, with lots of rolls and a basic selection of fish.  It's a shame though, because I feel like the chef has the chops to do a lot with fancier cuts of fish...Most customers order lots of rolls and dunk liberally into soy sauce.  (All the more reason the uni was so surprising!  We ordered after we saw the chef put together an order for another table.)\n\nThis is a decent neighborhood spot, but not a sushi destination.

Attempt #1 ended in failure after waiting for an hour with no table in sight. Weep not, dear friends, for we knew what we were getting into. To get into this place is like a mission in itself. \n\nTonight we only had to wait for an hour before finally being seated. The place is small and packs in a few parties. We ordered some nigiri, seaweed salad and a few rolls. \n\nSeaweed salad - tastes as delicious as anywhere I've had seaweed salad. I've either been lucky or seaweed salad is always delicious. I do hope it is the latter of the two.\n\nRolls - the spicy mussel roll (with cilantro & lime) sounded much better on paper than it did on the tastebuds. Although I had just come down from an artichoke roll, so it tasted more vinegary than I would have liked. Shame. The california rolls had chunks of crab, and the spicy tuna was heavy on the wasabi but mighty tasty going down. \n\nNigiri - have to say that this was the star of the night. We had salmon, tuna and yellowtail and all were fresh as they come - I see from other reviews that others were not so lucky, which is a shame, as what I had tonight was delicious. \n\nI have to admit that I am not sure I would be willing to queue up every night to go here, but I definitely enjoyed what i had here tonight. It is cash only, but there is an ATM machine a couple of doors up on Market that is within jogging distance. \n\nOh yeah and when they say this place is on Market? Such a lie!

There are only two booths that hold 6 people max if you squish, so waiting for those are a huge pain (what our group had to go through...). Huge pain = 2 hours w/o breaking a sweat.\n\nFirst Impressions: 3/5. I really did not like the name... but had high hopes because quite a few friends had been here and claimed they loved it (even the hipstery ones). The location was also pretty awkwardly hidden, but that's something that I knew i had to deal with regarding all places in SF. I did like how intimate the setting was though. It even felt casual & secluded when inside despite being so popular w/ its the roughly 800 reviews already written on Yelp.\n\nDecor/Ambiance: 4/5. My first impression was a 3/5 because everything did look very average, but I could honestly see myself going to this place quite often at every chance I got, so based on my preferences of the ideal sushi bar, I added another star. It's cramped, but things seem all the more fun that way in the city I've found. The interior isn't sparkling new or anything, but I really appreciated the down-to-earth, humble feel. It's probably not what I'd recommend for a first-date kinda place (especially w/ the long wait on most times), but it's almost a great hole-in-the-wall discovery if SF weren't so hipstery to know about it already, haha.\n\nService: 4/5. Just from my first visit, I could tell everyone working there was old-staff. The way they communicated, greeted old customers... everything was very fluid and everyone was well-trained, so there weren't any mess-ups at all. There was only one waitress too, and she was able to spot that I was a newcomer and immediately guide me to their little whiteboard of sign-ins. Throughout our wait, she would also check on us from time to time and apologized for the wait even though they really didn't have to. I always appreciate service a lot more when the staff is still able to respect customers despite the unwavering stream of success. It's good karma if anything else! During dinner, the waitress was also experienced enough to tell us that we probably had not ordered enough food for the group, and she was right on the money. Had she just written our orders down and let the events fall as they would, we would've either left hungry or be forced to wait a while for just one more serving. I appreciated that she didn't force it on us, but casually brought up the idea to let us decide for ourselves. The staff at Sushi Zone definitely made me want to come visit again, support their business, and become a regular.\n\nFood: 4/5.\nBaked Bass Appetizer (Mango, Spicy Mayo, & Fish Eggs, $6.50): 4.5/5. This was definitely unlike anything I'd ever had at a sushi restaurant, and I've been to so many. The texture was so smooth and it was served in such a unique way... no wonder it cost so much!\nRolls. The only slight disappointment was that the rice didn't taste as fresh as it could've been, but for a busy restaurant, I understand this is all about timing sometimes. The presentation for most rolls was also a bit muted, but I know they're not looking to seriously WOW people with art and whatnot... that's not what they're going for and definitely not their first priority.\nSpicy Tuna: 3/5. This was probably the 2nd most average thing ordered but a necessity for a few friends to order anyway.\nSpicy Himachi: 3/5. Nothing too special... the 3rd most average?\nSpicy Mango Salmon: 2/5. This was the most average thing we ordered, but we just chose it under pressure when the waitress hinted we didn't order enough. I wouldn't recommend this.\nHawaiian Roll #1 (Tuna, Avacado, Scallion, Mayo Sauce w/ Macadamia Nuts): 4.5/5. I loved this one! What a breath of fresh air it was to even be able to choose something seriously different and unexpected. Ok, maybe it's because I haven't been to Hawaii, but this was delicious. I'm definitely going to try the HR#2 next time I visit.\nPapaya Unagi: 4/5. Also very unique and definitely worth a try too. It's amazing how complimentary papaya can be to bbq eel, flavor and texture-wise. It took me a while to wrap my head around this one in a good way!\nSpider Roll: 3/5. This was a bit dry (rice & soft shell crab), and I was left with the unfortunate task of eating one of the end-roll pieces where the crab head and legs were sticking out. I have arachnophobia so this was a big feat (it seriously looked like a spider was crawling out of both ends...), but I took one for the team because I think everyone else in my party had arachnophobia, haha.\n\nOverall: 4/5. While many of the rolls are just rated 3/5, I'd still give them another chance, and this says a lot because we waited for about 2 hours! Realistically, this place isn't worth the 2 hour wait, but on SF terms, I'd wait an hour for it assuming waiting 30min is normal for most restaurants during dining hours.", "author": "F C."}

Heart-stopping.\n\nThe sushi here is so incredibly good that I can't remember much else from the 2+ hours we spent around the tiny hole-in-the-wall on a Tuesday evening. We put our names down at around 6:30pm, sat down at the bar around 7:15pm and got our food about 7:50pm. Patience is a virtue.\n\nBut sweet Science, the food is positively, unequivocally and ludicrously excellent. The fresh tuna sashimi (maguro) was some of the best I've had in my life (and I've had a lot of sushi, though never been to Japan), the salmon was tender and savory and the wasabi doesn't mess around--completely clean sinuses and ample eye-watering on the first bite.\n\nThe spicy mango salmon roll was surprisingly wonderful and a welcome departure from the typical sushi fare. Even the old standby California roll (though with real crab) was very tasty and worth every penny.\n\nOur waitress (the only one) was pleasant and friendly, chatting with us for a few minutes after things settled down a bit. There are precisely 8 seats at the bar (5 on one side and 3 on the other side of an L shape) and 4 seats at each of two booths, giving a grand total of 16 dining seats, which are constantly filled.\n\nOn top of all that, the prices are entirely fair for sushi--not nearly as much as we've paid for \"nice\" sushi elsewhere, but the quality is among the best.

My gf's tuna/mango/mayo was original, but what's the use of putting mayo in it?  My friend's mussel/avocado/scallion maki roll was awesome.\n\nGreat place if you crave for some creative sushi but, be warned: your patience will be wildly challenged by the long waiting time, which is inversely proportional to the restaurant size and staff's pace.

First of all, they open at 5pm and the entire place only fits about 15-20 people MAX. I arrived at ~5:10pm and the place was filled with a 45min wait time. Seeing as we came specifically to try this place out, we waited 45mins and were seated at the bar thereafter (do not come with more than 3 people ~ you will never get seated!) \n\nThe menu is relatively small but the specials change all the time! (well they ARE daily specials! =P ) We got the baked mussels and baked scallops for appetizers which were DELISH as my friend likes to say. It's only 2 peices for ~$3-5 but it was really good. Also, they reuse the mussel shells that the appetizers are served on (eco-friendly!)... I still haven't quite decided whether or not that's a good thing. \n\nThe actual rolls were ~$5-7 for 4-8 pieces. The ingredients are really fresh (ie. the fish) which made the sushi good which in turn made my taste buds ecstatic. The rolls taste more authentic than sushi house or little tokyo and the place feels really authentic (it's as if the 4 employees just came straight from Japan and found a small, rinky dinky place to rent and set up shop). \n\nI doubt you will find another place like this in the city so it's a must try. The rolls here were also unique (a couple used MANGO in their rolls which were REALLY GOOD; highly recommended).

I figured that me and a friend could possibly get seats with little wait at around 5:30, we didn't get a spot until about 6:30 or so. That's 30 minutes after opening, you're already confined to the second shift of customers. So if you want a seat quickly, pretty much come before opening.\n\nIn addition, as there's limited staff (my night there was one chef, one assistant, and one waitress), it means you're going to have to endure another wait for your order to come out after you get your seats. I'm not sure we got our eats until about 7:15 or so.\n\nBut okay, you should know that small places always equal long waits. Is the sushi worth the wait? For me, the answer is a resounding yes. The menu here is a bit more experimental than the standard CA/Rainbow rolls you're probably used to. We tried their papaya/BBQ eel and their Hawaiian #2 (sprinkled generously with macadamia nuts) rolls, both of which worked well! There's no taste like experimental sushi done well.\n\nOh man, and the prices here! So reasonable. I was honestly shocked to see the bill at the end of the night, it was about 30 for a large beer + 3 rolls.

The lines can get incredibly long so showing up to wait before the store opens is a must, especially on weekend nights. If you are showing up with a group larger than six people (as I have before) it will be difficult to get seated at the same table at the same time, so smaller groups fare better here. Plus they refuse to seat groups unless your entire party is present. My vegetarian friends love the avocado and mango roll they make, and my Mom who is super picky about Japanese food absolutely loves this place. I make it a point to always order the baked mussels and either the plum wine or some hot sake with whatever rolls I am getting. This is an adorable little joint that is completely worth the wait but even better when you get seated as they open.

Mine is really uncomplicated; fresh, simple and atypical food that is unpretentious. So I come to Sushi Zone for that. Place sites roughly 15-18 seats max. Opens at 5pm. Its in your best interest to get there for the first round of seating at that time otherwise you're gonna have to wait for another 45-75 mins before getting another seat, depending on how many groups are ahead of you and what kind of pace they're at for eating dinner. \n\nI always order the baked oysters. They're sooo good that I sometimes convince myself that this is how oysters really taste out the water so whenever i eat oysters and they ain't served like this I get mildy disgusted. I know, sucks for me... \n\nAnother favorite that is sure to not disappoint are the Hawaiian Rolls. I mean the main combination of Tuna and Macadamia nuts makes me go crazy. Every bite is causes commotion in my mouth like when the green light hits at the Shibuya crossings in Tokyo. Madness coupled with ear to ear smiles. The sakes are pretty good too. They pretty much keep the same ones in stock so I usually get whatever the waitress recommends. \nHats off to the Taisho that makes all the food. One man makes 90% of the food so you know its going to be consistent every time you go. This is how sushi is made in most intimate sushi bars in Japan anyways.

Everyone has had a moment---a special night at one time or another at a sushi restaurants that transcended a normal dining experience... in fact, it moved them, and goes on to permanently define their opinion of the place. In a way, the restaurant becomes like family: forever in your good graces, and forgivable, for even the most serious of indiscretions... at least on some level. So, now I understand how 5 stars get thrown around with the caveat of 'oh yeah you'll wait forever, but it's cool!' line in their text.\n\nSushi Zone makes you wait... they make you wait, and then they encourage you to drink beers or head across the street for liquor. You're probably buzzed now, because you've been waiting for an hour, and drinking on the street with your friends. Now you've waited close to two hours, and now your hammered, and oh! Now you're sitting down to eat.\n\n\"Oh my God, this is *so* the best sushi I've ever had in the city!\" the drunk girl cheered sitting at the bar.\n\nListen to Dan V on this one, as the fish does come from the same source... it's not your taste buds fooling you, it's the booze glossing the sushi with that magic shine.

Then get lost. This is even more impressive if you were like hours late to the first date because you originally planned on standing him up in favor of doing your taxes. \n2) If there is one remaining chair in the entire waiting area, pour sake all over it instead of into your glass. Insist that you can pour sake into a glass, try again, and pour it on your pants and jacket.\n3) Act like you know what edamame is and have plenty of experience eating it when you don't. Eat it whole. Really scarf it down because you've been waiting for food for a while. Suddenly notice you were supposed to be eating only the beans and not the shells.\n4) If a sushi roll is very large, announce loudly that you can fit the whole thing l in your mouth because you have a huge mouth! (see photo for evidence) Make a mess in the process. In fact, just eschew all table manners entirely.\n\nWays to Impress Your Date:\n \n1) Take her to Sushi Zone. I'm sure it depends on the type of girl you're dating, but I think this is an excellent date restaurant. The sushi was amazing. I usually just like sashimi, but the chef here had some really interesting rolls with ingredients like mangos, macadamia nuts, and jalapeno. The atmosphere is relaxed, and the room is ridiculously small. The wait could be annoying if you are hungry when you arrive, but in general I prefer my dinner dates to proceed at a leisurely pace, so it didn't bother me.\n2) Don't appear to be alarmed that your hot Sushi Zone date is behaving like a rude 5-year-old.", "author": "Liz G."}

The fish was supremely fresh, and the preparation maximized the flavor.  They prepare sushi a bit differently than most places, adding watercress and small lemon or lime wedges to some of the nigiri pieces.  The Rainbow roll was excellent: they make a roll and then cut it into individual pieces and then add full pieces of several types of sushi.  I was particularly impressed with the halibut, which I don't normally like much but which was great.\n\nI am conflicted about the size of the place.  It is the smallest restaurant I have ever been to, with only two tables and no more than 8 seats at the counter.  My group of 4 waited an hour-and-a-half on a Sunday night.  They actually didn't seat us until they were \"closed.\"  And we were not the last group.  There is something cool about going to a restaurant with such attention to your order, but that is still a long time to wait.  On the up side, there is a Peruvian restaurant with a full bar around the corner (Destino), and they were perfectly willing to seat us for cocktails.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-01-16", "description": "I don't often write reviews, but this place has been on my mind for a long while because I've never been able to get beyond the impressions of my first visit.  A couple of years ago, my wife and I waited for 2 hours just to be seated after arriving not long after they had opened.  I can understand having some wait, given the limited amount of seating, but this review addresses my issue with the inefficient operations of the staff that made the wait longer than it should have been.\n\nThe sushi chef was really slow and took his sweet time between tasks.  This wouldn't have been such a bad thing if the place was larger, more comfortable, and didn't have tons of people waiting for a seat.  What's more, while we were waiting, this couple must have sat around for a total of 20 minutes between paying their check and passively wondering to each other whether the waitress was planning to come back with their change.  Additionally, for some reason, this same couple waited until after they had received their change, stood up, and put on their coats before deciding to chat the sushi chef up, even though they had been sitting in front of him the entire time.  And what does the sushi chef do?  He puts down his knife, wipes his hands, and proceeds to engage in idle chatter with them for more than 5 minutes.  You could argue that all the patrons might have already received their orders, but that wasn't true because I distinctly remember that it was only after their conversation ended did the sushi chef conspicuously snap out of it, hastily check his orders, and start hustling to catch up.  The reason this upset me was because either this is the speed he should have been working at the entire time, or he ended up cheating subsequent patrons out of the same quality he had previously put into his work (i.e. long wait AND hastily prepared sushi).  Also, the waitress could have went ahead and cleared the area and seated the next guests, since the couple was standing, but she waited for their conversation to end, as well, before preparing the counter.\n\nLastly, the background food preparer also did his share of contributing to the slow turnover.  I watched as he idly took his time preparing the appetizers (I think they were stuffed mushrooms), put them in a toaster oven, then just stood around until the cooking time was finished.  He then took them out, stared at his burnt appetizers for a long while, and proceeded to throw them away.  It was only then did he begin to prepare their replacements at the same slow, careful pace.  Why couldn't he have prepared more while the original batch  was cooking?  They're probably one of the more popular appetizers.\n\nI've since been here a second time because my wife loves their sushi, which is admittedly delicious.  I got there 10 minutes early, and their door was open, but they refused to let me put my name on the waiting list or sit on the waiting stools because they weren't ready, then proceeded to close the door on me.  I don't remember being impressed by any improvements in their operations after being let in either.", "author": "Lawrence L."}

He has the easy manner of an expert; after rolling them up, he gives the maki nothing more than a single squeeze to get them loosely into shape.  The flavors here are light but heavily nuanced; mango, spices and marinades abound.  The waitress is achingly beautiful.  The albacore is effing delicious.\n\nSushi Zone is the kind of place you go with people who appreciate good sushi.  It may very well take a while to get seated, and once seated it might take just as long to get your food, but it's well worth it if you appreciate the craft and are prepared to have a drink or two while waiting.

Thus, since I came up to San Francisco to spend time with my mom, I decided that it'd be a good idea to find a good sushi joint in the area. From searching through yelp, I discovered a ton of sushi places that not only have a high rating but also a ton of reviews. We settled for Sushi Zone because of its close proximity to the place we were staying at. \n\nThe Good:\n  The quality of the sushi was amazing. I've had better quality only at one other sushi restaurant and since I've tried a bounty of different sushi restaurants, this is definitely a compliment.  My mom and I ordered the Amaebi (Sweet Shrimp), Sake (Salmon), Hamachi (Yellow Tail) Nigiri, some roll that I forgot and the stuffed shiitake mushrooms. The Amaebi was good but definitely didn't have the fresh taste of a freshly killed sweet shrimp. Turns out they keep a bunch of dead amaebi in a box in the fridge. The salmon and the yellowtail on the other hand were as fresh tasting as if they had pulled the fish from the sea minutes before we sat down. It was that good. Not only did the fish melt in our mouths but the size of the fish they put on the rice is ENORMOUS.  The mushrooms were alright and the roll was pretty good...if only I could remember the name of it. \n\nThe Bad:\n  The wait is ridiculous. My mom and I got to the restaurant when the bar was full and we were the next ones up for a spot at the bar. It ended up taking us an hour and 10 minutes to get seated and then another 25-30 minutes before we got our food.  I looked behind the bar and the problem concerning time was clear as day...they only have 1 cook. The other 2 guys back there wait for dishes to come their way so that they can clean them or they wait for people to leave so that they can wipe down the tables. Other than that, they just stand around and watch people eat. Maybe this usually isn't the case but from my experience, it was pretty ridiculous. The chef also takes care of orders one at a time so if you want to get your fill, you better order a lot your first time around! Otherwise, if you decide to order some more down the line because you enjoyed the delicious sushi so much that you needed to have some more, your order will be put after the last order which could mean that you're not going to be getting your second order for a good 25-30 minutes after. \n\nAll in all though, the food was delicious. The fact that the waitress explained to people who came after us that there would be an hour to an hour and a half wait and they still waited shows how good the food truly is here.

We put our name on the list, which seemed not too long, and stood outside. And then we stood some more. And then we collapsed on the sidewalk in exhaustion.\n\nIt took TWO AND A HALF HOURS for us to get a table. Initially, the waitress indicated the wait would be about an hour, but we had to wait for the entire restaurant to turn over twice. Ridiculous.\n\nAnd here's the rub: After you've waited for an hour, you can't leave, because then you've wasted an hour and given up. It's a no win situation. I found myself feeling guiltier and guiltier for losing more hours of my life that I could never get back, and still unable to move from my prime square of sidewalk.\n\nAnd then they called us. And we ordered, and everything was speedy, efficicient, and delicious. It was almost closing time, so a few tables were actually empty and things moved along quite well. The hamachi kama was delicious, as were the rolls. The prices are great and the chef is friendly (although the waitress could barely look us in the eye after spending so much time looking at us apologetically, while never saying 'go somwhere else, you're wasting your time'). This would have been easily a four star sushi experience, if not for the excruciating period of time spend outside, lurking in wait. What total misery!\n\nSo, to recap:\nFour stars for the sushi! Delicious (although most things are when you're faint from hunger).\n\nNo stars for the service or the misery of waiting. It is so not worth your while.

The rest were good, but honestly, I would not say great.

I was not impressed by the quality of the sushi.  It was tasty, but not MIND BLOWING like a few other places I could rattle off.  The first two spicy rolls had an overly strong taste of watercress or shiso and I had to pick some out.  The rolls were not that well constructed and visibility falling apart upon presentation.

We ended up waiting like 45 minutes, and were seated at the bar.  Don't come here with more than 2 people.  You'll be waiting forever.  \n\nOnto the sushi.  The sushi prices were really decent!  You can get about 6 dishes/sushi rolls for about $30-35.  The baked mussels were soooo yummy I wish I had ordered more.  You get 2 pieces for about $3.75.  Don't damage the mussel shells because they re-use them. haha Same thing for the baked scallops.  The sushi rolls were about $5-6/roll, depending on what you get.  Make sure you order everything ahead of time otherwise you'll have to wait a while for your sushi.  The sushi chef likes to get one table's orders out at one time.  \n\nWe tried a lot of the rolls, including the Octopus rolls.  The rolls come with about 6-8 pieces.  They aren't super special rolls like with tons of spicy sauce or the kinds you'd find at Sushi House or Little Tokyo... but there's a few special rolls.

So we were able to order right away, and our food came within 10mins.\n\nAside from all that, I must now mention the food.  I've been to many Japanese restaurants, and I've noticed that a lot of them share menus.  A california roll is standard, but everyone also seems to make \"specialty\" rolls the same way.  For instance, a Rock and Roll, a 49ers roll, a Dragon Roll.  There's probably a sushi roll convention they all go to in order to share these ideas.  Well here in Sushi Zone, it is drastically different.  They do have a Rainbow roll (delicous, by the way) but they also have two Hawaiian rolls, an Indian roll, and more whose names I forgot.  I've never seen the pairing of macademia nuts and tuna before, or papaya and salmon!  It was an amazing experience because the rolls were something I've never encountered before!\n\nIs it worth the wait?  It depends.

It's supposed to be our \"secret place\" b/c it's SO GOOD that he's afraid everyone will flock to it if they find out and we'll have to start making reservations 3 months in advance or some shit.  I disagree.  I say, tell the people.  Share the love. People will come and go as they please, and not everyone will have the same (RAD) tastebuds that we do, but whatev.  This place needs a review.  From me.  Now.\n\nSushi Zone is one of the best sushi spots in San Francisco.  I will lay down and let the MUNI run over me if you think I'm lying.  It's located in a tiny alley off of Market St. and you no doubt will have to wait a while (let's say 45+ minutes) to get a seat in this cozy place (2 booths and about 8 seats at the sushi bar), but when I go with friends, we usually grab the waiting booth or stand by the wall and order a nice cold nigori while we wait. Just put your name on the list and wait your turn, it's okay.  *pat pat*  You'll be handsomely rewarded and it's better than when you were a kid and mommy gave you a cookie.\n\nWhat to order:  OK, for starters if  you look at the pictures posted for this place you'll see the menu.  It pretty much looks like that all the time and doesn't change.  So, if you scan the mouthwatering list pay close attention to these:  For your appetizer, the baked sea bass mango is...*S2*Ysf&(#Rd(%^...sorry, I just had an orgasm from the memory.  It's about $5 each, but SOO worth it when it melts in your mouth...all warm and mango-y...and lovingly placed in an oyster shell.  Get some nigori while you're at it.  I love the unfiltered coldness of this sake- I'm not much of a hot sake person.  \n\nNext comes the main course:  Spicy scallop, spicy hamachi, spicy tuna (are we seeing a pattern here yet, people?  Mama likes it H.O.T.), and the Hawaiian #2 (albacore, mango, and crushed macadamia nuts) all together make a fabulous feast.\n\nThe staff is SUPER friendly and I can't help but want to jump over the counter and hug the sushi chef everytime I leave for making my tummy so happy.  I contain myself, though.  But, whew, does he ever get a make-out session in my mind.", "author": "Amber B."}

So was the Hamachi Nigiri, which I believe was the Hamachi toro (the fatty, belly part) for no extra charge.  The Maguro and Mango roll was also outstanding.  The wasabi was very fresh and super strong, a quality that you'll mostly only find in a small establishment.\n\nThe minuses:\nWe did find small bones in the Saba (mackerel), and the Hirame (fluke) was still a little cold and seemed like it hadn't been properly thawed.\n\nOverall it was a very good experience, but certainly not \"the best.\"", "author": "Shayna N."}

It was good for the most part but I think the wait and the service is not so good. We got there around 5pm and waited for a table for around 40 mins, then waited another hour for our sushi - mind you, there are 2 booths and about 7 seats at the sushi bar...I counted one sushi chef tonight when we were there. \n\nI highly recommend the Eel Papaya Roll. It is definitely one of a kind. We also had the Rock and Roll, The Hawaiian (which was on special), the Tuna Avocado & Mango Roll among other things. They were all very fresh and very good. The price is great too for each roll (ranges from $4 - 9 per roll, with most averaging around $5.50). That is a great price for someone who is used to paying around $15 for a decent roll in the Midwest. I don't know what sushi restaurants are like around here normally but I found that even though the rolls were very tasty, it didn't seem like the best I've ever had. Certainly they have very original rolls but I felt that the menu itself was rather skeletal and that the specials had the better offerings. \n\nThis is definitely a casual place.

It's one of those things where the longer you've waited, the harder it is to walk away to eat somewhere else; as soon as you know it, it's been three hours.  We kept thinking, \"we're going to be seated soon; just hold off for a little bit more.\"  But of course, the people who were seated have also waiting for a very long time, so they felt no guilt taking their time with the meal.\n\nThe food was good, yes, but I can't say I can base it on very good judgment, for by then I've already had too much Sapporo.  The rolls we ordered also looked smaller and not as good as others' orders; another thing about being the last ones there is the chef is probably tired from the day's work.

I am willing to pay $$$$ for top of the line sushi. So, when my friend I visited during a business trip in Mountain View mentioned Sushi Zone, I was game! A search on yelp seems to validate what she heard. Average of 4-5 stars. I was pretty excited so we decided to line up 30 mins before it opened so we can get guaranteed seating and not have to wait. Sure enough we were the 2nd in line and we got the last table. Okay, so far so good. Everyone else who were seated at the bar or the other table were still pouring over the menus so when the waitress came by to asked us what we want do drink, we decided to order.\n\nThings went downhill from there. \n\nEven though we were the first ones to order, we didn't get our miso soup until after everyone else. That totally irritated me. Yes, there's only one waitress so I should be patient right? Nope. The place is small enough, she shouldn't have trouble forgetting. We had to remind her. After the reminder, she served the people waiting for a table their beers first before we even got our drinks and soup! Definitely a no no.\n\nThen the sashimi came. All in all, it was okay. The fish was not bad, but it wasn't as fresh either. It was just okay.\n\nThen the nigiri and rolls came. From what I've read through yelp, their specialty seems to be the rolls so I was pretty excited to try that. When I tried it, I was extremely disappointed. It was bland and I couldn't taste the fish. All I could taste was the sweet mango that came with it. Oh and they gave us the wrong roll. I didn't want to wait longer so we just ate what they gave us.\n\nThen I looked at the nigiri sushi. I thought, okay, this must be why people are raving about this place. Each piece is humongous! I've never seen a cut of sushi that big before! Not only were they huge, they were cheap too! I took a bite and was instantly disappointed. Fish, when really fresh, is supposed to melt in your mouth. If you have to chew really hard, then it's not good fish. I don't know if it was too big, but I found myself chewing a lot before I can swallow the sushi.\n\nSo to summarize:\nPros:\n-Cheap sushi\n-Big cuts of fish\n\nCons:\n-The pace is too small\n-The wait is long if you don't get there before it opens\n-rolls are okay, borderline bland\n-forgetful waitress\n\nAll in all, if you want a cheap sushi place, then you should go here. But if you want quality I suggest you go somewhere else. The amount of time you have to wait is not worth the price.I'm not from SF but if you're ever in LA, try Mori sushi, Sushi Zone, or Urasawa.

For those of you who complain about this....deal with it or leave so that Sushi Zone lovers can take your place.\n\nAlso, please be considerate and do not sit for hours on end so that starving people waiting in line don't have to watch you eat and drink copious amounts of sake.

The sushi was really fresh and wonderful, it was well worth the wait.  For our group of 4 it was perfect, but I am not sure how they could accommodate a larger group if you wanted to sit at a table as opposed to the sushi bar.  Its a small place and it had a good crowd on a Monday night.  Yay for being open on Monday!  The owner also makes Sushi at the High Sierra Music Festival where I first met him.  I was happy to be able to support another live music lover and to have a chance to eat some top notch sushi.  Don't miss the Hawaiian Rolls and anything with mango or papaya is really good  They don't have chicken terriyaki or anything so this might not be the best place to take people who don't like sushi...", "author": "Greg K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-06", "description": "Much has been said about the long wait - to this I'll merely observe that there must be a reason, and it's not just because of the high demand for good sushi, and the low supply of seats.  I think the wait serves as a necessary hurdle to filter out those who are impatient, or who didn't bring cash, or who prefer instant gratification, or who don't know any better.  It's probably not a good idea to bring people who are used to super fast service, or who are deliriously starving.\n\nSometimes I just can't make it to Sushi Zone because logistics prevent me from (gasp!) blocking out an entire evening for dinner.  And that's ok - going without one night makes me appreciate it the next time.  But there are ways to deal with the wait to make it tolerable so you can partake in this gift to San Francisco - no, to humanity itself.  I suggest:\n* enjoy a drink at Martuni's\n* put your name on the list right after work, then go home for an hour (and do whatever you can do in an hour) and come back\n* have a good conversation with your friends\n* take a walk through the Castro\n\nBut please - don't glare at those who are lucky enough to be eating - they had to wait, too, and they usually know enough to not take any longer than they have to.  We're all in this together.\n\nThe fish - whether in the maki or nigiri - has never been less than pristine for me.  My standards were set in Tokyo, at the Tsukiji fish market - I know.  My only quibble is that there is never any fatty tuna on the menu - sometimes I like to splurge.  But that's ok - the bare necessities are what make Sushi Zone shine.\n\nWhat I have enjoyed over and over:\nSea bass mango - what a friend calls 'sea bass crack' - is so fucking good... get it as an appetizer.\nSpicy hamachi maki - julienned jalepeno, lime, and avocado - amazing!\nSalmon skin maki - salty goodness!\nSaba nigiri - my very high mackerel standards are always met here\nSalmon (sake) nigiri - always great (best with slice of lime)\nHawaiian #2 maki - like a party in your mouth and everyone's invited\nSpicy mussels maki - like its hamachi brother above - amazing\nSpider maki - probably the most expensive thing on the menu, and worth it\nBaked salmon w/shitake - I've only had this when I'm sure I won't go without the sea bass crack - very tasty\n\nI've always had excellent service here - and by that I mean courteous, pleasant, and happy to see you.  If you can get there early, great.  If not - it's gonna be ok - sit back, relax, and enjoy the best sushi in SF for the price.", "author": "Marty F."}

Be sure to show up at the door at least 20-30 min. before opening time of 4:30p, or be prepared to wait for 1 of the roughly 15 total seats to open up. This is the smallest operating food establishment I have gone to; it's about the size of a very small studio apartment -- 10 x 20 ft at most (including the bathroom).\n\nThe whole place is ran by a three man team, a hip waitress, lieutenant sushi chef, and the MOST BAD-ASS LOOKING SUSHI CHEF you've ever seen. He wears this bandanna to keep his bangs from flopping over his eyes. The look on his face while he \"creates\" your sushi dish makes you feel like you're watching a ninja work... very focused and disciplined.\n\nAlthough the lack of space may knock some cool points off of this joint, I'd have to say that the food certainly makes up for it. While you are busy sipping on your green tea or sake, you choose from a variety of items on a menu posted on the walls. With the fish so neatly displayed in a refrigerator on the bar, everything is freshly made. For dishes that are heated/toasted, they have just one Hamilton Beach-like home toaster oven. Dishes are all handwashed (I'm guessing a method to maximize space). \n\nIf I didn't know this was a restaurant, I would thought I'd walk into a Japanese person's kitchen.\n\nPROS:\n- Best, fairly-priced sushi I've tasted in Years (Average $30/person)\n- Quick, efficient service\n- Ninja Sushi Chef\n\nCON:\n- SPACE\n- SPACE\n- No reservations", "author": "Carloalexi M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-02", "description": "In response to Sean L.'s review, the wait is long not because the kitchen doesn't know how to work efficiently, but because they really only have one sushi chef,  one who assists when not cleaning or preparing, another who makes the baked goodies, and one waitress. First come, first served. \n\nThis place is pretty damn orgasmic. Be sure to write your name and party size on the white board located near the furthest booth from the entrance. If you don't have the patience to wait or don't like the sush here, I'd hit you with a chopstick, but I won't. Less people means less of a wait. I contemplated writing a review for Sushi Zone. No matter how much I want to share this goodness with the world, wouldn't it be nice to keep this place a secret?\n\nFirst time I came here it was 630pm, put our names down and waited, and waited, and waited till we couldn't wait anymore! FYI, don't come here after 5pm and hungry. It's torture to watch one person or two enjoying their sushi while everyone else is waiting for theirs either sitting or waiting to be seated, and there you are knowing you won't be able to eat for another hour or two. Thank goodness for Hunan Garden next door. Read review on Hunan Garden.\n\nSecond visit, I came here around 5. This time I stayed, and waited about an hour to eat. OMG!!! Sooo gooood! I can understand why people are willing to wait patiently even though the wait isn't so pleasant. I come here religiously and always before they open. Now if I can only do the same with Catholicism. Get here at 5, and there's a line. You could  always put your name down, grab drinks around the corner and come back in an hour. Don't forget the cash!\n\nEverything's pretty dang delish. The Baked Striped Bass w/ Mango comes in 2 pieces- I'll bet you can't just have one! Same goes with the Stuffed Shitake w/ Salmon and the Stuffed Jalapeno w/ Albacore (which I wish were spicy). The Spicy Mussel roll is good but again, not spicy.  The Spicy Mango Salmon, Spicy Albacore, and Spicy Hamachi (I like the slice of lime in this roll) are really good. A popular roll and definitely a favorite is the Hawaiian #2- Albacore, Mango, Macadamia Nuts. \n\nOmg, I'm having withdrawals and it's only been 3 days since I've been here last.", "author": "Audrey B."}

There isn't much to add to all of the other 5 star reviews, but a quick rehash of my experience was amazingly fresh sushi at very reasonable prices, a baked mussel that was a taste sensation and attentive service. One thing I was surprised about was the fact that although this place is tiny, they didn't seem to rush you, and when I ordered an additional sushi roll (2 actually) after my first order they were more than happy to oblige. Two things of note, their oven is a tiny easy bake oven looking thing, which really doesn't matter, but it just makes me laugh.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-04", "description": "The most terrible thing about Sushi Zone: this restaurant will *completely ruin* all other sushi experiences for you.  I cannot go to any other sushi place, as I already know it will never measure up to the luminous and infinite goodness that is The Zone.  Truly the apotheosis of sushi, the Platonic pinnacle of raw (and in the case of that mango hamachi mussel shell niblet of heaven, cooked) fish.\n\nSo it is freakin tragedy that the establishment that would so render all other sushi establishments superfluous (if not an affront) basically makes you a zombie slave to its infrastructural limitations.  Like everyone else has said: it's TEEN-EINTSY (two tables for four and maybe 6 or 7 at the bar), has a staff of three (one waitress, a chef, and a diswasher/rice maker/mussel baker/and more), and a waitlist system that causes endless amounts of anxiety ('course, that could just be the hunger talking).\n\nI understand the frustration that others have expressed about the wait--which is utterly ridiculous and entirely unavoidable--but we regulars put ourselves through this bcs, again: zombie slaves.  It is the best fucking sushi EVER, and some of us love sushi that much.  So here are some rules we've come up with to better manage the experience:\n\n1. Eat something before you go.  Seriously.  It will be two hours before you eat again, so pick an appropriate meal for your digestive pace.\n\n2. SZ opens at 5 pm.  You need to show up sometime around 4:40 pm to secure a place in line that will assure you seating among that first batch of diners.  Do not be surprised if there is already a queue when you get there.  Use that information to assess how much earlier you have to arrive next time.\n     NB: if you miss first seating (this is not an actual term, it's just how I think of it), you *might* be able to pare down your wait time if you arrive some time around 6:45 and get your name on that list pronto.  I've never tried this strategy, but it's one I've thought about after watching the ebb and flow of the dinner crowd.\n\n3. If you got seated at 5 pm, you will eat around 6:30.  Yup.  Hope you had that suggested meal.\n\n4.  Although you may not be able to help the hunger-induced cross-eyed grimace on your face, try not to glare at those seated.  Likewise, I *completely* understand the urge to linger at your table--finally getting seated feels like a darwinian victory--but just try not to be too gloaty about it.  Someone might eat you, and you could hardly blame them.\n\nI disagree with the reviewer who said SZ becomes more and more inefficient as the night wears on.  On the contrary, given their staff and space constraints, I constantly marvel at the well-honed efficiency of the organization.  The three of them NEVER STOP WORKING, and working HARD, and yet they are always pleasant and courteous and the food and drink come out just as fast as they can.  (90 minutes?!?  Um, again, remember the constraints.)\n\nIt's true that The Zone is not for everyone, and you really have to be ready to take in ALL aspects of that dining experience.  But if you know what you're getting into, and can prepare for it, you will be rewarded with sushi nirvana.  Get the spicy tuna, mango hamachi, and the Hawaiian #1 (oh god yess, the Hawaiian #1) and tell yourself your evening would have been a boring one anyway.", "author": "V. m. g."}

We came 40 min before opening time, at 420. we were the first ones in line and food came promptly because of this. when the resturant opened at 5 there was already 4 more parties behind us. they take orders and serve based on order arrived, which is very fair if you're the first party, not so very \"fair\" if you're the last person in line ^^. \n\nduring my family and I's one hour eating time, 6 more couples signed up on the clipboard list, were told there would be an hour or more wait, in which they walked out the door....to wander around the neighborhood for an hour or so before their table was ready. theres a lot of mango related items on the menu, and like others before me recommended, be sure to try the baked mussels and seabass, both of which are served in large mussel shells. the baked mussels and seabass are both topped with a delicious creamy mayo-like sauce and little cut up pieces of mango. the baked mussels are just pieces of cut-up,mussel chopped up, with a delicious sauce on top and the delicious, delicate flavor of mussel juice which you can slurp out of the shell along with the mussels themelves. sorry did that sound weird? in my head it sounds delicious. dont order sashimi (which is plain raw sushi slices with no rice or toppings) b/c in my opinion the price isnt worth it;it tastes like sashimi at every other sushi place in sf - without the heavy price tag. be wise and adventurous and try their unique tiems. we got t 4 rolls - the only name i remember was the hawaiin roll b/c of the unique topping of macademia nuts on top - a generous portion of crushed macadamia nuts. im generally not a fan of mac nuts but the rolls were GOOD. i would definitely come back if not for the price - i dont like spending a lot of money on food.\n\n one star was taken off for the prices - but i would definitely come back here again.\n\nUPDATE: came here again. this place is no joke. Fairly cheap (for japanese food) if you know what to order. once again, Dont order sashimi unless u have a real craving for it. triples your bill and you can get sashimi elsewhere. Would order the baked seabass and definitely their salmon nigiri. mmm mm mm", "author": "Vicky T."}

The aptly named Sushi Zone fills it admirably.\n\n\n While one would to best to avoid rolls (maki) and go for the good stuff at high-end sushi restaurants, and avoid nigiri and stick to California rolls and Dynamite rolls and Caterpillar rolls on the low-end, Sushi Zone has a unique niche by specializing in rolls comprised of fresh, less commonplace combos.\n\n\n Papaya unagi. Mackerel and ginger. Mango and striped bass.\n\n\n Traditional? Barely.\n\n\n Delicious, fresh, and prepared by an entertaining middle-aged Japanese man with amusing stories? Most definitely.\n\n\n The downside, of course, is the well-documented wait. It can be eternal. Infernal. Downright perpetual. Another downside is the small size. Not only does it contribute to the wait, but if you happen to be seated near someone with no sense of voice modulation, you may well spend an hour involuntarily listening to someone's boring, insipid stories.\n\n\n But dammit, I love the mango and striped bass.

There are only about 16 seats in this place, so you really just have to get lucky and hope that the group ahead of you got bored and left or got too drunk next door. My wait times have been from 5 mins to near 2 hours and usually it is worth it in the end.\n\nSushi is fresh and the rolls are a unique mix of fresh island mixes like tuna, macadamia nut and mango. Most stuff is pretty damn good here. The baked oyster mixes are amazing. It's always just one man working the sushi bar, one on the baking station and a busy waitress. The wait always leads us to order too much, but that's not really a bad thing. Food wait is awhile after seating, but only because it is a one-man show. If the sushi chef is in a good mood and not overwhelmed he is a very cool guy who will talk your ear off about his favorite bands.

I was told to get there right when they opened or else it would take a while to get seated, so my party enjoyed an early dinner. We enjoyed some big boy Sapporo's after ordering. This ended up being a good move since the food did take quite a while to arrive. This is probably because there is only one (awesome-looking) sushi chef at the whole restaurant. When the food finally arrived, it was well worth the wait. The nigiri is so fresh, it melts in your mouth. We ordered a few rolls with spicy mango, which I had never had in sushi. After traveling in Thailand, I learned never to pass up an opportunity for mango + rice! This strategy proved once again to be the right move. We also had an awesome roll with fried soft-shell crab, which was also bomb. My only gripe with the food was I felt like the rolls fell apart easily when I was using chopsticks, although the multiple sapporos may have contributed to my decreased coordination.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-09", "description": "There are three key aspects which make Sushi Zone a complex, frustrating, intriguing, and incredible spot.\n\n1. The Wait. You will have to wait at least 20 minutes here, unless you arrive at 5pm. Once I arrived at 5:30 and still had to wait. As has already been mentioned, after waiting to be seated, you will also have to wait to be served. I guarantee that you won't be here less than an hour and a half in total, so plan accordingly. I recommend a light salad before coming so that you don't start drinking the chopsticks. Because, ouch.\n\n2. The location. You'd never know this place was here. I like secrets.\n\n3. The sushi. Frickin amazing. The rolls are generous, fresh, and inexpensive-- the best deal in the city, as far as I can tell. They don't skimp on anything, be it flavor, size, accoutrements, or freshness. Everything is exquisitely prepared and delicious. The appetizers are phenomenal, particularly the spicy mussels. I'm not a fan of the macadamia nut or cream cheese weirdo sushi stuff, so I can't really comment on that, but their rainbow roll is probably the best I've ever had. \n\nThey could definitely add more dining seating in the back by the mirrored counter where people tend to sit and wait to be seated at the bar or in booths. And, I agree with another reviewer--was it Toro E.?-- who remarked that it would speed things along to have an apprentice. But if you want fresh, satisfying, unpretentious, and affordable sushi in the Hayes Valley/Market st. area, this is the place to go.

There are a total of three employees (a chef, a waitress and an assistant). You have to be ready to wait for your seat and there's nothing you can do about it. I suggest that you arrive when you're not quite hungry yet. The hunger will be sure to build as you watch others eat.\n\n2) Cash - They don't take credit card, so come prepared. \n\n3) Love of sushi - The space is small and so is their menu selection. They only serve sushi and a small selection of other items (salad, etc.). They DO NOT serve bento boxes or teriyaki so if someone in your party does not appreciate raw fish or the art of sushi, maybe you should dine elsewhere. \n\n4) Comfort in tight spaces - They've maxed out any available space for the dining patrons so while you wait for your table, you may find yourself squished in a corner or standing outside. Again, patience is a virtue. \n\nAlthough the above may deter you from dining here, it shouldn't. All good things are worth waiting for and this is the prime example of why.

Back when the chef/owner had no wait list and played samba all night. But it's way too late. There is more to sushi than the fish, and I've always had a great experience there.\r\n\r\nGet there 15 minutes before they open to get immediate seating. I'll be there a few minutes before you. There are about 16 seats. Each seat only gets about three seatings a night. So if you miss the first wave, expect to wait over an hour for the second or third. If inside, you can order sake while you wait. Outside, grab a cocktail from the spanish restaurant around the corner.\r\n\r\nBe sure to order the two items they serve on mussel shells. It's heaven. The waitress once explained the secret ingredients to me but I forgot them almost immediately. Also, the salmon here is better than other places in SF. The rest of the fish is great.", "author": "Esso E."}

We waited about 2 hours and then spent about 2 hours eating, so you better like the people you're coming with.  Fortunately I liked the company I was with, so I had a great time at Sushi Zone.\n\nWe had a pretty even balance of nigiri and rolls, but I think I was most impressed with the Spicy Mango Salmon roll.  Many of the rolls have mango, and there was even a unagi+papaya roll on the menu.  I would recommend the rolls here, and leave the nigiri to other places that have higher-quality fish that you can really enjoy as nigiri (I've been so spoiled by Kitsho).  Things I hadn't had before: Hawaiian rolls had macadamia nuts on top and sake nigiri had lime on top.\n\nI've uploaded some poor-quality photos of my food.\n\nIt's a tiny establishment, with 2 tables seating 4 each, and about 9 seats at the bar, where you can watch the chef prepare the food.  The price wasn't too bad, I don't remember how much it was a person, but I remembered thinking it was pretty reasonable after 2 carafes of sake plus a ton of sushi.

I love the idea of authentic, but you also have to love innovative.  It was all well made, and tasted very ... clean and crisp. \n\nWhile it's not good for a quick bite, or maybe not for very regular dining, part of me really enjoys the slow way of eating here.  The long wait, of course could go, but the slow way that the sushi chef makes each roll and sends it out one at time makes you really slow down and enjoy it consciously.

The incredible (and yes I mean as in unbelievable) hawaiian sushi is worth waiting for, bring your lover or whoever you really want to pamper, you won't forget it, it will start appearing in your dreams, and of course you'll have to come back. I like the one rolled in macadamia nuts and I have to get multiple mango sea bass because I guess it's now my favorite thing to eat. period. I say it's the dessert, but then i have to start with one too. Addicted! \nI am often by myself and then the wait is relatively short for a seat at the bar! Cheater! Otherwise, come around 5:45 for their 6 pm opening or just be with someone you like so you can hang out while you wait.", "author": "Suzanne J."}

If I was hungry, someone would have gotten hurt.  Luckily the Girl Scouts have been giving me plenty of fat and calories to keep me busy, so I maintained.\nThe sushi was excellent, even if the spicy tuna was a little over mayonnaised for me.  I don't do mayo kids, but I ate the hell out of the spicy tuna, mayo be damned.  It was excellent.  And if there is Sushi Zone food in heaven, it will most surely be the striped bass & mango special they were serving.  I might be okay with never having sex again if I could have more of that special.  Okay, that's a stretch, but HOLY STRIPED BASS it was indescribable.

Hands down the best sushi I've had so far, plus the staff was incredibly friendly, they gave great recommendations and explanations of the menu including what was literally out of the ocean fresh.  \n\nNOTE: this place is tiny, maybe room for like 12 guests at once. Seriously, it's that small.  Plus, there really isn't anything spectacular about the decor, this is just a serious foodie restaurant with mind blowing food.  Check it out, but maybe bring a snack with you to eat before dinner :)\n\nWait in line for the place to open, grab a table or stool, and then patiently wait until the server comes to your table to get your order.  Then, wait for your food.  This is some serious waiting to get dinner.  Guess what? It's worth it.", "author": "S B."}

I went because it is recommended by so many and on the bargain bites list.  So not a bargain!  It is a hole in the wall joint, two tables and sushi bar with seats.  Love hole in the walls but no treasure to repeat here.  It took two plus hours to get seated even though I showed up 15 minutes after opening.  I was determine to sit and try the talk.

No other sushi place even comes close to the beautiful pieces of gastronomic delight that were produced by the chef at the Zone.  Yes, we did wait an hour and a half.  Was it worth it?  Hell yes, it was.  The salmon stuffed mushroom caps and baked mussels alone were worth it.  Add to that the freshest, most buttery pieces of sashimi and rolls so flavorful they practically explode in your mouth.  And to top it all of, it's probably the least expensive sushi place I've been to in the city.  Yes, it's that good.  The only problem is that no other sushi will ever compare, and with that kind of a wait, I definitely won't be frequenting Sushi Zone, so I think I've just set myself up for disappointment.", "author": "Erica G."}

Unlike most Americans, I do not judge a sushi restaurant on their sauces and ridiculously concocted rolls.  We ordered the Nigiri combination plate which contained 12 pieced (6 different types of fish) of fresh quality Nigiri.  We also partook in the spicy scallop roll which tasted like heaven if you like a little kick to your sushi.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-10-15", "description": "Let me put it this way, I've never been to a sushi bar where I've looked longingly at a table as I sat at the bar. \n\nI don't know why all the sushi bars up in the bay area find it to be taboo to talk directly to the chef. All the sushi places in Los Angeles, the entire point of sitting at the bar is ordering directly from the chef. It's like having the honor of sitting at the bar of the fanciest, hippest alcohol bar around, you want to talk to the guy who's preparing your consumables, ask for a tweak here or there, a lil something special perhaps. Somehow this idea did not translate here in the SF Bay and it's driving me nuts!\n\nOkay, so, I ranted for a moment, and it had little to do with Sushi Zone, other than the fact that sushi bar patrons are somehow treated like crap in this city! Well, after a half hour wait, I was feeling blessed by the sushi Gods because I had heard that this place was a monster to actually get seated at. Also, by the looks of it, two tables and eight stools at the bar, it could potentially be forever until sitting down, let alone eating here. \n\nI was so wrong about being blessed. The sushi was wonderful, don't get me wrong. The fish was not really showcased in the rolls, but the Nigiri was fabulous, and the Hawaiian #2 was unique and delicious. Where the Nigiri was concerned, it was some of the freshest, meltiest fish I've ever experienced. \n\nWhere my problem arose was the service. I was sitting at the bar, three feet from the one and only chef in the house, and I could not talk to him, request one thing, smile at him even. On top of this fact, the waitress was trying to be kind and attentive, but was far too overwhelmed. A large party sauntered in just before we did and sat at a table, ordering gargantuan amounts of sushi and appetizers. A couple was then seated just before we got the bar at the second table. As I watched the chef whip up some incredible looking rolls, Sashimi, and Nigiri, I became quite excited for my order to begin heading my way. Half an hour into sitting at the bar, I watched over a dozen rolls leave, placed at each table in large groupings, and then, finally, one roll, out of about six items ordered, was delivered to me. One roll at a time, one couple at the bar at a time, was delivered, as more and more plates filled with delightful sushi left the bar, to end up at the tables. It was as though the chef's patrons at the bar were an afterthought, a hiccup, in his serving the tables. Three hours later, I had finally finished my last bite, the sun far gone from the sky, my day basically blown, and my dreams of Sushi Zone magic shattered.\n\nOh, by the way, CASH ONLY. As a note, there is an ATM just up the street on Market, going toward Castro, for those like myself, who missed the boat on this one.\n\n***Update 10/20/07\nI went back. The service was still kinda slow, but nothing near as bad as it had been that first night. Knocked an hour off of my time spent. I still feel like that \"undeserving\" shunned child in the corner, looking longingly at all the food going out to the loved children, but not quite as much. Also, the food was exceptionally good. So, I've bumped up to four stars, 3.5 overall, but worthy of that solid 4 for the food alone.\n\n***Update 2/4/08\nYeah, so, I come here regularly now. It's just so good, I suck it up. Last night I was blessed by being seated right away, and being served all my food at once at the bar. Also, the Spicy Hamachi roll is one of the most brilliant I've ever had. Cheers! 4.75 stars for the food (I've had one or two pieces of fish I didn't particularly care for, out of dozens, and dozens).", "author": "Shannon F."}

With all due respect, TWO HOURS for the sushi was really not worth it.  The food wasn't \"Mind blowing\".  The staff despite their service limitations due to high traffic is surprisingly good. The prices are great, but the sushi is really average.  From the way everyone talks about it, you'd think you get something sooo good you'd cry after one bite. NOPE.  It tastes good because your starving your ass off for two hours.  Anything tastes good after you sit and watch people eat for that long and while being hungry yourself. NONE of the seating or stools are comfortable. \n Trying this place was important to me because he's one of the very few Japanese Sushi Chefs in San Francisco. As for him, he's very humble, friendly, and accommodating. \nMy wife and I left a really good tip, but really don't plan on coming back there anytime soon.\n 98% of patrons who frequent there seem to be very \"laid back\" rather than the usually obnoxious and excessively disturbing behavior for non-San Franciscans. (*this is very important to me.)\n\n  To me, the fish didn't seem very fresh at all. Most of the Tuna variants were pale in color, but cut very well.  As for the Hawaiian #2 Roll and that Mango deal? Good stuff, but not really impressed. \nThe food is certainly not \"UNRIVALED\".\n*Ino, Redbox, and Kitaro!??!!  C'MON!!!

I am a person who cares mostly about the food, so my reviews reflect this. I will admit you will likely have to wait a while to get a seat at this place (2 hours is not uncommon) and you will probably not get served right after you sit down, which is fine to me, just plan around that, you can always get a drink at one of the local bars while you wait, Pisco is great. So back to the food... the mango seabass baked in a mussel shell is awesome, a must have. The rolls are interesting and very flavourful. The fish is really fresh and its definitely sushi worth appreciating. I think this is one of San Francisco's gems and is a real treat if you are a sushi lover who doesn't mind the wait.

I also like the hawaii roll, toro nigiri, salmon skin roll. \n\nYou never get anything that comes to your table that looks dry and 'dead', cut with a chainsaw, or about to completely fall apart the minute your chopsticks picks it up.

By the time the doors opened at 5:02pm, there were at least 10 people in line eager to get a seat. The restaurant is small and simply, but tastefully, decorated with a background of classic rock playing. I think the sushi chef was singing along to most of the songs. There are two small booths in the window (that can each seat 4) and a sushi counter with 8 or 9 barstools. We were seated at the bar and quickly scanned the specials board and menu. The kitchen is minimal and consists of a small hot plate and toaster oven just to the side of the suhsi counter. There is one man who makes the hot dishes (soup and a couple baked items, etc.), one waitress and one sushi chef.\n\nWe placed our order and were glad to be towards the front of the line-up. Since one sushi chef makes everything, you can't be in a huge rush to get your food. We started with a miso soup, sunomono salad w/ octopus, hot tea and a large unfiltered sake. Slowly our food began to arrive. We started with baked sea bass with mango. It isn't something I would normally be drawn to order, but we overheard a woman outside while we were in line talking about it. The sea bass, mango, butter and some creamy topping are all placed in a large mussel shell and baked in the toaster oven until the top is lightly browned. This dish is amazingly delicious and if i didn't think it would eventually clog my arteries, I would want to eat it everyday. We ordered two rolls; a spicy hamachi roll with avocado, jalapeno and lime, and a soft shelled crab w/ avocado roll (spider roll). I have to say that the spicy hamachi roll may be the best roll I've ever had. The hamachi was left in pretty large chunks lightly covered in a spicy mayo, the jalapeno was flavorful but not too spicy, the avocado fatty and sweet and the lime brightened all of the flavors. We also ordered 2 orders of maguro, 1 hamachi & 1 sake. Everything was superb. The fish was fresh and buttery and the sushi chef cut and prepared everything perfectly. Our meal took and hour and a half and there were a steady stream of people coming in and waiting. I will definitely be back, but do fear the lines a little bit.", "author": "Ariel D."}

My entry - Grandeho Kamyeko. The competiton - Sushi Zone.  After reading the reviews on Yelp as well as citysearch, I was very trepidatious(yes thats a word) that this place would kick Grandehos butt.  We  went here on a monday night, the wait wasnt that bad, and the sushi was terrific.  The one observation that my girlfriend made, that stuck in my head, was that this was sushi with a hawaiin influence...because of their use of mango, papaya, and macadamia nuts in some of the rolls.  I dont know how much truth there is to that, but it was an interesting point. The fish was delicious and fresh, and the wait is well worth it. Does it beat Grandeho?

Everything was so fresh, and masterfully put together. The green tea ice cream was also great. The service is a bit slow - you get your entire order at once, so it takes a while to prepare it all.

So back to the wait, wrote name on board sat & waited approx. 1 hr for our table. Ordered our food immediately. Waited another hour to get our food. Ate our food for about an hour. This whole event at sushi zone took us 3 hours. It was a very long wait, but the food was cheap, good quality, and delicious. I would go back but not on an empty stomach. The place is super small. Occupancy approx. 30. Be prepared for a scorching eye burn from the spice they use. Overall I came here for sushi not much for the atmosphere. I liked it. Nothing I would go goo goo gaga for because I hate waiting for over 1 hour to be seated.", "author": "Mimi S."}

But it's so good, and I feel like it's only right to share it.  Two words...DAMN GOOD!  Yes, there is a wait.  Why?  The place is tiny and there is only one chef.  So you'll have to not only wait for a seat, you have to wait for everyone's order ahead of you.  But as you can see from the loyal fans crowding this place, it's well worth it.  The chef really makes sushi-making an art.  The sushi is fresh, and the service is great.  But if you're impatient...go somewhere else so that I can get my sushi.  The place is open 7 days a week, from 5-10p.  There's usually a line at 4:45, and there's no stopping the crowd until they turn off the lights and brush away the groupies from the sidewalk who are waiting to eat there the next day.", "author": "Mark D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-27", "description": "I like this place overall.  Good portions of good (not great but never fishy) fish and all food is prepared in a tiny little area.  The \"kitchen\" consists of the sushi bar, a sink, a gas burner and a couple of toaster ovens.  I think that's cool.  It's also reasonably priced and they do a pretty good job of \"dressing up\" their average fish selection with creative ingredients.  Some work,  like the salmon nigiri with thinly sliced lime and the baked spicy mussels (from the toaster oven).  Some don't work like unagi and papaya roll-not good.   I do appreciate the effort though.  \n\nI don't like one major thing about this place.  As many have already said, the wait is ridiculous.  It's not even just the wait for a table.  I wouldn't mind so much if I got to eat once I sat down but that has never happened.  You can easily wait 40+ minutes after you sit following the hour or more you already waited for a seat to get ANY of your order.  They don't stagger orders like most sushi places do where they give one group a few things, move on to another ticket and make the rest of the first group's order a little later.  They complete an entire ticket before moving on.  With only one guy behind the bar, if a party of four or more gets their ticket in before yours, prepare to wait A VERY LONG TIME.  Dinner here can easily take 3 hours not including the wait for a seat.  It's kinda like a chicken or the egg situation here.  Either way, it totally sucks.  Come early or late (like 20 mins before close because any later and they won't let you in even if you're on the list before 10). \n\nIf you're looking for good cheap basic unpretentious sushi and have lots of time to kill, Sushi Zone is perfect.  If you're looking for unique top quality fish or you have limited time, Sushi Zone is NOT for you.", "author": "M M."}

After encouraging me to visit Sushi Zone again with gift certificate, I went with a few friends and we still experienced the wait time that many of the other reviewers mentioned, but this time around I actually got to try the sushi.

So excited about sitting at the bar and seeing the amazing looking food being prepared an served.  \n\nWe placed our order at about 9:45 and were ecstatic that we only had to wait a few more minutes to wait intil the deliciousness began.\n\nWe enjoyed our seaweed salad as we counted down the parties ahead of us to be served.  Then we saw out neighbors being served the baked sea bass and mango and we salivated.\n\nOur amazing stuffed mushrooms came out and we were glowing with the great decision that we made to try out this restaurant.  Then at about 10:30pm the sushi chef made the heartbreaking announcement that the rice was undercooked and that he couldn't serve us anything that we ordered but could prepare us sashimi if we wanted.\n\nMy friend is relatively new to sushi and was uncomfortable with the idea of sashimi so we were heartbroken and hungry.\n\nIt was almost 2am her time and all I could do is make her a grilled cheese sandwich when we got home.  \n\nA pitiful end to the night... after 2 hrs of waiting and only a little seaweed salad and 2 stuffed mushrooms.", "author": "Christine L."}

I can't remember what fish it was, but the combination of everything tasted so good, it didn't really matter to me.  We also got the salmon skin roll (always a goodie) and the Hawaiian roll number 2 (mango and tuna with macadamia nuts on top, genius!).  MmmmMmmm.

There are only 2 tables and about 6 bar seats at this whole place. I think it's smaller than my bedroom! They only have room for 1 sushi chef, 1 waitress, and 1 busboy - need I say more.

P and I arrived at 4:50pm (we were the 4th party in line), got seated at the bar at 5pm, and ate by 5:30pm.  Mission accomplished without too long of a wait.\n\n6/28/2007\nYes, you must endure a wait, but for those who endure, they are rewarded.  S, who had introduced me to Sushi Zone years ago, was in town.  She can't get good sushi in DC and was craving it.  She got there around 6:45pm and bet me that we would eat before 9pm.  She was close.  We ate around 8:45pm.\n\nSome tips:\n1. Just because you get seated does not mean you will be eating anytime soon.  So don't curse the hardworking lone waitress who hasn't cleaned up the empty seats yet or stare down people who have finished but are dawdling because IT WON'T MATTER.  The sushi chef prepares the food IN ORDER, so he still has to create the 25+ rolls the 10 people who sat down before you ordered before he gets to you.\n2. Appetizers like salad and the baked mussels or sea bass are prepared by the assistant/dishwasher.  Yes, that sounds weird, but no matter, order some when you are seated so that you do get some food in you before the main course.  And the baked mussels are good!\n3. Have backup plans in case the wait is too long.  No need for fainting spells in the restaurant.\n4. Know that if you arrive around 8pm, chances are you won't get to eat.\n5. Order the spicy hamachi.  You do not know what GOOD is until you have the chef's version of spicy hamachi with hint of jalapeno and lime.", "author": "Pelle Y."}

After gathering a few tips from previous yelp reviews, we set off in search of the hole-in-the-wall, hour-long-wait sushi bar. We arrived around 6:30pm and, after we wrote our name on a little white board, we were told we had around an hour wait. There was a few bar stools for us to wait but they were all occupied so we walked around the area. Sadly, everything closed by 7pm so we were left to wander through laundermats until we thought it would be in our best interest to stay in the restaurant to listen for our name. By 7:40pm, we were seated with our orders placed.\n\nWe chose two appetizers: Baked Mussels and Baked Sea Bass. Both of which were delicious but the winner was the Baked Mussels. The Baked Sea Bass had warmed mangos at the bottom of the mussel shell that it was baked in that didn't rub me in the right way.\n\nFor the meal we decided that the Hawaiian #2 and Mango Hamachi sounded most appealing from yelpers. I don't normally eat raw fish (I know, what am I doing eating sushi) but I decided that I really should eat these rolls that were getting rave reviews. The Hawaiian #2 was VERY good. Like, kind of amazing. I always thought that eating in one bite was just something I did out of convenience, but the way the ingredients worked together and pretty much NEEDED each other in this roll made me appreciate sushi that much more.  The Mango Hamachi was good as well but the Hawaii #2 took the cake for the raw rolls.\nThe we ordered the Rock n' Roll and the Artichoke and Avocado rolls. The Rock n' Roll usually never goes wrong (and it didn't) and it's not raw so naturally, I wanted to order that. It was very good but not really unique to this place. The Artichoke and Avocado was very... different at first. But after 3 pieces of it, it really kind of grew on me. I can't say it was my favorite and that I would order it again, but I did think that it was interesting.\n\nThe waitress and chef were both very curteous and welcoming and we got through the meal without ever getting pressure from them to leave.

So yes, if you get there more than half an hour after they open, you can expect to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, but what do you expect?  They only have two tables and a handful of bar seats.  One server/host works with one sushi chef and one prep cook/dishwasher on busy nights, and they can only handle so much volume.  The upside to keeping such a small restaurant is phenominal quality control.  The sushi here is the best I've had, and I've been whoring myself at sushi joints all over the Bay Area and South Florida for at least six years.  Get anything with mango.  Get anything with macadamia nuts.  Get anything with thinly sliced lime.  Particularly, I recommend the Hawaiians 1&2 and the Spicy Hamachi.  So just remember: get there early.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-03-26", "description": "Well after all the hype on here about how amazing the place is even with the absurd wait I had to try it out for myself.  let me start by saying that thank GOD I didn't even attempt going to this place on a Friday or Saturday night.  Although I can't imagine my experience last night (Sunday) being any WORSE on those days.  After showing up literally at 5:04pm (or 4 minutes after they opened) we were added to the list (2 of us and two parties ahead of us).  We were told by the waitress that the wait would be 45 minutes.  Crazy since we walked in when it opened but not bad enough to walk out.  What made it tolerable was she said we could sit inside and get edamame and drink sake.\n\nThe place is small.  It has two tables (each seats four although most of the night two were occupying them) and about 10 seats at the counter, and thats it. \n\nNow I'm going to speed this up.  First, I was not at all impressed with the \"specials\", or lack thereof.  I consider myself a sushi snob in every sense of the word and I'm sorry but any place that doesn't have fresh toro is not going to score many points with me.  Secondly, the chopstick situation.  They recycle their WOOD chopsticks.  Disgusting.  Now to get right to the point, it took us TWO HOURS to get seated.  Yes, we got there when it opened and had just two people in front of us.  just after 7pm we are seated.  For two hours I stared as the one chef behind the bar worked at a SNAILS pace.  Now I've been to my share of sushi bars and not for a second does snails pace, make me want to jump over the counter and roll some shit up myself, equate to better sushi.  Roger at Zushi Puzzle is all you need to experience to prove that theory wrong.  The bottleneck is probably 20% lack of seating and 80% Chef Snail-san behind the bar.\n\nOnce we sat down we gave our order and the waitress informed us that \"you might want to get some appetizers because its going to be a while\".  THREE HOURS from the time we walked in when it opened, we were finally served out meal at 8:02pm.  UNACCEPTABLE on every level.  At this point after wasting three hours of my life it would take a miracle to make it even remotely worth it.  Guess what?  It wasn't.  The sushi was GREAT.  Very fresh, huge pieces of Nigir.  The rolls were flavorful.  But the rolls were also poorly made with them breaking apart mostly due to the fact the rice was ice cold.\n\nSo long story short, I will never EVER come back here.  NOTHING is worth that wait and for a MUCH better experience I highly recommened going to Zushi Puzzle which has easily 3 times the specials, just as fresh fish, and an experience to remember.\n\nYou guys need to figure out that there is absolutely no reason to run a business that has a three hour turn around time and absolutely NO sense of urgency.  Get a second chef, a bigger place, and bump the cheap prices up slightly to compensate.  It will be well worth your while.\n\nI am still puzzled why so many people would rate this place so highly.  Yes the sushi is good, but the selection leaves much to be desired and the wait makes the whole experience utterly horrible.", "author": "Emm B."}

As for the sushi rolls - we ordered the Hawaiian (raw tuna and mango), rock and roll, spicy tuna and a roll with unagi and papaya.

After putting our name on the list for 2, we waited roughly 50 minutes to sit.  This place does has pretty limited seating and it is a bit warm and stuffy.  We finally sat at the sushi bar on the stools.  We placed our order and received our beverages, soup, and stuffed jalapeno appetizer in 15 minutes.  The Jalapeno appetizer was alright, I was expecting a little punch and you only get two small peppers with a little albacore for $5.50.  Our sushi took another hour and twenty minutes.  The sushi however was quite tasty and the fish was very fresh.  We noticed the sushi chef took a whole half of a hamachi (yellow tail) fish skin on and took time in trimming it making sure all the inedible bits were clear for perfect nigiri presentation.  The Hawaiian Mac Nut #2 roll had a very nice flavor combination.  The spicy hamachi roll was also quite tasty but again, it lacked that spicy punch.  The albacore roll was very good, nice quality fish.  Octopus roll was OK, the flavor and make up was just like the albacore roll so it tasted like the almost the same except with Tako.  The Suzuki (Striped Bass) was delicious!!!  It came with a ponzu dipping sauce.  The overall waiting experience was like a marathon and I am not sure I would do it again.  The overall food experience was very good, the quality of fish and flavor of the sushi made the wait somewhat worth it.  Make sure you get a snack before heading over and have lots of patience.", "author": "Petri Y."}

You put your name on a board, drink about 3 beers since the wait is always about an hour, and then you get to dine.  The fish is always fresh and some of the dishes are quite creative.  The atmosphere is more of a low key sushi joint, and I think that they like it that way.  Its not meant to be one of those trendy sushi bars with \"great house music,\" and its definitely worth checking out a few times if you're a serious sushi fan.", "author": "Marc G."}

I was so pissed off that I had to wait so long on an empty stomach that I turned into a total bitch disregarding the company and just wanting to leave. But I could not leave. This guy that brought me there has some serious guns in his closet, and despite my misery I was afraid to leave in fear of being shot. So I thought to myself, just wait it out- it can't be that bad. But it was. After sitting down, it took another hour and a half for the Mexican sushi chef to make those shitty rolls. I desperately kept looking at the clock and it was like watching paint dry. Right next to us there was a couple vigorously making out and then I realized why this place has 4 stars. When you come here, the wait is so dam long that you go to the bar across the street and you get fucked up. By the time you are ready to eat, anything tastes good. Fuck you Sushi Zone; you have no respect for my time. I would rather be eating pigs balls than waiting that long.", "author": "Marta A."}

However, if you are like me & my boyfriend, who I was DYING to take him to Sushi Zone for Hawaii Rolls #1 & 2, we decided to get there early, around 6pm, thinking no one would be eating that early.  Well, we just missed the table cut-off (the people right ahead of us sat down immediately) - and you know how that happens, when a place with very little seating, gets everyone seated right before you get in line....well, let's just say, we didn't sit down until 8pm.  We saw couples come and go, writing their names on the dry erase board and leaving for hours - \"but we got here at 6! there's no way it will take more than 45 minutes...right?\"  In any case, we waited the full two hours, sat down, and had a lovely meal (even though we had to sit at the two corner bar stools by the door (which can be really uncomfortable because the stools have no backs, and it can be freezing when people stand in the doorway).  But, the sushi is that good that I would do it again...once my memories of the REST of the experience fade a little, or I somehow end up with a lot of extra time on my hands.", "author": "Leigh c."}

Sachio is still the best in my opinion.  i think the appeal of sushi zone is in its personality (small cozy neighborhood alleyway), exclusivity (the place is SO small that when u DO get a seat, u feel like you EARNED it, and it makes everything THAT much better), quality, and price.  we had four people with beer for under $100 with tip.", "author": "Curtis Y."}
