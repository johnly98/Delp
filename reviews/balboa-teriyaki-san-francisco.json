We went at around 3PM so there was no one there. And since it was empty, we were seated right away. The server was attentive and all the food came out within about 15 minutes. It's a decent sized restaurant (about 8-9ish tables and seats  an average of 4 people per table). And although it was a random time, more people started coming in to eat at around 3:30PM.\n\nWe ordered the gyoza ($6.50), croquette ($5.95), the Scallop Delight Roll ($14.95), and the Bobby's Roll ($13.95). The gyoza was deep fried. I usually don't like deep fried gyoza but this was actually pretty good. It wasn't too oily and the meat and vegetables inside were delicious. Next, the croquette was AMAZING. They don't make it there but it was DELICIOUS. The potato mix inside was a combination of potato and a little bit of carrot; and it was perfectly fried. \n\nNow for the rolls...the Scallop Delight Roll was really good. It wasn't heavy at all which made it even better. It had shrimp tempura, cucumber and avocado inside and was topped with spicy scallop and tobiko. And the Bobby's Roll had avocado, cucumber, and minced tuna, and topped with salmon, spicy mayo, and tobiko. This was also a really light roll. \n\nThis meal was the perfect amount for 2 people to share. To top it off, rather than getting candy with the check, they gave Yakult! I was so surprised they were giving these out for free. It was the perfect top off to our meal. Overall, I would definitely return and recommend this spot!", "author": "Victoria H."}

After about 15min, we finally got water and put in our order for the Katsu Don, Beach Roll, 8pc Nigiri, and a Small Hot Sake. The Katsu Don came out within 5 min but we had to ask several times for the other items. After the second time of asking, they finally gave us the Sake. The Beach Roll came out 20 min after we ordered, and the Nigiri took 30 min to come out. I'm incredulous over the fact NIGIRI from the standard selection took 30 min to come out.\n\nQuality of food is mediocre at best. The miso soup given was grainy at best. For the Katsu Don, it's large at least so at least you get a lot for the cost but the slowness of the service made me lose my appetite. The Beach Roll was essentially a California Roll with shrimp, mayo, and eel sauce on top. The Nigiri was fine, but again, Nigiri should not take 30 min to be served.", "author": "Eumin L."}

I went with my gut (after looking through the menu) and decided to ignore the star rating on this one because I know that our usual place (which I love) also doesn't do well by yelp standards.\nI am so glad that we decided to give this place a try. The food was great and the service was excellent. We even got a complimentary appetizer roll. We had the dynamite roll (only two bites left in the picture), lion king roll (not pictured because we devoured it so fast), the Las Vegas roll, and the bay bridge roll. We also ordered the tempura ice cream for dessert.\n\nOur least favorite things were the Las Vegas roll (a little too cream cheesy) and the tempura ice cream ( just not as good as Mexican fried ice cream IMO), but we still finished everything set before us. \nFor a group of three, 4 rolls plus a dessert was perfect portioning. \nIt was easy to find parking and it was an overall cozy little spot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-10-16", "description": "Although I don't generally spend a lot of time in this part of the Richmond, I used to be kind of curious about Balboa Teriyaki.  A few friends who grew up nearby and came here as kids would speak rather fondly about them, but I never knew if it was because the food was actually good or just nostalgia.  Now, after having tried them, I can only assume it was due to the latter because, otherwise, I might have to start questioning their taste in Japanese food!\n\nWhile my first trip here was more than enough for me to evaluate Balboa Teriyaki, the (anal) Yelper in me felt compelled to give them another shot.  Not so much in the spirit of being thorough, but because my friend made the unfortunate point that I didn't actually try their namesake teriyaki dishes.  Ugh.  Fortunately though, I didn't have to worry about repeating everything all over again, as the menu is decently varied, albeit with standard offerings (small plates, sushi, sashimi, bento boxes, udon, etc.).\n\n**I heard that the prices may have changed, so these may not be accurate anymore.\n\n-- HAMACHI NIGIRI...$5.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=58QJUpWbZpjqT55-BXIf-g)\nPossibly the best thing I had, which might not be saying much.  While it was a sizable piece, the cut of the fish was a bit awkward (there was a big tendon down the middle) and it had a small dollop of minced ginger, which I'd never seen before.  Still, it tasted fine and was decently fresh, so I can't complain too much.\n\n-- GIRL BOY ROLL - Shrimp Tempura, Cream Cheese, and Avocado topped with Tuna, Salmon, Eel Sauce, and Tobiko...$13.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=_O5ERmHKqzpBQIii4xceSw)\nEven though all of the components naturally complemented each other, this didn't really stand out.  The salmon wasn't too shabby, and the avocados were ripe, but the tuna didn't do much for me (almost tasteless).  As for the tempura, I didn't care for the texture of the batter (kind of mealy), though it tasted okay.\n\n-- POKE SALAD - Assorted Sashimi, Daikon, Seaweed Salad, Spring Mix, Kaiware, Cucumber, and Tobiko topped with Special and Spicy Sauces....$13.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=99ju2z61n4r1UEZLP023VA)\nThe order was a lot larger than I had expected, but nothing special otherwise.  Although they were fairly generous with the portion, the fish didn't seem especially fresh (they definitely weren't prime cuts).  Then again, the sauce might've had something to do with it, as it was pretty sharp/acidic.\n\n-- DINNER BENTO BOX - Chicken Teriyaki, Chicken Katsu, and Gyoza...$16.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=KIt3bDAsjtONbAPvFGQjFQ)\nTo be honest, the chicken teriyaki was easily the worst thing I had.  It didn't have much of a char, it tasted like it might've been previously frozen, and it was sprinkled with seaweed (??).  The katsu was slightly better, if only because #fried, but the breading was paper thin.  As for the gyoza, they weren't awful, but they weren't exactly special either (ditto for the salad and miso soup).\n\n-- ORANGE DRAGON ROLL - Shrimp Tempura and Cucumber topped with Salmon, Spicy Mayo, Unagi Sauce, and Tobiko...$12.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=dMLjN6hACaEV66Pqz_lHqw)\nIt wasn't part of the plan to get a roll so similar to the Girl Boy one, but it felt like a relatively safe choice.  Though the salmon wasn't bad, nothing else was that great.  Sadly, we ran into the same problems with the shrimp tempura (though it was tastier this time).  Plus, it had carrots in it, which was kind of odd.\n\nAlso, I can't say I was a big fan of their sushi rice in either the nigiri or the rolls.  Both times, it was almost flavorless and had a gummy sort of consistency.  That said, despite the disappointing food, neither meal was a complete failure.  Service was consistently friendly and they gave a free appetizer with each meal - a fried ball of salmon (I think...) and a grilled shrimp skewer (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/balboa-teriyaki-san-francisco?select=OFvh4QaVeAM0O3CwMseweQ).\n\nAll in all, despite the service and the free food, neither was enough for me to give anything more than two stars.  Maybe if I had some old memories to go with them, but alas...I don't.  Sorry.", "author": "Mike L."}

Happens all the time. But when the beanto boxes came, not only were they overpriced, the portion was less! Meat is cut thinner than compared to any Japanese restaurants I've been to. Fish was half the size of what any other Japanese restaurants I've been to. Don't get me stared in the Sashimi. Take a look at the pictures I've uploaded. That bento box had so little amount of food on it that it felt like we were eating someone's half eaten bento box. Originally, I kept that overpriced and skimmed portion to myself. But once we left, that was the consensus. Everyone thought the restaurant was overpriced and the amount of food they give you was way too little. Restaurant over pricing and cutting corners. \n\nI would have given this a 2 star, however, the food tasted good and the customer service was okay. That night we went there to eat, the bathroom was out of order. Anytime any customer needed to goto the restroom, the waiter would give them a flashlight. Seriously, how does one wipe while holding a flashlight. Or do anything in the bathroom with a small plastic blue battery powered flashlight. \n\nIf you want Japanese, goto another restaurant, if your lazy to travel, you can get here and NOT get what you paid for.", "author": "Jack L."}

One particular reason is that you can easily find restaurants to walk into on a Friday or Saturday night and instantly get seated.  Balboa Teriyaki is one of them.  A trip out to the end of Balboa can be a sweet date excursion.  The fog, the Balboa Theater, plenty of cafes and restaurants, off the beaten path and quiet.  \n\nBut if you are in the mood for sushi out there, might as well head to Yu Zen further down the street.  Balboa Teriyaki was alright but nothing special.  The best part of the dining experience was how quiet it was inside, and that the 2 of us got a big booth like table instead of being squeezed into the sushi bar practically on top of someone else.  \n\n Sashimi Salad was ok.

Even the head of the shrimp was edible. \nBalboa fish ball - also on the house and was yummy\nWe even got soybeans on the house and they are not only good to eat but fun to play with trying to get them out of the pod.. fly little bean fly !! \nThe meals came with Miso soup which was good. \n\nIt was pricey (60.00) but when you're hungry and order a lot thats what happens. But I left quite full and couldnt order the desert. \n\nI know my review differs than a few but you know what - go to this, try it out and see how you feel.

The owners/management has changed over a couple times, but the present management is still doing a swell job. They do have really awesome rolls and a huge variety of em. I like that their sushi menu is like a picture book since I definitely like to see what I'm going to order. The sushi is good for being right up the street, but I wouldn't say it's the most authentic sushi/sashimi experience... if that's what you're looking for. The prices are average normal for gigantic sushi rolls like at other sushi spots ($11ish-$15ish). I like ALL of the rolls I've tried! 49ers, Dragon, and the baked scallop one especially.\n\nBeef teriyaki is pretty good as well. Sukiyaki is too sweet for me.. I know, I know it's supposed to be a little sweet, but I guess I compare it to the homemade sukiyaki my Japanese grandmama makes. Most everything I've tried is pretty good, but my favorite things on the menu are the Sashimi and the Poke salads! The spicy sauce is soooo delicious with the fish and the mixed greens. I just wish they were bigger. The place is small and the service is ok when they aren't super busy, which they can get sometimes. Not ideal for big groups unless you call ahead to see if the tables are open.

I ordered 3 special rolls.  The Lambada, Playboy, and Lion.  I give the Lambada a 100 stars.  I loved it.  The Playboy was just as good, but the Lion was okay; typical but a little bit on the sweeter end.  The waitress was really nice and funny.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-04-25", "description": "This little sushi place out on Balboa is right next to Americana, a diner my friends and I tend to frequent when we're feeling cheap pho. I'm sure we made jokes about eating here numerous times ... until the other day, when we finally decided to stop by on a whim.\n\nBT's main focus seems to be on sushi rolls based on the colorful picture menus taped to the front window, though the slightly more intensive menu you get inside reveals they also have (marginally more expensive) dinner items like donburi, bento boxes, and such. The pictures certainly look good, and as most of us (a group of six) were in the mood for sushi we wound up ordering based on how good the rolls looked.\n\nEven though it was a Friday night around eight o'clock, the place wasn't too crowded. My friends - for some awful reason - opted to crowd into a small booth despite there being able table space for large groups like ours. Despite there not being many other customers though the service seemed a bit slow - slow to take our order, slow to provide ordered appetizers, and slow to bring our food. All in all we were actually at dinner for a good 3 hours or so, and it's NOT because we're slow eaters.\n\nAt the same time, the staff were nice enough to provide us with some freebies while apologizing for the wait. We got a round of edamame, a few cans of Coke and Sprite, and later some green tea ice cream free of charge. A nice gesture for sure.\n\nThe food itself was actually pretty good. Though I've had fresher sushi at other locations it was at a slightly higher cost, not that BT is particularly cheap or anything. The sashimi was tender and flavorful, the baked objects were cooked just right, and altogether the presentation was appealing, if lacking that bit of extra effort that some smaller sushi places excel at. Altogether a satisfying meal.\n\nTo me, Balboa Teriyaki is a lot like its neighbor Americana - it's the kind of place I wouldn't mind going every now and then, but you have to be in the mood to go, especially considering its location all the way out on Balboa (ignore that comment if you live in the neighborhood). If you're looking for a fancy, upscale sushi bar for a date or to impress friends, you might want to look elsewhere, but for casual dining it's a great little spot.", "author": "Will C."}

Don't go if you're extremely hungry because you're better off just starving to death. We only came because Miki down the street was too busy and the other place was close for the holidays. \n\nFirst off, we were seated and were sitting without service or even water for about 20 minutes. Then when confronted about us waiting and us being ready for so long, she simply said the kitchen was too busy and couldn't even come over to take our orders. Then when the food finally came, it wasn't even worth the wait. \n\nI'm giving it one star only because they made up by giving us a complimentary appetizer that tasted freshly fried. Other than that the chicken katsu we received was definitely fried from frozen and was not good. The two using we got had bitter zucchini, meaning that it had gone bad. The chicken in the udon was a weird from the freezer texture. Another dish we got was the unagi donburi and it was completely drenched in sauce. It was so hard to eat because the sauce was too strong. It made me feel like it was sauce with a little rice. Just horrible. \n\nAnd it's not worth the money.

Great service (5 stars). Most of the times, they give you in the house appetizers. I come here, when I am in the neighborhood and want a place to go that I will know that I will have great service and also craving sushi.\nI really want to give them a 4 stars, but just can't. Despite their service, it is still a bit pricey for a neighborhood sushi restaurant and their food IS tasty but not the best that I have had.\n\nAs an aside (if not in the mood of raw fish), last time I came here, we ordered the bento box with the fish option (forgot the name of the fish).

In terms of my part of the Outer Richmond, I'd say it's actually better than some of the other sushi offerings. Portions are good size, and the price isn't awful. And - as anyone who has read my reviews knows I will eventually mention - the girls that work there are awfully damn cute! \n\nThat being said - this place really isn't much more than average. As other Yelpers have mentioned, they do tend to overdo any of the sauces - especially the cream ones. I personally feel this doesn't do justice to the fish. \n\nI just went this past Sunday (3/22) and the fish seemed to be fresher and better than it usually is. I have a bit higher standard when it comes to fresh fish, so my last excursion here wasn't the best - but I gave it another shot, and this past time around was a lot better - but still fell short of the mark. \n\nThe waitress we had DID give us a few \"on the house\" items, which was super cool, but didn't manage to really make the experience that much better. \n\nif you just want some quick sushi and don't want to mess with all the fuss, this is a good spot - but if you want an honest to goodness sushi experience - go to one of the umpteen million other better sushi joints all over town. This spot is more a \"I'm feeling super lazy and not wanting to leave the neighborhood\" kinda spot.", "author": "Marco M."}

I am going to update the stars though, from 2 to 3.5 (not enough to make the graphic say 4).\n\nNow that the waitress recognizes us, we get really great service.  We go at off times, know the menu a bit better, and we just roll with it.  I even like when we wait a bit because the atmosphere is really relaxing.  \n\nI now always start by asking for sake and gyoza, right off the bat.  We then order a dinner bento box, an extra rice and miso, and two rolls.  That feeds both of us and we're stuffed and satisfied!  And, though the place is relatively inexpensive already, this makes for a really cheap dinner out.  One nice touch:  The bento box comes with a salad (he eats that) and the waitress brings me a little cucumber \"salad.\"  It's sweet.\n\nFavs on the menu:\nGyoza (meat)\nSpider Roll \nTempura!\nTonkatsu\n\nMy apologies for the run-on review.  This is a good place.  Take your time, be patient, and be willing to give it a few chances to see it's true value.  As a side note, I need to learn the waitress' name--I feel bad!\n\n-------------------------------\n\nPeople seem to have a love/hate relationship with this place.  Let me tell you, I'm on the \"hate\" end.  Honestly, I only intended to give this place one star but I'm winding up with two.  Here's my story:\n\nWe walk in there at 6:45 tonight (Friday).  Yes, it's a Friday night.  People go out, waits are long, etc.  But we walk on over there and there's even a table empty.  Cool.  Kind of a small place (about 12 tables?) and I figure we're ok.\n\nWe proceed to be ignored for about 10 minutes.  I finally asked for a menu (first mistake--I should have walked out).  She takes the order a few moments later.  Beer, sake, water, edamame, a few rolls, and a tempura dinner for him.  15 minutes later, beer and sake arrive with edamame.\n\nHe eventually gets a salad, a bit later some miso, I finally get a glass of water.  We hear a family nearby complaining that they've waited a good long time.  One waitress is slowly getting to people and there is no one else to be seen.  That is, except for the lady at the register taking phone orders and serving unseen people diligently.  Meanwhile, a room full of hungry, paying faces in front of her are growing mighty impatient.  \n\nThere's a couple that has been there much longer than we have that have even ceased talking to each other, they've been there so long.  She takes out her cell phone and starts playing a game (with the sound ON?!  How rude!!!).  But I understand her pain.\n\nAt 7:55, I glance at my own cell phone and the food is still nowhere to be seen.  Probably ten minutes later, some tempura arrives.  Followed semi-shortly by the rolls.  She forgot a bowl of rice (which never arrived in the end).  That couple with the cell phone girl?  They still hadn't been served.  My boy said we should ask about that rice.  I told him just to finish his meal because I just wanted the heck out of there!\n\nYou know, I hate to admit that the food was OK.  You know, it wasn't great, nothing special, but good.  And it's close and fairly cheap.  Common rolls range from $2.50 to $5.  Specialty around $8.  Entrees start at about $9.  Really, it can be a good deal.\n\nI was not ok with waiting well over an hour for food.  Seriously, it wasn't that busy.  Get help if you need it people!  Customers are not going to put up with this!\n\nZero stars for service.  It was just terrible.  Very clean place though.  Booths are very private and you can relax there.  Food, decent.  Prices, great.  I give two stars because they might be decent for takeout.  It kind of goes against my morals to patronize a business who has such poor service.  But, like I said, they're two blocks away and cheap.  I might go for takeout.\n\nAll I can say for tonight is that they better be glad I had some sake to calm me down.  It could have gotten ugly.\n\nUPDATE:  12/23/07\nLast Friday, we went again.  Needed something cheap that we could walk to.  It was a very quiet night there, we were one of 3 tables.\n\nAgain, food was good.  The waitress is just pretty clueless.  We were halfway through our meal when we asked her where our two orders of miso were.  \n\nWaitress: \"You ordered them.\"\nUs:  \"Yes, may we have them?\"\nWaitress:  \"You ordered them.\"\nUs:  \"Yes, we know.  Will you bring them?\"\nWaitress:  \"Oh, you mean I didn't bring them?\"\nUs:  \"No, you didn't bring them.  May we have our miso?\"\n\nI really shouldn't go back.  I probably will.  groan", "author": "Melissa Q."}

What I wasn't prepared for was that the servers would ignore us and wait on two other parties that were seated well after we were. I tried to be patient, especially since I used to wait tables, but this was just rude. We didn't even get tea and meanwhile, they're bringing soup and taking orders from the other tables.

Like other posters have said, this place does take a while to get the food to you so do not come here and sit down if you have somewhere to be in 30 minutes.  \n\nI usually try to only go during the lunch time since there is less of a wait and generally less people.  Lunch bentos run about $6-$8 depending on the meat.  They come with miso soup, rice, salad, and california rolls.

Other than those small things to point out, I still go back!!!  \n\nSince this place is small, it is a great place for small groups up to 5-6 people, but once you exceed that, you might have to wait until small tables open up to accomadate a larger party.", "author": "judy l."}

We had a few questions about some of the ingredients/names and she happily answered.  We got edamame (always yum), seaweed salad (good), ahi sashimi and sukiyaki (good), chicken teriyaki (satiated the craving), spicy tuna rolls (yummmm, and with just the right amount of spice), a 49er's roll (I didn't try it, but it got good reviews from my compadres. The menu said it came with avocado slices on top but it was served with lemon slices), and philly rolls (best I've ever had).  For all that food, plus tea and salads and miso, our bill was $50.  Not at all bad for the quantity and quality.\n\nAlso note, by the time we were leaving, the place was packed!

Bar none, this had to be one of the WORST things I've ever seen served in a restaurant.  I don't even think it was 100% chicken.  It looked and tasted like one of those frozen \"chicken\" products made from all kinds of junk that you might find in the corner of Walmart.  The gross texture was not helped by the fact that it did not seemed grilled, but microwave thawed first and then put on a grill just to give it some grill marks.  My friend and I could only stare at it open mouthed in amazement.  Neither of us had ever tasted anything so wierd and gross at a restaurant.  I don't care if their sushi is nice, there is NO EXCUSE for putting this kind of crap on the menu.  If you don't have the capability to put out an item at even the minimum quality, then just DON'T SERVE IT, regardless of restaurant name. The most positive thing I can say about the teriyaki is that it was probably not a health hazard.\n\nI'm taking away 2 stars from my original review because the whole thing was just unbelievable.

Back in the days when I was a sophomore (7 years ago?) in highschool at Washington (about 5 blocks away), this was one of the only places I ate at during lunch.  \n\nThese days I got here for their awesome teriyaki (chicken or beef, both are great)which is priced just right and tastes even better.  Their tekka maki (tuna roll) is quite good as well and has changed little since my highschool years.  Stay away from their sashimi however, a few times I got a frozen solid slab of fish.  Their california roll (yes, I know it's basic) made with real crab meat (by request) is quite good actually, so I normally order that along with my tekka.\n\nOverall good food at cheap prices ($25 for two, what a deal!).", "author": "Serge S."}

The food is ok, not great or awful, but you can get better elsewhere if you're willing to drive there.  Just  ate here again a couple of months ago and had some grilled salmon which was fine.  Service is also ok, but they only have one server and you'll have to make an effort to get his  attention (it's always been a guy when I've been there) especially if they are busy.  They don't have enough room for a sushi bar and I've never had sushi here, because if I can't see it, I won't eat it.  However, they do serve some unusual Japanese dishes that are posted on signs on the walls and I've tried some in the past and it must of been ok because I don't recall it being bad but I also can't remember what I had, so it wasn't all that memorable.  I do recall however that some of the entree dishes seemed quite pricey.

While we were learning it, my Japanese teacher told us that in restaurants (or in any form of retail)  the service treats you like gods (kami, in Japanese hehe). I felt that the customer service was exactly how my teacher described it. Our server was very polite, checked in with us, and even offered us things on the house (which I'll explain later!!) plus more. To those who had an issue with their customer service, I say give them another chance. Who knows, maybe they fired the person who served you guys? \nAnyways, I went here with my boyfriend and two of my roommates to celebrate the end of a very dramatic house issue that won't be described in this review. We wanted sushi and something close by, and I didn't really like the sushi place across the street from this restaurant so I told them that place was out of the question. So, we went here! I was kind of afraid that Balboa Teriyaki wasn't going to be good because the place was empty, but in the end I was so glad I stayed! \nWe were sat down immediately (the place was empty, why wouldn't we be??) and given really pretty menus. Off the top of my head we all ordered: 1 Kirin Ichiban, 1 Sapporo beer, Veggi Tempura, Cherry blossom roll, and three other rolls I can't remember...! Mine came last, which made me kind of sad, but it was still very good (mine was the Cherry Blossom Roll). The food was soooo good, and not uber expensive. Great for a group of in-college/fresh out of college kids who just wanna have a good time! \nAnd a good time we had, we enjoyed the music, kind of embarrassed a couple at the other table (though the guy said something really embarrassing anyways and we just kinda made him realize that.) and definitely the free food the server was throwing our way. One of my roommates is vegan, so she had to ask for very specific things. Our waiter was VERY helpful, she went back and forth to the kitchen to ask if they had any vegan friendly ingredients for her Tempura, and she ever offered us Edamame on the house. At the end of our dinner she even gave us green tea ice cream on the house! This was SO unnecessary, it wasn't like we were unsatisfied with our food or anything and she still gave us ice cream.

I have had great rolls and mediocre rolls when I have been here. I have had hurriedly prepared food when I have come in after 9:30PM and I have had awesomely prepared food when I have come in during usual business hours. This is entirely understandable because when you are a half-hour away from closing, the last thing you want to do is work. That's life.\nI love the Sabayaki here. It is delicious. Much better than the Sabayaki I had at Kitaro. Not that Kitaro is the end all and be all of Japanese in the city, but there you go. The portions are very big. The tempura is well done and I love that they have Agedashi Tofu on the menu. Their rolls are good and I love the dinner bento specials. They have so many great combos and choices that is hard to pick what to have. I love their little cucumber salads dressed with rice vinegar and sesame seeds!\nThe wait staff has always been friendly and attentive. Again, if you go in right before closing, I am sure it is a different experience. Also, the food comes in a timely manner. I am not sure how fast people want their food prepared, but it takes time to cook and I would rather have food that is cooked well than have it rushed to my table.\nSo, yes. This is a good place to go before or after a movie at the Balboa Theatre and while the food is not amazing, it is definitely delicious and satisfying. It's become a regular habit for me and my partner because the food is good, prices reasonable and they have some nice booths.", "author": "Desiree V."}

But the tempura is nice, the tea, soup and salad tasty. The sushi does the job. You'll never write home about anything you eat here, but it's intimate and pleasant. I like the price and I like the proxmity to the Balboa Theater. So, yeah, it'll totally do.", "author": "Martha S."}

Bento box and sapporro beer.  Rock on.  I do want to say.  Easily the cleanest toliet I have ever gone too.  And I noticed 100% on their health inspection.  Nice one guys.  I do want to add that I spend alot of time in restaurants and cafes.  An incredible amount.", "author": "Nick T."}

The $8.50 box lunch was a screaming deal and amazing, and even more amazing was the fact that my cheapskate dad found a place that was good and cheap.  The service was incredible.  We had our box, soup, complimentary prawns and edamame within ten minutes of arriving.  The tempura was something I now crave.  My son and family went with me next time and the service was even better, if that's possible.  My husband went with me a few days after that and even though it was after 3:30 pm they allowed us to pay at lunch prices, and again, it was an amazing lunch.  I just went there again today with my sister and a bunch of family.  We got complimentary prawns, edamame, green tea ice cream, and they didn't mind all our loud laughing.  I love this place.  I can't speak highly enough.  Everything's awesome, especially the tempura and sashimi.", "author": "Jill B."}

It's always been good sushi (had terriyaki once too) and nice service.  I will say I wish they cut the sushi pieces smaller.  Both times we come in kinda late at night, between 9-10p and had no problems.  We like it a lot and will be back many times I'm sure.", "author": "Shauna C."}

I miss the waitress that went to work somewhere else though. She was a real pro. That being said, the service is good and the food tasty, albeit standard fare. The fish is too cold though. I usually have to take it off the top and soak it in the shoyu to warm it up. The hamachi is nice and fatty. Saba is standard (I tend to judge by the saba)  prices are very reasonable. It is dependable", "author": "tregar o."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-07-19", "description": "My husband and I used to go there at least once a week years ago.  But when our favorite waitress quit, the menu bulked up with sushi selections, things just went downhill.  I decided to give it another chance while in the neighborhood, after 4 years.  Things did not improve.  I got a teriyaki lunch combination.  The soup and tempura were good.  But my chicken looked like it was re-heated from the night before.  Tasteless.  Skimpy teriyaki sauce.  Just like previous review, I, too, loved their thick teriyaki sauce.  I really don't know what happened...the cook looks like the same person from before so I am surprised there has been a change in food quality.  Maybe dinners are better...", "author": "G. W."}

I'm glad to have found a nice Japanese place in my neighborhood. I am not an expert on Japanese cuisine, but everything tasted very good.  It was not crowded, but there was a decent number of people there eating and the place had a good atmosphere - not fancy, but not \"fast foody\". The interior is well done in a Japanese style and is peacful and pleasant. For around $12 I had the dinner bento box, which offered a good variety from the menu and was enough that I took some home for lunch the next day. They offered salad, miso soup and rice with it, and the bento box consists of tempura, edamame pods, and your choice of 2 or 3 other items. I am not a big fan of tempura, but this was well done by my standards. And I *am* a fan of sushi, so I'll have to go back and try their offerings. Plus, living out here in the fog bank, I often get cravings for huge steaming hot bowls of udon, so this place will probably be my go-to.", "author": "Caitlin H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-23", "description": "Went for lunch the other day and was quite impressed by the service and the free stuff they gave us. We ordered bento boxes which were quite reasonable and pretty good. The tempura was great, the beef teriyaki was better than the chicken teriyaki, but both were good. They give you edamame to begin with. Then we got complimentary deep fried shrimp on skewers. These were the kind with shell and head, but you can eat everything since it's deep fried. It was very good. Next came our bento boxes where the portions are pretty generous for a lunch special. They then brought out a full order of spicy tuna rolls. Again, we didn't order these, but they said they were on-the-house. Once we finished, they brought out green tea ice cream. We were stuffed. The service was great. They always came around to fill-up our tea cups on a regular basis. They even asked if i wanted more miso soup. Their service really raised my expectations, and anything less will be a disappointment now. We will definitely be back to try dinner, and see if they can match the great lunch experience we had.", "author": "David Y."}
