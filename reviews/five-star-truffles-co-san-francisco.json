No particular reason. I just think people like us get used to their routines, which is my roundabout way of saying we had no idea this shop existed until we saw the sandwich board that announced free truffles inside (photo: http://bit.ly/2kBntdo). Now why would we pass up an opportunity like that? I wanted a little caffeine after dinner, so the idea of buying a $2.25 cup of coffee seemed reasonable to me for a mouthful of sweetness (photo: http://bit.ly/2kBvrD4).\n\nNow choosing which truffle turned into quite a challenge as the display case was full of all sorts of variety from peanut butter to cinnamon dark chocolate to rum coco to even vegan truffles (photo: http://bit.ly/2laYj2p). I settled on the hazelnut once which was covered in them in pulverized form (photo: http://bit.ly/2jQlahQ). Oh yes, that was certainly a pop of goodness well worth the mediocre, overheated cup of coffee I bought. Should I come back for the $33 40-piece gift box or the $45 60-piece gift box? Such decisions should be made when I'm standing on a weight scale, so I remember how ridiculous that question is.\n\nTRUFFLE - 4 stars...lovely mouthful there though the coffee needs to be thrown out\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...just a little shop, nothing more\nSERVICE - 3 stars...oh so quiet\nTOTAL - 4 stars...another one won't kill me, right?", "author": "Ed U."}

I don't have a dog in the fight, just trying to find good truffles in San Francisco.\n\nApparently the chef here is an alum of XOX. We tried XOX, loved it, but Castro is closer to us, so decided to try them. Hard to believe he's an alum because:\n\na) the truffles at Five Star are *significantly* sweeter (I actually couldn't finish the hazelnut)\nb) not nearly as smooth\nc) no complexity to the ganache\n\nPerhaps more suited for an American palate, XOX is truly French.\n\nSo when there is someone else who does the same thing, but better, I'd say thanks but no thanks.\n\nXOX is in North Beach. I am yet to find any other good ones in the city. I tried the bon bons at Jade and Christopher Elbo. Jade doesn't know chocolate at all, plus shells are way too thick.

They're each very tiny, like the size of a little fresh mozzarella ball, and most are dusted with cocoa powder. Their small size has let me blaze a trail through more truffle varieties than I ever could with regular-sized chocolates at other specialty sweet shops. \n\nHelpful tip: their receipt reads \"Start Truffles,\" so if you try to find the place again via their name, like I did, you will be woefully disappointed!

Far from overpowering, these are delicately balanced morsels of pure delight, the kind you can enjoy on a daily basis. I highly recommend stopping in, picking up a box (just $7.50 for 20), popping a few in your mouth and passing the rest out to random strangers you meet. Truffles earn double karma points! Triple, for supporting a small business run with love, humility and infectious enthusiasm.\n\nUpdate April/07: To those who would criticize the founder for stealing the recipes from XOX Truffles, where he worked for many years... It certainly casts a shadow over the business. However, I ask you to consider two mitigating factors. One, the recipe for a raspberry truffle is not exactly a trade secret. \"Theft\" is a bit of a strong word to use when it comes to truffle recipes. \n\nTwo, I will say something but first I must qualify it by noting I know nothing about the internal operations of XOX Truffles or Five Star for that matter. But generally, in my view, the food service industry in SF exploits immigrant labor. It's built on it. It's its backbone. So many kitchens in the city are powered by immigrant laborers who work their asses off but are powerless to negotiate anything more than a pitiful wage. And for those of you who would preach the magic of the market, it's a *political* disempowerment, stemming from plenty of non-market forces that keep them in an exploited state. Something to think about before anyone gets all high-horsed about the kitchen slaves running off and stealing massa's recipes.

Much better in round truffle form, washed down with a cup of their yummy, not-too-strong coffee.\n\nI can't bear to deduct since they are everywhere, but I have a hovering half-star deduction for the cloud of fruit flies that always seems to want a piece of my chocolate when I'm leaving.

I want a place like this to lure me through the door, tempting me with seductive decor and glamourous wrapping so that I *need* to buy the goods just because they look so damn appealing . \n\nYes, I'm a sucker for sexy packaging.\n\nBut alas, my visual senses will have to take a back seat to my palate alone when it comes to 5-Star Truffles. I went in prompted by my girlfriend, on a hunt for the perfect champagne accouterment to give with our Christmas gifts. And after sampling flavor after delectable flavor, I ended up buying more than I could possibly give away.

I found their prices very reasonable and the guy even cut me a deal since I was buying a bunch for a large party. I think the inside and the packaging could use a big makeover and it doesn't make me want to linger, but I'm there for the chocolate which is delicious. \nI checked it out before I knew about the whole \"recipe stealing\" drama, but I have to say, I don't really get it. I can't speak to the lying part, and if true, I wouldn't like being lied to either. But, I worked in high-end restaurant kitchens for 10+ years and I can't even count all the sous' to come and go, stealing techniques and exact recipes, and taking them to other places. A lot of guys skip culinary school altogether and simply apprentice in a bunch of kitchens with the express purpose of picking up things along the way. It's an open secret in the food biz and everyone knows it (that's why some places have their sous' sign non-competes or won't give recc letters unless you've been there for at least a year-- XO was lucky to have this guy for 3+). And why does he need someones \"blessing\" to start his own place? I've noticed more local artisanal coffee roasters popping up with the success of Blue Bottle. Are we really supposed to boycott them too if their roasters learned recipes and techniques from BB? Anyways, I personally don't think XO has much to worry about given their high-profile, friendly service and much cuter ambiance, but if Five Star can provide a similar product at a lower price more power to them.", "author": "C R."}
