I would not return here or suggest it to anyone I know. \n\nIt was my first time here and I had heard great things about their food (food is delicious btw), so I decided to give them a try. I went into the shop and wanted to experience everything about it by eating in. However, even before I could order the workers basically kicked me out because I asked to use the restroom first. I don't know about you all, but when my bladder is full, I can't clearly think straight. So, I wanted to use the restroom and wash my hands so that I'd be good and ready to get a good look at the menu and enjoy the food.\n\nHere's my story: \n\nThey keep the restroom door locked and I asked them for the key or if they could open the door for me. They told me someone was in there and to use the restroom next door (at the coffee shop). I decided to wait and after 7minutes of waiting at the door, I knocked on it. (No one responded). I asked them if they had a spare key because it appeared that no one was in the restroom, the lady told me that they only had one key and that I had to wait. \nBy this point, I'm getting ready to pee my pants, so I decided to go next door and use their restroom (customers only- cash only), I would've bought something because I had to pee so bad, but I only had my debit card on me and I wasn't about to waste $3 that I didn't have to pull out $20 for an item worth $2. I went back into the Taqueria and to my surprise, the SAME worker who had told me there was no spare key... was opening the door for an elder lady. I immediately began to cry because I felt discriminated and treated unfairly and at that point I didn't know what to do. \n\nI wanted to walk away and treat myself to lunch somewhere else, but I had plans to enjoy some great Mexican food, plus I had to pee extremely bad.\n\nThe elder lady exited the bathroom and I went in to pee and thought about not giving them my money, but I had just used their customer only bathroom. So, I bought a regular burrito. The price on the menu read $8.70 for a regular burrito , but somehow I ended up paying $11. I didn't even care to ask how that happened, I just wanted to get away from their presence. \n\nWhen ordering, I was not asked if I would be eating here or to go.. && I think at this point the lady could tell I was upset. She did ask me if I wanted cheese on my burrito, which I responded with yes ma'am, but THERE WAS NO CHEESE ON MY BURRITO! \n\nI didn't even get to enjoy the burrito fresh because by the time I got to my car, I had thrown up on the sidewalk and cried for literally 10minutes straight. \n\nIt sucks because I wanted to enjoy their margaritas as well and to try something new that I had seen in a photo, but just that first experience threw everything out of the window. I couldn't even bring myself to ask them what the item was called.\n\nI couldn't give them 1 star because I have to admit, the food speaks for itself... but the workers should learn to respect ALL customers, not just the eldest ones. \n\nThe only thing about the BURRITO was that it was SUPER DRY, they DON'T PUT ANY SOUR CREAM or SALSA or SAUCE on the burrito, but other ingredients were ALRIGHT. I ended up eating half until I was able to make it home to SACRAMENTO and put my own salsa in it.\n\nI hate that I wasn't able to look at their menu and unfortunately I just can't support their business.", "author": "Lanisha S."}

During my teen years, we would stop here for tacos or burritos before or after wandering what was then a non-hip but oh so cool Mision(there's an accent on that O, son.) Then I developed a monster crush on my fellow Peruvian, Mission native Benjamin Bratt, and he declared La Cumbre one of his spots. As the years have gone on, the Mission has changed but La Cumbre has continued to deliver down-home eats in a no-frills ambiance.  \nMy bestie and I have been looking forward to a girls night out with margaritas. When we learned a neighboring restaurant was closed for the holidays, we began to look for another option.  Thankfully, La Cumbre does serve margaritas.  We ordered our food and pitcher of strawberry margaritas. I chose the #7 veggie burrito which comes with guac, sour cream, and your choice of salsa and beans and even tortilla for you foo-foo foodies. I asked for spicy salsa and black beans and said not one word about my tortillas de harina. The burrito was tasty and a perfect complement to all those dranks. As for the margaritas, they were fresh and sweet, if slightly too sweet. We added some salt to our glasses and all was right. \nThe place was busy in waves and some of the customers need to relax. You're in a taqueria, homey. This isn't Chipotle.  One girl said in a whiny voice, \"I'm waiting for my turn. I was next\" when I went near the register to grab napkins.  \"You're good, hon.

I was a weekly regular during the 80s and 90s when I lived and worked nearby. It was wonderful, the best burrito around. I returned this week for a nostalgic visit. I am saddened to say, it is not the same.\n\nThe hallmark of the mission-style burrito is in the steaming of the tortilla first with the cheese steamed into the tortilla before adding the other ingredients so that the cheesiness is the center and surround of the thing. La Cumbre now *grills* the tortilla before beginning preparation, no steaming. This adds a charred grill flavor to every bite that is a noticeable overlay and, for me, takes away from the perfect ingredient bite. Also, because the cheese was added last, it was not melted. \n(Note: mine was the first burrito of the day, so the griller should have been at its cleanest so I can only imagine that this taste gets more pronounced as the grill is used during the day)\n\nNo longer a mission-style burrito, and that may be fine for some, but not the original taste and not what I was looking for.", "author": "Jodi D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-02-06", "description": "This review is following the tip I left behind when I was here. The reason for the one star review is greatly influenced by their etiquette. A couple of friends and I were in the city for a night out, after having a few drinks we wanted some some good food. This place was open and near by. The place was not packed nor was it empty which made for a quick order. The ordering process is pretty easy, the fishy part is that they have no prices anywhere on the wall no even a menu. I went with my go to, a super asada burrito. Go up to pay, see the dude charge me for the burrito (~9.00) then he tacks on another dollar and don't know what else and the total comes out to be ~$11.50 with no drink, just the burrito. Now I saw this, and questioned it but just paid it because I didn't want to deal with it. My friend who ordered tacos and a drink paid $23 for some average tacos. He too thought he got charged extra for something he didn't want nor received. Now the guys working here vary in age and the younger one working here was polite with us. Unfortunately we got rung up by the older employee who gave off a fishy vibe. There are many reasons why he would have done what he did, maybe he believed everyone going there was too drunk to notice, or maybe he took advantage of the non-Mexican folk (I don't look as Mexican as others). Bottom line is that a business that operates like this would not receive my business any more. For anyone else visiting here late night, ask for a receipt and keep an eye out.\n\nThe Food: As I said above, the food was mediocre. The rice was hard and not cooked properly. Not the traditional Mexican orange rice, it lacked flavor. The steak was ok but their cuts of meat made it kind of tough. The portions were good if you're paying the price before getting ripped off. Source: Being raised in a Mexican home serving Mexican food 7 days a week\n\nThe Staff: Read above. 1/5\n\nThe Restaurant: The place does offer plenty of seating and a salsa bar. \n\nAm I going back: Heck no!", "author": "Jesus C."}

Taking a long time to process credit card, our new president doing a good job...Visa can't handle all the orders!\" We both look at him a little baffled, and ask for clarification. He replies that Trump is so good for the economy that people are just going crazy making purchases, and Visa can't keep up. \n\nWish I was kidding. We asked him if he was kidding, and he just looked at us dumbfounded--didn't we agree? Hmm...no, my friend, I don't think someone who has even started their job is responsible for a slow credit card transaction. OK, so politics aside, I don't care what people believe, but the reasoning was just so idiotic as to be funny enough for a yelp review. \n\nSecondarily, I'll say that the quality of this place has just plummeted. It used to be one of my staples, since I have been here in the Mission for about 10 years now. My girlfriend had stomach issues after our trip there a month or so ago, and swore it off. My stomach is made of iron, and I can eat street food in most developing countries without problems, so for me, a good burrito is about ingredients and flavor combos. At best, La Cumbre is mediocre on both, and often the $10 burritos are 90% rice or soggy with their highly watered down sauces. \n\nThere's far better burrito options in the city, especially in the Mission. If La Cumbre is going to be absurd enough to claim to be the \"birthplace of the mission burrito\" (which is painted brightly on its facade sometime recently), it better be good, and, well, it's just not. \n\nOn the upside, the people that work there are usually very friendly.", "author": "Scott C."}

Her chile Colorado was fatty and tough, the rice undercooked and the sauce- well, uninteresting is the best I can say about it. She left most of it on the plate; no point in even bringing it home. My shrimp burrito was mostly rice and beans, with some cooked vegetables and far too few, very small, shrimp that didn't really taste like anything. \nNot sure whats happened to the place.

Ahh I hope I remember how mediocre it was next time I'm here.\n\nThe girl taking our order was so rude. She had a hard time understanding us and would stare at us slack jawed when we ordered. She looked pretty annoyed with us, actually. When we paid we saw that we could get a small boat of chips for $.50 so I ordered two. Those were the nastiest chips ever, they were so stale... I was pretty over this place by then.\n\nThe food was just okay, nothing stood out to us and that says a lot because we were pretty hungry. I ordered the garlic shrimp and steak burrito but I'm pretty sure the girl could care less what kind of shrimp I wanted, so I ended up with a regular shrimp and steak burrito. It was average.

And this is coming from somebody who lived in San Diego, knows burritos, and used to get fish burritos for 4 bucks. I will just say this now. I got the steak burrito, or carne asada as it is better known. This burrito probably had the most meat I've ever eaten in a burrito. To say that they are overpriced is not fair, because they put a lot of meat in them.. I've been to a few places who charge maybe a dollar less but there is substantially less meat. Overall it's not the best burrito I've had, but the quality of the carne asada is very good. Big chunks of meat as if cut from a grilled steak.  I've had burritos where the carne asada looked like ground beef. \n\nI can't comment on the facilities, as I ordered mine on Eat24 to go.

TLC is on Valencia and 16th in The Mission.  I came here w/ my crew after closing down Elbo Room up the street.  This was after checking out Casanova (passed - no sightseeing), a drink at Blondies (boring) and GFU (no translation necessary) at Elbo Room.  \n\nI wanted a caldo, but the only soup available was the menudo.  The menudo was very good.  The broth was skimmed of any fat, there was plenty of tripe, the hominy was nice and fresh, and I was also given a big bone w/ plenty of meat on it.  Additionally, I was given 6 piping hot corn tortillas to dip in the soup, or make tacos de tripas:  4 Stars.\n\nThe service was very good.  The food came out quickly.  In addition, the server who took my order helped me carry my other plate w/ rice, onions and oregano to the table:  4 Stars.  The ambiance was OK.  This is a production line kinda place. You can see them preparing your food as the line moves from the back of the place to the front where the salsa bar is:  3 Stars.\n\nLa Cumbre means The Summit.  I wouldn't say that this place is the \"peak\" of late night Mex places I have been to.  However, the food is hearty, the service is good and the ambiance is OK.

Food program didn't yield more cred for its tasty burritos. In fact, a cursory look at several of the Yelp reviews speak to being disappointed at the quality based on the overtly unctuous claims the constantly smirky Adam Richman was making on that show. First of all, I think looking at Richman as a culinary taste-maker is a likely mistake since he looks like he would eat anything without much discretion. Now if Anthony Bourdain said their burritos were great, well... \n\nSecond, the $6.25 Super Vegetarian Burrito I had the other night was really good - full of fresh guacamole, shredded cheese, black beans, rice and a bounty of grilled vegetables (see photo). I also noticed how the staff worked extra hard in accommodating orders. I was there with five out-of-town colleagues who were looking for a typical \"San Francisco dive experience\". They actually waited on us like it was a regular restaurant, which I thought was above & beyond the service we would have received at similar-level Mission taquerias.\n\nCancun, El Farolito or Pancho Villa would simply expect you to pick it up yourself. Now I'm more motivated to return and try the $6.75 Vegetarian Taco Salad or the $5.75 Rice Bowl accompanied by one of their $3.75 \"Fruit Sensations\". The chips and salsa we shared were probably a bit more standard-tasting, but frankly my humongous burrito was so filling that I barely noticed with my bottle of Corona (or two). It was about 6:30PM on a weeknight, so it wasn't crowded. I'm not sure when the punch-drunk clubbers and aromatic hipsters start to show up in droves.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...a stellar veggie burrito as far as I'm concerned\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...roomy but in need of more comfortable stools\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...table service? wow...\nTOTAL - 4 stars...in the battle between Ed U.

I loved the smell of the carne  asada being grilled and the hustle and bustle of the large crowds waiting to order.\n\nPresent day? The place was empty. There was no aroma of fresh carne asada being cooked. I still decided to order, big mistake. First the lady making my burrito removes some foil over some precooked carne asada. From what I noticed it was the last of their leftovers from the previous night because, there were no other customers inside the restaurant and it was barely enough to spread to the mid point of the tortilla. \n\nI paid and began to unwrap the foil from my burrito hoping by some magical power the burrito would be as good as I had during my childhood. Unfortunately, no such luck. I would say my burrito was 90% refried beans and rice. I got to the about half way through my burrito and there was no more meat. Just tortilla and little pieces of rice and beans.\n\nI left disappointed but, since I'm lucky enough to live in the City there are plenty of other options when it comes to burritos!

My burrito, a Supreme Meat monster on a spinach tortilla stuffed with delicious and flavorful carnitas, was so tasty--UNTIL I bit down on a large bone.

The burrito was so good I was willing to keep eating it despite the bone. Generally not one to hold negative feelings towards bones, I persevered! Surely another bone couldn't possibly be in my meal! Alas, two bites later, I found another, larger bone. Strangely saddened, I retired my unfinished burrito, leaving it sadly abandoned in its red, plastic basket.

Advice to management: bring prices back down to appropriate taqueria levels, hire the nice ladies back, and add some spices to your food.

The burrito had one flavor: grease.  Now, don't get me wrong. I think grease in a burrito is a great thing.  But the carnitas I ordered were soft and mushy, the tomatoes had lost all texture, and the beans barely registered as part of my burrito.  Everything tasted pretty bland and unseasoned, not even salted, and it was a pretty underwhelming experience.  \n\n-1 Star because I got some bad food poisoning, and I'm pretty sure it was from here.   They don't refrigerate their burrito toppings, like salsa and guac, and they had no AC.  It was during this heat wave, so I'm pretty sure it hit about 90 in there.  That's the perfect zone for bacterias, and they definitely seemed to be having a party.   \n\nThey also charged my friend for cheese and guacamole, even though he ordered a super burrito that comes with them as standard ingredients.", "author": "Josephine F."}

I even had quite a few drinks earlier so you would think anything would have been tasty ... not this burrito.  I somehow missed adding cheese, or do they not have cheese?

This is the burrito spot, hands down. \n\nWhen ppl want recommendations for Mexican food I ask them what subcategory they are looking for (tacos, coctels, Milanese, pozole, best chips and salsa, prawns, burrito, wet burrito) there's different places for each that I recommend.  I used to not eat red meat- stupid, not for any reason other than we ate a lot of it growing up and I was just totally done with it.  One night after dancing and drinking in the mission we ended up at La Cumbre.  They were cooking this sizzling glistening carne asada and I was captivated by it (I was also wearing this random slip over my clothes that I had found in a bag of discarded clothes I found on the street for comedic affect.  There is no shame in my game.) I ordered an asada burrito and I never looked back. The other thing that makes this burrito stand on a different level aside from the glorious meat is the flour tortilla.  Now I'm not sure if u will know what I'm talking about but let me try: u know how most flour tortillas are kinda sticky or tacky esp after being steamed and wrapped in foil?  Those kind often have what I can only describe as an artificial flavor to them, But then there's homemade legit flour tortillas that are not sticky and have a Powderly floury feel to them? And they don't taste artificial and like sour they taste fresh and just like a real flour tortilla should. These tortillas are too legit to quit.\n\nI intended this to be just a short and sweet review just telling people to go have burritos here and, as usual, I have gone on and on but just go have a carne asada burrito at la cumbre.", "author": "Emma H."}

I said no and he responded with a bit of tude and put that burrito aside and proceeded to make me another one. Then at the end he scooped up some rice with meat in it and put it in my burrito. He definitely saw that little piece of meat but folded up my burrito anyway and gave it to me. At this point I was starving so I just paid for my burrito and ate it carefully looking out for that piece of meat that guy spitefully put in. However the owner was nice and gave my friend and I mints and was super pleasant. Everything except the meat in my burrito (which luckily was at the end so I didn't eat that part) was delicious and the owner or manager was super nice.

I think they marinate it in pineapple sauce or something. The bottom line is that it's delicious and is slightly sweet and goes great with black beans. I usually get a taco or burrito with that combo. \n\n2. Their horchata is perfectly sweetened. Not too sweet, not too watery. This is a rare quality in horchata. \n\n3. They are open later than any other taqueria around 16th and Valencia (except on Sundays. That's the Lord's day, after all...). \n\n4.

The nachos were the simple chips and cheese type but still tasted great. The burrito was beyond amazing. It was jam packed with generous portions of chicken, guacamole, salsa, beans, rice, and cheese.

I pointed this out, and assumed that was the end of it, I mean, it goes without saying how illegal it is to charge a different price than what you advertise on the menu, so when the cashier just shrugged and said \"the menu is old\" I was kind of blown away.

Recommendations of others, and I trust Adam's big taste.  I went in expecting to say LA has far superior tacos and burritos, and I'm at least half correct.\n\nWe went in after closing time, but they were nice enough to let us in.  We were the last order of the day, but they didn't half-ass it.  Even with two really annoying customers in front of us, they kept their cool and gave great service.\n\nThey had only carne asada since it was so late in the night.  No problem, I was getting a carne asada burrito anyway.  I was surprised how much care they took while cooking it, and it was by no means overcooked or under seasoned.  I was really happy with the end of the order.  After they wrapped up the burrito, she asked if it was okay.  Que?  Well, actually I like a little more beans.  Ok!  All the right options, hot or mild salsa, yes or no onions/cilantro, what kind of beans.\n\nSo why not that last star?  The fiance got a deluxe veggie taco.  $3.45 got her a small taco tortilla, beans, cheese, guacamole, and lettuce.  So what makes that deluxe.  Let's go back... what makes that $3.45?!  If you charge that much, make it worth it.  I'd be pissed if I was a vegetarian.  I would call that a mini soft tostada, and charge $2.  With no meat, I don't see how they can charge that much.\n\nAs for the salsas, all amazing, especially the green avocado salsa with onions.  But I liked the red just as much.  I can't wait to come back.  Oh, and it definitely keeps up with LA burritos.  I'll still take my El Atacor and Guisados down here, but this gets the job done in the Bay Area.", "author": "Matt C."}

Well I looked it up online and it's a large flour tortilla wrapped in foil and filled with rice, beans, meat, and other condiments like guacamole, sour cream and eaten by unwrapping the foil slowly as you go down and pouring salsa with each subsequent bite. If you've never been and are a bit more mainstream this Chipotle. The flour tortilla is a west coast thing.\n\n\nWith that being said I didn't enjoy the carne asada, I loved how it was fresh cut to order, but not fresh cooked, it didn't have that sizzle off the grill freshness and the flavor was forgettable. The salsa's were ok, but the flavors didn't differentiate and or pop and the fresca was bland. The burrito overall was lacking in that each of the flavors were ok, but the melding and the flavor in each bite left me regretting not getting adobada or using a hotter salsa. The guacamole was the thicker kind with no noticeable lemon and no visible cilantro/onions\n\nLike most shops in the area they were open late night, so I did go here after hitting up some nightlife and yes it was packed, a good sign.

The Travel Channel does not lie.\n\nHuge convenience factor with TLC being on Velencia in a thicket of bars (Valencia/Mission/16th St) and close to multiple public transit options.\n\nSo is the food really amazing? I honestly can't recall... yes? I just remember being much happier with tacos from TLC floating around in my liquid filled stomach. I'd say that means yes, I'm a fan.", "author": "Justin N."}

Yes, you can get a basic burrito anywhere in The Mission but their ingredients are inferior. I like that La Cumbre's meats and seafood are of high quality.

With so many negative changes in our city over the years, I take comfort in retuning to places that I love. I've been coming to La Cumbre for decades. Back in the 80s it was the BEST steak burrito in The City. I used to often travel from the western reaches of San Francisco all the way to The Mission just to partake in one of their delicious, succulent burritos. There were lines out the door for the place. Flash forward to today and I find La Cumbre to be a sad, faded imitation of what it once was. The other day I walked in, the place was nearly empty and the food looked like it had been sitting around all day. No meats on the grill. Only old meat getting cold in the bins. I had a sad, cold poorly made, bland burrito. I could not finish it, it was below mediocre. It was simply terrible. I don't know if the place went through an ownership change over the years, but they used to take such pride in the place, such pride in the quality of the food. It was fresh. The meats were cooked fresh and served hot. That is now all long, long gone. The whole attitude of the joint is sad now. I'll not be back again.", "author": "Bob S."}

I was weary - it only had 3 stars, and there are so many 4 star places within a stone's throw...\n \nBut, we decided to risk it anyway. \n \nTo start with, the service was less than friendly.  Yes, we came about 15 minutes before closing time, and I understand that can be annoying, but we only ordered burritos.  We weren't staying for hours, luxuriously eating an extravagant meal and holding up their evening.  Also, I KNOW the staff must speak and understand enough English to be able to answer a question or two about the food...but they pretended not to. \n \nI was debating the super veggie burrito ($6) and something with shrimp or salmon ($9 - $10), and ended up going for the super veggie - beans, rice, cheese, guac, pico de gallo, sour cream.  My friend got the same, but with some sort of meat.\n \nSo, we sat down, ready to eat our burritos.  I got up to ask the girl behind the counter for a knife to cut my burrito in half:\n \n\"Excuse m-\"\n \n\"CLOSED!\"\n \n\"I just need a knife to cut my burrito.\"\n \nShe pointed to the silverware off to the side of the register. \n \nAnyway, the burrito was really nothing special.  The beans didn't have much flavor, I couldn't taste the salsa or guac at all...my friend said his burrito was just okay too.

I eat there at least three or four times a week and have never been disappointed with my meal. The quality of the meat is much better than that of certain other burrito places in the neighborhood and the atmosphere is much friendlier than the trendy, outrageously expensive places posing as authentic Mexican and Latin American food up the street. I get the grilled chicken and it is always so tasty.  The salsa is always fresh. A really great meal costs under ten dollars. The staff is gracious and kind. You'd be hard-pressed to find this kind of stellar service from other burrito places in the neighborhood.\n\nI have been going to La Cumbre for over 25 years and have never had a negative experience. These people will make every effort to get things right. They have never gotten anything wrong with my orders, but I have seen them handle crowds and complicated orders with grace and compassion. They will treat you well and your food will taste great. It's a great spot to get a quick and delicious meal without a lot of hassle and complication. I also know that they do orders for special events, so if you are planning a party or hosting people for a game or whatever, they could save you a lot of trouble by doing the cooking for you.\n\nNewcomers might be interested to know that La Cumbre has been a neighborhood institution since 1967.  So many people have walked through here and called it home - famous baseball players, famous musicians - several of them have left mementos which adorn the walls. It is a place rich with stories and you can really feel that vibe as you are sitting there.  For all of us who have been in the neighborhood for decades, it's been a part of our own story too; its reliable food and comfortable atmosphere have seen us through many a late night movie outing, helped us get that first date off the ground or fortified us before our favorite bands played at clubs that no longer exist today. I hope the younger generation just coming to the Mission will have as many great conversations inside those walls as we have had. Our neighborhood has weathered many changes but  La Cumbre lives on.

I like a burrito chock full of stuff so I normally ask for the works but I don't know of any other taqueria that adds lettuce in theirs. It makes it all runny and mushy and that alone will make my stomach turn.\n\nPlus, I'll always stand by places that have legit chips and this place has those stale, store bought ones. Meh. They can do better. Especially being in such a prime location. \n\nWhile they have a big menu, I didn't think they had much selection. I remember the last time I went in there they didn't have something I was craving for.

Period.\n\nI was mildly drunk and starving when I went here and it was still bad. When I'm drunk I devour everything in sight. Not this. This was utter sh*t.\n\nSWEET! The dude from Man Vs. Food went here and ate a colossal burrito! I guess that's their selling point, but honestly, with all of the incredible Mexican food in the Mission (arguably the best in the state) why on earth would you go here.\n\nThe chicken was coated in BBQ sauce, which turned out to be pretty gross. Don't get me wrong, I sometimes LOVE BBQ sauce in my burrito (I'm looking at you, Freebirds) but this was just BAD. It was uncharred chicken (despite being cooked on a grille) smothered in a foul tasting BBQ sauce. NASTY.\n\nI'd describe the rest of the ingredients in my burrito as \"lettuce and tomato\", because that's what it was. They SLOPPED lettuce on and sliced tomatos (yes, not pico de galo, SLICED TOMATO). REALLY? Sliced tomatos? I've never had that in my burrito before. It was like they started making a burrito and half way through they were like \"f*ck it, let's make a sandwich.\"\n\nNever going here again!!!!!!!!", "author": "Gabe P."}

I have to say that your staff was embellishing the situation when they were telling you there was a high turnover and the restaurant was packed. The restaurant was far from packed, at best, half of the tables were occupied, and while there may have been people drinking at the nearby bars, there was absolutely no 'off the hook partying' anywhere in your business.\n\nTo be clear, we only walked down the street for a couple of stores. We did not enter any other store, and the last place she used her phone was at our table in your restaurant. I remember that clearly. So to answer your question, it is impossible that she left her phone at another store on Valencia. Your restaurant was the only business we entered that night.\n\nAgain a discrepancy in the story that your staff is telling you. The waitress herself did offer the use of her phone, but the manager only came out onto the scene, he did not address us directly, and I do not remember him offering his phone to us. I did appreciate the waitress offering her phone for our use.\n\nOf course we are not the first people to lose a phone in SF. I don't think that issue is under debate. We did not demand to call the police. We stated that if they return the phone right then, we would not pursue criminal charges, but if we return home, use the location tracking on the phone, and find that the phone is indeed located in the restaurant, or in possession by the waitress, we would pursue criminal charges.\n\nWith regard to your accusations of racism, I feel that you are projecting onto me when you find my review racist. Spiteful? That's up to your judgment, but I never mentioned race in my review, nor did I make any judgments based on race, and I certainly don't consider my statements racist in any sense. I take particular offense in your statement that I said: \"It sounds like you are saying that all \"Hispanics\" are poor and steal.\", because I most surely did not say anything of that sort.\n\nAn iPhone is an expensive piece of hardware, and would be tempting for anyone of any economic status, race, or gender. As an aside, there are actually many people who are financially well off who still commit theft, so I don't think I am implying that people steal because they are poor.\n\nI was going to abstain from responding and just move on, but I felt that your accusation of racism warranted a response. I am not racist, and I feel strongly offended when I am accused of being racist. I have experienced discrimination based on race before and I certainly do not intend on putting someone else through that same experience.\n\nLastly, I was not impressed by your food before losing the phone. Perhaps you will not believe me, but I would not have been kind in my review to your business even if we did not lose a phone there.\n\nI wish you the best with your business, but I will not be a future customer. This is not an underhanded request for special treatment, just how I feel. There are plenty of taquerias in the area that I feel are better value for my money.", "author": "Innie K."}

It was one of the Top Eats and it was just a 15 min commute away from my home in San Francisco. As you know, I went there expecting it to be a totally EPIC Mexican food experience. I ordered a super Quesadilla ( a lot of food, I know) and my friend ordered some fish tacos.\n\n1. My super Quesadilla was  bleh. The cheese was not even melted all the way!!!!! So turned off, haha.   The meat was decently marinated, but the ingredients were just not that fresh. Overall I was not pleased. \n\n2. My friend's fish taco was just not pleasant at all. They microwaved a piece of fried fish they got from somewhere and throw it in a tortilla and threw some sour cream on it. The fish was not fresh and was soggy. Ew. \n\nThe staff were a bit slow and though they saw me waiting, they continued chatting about something for a 3-5 minutes before addressing me. The restaurant is spacious and decently clean ( dont sit near the bathroom) and the food prices are the same anywhere for Mexican food. \n\nAs I walk down the street, after my meal, disappointed and feeling deceived  , I see many more nicer looking Taquerias and even some with more people.

And what's the deal with the carrots and unnecessary huge chunks of veggies? Hmm...\n\nDespite the Saturday night fun and the hoard of hipsters all throughout the Mission, La Cumbre was still busy. Service was smooth though. The place is real spacious and has that authentic Mission district vibe. There's plenty of places to sit, so you don't have to wait for people to finish eating. It's just the level of cleanliness you have to worry about. \n\nIf I was back here, I would surely try other menu items. But for Mexican food, burritos are my true go-to food. Fact of the matter is, all that's in a burrito and how it's made tells you a lot. And I think La Cumbre still has some explainin' to do. Nonetheless, it was decent.", "author": "Will S."}

Was drinking in the mission last night and popped in here early on for a quick bite.  Had my usual favorite that I've always ordered over the years, a carne asada burrito and a bottle of Dos Equis XX.  The beer went with the burrito very well and was a total rarity since I'm a cocktail or wine guy and drink beer only once or twice a year.\n\nAnyway, the carne asada in the burrito was okay although chopped a little small and was kinda dry and tough.  I can live with that, but the way it was rolled was so that the ingredients inside made it a half and half burrito.  Either you took a bite that was all meat or you took a bite that was all rice, beans, and lettuce (not big on lettuce).  I asked for it a little hot, but there was no evidence of hot sauce and it was the blandest burrito I've had in years.\n\nThe best part of the whole meal was their chips and also two really good salsas that I got at their free salsa bar.  One of them really impressed me.  So savory with a hint of sweetness before the spices hit.  It really surprised me.  As for the rest of the experience, I used to really love this place so I don't know what happened, but it will be some time before I am back again.  Way too many good burrito places to go in the bay area.  \n\nMy feeling is similar to that of Jen S's review.  I thought the food on this visit was probably only two stars, but I'll also give them one extra for the chips and salsa bar.

Well I liked some of their salsas in their bar. I don't know if I would come back since there's so many other taquerias that curb my Mexican cravings in the city but I would if I'm around perhaps. I hope I don't get attacked for my opinion lol I get that \"celebrities\" come here ok and that you guys were in maxim 5 years ago and on sf paper that's cool!

A side trip to SF landed me here with a little help from a feature segment in a show called Man V Food (thanks, adam). \n\nTASTE. Hands down, you gotta try their version of the \"super burrito\". I understand everybody has their own but la cumbre's is can't miss stuff. Weighing at a little over 2 pounds, this infant-sized monster is stuffed with the usual suspects - rice, beans, lettuce, guac, pico de gallo, sour cream plus your own choice of meat (in this case I chose to go for the carnitas in chile verde). Added a bucket load of their home-made fresh salsa and BAM.. the rest was history.\n\nSERVICE. We went on a busy friday lunch; place was packed. Not too happy with the wait but didn't seem to mind it at all. We got good seating right away and the salsa bar was such a thrill 'coz of their wide array of condiment concoctions. We had to park on the street since there's no parking, but then again - this is SF. \n\nPRICE. Forgot exactly how much I paid for a super burrito and a large horchata (yum) but fersure it wasn't over 10 bucks. Not bad at all. \n\nOverall, La Cumbre is one must-eat spot in SF's mission area.

There was even a point when I could eat an entire one and still be hungry. \n\nAlas, my days of being gordo are long gone and I have ushered in a new era of sticking to tacos and less dense options. \n\nBut after some drinks at Kilowatt, my friend and I walked around the corner to La Cumbre and were enticed by the burrito options. It was closing in on 8pm and I was starving. I can usually eat dinner pretty late but only if I have a snack. WIth a snack consisting of only vodka & cranberry juice (side note: was supposed to be gin & tonic), I was starving. It was matter over mind and the only thing that mattered was making the grumblies go away. \n\nSo I ordered one of their monstrous burritos with carne asada, black beans, spicy salsa, guac and cheese. They throw a cow's worth of cheese on, so let them know if you want it ligther than that. Along with some chips and a trip to the salsa bar, I sat down on my stool, ripped open the double layer of aluminum foil, and shoved that thing as far back into my mouth as I could. \n\nAfter gagging on 2 inches, I took it out and ate the rest like a famished gentleman. \n\nIt was delicious! I was legitimately stuffed after 3/4 of the burrito, but my manly ego wouldn't let me stop. In my best Homer Simpson meets Jenna Maroney impersonation, I said \"Must. Finish. Bur-RI-to.\" And I did. And I whined about it for the next 16 hours.\n\nWe went to the coffee shop next door afterwards but I couldn't even look at the menu without wanting to give birth to my new child. \n\nNeedless the say, the food was really good!

The cashier looked at me like I was on crack. She said, \"No we don't have orange juice.\" I reminded her that I wanted carrot juice... I mean I had just seen a girl walk down the street holding one and I assumed she got it here, it was right there on the wall. But alas, NO, she said they didn't offer it. Minus 1 point for that.\n\nMy chicken burrito was quite tasty but for some reason I thought the meat to rice/bean ratio was off. I like a little more beans and rice in my burrito. Their salsas were good but for some reason the green avocado/tomatillo one tasted like refrigerator that day. I was bummed about that! Overall, they have a nice selections of salsas and garnishes in their salsa bar. Their chips are alright, nothing to write home about.\n\nOne interesting thing I noticed on the menu was that they offer a falafel burrito. That's some serious fusion right there. My veggie friend got it and said it was good. I was too freaked out to try it but I give them props for their originality. Both friends I took said they enjoyed their food and were rather shocked when I told them this place was only average compared to the best that the Mission has to offer.\n\nI'd say I would go back, but only if I'm too tired or lazy to walk to El Farolito on 24th and Mission.", "author": "L.

Others are open for a select time. Taqueria La Cumbre is one of those wee hours places. My brother and I decided to try it post-concert and drove on by at about 11:30 PM. \n\nWe were in a sketchy part of town for that time of night. In the daytime, I'm sure the charm would have shown through. In the evening, that charm retreated behind metal shutters. \n\nThe food was decent. It's not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but they grill the meat when you order it. I had the carne asada burrito. It was a decent size, but a little spendy for what I got. Maybe it's because I go to the taco truck and spend a max of $4-5 on a meal. Meh *shrug*. The meat was delicious, but the other innards didn't fare as well. The beans were bland as was the rice. I was hoping I could save it with some salsa.... but alas it just added some moisture to the rice. \n\nMy brother got the chicken burrito. He had the same complaints as I did, but I have to admit that the chicken was darn tasty!

The hustle and bustle of the staff and customers made it feel good to be there enjoying the food on a saturday afternoon.\n\nThe prices are a little high, as some reviewers have referred to the Man vs. Food episode as an impetus for that.

In isolation this wouldn't be a big deal, but at this point I have to acknowledge that this is a trend.\n\nCumbre was always dependable, solid, with friendly people and generous portions and delicious carne asada-- chewy, but delicious. La Cumbre was, for me, a go-to taqueria. Like up to three times a week sometimes.\n\nOver the past several months the quality of the ingredients and size of the portions has gone down. Burritos have grown smaller, with less of the good stuff and more rice. Avocados have grown less ripe even during peak season. Salsa has gotten runnier and less tasty, and finally tonight the salsa bar didn't even have to-go salsa cups at the bar, you have to ask for them at the counter, at which point they will give you two. Ask for four and they will grudgingly hand over the other two.\n\nThe people are still friendly overall, though. Maybe there are enough out-of-towners and walk-ins coming in to make the compromises Cumbre has made in quality and quantity profitable. I tend to doubt it, given the relatively low cost of the ingredients and the wealth of other options out there... Los Coyotes, Pancho Villas, and El Toro are all better options at this point, all within a block of La Cumbre.\n\nI hope Cumbre gets back on track.

I ordered a chili verde chicken burrito, but I think the woman making it misunderstood me, because I ended up with the grilled chicken.  Eh, no matter.  Grilled is good too.\n\nThis burrito had a few excellent qualities.  First, the rice, which was excellent, and the refried beans, which were very tasty as well.  Also, the grilled chicken had a really nice grill-flavor.  However, the meat was a bit on the dry side, even for grilled chicken, and a little more fatty than I generally like.  More curious than ever what the chili verde is like & will probably have to try it here at some point.\n\nThe other reason for the dry-ness was the lack of tasty salse.  There were three different salsas in the salsa bar when I was there (plus lots of other sides, like jalapenos, corn, radishes, and ranch dressing), so I got some of each.  Sadly, none of them made the cut, which means I ate most of my burrito salsa-less.  This is part of what contributed to the dry-ness.  There was a bright-red tomato-based one that was just bland, a darker, brown-colored one that looked promising but was so hot I couldn't anything for a few minutes after tasting it (which is saying something, given my predilection for teh spicy), and a green avocado-based one that was okay, but sort of bland, and too onion-y for my taste.  So the salsa situation made me sad.\n\nStill, not too many complaints about the burrito itself.  I'll be curious to see whether the chili verde version takes care of the dry-ness issue.", "author": "Angela B."}

While simple tricks like steaming tortillas have trickled down to even the likes of Chipotle, La Cumbre still engages in the barbaric practice of grilling them dry post-assembly. The burritos are bland, with an unpleasant texture and oddly homogeneous filling.\n\nEating here is like watching a Simpsons short from the Tracy Ullman show after a string of Season 6 episodes. You can respect where the stuff you love came from while still being slightly repulsed. At best, La Cumbre is a testament to how far we've come.", "author": "August K."}

Loved the fact that they took my AMEX card for a $6 purchase and they didn't snicker at me one bit. I would have paid cash, but spent it all at another food joint that was cash-only.\n\nFOOD - 1 Stars: Maybe this place was built up in my head, having seen Adam Richman visit La Cumbre during his Man vs Food San Francisco episode. Everything on television looked fantastic. Unfortunately, it didn't have any taste. I ordered 1 carnitas taco and 1 al pastor taco. I had their \"medium\" and their \"spicy/hot\" salsas. EVERYTHING on my plate was extremely bland. The only bits of flavor were the salt crystals on my tortilla chips. Al pastor usually has tons of flavor. Carnitas usually has hints of spices and salt. The 2 salsas I had were so bland.\n\nATMOSPHERE - 3 Stars: What you might expect from a neighborhood taqueria that's been around for years. I don't think their goal is to wow their customers, as they definitely have a solid customer base.\n\nBottom line... everyone has their own preferences on food; especially taquerias.

However, the lengua is superb here, and I have not found lengua to match at other tacquerias.\n\nWhat makes the lengua so great: first, it's tender.  As a friend explained to me, lengua must be made over a long period of time or it will be too hard to chew, and I've had experiences at other taquerias where the lengua just seemed hard to chew.  \n\nSecond, you can choose the lengua in a nice tasty salsa sort of sauce that permeates the lengua with this mild spiciness.  It's wonderful drenching the black beans and the tortilla.  It's crucial to get the chips that are free so that you can eat a good amount of the lengua and beans with the chips.  The tortilla gets rather soggy between the beans and the sauce in which the lengua is cooked.  However, near the end, I roll up the few pieces of lengua and small amount of beans and salsa and quickly stuff it into my mouth before it falls apart.  \n\nBy the way, if you haven't had lengua before...it's tongue.  It has a slightly gamey taste...sort of like what you might taste in lamb, but less strong (in my opinion).  I love lamb, so lengua works perfectly for my tastebuds.  Consult your tastebud before ordering lengua. \n\nVery cheap: taco is $2.40 ($2.60 with tax).  I might move up to the super taco with lengua next time.", "author": "Sooj O."}

I am sure when you're drunk, hung over, or when you get the munchies at 3 am, this place is the cat's meow.\n\nWhen I came here for lunch earlier today, sober and a little tired, I didn't feel like I got 5-star food.  It's no La Taqueria, let me tell ya, although the decor is surprisingly similar.\n\nI have a lot of, umm, eccentricities, and one of them is that I don't like wrapped foods: you know, burritos, chicken wraps and whatnot.  I feel that eating something wrapped is akin to injecting yourself with food.  Food should be enjoyed, not wrapped in a giant tortilla for your convenience.  \n\nBut I digress.  Anyway, I try to order a platter whenever possible.  This time I had a combination platter: carne asada, pollo asada, re-fried beans, rice, lettuce, tomato and cucumbers.  This, with some tortillas, guacamole and sour cream, set me back $11.  The chicken was good, but the steak was a bit overcooked.  I really liked that they cooked it in front of you.  It was definitely fresh, but not that great.  Their version of guacamole was this weird looking liquid . . . it really looked more like an avocado agua fresca.  I had no intention of trying it.  Corn tortillas were small and excessively greasy.\n\nThey said that La Cumbre was the original San Francisco taqueria, and I believe it.

Mostly I think it's just your average, cheap Mexi-cali filler.\n\nSo what would make someone come here, when there's so many other great Mission taquerias around, besides the \"must have food, before I pass out\" instinct that typicaly overtakes one near the corner of 16th and Valencia?  Why of course it's the Cumbre!  . . . which is what exactly?  As the guy behind the counter explained, it's something like the Peak, of a mountain.

Ok Chicken taco it is!\n\nAs I was paying for the taco I hear two girls in the restaurant scream bloody murder. They jump up and down and all I can see is spilled beer and these girls huddled in a corner. The workers are all laughing. I ask my cousin what happened and she says, \"You didn't see the rat?\" \n\nMe: Rat?\n\nCousin: Yeah it just walked out the door all slowly (cousin mimics something fat slowly waddling out the door)\n\nMe: Ok...\n\nHahahah this did not stop me from eating my taco at the establishment. I just wanted to eat it a little faster. My taco was brimming with ingredients. Pico de gallo, chicken, and black beans. It was so packed I had to get a fork to eat it. The chicken had a nice bbq flavor to it. Good deal for the price but nothing spectacular about the taste really. And ok... maybe the rat soured my experience a little.\n\nThat was a colorful start to my night out drinking in the Mission.", "author": "kimy l."}

The meat is seemingly grilled to order (BBQ pork and grilled chicken are both great).

However, the less than stellar reviews are spot on.\n\nI'd give this place 2 stars had I not known this place could be where the Mission style burrito was invented.  The rice and beans are terribly bland.  Not only that, they dominate the burrito, so it's hard to taste all the other things in the burrito.  The guacamole is fairly watery and not very tasty.  So do you want a huge burrito that isn't particularly tastey?  The only positive spin I can put on this is since this place is open late, it might be good after drinking if you're around the area.

One chicken, black bean, rice, and cheese burrito (and hailed taxi) later, I was in a bliss I knew I inherited from my father.

Keep in mind I grew up Massachusetts where El Torito is considered authentic.\n\nThen brother took me to Zeigeist.

Pretty good salsa bar...before it gets mangled by a days use though.\n\n2.  The chicken fajita burrito.  This thing is really, really good.  I have not tried anything else on their menu nor do I intend to.  I can get a better 'standard' burrito at a number of other places, but the way they do this monster up is seriously tasty.  The chicken is shredded and there are peppers and carrots and I don't know what else but it's GOOD.

We were quite pleased: my husband had the pollo chile verde, our son ordered a carne asada burrito, our daughter had the grilled shrimp (huge and juicy) tostada salad and I went for the chile colorado plate. Portions were very large, salsa bar was amazing and fresh, and everyone enjoyed their meal. Although I have to say the meat in the chile colorado was very tender and the sauce very deliciously spicy, it can't compare to what my mom used to cook. But honestly, I don't think ANY Mexican place can ever compare to my mother's cooking.  So, call me spoiled, but we all enjoyed our meal, and the staff was very friendly, especially when my husband tried to order in Spanish (then he asked me to help him) and the kids threw out their orders in Spanish, also. \nWe also enjoyed the layout and decor (made me think of when I was a little girl) and the Mission is always a cool place to check out the local art. \nSo there!", "author": "Elma R."}

It's much like other taqueria joints in the mission for the most part. What sets this place apart (for better of worse) is that the food is less greasy. Their veggies include carrots, which is a bit weird. Carrots in your fajitas? I was hungry for Mexican food and had about an hour to enjoy my meal with a fun book to read. After scoping out many reliable taquerias in the mission, I decided on this place, because I knew that the food was reliable and I wouldn't be feel bad for hogging a table while I finished my meal and read a chapter or two. I ended up ordering a shrimp quesedilla, which had way too much liquid in it.  I don't want to bite into a dripping quesedilla. It also had carrots inside. CARROTS!!!!!! Yuck!

I ate there today 10/10/12 at 2pm and was less than impressed. I by no means thought that this was going to be the worst burrito i have ever had but it was. There was no flavor in the chicken and the spicy salsa was not spicy at all. The cheese that went into my burrito was not melted and tasted like it was not covered in the fridge when they stored. You know when you dont cover something and it actually absorbs all the flavors of the food sitting in the fridge. Thats what it tasted like. The chips weren't bad but there really wasn't anything special about them and they weren't even warm.  My girlfriend got one steak and one carnitas tacos and they were also terrible.

This place is like your really smart friend who didn't have too much direction and ended up going to Junior College, only to drop out after the first year because they found that getting high was way more fulfilling than showing up to class. \n\nDuring peak hours, when they are cooking the meat fresh, La Cumbre can have some of the most top notch carne asada in the city. Also, their re-fried beans really put every other bean in close proximity to shame. Kidney, black, pinto, green, string, and any other goddamn  bean look like chumps when compared to La Cumbres' re-fried warriors. \n\nThis place, although having potential, makes some really ridiculous errors. First, they load their burritos with lettuce and sliced tomato. Like the shit you find in a sandwich. Second, they have the goddamn word 'prawn' listed in about seven of their entrees, yet every time I ask about the prawn they can't seem to to find it. \"Check in the fridge\" I tell them. \"No prawn today!\" they scream. The most vile sin they commit though is  their version of 'baja-style fish taco'. Now I've eaten fish tacos in baja mexico, goddammit, and I've also eaten them at Rubio's, which isn't saying too much, but I have never in my life ordered a baja fish taco and been served fish that has been sitting in a heating troph.

This was the burrito of my youth, my first love in the world of taquerias.  I am happy to say that my love has not wavered. \n\nWhat must be said however is that I don't go here for anything but the carne asada burrito.  The steak here is second to none.  I see a lot of bad reviews on La Cumbre, and they are from people eating chicken tortas and other nonsense mistake orders.  They should just call this place Carne Asada's, because that's the only thing you should order here.  Everything else is mediocre.  But the carne asada burrito is so damn good, I just can't get enough.  The reason is this is the only place I've ever seen that flame barbecues their steak, in true carne asada fashion.  All other taquerias use their big flat grills, and they can't capture the flame-cooked deliciousness of La Cumbre steak.  I highly recommend ordering just steak, cheese, and maybe a little rice and beans, but I often just go meat and cheese or meat and rice.  Don't even drown it out with salsa or pico de gallo.   Just enjoy the asada in all its glory.", "author": "Dan B."}

Few places were open so late and we had already left the bar.  We pop into La Cumbre for the first time in both of our combined residence in the City.  I order the super nachos for us to split and then high-tail it to the potty.  When I come out I find complete shenanigans on a plate!  It suddenly dawns on me why this place is so empty when the streets are full of hungry drunk kids.  The nachos came complete with canned \"nacho\" cheese and the super neon \"guacamole sauce.\"  I was horrified.  What self-respecting taqueria uses fake cheese???  I couldn't eat it.  Kyle took it back and asked them if they could make it over with real cheese.  They did, but that crazy green sauce was still on it.  Yeach.  We couldn't finish it between the two of us and that is saying a lot.\n\nAnd oh, the gas that ensued.\n\nI will be fair and give them a bonus star for having a clean restroom and remaking the otherwise inedible nachos for me.\n\nBut don't go.

The sense of deja vu as I walked through the door tells me I may have even eaten here a time or two before  (what can I say? so I like to get black out drunk from time to time..!?). I went with a carne asada super burrito. What immediately caught my eye is that they're always grillin' fresh meat, and they don't chop your meat until they're ready to put it in your burrito. This is probably the secret to why their carne asada is freakin juicy and wonderful! Now this place does defy the law of burrito spots in that their chips suck, AND you have to pay extra for them. Usually a bad chip is the sign of a bad burrito joint and their chips are so bad I feel like I should almost take another star off, but their burritos are good enough I'm gonna leave that fourth star juuuuust where it is.", "author": "Jeff S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-16", "description": "I had to give La Cumbre 5 stars because I eat so many of their burritos and I think they are the best (I guess. its hard to decide something like that; different burritos are good for different reasons.) But for value, and actual cuts of lovely skirt steak used for their carne asada, they are truly remarkable. The cheese they use is also especially tasty. Their beans are really great too. The spicy pico-de-gallo also. The guacomole they use is really the iffy part of the equation, but I just love La Cumbre.", "author": "Ben B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-20", "description": "La Cumbre serves the best carne asada in town, period.  I've been going here for more than 25 years. I had moved to L.A. for 12 years, and during that whole time couldn't find a place there to compare to La Cumbre. It's the meat. It's high quality, seasoned just right, and cooked pretty much right before they make your burrito. That's right, it's not supposed to sit in that warmer for hours at a time. Although the prices have gone up, it's still worth it. I recently went to La Taqueria, which is good also, but their prices are way up there now too. Plus, La Taqueria always had this fly problem. It looks like they finally got some no-pest strips or something.  For the folks who think El Farolito is the bomb (quite possibly the worst Mexican food you could find)-----please. You've got to try La Cumbre. This is what carne asada is supposed to be. They put something in their fresh chopped salsa (the hot version) that gives it a really unique taste. A certain pepper, I don't know, but it's great!!", "author": "Michael F."}

I haven't been in this place for about 10 years so I figure I will give it a try. Walking down 16th eating my burrito the first thing I noticed was that the meat was tough as nails and that the burrito was luke warm. I ate about half of it and threw it in the trash. One of my teeth started to hurt because there was a big chunk of gristle stuck there. About 5 minutes later my stomach started to hurt and eventually I had trouble walking my stomach ache was so bad. I went in to Walgreen's and bought some floss and some Pepto Bismo. Back out on the side walk I took a double dose of Pepto Bismol but it didn't help and I accidently spilled half the bottle all over the sidewalk and on my pants and shoes. Pink liquid everywhere. I stumbled into the McDonalds, went into the bathroom and tried to puke but only watery pink liquid came out. I ordered a Sprite and sat in the McDonalds until I started to feel a little better but once I got up and started moving around my stomach pain came back. I could barely walk so instead of taking the bus back to Bernal I hailed a cab. I am at home now. My stomach feels a little better but not much. I am still having trouble trying to puke up the burrito so I have decided to try and pass it through my system. I still have a piece of gristle stuck between my teeth that I can't get out with the floss. I will take some Ibuprofen and hope the stomach pain and tooth ache go away.", "author": "Robb M."}
