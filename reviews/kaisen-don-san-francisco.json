I was meeting up with friends and we decided to eat here on a whim. We got here right when it opened. They informed us that they didn't have any blue Fin tuna at all today so they would be replacing the bowls with tuna with other fish. The menu is quite extensive in terms of the bowls they have and they have a rotating menu of appetizers and specials! \n\nI opted for the truffle salmon don and it had 6 pieces of seared salmon topped with truffle sauce. It also came with cucumbers , tamago and some seaweed on the side. The rice was nicely seasoned and when you wrapped the rice, seaweed and salmon together it was delicious! We also tried the salmon ochazuke and it was ok. The salmon was a bit salty but it was still decent. Probably wouldn't be something I order again but I would come back for all the other bowls.\n\nThis place is def not on the cheap side, but if you like good quality fish this place is a good option. Can't wait to come back to try the other dons.\n\nTotal for 3: $95", "author": "Stella J."}

I really wanted to try it b/c it was all over Instagram for a while, but when I went I don't really think it has anything over other sushi places. \n\nIt's a super small space on Ocean Ave, maybe enough capacity for 15-20 people. I went on a Monday so there was no wait, but I can definitely see it being difficult to get a table on a weekend. \n\nThere's quite a few different styles of bowls, ranging from around $15-$30 depending on what you get. I get that raw fish isn't exactly cheap, but the prices still seem a bit steep. \n\nIt didn't help that the waiter seemed like he was always trying to upsell us on random stuff: we (party of 5) went on a Monday to get the $1 oyster special. Originally we wanted to order 10, so two per person, but the waiter said we could only order 6 or 12 even though it doesn't say anywhere on their menu that you can only order in increments like that. We also each ordered an unagi taco and he tried to convince us to order more of different types so we could try them all. No thank you... \n\nOn the plus side though, the bowls are absolutely beautiful!", "author": "Melissa H."}

The concept of this place is not bad since they are mainly serving the fresh fish/bowls or hot bowls such as unagi don, salmon ochazuke don, gyu don and etc. If you like chirashi- I recommend coming here! For price wise, I do think this is an average price for chirashi bowls but I wish they would give the option to substitute some fish.", "author": "Sammi L."}

There are 10 Don bowls yet only one vegan option- Very Green Don- Seaweed, tofu, cucumber, & sweet tofu all over sushi rice. This is what I ordered since I am a longtime vegan of 19 years (will get my pension in veganism soon). \n\nKaisen Don is a Rice Bowl which some different Sashimi are placed on Sushi Rice. Normally, it's served at Sushi restaurants & is popular for lunch. \n\nChirashi, also called chirashizushi (\u3061\u3089\u3057\u5bff\u53f8) is an interesting Japanese meal. The word \"chirashi\" means \"scattered,\" so this is basically a big bowl of rice mixed with fish, vegetables, & additional ingredients of your choice. Glad they had at least one vegan option. It reminded me of unwrapped sushi in a bowl.\n\nThe Very Green Chirashi Don bowl also had pickled ginger & wasabi like is typically accompanied w/ sushi. I found it quite alright yet would love them to have at least one other vegan option such as avocado perhaps or even a more innovative vegan option.\n\nThe Very Green Don also came w/ a complimentary miso soup w/ wakame sea vegetables. I had this w/ a side of edamame-seasoned soy beans. \n\nAlthough was an interesting experience that I am glad I had would be more likely to return if they had some more interesting vegan options as aforementioned.", "author": "Shane S."}

Not sure I liked the chopped up toro with the rice by itself, but wrapped in the seaweed was like a negi toro handroll which was great (LOVE negi toro). They gave us about 3-4 pieces of seaweed which wasn't enough so we had to keep asking for more seaweed and that was an additional cost. We also ordered a side order of scallop sashimi which was also fresh. Overall, a very yummy meal but not completely filling.

I'm one of the biggest offenders but I'm glad I waited on Kaisen Don.\n\nKaisen Don soft opened about 3 months ago in the former Rainbow T Dessert space. It's a small restaurant with seating for about 20 people so it's not a place to come rolling in with your entire posse of 10. It's ideal for solo diners and couples. No reservations.   \n\nKaisen Don's specialty is chirashi with about 10 variations. For those squeamish about raw fish, they have dons with cooked proteins: chicken teriyaki, unagi, chashu, and beef curry. Each order comes with a complimentary bowl of miso soup. Currently, they don't have a liquor license. \n\nIf you see a particular item on their Yelp page that you want, call before visiting. I saw a pic of the shaved ankimo but they didn't have it and the girl at the table in back of me wanted negitoro but they didn't have that either. \n\nNote to the owner, there's a small discrepancy on your Yelp page. It says, to mention Yelp to get 20% off but the grand opening check-in offer is 10% off. \n\nLast week, I had some time to kill because of street cleaning in my area so I figured it was the perfect time to visit Kaisen Don.\n\nI ordered the Omakase Don ($28.95): http://bit.ly/2H8jKfF. The fish and seafood toppings will vary daily and based on seasonality. \n\nOn the day, I visited my Omakase don was topped with Mirugai (geoduck), Hamachi (yellowtail), Ikura (salmon roe), Uni (sea urchin), Hotate (scallop), Sake (salmon torched), Amaebi (raw shrimp, no head), Kani w/ its brain (crab leg w/ torched brain), and Tamago (sweet egg omelet). For the value driven folks, the cuts of fish (~12 slices) are thicker than usual for a chirashi. Small sheets of nori are provided so you can make mini hand rolls. \n\n(+) Good variety with some premium offerings like mirugai and uni. Remember I said, I was glad I waited on visiting Kaisen Don? During their soft opening, the toppings for the omakase don were run-of-the-mill fish like maguro, hamachi, and sake. Didn't see premium offerings. \n\n(+) Everything was super fresh with my favorite being the perfectly sweet and briny Santa Barbara uni. So good. \n\n(-) Knife skills could be improved. Several slices didn't have clean edges (i.e. amaebi). \n\n(-) While the sushi rice was a good temperature and texture, it was underseasoned and plain. \n\n(-) The wasabi was awful quality (dry, crumbly texture). Yes, it has their cute embossed fish logo but I hope the owner looks into using higher quality wasabi to match their fish.  \n\nService was polite and friendly. I was their first customer of the day and it took about 20 minutes for my order. \n\nMinimalist dining area with wooden tables and metal chairs. I enjoyed the 80s and 90s music they were playing. \n\nLooking at their pictures and their reviews for the past couple of months, it does seem Kaisen Don has some consistency issues and/or still trying to figure things out but I wouldn't be opposed to returning. Their raw fish is good quality and that's what's most important to me.\n\nWhen I'm having a raw craving and don't want to spend $$$ on a nice sushi dinner or deal with the madness at Amami, Kaisen Don will do just fine.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Either way, I still finished my bowl (big mistake), but I had a pretty intense stomachache after I left. Luckily, it didn't last the whole night. Maybe I just got unlucky with a few bad pieces of scallop, since, judging from reviews this doesn't happen often. \n\nOn the other hand, my boyfriend ordered the Rainbow Don, which I also tried a bit of. His bowl was great, the fish tasted fresh and we both really liked how they give you strips of seaweed on the side to make your own sushi roll. Every bowl also comes with complimentary miso soup. They also have hot bowls with chasiu or unagi, etc. \n\nI would say that the chirashi bowls are on the pricer side, around $20-30 per bowl, with the hot bowls a little cheaper. I might be willing to go back to try their other options, but definitely won't be getting any of the scallops!", "author": "Cecille W."}

I opted for the Kaisen Don #2 ($18.95) but I wish I had gotten the Scallop Lover ($16.95) instead.

Came here for a later lunch on a Saturday (1pm-ish).\n\nVenue / Service: on the smaller side, the biggest table probably seats 4 people and fits probably no more than 20 people.  B/c the kitchen is small, food does take a bit on the longer side, but not long enough that you start to get impatient.\n\nFood: in general, the donburis are well portioned, in fact larger than I've seen at most places.  Enough protein vs. rice and bowl sizes are good enough to fill the stomach of a hungry guy.\n-- Santa Barbara Uni / Half Tray (~$30) - came here mainly for this since we love uni.  A half tray is around 5 pieces, which are placed on slices of cucumber and served with wasabi and pieces of nori.  We basically placed pieces of uni in the nori with a bit of wasabi, which I think was the best way to enjoy the taste cleanly.  Uni was pretty fresh and sweet (being from Santa Barbara); definitely worth the trip for!\n\n-- Gyu Don (thin beef, onion, tamago)($12.95) - to supplement the uni, I ordered one of these.  The tamago was tasty, even if it looked more like cheese.  The beef was nice and tender and they give you a decent amount vs. rice.  Wish there were more veggies / onions, but the taste was pretty good.\n\nMy date had the Unagi Don (BBQ eel, seaweed, pickle)($15.95), which was also quite tasty.  A bit too much of the sauce on it, but the eel was nicely cooked and was a pretty big piece.\n\nAll in all, we weren't disappointed after driving out of SF just to try their uni and the donburis.

I wanna say it's the first of its kind in the Bay Area since I haven't seen anything similar around the area. But it's pretty much different selections of chirashi (fish over rice), exactly like how they serve it in tsukiji. For this reason alone, it gets a higher rating from me...\n\nAs far as my experience here is concerned, I think there's definitely some improvements to be had, but they're still in the soft opening stages so guess I'll give them some slack... the main issue that I saw on my visit was the lack of efficiency/staff (tables were not being cleaned, which meant longer wait time). Other than that, service was very good.\n\nFood wise... the taste and freshness was there. I ordered the ikura/uni don and the ikura tasted exceptional! It was very well marinated with a balance of sweetness and saltiness, probably one of the best I've tasted (even compared to Japan). The uni was also very fresh with no fishy-ness whatsoever. BUT....... even though it tasted good, there was a slight issue with it. The amount of ikura WAS NOT the same as advertised... and for $30, I'd expect the rice to be fully covered.

Like another yelper mentioned, the rice has too much vinegar and the rice to fish ratio was poor. I know quality fresh seafood is pricey, and I expected that, but overall I can't say that the meal was memorable. I've definitely had more enjoyable chirashi dons at other places for better pricing and quality. \n\nUnfortunately, there was a very strong fish odor when you walk into the restaurant. I know, i know, it's a fresh sushi/sashimi restaurant, of course, it will smell like fish. However, the smell was overwhelming and a bit offputting. \n\nI believe the best thing we had that night was the scallop truffle burger. It tasted great..but I can't justify the price in the future. \n\nWould I come back? Probably if i felt like splurging. Would I recommend it to a friend? I'm not sure.

TL;DR Despite the positive//negative reviews, try this place for yourself because you won't regret it!\n\nIt's a small restaurant with seating for only ~20 people so the wait may be longer than usual. I went in around 8:30 on a Friday and waited till 8:55 before getting a table for 2.\n\nWe ordered an Omakase Don ($26.95) and a Gyu Don (13.95). The Omakase Don had various types of fish, but it was your basics (tuna, salmon, hamachi, etc.). The Gyu Don is pretty much a beef sukiyaki bowl. The fish is fresh and sukiyaki is well made, not too salty and not too sweet. However, there is a problem with both of these bowls - too much rice! There was so much rice in the Omakase Don that half of the bowl was still full. There was a lot of filler on the Omakase Don - I truly hope they decide to add more fish on it, then the $26.95 would justify it.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience here, the employees are friendly and pretty hardworking. I think that only two people work here and it can get overwhelming for them. If you're the manager, help them out and hire one more person!", "author": "Nicholas H."}

Enough that I wouldn't return and enough that I won't be recommending Kaisen Don. Rice is extremely important in Japanese cuisine, especially for rice bowls.

Their method for cooking rice and for seasoning rice aren't on par with other Japanese restaurants that fall into the same price point. \n\nI've been to Japan and other Japanese restaurants located in the nation, and I don't touch rice unless it's good.

YES.\nThis means that the most bang for your buck is to order the most expensive one. And that's what I did. I got the Omakase Don $28.95 which included Tako, Hamachi, Salmon, Ikura, Tuna, Ebi, AND Uni. The Uni wasn't specified in the menu or picture, but I got it anyways. Merry Christmas to me! \n\nThe restaurant is small and limited to small parties. The menu is simple as it comes with different kinds of dons (donburis). Although not stated in the menu, it comes with a bowl of mushroom miso soup which was a delightful start to the meal. \n\nThe bowl takes quite a while to make as I'm sure they prepare it fresh. \n \nMy thoughts, if you've been to Grubbies, I find this place awfully resembling of it. The cute fish logo reminds me of their fish soy packets and the bowls were kinda similar in style. \n\nThe fish tasted fresh, but immediately entering place  you can smell the fishiness. The pieces of fish are of good size but some pieces were oddly sliced. The fish was good, but something was missing as the texture was non-existent. Salmon was bland, toro was lean, and ebi was skimpy looking. Uni was fine ... but lacked sweetness. Lastly, the rice was too unportional sticky. Fortunately the good thing was the tamago, ikura, and tako. \n\n+Tamago was sweet and firm\n+Ikura was like tiny dragon balls that popped nicely in your mouth\n+Tako was tender\n++Seaweed pieces were great as it provided extra flavor and texture\n\nI've had better for cheaper. The fact it is located near SF State, I'm sure it'll attract the millenials, me being one of them. 20% discount is a good deal and that's probably the only reason I'll be coming back along with Super Cue right there.\n\n****For another review of this place: My brother Derek L.", "author": "Fiona L."}

Four stars for their creativity and simplicity in opening a place that only serves donburis. Don't expect anything more but don't expect anything less either.\n\nA \"don\" is short for Donburi which is basically meat and rice in Japanese food language. They offer around 15 different dons - ranging from the Omakase don to cooked items like Teriyaki Chicken don. \n\nFor three girls, we ordered:\nOmakase don - features a range of different sashimi at two to three pieces each: uni, hamachi, tamago, salmon, toro, tuna. \nRainbow don: another mix of sashimi, very similar to the omakase don\nScallop Lover don: scallop sashimi with Ikura \nUnagi don: unagi with sauce over rice\n\nWe came in on a Saturday night, 630pm for three, about a 20 min wait. Their fish overall is fresh, better end of Japanese restaurants. They give you enough fish a lot of rice and ikura. We ended up taking the seaweed pieces they gave us to make Ikura nigiris. \n\nThey are still in their soft opening phase. Very apparent with their furnishing and this place is small. Imagine a newly painted apartment living room with open kitchen split in half for you to only dine in the living room portion. Would not recommend a party of more than four. Not cozy at all, pretty bare but comfortable enough for dinner. \n\nOverall, I would return because I do want to try their Uni special which is only available Tues-Thurs. Otherwise, it would be a go to place for take out donburis! I would not wait more than thirty mins for this place. Just get the take out instead if you have a rainy day.", "author": "Miffy Y."}

The flavor of the sushi rice was good, not overpowering, and the texture was nice and sticky. The amount of rice was typical for a Chirashi bowl.

The service was friendly and it wasn't difficult to get a seat at 6pm (nor was it hard for anyone who walked in after us to up until 7pm). One thing I loved was the amount of fish that you get on top of the chirashi bowl - Kaisen Don is by far one of the more generous places. As for improvements: the rice (as others have mentioned) and quality of wasabi are in need of help. I'm kind of picky about my rice, but I think it could have used more seasoning or \"sushi rice flavor\". The menu pictures also don't exactly match what you get... For example in the omakase don, no uni is pictured, but you do get uni in your bowl. A simple difference like that could entirely change my decision if I want a bowl or not!

Fair, maybe it does get busy. 10min later, he serves the table next to me that \"Nigiri Omasake\" that I had asked about that is \"only served at lunch\". Funny I thought, so I looked at him and gestured and had a confused look on my face and he said \"Oh they are for Instagram\". Wow. I have a foodie account on Instagram too and was planning to post about it but I came here to have dinner with my family too. But because I am not for Instagram, I can't order it?

A small, authentic, clean restaurant with a very polite host greeting you with a smile. I saw the reviews on Yelp and I thought, I knew, I really hoped it would be the best sushi I had in a long time. \n\nI ordered the Uni, Ikura Don. I was pleased by the freshness and presentation but disappointed with the quantity. Paying $29 for 4 Uni which 3 pieces were very small did not compare to the pictures on the menu or the Yelp reviews. The Ikura was plentiful and lots of rice but for a premium price I expectedly least 6 pieces of Uni and large pieces like the photos. \n\nThe Miso soup was barely warm. Very disappointed in the soup. The hot tea was good. \n\nI want to return to try other dishes but there are so many places I feel are better deals and better prices I likely won't return. \n\nOnly a 3 star rating because of price and quantity did not meet my expectations. \n\nService was good and the place is clean. But the 6 table restaurant only seats 16 people. \n\nI've seen hole in the wall restaurants grow into huge successes by exceeding all areas of importance. Quality, price, and quantity. Service is 4th on my list but everyone is different. Not talking about bad service just service is last to quality of food, price for value, and quantity so you feel good about a deal. \n\nI don't feel like I got a good deal this time.", "author": "G S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-12-29", "description": "This is more of a 1.5 star review. Anyone with a 3+ star review has either:\n-never had a decent chirashi bowl\n-has a diet consisting of Old Town chirashi (see above)\n-was high while eating\n\nWhy?\n\nI know its 20% off, but is it also 20% off the portions as well? I ordered the Kaisen Don #1, but at full price, I would not. Its about $19 for the bowl. At that price, I'm expecting an extra slice of salmon or 2 and one more sweet shrimp. Also leave the lemon out, it just doesn't go with the bowl.\n\nAs for the taste, its alright, but not worth $19-alright. The rice was plain, where's the seasoning/rice vinegar? Hello? I mean it's just rice but the rice vinegar makes a big difference especially when paired with raw fish. \n\nAlso, get rid of the lemon, the lemon rubs onto the fish and partially masks the freshness the taste/freshness of the fish. Unless you're using shitty fish, get rid of the shitty lemon. Once you use rice vinegar, the lemon will be too overbearing anyways. Or put it to the side if you insist putting lemon in the bowl.\n\nAnother, the thickness of the cut of the fish. The salmon were basically in blocks in my don (there's much photographic proof that this is so on this yelp page). Just look at the photos, they're goddamn 2-match-box-combined sized chunks.\nThe reason why a lot of chirashi places have thinner slices is so people can easily wrap their fish around their rice and dip it in sauce. But instead, you have a block of salmon which you eat separately from the rice. \n\nThe radish. \nThe goddamn pile of #radish.\nSure it makes it instagrammable or whatever, but nobody eats that much radish with chirashi. If you insist on leaving that much radish then at least place it over a leaf/seaweed/lettuce so people can pull out all the radish in one fell swoop instead of picking at it to remove it.\n\nJust from these small but important details you can tell these guys were just like \"Oh hey let's just open a Chirashi place because it's easy to make the food and it's popular\" without much regard on how Chirashi is supposed to be made.\n\nOne more thing to pick at: \"bringing Tsukiji's food CULTURE\". So is the fish from Tsukiji or are you guys only talking about the food culture in which they have fresh fish everyday? Because this place is literally just fish over rice and not how chirashi actually is.\n\nI think this place can be a lot better. I think SF needs more chirashi places like this one BUT BETTER. I hope my review has given you some insight what to expect (as a potential customer) and what can be improved (as the owner). I'm hoping when I give this place a 2nd chance in a month or so, it'll become a place I can bring my friends without feeling embarrassed.", "author": "Chris C."}

I came here to check out the place since it seemed really promising (and also 20% off during their soft opening is such a good deal). \n\nI was warned in prior yelp reviews about the fish to rice portion, but I didn't think too much of it. When does anyone not complain about how much rice you get? It did seem like a lot of rice, but I didn't think it was excessive. \n\nSince it was a weeknight, they had their uni trays and we got the 1/2 tray. It was delicious and creamy. I was pretty happy with the portion as well. At first, it looked like five pieces on five cucumbers with a sprinkle of ikura, but it was about three pieces on top of each other. I also got the omakase don and it was well worth it. It had salmon, tako, tamago, ikura, uni, scallops, hamachi. Everything was really fresh tasting and I was pretty content with the dish. I was pretty stuffed at the end of it. \n\nTheir menu prices changed to be a bit lower. We received three menus with the pricing and then one menu with the changed pricing. I'm sure they are still adjusting in the early stages. The omakase was $28.95 originally but was lowered to $24.95. I thought the prices were pretty reasonable for what you get. \n\nI'd come back whenever I need a chirashi fix.", "author": "Jeannie L."}

If you're a hamachi lover like me, I would totally recommend the rainbow don! The hamachi melted in my mouth and was super fresh. The salmon didn't really have that glistening effect that I usually see on fatty salmon but the quality of it was pretty ok. I think the lemon helped make it more tasteful. Ehh I would probably skip the seaweed they give on a little tray. It was pretty stale and hard to bite into. I tried to bite a small piece of it, but it got stuck on my teeth LOL. The rice was pretty good too! Idk if they only put rice vinegar to it but it was pretty tasty with the fish. My friend's order didn't have enough fish for hers :/ I think she only had like 6 pieces compared to mine? I forgot her order! Either way, I think people should check this place out before the 20% off soft opening coupon expires because this place is pretty expensive!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-08", "description": "Pluses are:\n* Super fresh fish - plus the ikura was glistening and popped in your mouth! Also, slices are good sized (1/4\" thick). \n* Wide selection of bowls - if you aren't into fresh fish, you should go somewhere else, this is Kaisen Don meaning \"sashimi fish on rice\"! If they were a true Kaisen Don as their name suggests, then this would be true. However they do offer beef, salmon or beef curry on rice among other things.\n* Friendly owner\n* Continued 20% off discount after soft opening\n\nCons:\n* Weird/small table layout - I realize they are still working things out, but after 1 month they need to get this squared. Waiting families had no where to sit, but stand against the wall?!? When we were there, the layout was a definite fire hazard and non-handicapped compliant.\n* Unusually long wait time - we had to wait about 25 minutes after ordering to get our bowls. Fish put on rice. That is essentially what the bowls are. Felt awkward when people waiting for a table are almost right in your face.\n* Cost - borderline high. The 20% discount helped, but I think that people should take photos with some reference in it like a phone or something. *I shouldn't talk as I didn't do it either.* In the photos the bowls \"seem\" big and packed with goodies. Again, the fish is super fresh. But we actually left a little hungry.\n\nLastly, I hope that this restaurant tries to understand the minute differences that true Japanese restaurants reflect. A huge plus they already have is the quality of fish. However, omakase means to \"let the chef decide\". It does not mean \"put a little of each thing on the menu\". \"Omakase\" is meant for the best of the best that day, so what it includes will also change day to day. As a Japanese customer, it saddened me.", "author": "Mark M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-16", "description": "The first thing I want to get out of the way is that if you were expecting a replica of Tsukiji Market or a more authentic Japanese chirashi don you're going to be missing one big thing: the rice. \n\nNormally I wouldn't point out something that seems to inconsequential but since it's a location that leans marketing heavily on being inspired by Tsukiji, I was expecting it to feature the more heavily vinegared rice from Japan.  \n\nWithout it, even though the ingredients were buttery and soft, you get the distinct impression that it feels there's too much rice. Let me be clear though: I don't actually think there is too much rice! Especially if you get a bowl with ikura, there's enough to go around. But WITHOUT a more flavored rice this is the impression you get, you can see this in other reviews as well.\n\nSome places mitigate this with sauces, like a poke bowl or similarly inspired chirashi dons. I get the impression they included the seaweed paper / nori to mitigate it here without adding sauces. Kaisen does try to be authentic in the bowl, you get just the fish / sea food, but without the strongly vinegar laden rice you get in Japan to compliment it, it's going to fall short of expectations. Those who've been to Japan will know it's the rice being bland, those who've never been to Japan misattribute the problem to being too much rice when there's the right amount, it's just unflavored.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's not bad and it's in my neighborhood and I always appreciate more options. The 20% off during soft opening till the 17th makes it a good deal, plus the customer service is very friendly and attentive. The decor is trendy and clean. This review is probably a 3.5 star, but I want small businesses to succeed so I round up instead of down.\n\nThey were told me I could request more vinegar next time i order so I'll try that and keep praying that some place is bold enough to offer the good rice.", "author": "Susan L."}

We got there and were seated within 5 minutes. There was only 1 server working the whole floor, but she was friendly. They're known for their chirashi bowl so we ordered three: two Rainbow Don and one Salmon Scallop Don. The bowls were a good size and served with a side of seaweed for you to DIY. The rice was not bad, and the perfect amount to place with each piece of fish on seaweed. Fish and seaweed was pretty decent too. We also decided to try their specials of the day: Scallop Burger and Kaisen Spoon. The spoon was good, however I couldn't taste the uni on the spoon, mostly oyster - but still tasted okay. The miso soup that came with the chirashi bowls were like any miso soup served in town and probably not homemade. The scallop burger was extremely tiny and was one piece of scallop cut in half to fit the uni and truffles. The truffle flavor overpowered the scallop and uni so I didn't realize the scallop was so sweet until I had it in my chirashi bowl. Not the best I've had, but decent.", "author": "Amanda C."}

The guy who took our takeout order was nice and gave us ample time to pick what we wanted.\n\nI don't 100% remember what she ordered but I believe it was the Kaisen Don #1 and I ordered the Rainbow Don. The fish was very fresh but unfortunately, the portions don't match the price. My girlfriend gets full pretty easily but she ended up still being slightly hungry. Personally, I think I might have needed two to fill me up. It's about 3 pieces of each fish in the don. I know in order for them to have premium fish quality, they have to charge higher than other places but the prices are still too high. For this specific order, I still ended up spending around $30, even with the 20% discount they offered. I don't think I could fathom the thought of coming here without that discount. It honestly had me craving some Poki Time at Westlake just because the fish portion at Kaisen Don just wasn't enough.\n\nI'm hoping that Kaisen Don can turn it around though.

No signs of sushi-su or sweetness and it ended up completely bland, reminding me of plain white porridge, which is really unfortunate because this place seems promising.\n\nThe fish, while not the best, was portioned very reasonably for the price.

Waiter would bring out one dish at a time and then go to other tables to bring out their dishes (those customers came after us).  By the time the last person in our party got her dish, everyone had been sitting around for 10 to 15 minutes to start eating to be polite.  And everyone ordered the same thing but one person who ordered the curry.  According to that person, the curry tasted like it came right out of a box with barely any beef in the dish.\n\nThe staff was very nice though.  I think for what is offered and for the area, the menu prices are high for such a simple establishment.", "author": "Bea Q."}

The scallops and uni were sweet and served at the perfect temperature. Portions are huge. The salmon ochazuke needed a little bit of soy sauce but it was the perfect comfort food for rainy SF weather. I will be back (and bringing friends!) to try their sashimi.", "author": "Alice C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-30", "description": "Small place, but my good friend recommended me.  I love Japanese food, sushi, sashimi, ramen, udon.. all my favorites.  I even have an Japanese cuisine expert showing me the good stuff in SF and elsewhere in the world.  I don't claim to be \"the expert\", but I certainly do enjoy food.  When I go to Japanese restaurants, I do scan the menu for chirashi bowls.  I love sushi rice and sashimi.  You can pair the right of rice with your fish, and I pick my favorite flavor of fish.  When I heard that there's a new place that specializes Chirashi, I was super excited.  \n\nAt a glance, the place is small, looks modern, somewhat resembles bubble tea/fast food restaurant.  Dinning room seats small amount of guests, this is probably due to SF regulations.  Things looks very clean and sterile.  When I walked it, around 5:40pm, it wasn't so busy, but I realized there was a line outside the door about 15 minutes after i sat down.  \n\nI was brought a menu with very nice pictures.  Not too much choices as a regular Japanese restaurant, but enough choices.  There are the scallop lover, Hamachi love, blue blue fin tuna, and even uni or toro.  The prices to me compare to many Japanese restaurants' Chirashi bowls are rather reasonable.  Usually, the Chirashi in a regular Japanese place is about 25 bucks above.  You can get the same less than 20 plus a 20% yelp discount - that is a deal.\n\nI brought my family there, my wife and two kids.  We ordered a box of uni for appetizer.  My wife ordered the Rainbow bowl, and I ordered the hamachi bowl.  I ordered the thin slice beef bowl for my kids to share.  The bowls came up rather quickly, but not all at once.  They were well presented.  The chef did really take a lot of time making sure the bowls presentable.  The fish are very fresh and high quality.  I enjoyed every bite of my Kaisen Don.  \n\nWhile I was there, I was able to located the owner, Larry.  While the places wasn't too busy, he told me about where he learned how to make chirashi bowls.  He basically like me who love chirashi.  He also recommended me to mix and match your chirashi bowls, and don't have to pick from the menu.\n\nI did read Chris' review, and I appreciate him pointing out how Larry's chirashi isn't the perfect chirashi for him.  Perhaps Larry can learn something from his review.  For me, I am pretty satisfy with mine, or Larry's representation.  I feel that if everyone's chirashi is exactly the same, there won't be any innovation in food.  We will eat the same thing for hundreds of years, but perhaps someone like Chris will enjoy that, and there is nothing wrong with that.  Larry is certainly someone who will probably take advice from his toughest critics.  If not, how else would you make your customers happy.  5 stars for my experience.  Thank you Larry.", "author": "Dennis L."}

The fish and scallops were really fresh! No fishy taste or random chewy bits. The hot tea kept flowing throughout the meal. No complaints. \n\nFor non raw fish eaters, they have a selection of cooked dons which looked equally as impressive.", "author": "Michelle T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-02", "description": "The fish was ok and fresh which is good. I think everything is overpriced for the quality of the fish.\n\nThe worst was the sushi rice. It was just plain rice which is a big disappointment. It felt like I was just having a big bowl of white rice with some fish on top. The rice was missing the vinegar, sugar and salt. The basic ingredients that you will have in sushi rice. \n\nI ordered the rainbow don and added an amai ebi to my don. My amai ebi was really small and what made it worst is that my friend got the exact same thing as me, rainbow don with amai ebi but her amai ebi was a regular size. I was upset that I got a really small ebi but my friend got a regular size and she was sitting right next to me. We are paying for the same price, so how come my ebi was so small. They should just give us the same size or add another small amai ebi on my bowl to make it seem like all the portions of the rice bowls are the same. But they charged us $10 for two amai ebi. \n\nThe place is really small and they had one server working. It wasn't really busy the day we went and the server was nice and he refilled our teas from time to time. \n\nOverall, I just feel like everything is overpriced even with the 20% off for soft opening.", "author": "Katie Y."}

The quality of the seafood is rather average. The uni and scallops were rather bland for being usually one of the more flavorful sashimi you can get and the unagi was not any better than than a frozen eel you can get at a Japanese supermarket. Actually, the two poke places nearby this particular restaurant has better unagi than this place. They also give you miso soup with the donburi, which is nice, but it is also of average quality. The presentation of the food is very good, though, and would look quite nice if someone was doing it for the 'Gram. Overall, this place is OK.", "author": "Angela L."}

The fish was fresh and the meal came with free tea and miso soup--nothing too special but nice on a chilly day.  The menu is pretty limited, with only sushi rice available as a base.

The atmosphere is minimalist, not charming or comfortable. I would like more ambiance going out to eat at that price point (~$20/bowl). We tried 4 different bowls. Mine was scallop and uni from the specials board. The scallops were good, but it's a very small portion for $20.95. The uni was just two small pieces. It had ikura, which was not mentioned as part of the bowl. Unfortunately, I don't like ikura. We asked for the 20%, and at first they said that was over. We told them we saw it on Yelp and they asked us to show it to them. The Yelp mobile phone version doesn't mention the 20% discount, but the Yelp desktop version did that day (and still does 4 days later as I write this review). The servers were nice enough and eventually they said the manager would extend the 20% discount to us. Overall, we it was a very underwhelming experience and we will not return.", "author": "Jane M."}
