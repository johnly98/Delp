I would totally recommend you try it. \n\nPros\n1. Their food is good and at a reasonable price(The fried chicken and the seafood clay pot are the best in my opinion)\n2. The staff is very nice and professional\n3. The walls are painted nicely\n\n\nCons\n1. Parking is hard to come so be prepared to spend ten minutes finding parking\n2. If you do a takeout during their busy hours, be prepared to wait a very long time\n3. Especially during their busy hours, it is not wise to bring big items like baby strollers to the restaurant because it is packed \n4. If you don't like feeling cold, don't sit near the doors during the evening so you won't get blown with cold air every time the door is opened.", "author": "Deb K."}

I can't say since we came here on a semi holiday?\n\nIt wasn't the dim sum in the cart so we have to pencil our food choices in and they come to grab the menu. The service was very slow since there was just one person working. \n\nIt took about 10mins for the first portion of the dim sum to come out but some of the dim sum wasn't like...hot. It was warm but didn't taste like it was fresh from the steamer. That made me a lil sad since hot food is good food. Warm food means meh. Like left over D:\n\nOverall, this place was just ok.

Mood: sometimes they say your mood can alter how food tastes; vice versa.  I was in a relieved happy mode when I came here.  Ambiance: typical rowdy Chinese restaurant with plenty of seatings.  Narrow entrance, but the setup keeps the wind/cold air out (double doors) with a turn.  Ok to bring the elders even if you are seated by the entrance; not drafty like most other chinese restaurants.\nThere were a lot of take-out orders consistently.  We had 4 people, although we only made 2  shell orders they split it for us into 4 so it's easier to share (very thoughtful gesture).  This is without us saying anything or requesting!  \nOwner guy is loud but not rude, he's just a tough guy lol.  I can imagine some people can misunderstanding this.\nAll the dishes I've ordered shown in the pictures were yummy and satisfying.  Forgot to take the picture of the complimentary soup, but that is good too.

We made reservations ahead of time and already placed an order for the one of the family dinner.\n\nIt was very packed when we got in. Service was very slow. It took me awhile to find parking in the area but I eventually found parking. When we arrived, it definitely took us awhile to get someone's attention, we already had a table reserved. Our table was right in the front entrance, they had the table ready but not truly ready. It didn't have enough chairs so we just stood here for awhile, just waiting around. It took the wait staff about 10-15 minutes to bring in chairs and realized we were missing stuff.\n\nIn terms of food, goodness gracious, how long does it take to bring out out our food? It took a really long time to bring out our first dish, I thought maybe after the first dish, more dishes would come out quicker but nope! It took FOREVER for food to come out.\n\nWe had some lettuce wrap dish, and it wasn't bad. The seafood soup wasn't too bad. Honestly, none of the dishes really stood out to me. I thought the lobster vermicilli was made well though. The garlicky lobster bits on the vermicilli was delicious. I really enjoyed that dish, so probably one of my favorite. We had the pea sprouts with egg and centurion egg, that wasn't bad enough but it could've been better. At least the seafood was decent, the steamed fish wasn't bad. Sometimes, seafood can be bad at Chinese restaurants depending on the quality of it. The white egg scallop fried rice was good as well, but I feel like most places do a good job with that dish. It's pretty standard. So we had fried shrimp balls, and I guess a serving has 10 of them but we had more people so unfortunately, not all of us had the chance to dig in. I wish we knew that ahead of time so we could either plan ahead or order more. Their shrimp balls come with mayo instead of the sweet and sour sauce I am used to.\n\nOverall, food was mediocre, service is slow. Restaurant feels dirty. I waited forever in line to go use the restroom, I had to go too so I was annoyed. Would I come back? Probably not, I wouldn't recommend it. If my family wanted to go there, what can I do? I guess I'll come along but it wouldn't be on my list of places to eat at in San Francisco. There's better Chinese food nearby with decent service.", "author": "Margaret L."}

I added white pepper and, true to form, hot crushed pepper sauce which gave it a spicy kick.\n\nOur next two dishes came out at the same time:\n\n*Silken Tofu in orange sauce with minced pork, sliced jalepenos, and green onions. This was the stand-out dish for me, as I've been trying to get on the tofu train recently.

My friend's favorite from childhood. I thought it was good, but again, tofu make me dance.\n\n*Lasty, we had Chinese Spinach with Roasted Garlic.

We decided to park on Noriega and go from there and just decided on New Hing Lung for some yum cha.  It was still crowded enough especially for Sunset on a weekday after 1.  The tables downstairs are grouped really close together, just an FYI.\n\nBecause it was a weekday, there weren't any carts going around and you had to order from the little paper menu.  We ordered some staples: ha gaw, siu mai, cha siu bao, sesame balls, chicken feet, fried meat dumpling and the taro cake patty thingy.  \n\nI've had better quality at other dim sum restaurants (traditional sit down and to go).  The best were the fried items (sesame balls and fried meat dumpling).  The shrimp in the ha gaw wasn't as fresh and plump or well made as other places.  The siu mai looked a little different too, and same with the quality as well.  The cha siu bao was fine.  He didn't comment on the chicken feet (I don't eat them).  The taro patty wasn't as greasy as most places, but was a little more on the bland side.  \n\nLike everyone said though, this place is cheap!  The bill was about $20 with tip I believe.  If you're going all fried or just for a steamed pork bun then this place may be okay for you for dim sum.  But chances are, you're gonna end up getting some shrimp dumplings or pork and shrimp dumplings, so I'd advise you to find other dim sum places as an option.

If you decide on coming here to eat Clay Pot Rice my advice is let the restaurant staff know its because so that they can prepare it for you ahead of time!!! This is a great place to spend time with family and friends while eating Clay Pot Rice!!! And not only that ever since we have been coming here to eat Clay Pot Rice the restaurant staff has been really friendly with us!!!", "author": "William B."}

I came strictly for hot and sour soup since I was slightly hungover. I was surprised how cheap the food was and it tasted pretty good too. My friends ordered a lot of dim sum dishes including pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, chicken dumplings, steamed bums, egg tarts, and others. \n\nEverything was pretty enjoyable and we were having a good, cheap, happy meal until we found a freaking COCKROACH in one of our dumplings. The COCKROACH was flat and steamed to perfection... Yummy! \n\nNeedless to say, we all wanted to throw up and obviously lost our appetite. We showed the waiter the steamed cockroach and he didn't even apologize. He just took it away from us saying that he won't charge us for that dish. He brought us egg tarts too... I was like wtf??? Yo you think we still tryna eat after we had a COCKROACH served to us?? Come on man take all the food away and freaking comp'ed our meal. But, they ended up charging us....\n\nIf my parents dined with us, they would've brought this place down for sure. Lucky them I was too lazy/tired to argue but they should've comp'ed our meal.

The owners and staff here are incredibly nice, and I love that there is plenty of seating either upstairs or downstairs for such a tightly packed neighborhood. \n\nThe food itself is average. Below is a sample of some of the dishes my family typically orders:\n\nSalted fish fried rice - The rice can be a little mushy, but they are very generous with the amount of salted fish in the rice.\n\nWalnut shrimp - Shrimp is a little mushy but the flavor is on-point. The honey glazed walnuts are always amazing but it's harder to screw those up.\n\nEnoki and fried tofu - Cannot remember what this is called on the menu, but this is such a great hot pot option. It tastes fresh, even if the flavor is heavy.\n\nOh and their mini egg tarts are super cute! I will definitely continue coming back here, but mostly because of proximity.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

I got suckered in here again but last minute for a retirement party!  I didn't want to be rude and flake on my aunt, but I knew I wasn't going to eat much here.  The original plan was Superior Palace in the Richmond which is decent in food quality and an has acceptable health score but the choice to come back here was made because people were concerned about having to drive through the park with a big festival going on.  Sorry, but the trouble to get anywhere else is worth it.  If not, staying home or eating at McDonalds is even a better option.  I stand by my previous review and will simply add to the craptastic experience one gets here.\n\nI'll start by saying the food was every bit unimpressive as my previous visit over a year ago.  The honey walnut prawns and spicy green beans were the only winners here- soft and supple with simple flavors.  Every meat dish was dry and dull in flavor.  Some of the quail still had feathers on them and arrived strewn about in a pile all over the plate.  Clearly there's no love in making the food here. The wood ear in the vegetable moo shu wraps was questionable.  The texture should be soft with a crunch.  These were a bit chewier in texture and tasted old.  Blech.  The fried kabocha squash was a dry, flavorless heaping fried mess- plenty of fried outer shell on the bottom of the plate.  What presentation?\n\nEmpty water glasses signify more water please, and an empty tea pot with lid ajar equally means the same.  However, you'll have to damn near throw yourself in the path of a waiter to get the water.  Did I mention we had to wait for them to wash glasses before even having glasses for water??  Hey husband/wife team, ever heard of IKEA?\n\nThe restaurant itself resembles sardines in a box.  If you're one of those special unlucky souls (because coming here means you're already unlucky) sitting near the fish tanks, prepared to get wet from the condensation on the exterior of the tank.  As if that isn't enough, it's likely you'll get splashed too when they are removing the fish.  If you sit on the corner the bussers are likely to fly by and  hurl a few droplets of unfinished tea or water from the dirty glasses.\n\nThere's nothing else to add.  The health score and other reviews should say enough.  This place is absolutely disgusting and no one gives a damn about you or what you're ingesting here.", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

The things I ordered are your typical Chinese dim sum dishes: Siu Mai, Spareribs with black bean sauce, and ha gow. I also ordered Stuffed Crab Claws with minced shrimp that never came. \n\nYou're probably thinking, \"maybe you didn't like it cause you've just finished experiencing legit dim sum in China.\" Maybe you're right, but I didn't enjoy much of the dim sum there either, maybe cause I stayed a small city (Kai Ping) and all the health inspections were either a moderate face or sad face (they rate by faces, not numbers). \n\nThe siu mai that I ordered tasted off, as if it was undercooked. The spareribs with black bean sauce were okay but tasted undercooked as well. Maybe I've never noticed this before, but the inside was still pink. At first I thought it was the restaurants fault for it still being partially raw, but after talking about my experience at this restaurant to my bf, he said it's always pink inside..so I'm unsure about that.

So I thought it's about time I wrote a review. Not every dinner has been perfect, but it's pretty good most of the time.\n\nFinding parking in this area is easy during the day, but VERY difficult during the evening, then late night it gets relatively easy after most customers have finished their dinner.\n\nI have never tried the dim sum or the lunch menu at this restaurant, so I don't know if it's good or bad. If you were to come here for dinner during a holiday you'll find a packed restaurant (reservations recommended on those days). So the actual popularity really doesn't reflect the overall low Yelp rating, my guess is that most regular customers don't bother to write reviews on Yelp.\n\nI'm not the one who orders the food, so I cannot provide much detail in that aspect. I know that we normally choose from one of the preset Chinese banquet menus, so it's under $200 per table, for 7 or 9 courses (not sure exactly).\n\nSimilar to other places, the meal starts with a cold appetizer dish (sliced beef shoulder, pickled veggies, jellyfish, headcheese), then a soup, and the other dishes. The last banquet dish is stir-fry noodles, followed by tapioca or sweet red bean soup for dessert. My favorite dishes are the steamed fish, and the garlic chicken. It's similar to the crispy skin chicken that comes with shrimp chips, but this version has toasted garlic pieces instead. I think that u can find that in the regular menu also.\n\nThis restaurant used to be connected to the Hing Lung restaurant in Chinatown.

I would say less than five minutes right after you place the order.  Unbelievably so as the last few times I was there, I keep thinking maybe this food is supposed to be for another table.  How can it get here so fast?  But it was definitely for out table.  Nothing wrong with food coming fast for dinner.  Being fast is a plus.  Perhaps the few times I've been, it wasn't as crowded so there's more cooks preparing our dishes.  \n\nThe food is okay.  Your average everyday dinner food that no better than any other restaurants. nor any worse.  Doesn't fall behind nor does the food stand out from the rest of the Chinese restaurants serving the same dishes.  \n\nPrices are average.  Some prices you would pay at any other Chinese restaurants.  \n\nI haven't seen any cockroaches or mice mice myself.  if I did, I would NEVER go back.  Especially if I did see a rat or mice. \n\nSo why 3 stars instead of 5?  The restrooms.  The cramped tiny hallway leading to the restrooms.  Sticky and dirty.  There are two separate restrooms for men and woman.  But the workers ignore all of that.  They go into which ever restroom they want.  Male employees coming out of womens restrooms is more common.  The restrooms inside are are clean.  Far from it.  If you're not careful, you'll slip from the water or whatever all that liquid is on the floor.  The toilet seats are usually sprayed with urine.  It would be better if some employee would go in there maybe every hour to clean the place.  I can't even image anyone sitting directly on the toilet seat.  Perhaps that why females learn the art of crouching while using the toilet instead of seating.  In any case, the restrooms are very dirty, stickly and nasty.  Prevent from going if you can.\n\nFinally, never ask for food recommendations.  The menu is big, try to choose your own dishes.  The past few times we ask whats the special or what the waiter would recommend, they would give recommend something that's off the charts weird.  Dishes that we've never seen in any restaurants before and often, does not taste any good.  Perhaps it's what they have extars of in the kitchen and when asked what's the special, we get recommended oddball stuff.  Why do we ask for recommendations, you ask?  Because when you're in a party of ten and you want to order around 8-10 dishes, the pressure is on because everybody wants something different.  Easier to cop out and ask for recommendations.  But DON'T.  Pick your own food and enjoy it.\n\nI'm giving this a 3 star as it's a restaurant that i can continue to go to, but it's not a restaurant that I would go to all the time not is it the first restaurant that'll come to mine when I have a Chinese food craving.", "author": "Jack L."}

For only $5.50, you get an entire steamed clam with garlic and vermicelli. They split it into two half clams too so you actually get two halves, making it a great dish to split.  The vermicelli soaks up the juices and sauces from the clam and - what?!? is that a scallop too?!?-  that lay inside the shell.

Within the golden city, the nicest atmosphere will not necessarily be found in the stage-set sized Chinatown proper, but in the Outer Sunset, which is especially populated by Chinese and Irish immigrants.\n\nThat means that on a foggy Sunday morning, you can duck in here to the warmth of a two story house of dumplings, veggies, sweets, meats, and cold-curing Jasmine tea. \n\nCouples and smaller groups huddle at little square tables close to the door, which is often flung open from all the foot traffic and as an invitation to more business. The space in the back of the first floor and the lofted second floor are maxed out with gigantic round tables with concentric Lazy Susans on each. Around these tables are four generation families of primarily - or entirely - Chinese and Chinese American breakfasters.\n\nThere might be a bit of the wait, but the agony of watching dishes of glazed sauteed eggplant chunks is savory indeed. Like other dim sum places, you write your order on sheets of gridded paper. Hing Lung even has a bilingual menu with pithy descriptions to guide your choices. \n\nSince this isn't a place where servers come around with ready made servings of dumplings and other treats, the wait for your made-to-order food is a bit awful (though in reality, the wait is probably not more than ten minutes long). \n\nA bit of people watching and good conversation later, the food starts arriving in an avalanche of all the familiar flavors, bathed in hot oil. The XO sauce is in large glass jars with a spoon - just the way it ought to be. \n\nTwo new surprise favorites were the sweet sesame buns with sweet bean paste inside and the turnip pancakes, which tasted like pork belly because they were clearly braised in pure animal lard.\n\nHealthy types might complain that the food is too greasy or heavy, but then it's like go to a friggen salad bar.\n\nNext time in town, I'll have a go-to dim sum joint, and that is just as satiating as New Hing Lung's food.", "author": "Jia J."}

I think there were about 20 pieces. So everyone had at least one piece. Shrimp was great size and sauce was good. It was pretty normal Prawn Walnut dish.\n*Deep Fried Crispy Quails [4 of 5] - The little birds were a really good size and fried nicely. I don't have complaints. Except, for myself! I, honestly, can't really figure out if this is quail or squab. They are bigger than normal quails, but smaller than normal squab size. Therefore, I am guessing they are quails. I wish I took a picture of the original menu. I had to pull this menu from online menu, but I know they are not accurate. Sorry fellow Yelp readers! \n*Deep Fried Crispy Chicken [4 of 5] - Chicken was crispy and there was a lot of meat. And it came with chips. No complaints.\n*Lobsters W/ Ginger & Scallions [3 of 5] - The dish came with two lobsters. They were probably 1.2 pound lobsters. So it was good they gave us two. \n*Black Mushrooms W/ Mustard Greens [4 of 5] - A lot of greens and perfectly cooked. This vegetarian dish was pretty good.\n*Steamed Black Bass [3 of 5] - Nothing special. The fish was kind of small, but it was fresh.\n*Braised E-Fu Noodles [4 of 5]-This was my favorite dish out of the entire meal. The noodle was soft, moist, and chewy.

But that is not why they received the harsh, 1 star rating.\n\nThe reason why only received one star is because it took forever and a day for us to get our food. We weren't in a terrible rush but we wanted to eat and jet. The waitresses and dim sum staff brought the dim sum plates and baskets out one at a time and I am not exaggerating. The schedule:\n\n11:00 - Entered the restaurant, the first waiter tried to seat us with another table already full of people but coincidentally had 3 chairs left. The boyfriend's mother, with glaring and shocked eyes, gave a no. \n\n11:05 - Got seated upstairs. \n\n11:10 - We put in order of 7 things: radish cake, spareribs with black bean, chicken feet, siu mai, ha gow, scallop & shrimp dumplings, beef   flour rolls (not sure how to say that one).\n\n11:20 - Radish cake served. \n\n11:23 - Radish cake finished. Plate taken away.\n\n11:30 - Spareribs with black bean sauce served.\n\n11:40 - Beef flour rolls served.\n\n.......\n\n12:25 - Received last dish...\n\nIf you notice the time difference between each one being served one at a time, you will calculate that it took us about an hour and a half to get all of our dishes--our seven DIM SUM dishes. Dishes of which should be getting to our table in total within 5 to 10 minutes. \n\nThat wasn't the only thing. The service was far from courteous and they surely did not try to be polite or even nice. No smiles, no you're welcomes, not even one glance or moment of eye contact. It was just plain Cantonese-style, eat-and-go, service and manners. \n\nThe food itself was also subpar. The cheun fun (beef flour rolls in Cantonese--I may have botched it up since I am Mandarin) were flavorless even with the sauce. The beef just tasted like mush rolled in chewy flour. The spare ribs were ok. The chicken feet were too fatty, and not marinated long enough. The sui mai was hard and funny-tasting. The \"scallop\" and shrimp dumplings had no scallop. The ha gow was okay but didn't have enough of anything else besides shrimp to give it the balanced flavor it usually has. The radish cake wasn't bad.\n\nSo altogether, the experience was below subpar and would definitely  not be coming here again for dim sum.

The dim sum was nowhere close to some of the best I have had and I noted from the menu that they did not have much to choose from either. At least they had the usual fare such as the siu mai, shrimp crepes, etc. that suits the taste of ABCs very well. This dim sum place has two floors and is kind of on the narrow side so that is probably why they cannot have carts. This makes me sad since I love the whole scanning for my favorite carts and hawking them over to see close up of what they have. Since they make us write our orders on paper, we have to wait while they prepare our food individually. Usually at Chinese restaurants, ABCs kind of get spotty service because the Chinese servers know we do not know our shit very well, which is true, I cannot really read the Chinese menu. However, the servers were not discriminatory of us and were actually pretty helpful in helping us order. Well, there was one part when they kind of made fun of one of my friend when he was having trouble ordering a fried noodle dish, but he kind of deserved it.", "author": "Jenny W."}

The food arrived promptly (thankfully not all at once) and beer flowed freely.\nIt's different than a lot of dim sum in that you fill out a checklist of what you want, and then as it's ready, they bring it over.  So it's nice and targeted with getting what you want without having to look at things & try to remember if you like it.\nWe sat upstairs so it was quieter, although the tables are fairly close together.\nThe bathroom was clean & smelled neutral.\nTheir chicken feet in black bean sauce were amazingly good...they fell off the bone & had that nummy gelatinous taste.  Shu mai had a lot of filling to wrapper ratio.  And the bao had a nice sweet taste and was fluffy almost.  Not the best way to describe it, I know, but I've had some gut bombs.\nEveryone who served us was very polite & helpful.  There was a line out the door when we left around noon.  I was told if you get there too soon, some things aren't ready and if you get there too late, it doesn't taste as fresh.  Our stuff was perfect.  Fried food was straight out of the frier, not greasy, and just so tasty.\nLove to come back here again.", "author": "Lara F."}

We ordered dim sum from the check off list they placed on the table before us. We had about 7 plates of dim sum ordered. \n\nThe restaurant screwed up our order and dumped two additional plates of siu mai on us. We didn't mind until bill time came around. The manager took it and as we watched him fix a table for the next party, he added an extra 3 checks to our bill and raised the price by $10. We took about 30 minutes making a big stink about it. Usually people don't haggle with the manager because he's the guy in charge, but we like to put up a fight when we didn't order 3 extra dishes that never came. \n\nWhen we won our case, he cursed a few times, so we didn't leave them a tip. \n\nThis place HAD a reputation for yum cha dim sum. Its really over rated now, and here's why.\n\n1. Food is affordable y priced, but the quality of food does not taste right. \n2. Service is slow. The waiters ignore you if you're seated upstairs or do not speak a lick of Mandarin.\n3. Tea has an oxidized taste to it and isn't hot. Change the leaves or tea bags everyday!  \n4.

Narrow dining area, we sat upstairs where there's an additional 7 or 8 tables.  There appears to be only one way to the upper dining area, which makes me a little nervous as it looks like a death trap should there be a fire, with only one exit down the narrow staircase. This place is always packed at dinner.\n\nIt's typical helter-skelter like you find at a true Chinese restaurant, lots of noise and what seems to be no organization to seat customers at tables squeezed so close together, it makes you wonder if the Fire Marshall has made a recent visit to validate and enforce the maximum occupancy code.  \n\nThis is no Ruth Chris' Steakhouse, don't expect to get exceptional service from the waiters here, or at any true Chinese restaurant.  They tend to think their only job is to bring the food you ordered to your table, never asking how your meal is and doing their best to ignore you the rest of the time.  The expectation is if you need something, you have to get their attention and ask for it.      \n\nAnyway, the service was two stars, food 3.5.  Black bean lobster, crispy fried chicken, squab, roast duck, honey walnut prawns, peking spare ribs and shark fin soup all tasted pretty good and came out hot from the kitchen.

The rice noodle on the cheung fun was super thick and the soy sauce looked like it was diluted with water; the dish was tasteless. The kitchen took a long time with our order of the sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves and shanghai dumplings.

Anything that we recognized as a dumpling, we ordered, but we stayed away from some of the things with weird names.

Not sure why there's all this bashing on the food - I have a VERY sensitive tongue for MSG (like seriously, I can't even eat Doritos or a lot of other chips because I can feel the MSG dancing in my mouth) and while I can't prove it, I don't think they use MSG in this restaurant.  I normally enjoy the bittermelon with scrambled egg (sounds nasty but seriously... try it! I rarely eat bittermelon any other way), the braised tofu and veggies, the sauteed spicy eggplant (ask them to hold the meat) and their dessert soups.  It's not gourmet Chinese by any means, but it's good homecooking.  I do wish there were more veggie options, but most of the non-veg stirfries can be made veg. \n\nAMBIENCE:  Typical good homecooking-kind of Chinese restaurant atmosphere - dirty sticky carpet (the 3 second rule does not, I repeat DOES NOT, apply here), questionable bathroom, chairs and dishware in dire need of repair or replacement.  It's always way too crowded and loud.  Servers are not purposely rude but understaffed and always running from here to there, so you'll have to really wave them down if you want something.  However, unlike many other Chinese restaurants, the owner here is actually quite sympathetic to vegetarians and if you tell him that you don't want any sort of meat or meat broth in your dish... he'll make it so.  That's way more for service than I expected from a Chinese restaurant of this caliber!\n\nPRICES:  With the cheap ambience comes cheap pricing.  It's pretty easy to fill up a family of five here (and my brother eats like a whale AND a horse) for under $40.  A pretty good value if you don't mind the loud, crowded setting.\n\nPARKING: While still somewhat difficult, is probably easier than most places in San Francisco.

Anyways, we were hungry and on the recommendation of a friend we went to New Hing Lung Restaurant for some dim sum. We all knew going in that the food won't be outstanding but decent enough to be satisfactory once you factor in the cost of things.\n\nService: Seated right away and the service overall was excellent. Whatever we asked for we got - yellow mustard, glasses of water, they even had red vinegar, switched our tea from Jasmine to Boni etc. Staff were quick to respond and friendly.\n\nFood: The food overall was okay and satisfying and part of it I think is we knew what to expect. We had chicken's feet, spare ribs with black bean sauce, beef with chow fun, sticky rice in lotus leaf, chicken in foil, shrimp dumplings, shrimp and chive dumplings, sui mai, shrimp crepe, turnip cake, crab claw, stuffed green peppers with fish, steamed BBQ pork bun, and wide spicy noodle. There might have been more but can't recall.\n\nThough the food was okay it could have been a bit more flavorful, the dumpling skins could have been thinner, and the shrimp fresher.

It used to be okay dim sum, not bad, but good enough to fix a dim sum craving.\n\nI haven't been here in a while because now my family  (and friends) goes elsewhere, but I came here today hoping for decent dim sum at a cheap price.\n\nI totally should have went somewhere else. The hostess first seats us at a huge table for 6 when it was just for two until I saw a smaller table and sat down there instead. It was a nice sunny day outside today and when we went inside, the restaurant was FREEZING, I kept sneezing over and over until they closed the door. That was nice, but they ended up opening the door again...nice gesture revoked!\n\nThe food came quickly, but it was terrible. TERRIBLE. My boyfriend and I always order the beef noodle roll. I don't know what type of meat crap that was in the rice noodle roll, but IT DID NOT TASTE LIKE BEEF. It tasted like pork, but it was very sour. I'm surprised I didn't get food poisoning. We also ordered the beef balls and they were sour tasting as well. I do not know what happened to this plate. These dim sum plates used to be fine. They must leave their meat out to spoil or something. It's as if they ran out of beef and decided to use pork that was sitting out or that was picked up from the garbage. Ugh, so gross. There were three plates of some kind of beef dim sum left over and the host asked us if we wanted to wrap them up to go, UHHHH NO THANKS.\n\nEverything else was not tasty and I've definitely lost my appetite for dim sum for a while. \n\nOne good thing about this place is the dishes are relatively clean. Come on, everyone knows that Chinese restaurants don't actually wash their dishes and only rinse, leaving residue on them. The other good thing is that it was really cheap. The bill was about $20. Of course.... how can they charge more for spoiled crap?! After this experience, I never want to come here again. I'm sure we can all spend a little extra money and get some REAL dim sum somewhere else! You're better off going to a dim sum stand type of place in Sunset or Chinatown.", "author": "Jamie W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-04-19", "description": "I went here over the weekend for a family dinner. This place is just gross for several reasons, but the thing that sticks out the most is that everything was sticky. The plate was sticky/oily. So was the lazy susan. So was the pepper shaker. So was the thing that held all the rest of the condiments. If that's the status of things outside, what about the kitchen? it's probably a KITCHEN NIGHTMARE.\n\nI advise you to clean your plate/utensils with your hot tea.\n\nAnyway as for the food, we got a set dinner meal and here are the reviews for the $138 meal set:\n\n1. crispy skin chicken - it was okay, but those shrimp chips that came with it were stale. I have never had shrimp chips this stale and soggy, ever. \n2. honey walnut shrimp - slighly below average. quality of the shrimps was bad. the walnuts were good though.\n3. quails - not too good. gamey taste,  hard to believe they can mess up something so standard.\n4. buckwheat noodle (aka yee mein... sorry I am too lazy to type chinese here) with straw mushrooms and chives: very oily with no taste. what's up with that? if you're going to grease my artery, I need some flavor at least.\n5. ginger/green onion lobster. It was okay, but the color of the shell had a lot of black... so it didn't look very high quality or fresh.\n6. Mushrooms/\"gai choi\" - This was disgusting. The mushrooms were low quality and chewy. They obviously didn't even soak them properly. Well, at least the gai choi were not bitter, I guess. Also there was too much gravy.\n7. cold plate - standard I guess. The five spice beef was too hard/chewy. The jellyfish/pickles were okay. The bbq pork (char siu) was fatty.\n8. soup - I think it was shredded chicken with dried scallop. Somehow I choked on some kind of bone. I don't even know what it was.... :( The taste was ok, but very thick and full of cornstarch.\n9. steamed fish - this was not too bad. not overcooked. It didn't have the 'sweet' taste of really fresh fish though.\n\nWe also ordered the beanstalks (dou miu) with garlic... and while the quality of the beanstalks was ok, the whole thing was doused with too much oil. Gross.\n\nThe restaurant also changed the plates sometime during the meal. Remember how I said the plates were greasy? Well the new plates they gave us were also greasy. My cousin actually had a mini melt down about what to do with her chicken and the new greasy plate. She put her chicken on the plate without cleaning it first and couldn't decide what to do. Eat the chicken? Just leave it there? Move it and clean the plate with tea? I'm not joking.\n\nAnother bad thing was that all the food came out within a span of 10 minutes and they kept stacking the dishes on top of each other. I should noet that this normally this grosses me out anyway (I am a germophobe). But with the sticky greasy plates, I was pretty disgusted. The bottoms of several plates were touching the food! YUCK!\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and avoid this place. The taste isn't even worth the questionable sanitation.", "author": "michelle l."}

The haslet with turnip was good too, and it was a gigantic serving....another great deal for $5.75.  Unfortunately, they messed up our order and the scallops came with shrimp rather than conch.  My friend is allergic to shrimp and we told them that it was supposed to be conch, but they said that they were out of conch.  They did remake the dish with only scallops.  Wow, there were a lot of scallops in this dish.  I think they gave twice as much scallops at other places that i have ordered this.  My friend thought the scallops tasted too fishy, but I thought it was fine.  Finally, the snow pea sprouts were very good.  I've also been here once for dim sum, but I don't remember it being very memorable.", "author": "Tyler C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-09-26", "description": "This is a staple for me especially fro Dim Sum, dinner I have not been to ages. I do order a lot of take out, their main issue is that they are not that consistent when it comes to their food. For instance their walnut shrimp sometimes can be made just right, the shrimp and walnut crunch and delectable, other times soft, doughy and not what it should be. Even their dim sum is not always consistent either, the best time to go is on the weekends. While the dim sum is not always consistent, it is still well done and cheap. Some dishes of dim sum some tiems take a lot of time to come out. Also I would not recommend going into the bathroom unless you really need to, trust me.  \n\nOne of the best and cheapest places for dim sum that i have found around. Their cheapest plate is 1.70 and you get a decent amount of food. I once paid 36 dollars for four people including take out and we were all barely able to walk out of the place we were so full. Their dim sum, you normally order off of a sheet  where they list the item and the number of the item. That usually goes out the window when it gets very busy and they then just start brining out random dishes and you choose. It is around the 11- 12 o'clock hour that they begin to do this. Also prepare for a wait if you come at that time and also during holidays as well as the Asian holidays of lunar new year, etc. \n\n I recommend the fried tofu wrapped with seaweed then deep fried and topped with shallots, even my vegetarian friend enjoyed it. The other dish they make really well is their chicken shui mai, it has a very good flavor. Also go with the canton egg rolls versus the other fried food because that s not overly fried and has a unique taste. Keep in mind the food will be very hot so be careful stuffing the whole damn thing in your mouth. \n\nOn a side note, I think one of the waiters looks like suspended supervisor ed jew, he has the receding hairline and and everything. \n\nSo go for the dim sum and go during the weekends for it because that is when they shot, and other times it can be a crap shoot and some times you do get luck with good food.", "author": "Christopher C."}

Only slanted street parking is available at this location and there didn't seem to be any open spots. As I walked into the restaurant, I waited about a minute before a waiter eagerly and politely led us toward our table on the 2nd floor. We received this nice treatment because my distant relative is a regular here. Once I stepped into the 2nd floor, I noticed the tables are really close to each other. It would be difficult to walk by and would cause a lot of traffic. As we sat down, my distant relative began to order dim sum by checking the piece of paper. I was unfamiliar with this way of ordering but it has it's advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I would rather see a menu and order myself. I looked around my surroundings as I sat near the window. The window and ceiling/pipe area did not look clean at all. I cringed looking at it. \nI chatted with my relatives since I've never met them, but even though we had a lot to say, the first dim sum took a great length of time before it showed up on our table. I couldn't believe the slow service. Then, it took another while before the second dim sum showed up. Even as we received our regular dishes, the dim sum kept coming out afterwards. Why does it take so long? It makes me long for the days where people pushed around dim sum carts. At least you can get the food instantly. Or even a conveyor belt in a Japanese restaurant is better than this service here at New Hing Lung.\nHonestly, as a New Yorker, I am used to the New York way of dim sum. I did not feel the dim sum here at this restaurant is any better than the ones I'm used to eating back at New York. The shrimp (how do you say it?) Ha Chern was okay. I'm appalled here in San Fransisco, the turnip cakes were served without oyster sauce. Oyster sauce is awesome! Well, this is not my kind of lifestyle. The Singapore Mai Fun we ordered was okay too. All in all we ordered hundreds of dollars in dim sum and I didn't find anything amazing to eat. \nI notice the waiters aren't that polite either. One guy asked one of my older distant relatives to move in more so he can go wipe the tables on the other side. I was thinking, it's not our fault you made the tables so close to each other to inconvenience everybody for a quick buck. I hate restaurants that skimp on quality or service. The side two person table next to us could not even get out of their table because our table was blocking them. It's real cramped and I don't appreciate that. On my way out though, the waiters were really nice, keep thanking us for coming. \nOverall, I'm not too impressed with this Chinese restaurant. \n\nPROS: the food was good, service was nice at the beginning and the end \nCONS: food took a long time to get to the table, space is cramped with tables where even waiters can't get by", "author": "Karen Y."}

The fresh fish (steamed), pigeons, lobster, duck and other dishes were all pretty decent, but nothing that stood out from the other restaurants. Their coconut pudding dessert could've been sweeter, but maybe its because I had it after eating the birthday cake. \n\nThe place is not dirty as far as I witnessed. The restroom was very acceptable for a Chinese restaurant as well. There are two levels, so plenty seats. \n\nI was debating between the service however, because one of the two guys who worked upstairs seemed to have talked to much and was a bit rough with his tone and choice of words. I didn't sense any type of politeness or formality. However, he was a bit witty and somewhat funny. He also took his time to make sure we had a great picture when we asked, so I guess that evened it out for him. There was another older gentlemen who provided EXCELLENT service and was very attentive. He changed our plates multiple times, even if we passed up the offer. Everytime he saw us reach up to get something, he would rush over and ask what it was we needed. He was also super flexible when it came to our dessert because we all seemed to want different things. He brought us ALL THREE types they had! He looked and presented himself in a very friendly and polite manner. He was also working hard too! One of the best I've seen! When I first entered the restaurant, I went up to a lady who worked downstairs and requested that the cake be placed in the fridge. She was more than glad to help and double-checked with me to make sure it wasn't an ice cream cake (otherwise it'd go into the freezer). \n\nOverall, the food was just like any other random Chinese restaurant that I wouldn't voluntarily go back to.

It's Chinese New Year's eve today, so we reserved a table about two weeks ago knowing that everywhere will be super packed. When we called, we wanted a table at 7, they didnt have anything at 7, they told us we can do 5:30, i mean, who the hell eat dinner at 5:30 anyway??!! but whatever, we made the reservation regardless...\n\nWe showed up ON TIME and people were waiting outside already, we were so relieved that we made an reservation, BUT.... we were standing there for like 5-10 minutes, NOBODY greet us... the lady was so damn busy talking on the phone and wont even acknowledge our presence right in FRONT of her.... I think she's the owner.... We waited and waited until she got off the phone, then my mom told her we had a reservation and she went, \"O you guys need to wait, told you to come early\".... she kind of raised her voice too... so my mom was like, then there's no table for us? NO RESPONSE and no eye contact. Then there goes the freaking phone again.... When she got off, I finally went over to ask her if there's any table for our RESERVATION, she told me we have to wait, then i asked for how long, she was like, i'll tell you later... WTF??? what kind of answer is that??!!! and she didnt even look at me the entire time i was talking to her.... RUDE!!! we were gonna leave anyway, but my dad had to use the bathroom all of a sudden, so we had to wait for him... then this waitress or something went over to the owner lady and murmured something, i didnt paid too much attention, I was standing by the door getting ready to leave... then i heard that waitress said something really loud,  \"already said to come early, they were the ones who decided to take their time\" (something like that, my chinese translation is bad....) Obviously she was saying it to US, but without actually telling us directly.... HHHEEELLLOOO?? do they even understand what's the meaning of a reservation?? It means there will be an empty table for the people who called you two weeks ago and told you that they will be there at the time and date that we agreed upon!!!! i didnt say shit to them because first of all, i dont talk to low-class losers, second of all, it's new year, i dont need to make a scene at a mediocre restaurant over a dirty greasy table. I just gave the waitress a really cold angry glare, like literary staring right at her as she walked pass me. Trust me, I had never ever done that to a stranger. If i ever gave a dirty look to anyone, it's my dog... \n\nNot only they dont have any sense of customer service what-so-ever, they need to learn some basic manners. By the way, the part where it says:\"takes reservation\" on top, we need to change it to NO. Or yes, but you'd need to arrive at least 30 minutes in advance to secure your table.... I wouldn't mind doing that for a truly exceptional restaurant, but New Hing Lung on Noriega?? No way in hell I'll do that. \n\nAnywho, it's over, i had my dinner right across the street at this shanghai restaurant, it's not too bad, and their dessert took me by surprise! It was really good and special... it's like this sweet soup with mini sweet sticky rice balls and eggs. It's sort of like egg flower soup, but the sweet version. Most chinese restaurant just splash you with those nasty red bean soup for dessert. And all of the servers were really nice and cheerful....\n\nAs for this place, Im sure those douchebags are gonna be around, and it seems like they dont mind losing some customers.

(am i the only one who thinks its strange when the staff picks through your food in front of you like as if they are a part of your table?) extremely attentive, but not very professional. i would probably not voluntarily come back here to eat again, i've had MUCH better chinese food elsewhere.", "author": "Vivian D."}
