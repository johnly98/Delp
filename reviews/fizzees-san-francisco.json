She told us that we had to buy drinks first before I got change, which we were going to do... Anyways, it was only $10 for a beer and a shot.

Unfortunately, they have seemed to be struggling in the last few months. There heavy trafficked location seems to be the only reason why they have been able to make ends meet. The lady who owns the bar has overcharged me and my friends on multiple occasions. \n\nApparently, this has been known to happen to several other people. After having a two beers each, we ask for our tab. The total was far beyond what 4 beers could be so we asked. The owner, the Asian lady, repeated that she has owned the place for 20 years and accused us of lying. I then went to the bartender who actually took our order. He remembered that he served us only beer, while the lady continued that we had ordered six shots. The miscommunication could've been easily handled. However, she lost her temper and started yelling for her bouncers. The bartender who served us quit his job right then and there. This seemed to even more frustrate the women and she started accusing us for the recent problem. The small bouncers were very intimidating and I was forced to sign for the expensive tab.\n\nIf you go here, don't give her your card. Just pay with cash upfront and you will avoid the issue. This was a very disturbing experience. I hope that they will consider different management.", "author": "Mac J."}

I had been to fizzies once before on a random Tuesday night and a middle aged pretty Asian woman served me and my friend. She was sassy and excellent at what she did, however, the boss was sitting in the corner continuously questioning her abilities and even yelling at her at some points! The next time I returned she was no longer working and instead a young woman who could barely speak English was working. \n\nThe experience was terrible. First she questioned each one of our ID's, had no idea what was on tap and almost refused to serve one of our friends who has a Brazilian passport due to her lack thereof knowledge. To make it even worse when asked if they could play ANY music she told me I had to pay a dollar to do so. On top of this, the boss was sitting in the corner of the bar as always, however this time she was screaming and complaining. When we asked to finally leave they told us we were $1.50 away from the credit minimum so instead of getting another drink I just paid extra so I could leave faster. Awful.", "author": "Abigail M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-08-14", "description": "**Warning: This review has a lot of people, so they've each been given nicknames to make it easier to understand**\n\n\nI came to Fizzie's with two friends just two nights ago, one from Florida (we'll call him Friend A) and one from Brazil (Friend B), both 27. We probably got there around midnight or so. As we walked into the bar, we were asked to present our IDs by this man (we'll call him Presumed Bouncer) wearing a polo that had the Fizzie's logo on it (Very important detail!!). He checked my ID as well as Friend A's and we were fine. We had a little bit of trouble with Friend B, since the man (who I'm guessing was the bouncer or a manager of some sort) had no knowledge of international IDs. He asked for a second form of ID to confirm Friend B's age, which worked. I assured Presumed Bouncer of his age and he said we could go ahead in but just wanted to be sure since another bar just up Geary had been busted for allowing underaged individuals in.\n\nWe didn't have any trouble until we moved to the opposite side of the bar away from the pool tables and next to the arcade games. The entire time we were there before the move, we were fine. My friends ordered themselves some beers and me just some water. We didn't talk to anyone or arouse any suspicion cause we were simply enjoying each other's company.\n\nAs we all sat on our stools, one of the bartenders, an Asian woman (we'll call her Skeptical Woman A) with short hair checked the 3 of us out for a few seconds and suddenly left. We didn't make anything of it and continued to enjoy ourselves. Sometime after that, another one of the bartenders, another Asian woman (Skeptical Woman B) with shoulder length hair, starts questioning us, particularly Friend B. She asked us who had let us in, and I told her about Presumed Bouncer. She left and came back about 5 minutes later, to inform us that the bar in fact had no bouncer. Skeptical Woman B came back yet again and demanded to see Friend B's ID. He took it out and gave it to her. She took a quick look and left once again. She came back about 3 minutes later and started yelling at us, saying again that the bar had no bouncer and that she didn't know who it was that verified our ID (take the time and ask yourself, how the hell does she not know who her coworkers are???). Skeptical Woman B angrily spoke to Friend B, saying that he was underaged and that he was \"busted and caught.\" Friend A informed her that he was from Brazil and that the IDs were difficult for those who weren't used to them, but once again assured her that he was the proper age. She then held her hand up in Friend A's face and yelled, \"Just hold on, I'm not talking to you, so stop it!\"\n\nSkeptical Woman A left again, this time we didn't know what for. We didn't feel like sticking around to see what she would do next so we ended up just leaving. It was a very disappointing experience, especially for a Friday night on Geary, and even more so when two friends are simply trying to enjoy the city when they're from out of town. \n\nBut what got us even more upset was the fact that she refused to listen to our explanation and refused to acknowledge that we had been verified by one of her coworkers and didn't even check with Presumed Bouncer to see if our story was true and decided to yell at us in front of other customers, which was quite entertaining for them I'm guessing. In situations like this, most establishments will bring the individual you are referring to (in this case, Presumed Bouncer) and see if everything checks out. Nope. Not with Skeptical Woman B.\n\nI honestly believe Skepticals A and B thought we were trying to hide or something because at that time, that part of the bar was fairly empty. Most of the customers were sitting at the bar or just crowded around the pool tables. They probably thought were trying to avoid something (even though they both saw us when we first ordered our drinks).\n\nNeedless to say, I don't think any of us will be returning to Fizzie's (unless they get new bartenders and a proper bouncer). Skeptical Woman B is an extremely rude woman, which I can now verify from other reviewers who have faced her, and hope nobody else has to deal with her, her lack of common sense and her ridiculous sense of authority.", "author": "A.

Maybe this will be a bit biased because my sis did work there and I'd often visit her, but I'll try to keep it honest as possible.  \n\nIf you go around 10 or later parking can be a drag.  Especially, if you're going on a good night weather wise, meaning NO rain.  Upon entering the bar, you immediately feel that this is a real neighborhood bar.  You have your regulars and then the occasional people that stop by like myself.  My experience with all of the staff (AGAIN my sis worked there so take that into consideration with my experience) was good.  They were always friendly and seemed to be very attentive with all the customers.  I've never experienced a time there when a customer had a problem with any of them.  It's a great place to go if you're looking to just chat with friends over some drinks while listening to music and maybe playing some pool.  I love how they give you free snacks with your drinks.  Two kinds of shrimp chips to be exact.  Yum.  \n\nI admit, there is a weird smell to the place at times.  My sis claims it's the pipes.  haha....so if you WERE lucky enough to work while she did she'd always bring body spray with her and immediately start spraying the place as soon as she started work.", "author": "Christine D."}

The place is old, it's been a neighborhood bar for over 20 years, and not much has changed, but that's part of it's charm.\n\n3) Yes, at times it is a total sausage fest in the place, but women should not feel uncomfortable coming in. If anyone gives you grief, either I, or one of the die-hard regulars will take care of the offending party.\n\n4) No, I am not racist or prejudice in any way. I love seeing a diverse crowd at Fizzee's, but I do take my job seriously, which means:\n\na) No ID, no entry, no exceptions, and don't even think about using a fake, I have been trained to spot most fakes. I'm not perfect, but do you really want to risk being embarrassed if I catch you?\n\nb) If you are drunk off your a**, you're not getting in. It is a liability to the last bar that serves you if you hurt yourself or someone else while being intoxicated.\n\nc) I have a zero tolerance policy, if I catch you harassing the bartenders or other customers, you're out, maybe not 86'd, but definitely out for the night.\n\nFizzee's has earned a reputation of being a \"safe\" bar with the local PD, they know that the owner enforces all applicable laws, so they mostly leave us alone. It's my job to make sure it stays that way. However, we try to keep the atmosphere at Fizzee's chill, so as long as everything stays chill, you might not even know I was there.", "author": "Man S."}

The main focal point is the old school hot rod mounted over the bar. Really cool. However, I'd be lying if I told you it didn't make me nervous. The bartenders that night were cute girls.
