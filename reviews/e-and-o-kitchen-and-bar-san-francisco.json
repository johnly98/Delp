I cannot comment on the food options and prices outside of it, but if you are able to make it during this time, it's a a good deal. It makes dining in the heart of Union Square and the city more affordable. Cocktails on their list are $6 with numerous small bites at reasonable prices. And try an order of the corn fritters. This small bite was one of my favorites, and it's vegetarian friendly if you are one. One con of the small bites is it won't fill you up per se.\n\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is it blends in with other restaurants in the area. The Asian twist is great, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food. With that in mind, there are many places with nice decor, solid food, and good service. E&O's happy hour stands out for sure, but nothing stood out that tells me to come back here as many times as possible. Nonetheless, still a solid choice when in the area.", "author": "Brandon S."}

I had a tasty cocktail for $6. I dined alone and ate at the bar, which has a very contemplating and swanky feel to it. The wait staff was polite and fairly attentive. \n\nThe gem of my trip here was the Japanese-Bop. This tasty take on the Korean bibimbap was incredible. The rice was fried to be crispy, but, it wasn't overdone so as to be chewy or burnt - as can be the case in some of the more \"homey\" Korean places I've been to. The pickles were an excellent twist to the standard Korean radishes. I'm not from San Francisco and, that's probably for the best. If I was - I'd go broke eating here.", "author": "Kathryne B."}

Sat at the bar, atmosphere is very pleasant with professional services from staff.  There were few ladies already enjoying their happy hours deal.  \n\nThe happy hours food is better than I anticipated or from the review I read.  The oysters were fresh especially great with a happy hour price $1.  Many happy hour dishes are between $1 - $3.5 each.  We ordered 6 oysters, 2 dumplings, 1 duck meat bun, 2 ahi tuna,  2 skewers, 1 corn fritters (comes in 3) and three drinks. The price came out round $50.  Not bad for happy hours \n\nThe wrappers on the dumplings were soft, but not watery and the dipping sweet soy complimented the dumplings.  The beef skewer did not need to add the satay sauce, the natural taste was great, but each piece was not grilled evenly, one piece was perfect medium while the next was over cooked.  The chicken skewers were perfectly tendered.  Moving to the ahi tuna which was very fresh and not choppy, you can bite into each tuna pieces.  Corn fritters were the star, nicely fried with the right amount of proportional corns and breading.  Yes, must return on different occasions.", "author": "Frances C."}

The first problem that became apparent almost immediately was the bad service.  There was only one or two other parties in the entire restaurant when we were here, and we had to actively try to wave a server down.  After ten minutes, someone came but wasn't a server, so he helped us try to find someone.  After five more minutes, a server finally came after we frantically waved our hands.  Definitely not a great start, and the mediocrity continued throughout the night.\n\nWe ordered the ~$20 fritter burger and the ~$28 cod.  The fritter burger with fries was alright, and it was a huge portion, but I felt that it was still very overpriced for what you get.  The cod was much worse.  Firstly, the cod wasn't deboned.  There were tiny bones everywhere, which is not acceptable for something we paid $28 for.  The fish tasted dry and frozen, and it lacked flavor throughout.  The vegetables the fish came with were decent, but the entire outer ring of vegetables were colder than room temperature.  Only the vegetables underneath the fish were hot.  \n\nTLDR - Unjustifiably overpriced.  Terrible service and poorly/carelessly cooked food.  Don't make the same mistake we did.

Out of all these dishes, I only liked the corn fritter.\n\nThe corn fritter was fried and had a good crisp texture.  I enjoyed the corn pieces in it. The sweet chili sauce that accompanied it, added a nice heat to the fritter.\n\nAs for the other dishes, I didn't find anything really appealing to it.  The Asian Ceaser salad was a Ceaser salad. The naan croutons were the only Asian part.  The pork chop was too charred. I found the taste of the fried rice and the flounder to be bland. The chicken spring roll was OK.\n\nI thought the service was spotty. After our server took our order, we never saw her again until we were ready to pay the bill.

I personally love sampler plates because you can try a bit of everything. The highlight of the platter were the sliders! The ribs were a tad to salty for my taste, but tender! \n+ $1 oysters w/ kimchi sauce: $1 oysters are always worth it.

But for $1/each I rather skip this item next time. \n\nSERVICE: \nVery friendly hostess and waitress. I had to wait on my friend who was running late, but she was very attentive in checking to see if I needed water refills or if I wanted to order anything ahead of time. \n\nAMBIANCE: \nInterior has a classy-dimmed-lights feel, with a hint of traditional feel to it.

Enjoyed the HH oysters at Plouf more.\n\nWood Oven Naan: Again, good not great. I think it would be a lot better if the sauces were better. A creamy hummus and/or tzatziki would be more well-received than the chunky raita and chutney they currently serve it with (in my opinion).\n\nAhi Poppers: My husband LOVED these but they were so tiny. $3 each for literally just one (small) bite.\n\nDuck Buns: I enjoyed but they were super dry. I couldn't taste any of the hoisin sauce that was supposedly on there. These were also super tiny and not worth their price tag of $4 each.\n\nPea Dumplings: So... My husband and I didn't try these, however, previously mentioned single dude at our communal table did. He ordered two of them. When they were delivered to our table, he dove right in and took a bite. Swallowed and didn't take another bite.

On arriving it was very busy so reservations is highly recommended.\n\nMy friend and I decided to stick to the small plates and skip the entree dishes.  We ordered the raw oysters, curry cerviche, butternut squash wontons, beef ribeye sliders and shittake wontons.  The server was prompt and the food came out in a nice sequence which did not overcrowd our small table.  All the dishes were quite good but the butternut squash wontons were outstanding.  All the curried sauces reminded me of Thai yellow curry.  In the menu there were different dishes that were labeled Indonesian but I did not recognize them.\n\nThe atmosphere was very busy and crowded with tourists and local business people.  It was hard to carry a conversation at times as the noise level was significant.  Definitely not a romantic destination.  The tables were somewhat small so ordering more then 2 dishes would be an adventure.  Prices was reasonable for the SF downtown location and I may come back again to try some of the other dishes.", "author": "Harun R."}

After our pupu platter arrived, we were treated to a second round of our drinks due to the wait! Best service anywhere on our SF vacation.", "author": "Kayla R."}

The tables we booked were communal about 6 of us and easy for across table communication. Everything went smoothly! Great environment for a laid back celebration. I love the decor and it wasn't loud but it was still lively. \n\nA team member needed a gluten free menu and that was provided promptly. All the appetizers had a delicious fusion to it. I had the pork chops with kimchi. The kimchi wasn't traditional Korean but the the fusion made sense. The pork chops were perfectly cooked and not too fatty or greasy it was the perfect blend with the balsamic sauce! We stayed about 3 hours since last we were having a blast! \n\nMains were about $25-35 on average. I was very pleased with the selection and service! The night was a success!

Our party of 3 adults chose the Pu Pu Platter which came with a variety of bites (ribs, corn fritters, ahi tartare, sliders, veggies, chicken satay). It normally comes with 2 of each \"bite\" but, since there were 3 of us, our server suggested we add an extra serving of each and it was the perfect amount of food. My favorite was the ahi tartare, but the corn fritters came at a close second. We had a child with us who loved and ate all the ribs. I didn't really care for the chicken satay; it was a little too smokey flavored for me. But everything else was delicious! The drinks were really tasty too. \n\nWe did, however, have to wait a while for just appetizer foods, and it wasn't very busy. Not sure what happened there but the server was really nice. Just a little FYI in case you're expecting to come for a \"quick bite\". Other than that, great place to have happy hour! I'll be back!", "author": "Arielle G."}

Unfortunately we had missed the happy hour deal, but the menu still looked good.\n\nI had looked beforehand about things to eat here, and the sliders looked really good. I had to try those. We ordered one of the short rib sliders, the crispy spring rolls, and the Indonesian fried rice. \n\nThe spring rolls came out first and they came with 4 pieces and a sauce. I'm not exactly sure what the sauce was, but it did have some jalape\u00f1os in it, so if you do not like jalape\u00f1os, just stay away from the sauce. I found the sauce to go really well with the spring rolls. They were crispy just like the description said. They did not disappoint. \n\nNext came the sliders with the taro chips. I love taro chips and they were the perfect munchies to go with the sliders. The short rib in the sliders was really soft and seemed to melt in your mouth. They only have three in the order, so if you are an even number group, just take note of that. I wish they had given an even number of sliders so my boyfriend and I could have had two each, but we still really enjoyed them. He let me have the 3rd one, bless him. \n\nFinally the Indonesian fried rice came out. It wasn't a huge portion, but they did give a good amount of shrimp and char siu, so that makes up for it. Some of the shrimp pieces still had some shell on it, so be careful when you eat them. I know some people say you can eat the shell, but I just personally do not like the crunchiness. The shrimp was so flavorful and just tasted exactly like the rice. You can tell they mixed it all together. It was just delicious. I would definitely recommend this dish. \n\nOverall, our experience was really great. Our server was really nice. However, it was a little weird that the A/C was on above me even though it was cold outside. Other than that, I could definitely see myself coming back, possibly to try the happy hour here.", "author": "Allyson L."}

Amazing. I tried their famous frito burger since it was my first time and it was definitely an experience, but since I know I'll be coming back again, I won't be getting it. It did get a little boring after awhile, and the corn fritos just don't hold up. The fries and patty were delightful though. A friend of mine got their shaken beef which was delicious. We got the calamari beforehand from the appetizer section and boy oh boy was it a good choice. The calamari itself was already tasty but this was the first place I've been to where they used fish sauce instead of the usual marinara sauce as a dip. \n\nAmbiance? Can't be beat. It looks very upscale, modern and Asian-themed (3/3 for me!). I'm sure at night it would look even nicer\n\nService? Hmm... They did lag a little in the beginning and take awhile for them to get our order, but after that they were quite responsive. \n\nI'll definitely be going here again.

We had made a reservation at 7pm but we were able to move it up to 6pm after Happy Hour ended after asking the hostess.  The waiters came frequently enough to check in and fill water glasses.  They did bring food out kinda quickly- it all came out at once and it would have been nice if it came out one at a time.  Thankfully our table was big enough to fit all the dishes.  \n\nFood: HH bites were small and cheap but quite tasty.  Food was decent and usually on the lighter side for dinner (or maybe we coincidentally picked lighter dishes).\n-- HH Oysters ($1 per oyster) - very fresh and briny, though on a smaller side (as expected from a happy hour)\n\n-- HH Dumplings (butternut squash and red curry sauce)($1 each)- butternut squash flavor comes out very nicely and red curry sauce didn't overpower it.  Has a creamy texture in terms of mouthfeel, so definitely different from your typical Asian dumpling\n\n-- Japanese \"Bop\" (crispy dashi rice, sunny side farm egg, spinach, pickles, red chili furikake, bonito flakes, umeboshi plum)($17) - interesting take on crispy rice, with the egg adding richness and the pickles add some acidity.  The rice was a bit too crispy at times, making it super hard to cut through.  \n\n-- Prawn Salad (gulf white prawns, cucumber, asian fruits, cashews, onions, fresh chilies, thai basil, mint, cilantro, lemon oil, maldon salt)($18) - interesting, fruit forward salad.  Definitely a lot of fruit but enough shrimp to satisfy our protein craving.  Luckily it doesn't eat super sweet with the lemon, fresh herbs, cucumber and chilies.  It is a rather large portion- my friend and I had a bit of trouble sharing it just between the two of us.  \n\n-- Wood Roasted Char Siu Black Cod (sauteed water spinach)($27) - highlight of the meal!  The char siu flavoring worked surprisingly well with the black cod- sweet but slightly tangy.  The cod was well cooked and flaky.  Also a big fan of the sauteed spinach since they were not too oily!\n\nDinner came out to around $30 per person excluding drinks.  Little pricey considering we only got 3 dishes to share, but the food was decent enough that I'll let it slide.  Wouldn't be my first choice in terms of where I want to go for modern Asian food, but perhaps would be my second choice.", "author": "Audrey H."}

One of my colleagues has labeled E&O as her favorite restaurant in SF, and while it doesn't rank as high as all that for me, it's a good place for a tapas-style meal. I've had many of the non-seafood items on the menu, with highlights below:\n\n-Wood-Roasted Edamame Beans: I mean, yes, it's edamame...maybe it's the Maldon salt on them, but they're really good.\n-Lamb Naan: The.Bomb. The lamb is marinated well, tender and juicy, and balances well with the naan. Frankly, I was surprised that somewhere as overtly fusiony as E&O did this well, but I ordered a few of these and ate them all myself!\n-Beef Short Rib Sliders: These are OK but not mind-blowing and I think the particular pickled veggies they use totally overpower the dish. It's like, \"Oh, here's some pickled radish and...is that...essence of beef?\"\n-Chicken Lettuce Cups: My favorite thing on the menu. Okhthanksbye.\n-Crispy Chicken Spring Rolls: I like that these are actually heavy on the veggies. Really nice and light every time. \n\nI've found the service here to be super hit or miss. The last two times, flagging someone down required a bit of work, although the staff were pretty friendly when you could find time.

While a variety of dishes were ordered throughout the table, I took the advice of one of my colleagues and ordered the fritter burger. Don't let the steep price ($20) dissuade you, this burger was worth every penny (even though technically I wasn't footing this bill). First, this massive burger is sandwiched with two corn fritters as buns. And if that wasn't delicious enough, it comes with a healthy amount of pickles, bacon, kimchi, and sirracha all topped on a perfectly cooked, thick, medium rare (because let's face it, that's the only acceptable way to eat beef) patty. Oh and of course a bunch of fries which I honestly completely ignored in favor of the real prize. \n\nAmbience is nice, in a business casual sort of way. And service was very friendly and attentive.

E&O is low lit and, on a Thursday evening, appeared mostly full.  Catching up with old friends demanded a drawn out ordering process as we were so unfocused on the menu.

Unfortunately, the dinner portion of our evening was disappointing. \n We arrived on time for our dinner reservations and were quickly whisked to the back of the restaurant. The decor of the restaurant is lovely, clean, and spacious. Once we reached our small table, I realized we were in a separate part of the restaurant. In the back, in front of the cooks. It's an odd space, you definitely feel separated from everyone else. Especially if you're the only two sitting there.\n Since it was a special night for us, I was hoping to sit in the livelier part of the restaurant. It was a Saturday night, our anniversary, and just wanted to be around other patrons enjoying their evening. We asked our server if we could be moved to another table closer to the front. This is where our night began to take a negative turn. She looked at me and said I have no idea what's going on in the front of the restaurant or with the hostess. To be quite honest I was surprised by her answer and her unhelpful manner. I answered, well I don't either do you think you can ask someone? She left and came back with a gentleman who explained that they needed the other tables for larger parties. Ok, I got it.\n She perhaps was having an off day, and I understand that that can happen... my husband asked about the wagyu steak and how many ounces it was. She didn't know and had to ask about details about the wagyu, and then realized that she forgot to ask about how many ounces it was. So she had to go back and ask again. I ordered the steak satay ( which were grisly and hard) very disappointing. The fried rice we ordered was ok, a bit bland. \n All in all usually if you have service that falls short, you hope the food will be better. It wasn't.

Assuming because of the time, it wasn't too crowded and we were able to get seated right away. \n\nOther than the oyster we tried the dumplings and the beef short rib slider. I say you can past on both. The dumplings were so small for $1 and the sliders were pretty dry. Can't complain about $1 oysters; well because, they are $1 oysters. We had ordered 18 to split between the two and both were filling. In terms of drinks, I had tried their special during that time which was the green tea vodka. Surprisingly, very tasty. I would get it again.\n\nThe other issue was the service. For the place being so vacant when we were, the service was unbelievably slow. However, when it came to the regulars, they were served/catered to almost immediately. That didn't sit well with me especially when it took forever just to get some damn Tabasco and the bill. \n\nGood place to go to if you're looking for an early HH spot offering $1 oysters before 4PM.

Not only is it hard splitting it, the fact is it's hardly enough for one hungry tummy. \"E&O\" has dazzle with oodles of style, but they need a little bit more sense. #sincerity", "author": "Sean C."}

Upon arrival we were seated immediately and our server addressed us as soon as we sat at our table. The food was served quickly after ordering, but because it's mainly small plate style servings our table filled up pretty quickly with food and they had to slow down the arrival of the food.

My first visit was many moons ago when they had communal tables upstairs for dinner; my memory was that the cuisine leaned towards Indian and Southeast Asian cuisine.  Then, I was fortunate in being invited to a YEE here a few years back.  In organizing a business lunch where one attendee was on Maiden Lane, I thought about this place and promptly made a reservation for a Monday business lunch.\n\nThe first thing I noticed were the gaudy yet interesting decorations in and around the ground floor dining room. A few years ago, I read that the company hired Arnold Wong (renown for his Eos and Bacar... boy, I miss Bacar) as the corporate chef de cuisine.  Knowing his style,  I looked forward to trying E&O's revamped menu. \n\nArriving early, one guest and I ordered beverages as we waited for our fellow diners.  After studying the menu, when said guests arrived, I ordered a shared dish of mushroom dumplings (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vrOepTGwg0Ek4NeKi2seTQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  I believe there were five to an order so we each got to try one with a bonus one. \n\nWhile discussing the menu, , we agreed the two courses for $23.95 option was the best choice.  With three choices per course,  my selection was the  green papaya salad (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=X9xStogBS00negYbQTAu9g&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) to start; I was surprised by the portion as it was a heaping plate and, if they added a protein, this would be an meal in itself.  For my second course, I chose their pad thai (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hgkb8kGwvoevWudjdEZvow&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q); also a generous portion and nicely seasoned, not overly so like many places.  My friend offered a small chunk of his ribs which were tasty and tender.  Ginger cookies were offered for $5.00 more but we passed on that.\n\nI enjoyed my meal and the location is convenient for those who work or happen to be in the Union Square area.

They both said that the vodka green tea was the strongest, but it was honestly the better of the three.  The vodka green tea was very smooth.  The prickly tequila was good.  The rum vanilla tasted like a soap or carbonated drink.  Drinks weren't too bad though.\n\nWe ordered oysters, which were $1 each and came with a kim chee cocktail sauce.  We all agreed that the oysters tasted fresh and good.  The kim chee sauce complimented them well.\n\nI also ordered one ahi tuna tartare (popper) $3 and one dumpling $1 just to try it out.  The ahi tuna tartare was good and the shell it came in gave it a nice crunch.  It was a nice amount of tuna.  The butternut squash dumpling was nothing special and wasn't that satisfying.  It was also super tiny!  The red curry sauce probably saved it a little.\nMy friend also ordered the Indonesian corn fritter bites $3.50 and she enjoyed them and got full after eating them.  They give you 3 per order.\n\nService was okay.  The waiter was friendly, but I had to repeat myself multiple times and he almost missed some items.  It was nice that he allowed us to split the check by our items though.\n\nOverall, this is a good place to come by for happy hour.  I'd come for some drinks and a couple of HH appetizers.  Not really sure I would come for a dinner.  More of a 3.5 stars, but the $1 oysters + the sauce it comes with and the $6 cocktails round it up.", "author": "Stephanie Z."}

Previous dishes we liked, varied this time.\n\nAhi tartare: Outstanding. Well-flavored with sesame oil and the crisps are wonderful.\n\nMinced chicken lettuce cups. Actually romaine spears, tasty chicken filling with very little filler. Second best behind ahi tartare.\n\nEggplant & Tofu: tasty, but very intense sauce. Needs rice, so excellent for table to share.\n\nSteamed pork buns spicy kimchi. Fail: bao too big and thick, much too bready. Char siu sweet but good quality. But kim chi was arranged around the outside of pork filling, so folded over, the two fillings stayed separate, never mingling flavors. This dish needs reworking.\n\nTea smoked deviled eggs still 5-star. Down 1/2 level this time:\n- Lamb naan. bread didn't seem quite as good this time.\n- Corn fritters. Still good, though; much better than Soi4/Oakland.\n- Spare ribs. Seemed a little too sweet this time but still good.

Their happy hour is Mondy-Saturday from 3-6pm. \n\nThey have some pretty nice options, both for drinks and food. For the drinks, they have nice mixed drink options (bourbon maple, prickly tequila, vodka ginger, etc.), wine and some beers. The prices range from $4 for beer, $6 for wine and mixed drinks. For food, they have a bunch of small bites, including dumplings, oysters, ahi tuna, sliders and more. The prices for the food range from $1-4 or $24 for the pu pu platter, which includes an assortment. My favorite from the platter was the taro chips and the chicken satay. \n\nIf you want more bang for your buck, skip the sparkling wine, it's served in a flute, so you're getting a smaller quantity. Opt for the cocktails! The oysters are worth it, at a dollar a pop, they weren't too small and there was no sand. Also, the sauce pairing is a kimchee cocktail sauce and it wasn't too spicy. \n\nThe spot is quite spacious, but during happy hour they were only seating people at the bar, small tables near the bar and the small lounge area.

I had been to the E&O in San Jose, like, 10 years ago, and didn't remember the food, vibe, etc., but this was great. We tried a bunch of dishes--the satay platter, the cauliflower, the green papaya salad, the fries, the chicken spring rolls, and the tuna tartare. All were beautifully plated and very tasty. I especially enjoyed the tuna--just the right amount of seasoning. The kids loved the satay platter (except the roasted mushrooms, which were very smoky).\n\nAs for service, two thumbs up! The server was completely on top of things and very prompt with extra requests. There was an additional server clearing plates, getting water/drinks/etc. - well done!\n\nI also thought the location was quite convenient. Union Square is kind of a drag and overrun with tourists.

The restaurant is a short walk from the Powell St. BART station. The restaurant's ambience is perfect. The dim lighting and stylish dining decor greet patrons with a truly enjoyable dining experience. The noise level is loud, with everyone chatting away, but not too loud that it overpowers any conversations to be heard at your table.\n\nFOOD\nE&O's Happy Hour is 3-6pm (Mon-Sat) and it was a great value!

I enjoyed the ambiance of this place. It's basically 3 floors but the top/bottom are mainly for events while the entrance floor is for dining. It does get pretty packed even outside HH times so I recommend reserving a table beforehand. \n\nWHAT WE GOT: \n\n- Squash dumplings- One of my favorites of all the dishes in addition to the ceviche. They let you order in a serving of 5 or 6. The dumplings were filled with a load of squash and the wrapping tasted fresh. The sauce was very flavorful and went well with the dense dumplings. GET THIS! \n\n- Ceviche - My second favorite dish. Unlike normal ceviche this one has a coconut kick which is a. Ice twist. Also A-1 presentation on being served in a half coconut shell as well! On the sides they also lay out thin taro chips that paired great with the ceviche. \n\n- Drunken Noodle- The noodles had a great texture but I think it was hard to eat for me because of how salty it was.\n\n- Roasted Eggplant - can't go wrong with eggplant. Great flavor and roasted well. Nothing too spectacular about this one though. \n\n- Corn Fritters - it seems like this was something everyone tries so we ended up getting them too. They give you 2 per order. The fritters are HUGE and composed of tons of sweet corn. I enjoyed eating them since they added a nice mix in texture with all of the softer dishes we got. The sauce they pair it with is tasty as well. \n\nI docked a star because service was meh. We felt rushed to order/eat and also a little pressured to buy drinks. When we didn't we were overlooked - con of looking young I guess? \n\nFor all the above we paid around $85 for 2 people outside HH.

Flavor was sweet and tangy/citrusy\n- CHICKEN SATAY - Pretty tender chicken. Plain on its own but there's a peanut dipping sauce to go with it. Or pair it with the red curry sauce from the dumplings if you're getting those.\n- AHI TUNA TARTARE - Basically your classic tuna poke.\n\n* DUMPLINGS ($1) - 3.5/5\n[butternut squash, red curry sauce]\nMeh, the overall texture of the dumpling was too mushy and doughy. I did like the red curry sauce though, which I'd recommend saving to dip your taro chips or chicken satay in.\n\n* OYSTERS ($1) - 4.5/5\n[local variety, kim chee cocktail sauce]\nFresh!

The kimchee gave it a little kick.\n\n--------\n\nFrom a previous lunch visit:\n\n* PRAWN SALAD ($16) - 3.5/5\n[gulf white prawns, cucumber, asian fruit, cashews, onions, fresh chilies, thai basil, mint, cilantro, lemon oil, maldon salt]\nCrisp and fresh ingredients, but a little disappointing in flavor. I was expecting sweet and spicy from the fruit and chilies, but the chilies didn't have any punch to them. The prawns were big and well cooked but few in quantity.\n\n* INDONESIAN FRIED RICE ($17) - 3.5/5\n[gulf white prawns, char siu pork, vegetables, egg, chilies]\nWe got the fried rice without the chilies and it honestly tasted like any other fried rice, just greasier and saltier. Maybe it would've been more interesting with the chilies.\n\n* DRUNKEN NOODLES / PAD KEE MAO ($16) - 3.5/5\n[broad rice noodles, ground pork, chinese broccoli, chilies, basil]\nNot bad, but again not very memorable.

I really liked the presentation of their ceviche. It was served on a cracked half of coconut on a bed of yuca fries.

Ceviche was a lil too tangy and i wonder what they do with all those coconuts? \n\nPad Thai tasted funny but their fried rice was really good.

Also very cheap finger food. \n\nOrdered a dozen oysters (much regret) and two ahi tuna tartes. They were probably the worst oysters I've ever had. The oysters had either broken shell or sand in every single oyster I ate! It was so gross and really annoying to eat.\n\nDespite the bad oysters, the bartender was kind and helpful in selecting drinks. I also tried the prickly tequila, which consisted of prickly pear, tequila, and lime. Very interesting drink! I really liked the prickly pear, considering I have never seen any other bar offer this before. \n\nReally nice place to go for happy hour, despite the horrible experience I had with the oysters.", "author": "Annie H."}

Some of your favorite simple Asian dishes served in bowls with clean lines so, it's fancy now. The small plates were very tasty! We had the coconut milk seafood ceviche which was superb! If you're not allergic to seafood, you MUST have this even if you don't think you like ceviche! Duck buns- delish! Calamari- crispy, flavorful and light not greasy. The crab Rangoon was ok. The amount and flavor of the crab was great. They turned it up with the addition of goat cheese, but meh! The wonton wrap was very good though- yes they have a texture and flavor so don't think I'm crazy commenting on that Lol! But I'll keep my Rangoon with well whipped and seasoned cream cheese. Smoked deviled egg was quite tasty. Served chilled so be aware of that. Now, entrees- the black cod was, oddly, just okay. I expected more. Cod is so delicate so yes you do have to be cautious when seasoning, but they could've done more with the rub. Korean fried rice- good pieces of shrimp and pork, but the flavor was just okay. I asked for a side of the hoisin sauce served with the duck buns  in order for punch up the flavor. The service was fine. I'd return, if only for that ceviche!", "author": "Athena A."}

However I didn't realize this was the dining area, so when I asked for the happy hour menu, the waitress told me happy hour was only served at the bar and at the high top tables in the front area (some private, some communal). Keep that in mind if you're there for happy hour!\n\nMy friend and I tried the following:\n\nButternut squash dumplings with red curry sauce ($1 each): the dumpling itself tasted a little bit sour to me, but I really enjoyed the light curry sauce it was served in\n\nOysters ($1 each): this is what we came for, and it did not disappoint! I forgot where our server said our oysters were from, but it was somewhere off the Washington coast\n\nIndonesian corn fritter bites ($3.50): each order comes with 3 small pieces and they were SO good. This was probably our favorite hot small bite. Definitely get this if you like sweet corn\n\nAhi tuna tartare ($3): I'm usually not a huge tuna person, but this dish had been liberally smothered with sesame oil and came served on a nice crunchy chip, so I really enjoyed it\n\nTamarind and hoisin pork spare rib ($3): This was okay, but my opinion is probably biased because I'm not huge on the taste of tamarind. I got this so there would be some actual meat in this (otherwise light) meal\n\nMushroom satay ($2): each order comes with one skewer with a portabella mushroom slice. I love portabellas so I liked this, but thought it was a bit pricey at $2/skewer.\n\nWe each got a drink as well, but neither of us particularly liked our drinks. I had the sutter punch (vanilla bean infused rum, pineapple gum, lime) and my friend had the daily white wine.\n\nThis happy hour wasn't as cheap as I thought it would be...we each ended up paying around $34!

We got a bunch of dishes for the table - Indonesian corn fritters, butternut squash dumplings, shaking beef, paneer naan, and vegetarian chow mein. I would say the best thing was the corn fritters. I specifically picked the butternut squash dumplings so I ate most of that dish. 5 small dumplings in a creamy curry sauce for $14. They were good and stuffed with squash. The shaking beef dish was $28 for a plate mostly of veggies (tomatoes, bell peppers and a ton of onions) and a little bit of beef also slathered in a ton of sauce. The chow mein was ok. I didn't try the naan but our Indian friends loved it as they said it was made with fresh paneer/cheese. At the end of the meal, we had the chocolate silk road cake. I only had a bite and it was pretty good. But I could see it being rich if you had to eat more than half. My bf, who isn't even a chocolate fan really liked it too.

We decided to order a bunch of small plates.  The Indonesian corn fritters (two on a plate) were huge, crispy, delicate and the corn was fresh and sweet! So good.  The chickpea fries looked great but the flavor and texture was just okay. The shiitake dumplings were to little pillows bursting with flavor---to die for! Next time I am ordering one just for myself!  The butternut squash dumplings were a surprise--slightly sweet with a savory curry sauce with a hint of heat! Yummy! We also ordered a mushroom satay and a chicken satay (for the hubby)--both flavorful. For some freshness we ordered the coconut and jicama salad which was wow! Crunchy, sweet, salty, sour and full of flavor! WE rounded off the meal with chocolate in mandarin--devils food cake, bittersweet chocolate mouse mandarin orange ganache with miso caramel!

The staff there was excellent and accommodating in getting us there and seated despite the craziness. \n\nBelow is what we tried-\n\nAhi Tuna Tartar- Served with black sesame crackers.  Excellent fresh and flavorful. The black sesame crackers were a tasty addition\nPanir Naan- Cucumber raita, roasted tomato chutney. Very good. Great option for vegetarians.\nCorn Fritters- Served with sweet chili soy sauce. This was a signature item of theirs and was excellent. \nShiitake Mushroom Dumplings- Very good\nSatay Your Way- We did a vegetarian style with tofu, and fresh veggies. It was excellent\nGrilled Cauliflower- Great as well.\nDevils food cake-Sinfully sweet, but a must have. Served with a to doe for salted Carmel sauce. \n\nAside from the food being great, (Props to the chef) the staff was amazing. The manager Akop went above and beyond to make our experience, and my friend's birthday, absolutely memorable. He sent over champagne for us to toast with, and the tasty birthday dessert. Our waiter, who I am blanking on his name (Male, younger with blond hair) was amazing as well. He was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. He made some great suggestions on modifying the menu for my vegetarian friend, while also suggesting some tasty dishes for those of us that ate meat/fish. Lastly, the host was also wonderful. She was pleasant and even checked on us during our meal. She was also nice enough to charge my phone for me while I dinned.\n\nOverall our experience was great.

It's also on the more reasonable side, price wise, which added to the challenge.\n\nWe had a private room, and this is where the one star is knocked off. The wallpaper in this room made EVERYONE in my party (and there were 11 of us) dizzy and feeling like we were on a cruise ship.  I also wasn't a fan of our server. She was slow and hardly checked on us. Even though a tip is guaranteed as it was built in, this seems unprofessional.\n\nAnyways, we all ordered different things. The edamame was delicious, but what you expect at places that do steamed edamame.  I had giant Indonesian corn fritters which were enough for 4 people. They were challenging to eat because they fell apart rather quickly.  Friends got the pad thai, the roasted cauliflower (delicious), chicken lettuce cups, dry fried green beans, and the kimchi spring rolls. The food is good, filling and unique.

Our server came around, with a frown :( sad he wasn't too enthusiastic about the menu. I guess we were taking too long perusing through the yelp photos as he did not seem too please at us for not being able to make our selections quickly. (I'm sorry, it's a bad habit, but i can't help check out my selections with my eyes prior to ordering an entree). \nAnyhow, we ended up sharing the following as we weren't too hungry.\n\nPapaya salad: Too much vinegar. Missing umami flavor. Was not really balanced and definitely lacked the pow you would get at a traditional asian restaurant. I get that it's \"asian fusion\"  but, i felt the flavors were diluted and the vinegar overpowering.\n\nSpicy Green Bean: Great flavor, loved the blistering chared-ness of the green beans, but OMG the tiniest portion ever. I get that it's a side, but really? the serving was less than my fist..and for $9...Maybe i just have to get accustomed to the ridiculous pricing of DTSF eats?\n\nE&O Burger: great flavor and pairings. Burger was cooked nicely, fries were delicious. Good burger overall, very happy with the kimchee on the bottom bun.\n\nOverall, it was a decent meal. I probably will not come back as I feel the food did not \"wow\" me and was not too memorable. Also for the price, there are definitely better options out there with more bang for your  buck.

However, I was seriously impressed with almost everything we ate at E&O given the diversity and range of the true fusion menu. The casual yet ambiance with great service is the icing on the cake. \n\nWe started off with the butternut squash dumplings based on our waitress's recommendations - these are a must. The flavorful and tender dumplings in the rich red curry are a unique and memorable combination. \n\nEntrees we went with the steak satay and lamb naan. The satay wasn't anything particularly unique or memorable. That being said, very well cooked steak with a great hint of seasoning - as straightforward as it gets. When it came to the lamb naan, I was honestly surprised with how much my Indian palate enjoyed it. Ground lamb was excellently seasoned, the bread was soft, and the raita yogurt sauce was an awesome complement. Also ordered a side of eggplant and tofu. It looked great, but was honestly pretty flavorless. \n\nDessert menu looked bomb, but I'd already sinned with a double scoop of Ben & Jerry's earlier in the day.

We were expected to get those high tables, but since we came a bit early, we were being able to be seated at the regular table. The setting is really dimmed and I laughed at my friend who use her phone flashlight to read the menu. The sever is really sweet, asking if we enjoyed the food. \nWe decided to do family style and here's what we ordered:\nSmall-\nIndonesian Corn Fritters (\nHighly recommend! It comes with the special sauce and it's super crunchy) \n\nRolls&Dumpling-\nButternut Squash Dumplings (it's ok, nothing special, taste like curry) \n\nRice&Noodles-\nIndonesian Friend Rice (pretty delicious , also recommend getting this)\n\nDrunken Noodles ( there were so little noodles ,'it's ok ) \n\nMeat&Seafood\nWood Roasted Char Siu Black Cod (NOT WORTH THE PRICE, although it taste good, the portion is so small...good if ur ballin$) \n\nOverall, Price sucks for the portion size, but it's not bad for the taste", "author": "Judy M."}

Happy hour goes from 3-6 I think Monday - Saturday. \n\nBeer is $4, cocktails are $6, and the hh food menu ranges from $1-6. I mainly came for the oysters. They were fresh and pretty good. Downside is that they were the tiny ones, so you go through them really quickly!!! Watch out if you are on a budget! If you don't like oysters, definitely get the dumplings!!! It was so tasty  ahi tuna was alright, wouldn't pay $3 for one.  My friends got the sliders and they came with a side of taro chips, this was also good. \n\nThe waiter was super nice and helpful. I love how happy hour was ending and he came around and told us about last round. This gave us time to really order the last minute beers and extra order of oysters. So thumbs up to the service. \n\nWe didn't have to wait for a table and they could accommodate a large party. I definitely will come here again and want to try the dinner menu.

HH would probably be my favorite though, if I had to choose.  =)\n\nLunch:  Came here to celebrate my former boss's birthday and started with the corn fritters, per her recommendation and if I know one thing about my former boss, she does not steer anyone in the wrong direction.  It's also one of the more popular items on the menu it seems, and with good reason.  A mouthful of crispy deliciousness dipped with sweet and tangy chili soy sauce.  However, the pad thai that I ordered as my entree was a bit off the mark for my taste, bland and underwhelming.\n\nHappy Hour:  Booked a reservation in advance for a decent sized party and when we showed up, everything was already set up for us.  Of course, from previous experience I opted for the corn fritters, though the ones from the HH menu are smaller in portion than the regular lunch/dinner menu.  The sampler included the house ribs and some sliders but the portions and price ratio left a bit to be desired.  \n\nDinner:  Lastly, a vendor treated me out for dinner and the first thing out of my mouth were the corn fritters lol.  Luckily, we were there at the tail end of HH and we were able to sneak in an order of oysters and drinks.  For the entree, I went with the shaking beef, cooked with red onions, tomatoes, chilies, and watercress.  Nothing from the dish really blew me away to make a lasting impression but c'est la vie.  \n\nOverall, E&O is a solid option if you're looking for a sit down place for HH and a venue that doesn't get too noisy.", "author": "Kevin C."}

Ok, I understand what she was trying to say but it doesn't say that anywhere on their website or OpenTable do how are customers supposed to know that? \n\nFurthermore, you have a customer who was ready to drop $200 dollars on a meal at your restaurant and you can't make one exception to let them order a $15 Pupu platter to as appetizer???

We arrived at our designated time and were quickly pointed to the direction of the table that was set up for us. We made a reservation for 6 girls and were seated at a table for 10 in the very front of the restaurant, away from the ambiance and sadly away from the service. We were seated for a while before a server even came up to ask if we wanted drinks. We asked for waters for the table as well as a cocktail that was 'meant to be shared' according to the waitress. She proceeded to get us excited about the drink, the amount of alcohol, the presentation in a pineapple, so we agreed to try it. The drink finally came out after the appetizers were already eaten. She brought out 'this' cocktail in two regular soda glasses, saying that she separated it for us. After having a sip of the cocktail, I quickly realized this wasn't properly made. The glasses were filled to the brim with ice, not a hint or smell or even a slight taste of alcohol in sight. I decided to see how much of the drink vs how much ice we actually got. I poured the liquid into a separate glass while holding the ice back only to realize that we got a little more than a shot glass of juice. The waitress said we could order another drink but didn't come back to take the order. We asked for additional utensils for the table and didn't get them until after dinner was over and we had to ask for our water glasses to be refilled multiple times.

We are big fans of their food - unique, tasty and nice presentation. Their corn fritters, poke (fresh), lettuce cup, plum edamame...just to name a few of their dishes are always enjoyed by all of us. I've been going there for 18 yrs. now. \n\nI would have given a five star for our recent visit, but as a Mom, I was disappointed with the service for our special birthday event. The Service was ok. Don't get me wrong, their staff is very polite, but our waitress (still polite) was not attentive. There is a difference between being polite and knowing how to be effectively attentive to customer's needs. For example, I told the waitress about my daughter's birthday before dinner started and also when I made the reservation. I had to still earn her attention to even order a cake with a candle \"way\" after our dinner dishes were taken away. \n\nAnd, this is a small gripe, but when it's a birthday celebration, I think the restaurant should have a standard courtesy serving cake. We had just attended another birthday celebration at Water Bar last week and they were very attentive about the event and served a wonderful complimentary cake to my girlfriend's daughter and paid extra attention to her throughout dinner. And, we both spent about the similar amount ($400+). Net...I'll continue to bring my family here, but not for special events.", "author": "Junie D."}

My parents were staying in Union Square and the wife was going to meet up after work from BART, so I was looking for a good Asian restaurant within easy walking distance for all parties.  I love SF but I drive around SF only as a last resort - high stress driving!\n\nE & O looks like a sleek, modern lounge with an open bar in the front with a large dining area in the back with open kitchen.  Nice aroma from their wood-fired ovens!  The menu is pretty creative with the flavors of SE Asia, India, and Japan and Korea.  In terms of food, all dishes we ordered exceeded our expectations - so five star endorsement for me!\n\nCocktails included the Moscow Mule (refreshing alcoholic ginger beer) and the Chili-Tamarindo Margarita.  Both were good, but the Mule was my favorite.\n\nIndonesia Corn Fritters are a must - They arrived hot and crispy and the two pieces easily accommodated the four of us.  With the dipping sauce, I got that nice one-two punch of sweet followed by heat.  The crispiness of these fritters was unreal.\n\nButternut Squash Dumplings - Very good.  We liked the firm dumpling skin and the rich butternut squash filling in the inside and the lighter curry sauce in the outside.\n\nShort Rib Sliders with Taro Chips - Dad got these from the Apps menu.  Three sliders with perfectly cooked and juicy short ribs.  Shredded taro chips were good too.  I managed to get half of one slider.\n\nSteelhead - Their salmon was cooked perfectly - skin-on, moist, and full of flavor from the mild sweet-sour broth.  I liked the balance of more butternut squash (or was it yams?) and green veggies.  Salmon is extremely hard to cook well but E&O aced this one.\n\nBlack Cod - Mom and wife both got this and absolutely loved it.  A good-sized piece of fish on a bed of water spinach.  The fish was also moist and juicy, and reminds us of the butterfish at Roy's which had a miso-soy-mirin glaze.  E&O's version seemed more balanced - not as rich or sweet.  I think it's actually better.\n\nSides - We got eggplant and tofu (Thai-inspired) and Kennebec Fries, which came out piping hot and crispy with some sort of unique seasoning (Japanese Togarashi?)\n\nDesserts - We shared Bananamisu and Mango Panna Cotta and had some disagreement.  Both were wonderful but I liked the panna cotta better with its creamy tart taste with some crunchiness (nuts perhaps?).  Everybody else liked the Bananamisu - which looked like a Tiramisu but with a banana cake and less creamy and rich than the traditional Italian version.\n\nWould definitely recommend coming here - I was lucky to have a small group come so that we sampled a few dishes from their dinner menu. Service and ambiance top notch too!", "author": "Daniel C."}

The place sports a nice modern look with a comfortable atmosphere for having a nice chat. My friend and I opted to order 3 small plates and one entree. The price points of the dishes can be a bit high, but given that it is a nicer restaurant in the Union Square area, it isn't too unreasonable.\n\nFrom his recommendation, we got the chickpea fries and the Indonesian corn fritters. The chickpea fries tasted very similarly to falafels, but came in long rectangular strips with a curry aioli sauce. They were not what I expected at all, but was very delicious, being hot and presented very nicely in a  Chaokoh coconut milk can. I felt that the sauce was a bit lacking in flavor and didn't add much to the dish though the fries were quite excellent on their own. The Indonesian corn fritters were a wonderful delight as well. I enjoyed the light crisp of the fritters alongside the sweet tangy chili soy sauce. It's a small plate I would definitely recommend.\n\nOther than my friend's recommendations, we decided to try the Lapsang Souchong tea deviled eggs and the braised lamb noodle. The tea deviled eggs weren't mind blowing amazing compared to most well made deviled eggs, but I thought the tea flavor in the egg did make it unique and added some nice flavor into the creamy mix. It really makes me want to try using tea eggs the next time I cook deviled eggs for an event. The braised lamb noodle was absolutely amazing despite the portion size feeling a bit small. The lamb had that nice mild gamey flavor in it and went well with the chillies and sauce. The noodles were truly the star of the dish however, being wonderfully chewy and hand cut. I give the braised lamb noodles some high recommendations as well.", "author": "Joshua M."}

Truly disappointed for a restaurant that many people seem to highly praise. I came here for a birthday dinner and we were a large group of I think 12 or 13 people. \n\nWe approached the host stand and gave the name that the reservation was under. The Host looks on the computer, a bit hesitant and says \"sorry there's no one under that name\" and I tell him to look again, and he found it. We followed him to a private dining room with a group of people already sitting at the table. I scanned the people's faces and guess what? None of which I recognized! Uhh...I proceeded to tell the Host, \"This is not our table......\" The party in that room looked entirely confused as well! The host goes, really? i'm so sorry!!! Let me look again.\"  FINALLY he takes us upstairs and there was people we knew. While we sat down, our server asks us \"Would you like FLAT or SPARKLING water?\" I'm no water sommelier so I thought Tap water must = Flat. So I responded with Flat water. When I came back from the restroom, my boyfriend told me the host brought up a different group of people to OUR table. Yep He made that mistake twice!! How embarrassing.  \n\nAnyways, the server brought us our water and to my surprise they served us some fancy schmancy Acqua Panna. I looked at the table and there were already 7 empty water bottles.. Was this complimentary? No way they're just giving it away for free! My heart started beating, there's no way I'm paying over $5 for a bottle of imported water when SF tap water tastes just fine!  I pulled the server aside and asked her if  she could give us real tap water instead. She goes \"oh yeah sure sure.\" I told her \"Please stop serving us this bottle water. You guys charge for this water right??\" She says nervously \"Yes we do. But I'll start serving you tap water now\" Woman you shoulda served it in the begininning! I was getting pissed because I definitely cannot afford to pay for WATER when I could have it for free. \n\nNow time to order food. Since we were a large group we were stuck with a pre fixed menu. Super disappointed in this because the portions were quite small and we ordered only 2 of everything to feed 12-13 people.  There was only one meat dish, which was chicken skewers. Everything else was vegetarian! In the end when we got our bill, we ended up paying $87 for vegetables and it turns out they charged us $140 for freaking FLAT bottled water.\n\nI have never felt so scammed by a restaurant. The food was not good and I will never be back (not like that matters to them....but just saying). Now I understand if we came here with a normal small, group our experience would have been different. But with a large group it was just absolutely appalling!", "author": "Emi K."}

I asked the front where I could sit, and sat by the stools and high tables immediately next to the bar. Our server Tom seemed extremely irritated that my companion and I were only ordering from the happy hour menu, even commenting how his recommendations from the regular menu served ineffective.  My companion and I felt uncomfortable but were still considering whether to mention it or not when we noticed Tom actually directing other patrons to the bar and away from the tables around us where they had already been seated as they mentioned they wanted to order from the bar or happy hour menu. Stark difference from the serve received at a prior visit by Scott, who was nothing but wonderful.  The spring rolls continue to be excellent. The oysters had a slightly fishy odor stronger than other places. The squash dumplings were decent. Wanted just to stop by before dinner at around 4:30 p.m. for drinks and light snacks, so didn't try any of their entr\u00e9es.\n\nNote to Tom: It sucks when people order from the happy hour menu rather than the regular menu as it may result in less tip, but friendly service goes a long way and you may be surprised how people react in kind when you give great service. Even if not at this visit, but they will definitely return it in kind.\n\nNext time I'm going to ask if Scott is available.

I attend a law school near by and will for sure find myself here a lot more in the near future! Solid happy hour in the city. You will not be disappointed!", "author": "Cece F."}

I'd rather walk. The only reason why we came was for our boss' going away. \n\nBUT - I'm glad I was proved wrong. The interior is spacious and beautiful, great place to bring a date or a small group after a long day of shopping or walking around. I'm guessing this place doesn't get ridiculously crowded as It was easy to make a reservation for 10 for a weekday lunch. Probably because it's not really on the 'main strip' downtown though it's certainly in extremely close walking proximity...\n\nI definitely want to come back and check out happy hour (it's on Saturdays as well!)\n \nWe got quite a few items but I can't remember all of them -- everything was good and, yes, a bit overpriced, but you're in Union Square soo.. yea.\n\nThe highlight though was definitely the BUTTERNUT SQUASH DUMPLINGS!!  I'm a stickler on dumplings so again, my expectations were not high for these at all but HOLY SHIT THEY'RE AS GOOD AS EVERYONE ELSE HAS SAID. IThey're shaped like big raviolis and SO. DECADENT. Would order multiple of these if I came back for HH!!", "author": "Emily C."}

We ordered the oysters, calamari, butternut squash dumplings, shrimp satay, pad Thai and the Indonesian fried rice. Everything was ok... the Indonesian fried rice was really good. Don't get the pad Thai, it was the weirdest tasting pad Thai that our group has ever tasted and it had a weird sour taste to it. The restaurant is really expensive for the amount of food per dish.

The small and large plates Asian-fusion menu proved to be decently satisfying -- a difficult task for this type of cuisine. The Indonesian corn fritters are a house specialty, for maximum enjoyment coat them in the sweet, tangy chili soy sauce. The ahi tuna tartare is presented with black sesame crackers and come in large chunks of market fresh sashimi. The lamb naan is a savory delight with cucumber raita and roasted tomato chutney as accompaniments.\n\nUnion Square is becoming to be one of my favorite neighborhoods for hanging out and naturally, I found the best HH in the area. I love that I can get $1 oysters at 3pm! (because no one stays in the office til 5pm on a Friday, right?!) I was confident that Achoul could make me anything I wanted and he delivered: a refreshing but astringent Corpse Reviver #2 and an El Presidente, basically a rum version of the manhattan. \n\nA welcoming pit stop in this lively square with superb cocktails and $1 oysters.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-03-31", "description": "This place reminds me of PF Chang's, but more expensive and probably catered towards tourists since it's in Union Square, and business travelers. With higher price points, it's fine if you're expensing your meal to your company, but I probably wouldn't come back, given other options for Asian food, and Asian fusion in San Francisco. I guess it's good for big groups and tourists, but there are far better places out in the city that you're missing out on if you eat here!\n\nChicken Satay ($13) - They at least use free-range chicken, but this is expensive for what it is. I've had similar chicken satay at Thai restaurants for half the price. Get this if you really are craving chicken satay, but I'd pass on this and save it for the next time you go to a hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant.\n\nButternut Squash Dumplings ($13) - These are a bit pricey for dumplings, since you get 6 of them for $13. If you're really craving dumplings, go to a place that specialized in dumplings in the Outer Sunset. But if you're craving dumplings and willing to pay a little bit more, then these are fine. The sweet butternut squash filling makes it taste like a butternut squash ravioli, and almost a little bit on the dessert side since it's sweet. Good, but not amazing.\n\nIndonesian Corn Fritters ($9) - As if you couldn't tell by the name, these are pieces of corn, held together by batter and deep fried into small-burger-sized patties. If you don't like food with spices or cumin, it's best to avoid these. They are good and a better bang for your buck than some of the other appetizers, but almost any thing deep-fried is good.\n\nCod with Water Spinach ($27) - I love a nicely cooked miso glazed cod, but for $27 it was a little bit lackluster. It seemed like they just saut\u00e9ed spinach in a pan and threw a small piece of fish on it. It wasn't bad, but not worth $27.  It's similar to PF Chang's cod, but at a more expensive price. I was hungry when I finished my entr\u00e9e.\n\nIf you're not paying out of your own pocket, this is a fine place to go if you're looking for somewhere to seat a big party, or you're traveling, staying in Union Square and want something close by.  I wouldn't make a special trip to come back here - there are many other restaurants in the city that I would recommend over this one for Asian fusion, at more reasonable prices.", "author": "Christina L."}

We even asked and was told we'd be told about it but that never happened.  \n\nWe had butternut squash dumplings, Indonesian Fritters, shaking beef and drunken noodles. The first two were unique and excellent. \n\nI'm not sure if I have had so much Asian fusion that I am numb to the last two dishes, but they were just okay in my mind.  These are common dishes and I feel like I've been slightly more wowed at other restaurants by the same dishes.\n\nPerhaps I should have tried something else!  Oh well. Service was prompt.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-10", "description": "Now I remember when E&O was the hot destination back in the mid-1990's. Fusion was the latest trend back then, and it was an especially popular place for company dinner parties because the food spanned all parts of the Far East. That was at a time in my life when I probably thought of myself as a rising, semi-young Asian professional with dreams of the C-suite and a private secretary who gave me politically incorrect back rubs... yes, I said 'back'. Flash forward fifteen years and there ain't nothing young about me anymore, semi or otherwise. Rising? Yes...out of my bed. C-suite? Oh brother. And that private secretary is probably my boss' boss' boss, the one who could buy and sell me tenfold now.\n\nBut I am still Asian and here I am again, actually a couple of times with Jamie W. who had never been before. Our first time back wasn't bad as we had cocktails at the bar on a particularly empty evening. He had a $12 Walking Dead, a foreboding name for a reasonably subtle mix of Brugal Anejo rum, Appleton V/X, cinnamon, grenadine, grapefruit and absinthe (photo: http://bit.ly/1xOq2YJ). Mine was the more cosmo-oriented $11 Gazebo, a tropical blend of Hangar One vodka, Thai basil and pineapple (photo: http://bit.ly/1FCWliN). Cheers. Several months later, in the midst of the SantaCon stampede, we were willing to go anywhere to avoid the red-suited hipsters. We ducked in here for a light lunch and got seated next to a cackling hen party in the back.\n\nBecause I am still such a petite cherry blossom, I first ordered a Blushing Geisha, a refreshing mix of El Jimador tequila, sake and prickly pear (photo: http://bit.ly/1sh1gjq). Jamie ordered the $12 Crispy Chicken Spring Rolls which were just as pedestrian as their description with bean sprouts, cilantro, and carrot augmenting the filling with a dipping sauce made of sweet chile vinegar (photo: http://bit.ly/17sVFgJ). As a sucker for deviled eggs, I went for a pair of the Lapsang Souchong Tea Deviled Eggs at $2.25 a piece (photo: http://bit.ly/1AWuOVk). Even though they came with promises of char siu and lacquered bacon, they were rather salty but nothing a little more Best Foods mayonnaise couldn't have cured at a family picnic.\n\nWe then shared a simple bowl of $6 Wood Roasted Edamame Beans seasoned with Maldon salt and shiso fume furikake (photo: http://bit.ly/1xTKckB). Even though they looked overseasoned, it was probably the best of the appetizers we ordered. The last dish we shared as the $13 Roasted Squash & Kale Salad, which was pretty good mixed with goat cheese, pomegranate seeds, and toasted pumpkin seeds, all of it doused in a curried yogurt dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/1AAi70Y). Too bad I had it a couple of days after eating Trick Dog's outstanding kale salad which had the benefit of avocado chunks for four dollars less. I'm afraid that virginal thrill I had for E&O has evaporated in a jar of wrinkle cream lo these many years later. But hey, I'm still Asian, and I'm still rising... out of my chair.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...OK but lackluster fusion dishes are a mere shadow of what E&O used to be about\nCOCKTAILS - 4 stars...but the cocktails they still do well\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...still dark, spacious and West Elm-like \nSERVICE - 2 stars...snail-paced and hard to get the attention of the waiter\nTOTAL - 3 stars...the bloom has faded on this fusion pioneer", "author": "Ed U."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-05", "description": "I feel like the best way to describe E&O's is like a more Asian-leaning cuisine version of Cheesecake Factory--as in they pull from all sorts of ethnic foods, are decent, and nice for a special birthday outing. However, maybe not my usual dining ambiance (it's somewhere fit for a business dinner), and a little on the pricier end (this is the city after all).\n\nFirst was the BUTTERNUT SQUASH DUMPLINGS, and these were bombbb! By far the best dish though it was a small starer. We had the CHICKPEA FRIES as well, deep fried sticks of chickpea mash covered in tempura with what I want to say is a Dijon mustard dip. \n\nOur entrees were the 4-PIECE SATAY, the PAD KEE MAO, and the EGGPLANT SIDE, all of which were tasty--nothing too oversalted which can be an issue with Asian food (that MSG thooo). The PAD KEE MAO was a little past white girl spicy (but could be well handled by the flaming hot regulars), but bland as a dish. The EGGPLANT SIDE though omg! It's pretty oily for the health conscious but the future heart attack is so worth it! Great for pairing with rice.\n\nThe 4-PIECE SATAY had 4 skewers of your choice plus rice: 2 mushroom, shrimp, and chicken. Only had the chicken but could say it was dry and the most blah tasting thing of the day.\n\nThe venue is business fancy, with a seating area in the front that looked straight out of Z Gallerie. I'm not sure I'd come back though since I just don't think it was that spectacular when you can definitely have more unique dining experiences in the city. Service was also a little slack (our table got overlooked so many times), which is the downside of being young looking college students :/ HH might've been a better fit.", "author": "Rene B."}

The more casual seating creates a more laid back vibe where you can feel comfortable coming when you're a little more dressed down. The wait staff as well as the hostess were friendly and attentive. They have a solid variety of food options ($4 and under), a handful of $6 mixed drinks and wines, $4 beers. I ordered the mushroom satay, tuna tartare, and corn fritters from the happy hour menu. The mushroom satay was flavorful with a good portion size and at $2 I would order again. The corn fritters ($3.5) were a good portion size with three included, they were fresh and tasty, would recommend this dish. However, the tuna tartare included one golf ball sized bundle of chip with tuna on it. Even at $3 I was disappointed in the serving size and wish I had instead ordered another mushroom satay.

I think they compliment each other well, but if you can't taste the squash through the spicy curry, then what's the point? \nThe Japanese Bop was super!  Just make sure the kitchen doesn't burn the crispy rice.

We had to pick up something at the Banana Republic on Grant, so I thought this place would be a perfect place to grab some food and drink.  It just happened that SF was having one of its rare downpours when we got off Bart, so we were happy that this place wasn't too far from Bart. We got drenched despite the short walk, but it was warm inside the restaurant and we easily got a couple of seats at the bar. \n\nThis is our first time dining here since they've changed their name. Used to be called E&O Trading Company and they used to have a location in downtown San Jose, where we've eaten a few times. It's good to see that they still serve good food! \n\nI ordered the Moscow Mule, one of their HH drink specials, and the hubby ordered a glass of wine. The Moscow Mule was a bargain at $6. It was nice. I would definitely order that again.\n\nAs for food, we ordered the Pupu Platter ($22) which had two each of the following: The Tamarind & Hoisin ribs, Short Rib sliders, Corn Fritters, Chicken Satay, and Ahi Tartare. Pickled veggies and taro chips were also included. The food was nicely presented on the platter and we enjoyed everything. They were all tasty. We also ordered six pieces of the Butternut Squash dumpling. The bartender suggested we keep the remaining dumpling sauce to eat with our platter items, and I'm glad he did. The corn fritters were delicious dipped in the sauce. We sopped up every bit of that sauce! The Pupu platter is the way to go during HH. It's a good value and it will keep you from getting drunk too fast! \n\nWe were going to stop there, but we were curious so we decided to order one of their noodle dishes. We asked for a recommendation from the bartender and he suggested the Drunken Noodles. Another great suggestion. The hubby loved it. He wants to go back just for the noodles. I'd go back for that and more Moscow Mules! \n\nFor dessert, we shared the Devils Food Cake with whipped cream and salted caramel. I was wary of the five spice in the cake but it turned out fine. You can taste the five spice but it was subtle. The cream and the salted caramel were perfect with the cake.  Too bad we shared.

On weekday evening the place it is always packed downstairs with people enjoying the bites and libations.\n\nI am happy to say the place is still great after the redo. Although I wasn't exactly able to enjoy the fullness of the menu as again my friend and I planned on just enjoying a few drinks and bites during Happy Hour. I found the Blushing Geisha tequila, sake, prickly pear and wine refreshing and light and a nice deal for only 6 dollars. My friend equally enjoyed his Moscow Mule. \n\nFor the bites we were suggested the wood fired naan and the ahi tuna tartare which was served on a round chip. I found them both enjoyable and found myself wanting more. Maybe next time when there's more time, but at time we went at about 4pm on Saturday evening the place was empty which of course made the place really enjoyable! The good news is I want to return in the future when nobody is there again! E&O is the perfect place to come to after an afternoon of shopping in the city!", "author": "Jason F."}

The beef short rib sliders were so flavorful. Meat was not dry and they were served with fried taro chips. You get 3 sliders which is average for an app. The sliders had pickled veggies and cilantro atop the short ribs. So delicious. For entrees we ordered the Shaking Beef and Japanese Bop. Shaking beef had a nice kick to it and the sauce would have gone great with rice. Beef was very tender but it was not serve with anything else. I wish it came with a side of something so you could really utilize the sauce. The Japanese Bop wasn't my favorite. I definitely prefer the traditional Korean dish. I felt this dish was only made to look nice presentation wise rather concentrating on actual taste. It was just ok for me. I would not recommend it. And for the price, you could order something else worth your while. A thin block of pan fried white rice starts the bottom layer, then its topped with pickled veggies, spinach, a fried egg, and some seaweed and sesame seeds. The egg was a little underdone, I don't like when an over easy egg has most of the whites runny. The drink I ordered was really good, but for the price it was a bit small.

Truth is there are only 2 cut into 4 pieces - very pricey for spring rolls. Also had the chicken lettuce cups - not much twist on this except that the lettuce cups are very small pieces of romaine and the chicken was a bit too salty for our taste. Also orders the pad Thai- very good portion but was very dry.

The naan was naan, nothing special. I wasn't a huge fan of the flavoring on the mushroom satay. It tasted too much like sauce and didn't have well-balanced flavors. \n\nI also ordered a glass of wine. I enjoyed it, but the bartender replaced it when I was nearly done because another patron had complained about his. Two glasses of wine for the price of one?! Don't mind if I do!\n\nI thought about those dumplings all day the next day, so when a coworker asked me to find a spot for the two of us to eat dinner, I suggested E&O Kitchen. Although we couldn't get reservations (6:30 on a Thursday night), we decided to walk in and try to get a spot in the bar area. We lucked out and were immediately seated at a shared table. \n\nI ordered the full order of squash dumplings (much more expensive outside of happy hour pricing but still just as good!) and the corn fritters (amazing! especially with the sauce).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-04-03", "description": "My friend and I went to E&O Kitchen & Bar to celebrate her birthday. We arrived at approximately 3:30 and ordered a pupu platter and cocktails. As we were ordering our second round of drinks, our server told us that he would be leaving and that someone else would take care of us for the rest of our time. That did not happen.\n\nShortly after the first server left, someone came to ask if we needed anything. At the time, we did not, but as we finished our platter and our drinks, no one else stopped by to see if wanted anything. Servers, the hostess, and the manager, (as we discovered later) passed back and forth but didn't acknowledge us. Finally, we were able to flag down a busser  who then cleared our dishes. We told him that we were ready for our check. He said he would let our server know. Our server, whoever that was supposed to be, did not come. We waited another 10 minutes, with people walking by our table, and nothing. So we told another member of wait staff, and still nothing.\n\nIt wasn't until we started putting our coats on that anyone took notice. When we shared our experience with the manager, her response was that she had just started her shift and that usually the bussers don't collect the checks. That was it. No offer to rectify the situation in any way. Not even \"I'll relay this to my team.\" Just rudeness and the implication that we were at fault for not having gone more out of our way to hunt down a server. That is NOT our responsibility as customers. It is the responsibility of servers and managers in a restaurant to be attentive and to assess the needs of their diners -- not to ignore them for 30+ minutes and then give them attitude. \n\nOn the website, E&O professes to \"match our passion for food with our commitment to excellent service.\" That wasn't the case for my friend and me. In other words, we did not get the service that was described. Far from it. We do not plan to return to E&O, despite the GM's promise that we would be \"well taken care of\" if we returned. I'm just not comfortable giving my money to a business that treated us so poorly, and acknowledged us only when they wanted to collect payment.", "author": "Alison R."}

I wish we had kept walking. This place is very clearly aimed at tourists and FiDi happy hours which is fine, but the food should also be good.\n\nTo E&O's credit, I will say that the restaurant space itself is refined and comfortable. It felt very modern and upscale so kudos to the interior designers. I also think the service was really friendly, though I do personally dislike places that only have happy hour in their bar area but whatever, that is the management's choice. \n\nI initially was pretty excited about this meal because I am trying to eat a low carb diet before my beach vacation and E&O had some healthy options that sounded great. I opted for the Grilled Steelhead ($26) and A (who clearly is not concerned with being in shape for this vacation) had the E&O Wood Grilled Burger ($16). If I am being entirely honest, I was definitely hangry and should have ordered an appetizer but, for $26 and from watching some of the other plates come out, I thought I would have more than enough to eat. When they brought out our entrees, I almost laughed. The piece of fish was super small and the veggies served with it were not sufficiently sized at all. The menu description says its served with \"hot and sour\" broth, which apparently to the chefs at E&O means just wetting the bottom of the plate. When I took a bite, my laughter turned to rage because it tasted awful. Almost like throw up and the coconut relish did not work AT ALL. I devoured it, given my hunger, but I was very very angry about it. I didn't say anything to the waiter since I ate it all and didn't want it to look like I just wanted a free meal but I was definitely not a happy camper. A seemed to like his burger well enough but, given my diet, I could not try it so I don't know how much I believe him or if he was just trying to calm me down.

Especially old favorites. \n\nThere used to be an E&O in Larkspur as well as in San Jose, but the original one still remains, close to Union Square. This location has a unique feeling, like you're being transported to an exclusive nightclub/restaurant in a modern Asian city. I love Asian fusion restaurants and the dishes here don't disappoint. \n\nWe started with the salt and pepper calamari and the sweet chili dipping sauce that it came with was the perfect combination of tangy and sweet. Next, we shared the Satay Platter (my long time favorite from the Marin location) and the Indonesian fried rice. The satay platter came with a mix of chicken, steak, prawn, and portobello mushroom skewers. My favorite two were the steak and mushroom ones, which were surprisingly similar in taste, yet obviously completely different in texture. The fried rice was also a success.\n\nMy only note for improvement would have to be about the service.

The waitress literally walked around and did not even acknowledge us - that is definitely not how you treat a paying customer. We finally flagged down the hostess and asked us if someone can help or if we can move to the bar. She had some words with the waitress and came back herself to take down our order. Nobody ever came to apologize for the abysmal treatment we were definitely not warranted. After we quickly placed our order the bad service continued. The waitress seemed to be taking everyone else's order fine and again never even came up to us even apologize for ignoring us. The food that was brought to our table was just literally dumped on our table - no customary ' how is everything' or ' do you need anything'. The pork and kimchi potstickers were greasy and awful. The beet drink was basically beet water. So in short the service was awful and the food abominable. I have no idea how this place is so popular. I would never recommend this place", "author": "Smrithika A."}

Even briefly reading through other reviews, I can see that other diners have had the same experience of the server not being around and not doing anything. So just to clarify, when I was seated I am sure that my server was not \"obviously very busy\" since the restaurant was not even 1/4 filled at the time. That's when she was gone. She only had one other table of 2 diners in her section since the whole time I was there the only parties she approached were that party and my party. Yes, I kept my eyes on her the whole time because I was so surprised she still had a job and the food was unable to capture my attention.\n\nAlso, I work in the food hospitality industry so when I dine I always pay attention to service and I know what a busy server looks like. \nWhen she did return to her section she stood around having nothing to do for a long time before disappearing off the entire floor again.  I know the wonderful hardworking bus boy was very busy since he was clearing plates off all tables and I could see him doing his best trying to hustle. \n \nAnyway, from your response I am sure you will take absolutely nothing from my feedback. May I suggest that you find out who the busboy is and promote him? It looks really bad from the outside when a certain minority race are all employed as busboys at your establishment and working much hard than the rest of the staff who have better positions. \n\nTo summarize everything - service is horrible unless you get your busboy to help you while he is clearing your dishes. Food and drinks not worth consuming. Plenty of better options in the area.", "author": "Vicious G."}

The weak points of this meal were the satay platter and phat thai. The platter was overpriced for the quality of food 28$). While the ingredients were very fresh, the sauces were amateur and disappointing. The chicken and shrimp skewers were also dry. The phat thai was also vinegary with too much sauce.

I asked for water, and I had been waiting for about 15 minutes for a server to look over at our table or stop by-however, no one came. So I asked the hostess for some water and she was incredibly rude and said, \"I'm not a server here, but here's your water.\" Our server rarely paid attention to our table and all in all it wasn't a great experience at this restaurant.

I don't know how many places my friend had to call in order to get reservations for her birthday but this place definitely pulled through. The ambience is perfect for a celebration or a date. It has a good balance of sophistication but modern. The funky thing is that the bathroom is at the front of the restaurant and down a flight of stairs lol. \n\nBut most importantly the food and drinks here are amazing!!! My friend and I shared the satay platter which has a variety of 4 different satay sticks and we ordered a side of rice. The birthday girl ordered the shaking beef. All the meats were cooked to perfection and the portions are decent. Someone in our party also ordered the butternut squash dumplings and though they were tasty, the portion was very small.

Our server was Sasha and she was super sweet and nice.  She answered all of our questions and brought out our food and drinks at a good pace.  We first tried the Pu Pu Platter which features fritter bites, 2 sliders, 2 ribs, 2 chicken satay, 2 ahi tartare, and taro chips & pickled veggies. The fritters were cute, but the chicken satay skewers were the best.  I'm not a fan of peanut sauce, but their sauce was pretty good - not so peanuty.  hehe  Then I ordered the Fritter Burger for my entree.  For this one, I'd say AVOID!  It's not bad, it's just the fritters used as buns absolutely do not work as buns and the whole thing collapses and becomes really messy.  For drinks, I had the Vodka Ginger (it was ok) and the Vodka Thai Basil - which was really good!  The texture was so smooth.  I'll definitely order this one again.", "author": "Shaun W."}

Starving for a good meal afterwards, Yelp led us here for dinner.\n\nI usually refer to other yelper's pics to help me make my menu selections but sadly there were few pics here, and most were of the Corn Fritters.\n\nAmbiance 5/5: I loved the dim lighting and candles at every table. \n\nMy GF and I made a reservation for 7pm, arrived 15 minutes early but we were seated almost immediately. I did notice there were 2 other tables of 4 open next to us , but we were placed at a smaller table for 2. Within the next 10 minutes, those 2 tables were filled by couples, also parties of 2. I am not sure if this was intentional, if the larger tables were saved for couples, or they try to fill the smaller tables first.\n\nWe ordered :\n\nLap Souchong Tea Deviled Eggs $2.25/ea  5/5: These are truly a beautiful, delicious masterpiece of asian fusion. All other \"fusion\" restaurants need to take a note of this! Deviled egg meets tea egg , seasoned perfectly, garnished with chinese bacon. I savored every bite of this egg. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\nIndonesian Corn Fritters $13 4/5 : The portion was actually quite generous for this dish. Crispy corn fritters with a unique sweet and tangy soy chilli sauce. The sauce really made this dish for me. Of course I added extra sirracha for a heat kick.\n\nPork Tenderloin $21 3/5: The pork was tender, nicely plated on top of black bean sauce. The grilled bok choy tasted or smelled of wax, I did not enjoy them. I am not sure if at this point our tiny table was so full of food that I was smelling the candle or if the veggies were just burned. The dish was overall tasty, but I don't see how it was a fusion dish.\n\nBeef Short Rib Sliders $16 1/5: This dish was the only disappointment of the night. The bread was soggy, and the taro chips had no seasoning. The meat had little flavor and tasted like a wet Banh Mi (Vietnamese Sandwich). We did get this removed from our tab, so the review here is not affected by the dish. The manager also came to our table to apologize and explain this is one of the best sellers here. Unfortunately we could not agree with our experience.\n\nService: Our server only came to check on us once, our water carafe got switched out once as well. It was very hard to make any eye contact with any of the waitstaff, as they hustled and bustled back and forth and never looked our way. This is why I had to deduct one star. The attentiveness from wait staff was not up to par, but once we finally did flag someone down, The provided good service. \n\nNote: We were pretty cramped with our 4 dishes, water carafe and stinky candle. We should have asked for a larger table.\n\nPortions: We wanted to order an additional dish, but our server said that was a good amount of food. We ordered 4 dishes and finished every last bite.\n\nTip for people with kiddies: They do offer wax molding hand outs for the kids. I was lucky enough to be seated at a table who had a child in their party. We we also provided some wax moldings upon request.", "author": "Sharon N."}

We came early at 5 PM when it opened on a Sunday, and it filled up rather quickly.  This is a rather large restaurant with a long bar, and they know how to make an East Coast style martini!  The chardonnay that wife had was excellent. The menu is a curious fusion of many Asian flavors, including Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Thai/Indochina, Indonesia, Indian, and French. We ordered oysters on half shell with Kimchi sauce (very fresh, wonderful sauces), Ahi tuna tartare (truly wonderful, fresh and delicious sesame oil hinted sauce), green papaya and cucumber salad (very fresh and tasty), salt and pepper calamari (crisp and tasty).  For the main course, wife ordered the wood roasted char siu black cod, which was cooked just right with a delicate and tasty sauce, and I ordered their \"famous\" fritter burger, which uses corn fritters for the bun, and has many other fusion ingredients- this was huge and very tasty if a bit messy.  The service was quite friendly and professional.  This restaurant seems to be open 11 AM-11 PM except on Sundays when it opens at 5 PM.  This Sunday evening, the noise level was reasonably quiet but one can imagine that it could be very lively on other nights, especially during the happy hour, which seems quite popular according to reviews.

The portion size was good though.\n\nRoasted eggplant: I like that it came with onions, peppers and tofu. Again, the flavor was very similar to the shaking beef, and was on the sweet side. Eggplant doesn't need such strong seasoning and can taste great with less.\n\nBlack cod: I especially liked the bean sprouts at the bed of the fish. The fish itself was okay. Nothing spectacular.\n\nMango panna cotta: My favorite of the night. There's a creamy cheese-like garnish above the panna cotta and that just made everything taste great.\n\nAll in all E&O Asian Kitchen is a pretty decent place for dinner. They have interesting cocktails and a variety of menu items to satisfy all diets and preferences.", "author": "Sherry L."}

Chose E&O because of its cozy decor and convenient location in Union Square next to the Sutter Garage. Service is professional from the moment we walked inside. Promptly seated for 7pm reservation. \n\nCosmopolitan ($10) is surprisingly good deal. Pink, lime pulps, and tasty. Singapore Sling ($12) is a prefect re-rendition of the the drink served on Singapore Airlines first class lounge. Well done! The French red blend Equis ($11) was undrinkable. My friend set it aside far enough for the waiter to notice. He took it away and gave him a cosmo instead. The wine had a weird sweet taste reminiscent of a cold medicine.\n\nFood was decent. It's Asian fusion with a lot of Asian ingredients but easy on the \"ethnicity factor\" to cater to American palate. \n\n*Green Papaya & Cucumber Salad ($12) is a huge platter of shredded Asian affairs. Owing to the fact that green papaya is usually not great in this country, E&O makes do with pickled apple to give that fresh tart flavor. I would appreciate more chili and peanuts on this plate.\n\n*Duck Imperial Rolls ($12) are two rolls cut into four pieces served on banana leaf. Roll wrapper is not too think and crispy on every bite. Duck is minced and marinated. Served with the tasty lime ginger dip. It's pretty good, a welcoming twist from the usual shrimp rolls.\n\n*Butternut Squash Dumplings ($13) is a miss. It's too much like squash rivioli. Mushy and uninspiring. The Thai curry dip is tasty though.\n\n*Malaysian Dry Braised Chicken ($20) is well done. Chicken is not dry but juicy inside. It's slow-cooked and tender. Coconut cinnamon braise a good complement to the taste of the chicken.\n\nE&O Asian is one of its kind in the area. Asian fusion in a very comfortable setting. The decor is colonial, with mezzanine seating open up like a verandah. The have happy hour and specific city dining menu. Manila was the feature of the night we ate.

I tend to not think of Asian food when it comes to gluten-free dining so I was glad to be introduced to this restaurant. Right away I was very impressed even just upon entering. The interior design is amazing cloaked in warm inviting earth tones.\n\nMy daughter, Ashlee, home from college, joined me for lunch. Presented with our gluten-free menus (I love it when a restaurant has a specific gluten-free menu), it was hard to choose there are so many GF options. We opted to begin with the shrimp satay served with basil mango dipping sauce. It was lovely. I am so used to simple eating that it was a delight savoring all the unique flavors I do not get to experience at home. I enjoyed the lightly pickled veggies as well as the perfectly prepared shrimp. The dish was very creative.\n\nI just had to try the E&O wood grilled hamburger with brown rice flour sesame bun with sriracha aioli, green papaya salad, white cheddar and fried egg. I asked them to hold the cheese and egg since I can't do cow's milk or egg. As it turns out, the gluten-free bun is Canyon Bakehouse which just happens to be my favorite hamburger bun. Oh, joy! It was delicious and a treat to enjoy a hamburger with a bun out on the town.\n\nI could see right away the awesome quality of the burger. It is so hard to find a good burger these days. My meal was delightful.\n\nMy daughter opted for the Indonesian fried rice with gulf white prawns, char siu pork, vegetables, egg and chilies. She was very impressed. This this was way out of the box for her so the fact that she liked it is a solid testimony.\n\nFor dessert, our only option was the sorbet but, wow, what a sorbet selection. There were three options: coconut pandan (Asian grass with a vanilla flavor), grapefruit and mango/passion-fruit. The flavors were very exotic. I was very impressed and pleased.\n\nWhen asked about cross contamination procedures, the chef, Sharon Nahm, came to our table and assured as that precautions are taken to avoid gluten contamination including proper equipment procedures and hand washing. Of course one never has a guarantee but I felt confident (and safe) after talking to her.\n\nWe had a lovely experience at E&O Asian Kitchen and would love to go back.

We were seated immediately near the kitchen. \n\nWe decided to do a \"tapas\" style dinner ordering some of the small plates/apps from the quite varied menu. \n\nCorn Fritter - 2 served, along with a dipping sauce. I highly recommend this dish. Some folks think it's too large, but as long as you don't try to eat it with your hands, I found it fine. Delicious, undoubtedly.\n\nPortobello Mushroom Satay - Probably wouldn't get this again. By no means was it a bad dish, but I found the mushroom a little bit too spongy for my taste. \n\nFries - HUGE serving, easily enough for 3 people, and amazing. The fry on them was awesome. Crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. Just how you want them. Served with ketchup, but I asked for an aioli of some kind and was given a really scrumptious garlic aioli. A must try. \n\nPanir naan - My only issue here is that the filling to bread ratio is a little askew. I would've liked slightly thicker bread. But, totally minor, and I'm nitpicking. A must try as well.\n\nButternut squash dumplings- so amazing. Also a must try. The dumpling is not chewy, the filling makes my mouth water as I write this review! \n\nYou'll not be disappointed.

When we tried to figure out what water spinach is, she couldn't offer anything other than \"it's like spinach with smaller leaves.\" Well, the hollow stem should've been it's defining feature.

Such a nice feeling to be greeted by the hosts with big smiles and such accommodation. The ambience is always very calm and relaxed, despite being full with lots of patrons!\n\nWe walked in and we were immediately given the seating area next to the front windows. Our area had a great couch, a bench, and they even help fit our group by moving over some of the lounge-ish chairs into our area as well. Sandra introduced herself as our server--and she was attentive, generous, efficient, and made it feel like we would receive our drinks and food in flash. \n\nWe ordered a round of Pu Pu Platters ($22 Each). Definitely worth the price. Included in the platter was two each of the Indonesian Corn Fritter Bites, the Beef Short Rib Sliders, Tamarind and Hoisin Pork Spare Ribs, and Chicken Satay. The corn fritters were great--nice crisp with traces of a tasty oil that it was fried in. The corn bursts in your mouth with great seasoning that melds so well with the batter. The sliders were so juicy and tender! The slider buns look thick but they were so soft that it complimented the juiciness of the pork. The ribs were rich with sharp flavor--salty at first, but making you want to have another big bite. The Satay, I felt, was pretty average. \n\nTo drink, I had the E&Old Fashioned ($6). Wow. Strong. The orange zest was definitely sharp and gave it that zing that I appreciate in an old fashioned. \n\nOverall, E&O is definitely on the top of my list for happy hour drinks and bites.

I also appreciate when the waiter is knowledgeable about the menu and is comfortable providing recommendations. We ordered pretty much all recommended dishes: green papaya and cucumber salad, Indonesian corm fritters, butternut squash dumplings and grilled steelhead. This was just the right amount for two to share.  \nWe usually ask for dressing and sauces on the side to well, you know, make it healthier.  But these were so flavorful that I think I ended up using almost every drop.  Especially the curry sauce for butternut squash dumplings. I think I was ready to lick the bowl ;)\nOne negative was the \"speed\" - i felt that they were bringing out the food way too fast, I felt a little rushed.  The restaurant was only half full, so I really don't see a point in rushing customers. I also understand complains about the potion size - it's more of a \"small plate\" place, so I would suggest about 2-3 dishes per person.  \n\nI definitely want to come back and try more.

Plus how often do you find a Saturday happy hour?! It does get busy on weekdays so catching your server can take a while (it can be nearly impossible right before 6 p.m. on a Friday), but there's surprisingly few people on Saturdays.\n\nI had a better experience at the bar versus sitting down at a table because you get better service. I love the bartenders, who go out of their way to make you a yummy drink, and they're super nice and personable. The blushing geisha is also absolutely delicious if you're into more tart or sour drinks (and you can't go wrong with tequila!).\n\nMy favorite happy hour dish is the squash dumplings--the curry sauce is delicious and the $1/dumpling price during happy hour seals the deal. I've also had the oysters (also just $1 each!), the tuna tartare, and the chicken skewers, and everything tasted fantastic, but I always go back to my dumplings.\n\nI've recommended this place to so many people, and everyone has fallen in love. On top of the great food, I love that it's a very casual place with a classy and intimate atmosphere.\n\nEvery time I visit SF in the future, I already know I'll be putting aside a couple of hours to stop by for a drink and a plate full of dumplings.", "author": "Queenie T."}

The atmosphere is classy and most people are fairly dressed up, though they aren't snobby about it. It's a fairly big space, able to accommodate a wide variety of party sizes.\n\nBut enough about the place, let's talk about the food. My friends and I came by after work on a weekday and ordered food to share. Here's what I thought of everything:\n- Indonesian Corn Fritters: These were pretty tasty and came sprinkled with some light spices. Deep-fried on the outside and kind of chewy on the inside, I actually thought the texture took a little bit of getting used to, but once I did, I enjoyed the fritters a lot. Definitely something you want to share because I'm not entirely sure I'd want to eat a whole one of these by myself. (There are 2 of these.)\n- Beef and Short Rib Sliders: Tender, marinated beef sliders. They come with thinly-sliced taro chips which are very delicious (not your average potato chips!) but kind of hard to pick up. (There's 3 of them and they're really cute! Unfortunately, that also means they're kind of tiny... )\n- Butternut Squash Dumplings: These were very good - soft and chewy with sweet butternut squash filling. The curry was flavorful but not overwhelming and paired surprisingly well with the dumplings. (There are 5 of these.)\n- Japanese \"Bop\": The sunny-side up egg pairs with the pickled vegetables nicely, and is served on top of something that kind of resembles a fried rice cake. I know that doesn't sound very appetizing, but it's really, really great.\n\nAsian Fusion is all about combining unexpected flavors, and E&O does a good job of this. Ingredients seem fresh, high-quality, and well thought out. Service is fine but not fantastic, but I do appreciate that they let us hang around for a bit longer after dinner without trying to kick us out. Good place to go with your \"classy\" friends to grab drinks and small plates to share after work.", "author": "Brittany C."}

This a BIG restaurant - with bar seating, downstairs dining room, as well as a South and North mezzanine for private events. Our networking mixer took place in the North Mezzanine. It was a nice secluded spot, far enough away from all the loud bar/dining room noises. The happy hour mixer we attended included our own private bar/bartender (they were serving beer/wine/Prosecco). But what surprised me the most was the high quality of the passed appetizers. At most of these networking events, you're lucky if the restaurant has a cheese/charcuterie plate and a few olives to nibble on. Not the case at E&O! Au contraire, mon frere! Guests were treated to a generous variety of signature bites, including: the deep fried corn fritters + dipping sauce, chicken + beef satay, mini-risotto balls, and some other tasty Asian-inspired apps. Everything was delicious. I can't imagine that anyone left this party with an empty stomach. Service was also top-notch (everyone from the bartender to the wait-staff). These guys really nailed it!\n\nIf you're looking for a good, centrally located restaurant near Union Square to host a private affair (whether it be work or personal), E&O is a fantastic option. \n\nBonus: there's convenient parking a few doors down at the Sutter/Stockton Garage!", "author": "Kevin B."}

He walked us to our table which was occupied by a couple of our parties (the guys were at the bar watching the big playoff game).   You can see the entire kitchen along the back wall; it is open space and kind of fun to watch.  \n\nOn to the food:\n\nAppetizer - Indonesian Corn Fritters:  3/5.  Yes, I read the reviews and just about everyone suggested these corn fritters.  They were interesting but however, it did not have the \"wow\" factor. I thought this was a bit bland.  What's all the hype about? \n \nAppetizer - Tea Deviled Eggs: 3/5.  Um....$2.25 for half an egg?  I can get a whole carton of those at Costco for that price!  Worth trying once, but not again.  The presentation was there, unfortunately the taste wasn't. \n \nMain dish - Beef short rib sliders: 3/5. Taro chips were so addicting!  The beef was tender and juicy, but the pickled veggies ruined the flavor.  It tastes like expensive westernized banh mi.  \n\nMain dish - Beef Toppoki: 3/5.  My friend ordered this dish and I took a few bites.  The rice cake is smaller than the traditional size so it's more bite-sized.  It was cooked well so not too soggy nor hard from overcooking.  The beef was also very tender and flavorful.  However if you are Korean and used to the spicy toppoki, then this might be a little funny to you since you wont get the fish cake or the spice.\n\nMain dish - Koda Farms Heirloom Rice Stir-Fry: 2/5.  Couldn't take more than two bites of this.  My friend who ordered did not like it at all.  For me it was bearable, but I would never get this again.  Had a funny taste to it.  \n\nIf you want rice, you have to order that as a side.....really?? You can't just include your dishes with rice?  Um, no thank you.  This place is overpriced for what you get.  The food is average.  They have a good selection of wine.\n\nThe only good thing about this restaurant is the service and ambiance.  I may or may not be back.....but most likely not.", "author": "Erica C."}

I'd been once before, maybe 10 years ago, and was  little worried because the ratings seemed to have gone down. Also, it was easy to get in on Saturday night with only an hour advance notice (OpenTable), after all the other places we'd picked first turned out to be fully booked.\n\nBut WOW.\n\nEverything here was amazing. Our waitress (wish I knew her name) was spectacular, even working extra hard to accommodate a food sensitivity. My butternut squash dumplings appetizer were amazing -- would have eaten a whole bowl of them for dinner. Others at the table shared oysters. There was some discussion about what kind they were, evidently not what was normally available, but my oyster-loving friends said they were perhaps the best they'd ever tasted anywhere. For entrees, we split the dry rubbed chicken and the black cod. Both were beyond awesome. For dessert, we all shared a tiny little mango panna cotta, and I wish I'd had one the size of a watermelon. Just amazing!", "author": "George Y."}

First off let me say that I work at a classy Asian Fusion restaurant in Marin County and know the restaurant business very well and we are NOT RUDE nor PUSHY. We had a larger party of 8 adults and sat upstairs.  It would 20 minutes to get water to our table, given we had to ask.  After staring at our server for several minutes and he dodging our eye contact he finally came over to the table.  He said he \"missed our table.\" After ordering drinks and food everything started to come out in random orders.  Our drinks took 15 minutes to arrive (we didn't order cocktails). With the odd order of food coming and lack of service we tried the food.  The food was very good! Unfortunately the service was lacking.  One of our party guests ordered a martini. It came in a weird sherbet glass with about 1.5 oz of alcohol.  Two dished failed to come out, and our plates were cleared and given dessert menus.  The server then asked if we wanted our food... the kitchen and server was disorganized.  We spoke to the manager about the martini just to let him know the glass was odd and that we found it lacking.  He didn't offer anything, but he gave us his card for the next time we come back... like we would go back. Anytime someone is nice about a mistake or something like the food not coming out we always offer them a complimentary dessert and an apology.  We got a defensive manager that said \"yelping him\" was mean... Your a restaurant and should strive to provide great service, it is the restaurant business after all. Overall the experience was unfortunate, it could have been all fine if we received better service and treatment from the manager.", "author": "Lilly K."}

We arrived and got seated on time. At the same time they seated party of 3 on our left. We ordered food, waited. I noticed how party on the left got their food, 10 mins passed, 15, we got our appetizers... ok... then we waited almost 30 mins for main dish. It came in huge portions but really blent on spice, potatoes feel a little bit undercooked. Anyways, we only eat about 30-35% and asked server to box it. He had attitude when we asked that. Then we got the dessert. We left restaurant at 9:20. For SF i consider it inefficient timing. When we sat, we ordered the food and drinks in 7-8 mins, no more than 10. It takes an hour for all courses come. Consider we didnt take really long time with main dish at all, we spent 50 minutes just waiting waiting, 25 minutes eating, 10 minutes ordering, and 10 minutes paying and leaving... thats is really long wait time, dont suggest coming for lunch at all, you will be late for work. The wait time need to be cut by 30 minutes to be efficient restaurant in such a big city. And that was Wednesday night... the worth part is i got food poisoning when i got home. All night.

I had the Wood Grilled Burger, which did not disappoint.  The beef was of great quality and seasoned perfectly...it went very well with the pickled onions, kimchee and sriracha aioli...I requested white cheddar cheese which added another layer of richness to the burger.  All the savory flavors were perfectly matched by the scallion bun, which had great texture and subtle flavors to compliment the interior of the burger.  The togorashi fries were also very good and almost cleaned the palate with the quality flavor from the potatoes and slight kick from the spices.\n\nBesides the burger, I also had an off-menu item: \"Secret Fries\".  These special fries, which haven't yet been made quite so public, were incredible - probably the most inventive fries I've come across: a bed of perfect potato fries topped with kimchee, sriracha aioli and cheddar cheese - wow!  This was almost a meal on its own since it was hearty and full-flavored...similar flavors to the burger, without the meat (although, I'm sure you can request these with bacon or short ribs if you wanted them).  This would make for the perfect starter item at a table or something to munch on while you enjoy cocktails.\n\nI enjoyed E&O before, but I love it now.  All the changes they made were great.  The interior of this restaurant has been updated to a sleek and modern look, but is still comfortable and inviting.  There seems to be more space and one feels less cramped in there compared to the previous set-up.  The staff was friendly and attentive and I always felt like I was taken care of.\n\nFor anyone who enjoyed the previous space and restaurant, you will love the new look and menu at E&O.  They really took the best ingredients from all over Asia and created a unique and flavorful menu that anyone can enjoy.  Their famous corn fritters and short rib sliders are still on the menu so even with the new, you can still enjoy your old favorites.", "author": "Ken G."}

Snarky attitude. We made the mistake of sitting in the dinning seats near the bar during 'happy hour' and she informed me we had to leave the table in an hour since happy hour will be over in an hour. She must have forgotten she works in a service industry. Telling a customer to leave is probably not what management would like their 'hostess' to tell customers. She didn't know that we would not be staying for dinner or planning to order few more drinks. We moved over to the proper bar area to get away from her. People that work in service industry should leave the attitude at the door and do the job they are hired to do.\n\nResponse to question from E&O\nThis was my second visit to the restaurant. My first visit was lunch with a co worker. My second visit was happy hour on my date and we both do not plan to be back.", "author": "Mab Q."}

The space is gorgeous, and I loved how they moved all the tables and chairs - it really opened the place up.  For the event we had the following:\n\n-Corn Fritter - waste of calories, sadly.  I had one piece, and didn't care for it for the rest of the night. It was really nothing to write home about and was greasy frankly.\n\n-Chicken Satay - chicken breast was dry and not enough satay sauce. It was one dimensional. \n\n-Spicy French Fry Boats (forget the actual name) - how can you go wrong with french fries? You can't! They were good, but again they were more fries and sauce than anything else. I believe there was supposed to be toppings? \n\n-Banh Mi Sliders - best item of the night. These sliders rocked my taste buds off my tongue. They had a nice savory, sweet and salty combination. The picked vegetables married well with the shredded pork.  It was a decent portion too.  I would say that the sliders increased this rating from a 2 start to a three star.\n\nNeedless to say, based on the yelp event, I would not return as a paying customer.", "author": "Vanessa K."}

Wouldn't have predicted given the ingredients.. and I'm a huge ginger fan as well.\n\n~~FOOD~~\n* Fries - 4 stars\nI'm not sure why everyone seems to discount these fries. Maybe I ate one of the very first batch that came out, which were really warm and fresh. I thought they were awesome - crisped just right, warm but with a crunch, and the scallions added a nice fresh zest.\n\n* Corn fritters - 4 stars\nThe fritters were sweet, the breading crunchy and crisp, the dip intense and savory. \n\n* Chicken satay - 3 stars\nDry! Way too dry. The sauce was really watery too, which was difficult to handle when it's a starter being passed around with no plates to eat off of.\n\n* Beef sliders - 3.5 stars\nNot bad, the meat was tender and the sauce good. Just wish there was more of the actual meat. The buns were a little on the dry side, the outside was buttery and slightly toasted but it should have been toasted a little more to get a good crisp.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

We started out with deviled tea eggs, papaya salad and fried calamari. E&O is a combination of Asian foods around the world with a leaning toward Southeast Asian cuisine. Though the papaya salad wasn't the best, both the deviled tea eggs and the fried calamari was incredibly flavored. Our Pad Thai also turned out to be somewhat of a disappointment, because they mixed in a disproportionately large amount of filler items--tofu, pickles, shrimp, etc. to noodles, and because it tasted heavily doused in soy sauce. Our side dishes of brussel sprouts and eggplant saved the main meal. When dessert rolled around, we were all craving something sweet because of the saltiness of the Pad Thai.\nI finished my meal with the coconut pandan ice cream which they topped with a large very gingery ginger cookie.

The pupu platter (for two) has all the highlights of the bar menu (sans the squash dumplings). Once when I came in a group of three, they easily added another portion onto the platter.

I don't know what it is about San Francisco but people aren't that nice. Show up, asked if we had reservations followed by it's a 30 minute wait I can wait in the lounge area and have some drinks. 2 other parties there were eating and drinking. Finally 35 minutes later a server approached us if we wanted a drink which at this point our table should be ready soon so we declined. I notice the hosts approach the party who arrived 25 minutes after us with also no reservations telling them they're table will almost be ready. So of course that's when I ask about our table and we are finally seated with a few empty tables in the back. So why did I wait 45 minutes? To cut to the chase our actual server didn't make it better. Ran out of water during dinner, never got a refill till I asked for one once we were done eating along with the check.

I would say that the menu has some high aspirations but I have had some more creative and flavorful dishes elsewhere. They really do try and the service is excellent. The open kitchen is cool to sit by and watch the chefs do their magic. Overall it was a pleasant night. I would probably go again but might be more interested in trying something new.

We came in around 7pm and a shorter guy at the front desk showed us to our table in the back.  We waited about 15 minutes before our waiter came over to the table.  He was an older white guy with glasses.  He didn't really say hello and asked what we wanted to drink.  We figured the service was not going to be quick or good, so we ordered our appetizer and meals at the same time.  About 10 minutes later, our waiter brought us our beers, but gave the wrong one to each of us.  He walked away.  About 10 minutes later, another guy brought us our appetizer (Chicken Satay).  It was good but not worth the price.  We then waited, waited and waited some more.  About 20 minutes later, our server came by and asked if we had received our main dishes (2 Pad Thais) in which we told him we hadn't.  He checked the kitchen then said they were being made but never apologized for the long wait.  After another 10 minutes, another guy brought the dishes.  The Pad Thai was pretty good.  Our waiter never came and checked on us.  We had to ask another guy for boxes.  Our waiter came back and put dessert cards on the table to which we told him we didn't want any and wanted the bill.  He brought the bill and never said thank you or anything.  This was our second to last night in San Francisco for our honeymoon and it was the only experience that we want to forget.  We told our Concierge about our awful experience and he said he was very sorry that he suggested this place to us for dinner and will not be recommending it to future guests.

The Beef Toppoki seemed like the chef couldn't wrap his head around what type of fusion he was going for. It was like a mish-mash of different ingredients in one, that didn't work well together. An interesting take on gnocchi, but executed poorly. And the meat was chewy.

My boyfriend and I decided to come here for the second time because of the amazing experience we had previous to this one. \n\nAs soon as we arrived it was as we expected, busy and had a wait, the hostess we encountered was such a sweetheart and accommodated us as best as she could.  She offered us to have a seat at the bar until they had an available table. She even came back to check up on us and said we would be seated shortly. We were planning to just have dinner at the bar, which we wouldn't have mind, but as soon as we tried to order our drinks the bartender that was working that night had a bit of an attitude he came up to us and asked if we were ready to order. And I haven't decided yet. I ignored the hint of rudeness in his voice and thought okay he is just busy. But then I saw him roll his eyes and walked away. The second time he approached me he said very firmly \"Are you ready to order now?!\" And placed my order. \n\nGood thing as soon as we got our drinks we were seated at our table. Our waiter was so nice and made up for the rude experience we had at the bar, we ordered our food and few more drinks afterwards. Food was good, and was presented beautifully. \n\nBUT, as soon as we got our bill our fairly good experience went down hill, we paid in cash, we waited for about 15- 20 mins to get our change. It was towards the end of the night and they were closing very soon so we just patiently waited. Then when we finally received our change it was SHORT! And I'm not talking about a few dollars short but $30 short! \n\nI'm glad we have the habit in counting our change! And to top it off they left us no receipt in the holder along with our change! So we tried to get the attention of our waiter but we felt we were purposely ignored because he even walked by us and acted as if he didn't hear us.. Finally when he came and asked us what was wrong we told him that he gave us the wrong change and that it was short $30, he apologized and pulled out a stack of cash from his apron and handed us our exact change. \n\nI understand we had a few drinks but we weren't oblivious to what was going on. At first we gave him the benefit of the doubt thinking it was late and he probably had a long day and it could have been an honest mistake, but as we were walking out we realized he didn't even go to the register to try to fix our transaction and just handed us cash from his pocket of his apron.. \n\nHmm.. A little suspicious if you ask me! Hopefully, it was an honest mistake and we weren't being taken advantage of since our age group was a lot younger than the rest of the crowd the was there that night. \n\nBut thank you to the very kind hostess that evening!

Staff were very attentive and service was quick enough, although the multiple dishes we ordered came out one at a time, and the last one arrived well after we had finished eating everything else.  That might have been co-ordinated better.  The menu was diverse, with a great selection of Asian- and Indian-inspired favourites.  But I'm sorry to say that all five dishes we ordered were rather bland.  In this type of fare, we expect the zing of garlic and ginger and chilis and the sauces, but there was none of that.  And we think they may have forgotten something as simple as the salt!  The corn fritters were crispy, but whole cumin seeds would have added flavour.  The ahi tuna seemed to be nothing but cubes of tuna with some pea shoots mixed in.  No distinct flavour.  The steak satay was too thick to be cooked properly, and the peanut sauce was flavourless.  The green beans side dish with chilis and garlic should have been the most intensely flavoured, but again, we think they forgot the salt or used a too-light soy sauce.  By the time the pad thai arrived, we weren't expecting much so we weren't surprised that it, too, was bland.  Maybe it's because we cook these dishes ourselves and/or we order them from a lot of different places in our travels, but we'd have to say that we wouldn't go back here again for the food.", "author": "Carly D."}

I'm confused as well. $1 per. \n\nThe spare rib had a delicious flavor but was TOO salty. \n\nThe butternut squash dumpling was surprising. Bite into it, it's all mash. However, the flavor wasn't overbearing. I grew to appreciate that aspect of it. Typically I only go for pork and chive dumplings over in the Sunset, but there was an enjoyable soft, sweet texture to these butternut squash dumplings. And that's just about as far as I can describe a squash flavor.\n\nSlider was just amazing too. What's going on???? I'm not even drunk yet!\n\nTo top it all off, they make a perfect Old Fashioned. \n\nSo yeah, some pretty amazing things have happened since the renovation. Bravo!", "author": "Ethan L."}

The smokey taste in the dipping sauce that accompanied the shrimp sate elevated the dish and showed the attention to detail in the kitchen.

His family uses curry in many unique ways (they made me appreciate and enjoy curry, after believing I hated it) and he loved the kale salad's flavor profile.

While the restaurant decor has been the same, the experience was significantly different.  Last year, my husband and I had a marvelous dinner.  The food actually wowed us, as did the decor and the service.  \n\nSadly, this year, the food was extremely disappointing.  We were actually embarrassed  since we brought friends along.  \n\n-- Shitake Dumplings -- last year, we were wonderfully surprised at how \"mushroomy creamy\" it tasted.  This year, while the food was still beautifully presented with small dried shitakes beside the dumplings, it only tasted of vinegar and something herby, similar to cilantro.  You couldn't even taste the shitakes in it.  Even the sauce was different -- more of the vinegar and probably a thickener like corn starch, and less of the mushroom taste.  \n\n-- Corn Fritters -- Underwhelming.  It certainly looked good; had the delicate taste of corn, but nothing else.  It was actually the sauce that's carrying it, and even then, it falls flat.\n\n-- Dungeness Crab Rolls -- definitely not!  Didn't care for the rolls, and certainly didn't care for the dipping sauce.   \n\n-- Beef Rendang -- I think this was confused with some other types of Thai curry -- this was weak on the Rendang spices (cloves, anise, cardamom), but atypically strong on the kaffir lime.   This could also have been offered as a vegetarian dish as it is very light on the beef, only 20% of the dish is beef, the rest is made up by the potatoes and taro.  It also was very soupy, which is not what you would expect of a Beef Rendang.\n\n--  Crispy Cod Fillet -- this takes the cake.  It was bland!!! The fish was not seasoned and was not crispy.  The sauce was supposed to be muchi curry tartar, but all I can taste of the miniscule amount of sauce underneath, was pure tartar sauce.  Yes it was yellow suggesting turmeric and other spices, but I couldn't taste them!\n\n-- Drinks -- we had the Tombstone, the Sake \"something\", and the Pineapple, Basil, LIme Agua Fresca.  All of them very disappointing!  the alcoholic cocktails were so imbalanced in favor of the booze, mezcal and sake.  while the bartender likely forgot to put in pineapple juice in the agua fresca since all I could taste was lime.  \n\nAll in all, it was a very disappointing, embarrassing, but OVERPRICED experience.

This is a dessert that I daydream about...multiple times a day. It is simply a tiramisu constructed with banana flavors extracted into the cream. I have never tasted anything like it. The natural banana flavor and the traditional tiramisu aspects blend together in such perfect harmony, never with one overpowering the other. \n\nWe ordered the butternut squash ravioli-type appetizer and pad thai. Honestly, the food was mediocre. The unique taste of Asian spices are being overwhelmed by many other unnecessary ingredients. \n\nI will return for the bananamisu and most likely nothing else.", "author": "Priscilla V."}

It is a little expensive though and the place does get really crowded at times so make sure you make a reservation if it's a Friday or Saturday. I suggest you try the corn fritters since it's their signature and their meat platter is awesome too. \n\nHappy hour at E&O is great. They have good beers on tap that are reasonably priced. The ladies seem to really like the cucumber martini. The crowd here varies from the older work crowd to tourist to regulars who live around the area. This is definitely not a dancing type happy hour but more of a classy and chic spot to let time pass and forget about your work week.

We got a second order oft his because it was so good.\n\nThe good:\n- dry fried green beans ($8): the portion was a bit small, but all the right flavours where there and there were some crunchy turnip bits that made the dish fantastically flavourful. \n- matcha green tea affagato ($9): it was creme fraiche ice cream soaked in green tea and a dark chocolate kit kat on the side. Generally creme fraiche is like yogurt, so a bit tangy and sour. Overall it was interesting pairing, though not something I would have regularly.\n\nThe meh:\n- chicken satay ($12): basically four bucks for each skewer. The chicken was a bit dry and not very flavourful. The satay sauce had a slightly strange taste to it, likely the miso and i didn't think it went very well together.\n- indonesian corn fritters ($13): the server recommended this dish saying it's been around for 13 years at the restaurant but it was bland and required the sweet chili sauce to provide it with flavour. The sweet chili sauce was pretty typical in flavour that you can get at any supermarket so the dish was a waste of money.\n- salt and pepper calamari ($15): way too much batter. the flavour was passable but it felt like i was eating hard batter a lot of times.\n- duch imperial roll ($11): not very memorable. it was like a large spring roll with duck fillings and some herbs. I don't remember it tasting particularly good or bad. Not expensive compared to the rest i guess. \n\nThe big disappointment:\n- black pepper shaking beef ( $26): okay the flavour was not that bad, the beef was a little chewy. But at twenty six dollars, this dish is not worth it. It's barely good. it feels like someone cut some beef and added some grocery store canned sauce to it. highly disappointing for the most expensive dish on the menu.\n\nThe ouch:\n- price here is a bit ridiculous.  if you stick with the smaller dishes and appetizers, it might be just on the expensive side. but if you go with their meat dishes, expect your wallet to be broken.\n\nOverall, the prices are too high for the quality of food.

We've both lived in New York City and many other great cities across the country and it was our first time in San Francisco. We were staying in Union Square and looking for something quick to eat nearby our hotel. We discovered E&O online - it looked solid and was close by so we decided to give it a try.\n\nBy far - this was the single worst decision of our entire 2-week California trip. The food was beyond average, and it was almost not worthy of a review. But I had to come on here to give fair warning to everyone else to never go in this place.\n\nWe started with the famous \"corn fritters\"- these were literally giant fried balls of corn kernels that tasted bland and were just completely bizarre. It's almost laughable that this dish is their version of \"creativity.\"\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Drunken Noodles. There was hardly any ground pork in it (which the menu claimed it had) and the vegetables were absolutely awful. This dish literally tasted like it belonged under the \"Asian Cuisine\" section of a Cheesecake Factory menu. Truly one of the worst \"fusion\" noodle dishes I've ever tasted. I ordered the Steak Satay and it was completely average. The meat was far too chewy and the peanut sauce it was served with was entirely irrelevant and didn't mesh with the entree. \n\nPerhaps this place has a decent happy our or appetizer selection, but I can't figure out why it has above a 1 star average rating on Yelp. We were so excited to try the amazing food in San Francisco and were extremely disappointed that this was our first pick. We will NEVER be back here.

Tim also helped us pick the perfect cocktails and his reviews were spot on. I tried the bourbon with lime and it was excellent. Smooth and refreshing at the same time. It must be said that I am rarely a cocktail lover. And the other staff who cleared our table throughout our dining experience were equally stealth. All were gracious. I really recommend dining here.

I called E & O immediately after making a change to ensure they received it (that would be too efficient right?

But he didn't take it well yet he answered: \"we needed pressure to open the oysters and it is normal to have broken shells inside the oysters.\" Then we decided to leave. Broken shells, it's quite acceptable; broken pieces of oysters, it was actually very disgusting.", "author": "Natalie L."}

The name now removed due to \"privacy reasons\" but the name of the Director of Catering at E&O's isn't hard to search for. http://www.eosanfrancisco.com/team/\n\nI was recommended by a co-worker to host a team event at E & O because she had a good experience there dining with her friends. It is the holiday season so I was thrilled that they had an opening for a group of 18. I started to coordinate the event with their Director of Catering through email. She was extremely unpleasant to work with and didn't pay attention to the details. I had an attendee with extreme dietary restrictions and asked to prepare a special menu. I gave her a list of all the allergies and food preferences but she would respond with ideas that I clearly wrote in the email as an allergy. After some back and forth, she asked to speak with the person directly when we arrived on the day of the reservation instead of preparing the menu prior. As an event planner, I wanted to make sure that all the attendees will be enjoying their time so I wanted to make sure the menu was up to expectations prior to their arrival. After a couple days, she presented a menu. I also requested for a vegetarian menu. \n\nWhen we arrived, the party was split into two tables in their upper level dining area. Of course we did not want to be separated. I told the waiter, James, and he was helping us see if we can all fit in one table. He was absolutely wonderful. When the Director of Catering arrived, she didn't introduce herself - she just went to start moving things around. When I said I didn't realize that the tables were going to be separated, she kept saying \"it was on the paper I sent you\". Sure, she was correct but I would've appreciated it if she were to tell me that this was going to be the case especially since this was my first time hosting an event there. Not only that but when I tried to explain, she kept mumbling the same thing \"it was on the paper I sent you\" and was completely dismissive to anything I had to say. Eventually, after some moving around, we were able to be seated at one table because some folks didn't show up. She added a small table at the end for an extra person that would show up later. She was fumbling around and having some trouble with setting it up and I kept hearing her just cuss in the corner. Very professional. \n\nNow onto the food. The appetizers showed up and they weren't great - definitely not worth the price but edible. All the appetizers showed up and the attendee with the dietary restrictions did not even receive his first appetizer. I then asked where are the dishes for the vegetarian attendee and Director of Catering proceeds to tell me that \"he can eat the prepared appetizers that are vegetarian\". I did not pay $75 dollar for my vegetarian guest so that he can eat 2/4 appetizers and one dish of fried rice. I expected a full vegetarian menu and substitutes of what would've been the regular menu. She also said that he can share the dishes that were specially made for the guest with dietary restrictions. WHAT? The vegetarian attendee did not have the same allergies and did not need to eat those dishes. The salad course came, and both of them had a plate of lettuce - i'm not kidding. Pure lettuce. I then told the waiter to grab some croutons because the vegetarian can eat croutons, unlike the other guest. \n\nThe main entrees came and the salmon was flavorless and the chicken was dry. The bak choy and mushrooms didn't even look presentable. Most people barely touched their food. The restaurant's saving grace is that they had alcohol so people can be distracted. \n\nI spoke to Jeremy, the manager in the end. He was able to listen and hopefully really do something about this. Again, James was great to work with. He always came by with a smile and was really accommodating. \n\nIn all, I would never come back and I would not recommend anyone else to plan an event here, especially for this kind of service.", "author": "Sharon H."}

(didn't catch the name) didn't have flavor unless you dipped it in sauce. The duck lettuce wrap was also not flavorful, and the goat cheese and raddish bruschetta wasn't good to me only because I'm not a fan of goat cheese. The bread was nice and crispy and the raddish we as good but mixed with the goat cheese just threw me off. Dinner was served family style, with fried rice, plain rice, fried chicken (that was black o_O), salmon (didn't have much flavor but the mango coconut sauce was good), and I didn't enjoy the vegetable dish either. My only favorite part of the evening was the good service. The bartender made my mom a Cosmo where we requested it to be less alcohol and sweeter. She loved it. And asked for his best cocktail and he made me a Gazebo (pineapple flavored). I had about 4 glasses of those and it was delicious! Everyone at my table even ordered it after tasting mine.

Before we had been seated they had a very lovely waiting area with couches and a waiter offered us small snacks and wine before dinner. The atmosphere in this place is very elegant but not stuck up or pretentious...very modern and I felt very at ease while dining here. \n\nThis review is from it's previous name the E&O Trading Company(before renovations) but they still had the same amazing food in my opinion. There were 2 particular appetizers that i loved, the Ahi tuna and the Indonesian corn fritters!! So good! And we hadn't even gotten to dinner yet. Before long we were laughing and carrying on amongst the clamour of the restaurant and I never felt more at home. The staff was well versed in all the items on the menu and we never had any issues with getting someone to help us if we needed something. Awesome all around.\n\nFor dinner I recommend the pork loin. It's a great take on a classic in my opinion with the grilled bok choy and the fermented black bean sauce. I would definitely go here again. As a matter of fact I am hoping to plan a huge get together here very soon since I work in the city now. \n\nStay safe and eat well everyone.\n\np.s. there are amazing private dining areas for any events you may be planning. Yet again the decor accentuates good taste without being arrogant or pompous.", "author": "Anthony C."}

Another over priced item was the desserts..I asked for 2 scoops of ice cream and it came in a small dip bowl for my kids to spilt. I thought it was a sample scoop to add with the desserts I already ordered b/c it was a this tiny sauce cup. I was charged $7.50! It was just plain Vanilla.

Very good recommendation!\nA party of 6 for our girlfriends birthday, we decided to do it family style. Passing by on Sutter Street, the restaurant blends in very much to its surroundings. Floor to wall windows shows you inside to a long table where you can see customers eating the Asian Cuisine of E&O Asian Kitchen. Step inside to a dim lit setting, with wooden architecture surroundings. The hostess had a reservation for 3 but she easily was able to accommodate 6 of us. We had the long table in the front window, a perfect spot to people watch. \nFor starters, the scallion fried bread with the sauce was amazing. Served warm, it felt more like an Indian dish than an Asian dish, but very good non the less. The corn fritters that are fried, I didn't take much of a liking too. The butternut squash dumplings were one of my favorites. I wish more than a few came on a plate. Amazing. The sauce was good, I thought maybe it needed something more. \nThe beef short rib sliders are very savory. Served with a  side of taro chips, it was a very good balance, very refreshing and just enough room. The chicken lettuce cups we ordered as well. Those are the same as other lettuce cups, nothing special, but fresh- like any other Asian cuisine it would be served in. Now, the black pepper shaking beef was the best dish we ordered on the menu. The meat was cooked just right. Matched perfectly with the side of green beans which were also cooked perfectly and a small side of rice, we gushed over how good it was. It must be good if everyone at the table agrees.\nThe Asian \"Gnocchi\" rice sticks, natural beef filet, cabbage and spicy soy bean sauce was good. The sticks were filling. The Japanese \"Bop\" of crispy dashi kokuho rose rice, spinach, pickles, red chili furkake, bonito flakes with an egg sunny side up on top, was the most Asian dish I had tried there. A perfect fusion, it reminded me of Japan. \nTo celebrate with the birthday girl who is a light drinker, she chose the Dragon's Kiss. Sparkling wine, aperol bitter, blackberry shrub and lemon, perfect and sweet for a darling who loves alcohol you cannot taste. Bubbly. \nAnd to end her birthday, the Devils Food Cake with salted caramel was just the right size for her and made again amazing. Now one of my favorite desserts in the city. \nThe server was ok, nothing to emotionally engage us. She must have been busy. The hostess was gracious. The bathroom is located downstairs with other private dining rooms. Bathroom is very pretty! The stairs going down to the bathroom to the corner makes the ambiance exactly what it needed. \nWill definitely recommend and come back again to try everything.", "author": "Jacqueline L."}

As it declined in quality and was re-vamped several times, I simply stopped going. But I happened to be passing by today and went in on a whim. \n\nThe interior is lovely and a nice modern take on the space. I was seated at a low table with a high-backed chair that resembled a cage between two other single diners, each in their own cage/chair. I'm pretty tall, so it wasn't the most comfortable way to eat, but I went with it. \n\nI ordered the chicken bahn mi. I love a good bahn mi, and the flavors in this one were good but far from great. First, it was served on a doughy sourdough roll which, I believe, is a criminal offense. Second, there was no spice or heat. The sauce on the chicken was good, but the veggies and shrub of cilantro were seriously lacking. No one wants a hefty 4 inch stalk of cilantro slapped on their sandwich. Leaves and delicate stems, please. \n\nOverall the service was good, the decor is nice, but the food I had lacked any specialness and certainly wasn't worth the cost.  \n\nLooks like the glory days of E & O will just have to live in my memory.", "author": "Bonita H."}

They are an expensive pair of sunglasses and she could have kept or sold them but she called me back. She also wouldn't take any money from me when I offered.

Ahi poke was nothing special, wish they had toast or something instead of those flimsy flat thin things to eat the poke with....and a beef dish - but the beef was ehhhh as well.  We had two drinks.

I'd also recommend the corn fritters. The scallion fry bread is just OK -- a bit bland but refreshing with the yogurt. The shaking beef is delish! The beef is filet mignon grade, I think. Sooo good!

I remember having the corn fritters and it was soo good. I decided to try them again but this time, to do the Dine about Town menu. I was a bit early for my 5:15pm reservation. I got my table and waited for my friend to arrive. Choices of sparkling water and spring water was given... I choose spring or still.. whatever.. my waiter.. Victor was very nice and helpful. Had a small chat with him about the changes to the restaurant and food.  Ordered a pear soda..The pear soda was refreshing and tasty. My friends comes along and we order our appitzers... so it's a family style kinda cusine.. which is great since we both are  very familiar with the concept. We ordered the papaya salad and the vietnamese duck rolls. Both very good. Both have a hint of 5 star or maybe it was tumeric, or anise... wait.. ginger..  it was spicy and tasty.. that pear soda was a good drink to have to help with the heat... the entrees we ordered was the Dan Dan Noodles and the Beef Sirloin Steak. \nThe Dan Dan Noodles were soo tasty... but I wish in a restaurant like this.. they dind't just use ramen noodles.. If I wanted instant noodles.. 39cents and Im done.. I don't like it when places do things like that.. it's annoying!  The steak was in my eyes.. too dry and the kim chee was not up to par with what real kim chee tastes like.. When did Kim Chee have onions in it? For dessert we got the Bananamisu and the Mango Panna Cotta. Both deserrts were were amazing.. Loved the service even more. just wish then food was a bit better. I will most likley be back... but probably just the dessert. Oh I almost forgot... the corn fritters were a bust.. not the same as before... no taste.. Sorry E and O.. can you please go back to the orginal corn fritters? Let me know if that ever happens and I'll be back for sure and re-review. :)", "author": "Bobby T."}

Green papaya salad - terrible (soggy, tasteless) Shaking beef - chewy, tasted of old rubber, chicken with a side of salad - unpalatable all together - just to name a few. To finish off the evening, something was burning in the kitchen as we sat in smoke for the last 20 minutes of our meal. Never going  back and had to apologize to our client profusely since he is used to  great restaurants and great service from any restaurant we have taken him to in SF.", "author": "Tatiana C."}

We were overly impressed with the timely service and amazing food!  We first sat down and let them know we were in town for our honeymoon and they immediately brought us two full glasses of champagne on the house.  This really made us feel special.  We ordered many small plates and loved every single dish - the butternut squash ravioli was insane and the BOP was by far one of my favorite dishes we ate while in the city!!  We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone!!", "author": "Haley H."}

UNFORTUNATELY, we will NOT be going back after our recent experience.  We sat for 10 minutes without menus and had to physically get out of our seats 5 times to get service for our group during the evening.  We had to ask more than once for everything.  We basically saw our waitress when she took our order and then to bring us our bill.  We never received a couple of the things we ordered.  After speaking to the manager Chris, he tried to rectify the situation with free desserts.  However, we then had to go retrieve dessert menus ourselves after waiting 20 minutes.  We then ordered 5 orders of ice cream/sorbet.  When the complimentary servings came, we received one plate with 3 scoops of chocolate ice cream and four INDIVIDUAL 1 inch by 1 inch scoops of sorbet for the others.  Frankly, it was extremely insulting.  It is such a shame that this place is going to crash and burn with its poor service and management.", "author": "Traci M."}

The sliders were bland and cold, the black cod entree was enough of a portion for a four year old and yet underwhelming, the kids had the Dan Dan noodles which were completely tasteless. Never again.  Want a refund.", "author": "Roy H."}

We had an amazing experience. The decor is beautiful, very exotic.  We loved the food and had great service. There was a bit if a wait but we didn't have reservations and it was a busy night. I'm so glad I found this spot and send friends here all of the time.", "author": "Brittany H."}
