The Starbucks Pok\u00e9mon GO drink consists of its vanilla bean frappuccino mixed with raspberry and blackberry, and topped with whipped cream. And load up on some pok\u00e9balls and other items as this Starbucks is a pok\u00e9stop. Maybe catch a Pok\u00e9mon or two or three. . . .\n\nA very merry friendly barista greeted me when it was my turn in the queue. He took my order of the Pok\u00e9mon GO Frappuccino and a butter croissant. Unfortunately none of the selections of pastries and other offerings did not sing to me. The barista offered to warm the croissant for me if I wished, and it was quite appropriate considering the weather.\n\nSome of the staff at this Starbucks were unaware of the Pok\u00e9mon GO partnership and were unaware of the recipe. They were surprised this Starbucks branch was a pok\u00e9stop. Fortunately, the barista who took my order was able to help his colleagues find the recipe. \n\nThis branch of Starbucks looks small on the outside, yet when walking inside, it is roomy. And it was not crowded, I found a quiet spot to munch on my croissant, drink my frappuccino, load up on pok\u00e9stops, and play Pok\u00e9mon GO. On my way out, I thanked the barista for his very helpful assistance. I would definitely return to this Starbucks branch the next time I am in the area.", "author": "Chiara A."}

In this particular case, I'm reviewing this Starbucks location out of spite.\n\nTo begin with, the general quality level of Starbucks is my opinion has consistently declined over time. They no longer feel like cafes but more and more like fast food chains.\n\nThis specific Starbucks location was the rock bottom of my Starbucks experience. First, the entire location was nasty. It was as if keeping it untidy was deliberate. Secondly, the staff was totally unfriendly and rude. I understand the lowered bar because of the food chain culture but in this case - using a touch screen would've been a superior experience compared to the cashier who rung me up. Lastly and worse, not only was the staff rude they were incompetent too. I asked for a tall Black and White mocha with no whip cream and twice they gave me the wrong drink. The first instance they gave me a hot chocolate and for the second instance they gave me a black and white mocha with whip cream. To cap it off and after finally handing me the correct drink, the server had the nerve to roll her eyes as if it was my fault.\n\nTo summarize, this was a terrible experience and never again will I step foot at this Starbucks again.", "author": "Jon T."}

Then a customer, who could see how frustrated I was, got to the front of the line and asked Roxanne to please follow up on my order before she placed her own. And Roxanne did not think anything of it. She said it'd be another minute but was ready to take another order. Roxanne- just so you know- you work in an industry where you're probably one of the first interactions a person has with another person on any given day.

I walk in to place my order. A tall young man grabs my coffee thermos and before I say my order, he states \" you want a refill or this is your first time?\" mind you spilling the coffee I had left on himself. Again I have not placed my order. I was probably overcharged to say the least. I attempted to continue my order as he looks at me perplexed. I tell him \" You didn't allow me to place my order, that's rude\" He rolled his eyes. At this point I was finally placing my order, after I got his attention. Are you kidding me? What happened to the customer service. It's more like, let me tell you what you want. The young mans name I believe was Max or Mac. I overheard a co-worker say his name. I later on proceed to talk to the management and the manager on shift thinks it's a joke. Starbucks really? Date of incident Tuesday 13/2016 approx time 11:40 / 12:13pm noon.", "author": "Johny M."}

There's people bringing in their sleeping bags and carts into the coffee shop.  I think it's sweet that they let people come in and rest, but probably also a good idea to keep a close watch to make sure everything is sanitary and safe.  A crazy guy ran out from the bathroom screaming about his asshole and picked up a chair and threw it across the room.  The workers just stood there.  I was literally scared for my life.  Another person sitting there had to stand up and ask the guy to leave.  Wait isn't that the worker's job?  So at least he should get a thank you from the workers right? Nope.  Nothing not even a thank you sir for helping.  Good thing they messed up on my order and I was able to give him my extra drink as a thank you.

I work very close to here so it's an easy stop from BART on the way to the office.   The baristas and cashiers are very friendly and make an effort to remember your name and/or drink.  Some know my drink, others know my name, and some know both!  Personally, just the fact that they remember either one is impressive to me - i mean really: how many people do they serve coffee to every single morning?!  I don't even want to venture a guess, but i know it's got to be incredible. \n\nDue to my special dietary needs, i always order decaf and sugar free.  i would say 98% of the time they are right on it.  There were only maybe 2 instances where it was wrong, but if i don't recognize the person making my drink, or they don't call it out correctly, i'll always double check.  i have NEVER walked out of there with the wrong drink.  (I know this because my blood sugar didn't sky-rocket like it would with the regular syrup, nor was i shaking from any caffeine.)  Once or twice they realized their own mistake and re-did it right away.  (I know it's odd to order decaf in the morning, but i'm sure i'm not the only one, and i can't risk in-taking the caffeine.)\n\nThe line moves pretty fast, and sometimes if they notice me near the front of the line, they'll label my cup so they can start making it while i wait to pay.  My workday can be pretty hectic sometimes, so saving that extra minute or two is much appreciated!\n\nJust yesterday, i tried the 'Bucks around the corner because our offices moved locations and that one is now on the way to the office.  But they felt much slower, not as friendly or peppy, and it just didn't feel the same.  So i will gladly continue to come to this location and take the extra walk around the block.

One of the last times I went, my order didn't get placed correctly. I waited 15 minutes for a breakfast sandwich and when I inquired about where it was from the Batista working the bar, he was very rude and told me to keep waiting. I did and inquired again after a while longer. He told me they were very bust so to just keep waiting. Another employee over heard the conversation and went to look. Turns out, my order didn't get placed. Would have figured that out if he would have looked the first time. \nI went back today after months of not going in, and sure enough the same rude employee was working the register. They were brewing more Pike drip coffee(which is what I ordered.) Instead of telling me it'll be a few minutes while they brew and giving me the option of another blend, he was almost forceful that I take the other coffee, and when I told him I'd wait, he insisted I take something else because it would take 5 minutes to brew. I again told him I'd wait. Not sure why I kept having to tell him that. \nThe rest of the staff is very nice and accommodating. Smiles all around, which is why I don't understand why they have this guy working there. He's not a people person, which is fine, but he shouldn't be working directly with people then.", "author": "Erin M."}
