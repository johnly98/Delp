I had a few places bookmarked but one had a long line and I was on the brink of Hangry so I popped in to Taqueria Cancun. I had noticed the small hole-in-the wall place on my first round of wandering and saw they had a sign advertising breakfast burritos. I'm in. I ended up bypassing the breakfast burrito for an entire breakfast plate (Hangry, remember). It came with scrambled eggs, chorizo, rice, refried beans, and tortillas. It was a large portion of food for $10! You also get free chips & salsa, always a plus. I ended up skipping most of the tortillas although they were really good. The food was super hot and fresh as they cook everything to order on a big flat top.\n\nThe food was definitely filling and comforting after a long flight, but it wasn't particularly flavorful. I ended up using all the salsa on the eggs to kick them up a bit. I did hear someone who requested their food to be spicy, so maybe that's key. The green salsa was amazing! I put it on everything. The guys working were all friendly and the food was done quickly. Note that they are a cash only establishment but they have an on-site ATM.", "author": "Katy C."}

As this is a sketchy part of town I ignored the pan handler outside and stepped in. Taqueria Cancun is your typical Mexican joint serving tacos, burritos, quesadilla, meat plates with rice and beans etc. After going through the menu I decided to get the wet burrito which here is called the Burrito Mojado ($9.25) with Cabeza. When paying I was told that it was cash only so I paid in cash.\n\nI sat on one of the tables that had a sticky surface so kept by elbows off and observed the chef putting my burrito together. It was your standard drill tortilla rice, beans, meat and fold, After he assembled the burrito he placed it in a plastic container and proceeded to heat it up in the microwave. What? This is not done. If I want to have a frozen burrito I'll get one from the freezer section of a super market and heat it up myself. No need to come to a Taqueria. Also don't they know that plastic leaks into the food when placed in a microwave? I knew that this was going to be bad. After heating the burrito in the microwave, I saw the chef throw on some guacamole and sour cream on top which completed this masterpiece. Before leaving I tried to look for a salsa bar but there was none. Instead I found 2 tiny containers with red and green salsa in the to-go container when I reached home.\n\nLet's come to the food. This was one sad looking burrito. It was supposed to be a wet burrito but all that it had was a minuscule amount of red salsa poured on top most of which was just water (see my picture). Anyway after draining the water I dug in. First bite told me that instead of Cabeza they had given me lengua. Now this would not be a problem as I like lengua, but this was the gamiest lengua that I've ever had. It had such a strong smell that I could barely swallow this crap. After a couple of bites I threw in the towel and safely consigned the remaining burrito to the trash can.\n\nBig mistake, I should have taken the pain of walking to Tropisue\u00f1o and got something from there before heading home instead of being lazy and getting something from here. This is an absolute rip off joint that I have no intention of coming back to.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-04", "description": "I walked into Taqueria Cancun my first weekend in San Francisco. My roommate was raving about having to try a proper burrito and this was his favorite spot. As a burrito lover, I look back on that day as a beautiful moment that changed how I rate burritos forever.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've dined at this establishment more times than I can count (and I've only lived in SF for 3-4 months). I had to cut back to once a week because I like to stay healthy and fit and I was probably eating about 3 of these burritos per week.\n\nFOOD: Get the super burrito. Taqueria Cancun has other items on their menu but it might as well not be there at all. They have about 8 different meats to choose from (or vegetarian if you prefer) and I've tried them all. Each is delicious but my go to at this point is Al Pastor. Your burrito will come with chips plus one green and red salsa cup. I prefer the green salsa so now I ask for two green salsa's. I can't speak enough about how amazing the burrito's are here. I grew up on the East Coast and I'll honestly probably never order a burrito when back home ever again. San Francisco Super Burrito's and San Diego California Burrito's have spoiled me. TRY THIS BURRITO! It's the first thing I take any visitors to do. And it's under $10 for a mound of food.\n\nDRINK: Taqueria Cancun offers a good selection of beer, fountain drinks, and water. I'm personally a fan of a Pacifico with my burrito but my buddy gets the soda and really enjoys that too. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Taqueria Cancun has the standard vibe for a taqueria in the Mission. Tables are usually filled with people having conversation and it can get a little loud at times. Plus depending on the time of day the line may be out the door. I promise it's worth the wait. But I've learned when they are and aren't busy from my multiple visits.\n\nSTAFF: I have literally never spoken more than my burrito order to the staff. They are quite and keep to themselves but since they are all behind a counter making food I don't mind nor am I offended. They have consistently made me amazing food so they get 5 stars in my book.\n\nPAYMENT: Taqueria Cancun is cash only. They have ATM's on site.\n\nThere is one location in The Mission and one location in SoMa. Both are awesome and I go to each one regularly. If there is one thing that anyone takes away from my Yelp profile it is to try a burrito at this place!", "author": "Christopher D."}

I ordered a chicken super burrito with no beans (chicken, cheese, salsa, cilantro, sour cream, guacamole, & rice). Taqueria Cancun burritos come with a side of chips & salsa/Verde. I thought the burrito was tasty and filling. I'm a tall guy and I  was stuffed after eating my burrito. All of the ingredients blended well together. Prices were reasonable for most items.

Perfect conditions to stroll on over to the Civic Center location of Taqueria Cancun, purveyors of the best burritos on the planet.\n\nI almost lose my appetite wading through a sea of half-naked panhandlers on Market, but I know the craving will return. It always does.\n\nNo line. Looks like I beat the noon rush! As I enter, I marvel at how the Civic Center location still feels so much like a true authentic Mission District joint. Cramped, dingy, steamy, with a thick layer of solidified burrito essence slathered on every tabletop. Yup, I'll be taking this one to-go. How these places pass health inspection is beyond me, but there is no denying that Taqueria Cancun makes an awesome burrito. \n\n\"Numero veinte!\"\n\nAs I grab my order, I notice the now-substantial line of drooling burrito-eyeing onlookers spilling out the door. I proceed toward the exit, flinging elbows to clear a path. I emerge into daylight, to find the mass of hungry half-naked homeless dudes gathered menacingly before me.\n\n\"Burrito...\"\n\nThey chant in unison, arms outstretched, reaching longingly for my goods.\n\n\"Burrito...\"\n\nTheir eyes reveal an insatiable lust for the foil-shrouded carnitas super burrito within the paper bag laying flat across my splayed left hand.\n\n\"Burrito...\"\n\nChanneling the great Barry Sanders, in one fluid motion I cradle the prize in my right arm, thrust out a vicious stiff-arm that drenches my left hand in mucus and saliva, and spin free from the crowd. I dash into the Civic Center BART station, resisting the urge to spike the football as I cross the faregates in triumph, safe from my burritozombie pursuers.\n\nI descend the broken escalator and hop onto a train as its doors slide shut, locking me into a musty old carpeted car with grungy upholstered seats teeming with penicillin-resistant bacteria. Heart pounding and chest heaving after my close escape, I am forced to inhale the foul air. I barely stave off nausea as the train pulls into Montgomery station.\n\nI finally arrive at the office, thoroughly disinfect myself in the washroom, and head to the lunch room. Ahhhh...alone at last with my Taqueria Cancun carnitas super burrito, which by now has marinated for an extra 30 minutes. I savor every bite of the moist, tasty masterpiece while daydreaming of my next adventure through burritozombie-infested lands.\n\n\nMorals of this story:\n- A tightly-wrapped burrito sitting in its own juices for half an hour is a glorious thing. Just make sure they don't fake the juice by splashing salsa-water into your burrito, as that will destroy the integrity of the tortilla. No worries at Taqueria Cancun, where you'll get a legitimately moist burrito that won't fall apart or get overly soggy.\n- Consider using TaskRabbit to avoid the burritozombie apocalypse on Market Street and all the germs that downtown SF has to offer. Just don't shake hands with your delivery dude.\n- Minus two stars for ambience, dropping from six stars to four. Geez, this place is so disgusting that I'd actually go into the Mission District for cleanliness.\n- Few places have the power to restore your appetite after the unpleasant nastiness described above.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-05", "description": "Despite the decidedly off-putting first picture that yelp has for this place (the homeless people in front of the restaurant), and despite the fact that this picture is 100% accurate for 90% of the time in front of this place, do yourself a favor: hide your valuables, brave this rather shady area of the city, sidle past the homeless people, bring some cash (it's cash-only), and get some food at Taqueria Cancun. To go, of course. Don't sit in there. I'm told that people sometimes get hassled by the local flavor for money while sitting in the place. \n\nYes, it is not the cleanest looking place. In fact, it is probably one of the dirtiest looking places that I continue to frequent. Dirty in appearance only- I've never had problems with the food. The smell of the cooking meats as I walk by the place drown out the less pleasant smells in the 6th and Market area. The meat smells downright amazing. \n\nI've had a few things here. Most often either the burrito mojado (wetback burrito) with carne asada or the super tacos with carne asada. As you can see, I love the carne asada here. I love carne asada in general, but especially here. It's perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked and perfectly cut up. It really is perfect. I've gotten carnitas once, having succumbed to the peer pressure of people constantly talking up carnitas as a general matter. But I actually don't love pork, aside from bacon. The carnitas were not bad, and if they're your thing, you'll probably like it. But as for me, it needs to just be all carne asada all the time. \n\nThe first time I ordered the burrito mojado, I looked at the sign and thought it was a joke. Seriously, wetback burrito? Isn't wetback a derogatory term? I was very uncomfortable with saying \"I'll have the wetback burrito\" so instead I just said \"I'll have the burrito mojado,\" but in confirming with me, they said in English \"oh, the wetback burrito?\" I was taken aback, but it seems like they have a sense of humor about this sort of thing, so I like it. Anyhow, the burrito mojado is huge and deliciousness. The beans, rice, sour cream, cheese, meat, guac all go together perfectly. I daresay it is like a symphony of flavors. I usually turn it into two meals nowadays, forcing myself to stop at a reasonable point rather than try to fit the whole thing in my stomach. That I cannot fit this entire burrito into my stomach in one sitting is one of my greatest life failures. \n\nThe super tacos are essentially the burrito mojado in an open, smaller form. They're also huge. I usually will just get one if I'm not too hungry, and will get two if I am hungry but usually can only get comfortably to 1.5 super tacos. \n\nThe food is super cheap. The burrito mojado is about $6 and the super tacos are about $3 each. \n\nFrom time to time, they have horchata. All Mexican restaurants should have horchata. Horchata is the best! They also have the strawberry Jarritos, which is my favorite one. Though lately, I haven't seen the strawberry one, which makes me sad as I really love it. \n\nTwo things I don't like about this place. They don't make their own chips- the tortilla chips are store-bought. I also don't like the red salsa that they give with the complimentary chips. They give a little container of red salsa and a little one of green salsa. The green salsa is fantastic and I would drink it if it were socially acceptable to drink salsa. The red kinda looks like tomatoes that have been sitting around and out in the open for a while. Kinda tastes that way too...  They're happy to give you more salsa if you request it though. \n\nThe staff are so genuinely nice and friendly. The wait is never too long for the food once you've ordered, though sometimes there is a significant line during peak lunch times. \n\nDefinitely my go-to Mexican place in the city.", "author": "Jia min C."}

The sour cream was the runny kind and on it laid a few large slices of yellow onion and tomato. The super burrito was good too, we got one with regular pollo. It was maybe even better the next day.

The first thing you notice is that the place is pretty dumpy, but i decided to stay because a friend raved about the food. The super burrito i ordered was cheap and huge, but just OK. They put way too much cilantro in it and i had to spend several minutes picking large chunks out of my burrito.  As everyone else has mentioned- the chips and salsa totally suck.\n\nI decided to venture inside for a burrito again today and, unfortunately, left empty handed. The guy who took my order was rude and dismissive right off the bat. I ordered a super burrito to go, which he apparently wrote down as a super taco, not to go. After noticing that he charged me too little i double checked my order: At which point he proceeded to argue with me about what i wanted for several minute. Finally i said, \"You know what, i'm gonna go somewhere else. Give me my money back.\" And he wouldn't!! He kept arguing with me about it! I actually had to reach over the counter and grab back the $20 i had handed him. It was ridiculous.\n\nIt's nice that the food is cheap, but after experiences like this it becomes abundantly clear that you get what you pay for. From now on, i'll shell out the extra 2 bucks for a super burrito at the AMAZING Taqueria Mana on Stockton!", "author": "A. M."}

There's not much of a crowd in the evening due to the crummy 6th & Market location. The place still seems grimey, and you can usually tell what the person who was seating at your table just had.\n\nThe pluses are (1) authentic Mission-style burritos, (2) cheap prices, (3) beef tongue and beef head for the adventurous - though I'm sticking to the carne asada, and (4) cheap, tasty, greasy corn quesadilas with white queso oozing from every bite. In fact, I think I love their corn quesadilas more than their burritos.\n\nIt's not the best burrito in the City (at least at this location), and you'd probably get better food at Tu Lan a couple doors down, but it's a good option for SOMA/Civic Center Mexican.", "author": "Timothy O."}

Knowing how these nights tend to go, I had a feeling that liquid dinner wouldn't be sufficient for me, so I started attempting to make a plan to find some food.  After being told that there was nothing decent for several block in any direction at that hour, a couple of us set out to disprove the wisdom of the crowd.  Two sketchy blocks later, we saw Taqueria Cancun.  It was our only hope.\n\nWe walked in, and lively Mexican music was blaring.  It was a little intense.  Ordinarily, I would probably not choose to actually stick around here and eat, but sitting in UN plaza at 10PM didn't seem like a good idea, and I'm pretty sure Mr. Smith's won't let you have burritos down on the dance floor, so we suffered through the music.\n\nFor the time and place, the burrito was heaven.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-02-06", "description": "For some reason, a lot of people seem to rate this place and/or its sister locations on Mission as \"Best of the Bay?\"\n\nI have eaten at this Market Street hole-in-the-wall location three or four times now, including once with a friend, who first introduced me to the place.  Each time I was hoping that the experience and the food would be better than the last time and live up to those \"Best of the Bay\" accolades.  \n\nSo anyway, I keep giving this place another chance.  But I've been disappointed every time.  This last time, I wandered in on a cold Monday night around 7 pm.\n\nStrangely, I was  followed by a homeless woman begging for money.  She would not stop hassling me for money, even as I stood waiting to order at the counter.  \n\nApparently, she thought I was an \"angel.\" Whatever gave her that idea is beyond this mortal coil. She pleaded for money and kept staring into me hoping to connect into me on some level. But I just wasn't going to fall for that again, as I've done in the past several times by giving a dollar or two away to beggars just to get them to go away and leave me be.\n\nSo finally, the cashier got impatient waiting for me to order and forced her out -- and even then only after she had harassed two more customers sitting down to eat!\n\nWhen I did finally order a vegetarian burrito with no sour cream to see if it tasted any good without being drowned with sour cream like I noticed a lot of the other food being served.  \n\nFiguring I had escaped from the \"Night of the Living Dead\" street theater show known as San Francisco's Market Street, I decided to sit down and eat.  But the cashier instead stuck my food in a bag to go, fully expecting me to leave as if it was my fault the homeless zombie-lady came in after me to beg for money.\n\nIn any case, I decided to sit down and eat the burrito while it was still warm.  After opening it up, I found there to be little or no vegetables in the \"vegetarian burrito.\"  The tortilla was dry, toasty off the grill and crunchy, but inside was just a little bit of pinto beans, some cheese , salsa fresco and avocado.  There was also lingering after-taste of seafood from the grill on my burrito -- most likely a fish taco or something else that was on the grill with my tortilla. Also, the free chips were a bit on the burnt side, too.  \n\nSuffice it to say, this was the last time I will be eating at this Market Street location.  Though I was hungry -- and almost anything you eat when you're hungry usually tastes good this time it left me with a strange vibe.  And I usually love almost any burrito I eat, especially when I'm hungry.\n\nI feel it isn't worth the hassles to eat at a place no matter how good others say the food is or how cheap the eats are.  I'd say you might even be better off just going to that franchise burrito place in the San Francisco Center food court.  Either way, you're taking your chances on the food quality and service.", "author": "Ed M."}

You cannot trick me with filler, Burrito God!\nSo, I went into Cancun and ordered right after I knocked the toothpick box into a bucket of horchata. The toothpicks didn't spill, but the cashier looked peeved as he fished the box out, even as I apologized profusely. I only laughed a little bit. \nI ordered a vegetarian burrito without rice \"all beans\", apologized again, and took my burrito. Now, I realize that maybe I was being punished by the Cancuners for defiling their horchata, but the burrito had about a tablespoon of beans, and half a cup each of sour cream and onions. No cheese. No guac. Super soggy. I don't think they usually even put onions in their burritos! Maybe the pico de gallo was just onion-heavy that night? Regardless, I think it was the worst burrito I have ever had in my life. I had to add canned refried beans when I got home.\nI am willing to accept that my naughtiness might have caused my bad experience, but now I will have to go to the place next to the Arrow bar...\"Chile Verde\" or something.

Pancho Villa was ok, but I always felt like I was missing out on something  and there was never enough cheese in my burrito (though I'll admit that I do like a lot of cheese). Taqueria San Jose was just... wow, amazingly uninspiring.\n\nYeah, the neighborhood isn't great, but it's close to the BART station and I'm sure there are plenty of reasons why you'll find yourself around here (although if you happen to be in the Mission, by all means, go to one of the two locations there). The burritos and tacos are a great value ($4.50 for a burrito, $5.50 super), but are never skimpy or lacking. The start off the tortilla is grilled, not steamed. The meat is juicy and tastily grilled with plenty of flavor. The meat is complemented well by the grilled onions (I'm not a fan of onions most of the time and would never eat them raw, but don't skip them here) which really help to bring out the grilled flavor of the meat. The cilantro is a subtle accompaniment that doesn't overshadow as it so easily can. The beans and rice are both great and the cheese is gooey and plentiful. The avocado is a bit skimpy and while it's present, the flavor isn't very upfront, but I've never found this to be a problem. Plus extra credit for using avocado instead of guacamole. I take mine without sour cream and salsa so no comments there.\n\nSome people claim that the salsa served with the chips is too spicy, but I've honestly never noticed. I'm a complete wimp for most salsas and order my buffalo wings mild or medium at the most, but I never found either salsa to be particularly spicy. The salsa verde might be a bit more potent than usually encountered, but not much. Perhaps they  have slightly changed things as most of the complaints about overly-spicy salsa seem to be a bit older. While both are acceptable, neither is outstanding. In this regard Pancho Villa proves why they have all those state fair salsa awards on their walls.\n\nIn the end I have some more places on my list to try, but at present this is my pick for the best taqueria in the city.", "author": "Mark S."}

After having recently moved back to the city and been again, I can still say this place has the best veggie burritos. They do them nice and simple here--no tofu or soyrizo--just great beans (I prefer whole pinto, although they also have black and refried), rice, big chunks of avocado (way better than guacamole in a burrito), onion, cilantro, salsa, and cheese and sour cream (which I leave off), along with chips and 2 kinds of salsa. You will get stuffed silly for $5 and change; the burritos are enormous. One more thing, do yourself a favor and also get an agua fresca; they're delish (cantaloupe is my fave). While this location attracts a lot of transients as it's right on Market at 6th, nothing bad can be said about the food.", "author": "Paula L."}

If you can make a good salsa, then usually the food will be good too. This place has some yummy spicy salsa and delicious quesadillas.", "author": "Lucy G."}

Some don't like venturing past those po' homeless folks....gee, the nerve of people to want money......but really......the burritos are worth it.  I got in there at 8:57 in the morning, the door was open, and asked for the vegetarian burrito.  I was told no, they weren't open till 9.  Silly me, thinking coz the door was open they were open.  Why would a bidness that had its door open actually be open?  What a gross logical fallacy on my part.  Anyway, the burrito itself was fantastic.  Tortilla was toasted just nicely, everything just sort of melted together in the burrito.  Really, I dunno what else to say.  And their horchata is very nice too (cinnamon rice drink...I recommend it anywhere....actually good at the AM/PM).  Anyway, and you get chips and some hot-ass green salsa (make sure you have some napkins too, if you glisten...uh huh, that wasn't sweat....no, I just um, got out of the gym) like me.   Everything was good.  A fantastic veggie burrito for $3.95 and horchata for only $1.25.  I call that a good day.  Well, at least a good start to a day.", "author": "Todd C."}

I ordered the Carnitis Super Burrito, and was stunned at the size of the creation. Mind you, I didn't have any trouble at all finishing it, since it was so good. The place is tiny, and I wish they had a soda machine, but besides that is a great cheap filling meal.", "author": "Darin E."}
