The filling has always been nice and cheesy and the crust (more bread like) super flavorful. We always order two mediums and have enough left over the next day or two. \n\nWe have also ordered regular pizzas before, which I thought were fine, but the calzones are definitely the star of the show.  Note I am definitely not a pizza snob and I don't understand the appeal of a New York style pizza (which seems to be the main focus of a stereotypical pizza snob). So if New York style pizza is your thing, this review is probably useless to you.", "author": "Angelito R."}

A side of bolognese sauce to dip our bread in. \n\nWell, let's start with the alfredo. It was milk. There was no consistency to it, no flavor at all. The gnocchi was over cooked. 2 bites and it was tossed. Lasagna Della Casa was just lasagna noodles tossed in a pan covered in sauce and cheese. It was not built like lasagna, and no flavor there either. \n\nThe bolognese was a joke. It tastes like canned hot dog chili.  \nThe garlic bread was the best part of this meal and it wasn't that great.  Way to much rosemary seasoning. Hey, at least it was seasoned, right?! \n\nSo, our dinner is in the trash and we will be dining elsewhere tonight. \n\nUnless you want to be disappointed,  I wouldn't recommend this place for their pastas.", "author": "Ashley W."}

My husband swears that it came from a box stuffed in the back of a freezer somewhere. The dough was super thick and doughy. And it wasn't quite cooked all the way through. And it was completely flavorless. It was like eating a really thick cardboard. Horrible. The salad was decent, but that's about it. \n\nGranted, I am an East coast pizza snob and have yet to find great pizza in SF.

It's more of a topping-blended-into-the-melted-cheese-and-incorporated-into-the-pizza kind of style, and it's freaking delicious.

The guy offered his apologies, \"Sorry man. Another customer literally wanted to fight me.\" This is supposed to inspire confidence? Apparently they'd delivered the wrong order to someone else and got into a spat over it.\n\nI ordered everything that was not a pizza but still terrible for you. Beef tortellini. Jalapeno poppers.

This one falls into the second category.\n\nIt was about 8PM, we were hungry, so I pulled a menu I had from this place, which I had not tried before, and thought, let's give it a shot. We ordered the following items -- their menu price is listed after the item:\n\nLasagna della Casa (8.95)\nGarlic Bread (2.29)\nAntipasto Salad (5.49)\nHot Wings (4.99)\nMedium Calzone + 3 toppings (11.99 + 1.25 x 3 = 15.74)\n\nOkay math wizards -- adding in the 9.5% sales tax means the grand total would come to 41.02, rounding up. I would note that on the phone I mentioned that I had a $5 off coupon (to which he replied, \"No problem, boss.\") -- so my grand total (at the most) should be $36.02. Remember this.\n\nThe food arrived in a reasonable period of time, but when the driver comes, I look at the receipt: $44.47. \"Hang on,\" I say, \"this is way to high, man.\"\n\n\"Did you get the new menu?\"\n\n\"Did you raise prices across the board by like $8? And there's no coupon on here.\"\n\n\"Did you get the new menu?\"\n\n\"Can I keep this itemized copy of my receipt?\"\n\n\"No - I need that. Did you get the new menu?\"\n\nI signed and went upstairs -- with no itemized receipt!! -- and checked out the grub.\n\n\"How's the lasagna?\" I ask. \"Mediocre. The salad isn't bad, but how can you screw up salad? How are the hot wings?\"\n\n\"It tastes like vinegar. Not spicy, not tasty -- just straight up vinegar in the sauce. The garlic bread is OK -- a little greasy and overcooked, but standard.\"\n\n\"And the calzone?\"\n\n\"It looks like they went to Pizza Hut once, bought one of those janky P'Zone pizzas, then tried to replicate it - even with the overuse of garlic powder / cheapo Kraft type Parmesan sprinkled on the outside. No sauce inside -- but at least they gave me a tiny cup of some tomato sauce that tastes like it was made in Chef Boy-R-Dee's cannery.\"\n\n\"So you didn't like it?\"\n\nIn a word -- no. I don't like crappy pizza places that try to make a quick buck with the \"the menu is expired\" (of note -- I got the menu about a week ago) BS, sell crap food, and play dumb when called on it. Even the greasiest pizza on Taraval (I'm talking to you, Pirro's) is better than putting up with that sort of scam, but when you pair it with some of the worst calzones / hot wings around, there's absolutely no point in coming to this place. \n\nThis goes beyond \"avoid\" to \"tell everyone you know not to ever go to\" level.\n\nSo, though we may not know each other, let me tell you about this place called Taraval Pizza...", "author": "Jonathan M."}

I have not tried their other dishes, but it's a pizza place. So naturally just trust the pizzas. \n\nMost pizzas out there you eat will have a tough crust where you'll need the strength of your neck to kind of tear the pizza on top of biting it. THIS pizza although looks thick, has a crust unlike anything I've tried before. It is sturdy, has volume, but when you bite it, crust crumbles perfectly and melts with the toppings in your mouth. I thought only a thin crust can give such an effect. But these guys have a dough that might be revolutionary. \n\nIt's a 3 man team, so don't count on delivery unless you live really nearby. But if you drop by the shop the'll pop your pizza in within 5 mins and will be freshly baked in 15 mins.

My impression and vivid imagination led me to believe that someone may have cancelled their plain cheese order, then I chimed in, added a few toppings, and voila, have a reheated pie sent my way. This was definitely an off-night that had a good explanation I'm sure as they've usually offered consistently good quality.  \n\nThe jalepeno poppers are delicious, fresh jalapeno peppers and cream cheese lightly deep fried.

I could eat here, yet, somehow I can't bring myself to diss Seniore's like that. \n\nIn a few respects, Seniore's and TP share many similar characteristics: pizza by the slice around 3-4 bucks, apathetic employees, late-night delivery service every night, and they're both off L-Taraval. But for some reason Seniore's is always busy between 12-3, and Taraval Pizza, well, it's not. Something is a little off about this place, but I can't exactly put my finger on it.\n\nOne issue I do have is the credit card limit. It's a 10 dollar minimum, which I usually do not have a problem with. But if you sell pizza by the slice, you might want to consider changing that minimum. One night my boyfriend and I decided to grab a slice. We saw the minimum charge rule and put our order together, ordering two slices and two sodas. The total was $9.96 or something ridiculously close to 10, but they made me order something else! Pretty lame. Seniore's doesn't have a minimum at all.\n\nAnother thing, their garlic bread was a big disappointment. It tasted like special garlic-flavored I Can't Believe It's Not Butter on stale french bread. \n\nOne thing I think it's important to point out is TP might be the spot for delivery on busy nights.

I was sober, so I was pretty hesitant on getting some late-night greasy pizza.  Luckily, Taraval Pizza has plenty of options, with many of them being veggie. The pizza place is meant for take-out or delivery, but there is about four or five stools available to enjoy your slice.\n\nThe menu is pretty broad with a large selection of signature pizzas, baked sandwiches, pasta, baked pasta, seafood pasta, appetizers, and salads.  I went with their Chicken Pesto baked sandwich.  The sandwich was made to order and took quite a while to come out, roughly 20 minutes.\n\nThe sandwich is served on French bread and included chicken, pesto, tomato, lettuce, pickles and onions.  The sandwich was average, and nothing special to rave about. The sandwich could have benefited by having more pesto, as the chicken lacked flavor.  Nevertheless, the sandwich was not a total loss and a rather healthy alternative to ordering a pizza.

The service was slow. \n\nI ordered delivery last night and was told that it would take about 45 minutes to an hour. Okay. As long as we have our expectations straight, even though I think an hour is the sort of wait you have for larger jobs at the edge of the delivery limits. I'd ordered one pizza and I don't live very far away, but if it took an hour, it took an hour.\n\nIt took about an hour and forty-five minutes. At least it arrived warm and tasting fairly fresh, so there was that. But I would have appreciated some acknowledgement of my wait--especially as the delay put us past other local places and the supermarket closing and we would have no other food options available. \n\nThat'll learn me. I'll probably stick with Buffalo di Mozzarella because at least when I order from them, I get it about 20 minutes. \n\nHowever, the pizza from Taraval was tasty and the other food was perfectly fine in quality. Now if they can just get the bugs in their delivery sorted out or provide more accurate assessments of when I can expect my food, we'd be fine.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: After reading through other reviews, I note that at least two other folks had delayed delivery issues. So this doesn't seem to be a one-time mistake. It seems if you pick up or eat in, you're probably fine, but avoid delivery.", "author": "Lis M."}

The first time I came to this place, I was looking at a room to rent around the corner and had some extra time and a talking stomach. I ordered a cheese slice and a water. The slice took 15 minutes to be ready and the first bite I tooked burned the roof of my mouth immediately. Like, the second I took the pizza out of my mouth the skin was gone. Not good. Needless to say it took awhile for me to try again.\n\nThe second time I ordered online (thru Grub Hub), paid with a card, and when I went to pick it up, the guy told me it wasn't a good idea to order online, something about it \"taking too long\" Um, ok, whatev. The other 2 times I ordered delivery. It was slow (its just around the corner! Yes, I'm lazy. I work hard, I come home, I'm tired, what can I say?) Anyway, the pizza just needs more stuff on it. The cheese portion is miniscule. I ordered a pizza with pine nuts (75 cents xtra) and I think I got 1 pine nut per slice. It was depressing. More toppings, please!!!!

It adds something to the flavor and texture.\n\nFlavor seemed to be the problem with this pizza, and is why I'm giving it three stars instead of four or five. There plainly wasn't enough sauce, and what sauce there was it was pretty bland. They need seasoning! I imagine they just use straight up tomato paste, no herbs or spices added what so ever. \n\nWould I go back? Yes, I've been there twice now. I gave it an extra star for being a 5 minute walk away.

The key to this is par-baking cheese slices and pre-slicing them. When someone orders a slice of something, all you need to do is add some more cheese to the bottom to melt everything together, add the proper toppings and a little more cheese to make things look better. Sounds easy, no? Well, my slice came out looking like someone took the cheese off the sides of my slice. Talk about skimping on the toppings. And boy did it take them a while to get it to me. I was outside waiting a good 15 minutes. Nasty dry on the inside and the crust was too doughy...Bleah!\n\nNow, I am a glutton for punishment so I might venture to this place again.

Get it home and my Cal zone is absolutely huge.  I should have guessed when the small was $11.  It's all good though I can eat! I felt that it could have used a bit more sauce, or at least give out more sides of sauce. I got two cups of sauce with the order and ran out halfway through.

Not so much in a good way but more in a \"man I'm use to so much better quality\" kind of way. The best comparison I can make about this place is that it tries to mimic how New Yorkers make pizza. This crust, along a thinly made pie with decent toppings. The only problem however is that the quality never gets high enough for my satisfaction. I cannot justify spending 20 bucks on a pizza that makes me want to vomit after. The amount of grease on the pie is evident and the people who make the stuff make no effort to conceal this fact. They try to offer different items on the menu to offset this instead like asking me do I want to add a salad. Don't make me laugh. The only time I truly see people in here is late at night when they're drunk and don't know any better. That or they don't wanna spend more money on better quality or wait in long lines at Seniore's up the block.\n\nHonestly I wouldn't want to come back here for any reason whatsoever.

I was the only customer in the place and everything started out nice enough.  There were about 5 guys working at the time.  The kid at the counter took my order and said I would be about 5 minutes.  Just hung out an waited.  I went outside for a few while I waited and after about 10 minutes came back inside.  I was still waiting for my pizza.  All the guys in the kitchen kept staring at me.  The short guy talking on his phone with his headphones in kept looking at me and was nodding his head at me as to say what's up?  I didn't say anything because I didn't really realize he was addressing me until he took the headphone out of one ear and says \"what's up, do you have a  problem?\"  I only said \"just waiting for my pizza\" and the kid said \"oh I already took his order\". So the dude turns around and doesn't say anything else to me.  A couple minutes later I get my 2 slices of pizza that took about 15 minutes to receive.  I was like \"what's with all the attitude?\"  and they all just stared at me so I left.  I don't really know what their problem was but I was just waiting and never indicated I was annoyed or anything was wrong.  I was actually in a great mood up until that point.

After a fail at Safeway, we staggered home to find a menu for Taraval Pizza on our doorstep. Sweet Synchronicity!! Not only were they open but they still delivered. The pie itself was actually really good. I was surprised, actually. I expected the 2hr wait on NYE but when it finally arrived it was great. Unfortunately, we had all passed out by the time it arrived. Not that it would effect my review. I loves me some pizza and the combo of hot pizza and late night NYE delivery at a good price means I will call them again. Hopefully not when I have no other options. I recommend this place whenever you need a hot tasty pizza at your front door. It was a great ending to a great night.", "author": "Greg H."}

The 5 stars is just for the slices alone. I use to go to Irving pizza a lot and sometimes to Senoires after hours when nothing is open but this place got the BEST SLICES in sunset. I always get the combo and hawaiian slices. Comes out crispy, hot with fresh toppings and plenty of fresh cheese on it. Big slices. The bad thing is that the last 2 times I came here, they were lacking sauce. I picked up the usually last night and noticed again they were lacking sauce. I want to keep ordering from them so I called them last night and told them about the sauce issue. I said \"hey remember me, I just picked up a combo and hawaiian slice?\" He said yeah. I told him about the sauce and he said \" oh sometimes we are in a hurry so thats why\" I told him I wanna continue ordering from them so I just wanted to let them know. He said \"no problem, I know you have been a customer for a long time, we will take care of it so next time there won't be a problem\". Even with the lack of sauce, the slice was damn good. Fresh toppings and crispy ass crust. To all the 1 star reviewers out there, you should at least give them another try with a slice. You can thank me later.", "author": "Vinh T."}

Three stars for the pizza, which is really just mediocre.  The owner was really cool though, for giving us free wine and encouraging us instead of kicking our drunk, loud, obnoxious asses out of his shop at 1 am last night.  They take credit cards and apparently also do free delivery.", "author": "Rick H."}

The night I ordered, the delivery person called me several times; he seemed to think he was at my building, but he wasn't.  I answered politely at first.  By the third call, he had asked me to come downstairs and meet him at the front door; I came down, but nobody was there.  Then he ridiculously claimed that he had been to my apartment and someone told him no food had been ordered.  (I was the only person here, and no one came to my door.)  Finally, I told him I had had enough and hung up.  The delivery person then called me a fourth time, and I chose not to answer.  He left a voice message in which he called me \"the rudest bitch I have ever met in my life,\" an \"asshole,\" and \"the biggest dumb-ass that ever walked the face of the planet\" and told me, \"I hope you fucking die.\"  I let the restaurant's management know about this by way of the Web site I had used to order from Taraval Pizza, but I never got any kind of follow-up from the restaurant, let alone an apology.", "author": "Martin K."}

Not because it's bad but we just haven't been eating pizza that much lately. They have a really good deal -- $19.95 for two medium 2-topping pizzas.  I think that's a pretty good price these days! The guys there are nice enough but at the same time, I don't expect 5-star service -- it's a pizza joint with a couple counter seats for petes sake! Still, they were accomodating when I added an item to my order at the last minute, and the pizza is not bad. Same as a lot of neighborhood pizza places. The guy that took my order thought I was in a hurry since I ordered in person to carry out, so he kept reassuring me that it was just a few more minutes and that he wanted to be sure to cook the pizza all the way.  Nice enough for me!!   I will continue to patronize this small neighborhood business.", "author": "Amy H."}

Why three stars if i like it so much?  delivery is terrible.  Takes them an hour to two hours before you get your food.  They also require a minimum purchase before they'll deliver, but that is totally understandable.................BUT NOT WHEN YOU CHANGE THE MINIMUM EVERY FKEN TIME.  First time i called it was 10, then they said 15, then it went to 20.  no one likes liars.  don't order for delivery, go there and you'll be a happy camper.", "author": "Mike L."}

I can't rave enough about this place. the only slight downside is the guys who work there have a shady look to them and don't always come off as that friendly but they are polite enough, don't bother you and get you what you want. If I had buttloads of money I'd come here every week. I haven't tried their other stuff on the menu, I'm too busy enjoying the pizza.", "author": "Kaitie D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-11-22", "description": "The bread is pretty good. If you like your pizza dough kind of doughy,  fluffy, and for the crust to have an overall mouth-filling bready kind of experience, you'll like the pizza here. They do a good job with the toppings, too. Really generous with them. The meat on the Hawaiian slightly overtakes the portion of pineapples, and the mediterranean is a kind of portable salad by the slice. Good times.", "author": "Joseph R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-08-22", "description": "Okay so I've heard some controversy that this place is better than Senior's pizza, which is like two blocks away.  So I put this place to the test.  I ordered a combo slice for $3.50, which came cooked to order within three to four minutes.  The cheese on the slice, was on the bottom of the toppings as well as melted on top to give the slice an extra cheesy effect which a similar characteristic with Senior's. However, their crust wasn't quite as good, although fluffy on the inside, the outside tends to crumble as I diligently ate around it.   Upon further inspection, I found that their oven wasn't quite the same as I was used to, with Senior's witch also effects flavor as well as texture.  Overall, the difference between Taraval and Senior's is mild at best.  Everything from the service (quick and friendly) to the ambiance (or thier lack of, i should say, as it is a very small pizza parlor), to the pizza itself is all very similar. You could trade one for the other any day, although I still prefer Senior's.", "author": "Erik P."}

IT\"S MEAT SAUCE. even if you buy prepared stuff it shouldn't be that bad. the garlic bread that came with it stole the show, crunchy and delicious. the pizza (all shroom half pepperoni). slightly bland, needed to add a touch of salt. sauce was..not there? yeah, not there at all. possibly a spoonful was placed on the whole pie and swirled around. dough was eh. i have had pizza that was worse, so it's a 2 and 1/2 star type. i'd get it again if it was the last possible resource, very last resource. anyway, the wings, were breaded which i'm not a huge fan of but were ok. the mozzarella stick, you can't go wrong, were good but the marina sauce was cold. (?) maybe they forgot it's usually warm, yeah know, to go with the warm sticks. they did deliver it timely.", "author": "Abigail W."}

When I called half an hour later frustrated because I've never had a pizza take that long he insisted on calling the driver before I cancelled the order he calls the driver on the walkie talkie where the driver said my address is next when the man on the phone asked the time estimate the driver said 10-20 minutes the man answered back he will be there shortly I said he just indicated another 10-20 minutes which would be almost 2 hours for a pizza. He then said no it will be only 5 minutes. Not only did I hear the driver the man lied. This is ridiculous! Who waits 2 hrs for a pizza! I told him to cancel it and hung up. They just called to say they were here an hour and fifty minutes later after I told them I cancelled the order. Thankfully I was going to pay cash. Terrible service!", "author": "Bridget W."}
