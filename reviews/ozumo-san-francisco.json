The scallops were cooked through, but I could not taste them past the miso butter, which was very salty and reminded me of Velveeta cheese.\n- Shishito peppers ($7): Came out cold, barely grilled, and limp.\n- California Roll ($12): The pieces were cut very unevenly - They looked like a mini mountain range sitting on a plate.\n- Flight of sakes: Good, but also tiny!\n\n(2) Atmosphere: Very beautiful.\n\n(3) Service: Very fast and friendly, but not particularly helpful with the menu.\n\n(4) Location: In a wonderful location in SOMA.", "author": "Michelle B."}

When entering it is dark and you walk through the bar to get to the restaurant. Once in the restaurant it is noisy, the sushi bar top was very sticky and the waiters were fast talking and slow to return when needing a beverage refill or to serve food.\n\nOddly enough, I sat at the sushi bar and was never greeted by any of the chefs standing directly in front of me.\n\nItem #1 \"dohyo\" bigeye tuna tartare, edamame, cucumber, avocado, black tobiko, ponzu, wasabi oil, served with gyoza chips. This dish came and appears it was made in advance or with old avocado. It was served with cold greasy chips. As for flavor my palate is ruined with the taste of greasy chips and ponzu. This Sadly missed my expectations for $18.\n\nItem #2 \"Yuzu Maguro Maki\" asparagus tempura, cucumber, kaiware roll topped with maguro, shiso, yuzu goma vinaigrette sauce. The presentation is wonderful. The flavor is thrown off by the shiso giving a very woody flavor - not good. I wouldn't order it again, especially for $18.\n\nItem #3 \"Sekiwake\" spicy tuna roll with tobiko, tempura flakes, salmon and hamachi with a peanut sauce. The peanut sauce is nice but really doesn't go with the dish. I can't tell where the tempura flakes are and the roll is small. The salmon is bitter and fishy the rice is ok. And for spicy - that's got to be a joke as pepper has more spice than this roll it's really bland. I do like the hamachi but my mouth is quite fishy and nasty tasting. Another $18 failure.\n\nAfter three solid attempts it was a horrible experience not to return.\n\nOne person 3 rolls and a 12 ounce beer $82.", "author": "Chris A."}

I shared with him my one impromptu mission: I want to\u00a0find a Sake to show me the light in the world of rice wines. \n\nBrowsing their expansive Sake menu, I came across several options that called out to me. The intrigue of the described tasting notes matched the richly poetic names themselves - brief expressions the beautiful, art-appreciating country where these hidden treasures come from. \n\nMarcos was eager to help out, answering any and every question I had -\u00a0most before they had a chance to leave my lips! Suddenly, not being in a rush as I had been up to that point in the day,\u00a0I was willing to go on a relaxed adventure. Having a case of Schr\u00f6dinger's Bank Account, I concerned myself not regarding the prices of these world class beverages.  I Instead opted to experience a variety of these liquid blessings from The Land of The Rising Sun. \n\nFatigued, I had a frayed filter and was quick to admit that my limited experience up until this point was Sho-Chiku-Bai on sale at CVS. (Heated up in the microwave to help the bargain beverage proliferate my bloodstream.) Without a hint nor shred of dismay, Marcos in his great patience showed his respect that I would be willing to taste of the fruits from greener pastures. \n\nOn that fateful night, I tried three Sake varieties that have forever changed my perspective. Being a craft beer snob (hint: Westvleteren) I was surprised to find myself daydreaming about switching my rainy-day trove of liquid barley for rice. \n\nThis review may seem airy and filled with poetry, and that's exactly what enlightenment Ozumo offers!  A step *away* from the mundane, the on-sale, the bargain selections, and the bland ...\u00a0a portal *into* a divine expression of Japan that cannot be read about but experienced first-hand.

I would recommend the back area for a group or a meeting.    \n\nWe made a reservation for 5 people, and when we arrived we were promptly seated at the back of the restaurant -- in the section that is more like an upscale sushi bar.  As soon as we were seated, we were greeted by our wonderful server.  \n\nI ordered the \"Giddy Geisha\" for my cocktail - Smirinoff vodka, lychee juice and passion fruit pur\u00e9e and I ended up getting two of these because they were so good!  They add a lychee in the drink for you to eat too - yum!  My coworker ordered a \"Kazan\" - Ketel vodka with muddled jalape\u00f1o, cucumber and shiso -- holy cow, amazing!  It's a sweet but spicy cocktail that tastes so good!  I would recommend both of these cocktails.  We also shared a carafe of the house hot sake, which was delicious and fun for the group.\n\nTo start we ordered the \"Edamame\" and \"Kaki Kaki Kaki\" dish, which is a half dozen oysters with momiji oroshi, scallions and ponzu.  The edamame was pretty standard but the oysters were delicious!  Super fresh with great flavors, I would definitely recommend.  Also fun to share with a group.  \n\nI then ordered the \"Hanabi\" which is sliced hamachi (yellowtail) with avocado and warm ginger-jalape\u00f1o ponzu.  This was a beautiful dish.  If it's too spicy you can just pick off the jalape\u00f1os. Good, but not my favorite dish of the night.\n\nI highly recommend the \"Dohyo,\" which is bigeye tuna tartare with edamame, cucumber, avocado, black tobiko, ponzu and wasabi oil, served with gyoza chips.  It's so delicious -- definitely one of my favorite items on the menu and a pretty big portion.  You can share with a group as an appetizer or just order it for yourself as your entree honestly.  I will definitely come back for this dish.  Loved!\n\nI recommend the \"Gyu Tataki\", which is seared washu beef, arugula, thin sliced red onions, shiso, garlic chips, momiji oroshi, and ponzu.  Some at my table that this wasn't the prettiest dish, but let me tell you -- it tasted amazing!  I got to eat one piece, but it left me wanting more.  Great flavor!\n\nI also recommend the \"Shacho\" if you love lobster and love pretty dishes - lobster, mango, jalape\u00f1o and cilantro wrapped in tuna, spicy sesame aioli.  It was the most BEAUTIFUL dish.  You only get 4 pieces of the actual roll but they stick the empty lobster tail in the middle of the dish, and make it look absolutely gorgeous.  Everyone was so impressed when this dish arrived.  Definitely not a huge portion -- but it's lobster, so that's expected.  Loved!\n\nFor dessert we got the \"Matcha Panna Cotta\" - with strawberries and apples and the \"Fondue\" - warm Belgian chocolate fondue, fresh fruit, matcha sponge cake, and cookies.  The clear winner at our table was the Fondue -- I pretty much ate the Matcha Panna Cotta by myself.  It was good, but not great -- not much flavor.  I found myself using my Fondue chocolate covered spoon because it tasted better!  The Fondue was more of a hit, we loved the matcha sponge cake.   \n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this spot.  The presentation of the dishes is outstanding -- so it's perfect for IG.  The quality of the food matches its good looks, everything was delicious -- there was not one thing I didn't like.  The space itself is gorgeous and spacious.  The service is wonderful.  The only downside is the price -- but hey you do actually get what you pay for.  Quality food, service, venue -- definitely worth a visit.  I will definitely be back here!", "author": "Michelle S."}

All the sake bottles decorating the shelves, the immaculately kept cleanliness of the place, it's impeccable.\n\nThe drink:\n-I went for the Double Barrel cocktail, which was good, however it was essentially an overly glorifed Manhattan (suggest getting it on the rocks, not Up) It was tasty, though.\n-My partner ordered the Dewazakura sake flight, with fruit and floral notes - I had some and approved heartily.\n\nThe food:\n-We started with the Dohyo Osusume (in my haste to consume it, I deigned to take a picture!) It was a great balance of flavors between the lean tuna, fatty avocado, and salty/citrusy sauce beneath it. The gyoza chips are a nice, light, crispy touch as a vessel.\n-Second appetizer was the Shacho Makimono. It was served in a beautiful display! The spicy sesame aoli was inspired. I couldn't get enough of it. Mango+lobster is a great combination. Cool, and sweet, with a hint of spice from the jalapeno make the flavors of each ingredient pop.\n-Entree was the Umami Braised Duckbreast Ippin-mono and let me tell you, it was scrumptious. Perfectly cooked, served on a tantalizing bed of wasabi pureed potatoes. The combination of umami and wasabi was magical. I wasn't a huge fan of the skin (being all chewy), but the flavors made up for it.\n\nDessert: Fondue\nYou can't go wrong with a large pot of chocolate warmed over your own personal clay oven apparatus! I think, however, the selections for dipping could be more inspired. The matcha cake was dry. The cookie was extremely dry. The chocolate almost couldn't make up for the lack of moisture. Perhaps a suggestion for the restaurant to also seek better fruit vendors, as the melons were juicy but tasted plain, and the strawberries and pineapples erred on the sour side. \n\nOverall I would give a 5 star except for my minimal gripes over small details. I definitely would come back and suggest anyone who hasn't to give it a try. \n\nOur server was a wonderfully charming girl! If I could recall her name, I would sing her praises. Just attentive enough to not be a bother and very pleasant. \n\nClean bathrooms, clean silverware, clean floors - clean everything - are always a plus!", "author": "Angela S."}

To be honest, the classy decor and upscale feel of the place doesn't match the meh quality of the food. We sampled from most the menu: appetizers, sushi, ramen, and rice plates. A walkthrough:\n\n- The gyoza had a really nice exterior, but the meat inside was bland and oddly chewy. \n- The tuna tartare was the best thing I tried, with a great citrus sauce at the bottom of the bowl; oddly, we couldn't get the sauce to \"cling\" to the fish or avocado, so each bite was almost tantalizing. \n- It's possible that we picked the wrong sushi rolls and sashimi. The Hamachi roll and Sekiwake roll were just not great. They were fine. I expected more; they were like rolls you'd get from any cheap sushi restaurant in SF. We also got some salmon sashimi which was, again, just fine. Nothing special. \n- The Gyu Don rice bowl was my biggest disappointment. When you say \"saut\u00e9ed wagyu beef with black pepper sauce\" I imagine really tender steak and garlicky, spicy deliciousness. In my case, they ruined the beef with their saut\u00e9ing; the result were rubbery strands of steak that with minimal flavor. The sauce also was pretty generic and did not burst on my tongue. I wouldn't say the dish was bad, but it wasn't memorable. \n\nI don't think I'd bother going back here -- there is so much great Japanese food in downtown SF -- but I wouldn't be crushed if I ended up back here again (if someone else is paying).", "author": "Benjamin G."}

Minimalist design with light wood accents.  Front area makes it look more like a bar scene but the back section of the restaurant makes it look more like a restaurant.  \n\nStaff: very friendly and accommodating, though we may have come at a busy time (Tuesday 6:30pm) since it was sometimes hard to grab the waiters' attention.  When we ordered a carafe of sake (Kubota Manju), they didn't realize that they had ran out but were kind enough to bring the last glass of the Kubota Manju with no extra charge and provide a new recommendation for us (Kubota Hekiju)\n\nFood: awesome sushi!!  Note that they price nigiri/sashimi by piece, so you don't need to order 5 pieces of sashimi as is priced on the menu (my friend and I together ordered four of each type of sashimi).  We had toro, mirugai, hamachi, and benitoro.  Toro was quite good, even though it was a bit too soft for my liking (dunno if it was an old piece or not).\n\nWe also ordered the Hotate Sarada (scallops, seasonal medley, onion vinaigrette, shiso pesto) and a special Prime New York Tataki (with red onion, truffle oil, and ponzu).  Hotate was good though not particularly spectacular- we were more obsessed with the brussell sprouts than the scallop, which could have been seared more.  The tataki overall was tasty though the meat itself was unseasoned- we both commented how it was almost like the condiments were trying to mask how bland the meat was.\n\nDessert- we ordered the matcha panna cotta.  I personally liked it, though I can see how matcha lovers (like my friend) would wish that there was more matcha flavor in the panna cotta itself.\n\nAll in all, probably a good place to get quality sushi / sashimi in FiDi, maybe with coworkers or for a slightly more trendy date night.

We were greeted immediately by the friendly hostess and taken to our seats at the sushi counter. The staff all stand at attention when a customer walks in the dining room and they all chant \"irasshaimase\" (welcome!) just like in Japan! (I am half Japanese and lived in Japan for many years.) Charlie, the (also half Japanese!) sushi chef promptly greeted us with a friendly smile. The manager, Miho-san, also came by to say hello and asked us if we needed anything. We knew we were in good hands! Our server, Ken-san was also extremely polite, friendly and always there when we needed something (but not hovering at all). Now onto the food! \n\nChef Charlie started us off with mozuku (a type of seaweed) in vinegar with 2 generous pieces of sweet crab. It was delicious! Next, we were served 2 plump shigoku oysters, one had momiji oroshi & ponzu, the other had ikura on top. OMG! Yum. Next course was sashimi which was akami maguro, hirame and ama-ebi. The maguro was the perfect color and texture, and the ama-ebi was plump and so sweet! After sashimi, we had a palate cleansing carrot salad course, then came some shrimp tempura. Again, the shrimp were perfectly plump and fresh, and the light coating of batter was just right. We were then served a \"yamakake\" maguro dish, which is like a grated yam over maguro with nori and soy sauce (a Japanese classic). This dish might not be for some Americans (it's a bit slimy) but we loved it. After that we had mirugai sashimi which had the perfect combination of chewy and crunchy textures (kori kori in Japanese), similar to abalone. We started to get full so we asked for some nigiri sushi before we got too full. All the fish was perfect. We finally ended the feast with some grilled buri and miso soup, then satisfied our sweet tooth with the rich & decadent (and SO yummy) rice pudding. Wow! We both needed bigger pants at the end of the meal! Service was top notch, food was excellent quality and the ambiance all made this one memorable dining experience.

The cod is crispy on the outside and juicy+tender on the inside. The marinated cod goes along really well with the miso sauce. Would definitely order this dish again.\nFutago: definitely my favorite appetizer, the flavor and texture combination of flat iron beef, spinach, cucumber, and eggplant along with miso sesame sauce hits the spot, presentation is also on point.\nToro hand roll: pretty standard roll as how you would expect it to be, although I expected the toro here to be even more fresh based on the price point\n2 rolls--Ozumo and hamachi maki: Ozumo gives off a refreshing presentation and taste. The unagi, crab and tuna combination really pulls through with the spicy aioli sauce. The hamachi maki roll, however, is  not the best roll you can order here, the hamachi is a little tough, and there is a slice of jalape\u00f1o on each roll which not only doesn't add anything to the overall flavor (as you can tell I'm not a big fan of jalape\u00f1os) but the way it's done also makes this dish look kinda cheap, although I do like the plating of this dish. \nOverall, the food, service, and atmosphere here are pretty decent, but I would say I was expecting more given the price. Out of the 5 dishes we ordered, 3 of them have slices of jalape\u00f1os somewhere in them, which personally I didn't enjoy.

I had helped her find her phone and she had offered to take me out to dinner. I felt a little bad we had ended up at Ozumo due to its price but you really can't be too picky without a reservation on a Friday night.\n\nWe were able to get seated at the sushi bar right away and started browsing the menu. San Francisco is an expensive city but Ozumo takes it to another level. Rolls for ~$20 here would be available at other (better tasting) Japanese restaurants for ~$14-16. Everything here is about 20-40% more expensive than it should be. \n\nWe tried to be somewhat price conscious (what would be the best bang-for-your-buck?) and decided on the following four items:\n-Yasai Tempura ($15): Very nicely cooked tempura and large portion size. This was the best part of the meal. It's a vegetarian dish but we lucked out and somehow got a free shrimp with it. However, when the server noticed the shrimp, he was concerned that it had appeared because if the customer had been vegetarian or allergic to shrimp, this would've been a costly mistake.\n-Hanabi ($19): This hamachi and avocado appetizer is supposed to be one of the most popular dishes here. It was presented beautifully but unfortunately, way too salty.\n-Jidori ($18): Chicken seemed like a safe bet. This was even saltier than the hamachi and it made us extra thirsty. When the server came to ask us how things were, we mentioned this was too salty and he took it back and took it off our bill. Thank you for that.\n-Bucho Roll ($20): Tempura shrimp with avocado and real crab is a combo I can work with. It was solid.\n\nWe ended the meal with an order of cheesecake. It was not a \"American-style\" cheesecake but also denser than a Japanese-style cheesecake. Not bad, but not great.\n\nOverall, the food was mediocre, which definitely does not justify the high prices.

I looked at their menu online and called for take out. They charged me $4 more for 1 skewer of each instead of 2 without any rice as stated on the menu.\n\nTo begin with, they first told me if I would like to order then I have to download grub hub or door dash. Then she told me to hold on and changed her mind. \n\nAfter I saw my order was not what I expected nor wanted, I gave them a call and they were telling me that the menu I saw is very \"specific\" and not accurate even though it was from the hotel's partner advertising with Ozumo. \n\nThe very least you can do is be nice and respectful especially when your food is very mediocre. The combination of mediocre food and poor customer service in the city where there are so many options, I would expect them to make an effort or even a fake apology. \n\nHope the manager can take this review and have a coaching conversation with the 2 ladies at the front to help improve the restaurant", "author": "Davey J."}

I guess I have really high expectations when I eat fancy Japanese but the quality of the roll was not outstanding.  \n\nThe Cod was good, portion was a bit small...literally 75% of the dish was just sauce in a pretty pattern.  \n\nOverall, good spot but I think a bit overrated in my opinion.

For the ambiance and service, Ozumo was really great. \n\nI appreciate our servers as they were very attentive. I thought that the food was over priced for what they were. Sushi was delicious, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't as great as some other (less expensive alternatives) in the city. \n\nFor our party of five, we ordered pretty much every roll, along with the black cod (HIGHLY RECOMMEND) and hamachi sashimi. \n\nMust get: \nGindara - sweet miso and sake kasu marinated black cod with grilled shishito peppers ($29). The cod melts in your mouth. Super delicious, light, and flavorful. Texture was perfect. \nShacho -  lobster, mango, jalape\u00f1o and cilantro wrapped in tuna with spicy sesame aioli ($24 for five pieces....not a lot, but delicious). Presentation of this roll was gorgeous. If you want to impress da ladies (or just your friends or yourself), treat them/you with this roll! \n\nOther rolls we tried along with my thoughts: \nBucho - typical tempura roll, nothing too special, over priced\nSpider - softshell crab, delicious, but portion was very small\nKanpachi Maki - too spicey and zesty and not enough fish. I felt like we had too much rice and other toppings rather than fish, which is what I'd like when I get sushi \nOzumo - Unagi roll w/ tuna. Pretty standard roll, I thought Ozumo did a pretty good job but again, portion size was too small for the price and ingredients. \n\nDrink: Double Barrel was delicious! Our whole table loved it (both men and women). It was a great, better alternative to the old fashioned except this one is mixed with 5 different bourbon and served in a martini glass :) I highly recommend this if you're into bourbon. Double Barrel is made with -- Bulleit, Makers Mark, Jack Daniels and George Dickle bourbons aged three months, Carpano Antica Formula, and cherry bark bitters.", "author": "Dana Z."}

Since my brother likes sushi and Japanese food, I decided to take them to Ozumos since it's just down the street from my house.\n\nFirst when we were handed the menus we had no idea what anything meant. It was confusing for us to choose so had to rely on Yelp. The waiter recommended how popular the oysters were. Omg! When they came out, I want to order a magnifying glass because they were so small. I was so embarrassed that the four of us had to split 6 crumb size oysters. The waiter also recommended the rock shrimp that was not on the menu. That was a decent size for all of us to share. It was light, crunchy, and delicious! The waiter had said that the tuna tartar was a big hit. I told him that we couldn't get it because my husband is allergic to edamame. He said we can order it without it, so we ordered two. Also, there was a bug in my water.\n\nWe ordered a lot of sushi that all of us shared. We ordered 1 Sacho which had lobster, mango, jalape\u00f1os, cilantro, and tuna which was gross. It was very chewy and one of the people in our party could not swallow it so he had to spit it out in his napkin. We ordered 2 Buchos which had crab, tempura shrimp, avocado, and tobiko. It was about $8.00 quality, but paid $18 each for it. Then we had 6 different classic rolls which was $10 per roll and the quality was not there. Everyone in my party agreed that this was just a one time thing and will not go back.\n\nLet me talk about the staff now. There is this one older petite Asian woman who kept staring at my husband. She came to our table and didn't even acknowledge any of us and gave my husband his own bowl of chips for the tuna tartar. My husband even made a comment that maybe the old lady will give us a discount because we all notice how flirty she was. Then our waiter who didn't care about my husbands allergies.. Wait! You guys are probably wondering why we thought he didn't care. Well we did mention that my husband is highly allergic to edamame so he said we can get the tuna tartare without it. When it came out we asked him if there was edamame, he said no.. So right after dinner we had to rush my husband to the ER because he had a really bad allergic reaction the the tuna tartare. I should of called the next day to demand a refund, but the hospital suggested we make them pay for our hospital bills. I was just too exhausted to make the phone call. I had to make sure my husband kept up with his benedryl/medication so his throat doesn't close. I will definitely tell people about my experience at this place and how irresponsible and insensitive the staff was with my husbands allergies. Thank God my husband is still alive and breathing.

Immediately, our experience at Ozumo was hampered by the extremely rude hostess at the back restaurant, who insisted we would not be able to sit at a table despite it being past 5:30. After finally getting a seat, we expected to enjoy a delicious and filling meal. Not so! My mother and I ordered edamame followed by two sushi rolls. My mother's entree arrived well before mine, leaving me to wait awkwardly without dinner. When we asked our waiter why hers was brought before mine, she stated that the dishes were brought out as soon as they were prepared and intended to be shared. We have different tastes in food (I enjoy spicy food while my mother does not) and made this clear to the server, so there is no logical reason why she would expect us to have ordered food to share. Additionally, this was not made clear to us, leaving my mother and I annoyed and hungry. \n\nWhen my meal was finally delivered over forty minutes later, it consisted of merely three pieces of the sushi roll itself. The rest of the plate was used to construct a beautiful display using pieces of cucumber and fruit that would have been more appropriate for a cooking show than a meal intended for actual human consumption. A+ for design, but we were charged way too much for the small amount of food provided. The final bill came to over $200, and we felt rushed to vacate the table even after the poor service we were provided.

I started off with their seasonal cocktail Kumo, an elderflower and gin concoction that was sweet, but not too sweet. A perfect way to start my NYE libations!\n\nWe got several small plates to share and we were not disappointed. The Hari-Hari, their Wagyu Beef Salad, was one of the show-stoppers for sure. The beef was amazing and the salad was a great way to kick off our meal. Fresh tomatoes and a great dressing made the whole salad perfection. \n\nThe Hanabi is amazing too, with the ginger sauce being a very unique flavor that we enjoyed. We finished off the evening with the Moriawase sashimi plate, which split between two people allowed it to be more affordable and enough food to finish off the meal. \n\nBy far the best part, the BEST PART of the whole evening was their sake tasting flights! Not only do they have the highest quality sake, but they bring a print out with it to show you exactly what you are drinking and what notes you should be tasting for. What a creative way to get more people involved in the sake scene!\n\nOverall, it is a bit pricier than I usually go, but for NYE or a special occasion it was such a great decision! The service was great and I will definitely be returning for my next big occasion in the city.", "author": "Caitlin A."}

How about managing reservations and tables well? \n\nFinally when we were seated in the dining room, we discovered the reason table turn over is so delayed. About 5 minutes after we'd finished all our initial dishes, our server came over to see if we wanted anything more. He didn't check on us at all when our dishes came out and hadn't noticed we were missing soy sauce. We had to flag the person clearing the table next to us to ask him for soy sauce. We then ordered more food, then someone else came and cleared our plates and chopsticks and we had to ask for more plates and utensils when our second round of dishes arrived. \n\nLastly, we ordered two desserts to split among 4 of us, and the server misheard and brought only 1 and the check.

Small portions, moderate flavor, and a high price tag. Now I totally understand paying for quality food, but we have sushi in my hometown that tastes MUCH better and you get the same number of rolls for almost half the price. The taste wasn't enough to prompt a return visit.", "author": "Kathryn B."}

I waited in the bar until they arrived and ordered a Sancerre (not on the wine menu by the glass, but he did have it which was a plus, since their selection wasn't ideal on the menu). I paid $23 for the glass ($27 after tip)...by the way, my husband owns a winery and I know this is EXTREMELY overpriced for any Sancerre. Another friend arrives and she orders the same thing...again $23 for the glass. We are seated and order another glass each OF THE SAME WINE during dinner, and we're charged $20/per glass (did I mention anything over $16 for a glass of of any Sancerre is ridiculously overpriced)? Something is very off in the bar area. Either the bartenders are charging up for extra tips, or they have a disconnect with the servers in the dining room. Overall the service in the dining room was good, as well as the food, but I've definitely had better. But for a wine list that is lacking some great vino choices, they're overcharging for everything. I called the manager that night on my way home, since I was so irritated by discrepancy of cost between the bartenders and ordering in the dining area. He was very nice, but had no explanation as to why they have different charges. I've decided I won't be back (and my friends most likely won't be either).", "author": "Shelly S."}

The inside was beautiful, and we were seating near the chefs station, which was awesome to be able to see the chefs making the masterpieces. There is great sushi everywhere in San Fran. That being said, it takes a lot for restaurants to really stick out in San Fran. We started out with miso soup, vegetable tempura, and the dohyo. I usually can judge a Japanese restaurant off of the miso soup - their's was delicious! Super fresh, not fishy at all. The tempura was light and not heavy sitting, and the dohyo was fresh and divine as well. \n\nFor dinner I ordered the Omakase, which means chefs selections. This is another one of my favorite things to do at a Japanese restaurant. Some of the fish that came with my Omakase were, tuna belly, salmon belly, yellow tail belly, white tuna, and Japanese mackerel. Oh my LAWD! Each piece was delectably fresh and satisfying. I strongly recommend getting chefs choice at any restaurant, but especially here. The staff here is very attentive, sometimes I think they rush to turn over tables, but I think their staff is just attentive and want to make sure everything is running smoothly. All in all, really awesome experience, and I definitely recommend!", "author": "Cate T."}

The garlic and soy edamame was tasty but messy - you don't typically expect flavor dialed up in edamame. Very good though. The Shacho roll was a fave, with Maine lobster, jalape\u00f1o and cilantro wrapped in tuna and sesame paper (without rice or seaweed). We also really liked the Hanabi, wich was hamachi sashimi, sliced avocado and jalape\u00f1o bathed in a warm ginger sauce. The Doyho small plate was also great, with spicy tuna tartare and avocado formed in a round mold and served with fried noodle chips.  It was almost like elegant Japanese nachos with the chips served on the side. \n\nMy favorite of the bigger plates was the gindara, their miso cod, which I'll order anywhere I see it on the menu - that is by far my favorite preparation for cooked fish, and one of my favorite dishes bar none. This version was particularly wonderful.  We also had a number of great rolls too. This restaurant is actually quite large and seemed to go on forever, despite its comparatively small storefront on Steuart St. Very good Japanese fusion restaurant. Really enjoyed it.", "author": "Michael S."}

The fish is fresh and isn't the issue but any sushi enthusiast would know that a piece of fresh fish isn't the only thing that defines a good piece of sushi.  The rice is inconsistent.  Most often times too wet and sometimes undercooked.  Rice to fish proportions lack balance as well.  As of late, our favorite dish there, miso black cod, has been overcooked the past 3-4 times we've been.  This is what you get in a part of town where people in the financial district fuels their operations.  \n\nHowever, the vibe and setting keeps me and my friends coming back. There's always chatter and a good feel commotion going on at the bar with a very good looking crowd. More than anything we can guarantee a bite at the later hours of the night.  If you're into sake, their selection hardly disappoints with such a large variety.  If you don't know much about sake, their sommelier and servers will be able to take you thru the menu.  \n\nIf you come here, enjoy the atmosphere and don't get your hopes too high with the sushi if you're a real sushi lover.  Be prepared to spend your hard earned money here because there would be no avoiding for a good time.", "author": "Colin M."}

(This whole strip of restaurants used to be great; I saw Santana eatinfat Chaya once). Since then, it has been superseded by better sushi joints and the overall food quality has decreased. But most shocking was the service we experienced. I don't usually give bad reviews for bad service because all humans have off days but this was a slew of people with unbelievably poor professionalism. Despite spending around $700, we were treated like crap. \n\nFirst of all, you can make a reservation for Ozumo at 10:15 and 10:30. So we arrive at 10:20 with a reservation and are informed we won't be able to have dinner but we can sit at the bar because the kitchen closes at 10:30. Now not only did we bring a rockstar guest who was hungry but also why would you make tables available on OpenTable at times when your kitchen is closed?! In the bar area, it wasn't even possible to hear each other speak. \n\nWe waited ten minutes while the waitress fetched the hostess to talk about it and then the hostess fetched the manager to talk about. When she came back she notified us that we had ten minutes to order. So finally we are seated at 10:30 and the waiter just disappears. Around 10:45 I waived down someone else who took our order because I was worried the kitchen would be closed. I had been looking for our waiter for probably ten minutes by then, even went to the window to show our guest the bridge lights while waiting. \n\nAfter we ate (the food was ok, some of the sushi hadn't even fully thawed yet), our guest was told to chug her wine by the waiter because the dishwasher was leaving!  Meanwhile the female manager took our guest's credit card from the table (without asking) and tried to run the tab with that card! We had already paid.  I still cannot believe how she just plucked it from the table (where it was sitting amongst our guest's other purse contents) and tried to run it for the check.\n\nOf course, when dessert time came, we couldn't have dessert. So why weren't we given a dessert menu up front? Seriously, if your guests don't even have time to sit down and order food, why do you make tables available at that time?", "author": "Marina N."}

My wife and I decided to meet a business friend for dinner here last night. My wife and I arrived early, so we ordered a drink and some edamame, followed with an order of a dozen raw oysters. First bad mistake: edamame arrived and before it even touched our lips.. We both looked at each other and said they smell of stinky old fish! We tried one bean and spit hem out. The waitress came over in a few and asked how it was. We told her and she did not look shocked to hear this at all. She said she'd go get another batch. Then returned and said the 'chef' tried them and said he didn't smell fish. I'm sure he couldn't smell fish if it crawled inside his nose. He worked with it all day, or evening!  \nThen she said they would all be the same. So we declined another one. She was very nice about it. Then our dozen oysters arrived as six! Good thing they messed up the amount. They ruined the raw oysters by placing sour tasting soy sauce like stuff in the shell and pimento on top each one! They left the nastiest after taste I've ever had. I've heard people say this place has really gone downhill. And with how few people were in here, and our experience? I agree!", "author": "Kirk M."}

I was very impressed with the meal. I find a good bowl of ramen very comforting especially when its extra spicy. The waiter offered both spicy seasoning and Sriracha sauce as condiments for the soup. The soup was a little pricier than I would expect for a bowl of ramen but this restaurants also looks like its a classy place so I wasn't completely the surprised. The prices matched the atmosphere.\n\nDRINK: Ozumo has a big bar at which to order a variety of alcoholic beverages. Since I was there for lunch on a work day I did not indulge but instead had water. They also offer fountain drinks. I do not know if they offer happy hour but I would like to go back some time after work to see.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Ozumo had a very fancy atmosphere. The lightning is little lower than normal and everything seemed to be made of wood. They had smaller tables near the front for quick drop in dining and a bigger area in the back for reserved tables. I imagine this could be a great place to take someone for drinks after work especially if you want to bring them somewhere with a nice or classy feel to it.\n\nSTAFF: Our waiter was very friendly and was able to offer recommendations for ramen bowls to me and each of my co-workers. All of his recommendations turned out to be outstanding. Being lunch time on a work day he stopped by frequently enough that we didn't have to wait long to pay our check which I find is important when patrons might have to rush back to the office.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nI was very impressed with my experience at Ozumo. Do to the price of the ramen bowl it's not a place I'll go to every week for lunch but I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up there about once per month.

We called from the road and the hostess was very accommodating and moved our reservation to a later time. When we walked in, the hostess was also very friendly and a welcoming face. Wish I had gotten her name! She even seated us next to the window, with a great view of the bay bridge. I ordered the japi\u00f1o colada and my parents each ordered a different cocktail that I can't recall the names of. I thought the cocktail was a tad strong for my taste but my father enjoyed his. We started off with garlic edamame and dohyo (tuna tartare), both excellent. We ordered five sushi rolls: ozumo, shacho, bucho, the spicy scallop roll, and a spicy tuna roll. All delicious, but a must-order is the shacho roll. It is a lobster roll, but so fresh!! A great take in comparison to most baked lobster rolls seen in other sushi restaurants. Decided to forgo dessert at ozumo to get specialty ice cream elsewhere in SF, but the waiter did bring my brother and I birthday ice cream. A scoop of delicious vanilla bean topped with fresh mint and fruit. It was a lovely dinner - highly recommended for special occasions!", "author": "Kira M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-24", "description": "Food is quite good, but not fantastic. Nice ambience, but over-priced.\n\nI had a Sunday special Omakase with seven courses.\n\nThe restaurant has very nice upscale decorations and left me a good first impression. The plates and dishes are nice, BUT with disposable chopsticks, ironically carefully wrapped in napkins. Also, these are even not good disposable chopsticks. To match their upscale environment and high prices, they should probably get rid of these disposable ones.\n\nThe first course is white tuna and scallop sashimi. Both very fresh and tasty, but should have been served with ginger.\n\nThe second is a salad with three different kinds of seaweeds. The three different kinds of seaweeds form a nice texture and is overall delicious.\n\nFollowing that comes the best course of the night, Futago, which is seared beef with saut\u00e9ed garlic spinach and eggplant, topped with miso sesame sauce. The dish has a very rich taste - the three different layers of flavors burst out in the mouth and form a most enjoyable trio of the ingredients.\n\nThe fourth course is hamachi and avocado in ginger ponzu. The hamachi tastes a little bit fishy, probably because it's not the best season for hamachi. Would be better if served with lime instead of avocado.\n\nThe fifth is miso black cod and grilled peppers. I think this is the worst dish of the night. The black cod was overcooked and had a burnt taste, and the peppers tasted too dry. Also, totally didn't get the point of bringing these two things together.\n\nThe sixth is black rice with mushrooms and uni. I would say the rice is too creamy which doesn't go well with the uni. But the uni tastes very nice.\n\nThe dessert is coconut sorbet, providing a nice summer taste.\n\nI ended up paying ~100 dollars with a 20% tip automatically included.\n\nOverall the food is quite good, but not worth the price. If you're looking for a restaurant with nice ambience and service, it will probably be good for you. But if you're on a food adventure and care more about the food itself, I would not recommend this place.", "author": "Jiaxin G."}

There are places with overpriced menus, bad service, and lack the extras I need (like valet parking).\n\nOzumo is the kind of restaurant you know is going to be pricy but you feel fine with it because it is on par with the quality of what you receive. \n\nThey have an extensive collection of Sake. I had a photograph of the expensive bottle I often receive from a Japanese colleague. I showed it to our server and lo - they had it! I was so happy. \n\nThe deservedly popular Hanabi - hamachi with jalape\u00f1o Ponzu is what we always start with. Assorted sashimi filled out the rest of our sexy lunch. \n\nAttentive valet right out front makes good use of my time. \n\nConstructive critiques: \n\nSeating isn't comfortable, but I am never here for long (despite my love of leisurely lunches).\n\nThe hostess station is right by the front door without a place to sit should she tell you your table isn't ready. I don't like that unpolished part of my visits. \n\nThe crowd isn't predominantly Asian as we are accustomed to when having Sushi prepared by Japanese sushi chefs but - and this is a big but...the sushi here is so fresh it really is a moot point. The service is not of Japanese discipline either. I can feel my purist friends balking and getting mad at me for liking this restaurant...but I do!\n\nI like Ozumo for my numerous positive experiences here. I couldn't care less about what is going on around me because my sashimi is always cold, fresh, and delicious! \n\nI will be back for sexy sashimi!", "author": "Jennifer C P."}

Though it was busy and there was a holiday party going on that night, the service was phenomenal! When a business is swamped, yet it can still perform and give attention to detail and NOT leave their other customers to go unnoticed, or neglected, it demonstrates what a business is really made of!!! \n\nMy waitress was great and suggested some of her favorites like the black cod and the top four sushi rolls (just delicious!) We also enjoyed the filet mignon with mushrooms and the appetizers were refreshing. \n\nBut I have to say I LOVE Mel! He introduced himself, reassured us of a table, and expedited everything. I'm confident that the reason the service is exemplary at Ozumo is because of him. I watched how he communicated well with the staff and other customers, and made sure everything was running smoothly despite the full house. Thank you Mel for a superb dinning experience!!!

We opted for the 9-course tasting menus and she had the beer, wine and sake pairing.  I've been fortunate enough to have a lot of tasting menus at some pretty spectacular restaurants but this one might just take the cake.  There were dishes that would literally take our breath away.  Absolutely stunning execution.  Delicious, fresh sashimi that was hands down the best I ever had.  Same with the A5 Wagyu.  I've had Wagyu all kinds of different ways but this was mind-blowing.\n\nI can't say enough great things about our wonderful server, Ginnie.  She made our night and selected the sakes herself.  Being that we're from Napa and in the industry, she correctly assumed we drink loads of wine so she chose a few more sakes to pair instead of wine and they were the best I've ever had (tired of me saying that yet?).  Those pairings sealed the deal on what was truly one of the best meals of my life.

It was a holiday evening. It was restaurant week. And the place was really, really understaffed. \n\nWe sat at the bar which was pretty crowded...and there were only two bartenders on for the night. Service was slow - so so so slow. By the time we were finally able to grab one of them to order food, 20 minutes had passed. It took another 35 minutes to get our full order out, and they missed a few things the first time around. When we asked how long we should expect for our missing salad and sushi dish, we got a salty, stressed out response of: \"well I don't know, we're way understaffed and the kitchen is really busy right now so it might be awhile.\" We arrived at 6pm and didn't leave until well after 8pm - it was ridiculous.\n\nAs an open comment to the managers of this place: Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves for leaving your staff hanging like that on a holiday.

My fianc\u00e9 has been here many times, but I found the food to be much better than the service.   The waitstaff definitely needs to sharpen their attention to detail.  In particular, the blonde waitress dropped off miso soup at the table and scurried away yet failed to realize I had no spoon or way of enjoying the soup.   Likewise, I felt the plating could have been better if the food runners weren't in such a rush and hurry to drop off the plate of food that the sides of the plate wouldn't appear so sloppy and messy.  Even the dessert appeared sloppy and messy upon being placed on the table.   \n\nLastly, I had a hard time understanding the waiter who spoke really quickly and didn't make eye contact.  Again, attention to details!!!\n\n\nOverall, I would definitely eat here again, but I would specify wanting a good server versus a random server who just happens to have his or her turn next for a table.  I would give this place a B- based on my dining experience.\n\nI definitely prefer being seated in the middle of the restaurant near the sushi bar.  The tables have a much prettier backdrop than the back of the restaurant which made me feel like I was being seated in a cafeteria.

The (free for Kimpton guests) house sake was better than I thought it would be (as a house sake).

Any miso soup I have after this MUST be like this otherwise I will be sad. Best miso soup I've ever had BUT I love scotch and it smells like scotch so yeah.. \n\nThe seaweed salad ($12) was very good too. Great flavours and a good serving size.  \n\nThe sea bass (Suzuki, $30) was a very small plate. The portion of sea bass is minuscule while there are some root veggies on the side (kohlrabi and something brown, possibly beets). The sauces were delicious. I wish there was more of everything on my plate. It left me wanting more. This is the only down side.   \n\nEverything was delicious, some items were impressive and better than others I've had in the past, but the portion of sea bass was too small. \n\nIf you are staying at the Kimpton then I would say definitely come here!

Duh.  Well this place is 5 stars despite the fact that I don't like Sushi, but I have an 8-year old that loves it.  Great atmosphere with good views, but what makes this place off the charts is the high quality sushi that even a non-sushi guy like myself can appreciate.  Also had the Shabu Shabu which was good, but could have used salt.  Obviously not cheap ($250 for me and two kids with only one beer), but not surprising given how high the quality is.

Good thing it was a company lunch. Came here the other day with a party of 10 after making reservations the day before. We were given a private room with a traditional table which is supposed to fit 12 (the table is somewhat small and no idea how 12 people would fit... 10 fit perfectly). All of us forgot to take off our shoes before entering and it wasn't until in the middle of the meal that I asked the waitress. She said it was fine (how awkward would it have been if we all got up and took off our shoes?).\n\nIt's kind of a tradition for us to order a bunch of appetizers and share. Unsure of what to order, we asked the waitress if the chef can put something together. Let me tell you, it was one plate after another (x2, one for each side of the table). Plates filled with fresh sashimi, nigiri (if you don't like wasabi, be sure to tell them to take it out), rolls, pork gyoza, vegetable gyoza, and garlic edamame. I ordered a Chirashi ($35), which is sushi rice and fresh raw fish.\n\nMost of my coworkers ordered bento boxes which were about $20 (or less). They do not come with miso soup, which can be a little disappointing because bentos elsewhere usually do. Our meal could have easily been affordable if it weren't for the lavish amount of appetizers that filled us up. I'm not complaining, the food was so delicious and we got to really experience flavorful and quality Japanese food.\n\nHaving a large party means 20% tip to your bill. A little cute there's an additional line for additional tip if your heart desires. Service was on point and we had 2 waitresses serving us along with another person who took helped clear our dishes. \n\nBathroom talk.. So amazing..

I saw the description of the Seafood Hot Pot and it sounded great.  I was thinking some nice seafood, misc veggies and a light sipping broth. The menu reads:\n\"sablefish, Kauai prawns, salmon and scallops in a seafood broth with assorted vegetables \"\n\nHowever, what I got was this elaborate lava fire rock with a bowl of steaming brown broth on top.  You couldn't eat directly from the bowl...way to hot.  Instead you had to dish it into an empty bowl, wait for it to cool, add some rice and some sauce and eat.  Then repeat over and over.  Kind of tedious.  However, I could have lived with that.  \n\nThe real problem was that the sablefish was just bland/plain white fish about 2 inches square.  I ate that and hoped the rest was better...it was not.  The 2 shrimp were thrown in whole with the head and tail attached.  This was very difficult to eat with chop sticks and hands.  It was way too hot to pick up and by the time I finally cracked one open, it was mushy on the inside and inedible.  Same with the second one.  There was no scallop in the dish.  There was no salmon in the dish.  All that remained was overcooked cabbage.  Not mixed veggies, just nasty cabbage.\n\nTo add to my misery, the main ingredient was tofu.  I hate tofu and would never order something that contained it...never mind being the most prominent ingredient.  It is not even in the description?\n\nLastly, the broth was completely bland, boiling (literally) and not something you would eat.\n\nSo, for $35 I ate 1 piece of white fish and a bowl of rice. And left hungry!  (i tried the cabbage, but left 90% behind)\n\nI was really disappointed.  It was the worst meal I have ever been served in a nice restaurant. \n\nThat being said, the other people at the table ordered sushi and said it was good.

The first plate had fresh slices of tuna juxtaposed with green avocado. The other was a seared version served with seaweed salad. Overall, nice presentation and solid dishes. \n\nThe slow braised prime short ribs with daikon cooked in a miso glaze sauce was so mouth wateringly delish that there really are no words to describe it.

The prices are very steep and the seating was really uncomfortable so by the end of our meal my back was aching to leave.\n\nWe started off our meal with the garlic edamame.  Oh...my....god!!!  How did they make a vegetable taste so amazing?  I must always have roasted garlic on my edamame!  I stuck with the prosecco while the others at our table ordered innovative cocktails.  Their cocktails were so good, but so expensive!!!  \n\nOur table ordered several sushi rolls including the spicy tuna roll, spicy scallop roll, orange dragon roll, and the yuyake roll.  Most of the rolls were $11-20 (a tad too expensive).  My husband got a four pieces of nigiri that cost over $30!  The spicy rolls really were spicy which I loved, but my in-laws hated; so be warned if you cannot handle spice!  While the orange dragon roll was amazing I felt that it was hard to justify the price.\n\nWe ordered the chocolate fondu, kuromitsu cheesecake, and the green tea ice cream for dessert.  I loved the cheesecake, but could have skipped the other two desserts.\n\nGreat sushi, but the bill was a bit brutal at the end of our meal so I couldn't see myself being a regular no matter how good the food is.", "author": "Michelle M."}

I forgot my umbrellas there and called twice afterwards that I'd pick it up and said specifically it's blue and had my company name on it.  She said sure come pick it up and I asked her to keep it for me.  Apparently she did not keep it and let someone took it.  I had someone walked all the way there to pick it up (and checked with her one hour beforehand and she said yes there are bunch of umbrella here) and when we got there, there is none.  She then told me \"ask your company to give you another one\".  That's none of her business and if she cannot keep it, don't say it.  I don't have to walk all the way there and wait my time.

Last two attempts at ordering omakase --expecting special fish, thin cuts, piece-by-piece service --have resulted in lackluster results. Lately I've gotten pre-cut fish and nothing special: tuna, salmon, eel. \n\nTo be fair, the fish is fresh and fine. But usually when I ask for omakase and include some guidance such as: 'let's start with ankimo, then some sashimi --particularly anything different and fun --and move on to nigiri' the chef usually has fun with the order. \n\nThat hasn't been the case at Ozumo lately. It feels like they are going through the motions and cranking out what I'd disappointingly call supermarket sushi. \n\nAt my most recent visit, I uncomfortably raised my concerns with my server. She actually explicitly said we'd be doing a piece-by-piece tasting. The first course ended up being a plate of tuna, eel and salmon from the kitchen. When the bill came, I was charged for multiple toros --to be clear, there was no toro all night. The manager offered to comp part of the bill. Honestly, I would have preferred they hear the feedback in earnest.", "author": "Nick D."}

Real certified Kobe beef here - not that cross-breed bovine other restaurants pass off as Kobe. Have any doubts and Mel Collins will break out the certificate for that particular cut of beef and show it to you. Service is personal and attentive but not overwhelming. Genuinely friendly. The whole experience was pretty emotional. This can be SanFran-spendy to very expensive but you get the same restaurant experience in its entirety. Excellent variety of sake you wont get just anywhere and other libations genuinely Japanese. They have a more social setting in the front of the store, group tables and then more family style in the back near a hugh sushi bar. Top notch front of house to the kitchen.

We asked the conceirge for their suggestion and they recommended Ozumo. It was only rated 3 1/2 stars so I was a little leery but we trusted them. We asked them to make a reservation for us and heavily tipped the concierge - ended up being totally worth it  because after a 15 minute wait we were given the 'private' glass room in the middle of the restaurant! Super cool! Glass walls of floor to ceiling shelving filled with sake! We looked and felt VIP all the way!\n\nWe had a group of 6 so we ordered and ate family style - everyone sharing with everyone. Our waiter was super nice giving us plenty of suggestions. Every single thing we ate seemed to be better than the last. Our taste buds were begging for more. We even ended up reordering one dish and adding 2 more rolls and 2 more orders of sashimi before we could call it quits.\n\nHere's what we tried:\nEdamame - fresh soybeans served warm with garlic-soy (2 orders)\nYamabuki - fresh uni and shimeji mushroom genmai risotto\nOzumo - grilled unagi and cucumber roll topped with snow crab, tuna, avocado and spicy sauce\nSekiwake - spicy tuna roll with tobiko, tempura flakes, salmon and hamachi with peanut sauce\nHamachi Maki - hamachi, avocado, cucumber, tempura flakes, jalape\u00f1o, roasted garlic miso sauce\nHanabi - hamachi, avocado, warm ginger-jalape\u00f1o ponzu (3 orders of this!!)\nSpicy Tuna Roll\nGyu Kakuni - Slow braised prime short ribs, spring vegetables, savory aka miso sauce\n\nBy far our favorites were the the Hanabi, the Ozumo and the Gyu Kakuni (the ribs). We didn't try any of their sake but they had a HUGE selection, the menu was pages and pages and the bottles surrounded us!\n\nWe loved the royal treatment here, and the food was truly amazing! It was pretty pricey, but usually is for quality sushi at an upscale restaurant. I would eat here again in a heartbeat.", "author": "Kayla M."}

On one occasion, my husband and I walked out of the restaurant because we were not seated within 30 min (Their manager apologized but didn't fix the problem and we still ended up eating somewhere else.) \n\nAnother time,  I had to wait over 40 min even with a resa - \n\nso a little better table flow would be appreciated.

I could definitely see a wave of fans swarming up to the counter once people tried the bite and told their friends about it. The meat was tender enough to fall apart even using chopsticks. The daikon chunks were tender like potato. If Asian soul-food (as in reach into your soul and warm you up) is what you're looking for, this dish fits the bill.

It was a nice surprise having a table with a beautiful view of the bay. The decor was impressive, clean, and the ambiance takes you away from the hustle of the Embarcadero. From the dishware, flatware, and lighting every piece is perfectly placed. It was a bit crowded and the noise level low to moderate, but tolerable to talk with friends easily. Although it was a busy night it did not go unnoticed how attentive and professional the wait staff remained. We had a great server (Zeon) who took care of everyone. The calm service persisted thoughtful the dinner with stellar recommendations from the staff.  I was served the Gyu Filet which was fantastic.

We waited over an hour for our food to come. The kids got their food about 15 minutes after us. It was so bad the kids started complaining and fussing and crying and kept asking when the food was going to be ready. We didn't even order that much. We even complained,um still bad service!!! Bill came up to about $450 n plus gratuity was included which i refused to pay because we didn't get any type of customer service whatsoever. Being over priced and having no kind of customer service, they should of removed that damn gratuity fee. I complained and argued and they still\ndidnt remove it.

Furthermore, I was very clear and specific about instructions with our table's nigiri order (repeated twice to the waiter to have wasabi served on the side and not under the fish) but it was completely ignored. Even though they offered to correct it, the restaurant took a short cut and tried to clean up their mistake by scraping off the wasabi.

You also pay more for the better ambiance and design of the restaurant. Ozumo fits the bill.\n\nOzumo is a super trendy japanese restaurant that is beautifully designed inside and out. Everything looked really modern and expensive. The venue is pretty big going from stuert street entrance and has a view of the Embarcadero in the rear.  I def recommend making a reservation since it does get packed on the weekend. All the waiters are super nice and friendly. My friends even took pictures with them. haha.\n\nSo we ended up ordering a 3 course meal. \n\nShort ribs: They are braised in till really tender and is cooked in a savory traditional beef sauce. Cooked perfectly. \n\nHamachi and salmon:The rolls are pretty average with the exception that they use higher quality fish in their rolls. The roll creations are pretty standard tho to most sushi restaurants in SF.\n\nRice Pudding: I was pretty surprised when the rice pudding came out. It is topped with fresh ice cream and this sweat fried chip which almost taste like a crust on top of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nThe sak\u00e9 is amazing. Way more expensive options. I normally drink the cheap stuff, but their sak\u00e9 selection is something you sip on and not shoot. \n\nI had a great time at Ozumo.

Our waiter was charming, extremely helpful, incredibly knowledgeable, and yet seamless. The extensive sake menu was daunting, but we got a solid recommendation. \n\nThe local is split into two section with very different atmospheres. At the front, it feels like an upscale bar with dimmed lights and high chairs; in the back, the sushi bars and tables make it feel more like a restaurant. We were sitting in the restaurant portion, but I think the front would have been a little more interesting, yet also louder, so perhaps it depends on the purpose of the dinner. \n\nThe food was all good, but nothing really stood out to me. The bill ended up being ~$100 a person (including drinks), so perhaps I would have liked to be wowed just a bit more. \n\nA favorite at our table was the Spanish octopus appetizer. It was perfectly cooked and tender. \n\nThe sashimi we tried was very fresh. I was a bit disappointed though that the scallop and sea urchin were served atop a slice of orange. The very typical flavor from the orange really overpowered (and I would argue ruined) the more subtle flavors of those two items. \n\nWe also tried a couple of rolls which were definitely needed to fill us up. They were good, and not TOO expensive, but  none of them really stood out. \n\nIf you can afford it, Ozumo is worth a look.

We decided on sushi and I found this place on Yelp. Odd, when we showed up, I realized I had been here before. Great experience the first time, so I was stoked to be here again!\n\nWe opted to sit at the sushi bar in the back of the restaurant - a little more intimate than the super trendy, SF scene in the front. As much as I love to dress up and as much as I love to visit SF - I'm a flip flops and beach hair type girl. It is too buttoned up, New York-ish in the front of the house for me on this dinner date. Plus, much quieter in the back. \n\nI had a nice buzz going before dinner and I wanted to keep it going! Sake flights! Sign me up! My girl had the Light & Fresh flight and I opted for the Richness & Depth fight. We sipped from each others. Hers were definitely lighter and easier on the palette - tasted like rose petals and citrus juices. My flight was vivid and fun with unexpected flavors, but accompanied our sushi very well.\n\nWe ordered some salmon and yellowtail sushi and some assorted rolls - Yuyake, Sekiwake, and the Hamachi Maki. The sushi was melt in your mouth quality and the rolls fresh, but nothing super inventive - for that I knocked a star off. \n\nI enjoyed my time here and my colleague and I had many laughs enjoying a great time away from the work crowd. Will be back when visiting SF in the future.", "author": "Gia R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-27", "description": "I dislike to throw in 3 stars among a sea of 4 and 5 stars, but I have to be honest about experience and expectations. The decor/ambience of the restaurant is very hip and swanky, suitable for a drink date, dinner date, or business dinner.  For us, we walked in on a Saturday night with one expectation - to be rocked by West Coast sushi and sashimi.\n\nMy husband and I are seasoned sushi eaters and usually go for omakase at reputable eateries regardless of price.  In this case, we have to report that we were not in love with the moriawase. The server asked if we wished for quantity or quality, and we chose quality. The items that came out on the plate, not piece by piece even though we were sitting at the bar and it was not busy by the way, were not higher quality cuts nor presented and seasoned for a knowing palate. We got the young chef the first time. \n\nWhen we ordered more pieces, we got the older chef, who took the time to season and present the pieces, and those tasted better. Perhaps, to the Chef or server's eyes, we did not look experienced so they thought to throw us the lesser cuts and put less effort to serving it until the older guy heard us whisper to each other? This is the touristy area of SF and also home of many \"techno-riche\", please do not underestimate someone for wearing t-shirt and jeans, so long as they act politely.  The couple next to us were in cocktail attire but didn't know their aji from their ebi, so remember that looks do not tell you about a diner's palate nor experience.\n\nWe finished with the chocolate cake and green tea ice cream, which was delicious and beautifully presented. As a nice bonus, we received an extra scoop of green tea ice cream for staying at the Harbor Court hotel next door. It was a nice sized dessert for my husband and I to share.\n\nWill we return to this restaurant? Perhaps after we hear that they have a better source for their seafood or they receive more raving reviews for their sushi/sashimi from experienced eaters. Weird thing is that our Uber driver said he stayed in Osaka for 2 years and loved Ozumo's sushi and there are plenty of reviews on here that praise their sushi and sashimi.  Next time, I will try to get rezzies at a sushi spot known for their omakase or take an Uber to Ichi.\n\nThank you for the excellent FOH customer service, beautiful decor, and yummy dessert.", "author": "Siu L."}

The food is top notch. I've always believed that the true judge of a sushi place is the simple nigiri - where you don't hide the quality of your fish behind lots of sauces and ingredients. We had a nice sampling of nigiri this time round (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PNxwbgtfdpldd3CyJFIw3w?select=Eut7D1NMW7ydB9Chtj2n-w) and as expected, they did not dissapoint. It's visual ecstacy to see all that wonderfully fresh fish lined up like that. The salmon belly was hands-down amazing. Nice and fatty but instantly melts in your mouth. \n\nThe bentos are a good choice here too if you want a little bit of variety. The Mifune bento offers a nice mix of nigiri and rolls if you want sushi. We also split a bowl of Udon (can't remember the name but it was also a special for the day) this last trip and I must admit that was one of the sweetest, most tastiest broths I've had the pleasure to slurp. It was a nice combination of crab, pork, and veggies that created said delightful broth. \n\nI'm still torn about Ozumo. It's a cavernous and fussy place for sushi - not my favorite per se, but gosh darn it Ozumu is just plain dependably good and that's why I'll probably be back again. Pay attention to your server when they mention the daily specials using Japanese phrases you won't remember after - it's probably something good.", "author": "Jon L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-24", "description": "I think what'll keep me coming back to Ozumo is not their sushi or their sashimi, but their desserts. On a scale of one to fantastic, I would place Ozuma's dishes slightly above average. The sushi, sashimi, and cooked fish all tasted very fresh, and the meat of the Futago was definitely tender, but everything seemed very standard, and nothing really made me go \"wow.\"I will, however, commend the chefs the consistently stunning presentation of each plate. Now, moving on to the dessert round...\n\nI am the type of person who considers dessert to be the most important part of a meal: everything that is served before dessert is an appetizer, as dessert is my main course. Up until dessert, I felt that our meal was decent at best. However, once our dessert came, everything changed. My friends and I made the mistake of ordering one dessert each (there were 4 of us total that day), but that was probably one of the best mistakes we had ever made. Definitely no regrets were had that night... We ordered one order each of the Choco Chan, Kuromitsu Cheesecake, Rice Pudding, and Chocolate Fondue served with bread and fruit. While 2 of my friends absolutely fell in love with the rice pudding, my favorites were definitely the Choco Chan and Kuromitsu Cheesecake. No doubt, the rice pudding was delicious in that it was perfectly light, creamy, and not too sweet, but I definitely like my desserts rich and dense, so the Choco Chan and cheesecake were what won me over. The Choco Chan is served with a generous scoop of green tea ice cream that counters the richness of the chocolate in the cake quite nicely. The cheesecake was dense and wasn't too fluffy, which I loooooved.\n\nSo all in all, decent but pricey \"food\" food, but the desserts just steal the show.", "author": "Gaby W."}

We ordered a bunch of stuff to try from. We started with the garlic edamame and Hanachi which were delicious! The garlic edamame was flavorful and it just made me want to keep the entire shell of the peas in my mouth until I have sucked off all the flavor. We also had the Tuna Tartare which lacked a bit of flavor; bland - but it went well with the flavorful garlic edamame so it was a good balance. We also ordered oysters which were 6 small ones for $20. They didn't taste fresh, were small, and we only had a slice of lemon - which wasn't enough and wont be ordering that again. We also ordered two rolls - Bucho which was avocado with shrimp tempura & crab, which was not bad but nothing I haven't tasted before. Also had the lobster roll which was super unique aesthetically and tasted awesome - the lobster was fresh and soft along with the tuna, tobiko and the sauce to dip in. Too bad there's only 4 pieces. We also ordered the fish of the day which had the fish fried with the fish meat and bones separated. It came with mushrooms and BACON - which made every bite of the fish that much more awesome with some bacon alongside it. I thought the fish lacked flavor as well, but the bacon made up for it. We also had tuna nigiri which melted in our mouths. But my ultimate favorite dishes came at the very end of the meal - the A5 Waygu beef and Green Tea Panna Cotta dessert! The beef is the most amazing piece of beef I have ever tasted (since this is my first A5 beef too so I dont know if that's saying much). The beef was a really small slice, and between 4 people, we only had about 2 pieces each. The beef was so soft and not chewy like meat usually is. We bit down and it just melts in your mouth! The truffle sea salt and the matcha powder on the beef were AH-MAZING! The beef made my night! To top that off, we had the green tea dessert, which was like a green tea flavored flan. It was super delicate and soft, but not too sweet so I enjoyed every bite. I cleared my plate! The chewy nut part on the side (sort of like a peanut brittle) was my least favorite in the dessert since it stuck to my teeth when I chewed it, but it was one of highlights to this meal. Definitely want to come back for that beef :)", "author": "Amanda C."}

Maybe, we will love the food too? Well, once we walked in, people were sitting at the bars and tables enjoying their happy hours. As we walked further in, we see a wall of sake with more tables. On the other side of the wall of sake was where the sushi bar was. We were excited to try the food there. This week showcased their new spring menu. It included some new items and some old (so says our waitress). I would have to say, we went with our waitresses recommendations and they turned out pretty well. So, let me try and remember these dishes. By the way, some of the dishes were from the omakase selection. Yummy!\n\nToro Tuna Belly-was delicious!\n\nAnago- a bit dry, but ok.\n\nArtichokes-the artichokes were tasty. Hint: squeeze the lemon over it. It's better with the lemon. It gives the artichokes a kick.\n\nHanabi-typical slices of hamachi with ponzu. The jalapeno taste in the jalapeno ponzu makes it unique.\n\nHotate-Seared scallops. They were very tasty!\n\nYuki?-pork over cabbage. Delicious. The meat was so tender and the cabbage underneath it complemented the pork.\n\nBeef tartare-raw beef? Yum! It had other condiments to add in with the tartare, if you chose to add it in.\n\nAzuki bean beignets with ice cream-I love beignets, but beignets filled with azuki bean. How yummy!\n\nTaro bread pudding with ice cream-this dessert was good, but I love the beignets more!\n\nOn top of all this food and dessert, we also had a bottle of sake.

I fall in the latter category since I like to eat quantity with decent quality, but once above a certain threshold quality all tastes very similar to me.

But this is a fancy place so I held back. \n\nNext was the Hanabi, which was slices of hamachi and avo with ginger jalapeno ponzu sauce. Wow! It was heavenly. Things just kept getting better. \n\nWe ordered 2 sushi rolls, one was the Sekiwake (spicy tuna with tobiko, salmon, hamachi and peanut sauce). If you think that peanut sauce & sushi don't mix, well you would be wrong! The other roll was the Akebono (toro, avo, & asparagus). Both rolls were so incredibly fresh & the fish just melted away in our mouths. \n\nLast but not least came the assorted nigiri (tako, maguro, hamachi) for hubby & salmon sashimi for me. I literally collapsed with every bite. No, really. Have you even eaten something so delicious it makes you swoon? Yep, that was me. I fell in love with the salmon sashimi. I told my hubby I wanted to take it home with me. \n\nWhat's a fancy dinner without dessert? We ordered the melon creme brulee. What was interesting about this dish was that the melon slices were actually caramelized with the creme brulee coating. The slices sat in a sweet tapioca broth with some sorbet on the side. Light, refreshing, & a perfect end to an incredible meal. \n\nOur waiter was more than accommodating & knew the sake menu like the back of his hand. The overall feeling of this restaurant is fancy, yet casual & not pretentious at all. My kind of place.", "author": "Erin S."}

Normally I just check reviews for recommendations but don't post my own but I was so sad at the poor experience my wife and I had at Ozumo that I had to write. I dined here around the 4th of July weekend and was really excited to be back. I have eaten here before and had a really incredible experience. Until a week ago.\n\nMy wife, who is Japanese, and I had a few dishes that were ok. Kama which was good, toro sashimi which was ok. But then I ordered some simple sushi - Ikura and Uni, my wife's favorites. The Ikura had the telltale signs being previously frozen and it had no taste or texture. We both commented that it didn't taste right and I trust my wife's taste buds.  The Uni wasn't much better. I'm guessing freshness was the issue.\n\nFinally we had the hot pot and it was just plain bad. Incredibly bland and poorly executed.\n\nTo have one dish miss is one thing. But several dishes given the prices is just unacceptable. In the fog of trying to remember a meal I'd rather forget I seem to recall having Agedashi Tofu and the tempura on the tofu felt heavy and overcooked.\n\nGiven the abundance of sushi places in San Francisco, I'll drop Ozumo for any number of better places at better prices.

I would normally rate this place between three to four stars as the service tends to be great, but the food is greatly overpriced for what you receive. Also, the food is okay, but certainly not near the greatest I've ever had (particularly for a sushi restaurant in SF). \n\nThe ONE STAR is a direct result of how the management handled a particular incident that left both me and my party so highly offended that we will never return. \n\nTo be as brief as possible, my party entered and as we were being shown to our table, another group of patrons were shouting cat-calls and other crass comments at the women in our group. One individual in the group continued to make comments after I calmly (and repeatedly) asked him to \"please show some respect & be a gentleman.\" \n\nTwo managers arrived and the head manager gruffly told me \"to be a gentleman [myself] and find my table,' by which I was greatly taken aback. He was defending the lewd behavior of other patrons during a non-confrontational exchange. At our table, he arrived and told me that I should not be offended as they are just a bunch of guys out having fun and that my friends would do the same thing (basically calling me a hypocrite while again defending rowdy, degrading behavior). Although he offered us a free round of Sake, no other real apology was offered and no corrective action was taken. \n\nI would expect this kind of behavior in a dive bar, possibly, but not a restaurant that bills itself as a, \"destination for connoisseurs of libations as well as discerning epicureans.\" If you're looking for a good restaurant in SF that is more upscale and worth the price, I might recommend trying elsewhere.", "author": "Erik C."}

I work in the financial district and go to Ozumo regularly. I have been a fan of their food and service is generally delicious. (To give you an idea, I sometimes go 3x a week!) However, my experience today at lunch left much room to be desired. I am seeing a lot of new wait staff and the quality has most definitely declined in the past few years. As a loyal patron for many years, I was beyond disappointed.\n\nWe were a party of 2 and were seated promptly, which was great. When our server came to take our drink orders, we told her that we were ready to order food as well, as one of us was on a time constraint today. Our server acknowledged that and took our orders (gyoza, and 2 gyu bentos - one medium rare and one medium well). It was very odd that our server decided to whisper everything. We had to ask her to repeat what she said after every sentence. After she took our orders, she did not show up again until the very end. Never once did she check on us; it wasn't until I had flagged her down to get our check that she actually talked to us again.\n\nAfter we placed our orders, the gyozas took another 25 minutes to arrive, which was unseasonably slow. The gyozas tasted very bad; the filling was dry and the outside was covered in a ton of oil. After that, it took another 15-20 minutes for our bentos to arrive. My dining companion's medium well order turned out to be completely well done; my medium well was charred on the outside but completely raw on the inside. The meat was simply too raw for my taste and so I sent it back. Another 10 minutes went by and a new bento was brought to me. But wait, I got the same beef that's been thrown back on the grill or something (they were already sliced) and drenched in sauce. Instead of preparing another piece of beef appropriately, it was evident that someone just cooked the sliced beef some more and tried to cover it up by adding a ton of sauce. The amount of sauce was appalling; it literally covered the meat. I was forced to send that back again and my order finally arrived another 10 minutes later, after I had to follow up a couple times. I basically had to scarf down my food and rush back into the office.\n\nThe server apologized half heartedly when I told her what happened. And not that I was looking for any monetary compensation, but after I had to send food back twice, and kept longer that I normally would have, I would expect a place like Ozumo to offer some form of gesture to make it right for their customers. But nothing. They did not do anything to make me feel that I am a valued customer and as such, I doubt I will be going back often, and will be taking all my business meetings in neighboring restaurants moving forward, for fear that Ozumo will provide an embarrassing experience.", "author": "Vivian K."}

I tried the Ozumo ramen, which is a pork and seafood broth with egg noodles, fish, fish cake, bamboo. I also added an egg. The broth was quite delicious, everything else was very standard. Not bad at all. The ramen was $17 (plus some extra for the egg, I think). \n\nOverall, I don't regret it, but I would think twice before picking this place.", "author": "Mary N."}

Over the past few years I've been trying to prove this idea wrong, and was hoping that Ozumo would be a case study against this premise. I am sad to say, however, that after dining at Ozumo it is becoming clearer and clearer that SF simply doesn't have it together in the sushi department.\n\nWe were seated promptly at 6 p.m. on Friday night. The bar area was super busy, while the rest of the place was about 3/4 full. I was immediately disappointed that all nigiri orders had a 2-piece minimum. It is well known that true sushi connoisseurs order single nigiris, so I immediately filed this place in the \"dabbler\" category. And after looking at the chefs -- they were all under the age of 30 -- I got the \"training day\" vibe as it's clear that relative beginners are preparing the sushi at Ozumo.\n\nThose observations aside, it was time for the food. I ordered toro sushi, albacore sushi, salmon belly sushi (one of their specials), sweet shrimp sushi and anago sushi. Of those five varieties, only the salmon belly was delectable. Everything else was good, but nothing stunning, which was a disappointment considering the hefty expense.\n\nIn conclusion, I won't be returning to Ozumo. The decor is very nice, and the view of the Bay Bridge is superb. However when it comes to sushi I am seeking a life-affirming experience. You will not find anything close to that at Ozumo, or in San Francisco at all seemingly.", "author": "Phillip J."}

We were highly disappointed with Ozumo.\n\nSushi was fishy and not fresh, needed extra soy sauce to wash it down and we truly thought it might be so bad we could get sick.  I've never until now ordered toro that I actually didn't want to eat because it was that bad.  We ordered the hanabi appetizer, toro and salmon nigiri, the four vegetables and a couple of the rolls and both agreed the hanabi was the only item that actually tasted okay.  With the caliber this restaurant is supposed to be, the food should not taste the way it does.  The sushi that I've gotten from Whole Foods market has always been substantially better than everything I ate at Ozumo.  This should not be the case with a restaurant like this. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly overpriced for food that was truly inedible and not authentic Japanese in any way.   \n\nThere are so many great finds in the city that this place is not at all worth it.

I asked for green tea, assuming it would be free (our waitress did NOT tell me it would be at a charge).  I started to get worried when each person that asked for tea got their own pot (very nice looking iron pot).  When the bill came, I was shocked that they charged $6.  Can you imagine if a sushi restaurant in Japan charged money for 'agari' (hot tea)?  If you are not familiar with Japanese food culture, you might be thinking, 'why is Toro E. getting so upset about this?'  For me, charging $$$ for green tea at a sushi restaurant is a crime!!! It's not right.\n\nNote that I got this $6 tea treatment during lunch at Ozumo.  I could have had a full meat at The Taco Truck for $6!!!!\n\n-----------------------------\nI just learned that the name Ozumo is actually written in Kanji as O-O-Zu-MO, which means Big Sumo.  Which means you need to pronounce it with a long 'O', like OOOZumo.\n\nMy math for Ozumo:\n\n+ 1 Star for amazing interior design.\n+ 1 Star for fresh seafood, including sushi.\n+ 1 Star for excellent appetizer --- try their Hanabi.\n+ 1 Star for proximity to my home.\n+ 1 Star for offering Kirin and Sapporo beer on draft.\n- 1 Star for portion size.\n-----------------------------------------------\n4 Stars Total\n\nI expected that a nice restaurant like Ozumo would charge high prices on their meals, but most of their menu items were below $20, perhaps to provide a perception that prices are reasonable.  You quickly find out that a $20 doesn't get you much as their portions are extremely small, so you end up getting a bunch of other things.  I know that fresh-quality food isn't cheap, so I just wished they would give you more food and have the prices on the menu reflect that.\n\nLUNCH:  Although it's pricier than lunch at places in Rincon Center, lunch deals at Ozumo is much more reasonably priced than their dinner.  Many items are $12-15 range with some around $20.  Their three course pre-fixe lunch is $22.  Kurosawa bento ($19) came in a box with 5 compartments which included sushi and sashimi.  Their vegetable curry don ($13) was quite unique (which doesn't mean good) with yellow colored rice with mild curry with lots of vegetables.  I could see some people liking it, but it won't be ranked high in my top Japanese Curry List.  Tonkatsu Bento ($15) came with pork, which was on the thin side, with higiki, boiled veggi, salad, and for some reason, edamame.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

Their sashimi is always fantastic, but last time we got a local albacore tuna (on their daily special), and it was amazing. I always prefer albacore or fatty tuna over round eye, but this albacore was like stuff made from butter. It was soft, slightly sweet, and so fresh. \n\nWe always order a couple of sushi rolls too, but their rolls are so-so. It's good, but there are more interesting things to get on the menu.\n\nWe also always get their four small plates of vegetables. They're usually okay, but last time we were their, their egg plant dish was seriously lacking. It was tough and still had a bitter undercooked flavor. My boyfriend's mother loved their okra. \n\nThe boyfriend ordered a black cod entree, which was seared. It was just done, maybe even a very slight tinge under down. It was really good, but the boyfriend claims that \"it is the best first [he's] ever eaten.\"\n\nI'm sure our bill is always a few hundred dollars because there's wine, drinks, way too much food, and desserts.

When you initially walk in, it seems like a small, dark lounge, but then you're led up a few steps into the dining area, and it's HUGE, and gorgeous.  Very modern and perfectly lit with a large sushi bar in the center.  Big windows give you a beautiful view of the Bay Bridge.\n\nI'll start by saying that the food is not so much more mind-blowing than your next Japanese restaurant, but the ambiance does make it that much more enjoyable.  I always have their uni risotto, and usually throw in an assortment of nigiri.  They offer fish that you may not see at an average sushi bar, since they do bring in a lot of specials.  Everything has always been super fresh and beautifully presented.\n\nI wouldn't go with their sushi rolls.  They're a little overpriced for what they are (not that they aren't tasty).  Their beef tataki was a bit of a let down for me... just a little overcooked.  Their tuna tartare and Hamachi appetizers are great selections to start off with.\n\nGreat sake selection, and very professional staff.  I highly recommend Ozumo for special occasions.", "author": "Gina L."}

When I called to make reservations, I was so disappointed that the next available time for dinner was 9:15pm on a Saturday night!  Makes you think that this must be a real good restaurant and it didn't fail me after we had one of the best sushi and great service at this establishment!\n\n First of all, they offered me the sushi bar if we wanted to come in earlier and since we really wanted sushi, I said fine!  They reserved the sushi bar for us which usually never happens in a sushi restaurant as the bar seating is first come first served.  When we arrived, they logistically seated the three of us in a corner of the sushi bar seating so we could still face each other while eating!  They were very welcoming and accommodating and our server was most knowledgeable of their menu and offered great suggestions.\n\nNeedless to say, we had a great dining experience here and the food was superb, fish super fresh and the restroom had learning Japanese broadcasted loud and clear!!!  They had fancy and interesting cocktail drinks which were fantastic!  The prices was kinda high but it was so worth it!

This was served over a bed of avocado and topped with caviar.  Yummy!  Also had the Giddy Geisha x2 (fruity lychee goodness!!).  \n\n4 vegetable medley--basically grilled okra (i think), eggplant, cauliflower, and kabocha squash.  The cauliflower was the best of the four.  I found the okra (or maybe they were peppers) bitter and the eggplant and squash slightly bland. \n\nLobster roll--This was delicious.  I was kind of expecting very thin slivers of lobster but they were actually quite generous with the chunks of lobster meat in the roll.  \n\nSpicy scallop roll--nothing special but very good.\n\nBlack cod--We ordered this upon the recommendation of our waiter.  The fish was cooked to perfection--so buttery soft and full of flavor.  It was so good that I forgot what the garnish was.  \n\nHamachi roll--yes another delicious roll.  At this point, we were so stuffed that we couldn't enjoy this the way it should have been.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, we debated whether to go with the chocolate fondue (that every other table seemed to order), flourless chocolate cake, or just throw up from all the over-eating.

An order of toro and an order of the ozumo roll. \nThe night started off great..up until my lady found a long course black strand of hair in the ahi tuna tartare! It was disgusting! I immediately got the server's attention and showed him. He took it right away and apologized.  We noticed people in suits glancing our way while talking near the kitchen. Sure enough a lady came over and apologized and said 'the next fresh one is on us'.  .. Now my lady and I could have gone crazy over this but we really love this place and didn't want this to ruin our feelings for Ozumo's. \nWe finished our dinner and then ordered a dessert. I really enjoyed the green tea custard (i forgot the name). As they server brought our check he told us that the second appetizer and dessert was on the house. The total was still high. Now considering they took care of two pates..if you ask me..and you are a high end classy cuisine that generates revenue every day of the week..and you want to make sure your customers are happy and leave happy..i would think you would take care of the whole bill, not just two lousy plates!\nFinding a strand of hair in my food was very disgusting and disturbing.

Everything on their menu is relatively delicious, so it really doesn't matter too much if you sort of decide to order randomly.\nOne dish I would never forget is their uni-risotto (sea urchin risotto). Now that one is oh-ma-gah. I do not like raw sea urchin by itself and would very unwillingly pay $$$ to eat them. Risotto is meh for me, but when you combine the two together......I can eat this all night long. (negative + negative = positive) haha\nAnyways, the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because they don't validate. However, parking is convenient because they offer valet (until 11PM).", "author": "Melissa S."}

Almost everyone at the restaurant seemed to be informed of her birthday, as she would pass various busers, waiters, and hosts and they would all wish her a very Happy Birthday. \n\nThe waitstaff was extremely attentive and well informed about the menu. I usually have somewhat of a hard time finding food at most places (especially sushi places) as I am a vegetarian (and one who will not be satisfied with a \"cucumber roll\")... but not only did the waitress show me my options, she asked the chef to make me a special roll when I couldn't find anything I liked on the menu. It was absolutely delicious! It was a veggie caterpillar roll, with sweet potato tempura wrapped in rice and avocado... completely nom-worthy. \n\nWe were visited often by the manager of hospitality and even the chef himself visited our table to check on us. \n\nAll in all, this was a wonderful experience... the food was great, the service impeccable, and the location to die for with a gorgeous view of the Bay Bridge and water. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend this spot... you can't go wrong!", "author": "Arielle S."}

But if you're looking for great food, and at these prices... i expect greatness, then try Ozumo once, and move on.  \n\nDon't get me wrong.. the food was definitely good, but at no time during the meal was i awed by anything that we tried.  The tuna tataki salad was perfectly palatable as was the Hanabi we had for the appetizer.  I must say those were probably my favorite parts of the meal along with the red bean paste beignets we had for dessert.  I tried the shiromaguro, aji, hotate and Uni.... and again, all were passable, but portions were small (to be expected), prices were high and quality was simply average.\n\nI love my sushi... and after spending 300 here (including sake).. i was still left wanting more.  In my book, that should never happen.  So to review.. a definitely trendy and hip place to be seen and eat at.  And if price is no option, then maybe this is the sushi joint for you.  But for me, i want to be satisfied after my meal and not have to wonder if i should keep ordering because the nigiri is 9 bucks and that i can pop them like mentos.", "author": "Felix W."}

I don't even like eggplant and cucumber but it tasted amazing in this dish. The beef was so tender and delicious. We also got the Ozumo roll, and the tuna was so fresh and delicious, and we got the Tazuna (sp?) roll which was also really good. The salmon was really fresh tasting. Salmon nigiri was amazing, we had both the farm salmon and the sockeye and both were so fresh and melty and delicious. Freshest fish I've had at a sushi place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-14", "description": "If everything on the menu was marked down about $5 - $10, I would give Ozumo more stars. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying more for food, but quality has to always match the price. The food is good here, but not worth the prices you're paying. But I guess this is on the Embarcadero in the SOMA, so what do you expect? \n\nLast night my boyfriend and I ended up at Ozumo. We tried going to Izakaya Sozai (I know, totally in a different area) but after finding out that their wait was at least an hour and half, we said screw it.. And drove back home and walked out to the Embarcadero. We decided on Ozumo since we were still in the mood for Japanese. \n\nThe one great thing about this restaurant is the decor. When we were first waiting in the lounge for a table, I thought, \"oh.. just another typical swanky/contemporary city spot.\" But once you walk in the restaurant, the vibe completely changes. The inside of the restaurant is reminiscent of a traditional Japanese restaurant, just modernized up (lots of light colored wood, the style of the furniture, etc). I also enjoyed the view of their Sake display - gorgeous display of Sake bottles and the inside of the display case is a private dining room! Hmms, I might want to come back in a group just to sit in that room, heh. When I went to the bathroom, I noticed they have sushi boat style seating in the back - another thing I thought was cool. This restaurant has versatile yet blending rooms.\n\nAnyways, on to the food... For dinner, we had: \n\n- Dohyo: (Spicy Tuna Tatare w/chips) This dish was ok - our server suggested it as her favorite appetizer but I thought it tasted like every other Tuna Tartare I ever had. eh. \n\n- Tontoro: (braised Kurobuta pork jowels) absolutely delish - this was my favorite dish here along with the Gindara. The fat was yuhhhhhmy - definitely recommend this dish if you visit.\n\n- Gindara: (Black cod) very good dish - the fat on the fish was so delicious, sauce was good, and cooked perfectly - definitely recommend ordering this dish alongside Tontoro.\n\n- Shacho Roll: (Maine Lobster roll) this roll was creative and good, but I thought it was a bit overpriced - the roll wasn't all that amazing, just good.\n\n- Spicy Tuna Nigiri: disappointing - rice was not fresh at all, and spicy tuna wasn't that tasty\n \n- Big Eye Tuna Sashimi:  also disappointing - texture was kind of weird, was very gelatinous and okay tasting. i think it would have been better if they sliced it a little thinner. \n\nOverall, beautiful setting and some food options are great while others I would skip. From what we tried, I would definitely go with their cooked food options over their sushi - I rather go to a hole in the wall sushi joint that serves up fresh, great tasting sushi. Would I return? Yeah, maybe for the environment and the good food options - would be a nice place to take friends out for special occasions - just order the right dishes. Oh, lastly... I had their Shi-Mitsu drink - Shishito peppers w/ginger - delish! (also a bit overpriced, but nonetheless delish and creatively handcrafted)", "author": "Tiffany K."}

One of my favorite upscale sushi restaurants in the city. The food is phenomenal, always fresh, and really shows a level of care and intricacy that often finds itself absent in restaurants. Although, for the price you're paying, you really shouldn't expect any less.\n\nDinner for a party of two (without drinks) will run you approximately $90~$120 there. This includes standard tax and gratuity, an appetizer split, and a dessert. Price can easily double/triple (or more) depending on what and how much you drink.\n\nThe ambiance is amazing, trending, and fun. Decor is up to date, cozy seating arrangements, but you won't be rubbing elbows, and the lighting is perfect for eating out with friends or in an intimate setting.\n\nThe only thing that I can really knock on this place is the service. It is hit or miss (often hits, but, for the price you're paying, it needs to always hit) but there has been more than 1 occasion where I'm waiting for my waiter for 5-10 minutes. There was one instance, where we're waiting for our check and the waiter was caught up with another large party nearby. No one came, we waited probably 15+ minutes. The table next to us (a party of 2, looks to be on a date) waited the same length to get their initial drink orders in.\n\nI try to be fair in my reviews and rate an establishment based on the price I'm paying. Can't expect a fine dining experience when I'm paying for a Big Mac. On the flip side, when I'm spending hundreds (per person sometimes), I expect the very best -- don't charge that much if you can't deliver on all fronts.\n\nOverall though, still a great place to take a date and have a meal. 4 stars.", "author": "D K."}

Modern, upbeat, and a plus for me--right under the Harbour Court Hotel which is a great place to get the BEST view of the bay bridge and waters on a clear day.\n\nMy husband loves this place. We ordered two rolls, some garlic edamame (wow-so tasty and garlic-y), hamachi & maguro sashimi, and tasted three sakes before deciding on one that wasn't too dry with a tad sweetness.

But really excellent food.\n\nThe most recent time I sat at the bar on the main floor and just enjoyed being part of the energy of the space.  I had a cold sapporo which I love with my sushi, and also decided to try some cold sake.  After talking with the bar-tender, we agreed I wouldn't do a \"tasting menu\" but would taste a couple he presented and give some feedback on what I liked.  Eventually, I had some that was smooth, enjoyable and quite dry; not sure of their name, but I think the style was Gaiginyo (polished rice style?).\n\nFor food, I selected a tempure blue-crab (I've been craving soft-shelled crab, from East coast ...) which was nice, but I thought the batter was too think in some spaces.\n\nThen, I had a spider-roll, which was excellent.  Great wasabi/horseradish, and beautiful power ginger. Yes, I love to blow my mind with a lump of wasabi, ginger dipped in soy sauce - however, in my defense, this is un-related to my enjoying the sushi, which I eat separately.\n\nI also had some toro, and great rice.

In fact we seated in the Sake Room, which was a cool semi-private glass-walled room surrounded by sake bottles. \n\nThe reason why I am giving it four stars is because the sushi slight fell short of our expectations. We order an assorted sashimi dish to sample. The hamachi, uni, ebi were excellent, but the ultimate test was toro. We really expected at $10 for a piece of toro it should be out of this world. I have had the toro in my life -- it should be fresh with the right amount of fat and smooth and buttery in texture. The toro dish we had was disappointing, and in fact we had to send it back and asked for a better cut. We wouldn't mind paying for the ones we already ate. The waiter came back and told us that what we had was already the best cut of the night, and the restaurant tends to cater to the palette of Americans, who prefers leaner cuts of toro. Hmmm. That is just too bad, because most people don't really know they are missing.\n\nOh and excellent service too. Our was waiter very attentive and helpful.\n\nThe finally bill was right at the minimum charge for that room. We were glad that we were right on the mark ($100 per person with tip and tax), and 8 of us completely stuffed ourselves.\n\nAll in all, we were happy with the meal, and I will definitely return for special occasions, but really for the price the sushi does not live up to my expectations.

The servers have been attentive, but not annoyingly so.  \n\nBeware, this is a hot spot for lunch!  It gets extremely busy after 12PM.  \n\nAlso, be advised that Ozumo is a little on the pricey side for lunch.  I spent $80+ for two, and we didn't drink alcohol.  That being said, good sushi & sashimi is worth the price.  I'll definitely be back to Ozumo.  \n\n4-1/2 Star food minus 1/2 point for $$$ = FOUR Stars.", "author": "Jeffery G."}

The answer is a resounding \"yes.\"\n\nFirst, there aren't many great places SOMA to get good sushi for lunch--especially around the Embarcadero. Second, these guys are always coming up with inventive rolls, which is something they really don't have to do, since the quality of the sushi is so high that they don't really need gimmicks.\n\nThe sake list here isn't massively deep, but it's solid. They've got your Wakatake along with a good mixture of nicely and slightly-overpriced bottles.\n\nIt's tough to say what I like best--they always have great uni which isn't something I expect at most places.

It was packed so our group situated at an outside table for drinks whilst awaiting a table inside.  The MatreD was extremely courteous and Uncle Mikey and Colo went back to Americana because UM left his credit card there.  At our table they noted that the drinks they were having outside were not delivered to the table but our waiter graciously replaced them with fresh ones \"on me.\"  \n\nWe ordered indiscriminately.  Our waiter made some scrumptious suggestions which we went with, adding some rolls, sashimi, the black cod which is de rigeur, more drinks, it was a Kettle One and Soda night for me ... EVERYTHING WAS EXCELLENT.  You can't go wrong at OZUMO.\n\nA couple of platters of various nicely ripened fruit slices were delivered to our table with a elegant, clever lit device that kept the chocolate fondue dipping sauce at the perfect temperature for our salacious fruit chocolate fondue dipping ~ the perfect capper to another UM Gonzo Adventure.\n\nIt's just like Japan.

I mean, if you're trying to say \"Irashaimase,\" pretty please say it right. Better yet, spend some time in the frickin' bathroom and learn Japanese!  I'm not kidding. Go to their bathroom. You can learn some Nihongo up in there!  (I'm not Japanese but my bf and his mom are. And I'm sure they were just as annoyed as I was. Next time, we'll sit somewhere AWAY from the kitchen.) \n\nThis place is expensive. I guess you're paying for the trendy atmosphere and the view of the bay??  Can you believe their California roll is $9?! I couldn't either. Their portions are also very small. I was expecting their small dishes to blow my mind away (like Kappou Gomi) but it didn't. And where are all the Asian folks at?!  \n\nThey had a sushi omakase dinner for around $45-$50. I wanted to order it but I wasn't sure how many pieces it would come with. I was afraid I would only get 5-8 pieces.  They also had a 6 or 7 course omakase dinner for around $125.

I also got to sample my boyfriend and his mom's dish. Their sushi wasn't all that. Ive definitely had better. My hamachi kama salad was really small.  It was good but I wish they hooked me up with a bigger portion. The maku-uchi roll was pretty interesting. It was actually a negi-hama roll with jalapeno and some other stuff.

What really made Ozumo wonderful was  the attention they paid to each dish, in which the garnishes work well to make the dishes attractive and to add unique texture and flavor. I was particularly taken by the tuna tartare with avocado and caviar, which played with your palate in a way that I've never quite experienced in Asian style cuisine. The tempura crostini really did it for me, because I was tasting three different textures simultaneously with three different flavors. \n\nThe Futaro (Wagyu, eggplant, cucumber, and sprouts) was also wonderful. Again the textures are playfully put together, and it's extremely attractive on the plate like a roll would look. \n\nThe actual roll that we had was the Shacho (Lobster, mango, jalapeno, caviar, rice paper) The fruit was really unexpected, and the lobster was the freshest I've had in sushi for a long while. The jalapeno is the fusion element, and I think it again excites the palate.\n\nA fine example of their plating was the mixed tempura assortment, in which they fanned out somen and fried it to use as a centerpiece. Great use of the ingredient and great way to make tempura presentable.\n\nHowever, I really think it was overpriced. There was an extremely large party sitting to our left, which killed any sort of ambiance. The servers seemed to be a little distracted, and I think they could have been more cordial and warm. I like the separation of bar and dining area, as to make the dining experience a little quieter and intimate.", "author": "Travis L."}

This location is nice as well and offers more space.  \nOzumo is great for both the cooked food as well as for the sushi.\nWe started with the ahi tuna appetizer which was nice as well as the garlic edamame (can't go wrong with these warm yummy treats).\nI am a huge fan of kale in all forms and tried the kale salad which I was not a fan of unfortunately. It looked beautiful but I think it may have been the dressing as it was too salty for me and make it loose it's \"fresh/clean\" flavor that I love so much. The beats on the side of the salad plate were good; NOTE: both of my coworkers did infact enjoy the kale sald.\nWe then did a few different rolls - all were good but my favorite by far was Shacho - This was very fresh and had a great flavor with the cilantro. Very different role (not your typical) and all enjoyed.\nWe also had Bucho and Sekiwake - Both were very good as well.\nVery fresh fish and great experience with the food overall.\nWe even slurged and got dessert (something we rarely do) and shared a couple.  The rice pudding was very good.  The sauce they serve on the side is fantastic mixed in.  \nOverall, the service was fantastic.  Very attentive server and she wasn't too over bearing as we were sitting and conducting business there for quite a while while eating slowly and enjoying the experience.  It was just right and a wonderful atmosphere overall.\nI will definately come back for lunch and probably dinner as well.  \nAs mentoned, I love the Oakland location and I was certainly not let down with the SF location - I will come back in the evening to experience the fun of the evening experience soon :)", "author": "Kelly M."}

I mean, it was 5:30 pm and we were the first group seated, but yeah). We ordered all at once and half the sushi orders hadn't arrived after 90 minutes. After inquiring about the wait, we were told that it \"all came out at different times, there are tons of sushi chefs.\" 30 minutes later, we asked again, and were shown a confused face and no explanation. 5 minutes more and the forgotten sushi appeared. So, after about 2 hours of ordering and no apology or admission of guilt, we were able to enjoy a few more pieces of sushi. In addition, the wrong salad was brought to the table. No big deal, except the correct one wasn't delivered until 45 minutes later. \n- prices: way overpriced, but I can somewhat understand given the location on the water and overall atmosphere of the restuarant.\n\nAll in all, it was disappointing enough service not to return, especially considering the lack of apology (or any compensation in any way, though a simple sorry would have been better than nothing). That being said, the sushi is good, so it's too bad the experience was such a negative one overall.", "author": "Nicole H."}

I just moved to the area so I can understand why, everything is pricey here.  But at least you get quality.  The shima aji nigiri \"melts in your mouth\", but for $12 for 2 pieces, I hoped they were at least large pieces..but no they were tiny.\n\nThey have a large selection of fine sakes too.  Wish they had a couple less expensive sakes, I like good sake, but the cheapest glass was like $9 a glass, and they aren't large glasses (really good tho).\n\nThe girl who served me was really cute too, always a plus +++\n\nIf money grew on my house plants, I would come here all the time, but it doesn't, so I'll be limited though it will be tempting so near by.\n\n***I have to add something, when I went to the bathroom I couldn't help but bust into laughter. At first I was confused, I was hearing a Japanese voice in my head while I was peeing? But then I realized they had speakers in the bathroom and it was playing a translation/teaching type cd for learning Japanese. Pretty cool one I might add, no rosetta stone shit, this had some thievery corporation acid jazz type shit smoothly in the background.\n\nbut that wasnt what was funny, it was the translations. it started off something like this\n\n\"Hi, do you speak english?\" \n\n\"...(Japanese translation)\"\n\nOk simple and innocent enough, next\n\n\"What is your occupation?\"\n\n\"...(Japanese translation)\"\n\nwhoa gettin kinda forward there\n\n\"Married?\"\n\n\"...(Japanese translation)\"\n\nuh..loll wot\n\nat that point i started laughing and started existing the bathroom but i coulda sworn the next translation was something about a hotel, so yea def not rosetta stone, I guess this was more like the \"Learn 2 Pick up Japanese Chics on your Business Trip in 15 min\" cd\n\nthing is, i could only imagine what they translate in the woman's bathroom.\n\n\n*I'd like to add in response to the comment. Thank you I did have a good experience. In reference to the prices, I definitely understand the high/variable price of shima aji from Japan. However what bothered me was more towards regular fish on the menu, for example sake nigiri being IIRC $8 for 2 pieces. At even some of the best sushi establishments they do not charge more than $6 for great sake nigiri. I understand this may be a price inflation as a result of the nice ambiance that Ozumo offers, but still it just doesn't feel right and I end up ordering less.", "author": "Belito L."}

Although we didn't mind sitting at the sushi bar, it was weird how they said they were fully booked over the phone. They do have a great sake selection, and you have the usual sushi, sashimi, and rolls. We ordered oysters too, they were okay. Nothing was spectacular.

The first time we went, we felt uncomfortable, as the hostess made us feel like we should had not have come without a reservation. However, we were seated quickly and the wait staff made us feel welcome. The second time we went, we had a reservation and the hostess still made us feel a bit uncomfortable, probably because they had just opened. The manager, however, was at the host station and asked us if we wouldn't mind sitting at the lounge for a few minutes while we waited to be seated, since they didn't have our table quite ready yet.

M and I split the asparagus salad, the sashimi salad, veggie mix (nasu and shishito peppers), ozumo roll, and the rice pudding for dessert. The salads were both refreshing with a light citrus-y dressing and the fish was fresh. The veggies were served robata style (grilled), tasted nice, nothing too extraordinary there. The ozumo roll actually way impressed me. It didn't taste like your run of the mill over-sauced, over-flavored Americanized roll. It had delicious uni, tempura, and spicy salmon on top with avocado slices, lightly sauced. Good combo. Shared a bottle of delicious sake.

Every last piece of sashimi I tried, whether it was tuna, salmon, whatever it was, every bit of it just melted in my mouth.\nThe oysters... I don't even like shell fish that much, tried oysters before and thought they were gross, but these were out of this world!! I had 3 or 4 of them and would have had more if there were less that 8 people I had to share with haha.\nWe ordered seaweed salad and the beet salad. The seaweed salad was absolutely delicious, but the beet salad was probably the only thing we had that I didn't like.\nBut that's probably just because I don't like beets in general.\n\nWe ordered a rib-eye steak and one other kind of steak but I don't remember which it was. Both were delicious, tender, juicy, full of flavor with amazing sauces to dip each slice into.\nTo die for!!!\nWe also ordered 2 sushi rolls, don't remember which they were but both were delicious and I'm a sushi lover, not the average person who orders a california roll and calls themselves \"satisfied\".\nIt was good.\n\nThe desserts just blew my mind even more, of course, by the time dessert came, I was already drunk off of the bottle of sake, and 2 bottles of rose that we had all downed. But I'm sure the desserts would have blown my sober mind as well. I mean, PEANUT BUTTER AND CHOCOLATE FUDGE MAN!!! \n\nI would literally kill just to eat here again. I have no idea how much our bill was, but I'm sure it's out of my price range. Best meal of my entire life.", "author": "Hilarie L."}

The atmosphere of this place was pretty cool.  Large central sake bars with tables all around it in a busy atmosphere.  The sake list was impressive and we drank the best sake I have ever had.\n\nThe fist itself was pretty hit or miss.  I had some pieces of toro that were pretty fishy tasting some that were tough and some that were good.  The yellowtail was pretty bad but the uni was good.  My buddy ordered the Rib-eye which was delicious, tons of flavor packed into that thing.\n\nAt the end of the day this place is fun for the atmosphere and the food would be okay if it wasn't ridiculously expensive.

It melted in your mouth like butter and the taste was so divine! I could have eaten that with a bowl of rice every day of my life.\n\nMy second favorite dish was their Suzuki (grilled Hawaiian sea bass). It also melted in your mouth and was so delicate and tasty! \n\nOther items I tried and loved was their Halibut sashimi drizzled in a delicate ponzu sauce, Washu Gyu (grilled ribeye steak), and a lobster, tuna and mango roll wrapped in delicate rice paper - yum!\n\nNow I must admit it is not cheap to eat here but definitely a great place for special occasions or splurges.\n\nThe first time I dined here I was by myself and placed in the corner of the Robata bar. Alex (the executive chef) must have felt bad because he visited often and gave me a free taste of several of their dishes!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-06", "description": "Beautiful place with great views. The service was great. The fish was fresh and tasty. The price was steep, and that would be ok if not for a couple of important things. The rice was crunchy, at least on this night. For a food that claims its masters spend years perfecting rice, a premium price tag (everything is around $10 and above per order of nigiri) should not include under-cooked, crunchy rice. Everything we ate had the same bad rice. It wasn't just firm. It was crunchy. Also, the fish was fresh, but the servings were about the size of my thumb and smaller. I have small hands. A $5-$7 piece of fish on crunchy rice could be bigger than my thumb.  Less of an issue is the fact that our chef (we sat at the bar) was very attentive, but didn't prepare anything with his own presentation. Nothing had ponzu or any light sauces. It's sometimes fun to have the chef hand you something like a snapper or Aji, and have him or her tell you not to dip in soy sauce. The chef did give us some nice little bonus pieces of fish and did fry up the salmon skin from the wild salmon we ordered.  Nice touch, for sure. \n\nThere are so many great things about this place. In our opinion, the price didn't match the meal.", "author": "Scott O."}

Trendy, Classy, Lounge-like and still offering an amazing selection of food, sakes and great service! I went to Ozumo twice for dinner on weekdays over the past month and each time my experience was most excellent. \n\nFood: Favorites are definitely  the Sekiwake Rolls (Spicy Tuna Roll with tobiko, tempura flakes, salmon, hamachi - peanut sauce on the side), the Dragon Roll (a classic), their Shiromaguro (white Albacore) is to die for, I enjoyed their Kinoko Miso Soup (Nameko, shitake and enoki mushrooms) as an appetizer. The Hamachi sashimi was fresh (although the Albacore was definitely better). \n\nDrinks: They have one of the best selection of Sakes I have ever seen. I recommend trying their samplers once then save the name of your favorite type for your next visit. I got a full bottle once, and a half bottle the second time. My all time favorite Sake there: Tedorigawa Yamahai Daiginjo. \n\nStaff: Very knowledgeable (or willing to get the info from the Chef and report), Super nice. Had Jenna once and Brandon the second time, and both were super friendly, patient, helpful.. They offered suggestions and explained the dishes. Adds to the experience in a very positive way!\n\nAccommodations: The only minus of this place is that if you end up at a table next to a loud group celebration you won't hear yourself think. The bar is a bit of a social scene. I recommend asking for a quiet table when you book. They seem very willing to help and I got fantastic seats twice.\n\nLocation: if you go on weekdays, the Embarcadero is an easy place to find parking at (Folsom St is just 2 blocks away and has plenty) and a nice quiet area for a post dinner walk.\n\nPrice: It's not cheap but you should not be either.

Theres a bar/lounge area by the entrance and it looks very dim and romantic.  The dining area is relatively big and it was packed on a saturday night.  We were a big group so they required a credit card for reservation.  I had a few pieces of sashimi, 2 rolls and paid no liquor, dessert or drinks and I paid 55 with taxes and tip.   So you do the math if you want to order drinks, appetizers, desserts etc.  I am a sushi lover and would come back to this place especially if someone else is paying :) \n\nThe service was just ok, my water was never refilled which is a big deal for me coz im a water guzzler.  So in summary, good quality sushi great ambience but quite expensive not super but its up there.  If you want to impress a date and really enjoy your food come here.

We kept seeing parties come in and get seated before us. At 9, we get seated on the worst possible table in the restaurant - the middle area facing basically nothing. I asked if there was seating in the back and the hostess said its all full, but the sushi bar is open. Why didn't you tell me that before making me wait 20 mins?! She came back and said she has a corner table open and seated us. This was a bad start already.\n\nThe service is slow as hell at this place. We waited another 10 mins for someone to take our order. The waitress recommends the lamb chop special so we ordered it. Another 10 mins later she comes back to tell us they are out. I had pretty much given up at that point.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-22", "description": "I am always confused when I find Japanese restaurants that are so overrated only to find that they are befuddling the diners with fancy decor and deceptive presentations, when they do not deliver anything substantial. BUT, OZUMO is one of the very few contemporary Japanese restaurants in San Francisco that deserves some praise. It makes me sad to find that this place is below 4 stars in average, because it's really amazing. The ambiance is very nice, with dim lighting providing a romantic setting. I find Ozumo a perfect place for a date.    \nThe food here is amazing. What many contemporary Japanese restaurants in SF fail to deliver is the authenticity of Japanese cuisine. There is nothing wrong with contemporary approach to reinterpret a cuisine, but when you deliver a dish that has lost the authenticity of a cuisine, and has compromised with heavy flavors and fancy presentations to qualify for a standard of excellency, that is unacceptable. Unfortunately, that is what many contemporary restaurants do. But, Ozumo is different. They have successfully delivered the authenticity of the Japanese cuisine in a novel approach with respect to the choice of ingredients and presentation. The presentation of the food was beautiful as well. Ozumo has killed two birds with a stone. \nMost of my favorite dishes were from the Ippin Ryori section, which are mainly small dishes. I suggest that you start out your meal with a focus on this section, because all the dishes here are excellent examples of a contemporary approach to traditional dishes. The top pick is the \"Yamabuki\", which is an uni (sea urchin) risotto. I never expected that uni would go so well with mushrooms, but the dish was fantastic. \"Tontoro\", which is barbequed kurobuto pork, just melts in your mouth. \"Hanabi\", which is sliced hamachi & avocado with jalapeno ponzu sauce, has a Peruvian approach and it is refreshing. At times, Ozumo offers alternative specials to this dish such as \"Lobster Halibut Ceviche\", so do check it out. \nFrom the main dish \"Gindara\", black cod cooked with sake and \"Suzuki\", Hawaiian seabass with shoyu butter, are the top choices in the fish section. Both fishes have a smooth texture and cuts like butter. If you are contemplating between the two, think of the black cod dish as the filet mignon and the seabass as ribeye. The Suzuki tastes a little bit heavier as it is a fattier fish than Gindara. From the meat section, I suggest \"Hitsuji\" or \"Gyu Kakuni\", but the portions are extremely small, so I would suggest choosing from the Ippin Ryori or Izakaya section for the meat dishes.\nAnd lastly for the dessert fans, I suggest \"Choco Chan\", \"Apple Phyllo\", and \"Pineapple Maki\". I've been here 4 times and tried all the desserts. These are the best without a doubt. I'll keep this a secret for you to find out what the deal is with these desserts. \nLastly, what I liked about the restaurant was their selection of sake and imported beer from Japan. They definitely have the best selection of sake and beer. But, I'm a beer fan and I have tried this beer called \"Hitachino Nest\", which is a white ale, that the restaurant recently started importing and it's amazing. It's definitely one of the best while ales I've ever had. I would go back to Ozumo just for this beer. They have many other ones that are rare and I really think it's worth a try.

We ordered A LOT today and i in fact, enjoyed almost everything! From my agedashi tofu appetizer to the fresh and tenderness of salmon belly all the way to my Choco Chan dessert, I enjoyed every dish. We decided to split the tab three way, so we kinda just went crazy with the menu. The sashimi, hands down won me over. Soft, fresh and tender. The moment you put it in your mouth, you suddenly realize you haven't REALLY ate sashimi yet, and the thing is, i only ordered salmon belly and the hamachi, imagine what else i'm missing out on in the whole sashimi menu! My friends ordered the gyu carpaccio and it was amazing. who knew cherry complemented raw beef? \n\nI've eaten a lot of california rolls, i mean, hey, it's the \"easiest\" thing on the menu, but am i nuts for believing that this 6 piece order of california roll with REAL crab is worth the 9 dollars?! I think i am, but then again, you need to try it before you agree with me. But the shrimp tempura roll, not so much, it's not even worth $5 in my opinion, there was nothing special there. \n\nThere were a few more dishes that we ordered, but it slipped my mind, we also each ordered different desserts. I'd say the dessert wasn't mouth-gasmic as the sashimi or other entrees, there was also nothing extraordinarily outstanding or memorable but for the overall dining experience, you should finish your meal off with something sweet. I think i should have ordered the chocolate fondue, it smelled really good from the table next to us. \n\nIf i were to recommend this place, i'd say you can't go wrong with the sashimi, whether it be the raw fish to the raw meat, it's definitely an amazing and tasty trip in your mouth. It was, after all my first time, i do anticipate wanting to come back, but with a wiser palette choice. I'd definitely be down to try more sashimi and less \"cooked\" entrees. \n\nService - our waitress could have been more attentive, she did the bare minimum, you know, nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either. She checked in twice, took our orders accordingly and served accurately. I think that for the price and ambiance of the restaurant, we deserved better quality from our waitress than what the local waitress at the diner. \n\nOur reservations were a little earlier than usual dinner time, so the sky was still bright. the restaurant is most lively in the nighttime so i believe the ambiance would be a LOT more amazing when it got darker. \n\nThe place looks great, feels great and the food was great, service, meh could be better, price - meh, for a restaurant intended to be upscale in San Francisco, i expected it, i've seen worst. if you order the appropriate amount, it won't be that deep of a cut in your wallet. \n\nSo do i recommend it? Yes, i do! \nWas it a perfect experience? Eh, could be better, but not bad enough for me to not want to come back.\n\nI'd come back.", "author": "Pris S."}

You guys are rignt they were both amazing! Thanks for the suggestions.\n\nWhere do I start...\n\nArrived a little early for our 6:15 RSVP, checked in and while I waited at the bar, ordered my first Rainwater. The Bartendress was adorable and showed me how to make this amazing drink. Crushed cucumber, sake flavored vodka, sweet base and a squirt of lime. Amazingly refreshing and could easily replace a gin and tonic on a hot summer evening (picture of lawn chair on the dock in front of a lake here). Only regret is that it doesn't come in a big gulp cup..LOL\n\n1st friend arrives and joins me in my Rainwater. Bartendress...on the spot. Second friend arrives and orders a glass of Cab...again, Bartendress...on spot.\n\nThe only bad thing that I can think of in the entire evening was the hostess. One of my buddies went to tell her that our whole party was here now and he pretty much pulled back a bloody stub...\"I'm busy right now\" is NOT the correct response to \"Our party is all here now.\"\n\nOn to dinner. Started with the amazing Garlic Edamonme and got better from there. One of the guys got an Ahi Collar but refused to share so I have no personal experience with how good it was, but just the fact that he kept it all to himself (on my birthday) tells me a lot. I can't even tell you the rest of what we got. Rolls, Sashimi, Nigiri, etc. The standouts: OMG the Maguro sashimi melts in your mouth. Also tried tuna belly sashimi, that again melts in your mouth. \n\nWaitress was spot on all the time. She constantly took our orders for more and never pressured us with more plates showing up on the table before we were done with the previous one.\n\nSorry, no room for dessert.

Staff here is very friendly but sort of like extras from \"Gattaca\" - very attractive, very faux-Asian-accesorized, very identical, very canned. I came here for lunch with a colleague, and while attempting to converse, we had a very service-oriented server who bordered on verbose in her meticulous descriptions of all the key menu items.\n\nMy hypocritical whining does stop with what I had, the $14 Tori Bento Box, which consisted of slices of free-range chicken, charcoal-grilled, with various compartments in the lacquer box for the side dishes. It was tasty enough, though they short-change you a bit on the rice. I guess they just prove there isn't much you can do with a bento box. For the fancy dishes they serve at dinner, I have to say I've never been overly tempted by them as they strike me as more fusion than honest Japanese.\n\nHappy Hour still seems the best time to come if you can stand the crowds in the dark, front bar. Of the zensai plates offered, the best ones I've had is a uni risotto dish called Yamabuki ($10) and the $16 Hanabi, which are slices of hamaichi and avocado drizzled with a ginger jalapeno sauce.

Started off with a flight of sake from the Nigata prefecture and a bowl of garlic soy sauce edamame soy beans.  From there we had the tontoro (braised pork jewels) served w/ Karachi vinegarette(sake vinegarette), dohyo(spicy tuna tartare w/avocado cream, cucumber, shiso, tobiko, ponzu, and wasabi oil), hanabi (slices of hamachi yellowtail w/ a ginger and jalape\u00f1o ponzu) and the futago(grilled washu beef, saut\u00e9ed garlic, spinach, and eggplant served w/miso seaseme sauce).  All of the appetizers were DELICIOUS!! The pork was so tender and didn't require a knife. The toro was perfectly fresh and had the perfect amount of wasabi. The beef and all of the other ingredients blended well and the meat was so succulent. \n\nSushi: My date and I love sushi. I like Ozumo because they have some hard to come by sushi. We both had the salmon toro (salmon belly), toro (fatty tuna belly), hamachi(yellowtail), maguro (tuna), unagi(eel), shiro maguro(white tuna), hotate(scallops), and mirugai(clams).  All of the sushi was perfect. High quality and the freshest. \n\nEntrees: We decided to share 2 entrees. The guy filet and black cod. OMG the black cod was so moist and fresh. Very flavorful. Could have that again and again. The filet was prepared w/green beans, shiitake mushrooms in a sansho sauce. All components were excellent. \n\nDessert: Decided to order 2 desserts. The choco chan (flour less chocolate cake) , and dark chocolate fondue. The fresh berries complimented the dark chocolate. Not a dark chocolate lover, but this dessert worked for me. Will order again. The flourless chocolate cake was the best I have ever eaten. The bitterness of the green tea and the sweetness of the chocolate cake were a match. Since we were having chocolate we decided a citrus sake would be a nice way to cleanse the palette with the chocolate. Having said that we each had the dewakuza \"tobiroku\". A perfect ending. \n\nOverall, great ambience with a good vibe. If you have friends in town or want to impress a lady this is the place. Great selection of sake and wines to choose from. Any spot in the the restaurant is a great place to sit. Sat in all 4 areas as I'm a regular (sake lounge, sushi bar, dinning room, and the front of the restaurant). Can't go wrong. Also, convenient is valet parking. Convenient as this area is tough for parking to come by. Close to AT&T Park. Great spot after a ball game. Matt Cain and Buster Posey frequent the place as does David Lee of the Warriors. \n\nGreat service. Severs are attentive and are well versed with the menu.

I'm not sure who these reviewers are who said they were intimidated by the trendy decor at Ozumo and the food was so great, etc., but this place is basically a high-end Red Lobster. \n\nThe decor is corporate, characterless plastic ickiness. The food is insanely overpriced.\n\nI made the mistake of booking this place for my husband's 40th birthday, and the very sweet maitre d' made a fuss and brought us sake, which made us feel guilty about turning right around and leaving, which is what we wanted to do.\n\nSo out of guilt, we ordered a beer and a couple of quick appetizers and set about making an alternate reservation at an authentic, charming Japanese restaurant. (SF has many: Try Sebo, Ebisu or Eiji if that's what you're looking for.)\n\nThe bill for a seaweed salad, agedashi tofu and one beer?  $56. Gag.\n\nThis place didn't look anything like what the Web site suggested and I can only shrug at the taste of my fellow reviewers. To each his own, I guess. \n\nIf you want a so-so view of the water, so-so decor, so-so food and an extravagant bill, Ozumo is the place for you.", "author": "Megan M."}

After entering we were told by the hostess that part of the restaruant was reserved, but we would be able to find seating in the bar area where it was \"first come, first serve\".  A few laps around the bar quickly revealed that nothing would be available for a while, but then my parents spotted some open seats at a sushi bar just a few feet from the main bar.\n\nNot sure if these were part of the reserved area, my father and boyfriend walked over to the seats and flagged down a waitress to ask her if we could sit there while I continued to look for seating around the bar.  The waitress went off to talk with the hostess, then the hostess tracked me down at the bar to say \"only the bar/lounge is available right now\" before turning heel and walking away.  How were my boyfriend and dad supposed to know that:\n\na) The sushi bar is not a part of the lounge\nb) Four empty seats set for guests would not be open to us?  \n\nI finally found a table in the stuffy bar/lounge and sat down.

I always order their lychee martini drink and it is fabulous, I could drink them all night. \n\nI recommend going there on a Friday or Saturday night because the atmosphere is fun.  Lots of young people at the bar, and if you are lucky enough to score a table in the bar area you are winning. They do serve a full dinner menu at the bar.  \n\nYes Ozumos is pricey but well worth it.  The scallop dish I had there was one of the best scallop dishes I have ever had.

Lively ambiance, beautiful decor  - on a nice sunny day, my coworkers and I had a table next to an open window, so you could get a nice breeze and a beautiful view of the bay bridge. It was impressive.\n\nI think the cooked appetizers were pretty good (potsickers, shrimp tempura, edamame), and the hanabi appetizer was awesome, but I was disappointed by the sushi.  The nigiri sushi was fresh, but nothing special, especially for the price.  The sushi rolls were on the small side and nothing to write home about.  We ordered a few basic rolls (e.g. rainbow or spider) and a few more fun rolls (jalepeno yellowtail) and they were all quite underwhelming. \n\nI will likely be back, but probably only I have to stay near my office and someone else is footing the bill.", "author": "Marie K."}

I like to pretend I am really into sushi. Sometimes I even play make-believe that I am a snob about it [I don't actually know anything]. I feel like I haven't really been eating sushi until I came here, though. The fish was obviously extremely fresh and was easily of the best tasting fish I have ever had.\n\nMy sister and I came here as a goodbye dinner for me moving away from the bay area. I was drawn in by the beautiful food pictures on their website (seriously, go look). We were seated near the back - this place is significantly larger inside that I thought it would be. Our waitress (Charlie), was very helpful in picking out items off of the menu (which is rather lengthy). She helped us pick out a couple of cocktails to start - I got the [I may not remember this name right] Hachi-ban (a whisky-based drink with grenadine and friends) and my sister got a cucumber-based cocktail. My drink was pretty good, and my sister's was great.\n\nCharlie then ran us through some of her recommendations, and we decided on three sushi rolls to start. We got the Ozumo roll, the Sekiwake roll, and one of the specials whose name escapes me. We were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the fish. After finishing those, we ordered the salmon belly nagiri, as well as another roll (which had mango in it - surprisingly good). Additionally we wanted to split a bottle of sake. We are both pretty clueless about what sakes are good, and they have an extremely large selection of sakes. Charlie helped us navigate the waters (sakes?) of the menu, and picked out three for us to choose from. The one we decided on was quite good. I'm not much of a sake drinker, so my opinion is pretty meaningless, though.\n\nAfter finishing our second round of food, we decided to go for dessert. I got the Peanut Butter Mousse, and my sister got the Choco Chan. Both were very good.\n\nAt the end of the dinner, the bill was astronomically high. That is expected, though. Good place for a very special occasion, highly recommended.", "author": "Ryan C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-30", "description": "Just to clarify this ahead of time, my review is based on two sushi rolls, which in my opinion, only moderately constitutes a review.  Anyway, I made a reservation here ahead of time with one of my girlfriends for dinner at 8pm.  When we walked in, it looked like the bar was pretty busy with trendy people.  Almost reminded me of something you'd see in LA: trendy sushi place, attractive people at the bar, swanky music playing.  As we walked back towards the restaurant (which is HUGE by the way), it mellowed out and was instead filled with people out on business dinners.  When we sat down, we decided on splitting two rolls: the Sekiwake and Hamachi Maki.  Our waitress was a little pushy on getting us to order, but in her defense, we kept talking and didn't look at the menu until about 15 minutes after sitting down.  Anyway, our rolls came out after about 20 minutes, but came out one at a time.  The Hamachi Maki, which was first, was presented beautifully.  The fish was fresh, and the next time I'm here, I'd like to try some of their sashimi (which could be the difference between 4 and 5 stars).  This roll had a little bit of everything that I love: hamachi, avocado, cucumber, tempura flakes, and a little bit of jalape\u00f1o!  The second roll, the Sekiwake was my friend's choice, but to be honest, was the other roll I was considering.  This roll, which has spicy tuna, tempura flakes, salmon and hamachi had great flavor and was just spicy enough.  We ate through this pretty quickly and to be honest, I kinda wanted another item, but went against the idea since we were knee deep in conversation.  Ultimately, we just about shut the place down and left around 11pm when the restaurant had all been emptied out.  Overall, my conclusion was that while Ozumo is a little pricey, their presentation and rolls at least make it understandable why it's expensive.  Other places in SF will charge something similar, but then lack in either the freshness or presentation.

This restaurant seemed so promising, but I was sorely disappointed to find out that the food did not deliver. My meal started off fairly strong but got progressively worse. WHYYY did you guys have the worse, not to mention tiniest, sushi rolls ever? Honestly...I freaking LOOVE sushi. Feed me sushi and you've pretty much got a guarunteed shoe in to a great review but WTF went wrong here? My \"special\" roll was not so special with literally, I kid you not, mixed motherfucking greens in my roll. You know, the stuff you make a salad with. If I wanted a salad, I would have ordered a salad....\n\nI ordered the:\n-garlic edamame\n-iced green tea\n-pan-seared scallops w/ kaboocha squash dumplings, mushrooms, and uni cream sauce\n-special roll topped w/ sake (salmon) and thin lemon slices\n-spicy tuna roll\n\nThe pan-seared scallops were actually really good. However, both of my sushi rolls were terrible. Unfortunately so, too, considering the fact that I absolutely love the faboosh decor/interior of the restaurant. If I were to describe the overall ambiance of Ozumo, the following words would come to mind: modern, casually classy, trendy, clean, & hip. I will give it up to the staff (+1 star) for their great service & attentiveness. I truly hope the sub-par sushi was a freak incident and maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I would come back again and give this place one more try (but I definitely would not make the same mistake of ordering those rolls again). Perhaps I'll experiment with an entree next time...womp womp.", "author": "Denise L."}

Professionally dressed staff and very friendly, welcoming service.  Everyone greets you!  \n\nFOOD: 3.5 stars! ***\nOysters - Rich, fresh! Yummy! Def deserves 5 stars!!  \n\nPiri - Hama Roll - Roll with asparagus tempura, avocado.. wrapped in soy paper and topped with spicy hamachi.  Wasn't impressed at all.  Not very flavorful.  I love hamachi, but this roll was pretty bland. 2.5 stars!! \n\nSashimi special with toro, salmon belly, and ? - Fresh fish.  The toro was really good.  The other two types of fish were OKAY.  The cuts of sashimi were pretty decent.  3 stars!!\n\nHotate - Pan seared scallops with mushroom risotto - Scallops were really tender and good!  The risotto tasted like sticky rice with mushrooms.  Overall, the risotto was pretty salty though, or else this dish would've been on list of favs!  4 stars!!\n\nGyu fillet - Grilled angus beef with mushrooms - Cooked to order.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Again, the sauce was pretty salty.  However, the purple yams on the plate were delicious though! 3.5 stars!!\n\nDesert - warm chocolate & azuki bean mochi w/ green tea ice cream - Awesome desert! The warm chocolate was soo good and complemented the green tea ice cream very well! The mochi was fresh, but I can't say added much flavor to the whole desert.  Just added some diff in texture to the whole desert.  4.5 stars!!\n\nDrinks: Giddy geisha martini - lychee with passion fruit - way too sweet!  not enough liquor! 2 stars!!\n\nATMOSPHERE: 5 stars!! *****\n*Awesome, fun environment.  Front lounge/bar area is extremely nice.  Good music.  Upscale!\n*Restaurant area in back is nicely decorated.  Bright, fun.  Not too loud!\n\nPRICE: Pretty pricy!! If you factor the price, this place is not really worth it :P Skip the food, and just grab some drinks!! :D", "author": "Tramy V."}

It's on the same block as Boulevard and literally right next to Chaya Brasserie (all very good restaurants), with a nice view of the bay right across the street.\n\nI ordered the salmon belly to start with and iron pot sukiyaki as my main entree.  The sushi was good, and the iron pot was very good.  My friends ordered the short ribs, which were fantastic.  The drinks were all good and the atmosphere is pretty nice, appropriate for a special night out.\n\nAnyway, my only complaint is that our waiter was pretty rude.  The rest of the staff at Ozumo is great, very friendly and accommodating.  It sucks that we got stuck with an unhelpful waiter, who constantly make awkward comments and only checked on us every hour or so... Other than that, Ozumo was decent.  I definitely think it's worth a try at least once, though I'm not a big enough fan to come back very often.", "author": "Amanda N."}

We threw out a few places, and settled on Ozumo since neither had been for a while, and the vibe is normally pretty solid.\n\nWe had a few of the apps before diving into the sushi.  One, a preparation of duck, was really bad to be perfectly honest.  The other was forgettable.\n\nA few rolls came out as we were tearing through the first bottle of Sake.  There rolls are just OK.  The fish is always very nice, but I think they take understated too far on their rolls.  If I just wanted to taste the fish I would just order sashimi/nigiri, so I'm expecting something more out of a roll.\n\nOne bottle down, and we get into the real stuff and start ordering nigiri.  Our server has ALL kinds of suggestions, and she is really selling them, so what the hell, we start ordering.\n\nSecond bottle of sake arrives (neither too outrageous, both under $50, but those are the rarity on their menu), as does the nigiri.\n\nThere were some absolutely amazing things.  I cannot lie.  From the unbelievable blue fin toro, to the outstanding scallops, spanish mackeral, and several other things I can't even remember that were amazing.  It was really something else, some of the best cuts of fish I have had in the city.\n\nWe were stuffed, and a little tipsy.  It was an amazing dinner, something worth a solid rating.  And then......the bill comes.\n\n**BAM**  (Left hook to the body)\n\n**BAM**  (Uppercut)\n\n$400+gratuity!!!!  My g*d.  Next time just roofie me if you are going to do me like that.  It was the worst fleecing I've had in years (and I wasn't even paying!).  I have no problem paying for a meal that price range if it is spectacular and I know what to expect, but this just came out of nowhere.  We really felt taken advantage of on the \"recommendations\", I mean these are coming out 2 pieces at a time for crying out loud.  Yes we should have asked price each time, but give me a friggen break, other than the Blue Fin Toro, what could have cost that much?\n\nKnow what to expect if you are going to order their real fish.  And ask the price of each recommendation.  Just be prepared for an extremely expensive meal of sushi.\n\nMy buddy, a true gentleman and scholar, still paid, but I felt so guilty I took him out to dinner the next night.......", "author": "Andrew M."}

We tend to avoid places that are as expensive as Ozumo, since we have spent quite a bit in the past at some similarly-priced restaurants and been very disappointed with the quality, atmosphere and service. We avoided using the card as long as possible, fearing that \"the experience\" would be awkward for us, pretentious, unpleasant. However, Ozumo is worth every penny, for all of those things. We had one of the most enjoyable and delicious meals I can remember! \n\nWe arrived about fifteen minutes early for our reservation, but were seated immediately at a little table away from noise and bustle. Our hostess was friendly, warm and very sweet - complimented me on my bright pink purse! Our wonderful server, Riley, guided us expertly to the perfect choices, both for our tastes and our budget. \n\nWe are hamachi lovers (although I think this will be the last time we eat this tender, buttery, but highly endangered fish - a perfect farewell) and Riley suggested the Tsukasabotan \"Fu-In\" Ginjo. The crisp, dry cold sake with green apple notes paired beautifully with the succulent fish. \n\nWe began with some truly outstanding miso soup, and after that had the hanabi small plate - hamachi with slices of perfectly ripe avocado and cherry tomatoes in a warm ginger and jalapeno ponzo sauce. It was so delicious, if we had been at home I would have gotten a spoon to finish it! \n\nNext, we had veggie tempura. It was perfectly executed, and included (I think!) a slice of lotus root, which was incredibly delicious with a crisp yet creamy texture. This was garnished with a beautiful and very yummy spray of crispy tempura-battered and fried vermicelli - delicate and rich.\n\nThis was followed by a big plate of hamachi nigiri and an order of perfectly fresh ikura. As I mentioned before, paired with the Fu-In, a very memorable experience.\n\nWe decided to complete our feast with dessert. Riley brought a menu with some very compelling choices of confections and dessert sake. We decided on the chocosan, a slice of warm flourless chocolate cake topped with matcha ice cream and shaved chocolate and surrounded by tiny mochis, and at first selected a dessert sake to share that was described as having qualities of \"strawberries and cream\". However, Riley guided us to a sake (Harushika \"Tokimeki\") that was actually my favorite part of the meal - it was like the juice of some rare exotic fruit, at once earthy and ethereal, sparkling, lightly sweet, guava and lychee and fresh coconut water. \n\nImagine our surprise when Riley brought *two* desserts - the chocosan we had ordered, and a wonderful \"sundae\" of bananas with carmelized sugar topped with ginger ice cream and accompanied by freshly-baked little shortbread cookies! (I did mention that it was a birthday celebration, now that I think of it - but what a cupcake!) Both desserts were so delicious, and it was so much fun to have the contrasting flavors and textures. \n\nMy partner and I were absolutely beaming at the end of the meal. Throughout it, many different people came by to swiftly remove empty plates and fill our water glasses (just one man did that - such a sweet man!) The restaurant itself is very beautiful, but might have seemed too imposing if not for the graciousness and warmth of the staff. \n\nWe are so grateful for this lovely meal. This is a place Iwe will save up for and return to again and again.", "author": "Marianne S."}

I usually stick to what I know, but when I branch out and try other combination rolls, I've enjoyed them all. \n\nEvery time I come here, the drinks are always good and I like sitting up at the bar area.

Armed with a big bag of distractions (e.g. IPod Touch, coloring book, small toys, plastic plates and forks, snacks and juice boxes), my hubby and I hoped for the best when we took our brood here last Tuesday night.  Yes, we got some odd looks from the posers at the bar but we forged ahead to our table by the robata bar.\n\nOur tykes like plain food so we requested an order of zaru soba (not on the menu) and edamame.  For the grown-ups, we ordered a blue fin sashimi starter, hanabi, futago, grilled shitake mushrooms, and burikama.  Although I had snacks at the ready, I didn't have to break them out because the soba and edamame came out really quickly.   Hubby and I were able to enjoy our food because our kids were full and entertained by the chefs at the grill a few feet away.  Since the place is pretty noisy, your kids won't be totally out of place (unless they throw a sh*tfit).  \n\nOzumo will likely become one of regular stops when we take Caltrain up to vist my husband.

We started at Ozumo.  I had a bad experience with the general manager before but I figured we would give it another shot as my girlfriend and I love sushi.  We started with a lobster roll, age dashi dofu and japanese uni.  The uni was literally the best I ever had.  It was buttery and not gamey at all. For the food I would give 4 stars.  The service however, a totally different thing altogether.  It was a total nightmare!  At the end of out meal, my gf ordered a green tea.  They brought over a ceramic pot of tea along with a matching ceramic cup (no handle, Japanese style).  What the waitress failed to tell us is that the cup was as hot at the McDonald's temperature tea inside it.  As soon as she picked up the cup, her reflex was to drop it which in turn spilled scalding hot tea all over her lap (and she was wearing a short dress).  I rushed up, made sure she was ok and asked her to go to the ladies room to check herself out.  Meanwhile i asked for the manager and proceeded to complain about the incident and requested an incident report be written. He said he was sorry and disappeared into the office for 25 minutes.  I asked the staff where he was and they said he's \"writing it up.\"  I asked him to email me the report and comp our food.  He claimed he couldn't comp all of it but would comp a few things.  He handed me a bill for $30 and I tipped the waitress anyways since the food was decent.  Frankly, they should have comped the whole meal.

Had to then endure an awkward pause before the guy who sat us would agree to check my coat.  Really?  I have to ask you to check my coat and then be treated like I'm asking for a personal favor? \n\nThe food here is fine - it's not amazing for high-end flashy sushi, but it's fine. The pricing is ridiculous.  My husband had a cocktail (which tasted like a crappy appletini that had been raped by a pomegranate) and a beer, and I had two small glasses of cold unfiltered sake.  We had two starters (and just about a perfect amount of sushi, shared a dessert, and the bill was..... wait for it..... $216!!!!\n\nThe main thing about Ozumo that really made me crazy was the excessive number of douchebags hanging out as if they're hired body guards.  They're not wearing headsets, but boy, do they wish they were.  I know Ozumo is trying to be a swanky hip place, but that doesn't mean it has to feel like Vegas. \n\nAs we were heading for the door to leave, I stopped to retrieve my coat from coat check.  There were, I kid not, at least 6 aforementioned douchebags hanging out by the door - WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY THERE FOR!  Is this place a front for some douchebag in training school?! The guy who got my coat for me gave me a \"here you go darling\" as he helped me put my coat on.  Final fucking douchebaggery insult.\n\nNever again.", "author": "ki r."}

We pointed this out to the waitress who denied it.  She reluctantly went back to the sushi chef to confirm; came back and said it was hamachi.  I order albacore all the time, albacore is my friend, and that was no albacore.  So we had her go back to the chef; same response.  It wasn;t until we demanded to have the chef look at us in the face and tell us it was albacore that she admitted it wasn't albacore.

But next we had the Shacho Roll which had Maine lobster with mango and cilantro. By far the most expensive roll I've ever had at around $23, but it was jaw-droppingly delicious! The Kana Croquettes (basically crab cakes) were good, and the Gyu Tataki was so juicy that I just wanted to let the meat sit in my mouth and enjoy! The sashimi was fresh and we enjoyed everything we got.\n\nThe main drawback to Ozumo would have to be the price. But then again it is ranked $$$ on Yelp... It's great for special occasions and definitely worth a try, but be prepared to leave with a much lighter wallet. I've had comparable sushi, sashimi, and beef for a lot less.

The hostess did not look thrilled to see us.  We were a large group, dressed casually, late on a week day night.  You could tell she was hoping we did not have reservations so she could turn us away.  It took a while to be seated, and they argued with us at length about adding one more person to our reservation, even though there were empty chairs through the restaurant and there was room at our corner table.  Once everyone was finally seated, it took quite a while to get a server's attention to order drinks and food.  Our server was not attentive and was fairly brisk.   When serving our group, she had told us that a few of the dishes would take a little longer to prepare, and we agreed that she could start bringing out appetizers and a la carte dishes.  However, almost an hour went by and everyone had finished their orders but the people who'd ordered duck still had not gotten their food.  They had to eat after everyone was finished.  I did not feel we were advised well about the delays for this dish or else we would have asked to have our other orders put in later, or would have ordered something else.\n\nThe food was not exceptional by any means.  It was good, but not great, and for every dish I tried, I could think of another San Francisco restaurant where I could get the same dish, only a version that is better executed and less expensive.  I do have to say the sake flight was pretty good and reasonably priced.  Too bad all of the food items were disappointing.\n\nI don't see any reason to go back here again.  This place is great if you want to show off to out of town friends, but that's not really my thing.

We arrived about a half hour early because he wanted to avoid traffic. We were greeted at the front door by the hostess and were told we could either be seated or kill some time and have some drinks at the bar. So we sat at the bar and I ordered one of their signature cocktails while my boyfriend ordered a beer. To my surprise, the cocktail wasn't much of a cocktail, but rather a straight shot of alcohol. I forgot what the name of the drink was, but its sweetness was completely overpowered with a strong taste of alcohol. I didn't want to the drink to go to waste so I forced myself to gulp it down. (I should've ordered the moscato, since it's my favorite wine, just to play it safe!)\n\nI kid you not, by the time we were seated at the dining area, my eyes were half open because I was so buzzed. I didn't expect to get buzzed before dinner, but that's what happened... and it didn't help that I didn't eat a snack before coming to dinner.\n\nThe menu had a selection of what seemed  to be appetizing meals, from a variety of fresh sushi all the way down to the entrees. We ordered some sushi, unagi and a California roll. I ordered the kobe beef with vegetables and my boyfriend ordered the bacon-wrapped scallops. The sushi was delicious and so fresh; it was unlike any other sushi I've had in the past. However, when our entrees arrived I was a bit disappointed because the portion of my meal was so small! The kobe beef was cut up in small pieces, even the root vegetables were bigger than the pieces of meat! Despite the small size, it was delicious and tasty. My boyfriend's meal, on the other hand, was so good! The scallops were so big! We looked at each other with an unsatisfied look... we kinda wanted to order more food since the food we ordered didn't suffice.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a sweet potato bread pudding that came with banana ice cream. The banana ice cream stood out more than the bread pudding for me.\n\nThis place is a higher-end Japanese restaurant. The atmosphere is warm and cozy, the food is delightful, but the portions are too small! I guess I didn't expect the portions to be so small because I'm so used to eating at Japanese restaurants that serve huge portions of food.

I don't know where to start w/ the compliments... big factor is that it's been a few weeks since we ate there so I gotta bring it back from memory.  \n\nSo we arrive promptly for our reservation and we are walked over to our table, in the corner, which was nice and cozy :)  Then we are greeted by the manager (which was a surprise), then he informed us that we had the option of creating a tasting menu according to our tastes (which again was a surprise).  We had about 6 or 7 different dishes, each different from the one before, and each just as exquisite.  I've eaten at many Japanese joints, and this place definitely set itself apart.  \n\nOur server, who is awesome at her job, came to our table and talked w/ us about our tasting menu.  She gathered our dislikes, which was basically the GF's dislikes, since I'll eat practically anything as long its dead and fresh!  :)\n\nFirst came the very good edamame.  It came out warm (surprise!) and in two different plates w/ two different flavors.  The first flavor was plain, as usual, and the other dish had the bean pods marinated in garlic and soy sauce, damn I enjoyed suckin' on the skins more than eatin' the beans themselves.\n\nThen came the next dish, which I believe was the \"Hanabi\", basically Hamachi and avocado slices in a sour soy sauce, topped w/ cherry tomatoes, bean sprouts, and something else... it was EX-CE-LL-ENT!  The GF does not like raw fish, but this time, it was a goodtogo!  It had a sweet and tangy flavor, as well as still retaining its Hamachi flavor.  The sauce was just right and did not drown out the fresh taste of the sashimi.\n\nThen our server brought out a small plate w/ roasted chili peppers to cleanse our pallet.  Some of our peppers were spicy, which was fine by us! \n\nThe next plate was... damn, cant remember!  But it was HELLA good!  I remember a dish that we did have.  It was slices of \"Washu\" beef atop a slice of egg plant and cucumber, then it was topped with a sweet teriyaki steak sauce... mmmmmm.... excellleeennnttt.  We were lovin' this dish let me tell you!  (guess I just did...) \n\nThe other plate was that of a baked fish... think it was butterfish or salmon, either way.  We were wow'ed again!  Prior, I believe we had two separate dishes of their signature rolls.  Not sure what kinds, but they were very good, w/ fresh grade A ingredients.\n\nThen it was topped off w/ an awesome dessert!   Think it was like a hibiscus ice cream on shortbread w/ a sweet sauce and fruits... BOMB!   :)\n\nThat was good food.  Had a blast! Cant wait to go again.  Now I must comment on our waiter/server.  She was very attentive, charming, and knowledgeable in Japanese food and sake.  She got the GF just right in the planning of our tasting menu.  She also recommended just the right bottle of sake!  That's how you get a tip peoples!  \n\nWe had a great time, even though we were going to go to 1300 Filmore because Ozumo informed us that they were not planning on opening after renovations on the day of our reservation... now they tell us, the day before.

Their food is pricey but it delivers quality and flavor, so as long as you don't go there too often (or you can fling large sums of cash at fish any time you please), it should definitely be on the short list of ab-fab destinations.\n\nWe were in a mad dash at the last minute as we thought our reservations were at 8:30 but we didn't leave the house until 8, and they sat us with no complaint at 8:20.\n\nBuilding on previous visits, we had planned to definitely get some sushi; the lobster; possibly the duck; and, other than that, open to suggestion.  The lobster is served on a bed of uni (sea urchin) risotto, which is sufficiently great to stand alone as its own dish, and yet, as it's served with lobster, it vaults it well into the stratosphere.\n\nThis time around we had a few special items -- the o-toro nigiri sushi (WOW!  This actually beat out EVERY OTHER DISH this visit, including the lobster), and some blue fin tuna sashimi (paired with regular maguro sashimi -- we actually liked the regular more, though they were both excellent).  A pot-roast-tender beef dish served atop potato; small beef slices on top of spinach and eggplant with a bit of ginger and cucumber slices beneath; and (another favorite of this outing), salmon teriyaki on skewers.  Sadly I can't remember the Japanese names of the dishes, but these descriptions should more than suffice, and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu in my opinion.\n\nDessert was standout as well, they brought a celebratory birthday custard-type thing, and we also had fruit milk chocolate fondue, and dark chocolate pudding in a sesame/poppy-seed basket.\n\nIf only I hadn't been driving, I could have gotten smashed on sake to wrap things up.", "author": "Walter K."}

This is served in a hot sukiyaki broth over an small open flame and serves two. This a conversation piece for your large group or your intimate party of two.

Their fish is usually fresh...I only eat sashimi so when their toro, hamachi belly, ankimo, or salmon belly is fresh-fresh...it's great!

Ozumo's was the closest place.  No real expectations.\n\nThe Staff: \nThe staff was super helpful, friendly, and courteous.  I believe the two who helped us were Rebecca and Felix.  They were knowledgeable in the food, drinks, and provided very helpful suggestions when we were puzzled.  \n\nThe Drinks: \nWide-ranging menu and can accommodate you if you're looking for beer, liquor, or any kind of cocktail. \n\nThe Food:\nHanabi (Hamachi and Avocado w Jalapeno Ponzu) - extremely tasty\nEdamame w/ roasted garlic - this was a surprise.  Edamame is usually prepped by steaming them and served with a dash of salt.  However, these were glazed w/ roasted garlic. The pairing worked quite well.\nVarious sushi rolls - I didn't order the rolls, but I ate them. DELICIOUS\n\nThe Decor: \nThe front bar is dimly lit and has a nice subtle ambiance to it, while the back is a brightly lit bustling restaurant complete with a sushi bar.  Works really well regardless if you're with friends or entertaining guest.  We sat at the bar-lounge area, but the restaurant is worth a second visit for dinner.\n\nOverall:\nThe premium you pay for the service and quality of the staff/food/experience is worth it.", "author": "Tuan M."}

Now, if you're going to be an overpriced sushi restaurant, then your fish better be DAMN FRESH. So fresh that it's living in Bel-Air with Uncle Phil. Ozumo's sushi had the taste and freshness of your typical, run-of-the-mill, discount sushi restaurant. You cannot charge freakin $9 for six small pieces of bay scallop sushi when the bay scallops aren't fresh and you try to cover it up with loads of spicy mayo! You can't charge $8 for three pieces of sweet corn tempura when the tempura isn't crispy (more dry and chewy) and there's NO flavor!\n\nThis place had a pretty large sake menu and the service was pretty good. It also has a pretty awesome interior -- walls just lined with hundreds of sake bottles. The back part of the restaurant has a pretty terrific view of the Bay Bridge, as well.\n\nUnfortunately, all that goodness just can't make up for how mediocre the food is -- and even worse, how unbelievably high the prices are.

As usual, wasn't disappointed with the food, drinks and service.\n\nOne major complaint: not a lot of options for vegetarians.  Yes, it's a sushi bar with lots of fish and such, but there really are no main course meals for vegetarians at all.  I made do with edamame, seaweed salad, tempura and the one flavour of vegetable sushi they have.  It would be nice to have a main course dish instead of sides and appetizers though!\n\nI'm taking away one star for the service.  It's not terrible, but I found it a bit slow and strange.  Our dishes came out very staggered, my companion getting his before me, while I continued to munch on the appetizers that we had.  His sushi came out, mine took another 10 minutes to appear.  I ordered a second cocktail, it took at least 15 minutes to arrive (I did get a waiter coming over to tell me there'd been an unexpected accident with it and they were remaking it... I kept picturing my drink in a bad car wreck).  \n\nThe price wasn't too horrible: $120 for the two of us, which included three drinks and a *lot* of food that we didn't even finish eating.  We spent more the week before at a different restaurant and didn't get even half the food we got here.\n\nThe ambiance and decor really is amazing too.

Mike (our server) was able to recommend excellent food options as well as a bottle of sake.  Instead of steering us toward one of the more expensive bottles, he helped us choose one that would be great for a first time.  Still, the sake was $98.00.

First time was few months back, a co worker suggested the place. It was a good experience the first time. The ambience was nice and we were there for HH. Food is good(3-4 stars), portions are small for the price which is expected at a fine dining restaurant and this place is far from fine dining. \n\nSo about 3 weeks ago I re visited Ozumo and brought a few of my friends with me (whom one is one of the biggest food critics in LA) with the hopes of impressing her/them with a great choice of a classy restaurant w/ great food, ambience and phenomenal service.. I wanted for once to take her to a great restaurant for she is a tough one to please as you can imagine.\n\nSo long story short ..first thing the waiter greets us at the table(I won't mention his name to save him from embarrassment) with hickies on his neck. Restaurant etiquette 101- hickies are unprofessional, classless and completely inappropriate in any profession especially in a restaurant settting. I was appalled that a restaurant like Ozumo(especially for the prices they charge) would allow their employees to serve food and be at a dinner table with hickies! Tacky and disgusting! I was embarrassed that I misjudged this place and brought my guests to this place. Aside from the hickies, he wasn't that great at being attentive and was chatting it up with his fellow co workers. He was knowledgeable about the food that's the ONLY thing I was impressed by but not impressed enough to pay $400+. Luckily for you, I didnt have a local food critic with me. \n\nTo management: please read the basic etiquette manual and live up to your name and your prices!

It was served in a cunning little molded shape, which we promptly demolished with the endive leaves and gyoza chips provided for dipping. \n\nThen the \"Gindara\" came, which was luscious black cod marinated in saikyo miso.

It's not the freshest sushi, but it's not bad for a price (12-15 a roll) that's reasonable for the area.  The robata grill is hit or miss, but when it's not overcooked, it's tasty.\n\nThe service is close to the edge of what I will accept without walking out of a place or leaving a couple of pennies (my mother actually did that once at a restaurant) as a tip.  The last time I was there I almost wrote our waitress a note reminding her she was in a service industry.  \n\nNext time I'm in the neighborhood seeking Asian, I'll probably go to Chaya.

First time was lunch, enjoyed it very much so I suggested it to my friends as a dinner place. \n\nWe first started off with happy hour at the bar - little too loud, but it's a nice place to hang out after work, nicely decorated. \n\nThe wine list - @ least wine by the glass, is a little disappointing. I know it's a Japanese place, so I should have sake, but I really wanted a decent glass of wine. $10 for BV Cab that costs about the same for 2 bottles at Costco?? Could make some better selections and charge the same money. \n\nWe had 5;30 reservations for dinner, and we were promptly seated. Everyone is supernice there, no complaints about that. \n\nNo espresso, but really good teas. \n\nThe only other thing that bothers me is the main dining room, the chairs seem kinda dirty and oldish looking.

At first glance this place my seem like a hot spot to grab sushi, but there are a few things to note before you venture down town to be let down.\n\nNormally, I like to have a bottle of sake with dinner, but at Ozumo there is no such thing as a bottle of sake under $90.  This is quite absurd to me considering I've ventured to many-a-sushi spots and paid substantially less for a bottle of sake for two. I will say that the gomae was fantastic for a starter! I was happy with the sushi presentation, but once I actually picked up my chopsticks to eat a roll--my taste buds had a different reaction.  I wasn't blown away by any of the rolls we had. My great company and I love blue fin tuna and we have had it a few places around town; however, I was not happy with the quality at Ozumo at all! \n\nLastly, the interior space of Ozumo is sort of negatively random.  The front entrance is super trendy, sleek and dark--then as you walk through the rest of the restaurant to the main dining area you feel as though you are in an entirely different establishment.  To me, it was reminiscent of cafeteria?!  The table and chairs were completely wrong for the space and were comber sum.  On a nicer note, their plates and glasses were pretty. That's all I got.  Ozumo is waaay overpriced and overrated.", "author": "Nichole P."}

A close 5 minute walk for us in a thriving SoMa neighborhood, there was valet available but hardly any other parking.\n\nWe didn't have reservations which sucked dookie because I have an OpenTable account but we just didn't want to be ghetto and make reservations 5 minutes before leaving - oh what the hell, we'll do that next time if we need to :)\n\nHostesses were very sweet - as she took us to our table in the back, I complimented her pretty blue suede boots and she told me where to find them and this and that. Super friendly!\n\nWe initially wanted to sit at the bar in the front (so dark and trendy oooh) but we instead, had a table in the back near the sushi bar, where it's quieter. Our server was pretty nice too and read off the specials for that night.\n\nTHEY HAVE KOBE STEAK TARTARE AS ONE OF THEIR SPECIALS. She didn't even need to say anything else, I was sold!!\n\nSteak Tartare with Gyoza Chips and Quail Egg: Holy moly, what. a. rip. The portion was uber small and it had a small DAB of dijon mustard to the side - I had to ask for more dijon. I take it back, it wasn't that good. It was literally just a small pile of ground beef with no seasoning and a quail egg on top. Worst steak tartare ever!\n\nOzeki Roll: Really tasty, I liked it! Then again, I love cream cheese :)\n\nSpicy Tuna Roll: It had a peanut sauce on the side and it was a very interesting combo. Good roll too!\n\nSeafood Hot Pot: Dinky ass pot with a sweeter broth than what I usually like. Good array of seafood that came with a bowl of rice (no noodles). Not worth it - avoid.\n\nSparkling Geisha: Delicious!!\n+ 2 hot sake\n= about $150 after taxes/tip for 2 people.\n\nOf course, portions here were super small so if you plan on having a full blown meal here, be prepared to spend $$$!

It is a bit garlicky, but not overwhelmed with garlic. I always brush my teeth after eating this, but it's so worth it!\n\nFor lunch, my favorite dish is the Kaisen-Don.  It is a divine mix of sea bass, prawns, and scallops in a yummy soy sauce mixture over cabbage, bean sprouts and rice.  The seafood is incredibly fresh and perfectly cooked and seasoned.  This dish never disappoints.\n\nFor happy hour, the makimono sushi platter is a really good deal -- 18 rolls (California, spicy tuna, veggie, or unagi) for $13.  The kara-age (Japanese style fried chicken) is also very good.  (I also love the dish of chilled spinach with peanut sauce.)\n\nOn to the beverages... for an unleaded option, the daily fruit spritzer is always good; for a leaded option, the Giddy Geisha is a pleasantly (but not overwhelmingly) sweet lychee martini.", "author": "Lynn F."}

We usually come here for dinner and the service and food are great, even when they are busy.  We came here for lunch today and the service was absolutely awful.  The waitress took 10 minutes to even acknowledge our presence.  We ordered edamame prior to ordering lunch, 10 minutes later our edamame went to the table next to us, that table arrived after we did btw.  Our waitress was no where to be found for a good 15 minutes. When out waitress finally came to take out lunch order she asked if we had any questions, I asked \"where is our edamame?\", she had a confused look on her face and walked away without taking our order.  She returned 5 minutes later and said there was a \"mix up\" in the kitchen.  She finally took our order, it took 30 minutes to arrive, we asked for the check as soon as we got our food since we didn't know when we would see our waitress  again.  Food was ok.  Our waitress would pass our table multiple times and not even look our way, we tried to get her attention but it was like she was in another world.  Sorry to say we left her the tip she deserved, $2 on a $108 dollar lunch tab.   It should not take over an hour from the time you sit down to the time you get you food.  Get your act together ozumo, your service used to be good.", "author": "Daisy L."}

I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a california roll. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised and, dare I say it, this place went well beyond my expectations. \n\nWe enjoyed a really great bottle of unfiltered chilled sake to start. The razor clam appetizer was ok, not great to be honest but it did have a little kick which I liked. The first roll out was one with lobster, tuna, mango and cilantro topped with caviar. WOW. Just AMAZING! The flavors were terrific together and something unexpectedly light yet intense. No rice on this roll, but some sort of flat bread or crepe like thing. We also enjoyed the filet mignon - I was worried about this because...well, there were no utensils except chop sticks. Fear not, the filet is the most tender piece you'll ever eat. It's served with some grilled green beans wrapped in bacon and a drizzle of pesto sauce which I'd like to take home in a 5 gallon bucket. \n\nDessert was the chocolate fondue. At this point I was full enough but one taste of that chocolate would have made me consider getting another bucket to take that home too. We paired it with a port and it was just fantastic. \n\nOverall one of the best meals I've ever had in my life.", "author": "Ariel G."}

Second time in 2 weeks there.  Two of us placed a last minute dinner reservation but then a friend was nearby. We asked the waiter if it was ok. He said yes but his manager might not be. So we tell the friend 'swing by!'.  After he arrives, we get interrupted 2 additional times to be \"kindly reminded\" that the 3rd person was a courtesy and not generally allowed.  \n\nI totally understand if a restaurant is bustling but there were seats nearby available and Japanese places do not pride themselves on being spacious.  Ozumo is not branded as a place where it's supposed to be romantic.  Why would the waiter and the \"manager\" be so rude to customers?  Especially when we ordered a sufficient amount of food?! Do they understand anything about service and the hospitality the real Japanese display?! Japan and other authentic Japanese places have servers that actually understand what they're saying rather than mumbling japanese to appear like a real Japanese place.  It's over-priced and we went for convenience but seriously forget this place if you're using your money.  It was pretentious and rude.  In the end they didn't even offer the usual dessert menu nor a cup of water for our friend.  Seriously?! Do they even know he's a Yelper Elite with over 1000 reviews?! Even if he wasn't, never ever treat customers like that. If you accept guest and paying customers, treat us like guests.  Not askin for the red carpet but just a little respect.  Eating is a thing people who like people enjoy doing! don't go into any business where you don't understand such basics.\n\nEat at Zushi Puzzle or kiss or at the Embarcadero or Ferry Building instead.

I've noted a couple of hints that might help make the experience the best it can be.  \n\n1) Get your drinks at the bar.  After ordering a bottle of sake, we had an ice bucket almost immediately as a tantalizing reminder of what was to come, but waited almost 20 minutes for the accompanying bottle to materialize.  That said, the bartenders are consistently fast and courteous, and much more helpful in the drinks department.\n\n2) Sit at the sushi bar, if you can.  Again, highlighting the inconsistency of the wait staff, the sushi chefs, by comparison, are personable, knowledgeable, and provide excellent service.  They always have good advice on which fish is the freshest, and I've had good luck entrusting at least a portion of my order to their creativity, by asking them to make their favorite.  \n\nSo...outstanding fish but so-so service and sky-high prices demote what should be a higher-scoring restaurant down to a 3+star experience...but I'll remain optimistic that they can improve.", "author": "Michael S."}

Is that the same thing as overpriced? No, it is not.  It is a very beautiful restaurant in a waterfront view location on a block that includes several other very high end restaurants.  If your point  of reference for Ozumo is your neighborhood sushi place, then you are approaching Ozumo all wrong.\n--Which reminds me.  Ozumu has some sushi on the menu.  That's where the similarity to your neighborhood sushi place ends.  No, it's not \"authentic,\" whatever that means.

It is times like this that I remind myself that I need to start carrying a small flashlight in my purse. \n\nFrom the start, I was very confused with their menu, this was before I even had a sip of the overpriced saki the waiter recommended. We were told that the theme was family style or small plate dishes. We asked the waiter for recommendations and placed our orders. When the first dish came out it contained 3 pieces, which just didn't quite cut the mustard when there were 5 of us. You would expect the waiter at such a trendy, expensive restaurant to be able to do the math. \n\nNext came the sushi rolls, the majority of their rolls have tempura in them. I am not a fan of tempura, so I found the selection very limited. We ordered the Ozuma roll which had grilled unagi in it. It was okay, ended up ordering a second one because one roll only allowed one piece per person. We also ordered a plate of asparagus which was tasty and some other small plate items which were not memorable enough for me to even list here. \n\nFinally, we decided to order the Yosenabe, which is a seafood hot pot, but our waiter suggested that we may like the Shacho Shabu-shabu better. We didn't. It consisted of a few thin slices of rib eye and vegetables and the broth didn't have much flavor. Also, note that the Shabu-shabu was $10 more than the Yosenabe, so we now realized why the waiter suggested it. \n\nSo, after paying the $300 plus bill, we left, feeling moderately ripped off, very poor and still very hungry. Lesson learned - don't trust the recommendations of an inexperienced waiter who obviously didn't know anything about authentic Japanese food at a trendy, very expensive Japanese restaurant.", "author": "Nancy B."}

Longtime good friends, we've always made it a point to catch as many good meals as possible during the brief intervals we are in the same town at the same time.  It's a good way to catch up on gossip, as well as just plain old catch up on each others' lives.  \n\nSince he was stuck in Fidi/Soma area for the duration of his business trip, we kept it simple by going to Ozumo.  I haven't been here for years...last time was for lunch when I was living in NY and came to SF on a business trip myself.  We swung by at 5:00 on my first ever President's Day off (I really mean that first time ever seriously...I've never once had a job that took it as a holiday before).  They were still preparing the place, so we swung around on the chairs of the pier and enjoyed the gorgeous view of a rare sunny February day.\n\nI love the furniture at Ozumo, particularly the stools and chairs.  The dark wood is beautiful and those curving seats are so much more comfortable for my back than a flat stool.  And the whole decor is chic without being annoyingly hip (it's a very fine line between sophisticated chic and cliche chic...with the majority of popular restaurants veering dangerously towards cliche chic).\n\nAs for the food...I ordered two smaller dishes: the beef tartare and shrimp tempura.  I love beef tartare but would never order anywhere but a pricey establishment as I'd be scared of any cheap beef tartare.  And it was wonderful.  A disk of red raw beef with a raw quail egg, some wasabi floating on an endive leaf and a curlicue of another sauce (not sure what was in the sauce).  Mix it all together, and it's a perfect dish for a carnivore.  The shrimp tempura was perfectly nice (I feel that most shrimp tempura I've had in my life has been quite wonderful unless the oil is off...after all, it's fried shrimp.  There's not much that can be bad about that).\n\nService was cordial, if a tad overformal (and not in the Asian sense but sort of \"we are professionals in the high-end restaurant business\" sense.)\n\nBut best of all was my friend absolutely enjoying his sushi (his wife is pregnant, so he's been keeping away from sushi for her benefit.  That's love for you...I doubt I'd give up sushi for anybody.)  Great company, great conversation.  Always makes me a little sad that so many of us are flung in different cities.", "author": "Sooj O."}

This place will definitely be on my list of chill drink spots. \n\nBut my favorite part was the Japanese lessons while using the restroom... When I first walked in and my eyes were adjusting to the light, I heard:\n\n\"Konnichiwa. Ayako desu.\"\n\nI looked up thinking there was a lady working in the bathroom. Then I realized it was a recording. hah... Kinda embarassing, yeah... \n\nBut bathroom lessons are awesome! Especially at a place like this where you can sit at the bar and the chances are pretty high that you can meet someone. My bathroom Japanese lessons would go a little something like this: \n\n\"Kokoni yoku kuru?\" (Do you come here often?)\n\n\"Biiru o nomo?\" (Do you drink beer?)\n\nTo bartender: \"Motto tsuyoi nomimono o kudasai.\" (Stronger drinks please)\n\n\"Ima kara doo suru?\" (What shall we do now?)\n\n\"Hoteru ni ikoo.\" (Let's go to a hotel.)\n\n\"Namete ageru.\" \n\n\"Kuchi no naka itte ii?\"\n\n\"Saikou datta.\"\n\nSorry, but I can't translate the last three phrases.

Ozumo had two people that swarmed us from the moment we entered and immediately began showing us the available places we could sit.   \n\nI didn't know what I was getting into:  Fortunately, Ozumo wasn't a boy with acne and wandering hands.  This place has a great atmosphere. Professional and classy, but not too uptight.\n\nThey were both dim:  Bad thing for the dumb teenager in the late '90s, good thing for Ozumo. I look way better in low-lighting.\n\nReservations are suggested:  Even the boy in high school knew that my time is precious and you need to schedule in advance.  I went here on a Tuesday evening sans reservations and the earliest they could fit us in was 8:45. (Good to know people go out on Tuesday.  Apparently they aren't all like me, rushing home after work to sit in sweats, eat ice cream, and watch The Biggest Loser)  Since it was booked, we opted to be seated by the door, which encouraged people- watching.  Normally, I try to refrain from gawking, but the crowd at Ozumo was almost begging to be watched.  Far be it from me to make beautiful people feel ungawkworthy.  I'm such a giver.\n\nI enjoyed the food:  Now, eating at Ozumo is a little fancier than sharing the sampler at Denny's, but I'm pretty sure everyone but my younger brother will agree with that.  Our dinner: The kobe beef entre was delicious paired with cabernet.  The cod was flakey (just like my date in high school) and incredible.  We also shared a tempura shrimp roll and a California roll.\n\nI didn't pay for either of them:  In high-school, my mom picked up the tab (God bless that woman for feeding my batter-addiction) and last night, my friend picked it up (God bless that man for spending on a meal, what I spend on three months of groceries).\n\nOne difference between Ozumo and my high-school date:  I'll see Ozumo again.", "author": "Janney B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-01-20", "description": "I've been down on Ozumo for a couple of years now, but after last night, it's back in my good graces.\n\nMy frustration was that for such a beautiful restaurant with great food, why was the service so atrocious?  I mean, seriously, it's a crime to spend a fat wad of cash, only to be subjected to long waits and general apathy.  \n\nThe key may be to go with a larger party and get one of the private rooms.  There were 10 of us last night in the sake-tasting room, which is a delightful spot to enjoy a meal with good friends.  It's a shoes-off affair in this room, so make sure your socks are in good order and try to pee before you sit down.  \n\nWe started with the edamame - 1 each of the salted and garlic.  I always prefer the salted.  For my appetizer, I got the sashimi martini which was pieces of yellowtail, tuna & salmon with a spicy sauce and seaweed at the bottom.  The fish was extremely fresh and tender, and the sauce added a nice bit of unexpected flavor, but was not overpowering.  I also ordered uni with a quail egg which is my usual guilty pleasure these days...and the pieces were huge and delicious.\n\nI think one of my other frustrations with Ozumo is that I always felt that the sushi menu was limited, so I decided to try a regular entree for a change - and I am so glad I did.  I ordered the Gindaro, which is marinated black cod.  It was delicious.  The sauce was a wonderful mixture of salty, tangy and sweet - hard to describe but really great flavor, and the fish was incredibly tender.  I love the skin as a contrast to the soft texture of the fish - it gives you something to chew on.  At first the portion looked tiny (and for $24, I was surprised), but it turned out to be an ample amount and worth the price.\n\nI also tasted one of the hot pots, which is definitely on my must-have list  of dishes for next time.  It was the Iron Pot Sukiyaki, and the broth was so flavorful, with tender pieces of beef, vegetables, and a large bowl of miso sauce on the side for added flavor.\n\nThey have an extensive sake menu, with a lot being offered by the glass, which I like.  I had one glass of filtered sake, and one glass of unfiltered - I have forgotten which ones they were but the staff is good at making recommendations according to your taste.\n\nMost importantly, the service was very good and the server seemed to genuinely care about our experience.  Plus it seems like we had our own staff of busboys to clear the plates.  Everything came at the same time, and in a reasonable amount of time.  BIG improvement from the past few times I've been there.\n\nThe bar on Friday night is a clusterfuck, so unless you like to have your drink knocked out of your hand on a regular basis, I'd avoid it.  It is a great deal on a weekday night for drinks and half-price sushi at Happy Hour.\n\nWe ended up paying around $130 per couple including tip, which is expensive, but for a special night out, not unreasonable in my opinion.  And now that the service is back on track, I no longer feel like I am being hosed.", "author": "Liz S."}

This place is also huge, has tons of different seating areas from the main dining rooms, to the big bar set ups and the small private sake tasting room.  \n\nService was attentive, and the Giddy Geishas (cocktail) sounded AMAZING. i'm DEFINITELY getting it next time..Smirnoff vodka, lychee juice & passion fruit puree. OMG..only reason i didn't get it was 'cause i had to budget myself and @ $11/cocktail...not exactly cheap and affordable. \n\nI started off with an order of warm, garlic soy sauce edamame, and it was yummmm...i mean, you can't really mess up edamame, but @ $6/bowl, again, way too pricey. I mean, come on! garlic soy sauce soy beans. yea. \n\nI decided on the Ozumo roll, grilled unagi & cucumber roll topped with snow crab, tuna, avocado & spicy sauce.  This was phenomenol.  The roll was also huge, so very much worth the $18 tag. Damn this roll was good. \n\nmy girlfriends got tempura which was flaky, crispy, had mushrooms, a good variety of veggies, and even tempura noodles!  The Dragon, tempura shrimp roll wrapped in grilled unagi & avocado with sweet soy sauce. Also delicious.  \n\nThe very long & extensive list of Sake & Ginjo is impressive for any sake connoisseur. \n\nThe desserts were...eh =( so sad. the warm chocolate& azuki bean mochi was a disappointment.  just very bland.  We also got the green tea ice cream crepe roll...and it was so tasteless. There was barely any green tea ice cream, i mean, the dish barely even registed COLD, there was just way too much crepe and it was blah blah blah.

I'm the type of girl who's heart goes all aflutter for good design. And Ozumo did it for me indeed. \n\nThe sake lounge in the front is a bit of a hormone-soaked pick-up scene, full of downtown suits and hopeful cleavage. Usually places are like this are more concerned with pheromones than food, so I was initially pretty turned off. But my food friend insisted that the sushi here was fantastic, so his word prevailed. \n\nWe thought our waitress was helpful when we ordered - cheerfully recommending dishes and steering us away from others. We ended up getting a couple forgettable appetizers, the sashimi setto dinner and two rolls.  We relayed to the sushi chefs that we were willing to get a little adventurous with the sashimi. \n\nThe result? \n\nOur sashimi set was everything sashimi should be. You know like when you pop a piece of sashimi in your mouth,  close your eyes to intensify the sensory experience, and simultaneously sigh in deep pleasure? Yeah. Like that. (I KNOW I'm not the only one who does this!)\n\nAs for the rolls. What the HELL were we thinking?  I usually don't order rolls, but the waitress was insistent that they were the best dish of the night. And they were HORRIBLE. The fillings were some variation of imitation crab salad, BOTH of them. And the rice was simultaneously dried out and mushy. How this is possible, I don't know. Suffice it to say, the rolls were left unfinished. \n\nThank god for the sake flight to wash down the roll debacle. If you're interested in exploring sake, I'd highly recommend the flight, which gives you a tasting of different sake types. An explanatory card helps you along, so you, too, can taste for the \"wonderful viscous, creamy texture with hints of lemon peel and sandalwood\".  One flight is perfect for two. \n\nAn incidental note: Hypothetically speaking, if you happen to be driving your friend's car home, (perfectly sobered up, thank you)  and a cop pulls you over for, say, a broken tail light. The cop just might be able to still smell the sake on your breath when he leans in to talk to you. Hypothetically speaking. \n\nSo yes, back to the food. Food friend and I left a bit puzzled. The sashimi and the sake were perfection The rolls seemed like they were pulled from the dumpster of a midwestern all-you-can-eat sushi joint. Probably the most uneven food experience I've ever had. \n\nIn my ramblings through this city, I'm sure I'll end up at Ozumo again.

I've been before, but it was a couple of years ago and I had good memories of the place.  Last night reminded me why I liked it so much, and had me asking why it's been so long since I've been back.\n\nThe food was awesome- first, the sushi.  My girlfriend & one of our friends had the sushi and they absolutely loved it.  I'm not exactly a sushi connoisseur, but I will say this: the sushi chef's there should be called sushi artists.  The way they laid it out made it look amazing.\n\nWe had a variety of appetizers, and my favorite was the hamachi with jalapenos.  I wish I could remember the name of it - unfortunately I'm horrible at this.  My entree was great as well - some sort of filet mignon with bacon & mushrooms in a sauce that was just incredible.\n\nBeyond the great food the service was amazing.  Our server, again my memory is horrible (I blame the drinks!) was a girl named Danci, and she was really amazing.  All smiles, and extremely helpful.  My buddies convinced me to try some saki (I'm usually a cocktails sort of guy) and Danci helped us find a bottle of unfiltered saki that was as good as I could have imagined.  I might be a convert!  Thank god for friendly, knowledgeable staff, right?\n\nAnyway, the end of the meal was as good as the beginning, though honestly I didn't eat much of the desert as I was already in food coma.\n\nSure, the place is a bit pricey, but you should go in expecting that - and the food and service are totally worth it.  I'll definitely be going much more often, and who knows, maybe next time I'll try another saki :)", "author": "Michael B."}

We ordered martinis and beers - - sat in comfortable \"booths\" with nicely-cushioned benches, and had a ball.  I love the atmosphere here in the front room - bar area.  Since then, I've frequented Ozumo a lot, but never reviewed it because this place is, first and foremost, a restaurant.  But, when wanting sushi, I always seem to end up somewhere else rather than coming here!  I was finally able to order from their late-night menu a couple of months back - - and in all fairness, it was past midnight and perhaps not exemplary of their normal cuisine - - but the sushi was FAR from good.  The sushi at Chaya next door is actually better, and theirs is nothin' to write home about either.  So, this review is for the bar portion only - - I reserve my opinion on Ozumo food.\n\nOther times, we've gone here after dinner to finish off the night here w/ good drinks.  \n\nOnce, I walked in here to meet a man who, at that time, was \"bigger than life\" to me.  Funny that this was only one of many, many nights at Ozumo before and since that night, but I recall that one moment... perhaps because he turned out to be such a dud, or perhaps because it's rare, but so enjoyable, to feel dreamy about someone, even if it's all based on bullshit or my imagination.  One can't help what one's brain insists on recalling.\n\nAnd then, on other nights like last night, it's just a chill place for two girls to hang out and drink.  Of course, by the time we got to Ozumo, Jacey was pretty well into a state of giddiness, mixed in with umpteen runs to the restroom - too funny.  Guys found it adorable nonetheless - and it was good material for conversation.  :-)  Silly girl.... \"Unni... you got me all ^&$%& up.... hee hee hee hee.  Who's this guy?  Oh hellooooooo hee hee hee!\"  So cute!! Or some guy will approach her and start talking, and she says, \"Oh yeah, you're the one who was sitting here earlier... oh dear... no you're not.  Unni, he's not, right?  HEE HEE HEE\".  Oh, dear, indeed!  Time to zoom zoom out of Ozumo, girlie.... hahaha!!\n\nAnyhow - - Ozumo's sake selection is impressive - and I think I've now had as much of the unfiltered Nigori sake here as I've had my dirty Martinis.  \nThey have valet up in front, always a good thing.\nSeating is very important in a lounge atmosphere, and Ozumo's seating is comfortable and inviting.  Lighting is just dark enough to make you look good - haha, but light enough that there's nothing you miss either.  Music is loud enough to get you in the mood, but never too loud that you can't hold a long conversation.  Atmosphere here is just good.\n\nAll that said - - I don't know what their business schedule is - - sometimes, last call feels really late, and other nights - - last call seems to come entirely too quickly!", "author": "Grace K."}

The interior dining area is not.\n\nService - Our server was very attentive - to the point of overly so.  He was very good about filling up our water glasses, but he would also reshuffle our plates and practically reorganize our table while we were still eating.  Attentive - yes...borderline annoying...yes\n\nFood - the quality was good.  I wouldn't say it was the best sushi I've ever had, nor was it the most creative, but it was above average.  The saki was good.  But for $150 bottle, it had better be DAMN good..hehe\n\nWould I go back to Ozumo?  Probably not.", "author": "Johnny C."}

Of the multitude of places, one of my favorites was Ozumo.  With a dim trendy decor, plenty of tables (including areas with tatami mats), and the ability to sit at a sushi bar, order robata grilled items, or have a drink at the sake lounge area (they also serve wine, beer, and spirits as well), this place has it all.\n\nThe sushi here is the freshest I have ever had.  Like butter in my mouth, the pieces of toro and hamachi melted the moment they left my chopsticks.  For rolls, I really enjoyed the savory Ozumo roll (unagi + cucumber topped with snow crab, avocado, tuna, and spicy sauce).  The spicy sauce was more tasty than spicy and the biggest contributor to the \"you can't eat just one\" mentality that developed during my dining experience here.\n\nAlthough Ozumo is quite pricey, I will definitely be back.  Probably more times as a happy hour spot, rather than a dinner place.", "author": "Herman N."}

So my expectations were very high (probably more so on myself than on the restaurant.)  We booked the beautiful Kotatsu room months in advance and were eager to find out how the families feel about this restaurant.\n\nKotatsu room seats 12 people comfortably.  The space is pretty and fun and secluded.  However, the walls are not completely enclosed so the loud techno music from the bar will overpower the whole room.  You sit on the ground level but your feet dip into the trough below the table so you appear siting Japanese style, but really you are sitting on a bench comfortably.  The two kids with us were ecstatic about the room.  They have enough space to run around or lay down and the music only fuels their already every-growing energy.  The only inconvenience, besides not able to converse quietly, is that it's hard for the wait staff to squeeze in behind you to serve you.  I feel bad for their backs, but they were attentive and didn't seem to mind crawling back and forth.\n\nPersonally, I didn't care for the food so much.  About half of us had the Omakase menu, which I had been salivating for a while.  But it was only alright.  Plating, flavor, and choice of ingredients were not as refined or as interesting as other more authentic Japanese restaurants I have been to.  But after all, this is a trendy hip environment catered to Happy Hour folks with a fat business expense account.  Not exactly the type of place that encourages you to close your eyes and slowly savor the details of the dishes in serenity. \n\nFor us who had the Omakase menu, We had miso soup with chunks of crab meat, a hamachi appetizer, lamb cubes on a skewer, grilled salmon, a plate of sushi and sashimi, giant scallop on a bed of risotto, beef, and a pretty plate of fruit/mochi with chocolate fondue.  It's an enormous amount of food but none really that memorable.  \n\nSome who opted for a la carte menu had the kobe beef, which was so good that they exclaimed they'll be dreaming about it for years to come.  Sounds like it was worth the $105 price tag.  \n\nWith some miscellaneous stuff like rice, one cocktail, a pot of tea, and endless bottles of Voss water, the tab was an astonishing $1500 including tax and tips.  So if you ever worry about not able to meet the $1000 requirement for the room, I don't think it'll be a problem.  \n\nOverall, the experience was very enjoyable.  We were able to get seated way before our reservation time and never felt rushed to leave.  Ozumo is able to please many different palates and personalities and ages, including people who don't even like Japanese food.  I highly recommend it for a special occasion for a group of people with diverse taste.", "author": "Candice B."}

Who's ever heard of Shabu Shabu served in a tiny bowl of overly salty broth over some weak coal? The worst thing about the Shabu Shabu was that the water wasn't boiling. We asked the waiter if that was part how it was supposed to work since our beef had been sitting in the broth uncooked in non-boiling water and he wasn't quite sure, but agreed that the water did seem a little too luke warm to cook food in it and brought it back into kitchen to heat up the broth up a little bit more.  The Gyu Filet was actually pretty decent, but overpriced.\nWe had Ginger Ice-Cream with Red Bean and Mochi for dessert, which was okay.\n\nOur Waitress was slow.

I have had much better sushi experiences at other places, at a much more reasonable price. Using fancy words in the menu or putting fancy sauce strokes on a plate does not mean you hike up the price. And if you are looking for a fine dining Japanese cuisine, then I expect the quality and taste to be top notch (Chaya, it's neighbour, is a good example). But if I were to close my eyes and eat the sushi, I would think I'm having some Bento packaged sushi in your local grocery store. May be we ordered the wrong things? May be sushi is not Ozumos forte, as opposed to the fish steaks? I do not know. But then don't jack up the price to 23 bucks for a sushi roll with 4 pieces, cammman people!

Their washu beef \"hot-pot\" is also great--soft pieces of tender beef in a warm and slightly sweet miso-broth. Yum!\n\nService has always been nice, attentive, and quick. Nothing super special though.  Also, it is pretty loud inside the restaurant.\n\nIf you don't like fu-fu food then you won't like ozumo, and it is not a traditional japanese place.

It was a sort of thick pumpkin miso porridge sprinkled with pistachios.  I enjoyed it but was very different for a miso soup.\r\n\r\nNext...sushi/sashimi -\r\nWe ordered the Ama Ebi nigiri - It was very fresh.  However, we never go the deep fried ebi heads like you normally get.  We thought that our sushi chef may have forgotten and reminded him but he said that they don't do that here.  Humm...a bit odd.  Never heard that before...\r\nIn general, we felt the nirigi orders were fresh but a bit on the thin side.\r\n\r\nThen, for sashimi, we order the 5-piece Toro.  It was fresh but disappointing.  The sashimi slices were almost paper thin; not chunky like we were used to.  Again....hummm....a bit odd.  Didn't feel like we got our money's worth with this order.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to have the spanish mackeral nigiri.  And the sushi chef suggested a different kind of mackeral which was very fresh and to our liking (forget the name of this fish).  We liked it enough to place another encore order of it.\r\n\r\nThe service was okay until we felt rushed at the end by our waitress who seemed to be ending her shift.  We didn't like that.  We hadn't been sitting for long.\r\n\r\nAlso, the sushi chef was very kind and entertaining.  However, our sushi order arrived a bit slower than what we are normally used to.  Not that we want to feel rushed to order more and more, but we were hungry and the pace was a bit slow.\r\n\r\nSo, at the end of the meal, we both felt that we were satisfied but not enough to come back for more sushi here.

And yes, in the bathrooms there are Japanese language instructional tapes playing...pretty fun. \n\nThe menu is fabulous and extensive with sushi, robata, exotic seafood plates, even some pedestrian chicken and beef selections (though I don't know why you would order that with the great seafood on the menu).  I don't drink much sake, so when I opened the drink menu and saw the dozens of sake selections I pleaded ignorant to our young, pretty blonde server.  She suggested several and then offered to bring three samples for us to try, free of charge.  How about that!\n\nSo we tasted and selected, while sipping a tasy miso soup and munching on edamame.  We ordered small plates of hamachi and tuna, both expertly prepared and delicious.  Wonderful food. \n\nWe had a beautiful view of the bay bridge as twilight settled over the bay, and the food, the drink, and the atmosphere was simply entrancing.  I think I'm falling in love...but got to go back to LA tomorrow!", "author": "Steve G."}

We told the waiter to 'wow' us, and I wasn't too wowed.  This is no Matsuhisa (Beverly Hills), and the sushi, although good wasn't fantastic.\n\nThe much ballyhooed yellow tail came drenched in some soy mix that made it way too salty.  The tuna sashimi was cold and very firm--not unlike the way you get it at some cheaper Korean/Japanese restaurants.  The desserts, well, although good did nothing to really compliment the type of foods we had been eating, ie, it was too rich vs. palatte cleansing.\n\nThere were some good things, however...the white tuna sashimi was the right temperature and melted in your mouth.  Why the other tuna didn't do this remains a mystery.  We ordered a nigori, unfiltered sake to wash everything down--the bottle the waiter brought us was fantastic.  The sweetness of the nigori sake was the right compliment to saltiness of soy.\n\nSo, for the expense of the meal vs. what you get...it was overall disappointing.  Again, would of preferred to spend the same dough at Matsuhisa, whose food is sublime.  I think that LA and NYC has the best Japanese restaurants--more innovative and daring.  Still hopeful that there would be one here, though.", "author": "Nancy H."}

But there is no denying, the food is delicious. Despite the small portions and confused servers, the miso-flavored fried calamari was so tender, it could and would melt in your mouth. \n\nWith all restaurants, let's start with the critique of the food. We ordered the shacho which is the most expensive roll on the list, for 23 dollars, we got 6-8  pieces of lobster and tuna rolled up in a little petite package. As tasty as the spicy scallop roll. Both great and fresh, but quickly off the plates because it was that small. \nI felt cheated most when we ordered grilled asparagus, for 9 bucks we got two skewers of asparagus that equals two sticks. Like I previously mentioned, good but very, very small portions. \n\nNext, to review the service. Perhaps it was during dinner but twice they messed up on our order. The first one was to our benefit because we got a miso crap soup that was meant for the people sitting at the bar two seats down. The second time, they gave our food to the wrong person, actually to the guy who the soup was meant for. Yikes. \n\nLocation. Our luck ran out because we had to pay 12 dollars to valet. After five minutes of circling the Embarcadero, it made more sense.", "author": "Thia T."}

We were seated quickly in the quieter back room and had a fantastic waitress, Natasha.  I have a non-life threatening gluten intolerance and she was super informed and helpful with the menu.  The problem was that the majority of our drinks and food was delivered by another lady, (not fantastic Natasha) who switched stuff up for every course.  First, our drink order was delivered all out of whack, but we easily switched them around.  No problem.  Then, we were all given an amuse bouche and I asked if it was gluten free.  She said half of it was so I ate the other half and it was delightful.  She came back a few minutes later to say it actually wasn't.  Since it was only the size of my fingernail, I wasn't too troubled by it.  However, my fantastic squid dish which should have been made with tamari instead of soy sauce, must have gotten mixed up with my husbands because I ended up with horrible joint pain by the end of the meal.

Once she arrived, I had to pull one of the two bartenders in this small bar over after 5-7 minutes of staring them down. And they weren't even busy. A nice wine was suggested for her and we were off to our table. The Tuna Tartare was recommended by all and so we started with that. It was BLAND. Unfortunately this was the best thing we had all night. Next the Cuttle Fish was a special and it came out tough and ok as far as the flavor. So, like a bad better, I was chasing at this point and I ordered the signature roll. The Ozumo roll. I've had better Sushi at a 1/roll joint in LA, just saying. So, overall the experience was BLAND and my bill for two people was $35 at the bar, for two drinks, and $155 for the meal and a couple of drinks. Not worth it.

The restaurant was about 1.5 miles away from the hotel where I was staying, so a colleague and I walked it over to the restaurant. It was a beautiful night for a walk. We met up with the rest of our party of seven for our reservation and were promptly seated at the back of the restaurant even though it was really busy for a Wednesday night anywhere. The restaurant is located right off The Embarcardero, so from where we were seated, we could see the bay.\n\nThe exterior of the restaurant is so trendy that I thought I'd be under-dressed (wearing jeans and a t-shirt) because it felt like I was walking into a club. The bar/lounge makes up the first half of the restaurant and the dining/sushi bar is in the back half of the restaurant. Both ends were full when we arrived.\n\nSome people in our party usually don't do sushi or raw foods, but all the dishes were so beautifully presented that they were willing to try almost everything. Our server was very knowledgeable about the food and gave us several great recommendations. We started off with drinks,  a round of miso soups with tofu and wakame, and two different kinds of edamame soy beans (cold lightly salted and the other with a garlic-soy sauce).\n\nThen we moved into various small plates, trying a piece of everything: Hanabi (slices of hamachi and avocado drizzled with a warm ginger and jalapeno ponzu sauce), Futago (grilled Washu beef, sauteed garlic spinach and Japanese eggplant served with miso sesame sauce), Gyu Filet (grilled angus filet mignon sliced and served with shiitake mushrooms and arima sansho sauce), Ozumo roll (grilled unagi and cucumber roll topped with snow crab, tuna, avocado and spice sauce), Sekiwake roll (spicy tuna roll with cucumber and tempura flakes, wrapped in salmon and hamachi),  and the Spider roll (tempura soft shell crab, tobiko, kaiware and cucumber) among other items. Everything was wonderful.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the dark chocolate pot de creme in a sesame Florentine cup, a light and fluffy cream puff dessert and also a chocolate fondue with Japanese-style pastries with a fresh and edible hibiscus flower. All were delicious.\n\nI also understand that if you go to the restroom, you get to learn Japanese phrases played over the speakers. In the women's restroom, my colleagues were trying to learn how to say \"Have you seen my husband?\" In the men's restroom, \"My wife is looking for me.\" Both of which we thought was pretty hilarious but makes dining at Ozumo a little more memorable.", "author": "Kayee I."}

Price wasn't too bad at around $50.  So the second time I went, I noticed it wasn't on the menu anymore.  =(  I asked the waiter where it went, and he said, we have real kobe beef now, and pointed to the real kobe beef with \"mp\" next to it.  I now know that \"mp\" means Market Price, and from now on, it will be synonymous with \"expensive\".   Needless to say I had the short ribs, and it was pretty good too.\n\n*update*  came here and had shabu shabu.  Yum!", "author": "Casey F."}

Good happy hour place, good and reasonably priced sushi specials at the bar, cool vibe.  Dinner in the main room is Japanese w/ both sushi and cooked food.  I prob give it 4-4.5 stars for bar or happy hour, 3-3.5 stars for sit-down dinner.\n\nWent last night for a splurge dinner here, For some reason they weren't offering the $125 omakase (chef's selection set menu) , so we just had our waiter pick out his favorite stuff.  The waiter was excellent and put together a great mix of selections for us.  Service overall was very solid from both our knowledgeable waiter and all the other support staff.\n\nGot started with some Masumi Nanago Daiginjo sake for $135.  Dry, but a little richer, fruitier, and fuller bodied than most dry sakes.  I thought this was good but not great.  Also had some hot tea and some edamame to munch on.\n\nStarted dinner with a platter of sashimi.  The toro was awesome as expected.  I generally don't love shrimp much, but the sweet prawn was really great.  The Beni Toro (salmon belly) was new to me and pretty good, very interesting taste/texture.  Hawaiian kanpachi was very good.  A couple of other things were somewhat ordinary, but nothing was bad.  Overall the sashimi was very good, but not great.\n\nNext did a platter of nigiri.  Again the toro was awesome, everything else was OK.  The hirame (halibut) was not very good.  Also, had some sort of beef nigiri that sorta sucked.  Had a Bucho roll - tempura shrimp and other stuff, that was very good.  I'd say nigiri course was just OK.\n\nThen on to some Japanese dishes.  We also got another bottle of sake here, an $80 bottle of wakatake daiginjo onikoroshi (devil killer!) that is much dryer and crisper than the first.  I preferred this sake to the more expensive first bottle.\n\nThe hanabi is the best thing here.  Delicious thin slices of hamachi with slices of avocado plus a sweet jalapeno sauce.  We got another plate of this it was so good.  For anyone who has been to Nobu, this is similar in nature to the yellowtail jalapeno dish there.  At $16/plate, this is a bargain.\n\nNext had futago.  This is beef with eggplant and spinach.  I thought it was sorta tasteless and pretty much sucked. Uh, I do not recommend, obv.\n\nNext we had gindara - miso black cod.  I'm generally a huge fan of miso cod, and this was definitely good, but I would say it was just about average for this dish.  I've definitely had better, more flavorful, miso cod dishes elsewhere.  Still, it was fine.\n\nAt this point the waiter asked if we wanted more food.  Since we were splurging, we said yeah for sure, what are you thinking?  He said how about either some scallops or some kobe beef, then finish out with some light miso soup.  We said, what the hell, send some scallops and some kobe beef, then some soup, great!\n\nHotate - scallops on a mushroom risotto.  Delicious, very rich dish.  Definitely recommend.  The scallops were pretty good, thought not great (I thought they were just a little tougher than they should be, maybe just a touch overcooked).  But the risotto was rich and perfect.  Overall very good dish.\n\nThe kobe beef was six TINY slices of beef with some fresh wasabi, special salt, and fine soy.  By tiny, I mean TINY.  Like smaller than a piece of sashimi.  Anyway, it was pretty delicious beef, definitely very tasty.  But later we noticed that those six tiny pieces cost $105, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA RIDICULOUS.  I'm glad I wasn't paying for this dinner!  I'd definitely recommend getting 7 plates of hanabi instead of kobe gyu.\n\nFinished off dinner with some miso soup, which was very good.\n\nFor dessert had chocolate fondue with some fruits and mochi ice cream, which is, well, pretty good but pretty much exactly what you expect from some melted chocolate and stuff to dip in it.  Also had a sesame panna cotta, which I liked but my friends thought was sorta weird.  I'm a big panna cotta fan and thought it was pretty good, though I bet a lot of people would find the sesame taste a little too intense.  Also, the sauce was grey, which is sorta weird.\n\nWe were pretty stuffed, definitely could have done with one less course, maybe two.\n\nTotal for dinner for 3 was $655, so after tip was $780.  At $260 per, this was definitely very expensive for what we had.  However, if I were to do this dinner again (and I was paying), I'd skip the $105 kobe plate and have an $80 bottle instead of $135 for the first one, which would have made dinner about $480, or about $190 per after tip, which is much more in line with other high-end restaurants in SF.  Definitely a very good high-end Japanese meal in a cool restaurant, but I can't really see spending this much for dinner when there are so many great sushi and fine-dining places in SF, most of which cost less than here.\n\nSome sashimi, rolls, and hanabi would probably be a pretty good and reasonably priced dinner here.", "author": "Deva H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-11-19", "description": "Sushi has undeniably become the darling of the trendy dining circuit in the last decade or so and inevitably, many establishments have put forth a concerted effort to haute-ify the minimalist art of raw fish preparation.  There are two distinct approaches to this trend: the movement from West to East (think Ron Siegel and the Dining Room) and East to West (Ozumo and Cha-Ya) come to mind).\n\nThe fundamental difference between the two vectors is that the West-East integration is much more complete and harmonious (at least when successful).  Siegel, David Kinch, et al have taken European techniques, integrated Japanese sensibilities and ingredients, and are now creating food that is more than the sum of its parts.  Their cuisine worships at the altar of the ingredient, relying on simplicity and clarity.  For this reason, they are at the forefront of Bay Area gastronomy.\n\nThe East-to-West approach has yet to find a way to synthesize the purity of Japanese cuisine and the technique of the French, possibly because of an unwillingness to compromise.  Sushi is best when the unadorned ingredient speaks for itself; when attempts are made to complicate nigiri and sashimi, most of the time, the result is muddled and flavors don't meld.  \n\nOzumo, which proclaims itself to be a purveyor of \"contemporary Japanese cuisine\" shines brightest when the \"contemporary\" is taken out of the equation.  The restaurant consistently sources some of the best fish in the city but its inventiveness is stymied by an inability to venture past the established sushi norms.  It, like many others, takes the \"more is more\" approach to dishes, weaving together myriad primary flavors or stuffing rolls with several types of fish.\n\nHowever, those that order sashimi or nigiri are in for a real treat.  The supremely fresh, unctuous, glistening morsels are as tasty as anything served by traditional sushi joints.  And there's the rub.  Ozumo is the ne plus ultra purveyor of perfect and perfectly consistent fish, but it just can't deliver on its promise of \"contemporary\" Japanese cuisine.", "author": "Yan G."}

The atmosphere and decor were trendy-upscale.  The service was REALLY slow that night.  We ordered five rolls and the crispy tofu.  Our waitress forgot to put in the order for one of our rolls.  At one point, our table was empty for 20 minutes as we waited for the next roll to come out.  Each order had about 5 or 6 bite sized pieces (not big at all).  The hamachi roll had some small and thin slices of fish on top...emphasis on small and thin.  All the rolls, themselves, were good, but the portions were just way too small.\n\nWe also had 3 orders of sake and 3 chocolate mochi ice creams for dessert.  They served a small scoop of green tea ice cream (tastes like vanilla to me, not enough green tea flavor) with chocolate drizzle, red bean topping, and 3 nickel size mochi balls (no filling) surrounding the ice cream.  It tasted okay, but not impressive.  They gave us Chinese spoons to eat dessert with.  I'm not sure if that's suppose to contribute to trendiness, but  they were not the right shape for scooping up melted ice cream from a plate.  Trendy is better if someone keeps practicality in mind too.  Plus those spoons are like 10 cents at the Chinese kitchen stores.\n\nWe had suggested ordering more food for our guests before dessert , but they said they were full.  We think they were being polite, because on the way home, I asked my fiance if he was full and he said no.  I wasn't full either (and I'm not talking about busting pants full, just comfortably full).  Our total bill came out to $180.  I guess if you need to feel cool, eat here so you can be seen, but if you want to feel like you are getting your money's worth (like if feeling somewhat full is important to you after a $45pp dinner) then skip this place.", "author": "Nancy T."}

I read about this place before yelp so I came expecting a restaurant with decent to good food but generally overpriced because you're paying for the atmosphere.  I think the overall reviews of the place are pretty accurate.  I ordered the braised short ribs and a spider roll and the short ribs were very tender, which was good, but I thought the sauce was a bit salty.  The spider roll was good, but I've had good spider rolls at many places, so it's nothing out of the ordinary.  \n\nThey did have a gigantic sake menu so if you're there for that, you wont be disappointed.  \n\nOn a side note, one of my friends noticed that on their menu, they have two areas with the same words written in Chinese which basically meant meat dishes but one had all vegetarian dishes.  Also, while you're in the restroom, they have something playing that teaches you Japanese words.  \n\nOverall it's more of a 3 1/2 star place.

Once we did, the seaweed salad disappointed us both, as we expected it to be, well, green, pure and simple.  Theirs apparently has several varieties..(read:  a little too exotic for seaweed salad purists.)  We did enjoy the sushi...(though their version of the Philly roll surprised us with COOKED salmon).

I have to keep reminding myself that this is an upscale sushi restaurant with prices to match. I also sat alone at the bar. If I went with a group and sat at a table my experience may be different.  I really choose it because I am staying at the hotel next door and wanted something close by. \n\nI ordered the Tataki salad and miso glazed Black Cod with the house sake and a large Sapporo.  I thought the sake was pretty good.  I wish i knew more about sake.  I dont remember seeing one on the menu, but a sake sampler might be a good way to try a few.  My salad came around 15 min later.  It was good, but not stelar.  \n\nThe bar area was starting to fill up and the bartenders were focused on making drinks.  I saw a waiter drop off a few items at the bar and wondered if one was mine.  They sat there for a good 7 min before the bartender saw them. And of course, one of them was my Cod.  The bartender handed it to me and quickly ran off without asking if I needed anything else and it took another few minutes to flag her down again to get some silverware.  By now, my Cod was cold. I should have said something but I was pretty hungry and didn't want to wait any longer.  It was nicely plated, but didn't come with anything else.  For $28, I thought it would be served with a starch and/or vegetable.  With that said, I thought it tasted great and was cooked nicely.  But I was still starving and knew it would cost at least another $30-40 if I ordered more. So I decided to cut my loses and leave.  All total, my bill was $82 including tip.  Pretty expensive for cold cod and still being hungry.  I guess I should know better though.

There were 9 of us and they automatically reserved one of their private rooms for us without telling us.  Luckily they were nice enough to call the day of our reservation and tell us that there is a $1000 minimum charge for the room.  There was no way we wanted to spend that much but they said they would waive it since they didn't tell us that before and it was the day of the reservation.  So that was nice.\n\nWe get there and the place looks nice and swanky.  We went to the private room which was small and enclosed in glass and we had to take our shoes off.  There was a random portable A/C unit in one corner which was kind of odd.  They should integrate that into one of the walls but they can't really since it's all glass walls.\n\nThe food was great.  The food was also very expensive.  Presentation was great.  However presentation doesn't make food taste better.  I prefer cheaper food over atmosphere/swankiness.  However I won't deduct stars for that because we knew what we were getting ourselves into and it's not like going here would be a common occurrence.  We spent around $600 for 9 people when all was said and done.  This included 2 bottles of sake.\n\nAnyway it is great if you want to spend a lot of money.  If you want the private room they probably will keep the $1000 minimum intact.  Also there is a $20 per person cancellation fee for the room and they take your credit card number when reserving.

Now, this whole thing about the kitchen closing at 2pm, which btw, we did not know until our server barked at us, yes barked, \"kitchen closing. what do you want?\" Something like that...anyways, if someone walks in to a restaurant at about 1:30ish, not knowing the kitchen closes at 2pm, shouldn't the host or hostess say something to the guest first??

Fortunately there was room at the sushi bar in the main dining room, and for the next 2  hours we were treated to wonderful fish and delightful sake. My thanks to Jessica for letting us sample so many sakes and Hiroto for his artistry.\n\nWe began the meal with a bottle of an amazing nama sake, the Tedorigawa \"Arabashiri.\" Tedorigawa is one of Japan's oldest brewers and they make sake using the most traditional techniques. The result is beautiful: light, sweet, smooth, clean, silky, floral and effervescent are all descriptors that come to mind. It is a blockbuster and reason enough to visit Ozumo while they still have stock. Later in the evening we also drank the Genshu nama from Dewazakura and an old stanby, the Denshu. But, the Tedorigawa stole the show.\n\nTo match our wonderful sake we began with a sashimi sampler that included Maguro, Hirame, Hamachi, Sake and then Kona Kanpachi, Toro and salmon belly. Both the Kona Kanpachi and salmon belly are unusual, and the Toro was perfectly marbled.\n\nFrom there we ordered nigiri. Each was wonderful but highlights include their Umi Masu (an ocean trout unlike anything I have tried before), the Amaebi (so sweet and delicious) and the Anago (beautifully concentrated flavor). The Shima Aji was also wonderful last night, and both salmon and Hamachi approached best-ever status. As good as the Maguro, the Shiro Maguro, the Hotate and Albacore were, they were esclipsed by the other offerings. We also ordered a half dozen Kumamoto Oysters and Hiroto made us a salad of crab, salmon and salmon roe in appreciation for the sake we were sharing.\n\nDinner was not inexpensive, but a day later I'm still marveling at how good it was. I like Ozumo, but previous meals were never that good. I can only conclude that sitting at the sushi bar made a big difference, and I can't wait to return to test my theory.", "author": "Paul J."}

I thought we were at a nicer edgier version of Blowfish, until we were escorted back to the main dining area. \n\nThis area was more brightly lit. I felt like I went from some neo noir lounge in a Tokyo cyberpunk chapter to a \"bistro no Kyoto\".  Our server was really nice and extremely knowledgable about every dish, as well as the sake flight I partook in.\n\nThe calimari is cooked to a perfection beyond what I thought was possible with squid. It was amazing. The miso soup was very standard, but I mean how creative can you get with miso soup anyways? \n\nWe got the spicy tuna and spicy scallop rolls for our sushi course. These were both amazing, although the sauce was pretty standard.\n\nOur main courses were where our impression of this restaurant went from good to great. I got the gyu-don which were steak cubes seared medium rare and served with this insane japanese mustard and caramelized onions.\n\nLet me digress a minute on this japanese mustard business. Obviously it was infused with a healthy dose of wasabi radish, but this stuff was out of this world. Einstein must have thought up the atomic bomb after having this dish. It was amazing.\n\nThe sake salmon dish was probably the best cooked fish I've ever had. I'm not really into seafood, sans sushi, but this made me want to eat it more often. It really was top notch.\n\nIt was my girlfriend's birthday so they brought out this cool black tea cream gelatto desert infused with berries that I really enjoyed. Overall this was the best japanese restaurant I've been to in SF and am kicking myself for not going there sooner.\n\nBelieve it or not its really not that expensive. $130 got us some good wine/sake and enough food to fill us both up and then some.

The second I sat down the waitress asked if I was ready to order, I said I needed a few minutes - and she never came back.  About 15-20 minutes later we had to flag down another waiter to place my order.  It took over 30minutes for each of our orders to be prepared - mine was merely one california roll and beef skewers.  \n\nNeedless to say, the service is atrocious!  It seriously took 30minutes to prepare 6 pieces of meat and 7 rolls!  As if that in itself wasn't ridiculous enough, the bill came and charged us $6 for each pot of green tea.  The entire pot barely equaled 2 TINY cups... Generally, green tea is free at Japanese restaurants - not here!  Instead they overcharge you so that they can buy cool pots.  At $6 a pot, they should give me the pot.\n\nThe food was decent, but when you're basically ignored by your waitress, it's kind of hard to leave the place with a pleasant aftertaste (no pun intended).  Not to mention the outrageous cost of hot water and a bag of green tea.  Would I come here again?  Definitely not.  There are much better happy hour spots in the city.", "author": "Lara T."}

On top of that, they were outrageously priced. What you'd normally pay $12-14 (TOPS!) for a fancy roll, you pay $18 at Ozumo. We only got 2 rolls, and they weren't very big. And charging $6 for edemame? Ludicrous. (Though, in their defense, it was the best I've had before! Still should be free...)\n\nWhat saved the night was the spare ribs entree. The meat practically melts in your mouth. What meat can you cut with a gentle push of a chopstick? It was tender and very tasty.\n\nI think you're paying for the ambiance at Ozumo, which is great, but probably not worth the price.\n\nFor the price, you can get maybe twice the amount of sushi with even better quality elsewhere. I suggest Zushi Puzzle in the Marina if you want very fresh fish, extensive menu, and good value.", "author": "Erica M."}

First indication is the sake list which had a bottle listed at $1100 for the first choice.  Uhmmmm..ok.  Who the hell knows about sake other than you want it one of those mini jugs and want it hot right now?!  We resorted to a sake flight which was good but was a total jip in my opinion $16 for 3 shot glasses worth.  Onto the food..really good I'll have to say.  Presentation was nice, ingredients tasted fresh, and service was attentive...I had the yellowtail collar which would have scared more people when you saw it's presentation, but it looked even scarier when I was done with it.  I actually visualized taking the kitchen hostage until I could get more, but remained reserved nonetheless.  The hamachi appetizer and tuna tartare were amazing as well and gone in a second.  Lastly, I'm a pannacotta freakazoid and have to say that was one of the best!  Tasted like a citrus bomb...shaved meyer lemon skin and grapefruit added a nice touch.  We also shared a chocolate flourless cake with green tea ice cream which was equally amazing.

Very modern and contemporary with sake bottles lined as wall dividers. Dark, sleek and great.  The only issue I had were the tacky red netting surrounded by the rope lights that were hung out the windows overlooking the beautiful embarcadero.  Very dorm room-esque.\n\nService was attentive and pretty efficient. He couldn't really recommend any good sake which I thought was off since Ozumo prides itself as a Sake bar... that was pretty annoying.  However, once the drinks did start flowing, we just ordered flight after flight and trying all of the specialties.\n\nOur party ate like kings and queens. We had an 11 course meal.  \n\nSeaweed Salad was very seaweedy. I wasnt sure if I was biting into salt or sand at one point. I bit too bland for me.\n\nEel Salad was delicious. eel was deliciously prepared and delicate on top of micro greens. Recommended.\n\nTuna Tartare was very average borderline tasteless. Presentation was outstanding.\n\nSushi rolls were average. The flavors were all semi bland however the presentation again were excellent.  Extremely fresh which was nice.\n\nThe tempura was pro bally one of the highlights of the evening. Perfectly fried to crispness and that batter was not heavy or thick. It was a hit.\n\nThe fish braised with green tea rice was a bit lacking flavor.  very bland.\n\nThe Kobe style beef was not as tender as I imagined it to be, however again presentation was excellent.\n\nFillet Mignon was delicious as well, but by that time everyone was just so stuffed!!\n\nOverall, this place is pretty expensive. Our bill for 11 people came out to be $1700 so it's not cheap to say the least.

If you can get through the hostess desk unscathed, \"GOOD LUCK TO YOU.\" \n\nI made reservations 4 weeks ago for my Birthday this last Saturday 10/19/2013. My husband and I showed up 20 minutes early for an 8:15 reservation. At check-in my husband mentioned that if a table came up sooner we'd be happy to take it. The hostess looked at us like \"You've got to be kidding\" but said if that were the case she'd let us know. We were enjoying ourselves at the bar and realized some time had past and looked at our watch, it was 20 minutes past our reservation and no one had approached us for an update. My husband approached the hostess desk and inquired about our expired reservation and all the hostess said was \"Well, we're busy tonight.\"  There was no apology or \"I'm sorry, next table up is definitely yours.\" So, when my husband returned, I said \"Forget it , let's just go to the SUSHI bar.\"  We sat down at the sushi bar upstairs, my husband  went to the bathroom and some woman in white ( I think the Manager?) said \"Excuse me these seats are RESERVED.\" Behind her stood, the hostess who'd snubbed us earlier.  So essentially, we left this place that I had chosen to celebrate my birthday at with a reservation made 4 weeks prior with no back up. We went around the corner and were offered a 9:30 seat at CHAYA where we received superb service and excellent food MINUS THE ATTITUDE.\n\nI work in customer service.

Right?\n\nThe decor was nice, we had a party of 8 and they sat us in this private room all enclosed by lucite shelves decorated with empty sake bottles.  Cool atmosphere, especially the bathrooms that gave mini Japanese lessons while you were using the receptacle.  You can't really beat learning and peeing simultaneously.\n\nWe tried two types of sake, a nigori that was called something like Winter Snow or Winter Night, either way, it was unfiltered and great.  Then we had the Dewazakura Oka or how ever you spell it, that I first became entranced by at Yoshi's, which was equally delectable and fresh tasting.\n\nWe ordered two types of edamame to help ease our tummies while patiently waiting for platters of recently deceased fish.  I don't like shit on my edamame, I like it cold, plain, slick, and green - just like I like my men.  There edamame was fresh and I feel like you can tell a lot about the quality of Japanese food just by edamame, so I interpreted this positively.\n\nMy coworkers ordered the edamame bathed in sauce and heated and garlicked, which I didn't try because I didn't want to subsequently kill someone with my breath, but they all loved it and ate it up quickly.\n\nThe service overall was friendly, helpful and speedy.  Our group of 8 was in and our of there in an hour and 15 - not what I expected from the look and feel of the place.

I had eight types of sake utilizing the sake flight options.  The lounge area is intimate and architecturally soothing.\n\nNext, the hot plates...we started with the hanabi, slices of hamachi and avocado with a ginger/jalapeno ponzu sauce, which turned out to be one of my favorite dishes.  The hamachi melted in my mouth and the sauce accented the flavor of the hamachi rather than mask it.  The futago less impressive, but the tenderloin was juicy and flavorful.  The sakura, beef carpaccio, was much better in the non-seafood category.\n\nThe sashimi was very high quality, fresh fish.  The toro was, frankly, beautiful.  I almost couldn't eat it...almost.  What really got me was the mackerel.  It wasn't saba.  The waiter advised me that it was a younger mackerel.  I forgot what it was called, but if they have it, get it.\n\nIt's almost a shame to get rolls or nigiri there.  Any additions take away from the fish.  One thing I have to commend is that they use snow crab rather than that god-awful imitation crab in anything with crab.\n\nI rarely order cooked fish at a sushi restaurant, but someone else I was with did and I'm grateful for it.  The hotate, sake herb soaked scallops with a raspberry vinaigrette, was plump and bursting with flavor.  The cod tore apart easily and soaked up that miso-sake sauce goodness.\n\nThe desserts, I could have done without.  Not that they were bad, but this place would never be known for their desserts.\n\nThe prices are a bit steep if you are big eater.  Some of the dishes were small even for me and I get full off garnish usually.\n\nOverall, to have this meal over again to the caliber I had it, I'd pass up great sex.", "author": "Michelle P."}

I recently went with three friends coming in from New York on business, and fortunately on their tab (it came to about $450... ok including two bottles of sake and some kobe beef)! For a Japanese restaurant, I think that overall their food is overpriced, and I'd definitely go elsewhere for my every day sushi needs, but some of the outstanding (non sushi) dishes, notably the black cod, I would definitely come back for. \n\nWe were seated quickly, in a section of mostly people on dates, although the place was loud enough to be a little rowdy, and giggly as we caught up with each other. The waitress could not have been nicer, and made some excellent suggestions for our meal.\n\nDrinks: One bottle of sake during dinner, a bottle of unfiltered sake near the end of dinner. (The unfiltered sake has a more pungent taste that can overshadow food. I was actually very thankful for the waitress telling us this in advance.) I wish I had written down the names, because both were superb.\n\nFood: \n\nThe O.k.: \n\n::Kaiso Seaweed Salad. For some reason the flavors of this were off, and the assortment of seaweed I didn't find very appealing.\n\n::Hanabi. Slices of Avocado and Hamachi in Ponzu sauce, sadly this dish just seemed a little bit bland- I wanted a little bit more acid and taste to it.\n\n::Bacon Wrapped scallops on mushrooms... I can't find this on the menu... but it wasn't very memorable anyway.\n\nThe Really Good:\n\n::Oysters. Great. Just great. And I moved from New England where we get the best of them, and certainly have had some good ones.\n\n::Warm edamame with garlic soy sauce. Yummy!\n\n::The Toro (Tuna belly) sushi. A nice piece of fish.\n\n::Kobe beef. Yes, we shelled out out the $105 for ten very thin slivers of wagyu beef. It was good, melt in your mouth, burst of flavor, but I won't do it again. The presentation was pretty, with some carrot kinpira (that I make better at home).\n\nThe Stand Outs:\n\n::Gindara- Black cod marniated in Miso, was so incredibly delicious. The cod melted like butterfish, and was evocative of some of my favorite long marinated items on the menu at Nobu and Blue Ginger. I would most definitely order this again.\n\n::Pan seared scallops on mushroom risotto- perfectly cooked scallops, and such a lovely risotto. I was worried that it might be too salty based on reviews, but we seemed to arrive on a perfect night. \n\n::the amberjack sushi (special) Just beautiful pieces of fish.\n\nIt was a lot of food, we didn't have dessert, and we were all pleasantly full. While I'd hesitate going back because of the price, that black cod ($28) might call me back sometime soon. But for sushi, I think I'll try to find a new place that is a little more affordable.

This place is only two blocks from where I live so I have been many times. But I just never love the place. \n\nOn the PLUS side:\n- The sushi is very good; sometimes amazingly good. And the selection is always good.\n- Good appetizer and dinner items. Mostly delicious.\n- It has a fun, trendy atmosphere and often has a fun vibe. Nice views depending on where you sit. \n- Good wine and sake list.\n- I go to sushi by myself fairly often and this is a good place to chat with other patrons. People are really friendly at the sushi bar.\n\nOn the NEGATIVE side:\n- The prices are really insanely high. I am NOT a price sensitive consumer at all; especially with sushi. But my bill here has been more than I have paid for the finest, most exclusive sushi in Tokyo (including the bad exchange rate). And it can be twice as much as I pay for the best Omakasi in SF. The sake and wine is especially pricey. \n- Many (most) of the sushi chefs are not Japanese. Although they do a fine job preparing the sushi, it isn't the same thing as getting sushi from someone that apprenticed for years in Japan.\n- The sushi staff is pretty stand-offish. I like to have a conversation with the sushi chef. That has never happened for me here.\n- The rest of the staff can be just a bit full of themselves. They sometimes give the sense that their restaurant is \"all it\" and that you are lucky to be there. And overall, the place can be a bit more of a scene than I am looking for when I just want good food.\n- I don't like how the seats at the sushi bar are so low. I am 6 ft tall but the sushi bar feels too high. It makes sitting at the bar a bit uncomfortable.\n- The soy sauce is low sodium. You have to ask for regular soy sauce. Since low sodium soy sauce is really just watered down soy sauce, it doesn't work with sushi.\n\nOverall, this is a very good place but a very bad value.

It has a lot of faults though with all this.\n\nFood: My god, the food sucked. First off, the portions they give u are incredibly small ( not enough for 1 person) on most dishes, and cost WAAAAAAY too much for such a petite amount. Second, the food takes way too long to prepare. Lastly, for the cost of the dishes, u expect heavenly tastes. NOT HERE, the food takes like plastic sometimes and isn't worth the cost.\n\nService: the service isn't great for such a high quality restaurant. The waiters rarely come by to check on their tables, and u have to actually wait to get refills on drinks.  Also, everytime i've went, the waiters have either messed up an order or forgot to put it in, which shows how inexperienced they are or how bad the pay is if experienced waiters keep leaving Ozumo....\n\nIn the end, i do not recommend Ozumo. Food is overpriced and service sucks. If you do go, stick with sushi, you can't go wrong w/ their sushi at least. But as critics of SF have said about going to Ozumo, \"Your money will be O-Zum-ing out of your wallet\"", "author": "Dylan T."}

The big boss is well known here apparently.\n\nWe arrived around 7:45pm and I realized it reminded me of a place...  oh yeah, Blowfish.  Lots of city people around the bar drinking, trying to look cool and chic.  And the music was pretty loud.\n\nWe were shown to the private room in the back.  The boss ordered sushi, main dishes, drinks, dessert.  I don't eat raw fish so I had some of the other shared dishes: ebi tempura roll, edmame with salt and garlic oil, the black cod marinated in miso, and the seared sea scallops.  Everything was good but very salty.  Everyone was drinking, heavily, including 900 year old sake.\n\nBill came and I took a peek - including tips, the total was $2500.  WOW.  OUCH.  Glad that I didn't have to pay.  We didn't have that much food because I wasn't even close to being full; it was probably the alcohol that dented the bill.\n\nThe place was ultra modern and had a cool atmosphere.  However, the quality and quantity of the food doesn't match the price you pay.

Not the same atmosphere like Ozumo, more of a true traditional Japanese restaurant.  Especially Ryoko's...it's something like you would find in a Japanese movie.\n\nOzumo seems like it is catering to more of the \"whitey\" (I am by far not a racist) crowd.  My person opinion(and it is just that my \"personal\" opinion) is that any restaurant that caters to a specific crowd is only cheating their patrons because they steer away from the authenticity of the food they are serving.", "author": "Thomas P."}

This is a beautiful place located right near the water with a spectacular view of the Bay Bridge. My husband and I ate here on the 4th of July. I couldn't have asked for a better experience! \n\nFirst off, food. Mouth watering delicious menu. (We didn't get to taste everything, however if I had room in my stomach I would've!) The beef tartare was unique with a compliment of a wasabi spice and the grilled octopus with hint of pesto sauce was delicious. Perfect flavors combined with a delicious one of a kind sake. For those of you who are big on sake, this is the place to go! Their array of sake, beer and wine list seems like it goes on forever. However, staff is very knowledgeable on pairings for certain meals and made the meal even better. (Thanks Mr. Greg Nasser for the recommendations!!) For our entree, the black cod fish melted in my mouth. Beautifully displayed and delicious with a side of Brussels sprouts and mushrooms! Each bite was savory! This is a MUST try! Last but not least dessert (my sweet tooth certainly had room for this!). We shared a chocolate souffl\u00e9 with green tea ice cream. This sweet treat was the perfect ending to our perfect meal! It had just the right amount of sweet bite to it and an amazing green tea ice cream to combine the flavors. I'll definitely be going back for more! \n\nSecond, the staff (everyone!) was so welcoming, helpful, and kind. I've never experienced anything like this. From the host, waitress, chefs, and manager. Everyone made the experience unforgettable! Thank you Jena and Greg for your kindness and hospitality! \n\nIf you're big on sushi, sake, delicious food and a good time, definitely don't miss out on this hidden gem!!! We'll be back for sure!!!", "author": "Emma N."}

We ended up arriving late for our reservation so we ended up hanging out at the bar for a bit (maybe like 15 minutes at most). So we took a couple of birthday shots before dinner. \n\nThe ambiance was beautiful. Dimly lit. Very Japanese feeling. The bar had wooden benches instead of the typical bar stool. Very modern, yet natural feeling with plants at the same time. The bartender was amazing! My best friend and I got to talking with her about what her favorite shot was to take. She told us she was from Europe, and to try her fave. She poured us both 2 shots and it tasted like WOOD. OMG I almost threw up, but it made for a good laugh - and she did warn us.\n\nMy friends ordered me the \"tokyo glow\" which was a fusion of citrus and sugar and it was delicious. Perfect strength - had a little bite to it, but not too strong. Out of habit I wanted a sashimi plate (i LOVE sashimi), but couldn't find it on the menu. My ex-boyfriend and I asked the waitress if they had such a thing and we were pleasantly surprised to find out that they did. She asked us if we wanted \"quality or quantity?\" - and I opted for quality. I expected to get a few pieces of sushi: some salmon, tuna, halibut, yellow tail BUT when it came out it was 3-4 pieces of that plus roe and sea urchin (which I did NOT try ew). The sashimi was PHENOMENAL. It was the freshest I've ever tasted (no exaggeration) - I mean melt in your mouth fresh. My ex-boyfriend and I shared that plus vegetable tempura which was an art form in and of itself (we were also surprised by the quantity that came out). The presentation of the food here is gorgeous. We ordered sake for the table, but by that time I was pretty sloshed so I can't really tell you whether it was good or not. My friend ordered the \"hanabi\" which was amazing - it had avocado with a ponzu sauce. Again, the presentation was prime.\n\nWhen the bill came out we realized why the sashimi platter was not on the menu - it was $200. Hahaha. I guess that's why it wasn't on the menu! Whatever though, it was SO worth it. This is arguably one of the best sushi places in San Francisco.", "author": "carol a."}

The nice hostess said that we could either wait around 30 minutes or try to snag one of the tables in the lounge, as they are available on a first come, first served basis.\n\nOf course, all the peeps in the crowded lounge area have the same idea, so whenever a spot opens up, it's like a feeding frenzy of people gunning for the same seat.\n\nWell, we were chillin' and didn't mind the wait. We sipped our expensive beers (2 x Kirin drafts + 1 x Chimay draft = $21, LMAO WTF???) and waited about 15 minutes before we were seated in the dining area proper, a very pleasant surprise.\n\nA bonus for me- we got to sit in front of the open kitchen to see the culinary magic of Japanese fusion cuisine brought to you courtesy of pipe hittin' Latino line cooks.\n\nWhen our noob server came, that's when things started to go downhill. He didn't understand or know the menu. He required me to point to the menu items to take our order, and to say the menu items loudly and slowly.\n\nNow I usually don't mind doing this in a Chinese, Korean, Thai, or (fill in the blank) ethnic restauruant where you have to rely on body language and gestures to communicate with FOB service staff. \n\nBut in a restaurant that charges an average mid $20's+ for plates? To add insult to injury, our server wa hakujin no America-jin deshita! Fuck that noise.\n\nSince I read Japanese, I pointed to the robata-grill menu in Japanese by the kitchen, with menu items written on wooden slats as is customary in Japan. Only problem was that this simple, reasonably-priced (read: cheaper) menu was more for display than actually being something you can order. The noob waiter tried to explain away the menu as being the chef's \"experimental\" menu. WTF?\n\nWe gave up at that point. We quickly scarfed down the appetizers we'd ordered and promptly bailed.\n\nWe wound up finishing the evening with a stellar meal with good service at Nopa.\n__________________________\n\nOriginal review:\n\nIt's an okay place to go if you're going on an expense account dinner, as prices tend to be high. But then again, they're not serving you crap like you get in other alleged Japanese restaurants in the City.\n\nGood Japanese food (especially sushi) requires fresh, pristine ingredients and folks, sorry, but Ozumo doesn't cut costs and serve maguro from Costco. If you want cheap Japanese food and value quantity over quality, go somewhere else like Ebisu or Kabuto.\n\nRelative to restaurants in Japan, Ozumo would probably be considered mediocre. Sadly, in San Francisco, Ozumo would be one of the better Japanese restaurants. Note, however, that there are plenty of places in LA and Manhattan that are better than Ozumo.\n\nTasted following from menu:\n\n- Dobin mushi\n\nI enjoyed this simple dashi broth with matsutake, prawn, black truffles.\n\n- Dohyo\n\nTuna tartare basically. Nothing special.\n\n- Hanabi\n\nHamachi and avocado with jalapeno ponzu sauce. Why the fuck do they want to bastardize fresh fish with jalapeno?\n\n- Gindara\n\nDecent preparation of this nice, flaky fish.\n\n- Hitsuji\n\nLamb chops, well prepared and tasty. Not sure if the hijiki and sweet potato salad work well tho'.\n\n- Gyu Kakuni\n\nNice, savory tender beef short ribs. Delicious.\n\n- Assorted sushi\n\nGood stuff. We just had nigiri, and steered clear of the wonky rolls. Cream cheese in sushi? WTFOMG, spare me from culinary abominations like that.\n \nThe coup de grace of Ozumo has to be the drama of conspicuous consumption unfold before your very eyes like a car crash in slo-mo.\n\nLots of guys and gals fidgeting with their iPhones and Blackberries pretending to read important e-mail. Web 2.0 guys trying hard to be shabby chic with designer jeans with strategic rips, expensive limited edition t-shirt with ironic imagery, and even more expensive athletic shoes. Upwardly mobile guys and gals that look like their wardrobe is straight from the designer du jour catalog. Girls who obviously want to see and be seen wearing their sexy, but not too sexy to be skanky outfits (o-skanky-desuka?).  Older folks 40+ who want to feel young and relevant...\n\nOne great example- a \"doctor,\" probably in his late 50's holding court in the main dining area across from the sushi bar with 2 super-hot 20-sumthin' chicks in dresses that didn't leave much to the imagination. These two chicks were clearly \"professionals\"...errr escorts I mean. Hahahaha.\n\nAll the waitstaff were kissing this \"doctor's\" ass making him feel like the whale that he was. Naturally, the gals were fawning over him during dinner, as I noted the shopping bags from high-end boutiques on the floor by their feet. Thank you sugar daddy!\n\nI aspire to be like the the good doctor when I grow up! :)", "author": "Bono B."}

One based on the restaurant/ bar itself and one based on the catering staff. \n\nOK, I will start with the good first. Great bar area. Get here early and take over a section of it. This is what being young professionals is about. Great food. Damn good sushi. Really nice staff. Good location.\n\nNow, the bad. I have been through 3 catering managers here. In 3 years. The second gentleman was great. When I ordered lunches, he would deliver them himself, he was upfront about Ozumo's capabilities and he was personable. The most recent manager upset me so bad that my team knows not to ask me to order from Ozumo again.\n\nI called a week in advance and ordered plates for 2 lunches to be delivered at 11:00am. I was well aware that this was a special request since their kitchen doesn't normally open that early, but asked IN ADVANCE if it would be a problem and was assured it would not. I was assured that they would happily deliver one of the orders themselves in time for a meeting that started at 11am. I informed the manager that I would be there at 10:40 to pick up the other order.\n\nI arrived to pick up the second order at 10:30, knowing I had to leave the restaurant by 10:40. I was assured by the manager himself that the orders would be ready shortly. When I was given the trays to BOTH orders at 11:35am, mad wouldn't even begin to describe how I was feeling. I have not ordered from Ozumos since and this incident occurred in Fall, 2007.\n\nGo to the restaurant for a great experience. Otherwise, forget it.", "author": "Lora C."}

Chocolate mochi as a dessert had too many flavors going on.  The winners: \"hanabi\" (hamachi with jalapeno) intrigued my taste buds and the special dessert of yam and pumpkin ice cream was an outstanding way to finish.  \n\nIt is quite clear your bill ends up going to the decor and rent, not the food.

Ozumo is definitely on the pricey side and their portions are small, but the food was great and I was there for a work dinner so hell, as long as I wasn't paying  it didn't really matter. \nI ordered the Sparkling Geisha to start which was lychee flavored sake and passion fruit puree topped with champagne---- OMG, this drink was so good I could've had 5.....but instead I had 3....hey, I thought that was pretty good self-control. For an appey, we started with the Hanabi ($18) which was slices of Hamachi and avocado in a spicy ponzu sauce- tiny portion, but absolutely delicious. We also started with their Vegetable Tempura ($10) which was pretty standard- I'm not sure how you can really mess up fried vegetables. We ordered a few rolls to share- Spicy Tuna ($9), Shrimp Tempura w/Jalapeno ($9), Yasai-Maki (Veg roll- $8) and the Yokozuna roll ($13). My favorite was the Spicy Tuna- the quality and freshness of the tuna was superb and it was crazy spicy which I loved. The shrimp tempura w/Jalapeno was also great. Our waitress was really nice, but got a little slow at the end. \nBetween 5 girls our bill came out to $310 after tax and tip. \nWould definitely love to go back again (on the company card of course...).", "author": "Shani D."}

Perhaps, that was because we walked in before the lunch rush.  I only had sushi and thought I'd be blown away by the selection of imported fish, but I wasn't impressed.  The prices they charged for the quantity and size of the rolls was ridiculous!  Our waitress was accommodating and continually checked on us, even as the place got crowded.  I did find the restrooms interesting, for they were playing Japanese tutorials in there, LOL.  Not coming back for the food, maybe to try out a few of there 100's of sakes to choose from!", "author": "Jeralyn K."}

The inside of the restaurant is very nice. We had a great view of the Bay Bridge from our table. We had calamari (good) and seaweed salad for appitizers. Unfortunately the salad was bland. My wife had Mahi-mahi for her main course. It was good but a little bland as well. I had mirin marinated and grilled lamb chops. Probably the best lamb I have ever had. Dessert was phenomenal as well and our server paired it perfectly with a sample of four different sake's. The service was excellent. Our waiter was well educated in the menu and had a great, engaging personality. Ozumo was expensive but worth it for a special occasion.", "author": "D S."}

You even have to pay their Edamame beans (which usually comes free at other also-fancy restaurant)!\n\nBut today as we went by Ferry building we decided to give it another try! We sat on the Sushi bar as we did not make reservation. But I like it there more than the regular table as it is more intimate sitting than the regular table when the two people sit across the table!\n\nWe ordered Yaki Tako (grilled octopus) that is tangy, chewy while tender! We also ordered their special with beef tongues! It is as good as it can get! \n\nThe yellowtail nigiri and unagi nigiri are very good but 2 pieces of them came at $8 and $7 are again a bit expensive for us. We also had Akebono rolls that have some chopped toro and black Caviar. It is kind of an invention.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the choco Chan (flourless chocolate cake with Mochi and green tea ice cream). It is pretty good. \n\nThe atmosphere is nice but I have to say that the waiters are too quick to move every plate from your table every time you finish a plate. It feels like they are in a hurry to bring you a new dish. I wish they are not so attentive.", "author": "Jasmine C."}

Yet, I find I can only write a detailed review when there is something to critique.  \n\nWhen a restaurant is really good lushing on and on about the food and service just seems indulgent.  The five (or four) stars should speak for itself.  However, a low review has to be justified.\n\nEither that or I just like to complain more than compliment.\n\nTo start with the positive, the fish is good.  All the sushi is excellent.  Better than most of the sushi joints in town. \n\nWith Ozumo the problem is definitely the service.   I should have known b/c I checked out the Yelp reviews and saw that it was a problem.  However, I had eaten here before at the sushi bar and didn't have any problems.  So I figured I would give it another shot.  \n\nWe order some edemame and sake to start.  The sake is great but the edemame is absent.  Next, the server takes our dinner order and we state we would like the Martini Sashimi appetizer followed by a long list of nigiri and rolls.\n\nThe first item to hit our table is the rolls.  Before the edamame, before the appetizer, before the nigiri.  What's up with that?  The rolls come but no one gives us soy sauce.  By the time we flag someone down for the soy sauce, we now have the edamame and the appetizer.\n\nTen seconds later the nigiri comes out.  We don't even have room for it on the table.  The server at least realized it was impossible to try to get another dish on the table so he decided to take it back and wait.\n\nWhat a mess.  You pay all this money and expect to have a nice leisurely dinner and they are throwing the food at you every which way like they are rushing you out the door.\n\nAnyhow, if I go back, I'll probably stick with the sushi bar.", "author": "jeff k."}

More on that in a minute...\n\nThe decor is real snazzy, the ambience is nice and the crowd is that yuppy, Financial District/Advertising Agency after-work crowd.  There is a nice bar in the front which makes really good drinks (average strength) and then in the back is where the restaurant bit.  And yes, in the bathroom, they have Japanese language lessons playing.  Interesting.  And the wait staff (serving food, not the bartender) was very nice and the service was excellent.\n\nThe food was very good, expensive, but expected for that part of SF.  My favorite was the Garlic-Soy Edamame, edamame that boiled, salted, and then stir-fried (skin on) in a garlic-soy sauce.  Amazing edamame.  The rest of the food was usual, expensive, trendy Japanese fare.  No problems there.\n\nDrinks - I got the green tea martini, which I really enjoyed; and then water and ice tea - nothing to report there.\n\nGripes: \nBartender - I ordered the green tea martini for myself and my friend that was with me; a lady heard me ordering it and asks the bartender how that drink is and the bartender says, \"Oh, it's not at all my favorite.  I don't recommend it.  Order something else.\"  In front of me.  In front of the person who ordered the very drink she was trashing.  I've never been a bartender, but I've been in many a bar situation in my adult life, and I didn't think that was very nice of her to do.  There are other ways she could have said it, perhaps, \"oh, it's not my favorite, but you should try it... \" \"it's a unique drink... not everyone likes it\".. or something a bit more mild.  You think?\n\nSeating - got there right at 5P, we were on a schedule, so we got our drinks and were seated by 5:30P.  We were seated in the back, away from the rest of the restaurant.  Not really sure how they did their seating, but I wasn't happy with sitting in the back, made me feel like they didn't want to show the general public that they were serving food.\n\nAll in all, it was a decent experience, the food is good, but more likely a place I'd take a visiting friend, not somewhere I would go on the regular.", "author": "Meghana A."}

For Uni lovers- gosh, ever wanted to take uni and mix it in a bowl of rice- well they did it for you here, but even better.

Same problem has happened at FukiSushi in Palo Alto.  A measure of a place's quality and pride would be whether they say they are sold out of toro, or if they sell you 2nd rate toro at full price.\n\nOtherwise the place is a very fancy place to take a date to.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-12", "description": "OK - let it be stated here that Ozumo is hands down the best sushi-ya in San Francisco.  And perhaps in the lower-48.  \n\nIt's all about quality at this joint.  When you can get chu-toro at the bar that rivals much of what you'll find at Tsukiji (yeah, the one way, way over there), or even the places that feed Tsukiji for that matter, you've found a place that does sushi right.  When it's located in San Francisco, the land of heavily dyed maguro and phenomenal roles but no actual quality sushi whatsoever, you've found something very special indeed.\n\nNow, I know this joint is a bit pretentious.  And I know it's ridiculously expensive.  But this is truly a place where you will get what you pay for, especially when you compare it to the other offerings out there.  The fish is of just ridiculously high quality.  And, really, that's what the sushi experience should be all about.  Not that they don't do the rest of the classically Japanese menu (or the portions of the menu that  aren't classically Japanese for that matter) well - they do.  But the fish is the best around, by a long shot.  And that, to me, is worth every last dime you spend in this place. \n\nIf you're a role fan, you can get good rolls all over this city (check out Miyabi, Wasabi & Ginger, or Kamekyo for some reasonable bites at reasonable prices).  But if you want good FISH, there's only one place to go.   \n\nSide notes: service is just so-so; bar is too crowded by design, ambiance sucks ass, unless you're wanting something like Sushi Samba Rio - in which case you'll be right at home.  Put this place in a traditional sushi-ya setting and you'd have the best Japanese restaurant outside of Japan.  It's that close...", "author": "Forrest C."}

I view ratings as indicators of value - if the experience is good but nothing special, and the pricing isn't commensurate, I'm not inclined to give very good ratings.  In Ozumo's case, the pricelist reflects their expectations of the clientele - moneyed tech yuppies and lawyers in wingtips.

The ambiance is nice, by the water nice window views onto the Embarcadero.  Despite not being able to eat the raw stuff this round, I found plenty of cooked items to taste.  Started off with the edamame which came out piping hot roasted in some garlic sauce which made them extra tasty.  I had the Bucho roll and Ozumo roll which were both fantastic.  The fish and crab were really fresh the rolls were well made (not falling apart).  I loved the extra touch of yuzu aoili on the Bucho roll as well.  Also got the braised pork ribs; they just fell off the bone... so good.  Also got a chance to try the pork cheeks.. this was not my favorite but very fatty and flavorful for those who like that sort of thing.  Lastly for the entrees I tried the Suzuki and the Sake.  The Suzuki is a steamed sea bass over black rice/risotto.  This was superb.  The freshest and least oily sea bass i have every had!  I really loved this dish.  I think a touch of fresh lemon would have really made it stand out though.  The Sake was the salmon with peas/onions etc.  That was good too.  The salmon was well cooked and still juicy on the inside (not try like most places make it..)  But I have to admit that by that time I was pretty full so didn't get to enjoy the salmon as much as I would have.  Overall I would definetly come back once for a special occasion when I can drink the alcohol and eat the raw fish again!  The tuna tartare looked exquisite.", "author": "Margie C."}

We asked for them once when the appetizers arrived and still didn't get them until the sushi came, quite some time later. I would have enjoyed starting my drink and sake before even the soup came.

It's definitely a well-designed restaurant, very trendy and modern without being over the top.  Service is always good, and the prices are perhaps on the high side, but as this tends to be an expense account place in terms of business/recruiting, it's not normally my money, and people from out of town tend to enjoy it.  Still, it's got to be said that there are few places in SF that I've been to where the quality of the meal oscillates more.  I'll have a meal or do quick sushi takeout where I say to myself, \"I need to make a point of eating here more often--this is great sushi!\" (I'm very enthusiastic when I talk to myself about sushi) and then will return two weeks later and feel like I've been robbed in terms of the price:quality ratio.

Last night I had the shabu shabu and the fondue - both were delicious.   As the waitress anticipated, our neighbors looked on enviously as we dipped our fresh fruit into the chocolate.   The vibe is great too - if you like to see and be seen, there's the darker bar area.  If you like a more zen environment, the main dining area is soothing.  Here are the negatives - the portions aren't that large, and it is expensive (forgot to ask one time when they suggested uni sashimi and that cost a pretty penny).  The bar area can be deafening, largely because of the music.  Service is friendly - the host must have checked in 5 times with us as we were sitting near the host stand - but the food is slow.   Last night, our bucho roll never showed, and the waitress (who was otherwise very friendly) was apologetic but basically said dishes do go missing when they're served by mistake to the wrong table and not rejected, and then suggested that perhaps we might not want to reorder since the sushi was really backed up with several large parties.  Good thing we were no longer hungry.  And another time at the bar I was given someone else's check - which was twice as much as our dinner.  Luckily I looked as my friend did not.

The menu is ridiculously extensive and overwhelming.  I had kept losing track of the items we wanted to order.  Finally we decided on the uni nigiri (sea urchin), sumo roll (hamachi, tuna and shiso over california roll), yokozuna roll (grilled unagi with crab), shacho roll (lobster), sekiwake roll (spicy tuna), dobin mushi teapot, dohyo (tartare of big tuna), futago (grilled Washu beef), unagi (eel) salad, gindara (black cod), shiromi (salt grilled Pacific sea bass), hotate (pan seared sea scallops), and tofu cheesecake for dessert.  The problem with such a large menu is that it can create problems in the kitchen with execution.  Sure enough, the following dishes left a lot to be desired:  sumo roll (boring), sekiwake roll (spicy tuna that wasn't spicy), dobin mushi teapot (glorified miso soup), futago (blandly sweet), unagi salad (no flavor), and tofu cheesecake (as nasty as it sounds).  The saving graces were the dohyo (tasty spin on tuna tartare but they need to include more of those awesome gyoza chips), gindara (black cod marinated in miso and sake makes miso happy!) and hotate (best dish of the night).\n\nService:  3 stars.  Service here is decent.  I noticed that a restaurant manager was watching our server like a hawk (she must have been a newbie).  I felt scared for her because the manager looked pretty strict.  She made one mistake (she gave the dobin mushi teapot to my friend even though I ordered it) and he jumped all over her for that.  Poor little grasshoppa.\n\nAtmosphere:  5 stars.

I found the tako (octopus), uni (urchin), and shrio maguro (albacore) to be especially excellent here. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar and ordering omakase (chef's choice) style (my friend and I ordered $60/person omakase and got an excellent selection of sashimi and sushi, including toro, tako, uni, and abalone among others). The sake is priced slightly higher than I'd like, but what the hell.. splurge a little. Service was friendly and attentive.", "author": "Sunny Y."}

Ozumo thinks it's way more than it is, but it does have fine sushi.  The fish is not as good as Sushi Groove, but I don't think people come here for the fish. People come here b/c it's like a less dumb Blowfish experience.  The bar is cool from a design standpoint, but is usually packed, and quite a scene - usually with people not from SF, but surrounding environs.  The dining room is big, loud, and gets hot on a busy night. Like I mentioned, fish is ok and menu is large and varied.  Overall, I think Ozumo tried to recreate Katana in West Hollywood, and failed.  It's a hip, sceney sushi place that's more hip and scene than sushi - and I use hip loosely.", "author": "Emily M."}

Waited and waited for the head half, eventually asked the waiter, and was told \"We don't serve the heads since Americans (wtf?) don't eat them usually.\" I have NEVER had this happen at any sushi restaurant anywhere. To their credit, I jokingly said go ahead and serve me those extras, then, and they did bring out 4 heads instead of 2. \n\nOverall, the waitstaff was super friendly, smiley, nice. Pacing was very strange. As I mentioned, I got seviche and amaebi and my friend had maguro. The maguro wasn't served until I was almost completely done! Perhaps they assumed we were sharing, but I thought it was pretty clear when we ordered that we were not.\n\nTable was tiny and in the middle dining area. Quieter than the bar, thank goodness, but too brightly lit and felt like we were dining in a hallway.\n\nSo, overall, good, but not amazing, and with some strange screw-ups.

The only setback? The ridiculous prices!!! I would of given this place 5 stars but when you spend over 100$ bucks a head with only one drink, no dessert and your still hungry that's when you realize that there are far better places to eat sashimi in SF that aren't overly priced.\nOur waiter Brandon suggested to my friend and I a nice glass of sake to start the meal off. My friend and I ordered the tuna tataki salad which consists of grilled albacore sashimi over a plate of mixed greens with a very tasty vinaigrette. The salad was perfect, not too much dressing and a very light consistency.\nFor the main course we decided to order a few of the sashimi dishes that were market price for that evening. We ordered the Konakapachi and the Spanish Mackerel, both 25$ per five small slices of fish. I can't complain, the taste and the freshness was unbelievable!! We added to our list of shashimi the sea urchin and the unagi. I wasn't very fond of the consistency of the urchin. Very slimy taste in your mouth, kinda pasty. We also ordered two of the small plates; the squid and the yellowtail. Both to die for!! \nWhat topped our night off was meeting eight nice gent's who invited us to their table to eat more food and drink all the sake, wine and champagne we could ask for. We couldn't pass this invite up as my friend and I were still hungry.\nI am not sure how often I will be able to dine here but if my wallet could hang  I would be here at least every week.

The food by itself I would give a slightly higher rating but based on my overall experience, Ozumo got only 2 stars.\n\nMy biggest complaint is related to my expectations of what we ordered and the value of what we got. We decided to go with the chef's special, omakase.  For $125 per person we were expecting a pretty good meal.  Sadly it fell far short of our expectations.  When you get a \"chef's special\" tasting menu from any restaurant you expect the best of what the restaurant and the chef can offer, right?   Well some of the dishes we got seemed pretty pedestrian.  Our sashimi and sushi dish had fish like red snapper and maguro, not exactly what I expected for a chef's special.  Come on, we didn't even get toro!  I asked the waiter about why maguro would be on a chef's special menu and he said that he wondered that himself.   One dish was tempura baby icefish which wasn't bad tasting but was lukewarm and extremely oily.  Some of the dishes we got were good like the parchment steamed salmon in sake and the banana crepes with green tea cream.  Overall just a terrible chef's tasting menu.\n\nI see other reviews and think there must be something more to the restaurant than our experience.

Yes its high priced, but you get what you pay for with the food, and it makes it worth it.  I like that it is located near the bay, and the design is pleasant.  The use of wood and granite fused with Japanese/Californian vernacular architectural elements is impressive.  I'll venture to say it is my favorite Sushi restaurant in the city and one of the best in the world.

For a very expensive dinner, our sushi and other plates were served within 7 minutes of sitting down. The hot Saki, which we didn't even receive until after the entire meal, had to be sent back twice because it was lukewarm. We also ordered cold saki, and other cocktails which were all served after the meal.  It was a constant battle to get our very rude waiter's attention. We sent our tempura back with the check -- they both came out at the same time. All in all, our entire dining experience (was a birthday dinner as well), lasted exactly 29 minutes. Asking our waiter to \"slow down\" several times did not register. I have eaten at some of the best sushi restaurants in metropolitan cities around the world, and I have to say that this was the absolute worst.

Then the waiter gave us such a hard time when we pointed it out to him. Then he tells us that dessert was free since he messed up the bill. So we all order dessert and then he says that the birthday person's dessert cake was free and not everyone else's. Isn't that free for most birthdays?  We were all so irritated and I was so embarrassed, because I was the one who threw the event for my boyfriend's birthday and his friends that I barely was getting to know. I wanted to show his friends a nice place to have a birthday with a nice setting. I felt so bad, because a lot of them were irritated about the random add-on's to the bill, so I just ended up covering the rest of the bill.  I've gone to this place with a smaller amount of people prior to this event and it was nicer, but when it was a larger group, I guess the waiters aren't trained enough to handle the huge amount of people. This place definitely disappointed me that day. Be careful of saying yes to things too, because they don't tell you that it's \"extra\".

It wasn't even busy. Ozumo is a lot bigger than it looks from the front, you just keep walking back and it's a big room. It looks nice, and our party was seated by a window that overlooked the water and bridge and embarcadero. Our waiter was attentive, but in an annoying way. I don't know how to describe it, but very fake, which sounds silly because waiters don't generally know you so they are all, to some extent fake, but that's all I can say to describe it. Everyone who brought over the food was very meticulous, even making sure the bento boxes were facing the right direction. So overall the service was good. Prices were expensive. I'd eaten sushi the night before, so I got the lunch ramen. It was $15ish and not bad. There was pork, egg and crab, and the pork was very fatty. I couldn't eat half of it because it was just white/clear fat. Ew. It came with edamame and a small salad, which was tasty. Actually the whole table ordered edamame for appetizers, and it was warm and salty and tasty. My soup was ok but not anything special. Two people had bento boxes, which were very pretty, and they liked them. They ran $18-maybe $22. The other 3 people had sushi. The sushi was pretty, and they seemed to enjoy it ok, but not a lot, and it was small servings. The green tea served with the meal was very good, and in cute tea pots. Overall, lunch for 7 people came out to over $200, which is more than I'd like to spend on lunch.  And if I do spend that much on lunch, I want it to be spectacular. This wasn't spectacular, it was average. By all means, check it out, since a lot of people gush over this place, but I don't see the need to try it again.", "author": "Merredith L."}

Delicious food and excellent service. The third visit, yesterday, was the opposite. I treated a close friend to lunch after describing Ozumo as my \"new favorite restaurant.\" I gave that endorsement as someone who lived in Japan for three years. After we were seated, I felt as if I was in the wrong restaurant. The food was poorly prepared and the service was sloppy. Here are a few highlights: The beef in the gyu bento was tough and overcooked. The waitress forgot/lost our appetizer, so we had to ask a second time. I always order a glass of umeshu, which is Japanese for plum wine, but this time none of the waitresses knew what that word meant. I did get my plum wine, but it shouldn't have been so difficult.

The traffic was so bad, I almost turned the car around in Berkeley and started back home.  \n    Once we finally got there, they were cool about us being late for our reservation. We sat at the sushi bar and the first thing I noticed about this place was their outstanding service. Our waitress was very, very nice and explained the specials in great detail. I like when sushi bars have that few special fresh items that I can try. Ozumo did not disappoint . Several different , unique items.   One great thing here, they have Stella Artois on tap. Love it!!.  The sake selection looked great, but expensive.  Full bar also available. We ordered some Miso and some edamame.   Time to start ordering sushi.   First thing I always order at a sushi place is the tako sashimi.  You can really tell the quality of sushi by this dish. Tako should be cooked so still rare in the middle.   It was cooked perfectly here.   Next came some aji nigiri and some suzuki nigiri.  No one here can argue that the fish is not fresh.  probably some of the best quality of fish I have found any where.   We finished our meal with several other nigiris and the girls had some rolls.   The outstanding service kept going throughout the meal.   I do have a few problems with ozumo.  It's just way to pricey.  They tack on a couple extra bucks to each nigiri, but that really adds up in the end.  This was my largest sushi bill ever, and I've run up a pretty good tab at other places with much more return for my buck.   But it was very good.

The quality of the fish is great, but the flavors are lacking.  Steak tartare was so bland and the meat seemed minced rather than cubed into small pieces.

Josh made recommendations from the menu that he thought we might like and then went out of his way to ensure that we had the perfect sakes to pair with our assorted dinner items. We  started with garlic aioli edamame and the Horenso no goma-ae (blanched organic spinach salad), moved on to the Kabocha soup (with pine nuts) and Dobin Mushi Tea Pot soup (Matsutake Mushrooms, Black Truffles, and Black Tiger Prawns in  a clear Dashi broth), had the Bucho, Spicy Scallop and California rolls, then had the Futago (grilled Washu Beef with Eggplant) and the Doyo (Tuna Tartare with Tofu) before finishing with the dark Chocolate fondue for dessert.

Also excellent and hilarious in only the way awkward failed-pick up attempts can be, was the moment where this douche-bag from Michigan (in what else but a striped shirt, of course) came over to hit on my bff with a line straight out of The Pick Up Artist tv show.

Last week I made it out to a place here in Sacramento for lunch and had a very good experience so it was a good comparison to make to Ozumo.  Unfortunately, this trip to Ozumo opened my eyes to a lot of the other complaints people had.\n\nAgain we had a Saturday night reservation and were seated promptly and on time.  The bar was less crowded and the atmosphere more relaxed however our waiter was horrible.  My wife is a vegetarian and he was making recommendations all night about fish dishes trying to convince her to try them because they're so good.  He also tried to convince our friend who doesn't like aioli to get the aioli on the roll because it adds a \"decadance and richness.\"  Um, no, she doesn't like aioli dummy.  In addition he messed up two nigiri orders however the thing our friends found odd was that he took the plates away.  Are they throwing away the plated sushi or re-serving it to someone else?\n\nWe ordered some rolls and my wife substituted some veggies for fish in the Shacho and (I don't remember) however she picked the two rolls that come with less than 6-8 pieces (4 and 5 respectively).  The menu doesn't state that these rolls have less than the \"standard\" number of pieces.  Again, the waiter tried to play cool and state \"well, they're larger rolls so they have fewer pieces.\"  Unfortunately for him they were the two smallest diameter rolls we ordered all night.\n\nAs for the nigiri the pieces of fish served are small however the rice is good, which I hadn't noticed until someone was discussing it last week.  That by no means makes up for the price to fish portion ratio.  Also the Saba was really odd - it was pickled or something nasty.  I usually enjoy Saba because it has a bit of a \"fish\" taste to it however this tasted almost like the jar of herring people eat for New Years or something.\n\nI need to go rate the place I went to here in Sac (once I remember the name) because compared to Ozumo it was hands down better.  I'm going to give Ozumo a low rating because the waiter was thoroughly annoying, the price/portion was poor and the saba was just not right.  I won't be going back again.", "author": "Dave S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-06-02", "description": "Food and Appearance: Four Stars!\nService and Ambiance: One star...see why below\n\nI was looking for a nice place to take my fiancee for our six year anniversary. I booked a reservation at Chenery Park, but we were staying at the Intercontinental and Ozumo was highly recommended by the Hotel staff. So, I went to Ozumo. I wish I would have went to Chenery Park. The initial ambiance of Ozumo creates a very \"traditional Japanese\" feel with a sense of refinement and sophistication. There are big sake bottles stacked up over the bar and the lounge benches on the sides looked quite comfortable wth big pillows and very nice wood tables. So the background was awesome; five stars there. When I called Ozumo, they said the first seats available were at 9:45pm, however it is first come first served, so I was encouraged to hurry so that I could have a table. When I arrived I was greated by a very polite host and waitress. To my great dismay, they told me that there were no more tables but I could sit in that well-appointed and comfortable looking lounge area. I thought, \"not bad\" this looks better than a boring table.  \n\nFOOD:  The food was actually quite good. The Burikama (yellow-tail collar) was outstanding. I've heard this is considered the \"fillet-mignon of fish.\" The maguro tataki salad was also a delicious combination of tuna and salad with a ponzu dressing that danced around my tongue. The sushi wasn't the greatest, but nevertheless it was tasty. \n\nSERVICE: \nThe waitress was very attentive to most of my needs. She would frequently check with me to make sure everything was well and did a very fine job. My first complaint is that we were seated close to the door, so it was very drafty. The doorman didn't do much to help by holding the door open for an eternity when he thought he saw people headed towards the restaurant. Now to the not-so-fun part. This is why the review is only a one-star: \n\nNow, you would think, that an upscale place like this would control the customers and not let them get too rowdy. WRONG!!!! About ten minutes into the meal, the party of four next to me started causing a huge ruckus. They obviously had about ten drinks too many and were throwing the F-bomb around like it was going out of style. They were posing for pictures, calling each other names, shouting to each other as if there was loud background noise, and making it very unpleasant for me and my dining partner. The party next to me was about a drunk mess. They were about a stone's throw away from expelling their dinner on the table and passing out on the floor.  To the waitress:  I had a simple request: Can you please find me a seat anywhere away form these clowns? She told me the only seats available would be more noisy? Really? So you're telling me that your restaurant is full of noisy jerks? I'm paying for a $100 dinner, but I'm supposed to put up with this foolishness? Sorry, but if that is the way your restaurant is run, then I'm never coming back and I'm telling everyone that I know to avoid your restaurant! \n\nThere are much better places to go where one can dine without having to be cold through most of the dinner and try to hold a conversation over the drunken yelling of belligerent fools.", "author": "Nick C."}

I like sushi, and they do some creative & interesting things (one of the very nice, friendly sushi chefs gave us some type of fish-peanut butter-strawberry piece that was actually fantastic). The appetizers are delicious as well. However, the service is terrible. My girlfriend and I had reservations for an early dinner (5:30) before a show and arrived promptly. The hostess looked us both up & down (we were dressed fairly well, but not in formal wear) and told the waitress to seat us at \"station 8\", or something like that. In an empty restaurant with big windows, sweeping views of the bay and about 4 other couples dining, they sat us in the back, near the bathrooms and a service station. After sitting, I asked the waiter if we could move tables, and he said \"I doubt it. We have lots of reservations tonight. Would you like me to get the manager?\". It was 5:30, the place was empty and  _we_ had reservations. I asked to see the manager, and when he came out, he asked what the problem was and said he'll \"see what he can do.\" 5 minutes later they moved us to a marginally better table on the back wall, right next to one of the other 4 couples dining. As we ate, I noticed they consistently seated the older, affluent-looking couples in the prime spots, and stuffed all the younger couples in the same row of tables, all spaced very closely to each other.\n\nSo, my review is obviously biased by my distaste for the pretentious staff, but there are far better sushi places in SF that treat you well and don't charge as much. That said, if you're in a suit and have money to burn, the sushi is pretty good.", "author": "Todd S."}

The place was definitely happening, even though it was just another middle of the week night... The crowd was mostly young and trendy and definitely enjoying their food and drinks while a DJ was spinning some good chill-out music in the background. \nOur bartender was Evans, whose cool attitude and passionate way of talking about the menu and about the sake he was pouring immediately won us over.  When the hostess came to seat us, we did not hesitate to tell her that we won't need the table any more...  \nEvans' knowledge about various sakes and their pairings with food was absolutely amazing! We did not only have dinner but a total eye-opening experience as we worked our way through the courses masterfully introduced and explained to us. \nSushi rolls? Forget sushi rolls!... You can have that anywhere ...The menu was incredibly extensive and fresh and Evans suggested  dishes that were pleasant surprises, from the delicious Hanabi (ginger does wonders!), to the Tiger Prawns and many others, whose name I am going to have to go back and try to remember next time...Because there will definitely be a next time !\nBy the time the delicious Pineapple Maki dessert came, we had travelled all over the Japanese cuisine map and had tasted sakes from various regions. With Evans as our guide, the great music in the background and surrounded by other people who were obviously enjoying the food as much as we did, I can definitely say that Ozumo was one of the best Japanese culinary experiences we have had in San Francisco. \nI do recommend geting the sake pairing with food- the staff there will be able to suggest the right match for the food you choose. If, like us, you want to be pleasantly surprised, you can either ask for Evans or, I am sure, any of the servers or bartenders- they will guide you and suggest dishes that will suit your taste and mood.", "author": "Le Big Mac A."}

I was here with a few clients, and it's a great place to hold a power lunch.  I don't know if I would necessarily come back for dinner, but then again, I haven't been here for dinner yet.\n\nFrom the moment I walked inside I felt taken care of.  The girls at the front desk had my reservation in the system, and they happily took the flowers I had brought for my clients and held them behind the counter.  I only mention this because it made me feel like less of a wuss after carrying the flowers for the past six blocks.\n\nI think I had exclusively raw cuts of everything, from the appetizers to the cut rolls, and everything was fresh and lacking the \"fish smell\" you sometimes find with a bad sushi restaurant.  The sake was great, and the restaurant had a very interesting architectural vibe to the interior, which I am sure would have both amused and enthralled me had I been downing more of that lovely fermented rice.\n\nAll in all, I give the place 3.5 stars, but I'll round them up to 4 stars for both their reputation and their willingness to hold my flowers up front.  Food was nothing extraordinary, but I bet this would be a neat place to get hammered.", "author": "Jason B."}

This restaurant is spacious and nice.  There is a view of the water, which can be romantic I suppose.  The first time I went here, I ordered hamachi sashimi, which was very delicious!  It was a really good grade of fish, and it melted in my mouth.  The seaweed salad is good too.  The second time I ate here, I ordered the blackened cod, which is to die for!

The atmosphere is very sleek and modern. We arrived at 6pm with reservations for 3 and was seated right away. Our waiter had greeted us and gave a small introduction. The service here is very good. The waiter we had was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us suggestions, explained how some of the special request dinners worked. Our waiter was very patient with us as we took almost 30 minutes to order due to a little confusion about how some of the special ordering was. But we finally ordered, My husband and i had the sushi/sashimi special where we tell the chef what we like and dont like and he makes a plate for us and my sister in-law had some plate with risotto and i think sea bass (not sure).  \nWe received our food and everything was delicious. My sister in-laws dish was really nicely done, risotto was made very well and the fish was cooked just right. Mine and my husbands dish was really good too, the fish was really fresh. Over all the dinner was good. After we had ordered dessert. We had saw another table order the fondue plate, so we decided to order it too. It came with a variety of fruit, sponge cake, ice cream mochi and a pot of Belgian bitter sweet chocolate. It was a very good choice to end a meal.\nOver all the experience was great. Would i come here again? Yes if it is for a special occasions as this place is a little pricey.

His name is Vunz. If you guys want to try this place, please ask for Vunz area when you make the reservation. He knows details of making of the food, and even ingredients of the food.\n\nWe tried the \"Kobe beef on the menu. It isn't Kobe, as Vunz explained to us, it is actually Misiyaki beef which is better than Kobe. Ozumo named the dish Kobe because Kobe is a more recognizable name than Misiyake. Misiyaki has only been famous in the last few years. It is market price, therefore ask your waiter for the price. Our price was $105 for 5oz. My wife discussed it for a few seconds, and decided to go for it as it is something we got to try once in our lifetime. Vunz brought out the Misiyaki....man, the presentation is good, and our first thought was \"that isn't going to make a dent on our taste buds!!\". Vunz described in detail of how to take it correctly and let it melt in your mouth....YES, melt!! We follow his instructions.....WOW!!! I was wrong. It hit our taste buds big time. Wow....excellent. The little piece of beef literally melt in your mouth. We only had 5 pieces each, but that was worth every single penny. Well spend $105. \n\nWe wanted mixed and match sashimi which they didn't have, but Vunz said he will sort it out for us. We had tuna, baby octupus, yellowtail, salmon roe, salmon belly, and another fish which I forgot. Man....the best sashimi I have had in 3 years. The sashimi just melts in your mouth!!! It was just a pleasure to have in our mouths that we wanted more, but we decided to leave some for next time. \n\nWe had another \"small plate\" (zensai) which had bacon wrapping around the seabass. My god!!! The taste was so sweet and delicious!! One of the best dish I have had in a long time. This was $23 for 4 mouth pieces.\n\nThe decor and atmosphere were excellent. The people who came in to dine were sophisticated and beautiful to look at as they are all dressed up in expensive brands.\n\nOur total came to $200+$7.65 (SF health tax)+ state tax= $235 (around that number).\n\nDefinite will go back there again for good food.\n\nKeep in mind of one point when you have decided to try it out. Don't compare the pricing to the quantity on the plate. The idea is to enjoy the taste of good food!!", "author": "shoutjack s."}

Warm dark chocolate in a stoneware pot with a platter of fresh fruits and mochi make this the perfect, perfect, perfect dessert to end the meal.  My favorite is when I dip the mochi ice cream in the chocolate, and the duo twist of warm dark chocolate and cold ice cream with the chewiness of the mochi skin created a blast of flavors, textures and feelings in my mouth.  It was quite amazing.\n\nThe lobster roll - four pieces for $22 -- was not worth it at all; the seabass sauce was not that great, and the ahi tartar was just ahi tartar, but the above two dishes of wawu beef and chocolate fondue earned Ozumo its five stars from me.", "author": "Alex E."}

Sometimes the rice layer is somewhat too thick, which might just indicate that sushis might not  be a prority for this restaurant (a wise choice indeed, market-wise, but still, a little effort would be greatly appreciated). Be aware that the reservation desk may treat you like cattles, and that punctuality of table avaibility is not their forte. The busmen do a better job than the waiters, who tend to be a little up-nose at times.

There are many fine Japanese restaurants in the area, but I chose Ozumo because I wanted nice ambience, design, music and quality food in one place -- which is exactly what the patron pays for at Ozumo. \n\nWe ordered: a seaweed salad, pumpkin robata, purple yam (potato) robata, vegetable rolls, inari rolls. Nigiri: Toro ($20 /2 pcs), Ikura, Jack. Dessert:  chocolate fondue. It was all excellent and high quality.  \nAll the sushi was very fresh and light on the palate.  The best seaweed salad I've ever had.  It was four kinds of seaweed, lightly dressed, clean-tasting, and only slightly salty.  The purple yam robata was amazing.  It came with a contrasting  smear of light creamy butter on top and slivers of crisp veggies. My husband is a  vegetarian and we find that veg dishes usually are second rate at sushi places -- not the case here.  The veg dishes were good quality and well-prepared. The fondue dessert came with a nice quality dark chocolate for dipping, mochi ice cream pieces, fresh fruit, and pieces of cake for dipping. Good for 1-3 people.\nAll the food was thoughtfully presented, with fair-sized, satisfying portions. The small plates were small as were expected for this type of cuisine. All in the top tier for what I've had in my lifetime. \n\nSERVICE: Very good waiter and support staff. Well-trained staff. The receptionists were cordial and quick. The whole staff greets you, and then thanks you on your way out. The waiter was prompt, friendly, knowledgeable. He gave us some very nice recommendations. The support staff always promptly and quietly removed soiled plates and cleaned in between courses.  We sat in the main dining room near the sushi bar and were able to observe the very mindful, professional, skillful sushi chefs at work.\n\nDECOR:  Very nice ambience, esp at night.  Dramatic lighting. Thoughtful, quality interior design, without being over the top. Warm colors and clean lines. The soft surfaces absorbed much of the dining room din. Nice views of the bridge from the main dining room in the sushi bar area. The food was served on good quality ceramics that weren't the cliched Japanese dish ware, designed not to interfere with the nice, simple presentation of the food.  Excellent DJ with upbeat, cool vibes on the Sun. night we visited.  The music was at a low volume enough to enjoy and hold a conversation comfortably. \n\nCOST:  Expensive.  Commensurate with the good quality of the experience.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  I have to admit that we were skeptical at first about the place because at so many restaurants the design eclipses the quality of the food and service. At Ozumo, food, service and decor are all high quality. \nFor a relaxing date, I recommend going on a Sunday night when the vibe is mellow and to avoid the after work drinking crowd.  For sushi, I recommend starting with the smallest omakase at $35 for nine pieces.  I will order set-priced omakase next time I visit because: 1)  I over-ordered a la carte and it cost me dearly. (I am not on an expense acct.) 2) I go for the recommended fish of the day anyway.  Thank you, Ozumo!", "author": "Mrs M."}

The sushi quality at Ozumo is not good.  Whenever I order the spicy tuna, or the yellowtail sashimi dish with the tomatoes, the fish tastes old and fishy.  Also, the sushi chef's slice the sashimi way too thick.  And I also noticed the fish is room temp.  Its nice when the fish has been kept cool - maybe that is why it tastes fishy - because its sitting out?  The first round, the waitress brought out the yellowtail sashimi (with the tomatoes and the yuzu type sauce). I had to send it back - it was awful.  So fishy.  Then she came back with the same dish, except this time they used \"different yellowtail\".  She said that the chef didn't use sushi-grade yellowtail the first go around, rather he used the yellowtail that they usually cook, subbing it in for our sashimi instead.  I don't see the common sense here???  Next: The shishito peppers were bland- there was no sauce or soy type of glaze.  They were grilled shishitos.  This restaurant has a cool vibe - its great for large parties, but that's it.  I'm sorry, but when I order a burger, it doesn't have to be amazing.  But when I order sushi, it has to be GREAT... not just ok.   It's raw fish!  Now - the one good thing I ordered at Ozumo is the kobe beef.  It was buttery and delicious.

I suppose they want to exude an image, like they're the kind of place that requires reservations.  Unfortunately for Ozumo, those days are over.

In fact, my favorite dishes are probably the miso black cod (literally melts in your mouth - almost as good as Nobu's) and the tuna tar tar (unlike any I've ever had, with a tofu and avocado puree as a base  - delish).\n\nThe sushi menu is limited, although everything I've had has been both fresh and delicious.

About $120 (w/o tip) for 2 people with no dessert, 1 app, like 4 rolls and 2 glasses of wine....  kinda insane, but worth it for a once a year treat.", "author": "Casey M."}

I've been here for happy hour as well as dinner in the main dining area overlooking the Bay Bridge. Their happy hours are decent but a little expensive-they actually serve smaller portions so you're not really getting a great deal but I do really like the space, their sushi rolls are pretty good overall and they have some good cocktails. I did, however, have the chef's Omakase meal in the main dining room and I have to say it wasn't worth it even though my date paid for it.

We were alarmed when we entered the place because at the entrance is a very loud, packed, trendy bar with a deafening noise level. Fortunately the large sushi bar in the back was calm, spacious and lovely.\nThe server was competent but was so obvious in her attempts to upsell us that it took some of the fun out of it. A $90 Kobe steak wasn't what we had in mind (we just  wanted sushi) and she looked so dissappointed when we didn't buy it or the extremely pricey bottle of sake that she'd recommended. \nThe sushi was fresh and tasty, but not especially well-presented. I think sushi should be cut consistently, but some of the nigiri were patched together with several pieces of fish - seemed rather amateurish. The selection was rather mundane. However, when we asked that the head sushi chef make us a special roll - some creation of his choice - we were pleased with it and the special roll that day (unagi and tuna, with jalapeno and flying fish roe). \nThe server redeemed herself by adding a dessert on the house because she knew it was my husband's birthday (I had mentioned it when making reservations), so that was an appreciated nice touch.", "author": "B H."}

Our waitress, came to take our order. After ordering about 5 dishes or so, she collected our menus, and asked us, \"Would you like any Sake to go along with your dinner?\" (ever so casually). Since she had already taken our menus, we said \"Sure, why don't you recommend something?\" She goes, \"OK, the first choice has a rice taste, the 2nd choice has a sweeter taste, and the 3rd choice is a really strong, slightly acidic.\" We were like, \"OK, the first one sounds great.\" When she brought us the sake, she apologized and said that it normally is served at room temperature, but it was in the refrigerator, so if we let it wait a bit, it should warm up a bit. We didn't complain though, and accepted it. Unfortunately, the sake was completely disgusting to us and we didn't even finish a shot each, but we didn't bother to return it. since it was his birthday and I didn't want to make a scene. When we got the receipt, I was shocked to see that the total was $220!! I knew that the entrees were already overpriced, but how could it possibly have summed up to $220?? I scrutinized the receipt, and realized that our waitress had charged me $78 for the bottle of sake!! I burst out crying and was so embarrassed that I might cause a scene that I just tipped her 15% of the total--not including the Sake--and we left in a hurry. \n\nThe next day I thought about it and discussed the situation with my coworkers and we concluded that it was completely inappropriate that she charged me so much without telling me how much it was (so sly--she had the menus in her hand and was so casual about suggesting sake), so I called the manager that evening in hope to get a refund on the sake. The general manager, was completely and outrageously rude and unprofessional to me. He was very impatient and curt on the phone, and after I told him my experience, all he said was, \"Well, I'm not going to refund your sake, and I'm concluding that this was just a matter of you not like your waitress' service, so I'll refund you the tip later this week that you left her.\" I was really unhappy about his decision, but he refused to give me anything else. The next day I called him again and tried to tell him it wasn't just about the tip that I wanted back, but the sake since I felt 'tricked' into getting such an expensive sake!! (I mean, it was it $78 for a tiny bottle, NOT to mention it was served incorrectly---freezing cold!!). The general manager was like, \"Look--we consider ourselves a very POSH restaurant, and if you can't afford to pay for this sake, you shouldn't even be coming here.\" I told him, \"Well I consider myself an excellent customer--I was more than happy to pay for ridiculously overpriced entrees, but that was my choice since the prices were written plainly on the menus and I wasn't tricked into anything.\" I told him, fine, that he didn't have to refund the entire cost, but certainly a more significant portion of it. Again, he repeated that they were a posh restaurant catering to a certain type of customers, and he would consider my case one more time and whatever decision he makes will show up on my credit card statement in a few days. After about a week,  I looked on my credit card statement, and he had only refunded my tip (as he originally was only willing to refund) PLUS $5!!!!  It was outrageous and outright offensive--he might as well just have refunded me the tip!! So I called him and asked him about it. Again, with his impatient and hostile manner, he said that \"He thought about it, and this was the decision he made.\" As simple as that. So there was nothing left for me to do, so I told him that I was going to certainly write reviews about the terrible, contemptuous, and patronizing service. He then yelled at me, \"Well if you do so, we have a legal department that will sue you, and I'm going to end this discussion right now\" and he hung up on me. So here I am, warning all of you of the waitress (make sure to choose your alcohol on your own or to make sure you know what the price is before she 'recommends' an outrageously and improperly served sake to you!) and of the general manager, the pretentious, patronizing, general manager that thinks he is all 'posh' and thinks that anyone that isn't willing to get ripped off is, in his words, pretty much unclassy and undeserving of even giving Ozumo their business.", "author": "Jasmine L."}

The original was by no means a bargain, but now they've taken some options off the happy hour \"specials\" and have altogether removed some of the better ones, namely the hamachi roll and the beef skewers (you now have to get it with chicken and vegetable skewers too and it's not a happy hour \"special\" any more.)  The Geisha Moon, now renamed something like the Geisha Margarita can be yummy, if made my the right bartender, but $10!   When I was presented the new menu, I assumed they expanded their happy hour specials to compete with the nearby Palomino's but that was not the case.  Different vibe,of course, but if you're just going to grab a drink with some co-workers/friends and not to looking for a \"singles scene\", then it is preferable.  Palomino's new happy hour menu has all apps and pizzas half off and draft beers and margaritas for $3...you know where I'll be more often...", "author": "Amina B."}

Started off with the garlic edamame which were really good.  Some people ordered bento boxes and some shared sushi.  I opted for a bento box since I don't eat raw fish and ordered the grilled sea bass.  The sushi came way ahead of the bento boxes and they looked really good.  15 - 20 minutes later our bento boxes came out and mine looked really pathetic.  My sea bass was the size of two fingers and was completely not fresh and overcooked.  It wasn't just a little dry, it was dry like cardboard.  Unfortunately, I missed breakfast and was starving so I forced myself to eat.  If I were with the bf, I would have sent it back, but bc I wasn't paying, I didn't want to seem rude.  The sea bass was accompanied by a tiny amount of rice, small mound of sliced cucumbers, orange slices, and a small amount of these wet veggies that tasted weird.  Cardboard sea bass and oranges for $15?  Wow.  I left the place with a headache bc I was still so hungry.  I realized I should have ordered a shrimp tempura roll or something bc the sushi did look good.  We had a variety of desserts but the one that stood out was the fondue.  I have to say that the service was very friendly but also very slow.  It took them forever to finally take our meal order.  Half of our table had eaten most of their sushi by the time the bento boxes arrived.  And it took us an extra 20 minutes just to get the bill paid.  Although I didn't pay, I won't be back.  There are way too many other restaurants for the same price or cheaper that will satisfy me.", "author": "Casey F."}

While I understand that restaurants get behind, I don't understand why I wasn't seated when there must have been 15 open tables when I finally walked back into the main dining room.  The hostess was rude, did not move the table for my friend so that he could actually get into his seat.  She forgot the drink menu which is a huge no no in my book.  Our waiter was one of those cool waiters that doesn't write any of your order down.  He needs to get a pad of paper.  He asked us outright if we wanted any edamame and we said no. Food runners proceeded to bring us 3 bowls of edamame (which we kept rejecting). We ordered our drinks and ended up waiting almost 30 minutes to get them.  We had to keep tracking our waiter down so that we could order food. We ordered a salad before the rest of our entree- we didn't get our salad until the end of our meal.  Plus food runners kept bringing dishes we didn't order to our table while our own food seemed to just never show up.  Plus when the bill came to our table there were about 3 items on our bill that we never ordered.  It was just AWFUL!!!!!", "author": "Anna S."}

The sauce was forgettable. The fish was not 'seared' properly as the cooked flesh extended most of the way, but not all the way to the center. Felt more like 'underdone' than 'seared'. No crisp, flavorful outer skin.\nBroccoli: If you give me a tiny piece of broccoli it better be good. This one was was overcooked and again in a thick brown forgettable sauce.\nRadish puree: ICK, it tasted off! I love radish and this one had sat a while to long at room temperature, enough to gain a bit of 'funk'. Without this particular flaw, the place might have squeaked by with 3 stars. Placing spoiled food on the plate is a health concern as well as just plain classless.\nCucumber Salad: Neither warm nor cold, made me think the bento box had sat around for a while, even though we ate promptly at noon.

My boyfriend who had ordered an entree  waited 30 minutes just to be served the wrong thing. When he said it was ok and he would just eat it the man quickly took the plate away leaving him to chew on his napkin for another 20 minutes! When he finally got his dish is was something we could have made at home with done a better job cooking. He left still hungry. I am a person who enjoys a dining experience as a whole.

Reasonable until the dish comes and includes 4 scallops (not giant ones- about the size of  quarters) and some seaweed.  Delicous as they were, 4 scallops couldn't possibly make even the lightest eater feel satisfied.  We thought that one roll, two entrees and some miso soup would be plently.  Not particularly huge eaters, we left hungry.  The waiter remarked that most people order 2 or three rolls and an entree.  We'd have been happy to order more, if our tab wasn't already over $140 with one cocktail a piece.

And the presentation is incredible for every dish! Every time I go I order the chef's special roll and I have never been disappointed. The garlic-woked edamame are fantastical and you must try them! I love the Sekiwaki, Ozumo, and the sumo roll. The green tea mochi with chocolate sauce sounded terrifying to me, but my friend ordered it and I took one bite and was in love. So delicious! They also have an incredible sake menu, and their liquor drink choices are quite tasty; I especially like the Tokyo Glow. The bar in this place is crackin after work on Fridays and the crowd is mostly FiDi-ers lookin to get a little tipsy after the long work week.

We had our own private room which was like 80 degrees hot and musty at times but what do you expect, the whole restaurant was packed.  I was told that the waiters would just \"bring stuff out for us\".  They began bringing out delicious dish after dish after dish.  Some highlights were the kobe beef, lamb, and rolls which names I can't remember.  We also had sake, beer, and a delicious chocolate fondue for dessert.  So, with every story  comes an ending and this particular  ending included an  $1,800.00 price tag. Holy Crap!  The kobe beef was $10 a piece for sashimi sized pieces and we had three plates of it. Thank God one of the guests was loaded and generous and decided to cover most of the bill.  So be careful when splurging at this place.  And don't forget to practice your Japanese in the restrooms where they play language tapes.", "author": "Glenda D."}

He likes sushi and this is where Brad who is also a sushi lover recommended we go. For drinks we started with the saki flights  2 of them,  there are 4 different flights on the menu and one flight gives you 3 full glasses its worth it.  The chef sent out an  amuse bouche  of  seared tuna on some greens with this killer olive oil that was just excellent.  Next we had the Hanabi...GET IT.the avacado is so good with the tuna. Right now for the summer they are doing  robata grilled items try the asparagus and the shoshito peppers both were great the mushrooms were just ok. The sushi was fresh and good & I would go here again however,  downside was that it did suffer from higher prices and i've had better if not just as good sushi for a fraction of the cost.  Great  atmosphere make sure you ask for a table where you can see the water its worth it!!", "author": "Renee L."}

We were lucky enough to catch a group standing up from one of the small tables near the entrance, so we didn't have to wait the estimated 30 minutes.

Past two times I have been here I have been extremely disappointed. The newer manager gives very poor service along with the waitstaff. The waitress wouldnt take the time to describe the robata menu. When she did, she lied about the mushroom dish, which we were under the impression was oysters. No explanantion or offer to take it back. Then we waited over 20 minutes on one roll, the place was half empty, and I finally asked the manager and he disappeared. He sends the waitress with the roll 10 minutes later and offers no apology or explanation. My husband overhears the manager talking to the waitress and saying rude stuff, that we were expecting her to run around and do what? Her job? Bring a roll within 20 minutes? How about some more hot water for my tea? We ordered $100 worth of rolls qnd drinks, sorry if we expected courtesy and a waitress willing to do her job and a manager that can offer some respect. The fish, especially shrimp tasted old. I love sushi, and at this point Sushi Raw on Taraval is much better. The price means nothing if you are treated well. They need lessons on customer service, they should try Gary Danko's for pointers. And the quality of fish is same as any Japantown restaurant. So disaapointed, this was a fave of mine a year or two ago. Maybe the trick is to drink enough sake so u dont notice the food quality or poor service.", "author": "Kim L."}

A number of reasons:\n  - The food - wonderful nigiri and sashimi, edamame (you *must* try the garlic/soy version).  Excellent \"cooked\" dishes as well (black cod and a variety of beef dishes).\n  - The staff - I always sit at the bar and, to a person, the bar staff is the best I've ever encountered.  Over the years, I've gotten to know each of them  and they are helpful, warm and friendly.  I can't speak about the guys working there, but I will also add that the women bar tending and cocktailing are all lovely as well.\n  - The atmosphere - they have various DJs in the evening and while some are better than others, it adds a \"vibe\" that is relaxing and energizing at the same time (go there and you'll see what I mean).\n  - The crowd - yes, there is some of the typical self-absorbed, new-money, ultra-hyphenated male crowd.  I've learned to ignore them.  There is also a fair amount of medically enhanced, money worshiping young women (both of the professional and amateur variety).  I admit that I have a bit more trouble ignoring them (some of them are so heart-stoppingly nice looking that it seems almost unreal).  Despite that, I almost always find someone to talk to and generally have an excellent evening.\n\nWould I be there so often if it weren't for the trusty expense account?  I would *want* to, but I'm not sure I could afford it.  It's expensive, but like my parents always said, you get what you pay for.", "author": "Michael F."}

This occasion was different. It was an inner office lunch and there service will have to modify from previous visits. In the past we been there and the service was outstanding, the food first rate, and nothing to really complain. But of course my girlfriend had to give her two cent (to be honest, it was perfect, then again, she is Korean (joke)) Moving on with my review. It was a 6:PM reservation with a party of 7.  We all get seated. Our waiter takes our drinks order and at no time I we felt pressure to order our entrees. And let me say, when our entrees came, our party was blown always with the first class service we received. I was also impressed when the floor manager came over and greeted our table. His professionalism was well welcome (I believe his name was Curtis) Any who, it was a good change from the usual feeling, get in, eat, get out, you get from most restaurants I've been to. And speaking of the food, we had the sashimi, a couple of small dishes, futago and hanabi, and I ended up with Kobe beef. By far, the best piece of steak I've ever had. Overall, will I bring my party to another sitting at Ozumo's, the answer is absolute f*# yeah; Pardon my French.", "author": "Daniel R."}
