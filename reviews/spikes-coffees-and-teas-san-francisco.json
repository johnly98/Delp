I came here in the afternoon with some friends while visiting SF and needed a quick caffeine fix-up and ordered a Cafe au Lait with soymilk as per advice from my coffee-loving Italian friend. Before ordering, I was allowed to same each different brew and decide which one I wanted in my drink. I had never tasted a soymilk based drink so smooth or clean-tasting in my life. Normally soy makes a pretty obvious substitution for milk, but this time I really enjoyed the slightly nutty flavor that it gave off. The pastries also looked excellent; my friends ordered an almond croissant and a lemon muffin which I nibbled off of. Both were decent. \n\nOverall a great first coffee experience in SF; would easily come back to try different blends of coffee.", "author": "Jerry T."}

Itadakimasu! Overstate much, Ed U.? Well, Jamie W. and I were back at Spike's after a long absence just because I was looking to have some hot liquid in my body after a brisk walk over the Swish Alps. It's still the same tiny place on 19th Street, but we take up less room so it didn't seem as claustrophobic on this visit. The service was pleasant enough but didn't seem that outstanding. Maybe I've gotten more crotchety over the years. I can cop to that. Get off my lawn!\n\nHowever, I did like the montage of dog photos which we stared at from the round table next to the front window (photo: http://bit.ly/2EwLqwY). This time, we took advantage of their robust tea selection (photo: http://bit.ly/2F9zMW6) and decided on a steeping $2.50 cup of Rooibos (photo: http://bit.ly/2C2YfNT). Jamie, never a fan of hot liquids, went with the $3 Ginger Peach Iced Tea. They offer all sorts of gummy candies, but we were good and stuck with our teas. We decided to replace our collective sweet tooth with subtle eavesdropping skills as we listened to an awkward blind date at the next table where the more interested guy kept laughing like a hyena at anything the other one said. Ah, I remember those days...\n\nTEA - 4 stars...nice loose-leaf quality\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...tiny space, crowds quickly\nSERVICE - 4 stars...good but remember that I am a curmudgeon\nTOTAL - 4 stars...good to be back, Spike", "author": "Ed U."}

They really do have THE BEST LATTE just like they said! \n\nPlace is tiny--this is the reason I'm only giving 4 stars. Right when you walk in, there are a few small tables and chairs to the left and to the right is a huge selection of coffee beans for purchase by the pound. There is a decent sized outside patio with tables and seating but on a beautiful sunny day like today, everything was taken up. \n\nAll the way at the back of the shop is where you order. There is one cashier and one barista. Once you place your order, there's hardly any space to even stand to wait for your order without blocking the cream counter and trash cans. However, they work quickly to get you your drink so it's not too bad. You can have any hot drink iced for extra $0.50. \n\nThis has got to be the best decaf iced latte I've had in the city of San Francisco. A lot of places can't get decaf right. Spike's decaf latte was very rich and robust--perfect with whole milk on ice. I'll definitely come by again for another iced latte when I'm in the neighborhood!", "author": "Betty R."}

I'll have some to be social (at times) or after a satisfying meal or if I'm about to pass out. But I don't crave the bean. I can take it or leave it. So, in order to have an opinion on a coffee shop, (for me) there needs to be more going on than just a so-and-so drip. Luckily (for me), Spike's has plenty of good stuff to go around.\n\nFirst and foremost, the energy here is really positive. I don't know if tptb burn sage, pet puppies, kiss babies, or ban all mentions of the Bieb, but from the second you walk in, you feel comfortable. It doesn't hurt that the employees are courteous. I might be overly sensitive to this last point. I live in a city that prides itself on bad service. I still am nicely surprised to be greeted with a smile. Combine all this with good smells and the endorphins are pumping. Time for coffee.\n\nI ordered a mocha. Again, I am not much of a coffee bean lover but I am mad for the cocoa bean. My mocha was smooth, a bit smoky and very very strong. Usually, I can toss these things back like shots but I needed to sip this. Not only was I able to taste and appreciate the beverage, I was able to quell the shakes from the direct injection of caffeine. So *this* is why people like coffee so much! Lastly, in a city which prides itself on supporting local business, it was nice to spend a little time at Spike's. I don't know much about the Castro (other than documentaries on PBS) but it seemed like this was an intensely local shop, catering to a local crowd and adored by its regulars. Maybe that's where all that good juju came from.", "author": "Johnny T."}

I understand if they are trying to do the whole \"community, not being tethered to a electronic device thing\".

But they have the workings to have a line out the door and yet its consistently empty.  Why not just be wifi free after 6pm? or no wifi on the weekends like trendy coffee shops in Seattle do.

I love all things pumpkin. I also love bulldogs. I happen to be the proud owner of an awesome English bulldog named Sherlock. \n\nWell, when I walked past Spike's Coffee one cold, windy, SF morning and saw that their mascot was a bulldog, you know I had to stop in for a refreshment. \nSpike's, which is located in the Castro, is a small, awesome little coffee house. I got to Spike's around 8:30am and since it was rather chilly outside there were quite a few people in line to purchase a warm beverage. Once inside I was greeted by a big display case full of donuts, scones, muffins, breakfast bars, cookies and other delicious looking baked goodies. Then I happened to glance up and I saw a big sign above their register that informed me that they were now offering warm pumpkin pie lattes for the fall. That was pretty much all it took. I knew I would be leaving Spike's with a pumpkin pie latte and a tasty sweet treat. \n\nSpike's PP latte was amazing. It had an awesome pumpkin flavor. It was slightly on the creamy side, just like a real PP and was topped with a mountain of sweet whipped cream. I also ordered their crunchy breakfast bar, which contained crunchy oats, mixed nuts and cranberries. I thought this bar was great and it went perfectly with my PP latte. \n\nThe staff at Spike's was super friendly. I noticed that they loved to joke around and chit chat with their regulars. The prices here were the same as any other chain coffee joint. \n\nIf I lived in SF I would definitely be a regular at Spike's. I would also bring Sherlock along with me every time I visited the shop. Who knows, maybe if we came enough I could talk them into putting his picture on their cups and merchandise. That would be awesome.", "author": "Craig R."}

Not only is the coffee just perfectly delicious (but not in a condescending way), the bakery items are awesome. Spike's doesn't have wifi, and I love that. This isn't a place to bust out your laptop and click away for hours. This is a place where you can take a moment to slow down before your busy day or read your book or catch up with a friend. \n\nBut honestly where Spike's excels most is their kick ass customer service. The staff is so warm and fun - they always put a smile on everyone's faces.

The coffee is great, while not the best in the city (who cares anyway?) you can go in at 6:30 in the morning, be greeted with a huge (albeit tired) smile of one of their many fabulous, friendly, and cute (c'mon you were thinking it too) baristas. Breakfast snacks are good, loose tea selection is unparalled in the neighborhood (Samovar doesn't even come close) NO CELL PHONES? NO PROBLEM, thank goodness there are still people out there how actually like to interact with other people (oh  my god, what a concept?) Come in to Spike's sit, slow down, relax, maybe I don't know strike up a conversation or maybe sit down and read an actual paper? \n\nSpike's is a privately owned neighborhood sole proprietorship which means it is not a chain or franchise, so no bulk buying discounts, no franchise perks, expensive rent in one of the most sought after neighborhoods in SF, all of the overhead and employee retention costs of every other coffee shop in the city (franchise or not).  \n\nYou will pay more here. Simple economics. The difference, you get what you pay for and Spike's is worth every dime.\n\nIf you don't have a minute, don't come. If you hate people and want to be part of an assembly line go to Peets or Starbucks. If you are a coffee snob, go to what ever trendy shop is being touted as the latest and the greatest in SF (seems to change every 2 or 3 years). If you want to enjoy yourself for a short minute, sip on some good joe and maybe mix with some neighborhood folks, go to Spike's.", "author": "dude m."}

In fact, I was the first straight woman the current owners had hired. So I may be a *little* prejudiced in my opinions, but where better to get a review than from the horse's mouth? This was the BEST work environment I ever had. The owner makes sure to pitch in like the rest of the staff and there really is a sense of teamwork by everyone.\n\nSo- I love Spike's. I still go down there a lot, and it's the kind of place where I always run into people I know. Why? Because the staff makes a point of remembering its regular customers' names and often their drinks too. Sure, we might have taken an extra minute chatting to the person ahead of you, but this is a neighborhood coffee shop, not a drive-through.\n\nAnd speaking of time, often that extra few seconds are spent making a quality drink. I mean, how often do you get your latte with a heart made in the foam? If you're seriously in a rush, the great thing is that it's perfectly OK to skip the line, grab a cup of one of the many self serve coffees, and drop your cash on the front bar with a nod to the barista. You'll probably hear someone say \"Thank you\" on your way out.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, you're sure to get your candy fix from the jars lining the shelves.", "author": "Emily L."}

All in all, a cute little place to visit with some great coffee, friendly, generous staff, and a good selection of treats.", "author": "Ryan T."}

I went to pay with my Visa card and they said they take it but prefer if i would pay cash.  They said is keeps the cost down.  As it is, their drinks are the same price as anywhere in the Castro.  If I want to pay with a card that they except then I should be able to and not feel pressured to pay cash when I had little on me.  Now I have to go the the ATM for cash for MUNI.", "author": "Bryan M."}

I'm even MORE thrilled to discover that Spike's is a fantastic place to get coffee nearly any time of day! It's open nice and early in the morning for a coffee-and-bagel on the way to work (omg, their bagels are fantastic) and they have lots of little tables to sit and enjoy a drink in the afternoon. All the staff are very friendly and nice and it's very clear that this is a neighborhood favorite: the staff greets many people by name and are also ready to have a conversation. The store itself is a little small so it can easily look packed, but it always moves quickly. The muffins are yummy, the coffee is tasty, five stars across the board.", "author": "Katie R."}

I always get the feeling that they are either piecing together little bits of genius or having a really fun party until someone comes in and then they stop to grind some beans or make a latte.  This probably just means they are happy people and I have an overactive imagination.  Either way it's a great spot.  Oh and the coffee is fabulous.  They have beans with a kick and caffeine content is provided. . . try the morning rush. . . . the best legal buzz around.   You can also get creative with your flavored syrups if you're into that.

I've not had many of the fancier coffee drinks, but they have them all, as well as some unique creations of their own. This place has tons more personality than any of the chain coffee shops in the Castro. I also like the fact that it has a neighborhood-center kind of feel. It's a place where locals come to chat and hang out with their neighbors. \"These are the people in your neighborhood\" as the old Sesame Street song goes,  Big thumbs up.", "author": "David M."}
