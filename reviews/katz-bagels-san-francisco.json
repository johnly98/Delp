I had been spoiled by the best NY bagels and was pleasantly surprised to find delicious bagels here in SF.\n\nI particularly liked their everything bagels, abundantly topped with a wide variety of seeds and more: sesame, poppy, garlic, onion, salt, fennel and caraway. These became my new \"gold standard\" of delicious bagels as a treat for breakfast or lunch, and I'd buy a dozen and keep them in my freezer.\n\nSeveral months ago I went in and asked for everything bagels. I was surprised to be given bagels with just a sparse sprinkling of sesame and poppy seeds. I asked \"Are these what you're offering as everything bagels? They're more like sesame and poppy combination bagels.\" The owner, Michael,  told me, \"Yeah, you're right - I should talk to the baker.\" \n\nI went back several weeks later and found the bagels to be as ungenerously prepared. I asked if Michael had spoken to the baker and he told me that he had not.\n\nFast forward two weeks: I went in, and when I saw the same bagels, stingily seeded, I said \"These are really disappointing - they used to have so many more seeds on them.\" Michael replied \"If you're disappointed go to another bagel store!\" and he proceeded to list a number of other bagel store options.\n\nPerhaps if you want a plain bagel - of whatever type dough - with no seeds, or simply one topping: poppy, sesame. etc. you'll really enjoy the bagels at Katz. I wasn't asking for something new - just what they had been offering for many years.\n\nThe rudeness with which I was addressed, whether I was recognized as a long-term customer or not, is not something that I can overlook, and they have lost me as a customer - hence the poor rating I've given.", "author": "Bruce F."}

Oh well, they're busy, I get it.\n\nI was really turned off by an experience this morning, though. I ordered the above combo with a large coffee that came out to about $8. When they called my order I saw they didn't use the pesto garlic cream cheese I always ask for, but instead used plain. I mentioned that I had asked for the pesto garlic (and that it's what I always ask for), to which the woman who took my order came out and said, \"No, you asked for plain.\" I told her that I had asked for the pesto garlic, that it's what I always get and that I don't really eat cream cheese, but like their pesto garlic. She simply ignored what I said and replied, \"No you didn't, you told me plain, so we gave you plain,\" and then stared at me. \n\nAgain, I get it, mistakes happen, and it's only cream cheese.

I adore the bagel choices, though you must get there early to get the full gamut. My favorite is the jalapeno bagel with bacon, cream cheese and tomatoes. It is loaded with bacon, the cream cheese and tomatoes are the background and are perfectly paired to cut the saltiness out of all that bacon!\n\nI usually order the lox bagel for my friend and I get a bite once and a while. It is delicious, smeared thick with cream cheese AND lox. They don't scrooge you on the good stuff!\n\nWhy should you go? There is good coffee and breakfast all over the mission, I know. But this little corner shop that has three of the same, not overly nice not rude at all women working!

I never approach Katz Bagels thinking that it will replicate the bagels I enjoyed in the Tri-State area-thus, I am not disappointed.  I've noticed that their bagels feature such small holes as to sometimes be mistaken for a hard roll.  But on weekend mornings when I can't deal with the crowds or the calorie count at Tartine, it's an okay place to get a bagel for carryout.  I take the bagel home, toast it up, and smear it with Trader Joe's hummus, and I'm no longer hungry.  Certainly not worthy of a trip across town, but if you're in the neighborhood...\n\nYes, it's a hassle that Katz's is cash only.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-11-18", "description": "Review for KATZ BAGELS' PIZZA:  Unfortunately, NOT pizza with a bagel crust which I've encountered in Venice Beach of all places (late night pizza goodness), and if you're familiar with Katz' pizza bagels sold at Rainbow Grocery, then you can understand when I heard that Katz on 16th had pizza I HAD to find out whether it was a bagel crust.  \n\nUnfortunately (again), they are touting themselves as thin crust, and it just doesn't cut it.  Tonight was my first foray into their 'Mission' pizza:  pepperoni, sausage, white onion, black olives with mozz and red sauce.  Well, the sauce was yum if not a little salty but that may have been the black olives which are super salty (at least proves they're fresh).  And, the crust while thin is NOT crispy which where I've been (New York, Chicago) thin crust means crispy, or at least, not soggy which is when the pizza is wet (from the toppings and sauce leaching liquid) and easily folds down with cheese and toppings sliding off onto your lap if you're not lucky.  I'm not wearing their toppings, but the crust was definitely soggy.  There wasn't even char on the bottom (sign of a good, strong pizza oven)!\n\nMy friend said, \"I don't like pizza that falls apart like this.\"  This is not to say that the pizza was not good although he did say something about not liking the sausage which is probably because it's slices of sausage rather than crumbled sausage which some people prefer (I prefer SHAVED sausage).  Again, good flavour-- sauce, toppings taste fresh (and LOOK fresh on the mise en place line which replaces the bagel smears and toppings from the breakfast shift)-- and you can't beat 16th street for atmosphere.  \n\nThe crust  still needs work-- it's very non-descript, if not overly chewy from overworked dough.  This is not how their bagels taste-- they're perfectly chewy with that extra West Coast fluffliness (remember, it's the water here not the technique)-- so that would have been clever to taste in a pizza crust (would it have tasted like a hotpocket?), at least the tangy flavour of boiled dough would have been more interesting than what they've got going now.\n\nThe pizza at katz is relatively new, so I'll wait for them to work out the kinks.  The other pizza designs look promising-- the Kat's pizza:  arugula, chokes, prosciutto, parmesan (viva los foodies!)-- so I'll check them in a few months.  They better hook it up real fast though, as Little Star appears to be opening a satellite on 14th and Mish.", "author": "E L."}

And if you don't understand Spanish, they may be talking smack about you, too.\n\n(Oh yea, I have lived in the Mission for 30 years (when I am not out living in other parts of the world so I am not the Marina yuppie customer Nomad G warns about.)", "author": "sweaterhead x."}

I regularly order an  Everything with avocado, hummus and sprouts and it is the bomb. I always order lattes here as well. I don't know why, but they've got the best foam in the area. Missing a star only because the ambience leaves a bit to be desired. The customer service here is great, and even with a line you're never waiting for long.

No, they're not as good as your great NYC bagels, but what do you expect on the West Coast? Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, and their chive cream cheese is my favorite. Very nice staff, and they make a mean latte too. But what the hell is up with the pizza? Why ruin a good bagel with pizza? Loose the pizza and focus on the BAGELS.", "author": "G G."}

NOPE!  it was not your \"regular\" size bagel but smaller (maybe i'm too use to the supersize foods in US).  and granted i do love cream cheese but boy did they give me WAY too much cream cheese.  i guess more cream cheese is suppose to make up for the size?!\nthe employees were nice but i was turned off by the random homeless person that wandered into the store to solicit...the employees did nothing to prevent their customers from being harassed INSIDE the store.\nto say the least, we were disappointed but my friend is determined to try this place again...good luck to him.", "author": "Hanh L."}

Imagine a toasty sesame bagel with just enough cream cheese, succulent and generous slices of lox, topped with capers, tomatoes, onions, and sprouts....heaven.

On the rare occasions that I have eaten here, I enjoy looking at the photos they have displayed of neighborhood folks ranging from babies to senior citizens.

It's so good I'll go there on Saturday afternoons after sleeping in and have bagels for lunch. The best bagels in SF by far. The service is amazing. This place is always packed and the people working here are still able to handle everyone quickly. I almost feel bad for the workers here because the crowd at this place is often filled with a bunch of yuppie white people (even though it's in the Mission). I've seen so many rude customers complaining about every little possible thing. Sometimes I just want to slap them because it's a disgrace. The people who work at this place are working like dogs probably for low wages and they still always are polite, quick, and professional. I've seen some of these people working at 2am at night baking the bagels for the next day.  I'm sick of all the Marina wanna-be yuppies in the Mission. This place still rocks. Just ignore the customers.", "author": "Hmmm W."}
