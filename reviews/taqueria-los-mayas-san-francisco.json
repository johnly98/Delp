I had never been there but heard it was very good through a mutual friend who works in the food industry.  \n\nIt was about 7PM on Cinco de Mayo Saturday, and Taqueria Los Mayas was (surprisingly) not busy.  Maybe everyone was eating out in the Mission rather than in Inner Richmond.   I walked straight to the counter to order dinner.  The menu is Mexican and Yucatan cuisine so I did not recognize many of the dishes.  The cashier (and I think owner?) noticed I hesitated at the counter.  He asked if I had ever been here, to which I replied no.  He gave me a hard copy of the menu then walked away before I could ask for his recommendation.  \n\nI decided to order al pastor panuchos (Yucatan tacos) and a plantain burrito.  Delicious!  The menus has a mix of both recognizable and unfamiliar dishes.  I had never had panuchos or a burrito with plantains and loved every bite of both dishes!  \n\nThere are some quirks with service and operations but I would definitely come back for the food.\n\nPROS: \n- Salsa and chips bar was on point (the green salsa is super spicy even for someone who loves spice!)\n- Tasty food\n\nCONS: \n- No alcohol\n- Sticky tables (gross) so I had to wipe them down myself\n- Not the most helpful staff but thankfully we picked out dishes that were satisfying\n- There was empty water jug and no glasses in sight by the bar for self-service.

When looking for lunch spots, we decided to check out Taqueria Los Mayas. We arrived before the lunch rush on Monday, December 11th around 12:15pm. We placed our order for takeout.\n\nTacos de la Abuelita: pickled red onions, cabbage, salsa, cilantro ($3.75 each)\n*Al Pastor: Mexico City-style barbecued pork\n*Pollo Con Mole Poblano: a fusion of pueblan and yucatecan moles combining sweet habanero with a dozen spices\n*Bisteca a la Mexicana: steak marinated in orange and lime juices, cilantro, onion, salt and pepper\n\nI'm a taco girl, so I got the three tacos listed above. I love a nice smokey flavor in my meat, but most of these were more stewed, so a little mushy. Even the al pastor which was kind of weird. It did have a nice chew though. The taco tortillas were different. Not corn or flour, but more like masa. I didn't really eat the tortillas so I can't advise on the difference, but it did get soggy in transit and wouldn't stay together to eat as a taco.\n\n*Breakfast Burrito: eggs, beans, rice, potato ($8), add Al Pastor (+$2.50)\n*Elote Loco: street corn with mayo, cheese, chile ($4)\n*Churros ($4.50)\n*Chips (1st order free with purchase, additional order $2 each)\n\nThe roomie got the burrito, I got the elote, and we shared the churros. I adored the elote. The corn was cooked nicely. The kernels were plump and juicy. The mayo, cheese, chile, and lime added a nice contrast in flavor though I wish the mixture was thicker so it would stick to the corn more. The churros were amazing. Fresh out of the fryer, so a nice crispy exterior. The whipped cream did dissipate in transit, so there really wasn't any when we got home.\n\nSalsas\n*Salsa de Mango: mango, pineapple, orange juice, garlic, chipotle, salt & pepper\n*Salsa Verde: tomatillo, jalapeno, garlic, cilantro, salt & pepper\n*Salsa Ranchera: tomato, tomatillo, garlic and olive oil\n*Salsa Habanero: fiery smoked habanero, garlic, onion and touch of tomato\n\nThey have a great salsa bar of the variety listed above along with Pickled jalapenos and carrots, Cilantro, Onions, Limes, and Radishes. I love salsa, so I got a 2-3 containers of each. My favs were the ranchera and habanero. The habanero had a nice kick. For some reason, I adore mango habanero, so mixing the two salsas provided that spicy sweet kick that enjoyed with the free chips.\n\nThe tacos weren't really my thing. Maybe I'm more into traditional meats like carne asada, but I felt they were the weakest item. Rounding up to 4 stars due to the service. Everyone behind the counter really was sweet and accommodating.", "author": "Elena N."}

Some of his lunch photos bring to mind surgical excisions. So, as you might suspect, tacos are not a go-to dish for me.\n\nBut this restaurant is inviting, and it has other dishes on the menu. My dining buddies have adopted it as one of the customary stops on our weekly restaurant rotation (they are creatures of habit). We always meet around 5:15 pm during the week, and the place is usually not busy at that time.\n\nSince this gringo is not able to explain the dishes very well, you might look at the Los Mayas web site to get an idea of the offerings. Some dishes arrive in crisp tortilla shells. The salads I have had there include a nice variety of veggies tossed together with flavorful dressings. The pulled-pork quesadillas have an inviting, savory aroma. You might have to wait for the soup, however, and it might not be worth the wait.\n\nThe restaurant seems to cater to the local neighborhood. A place you go when you get home from work and the fridge is empty. You can sit by yourself on a stool with your burrito, and watch TV on the wall-mounted screens. You probably won't feel lonely or out of place.\n\nYou order what you want from a wall-mounted menu behind the cash register. They give you one of those flashing red, buzzing things, but sometimes they deliver the dishes to your table anyway. You can see the food being prepared in a kitchen behind the register.\n\nThe decor is airy, with big picture windows, high ceilings, and modern-plain style tables and countertops. Having both background music and no sound-absorbing materials to speak of, the place isn't exactly quiet. Table conversation takes a bit of effort. Recently families have discovered the place, and there has been the din of screaming children.\n\nYou're probably too young to remember the TV series \"Get Smart\", but if you do remember, think of the plexiglass \"cone of silence\" that Max's boss employed unsuccessfully for confidential conversations. Volume notwithstanding, the music has been pretty good at times, and once I broke into a brief salsa as we were leaving.\n\nAnd speaking of breaking...\n\nThose of us who, like myself, suffer from klutziness should take note of the concrete flooring. The Mexican Coke bottles shatter in dramatic fashion when they tumble off the table, leaving little doubt among your neighbors as to who has transgressed. The metal chairs don't slide very well, and tipping one of those can also be embarrassing.\n\nOnce when I was leaning over the counter to inquire about a menu item, my jacket caught a thick glass vase that they used as the tip jar (with emphasis here on the past tense). The thing exploded, scattering dollar bills, quarters, and pointy glass shards over some distance. I got on my knees to collect the money, which may have looked even worse--like a pi\u00f1ata party gone mad. \n\nNow there's another fragile-looking tip container there, so be forewarned about leaning over the counter.\n\nEven as a non-aficionado of the cuisine, I can still find something I can eat for around $10-$12. I can tell them not to make it too spicy or use raw onions (my bugaboos).\n\nGo ahead and try the place. But klutzy types beware!", "author": "Donald J L."}

We were hungry, saw this well lit Mexican restaurant, with a sign outside saying \"Taco tuesday.\" Looked up the reviews on yelp - solid 4 stars. Dined by impulse and hunger.\n\nI got the 2 tacos for $5 that Tuesday. Otherwise they're priced at 3.75 each. They were on the smaller side though, so I would recommend getting 3. I got the Cochinita Pibil (pork marinated in fresh citrus juice, annatto and achiote, roasted in banana leaves for 6 hours), and the Bisteca a la Mexicana (steak marinated in orange and lime juices, cilantro, onion, salt and pepper). I just didn't like my tacos because both were so WET. SO soggy. Just kind of ruined both tacos, especially the soft shell. We also got guacamole to share (chips are on the house btw), but the chips were just room temperature, not hot. Also I prefer chunkier guac, and theirs was on the thin, pureed side.

I ordered the carnitas burrito ($7.99), which was good but not great.  The restaurant is clean and the salsa bar is solid - be warned though, as the 'spicy' salsa is really really hot, which is something I appreciated.  If you live in the neighborhood, I'm sure this would be a solid, go-to spot but in a city where you can have food from your favorite restaurants delivered to you quickly and easily, I'd likely go elsewhere.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood, definitely try this spot out since the restaurant is well run and the food is solid without being over spiced / flavored.", "author": "Tom G."}

It's got a really chill, laid back vibe, good music, and good, speedy service. I really can't complain too much.\n\nComing in at 1 PM on a Monday, there was a short line of like 4 people, but it didn't take very long for us to order. It looks like a lot of people order stuff to-go, so the restaurant wasn't packed on a weekday. \n\nI ordered the Pescado Del Dia burrito, which totaled up to be $10.75. The listed burrito price was $8.75 and I didn't see anything obvious saying that the fish option was going to cost more, but I didn't read the menu that thoroughly, so that might be on me. I did have to look at one part of the menu to see the burrito option, and another part of the menu to see the meat options, so I admit I did get confused. But to be honest, I kind of expected an upcharge for fish, so I wasn't super fazed by it. \n\nThey give you one of those buzzer things for your order, so I grabbed some free ice water they had up front, and about 7 minutes later I picked up my order with some free chips and salsa. \n\nThe chips were semi-warm and my burrito was piping hot, like it was fresh off the stove. The chips were pretty average, and the salsas were pretty good. There was an orange-colored salsa with black pepper-like specks in it that people who don't enjoy spicy food should probably avoid. It was like eating a mouthful of lava, but lava with pretty good flavor. The salsa verde was pretty standard.\n\nI think my burrito was filled with Spanish rice, because the rice had a really deep but not overpowering tomato flavor, which really sets it apart from other places. The fish was really nice and flaky and had a good clean flavor. With the really flavorful rice, the nice big chunks of fish, and the burrito staying hot all the way through my meal, it was really a good experience! \n\nThe size of the burrito was pretty solid. I wasn't hungry at the end of the meal, but it wasn't going to weigh me down either. For the price in the location it's in, it's not a terrible value, but it's not cheap either. \n\nOverall, it was a pretty solid experience! I'd definitely give it a try if you're in the area and craving Mexican, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for it.", "author": "Eric Y."}

I love how most of the typical dishes are already set, you just pick your protein and your money! Best proteins (the only ones I've tried) were Conchita Pibil (pork) and Pollo Mole Poblano (chicken). Personally the chicken one is sooooo bomb, the poblano gives it a nice smoke and contrasts the sweet mole. Conchita Pibil is just a goddess of a tender pork, just try it.\n\nTortas (sandwiches) are decent size. I think it's called panuchos, which is just a black bean stuffed flat taco with your choice of protein and lettuce is bomb dot com too.\n\nAgua frescas are expensive, so no for me.

All three were delicious - I could taste bold flavors on each one. The portion size was great. The protein was stacked onto the panucho and in addition the toppings like avocado and pickled red onion made them a little hard to close and eat (which is an awesome thing).\n\nThe only slight negative I had was regarding my elote. The flavors were great and the corn used was really, really fresh but I just wished there was more of the mayo, cheese, and chili on it.

My concern was about the way the Taco Salad is prepared by one of the cooks who used his bare hands to handle ALL the raw food such as salad greens, tomato, cucumber, mango, etc...and then taking some of the food ingredients out of the Taco salad he started to put together because he made an error in making it, then putting that same food ingredient on the line counter alongside the dirty rags they used to wipe down the counter, then put it back into the NEW salad he made for me (per the Manager's and my request.\nAs I watched him do this, I should have videotaped him and reported his process to the Restaurant Licensing bureau, but i thought of videotaping after the fact.  I was shocked at how careless this cook was.    I hope the Manager and this cook review their ways of food prep before they make someone sick with careless food poisoning.  \nHe made my Taco Salad a total of 3 times.  The 3rd time because I spoke to the Manager about how he made the 2nd one.   Why did I even give it a second chance?  Good question!   \nI mean well by writing this honest review.    Good tasting food is NO good if it's not handled clean and properly!   I suggest this restaurant start by getting some food handling utensils like salad tongs.   And develop some care in food prep.

I mix the mango and habanero salsa and I would say it's possibly the best I've had - be warned tho, it is very spicy and not for the faint-hearted. :) \n\nAdded note: the ranchera and salsa verde are top notch as well. \n\nAnyway, for main course. MY girlfriend and I had the Pozole Verde which was super tasty. Full of bold unique flavors and spices. A very comforting stew to say the least and a large portion at that, so g/f and I shared.  Along with that we each had a yucatecan style taco basically, called a \"panucho\". Open faced, colorful pickled red onion, avocado, black beans, fresh masa house made crispy tortillas and super juicy, delicious pork. Probably the highlight, but it's hard to choose between that and the marinated steak burrito which was also incredible.  All of this accompanied by fast, awesome service I will definitely be stopping in more frequently to discover what all this spot has to offer. A well deserved 5 stars.", "author": "Stephen M."}

Primarily for it's old dry meats and ridiculous protein to starch ratio.  And especially for all the undeserved hype from people who have either not been around or grew up on Taco bell.  SHAME ON YOU!!!\n\n*deep breath*.....ok.... So this place has made me believe. \n\nAll their land based proteins are freaking amazing...you know why?  Reason 1: Cause it's cooked fresh!  It hasn't been sitting in a stupid meat warming bin.  How do i know it's cooked fresh...well ONE the meat isn't a dry bland mess.  and TWO it takes 10-20 minutes for your order to come out....coincidentally as long as it cooks to cook up a Spanky sized order (order for 2 or 3 humans). Reason 2: the Chef is amazing!  Did this guy have some kind of amazing restaurant he left just to rough it in our hood?  For real i dig his mad attention to detail.  The presentation was a feast for the eyes and his food don't deliver lies be dropping pounds to them thighs!  \n\nThe other had the fish and that ish was good too!

I love tofu tacos, but this is large chunks of tofu, or what another person next to me called \"Tofu Logs.\" Which means the inside of the tofu, it had no flavor. Smaller pieces. Also, here's a tip if the owners are reading this: freezing tofu creates little pockets, little holes, makes the tofu spongey, yes, but if you chop it up into small m-&-m size pieces, they soak up that flavor sauce real good.\n\nHere's another thing: no enchiladas? \n\nI don't mind waiting, they took a while, that was cool, they warned us with a sign that shows a cook just standing there, not doing anything, so I guess that might be one reason they take their time. \n\nThis place has potential, but what I don't get is why they're trying to reinvent the wheel.

It's not your typical spot and greasy purest (of what I have no idea) may not find it genuine, but let me tell you it is.\n\nThe mix of northern and southern Mexican flavors, fresh ingredients, and amazing friendly service had finally brought a spot you can find authentic homemade food.  For example, recently they changed the tamales noticeably.  Found out they changed to a longer process to get a better product.\n\nI saw someone call this place out for not having hot enough sauces.  Clearly the misguided fool did not try the right one.  Considering they serve you 3-5 sauces with your meal you have a choice of great authentic sauces.  Now I mention \"authentic\" because in Mexico they don't have to burn your palate to be Mexican.  That's what's great with this regional type of Taqueria.\n\nThe staff is great and really care about your experience.  The owner in speaking to him more than anything wants to serve great food and since my first time until now working with his cooks the difference has been substantial!  Love it!\n\nMy favorite is the changes to the El Pastor I took in my Taco Abuelito and the carne asado on my Panucho (Yucat\u00e1n taco) are my favorites.

First we got one burrito place, which was a miracle in itself, and then we got Los Mayas! Both places have their strengths, and I like them for different reasons. Los Mayas has intriguing flavors, from a part of Mexico most typical SF Taquerias overlook. I would say that the palate leans towards sweet /sweet and salty, and some folks are not down with that. I think that's why there's some criticism about this place. That said, I LOVE their chicken burrito, which has flavors of orange. You can have a plantain burrito with any kind of protein, and my vegetarian husband swoons over their tofu & veggie burrito. He has that sometimes with plantain. We also love the empanadas, which are deep fried. We ask for just cheese, and they're happy to oblige. For a special street - food treat they have the elotes locos. We only ever get stuff to go, so I can't speak to the restaurant dining experience.\nWhen they first opened, there were a few bumps mainly with cooks not paying attention to the order tickets and incorrectly including milk in beef burritos, etc. HOWEVER. The owner actually HAND DELIVERED the correct order to my HOME. That kind of customer service has been long dead in SF. This guy really cares about the quality of customer interactions and the quality of his food. He's never been anything other than polite, and has also double checked our to go orders to make sure no mistakes are made. I think this place is great. Los Mayas finally broke through the asian restaurant glass ceiling on Clement. Us long-time locals are stoked.", "author": "roz A."}

The problem is there are no speakers in the counter and kitchen area, so the staff blasts the music loud enough to hear it in the back. That may make the sound level just right when you're behind the counter, but it's WAY TOO loud in the dining area. Really, really, too loud. I realize the staff deserves to hear music, too, so please install some speakers in the kitchen and counter area for the staff so your customers don't have to suffer.

The plates are more artfully arranged, which, per usual, means smaller portions. The flavors were good, but somehow misses the comfort and charm of the typical Mexican fare. \n\nI had the Al Pastor pork Plato and platanos, with tortillas, beans, and salsa. They provide free corn chips and a raft of several salsas. The pork was pretty good, though I think I'll try a different protein next time. The black beans were unexpectedly pur\u00e9ed, but were still pretty good. \n\nThe ambiance is probably more on the casual side, and doesn't quite match up the tone of the food. They have TVs going all the time, so it's probably a decent place to catch a game.  There's a good amount of seating if it's not especially busy. \n\nOverall, I'd probably rate this as more of a three and a half stars for now, until I make a second trip.", "author": "Christine L."}

Upon first walking in I must say the restaurant was pretty clean, The menu was very confusing at first glance but after staring at it for a couple of minutes I figured out the layout. One must take notice that some items on the menu do not have prices. This is because they will tell you the price right as you're checking out because it is higher than normal.  Whatever, I'm a small business owner so I know how you have to do what you need to do to pay your lease and stay in business. I gave a 20% tip and waited for my food.  For one people behind me got their order before I did but I didn't really care about that. I kindly asked one of the employees if I could get a side of sour cream once I had gotten my food.  She came back out with it and handed it to me and then said that will be a dollar. At that point I felt like she was being a bit petty since I had already checked out and it said no we're on the menu that sides were extra.\n\nI had ordered a supreme quesadilla which was supposed to have come with sour cream but it didn't, I was a bit shocked to find out that I had to pay extra for it while on the phone she waited at my table until I came up to the register with the cash and then proceeded to charge me for the sour cream as well as tax on what was under two dollars for a quarter size of sour cream. Clearly irritated, I took my change in my back to my seat while continuing my phone conversation. Apparently it was funny and she had the need to tell everyone behind the counter that I said it was a joke to charge sales tax on a side of sour cream that was to have come with my entree. I am more irritated at the lack of customer service especially after I left a giant tip for them doing absolutely nothing on their end. It's customer service that is not petty that make businesses successful.  As far as the food goes I was not impressed, the Americana on 35th and balboa has their quesadillas than this \"Mexican\" restaurant.\n\nI don't normally leave bad reviews but when I have and an exceptionally bad experience I want others to be aware.

I work nearby and sometimes customers would ask me where they could go for a good burrito so this opening was a great addition to the neighborhood. \n\nI came here for the third time today. All three times I got the Carne Asada burrito. The first two times were quite good with the mini sauces that comes with the chips as well. The yellow one especially compliments the burrito well. If I wrote my review based on the first two times, I would've gave them a 4 or a 5. This third time around, I noticed the burrito went from $9.75 to $10.75. At first I wasn't too bothered as long as the quality stayed the same but unfortunately, it didn't. The first two tasted like everything was fresh. The third time, the mini cup sauces were like gelatin and didn't pour out smoothly (one of the female workers there were nice to give me an extra cup of sauce though). Besides that, the burrito was the main disappointment today. The flavors were there but for some reason, the first bite and a big portion of the bottom were drenched in oil. At first I thought it was the juice from the meat but it was definitely oil. The oil went through the burrito foil, two layers of paper towels and onto the table. It's as if the $1 increase was to pay for the extra oil your burrito comes with.

I asked him nicely to remake it with refried beans. He then came back to me again telling me it would take another 15 mins to remake and I told him that was totally ok with me.

Be patient with them, the place is new and they don't quite have their groove down yet with cleanup and service but they are trying. They will get there though because they are aware that they need more help. All of the pork dishes is there are amazing and the chicken mole is out of this world. Fresh chips and salsas and please venture out from burritos and tacos because their more traditional options are so refreshing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-23", "description": "Based on one Cochinito Super Burrito:\n\nThis restaurant has solid potential. The menu is intriguing enough in regards to Yucatecan authenticity. Sadly, the execution and flavor nuances of the Burrito were noticeably bland. I had to go home and doctor it up with my own salsa to bring it up to speed. The accompanying, microscopically portioned salsas were thimbles, barely filling the tip of your tongue. The classic sour orange, citrusy accents were lacking in the pork filling. In fact, the portions of the salsa were laughable to the point of being a joke.\n\nThe restaurant seems to be 'down' flavoring so not to offend anyone rather than cooking 'all out.' Perhaps it is deliberately underestimating the tolerance for heat and forward spiciness from its clientele as a business decision to reflect what San Francisco has become? San Franciscans had always appreciated a bolder, more extreme approach to seasoning or at least have the necessary condiments available to make adjustments to suit their tastes.\n\n As such, the Burrito was near flavorless and certainly over priced although the size was fine for me. Perhaps like the nearby and expensive Farmer's market, Taqueria Los Mayas has an eye on the 'Tony' and well-heeled Laurel Heights/Lake St. crowd. This demographic has no problem dropping $11.00 per slab. Price is no object in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood, but  flavor should be. Trying for the white Yuppie market insults the grandeur of real Mexican cooking just like toned down Sichuan cooking seems fake.\n\nHaving said all this I still intend to come back and sample many of interesting items on the menu. One Burrito is obviously not enough exposure to form any judgment. This review is just a first impression, no more no less. Clement Street, as the Richmond District itself, is in desperate need of a quality Mexican Taqueria and Restaurant. It could be an easy and hugely successful enterprise if done right without compromises.\n\nAnalogously, when one goes out to eat Sichuanese cuisine one expects some real chili force; it is not the same as going to a good Cantonese restaurant where refinement and subtlety are the calling cards. So it's an issue of 'identity' through authenticity. Similarly, Taqueria Los Mayas should know what it is and should be. Dumbing itself down in the flavor department is a recipe for disaster and bad business. As Ice Cube says, \"It's about being real.\" But then is San Francisco itself still 'real?'", "author": "George G."}

He agreed and was sad eating the remainder of his burrito - sorry for the buzz kill honey. Chicken mole tasted very meh - I think if you used canned mole sauce with shredded chicken you would get a tastier result. Cochinita pibil - also pretty bland, definitely not a redeeming meat option. I think the biggest ripoff of the night though was the horchata for $4.50 which was SO watered down.

I'm vegetarian, so I figured I'd have to get my usual veggie burrito. Wrong. :)  They offer vegetable and tofu versions of each of the items on their menu. So I got a veggie panucho, a tofu sope and a mango aqua fresca. The veggie panucho was great. It even had pickled onions on top. The tofu in the sope was actually fried and tasted great. Usually when I get tofu in a Mexican restaurant it doesn't have much flavor, but this did. The aqua fresca was super fresh and not too sweet, just the way I like it. And the two salsa that came with the meal were fresh tasting and different from the usual salsas. One was fruity, possibly mango, and the other was tomato based but fresh and different from what I am usually served. I want to go back to try the elote loco and platanos too. It's really nice when a small restaurant like this has so many options for vegetarians, and that everything tastes authentic. I will be going back soon.", "author": "Kevin C."}
