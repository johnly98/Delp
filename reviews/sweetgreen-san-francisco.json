They had this amazing omega-3 fish salad. I looked for the salad this time, and it looks like they have done away with most of the pre-made options and replaced it with 2-3 seasonal salads (none of which looked particularly interesting to me). So I decided to make my own salad.\n\nIt started off poorly when I couldn't figure out where the list of my protein options were. There's a board listing some of the items, but I later discovered that it wasn't comprehensive.\n\nI asked the lady. She listed all of the options. I was already overwhelmed with trying to keep a list of ingredients I wanted in my head. \n\nIt's cafeteria line style so you get to see all the options you can put on your salad. The problem was that there were no labels for anything. Not only was I not sure what some of the things were, I also didn't know if they were premium items, which were extra.\n\nMe: \"Can I get the heirloom tomatoes?\"\nLady: \"That is extra, is that ok?\" (Note: she was great, because she told me these things upfront. Some places don't say anything, and then you pay $25 for what you thought was a $12 salad.)\nMe: \"Oh ok, can I get the regular tomatoes then?\"\nLady: (gets tomatoes- ok good, that's not extra)\nMe: \"Can I get the peaches?\"\nLady: \"Oh that is also extra.\"\nMe: \"Ok.... what is not extra?\"\nLady: \"Apples aren't extra.\"\nMe: \"Ok... I'll get the apples then.\"\n(And it went on like that for a while as I tried to guess which items were extra and not extra)\n\nI mean really? Protein- extra. I get it. Avocado- extra. I get it. Peaches are extra, but apples are not? I don't get it. Roasted brussels are extra, but roasted broccoli is not? I don't get it. The haphazardness of this wouldn't be a problem if they just clearly stated everything. It's cool that things are seasonal and local, but it is super frustrating not to know what you are getting for what you're paying. I spent probably 10 mins just standing in front of the menu trying to figure out what to get.\n\nAs for the salad, it was fine. The spicy cashew dressing was really good. The portion was on the weaker side for a salad.", "author": "Alice T."}

The first time was perfect - every ingredient was mixed well together, great portion of burrata right on top to mix in. The second time I got ordered online and picked it up, and nothing was mixed together. I'm paying the same price, and am doing more work. Sadness. Third time, I went in person, waited in line for over 30 mins, and my salad wasn't filled to the top. I felt a bit ripped off. The 4th time, the basil wasn't ripped up, so I got some whole basil leaves within some bites, and they let the liquids drip in the salad, so I got basil water and burrata liquids (the condensation part from the lid?) into my salad.", "author": "Rita W."}

My East Coast friends kept raving about this spot though, so I decided to come along with them.\n\nI got the shroomami (warm portabello mushroom) and a build your own with arugula, beets, dill, broccoli, and sweet potatoes, topped with miso dressing. The portabello mushroom was meaty, and cut into 1\" pieces that were just enough for mouthfeel, but not overly large. The tofu was fine, but not memorable. Ingredients went together well, and overall felt filling. I think this is great for someone who likes chopped salad, but a different style from Mixt and Tender Greens where the focus is on seeing the ingredients as large pieces.\n\nThe build your own tasted pretty similar to the shroomami given the overlap in ingredients I got. The beets and sweet potatoes were a good texture, and sliced thinly so you got good flavor in your mouth without having to chew a lot. The miso dressing added a good flavor, but wasn't anything I really had a strong opinion on. Overall, one salad was sufficient for a dinner portion. I added a piece of steelhead (+$5) and while it tasted fine, I thought it was a bit stiff / super healthy tasting vs. the meats at Mixt (like the steak) and at Tender Greens (like the ahi tuna).\n\nI don't quite understand the hype given prices, but it's tasty.

The same standard salad (Kale Caesar with chicken) ordered on 3 occasions was all over the map - one had a paltry 6 small pieces of chicken, another way too much shaved cheese. The ratio of kale to romaine was also pretty inconsistent. On one occasion the Caesar dressing was spot on delicious and the other times, too much acid or too much of a raw garlic taste.\n\nOn top of that, the promise of ordering ahead and avoiding the super long line remains elusive. On one occasion my salad was ready early while most other times it's 5-10 late. Today, it was almost 20 mins late. An entire group of 5-6 of us commiserated over our hunger pangs against the back wall. One woman's salad was 35 mins late and then came with two ingredients missing.\n\nFor a place that stamps out mostly standard salads, I'm surprised by the inconsistency in preparation and delivery times.

No offense to the previous owners, but that dismal Hong Kong-style fast food operation was well, dismal...like sitting in Economy class eating a meal you paid for and hoping to God the flight attendant would hurry back so you didn't have to keep staring at it. Yep, that bad. Now it appears to be a Mixt-type chain operation where the Chipotle-style approach gets applied to meal-size salads and warm grain bowls. It was the brainchild of three Georgetown students back east where they opened their first one in D.C. a decade ago. There are nearly forty of them, and there's no stopping them now.\n\nThey've started their assault on the West Coast, first at the old Oscar's in Berkeley (how I miss their greasy burgers) and now here on 2nd Street where I'm sure it's a lunch hour hit since white-collar FiDi workers love their salad bowls. Jamie W. suggested we try it one evening after a particularly stressful commute for me. The place has a pre-packaged modern look and was nearly empty as was usual at that hour on 2nd. I decided I was in no mood to study the abundant choices available for building a bowl and thought for my virginal visit, I would try one of their established menu choices.\n\nI went with the $11.90 Shroomami, a big bowl of organic wild rice, shredded kale, raw beets, bean sprouts, basil, roasted sesame tofu, a mix of chopped portobellos, and spicy sunflower seeds drenched in a miso sesame ginger dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/2qlMb1p). It was relatively adequate considering the creation added up to 640 calories at that steeper-than-usual price tag. I must remember \"seasonal\" doesn't translate into low-calorie. Jamie ordered the $12.80 Pesto Portobello, which was an exorbitant 775 calories of warm quinoa, organic arugula, hot chickpeas, raw corn, spicy broccoli, warm portobellos, and chunks of roasted chicken.\n\nIt was mixed liberally in a pesto vinaigrette and came with a crusty wedge of sourdough bread (photo: http://bit.ly/2pxF8EO). Yes, it was better than mine for sure but at what price? 775 calories is quite a lot for a meal portrayed as a simple bowl coupled with that price. For all that, I'd like a waiter in a uniform and a quartet of Gypsy violinists playing \"Fascination\". The one indisputable highlight was the refreshing $2.50 Cranberry Ginger Fresca which was sweetened only with honey (photo: http://bit.ly/2oMl6aB). Give it a try if you must but proceed with caution as the calorie count was higher than I was hoping and so were the prices for a simple supper. Go ahead and call me a tightwad.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...seasonal yes, some of it tasty but low-calorie no\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...like every other seasonal salad chain\nSERVICE - 2 stars...not very helpful really, they just look at you waiting\nTOTAL - 3 stars...it neither overwhelms or underwhelms, it just whelms...at least it's not Ovo", "author": "Ed U."}

I recommend coming in between 11:15AM-11:30AM to beat the lunch rush. I came right at 11:30 and I went straight to the front to order, but once 12 hit the line was out the door. \n\nI enjoy getting the curry cauliflower! For around 500 calories you get a meal that can last you throughout most of your workday. You can't go wrong with the arugula base, warm quinoa, roasted chicken, and curry flavor topped with heavy tahini sauce. YUM! I couldn't even finish my bowl. \n\nI will say that they could definitely add more chicken to the dish though since the pieces were cut so small and an additional $2 for more meat is a bit pricey especially with the cost of this dish already being between $13-$14 without any add-ons. While the meals do make you full, I don't really believe in paying that much for a salad so I probs won't come here on the daily when there are other options in SF to try at a cheaper price.\n\nAside from that, this location is quick considering its location right in FiDi and the service friendly even through the rush.

Luckily, for Yelp elite although I didn't attend the event was given a $15 promo code with the app to give it a try (thanks Yelp!)  In typical California style, I had just finished a sweaty afternoon session at FlyWheel and really needed a healthy AF salad to dig right into.  I quickly ordered a \"create your own\" through the Sweetgreen app and walked right over to pick up my order. \n\nThis new location is much larger than the one I used to frequent in Boston.  On a sunny Saturday afternoon around 1230 the place only had a few customers so I was able to walk right up to the counter for my order.  They hadn't finished it yet, which was actually nice because I was able to tell them to use light dressing and that I wanted to eat it there rather than take it to go (there is no option to choose dressing on side or light dressing with the app).  The staff was so friendly and helpful making sure they got my order correct.  I was able to grab a window seat with my salad and dig right now while using their FREE WIFI to browse the internet. \n\nThis 'make your own' salad I got was MASSIVE.  The thing was overflowing with fresh ingredients and even to the point where I couldn't finish it because it was so packed full.  Not sure why some people have said they thought it was a bit skimpy with the fillings because I got the hook up for sure.  I also paired it with the carrot-turmeric fresca drink that was so refreshing and tasty.  \n\nOne thing I love about sweetgreen is that it is all natural and you can really see what is going into your food.  When ordering through the app you can see the calorie count for your dish and the drinks have no sugar added (there is agave on the side if you want to sweeten it up a tad).  Sweetgreen is able to source from local farmers and highlight where their products are coming from on a menu board inside.

I was so glad I did. \n\nsweetgreen is really easy to get to by walking or public transit since it's close to Market St. I was a bit confused when I first got there since there's a sign at the front that said they don't take cash, and to use their app. Eh, wtf? Anyway, after getting over my mild initial surprise, downloading the app made it easy to order and pick up the food - there's a corner where you can pick up your meals to go, which is great if you're in a rush and just want to run in and out. \n\nThe meals they serve are (or at least seem) super-healthy - admittedly, healthier than what I usually eat, lol. I had the Pesto Portobello and my bf had the Warm Squash + Apple. Both meals were tasty, although he was still a bit hungry afterwards and was tired of eating kale. Maybe he should've gone with the Pesto Portobello too ;) The juice bar idea is great, but IMO didn't taste the greatest - maybe it's just the kind I had though.\n\nsweetgreen may be a tad more expensive than what you may expect, considering what you get, but can't argue with the convenience and healthiness of it.", "author": "Bianca C."}

Most bowls are healthy, and the place is run efficiently by a friendly staff.\n\nMost days I go for a custom bowl, but would also recommend the Shroomami and the Pesto Portobello for a fresh and filling meal.\n\nTip: download the app and order before going in.

Or you create your own. But really, their menu has tons of gourmet combo options, so I don't feel the need to customize. I got the Curry Cauliflower, and it was perfection: chicken, cauliflower, kale, raisins, cilantro dressing. They are pricey at about $12 a pop... but what isn't these days?

My sister in law got a promo code for $15 credit to use when you download the Sweetgreen app so she gave it to me.  The walk from my office was a bit of a trek, but at least I could order ahead with the app.  And good thing, because the line was super long when I went to pick up my order.\n\nI ordered the Warm Pesto Portobello bowl.  I kept the order as is.  It came with warm quinoa, roasted chicken, portobello mushroom, raw corn, hot chickpeas, spicy broccoli, pesto vinagrette and a slice of bread.  After tax it was just under $14.  Pricey indeed.  What I like about them though, they source locally and prep everything in house.  But, their site doesn't mention if they're organic?  I can't help but compare them to Mixt Greens which has a very similar concept, came first and also offers grain bowls as well.  I took my salad back to my office to indulge.  \n\nIt was a generous portion, but I remember being more full and satisfied with salads and grain bowls from Mixt Greens.  I was surprised that there was a decent amount of chicken.  I enjoyed the portobellos as well.  I think the chickpeas were not necessary and were oddly thrown in there.  The pesto vinaigrette was really light and they should have provided more for the large amount of food and just due to the ingredients, as it didn't coat much of the bowl.  But it was also a bit difficult to thoroughly mix it through everything in the bowl.  It would've been nice if it was a thicker pesto sauce vs. a vinaigrette too.  Their menu items sound good, so I'm not sure if I ordered the wrong dish, but for that much money, I'd rather go to Mixt Greens.  Plus the trek isn't as far either.  I don't think I'd return here, even to use the rest of the credit.", "author": "Cat C."}

Not usually a fan of arugula, but this salad really did it for me. Proportions were really skimpy, though. I'd say the extras (besides the leaves) would have made sense for half the amount of arugula leaves.

If you opt to make your own, you can choose 4 of the 24 standard toppings. They've also got a number of premium toppings if you want to add on-\n\nThe salads range from $12-$16 which is a bit pricey; however their commit to local produce and the quality of their ingredients makes this totally justifiable in my opinion.\n\nPro tip as I'm sure they're super busy during lunch - you can order ahead and your salad will be waiting for you when you come in :)", "author": "Elliott W."}

I don't usually just go for salads but the salad here was good and I could see myself coming back (definitely helped that they had chicken!). It's a little bit like Chipotle where you move down the offerings conveyor belt style, slowly adding to your ever-growing heaping bowl of salad. You'll walk away with a giant bowl of salad and that's a good thing- just because you're eating healthy doesn't mean you have to go hungry!\n\nThey have pre-made options for you to choose from on the menu and I went for the portabello chicken. The portabello mushroom was pretty good but I wished they had added more chicken to it. Beyond that, my only complaint is that the acoustics of sweetgreen made it hard to hear. I'm not completely sure what it was, but both my friend and I agreed that not only was it hard to hear the food worker who was taking our order but it was also hard to hear each other even though we were sitting at the same table. I think the acoustics of the room made it so that all the conversation echoed more than it normally should.", "author": "Philip W."}

I was one of the lucky people to experience sweetgreen during the early glory days in Philadelphia when the chain was emerging. Back then everything was better - the flavors, the quality of ingredients, the actual cafes, and the menu. I once ate sweetgreen for every meal it was that good! Now it's mediocre at best. The menu is more limited. The locations are messier and not run as well. Worst of all the flavors aren't as good or fresh. I've tried the steelhead a couple times and it's just SO FISHY gross. The cucumbers are shaved too thin and wilt and lose their satisfying crispness. The tomatoes were mushy and the red onions were sparse. They also have no problem charging extra for avocado and serving you\nSomething either over or under ripe- I've gotten both.

I have to admit, I was pretty impressed each time. Delicious dressings (in particular the Spicy Cashew), good toppings, fresh produce - all in all really solid salads. I also like the convenience of being able to order via their app. Not only does it allow me to take my sweet time to customize my order (I'm a very indecisive and picky eater), but I also get to bypass the long lunch line. The only downside is that they only toss in dressings for orders in person! Regardless, 5 stars for taste, convenience and customization. \n\nOn the other hand, I'm not so impressed by the portions and prices. While I know the average price for a salad in FiDi is $10-$15, other lunch spots serve much more generous portions. I really can't justify going to sweetgreen often because I feel a bit cheated. Case in point, I can get something similar to their Curry Cauliflower quinoa bowl at Eatsa for double the portion and half the price. Hence, 3 stars for portions and prices. \n\nDespite the higher prices and smaller portions, I'll probably still end up splurging here once a week. Their salads are too delicious for me to say no!", "author": "Cindy L."}

I liked the kale Caesar just fine but will try something different next time.\n\nMaybe more exploration of the menu would be helpful, but it was hard for us not to notice that the prices were ~2x more than Eatsa. Furthermore, at least one coworker doesn't think she'll be able to walk past Tava to come back.

I went at noon and the line wasn't so bad, though there were maybe 15-20 customers in front of us it took about 10 min to get to the front of the counter to start the order. \n\nFor my first time here I tried the Rad Thai Salad with light dressing. The portion was just enough that I was satisfied. For $14 (Agh so pricey!) I really expected a little bit more shrimp. The person making my salad gave me one scoop but I could buy a pound of shrimp at the grocery store for $10. \n\nThat being said, I did enjoy my salad. The citrus shrimp was slightly sweet and refreshing. You can choose light, medium, or heavy amounts of dressing. I'm glad I got \"light\" because it was dressed just right with everything coated without dressing pooling at the bottom. I liked all the ingredients, and the greens seemed fresh and crisp. I think you can ask for the dressing on the side if you're very particular.\n\nI understand they had just opened so I can understand why the person making my salad didn't know which ingredients the Rad Thai had. She was a little flustered (poor thing) and was asking her coworkers what went into it. I was willing to patiently wait, because it seemed stressful getting all the orders during the lunch rush. She was still helpful, as she assured me that they were getting more bean sprouts from the back (they had run out when it came time to build my salad).\n\nThey passed out samples while we waited in line. I tried a sample of the Caesar Salad. It was a somewhat unique dressing with a more refreshing lemony version of a typical caesar dressing, which I really enjoyed. \n\nMy coworker ordered the Spicy Sabzi Salad, which was too spicy for her to finish her salad. \n\nI'm definitely looking forward to coming back to try a warm bowl or maybe build my own salad.", "author": "Candice C."}

What a disappointment!  \n\nTo start, the ingredients didn't look anywhere near as appealing as other locations --\u00a0the chicken looked overcooked and dry, the steelhead was so overcooked in the pan that every piece the sides had started to curl, the roasted sweet potatoes simply unappetizing looking, the corn was white, etc etc...\n\nWhile I understand that when places first open, there are often kinks, but compromising on quality ingredients cooked well is a real no-no, especially on opening day!  It is freshness, attractiveness, and quality cutting, cooking, and maintaining of the ingredients which are core to the appeal of this business!  Plus, this is the Bay Area, home to many of where these ingredients are grown and only blocks from one of the premier farmers' markets on the planet.

He said it was buried underneath his salad.  Just because a restaurant is doing well doesn't mean that workers can or should take shortcuts around not pulling their hair back (both men & women) or think that hair in salads couldn't begin to hurt their business.

I don't see how the poor staff isn't deaf already. :(  \n\nAlso, I wish they would accept cash.

Say that 10X Lol) Let me tell a few things I love about that this place : 1) My lunches are already ready at the time that I select and I don't need to wait. It never fails. It's always ready! (I get lunch for me and my boss, sometimes for my team) 2) The salad selections are Ah-Mazing!  my favorites are: the Omega - spinach w/ Salmon & Avocado, Warm Squash Apple, Spicy Sabzi & the Carrot Tumeric Fresca! 3) you can tell that they only use fresh and organic ingredients 4) everything that I've had here taste super delicious 5)  it's 2 blocks away from my work 5) if you don't please pick it up in 30 mins, they'll throw it out and make you another one so it's fresh - especially if it's the Omega due to the salmon. I mean, throwing food is probably questionable but for them to make you a new one so it's fresh? How amazing is that?!! There's also someone by the pickup section looking out for people who need help finding their orders - which comes handy you can't find your lunch bag. The only downside that I can think of is probably the portion sizes. I mean, it's decent but compared to Proper Foods, SG is a little bit smaller. Overall though, I love this place! I come here 3X a week!! However, I will agree with some Yelpers that the portion could be a bit smaller than others. (i.e. Proper Foods, Mixt Greens etc.) BUT.. the taste and freshness of each bowl is INCREDIBLE! Also, if somehow you were not satisfied with your bowl (i.e. They forgot your dressing or skipped the chicken, just send an email to your online order and tell them what was wrong with your order. They will respond to you within the same day and give you a CREDIT $$. How amazing is that?!! I highly, highly recommend this for lunch (and dinner! I've picked up my dinners here a few times) If you're always busy like me and don't have time (and patience) to fall inline on workdays (mind you, the line is super long at lunch time) THEN, I recommend just order ahead of time, pick it up and eat outside especially if it's warm out. I go to Yerba Buena Gardens with my Omega bowl if it's sunny out!! Love Love Love Sweetgreen!", "author": "Anna Y."}

I don't know who would pay $10.00 off the top for a small amount of quinoa and limited toppings (all the good toppings you'd actually want such as cheese, avocado, tofu, chicken... basically any protein is like an extra $6-10 together. Why they don't include a protein in the basic price I'm not sure. It's not like they are using costly ingredients what's so ever. Overall I had trouble choosing ingredients that went well together and at the end my bowl tasted odd. I asked the guy working for some guidance and he wasn't sure what went nicely together either!

Depending on how important healthy eating is to you, this place may not be as appealing. For example, you will not find sodas, instead you will find various iced teas. The food tastes sooo good and so fresh. You can create your own salad or pick from their list of options (which includes info about calories). There's lots of options for meats as well as vegetarian protein sources, cheeses, rice/quinoa, beans, nuts, fruits. I also love the seasonal options so I always have variety. The service was great and the dish is made in front of you. There's an option for bread on the side if you wish. This place is perfect for me because it balances taste and good nutrition. Again, if you're looking for fries and soda, not the right place. It's not cheap, most salads are between 10-13 dollars, but the food is so fresh and delicious.", "author": "Rachel L."}

Just a couple of issues...\nMy cauliflower salad was overpowered by garlic, from the first bite to garlic breath hours later. ( I do like garlic, including \"40 cloves of garlic\" chicken, so I'm not garlic averse). The flavors need to be better balanced. They also need to provide toothpicks for those of us whose teeth are prone to retaining green bits. \nMy daughter had the rad Thai salad and enjoyed it. I thought it could be brightened up a bit with more lime. My spouse had the portobello mushroom bowl. He found it somewhat difficult to scrape the quinoa out of the bowl with the fork. But he liked the salad. \nSeating is ok, not great or particularly ample. Backs on chairs are uncomfortable if a person has thoracic spine issues. There is a seating area of backless tiered boxes for the young of spine. \nI'd eat here again but wouldn't choose the cauliflower salad again.", "author": "Patti H."}

Their new location in SOMA is bright, clean, spacious and modern.

I walked in and ordered the build your own bowl. The service was prompt and efficient. As I went to pull out my wallet, the nice woman helping and her coworker me told me it was free. In the land of $7 toast and lunches that cost at least $12, I was pleasantly surprised. Apparently their servers were down and since they don't accept cash, all meals were free.

Why it's so bad is because of the staff and how they work. When your creating your own salad many of the items are almost done and they give you the last sad looking pieces that's left and don't bother to go and get fresh new ones. I said I wanted tomatoes and I literally got three small cherry tomatoes. I also wanted quinoa in my salad and I could barley see that it was any of it in my bowl, my salad basically only existed of green leaves \"salad\". I really don't want to leave a bad review but this happened to me three times now and I tried to give this location a new chance hoping someone in the staff will do it better but non of them knows anything about customer service.
