I'm not surprised to see the long lines during the lunch hour.\n\nI got to try their spicy chicken sandwich at OutsideLands, and I've been in love ever since.  The spice on the chicken builds, but the coleslaw helps cool things down a bit.  Everything about that sandwich was perfect.\n\nI wanted to try their biscuit, but even going straight to their booth when the gates opened didn't help because they were out.  I got to try it a month ago during the lunch hour with their original chicken.  I thought it was okay.  The biscuit was a bit dry despite its buttery flavor.  And I think I just like the kick of their spicy chicken, so I missed that.\n\nOver the weekend, I was able to go there for brunch, and though I felt the same way about their biscuit sandwich, I believe you can't beat its price.  Their biscuit comes with tater tots only during breakfast.  So if you're there for the lunch hour, I'd just pay more for the sandwich.\n\nI also got to try an apple fritter, and for $1.50, you get 3, and that's just enough to satisfy that dessert craving some people have at the end of a meal.\n\nIt's communal seating, inside, and some tables outside.  There's also counter seating by the window.  Even though the line is long, I think it's worth the wait.  Their prices are really good, especially for Soma.", "author": "Vira P."}

And we event found a place to sit inside, which was a bonus.\n\nI was in town for work which means a lot of decadent eating. I love fried chicken but the idea of it on a sandwich felt a bit heavy. Luckily, you can get their amazing chicken on a salad, which was a perfect compromise. The salad comprised of romaine hearts and a baby kale mix, braised beets, spelt, celery and apple, and your choice of dressing. I went with ranch because HELLO FRIED CHICKEN AND RANCH IS AMAZING. And the chicken was perfectly breaded, seasoned, and juicy. Perfectly prepared. \n\nThe salad was great although I will say the super deep bowl made it kind of hard to get a good toss of the salad. In the future I'd probably take it to go and toss it and move it to a plate for the perfect ratio of all the toppings in each bite.\n\nSome of my teammates got the sandwiches and my God was I jealous. They looked amazing. Next time I'll just say eff it and indulge. But the salad is a great option if you want to TRY to be good.", "author": "Annette J."}

First of all, the hot wings are some of the spiciest, most delicious wings I've ever had, and I don't even like wings. Also, I've never even seen wings this large before! They must source their chickens from the UFC champion chicken farm - they're honestly triple the size of wings you would see at BWW. If I were to describe the mouth-watering chili rub that coats their hot wings, I would describe it in the crudest sense as a hybrid of maui onion rings and hot Cheetos, but that only scratches the surface of the depth of flavor. \n\nFor only $8, you get their fried chicken sandwich: a massive, juicy, tender chicken coated in their signature spicy berbere spice blend, mayo and pickles on a freshly baked bun. The bun is hefty and substantial, not dry or flaky. The celery and house-made apple slaw provide a refreshing, acidic contrast to the spicy burger. In addition, make sure to get the curly fries: they're well-seasoned, and an amazing portion for only $2.50. Finally, they have sparkling water on tap - how much better can this place get! \n\nSince coming back to the east coast for school, I've had Chik-fil-A's spicy chicken sandwich but it just doesn't hold a candle to The Bird.

The Fried chicken sandwich was very tender and I got the spicy version so it had a nice kick to it although I personally put a bit more hot sauce on it. The wings were also delicious and they literally give you a wing not your cruddy frozen wings but legit chicken wings. All of the chicken was juicy, tender, and packed with flavor.

It was close to where I was staying and I was hungry. \n\nTheir menu is very small, which is usually a great sign to me because it means the place can focus on doing a limited amount of things very well. That's exactly what they do here. Fried chicken sandwiches, fries, apple fritters. \n\nIt's easy to miss because there isn't a sign out front that says the bird. It's funny because there's a little sign of a fox eating a burger outside, rather than a bird. It's one of the most charming things about this place to me. \n\nYou order at the counter, seat yourself and wait for them to call you. It's not huge inside so there isn't a ton of seating. I've never had a hard time getting a seat but I've never come with a large group either. \n\nI've had their spicy and their regular fried chicken sandwiches. The spicy is my go to and it is delicious. The chicken is always cooked perfectly, but it's still moist and juicy. The breading has Chinese five spice, which gives it a complex, warm flavor that I think really works. There are pickles and an amazing red cabbage, celery slaw on it. The slaw doesn't have mayo, so it adds texture and a fresh crispness without being heavy or overpowering. \n\nThey also have perfectly seasoned and crisp curly fries, which you can order plain or fully loaded (ie sour cream, bacon bits, scallions). I've had them both ways and frankly they're better plain because they're so well seasoned they're perfect solo. They also have house made sriracha, which is better than the brand if you ask me. \n\nIf you order a meal, it comes with a sandwich, fries and a beer for around $13, which is an incredible deal for the quality. The beer is served in a Bird cozy, which you get to keep. So fun!\n\nI also tried the apple fritters tonight for the first time. They looked a little dry to me but when I bit into them, they were so moist inside with fresh, still crisp bites of apple, perfect amount of cinnamon.

The salad was layered with lettuce on the bottom, beets, celery and apple in the middle then topped with regular fried chicken. Top it with their vinaigrette, so tasty! \n\nI'm a huge french fry lover and theirs were great. Highly recommend getting an order of their fries and dipping them in their homemade sriracha sauce!

I actually had a horrible first experience here, but after taking that bite out of the sandwich, everything bad that happened was forgiven. \n\nThere wasn't an evident sign of \"The Bird\" when walking on the streets, but once you peek inside at the menu and notice the menu and the d\u00e9cor, you'll know where you are. There was a line almost toward the end of the block when I went here the first time, but it does move quickly. Once I was at the front (about 10 minute wait), I made my order. I stepped aside after I paid, waiting for them to call my name with my food. As I was waiting, another customer was getting ketchup, and just my luck, she drops the ketchup and it splattered, some landing on various spots of my clothing - pants, shirt, outer layer, etc. I wiped as much as I was able to, and then another customer told me that there was some on my back too. WOW!!! I was so lucky not to have any meetings after lunch, but it was quite annoying. Anyways, my name was called shortly afterwards (spent more time waiting in line than waiting for my food) and walked back to work to enjoy the sandwich. YUM!!! Amazing! \n\nThe chicken was still crunchy, and the rub/flavorings were very on point. I normally do not like slaw, but the slaw they used went so well with the whole sandwich. The piece of chicken was decently sized - none of that bun is bigger than the piece of meat BS. I think the sandwich would have tasted better and held more of the crunch if I ate it right after receiving it, but I was not disappointed by the flavor. Semi-spicy, great crunch/texture, full of awesomeness. \n\nI went back here a couple more times, and had a much better experience - no ketchup or other condiments landed on me, and even tried their curly fries. Those were great too. Super impressed by the d\u00e9cor, the food, and how quickly the line moves.", "author": "Rita W."}

The Apple slaw and burger consistency varied in these two visits. Some burgers had less some more. Some chicken thighs are juicy and plump, some are short and stubby so lesser portions. The 2nd visit: one of the bottom buns was legit torn. They are lucky I didnt give a shit that day. \n\nIf this sandwich was priced at $4 I may be more willing to give it 4 stars. What keeps it from being 5 stars if you fix all the issues with the consistency of The Bird is if they provided their meal without beers and instead allowed soda to be subbed in at a lower price.\n\nAll in all, it's OK. It's a good, yet inconsistently done overpriced chicken sandwich.\n\nWord of advice: everyone gets it spicy. I gather it's because of the unique taste...", "author": "Michael L."}

Having been in the area years before, I was stoked to find a new spot to try.  Fried chicken??? Say no more, I'm there!  \n\nLet me say this, I've been here twice in the past week alone both due to convenience as it's only a 5 minute walk from the office, but also because their fried chicken sandwich is that darn good.  Yep, if you get here anytime after 12:00 PM, the line most likely will be out the door, but it does move fairly quickly.  \n\nThe menu is fairly simple as the most popular item is the fried chicken sandwich (the combo comes with beer and curly fries).  They have either the classic or spicy option (if you want a subtle kick).  They definitely give you your money's worth here as they stuff a huge piece of scrumptious, delicious chicken with some slaw.  It has just the right amount of seasoning and your last bite is as tender as the first.  \n\nTables can be hard to come by during lunch rush hour but wait a few minutes and one is bound to open up.

With all of the uber healthy food options near the office in San Francisco, it feels good to (occasionally) be bad and enjoy some\nfried chicken. This is a tiny, popular comfort food joint in the Financial District--expect a line during the lunch hour (it's worth it).\n\nWe waited in line for about 10-15 minutes and ordered at the counter. The menu is pretty simple, mostly fried chicken sammies, a salad, and fries. I ordered a salad with a half order of hot chicken on it--while the salad was tasty and refreshing, I honestly could've just eaten the hot chicken sans veggies. The chicken is super flavorful and pretty spicy! It was a work day and we weren't drinking until later, but I could see this fried chicken pairing *very* nicely with a can of cold beer (of which they have many). \n\nSnag a table inside if you can or take your meal to go.

The chicken is great for a couple reasons: 1. they use fancy chicken of some kind and it tastes better than Foster Farms. 2. they use chicken thighs instead of breast and it's way jucier, trimmed of fat, lightly breaded, and served with or without a spicy batter.  The sandwich also comes with a crisp cole slaw and pickles (I think).\n\nI've also had the fully loaded fries (best in recent memory), curly with cheese sauce, bacon bits, and sour cream + chives and I can't go there an not get them now.\n\nAdditionally, I've tried the chicken wings and they impressed me they serve it with the claw still attached!  They are fantastic and they're the really big ones so you don't have to order that many, maybe like 3 and you'll be good, especially if you get some fries.\nThey have some good and reasonably priced beers that they even serve with a beer cozy, woot! :D\n\nThe sandwich is inexpensive (to me, at least), at $8 and the fries something like $4 but they have a \"Happy Meal\" which gives you both those items and a beer for $12.  \n\nService is incredibly quick and they're friendly and on top of it.  You just order at the counter and find a seat until they call your name.  This is a great place to get quick bite to eat on your lunch or get something to go, even.\n\n Finally, some smaller touches that really made the experience for me were the housemade ranch, blue cheese, and even an awesome siracha sauce.

The spices they use forms a kind of crust on the skin.\nThere is a nice picture of the wings already. You can see that you get a full wing, not just one segment. They are $2.50 ea, 3 for $7, or $2 ea. during happy hour (4-7, M-F).\nAll their beers are in cans. One guy in our crew prefers bottles and wished that they had a better selection on their \"top shelf\". The rest of us could find a suitable beverage from the choices available.\nStill 5 stars!", "author": "Marvin M."}

I stopped in for a late lunch after the recommendations from a few friends that had recently visited the area. I'm so glad I listened, this place is awesome!\nFor starters, it's tucked away in a little nondescript storefront, so definitely pay attention while walking down the street.  The menu is simple- chicken sandwiches of varying spice levels, fries, and beer. I went with the spicy chicken sandwich and the loaded fries.  This sandwich made me forget about all other chicken sandwiches.  Here's why: \n1. The chicken. A perfectly cooked piece of white meat that took over the whole bun. I got the spicy, but don't be deterred if you're not a spice person.  This is more flavor than heat.\n2. The slaw. Disclaimer: \"coleslaw\" is by far my least favorite word.  It just sounds so weird.  But this housemade slaw made me forget all about my aversion to the word.  This is not the soggy mess you'd find at your family cookout.  This is crisp, flavorful slaw that compliments the flavor of the chicken.\n3. The pickles. Also made in house, also not your average wobbly afterthought thrown on your bun.  These are crisp, and slightly sweet.\nAll in all, I'm positive the sandwich was created to make my day.  Mission accomplished!", "author": "Shawniece H."}

The vegetables complemented the chicken well, and the bun was nice and warm. I thought it was a bit too salty, however, and my friend who got the spicy chicken sandwich thought that hers was wayyy too salty. Curly fries are flavorful and a perfect level of crispy/mealiness.

Here's the breakdown:\n\n-Came on a Wednesday at around 1pm. Decent sized line, but moved relatively quickly--especially after you order. Everyone got their food at the cashier or within the time it took them to get soda/water. A+ on efficiency. \n\n-Got the spicy chicken sandwich w/ curly fries. The chicken was moist, juicy, and seasoned nicely. I'd totally eat two in one sitting if I could. Curly fries are average. Nothing to praise or complain about. Can't usually go wrong with curly fries. \n\n-Housemade sriracha: So I'm not sure what the sauce actually consists of, but to me, it seems to be a mixture of chili sauce (sambal) and something else. Doesn't seem like there is any trace of actual sriracha in it (and I down that stuff like water, so I'm familiar with the taste), but perhaps it's in there with something else that's dulling the flavors. It's not as spicy or concentrated as plain sambal, so mild spice lovers can probably also enjoy! \nThey offer this in prepackaged dipping containers on the side where you pick up your food. Used it for the curly fries (they don't have mustard), coworker used it in his regular chicken sandwich. Honestly I could pass on this, but nice concept. \n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back. They manage the line well (although 95% of people order the same thing and they're just constantly making those staples in an assembly line) and the food is great. Price is also good compared to other FiDi eats. Got the sandwich and fries for $11 and change after tax (sandwich: $8, fries $2.5).", "author": "Jessica J."}

The Bird's industrial but homey interior demonstrates excellence but authenticity at the same time, and that's how I would sum up this entire place.

It's clear they went for quality over quantity -- do not mistake it's sparse menu for lack of\nculinary expertise. The spicy fried chicken hits top marks in every category: crispy, juicy, and flavorful. The craggy crust of the fried chicken is the perfect terrain for that tangy spicy sauce to deliciously adhere to. No doubt, with flavor this banging, expect the line to be swanging (around the block). Avoid rush hour times for best experience, especially if you want a seat.\n\nPro tip: sneak the honey from the tea bar into a ketchup  cup and drizzle that goodness over your sandwich for some real Southern lovin'.

The interior looked very indie and casual filled with country-style and industrial designs across the whole room.\n\nThe employees here are doing a great job for making the customers like me a remarkable and fast-friendly service! No cons!\n\nNow onto the food! As of 3 pm before closing its doors, I ordered the original fried chicken sandwich (without pickles) and a side of curly seasoned fries. As I ate it, that chicken sandwich is da bomb! Perfectly baked and deep-fried for perfection all thanks to natural spices and seasonings. The chicken cooked beautifully and ripe as I ate it entirely! The homemade cole slaw inside the chicken sandwich also tasted magnificent which I didn't feel and tasted unwanted artificial ingredients inside! On the other hand, the curly fries tasted amazing! Beautifully curly and crunchy for that fries! What a great lunch meal after all!\n\nParking at The Bird can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface metered street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. Alternatively, you can ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nAll in all, The Bird is the most sensational and enormous local fast food chicken sandwich restaurant that I've ever visited for the first time right here in San Francisco's Financial District neighborhood!

They also offer combos that come with beer as well as discounts during happy hour (I believe ends at 6pm?) \n\nThe line may be out the door but the line usually moves quickly, and honestly, if you're here at the right time, it's the perfect place for a quick meal. \n\nAlso, this is not on the menu and sits right by where the food orders are picked up: HOMEMADE SRIRACHA. Get it now. Goes amazing well with their curly fries. I love my homemade sauces. I'm not usually a sriracha fan, but man, do I love the flavor of this homemade sauce. \n\nI know some folks highlighted that there may be inconsistencies. The only inconsistencies that I've noticed is around the spice level. But I love spicy food, and it's actually a treat when my chicken sandwich is spicier than usual (and I guess a slight disappointment when its not as spicy, but my stomach probably appreciates that). \n\nSide note, my boyfriend and I are obsessed with fried chicken sandwiches, and every city we visit, we find and try their \"best\" chicken sandwich. Each city builds their fried chicken sandwich differently. Our favorites are in LA (Birdies) and Chicago (Chicken Farm and Shop), but this place in SF definitely belongs in the top 5.", "author": "Teresa C."}

Fight or flight- I choose to fight and take my ass to the end of the line.  My inner party-pooper, flipping THE BIRD at my inner-cheerleader because she somehow convinced me that we need to try this fried chicken sandwich.

Why not make it work my while?)\n\nCashier lady: Spicy or regular?\n\nMe: Regular (I want to taste the fried chicken for what it is)\n\nCashier lady:  Any curly fries or any other sides? \n\nMe:  No.  ( Nah, I already know what curly fries taste like, and I don't need it.  Plus, I'm on a diet. *Snort LOL*)\n\nCashier lady:  Anything to drink? \n\nMe:  (Perhaps a diet soda to keep things light??) No, thanks.  Just the sandwich.\n\nPaid the nice lady and my order was already ready to go.  Took my lunch in a brown paper bag and trekked my way back to work.  I figured that my meal was going to be wet and soggy by the time I arrived, but surprisingly, it was not; and  It smelled SO good.  Took a bite of the chicken and it was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  There are vultures that I work with that can sniff and spot good food from afar.  So I take my lunch with me to the rooftop patio to hide out for a while.  \n\nI'm glad I did because this was something that I did not want to share.  Have you ever eaten something that was SO good that you could cry??  I was having one of those moments.  I don't even like dark meat chicken, but this was way too good.  The slaw of red cabbage, celery and onion, and apple had a nice crisp to it. I loved the hint of sweetness the apples did for the sandwich as a whole.

There is ample seating, and it's I z great lunch location for those who work in or near Fidi. The only gripe i have is that the chicken tends to be a bit oily and makes my stomach feel heavy. I'm used to friend chicken sandwiches made mostly with white meat, but I do believe they use white and dark meat such as thighs, and   like I said, it felt heavy in my stomach. I also was too crazy about the seasonings. But that could very much be a personal preference. Otherwise, the location good, staff and service were great, and the presentation is excellent. I tried it twice to make sure I was giving them a fair shake. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, regular the first time, and spicy the next time. The fries were good. My coworker ordered the loaded fries and they looked bomb. They also had other things to do the menu such as dessert and getting the chicken on  a salad. \nMy recommendation is to give this place a try for lunch.

Their curly fries and great selection of beers were an added bonus. The food service is super speedy. As soon as I walked away from the cash register my meal was ready for me! One thing to note is to make sure you are aware of the specials. I ordered a chicken sandwich with curly fries and a beer.

I only knew it was a restaurant because I yelped it before going.  The interior has an industrial feel with high tables and a huge sign that says 'Beer' behind the main cash counter. The music here is insanely awesome if you love rap 11/10.

The piece of chicken was well cooked, seasoned and very flavourful. The chicken was paired with great toppings ( cabbage, pickles etc) and the bun was very soft and fresh too. Since it is a big burger, it takes a few bites to get the full flavour which is super 8/10. The fries were good but not the best I've had as they were not as crisp as they looked 5/10. They were however seasoned well. \n\nThe staff is extremely friendly and great to talk to and this place has good food, value for money and ambience.

They know it on a whole 'nother level than us mere mortals.\n\nI first heard of this place after reading online that LeBron ordered a bunch of sandwiches here while in the area. I've then come to know this place due to its ridiculously long line going down the block during the peak lunch hours. As such, I came here with a friend on the day before Thanksgiving at around 11:45am with the hope that not many people would still be in the area. The line was still going out the door at that time, but the wait was actually quite short.\n\nI decided to get their spicy chicken sandwich and we split an order of their curly fries. We ended up going off to an office area to sit down since the place doesn't have lots of seating especially considering their popularity. The curly fries are pretty standard and come hot which is nice. The spicy chicken sandwich was a definite 5/5 experience though! The buttermilk buns had a nice buttery flavor to them with a slight crisp at the inner cross section. The pickles and coleslaw added a splendid crunch and acidity to the masterpiece. The fried chicken is really blew me away with how flavorful and juicy it was. The batter was fried oh so right to create a splendid discernible crisp without being too thick or too thin. The meat was just so ridiculously juicy in a way that other fried chickens aren't even comparable to!\n\nFor a delicious fried chicken sandwich in the San Francisco area, I would recommend none other than The Bird!", "author": "Joshua M."}

Not really sure how they keep churning out their food so fast, but I literally got my food in under a minute after ordering at the cashier station.\n\nThe first time, I got their fried chicken sandwich, and the second time, I got their loaded curly fries and naked bird. The chicken sandwich is a piece of fried chicken drenched in delicious sauce, topped with various vegetables, and wedged between two soft buns. The naked bird is basically the bunless and vegetable-less variant of the chicken sandwich (sans bun and vegetables), and almost resembles a finger food and totally would be if it weren't for how saucy the meat is. The loaded curly fries are their basic curly fries with extra toppings of cheese, scallions, bacon, and ranch(?). \n\nOverall everything was really tasty; I especially liked how saucy the fried chicken was, though if I were to go again, I'd probably go with the sandwich, rather than just the naked bird, since it's more of a full-package kind of lunch, which to me is not only more filling, but also more satisfying. While the loaded curly fries were delicious, I'm not sure it's worth the extra money for the toppings, especially since there aren't that many curly fries to begin with.

SO WORTH IT!!!! \n\nThe happier meal is a fried chicken sandwich (spicy or regular), curly fries, and a beer for 12.50!!!! We wanted soda instead beer and they were happy to make that change at no cost. \n\nThe food came out literally 2 minutes after we paid. We were so surprised that it came out SO FAST. It was crazy. There were lots of seats around 11/12ish considering the small space and we found seats easily. And the food was BOMB. Super crispy and juicy. The fries were normal. The soda was extra cold and crispy. Sauce on the sandwich was gooood. Loved it. It was a regular/decent portion.

Add in the fact that it's from the same folks as Super Duper, which is one of my favorite burger joints around?  I mean, all of that just meant it was only a matter of how soon I could make it here...and when I'd come back again!**\n\nLike Super Duper, The Bird's menu doesn't offer up much in the way of variety (in fact, it's even narrower).  At the same time though, there's no need to offer up much else when you do something so well!  Especially in this part of SoMa/Financial District, where it means being able to do something both well AND fast to get the working crowds in and out fast.  Of course, not that you'd be coming here for anything other than fried chicken anyways...ha!\n\n-- FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH...$8\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-bird-san-francisco-2?select=BjyPtSj99u-Xb6VBGdLRNg)\nTalk about a mouth full - this was HUGE!  I opted for their classic version (instead of spicy) and it was great.  The breading was crispy yet not super thick and the chicken itself was super juicy.  What's more, the bun was so soft and the pickles' acidity added a nice contrast.  I could've done with less of the slaw, but just because it had cilantro in it (blech).\n\n-- CURLY FRIES...$2.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-bird-san-francisco-2?select=zeoznnVqn2rPv7y4T2Bz0w)\nGiven the price, the portion obviously isn't huge, but it's still well worth the money, even if you needed to double your order!  The fries were cooked up to a really nice crispness and are very well seasoned (not salty though).  What's more, they weren't super heavy or greasy either.  Yum!\n\nBeyond how good the food is, the staff here is great!  Not only are they all really friendly, but they're fast and efficient too.  Both times I've been here, there have been lines to get to the register.  However, after ordering, I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for my food to be ready.  All in all?  In and out in about 15 minutes or so, if that, which is great when you're looking for something quick and tasty on the go (they do have a bunch of tables inside and out if you want to stay and eat, though).\n\nOverall, FOUR AND A HALF STARS if I could, but I rounded down (for now) if only because of the slaw.  Which, I realize, I'll just ask for less of next time...which will be sooner rather than later!\n\n**Five days, and only because there was a weekend in between.", "author": "Mike L."}

Around town folks are happily lining up around buildings for that perfect sandwich. The first bay area fad was Bakesale Betty's style sandwiches. Suddenly the new preference is Nashville style hot chicken. Unless restaurant owners are descendants of Prince's Hot Chicken in Nashville, they're going to have a difficult time replicating that country spice. \n\nIMO The Bird is a little over-hyped. Menu options are straight forward and simple which I appreciate. You can have your chicken naked, in a salad or between lots of carbs! Kudos on the  tall Miller hi-life cans (The most underappreciated beer on the market).  \n\nThe focal point is the chicken and I wasn't impressed. For the steady stream of customers, I was a little surprised my meal was not piping hot. The process from chicken fry to sauce dipping is clearly off and easily repairable. On the chili scale I was expecting the sandwich to be a little more spicier. The hot style seemed more sweet to me (Maybe I visited on a sweeter night, who knows). The vinegar based coleslaw was a little overwhelming. When a salad sits in vinegar for too long it almost doesn't taste like anything else.", "author": "Ralph A."}

None of the dried out, tough chicken breast that restaurants give you, none of the soggy and spongy breading you get with takeout that steams in its own container. I was absolutely stoked to try this place when it first appeared on Yelpers' radars earlier this year, and even more excited that it lived up to the hype.\n\nIs the line worth the wait? Knowing how long lines get around here on a weekday at 12:30 pm, maybe not. When I was here at 3 pm, the line was already touching the threshold. Considering the food is fried fresh (you can't mistake the steam that rises from your first bite, so give it a minute or two to cool), the line can only move so fast. There's very little seating, so it gets crowded in there fast. But once you get your food, that's when the real fun starts.\n\nImagine a beautiful, large chicken cutlet, juices flowing, a soft bun, crunchy breading, tangy apple slaw, and just enough mayo to glue the sandwich together. I'd say that crisp is actually the theme of the sandwich, actually. Between the mouthfeel of fresh celery, apples, onions, red cabbage, and that dang breading (seriously, I could go on forever about how I want to make my fried chicken this good), and the taste of everything coming together, the food's got a real punch to it. I've never had a chicken sandwich this good before. \n\nThe focus is clearly on the quality of the food here, given the limited menu and rave reviews. There's few other items in the way of breakfast and post-meal accompaniments. They now offer their chicken biscuits all day, according to their changeable marquee sign. You can also get a midday beer or a hot ice cream sandwich (which appears to be warm, slightly sweet buns sandwiching ice cream and sugary toppings).\n\nIt's really a quaint and wonderful shop, and I'd recommend this to both locals and tourists grubbing for good food.

The perfectly crispy chicken, the crunch of the slaw, the creaminess of the mayonnaise (had no idea there was mayo on the first go around thanks to \"you know who\"), there were pickles, and if you're paying attention, you'll notice the celery expands the chicken sandwich by a full dimension. \n\nI will describe this chicken sandwich as \"sexy\". Don't think too hard about what this means. You know what sexy is. \n\nI ordered one sandwich and ate it slowly, controlled.  Then I got up and ordered a second sandwich and ate that one the way I wanted to - I scarfed that one, licked my fingers, bit my tongue, just got savage about it, like a zombie eating a brain (don't over think it). It felt good. This sandwich makes biting your own tongue feel good.", "author": "Danielle O."}

The Bird gets super busy during the lunch hour rush but don't worry, the line moves super fast. You'll have your fried chicken sandwich in a matter of minutes! \n\nI ordered the spicy fried chicken sandwich and curly fries. Now this isn't just your ordinary fried chicken sandwich (most fast food places focus on quantity not quality). You get a explosion of flavors in here with the crisp pickles, slaw, and celery. They give your sandwich a perfect balance of crunch. Plus you need it to soak up all the fat from that chicken. It's not very spicy but I'm a kind of guy that can take a lot of heat. It had a light kick to it which adds to the overall flavor. Man, just thinking about it makes me want to order one now. The curly fries were definitely good. If you're looking for more, get them loaded. I tapped out after that sandwich so unless you come with a big appetite, share the fries with a friend. \n\nFor an even better time, order the happier meal (it includes beer).

There was a full crowd and lots of people dropping by with cameras.  Our order:\n\nFried Chicken Sandwich - $8.  Great fried chicken....probably double fried but very juicy and crispy on the outside.  I'm a little mixed on the slaw as it's a bit on the sour side with the pickles and the mix of celery, carrots, and cabbage don't really enhance the chicken sandwich for me.  I'd opt for naked next time.  I also think $8 is a bit on the high side for a chicken sandwich, but it is solid.  Didn't love the buns which are plain and forgettable.\n\nChicken Biscuit - $4.5.  They don't serve any other biscuit after breakfast so this smaller sandwich was our only choice.  I'd think the biscuit would be a killer combo, but the biscuit was dry and overcooked (was it left from breakfast) and the smaller chicken piece was too fried and both hard and dry.  Very disappointing.  \n\nFully Loaded Fries - $3.75.  The curly fries are covered with cheese and bacon.  Good and it's hard to not like something covered in cheese and bacon.  \n\nIce cream sandwich - $4.  They serve scoops of ice cream in the buns above that I didn't care for and I didn't like them for the ice cream sandwich either.  Yes, they include nuts and a warm chocolate sauce, but can you believe no one at the table wanted to finish this.  Yeah, that's not a stellar ice cream sandwich.\n\nOverall, a nice stop but more notable for the great fried chicken in the main sandwich.  I didn't like the slaw and would opt for naked as well as skip the other menu items.\n\nThe Bird accepts credit cards, including Amex.", "author": "Randy F."}

The sandwiches here are good but it's been changed/hipsterized just enough if you're expecting comfort simple classics it's not what you're going to get. \nOn my visit got the spicy chicken sandwich, loaded fries, and wings. \nThe chicken sandwich was good, the meat was well cooked still moist and juicy. I like that they use thigh instead of beast which makes it more flavorful. It's served on a brioche bun and topped with pickles and apple slaw. IMO it wasn't that spicy, they use a spice rub based sauce that has a hint of heat and a fair amount of sweet. While I enjoyed it I still would have preferred a simple chicken sandwich dipped in hot sauce served on a potato roll bun like I'm used to back east, but for SF I'll take what I can get.\nThe wings were at best meh, they were large but really didn't have much flavor. The spice rub sauce was too sweet with no heat. Skip the wings and stick to the sandwich which is what they are good at. \nThe loaded fries were a pleasant surprise, it's a bed of crispy curly fries topped with cream, nacho cheese, bacon, and scallions. It's simple stadium food but it was really well done and I liked it a lot. \nThis place at peak hours has a line but they seem to be pretty fast and efficient. I'd recommend coming a little bit after the lunch rush to avoid the lines.

I really enjoy spicy food, so the heat was no problem, though my friend, who doesn't take spicy food as well, was sweating a bit. The outside of the chicken had a decent crunch as well. The piece of chicken is a good size, not a small dinky patty like the one at chick fil-a. The coleslaw and pickles were strong compliments to the chicken. \n\nThe curly fries were good, but pretty standard.\n\nIn my opinion this place is better than Howlin Rays in LA, which has a bit too much hype.

A few small tables indoors but don't count on sitting and dining in.\n\nTo cut back on the carbs and food coma, I had the salad with a whole order of spicy fried chicken. It was great quality and cooked perfectly juicy, tender but slightly springy, flavorful, on the inside, absolutely perfect texture. At the same time the breading was light and crispy. Definitely not like a Southern style extra floury breading a la Popeye's (my favorite) but like a fancy interpolation between chicken katsu and Chick fil A. The blend of spices was delicious and flavorful but didn't bring much heat. I also ate some curly fries, which were somewhat limp and reminded me of a less greasy Jack in the Box. $8 for a big fried chicken sandwich is a great deal for the heart of SF.

The chicken was so good by itself, you didn't really need to dress it up with much else. \n\nCurly fries were on point. \n\nNext time I'm having The Happier Meal, which is all of the above plus a beer for $12.5.", "author": "Jeannette N."}

I probably should have gotten the regular chicken sandwich so I could get a baseline of how the chicken tasted, but I didn't. The chicken was all one big breast piece and the breading was nice and crisp. It was pretty spicy, the apple coleslaw really helped mellow out the spice. I also needed a couple of cups of water. The curly fries were great as well, not mushy at all. It came out to around $11 + tip, which is a pretty good price for the area.", "author": "Gretchen T."}

It's such a simple and good idea I'm surprised someone didn't think of it sooner. Fried chicken alone is amazing, but eating the lightness of the apple slaw paired with the hearty fried chicken is a match made in heaven. This chicken manages to be juicy and tender on the inside, crispy on the outside, and flavorful through and through. It is a hefty burger and it's incredibly filling.

They've tried to bring me twice now, only to be stopped by the reasonably limited open hours (opens at 9:00AM on Saturday, and is closed on Sundays). Finally, though, I was able to taste what my dad described as \"the best chicken sandwich he had ever had\". \n\nThe restaurant feels clean. Despite how busy it is, you can tell the staff takes time to keep the place tidy. The menu is simple, making it an efficient ordering process. I decided on the spicy chicken sandwich, with my dad going for the original chicken sandwich and my mother opting for salad with chicken added on. \n\nThat first bite was everything. I was Remy from Rataouille with music playing in the background and the flavors of the chicken manifesting as swirling colors around me. \n\nActually though, the chicken was super juicy, the breading perfect in terms of ratio as well as seasoning. I could definitely taste the spice, but not so much that it overpowered the other flavors in the sandwich. The sweetness of the apple slaw and the tartness of the pickles really balanced the flavors of the chicken and the bun. The bun felt smaller than a normal bun, which was perfect, since I tend to find the amount of bread in a normal burger a little overwhelming. \n\nAll in all, a perfect sandwich for a perfect price. I'll definitely be back again.", "author": "Waverly R."}

Needless to say, I've been unsuccessful, but The Bird is just that memorable!  \n\nI've had both the regular and spicy sandwiches, and I definitely prefer the spicy.  The regular was more peppery spicy, and spicy one has a different type of spice, more like a hot sauce type spicy.  It depends what you're looking for.  You choose what sandwich you want, type of fries, and a drink for $12.50.  Super reasonable, and for this reason I'd always recommend the \"happier meal.\"  You also get a drink cozy for your beverage - BONUS! I've never tried the \"fully loaded\" fries, because all that heaviness just seems like too much for my stomach after a fried chicken sandwich.  \nEach sandwich comes with coleslaw and pickles, which in my opinion, just makes the sandwich even more awesome.  If all of that doesn't tickle your fancy though, you can opt for a \"naked bird\", which is just as good.  Beware, the spicy chicken sandwich is quite drippy, so if you're not looking to get too messy, I'd rethink things unless you're a careful eater.  The mess is totally worth it, though.  I'm not lying.\n\nI can't explain it - the chicken is perfectly fried and SO fresh and juicy!  The spice just tops it off.  The curly fries are also perfectly fried and seasoned.  \n\nThe only thing I would change about this sweet spot?  There are no gluten-free options, other than salad.  Boo.  \n\nThis last time, I had something to do in the area and my wife asked me to bring The Bird home for lunch.  The line was long, but don't be discouraged, it moves quickly and again, is very much worth it.  We were joking about how now that I'll be working in the area we'll need to create a limit for how many chicken sandwiches we can eat in a week.

I can't recall how I found this place, but after falling in love with Bakesale Betty's in Oakland I just knew we had to try this place. We got lucky with parking literally right in front of the shop, but don't plan on finding parking in this part of SF. We walked back and forth in front of it a couple times like idiots because it doesn't say \"The Bird\" anywhere outside so just know - you're looking for a sign with a FOX. \n\nWe got two of the standard sandwiches and the fries. I love places where they have a limited menu - you know what this place is about. They also advertised a special that included the sandwich and a beer for $12.50 which, in the city, is a total steal. \n\nThe sandwiches themselves were delicious - the slaw is flavorful and fresh which pairs nicely with a heavy fried chicken. We tried both the spicy and the regular and both were juicy, tender, and crispy, if a tinge on the greasy side. The sauce and bread are bomb too. I could take or leave the fries - they're tasty and the bacon is actual bacon, not bacon \"bits\" - but are pretty standard topped fries. The sandwich itself is different from Bakesale - it's more on the complex side flavor wise, but is still BOMB.\n\nI can't wait to go back.", "author": "Kim B."}

I'm a big believer that when offered a spicy option, there should be zero confusion about if you got the right one--I want my mouth to burn a little bit!

The chicken biscuit and chicken sandwich are all anchored by the really well executed fried chicken. Generously portioned and flawlessly crisp, the sandwiches are delicious.\n\nThe chicken biscuit which is $4.5 is I believe 1/2 of the chicken of a regular sandwich and come between a flaky biscuit (soft, fluffy). I requested the spicy chicken and it was a very mild spicy.\n\nThe regular sandwich came with cole slaw and pickles. It was all very tasty and very agreeable to the wallet.\n\nThe apple fritters were okay - nothing to write home about - seems to be the same base batter as the biscuit, but I wouldn't go out of my way to order these.", "author": "Madison W."}

Have a small menu and absolutely crush the two or three things that you do.  Don't have eight sandwiches.  Have One and make it Original or Spicy.  Brilliant.  Take a page out of this playbook if you are thinking of getting into the game.\n\nA good chicken sandwich is hard to beat.  What are the keys?  Good Chicken.  Make it a nice, substantial, juicy piece.  Does it just melt in your mouth?  Yep.  Is Chicken the main ingredient in the sandwich?  You betcha.  How is the flavor?  Awesome.  Right on track.  Breading?  Just adds to the Flavor and Texture.  Flavor?  Flavorful.  How Flavorful?  Very.  What about the Spicy Version?  Makes the Chicken pop, blends with the breading, and sets of the rest of the favors.  Winning.  I will add that the Relish, Sliced Pickles and Mayo are the perfect topping.  If I had to knock this place down to a 4.85 or so, it would only be because they should use a slightly bigger roll for the sandwich.  They do a nice job dealing with the fact that the sandwich falls apart while eating it by wrapping it in paper that sorta acts as Chicken Sandwich Spanx (much like the In-N-Out wrapper being Double-Double Spanx).  I think they get the balance right, but I would be fine with more bun.  That said, I know there are a lot of non-Viking-like people for whom another 50-75 calories (carbs too) aren't a draw.  If you know what to do going in, you can manage it.  I recommend getting a fork while you pick up your food.  \n\nI am a fan.  I recently tried their Fully Loaded Curly Fries (you can also just have regular curly fries).  For $3.75 they were well worth it.  I was working nearby on a Saturday - I think the Chicken Sandwich alone is plenty for lunch.  I have not tried their Chicken Wings, the last piece of the puzzle.  They also have a nice Bottle/Can Beer selection.  I've noticed that they have a Sandwich/Fries/Beer special for around $12 which is a heck of a bargain.  I've only gone on workdays.  \n\nThis was a terrific addition to New Montgomery.  The Melt was in this spot before and it was a spot I only really went because it was open on a Saturday..

I want to try their chicken biscuit sandwich, The Bird, can you extend breakfast hours until 11:30 or 12?  \n\nI had plans to meet my friend here for lunch last week but some work kept me over our meeting time.  So she was kind enough to grab our food and meet me at my office.  I got the regular fried chicken sandwich and she got the spicy.  We shared some curly fries. I saw on their site they mentioned celery and mayo so I told her no celery and mayo.  I guess the celery is mixed in already with their cabbage mixing because I only got pickles and chicken between my bread.\n\nThe fried chicken sandwich was simple, but oh so delicious.  The perfect blend of spices coated the crispy chicken.  Every bite of chicken was so juicy and flavorful.  I don't like pickles, but these pickles were pretty dang good!  In between the soft bread, this hunk of delicious meat was so filling.  Curly fries were forgettable and not that crispy and didn't have much flavor.  \n\nIt's a steal at $8, especially for the area.  I'll be back to get my fried chicken fix during work.  Just two bits of advice for The Bird, I know I wasn't there in person to order, but can you please specify if the celery is mixed in with the slaw, I don't believe it is, and a lot of people don't like celery, so it would be cool to separate the two if they're not.

They surprised me and did an excellent job! I ordered the \"happier meal\" and had a spicy chicken sandwich, curly fries, and a Hell or High Watermelon beer. \nThe chicken sandwich here is perfect! Not only is the chicken perfectly fried (they use a batter and not breading - soo good) and the toppings made it even better. It was a savory, crunchy miracle. \nThe Bird satisfied this picky, Southern, fried  chicken connoisseur and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. \nAlso - if you're wondering, the line moves very quickly.

I really wanted to like this place because the fries were pretty amazing and a good deal for its price and size. The nacho cheese, sour cream and chili perfectly complimented the seasoned fries and left me pretty full. The chicken biscuit was definitely a disappointment and too expensive for its size. The biscuit was dry and the chicken was overcooked and chewy. I tried a bit of my friend's salad which looked absolutely delicious with colorful beets, apples and barley. Unfortunately, the fried chicken she got on top was also overcooked. I would be willing to give this place another try since I love fried chicken but that would probably be it if I wasn't feeling it since the price is more towards the expensive end.", "author": "Irene L."}

If you're looking for a simplistic menu that doesn't overwhelm but will cater to your liking, this place is it. They basically have fries and fried chicken sammies, but those fries are definitely not your average junior high cafeteria fries. They're crisp, delicious, and hot out of the fryer. The sandwiches are gargantuan. If they aren't stuffing a modest bun with two large chunks of chicken, they're jamming in a giant single slab that appears like an entire chicken steak. The slaw on top is amaze as well, filled with purple cabbage, onions, and celery bits, sandwiched in with two long pickle slices. \n\nGreat deals for a ton of food, it's only $8 for a regular or spicy chicken sammy, and $2.50 for a generous helping of fries. \n\nI went in there during lunch, and there was definitely a line waiting to order and also waiting for their food to come out of the kitchen. However, I ordered a substantial 10 sammies and 10 sides of curly fries for a team shindig, and the order was ready in less time it took me to run next door, order a few salads, and stand waiting for those salads. I'd say it took less than 8 minutes to get out a large order during the lunch period. \n\nThis joint took over the old Melt location, and I couldn't be happier. This place puts a smile on everyone's faces when they walk into a room and realize we've catered from The Bird. And when a bland sandwich and bag of chips or a wrap with soggy fries could run you easily $12-13, this chicken sandwich place definitely has much more to offer in terms of quality of food, speed of service and experience, and staff. Everyone is super friendly, quick to take your order, and efficient. \n\nNote: After 3pm, they also have a meal option where you can purchase a 12-16oz can of beer.", "author": "Alison A."}

The server just kept rattling off the benefit of getting the beer as if he was on automatic pilot. Jamie was grousing so much about the miscommunication that he scared the guy next to us away from our table.

Clearly brined in something tasty, the dark meat was so succulent that I wanted to call it Denzel. Apparently they use an Ethiopian berbere spice blend in the crispy coating, and the housemade apple slaw provided a fresh crunch. All of it was encased snugly in a bun that's baked fresh daily so they say (photo: http://bit.ly/2i9Kz7c).\n\nAll I know was that it was good, very good in fact. It's just too bad that the rest of the food was not nearly as interesting or satisfying.

Similar to Rheas but slightly more flavorful and $5 cheaper. Came in around 2pm on a Tuesday and got my food in under 10 mins. Had the spicy chicken with loaded curly fries. Very good and definitely contributed to my fat-assedness. The chicken had a light crisp on the outside and juicy interior. The hot sauce flavoring reminded me of a fancy organic Texas Pete without the strong kick, a perfect type of fog city heat. The curly fries were butter and ice. The only thing I can complain about is this fowl is still not as good as chic filla thus 4 stars. But maybe my more affluent peers would say The Byrd is a more classy chick fila and rate it a five. oh and the counter dude who took my order kept staring at the Buffalo on my Patagonia trucker cap; he probably thought I was a depressed Bills fan...", "author": "Johny B."}

In case you haven't heard, during the playoffs LeBron James stopped by The Bird to order some food for him and his teammates. Now I don't have any big sporting events coming up (feel free to hook me up with some tix though), but I still can come to The Bird and try their AMAZING chicken sandwiches.\n\nThe Bird is my favorite chicken sandwich shop in the City! During the usual lunch times on weekdays (from 11:30pm to 1pm), this place is PACKED with the lines extending half a block! Don't fret though as the lines move fairly quickly. Seating may be hard to find during the lunch rush, but seats tend to open up quickly. They have a few small tables outside as well. The menu is pretty simple. They're most known for their chicken sandwiches and you can order it classic (non-spicy) or spicy. I've ordered both several times now and I prefer the classic one as my spice tolerance level is pretty laughable. The spicy does have a good kick to it so if you tend to like your chicken sandwich spicy (like LeBron does), then order it spicy. The chicken sandwiches come in a fresh bun with the fried chicken, apple slaw, mayo, pickles, and celery. The fried chicken has a nice crunch to it and the white meat of the chicken is very juicy, moist, and tender. The other condiments actually adds a unique flavor to it - a bit of sourness and sweetness that compliments the spices of the chicken sandwich very well. As for sides, they do curly fries which are nothing to write home about, but still crunchy and light. They also have an option for their curly fries to get fully loaded fries which has bacon, cream, green onions, and cheese on top.\n\nAlso their apple fritters (served only during breakfast hours or until they run out) are really good! It's 3 for $1.50 and they have good weight on them meaning 3 should be enough to satisfy your morning hunger. Haven't tried their other breakfast items yet, but if it's like their chicken sandwich for lunch & dinner, I'm pretty sure it's really good.\n\nOverall this place is really good. Totally would recommend this place! The chicken sandwich is top notch and the prices are affordable! The chicken sandwich is only $8, curly fries $2.50, fully loaded fries $3.75, and the bird salad $6.50 (+$3.50/$6 for half/full chicken on top). You can get a meal that will fill you up for $11.

So when they heard about The Bird, there was not a moment spent to wait for all of the team like we usually do. To beat the lunch rush we jumped in line around 12:15pm and by 12:45 we were back at our office enjoying our food. This place is not even in the same category as Chic-Fil-A. They are far superior. \n\nFirst, they use dark meat instead of white which makes for, in my opinion, a more tender, savory meal. Second, the crunch is what this fried chicken sandwich is all about! I ordered the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. It made me reminisce of my college days when Jack in the Box's Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich was a regular evening meal. Oh, don't pretend that wasn't your jam too! We all progress in different ways. \n\nLastly, the fixings! Oh my gosh! Celery? Who would think to put celery on a chicken sandwich and expect it to taste good? They did that! Sliced red cabbage that tasted as if it were tossed in a vinaigrette mixed with parsley and what I think were carrots.. maybe? All topped with a firm dill pickle. I made the mistake of forgetting to say no mayo. Ugh, I can't stand the stuff. But whoa! This mayo is comparable to the mayonnaise in Europe. Thick, whipped and delicious! The curly fries had good flavor, but I prefer my fries to be fried a little more. Although I love a good sriracha it didn't really go with anything. How about a house made ketchup instead? \n\nBread buns are made daily by a local baker. The chicken which I hope is also local is free range. The menu is to the point. Chicken, curly fries, drinks! No fluff. Pricing is on par for a lunch spot in the Financial District, so expect to pay around $10.00. You could definitely split the sandwich if you wanted to. 3.5 stars.", "author": "Jaylena P."}

The food was delicious! The spicy chicken sandwich is a much fancier version of Chick-Fil-A. You get a very generous moist piece of dark meat that is fried to a perfect crisp. It's layered onto of a crunchy apple slaw. It's a bit messy to eat but everything about that sandwich including the bun was delicious! The spicy fried chicken had a bit of a kick but was not too spicy -- if you prefer more spicy, add their homemade siracha. The sandwich should be enjoyed right away otherwise the apple slaw will make the bread mushy.\n\nThe curly fries were nice & crispy. It went perfectly with their homemade siracha. Ohh man, that siracha was sooo good -- I want to layer it on top everything I eat! I have to admit.. despite being very full, I kept nibbling on the curly fries just so I could eat the siracha ;)\n\nThe spicy fried chicken sandwich was so filling that I barely got through my curly fries. I almost wished there was a mini version of the fried chicken sandwich as that's the only way I get to enjoy both my burger & fries at Super Duper. For the time being, I'd have to work up my appetite to tackle that spicy fried chicken sandwich + curly fries + siracha sauce triple threat combo!\n\nDefinitely make your way out before the lunch crowd.

On a scale of 1 (bland) to 5 (lava), I can tolerate up to a 3. Thus, the spiciness was a little more than enough for my tastebuds, offering enough to make my tongue tingle, but not hiss air. The home made apple slaw and celeries is understated, and yet an important component to keeping the sandwich fresh, light, and relatively healthy-tasting, which I appreciated a lot. \n\nCurly fries (an extra $2.50) were optimally fried and thus had a good crunch to them, but really nothing to write home about. If anything, it served as a good compliment to the sandwich itself. \n\nThey offer several drinks as well (beer and soda), and a \"hot\" ice cream sandwich (not sure how that would work, but sounds interesting nonetheless).

The menu is limited (which I appreciate) so I went with their top item, the chicken sandwich (spicy). Holy mother of chicken breasts, I in for an experience!!

My buddy and I were looking for a place to have a beer on a rainy day and just happened to be walking by this place so we jumped in. My buddy ordered the \"crazy\" fries or whatever they're called and I told him I'd order some wings. When I ordered wings the lady said they were $2.50 each! She assured me they were pretty big like you would get at Buffalo Wild Wings. I've never been to Buffalo Wild Wings, so that meant nothing to me. I just couldn't see myself paying that much per wing, so I ordered a sandwich instead and a beer.  \n\nAs mentioned in my previous post the sandwich had stale bread and the chicken was way too greasy. Perhaps worst of all, the beer was warm. I tried some of my friend's fries. They were cold with disgusting nacho cheese and stale bacon bits I wouldn't feed a dog. My buddy was still hungry so he went and ordered some wings. They might have been the smallest wings I've ever seen. These had to have come from baby chicks. And no ranch or any other dipping sauce by the way (this may have been my buddy's fault, although I've read on other posts you pay extra for them). We didn't even finish them! He paid $2.50 each and we didn't even finish them!!! \n\nWe talked for a little bit after and let the left over wings sit there. After a few minutes I noticed a disgusting puddle of oil that came from the wings. I left the place feeling sick. \n\nSure everyone has their own tastes but this place was just gross and there are so many way better options (like McDonalds). I would usually give a place a couple chances since maybe the first time was just an off night. But sometimes the experience is so bad, you'd be a real dummy to try it again.

Hands down, the most succulent chicken I've ever had in a fried chicken sandwich in SF. The portion size is satisfying and for $8, it's a great deal, dare I say the best deal in SF for a good fried chicken sandwich since most other places are in the $10-$12 range.\n\nThe celery, apple, onion slaw is OK, but could be better. I know they offer a spicy chicken option, but it feel like the slaw itself could use a kick. More pepper? Some lemon or other acid? Less celery or more finely cut celery so it doesn't take away from the other ingredients? I don't know.\n\nThe curly fries were good for $2.50 and again the portion was just right, I didn't feel disgusting after eating them.

It sure beats the McChicken hands down, but the Southern Comfort Kitchen food truck still slings my favorite fried chicken sandwich.  However, The Bird is consistently open 6 days a week for Lunch & Dinner so, unlike a food truck, it will be there when you crave it.\n\nSpicy Fried Chicken Sandwich: Pretty solid.  Soft tasty bun.  Lots of tangy crunchy flavor in the pickles and the slaw.  The chicken thigh was quite tender with a nice batter and a decent fry.  Personally, I would have preferred if it were cut or pounded thinner so there was more surface area to crisp up.  But still quite tasty.\n\nLoaded Fries: Just the right amount of fries to complement the sandwich, but not make you feel disgustingly full.

There's also a weird spice in the breading that adds a touch of sweetness to the whole thing. Maybe allspice or clove? Idk.\n- The chicken to bun ratio is off. The chicken is so thick it's hard to take a bite of the sandwich without everything squeezing out. I appreciate the generosity, but it just makes it hard to eat.\n- Speaking of which, the integrity of the bun is off. About two bites into the sandwich, my bottom bun completely shattered and fell apart. Heh.\n- I think these are the same folks who run Super Duper. I like Super Duper, but find that their burger is missing acidity. Ditto for their chicken burger; the slaw comes with is super fatty and creamy, but not very acidic.

There are few things in the world that tickle my feathers more than a tall can of ice cold beer with some crispy fried chicken, so it's no coincidence that one of my favorite rap albums is the classic 2003 banger, \"Chicken-n-Beer\" by Ludacris.  I personally want to invite Luda out here and buy him a meal because it's honestly that good and I think he would appreciate it.  I first rolled into The Bird about a year ago for breakfast when I was walking to work and saw a long line of humans eagerly awaiting entry.  The shop was new and they were offering some killers specials, so I decided to give it a whirl.  While I stood in line (outside, because it was so long) my mouth began to water as the scent of chicken biscuits swirled up my nostrils.  A song from another Southern rapper named Yelawolf came to mind.  He said, \"You know what I put on chicken biscuits?  I put jelly and hot sauce on my chicken biscuits.\"  Then he cheered excitedly, \"ALL AT THE SAME TIME!\"\n\nAlas, I'm at the register where a very friendly young man took my order.  I asked for one spicy chicken biscuit and one regular chicken biscuit.  The breakfast chicken biscuits come with tater tots that also taste delightful.  Once I had the actual chicken biscuits in my paws ready for my morning feeding, I waltzed over to the condiment station where they had jelly and hot sauce.  It wasn't just any old packets of junk that you find at other fried chicken shacks; The Bird has homemade Sriracha sauce that is bombtastic and not too spicy, but with just enough kick to keep the eyes open.  There was also a large jar of strawberry jelly that I lathered on my biscuits, and pulled a Yelawolf by dumping the homemade Sriracha on the fried chicken ALL AT THE SAME TIME!   Dude, I'm tellin' you, please, do yourself a favor, go here and try this one day.  Have you ever been hungover on your way to work?  You know when it's some coworkers' birthday and you get dragged out to some happy hour and it ends up being super fun and you drink too much and dread going to work the next morning because you feel groggy?  Don't take Tylenol or any other drugs; simply go to The Bird, gobble up some chicken biscuits n' tots, and start drinking copious amounts of water and you'll be happy and gleeful again.\n\nSo whether you're in the mood to jumpstart your morning, or you want to go out for supper with some buds, this is the place for you.  The chicken sandwich I grubbed for supper is about 2wice the size of the chicken biscuit, so if you're a chugger like me, go for it, but if you're not in the mood to get heavily stuffed, order the biscuit.  As far as the beer selection goes, it's really good, too. Being the chugger I am, I ordered the 32 oz. oil can of Miller High Life aka \"The champagne of beers\" but that's just because I couldn't resist that massive oil can full of beer.  The IPAs they serve are much better.\n\nAnd last but not least, there's just a chill vibe in this shop.  Literally every single employee that I've encountered there has been super friendly and they are always playing good music.  Go to The Bird for breakfast, lunch or supper.

Comes with pickles, slaw, and mayo and the most buttery and squishy bun!! In case you can't tell I loved this sandwich; I practically wolfed it down. Decided to skip the fries. I guess they used to have curly fries, but now they are crinkle ones? Anyways, they looked bland and boring. Maybe the loaded ones would be okay. \n\nAwesome place and really reasonably priced.

It's been a few months since it first opened and today was the first time I came to see what the hype was all about. \n\nFirst off, if you want a table, get here early! By noon, all the tables were already taken. The line went out the door, directed by stanchions - greatly appreciated with constant traffic. When you get in, you'll notice a few focal points in eye sight: a huge BEER sign, apparently they sell beer lol, and a theater style menu, bright and easy to read. The menu is sooo simple, focused on just a few items, with the hope to perfect what's offered. There's high top tables inside and table tops outside for lots of seating however, the early \"bird\" gets the worm. The staff is super friendly, super efficient. I love the assembly line of chicken sandwiches they create as orders are placed. \n\nHands down, the most popular item is the Fried Chicken Sandwich, your choice of spicy or classic, for $8. Between two toasted buns, you have a huge deep fried, white meat chicken patty topped with an apple slaw and sliced pickles. There's also (I believe) some kind of sauce: thousand island, mayo type or aioli like. I also order the seasoned curly fries for about $3. OH EM GEE! The chicken sandwich is out of this world! I got the classic version, the chicken was crispy and flavorful, juicy and tender. The toast buns gave depth and a great foundation for the party in between. LOVED the apple slaw, a little bit of a tang accompanied with the pickles gave a fresh vibe and different texture, creating a well balanced bite for your taste buds. What a smashing hit! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS. For my fries, I was a little disappointed to discover that they gave me crinkled fries instead. I didn't notice them putting my to-go bag together, don't know if they were out of curly fries, but I've seen friends eating their curly fries in the past so super disappointing to come back to work and discover a mediocre crinkle fries. Just seemed like a defrosted bag o' fries you pick up from your local Costco. \n\nAside from that little hiccup, this place is awesome. So worth the wait, so worth the walk (not for me though, I work across the street lol), so worth the price. Unfortunately this meal is not on my approved list of healthy items but when you're looking to live a little, fly over to The Bird and check them out!\n\nCLUCK YEAH!", "author": "Rockne H."}

In a city of overpriced fried chicken sandwiches (looking at you, Rove Kitchen), the Bird is a welcome addition.\n\nI wouldn't expect anything less given that they pretty much only offer fried chicken sandwiches and fries. It makes it easy to decide what to get.\nDo you want a non-spicy fried chicken sandwich or a spicy one?\nDo you want regular curly fries or fully loaded fries with bacon, cheese, and green onions?\n\nI chose the regular sandwich ($8) with regular curly fries ($2.50). The fresh brioche bun (no sesame seeds) holds up really well to the big piece of juicy fried chicken. The chicken is crispy and has a nice, not-terribly-heavy-or-oily crust. The apple slaw and pickles don't do much, but don't hurt the sandwich either. The sandwich is flavorful, but it's not heavy in sauces. I would prefer a tangier sauce like a BBQ sauce instead of the default mayo, but it's fine as is. The spicy version of the sandwich is too spicy for what I would want to eat a whole thing of, but if you like spicy foods, you'll definitely find the spicy version more tasty. As for the curly fries... GETTTT IT. I haven't had curly fries since the Arby's days.\n\nThe line has gotten considerably better since the grand opening days. Plus, once you order, the food comes out ridiculously fast, so don't spend too long going to the bathroom or packing up your condiments.\n\nI did see what looked like a giant bag of frozen fried chicken that they were dumping into the fryer.

I'm impressed by the amount of things they put into it. I actually got pretty full. While they advertised a kale and romaine base, they ended up serving mixed greens and romaine (like, totally unacceptable! lol jk it was good because made it less hard to chew). The salad also came with lemony apples, beets, and barley (i think) which mixed pretty well with each other. \n\nI think I got a bad piece of chicken last time or maybe I really didn't like the crust but I think I understand why. The breading does not stick well to the chicken and it is a little extra. Also, it almost tastes... healthy like a gluten-free tofu nugget made with cornmeal or something. Anyway, I really liked the chicken this time because I got the spicy one and it was juicy and actually spicy. Yum.

The regular is really good, the spicy sandwich is divine beyond words. The spice blend really sets the flavor profile above all the rest I've encountered. It is literally my perfect fried chicken. The slaw is on point, the pickles are great, the bread is exactly what it should be, the chicken itself is exquisite, and the curly fries are perfect.\n\nAnd it's quite affordable.

I will miss the juicy, crispy, flavorful chicken :( There are similar places in SoCal like Birdie's and Two Birds but I would still say this chicken sandwich was better. Not overly breaded, not too dry, unique-tasting herbs. Their house-made Sriracha was delicious. We also tried the salted caramel ice cream taco and it was surprisingly good! \n\nI tried both the non-spicy chicken sandwich and the non-spicy naked chicken. I think the chicken sandwich was better because of the mix of everything in your mouth (delicious bun, slaw, pickles, and the fried chicken). The naked chicken was better for enjoying the chicken alone, and less messy, but if I went back I'd definitely get the sandwich again.\n\nTheir service is quick and brusque.

We came around 9:30am, and there was no line, woot! Skipped the morning working crowd! I was able to order 2 breakfast sandwiches right away.

I ordered the classic fried chicken, curly fries, and a root beer.  A few minutes later they were calling for me telling my order was ready.  \n\nI quickly found a seat next to some other happy customers and dug right into the crispy, tender hunk of fried chicken.  So many textures and flavors.  The slightly sweet and tangy apple slaw was a great crunchy contrast to the tender chewy bun, and complemented the crisp of the savory perfectly fried chicken.  I stuffed my face with curly fries in between bites of the chicken.  Sure, these curly fries are basically Arby's curly fries (i.e. not homemade), but who doesn't like curly fries?  \n\nWhat would I do to improve what was already a delicious meal?

I was craving their biscuit sandwich so I came for breakfast... and come lunch I wanted their chicken sandwich so guess where I ended up? Yup, you guessed it.  \n\nBreakfast chicken biscuit sandwich - there's some sort of weird mayo that they slather on. This was meh to me and I should've told them to put it off, but perhaps others may like it. The biscuit was excellent! The most unhealthy breakfast I've had in a while but worth every bit. The biscuit was not too dry and not too buttery, but still crumbly and oh-so-delicious. Went great with spicy chicken.\nThe hash rounds were good - crisp and hot, not too salty. \n\nLunch - line was out the door but moved pretty fast, so don't let the line scare you. Spicy chicken sandwich was spicy, moist, crispy, awesome bun too (refer to my previous review or any others for more details on the chicken). I still think this is the best fried (spicy) chicken sandwich I've ever had. \nFor some reason, the curly fries I ordered weren't that fresh! This was odd given that they were super busy so they should have been cooking constantly. My fries weren't that crispy and tasted like fries that have sat too long (starting to edge on being soggy). I ate in the restaurant, so this isn't attributable to ordering to-go and having the fries steam itself to sogginess, as would happen if you did that.\n\nTheir ice cream sandwich is REALLY good. It's some sort of hawaiian-type bun that they cook in a waffle-like maker (NOT FRIED) with ice cream inside. I ordered the strawberry chocolate chunk. I couldn't taste much chocolate but the strawberry was nice and refreshing, especially after a heavy fried sandwich. Overall, not overly sweet which is GREAT.", "author": "Melody L."}

For me, it totally hits the spot. \n\nThe piece of chicken is enormous. The portion size was enough that no sides were necessary for me. I liked it enough to come back 2 consecutive days to try both the original and the spicy. The breading on the chicken is crisp, spiced right and doesn't fall apart. The chicken is juicy and cooked perfectly. The slaw on the sandwich has apples and cabbage which offers a nice tart, bright crunch. After trying both versions, I will opt for the spicy and ask for extra mayo as I feel like the sandwich could benefit from being a little more creamy to balance out the hot sauce. \n\nAlso, if you can, eat the sandwich there instead of to go because the bread is soft and gets soggy quickly. \n\nOrder at the counter where they display their offerings of canned sodas & beers. The place gets super packed at lunch time, but by 1:30 it clears out enough to get a seat by the time the food is ready. There is a little outdoor seating which will be lovely on warm afternoons. \n\nI have yet to try their hot ice cream sandwich or loaded curly fries, but I'm sure I will as I plan to visit the Bird on a regular basis.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

The next day, I had to have one for myself.  And now, that is the standard by which I judge all fried chicken sandwiches.\n\nAnd The Bird comes close.  Very close.  Skillet adds some fennel to their batter, but The Bird has a slaw on their sandwich that would make Donald J. Rump crawl to Kim Jong Un's house on his hands and knees.  Well, maybe not that good, but it's damn good.  Sweet but not sweet, sour but not sour, crunchy and light and not drenched in its own juices.  The batter on the chicken itself is crunchy and tasty, and the bun was light and slightly sweet.  Curly fries were just a touch spicy, but crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  \n\nI'd go back.

Crispy, juicy (expect to make a mess), and flavorful chicken, a bit on the salty side, but offset by the pickles and slaw, all on a fluffy, toasted bun.

The chicken was so juicy and their breading to chicken ratio was perfect. They also use chicken that does not have growth hormones.\n\nWhen people tell that something is spicy, I take this with a grain of salt. I enjoy spicy food. Spicier the better! Their spicy burger is indeed spicy, but not like jalape\u00f1os and flaming chili flavored spicy.\n\nI am amazed at the seasoning they use for the chicken breading. It is tangy and is made with a wide variety of spices. I thoroughly enjoyed the unique flavors. I felt like there was a hint of spices that came through, which made it taste like Indian food.\n\nThe spicy burger comes with slaw and pickles. The slaw is not ice cold and is seasoned with cilantro, which went very well with the flavors in the breading. The pickles were light and not over-salted. All of the components they used, had a purpose in constructing the burger's overall flavor profile. I appreciated this thoughtfulness , as burgers should not include everything, but the kitchen sink.\n\nI went in for an early dinner and there wasn't a line. The service was efficient and friendly. Even if the lines are long, this is a place that is worth giving a try.\n\nBeing only one person, I could only eat so much. But, I really wanted to try their loaded fries and hot ice cream sandwich. \nI can see myself eating their spicy burger for lunch several times a month.

You should go, but get there before the rush so you don't have to stand in line.\n\nService - I managed to get here before the lunch rush, thus, I didn't have to stand in line which was great.  I have put off trying out The Bird due to the long line.  \n\nWith no one waiting behind me, I didn't feel bad asking a lot of questions about the salad.  Is it meal size (yes), what's in it (baby kale, romaine, beets, fuji apples, farro) and how much is a half order of chicken v. a full order (about 4-5 large slices v 8-9).  The woman working the cash register was super patient with the litany of questions and really nice overall :).  They are super speedy, and my salad came out in no time.\n\nTo avoid the questions, it could be helpful to have a more descriptive menu available somewhere.\n\nFood - I like fried chicken, but it's not something I would consider at the top of my list of favorite foods I would select to eat for the rest of my life on a deserted island.  I might reconsider that stance after eating The Bird's spicy chicken.  \n\nAmazingly flavorful, crispy outer batter with super tender, juicy chicken on the inside.  Yes, I think that is probably a marketing line from one of the major fried chicken chains, but it is really true for The Bird!\n\nThe salad part of the salad was a generous helping of greens, beets, and apple.  I would have  liked a little more farro, but honestly, with the chicken being as good as it was, who cares!\n\nAmbiance - It's a small interior w mainly communal seating options and also has some outdoor seating for when the weather is better.  I didn't pay a lot of attention as I had my order to go, but it wouldn't be a bad place to eat lunch or a very casual dinner.\n\nPrice/value - It wasn't a cheap salad, but I can't say I know of any places in the area that offer a very inexpensive salad.

I ordered the spicy one and my wife got the original and I actually liked hers better. The fried one I was not too crazy about their spices on it. Their homemade Sriracha is actually really tasty and goes really well with the sandwich. For the price of the fries, I wish they would have given a bigger portion.

(Pro-tip: Show up for dinner and there's never a wait.)\n\nThe menu at The Bird is straightforward and simple: Do you want a spicy or regular fried chicken sandwich? Do you want curly fries with it? Make two decisions and you're on your way. My recommendation: Get the spicy if you're looking for great taste and you aren't afraid of falling asleep for the rest of the day. Go for the regular if you're looking for something a little bit lighter (yes, I recognize that a \"light\" fried chicken sandwich is a bit of an oxymoron). As for the curly fries, get them to share. The sandwiches are pretty big in and quite filling on their own, but the curly fries are perfectly crispy and savory, so you don't want to miss out.\n\nThe fried chicken is crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and it's a pretty hefty portion. The apple coleslaw in the sandwich really rounds out the intense flavor of the fried chicken, a perfect combination.\n\nIf fried chicken wasn't so unhealthy, I'd be here all the time!", "author": "Brittany C."}

When I arrived I saw that the line extended to about 15 people outside the door. I had almost a two hour break so decided to wait to see what all the fuss was about. The line moved pretty quickly with two registers taking orders about 15 feet beyond the doorway. The staff was very helpful and efficient. I placed my order for the spicy chicken sandwich which was about $9. I took my receipt and waited to the side. There are some seats there but not enough to accommodate the busy lunch crowd so I wouldn't count on getting a seat there. There is a small condiment station with some things including ketchup and water. After about 5 minutes, they called my name/number. The sandwich was great. Tender and great flavor throughout.

I had read the reviews, got pumped, walked 20 mins to the spot (add an extra 5 because I missed the spot), yet after devouring my meal within 10 mins, I was full but not satisfied. There was a little hole in my being that wasn't complete, and I can't quite put my finger on it. All I could say was meh.\n\nCurly Fries (Fully Loaded)- Heart-stoppingly delicious. I would recommend eating it asap before it cools down too much.\n\nTo sum- Imagine if you have wanted a dog for many years, and all you could think about is getting a dog.

Literally (yes, I mean literally) 5 seconds after I ordered from the generous cashier, they called my name (I'm pretty sure it was mine because my two friends who had ordered before me also got their's immediately upon ordering) and my Spicy Chicken Burger and Curly Fries were waiting for me.\n\nTheir fried chicken was definitely my type of fried chicken. It wasn't like the typical KFC or Popeyes fried chicken coated with bread that everyone usually thinks of (and that I find greasy). The chicken was fried and covered with some kind of spicy seasoning and thin layer of coating that kicked your taste buds after you took a bite of it. It reminded me of popcorn chicken that you could find at a boba cafe, except the piece of chicken filled the entire burger. The curly fries were also great, as I dipped them in their homemade Sriracha sauce that they give out in little containers for free.\n\nBecause I would come back again and the fact that I'm taking time to review this place, I would definitely recommend this place to someone who is or even isn't visiting San Francisco. The heat or the lack of air conditioning (or very little if there was any) didn't stop me from leaving. It has to be on everyone's SF to-do or must-try lists!", "author": "Eric O."}

The curly fries went well with the meal, and the Sriracha ketchup was unique and unexpected, but so good! \n\nAlso, customer service is a big deal to me, and The Bird was a great experience!

I love curly fries so the free ranch dressing was definitely spot on. The non-spicy sandwich was definitely bland, would not order that one again while the spicy one had a nice kick. The slaw with apples was very refreshing and I appreciated the extra side of it as we ordered to go.

They make one type of sandwich, ONE, and I have to say it...I'm in love. I can't deny it. It's a MUST MUST try, get here early because they only sell 200 of these fried chicken babies a day and you don't want to miss out. \n\n**The guy in front of me ordered about 20 fried chicken sandwiches, if that doesn't tell you how good these sandwiches are then I don't know what will. \n\nYou will always find a line out the door as soon as they open, but the wait is soooo worth it ( it's not long anyways, it goes by pretty fast). And plus, you tell me another restaurant where someone comes out with free curly fries samples for the waiting patrons. Another plus plus, they make their own sriracha, which for someone that douses sriracha on mostly everything, their version was pretty darn great and fresh. \n\nThe fried chicken sandwich is AMAAZINNGG. Comes out hot and fresh, super moist chicken, HUGE sandwich, great balance of flavors between the chicken, coleslaw, and pickles, need I say more? My girlfriend and I got the regular and spicy fried chicken sandwich, just to compare, and really it's a personal thing, whether you like spicy or not, but regardless of what you choose, you will be in chicken heaven! \n\nPARKING: wouldn't recommend lol take the muni here because it's located in downtown FD, which we all know is cray. \n\nSERVICE: awesome! Besides the free curly fries sample, you'll also find the owner coming around to ask how things are and how the sandwich tastes, very good man! The place isn't so big, fair amount of seating, but can get pretty crowded so I would suggest going early if you would like to eat there. \n\nPRICE: $8 Fried Chicken Sandwich (Regular or Spicy; I recommend Spicy YUM), and this is worth every penny. They're not like other restaurants who make fried chicken sandwiches like sliders, no, this sandwich is huge and without a doubt fill you up! \n\n~$4 for the loaded curly fries; this one was on the small side for the price, but never the less delicious.", "author": "Vivian S."}

Let me just say that I have very high standards for fried chicken, so I had very high expectations because I've seen the crazy line wrap around the block here. \n\nMy thought is that the chicken sandwich here is decent and I'd probably come back and get it again, but it is not out of this world. At $8, it is really a pretty cheap lunch in the Financial District.  However, it also sits pretty heavy in your stomach afterward (but what do you expect out of a fried chicken sandwich?) \n\nThe chicken sandwich comes with a giant piece of seasoned chicken (tender and flavorful), their slaw (which contains red onions which I really don't like, celery, red cabbage, apples), pickles and mayonnaise.  Their current menu is really simple and great, and I think they have a few more sandwich options coming soon.  I think my main issue with the sandwich was that I didn't like the spicy seasoning that much.  My favorite spicy chicken sandwiches are from Chic-fil-A and Popeye's, if that helps as a comparison point. \n\nThinking about other famous fried chicken sandwiches in the Bay Area to give you other comparisons, I know there is Bakesale Betty's in East Bay. I actually think that this sandwich is better than Bakesale Betty's (don't crucify me please!) because it is more flavorful. The Prospect in the Financial District also does a really good fried chicken sandwich, but it is twice the price and at a sit-down restaurant.

Although I was glad the wait was short as I came during my lunch hour, perhaps it was too short as I'm almost sure the chicken was undercooked. After a few bites of the chicken being a strange texture, I looked down and noticed the chicken was pretty pink in several places (see attached pics). I showed my friend and he confirmed that it was probably best to not eat it as well. A woman that worked there came to bus the table next to us and I told her that the chicken was pink and looked undercooked so I was not comfortable eating it. She shocked me by saying, \"That's happened to me too, I've mentioned to them that the chicken's pretty pink sometimes...\" She proceeded to walk away behind the counter to mix some slaw. I looked at her a few times as I thought she would relay my comment to another team member either in the front or their kitchen in order to make this right. Working at a cafe myself, I would think a replacement meal would be in place as I paid $11 for a sandwich and curly fries, but was only able to eat the fries and a few small bites of the sandwich.

For those expecting to get your traditional fried chicken sandwich thats not what you will be getting. This chicken sandwich is just something else in its own unique way.\n\nThe Bird has a very urban hipster atmosphere, with its movie billboard menu, neon lights, artwork, and visible metal beams. That urban hipster flare is completely reflective in its chicken sandwich. From the looks of it the sandwich looks amazing. But after taking a bite its quite the trip.\n\nI ordered a spicy chicken sandwich, which was composed of the fried chicken, which was moist cooked great, a couple pickles, a slaw, composed of red lettuce, red onion, celery, and apple, and a bun that had a hint of cinnamon. It was an interesting taste, the balance of the slaw and the cinnamon were an unexpected flavor combined with the little kick from the cinnamon. Dont get me wrong though it tasted great.\n\nHowever despite it tasting great, it was not without flaws. As I kept eating the sandwich, I began to miss the aspects of a traditional chicken sandwich, such as that tangy sandwich spread, real crunchy succulent chicken. Perhaps the biggest cons were the weak breading which fell apart at times and the lack of emphasis on the chicken.\n\nHowever The Bird is a nice refreshing take on the signature chicken sandwiches of places such as Chick- fil-A and great experience if youre nearby", "author": "Adrian E."}

The chicken's not dry, which is SUPER important. The breading isn't break-your-teeth hard but there's still a crunch. You can either order it regular or spicy - but you should ONLY get it spicy. It's not even spicy, like at all. They'll also ask if you want mayo, pickles, and slaw in it. Say 'yes' every time. They put these special toppings to make it the best Fried Chicken Sandwich for your benefit, so don't take away their specialty. Also, for $8 - can you get another Fried Chicken Sandwich for that price in the Financial/SoMa District??\n\nThe Hot Ice Cream Sandwich is the next best thing! If you love the sweet Hawaiian rolls, you need to order this too because they use those soft delicious rolls for the bun. You can pick between 3 flavors: chocolate, pistachio, and salted caramel. It's super quick and they're super soft! It made my day.\n\nAlso tried the Loaded Fries. But I, plus everyone I've talked to, don't think it's worth the $4 out of my pocket. My friend said the regular fries aren't worth it either and compared it to something you could get at a fast food restaurant. If you're lucky, they might be passing out samples of their curly fries with their sriracha ketchup, and that's really all you need to try the fries.\n\nIf you get there but there's already a line outside of the store, don't worry about it. They've got 2 cashiers and they're SUPER fast.

I got the spicy chicken sandwich with the coleslaw and pickles on the side and the S.O got the regular chicken sandwich done the same way and we also shared an order of the curly fries.\n\nEverything came out the way it should be, things that were supposed to be hot came out piping hot and the coleslaw was tasty. It had a mixture of celery, apple and red cabbage with the apple cider vinegar; that was nice and refreshing, none of that mayo-y stuff in it. The curly fries came out hot and crispy.\n\nAlthough the chicken served in their sandwiches is dark meat it was tasteless. The piece was hot and juicy, however it lacked in flavor. It was cooked perfectly fine, batter was crispy, but just didn't have any taste to it. My spicy chicken, all the seasoning was in the batter but the chicken itself tasted bland. Wanted to love this place but only loved everything else but the chicken. \n\nThis place is fairly new so maybe other people will recommend the same thing--that the chicken requires some  seasoning to it.", "author": "Jenny L."}

I stopped in this morning to pick up some breakfast on my way to work. It was annoying to find that you were \"sold out\" of coffee but fine.. I placed my order for a sausage biscuit and began to wait.. and wait... and wait.. after about 7 minutes (checked the time on the pod cast I'd just started) it was obvious my order hadn't been started but I was patient.. When a customer who came in after I came in got his food is when I asked for a refund.. no one offered any sort of apology but instead told me it was because I'd ordered a sausage biscuit and they take a long time.. I'd never had to wait as long as this and or watch other customers get their food first... in the time this exchange was taking place another customer who came in after me got their food.. and again I was told that it was my fault because of what I ordered. The young lady who was on her phone and sitting in the dining area who came over to process the refund never apologized, at all, never said.. oh I'm sorry I'll refund you and it looks like it's almost ready.. she told me I ordered wrong. she then told me it would take 5-6 days to get my refund of a whole... 6 dollars. I've enjoyed getting lunch and breakfast at the Bird and I think that time's come to an end as long as this crew is working, Not only were things taking so long but the attitude at every turn was that it was my fault and in no way lifting a finger towards correcting the situation.

They also had a pretty solid selection of canned craft beers, ranging from $4-$5. Less than 5 minutes after we had ordered, our food was ready. Very quick turnaround. \n\nThe spicy sandwich was amazing! Perfect level of spice and the sandwich didn't need any hot sauce, which is rare for me to say. The breaking was also spot on, as it was nice and thin, not too much. Only thing I didn't like was the celery in the slaw, which is because I personally don't like celery, although it did do a good job of toning down the spiciness of the sandwich. \n\nWe finished off with the apple fritters, basically an apple donut hole with a little glaze.

My first double 5-star review for the same restaurant and the end of my search for a great breakfast sandwich in FiDi SF. Just had a sausage egg and cheese BISCUIT sandwich from the Bird and it was simply perfect. Nice salty crumbly but soft biscuit (I loathe the typical English muffin breakfast sandwich) with a nicely fried egg and gooey American cheese (PLEASE PLEASE for the love of god do not use any other cheese on a breakfast sandwich. I love sharp cheddar as much as the next person but it doesn't melt well and it should just be enjoyed solo).

The signage? Super retro cool. The employee's and service? Nice enough. I ordered a chicken biscuit and an egg, cheese and bacon biscuit for breakfast. The chicken was really greasy and not a good chunk of meat. I think Try should be more selective on what they put on that biscuit. The egg and bacon was good. By the second biscuit I was thinking they were too buttery, but then ignored myself. Runny egg over a thick piece of soft bacon. Good sandwich, but I came for the bird. \n\nFirst time visit I don't usually review, but this is SF and in a time where developers at Twitter can't afford to live here.

The spicy chicken sandwich, curly fries, and special curly fries are all really tasty and are unique in their own ways.\n\nThe chicken sandwich is great because the chicken is crisp, juicy, and has got some spiciness to it. I think the best part of it is the play with the sweetness and fresh crunch of the slaw and pickle. My bud and I both agree that the sandwich could use more slaw and/or pickle to bring better balance, although I can see how the owner would want to really emphasize that BIG piece of chicken in the sandwich.\n\nThe curly fries and special curly fries are delish and surprisingly taste quite different. Definitely get the sriracha+ketchup for these bad boys. The curly fries on their own are well seasoned and crisp. The special curly fries are smothered in sauce and bacon so you get a really rich creamy crunch when you eat them altogether mmmmmm\n\nAlready looking forward to coming back! Yum-o\n\nThe only problem I had with this place is that they have only one sign that says \"The Bird\" and it's on the ground on some crappy plastic sign next to the curb. Basically if you walk by looking at the storefront you'll miss this place. The storefront only has some cat holding a sandwich in its mouth everywhere.

Both were incredible and flavorful. Chicken was juicy. Generous thick slices of pickles and slaw with apples. Loved the homemade sriracha sauce, though it was more like a sambal oelek, which is probably why I loved it. I also love the curly fries. Glad they went with that instead of regular fries. Good packaging for to-go, sandwiches slipped into a nice foil sleeve for insulation. Some decently priced canned beers available too. Good amount of seating for 1-2 people parties. Long line during opening and lunch times, but no lines for dinner. Great place for dinner. Friendly owner. Nice inviting space.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

The line was about 20 or so people out the door, and it took me about 10 minutes to get my food and go.\n\nThe chicken sandwich was really good. They used thigh meat instead of the typical chicken breast, so expect a super juicy first bite. The apple slaw they used for the sandwich also was very tasty and helped cut the greasiness of the fried chicken.\n\nCurly fries were very good as well. If you don't want too big of a mess, I would highly recommend just getting the regular curly fries since they're still really good.\n\nMy only complaint was that since I'm a slower eater, by the time I got half way through my sandwich the bottom bun was already soggy from a combination of the apple slaw and the chicken. If there's a way to rearrange the toppings to keep the moisture towards the center, that would've really made a difference.", "author": "Andy H."}

The lines were really long when we came here for lunch but moves a lot faster than you'd expect.  Lines were sprawling out the door and we waited about 30 minutes before we placed an order because their menu is simple and the staff makes sure we are ready to order when we reach the counter.  My main complaint is that the loaded fries aren't really worth the price tag.  A $4 order gets you a little tray with some fries and sauces+toppings on top.

The chicken sandwich sounded like a great way to satisfy both those needs and it definitely did. I opted for the spicy chicken sandwich since the cashier said it wasn't too spicy, but man it was a killer in spiciness. My friend and I both ordered spicy and it made us both sweat a bunch. There was also a lot of spice oil dripping from my sandwich, which shows how spicy it was. We decided to share a side order of curly fries, which we both thought was pretty good for fries, but nothing special about it, so I'll probably pass on the curly fries next time. The loaded curly fries have sour cream, cheese, and bacon bits on it, but neither us like sour cream so we decided not to get it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-10-20", "description": "While the flavor was good, I think the rush of the crowd of being a new spot hastened the assembly of the burger, because it came to me pretty sloppy.  The fixings were sticking out all sides dripping with whatever sauce(s) they use and you pretty much need gloves to pick the thing up.  The crust on the chicken wasn't very crispy and, maybe it was all that sauce's fault, but was also coming off the meat.  Also, after biting into it the chicken breast was of different shades of color which concerned me of the cooking thoroughness.  \"Spicy\" is an option which I selected but don't think I received. Fortunately there's a house made sriracha that remedied that, but unfortunately that meant more sauce.\nFor almost doubling the price you can change your ordinary curly fries into \"Loaded Fries\"; \nDon't bother,  you get a dollop of sour cream that looks like it was shot putted into them from 5 feet away some chopped green onion and bacon bits which pretty much all just fell to the bottom.\nThey have however, much potential.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-21", "description": "Solid chicken sandwich, but could use some work. The meat had the classic southern flavor you want in a piece of fried chicken. The downside was that the chicken was rather stringy. Also, unlike many places, the chicken is not served as one breast, but as multiple pieces. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it did make it a little trickier to eat. A few tips for those not too chicken to try it:\n\n-Line is crazy long (around a 30 minute wait at noon), so get there close to 11am. The place has only been open for 3 days now (so I can understand the wait), but they only sell 200 sandwiches per day. Make sure to save yourself some heartbreak and get there early.\n-Pickles are there, but just barely- super-thinly sliced spear pickles. Do yourself a favor and ask for extra.\n-Pass on the loaded fries and save $1.50 with the classic curly fries.\n\nPlace has a nice vibe- very simple layout and furnishings.

First off, there is no street parking or lot for this building, which is inconvenient and such a pain! I almost gave up on searching for parking, but last minute was luckily to be able to get into a parking garage around the block (which was pricy at $8/hour). It can be tricky to spot this place from outside because they literally have no storefront sign. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich, which is apparently pretty popular here- the chicken itself was juicy and the level of spice was perfect for me. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of pickles so the pickled veggies/onions in it killed my vibe. The loaded fries were just OK - I did appreciate the bacon bits that topped it off. I do wish there was more cheese and sauce in the sandwich, but overall the flavor was alright. I definitely need to try the ice cream sandwich next time. I get full easily so I did get pretty stuffed from my meal and didn't even attempt at dessert. There were two ice cream options today: vanilla and wild berry. I went around 6pm (post-work time) so this place did get quite crowded fairly quickly.  But, I didn't mind because I was already seated at a table. However, it probably would have been unlikely to get a table here if I would have gone at a later time. I would not mind going back again, but it would also not be my first choice. Overall, this place is decent for what it is.", "author": "Mel B."}

But I should start from the beginning... I heard The Bird opened fairly recently in SOMA, so I finally scheduled a lunch day with my friend to go check it out.. and we were greeted by a not-so-friendly-length line which was nevertheless full of friendly people. It was a beautiful, sunny day out though and I was in no particular rush, so it wasn't too bad. When we finally got to the front, the server was friendly and full of energy; he seemed to enjoy working there. I ordered their signature chicken sandwich since I'm always a fan of a good chicken sandwich - I got the spicy one, to be more specific, which wasn't too spicy luckily. The chicken was sooo good - crispy and fried and juicy rolled into one. The price tag wasn't too bad either, for less than $10 in SF, and it wasn't difficult to find seats for 2 despite the busy-ness since there seems to be high customer turnover :) I'm looking forward to coming back soon for another go at their chicken sandwich, and maybe nibble my way to some sides too.", "author": "Bianca C."}

Soft, chewy, fluffy brioche bun stuffed with a crispy, juicy chicken and crunchy, refreshing slaw/pickles... honestly you can't complain. HOWEVER... the only complaint I have is that the chicken itself was a little dry, resulting in some tough, stringy chicken chews (no bueno). Otherwise the kick of that spice was on point -- spicy without being overpowering and still lending the chicken tons of flavor!! \n\nALSO.... this place serves curly fries instead of regular fries... which is ALWAYS a plus in my book :~) \n\nChicken sandwich is ~$8, fries are ~$2, so your meal ends up being ~$10!! Drink prices are great too!! Their happier hour special comes with a sandwich, fries, and a beer all for $12. AMAZING.", "author": "Gloria P."}

I waited until 2:00, which was a great call because at noon, forget it, the line is extra long and down the street. The line made me imagine this would be the best chicken sandwich EVER. \n\nYou walk in and the menu is very simple. I like that. Limited choices so of course it must be the best damn sandwich you've ever had in your life.  You can get a regular chicken sandwich or a spicy one. I opted for spicy because when I make them at home,  I dump on the Franks hot sauce. How great to get the spice built in, right? The sandwich is beautiful. Very crispy and the slaw has so many colors. I also like the texture of the bread. The spice was not enough for me,  but luckily they have homemade Sriracha sauce that I could dump on mine. \n\nIf you've ever had Bakesale Betty's fried chicken sandwich, this is presented very similarly. But sorry The Bird, Betty's is still the best in the Bay!  The chicken in Bird's was tough. I consistently couldn't take a clean bite,  because the chicken was stringy in places. Bakesale Betty's soaks theirs in buttermilk, which significantly softens the meat. I doubt they do anything like that at this spot. Secondly,  the meat wasn't flavored. Salt and pepper go a long way to add flavor before you bread it. All the seasoning seemed to be in the spiced breading. Finally,  the slaw had chunks of celery. It adds a nice crunch, but the flavor doesn't blend in cleanly,  so I think they could ditch the celery. This is my personal preference, though. The apple slaw and pickles are great. I also appreciate that they source local, free-range chicken. \n\nAfter 3pm, you can get a combo meal for $12.50 which includes the chicken sandwich, curly fries and a beer. That's pretty awesome and I'll have to come back for it. The atmosphere is clean and casual. \n\nKeeping in mind that my comparison is with Bakesale Betty, this spot is great for this neighborhood. It's a welcome addition and I'll definitely come back. Next time I'll try the regular sandwich. They also have a warm ice-cream sandwich. Can't wait to try that!", "author": "Demetri S."}

The chicken is extremely juicy and tender, it's not at all greasy or oily, and the bread is soft.  The portion is a perfect lunch-size portion so that I don't feel like I just ate a brick and need a nap.  The sandwich is also very well constructed so as to not be messy.\n\nPrice:\nThe best part of this is the price point.  The Bird now falls into the extremely select group of lunch spots in the area that give a quality lunch for under $10.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe staff seems to care quite a lot about how the customers are enjoying the food (which is always a great sign).  There is definitely room to sit and eat-in, but taking the food to-go is just as easy.\n\nWill absolutely be coming here regularly for lunch.", "author": "Cody C."}

You can probably get full on just the sandwich itself. I ordered loaded fries but they were kind of small and not really worth the price in my opinion.

I was excited simply because I was craving a good fried chicken sandwich \n\nFirstly, the line is crazy long, I went around 12:30 for lunch. You'll be in line for a bit. There's plenty of space to sit though, so that's good\n\nI ordered the spicy fried chicken sandwich, with loaded curly fries. I couldn't help myself, the loaded fries looked good. First thing I notice when I'm standing in line is that they've got a stack of already fried chicken cutlets sitting, drying... I was concerned because everybody knows you don't stack fried things on each other because it's hot and steamy and that makes the fry soggy... another thing is that, for the spicy they dunk it in a sauce and then let dry, stacked on each other... so my immediate thought was like it's gonna be soggy when I get my sandwich. Food comes fast. The sandwich is huge, it's a big fried chicken cutlet with a slaw... I was correct in that it was a little soggy, I didn't get a nice crunch, but it had a lot of flavor. It's honestly not spicy, more sweet and tangy if anything. I enjoyed it though. The meat was juicy not dry, it had a nice flavor, paired with loaded fries... yum. It's a lot of food so after that I felt like sleeping haha. Would I do it again? Sure... but I would go when it's hella busy so you know for sure the chicken isn't just sitting there getting soggy...", "author": "josephine v."}

Yes, worth the drive, the awful downtown traffic, and the time, and the parking hassle, and the waiting in line . . . it felt like a pilgrimage, and all for an $8 sandwich. Hands down the absolute tastiest, freshest, best heavenly fried chicken sandwich ever. I have NEVER in my life finished an entire sandwich; I usually cut it into a half, 1/3, or 1/4. But I sheepishly and defiantly admit that I ate the whole thing, every single morsel and crumb. The bun: baked in the morning, flaky and with a bit of crunch. The chicken super moist meat and fried with panache--not a whit greasy with the perfect breading. I got the \"plain\" and my husband got the \"spicy,\" which he loved. It comes piled high with red cabbage and tangy apple cole-slaw, an incredible mix of crunch and almost acts as a palate cleanser between bites. The bun's smeared with a bit of light mayo and 2 criss-cross pickle slices, which I took out, because I wanted the chicken experience with purity. Boy did I ever get in a zone with this sandwich--it felt like an intimate relationship. They only have curly fries, which I detest, and wish they had the regular . . . but frankly, who cares, cuz they do one thing and they do it better than anyone else. This is the benchmark for all other fried chicken sandwiches, and no other can live up to it. The price is more than right and reasonable for the quality and outstanding, astonishing flavor burst. It's a no frills interior and ambience, with aluminum stools and high chairs, wooden tables, order at the counter and pick-up. I kid you not, no joke: we order and turn around--in less than 30 seconds, we hear our name called and our entire order is ready! You'd think they had the stuff pre-made, right? Wrong. I peeked at the back of the kitchen, where this guy is flipping chicken with all the speed and fury of a pro, fresh off the griddle--turnover as high as any.

I was getting tired of the standard fare (we all know there are hundreds of places to eat, but not all are good or even up to standard, or the others are just out of the price range of a decent lunch). Now that the Bird opened, I love it. Its like having an alternative to that fast food chicken sandwich place that isn't allowed in SF. The sandwich itself was extremely crispy, the bun was fluffy and perfect. What I could live without was the grease that was permeating from the sandwich, it looked like a hot chili oil. It made me feel a little grossed out. Also I think the mayo was a little heavy for my taste, and I love mayo. I think next time I'll say no mayo and probably try the regular sandwich. For 8 dollars though, this isn't a bad place to have lunch. I would go back again. \n1 - 10.\nSandwich = 8\nFries = 4\nService = 6 (they got my  name wrong and didn't correct it even though they saw it was wrong.

The curly fries are nothing spectacular, but the spicy fried chicken sandwich is awesome!  Not all that spicy, but the portion of chicken is huge, its crispy, its juicy, and the accompanying slaw on the sandwich is a nice contrast of texture and acidity. Available condiments are ketchup or sriracha, or naturally, a sriracha ketchup blend. Right now they are only doing one thing, but they are doing it right!\n\nAlso noticed various beer options for $5 or less, which seems like a great deal in my book, especially for downtown.  Sandwich and fries will run you a little over $11 after tax, maybe a buck or two more if you want to tip.  But that's about par with most self respecting lunch spots in downtown, and the food to cost value seems reasonable when compared to other nearby places that are more expensive or just not as good. \n\nCan't wait to see what else they may add to the menu.  Hopefully it doesn't take away from what they clearly do so well.  My opinion would be to add some kind of salad option.  Fries, or loaded fries (which sound delicious), on top of a fried chicken sandwich, can be a bit too heavy.\n\nDefinitely will be back.", "author": "T. G."}

Menu says $6.50 for a salad, no indicator what the price to add chicken is. I order at the register, it's an extra $6.50 to add the chicken to the salad. So that means the price of a chicken salad is $13, compared to a chicken sandwich being just $8. I was fine with that, it seems like a similar price to what I pay at Mixt, but then I get the salad and 1) it's not mixed at all and there's no room in the container to mix it and 2) the blue cheese dressing I get is in a tiny ramekin and there's barely enough just to dunk the chicken tenders into, none extra to actually mix into the salad. So as soon as the guy hands me my salad with the tiny amount of blue cheese dressing, I ask him for an extra ramekin. He says no, that's an extra charge. And the line that I'd have to go through to order another ramekin of dressing is 20 people long. I pointedly look at the line and then look at the guy, waiting for him to say it's on the house just this time, but nope, he gives me no more dressing and the salad is gross because I don't have enough dressing for the lettuce.

I should have been more specific because I didn't want the egg or the cheese.  Just sausage and biscuit.  The biscuit and sausage were good.  The egg looked good but because they put liquid cheese on that side I couldn't eat it and it tasted horrible.  Not sure why a place that makes everything homemade puts what I think it is liquid Velveeta on a breakfast sandwich.  It was gross.  I will try it again and be more specific on what I want.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-07-15", "description": "As a southerner living in the bay area I wanted to like the Bird. It has some real issues though. I got a spicy chicken sandwich. To start with the spicy is just a dunk in some spicy sauce, that is basically flavorless, so no idea if the breading is any good or not. Slaw was ok. But the biggest downside here is the cut of meat being used. Now I enjoy chicken thigh in lieu of breast, since it is a tastier cut, but this shit was 50% fat. If you enjoy eating deep friend chicken fat sandwiches then this place is the shit. I am betting though that it's too much fat for most people since I heard 3 other customers complaining about it on their way out. On the bright side the curly fries are decent enough. But for $30 for two lunches I'd like more than tasty curly fries and a sandwich that I had to leave 50% of it behind. Also I'm very confused how any poster could compare Bakesale Betty's sandwich to this. Bakesale Betty's sandwich, while not the best, is a solid choice in comparison to the Bird's offerings.", "author": "Sally M."}

Somehow there was a misunderstanding and we only got one order (sandwich and fries) but the staff/management took it upon themselves to correct it immediately AND offered us a hot ice cream sandwich.  Since I am lactose intolerant, I opted for another order of fries.  But the gesture meant so much!  Thank you!", "author": "Jamie M."}

Was looking forward to tasting the vinegar slaw but the spice from chicken was too much. I like spicy but it was too much. Curly fries were perfect. Will try the regular chicken next time.", "author": "Tiffany H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-12-08", "description": "Tried the spicy sandwich.  The meat was tender and juicy, the breading was good and crunchy, the seasoning was like someone just shoved an entire bag of bar-b-que chips in my mouth.  Crunchy sugar and B-B-Q flavor.  The slaw was a bit bland next to it (maybe some more lemon juice or rice vinegar??).  Not really worth the gut pain and calories.  Cute place and I wish them luck!", "author": "Jennifer D."}

I got the classic sandwich with the loaded fries and I will definitely come back. Chicken was juicy, full of flavor, and definitely worth the price! What a great concept and idea to just serve a few items on menu as sometimes less is more!", "author": "D W."}
