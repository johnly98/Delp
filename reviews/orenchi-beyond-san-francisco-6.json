Since I moved to SF I decided to give the Valencia location a shot. \n\nMy love for Orenchi's original tonkotsu shio broth has been since the first time I've sipped on their salty buttery goodness.\n\nThis location lived up to the Orenchi's legacy. Had their original ramen while my brothers had the tonkotsu shoyu Orenchi Beyond. Both broths was delicious. 5/5\n\nHad the kaarage and it tasted more delicious to me because they left the skin of the chicken on and I liked that the lightly dusted flour wasn't as salty as the original location the chicken was still marinated and flavorful especially w the squeeze of lemon! 4.5/5\n\nOf course also had to have the takoyaki, although not traditionally made like in Japan. The exterior was fried and a little greasier than I would've liked but still tasty w the bonito flakes, I would've appreciated a more chunky octopus inside however still tasty. 3.5/5\n\nIf you must have ramen please check them out you won't regret it!", "author": "Victoria U."}

What happened? I was so excited to try this branch as I had spent countless days frequenting its Santa Clara counterpart - the original parent - Orenchi (as is) Ramen. No extra frills. No need to go Beyond what is already good. \n\nAnticipation, high hopes and dreams of the rich tonkotsu broth blending against that crunch of the chicken karaage had set the expectation for my first encounter at...Orenchi Beyonddd. As if it is a galaxy far far away in the stretches of George Lucas' mind - on a planet of hot souptopia with thin noodlians and thick noodlens alike living in peace and harmony.  But noooooo enter the salt bomb!! Flee for your life!!!!!\n\nAnd that sort of describes, in short, my experience at Orenchi Beyond.  I just could not get Beyond all the salt in the ramen. The saltiness overpowered everything... the broth, the vegetables, the noodles.   I really hoped to taste the natural tomato broth but was so distracted - I could not taste anything but salt.  Was it because I got \"too cute\" and ventured to try something new - the vegan ramen?  I am left wondering.\n\nThe one redeeming factor is the friendly service and well decorated atmosphere.  I also like that this restaurant is accommodating for parties of one. \n\nOrenchi Beyond, please hear my plea to return from far far Beyond - be proud of your original Orenchi ways and the Bay Area ramen heritage you represent.", "author": "Vivienne K."}

I will say I enjoyed the hint of crisp in it though, we didn't ask but believe it to me parts of edamame.  It really gave it some good texture.\n\nThe Ramen gets a 4/5 stars: (we got the Orenchi Ramen w/pork broth. itself was delicious.)  The broth is so rich.  The pork chashu was okay, it was tender but very very fatty.  I wish there was a little more meat and less fat.  Definitely not the best cut!   The noodles are so bouncy and yummy.  I really enjoy Orenchi's noodles.  I love the seaweed crisp included, the mushrooms, and bamboo shoots gave it a really good taste.  I added corn as well which I always do to give the ramen a satisfying crunch!  I wish Orenchi had an option to add fried garlic chips... that would really make this ramen a lot more enjoyable.

I wouldnt mind eating here again.  \n\nNot the best ramen I've ever had, but it's still very satisfying =)\n\nNo issues with service or waiters.

It was my first time trying dipping noodle, and it was sooo good! The soup was very rich and not salty at all. It is slightly spicy but not unbearable. I would recommend finishing it up fast though if you do get that because towards the end the food gets a little cold since the noodles and the meat are not soaked in the broth. The Beyond Ramen was also awesome! The garlic taste opens up your palate right away.

You serve delicious vegan ramen.

But really, I've been eating so much ramen lately that I honestly don't need to eat fattening, creamy broth all of the time, so this is a good option!\n\nAnyway, I received my eggplant-free ramen and was happy to see the bowl was loaded with some other veggies, such as cauliflower, tomatoes, bell peppers, etc. The noodles used also appear to be rice noodles, which were actually a good idea. The broth was well-flavored and you also have the option of loading your dish up with some garlic (a jar of it is on the table). But if you like spicy (like me) don't order the spicy miso paste. Upon my inquiry they let me know the miso paste has fish in it. There are some spices on the table though...or you can sneak in some sriracha or your preferred vegan hot sauce/peppers (share ideas with me!). I promise I have not done that...yet.

One piece of pork that has so much flavor. Broth is rich but kind of fatty for my taste but so good!!! Egg is perfectly cooked. Some veggies in it like bamboo shoot.

I had first experienced them via the South Bay location and they were one of the first nice ramen places in the city. \n\nI really like the Orenchi ramen and the hubby LOVES the Beyond Ramen (which is rich and strong and not for the faint of heart). However, the I find the Orenchi ramen which is quite rich can be a bit more than I'm looking for.  So, I was glad when they introduced the Shio chicken soba -- it is light and delicate, but delicious. \n\nThere have since been many ramen places in the city and my favorite when judging on ramen alone would probably be Marufuku or Ramen Dojo. But, in terms of overall experience, Orenchi Beyond is my favorite!  They do great appetizers which makes it an amazing overall experience and brings a bit more variety than one big bowl of ramen. \n\nThey do the best tako yaki and chicken karaage is any Japanese restaurant in the Bay. The misomayo chasu gohan is super delicious and now a great alternative when I'm not quite ready for an Orenchi ramen but looking for something more substantial than the tori soba. \n\nThe gyoza was ok, but I'd probably pass next time. Too much sesame flavor and filling was too soft for my liking.", "author": "Kathryn C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-10", "description": "Recently, my girlfriend and I decided made it our goal to scour the Bay Area for the best ramen shop. Personally, out of all the places that we have tried, we really dig Orenchi Ramen in Santa Clara. Because of how good their ramen was, we were excited to hear that there was a sibling restaurant in the city by virtually the same name: Orenchi Beyond. According to one of my dear Yelp friends (Christine), \"Comparing Orenchi Beyond to the original Orenchi in Santa Clara is like comparing your current boyfriend to the last guy you were in love with\" Because of that, we had to try this place and settle the score on whether this city version of Orenchi was better.\n\nOrenchi beyond is located near the corner of Duboce the Valencia. It is extremely close to the 101 AND the 16th & Mission Bart, and so I give this place props for the convenient location. Parking may suck here on high traffic hours, but we were able to pull up on the street nearby (free parking after 6 on weekends!). Luckily, we came at a good time and were seated immediately.\n\nThe first amazing thing I noticed about this restaurant was that the atmosphere is as good as I'd want from a hip, ramen shop. For one, there's a giant TV outside for people waiting in line. And, there's a YUGE projector inside for people who want to eat and watch anime. AND, there's no wall between you and the kitchen, so you get a bird's eye view of the magic. Plus, if you like eating in dim lighting, this place is perfect.\n\nOn their menu, which was average sized for a ramen shop, we were only interested in their two top ramens: the soy sauce (Shio Beyond) and the salted ramen (Orenchi), which you can find at the Santa Clara location. We both got large (+$2), with an extra side of chasu since it was free with Yelp check-in. \n\nRamen came out pretty fast, which was a good bonus since the restaurant was kind of busy. The first impression I got from my large soy sauce bowl was that this was mighty salty. The broth was very flavorful and I thought that the meat was tender enough (though it could've been juicer), but dang, that soup was salty. I made a joke with my girlfriend that my Beyond ramen was probably just as salty as the salted, Orenchi ramen.\n\nIn terms of portion size, I thought the large size was mostly just noodles instead of actual ingredients. But I have to say that we were full after engulfing our bowls. To tell you the truth, I personally prefer my experience at Orenchi Ramen in Santa Clara because the soup was less salty and i felt that the quality of the noodles was better. My girlfriend preferred this place only because it was saltier, but to each their own!\n\nOverall, I had an okay experience at Orenchi Beyond. Sure, I think the ramen was filling, but you will need several glasses of water to drown out that saltiness. The price point was decent, compared to how much ramen can cost in the city, but I have definitely had better. The selling point for this place for me was the atmosphere. Because of the ambiance, I am leaning more toward a \"Nice-su, can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating!\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

The broth - which is key to a good bowl of ramen - was just not that flavorful, mostly salty.  It did not have that great depth of flavor and body that other better-developed broths possess.  It was missing the \"it\" factor.  \n\nAt over $13 for a bowl, I wasn't loving the price much either.  \n\nWould I come back here?  Nope.

The decor at Orenchi Beyond is pretty hipster, with exposed wood and picnic table style seating, definitely not your traditional Japanese ramen restaurant.\n\nI was pretty disappointed though. This SF offshoot of the original Orenchi in South Bay doesn't measure up at all. The chicken karaage was too oily and left a little puddle of oil on the plate. The Orenchi ramen itself had good components -- good noodles, soft boiled egg, meat was decent -- but the broth wasn't super flavorful and dimensional.\n\nAll in all, maybe good for a quick ramen stop in the mission but not the best.", "author": "Tiffany P."}

I will never forget the time how I was starving and had to wait 2 hours for food. The longer it took, the higher my expectations. So with it being close to 1:30pm, I was about to rip somebody apart. \n\nAnyways, this is Orenchi Beyond. I shouldn't compare apples to oranges. I'll give Orenchi Beyond its fair treatment. For a Sunday evening, there was no wait. Although I love the no wait, there's something iffy about it. The number one ramen in SF is the Beyond Ramen. It doesn't come with an egg, so I added the egg. Orenchi is ALL about the egg. \n\nIt comes out pretty fast with the broth piping hot. I love it. The broth is pretty fatty, but lacked umami flavor. The noodles had a weird texture and it was not al dente. I'm unable to grasp what the missing factor was, but it was okay. The saving factor was the egg as I previously mentioned. The egg is flavored well with a runny middle. I probably could eat five of those in one sitting. Not a joke. \n\nI guess I'll come back here. I mean, there's no wait and it's not terribly bad.

New flavors, new experiences! And they got a good chunk of my wallet, cause I just can't resist trying a bunch of items when I go someplace new. \n\nBut enough about me, you're here to hear about orenchi. I actually was really surprised to see they're only 3 stars here. Orenchi is one of those places you hear about a lot from friends and \"200 bucket list restaurants in SF\" lists and etc. I was eager to see the reality. \n\nOf course there's a line. I waited about 20min on a rainy Tuesday, and I didn't have anyone with me. But so it goes with awesome small places. \n\nLet's talk food and drink and flavors - the core of a restaurant. This time I went for orenchi ramen (start with the namesake, right?), large, with extra long onions and roasted pork. Then add on their draft sake (sequoia nama), and a peach chu-hi.\n\nAnd you know? This might be sacrelig, but I think I prefer genki. Their extra noodles and extra richness and lower prices (not to mention less wait time) really go the extra mile. But this was still a fantastic treat. At first I was kinda disappointed, but with each bite the flavor built, until I couldn't stop. Such a great combination of savory and salty without being overwhelming. \n\nYou know what else is cool? The severs - way helpful and nice. Oh and that they take reservations. But ESPECIALLY that they have happy hour! Happy hours at popular places are about as common as buffalo in SF (they exist! But you mostly just hear stories). $3 chu-Hi? And it goes until 730?! Amen to that! A must-repeat next time I'm back. \n\nAll that fun does come at a price. For me, it was $33 before tip...up there, and though it would have been around $12 without booze or extras, it's still more expensive than many places. \n\nSo, is it my favorite ramen place in SF? No, but it is fantastic. We are spoiled here. I definitely won't complain if someone brings me back here - I just won't put it on my OWN list of \"must do\" SFteraunts.", "author": "Chris S."}

Food is great if not practically the same as Santa Clara (some ramen snobs will say otherwise) but the atmosphere and experience at this place are so much better.\n\nFirst off, they accept reservations - yes a ramen place that accepts reservations. Unlike Orenchi Ramen where you have to fight to get your name on the waiting list and hope it's not a 1 hr wait... Orenchi Beyond accepts Yelp reservations online. Thank god. Some people have a schedule to keep and can't wait absurdly long to get ramen.\n\nBecause of reservations, drop-ins might be hard especially if you're a group of 4 or more. HOWEVER... while you wait outside, you can order drinks and appetizers at their outdoor bar. It's a stand up place and there's only a rock to sit at, but it's something. PLUS they have heat lamps outside for waiting. There's even a TV outside... I kept getting distracted by the Hunger Games II movie that was playing at the time.\n\nAlso, this space is just much cooler than the Orenchi in Santa Clara. Interesting furniture and they have a projector that seems to play amusing Asian music videos... can't tell if K-Pop or J-Pop, but it's at least entertaining.\n\nOrenchi's strength is the broth - it's very rich and savory. The noodles are OK, but the broth and their perfectly soft boiled egg are what make the ramen shine here. There are plenty of reviews that echo my opinion. Not in the mood for ramen? I can vouch that the appetizers and rice bowls are extremely delicious as well.\n\n- Salmon Ikura Rice Bowl: I'm not sure how this can be a side to ramen... considering their ramen bowls are pretty big and filling here. But the rice bowls are delicious and perfectly portioned for small eaters - loved the flaked salmon and the generous amount of fish roe, and very filling despite the small slide! I'd recommend asking for some Japanese mayo on the side to pour on top of this - great combination!\n\n- Negi-Toro Rice Bowl: Also very good, but I prefer the salmon ikura - the tuna on this was oddly dry in this. Maybe it needed some Japanese mayo to liven it up?\n\n- Tonkatsu Fries: Basically a pork cutlet that's been pre-sliced and fried up individually. The concept was neat and the sauce it came with was delicious... it has this amazing spicy kick.\n\n- Deep Fried Garlic: Indeed it is deep fried... and the garlic flavor is intense! It comes with this miso aoili sauce that compliments it really well.\n\nOrenchi Ramen in Santa Clara is not worth the unreasonable 45 - 2 hr wait. The ramen is good... but it's not the most amazing in the world. And honestly, in the 2 hrs I wait for a table at Orenchi Ramen... I'm better off making the effort to go here.

Inspite of the reviews that the ramen is salty, I chose this place for us to eat lunch. It was Monday and there was no wait. Six of us were anticipating to eat good ramen. First we ordered appetizers. Salmon sashimi was really good, the raw salmon was fresh. I liked the chicken karaage, fried pork sticks and I love their fried oysters. I didn't like the takoyaki, a bit salty for me. Now, for the ramen, I had the Orenchi original. It has one small thin slice pork belly, an egg, bamboo shoot strips, pieces of mushrooms, other stuff I donot recall and a lot of ramen noodles which was way too al dente, a bit firm but edible. The soup or the broth, the very reason for this ramen to be delicious and satifying was really salty. It ruined the taste of the soup. I ate only the solid ingredients there in, ate half of the noodles and didn't care for the broth. The only good thing in it was the seasoned soft boiled egg which was perfect.\nThe two of us who ordered Orenchi original both agreed the soup was salty. Two others ordered Spicy Beyond ramen said theirs was ok. The Seafood Special ramen was ok as well but, I don't think it's worth $18 bucks for the few pieces seafood it has.\nFor my conclusion, I cannot recommend this place if you're looking for good quality ramen. I will not be coming back to eat here, I do not like salty ramen.\nFyi, they already charge tip on your bill so check the info on your 1st receipt. I paid with credit card and when they brought back the receipt to be sign, this one doesn't show detailed info but I knew that the tip was already been added on the total. So read and check what you're about to pay unless you would like to give more tip.", "author": "Marlen B."}

This is their second store, their original ramen shop in Santa Clara, which I've never trekked to since it's so far! But I'm glad they opened in SF. I'm surprised this place doesn't have a solid 4 stars, as I think this place is a bit better than other ramen shops with 3.5 stars (aka Men Oh, Waraku).\n\nI've been here a few times, and always get their regular special \"Orenchi Ramen\" which is their original, from their home store in Santa Clara. For $13.50, you get a medium-sized Tonkatsu broth bowl with pork belly, soft-boiled egg, green onion, bamboo shoot, mushroom, sesame, and seaweed. You can check in on yelp and get 1 extra topping for up to $2. I added in the corn, but to be honest they didn't add much in, a bit of a bummer. I love this ramen in particular, because their noodles are cooked just the way I like it - they are on the slightly thicker side, and chewy. This is my preference, and I can't say yours is the same way! But this is the way I love my ramen! The broth was also great - salty and flavorful. \n\nWe also got the spicy negi gohan, and tonkatsu sticks for appetizers. The spicy negi gohan is basically spicy yellowtail fish with mayo and green onions over rice. So simply, but also so amazing! We also loved the tonkatsu sticks. Just think of fishsticks, but instead TONKATSU. Dipping sauce is the great tonkatsu sauce too. Just so delicious! Super fatty pieces too.\n\nThey have Hitachino Beer on tap too for $9, which is fun. I've never really seen Hitachino beer on tap, so it was neat to see it. \n\nService is always great - they are always very friendly and prompt.

Thank you for bringing your delicious ramen all the way from South Bay up to the city. Now, if Chick-fil-A would follow suit, I would never need to drive south again.\n\nI actually prefer Orenchi Beyond to the original Orenchi but only because the wait I've become accustomed to in Santa Clara is nonexistent in San Francisco. Hold up. What? Awesome ramen AND no wait? What a perfect combination.\n\nThe ramen itself is great. There actually aren't many choices which isn't a bad thing. I've had the Beyond Ramen, Orenchi Ramen, and the Tori Soba.\n\nIf you're feeling something \"light\" I would recommend the buckwheat Tori Soba with its clear broth. It's not as rich and still quite enjoyable.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for real ramen, I'd go with the Orenchi Ramen. You might be tempted to go with the Beyond Ramen since it's unique to this location, but the main difference is that with the Orenchi Ramen, you get a soft boiled seasoned egg. Fortunately, both bowls include their incredibly tender pork belly.\n\nAt the end of the day, the most \"wow\" bowl of ramen you'll have in San Francisco is probably at Izakaya Sozai in Inner Sunset. However, the wait there can get ridiculous and at the end of that ramen bowl, the flavor gets to be too much and becomes a bit too salty.

It is *not* served with soy sauce, which at first I raised an eyebrow to, but once I tried the dish with wasabi only, I could see why. It didn't need soy; that would have hidden the flavors and it was balanced without it.\n\nThe daikon salad came with bonito flakes that gave it a nice smokiness, it was really pleasant and refreshing. My wife had the good idea to save some of it to eat alongside the ramen and it made a nice compliment that way.\n\nThe battered fish was perhaps the least novel, but it was still tasty, and it came with wasabi salt for dipping.\n\nSome of the other reviews complain of weak ramen broth but that wasn't our experience. It was rich and flavorful. And the tables all have little bowls of garlic puree available if you need some extra oomph. We added a dollop and it was great. The noodles were perfectly chewy and all the fixings were fresh and nicely prepared.

The food is good, however not mind blowing. The price is very affordable but you definitely pay for what you get. The meat portions are very small and bowls pretty small as well. If you're in the neighborhood and have a hankering for some soup, give this place a shot. I would not recommend as a super great Ramen house but it definitely satisfies your craving", "author": "Michelle K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-21", "description": "When Jamie W. and I were coming back to the city from a weekend in Monterey, I stopped by the original Santa Clara location of Orenchi only to see a crowd of twenty-something Asians waiting for tables and busily texting each other in front of the modest strip mall storefront. One look and Jamie refused to wait for a bowl of ramen there, perhaps flashing back to the disastrous Ramen Yokocho Festival where three-hour waits were the norm. We ended up going to the nearly L&L Hawaiian Barbecue and I got indigestion from the worst bowl of saimin ever served to mankind. That lapse only whet my appetite even more when Kuniko Ozawa decided to open a location in San Francisco late last year.\n\nI heard about ridiculous lines when it opened, so I didn't even think about going there until recently when I got off work early and bolted over here. I shouldn't have bothered since they don't open until 6PM where I had nothing to do but sign my name on the sheet and sit on the boulder in front since it was raining. People would walk by and ask me when it was opening. Do I look like I work here or something? OK, maybe I do but still... Anyhow, when the young server did open the front door, she pointed me to the counter which only made sense since it probably took about fifteen minutes for the place to fill up. I perused the menu and noticed they serve only two ramen bowls and two soba bowls. Most of the toppings were extra though I didn't even think strategically about the composition of my order.\n\nHowever, before having the ramen, I thought an appetizer was in order, so I went with the $7 Ankimo Ponzu since I've been a sucker for monkfish liver ever since I had mounds of it at the just-closed Ino Sushi. There were only four slices in this order, and they were topped with tobiko and nestled on a bed of chopped green onion marinated in ponzu (photo: http://bit.ly/1gFsBXu). It was delicious, of course, but it was also gone in about three minutes flat no matter how hard I tried to look like a sushi connoisseur. My ramen of choice turned out to be the $12 Orenchi Beyond since I figured I should go with the namesake bowl. I passed by the bubbling vats of full-bodied broth through the window when I passed by from the men's room.\n\nI just presumed that was the tonkotsu ambrosia that I heard was the talk of the ramen aficionados (photo: http://bit.ly/1V4WsGt). When it arrived, I have to admit the broth was superb, very thick and flavorful without being obnoxious. It came with the bare minimum ingredients - al dente ramen noodles, one slice of pork belly (which to quote Amy Schumer, is like taking one Advil...why?), a bamboo shoot, fried garlic, a smattering of green onion and mizuna with a decorative square of nori (photo: http://bit.ly/1Lr3K6x). The server suggested I add an egg for $1.20, but what I really wanted was the $5.30 Mega Cha-Shu which would have added six slices of roast pork.\n\nI learned my lesson that a true bowl is closer to $20, but still, it was quite tasty and worth savoring every drop of that broth. It was a good thing I added a $6.50 order of the Nankotsu Karaage which they billed graphically as 'chicken cartilage' (photo: http://bit.ly/1V4Wfmx). Remember that I'm the guy that orders the fried chicken gizzards at Harold's Fried Chicken on the South Side of Chicago. There aren't many of us around that enjoy the chew of good cartilage, and as it turned out, it was a suitable substitute for all the missing pork. Believe it or not, I was tempted to get a $4.20 bowl of Shishito Age as I saw the blistered padron peppers pass by, but I held back for a change. Tasty stuff. Worth the hype? I'll let you know after my next visit.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...a richly luxuriant tonkotsu broth stands out here and the rest was pretty good, too\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...an open modern space that crowds quickly like a Tokyo subway car\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...emphasis on efficiency doesn't leave much room for a personal touch, come at 6PM sharp if you don't want to wait\nTOTAL - 4 stars...nice to know that a half-day trek to Santa Clara won't be necessary anymore", "author": "Ed U."}

There were people that were waiting when we sat down that were still waiting when we left LOL. \n\nThey have two options for ramen: Beyond (Shoyu base) and Orenchi (Shio base). My entire table got the Beyond ramen so I didn't get to try the Orenchi, although based on Yelp reviews the Beyond is better. It was $13 for a normal size bowl which comes with a decent portion of noodles, one slice of meat, one sheet (??) of seaweed, green onions, and bamboo shoots. You have the option to add egg/noodles/other toppings. It's a little pricey for what you get but it's SF so no surprises here. \n\nThe broth is super flavorful without being too oily/heavy/thick, and the noodles are SO GOOD. They're thicker than the usual ramen noodles but they're also chewier which is nice. I didn't get an egg but my friend did and he said it was amazing, so it might be worth the extra $1.50. Our table also got two appetizers to share: Geso Karaage (Squid Tentacle Calamari) and some Avocado/Tuna/Wasabi thing.

They accidentally made a large size bowl for me (didn't charge) of my Orenchi ramen.  He got the beyond ramen.  Only difference seemed that in exchange for an extra pork slice (his said belly but looked the same as my Cha su) was that they mixed an egg, his broth was more peppery though.  Both broths were Tonkatsu based.  My egg was overcooked and his that he had to pay extra for was perfectly runny.  Noodles were fine.  Both were very fatty/greasy as well.  So fatty that my stomach hurt pretty soon after throughout the day into the night until I was able to drink tea at home.  \n\nThis place is so overhyped.  They spent all of their focus making it look trendy and playing cool music that they forgot about the food.  I've been to mediocre ramen places that served up better ramens.

Didn't even know I could! \n\nWe just started digging into the Chicken karaage and Takoyaki when counter seats opened. Pretty short wait overall. The chicken was so good. There are just a couple ramen options and they both have Tonkotsu broth. I had the Orenchi for the soft boiled egg. It's incredibly flavorful but I don't mind a little extra salt. Those more sensitive to it may find it overwhelming. Extra garlic is available on the tables too. It  was definitely one of the better ramen bowls I've had in SF.", "author": "Samantha L."}

Because THEY WILL SKIP YOU for their friends, and be shady about it saying they were here first. \n\nThat's right, caught you Orenchi Beyond.  \n\nThey will also say it's 20 minute wait but turn out to be 45 minutes wait.  My group of 4 had to get the counter because they gave our table to their friends that clearly came after us.  Rude.  I mean if you want to do that fine, but not on a busy Saturday night.  That's just inconsiderate to the group of people already waiting.  \n\nAnyway, that's why they don't get more than 3 stars.  The ramen itself was pretty good and the egg was soft boiled, however the place itself is very expensive.  I liked the Beyond Ramen more than the Orenchi Ramen since it has fried garlic, so I added an extra egg, $1.50 extra so the ramen is $13.50.  And large sake is like $16. Pricey, esp since it doesn't even get you buzzed. But you're welcome to spend more on alcohol, which they do promote since the bar is also connected outside for those waiting for a table. \n\nOVERALL: Good hipster ramen joint for SF, but the shady service with the already long wait deterred me from really liking this place.

How long did you think the wait was going to be? \n\nMy entire adventure at this venue took 3 hours. Yup, 3 hours. Around 2 hours waiting for a group of 6 and about less than a hour to get our order. Bring fun company and time will fly.\n\nThe atmosphere was something to rave on. Beautiful interior design, an awesome wall painting, and the hip-hop music gave this establishment a breath of fresh air and a nice contemporary look and feel.\n\nWe had a mix-up with our appetizers, but the issue was quickly addressed by management and our server. \n\nThe Spicy Chicken Wings were good, but it wasn't the best I've had. I wish the temperature was a bit warmer and the flavor a bit stronger. Overall, a decent appetizer I would feel hesitant ordering again. Felt like it was left out for awhile before it was served. As for the Spicy Fries, meh. Forgettable and not worth ordering again.\n\nI ordered a Large Orenchi Ramen ($12.00 + $1.50) and was relatively content with the dish. The noodles were on point and yum. They were chewy. My favorite. The broth had a delicious and flavorful taste too. I had doubts at first, but after a few more spoonfuls, I was satisfied. You could tell it took a long time to make. \n\nThe Chashu though.. was way too thin and definitely needed more work. I wasn't impressed and the flavor needed improvement. And there was barely any in my bowl! Guess the struggle is real for the economy if you have to pay over $13 bucks for a bowl of ramen with only one slice of chashu meat. Maybe I should have shelled over the extra $2 bucks. \n\nBut the egg... let me tell you about the soft-boiled egg! It was mouthwatering delicious! Perfectly cooked and runny. Mhmmm. Perhaps the best part of the meal? I took a bite and soaked it back in the broth.. took it out... and let's just it was orgasmic. Then again, I was waiting over 2 hours for food. I might have just been famished and hungry. \n\nAs far as service goes, this place was hit and miss. Sometimes the other servers were attentive, sometimes they weren't. We were fortunate enough and got a pretty awesome server named Rob. He gave us the rundown of the menu, fixed our orders and was an all-around excellent waiter. If management is reading this, this man definitely deserves a raise. He checked up on us quite frequently and dang, this guy took a pretty rad selfie for our group! \n\nOverall, this place served up a relatively decent ramen bowl. However, the wait time does not justify the dish and I wouldn't wait again.. especially during peak hours. Until next time, Orenchi Beyond!", "author": "Chinsin S."}

We zoomed on over and easily found (free) metered parking on the street. \n\nFair warning - the restaurant is a little hard to find since it's tucked about 5-7 feet away from the usual store front and curb, but once you do find it, it's hard to miss. We were greeted \"irasshaimase\" which means \"welcome\" in Japanese by all the workers including the chefs. Walking inside feels like you're walking into an art gallery - the ceilings are high, the kitchen has a glass encasing, and even the tables have Japanese themed art work on them. It's dimly lit but not so dark that you feel like you're entering a sketchy club. \n\nWe were given menus and promptly ordered. They only have two types of ramen: 1) Orenchi $13 // Tonkotsu based soup // Toppings: Pork Belly, Soft Boiled Seasoned Egg, Green Onion, Bamboo Shoot, Mushroom, Sesame, Dried Seaweed\n\n2) Beyond $13 // Tonkotsu based soup // Toppings: Pork Belly, Green Onion, Bamboo Shoot, Sesame, Dried Seaweed, Fried Garlic, Mizuna (http://www.orenchi-beyond.com/)\n\nI personally had the beyond ramen and boyfriend ordered the orenchi ramen so we could sample both. My favorite between the two was the beyond ramen. For some reason, the broth seemed more flavorful compared to the orenchi. \n\nWe also ordered the spicy karaage $8 and it wasn't your normal karaage either which is boneless bits of chicken and spice. No, these are actual chicken wings. I'd definitely pass on these - flavor is too strong and it was too sour for my liking.\n\nAll in all, a good place to add to your rotation of acceptable ramen places in the city. Definite plus that they are open even later on the weekends for us hard workers that work late into the evening.\n\nPro Tip: They allow you to modify a few things for your ramen -- how cooked or uncooked your noodles are and how salty your broth is.", "author": "Kathleene E."}

We got lucky because we found a spot right in front but it's metered in some sections so pay attention to where you are parking.\n\nATMOSPHERE: It's more \"open\" than the original and has a bar-tokyo trendy japanese restaurant feel.  They have these cut outs where you can order beer and other drinks while waiting.  The rest of the wall looks like it's cut out but there is glass covering it so you don't freeze while eating inside.  You can also see the kitchen cooking the ramen with huge vats of the broth and noodles. \n\nThe wait isn't that long because it's not super popular yet.  We came on a Friday night and for 4 of us waited about 30 minutes.  We could have gotten seated earlier if we were willing to sit at the bar.  They have a high bar that wraps around the restaurant and then low tables with wooden stumps that hurt your butt after a while.  One great thing is that they have purse hooks for you!\n\nThey play loud old school r&b and hip hop with other 70s pop etc.  It isn't super loud but it is ambiant.\n\nFOOD: they have the typical appetizers, regular orenchi ramen and then their beyond ramen as well as soba.\n\nBEYOND RAMEN: Tonkotsu broth (like the original) but infused with soy flavor.  It reminded me more of Halu's broth so not as creamy/porky but still good.  My mom said it was too salty but I thought it was perfect.  Also a good garlic flavor.   The noodles were harder and chewier than regular orenchi but still the same size.  I also feel like the egg wasn't as flavored.  \n\nCHICKEN KARAAGE and CHICKEN WINGS: Chicken wings had a great sweet/salty seasoned sauce and was juicy.  Karaage was a little dry and burnt but still tasty and tasted like the original trench's karaage.\n\nOverall - with less of a wait and if you're in SF it's a great alternative.

You'll always long for the company that you thought was your one true love, but you feel like you have to settle for what is in front of you. Well, \"settle\" might not be the right word because your current boyfriend is probably freaking awesome too. \n\nComparing Orenchi Beyond to the original Orenchi in Santa Clara is like comparing your current boyfriend to the last guy you were in love with. They're both awesome, but you definitely upgraded with the newer model.\n\nLocated in the Mission area, David C., Allen C., and I made the trip to Orenchi Beyond quite early (like 5pm early). They open at 6pm, but we wanted to be the first in line! Although there are tons of bars/lounges nearby, Marcus took care of us by supplying us with Sapporo ($18/pitcher). Time does fly by when you're drinking with good company. By 5:30pm, a crowd full of people eagerly waiting to try Orenchi Beyond formed. With 42 seats in the restaurant, you bet everyone wanted to be in the first wave!\n\n- Karaage.. fried chicken ($7.80): they use dark meat (which I prefer) and it was quite delicious!\n- Shishito Age.. fried green pepper ($4.20): first time trying this and it was interesting! Some were more sweet, and another kicked me in the mouth.\n- Beyond Ramen ($12): add an egg for $1.20. Broth was flavorful, egg was orgasmic, and the noodles were what stole the show!\n\nFor a very busy dinner service, I was actually surprised that our servers were on top of their game! Food came at a timely manner, and our servers were polite, helpful, and fun to chat with. \n\nOne of the big pluses of this location (vs the Santa Clara one) is the availability of alcohol. (And I think alcohol plays a big part when you are waiting 1+ hours for food.) If you don't want to drink at the bar, there are plenty of bars around the area. What does the Santa Clara location have? Oh yeah, a crappy grocery store next door. \n\nWould I wait more than an hour to dine here? Sober Christine says, \"hell no\".

Unfortunately they only serve miso and soy broth. I ordered their soy while my boyfriend tried their miso. His broth was slightly saltier than average and mine...just didn't seem like soy. Isn't soy suppose to be darker?

I can't do anything over a 15-20 minute wait anymore. I GET HANGRY!!!!!!!\n\nI'm going to have to say 3.75  I ordered a ginger ale while the bf had a beer. Thought my ginger ale tasted funky. He tried it and said it tasted weird as well, but I thought if they're making it in house that could be the reason why. Ehhhh after careful inspection of Yelp photos, I realized they gave me an uemeshi ginger cocktail. NO WONDER! BF paid so I didn't even see the itemized bill this time but I am sure it was a cocktail. And in case you're wondering, that drink was not good. \n\nOn to the food.\n\nStarted off with tako wasabi. I love tako wasabi. At Orenchi Beyond it is the standard amount that most restaurants give. Slimy and crunchy raw octopus, yum. I felt it needed a tad more wasabi because it was missing that heat, but BF felt it was the right amount. \n\nBoth of us ordered the Orenchi Ramen. I loved the thick, al dente noodles!! Broth had a great amount of fat, but I felt it needed a little more salt for a tonkotsu broth. The egg was cooked abso-freakin-lutely perfect. Beautiful runny yolk. I wished it was marinated in soy sauce or something though. \n\nI also ordered an ikura ontama ($6) salmon roe, poached egg and seaweed over rice. Again, a beautifully poached egg. The ikura was not overly salty - do they marinate them in house?? They were tasty! \n\nThe thing that impressed me most was their operations. Service might be a little off ( our order was already taken, but then someone else came to take our order again.. later on the wrong food was given to us. Mehh, opening kinks) as is expected with new places, but I think the Orenchi crew know how to run ship smoothly for the most part. The mister and I were already there are opening, but they staggered the seating. We made it into the first round and opted for the bar. We noticed they only filled about half the restaurant, even though they well could have filled the entire place up with the amount of people waiting outside. Food started coming in a slow wave, and as we ate, we noticed they started filling up the rest of the room as the first parties started paying and leaving. Way to go Orenchi crew. \n\nI really liked the noodles and thought maybe the broth could've used a little more work, but my stomach didn't agree with me later on. I'll still be back to try other things. Loved the interior as well. That waiting area bar with opened windows is awesome! I'm sure once it gets more cold they'll pop the panels back in. \n\nP.S.

The bf and I drove by opening night and though there was a decent amount of people, we figured it wouldn't be too much of a wait.  Arriving 5 minutes before opening time, we made it in towards the end of first seating and waited about 20-25 minutes but I'm guessing that's because of the Giants being in game 6 of the World Series.  \n\nThe bf likes a variety of food so he likes to over order on the appetizers.  None we ordered were a must order (though my friend went later on and ordered the beef tataki and said it was delicious).  We decided to go with:\n*Spicy Karaage ($7.80, 6 pieces) - A bit disappointing.  I expected crispy pieces of chicken tossed in a spicy powder.  However it came as six drumsticks glazed in a slightly sweet sauce and topped with shredded red peppers.  It was not anywhere close to spicy.\n*Age Takoyaki ($7.50, 6 pieces) - The fried dumpling contained a small piece of octopus in the middle.  The exterior was nice, crispy and topped with bonito flakes, but the interior was too mushy.  \n*Fried Chicken Wings ($7.30, 6 pieces) - The best appetizer, but still not outstanding.  The chicken wings were deep fried and sprinkled with salt and pepper.\n\nThere's two types of ramen on the menu that sounded both the same.  Our waitress recommended the Beyond Ramen ($12), their signature ramen that you could only order at this location.  It's a tonkotsu based broth that also has a bit of soy in it.  The soup was delicious on first taste.  It was light with a bit of a garlic taste, but the more I ate, the saltier it got.  I wasn't a big fan of the noodles.  I liked that they were chewy, but the noodles were fat and were similar to chow mein noodles.  The toppings are scarce and came with one thin slice of pork, green onions, a few pieces of bamboo shoots, a piece of seaweed, and fried garlic.  I added an egg and I was glad I did.  Since the bowls of noodles aren't too big (I finished mine with no problem), the runny egg filled me up.\n\nBeing that it is a new restaurant, there are a few kinks that need to be worked out with service and timing.  Though our waitress was nice, she was often missing.  We sat at the counter and felt a bit forgotten.  I'm not sure if they have designated areas, but it took awhile waiting for her to come around.  My ramen was served in a timely manner, but the bf didn't get his until about 7-8 minutes after I got mine even though we ordered the same thing.  Both bowls of ramen should have been served at the same time.  \n\nIn the battle of San Francisco's over saturated ramen restaurants, Orenchi's broth rates up there.  In the battle of the south bay's battle between Santouka and Orenchi, sorry Orenchi, my stomach belongs to Santouka.\n\nP.S. Hooks under the counters would be a nice touch for patrons to hang their bags\n\nWHAT TO KNOW:\n*Beer, sake, and shochu\n*In addition to ramen and a number of appetizers, they also offer soba and rice dishes \n*Noodle refills are not available (first time I've seen or heard of that option)\n*There's counter seating, a few table seating, and communal table seating\n*Glass window, open kitchen concept\n*For those 21+, you can order a glass of Sapporo at the outside window while you wait for your table\n*Expect it to be a bit loud.  There's music bumping on the speakers and there's probably about 40 something people trying to have their separate conversations.\n*Metered street parking.  It's the Mission so it's often difficult to find.  However, we found parking immediately at 5:50pm", "author": "Nicole S."}

Yes, EXPECT A LINE AND EXPECT TO WAIT. We had arrived 30 minutes earlier with a party of 9, put our name on the list, and was in the first batch of people to load into th restaurant. It's nice they are organized in that fashion. Is it worth it? As Hunter Pence would say \"YES! YES! YES!\" At a first glance of the ramen \"what the hell... only four ramens to choose from?!?!?!\"\n\nThe tables and chairs are super low. I felt like hunchback of nortre dame sitting on the stills leaning over to eat my soup. There was nowhere to  place our belongings but either on the floor OR on your lap. Please, at the minimum, add hooks under the table. Service was on-point and fairly quick. The servers were very joyful and happy to take our order - we had 3 of them come asking us for our order. After ordering, i'd say 10-15 minutes before we received our ramen.\n\nAGE TAKOYAKI ($6.70) - deep fried octopus dumplings. they prepare it very well here. not overly densed but the perfect kidn of stuffed dumpling with the right amount of octopus meat. the octopus was cooked to perfection as the mean was tender and not chewy. \n\nKARABUTA SAUSAGE - they gave us huge ordering of this and on the house as they forgot to bring it out to us at the beginning. love karabuta (not karaBUTO) sausages. Although a bit greasy, it was still delicious. The ones they server had a nice spicy to them - making one crave a side of rice. \n\nORENCHI RAMEN ($12) - egg, pork, green onion, bamboo shoot, mushroom, sesame, nori seaweed. no need to add extra goods, the basics was PLENTY enough. I must rave about the broth, it was very tasty - one of the best ramen broth's I've had in my life. The soft boiled egg was the best soft-boiled egg ever to ooze and bleed into ramen. That was the most beautiful egg I've ever had to pop. Then the pork... thinly sliced, tender, and juicy... what more can you ask for?! The noodles were typical ramen noodles. Honestly, i'd be happy with everything inside the ramen minus the noodles and still give this place a great rating. I admint, every bite and fishing of left over fragments of bamboo shoots and mushroom were a good sign of really enjoying the place.\n\nWill I be back? I would love too but I am not about to wait in line with the rest of the city.\n\nUntil the next review....", "author": "Jane A."}

My chance to try finally came last week while visiting the bay area on business.\n\nI read the reviews before my visit and many said about the line forming up so quickly before opening time..  So I was there at 11:25am, 5 mins before open for lunch time.  I would have been there earlier if I didn't get lost on the way or find a parking spot sooner.  When I showed up, they had about 10-14 people waiting, so I put my name on the list.  As soon as they opened we still had enough space to accommodate everyone waited.\n\nSince I had Orench original several times, I wanted to try their only sold at this Mission location \"Orench Beyond\".   Ramen came and fairly quickly and i was happy to see so many garlic in the broth.  I added the additional garlic paste, hmmmm.. It was really garlicky and so goooooooood.  Since the broth was tonkotsu base, I was hoping they will serve with thin noodles but the broth was so thick, regular ramen noodle went good with this garlicky broth.  I added soft boiled egg and inside was to my preference.  It was unfortunate inside the egg (yolk) was a bit cold and ruined (but not totally) the hot broth.  They cook eggs ahead of time and keep them in the fridge. To serve with ramen, they really don't want to over heat as that will over cook the egg.  It's just the fine line to make the perfect soft egg is difficult, it would have been perfect if the yolk was warmer.\n\nAs the server recommended the takoyaki (and also reviewers said good), I also ordered takoyaki.  I was imagining the takoyaki I had from a street vendor near somewhere in Umeda Osaka, very runny inside with outside texture.  It wasn't the case.  Not sure if they even made them at the restaurant.  I like the way takoyaki is served in Osaka but this restaurant served with special sauce I wasn't expecting.  They were good but not what I expected.  \n\nService was really good too. They were friendly and attentive.  By the time I was ready to leave the restaurant, they were very busy. I am glad I came at 11:30am.\n\nIf you plan to visit here, come early as they do get busy.

I mean, seriously, how did one type of noodle make people go crazy waiting hours in line?  This will probably be one of those foodie mysteries that I'll never solve.  \n\nNow that I got that off my chest, let me proceed with my review.  A group of old college friends and I decided to check out Orenchi Beyond.  There's just something comforting about catching up over hot bowls of noodles.  We were lucky enough to be first on the list and got seated right at opening.  This place is like a night club atmosphere with food instead of dancing.   Between the six of us, we shared the hamachi carpaccio, agedashi tofu, fish cake and kaarage as appetizers.  I ordered the signature beyond ramen with an added egg that had the perfect yolk and some kikurage mushrooms.  The broth was pretty rich and amazing!  I loved every bite of the noodles and toppings.  I would have slurped the bowl clean if I wasn't so full from the additional cha-siu rice bowl my hunny and I shared.  What was I thinking? Too much umami!\n\nI don't know if I would wait hours to go here again, but if the timing is right, it worth a try.  Just be prepared for a couple of things.  It is pretty loud - remember I mentioned a club atmosphere?  I wasn't kidding.  There's even a dj booth in the corner of the restaurant.  Most of the seating is communal, with a couple of side tables for small parties.  You can see the kitchen putting the ramen bowls together, which makes you anticipate that warm bowl even more as you see the toppings being added like artwork.  \n\nEnjoy your ramen!

It was really neat on how friendly all of the workers were. Once seated I was surprise to be sitting on a tree stump! Also on the table there is a hook to put your purse (I love that!). There was also a very beautiful piece of artwork along the wall but I'm not fully sure on what it was (lion? Bear?). Anyways the restaurant was very cute. \n\nWhen we sat down we ordered Aged Takoyaki ($7.50) for our appetizer. I'm really starting to get into Takoyaki so I found this very delectable. I liked how the Takoyaki didn't fall to pieces like the ones I had in the past. But then again I am not too familiar with what is good and bad takoyaki.  \n\nFor our main course I ordered the Beyond Ramen and my friend ordered the Orenchi Ramen. Mine contained a lot of garlic and had a lot of flavor in the broth. My broth gave my meat a great savory taste whereas my friends did not. My friends tasted like tonkotsu so it was nothing special except for their soft boiled egg which my friend really loved. Unfortunately the Beyond Ramen does not come with a soft boiled egg unless added to the dish but regardless it was delicious and I would say that is their best selling dish. I'm not sure if the noodles were handmade but they also had a unique texture that separated it from the other ramen noodles I've had.

I've lived in SF for a while now and only went to this location today. I was worried that it would have a crazy wait like the one in Santa Clara, but I got there when they opened at 6 on a Wednesday and ONLY FIVE OTHER PPL WERE WAITING. This is unheard of in terms of Orenchi, or just good ramen in the Bay Area in general. \n\nI ordered the Orenchi ramen to compare to Santa Clara (the tonkatsu with the shio base). I saw on Yelp beforehand that ppl said that the SF one doesn't have as good ramen as the Santa Clara location. I hoped that was wrong, or that it would be a subtle difference, but there are big differences. \n\nMy friend and I agreed that the SF one is wayyyy saltier, much more oily/fatty (it leaves the outside of your mouth all oily), and has an almost sweeter flavor, like they added sweet soy sauce to it. Also, the noodles aren't as chewy and curly (more a textural preference I have), but that probably is because of different noodle suppliers in their respective areas. I mean, the noodles are still great, I'm just being annoyingly picky. The chashu, toppings, and egg are the same though. \n\nThe SF one is a little more expensive, but not that crazy, and totally expected. However, if you factor in the nonexistent wait time (even at 7PM, only like 20 ppl were there and there were many empty seats!), I would go to the SF one instead.

We were back at Orenchi around 35 minutes later and our table was ready 5 minutes later, that was painless!\n\nThe tables are long, wooden and family-style and the restaurant is chilly especially on a cold night and when the front door is open. Luckily ramen could warm us up. We both ordered the oolong cocktail which came in a very big glass. We ordered the shishito peppers to start which were very good followed by bowls of the Orenchi ramen (Jenny got the large size for about $1.50 more). The soup was very good but not quite as amazing as I expected with all the hype I'd heard. We also ordered the tuna rice which was a big serving and delicious for about $6.\n\nI would come back if I were in the area but won't be rushing back especially since I'd anticipate at least a 30 minute wait again.", "author": "Meghan P."}

The ramen at Orenchi Beyond falls a little short of the ramen you can find in Los Angeles, New York, or Tokyo, but it's my favorite ramen shop so far in the city. I came here with some of my Japanese friends and we all got the Orenchi ramen. The Orenchi ramen is a tonkotsu based soup topped with chashu (thinly sliced pork belly), seasoned soft-boiled egg, green onions, bamboo shoot, mushroom, sesame, and nori (dried seaweed). \n\nThe highlights were the noodles, soft-boiled egg, and the nori. The noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. I can't stress how important the consistency of the noodles are in ramen and they hit it out of the ball park. The seasoned soft-boiled egg was firm on the outside and deliciously soft and gooey on the inside. The nori was dipped only half-way like it should be, allowing me to enjoy both the soft and crunchy texture of the seaweed.\n\nThe downfall was the broth. The tonkotsu broth had a nice milky color and it was rich and unctuous. However, there wasn't enough flavor or saltiness. A lot of tonkotsu broths use shoyu dare and I couldn't taste it in this one. Shoyu dare is crucial for bringing out the umami and saltiness and without it (or not enough of it), I felt like I was just marrying my noodles in pure fat.\n\nOverall, Orenchi's ramen is good. It definitely beats many of the other ramen shops you will find in San Francisco. Another plus to this place is the decor and design of the space. It's trendy without losing its authenticity. The service here was excellent as well.", "author": "Hana K."}

I was lucky enough to go there when it was just about to open for dinner time so the line wasn't too bad.  \n\nI LOVE their pork broth--the fatty, thick, flavorful, MSG gets to me ALL THE TIME! I can tell that they simmered the pork for quite a while.  I love how the noodles were thick and chewy; the noodles remind me of the ones from Tsujita (one of my favorite famous ramen places in LA). I loved everything in the ramen, including the bamboo shoots (and I usually hate it!).  The Orenchi ramen also included a perfectly cooked soft-boiled egg :).  A suggestion is for them to have spicy Orenchi ramen!!! That sounds SO DELICIOUS, but for now I will just ask them for the chili oil and spices. \n\nThey don't have a parking lot so it's hard to find parking around there, but that's very typical since it's located in SF.  For ramen, the price is pretty expensive :/.  Back in LA, I can get ramen for around 10 dollars, but the Orenchi ramen already costs 12-13 dollars!!! Also, I didn't really like  how the music was SOOO loud that I couldn't hear what my friends had to say during dinner; while the music brings in a young, hip mood, I don't think you have to put it on blast--people are still trying to have dates and \"catch up\" time here so you don't need to! \n\nOverall, when I do go back to Norcal I would definitely want to come back again! :D", "author": "Iris C."}

If you want something with some kick, try the Beyond Ramen which is intensely garlic-y, and not for the faint of heart. Those familiar with the Orenchi in Santa Clara will find themselves at home here.. but closer and less of a wait!\n\nBreakdown of ramen: Broth is a medium tonkotsu. Good flavor and not heavy. Noodles are standard size and typically more on the al dente side. The chashu is pretty delicious, but cut a bit thin. Egg is on the more well done side, but still slightly gelatinous.\n\nInsiders tip is to try the Chashu gohan.

I wish they had ramen in a vegetarian broth (every ramen comes in a chicken or pork broth), but the other appetizers and small bowls are still great comfort food.  My favorite item here is the rice bowl with salmon roe and a poached egg.  The hot apple green tea is also good, although I don't like that it is served in a plastic carafe.

The noodles are a good middle between the usual \"thin\" and \"thick\" choices of ramen noodles. Luckily I got to also try some of the ORENCHI ramen, and there was very little difference. The only difference I can tell was the soup base which was very very slight. If I had to guess, I would guess that the BEYOND is more miso and soy base and the Orenchi is way more salty. Both are good! There are different toppings for each bowl also. Both are good and taste very similar. I also liked the takoyaki as an appetizer. It was regular takoyaki but the batter is a little more thicker with flour. Also the sauce they add on is unusual but still good. Usually, there is takoyaki sauce on the takoyaki but this place had some kind of sauce that was like thousand island and mayo? Not sure, but still yummy! Also, if you like UMESHU, definitely get the umeshu ginger ale-definitely getting that again!!! What I didn't like is the portion size and the fact that they don't do kaedama. No refills for noodles. Usually, other places will give more noodles for $12 / bowl and kaedama is usually only $1 or even for students.\n\nTIPS:\nDon't go here if you plan on talking to someone. You can barely hear each other over the music since the ceilings are so high. And come here on a weekday-the wait is very very short. About 5min to 10min, or none! :)\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\nGet the BEYOND, TAKOYAKI APPETIZER & UMESHU GINGER ALE!\n\nWould I recommend this? Yes!", "author": "Kelley Y."}

The tori soba was not that salty even though it's a salt-based soup. The leek was shredded so thinly that it had the effect of green onion. Great even for a hot day. The chu-ka soba was okay. I love that all 4 have bamboo shoots. The age takoyaki nicely fried and a good size. I also like the rice bowls, which are a pretty good deal. Sometimes, they have a ramen + rice bowl combo special.

Definitely has some garlic flavor with a number of garlic chips, but the broth is heavier and visibly fattier than the lighter milky white broth I remember from a while back in the south bay joint. My $12 bowl of ramen came with the dinkiest piece of pork; I think I had one bite's worth. I thought it was just a scrap that fell off a proper slice of belly, but after fishing around a bit, didn't see any more meat. :( The menma also has a strong aroma and flavor to them, which I am not a fan of. You will leave feeling reasonably full if you drink enough of the broth due to the grease, and yet still shortchanged if you order this bowl. I won't bother with the Beyond ramen again at least, but would give them another shot later to try some of their other stuff.

Also a better location--since you're actually in Mission, there's actually stuff to go do/more to eat around the area rather as compared to the strip mall that Orenchi South Bay is located in.\n\nMy friend and i strategically showed up at 5:40 on a Saturday night. I was definitely pretty nervous about showing up that late.. but we were lucky enough to be on the earlier half of the first wave of people who went in. I'm definitely much happier waiting twenty minutes which I think is totally reasonable. Parking can be tough here, especially on a weekday night, so you want to definitely a) use the buddy system, drop someone in your group off to write your name down b) leave enough time to find parking because if your entire party isn't there when you're called, tough luck, you're skipped over\n\nI went for the classic Orenchi goods--karage and their classic Orenchi ramen. I know this place is famous for Orenchi Beyond ramen, but I really just wanted my good ole Orenchi ramen. It's the exact same goodness that you experience from South Bay. The karaage is seriously some of the best karaage that I've ever had--super meaty, great flavor, and awesome portion sizes as an appetizer. Orenchi ramen is perfect broth and delicious al dente noodles. I will say the usual caveats for Orenchi--the soup is very oily and difficult to completely finish. You'll love the first sip, but my guess is that you'll probably end up not finishing the whole thing because it'll be way too oily. The egg is considered one of the best soft boiled eggs in the area but having had quite a bit of ramen in the last few months, I actually think the Orenchi egg pales. I think the egg is perfectly cooked and it's amazing how they maintain the yolk while the exterior is solid. BUT, this egg is not an ajitama--aka it's not marinated in something ... or if it is you definitely don't taste whatever it's marinated in. It's a good egg, but just not as flavorful as the soup.\n\nBut okay at the end of the day despite my qualms... I have yet to find a better place than Orenchi. It's hip and maybe some might say it's overhyped.. but yo let's be real. you can be a hater and hate the lines, but you're not going to find ramen that's any better in SF. That's why you're standing in line. Plus they have a bar so it's not even that bad. They make waiting trendy.

They spilled 3 waters while trying to serve our table and it made a huge mess. The waiter was not really apologetic and my dad's pants got wet from the spill. Nothing was done to rectify the situation and they (in true Asian style) tried to \"throw it under the rug.\"\nOn to the food! The karaage was decent but nothing to write home about. I ordered the \"Beyond\" Ramen and was beyond underwhelmed. Meat serving was measly and broth was too salty. The noodles had a great bite but that's about it.

Really good...and I'm surprised that some other yelpers don't  agree..  Believe me, I've eaten at nearly every single ramen joint in SF proper, and none of these places even come close in comparison.  It's all about the broth, of course, and they've got then intense porky flavor down and all of the depth of flavor we've come to expect in a good bowl of ramen, complete with plenty of fat globules in the broth.  \n\nHaven't tried any of their small plates or izakaya type appetizers yet, but maybe someday if I ever have the patience to wait for a table...", "author": "Joanne G."}

And you can never go wrong with Japanese, in my opinion, especially ramen. :)\n\nThe service was good and waiter was attentive in the small, urban establishment. I'd says about half or just over that amount of the restaurant was full of patrons. \n\nI sampled my friend's appetizers of fries, which were quite tasty with the right amount of crispness out of the fryer. The wasabi dipping sauce, which I stupidly mistook for a ranch, was very potent and definitely will open up your sinuses with a generous fry dip. Tebasaki Owariage chicken wings were finger-licking good! The sweet sauce on the crispy exterior was just right.\n\nFor my main dish I chose the Chu-Ka Soba. The broth was too salty for me though and left me chugging water at the end. There was a generous amount of noodles but skimped a little on the menma (bamboo shoots). \n\nAs a lover of ramen, especially the tender and fatty tonkotsu though, I would come back and just be sure to hydrate throughout my meal.", "author": "Malika H."}

There's street art on the walls, polished wooden tables + chairs, a dimly lit dining area, and an open kitchen (with glass walls surrounding it) that showcase cauldrons of delicious ramen broth. There's even a cool DJ turntable setup with a Daft Punk vinyl!  \n\nI have to say, the ramen overall tastes better here than at it's Santa Clara location. There's better tenacity and slightly better body with fuller flavor in their tonkatsu broth. The service is parallel to what you would receive in Clara' - tentative, yet not pushy, with a genuine smile.  \n\nThe appetizers here are a mixed bag. Some are great, such as the hamachi carpaccio and fried white fish on a stick. While others such as the karaage and beef carpaccio miss their marks. The karaage was oddly on the bone and didn't have much flavor. They tasted like a basic chicken wing. The beef carpaccio, although tasty, was cold which killed it's palatable appeal. \n\nWould I dine at OB again?  Absolutely!

(I have yet to go to Orenchi in the South Bay).\n\nI came here shortly after it opened, and thought it was some of the best ramen in SF - the noodles were fresh and chewy, the broth was flavorful and rich and you can add in extra goodies: extra noodles, pork, etc. The ramen is reasonably & appropriately priced at $12. I got the Beyond Ramen the first time and the Orenchi Ramen the second time, but thought the Beyond Ramen was overpowered by the garlic. The person I was with ordered the normal Orenchi Ramen and it was better.\n\nThe second time I went, I ordered the Orenchi Ramen but it was too salty I couldn't finish it. I'm not sure if it was a fluke or not, but I was not sober, and it was too salty.\n\nThe appetizers are nice for sharing but nothing amazing - the Age Takoyaki (deep fried octopus dumpling) were good (but what deep fried thing doesn't taste good?) but a bit on the heavy side with too much sauce. The eggplant was good, and the other appetizers I've tried were not memorable and I can't remember.\n\nOn a Saturday night around 8 pm, be prepared to wait for about an hour for a group larger than 4. This is a popular place, so be patient, or go to Japantown to find cheaper ramen, and probably more restaurants. \n\nThe ambiance is nice, wooden and hipster but it's like almost eating in a club because it's so loud and the music is loud as well. Probably not recommended for a date with someone you've just met, as you'll be yelling across the table to each other.\n\nAll in all, a decent choice for ramen if you're in the area. I may try it one more time to verify how salty the broth really is (another friend recently confirmed he found it too salty). I'll probably stick to ramen places in Japantown or make the trek to Ramen Dojo, unless I'm in the area and this is convenient. I'd also stick to the ramen instead of all the other small dishes.", "author": "Christina L."}

The umeshu ginger cocktail was also delicious; highly recommend it.\n\nOn top of delicious food, service was stellar (staff was attentive, and service was quick for a full house!) \nMy other Japanese friends have also recommended the Tori Soba.

Each with their own great flavor but with the garlic kick aforementioned. Another notable dish would be the fried chicken wings. Fried to a wonderful crisp with that sweet, Asian type glaze.

I'd passed this place earlier in the day, and made a mental note that I needed to try it. As a solo diner, ramen places are usually a good bet because you can squeeze yourself into that nook at the bar where no duo or posse could possibly take root.\n\nI put my name on the list and waited outside with some other parties who sipped sake and imported beer they were served from the walk up bar window. After a short wait (others had a much longer wait), I was called to take a seat at the bar.\n\nThey had a full DJ dual deck setup in the northwest corner of the kitchen, and it was blasting some hip techno crappola. I'm glad I didn't need to do much talking. The room is pretty acoustically untreated. (Who would care besides an audio engineer?) The room had interesting art though.\n\nThere I ordered a house hot sake, the Karaage, and a bowl of the ramen (the regular one, not the beyond). The Karaage was great for any fried chicken lover. It was not salty and was very moist. The sake did the job.\n\nFor the main event, the ramen was good, but not the most spectacular ramen I'd ever had. It definitely had a very umami funk to it, probably owed to the fermented bamboo shoots or something. The pork was good, the broth rich, the noodles firm. I felt like the noodles were the best executed, slightly softer than al dente. At Ken Ken, the noodles are pretty much vermicelli (which I don't like {but their broth is good}), and at my #1 all-time, go-to, don't-give-a-flying-crap-how-long-you-need-to-wait favorite ramen place, Ramen Dojo (San Mateo), they are slightly softer. The egg in the ramen was soft-boiled, but cold. Obviously they were prepared much earlier in the day but weren't heated enough to be warm in the broth. Other places don't let this happen, and the egg is usually one of the highlights of the meal. This time it was not.\n\nOverall, I would go here again if I were in the city, in the area, there was no wait and I was suddenly stricken by a hunger for ramen...but if I were setting a day aside special to go get ramen, I would likely not go here.", "author": "Michael M."}

There's only four choices for a whopping price of $13- two of them are tonkatsu base and the other two was chicken broth base. I got the regular Orenchi ramen which is tonkatsu base with shio and my bf got a large beyond ramen which is tonkatsu base with shiyo. The orenchi ramen soup tasted creamier and the beyond ramen soup was a bit more savory. I thought my bowl of ramen was kind of sad. After my meal, I regretted not getting a large which is $2 extra because I was still kinda hungry. I felt content while my bf didn't leave still feeling hungry. You only get one thinly sliced piece of char-sui. It was so thin it fell apart in my soup and I had to go digging for it. So for the value of the meal, I don't think it's worth it because there's plenty of other places that are cheaper and taste just as great. However, the only thing that was spectacular was the egg!

Naturally, I had high expectations for the food and service at this location too.  \n\nThe GF and I came here at 6:00 pm prime time.  The wait was said to be 1 hour and 30 minutes.  It was closer to almost two hours though.  We walked around a for awhile, and ended up coming back with thirty minutes still to go.  So, we decided to people watch.  Just to provide some visual insight of this establishment, someone has accidentally placed an odd shaped rock in front of the restaurant.  . People sit on this rock, but I doubt it is very comfortable.  A bench would have been more practical.  A few feet in front of the rock are little openings where one is able to order drinks from the bar while waiting for seats.  I have speculated that this is quite popular amongst these hipsters.  The actual restaurant is \"open\", for lack of a better word.  What I mean by this is that air is able to pass freely between the dining area to the outside and vice versa, with the exception of a few pieces of glass.  I appreciate this at a ramen place because I can imagine it gets quite hot, and if there is glass everywhere, lots of steam would be produced, fogging up all the windows.   \n\nAfter our names were called, we were led into the very first spots located at the bar area.  Although, they did not ask if we wanted to sit here (as we usually rather sit at tables), we did not question it because the wait would have probably been another thirty minutes.  All the workers greeted us as we took our seats.   After we sat down, we noticed how uncomfortable sitting at the tables looked.  If I remember correctly, the chairs are tree stumps, and they are very low.  This might have been my mind playing tricks.  After all, I was sitting on a very high chair at the bar.  \n\nWe decided to order as soon as we sat down.  We decided on the chicken karaage, spicy fries, and two Orenchi Ramens, one with an extra egg, and the other with extra noodles. We wanted to try the corn tempura but they did not have any! :(\n\nThe appetizers naturally came out first.  The fries came out fast.  Basically, this dish is comprised of shortly cut seasoned fries with a spicy dipping sauce placed on the side.  The fries are good, while the sauce is just okay.  It was definitely worth trying, but a bit overpriced.  The karaage came about five to ten minutes later.  I was taken aback because I have always known karaage to consist of no bones.  I asked the waitress if this was our dish, and she explained that it was.  The wings tasted really good.  They were tangy and crispy, kind of reminding me of San Tung wings.  \n\nThe noodles took quite a while to come out which is very surprising.  I would think they have a giant pot cooking the endless supply of broth, and ten pounds of noodles being cooked every minute.  Regardless, we were both very happy when it came out.  We dug right in and it was definitely worth the wait.  My favorite part of the ramen hands down is the egg.  It amazes me how the soft boiled egg is perfectly cooked.  When I cut into the egg and the yolk just oozes out a rich creamy liquid.  \n\nOrenchi is a must try.  I would say it is worth the wait.  The bill came out to $50 which isn't too bad.

I love Orenchi Ramen in Santa Clara - their broth is really unbeatable (in US only, of course) but the huge crowd + crazy long line always make me hesitate going there.\n\nWent on a Saturday evening - yup, no except in this location. I think Orenchi Beyond SF has opened for a month now? Just to tell you some facts:\n\n- It opens at 6pm on Saturday; I arrived at 5:50pm and I was #33 on the list\n- Got sit-in at 8:05pm (party of 1)\n\nGood thing is, the store design of Orenchi Beyond is kind of unique. Next to the entrance there's a mini-bar where they sell beer/sake/appetizer etc. So if you go with a group of friends, or even by yourself, grabbing a beer or two will definitely help kill some time. You may think \"oh, can I just order a bowl of ramen there and stand+eat?\" Nope, someone tried and got rejected. It will be really cool if they serve this style though, just like those street ramen carts in Japan.\n\nLooking at the menu, \"Orenchi Ramen\" is certainly there; but there's also a \"Beyond Ramen\" and this is only served in this location. Whoa, let's go for that.\n\n[Beyond Ramen]: A \n\n- Soup: Once the bowl came I took a sip of the soup: my first feeling was that it's 70% similar to \"Orenchi Ramen\"'s broth with the additional flavor of garlic and a type of vege, which I suspect it's kale. The taste of this vege might be a bit too strong for first-time-beyond-ramen'er but after a while I felt totally fine. In fact, the aftertaste of Beyond soup was better than Orenchi's soup, in a way that it felt less fatty but still left a layer of thin soup film on your tongue. The extra garlic that I added to the soup must have contributed to some of that feeling.\n\n- Noodle: It might be me but I felt the noodle was slightly thinner than Orenchi South Bay's. It's still very chewy though, and maintained the \"hard-boiled\" texture.\n\n- Pork: the menu said \"pork belly\" is included but it's more like slices of pork belly (aka cha-shu style) rather than chunk style. It was soft and completely absorbed concentration from the soup.\n\n- Egg: **NOTE** Egg is not included in Beyond Ramen by default; it can be added as a topping and of course I did: it's soft-boiled and the quality was comparable to South Bay's.\n\nWell, so why not a 5-star? Honestly, I don't mind the wait because the food is just too good, but I don't feel I was treated equally just because I was party of 1.... I was so excited to see my name on the list being the next one to be called; but instead, the server skipped my name and jumped to the name after me, which was party of two - and not only once but twice! So I had to go in and talked with the server; she pretended nothing happened and said \"oh, you are party of one? [walked in and looked around] sorry we don't have a seat now\" YES I KNOW because 4 people were just sit-in (at the bar table). So I decided to stand inside the restaurant to wait just to remind her that I'm there; and finally, after another 10-15 mins, I was offered a seat at the bar table -_- She maintained a nice attitude the whole time so I wasn't mad; but still, I'm a customer too, if it's because of certain policy that bigger size party should be sit in first - tell me and I would be fine with it. Skipping me was just kind of rude.... \n\nAnyway, I guess I will come back, probably trying the real Orenchi Ramen to see if there's any difference comparing with South Bay's; and next time I will be sure to grab at least one more person with me.", "author": "Simon C."}

I ordered orenchi ramen, bf orders orenchi ramen large (aka extra noodles). Comes out in less than 10 min. Minced/mashed garlic and redpepper on the side for preference. \n\n30 min later. Empty bowl. Great hearty broth.  Chewy noodles. I like mine not so chewy but i was so hungry i devoured it. \n\nWould i come back?

This is a slightly sweeter broth, and does not come with an egg\nOrenchi Ramen - this is the original Orenchi that everyone knows and loves. The noodles are just right, the broth is flavorful, and there's a really soft boiled egg, made just right.

The pork, mushrooms, bamboo, and egg were all very good.   The difference between the Beyond and Orenchi is apparently that the former is a soy-based pork broth and more intense on the garlic, while the Orenchi is salt-based, with softer noodles and an egg.

The only thing that I wish would be that there be a spicy option for the broth (not a huge necessity, but that would have made things all the more flavorful). We also ordered the spicy chicken karage, and that was a great choice as well! The chicken wings came out nicely sauced and seasoned, but were also crispy and had a nice texture to it. \n\nService was pretty attentive as well, which is always a plus! I didn't need to stop them constantly for water because they conveniently leave a jug on the table. I think the only downside from my dining experience would be that the tables here are communal. You share a table with strangers sitting next to you, so there is not a lot of room for privacy here. Those water jugs are also shared on the table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-19", "description": "The ramen itself is average. But it's definitely NOT worth that 1 hr and 45 min wait!!\n\nWe got there around 6:30pm and for a party of 2, there were 11 parties before us. It DOES NOT take almost 2 hours to turn over 11 parties. They have a pretty decent seating size too. The original Orenchi's in Santa Clara takes about 20 mins to turnover 11 tables. While we were waiting, I noticed some empty tables and it took some time for a server to bring in the next party, which plays some part in the delay of turning over tables. Also, many tables would linger after they finished eating. The workers can definitely learn something from the original location in efficiency.\n\nThe place itself is very hipster with an open waiting area/bar area and loud, I mean LOUD music. They let you order appetizers and drinks while you wait, which is a nice concept, except the bar area is so small that only a few people can actually have appetizers. And it's overcrowded so getting to the bar and getting some service for drinks can be very difficult. After spending 15 mins standing behind some people at the bar window I got frustrated and moved inside to try to catch a servers attention for a glass of water while I waited. After asking for water, it took another 10 mins for them to actually get me one. So ridiculous. I honestly think they could benefit from serving some COMPLIMENTARY HOT tea for their guests while they wait out in the cold for 1+ hrs.\n\nOur wait was estimated to be 45 mins. After an hour, we asked how much longer and we were told another 15 or so minutes. But after 1.5hrs of waiting I was ready to give up and go home, but how could you give up after being in the game for so long? I just couldn't. I was so grateful once we were seated. I had already went through 3 glasses of water, 3 trips to the bathroom, and a slice of pizza from next door because we were starving and freezing cold outside waiting.\n\nWe weren't given menus immediately and after about 10 mins we finally got to order. But I mean, after waiting in line for almost 2 hrs, we knew what we already wanted so why give us the menus and give us 10 mins to order. I mean, I was already frustrated from the wait, the cold, the rain, and starvation. \n\nFood came out relatively quick thankfully. I ordered the Orenchi Ramen and the BF ordered the Beyond Ramen. The Beyond Ramen was definitely more seasoned and had more flavors and at the same time saltier. But I still liked my Orenchi Ramen better and it comes with an egg. The egg was soft boiled perfectly, but barely even warm. The noodles were a perfect al dente. The ramen was on the pricier end too, $12 per bowl. And overall, it was just OK, definitely NOT THE BEST.\n\nI do give the restaurant cred for a very innovative and hipster layout. The outside bar is a great concept and they make good use of the limited space they do have. They definitely do try fit as many people as they can. Some tables are separate and some tables are communal. It felt like I was dining with the group next to us. We shared condiments, a jug of water, and I could hear their entire conversation without even trying. And trying to have a conversation ourselves on top of the music and neighboring conversations was very difficult.  The ambiance is definitely geared towards a younger crowd.\n\nHowever, I still prefer Orenchi's down in Santa Clara. They're efficient with better tasting ramen, and they give more of a traditional Japanese restaurant feel with Japanese greetings and phrases. Parking is also way better. The mission can be a pain to find parking in. Plus I've only ever had to wait 30 mins at most there.\n\n1.75 hr wait for a 20 min dining experience that was below par. Meh, Me Thinks Not. I definitely won't be coming back for a while, hopefully the hype dies down and the wait isn't so ridiculous then maybe, just MAYBE I'll consider returning.\n\nI hear there's even a line an hour before they even open!

The toppings are pretty hard to tell apart. The Beyond doesn't have an egg - $1.20 extra. I would say the toppings aren't anything special - good but not distinguished. Also, it's just for variety and you won't get like a huge mound of meat - which is okay with me since ramen is really about the noodles. And man oh man, these noodles are really good. Thicker but not like really thick. Tasty and chewy. These are probably my favorite noodles after Ramen Shop in Oakland.

The bar is in the very front of the restaurant so you can get drinks and snacks while you wait a table. And though it's mainly communal seating, you'll still feel comfortable eating.\n\nI always get the ankimo appetizer here but it could be a hit or miss. The first and last time I had it, it was just okay. But the second time, it was amazing. My main complaint is that they put too much onions on the dish. \n\nI'm always skeptical on getting takoyaki at restaurants because they all taste the same to me. But Orenchi's takoyaki is the best I've ever had. It's perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and it's not completely drenched with the sauce.\n\nI've tried both the Beyond and Orenchi Ramen. The noodles in the ramen are really good. They are perfectly soft and taste fresh. In terms of broth, I think that the Orenchi ramen is better because the Beyond is a little overwhelmed with garlic. Both broths are pretty good but it can get pretty salty. I didn't like that the ramen only came with one super thin piece of cha-shu and a cold soft boiled egg.\n\nI think this place is a little pricey for some ramen.

The service was great, the decor a little glossier than I like for my ramen joints, but the food was fairly disappointing.\n\nMy husband and I had the hamachi appetizer, which was this weird state between cooked and raw. it was slightly warm, very bland and could have used a healthy dose of salt and some lime. The portion was large but it was the first time we haven't gobbled down hamachi sashimi.\n\nWe ordered the Beyond ramen in large and split it. Our server was very nice in bringing out an extra bowl and spoon for me. The tonkatsu broth was good, but a bit on the greasy side. I did like the texture of the noodles, which was bouncy and held up well in soup.\n\nWe're not likely to come back here, since we've had better bowls of ramen in SF and the appetizers left much to be desired.", "author": "Orchid B."}

Looking over the other reviews here, I'm utterly baffled as to how San Franciscans don't quite seem to understand what ramen is (one review here says something about the ramen being 'bullshit' because 'egg that was so so under-cooked it poured out'. That sounds like a perfectly cooked egg to me, dude; tsukimi as a topping in Japan is just actually a raw egg...).\n\nThe Orenchi Ramen is just as good as the one they make in Santa Clara. The Beyond Ramen is a riff on the old standby Orenchi Ramen, but I didn't like it as much as I feel like it's heavily oversalted. If you have some sort of salt addiction and don't quite understand the simplicity of the old broth, go for it. Maybe you'll understand one day.\n\nNegatives: The karaage here is terrible though.

If it were a few dollars cheaper, I would consider it a good value, but I'm guessing their prices are up due to being in SF and it's popularity.  You can get a medium sized (on the smaller side of medium) bowl for about $13-14 plus another $1.50 if you want an egg (a must - I believe it should be included as standard).

With the chilly wind on a cold night, I was craving for a bowl of hot ramen before heading home.\n\nNot sure of my options after 9:30pm, I looked up on Yelp to check my options and was glad to find Orenchi Beyond open for late dining. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is operated by my favorite ramen restaurant in Santa Clara.\n\nGiven that I went there by myself, I must say I had a great dining experience even at the bar. The staff was attentive and accommodating (to my request), while the manager was friendly and more welcoming than many ramen places I have been to. I know I should focus on the food, but the overall service was unexpected, which is why I am writing this review before sleeping.\n\nI ordered my favorite tonkotsu shio ramen (Orenchi Ramen) and fried calamari legs (geso karaage). The calamari legs were fried just the way I like them, crispy yet not overcooked nor oily. The ramen tasted better than I remembered, likely due to the piping hot temperature of the broth when it arrived (considering how cold I was on my walk there). The broth was tasty as it was not too thick, yet still has a distinct pork flavor. The noodles were not overcooked, yet not undercooked so they were chewy in a good way (not soggy).\n\nI must say, after tonight, I will more likely visit this City location than travel all the way to the Santa Clara, as long as this location keeps up the wonderful service and delicious taste of the food that I had tonight.", "author": "Gilbert M."}

But the vibe/environment was just not the right fit. The ramen was the Regina George. \n\nI arrived with Monica W at 545pm sharp. What? I need free parking. Ain't a joke in the city. 25 cents for 7 mins? Okay brb, let me go pick some dollars off that money tree I've been growing in my backyard. \n\nWe put our names down on the list, and already there are 5 groups of 2 head of us. They paid more for parking, suckas. We awaited in the cold with our puppy dog eyes through their glass exterior. They were eating, while I was starving, give me a break. They opened their windows/doors at exactly 6:03PM. We were sat in order. The host would call a name and seat them/get them set up. Why not seat a bunch of people and have someone else hand out menus? IDK man. The environment inside was dim/hipster. There was colorful abstract artwork on the walls accompanied with a mini bar and 2 beers on tap. There is a ramen bar as well. The dining tables are semi-communal, very close to your stranger neighbors. The chairs are barrels, very inconvenient for people with back problems and people with purses/bags. Bathroom? There is a room with a square toilet, and 3 co ed sinks outside. I literally LOL'ed at the square toilets.. cause, thats the coolest shizz ever. \n\nA server eventually takes our order(their ordering system just seems off, Lindsay took a few tries to get it right) There are 4 choices, but the two ramen choices are the beyond ramen and the orenchi ramen. The beyond ramen does not come with the runny hard boiled egg but the orenchi does. I tried a bit of both and I honestly could not tell the difference. I loaded mine up with that garlic puree and that spicy seasoning. I wish I ordered the large(1.50) more because their regular portions are TINY for 12 dollars each. It sucks that it costs so much more considering the portion/price ratio as compared to their original location. Don't get me wrong, the noodles were a perfect al dente, soup was hearty and flavorful. The pork belly was so thin that I had to dig through all my noodles to find the broken pieces. Btw, no corn add on's :'(\n\nWe also ordered the spicy karaage, which was SO DECEIVING because it was not the least bit spicy. 3 pieces(with bone) for 4.60. It tasted like san tung chicken but much sweeter and without that white pepper spice factor. Good, but will not be ordering again. \n\nThroughout dinner, service? Non-existent. What really irked me was when we paid. Our bill totaled 32, we gave 2 20's. Our change took a good 15 mins, so sitting around after eating really wasn't the best feeling, I was definitely feeling that coma. \n\n\nVerdict; I will not be back.

They already had their waiting list out and there was already a good number of people ahead of us. During our wait outside, the front of the restaurant transitioned into a bar where they let you order drinks and appetizers. I thought that was an ingenious idea because the restaurant is quite small and they were able to utilize the space they had. \n\nMy sister recommended me getting the Orenchi Ramen. I was a bit disappointed because the bowl looked quite small, but ended up being pleasantly surprised at how deep it actually was. The Orenchi Ramen came with an egg, pork, green onions, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, toasted sesame, and nori seaweed. I thought the broth was very flavorful and not too salty. The pork was very tender and wasn't too fatty and the bamboo shoots also didn't taste like it came straight out of a can like most ramen places I've eaten at. I really liked the noodles because they were nice and chewy, but the best part was the seasoned soft boiled egg (drool)!\n\nWe were lucky enough to be the last ones to get in during the first wave of diners. Despite the long line outside, our server didn't rush us to make an order. The staff was friendly and attentive throughout our meal and we never had to wave or flag anyone down. We also didn't have to wait long for our food because it came out promptly. (Good thing though because I get hangry!)", "author": "Jenny L."}

I think we were seated within 10-15 minutes. (But it seems like that is not the norm.)\n- bar window for those waiting outside. I was thirsty so this was a huge plus for me.\n- cool beverage selection. Some interesting beers, and a delicious apple-green tea.\n- cozy, intimate space (which I like)\n\nCONS:\n- the music. Oh my god the music. It felt like we were eating ramen in a (bad) dance club.\n- the noise. It's just a loud space, partly because of the (way too loud) music, but also because (like nearly every other restaurant in this city) everyone wants clean, modern lines instead of investing in some sound baffling, so conversation bounces endlessly off every hard surface & then finally punches you in the ear. Repeatedly.\n- the waitress got my order wrong. Twice. Hey, it happens, and it was fixed as quickly as it could have been, but she seemed remarkably unconcerned. \n\nMEH:\n- the ramen. It was good, but not amazing. I definitely would not wait much longer than we did for it.

There was one point where I went every week, sometimes switching off with Santouka. Drugs are bad for you, but if ramen is your drug, things can't go too badly, right? Orenchi and Santouka compete for the Best Ramen Ever seat in my heart. Some problems can only be solved with a hearty bowl of ramen.\n\n- Beyond Ramen ($12): Yes, the ramen is $3 more here than in Santa Clara, but can't blame them with the high rents of SF. This is a mix of the regular tonkatsu broth with shoyu (soy sauce) broth. I may actually like this better than the original, but the broths here tend to be a bit saltier and less smoky. The Beyond does not come with Orenchi's signature soft-boiled egg, so make sure you add it on!\n\nI've always been pleasantly surprised by the very attentive and kind service at the Santa Clara location, and they did not skimp on that part of the experience in SF. Kudos to all the patient waiters who have to deal with the hoards of hangry diners.\n\nThe atmosphere at this location is MUCH more hip/design-oriented. Whereas the original feels like a young, authentically-Japanese space, this Mission location has an orange hexagonal door, an abstract painting on the wall, tastefully minimalistic furniture, and high ceilings. The bathrooms have rectangular toilet seats and individual music speakers, because the trendy-chic shouldn't end when you have to take a tinkle!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-11-06", "description": "Update: I've been back and they are much improved. Probably more like 3 1/2 or even 4 stars on a good night. So now I can recommend them! \n\nOriginal review is below for reference: a few good tips are in it. \n\nWe (my Japanese ramen expert dining partner and I) were so excited when Orenchi opened in the Mission. Finally, we would have really authentic delicious ramen close at hand. \n\nWell, not so fast (and I'm not referring to the 45 minute wait):  we ate at Orenchi and found it wanting. \n\nThe first problem was the menma. What's menma? Let's go to Wikipedia for the definition:\n\n\"Menma (\u30e1\u30f3\u30de or \u9eba\u9ebb or \u9eba\u78bc?) is a Japanese condiment made from lactate-fermented bamboo shoots. \"\n\nWhat they fail to mention is that menma is super ultra funky tasting. It just tastes nasty to me (and to my Japanese ramen expert friend). Is it commonly found in ramen? Yes, but not always. And when it is found, it usually doesn't overpower the flavor of the ramen. \n\nAt Orenchi, the menma we had was completely overpowering. It overpowered the soup. It was basically all I could taste. So Recommendation 1: If you don't love menma, ask for your ramen with no menma. Or get it on the side. \n\nWe got both the Orenchi and the Beyond ramen. The Beyond had a much more interesting flavor, with some roasted garlic notes. The Orenchi ramen didn't have a particularly notable flavor, except for the menma. So Recommendation 2: get the Beyond ramen. \n\nThe pork was good, but it was extremely thinly sliced and there wasn't much of it. Recommendation 3: get extra pork. \n\nThe egg in the Orenchi ramen was cold. Not just room temperature: refrigerator cold. It was also quite runny. Runny and cold is not a great combination. But you won't be getting an egg because you won't be ordering the Orenchi ramen. You'll be getting the Beyond ramen, right? And it doesn't come with an egg. (See Recommendation 2, above). \n\nThe noodles were thicker than we like, but they were also cooked more than we like. They'd gone beyond al-dente to just slightly rubbery. So Recommendation 4: ask for the noodles al-dente. \n\nWe also ordered fried chicken karaage. When you order the karaage you're asked if you want it \"regular or spicy\". No matter how much you like spicy, do not order it spicy. What they don't tell you is that \"regular\" is real chicken karaage: small crispy boneless pieces of chicken, battered and deep fried. The \"spicy\" is bone-in chicken wings, not crispy at all, covered with a sweet, sticky, slightly spicy sauce. Ugh. So Recommendation 5: order the regular, NOT the spicy chicken karaage. \n\nRecommendation 6 would be to find a better ramen place, but now I'm just being cranky.", "author": "Jacob L."}

I knew going in that it wouldn't match up to the original, but expected it to be quite good, especially given all the hype surrounding the opening.\n\nMy group of 4 all ordered the same thing: the Orenchi Beyond ramen with a soft-boiled egg. The noodles were not curly or chewy like typical ramen noodles: they were far too thin and brittle for the broth, which didn't taste as full-bodied as I had remembered it to. The portion was tiny; at normal ramen places, I am usually keeled over wanting to die from the humongous portions (for a small), but here, I felt like I had eaten 2 very large appetizers. Not starving anymore (had just had a slice of pizza before coming and was worried I wouldn't be hungry enough), but nowhere near full. Toppings and veggies were nowhere to be seen - a stray bamboo shoot or piece of piece of pork floating within the sea of broth...\n\nOur bill came to about $30/person (split a pitcher and a double order of sake as well) for a group of 4, but I think we could have spent our money elsewhere and left happier. We found some pupusas and tacos to fill our not-so-full stomachs after our Orenchi experience.\n\nAmbiance has loud music and everyone is shouting in the restaurant to make themselves heard to their friends sitting right next to them. It's like trying to eat a meal at a bar. Servers were wonderful and attentive, which is why I gave this place 3 stars (otherwise, I would have given it 2 for the food alone).\n\nMeh.

Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of ramen places but none of them really either stood out to me and I would rather drive out of the city just to get some decent ramen! Now, I don't have to anymore! I've never tried the Orenchi in the southbay (I know, blasphemy right?)... but my friends said this location was comparable to that location, so I guess I won't have to trek all the way down there just to try it anymore! Went on a Thursday around 6:20 and got seated at 7:20ish... so roughly an hour of waiting. There isn't a big sign that says ORENCHI or anything... but you'll see a large crowd standing outside... so you won't miss it unless you intentionally do it. Area has plenty of parking. Smart move on offering to sell alcohol to people as they are waiting, so there's something for you to do if you don't feel like walking around the area.\n\nOnto the food! Shared the chicken wings and the takoyaki. The chicken wings were nicely flavored. Sweet, savory, and pepper on the top. Had a nice little crunch while it's hot and not over fried like other places. Moist in the center... awesome wings! The takoyaki was delicious! Not too doughy like other takoyakis I've had and it was seasoned well. Decent sized octopus in the center... unlike other places when you're wondering if there's even an octopus inside! Then I got the famed Orenchi Ramen (clouds part away while rays shine down)!!! It lived up to the hype and so much more. I got the large size (+1.25). Noodles were nice and chewy, egg was nice and runny, and broth was amazing. If this is what an orgasm in the mouth feels like... then damn, I've been missing out. Even though I knew the broth was bad for me... I couldn't stop drinking it, so flavorful! I paid for it in the end at the end of the night though cause I was super thirsty! But I would do it again if you gave me another bowl! When the meal was over... I felt like a little bit of me died inside. I will definitely be back and many more times!\n\nOverall, service was good. Servers checked on us a few times. Place was clean. Can get pretty loud, but I feel like every place in the city is like this, so I'm used to it. Bonus points for their rectangle shaped toilet (I'm not sure why this really matters, I've just never seen a toilet that shape before)! Ramen is a bit pricey compared to other places, but I look at it that I'm saving gas money since I'm not driving out to San Mateo or the South Bay for ramen... so it balances out for me!

I was really hoping to like it because I love Orenchi Ramen in Santa Clara, it is my favorite ramen shop in the Bay Area.  This place though was extremely salty however without much flavor, except being salty.  I had the Orenchi ramen and spicy Karaage.  Spicy Karaage was not spicy at all, just fried chicken drenched in this salty sauce that I did not like.

Giving a place 1 star for a broken noodle machine is by far the dumbest thing ever. It's not like they intended to do that. That's an entire night's revenue down the drain for them. Saying Orenchi sucks for a broken noodle machine is like saying a Mercedes Benz sucks because it happened to blind you once with it's clean exterior. Also, then bitching about lack of parking is even more laughable because anyone who is familiar with SF knows parking sucks all over the city, especially in a high traffic area. Grow up dude.\n\nEasily one of the best if not the best ramen in SF. Came here on a saturday at around 5:50 right before the place opened and there was a HUGE crowd already. There was at least 40-50 people in front of us so we stuck it out. The wait ended up being 1.5 hours which I would never do again. I happened to run into some friends who came at 5:30, put their name down and then went over to Zeigeist to drink before coming back over (probably the best idea to do). They were seated pretty much during the first wave. I think what took extra long was just certain parties taking forever to leave. At least 2-3 were there 2+ hrs. I have nothing against people enjoying their time but when there's a 20-30 person queue. Be more considerate.\n\nThere's only street parking but who in SF drives that much? Sorry, but if you're going to complain about parking, chances are you're either from out of town or just lazy as hell (this coming from a fat guy). Everyone knows parking in SF is bad. That's why you try to drive as little as possible. If you factor in parking into your review then everywhere in SF is bad at this point because there are very little plazas and very little parking garages. \n\nAnyways, on to the food. I ordered the oomori size Orenchi ramen and I would say overall, it's very good. The broth was seasoned perfectly and had a great tonkotsu flavor. I was able to enjoy the noodles and the condiments at the same time. I only wish it was a tad bit spicy to give it that kick but nonetheless was good ramen. I wish I ordered some Cha shu with it but i just totally blanked out. We also got some karaage chicken which was tasty but this is the first time I've been to a place where they ask how many pieces we wanted. Usually it just comes as it but I didn't mind. Just odd.\n\nOverall, this place is solid. I would not wait 1.5 hours again but I would come here on a weeknight or something for a shorter wait time.", "author": "edward k."}

Also, the Sake was tough to share.  It comes in a glass that doesn't pour well, so you'd be better off just getting 2, except that they cost as much as a bowl of ramen.\n\nOverall it definitely hits the spot if you have a ramen craving, but it doesn't do anything too special.

Luckily for us, it was Black Friday around 10pm so the place wasn't too packed. Got seated right away and gazed over the menu. With 4 different types of ramen on the menu, I decided to go for the Orenchi Ramen. \n\nAlong with that, we kind of went ape sh*t with the appetizers too. We had damn near everything on that app menu. Between the 6 of us, we had the chashu, hamachi, takoyaki, spicy karaage, shishito peppers, and spring rolls. I'll just flat out say this, it was all good. Each dish had its own characteristic, but I'd have to say that the takoyaki was my favorite. Before I go on, let me just say that finding a place that makes good takoyaki in the Bay is a feat all on its own. Thankfully, OB makes a damn good one. \n\nNow let's talk about the ramen. I, personally, have never been to the Orenchi here in Santa Clara, even though it is close to me. After hearing stories of 90 minute waits and then some, I didn't want to make the effort. Now that I've had the ramen at OB, I'm almost intrigued to go try it from the original. Nonetheless, OB's ramen had me feeling some type of way.\n\nThe number one thing for when it comes to ramen is the broth. Hands down, some of the best broth I've had as far as ramen goes. Full flavored but with a light finish at the end so you don't feel heavy after drinking it. Noodles were on point, perfectly cooked. Chashu and soft-boiled egg, I don't need to say much because those two together is one combination I will never insult. Add in the nice pieces of bamboo and seaweed, and you've got yourself one legit bowl of ramen. \n\nOn top of all that goodness, the vibe is just right at OB. Great selection of music, nice seating, and super cool staff to make your eating experience all the better. \n\nNeedless to say, Orenchi Beyond is now a destination for me whenever I'm in the SFC. But don't take my word for it, go try it yourself!\n\nAlmost forgot to add but.. They got a super dope selection of Japanese beers and sake. Went great with all the food we ate.

The chicken was moist and tender, the skin fried to the perfect amount of crispiness and chewiness. The only thing was that it wasn't spiced/salted enough, so we had to salt it ourselves. Other than that, no complaints!\n\nI got the Orenchi Beyond bowl, which was oddly light for a pork soup base! I had read from their menu that they try to make the soup light and brothy without being too heavy; after the first sip of the soup, it was evidently clear that they had succeeded in making that light broth despite its heavy pork and fatty undertones. I'm personally not a huge fan of bamboo shoots or mushroom so I omitted those items from my bowl. The noodles were perfectly cooked, Al Dente, and the entire combination with the hot soup, soft boiled egg, pork (which was so well cooked it fell off my chopsticks whilst trying to pick it up) and seaweed made this bowl entirely enjoyable.

Looking at the list, he estimated 45-60 min. After waiting an hour, we went back to check the line and he told us it would be another 45-60 min. This was upsetting because one of his main jobs was to manage the waitlist, and he couldn't even set realistic expectations!

When our order came, I noticed that they missed an egg in my ramen (it's included). They were really good about it and brought an extra out. It sucked though because the egg was cold and even after soaking it in my soup for a considerable amount of time, I still couldn't manage to warm it up.\n\nFlavor-wise, I'm not a huge fan of the Orenchi. Generally love Tonkatsu broth, but mine tasted like a mix between Tonkatsu and a bunch of sauce accidentally dumped in from the bamboo they include.

Worse of all,  the broth/soup base was way too salty and had a strong bamboo flavor.  It was as if I was drinking a cup of salt.  For the rest of the afternoon, all I could taste in my mouth was salt.  This place is overhyped and I won't be back.  \n\n2 stars for the atmosphere and decor and also the friendly service.", "author": "Bel L."}

The cooks yelled hello/goodbye with everyone coming/going as well, but you honestly couldn't hear it. I don't design restaurants for a living, but I'm pretty sure the overall ambiance would go up considerably if the monster jams were turned off completely.\n\nThe ramen itself was ordinary. Ken Ken and Ramen Shop in Oakland have much more complex broths in comparison. The broth portions were fine, but like others have said, the pork slice you get is fairly paltry.\n\nUnless I'm being taken there on someone else's dime, doubtful I'd go back.

And it's on the loud side, so don't expect to be having an in-depth conversation with your fellow diners.\nI did like that you can order a beer (or sake, or tea) while you wait outside, which if the line were any longer would be really nice. Lucky for us, on a rainy Tuesday night, it only took about 10 minutes until we were seated.\n\nAs for the ramen, I can only really say \"Meh\". It was ok. I got the Orenchi Beyond, and my g/f got the regular Orenchi. The Beyond was definitely a bit richer, but neither one of them really wowed us - the flavor in both varieties was just not that complex. The chashu was possibly the most thinly sliced I've ever experienced in ramen. Their noodles I also found to be of slightly odd consistency; they were a bit thicker and chewier than I tend to like them. That's obviously personal preference, though, and not a knock on them.\n\nWe also got the takoyaki, which was almost liquid inside and pretty darn tasty, though the octopus was a bit tough.\n\nThey do have some nice fancy tea selections, and the beer list is functional.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-14", "description": "To the amusement of my coworkers, when I found out that Santa Clara's ever-so-popular Orenchi Ramen was expanding to the Mission, I squealed like a little girl. My passion for ramen runs deep, and possibly obsessive.  With no car, you have no idea how long I've been waiting for a satisfying bowl of ramen. (Sozai or Underground doesn't cut it imho). It's long overdue for me to pay my visits to see my beloved girlfriend: the tonkotsu ramen.\n\nI've been here twice now, and ordered three bowls. I can tell you with confidence that Orenchi makes the best damn ramen in the city. Owner Ozawasan has done an excellent job maintaining the classic Orenchi flavor to this new location. \n\n\nHere are details on their classic Orenchi Ramen:\n- SOUP: The tonkotsu soup is on point -- a very traditional tokotsu style which is a little lighter in surface taste. It goes against the trend these days of making the broth thicker and thicker. It's very refreshing to have a bowl of ramen that isn't a sodium bomb or a BP oil-spill. The umami, however, is anything but light; it's deep to the bone, and it's fucking fantastic. I would say, Ippudo's Akamaru is the only ramen broth that beats this in North America (that I've tried).\n- NOODLES: Thicker and chewier than the average ramen. It's definitely made with more 'kansui' alkaline water, which is very apparent with the springy-ness and the earthy aroma it gives off. The thickness really helps here because it clings to the broth more so than the conventional ramen noodles. Unfortunately, I don't think they serve kaedama (noodle refills), which would have been awesome.\n- CHASHU. It's very thin, but very delicious. I was very impressed when I saw the workers blow torch the surface of the ramen before serving. Making chashu is a very tedious process that involves refrigeration and is usually served room temperature on top of the broth. And yes of course, the chashu is rolled, not slabbed, which allows for a the \"melt-in-your-mouth\" feeling due to the higher moisture content. Kudos to that.\n- EGG: It tastes like sex. Should I even say more? Not only is it a soft-boiled egg, but it's not over-marinated. Basically, it doesn't have an overpowering soy-sauce taste like many other ramen shops, and you can actually taste the sugar and ginger. This definitely goes well with the lighter Orenchi broth, and this may be one reason why the more heavier, garlicy Beyond Ramen doesn't come with an egg.\n- OTHER TOPPINGS: Aside from the egg and chashu, the toppings are standard and nothing fancy. I'd like to point out that the menma (fermented bambooshoots) was NOT overpowering for me, like another review pointed out.\n\n\nSome things that bothered me:\n- This place is too trendy! From a business standpoint, Ozawasan did a fantastic job maintaining the same great ramen but adding to it a \"Valencia\"-vibe. Ramen is $12 instead of $9.80. The space is sleek with aluminum and a red tinted entrance. It's perfect for SF, it's perfect for Valencia street, and therefore there is probably lots of money to be made. Call me traditional, but I am a big fan of the cozy, \"hole-in-the-wall\" aura ramen shops give off. Others may disagree, but the space in the Santa Clara Orenchi still has this vibe despite its popularity.\n- In Orenchi Beyond, there are no individual tables, but more long benches for the customers to sit in a line -- it's harder to have a meaningful interaction with the staff here. (Staff are really nice though! I think they are doing a great job).\n- Their bowl of ramen is on the smaller side, and the chashu is pretty thin.\n- The wait. However, you can order drinks and snacks while you do!\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic ramen, and I believe it's worth the wait. If it means anything to the reader, I like the Orenchi ramen better than Daikokuya's (LA), or Shinsengumi's Hakata ramen (LA), but Ippudo's Akamaru ramen (NY) slightly beats it. I also think Orenchi ramen would do quite well as an lower-top tier ramen in Japan.", "author": "Jamie T."}

First thing he acted all pissed off and told me that they were closed and I said I could see that but all I wanted was a menu to order food later but it still seemed like I was bothering the crap out of him.  They didn't have a menu I could take and their web site doesn't (at the time of writing this) have a menu posted.\n\nHere's a tip for ya... you just spend thousands of dollars to open a new restaurant, a potential customer walks in who lives nearby and eats out at least two meals a day, don't act like they are a pain in the butt.  Be polite and at the very least you could have said \"sorry we are closed right now and don't have any menus you can take but here is a menu you can take a look at and we'd love for you to come back when we are open to try the food\".\n\nUnbelievable how someone can spend so much money to open a restaurant and not give a crap about customer service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-21", "description": "I was already a fan of the Santa Clara location like many so I was very excited to have them branch off into the city which is much closer to me.  The differences are significant but most are good though I do miss the charm of the original. \n\nWe came here last night expecting the hype but arrived with no line to see.  We entered the restaurant waiting to be greeted but it took a couple minutes.  We later realized there was a sign up list in the window that we walked by and didn't notice.  Not that it was necessary but if that was a requirement it probably should be displayed a little better.  \n\nThis location is far more stylish than it's forefather. The kitchen is wide open behind glass so you can look up close at the chefs manning the noodle station and the cauldrons of soup.  The seating is all communal so be prepared for that along with no backs to seats as they are all stylish looking tree stumps.  The bar seats do have back though if you need that. All the little details from the art, decor, windows, to the bathrooms all work together well and compliment the dining experience.  We did not experience the DJ being there so we weren't blown away by the loud music others have mentioned. \n\nWe sat at the bar and were greeted warmly by the gentleman working that area.  I did notice a bit of a stench from some dish washing buckets sitting on the other side of the bar.  It would have been nice if these were placed out of sight. It didn't bother my friend so maybe it was just me.  He took the time to go over the plethora of appetizers available and we settled on Tako-Wasabi.  I'm a big fan of octopus but my friend hadn't experienced much of it before though she was not against trying something new.  When it arrived it wasn't what I expected visually.  It looked like what I'd imagine to be what grizzly bear snot would look like. The taste however was amazing. Some of the best octopus I've ever had. My hesitant friend loved it as well.  If you can get past the look and texture (which I loved) it's a great little app.  I did suggest serving it on a piece of nori or seaweed cracker. \n\nLets get to the reason why we we came, the ramen. There were two options for ramen as well as two options for soba. We both ordered each of the ramens. Orenchi and Beyond.  We shared each others ramens and agreed that the noodles were perfectly made firm and slurpable. The broth on each one was very good the beyond tasted and felt a little lighter than the Orenchi.  Neither of them reminded me of my experience in Santa Clara but both were solid bowls of ramen.  Egg was tasty and we both agreed the pork slices were a little small. I added nori and fish cakes in mine. Only the Nori made a difference for me. What we both did try was the chopped garlic at the bar which made the broth a little more flavorful if you like garlic.  We had to talk later so we went easy on the garlic.  \n\nOverall we both liked Orenchi a lot and plan to go back. The Tako Wasabi alone was worth the trip.  A fun dish if you can power through the uniqueness of it.", "author": "Joco F."}

This makes me super picky about tonkotsu ramen, and I tend to brace for disappointment whenever I try a new ramen place in the area, since it's never just right, since the tastes tend to not be very popular with Westerners, or so my native Japanese colleagues in Japan tell me.\n\nSo no, this isn't \"just right,\" but I have to admit, the ramen here is really good.  The broth (I had the shoyu/Orenchi) was really rich, which is where most tonkotsu here gets it wrong (thanks, health freaks of San Francisco).  But at Orenchi Beyond, you can see the congealed pork fat in the broth, little white droplets just swimming on the surface of the broth.  If you think about it for more than a couple seconds, it's gross, but taking a sip of the broth and the noodles (makes sure you slurp!) makes you forget all that stuff about cholesterol and saturated fats.  What is surprising to me is that unlike most other ramen that I've had around here, I didn't feel unnaturally thirsty for the rest of the day, so that says something about the quality too, I think.  \n\nI went on a Saturday afternoon, and there was no line, so it seems like I lucked out in that regard, judging by the other reviewers.  Service was friendly and fine.\n\nThe one complaint I do have is that it's a bit expensive.  For the bowl I had, I expected to pay around $8 or so, instead of the nearly $15.

The soup base was nice for both. Garlicy for the Beyond. Lighter and sweeter for the Orenchi. This was a decent bowl of ramen. The best in the city for sure and above average for the Bay Area but mediocre by NY/LA/Int'l standards.\n\nThe most bizarre adaptation was the use of v thinly sliced cha siu, almost prosciutto thin. It melted instantly in the bowl, disappearing to the bottom. No cha siu/meat texture could be experienced obviously which is a shame. I ordered 2 extra slices which were barely noticeable and melted away. Cha siu is probably the second or third most important element to bowl of ramen and v unsuccessfully executed here. Actually makes me wonder if the chef who developed this version has a proper understanding of ramen at all...\n\nAPPS\nI ordered 6 appetizers on the menu and they were terrible. Airport dining mediocrity. Prob worse in some cases. \n\nThe fried chicken was fried to a crisp - Dark brown Coke color, dried meat, completely dehydrated, friend in oil that was either overused or stale (lending to the color).\n\nFermented squid - Acquired taste which I happen to like so won't comment. This comes out of a container so hard to mess up.\n\nMonkfish liver - Surprisingly decent (prob also comes packaged) but overwhelming use of red onion which was the only garnish for soaking up the ponzu. Garnish is key for this dish. Normally daikon or cucumber.\n\nEggplant - This was completely inedible. Tasted like it had gone bad (rotten) in the fridge. We barely touched it and also commented to the waiter and they didn't take it off the bill.\n\nTakoyaki - Oddly fried. This is meant to be cooked in a steel or iron griddle. Leaving a subtle crisp shell and moist contents inside. This one was fried (again to a crisp and deep dark brown using stale oil) and very mushy inside.\n\nChicken salad - The chicken was some sort of dehydrated, completely devoid of flavor and nutrient impoverished chicken breast mash. Dry and tasteless like paper. Like they collected spent pieces of chicken after making stock and put it through a processor (v likely how they got it).

I'm surprised there aren't deer trying to slam down the door because of the salt lick quality of this dish. The texture of the broth was like dishwater- I'm not exaggerating here- just gross. The noodles- I ate them because they tasted less salty than the broth. The meat and the greens just had a dirt quality to them. \nNot once did anyone ask me how was my food.

The ramen itself wasn't that good and had a bit of an iron taste, the seating was really tight and the sound level was SO LOUD that people couldn't talk.  However, the wait staff was really sweet and when I asked if they could turn the music down, I think they did.  It's hip and trendy, if that's what you want.  My favorite ramen places continue to be Ramen Yamadaya in Japantown and Ramen Underground on Kearny Street.", "author": "karen K."}

The service was great. There were little hooks under the tables for bags. The tea was expensive but the container it came in was super cute. There's a bar where people can stand outside and there are heaters right above so you'll never be cold. There was a large table of Japanese people (always a good sign). My grandpa loves Japanese food. He said it's the best broth he's ever had (Beyond Ramen). Four stars because the noodles were okay, no kimchi (they apologized for being out of stock), flavorless radish salad, and though the seats were cool they weren't very practical for my grandma who has a bad back.", "author": "Melissa K."}

Beyond ramen on the other had is awesome. Less pork flavored but well balanced with fish stock. We ordered several side dishes. They were all good and had unique flavors. The only downside is the long wait time. Definitely recommended especially for those who love ramen.", "author": "K N."}

I'm no ramen expert, but I know my way around and have traveled in Japan on several occasions. Two meals were fabulous, with near perfect ramen. Two meals were meh, with very poor ramen that suffered for a variety of reasons. One meal was just pretty bad. They have the potential for greatness, but they just miss the mark. I hope they get it together, I would love to be able to continue to frequent this place.", "author": "Mary M."}

The scallion, egg and nori all add to the slurpy goodness. Not to mention it's reasonable. I'd come much more often if there wasn't always a wait. They do a nice job of keeping the waiting area comfortable - heat lamps, tv, limited seats, drinks and food available.", "author": "Haley Y."}

The regular ramen broth is rich without being too fatty, the noodles have good texture, and the toppings are all on point. I like the thinner chicken soba with lemon too, for a slightly lighter meal.

(No unpainted 2x4's, open ceiling tiles, etc. Beautiful facade.\n\nThe Bad:\n - Arrived at 5:20 on a Saturday for a 6pm open. We were 17th on the list with a total of 55 people in front of us (16 parties ranging 1-8 people, avg. of 4). Sat down to eat at 7:30pm - Over a two hour wait. If you're familiar with Orenchi in Santa Clara, it's usually 45m-1hr wait.\n - Chairs are basically tree stumps with no backrests which would have been nice after waiting 2+ hours. Tables are close together, as per norm.\n - Approx 1/3 of the restaurant floor plan looks like wasted space. There's a bar with space behind the counter but it screams under-utilized which is unfortunate considering the popularity of Orenchi.\n - Ramen is +30% $$ than Santa Clara.\n - Hostess let two parties cut the line. One instance was because 'someone didn't know to put their name down' and the other instance looked like a friend who decided to stop by.\n - The menu is incredibly inconvenient. It's a 3 panel menu with horizontal pages that opens lengthwise like a scroll. \n\nThe more modern 'Orenchi Beyond' is nice and it screams San Francisco. However, a large part of me wishes they kept the original persona which solely focuses on churning out predictably delicious food.\n\nBest ramen in SF area? Probably. Would I go back? No...Can't deal with a 2 hour wait. If you decide to invest an evening - Put your name down and come back in an hour. Good luck.", "author": "Con L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-09", "description": "Finally tried this place and luckily didn't have to wait for the table. Ramen is pretty good but not great. Noodles are cooked well (chewy not  soggy), ingredients appear to be high quality (soft egg, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, pork). I think the broth is on the salty side and one-dimensional which is why I think it's just ok. Basically, one of the better places in San Francisco, but any hole in a wall place in Tokyo would be much better. What really kills it for me though is the crazily loud music and noisy hipsters talking about their hipster issues. Really hard to enjoy food surrounded by the cacophony.", "author": "Mikhail K."}

Artwork is cool and the music they played the second night we were there was old school R&B...we love that. This place was suggested by a friend who is in the Ramen business.  The noodles were al dente (both days) personally for Ramen I prefer the noodles a little softer, not mushy but a tad softer.  The broth was consistent on both visits.  Flavorful and a rich pork taste.  I really liked they offer different sides (approx $1-$3 per). It would be nice to see more veggies though on the selection of sides. We ordered 3-4 different sakes.  The lady who services us what actually quite helpful as the menu wasn't too descriptive of the Sakes.  I would try this place again if it was for a fun night with friends.  But seriously, I still have a hard time paying over $6-$8 for ramen, let alone $12-$18 w/sides.  Ouch!", "author": "Leilani I."}
