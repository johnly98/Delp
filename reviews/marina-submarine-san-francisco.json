The ingredients don't hold up to the quality of the rest of the sandwich...let alone the sandwich maker.

Everyone gives rave reviews about this place, but I wasn't impressed.  With all the innovation going on right now in the SF sandwich scene, Marina Sub is an old-fashioned place with basic sandwiches.  This is probably enjoyable for some people, but I'd rather have more flavors incorporated into my food - take some risks and go for something that makes you stand out.  \n\nYes, the guy making the sandwiches is really good at cutting up avocados, and will give you as many pickles as you want.  The price point for what you get is not as good of a value proposition when you're comparing with Lou's or Sandwich Spot.\n\nWe ended up waiting about 20-25 minutes for our sandwich, and it wasn't THAT busy inside.  The reason?  There's 2 people 'working', but only 1 is actually working.  The guy making the sandwiches is a maestro, it's true.  Great at doing what he does, you can tell that his hands have crafted thousands of sandwiches and peeled thousands of avocados before.

Those people were walk-ins so they were waiting for their sandwich to be made.\n\nTo my surprise when I came in to tell I placed the order I see that my sandwich has not even been made yet. There's only one person making all the sandwiches. I get it, it's busy so I give him the benefit of the doubt and wait a little longer for my sandwich to be made.\n\n20 more minutes pass and my sandwich has not even been made yet and I start getting really angry because the owner is taking everyone's orders and even making orders of walk ins that came in AFTER me and I'm still waiting for my sandwich.

I have to say that Marina Sub is hands down my favorite sub, which is curious, because if I were analyze the sandwich objectively, without question it has its shortcomings.   \n\nThe ingredients, such as the bread, meats, cheese, mustard, etc. are nothing special.  In fact, some would say they're pedestrian.  Stroll down to Ultra Lucca and they've got some great bread and meats, but something has kept bringing me back to Marina Sub for years.\n\nSomething magical happens when the owner (who makes ALL the sandwiches) throws everything together.   It tastes like a thing of beauty!  After the once lackluster bread is toasted and stacked high with mediocre meats, veggies, bland American mustard & mayo, with a little italian sauce splashed on and more Avocado than you thought you could consume in a week, the sub transformation is complete, and it is AMAZING!  I can't tell you exactly why, because it defies logic.  How could assembling mediocre ingredients result in something so delicious, but it does?!  Trust me on that!\n\nTip:  Hands down, my favorite sandwich is Turkey & Avocado.  The owner slices full avocados just right...finely sliced and very generous, and the result is the best T&A you'll ever get!  Make sure to add peppers as well! \n\nTip 2:  Avoid to-go orders if you can help it or be very careful with the sandwich during transport.

I don't get to make it out there often, but when I do, it's a big deal.\n\nSandwiches are personally made by the owner, one-by-one, so you're guaranteed to get an end-product that has been fully attended to. If you see a line, don't be discouraged, he works incredibly fast. You should see the guy prepare an avocado - his movements are so fluid and effortless, it's clear he's been doing this for years. Aside from that, the owner is a stand-up guy. He's really friendly, and tries his best to accommodate you and your requests. He's always been pleasant.\n\nI always order the Roast Beef on Dutch Crunch, and I've never been disappointed. Sandwiches are flavorful and dressed with his house sauce - perfection. \n\nBe sure to bring cash. If not, then it's a pretty far trek to the next Bank of America. If that's the case for you, rest assured that if you need to make that extra trip, it is very much worth it.", "author": "Nicole I."}

I always order the same thing - turkey, light on the mayo, swiss cheese. No secret sauce, nothing else. \n\nSadly, my sandwich just wasn't good. The bread was super tasty, but the meat was slimy and I'm pretty sure that I either didn't get swiss cheese or the cheese had gone bad. It actually tasted nasty. \n\nThere's just one guy making all of the sandwiches, so give him a break! He's busting his ass to make you food. I think it adds to the authenticity of the place. \n\nI understand that my food preferences may be different than yours, so the only other con this place has (I didn't hold it against Marina Sub in my review) is the surroundings. Normally, I don't mind the Marina douches as I used to live there, but the ones outside at the moment that I was there particularly pissed me off. Marina Sub is an open door place, which means that if you are loud, obnoxious, and smoking, it affects everyone inside. After 5 minutes of listening to 6 dumbasses recount all of the slutty things they did the night before I was already irritated when they all started smoking. I actually went outside and asked them to move. One of them rolled her eyes at me like it was the most outlandish request ever. I don't hold this against Marina Sub, but if your tolerance for doucheyness is less than mine, go somewhere else.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

This thing is not only large, it can feed two large people. And they're not skimpy with the avocado. Some places, you're luck to get a few slices, but here they cut out half of avocado before spreading it out and adding more to make sure every bite is covered. Sadly, this sandwich we ordered to go was missing the one thing that made coming here worth it - the special sauce. Without, it was just an ordinary turkey avocado sandwich. Wah wah wah...\n\nIt was orderly chaotic inside, with the wait times for sandwiches ranging from 15-30 minutes.

Hopefully the warden will also honor my request that Kyu (\"Q\"), the owner and sandwich maker, be allowed to come to the prison to make the sandwich. There are many things I love about Marina Sub. Let me enumerate a few:\n\n1) The sandwiches are just really damn good. My faves are the turkey and meatball. I go medium. The bread is always perfectly toasted. The special sauce on the turkey is downright dreamy. And on a cold day the meatball really hits the spot. \n\n2) I do not personally love avocado but having said that I could watch Q cut avocados all day long. If there was some kind of avocado slicing competition, Q would win. He is stunningly fast and unwaveringly accurate. And his style points would also be off the charts given that he insists on looking off into the distance while slicing the avocado, just daring the knife to slice his finger. It does not dare.\n\n3) It took about a year of coming here consistently for Q to recognize and acknowledge me, often with a silent nod. About 2 years after that, I walked in and Q called out to me by name. I dropped to my knees and wept. I had worked hard and consumed many sandwiches just waiting for the day that Q would call me by name. When that day came, I was overcome. Now we chat a bit every time I go in. It goes like this:\n\nMe: \"Hey Q, how's it going?\"\nQ: \"Hey Matt, you know, same old.\"\n\nIndeed.\n\n4) I love the fact that the cashiers are not allowed to interact with the sandwiches in any way. I have friends that complain about the wait times / lack of efficiency here. Sure, Marina Sub isn't winning any operational excellence awards but if you want a crappy, fast sandwich there are many places for that. Q is all about quality.\n\nAll in all, this place is the best. \n\nAlso, I'm not currently on death row or even in prison.", "author": "matt c."}

Although the line is SLOW here, it doesn't compare to Ike's wait time.\n\nMarina Sub is a one man (the owner) operation.  The hired help is always a teenage kid, and I can't help but chuckle at the situation after the 15th minute of standing in line.  Here you have the owner chopping avocados into 40 slices, like Martin Yan from Martin Yan Can Cook (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT9lKA5_bPI), and you have the hired help working the register never knowing what price to enter.\n\nIf the line is 5 deep, prepare to wait 20-25 minutes.\n\nOutside of the long line, the sandwich is the bomb.  All the ingredients are fresh and you order by size.  I believe a large is 10 inches from what I can remember from the menu.  It's kind of weird, because the bread is maybe barely just longer than 10 inches, but he always cuts a slight edge off of the bread to make it 10 inches.  \n\nWhat separates the sandwich is an addictive sauce he puts on the sandwich.

Like I get made fun of by my family because I love a deli sandwich and will go out of my way to get one (Anderson Valley grocery, I see you). So when a shop says they're the best sub in San Francisco, I say, prove it. You walk in and I'll be honest, it's not much to look at. There's paper covering up menu items they no longer serve, like salads. However, there's a certain beauty to a limited selection of items. Plus, they more than make up for any lack of items with what can only be viewed as a show by a sandwich master. As I watched Q deftly disengage several avocados from their skins and then finely slice each half without a glance before sliding a full avocado onto another patron's large sub, I was transfixed by the man's skill and attention to each sandwich. I ordered a small but it was what I would describe as huge. All sandwiches are toasted which just adds to the overall flavor. Even though I let my sandwich sit (I had just had brunch, however I am sandwich crazy) and the special sauce (most likely an Italian dressing) had soaked the end of the bread, the thing was like biting into heaven.

That's a good sign already. \n\nSo we walk in, and there's this girl behind the counter with glasses who looks like she just woke up. We tell her we want a small Atomic and she stops me and points at the man behind some curtains rearranging some boxes. I'm confused as to what's going on. The man comes out a bit later, Korean male, average late 40s to early 50s and he asks what I want. I was kind of expecting the girl to tell him what I wanted since I just gave her my order but she just stood there and stared off into blank space. So I repeated to the gentleman what my order was: a Small Atomic sub. He goes up to the girl behind the counter and tells her \"Small Atomic Sub.\" Mind you, this is the third time she has heard it. And she stands there almost as if her brain was running on 64MHz and then it's like \"ding---Process complete\" and then she slowly punches in the price on the register. It was pretty amusing. \n\nThe sandwich itself was good. The bread is a bit thinner than those found at Gene's Liquor or Submarine Center and didn't hold up to the moisture too well. The pastrami was excellent. There was a generous amount of meat and the \"special sauce\" was standard to the previous mentioned stores. \n\nHowever, one major gripe is just the cost itself. A small Atomic with tax rang up to be about $9.35. That's crack prices! A LARGE with Avocado at Gene's is less than that from what I recall. It's heinous that a large here without avocado runs about $14 and change and with tax probably closer to $16. Even at Submarine Center, their largest SUPER is only $8.70. Maybe it's because I'm on Union Street, but nonetheless. Expensive sandwich with borderline retarded staff is enough for me to consider the tantalizing aroma as a stench.", "author": "Derrick L."}

The prices are reasonable but sadly I likely wont ever return here at will any time soon.\nI ordered my usual  favorite: (simple) Turkey Breast sandwich and was so bummed out. The sandwiched lacked flavor and personality. The bread was nicely toasted but the ingredients, although (somewhat) fresh didn't really bring anything to the table. I felt like I could have made this sandwich myself had I just hauled my ass to the grocery store & picked up lettuce, tomato & onions. In fact I KNOW I could have made a MUCH better sandwich and I'll even add in an even BETTER secret sauce(!!)\nI didn't order cheese or extra toppings because I was hoping their \"secret special sauce\" would be enough to satisfy my submarine craving. It totally FAILED. The sauce was too watery and was more or less just salty water, w/ olive oil, vinegar and some random Italian spices thrown in. The sauce was so watery it basically soaked the toasty bread and made it super soggy which just made me turn into Oscar the Grouch w/ a long faced ugly pout... \n\nI SO wasn't prepared to eat a crappy sandwich on such a beautiful sunny day... \n:(\n\nI will NOT be coming back...!\n\nOh & FYI, \nThe Sandwich Spot \nwww.sandwichspotsf.com\n        & \nIke's Place @ 3489 16th St. IS SOOO MUCH BETTER!!", "author": "Karen G."}

I was walking around the Marina today and wanted to pass by my dearly departed Great Aunt's flat on Pierce Street.  It's yellow shingle, versus the dark brown I remember.  I wonder if the house still has her \"lazy Buick\" installed?  As I was crossing Union Street, I saw this line out of a corner store with \"Submarine\" on the awning.  I couldn't pass this up, as the line was out the door.\n\nWhile waiting in line, I could not decide from anything on the menu, even though there's only about 8 sandwiches to choose from.  I chose to get 2 of the Italiano, which has three kinds of meat.  (mortadella, salami, capicola maybe, and provolone).  While the menu does not say the subs come with mustard, everybody who ordered one did.  It was actually pretty good, and give it a good spice.  I would never think to have mustard on an Italian sub, but this might change my mind.\n\nAl subs come with tomato, onion, lettuce, \"secret sauce\", mayo and mustard.\n\nAnyway, it rivals any sandwich I've ever had.  Maybe a list is in the making?  The subs are toasted in a Bakers Pride oven.  The large is 10\" long, but I wonder what they do with the left over two inches that's cut off?  Who's going to order a 2 inch sandwich?  \n\nThe guy is the fastest I've ever seen pitting and slicing an avocado, and laying it neatly in even slices on some sandwiches.  Less than 10 seconds, and it's all done.  Perhaps he worked at Benihana in a previous life?\n\nCash only, and vegetarians will have only one option.

I was surprised at how generous he was with the toppings, as most places can be a bit stingey.\n\nOnce I was back at the office and had the chance to sink my teeth into that beast of a sandwich, I was in pure heaven. The bread was nice & toasty while still being soft in the middle and didn't include that stanky smell that Subway's subs tend to have. Also, the meat wasn't excessive like Togo's, but was juuust the right amount, balancing out the sandwich toppings.\n\nThe only cause for lack of a 5th star is because I tried their chicken salad sandwich the other day and wasn't much of a fan of the chicken since it tasted pretty spongey. I think I'll just stick to their sliced meat sandwiches and will be giving their meatball sandwich a try since it looked mighty tasty.\n\nThe ambiance is a bit depressing w/ bad lighting and an old skool menu that has poorly concealed menu items & prices (it looks as though they used random pieces of paper to do their cover-up work).

They've had a toaster oven for their sandwiches since the beginning, before those other el cheapo sub chains even existed, and they use it to good effect.  The cheese is high-qual.  They've got ice cream and a wide assortment of chips including Funyuns.  The classic Sub is a favorite; for a long time in my childhood I also ate Italian Beef regularly.  My girlfriend is partial to the Turkey Avocado.  Oh, did I mention the excellent oil and vinegar dressing they put on the sandwiches?

I almost blushed, I was so embarrassed.  But it doesn't stop there!  He grabbed his girlfriend and popped in and asked me what I was eating, if it was good, and then got in line.\n\nWhen I think about going to eat in the Marina/Cow Hollow area, this place is right at the top of the list.\n\nAnswer to the question at the top: a playing card, I think it's a 10 of clubs but come to think of it now I can't quite remember.

After over 30 years of coming here and ordering the same thing, I cannot count the ways. When I am away from you, I dream about you: the delicious tang of your \"special\" sauce, the chomp of your freshly Ginsu-ed pickle, the crunch of your freshly toasted bread, all mixing with the oooey gooey deliciousness of your oven melted cheese. (Excuse me for a moment while I change panties!) \n   As a San Francisco native I cut my teeth on these beautiful masterpieces and I feel very fortunate to have had the privilege.  I'm 36 now and I had my first ham and cheese at 2 1/2...you do the shameful math! \n   Sure, sometimes you'll get there and the line will be out the door, and yeah maybe it takes 20 minutes to get a sandwich on a really busy day, but it is all worth it just to watch a master at work.  Q is the uncontested master samurai of submarines. His knife skill are better than those of master chefs!  Order a pickle, even if you don't like them, just to watch him slice and you'll know what I'm talking about. As the self proclaimed ambassador of my hometown I have brought every visitor I have ever had from every corner imaginable of the world to Marina Sub, and they all proclaim through greedy mouthfuls that Marina Sub is the proverbial s**t.  Thank you, Q, for bringing this wonderful gift in the form of a sub into my life.  My heavenly constant, you always guide me to satisfaction!\nTips: You can order ahead over the phone, but I don't like to do this as timing is everything with a sub.  Leave it 5 minutes too long on the counter and the bread won't have the warmth and crunch that is so satisfying. Do yourself a favor and grab the two seater in the window, watch the yuppies go by while you wait, and strap yourself in to be transported to the heavenly ninth wonder that is Marina Sub.\nThe only con: It doesn't stay open later!

So when my boyfriend had a hunkering for a sub, I suggested this place. Mind you I was kind of starving, as in I could eat my own arm after running 6 miles that morning. So I figured a sub place is perfect, fast and quick. Right??? WRONG!\nWe find a parking space right out front (amazing!) Then we see a line. I mean nothing crazy but maybe 6 people, so I figure, \"Crap. I'm not gonna get my freakin' sandwich for like 15 minutes. And I want to eat NOW!\" Boy was I wrong. I stood in line for exactly 1 hour. Yes 60 minutes, count them!!! By the time 20 minutes passed, I was too invested to leave. \nI proceeded to sigh loudly, look around, shift from foot to foot, clench my fists, utter obscenities under my breath, and then contemplate what my arm would really taste like. Then I proceeded to be a bitch to my boyfriend taking out my frustrations on him. An hour and 30 minutes later, I finally put this sandwich in mouth thinking by now anything would taste good. And it wasn't even all that. Kinda bland.  WTF?!?\nBasically this place wasted two of my hours on a nice sunny day, made my stomach eat itself out of desperation, made my boyfriend and I cross with each other, and ultimately made my boyfriend sick with a stomache (stomach + ache= stomache). I hate this place. It ruined my day. \nAnd don't even get me started on the two 13 year olds standing behind the counter doing absolutely nothing while the old asian man was ready to have a heart attack making 76 sandwiches.
