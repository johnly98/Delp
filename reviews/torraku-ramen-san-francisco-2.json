The weather was cool and I had driven my pup along with us so we picked this place because of proximity, outdoor seating (dog friendly!), and of course, a high rating on yelp. \n\nDecor is modern with their menu plastered on the wall. Realistically, I only caught a glimpse of the inside, but the outdoor seating is really cute with hanging lightbulbs and plenty of room for pups. \n\nThe server loved dogs so she was so friendly and accommodating for us. We each ordered the same thing: spicy tonkatsu ramen with crispy garlic and a side of edamame to share. \n\nIt was DELICIOUS! The flavors were different than what I'm used to in SoCal, but it was still such a savory, umami filled bowl of ramen! I ordered the pork belly meat and that was literally falling apart, it was so tender! The garlic added that perfect seasoning! I usually order edamame when I know the meal can be a bit meat heavy and it was a nice thing to munch on between bites of the soup. \n\nOverall, I truly enjoyed this place and will plan to come back my next visit to SF!", "author": "Ailleen J."}

I travel the world for a living and haven consumed a great deal of ramen throughout Japan. This is not ramen. There is almost a tomato soup taste to the broth. When I ordered extra spice, there was literally no spice added to the bowl, and yet they charged an additional dollar for the spice (which they never told me about when I ordered, nor is it listed as such in the menu). Total jive. I was full and walked away not feeling terrible but I definitely felt cheated.

My ramen knowledge is growing by the month, but I'm still no expert. Knowing that I am a fan of tonkotsu which is a rich pork broth, I got that with chasu. In other words, pork on pork! I decided not to add garlic of any sort which I now realized would've helped my cold but alas... I did get it at a medium level of spice which was perfect, and didn't go for any other extras. It was all ready for me to slurp down in about seven minutes!\n\nThe broth was some of the most flavorful I've had. There was a solid amount of chasu, as well as extras like bamboo shoots and, of course, noodles. I was left feeling full and satisfied with even a little left in the bowl.

Lots of noodles, which weren't particularly notable since I don't think these are home made.

I got the shoyu ramen with kakuni, medium spicy, no garlic (after the Gilroy garlic festival last year I really can't handle too much garlic...)\n\nBroth - My first impression of the broth was the little circles of oil floating near the top, but it was surprisingly not too oily or greasy. It was hot, tasty and good for chasing down large mouthfuls of noodles.\n\nNoodles - I thought the noodles were pretty great, as they were firm and had a good bite. Just what I like from my ramen noodles!\n\nToppings - highlights here were definitely the egg and kakuni. They both had this rich, sweet flavor that went well with the salty shoyu. The egg was creamy, with the yolk slightly cooked on the outside but soft and a little runny on the inside. I was surprised that the texture held in the food truck! The pork was pretty fatty and a little dry, but the meat was so flavorful, and I was given 4 good-sized pieces, more than I usually expect in a bowl of ramen. The soft flakiness of the pork melted around the noodles, creating a perfect texture in every bite. The bamboo was good as well, but there were only three pieces - a little lacking. \n\nService was also really quick (~5 min). A tip is to fill out the paper order form, which we didn't immediately notice. That way you don't have to remember to list all your order details. Also, note that it's $12/bowl, and customized toppings can be $2-$3 each.

Add black garlic! You won't be disappointed.\n\nNoon rush: try to avoid or be prepared. Service is quick but the line gets long and goes out the door. If you're lucky you can get a spot on the cute patio. Heat lamps too!\n\nService: very friendly. People complain about having to buss your own table. This is a busy area for people on their lunch break and this place gets packed very quickly. It's nice to go when you need to go. They don't have refillable drinks, so what kind of service are you really expecting? Get a grip.", "author": "Vee S."}

It all worked out for the best though. \n\nI had the Miso, with Pork Belly, Medium Spice-Level, plus Black Garlic. Whew, that's a mouth full -- but so was the food.

Thinking that it wouldn't be crowded on a weekday and parking would be a breeze, I drove down there. When I arrived, there was zero parking. Apparently, people that work in the area park in the area all day since there's a lot of non-metered parking. After circling 5-6 times, I stalked this guy who left the food park. Yes - rock star parking in front! He took what seems like eternity adjusting his mirrors before finally putting his seat belt on. He turns on his car, turns it off, gets out of the car and walks across the street. The inconsiderate phucktard could of told me he was NOT leaving when he initially got into his car since he saw me waiting for his space. *shakes fist* \n\nAfter circling another 4 rounds, I found metered parking around the block. I stepped out of the car and onto fresh, dinosaur-size turds. Lovely. \n\nAs I was waiting in line to place my order at Torraku Ramen, Tater Tot decided to lay down in a puddle of water. Brown, muddy water at that. \n\nSometimes you have to laugh this sh*t off. Literally.\n\nTorraku Ramen serves up 6 kinds of ramen: Seafood, Tonkotsu, Shoyu, Miso, Curry, and Veggie. They're all $12 a bowl except for the seafood ramen ($13). For the tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, and curry ramen, you have a choice of Kakuni (pork belly) or Chashu (pork shoulder). You have an option to add garlic and choose your level of spiciness. Except for the seafood ramen, all bowls come with half an ajitsuke tamago, bamboo shoots, wood ear mushrooms, pickled ginger, scallions, and nori. Extra toppings (corn, cabbage, bamboo, bean sprouts) are an additional $1. NO msg is used which is a huge plus! You can order to go for an extra 10 cents (also offers delivery through GrubHub). IMO, just like a Neapolitan pizza, you shouldn't order ramen to go; the quality will not be the same as if you eat it on the spot.  \n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen w/ kakuni, wood ear mushrooms, bamboo shoots, ajitsuke tamago, nori, medium spicy ($12). I also added black garlic ($1) and corn ($1): http://bit.ly/1nzVdoz. With a bottle of water (Voss only) and tip, my total was over $21; kinda pricey. \n\nMy order was ready in about 5 minutes and was piping hot. Everything was on-point except the broth. I highly suggest ordering the ramen \"no spicy\" because the chili oil was so overpowering that you couldn't taste the rich milkiness of the tonkotsu broth (if there was any). All I tasted was oil so I didn't drink much of the broth. The noodles were al-dente and springy with a good chew. The kakuni had a higher fat ratio to meat then I would have preferred but it was flavorful and tender. The highlight was the ajitsuke tamago, marinated soft boiled egg. The soy marinade produced a savory sweetness and the egg had a beautiful molten center. The portion was filling. I'm very intolerant to msg and had zero issues afterwards - so they really don't use it. \n\nAs I was slurping my ramen, a guy sat next to me with his order from Bacon Bacon. We said, hi to each other and he started taking obligatory food pics. I was always taught not to stare but I couldn't stop staring at him from the corner of my eye...\n\nHe was videotaping himself eating his burger and fries with commentary and all. Is this some new trend that I'm not aware of?\n\nP.S. - If said guy is reading this, I think you and my gf would totally hit it off! =)", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

You also get half a soft boiled egg, green onions, and nori. We added garlic to the broth, which tasted delish. We paid extra for a whole egg - you can tell it had been marinating with sake and soy sauce.

It's definitely different from a pork bone broth but that was good because that means it's less fatty.\n\nMy favorite part was the noodles. They're THICK - and I like my noodles thick.

I went with second spiciest (basically the highest level where you don't have to pay extra).  That was probably a mistake.  Not because it was too spicy, but because it overpowered the flavor of the broth.  It tasted more like chalky chili powder than it did like tonkotsu.  Maybe the broth just wasn't that distinctive if it couldn't stand up to the chili powder?  The kakuni (pork belly) was nice; tender and heavily infused with 5-spice.  The noodles were decently chewy.  The bamboo shoots were a bit too chewy.  The seaweed was soggy from noodle steam after a quick walk home.

I had a hard time choosing which food truck I wanted at SoMa StrEat Food Park, but I am so glad that I decided on Torraku. The Tonkotsu Kakuni Ramen and Kakuni steamed bun were both filled with flavor.\n\nTo order you fill out a card with what you want in your ramen. There is a veggie ramen ordering sheet and a meat one. On the meat sheet there are five different broths to chose from, with your choice of either seafood, pork belly (Kakuni), or pork shoulder (Chashu) filling. You then check off your desired spiciness level and whether you want garlic or not. The bowls come with a soft boiled egg, green onions, seaweed, nori, bamboo shoots, and noodles. \n\nBased on recommendations from the staff I ordered the Tonkotsu Kakuni Ramen. I chose fried garlic and mild spice. I was debating between medium or mild, but was told the medium was pretty spicy so I stuck with mild. I am happy I did because it was the perfect amount of spice for me. The taste of the broth was amazing and was spiced well. The pork belly was flavorful and plentiful. The noodles were firm and tasty, and the egg added a perfect touch with yolk slightly running out of it. \n\nI added on the Kakuni steamed bun for a mere $2.50. I believe this a relatively new menu item, but they should definitely keep it on!

I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen. While the noodles had a nice bite, the broth was thin (for tonkotsu) and had an odd, off flavor, like Chinese 5-spice, or star anise, which is totally NOT a Japanese flavor. The chashu was good, but as I ate the ramen, the noodles got very soggy. My dining partner ordered the Chicken Katsudon, which also had an off flavor, due to the katsu sauce. The chicken was tasteless and was not breaded with Panko, more like normal breadcrumbs, which added to the off flavors. We also split an order of gyoza, which were deep fried, not pan fried, as was shown on their menu. Totally disappointing. \n\nLet's move on to the overall dining experience. The ordering system is totally lame. You have to fill out a little form, checking off what sort of ramen or donburi you want, the level of spiciness, and whatever extras you want. There's nothing to write on, so you have to step out of line to go to the counter or a table to fill this out. And since you're bending down filling out this form, you don't notice the huge menu that's posted on the wall behind you. When you get to the cashier, they review the entire form with you as they enter your order on the iPad. Why make us go through all the trouble of filling out a form when you're going to make us go through it again at the cashier? And why don't you move your huge menu behind the cashier so that you can see it as you walk in? Once you get to the cashier, you notice the beverage cooler hidden in the corner, which turns the space into a bottleneck. \n\nThey've done nothing to the space, other than paint it a hideous red and black. It doesn't feel clean. There are a couple of ceiling fans from the restaurant's previous incarnations, and I don't think they've ever been cleaned. The grease and grime are obvious. And the service was terrible. The guys at the cash register were nice enough, but the woman who brought out the food couldn't have cared less. \n\nWith so many decent and great ramen places in SF, this one can be avoided.", "author": "Kent T."}

When I went there, it was cold outside, yet they had the door open, and you couldn't close it, so the place was freezing.  I ordered chicken katzu.  Several people who placed their order after me were served first.  The dish was cold when it arrived, indicating it sat in the window for a while before it was delivered.  Once I tried it, I knew I would never return to this horrible place.  They gave the impression they didn't about Caucasian customers.  They won't last a year.  BTW, I wouldn't return there even if the offered to pay for the meal.  Don't waste your time trying the horrible place.", "author": "Harold S."}

You don't have to wait in a line for hours just get seated and that was another big attraction. I loved how you get to build your ramen bowl to how you like it and you don't have to worry about them messing up your order either. The egg was cooked perfectly and the noodles were ridiculously good too. Love how spicy the black garlic broth was and finally how lean the meat they used was. Highly recommend this place to anyone who goes out of their way to find lit ramen places. The price was under $15 for crazy good ramen.", "author": "Jayoolian G."}

Always down to vary my selection of ramen in sf, especially for a midweek brunch. \n\nBut unfortunately I have to give their bowl of ramen a 1/5 rating due to presentation and flavor. Not only did my tonkotsu broth not taste homemade, but it was so salty and cloacked by a thick layer of oil I could barely finish half the serving. \n\nToppings came sinking in the bowl and it really just seemed like no mind was paid to how they were layered in. Today's experience tasted like an instant bowl of ramen. And at a price point of $13.05, I'm going to really have to eliminate this spot in my ramen catalog all together.", "author": "Sloane T."}

It's always hard to find vegan ramen as generally the noodles have egg or the broth is meat based. Torraku clearly labels their broths vegetarian and vegan and they are very knowledgeable about ingredients. This is one of the best veggie broths that I've tasted. Fresh veggies, real ramen noodles, and a broth that overall has a great flavor and is not overly salty. I hope they are at Spark permanently as I'll definitely be back.", "author": "Sarah S."}
