The owners are a husband and wife team aka dynamic duo (Chris & Tina), who graciously hosted us with what felt like a 10-course dinner family style.  Food coma indeed!  We literally shut the place down.  From the scrumptious crab to the fresh spring rolls, nobody leaves hungry.  I'd like to suggest bibs please j/k.  The savory dishes make me want to come back for more.  The owners plan on retiring, so if you've always wanted to come try Aux Delices, now is right the time.  \n\nThey have an extensive wine list, and if you're not into wines, there's beer and sake to choose from.  For non-alcoholic beverages, you can't go wrong with Vietnamese coffee.  Parking is difficult in this area...if there's a will, there's a way.  \n\n'Til we meet again ~ cheers and see you on Yelp (SYOY)!", "author": "Christine R."}

The environment of this place is nice and cozy, perfect for a date or gathering with friends. \n\nThe banh xeo (Vietnamese crepe) was HUGE! Perfectly crispy with tons of meat and other fillings. This is much better than the banh xeo my mom makes haha. Came with a ton of lettuce to wrap in and yummy fish sauce for dipping. The noodles with imperial rolls were great! Definitely would recommend either ordering that dish and maybe even imperial rolls for the table as well bc those were delicious. Bo luc lac (filet mignon cubes) is one of my favorite dishes of all time and this one did not disappoint. \n\nDefinitely a great spot for Vietnamese food with reasonable prices and very friendly service!!!", "author": "Courtney N."}

We had 12 people and were separated into 2 tables, one near the front and one in the back. \n\nI was not particularly wowed by the food. I think the prices are a bit high for the quality/ amount of food you get. The service was pretty good but it was on the slow side. \n\nFor some reason, I thought I'd judge a Vietnamese restaurant by its quality of pho broth and it was a mistake. I received a tiny bowl of noodles with lukewarm soup that lacked any kind of pho flavor. Yeah, so don't order a pho here. I do not think it is what they are known for....\n\nMy friends ordered rice/ noodle combination platers, which I'd say are your best bet here.

It has a comfortable feel, reminds me of places I used to frequent with my parents as a kid, super clean, perfect amount of lightening, a quiet vibe to it, and just the right amount of Vietnamese flare.  The staff is extremely attentive and usually it's open enough for immediate seating.  I was in the mood for some Pho and it did not disappoint.  Grabbed a large serving of the Chicken Pho and it was well more than I needed but first I ordered the Imperial Rolls!  This is a MUST, their imperial rolls are incredible with all the fixings such as lettuce, mint, and parsley to wrap them in..simply perfect.  In fact I just might make a meal of the Imperial Rolls next time.  I added a side of brown rice for good measure and my meal was complete.  Such a great price for everything as well.

I found myself craving a bowl of Pho while in Russian Hill, Yelped this little spot right up. Let me tell you, I can see myself becoming a regular here. The location of this restaurant is incredibly convenient, there aren't any other Pho spots near Russian Hill. When I say this isn't your typical Pho spot, I mean it in regards to the atmosphere and service. Unlike other Pho restaurants, Aux Delices has an elegant interior with an intimate appeal. \n\nFood:\nBanh Xeo\nVietnamese crepe. Crispy pan fried crepe filled with prawns, pork, bean sprouts and onions   13.00\n\nPho Tai Hay Ga\nBeef or chicken boodle. Slices of rare beef or chicken with rice noodles in a traditional beef broth  10.00\n+added meatballs to chicken boodle for an extra 2.00\n\nWe tried the Banh Xeo which is basically a fried crepe with prawns inside, it's an interesting concept and it was super tasty! I would definitely order again. We also got the Pho bowl, which is the main reason why I visited this place. I got the beef and the boyfriend got the chicken flavor. They were both pretty legit Pho bowls. The dishes were all well portioned, typically 2-3 bucks more than an average Pho restaurant, but it's worth it. \n\nService:\nIncredible service. Both the waiters and bussers were very attentive and friendly. My water glass was never empty, which I always appreciate.   \n\nAtmosphere:\nThe interior is more on the fancier side, but still maintains that casual vibe. You get the atmosphere of a romantic restaurant but without the pressure of dressing up or getting too formal. I think that's why I liked this place so much, you can get a bowl of Pho but still have that intimate dinner experience.", "author": "Stefany Z."}

Came here for lunch with the brother. \n\nWhen we came in, this place was almost empty, only couple other customers...we came in at the time when it was getting close to closing time for the lunch time before dinner hours. There was only one waitress waiting in the front who deal with the customers during the lunch hours and she was all in the back when we walked in\n\nGive us the lunch menu when got to the table. Has lesser selection for lunch. We wanted the ca kho (caramelized fish) but wasnt on the menu. It was until we ask the worker if they have it which they actually do...so then she gave us a different menu which has more option of food to choose from(probably it could for dinner). When looking at their menu, it has a variety of vietnamese authentic food to pick other than Pho. Most of their food are comfort food that i eat at home so its not the usual food you see from most vietnamese restaurant\n\nThings i ordered:\n\nCa kho(caramalize fish): it was good and very flavorful but its very saucy that its better to eat with rice. You can eat the sauce and rice itself too. When the waitress first brought this dish to my table, my brother and i thought it look kind of burnt because of the dark color it had. I smelled the burntness too. But when you eat it, it actually doesnt have that burnt taste. \n\nHad the beef skewers(#43). Comes with 2 sticks of the beef and has some vegetables in the middle, peanut, fish sauce to dip your meat, and couple slices of oragne. The meat had good amount of marination that you dont really need to dip any sauce\n\nHad the crab, egg, asparagus soup. Very yummy. Plenty of flavor. Has enough salty and peppery flavor.\n\nI like how each of the dish that we got came out hot. Not sure since there wouldnt many customers at the time we went\n\nAll the foods that my brother and i were good but i thought it was a little expensive for a vietnamese restaurant. The portion of the food of each plate that we got were more like for 2 people so it wouldnt be good for large group. If you go with large group and get the food that we got, you may need to get double in order for everyone to have more than enough. Unless you get all of dishes, thats no problem.\n\nIts different if you get the noodle soup or rice plate since you can eat that on your own since it meant for one person\n\nAfter i left this place, not sure what they put in the sauce, but i had some dryness to my mouth. \n\nEven though it was only one person working and it wasnt pack, each dish came out at a reasonable time. I enjoy the food here. Would definitely come back again and bring my whole family here\n\nParking around here can be rough", "author": "Julie N."}

It finally happened last weekend! He did mention that parking is tough so he had his friend (Uber driver) drove us. We got there about 6pm on a Friday. A few people are eating - not so busy yet. He knew the lady who owns it (I believe \"HA\" was her name) so he said hi at the bar. She remembered him! She was a really nice lady. My bf decided that he will order the dishes by himself so I was like - OK. make sure they're really good. He goes, 'trust me on this'. We started with the Vietnamese Pancakes - I am not usually a fan (I usually go with spring rolls or egg rolls to start with) but these ones are flaky and tasty. For entrees: we had the Steak (BF ate it all since it was cooked Medium - i do my steak Medium Well), Garlic Noodles - so delicious and garlicky (just enough garlic - not too salty) and Crispy Chicken - this one was my FAVE. The BOMB.COM. The sauce was too good to be eaten on its own. The chicken was breaded and crispy even with the sauce. Unbelievably good. We ended our dinner with the flan as our dessert. I was going for the fried banana but the BF opted this one for a change. It was on the sweet side for me but heck, we ate the whole plate too! The place got busier as it got closer to dinner time.

We were staying in the neighborhood and walked by several times before deciding to stop in for dinner, in part because we were apprehensive about taking our 9 month old son to an \"upscale\" place.\n\nWe were more than delighted by the service we received. The staff was extremely considerate of our son's needs: his highchair was placed on a tablecloth when we were seated, and he was given a sippy cup of water and a small bowl of chicken porridge without us requesting either. He ate all of the porridge and clamored for bites of our food as well!\n\nAnd the food! My partner loves salmon but I hate it, so he makes a point to order it when we're out. He raved about his Caramel Salmon and insisted that I try it. Let me go on the record as saying that the only time I have ever had salmon that I could tolerate, much less enjoy, was at Charlie Trotter (RIP). That is, until I tried his Caramel Salmon. I don't know that I would order it for myself, but I enjoyed what I tried, and would try it again. And that is about the highest possible compliment I could give to salmon. I had the Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong - also delicious, but not as noteworthy as the Caramel Salmon. We finished with the fried bananas, which our son also devoured.\n\nTraveling with a small baby is hard, and dining out with a small baby is even harder. It's rare that a nice restaurant also makes kids feel welcome. It's even rarer that a nice restaurant where kids feel welcome also has food that both adults and kids will enjoy.

When I came here with a friend a few days ago it was very busy but we were seated quickly. I don't know much about Vietnamese food beyond pho, so I wasn't sure what to to order. The menu was pretty user friendly and I ended up ordering a glass noodle dish with veggies in a garlic and ginger sauce. The dish itself wasn't to my liking but it was well cooked and the vegetables were fresh. My friend had the pho and I tried it and it was good. \n\nThe restaurant is well decorated and seems to attract a mostly local crowd. The service is a little slow but they are busy and it's to be expected. We also tried the thai iced teas and of course, they were delicious. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the food and the staff was upbeat and happy. That says a lot about a restaurant. Will definetely return.", "author": "Sam W."}

My eating partner in crime and I had just arrived in San Francisco after being in Mexico for a week.  We were incredibly excited to finally eat something Asian.  Expectations went even higher when a regular there had reaffirmed that this was the best Vietnamese place in the city.\n\nFor whatever reason, about half way through the meal, I came to this sad realization that everything reminded me of Chinese takeout.  Harsh, I know.  The garlic noodles aren't much more than garlic flavored lo mein, while the crispy chicken in sticky sauce struck an oh too familiar chord with general tso's chicken.\n\nI will say that the imperial rolls are some of the best damn spring rolls I've ever had any place, anywhere.

We had:\n\n-Cha ca: Grilled fish w/ onions served in a hot stone pot that you assemble as a lettuce wrap with vermicelli noodles, cilantro, and a special sauce. DAMN DELICIOUS! It's a little labor-intensive if you're lazy, but otherwise very much worth it. It can get a bit messy, so wouldn't order this on a first date, but I was w/ my parents so idgaf. \n\n-Imperial rolls: Served pretty much just like the cha ca, to be eaten wrapped w/ lettuce, pickled veggies and that fish sauce. I've never eaten it this way, but it should always be served like this! \n\n-Garlic noodles + chicken: Huge hit at the table and went perfectly w/ the added chicken. I honestly think it would be a bit boring without the chicken, but of course this is a side dish. \n\nSo would I willingly go back? Probably for a weeknight dinner, or if my parents came to visit and didn't want to venture to Clement Street.\n\nOverall, worth a try for Vietnamese in Russian Hill--just venture off into the less common dishes like pho.", "author": "Allison C."}

I ordered Ca Phe Sue Da (the iced coffee that drip-brews on your table), and Grilled Pork with an Imperial roll and fried rice.  I got what I ordered, but not what I wanted: the pork consisted of 3-4 thin slices -- there was probably more pork in the Imperial Roll than on the plate.  Speaking of the Imperial Roll, it had a strange musty taste, as if the wrappers were stored in my grandmother's basement.  The fried rice?  Bland and soggy.\n\nBut the surprise of the evening was the coffee.  When it was served, the waiter asked \"you know how to do it?\"  I gave him a strange look, but a polite \"yes\".  5-10 minutes later, the coffee hadn't even stopped dripping when he shows up to take the brewing part away.

For once I was $hafted pretty hard! :-o. \n\nDid a quick search for Vietnamese in the city and looked at the hits. Aux Delices (The Delights?) came up with lots of positive write-ups of people who are connected to me. OK that's a start.\n\nWhipped up the trusty Yelp app on the Winblows Phone Nokia Lumia 920 (don't hate, it takes great pictures...but the app still needs further improvement) and decided to order the \"Yelp tourist\" tried and true dishes based on the tip$ offered.\n\nThe menu has a pretty broad spectrum, and doesn't appear to be your average pho and spring rolls shop. But it is also not like those fancy fusion super upscale type places either.\n\n6 pm on a Saturday night, and while parking was extremely scarce, the restaurant was otherwise rather quiet. \n\nPho Tai - comes in three sizes....tall, grande, venti. The \"tall\" size would be ok for a quick snack portion, kind of like really traditional old style won ton noodle shops in Hong Kong like Mak's on Wellington St in Central. Asked about other beef cuts, like tendon. Denied. Just straight up beef...and the beef was rather chewy and dry. At these prices and rent I'm not expecting fresh unfrozen beef but hey... decent broth, with bare minimal MSG if any, ok noodles, but mediocre beef. Recommended if you are not an adventurous eater.\n\nGarlic noodles - The toned down butter presence is perhaps heathier, but really needed more of a garlic kick. Otherwise this was saved (by me) with some non rooster chili sauce (which they provided in a little cylindrical holder with a spoon on the side).\n\nBo Luc Lac - Despite knowing that I might butcher the language, but not in a bad way, I ordered \"Bo Luc Laaahc\" with the Vietnamese waiter. And he replied back \"oh you want the Shaking Beef\" in his heavily accented English. I was like ok dude, whatever, I tried. So.....I need to ask, is there a difference between Bo Luc Lac and Shaking Beef? The same dish right? Well something was missing... BLL/SB  should be a no brainer filet mignon cubes stir fried and perfectly seasoned, juicy, medium rare, and have that killer umami from the soy sauce and other seasonings (hell you can put Maggi sauce and cook that till the cows come home, as long as it is good). After having ridiculous beef stir fry dishes by the greats (Yums Bistro and Ming Kee's former stir fry chef), this was a complete let down. All I tasted was soy sauce, not enough black pepper and other seasonings, and a lack of an intensive wok sear and carmelization. DOH! (and that does not mean \"dude\" in gangsta speak).\n\nThe cha gio (fried spring rolls) I had were equally puzzling. Very dry and the exterior seemed a bit too solid and thick. Of course I wasn't expected the rice paper roll version fried. But is this neighborhood scared of fish sauce? It was not served with any (granted the cha gio were sampled from another bbq pork rice plate) and even some weak fish sauce would have improved the taste of the dry cha gio a bit.\n\nOrdered a caf\u00e9 sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk) and apparently it was forgotten until the end of the meal. I purposely did not ask to remind them since the meal wasn't exactly my style with the way it was going, but later waitstaff came back and apologized....so I got it in a to go cup. Not bad...at least it was indeed the drip kind (but already mixed and poured in), and not the vanilla caramel latte stuff like Lee's or Brodard in the OC.\n\nI'm not going to be the person who blames other reviewers for their good reviews.\nBut one thing of note, the 5 star glory days are mostly from 5 to 6 years back. Hmmm...\n \nPerhaps for lack of other options as well as the neighborhood this place is in, this would be ok. But absolutely not my style.

Pet peeve, but, yeah... I get it.\n\nFirst impressions were: \n\n- Clean dining room\n- Decent ambience \n- Quick/friendly service\n- Large menu\n\nWe had one pescatarian, and one genetically predisposed hater of cilantro, so the first test was having the fresh spring rolls sans pork, and sans cilantro. Waiter didn't flinch, just said ok - no problem. First test passed... \n\nRolls arrived quickly! Shortly after our promptly served bottle of wine & beer, complete with a crisp, frosty beer mug. Bonus points here.... (I love frosty glasses) The rolls themselves were pretty good, obviously fresh given the dietary needs of my companions, but the dipping sauce was more reminiscent of a carmel, peanut sauce hybrid... A little runny, but overall decent taste-wise, but not my favorite... Luckily they brought along a little monkeydish of chili sauce that helped us through.\n\nFor my entree I ordered Bo Cari Thai, a spicy beef curry with coconut milk & basil sizzling in an iron pot... Not the most Vietnamese of choices, but the name and description sold me. It arrived as advertised, really really hot and still bubbling within the cast iron cauldron. The fragrance was killer, just what you'd hope it would smell like. First taste was very positive, well seasoned, great aromatics and a rich coconut broth. Beef was tender and flavorful, and the vegetables seemed to have a French julienne, which, given the name of the restaurant and Vietnamese food's history, made me happy. \n\nFor desert, one friend banana with coconut ice cream, and another fried banana with a Grand Marnier flamb\u00e9... Again with the French touch\u00e9s (get it?). The regular fried banana and coco ice cream arrived as advertised, but the flamb\u00e9 banana arrived next... The waiter quickly doused with booze, and set about to flamb\u00e9 right at the table. Took a little while, but he did well by it. I appreciated this little demonstration, as you don't see it much these days. Flavor-wise both were enjoyable, and pretty much how you'd expect them to taste. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nBill came to $100 for three entrees, one beer, one bottle of wine, two desserts, and one appetizer. Not bad at all. \n\nSummary? Well, Aux Delices will probably see me again... It wasn't overwhelmingly great, but had some moments of greatness and also a few of mediocrity. I am curious to explore the menu a bit more after seeing some other reviews, and will update this review accordingly (if need be).  \n\nIn general; solid food, good service, reasonable prices. \n\nEnjoy :)", "author": "Will S."}

Some other reviews in here say the pho is light and fragrant, I call that bland and unflavorful.\n\nIf you're craving Vietnamese, honestly just make the trek down to the TL. They'll fire skeet rockets of flavor to explode in your mouth hole for half the price and twice the portion. Maybe I'm just spoiled from living near Garden Grove for years, but connoisseurs stay away.\n\nIn summary, small portions, high prices, mediocre food, and average service. Only giving it 2 stars for location, which I probably shouldn't because that location could be used for something much better.", "author": "Mat K."}

Our waitress kept pressing us for our dinner order without giving us much time to review.  She apparently got annoyed and sent in \"the closer\" who was the definition of rude.  He wanted our orders and he wanted them now.  Not even 5 minutes after they were placed our meals showed up.  We weren't even halfway through our apps.\n\nIt went downhill from there.  As we are eating our meals they started to close up the restaurant.  Music was turned off and they were on a mission to get every last guest out of there ASAP.  I finally asked what time they close and why the rush - apparently they close at 10pm (on a Friday which is ridiculous).

I liked it a lot, but for noodles, it was kind of pricey\n- Ca kho: catfish in a spicy caramel-sauce served in a clay pot - it was only $12 but was a pretty small portion.  The sauce was good, but it had way too many bones in it\n- Ga nuong: it's nice that all their chicken is white meat.  The grilled filets were flavorful, not too dry, served with romaine, good as a lighter option\n- Bo xao dau hu: tofu stir fried with beef, shiitake mushrooms, just ok\n- Com chien: pork and prawn fried rice - not too flavorful on its own, but good as a base for the sauce from the catfish and beef/tofu dish\n\nOverall, I had hoped for more flavors and slightly larger dishes at this price point.

We usually share everything when eating out so I asked DH in front of the waiter if he wanted brown rice (to go with the chicken) and the waiter rudely interjected, \"He's getting noodles.\" WTF. I didn't ask you, nosey!! If my husband and I wanna share plates that our business. You do the order taking, the cooking and the billing!\n That didn't sit well with me. After he left DH mentioned that he saw some fine print onthe menu with fees regarding spending minimums per person. I find that a little tacky for a restaurant. I understand if you offer free wifi, couches and other amenities and don't want peeps loitering around, but anyhoo, I digress.\n\nVermicelli Salad - \nWas sad. It had little sprinkles of crushed peanuts that were hard to differentiate from the little sprinkles of beef on top. The waiter told DH that the salad dressing was at the bottom and he had to toss the salad around to mix it with the noodles and everything else. Since when??? They're supposed to serve it in a dish on the side because the dressing naturally sinks! The noodles were hard and similar to cup of noodles style noodles. There were a few shavings of vegetables in the mix. It was pretty sad watching DH fiddle with that dish. \n\nBasil Chicken - \nCan't complain. The dish had basil and chicken and some spice, but not much else. I was glad we were able to get our protein from somewhere. \n\nService - \nOur waiter looked like he hated life. \n\nOverall - \nWe felt duped and it was the worst meal experience of our trip.

Maybe we just got unlucky and got a particularly grumpy / unhelpful waiter, but he just seemed to really not even be trying to pretend to be helpful or friendly or any of the usual things you'd expect.   It felt like he was annoyed any time we asked for anything (really basic things, like a slice of lemon, and some plum sauce - I was just trying to add *some* flavor to the soup I got), which just really ruins the dining experience if you feel like you don't want to \"bother\" your waiter.   \n\nThe final straw for me was that when ordering I'd asked if I could get some mint or basil with my noodle soup, and he said they didn't have any (which I thought was very weird to not have any in a restaurant that does Vietnamese noodle soups.  my fiance thought maybe this was because they're \"French-Vietnamese\" style.  me: \"oh, so they must be going for \"French-style\" service as well!\")\nThen, after we were done, I saw another table someone got a noodle soup and there was a plate on the side with the standard add-ons - bean sprouts, mint, basil, etc!!!    I couldn't believe it!!    Either he was lying because he didn't feel like getting it or there was a misunderstanding / language barrier.... but if you work in a restaurant and don't know \"mint\" and \"basil\", then you probably shouldn't be a waiter taking customers' orders!", "author": "S.

It's fast, it's delicious, and the price is RIGHT!\n\nI love coming here on a cooler night (most nights in SF) and grab a bowl of their beef noodle soup, their chicken congee or their stir fried satay beef noodles. \n\nThe beef noodle soup (the pho) is not too overpowering or salty but just the perfect amount of flavor you would expect from a bowl of pho. If you are a pho purist, you may not love this place but I like it for its convenience and flavor. \n\nThe chicken congee is how my mom would make it - comforting, subtly flavored with a touch of ginger to warm you up. It is the chicken soup for my soul and I love a nice hot bowl when I'm craving comfort food.\n\nThe beef satay noodles packs a punch and just the right amount of satay flavor. If I'm feeling *mildly* adventurous I would go for it and it warms you up with a slight kick (but not too spicy for wimps like me)\n\nFinally, I should also add a shoutout to the bun cunh, the steamed pork dumplings. These aren't your typical pork dumplings but delicate rice paper filled with minced pork and mushrooms. They're not much to look at but once you add a little bit of their fried shallots with the fish dipping sauce, your tastebuds will thank you profusely.", "author": "Karen K."}

Both exceeded my expectations.  Although the food was very good - the service was just okay.  They waited about 10-15 minutes before coming over to the table and taking our drink orders.  They also forgot to place one of the food orders in our party entirely, which sent the server into a bit of a panic (and caused us to have to wait a while for everyone to have their food).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-14", "description": "I'm normally pretty picky about eating Vietnamese food out; I'm Vietnamese and am generally wary of \"fusion\" Vietnamese food and upscale Vietnamese restaurants because the food is usually less authentic, less tasty, and overpriced. I decided to check out Aux Delices because my boyfriend and I were craving Vietnamese food and didn't want to go to a hole-in-the-wall place for dining in.\n\nAux Delices is very charming and upscale, but still had touches of Vietnamese authenticity that I appreciated (the art and music mostly). The food was not very authentically Vietnamese, but Aux Delices is marketed as a more French-inspired Vietnamese restaurant, which I think is an accurate description.\n\nThe food was pretty good; I especially liked the caramel fish. In general though, everything was way overpriced (you can find most of these dishes in a hole-in-the wall Vietnamese restaurant for $5-$8 each, as opposed to $15). You're paying for the nice ambience and dining experience when you eat here.\n\nAlso, as a general tip about Vietnamese food -- if you want pho, don't go to a fancy restaurant like Aux Delices. You're better off going to a cheap pho restaurant, where pho is their main dish. There's a lot more variety and it's significantly cheaper.", "author": "Jackie C."}

My mom wanted to go somewhere in the city that was nice, not too expensive, and that would get her United air miles. She sent me a list of about 200 restaurants to choose from. The only stipulation was that she didn't want to go to a Japanese restaurant. That narrowed the list down to about 100 to choose from but what a chore it was. I finally decided upon Aux Delices based upon the yelp reviews. \n\nFinding the place was easy, but finding parking in the neighborhood definitely was not. After about 15 minutes of circling the block in larger and larger circles, I finally found a place about 5 blocks away and one of those blocks was VERY steep, especially in the pouring rain. Nevertheless, we arrived just in time for our 8:00 reservation.\n\nThe restaurant was rather small, but with nice decor. Service was a little slow, even though we were quickly seated in a nice booth. They had a large menu and it took a while to narrow down our choices. On a side note, I did find it rather funny that there were about 6 menu items listed under Pork, and 3 of those choices were beef. Beef was also listed under Beef.\n\nWe decided on the spring rolls for appetizers. Although they tasted quite fresh, the prawns were somewhat lacking in taste and the peanut sauce was a little thin. I've had better. \n\nThe main dishes were what made this restaurant stand out. We shared the garlic noodles with chicken, prawn skewers, and grilled pork with fried rice. The noodles were intensely garlicky and oh so good. The grilled pork was perfectly seasoned, and there was enough for each of us to have 3 good sized pieces of pork. The fried rice was okay, but not spectacular. What really stood out though was the prawns! I don't think I have had prawns that were as good as those in a long time. Quite a surprise after the lackluster prawns in the spring rolls. The variety of tastes and textures made for a very pleasant meal.\n\nWe also ordered Thai iced tea. Definitely not one of the better Thai iced teas I've had, but I suppose a Thai restaurant would be a better place to order that than a Vietnamese restaurant. My friend ordered the lemonaid, and it was quite fresh, but had a little too much sugar.\n\nWe came in quite hungry and had plenty to eat and were pleasantly surprised that the total bill for the meal with tax came to just over $53 for the three of us. Not a bad deal at all for a good meal in a nice San Francisco neighborhood. We would definitely go back if we found ourselves in that area of the city again.", "author": "Debi T."}

I can't say that I just stumbled across this restaurant, it had been on my radar for a long time - however, even having read reviews, I was expecting a solid but standard Vietnamese restaurant. I was wrong. The menu was extensive and unique and I just wanted to order everything. I went in with my mind made up that I was ordering pho - standard - but upon browsing through the menu, I realized there was a much bigger world of delicious food out there. Therefore, I branched out and ordered #15 the Bun - Noodle Salad with Sauteed Chicken (all white meat) with Lemongrass. It was fabulous! A great balance between fresh and savory. I personally never order meat when I go to an Asian restaurant - perhaps because I am usually weary of the quality and I'm not a huge meat eater to begin with. However, I took my chances this time and was really happy with the results. \n\nMy boyfriend had the beef pho and the dumpling appetizer. Both were good choices as well.\n\nWine prices are very decent - I think my glass of Viogner was 6 dollars - not the best wine in the world but it was certainly suitable for the dinner. They have bottles for $23 dollars - that's an average of $4.60 per glass...not bad.\n\nThe best surprise of the night came as I was eating and thoroughly enjoying my dinner. I said \"I really wish this place delivered\" - come do find out, they do! $20 minimum and an extra fee (not stated but guessing 3%) for using credit card on all deliveries. I have a feeling this will become my go-to delivery restaurant, along with Yukol Thai, I can't give that one up.\n\nSpeaking of minimums, there is a $10 minimum per diner which I guess could be a little frustrating if you only want one of their $8 meals (of which there are a decent amount) - however if you are dining in, treat yourself to a glass of wine or sake and you're good to go - if you are doing take-out, any dish is probably worth about $10 anyhow so I'd just consider that the menu price and pay the $10 without a fuss. \n\nAmbiance is decent as well. Really, this is a fantastic, affordable restaurant with a wide variety of menu items. On a final note - I had no issue with the service as was mentioned in other reviews.

These were decent.  Very flavorful, fresh, and well-made.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and had a good atmosphere.   \n\nThe Bad:  Our waitress kept on asking us if we knew how to eat the appetizers.  We told her yes every time she asked us.  My parents grew up in Laos and Thai Land.  They have ate Thai, Vietnamese, and Laotian food all of their lives. The waitress made a comment on how we were eating the crepe, \"That's how you guys eat that?\"  My mom was simply cutting the crepe into pieces with the knives provided on the dish so that we could each take a piece of the crepe.  Bad form on the part of the waitress.\n\nThe main food is what I didn't care for.  Mainly because I was expecting something that tasted more \"Vietnamese\".  What I got looked like a Vietnamese dish, but it tasted more like a Chinese dish. My parents and I all agreed on this.      \n\nConclusion:  Go here for the appetizers, but not for the food.  You won't get authentic tasting Vietnamese food here. The waitress we got definitely didn't help our experience.", "author": "Meng V."}

However, I must say this dish is disappointing, the catfish is burned, sticky to the bottom of the clay pot, the caramelized sauce is too sweet for my liking, and there is no \"kick\" to it, I mean you have to add a little red pepper flakes and pepper to give this dish an interesting flavor. My Indian boyfriend actually loved this dish when he tried it one time at another restaurant, so we have been ordering it at Vietnamese restaurants when we go out, but even he said that this is too weird for him and it made him not like caramelized catfish dish anymore, since it's weird that he thinks catfish was drenched in a sweet caramelized sauce...\n\nSecond dish was even a bigger let-down...we ordered chicken with ginger and lemongrass..this is not even authentic Vietnamese dish, it tasted like Chinese (per my Indian bf, and I agreed with him) the sauce was again too sweet, and also it's watery, the onion was not sauteed well, it tasted just like boring boneless chicken pieces  dipped diluted, watery hoisin sauce...I thought it was the simmered chicken that sauteed with lemongrass and ginger like my mom used to make...anyway this dish is not good at all..\n\nI would have to say that their service is really good though, their servers actually were friendly and I saw that the servers were talking to customers just like chit chatting so it seems that they do have long term customers, but honestly this place is an Americanized, kind of pretentious Vietnamese restaurant that I would not go again...I mean I would love to go back since it's a cute place, but the food is a complete let down and so I guess it will not be worth it..", "author": "Quyen N."}

Not every dish is the *best*, but all are very good - I find that to be the true challenge at most vietnamese restaurants.\n\nI will say that I wouldn't recommend the Pho as the best - it's a bit too beefy for my taste and there are other places in the city where it's more of a specialized dish. What I ate and would recommend are:\n- Canh Chua (tamarind sour soup with tomato, pineapple, and prawns) was excellent.  The perfect amount of spicy and the right balance of sweet and sour.\n- Banh Xeo to be authentic (I'd recommend asking for extra lettuce to wrap it in, it's a large portion and wrapping it in lettuce cuts some of the fried grease). \n- Ca Kho To (braised catfish in a claypot with a savory sweet caramel sauce). This is one of my favorite dishes and I'm so happy to find a pretty good version available in the city. It's a little on the heavy side, but as long as you have plenty of rice to sop up the sauce you'll be very happy\n- Green Papaya Salad with Calamari. The calamari is sliced into slivers almost as thin as the papaya which actually makes the whole thing more enjoyable. Good balance of sweet and sour. \n\nThe fried banana and coconut ice cream was a hit at my table.

We tried a bunch of things of which the only thing I really liked were the garlic noodles because they had a strong savory garlic flavor and a good texture.  Other than that, I found everything a tad too oily.  The caramel salmon had a very strong sauce that couldn't entirely mask the fishiness of the not-too-fresh fish.  The beef was pretty tender but entirely forgettable.  Lemongrass tofu had a good flavor but too much oil.  Crispy chicken tasted like a fresher and mildly better version of Panda Express.\n\nBy far the weirdest event that happened at Aux Delices involved one of our waiters.  My friend ordered an ice tea that came with unlimited refills.  Halfway through the meal, our waiter brought over another ice tea - we assumed it was for my friend since she was almost done with her first glass.  She took a sip from the second one.  Ten minutes later, the waiter appeared and asked for her ice tea back.  Confused, she handed it back to him, after which he went back to the bar, added two slices of lemon, and trotted it to the table next to us!  Apparently, they had also ordered an ice tea and the one the waiter brought us was meant for them.\n\nHonestly, I understand that sometimes things get brought to the wrong table and I'm more than willing to give it back.  However, shouldn't the waiter realize his mistake within a few minutes?  If it's something like iced tea that costs approximately 3 cents to make, shouldn't he just have poured a fresh one for the table next to us?\n\nWe got out of there before they could swipe a half-eaten dessert from another table and give it to us.", "author": "Sonia C."}

The sauces are always dead on and everything is really fresh. Favorites of mine include the white fish with dill and sake sauce, Chao Ga (any of the soups) or the squid and scallops with ginger garlic sauce. The imperial rolls are also quite good and have a nice crispness without being greasy.\n\nMy one qualm is that many of the dishes could use more vegetables, but I chalk that up to the style of French Vietnamese cuisine. It's also not the cheapest way to go, but I've never once been disappointed with my food. I will desperately miss this place if I ever move.", "author": "Leah Y."}

I think it includes some other cultural influences on some of their dishes.\n\nCalled in for reservations for a party of 10 for dinner. They scheduled us in for 6pm. They weren't that busy when we came in on Saturday. They encourage having a \"fix menu\" for dinner for parties of 10 and larger. Meaning you choose 2 appetizers and 2-3 entrees for your party and they make 2.5 servings of each dish. It comes out faster for the group and makes it easier on the restaurant because they don't have to individually make 10 different dishes. I understand the restaurant's request, but 2-3 entrees for my group was not enough and we ended up ordering 2 more single dishes. So you can take a look at the menu online their website. I know it says 2006 menu, but it's basically the same but prices have changed. They encourage to place the order prior to coming to the restaurant for the group to expedite the food - but honestly, the food comes out really fast anyway.\n\nI didn't get to see their wine list but my friend ordered two white wines to complement the dinner and they were perfect! I ordered for the group: spicy papaya salad, spring rolls, shaking beef, catfish in clay pot, stir fry vegetables, some chicken and calamari curry. The papaya salad is very spicy! The spring rolls were OK - I've had much better. The catfish and shaking beef were delicious!!! I did not care for the stir fry vegetables, chicken dish or calamari curry. I don't recommend them; plus they weren't a typical \"vietnamese dish\".\n\nThe iced coffee is strong here and very good. The fried banana and ice cream is delicious here!! Definitely save some room for dessert.\n\nParking around here is a major pain. It took us 20 minutes to find parking. The restaurant does offer $10 parking. Where do they park your car? I have no idea.", "author": "Melissa T."}

'eat here, it has fabulous seafood.  the place across the street also has great seafood, but since you're here...try it, you won't regret it.'\n\nWell how can one not take a recommendation like that! Plus I was really craving seafood.  We had:\n\nStarter:  Sampler platter...pretty darn good imperial rolls\n\nEntrees:  Mixed Seafood with Vegetables (I think it was #57) - yummy lots of veggies, but not enough seafood and it was a bit too saucy for me.

I even dare to say this is even tastier than The Slanted Door version....and THAT is sayin alog since The Slanted Door is really one of my ALL TIME favorite restaurant.  The dish had just the right amount of carmelized sauce and spices...oh I didn't want to share this dish, but seeing how we were there for a celebration I had to share....but next time I ain't sharing!\n\nDessert:  Fried Bananas and Vanilla Ice Cream.  I'm not typically a Fried Banana dessert fan...I think I overdosed on it as a kid...so I don't tend to order this, but wow I was pleasantly surprised by how much I LOVED it.  It had just enough batter on the banana to be tasty and not overwhelmed (you know what I  mean...sometimes it seems like you're just eating the batter and no bananas!)...\n\nIt ain't cheap.

I used to eat here ALL the time when I worked a little closer to the location but last night I made a special trip because I was CRAVING it. My boyfriend and I were surprised to see a jam-packed restaurant! That's awesome. I always wondered why more people hadn't discovered it - now they clearly have!\n\nWe started with the fresh spring rolls. These light, rice paper-wrapped delights are sooooo flippin' good. Just thinking about them now makes me want them for breakfast! With rice noodles, bean sprouts and prawn they are a great way to start any meal. We followed that with the Vietnamese crepe. Oh man is that good. It's deep fried, yes, but the flavors are amazing and you wrap the crispy crepe up in lettuce and add a flavorful fish sauce and it's just plain amazing - the hot crepe and the cold crisp veggies - is to die for.\n\nThen we ordered the pork and prawn clay pot - always a favorite of mine. It's like eating dessert and dinner in one. The sweetness of the sauce over rice is really delicious. And with that we had a more savory item, the lemongrass beef. I completely forgot to order the salt and pepper prawns this time which are also a favorite - but that just gives me a reason to go back sooner.\n\nIf you haven't tried this wonderful restaurant - now's the time.

I pretend I'm a vegetarian sometimes, and it's so easy to get great DAF-less (dead animal flesh) delicacies here.\n\nThe coolest thing about it is that a lot of the food has a \"make it yourself\" quality to it.  I appreciate the interaction factor, although I don't appreciate the way they sometimes look at me as if I'm doing it wrong.  If my crab wrap things fall apart, just go with it... (yeah, I eat crab, told you I PRETEND like I'm a vegetarian).  Their pho looks incredibly tempting, but I feel so badly cheating on Bodega Bistro that I haven't ordered it yet.  I have the hardest time ordering here because, honestly, everything looks so great.  The sugarcane crab things are a MUST for a shared appetizer, other than that I try to order something different each time.  I haven't been disappointed yet.  You can't beat a wine carafe for under 15 bucks!\n\nSomeone said this place was like a reasonably priced Slanted Door.

And, it was cooked perfectly medium-rare just like we asked. \n\nLike seriously, lets take a moment to reflect on the buttery amazingness......Amen.\n\nAt one point, Julie and I considered pouring the buttery garlic sauce into our cups for a little drinky drink.

Aux Delices hit the perfect spot for those three criteria!\n\nThe casual and pleasantly decorated Vietnamese restaurant has these long booths which is conducive to group seating with plenty of table space for dishes and individual settings and swinging elbow room. Great for a group of 5-8 people.\n\nThe waitstaff are very sweet and attentive. When I mentioned my friend's reservation, turns out that she had not arrived, but two other of her friends that I did not know were outside waiting. And he gave me the option to seat first or hang out. Before the group conversation gets too boisterous later in the dinner, I decided to be social one-on-one and introduce myself instead. Bold, bold, bold step for me, but it was definitely worth it to ease the selection and sharing of dishes.\n\nAux delices's dishes are plentifully set up for sharing! We had 5 people in our party, and everyone had a substantial taste for each dish.  We ordered the spicy green papaya salad with squid, Vietnamese steamed dumplings, Vietnamese vegetarian crepe, caramel salmon, shrimp skewers, shaking beef, and another 2 dishes, which I can not remember. As long as you don't swallow three peppers in a row, the green papaya salad is not spicy. I love peppers!\n\nThe papaya salad, salmon, crepe, and steamed dumplings stood out, and I am craving them right now. The bill came out to be a very affordable $17 per person, including tip. All five of us were dumbfounded. Seriously? For a delicious meal sans complaints and happy faces? For that much food?

The Banh Cuon, nice and traditional, simple and delicious.\n\nWith dinner we ordered a bottle of Gruner Veltliner, perfect clean, crisp with a bright acidity that paired well with most our dishes. For dinner, we enjoyed BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Caramelized Clay Pot Catfish, Sauteed Garlic Green Beans, and Garlic Noodles....the garlic noodles were so good, we had to get another order! Yummerz! Everything is done to perfection, the Clay Pot Catfish came out hot and bubbling and the sauce was perfect drizzled over the garlic noodles. \n\nFor dessert, we all shared an order of fried bananas and coconut ice cream!

The tofu dish was more mediocre, but then again, we probably should have asked our waitress for a suggestion on that one. \n\nBonus points for very moderate prices and comfortable decor that is just nice enough to be a good date spot but casual enough to be unpretentious.

The service was fantastic, the waiter and waitress who was serving us constantly brought us water and remembered what we ordered.\n\nThe aesthetics and service of this restaurant is fantastic but it does not cover up the mediocre food that was served to us.

The noodles did not have any flavor and felt average at best.\n\nNow there are some other things that made this experience even more mix. When the waitress started to serve us our entrees, she realized that the appetizer wasn't even there yet. I give her props for remembering what we ordered but I felt that they shouldn't have forgotten about the appetizer since it wasn't all that busy. This is not exactly the restaurants fault but the people that were sitting next to my girlfriend and I were ridiculous.

And the two fish dishes I had were really stellar, and at a much better price that I would have expected.\n\nI came here with a friend who loves this place and I left totally in agreement.  On my friend's recommendation we got the Cha Ca ($12) \"Grilled Filets of white fish over fresh dill & green onions with sake anchovy sauce\" which was a bowl very tasty white fish with a sauce and herb mix that made every bite a delight.  It was hard to pull myself away from it to try the caramel salmon ($11) while it was still piping hot.  The salmon dish was a simply cooked salmon in a very hot caramel sauce.  My sweet-adverse friend loved it too and didn't think it was \"too sweet\" which is rare.\n\nOur friends had one of the rolls and loved it, though their salad was \"just salad\" our third friend got the vegetarian chow-mein and loved it so much he got another plate of it.  I tried a little and it didn't change my dislike of chow-mein, but he seemed totally satisfied.\n\nTheir unfiltered sake ($4 / $6.5) was also great.

After working all day and commuting an hour each way, when I get home, I rarely want to cook. Heck, most of the time I don't even want to leave the house.  Unfortunately, this means that I tend to order the same basic things for delivery - Thai, Chinese, pizza, and Indian food.  Over and over and over again. \n\nWhen I found out that Aux Delices delivered, it was like the heavens opened up and smiled down upon me.  Maybe that's a little extreme, but it is so nice to have something new to add to my delivery rotation. I like the 5-spice chicken, garlic noodles, and pho. My fella is basically stuck on the beef skewers and even has me order them for him when he is not going to be home for dinner so he can have them as a midnight snack. Delivery is really prompt and the place isn't too expensive.  And can I just say again how thrilled I am that the food isn't Thai, Chinese, Indian or pizza?", "author": "Rebecca H."}

I was looking for parking in a 3 block radius on a weeknight  for about 20minutes until I found one.  Now if you can overlook the parking this restaurant is worthwhile.\n\nIt was really empty on a weeknight.  I heard it gets quite crowded but fortunately we found a day when there was no crowd.  We got seated in a booth with pillows at the end and cushions on the benches.  I thought it was a nice touch.  There were only 3 other tables occupied and there were two ladies next to us that were very loud, you could only imagine how much louder it would be with more people.  \n\nSo we ordered a sampler tray for starters.  It has Imperial Rolls, Dumplings, and Spring Rolls.  The Imperial Rolls and Spring Rolls were good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The Dumplings were  odd to me and it was my first time tasting it.  It reminded me of Dim Sum, and basically was a noodle with ground beef inside.\n\nFor dinner we ordered a clay pot of pork and shrimp in a caramel sauce (Heo Va Tom Kho).  This was really good! The meat was very tender but not chewy.  The sauce was so good, I kept throwing it over my bowl of rice.  I would have been happy with 2 orders.  The other dish we ordered was (Bo Luc Lac) Beef filet mignon cubes lightly sauteed with garlic.  When my friend ordered it, I didn't know what to think, but when I tasted it.  Wow, the flavor really hits you as well as the tenderness of the meat.  \n\nThe price is very reasonable for two people at dinner.  The portions were just right and filling enough for us, but not enough to skip dessert.  We decided to get dessert elsewhere but with time running out and us getting tired we ended up retiring for the night.  \n\nI really enjoyed having dinner here and will most likely come back to try some of their other dishes and maybe improve their rating but if you are teetering whether or not to go here, I recommend you do.  Just remember that finding parking is a huge hassle, but if you can overlook that minor setback, you will be in for a treat.  4-4.5 stars for sure.", "author": "ed c."}

I moved to the \"TenderNob\" area about a year ago and have been searching for a great Vietnamese place for takeout/delivery on those nights I just don't feel like cooking. Found it! The Sampler Platter w/ imperial rolls, fresh spring rolls and dumplings is fantastic. I was very impressed with the flavorful sauces and ample serving of fresh herbs (cilantro, mint, etc.) Also ordered the Ga Kho (Chicken in a caramel sauce) and really enjoyed it with some jasmine steamed rice. Delivery was very fast, too! Always a bonus. Can't wait to dine in at this restaurant. Also having a roof party this summer and considering ordering food from Aux Delices instead of cooking! The price is a bit more than other Asian style places in the area that deliver, but it's completely worth it.", "author": "Jessica M."}

I had the sauteed broccoli with chicken, it was definitely not as much volume of food as the noodle dish, but that was just what I wanted. I also got a side of brown rice, but when I go back, I will probably skip that. If you want a light meal - get one of the meat dishes without an additional side. If you want a more filling meal, get a noodle/rice dish, or else a side with your meal.\n\nI will definitely go back: my meal was tasty and a good value!\n\nAlso, they were VERY good about filling the water glasses!\n\nFor groups...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-12", "description": "YUM!\nTaking a break from studying for finals, I decided I needed (and deserved) some delicious comfort food, something preferably hot (due to the cold, rainy day we're presently having).  When I don't know what I want, I usually turn to Yelp and check out top delivery places requested by you lovely yelpers.  What sparked my interest?? Pho! Yes, warm noodley pho... yum!\nSo I decided to try out Aux Delices as result of the mostly positive reviews and the fact that it's so close.  It was definitely a good choice... the only drawback is the $20 minimum for delivery which is hard to reach for one person. But now I have a lovely (huge) green salad that I can eat for lunch tomorrow!\nFor dinner, I decided on the vegetarian spring rolls and the chicken pho. Both were so delicious! The spring rolls are basically filled with fresh veggies and noodles, and then wrapped in greens and thin sticky rice paper and is served with a clear-ish sweet sauce.  Some places tend to use mint in their spring rolls (which I'm not a huge fan of) but these did not, I wasn't starving, so I only planned on eating one of them, but they were so good that I would be lying if I said I didn't eat both :)\nThe chicken pho definitely hit the spot, my mouth is still tingling from the jalapenos and sriracha (I heart spicy food). The medium order is quite large for one person, so I definitely have more for tomorrow, so nice to be able to get several meals out of one order!  My only complaint about my order was they didn't provide chopsticks! It's just not the same using a fork and spoon to eat Pho... next time I'll definitely make sure to request some.\nAnother plus is that they originally said 35 minutes, and I'm positive it was only about 10 from the time I called. Overall the food was delicious and I will definitely be ordering from them again in the near future.", "author": "Emily S."}

No apologies, no excuses - - no nothing.  \"Do you know what you want?\" was pretty much how we were greeted after 30 minutes of waiting... silently.  \nNow to think of it, they didn't even greet us when we walked in.\n \nWas it crowded, you ask?\nNo.\nWere they understaffed?\nNo.\n \nI don't KNOW why.  It was four people in a perfectly lighted booth and not a single person came by during all that time to even LIE that they'd be back to take an order.\n \nThen the drinks and food were finally brought out.\n \nWe ordered a soup which came out rather lukewarm and tasteless,  BLAND.\nWe ordered a pork chop - - - it was like pork with galbi marinade.... mediocre at best.  Too sweet.  Funny that I ordered the pork w/ lemongrass.\nWe ordered a shaking beef type of thing  --  allegedly filet mignon.  Mediocre - - nothing notable about this dish and not worthy of the highest priced item we ordered at $17.\nWe ordered garlic noodles - - unimpressive again.  Bland, tasteless, but amongst its peers on this night, it came in second.\nWe ordered the only crab they had on the menu - - offered at market price.  It was covered in something and then deep fried - - too dry, no flavor once you got to the meat, and totally messy.  The latter was more our problem than the restaurant's - - but all in all, this dish was not worthwhile.\nWe ordered the duck -  and this was perhaps the best of all, and it also - - like the others, hovered within mediocrity.\n \nWe asked how the duck was - - his answer was:  \"It's made in an orange liquor.\"\nNOT quite what we asked, but OK.  What a salesguy.\n \nThen a woman server brings the coffee order over.  I had ordered an iced coffee while my girlfriend was having it hot.\nShe asked if we'd ever had Vietnamese coffee before, and we said yes.  I took the chance to remind her I had ordered an iced coffee - - can I get a glass of ice to go with this coffee, please....\nHer answer:  \"I'm going to bring it, I only have two hands.\"\n(NO - she didn't...  oh yes, she did.)\n\"I see that.\"  (Thinking to self:  invest in a f%&^&*$ TRAY, woman, it's a damned restaurant!)\n \nService sucked.\nParking was impossible, no valet - - and typical Polk Street mess, even on a Tuesday evening.  Wine list was unimpressive... but they did have at least one of all the common varietals.\nTotal was $160 including  tip, breaking down to $40pp.  I'd have rather spent double and eaten somewhere good, or one quarter and had a feast at In N Out.\n \nFood was somewhat edible, but with Bong Su, Slanted Door, or THE HOUSE in existence, or even Crustacean or PPK for crab and garlic noodles  - there is no conceivable reason that I'd ever eat here again.\n \nTotally unacceptable.\nAnd I will never understand how y'all are giving this place 4-5 stars.", "author": "Grace K."}

When we walked in we were immediately impressed. The decor and overall ambiance is not what you typically associate with a Vietnamese restaurant -- really nice with an intimate vibe. We sat down and nearly immediately ordered our regular -- fresh spring rolls to start and bowls of soup. Not 3 minutes after ordering did we look around and have pre-dinner food envy -- why, oh why, did we order PHO?! Don't get me wrong, I love a solid noodle soup and Aux Delices' pho does not fail to impress, but their other options looked amazing! I'll have to review this place again after our next visit (there will be another, I'm sure), but I get the feeling that Aux Delices is the place you go for solid Vietnamese food whereas the hole-in-the-wall shops are the better options when you're just looking for a no-frills huge bowl of pho.

The pork and rolls combo noodle salad is also really great-it's yummy and filling, AND I leave happy because I had a \"salad\" for dinner which makes me feel healthy-Hehe! My boyfriend usually gets the shaken filet mignon cubes sauteed with garlic which are excellent- flavorful and tender. The owners are really nice as well.

The server counted the number of entrees we ordered (2 less than number of people, though there was enough sake) and kept trying to get us to order more...usually, we tend to order a second round based on what we like, and thought she was being too pushy. The Garlic noodles were good - the rest of the food was nothing spectacular....standard fare.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-01-21", "description": "The food at Aux Delices cannot merely be eaten, it must be experienced.  When you place that first forkful of food into your mouth, suddenly you are transported away.  No longer are you sitting in a restaurant, but floating in the vast spaces of the universe.  The planets and stars swirl and dance around you.  The flavors rush into your mouth like waves on the beach.  They slowly rise from nothingness.  Closer and closer they roll like a deep thunder from a distant storm.  As they grow nearer, they begin stumbling and crashing upon one another, so anxious for the one brief and beautiful moment when they can feel themselves writhing upon the moist warmth of your pallette.  Finally, they crash themselves upon your tongue in a frothy orgy of pure culinary bliss.  As soon as it has begun, it is over.  They retreat into themselves, back into an ocean of flavor until you take that next bite.  Soon everything disappears, and it all turns to nothingness.  Only colors remain.  Vibrant hues of blue, green, yellow, red, and orange.  The faces of everyone you've loved and everyone you will love appear before you.  All you feel is the warmth that emanates from the comfort of being reconciled with the world and everything in it.  Some would call it the rapture.\n\nEating at this restaurant reminded me of that scene in the movie Hook, where after a long, hard day of training Robin Williams to be Peter Pan, the lost boys all sit down and have a huge feast.  Everybody's eating this gooey, paint looking type stuff, which apparently was delicious.  Ever since I saw that movie, i always wanted to taste that gooey stuff.  I imagined what this paint food might taste like.  Flavors both strangely exotic and new, yet oddly warm and familiar.  Flavors that simultaneously exploded in your mouth with zest and vigor, and also languished upon your pallette in their soft and understated subtlety.  Like a home-cooked meal from your grandma, except your grandma is a orphaned boy from some magical island who never ages.  This is my dream.  Aux Delices has helped me take one step closer to this dream.", "author": "Eddie L."}

There aren't a ton of pho places in Russian Hill, and I would say at least once a month I'm either ordering delivery, take-out, or going all out and dining in the restaurant.  Although last night my experience pretty much turned me off to the place all together.  My boyfriend and I just wanted some pho, so we stopped in to grab a cup ($5) of beef pho for him, and a bowl ($8) of chicken pho for me -- yes, I eat more than my boyfriend.  The waitress looked at us and said, \"no, I'm sorry but you'll have to order more\".  My boyfriend looked at her in confusion and when asked why, the server replied \"it's a $10 minimum for all food\".  My boyfriend pointed out that our meal combined came to $13, and I'm no mathemagician but I'm pretty sure $13 is more than $10.  Regardless, she said \"no, you have to order a medium\".  We were pho hungry at this point and didn't feel like walking over to Sweet Aromas, so we said screw it and ordered the medium.  Now don't get me wrong -- I completely understand the need for a restaurant to have a minimum.  But I have never been in a restaurant that refused to serve me CHEAP items that are clearly listed on the front of their menu, and I hope they take the $17 that we ended up spending last night and buy a nice calculator.  But for now, they can simply subtract me as a customer.", "author": "Courtney K."}

Although we walked in without reservations, we were seated within ten minutes. For starters, I was extremely happy to see lychee sakitinis on the menu. So naturally we ordered two to start the evening. They were delicious. Sweet and refreshing!\n\nWe started with the lemon grass soup with shrimp. It was really good. Flavorful broth filled with mushrooms, bean sprouts, shrimp, sweet pineapple and lemon grass and cilantro. Next, we got the shrimp and sugar cane rolls. They sounded really unique and interesting, so I was very excited about this dish. When the waiter brought it out, I had a very \"shocked\" look on my face. They came unprepared! You were suppose to roll your own rolls! Although I love to make spring rolls, I was not really in the mood to roll up my sleeves and to start rolling. Of course, we did and it wasn't half bad. My only compliant was the rice wrappers were WAY too small for all the ingredients. (noodles, lettuce, shrimp and sugarcane, and cucumber) So it was a bit tough. Also, it wasn't fresh shrimp... it was mashed up shrimp meat.. sorta like patties. Overall, they were good, but I wished we were warned prior to ordering.\n\nFor our main courses, we shared the snapper fillets with basil, mushrooms, and ginger. VERY tasty. The other dish was fresh tofu with veggies. It was a good dish, but not that special. Along with a side of brown rice, our tummies were very happy. \n\nThe good news, for all this, our bill came out to be only $55! What a deal. I would definitely recommend coming here for an authentic Vietnamese dinner.", "author": "Denise L."}

That is really really tight, almost or just as good as Pagolac.  Then after my acupuncturist kept reiterating that I should eat more \"warm, cooked foods,\" when my lazy butt doesn't want to cook I come here for light, tasty basil chicken.  Then I went back to Pho and my hubby and I started trekking down to LIttle Saigon every weekend.  Yes, Turtle Tower rocks, but besides that, I wasn't soo into any other pho.  I kept thinking, Aux Delices is better, and it's local, and plus its run by that sweet family... So now I come here ALOT.  And I'm always satisifed.  \n\nThey've got a great M-F lunch special too.  My husband loves the Ga Chien, sticky sweet garlicly chicken kind of like Sesame Chicken only awesomer.  \n\nThank you, Aux Delices.  Loves ya.", "author": "Ashley S."}

The hostess, servers, and waiters were all very attentive and prompt, yet none of them were pushy or rushed. My normal pace of eating is somewhere close to that of a hoover vacuum. It is placed in front of me, and within three minutes, my plate is cleared and I'm ready for the check. \n\nAt Aux Delices however, they do not serve the next portion of the meal until the dish that they had previously set down was cleared. Yet on top of this, we were not forgotten by the wait staff, who made their continuous rounds filling our cups and making sure we were enjoying ourselves. This made for a relaxing dinner that was truly enjoyed.\n\nI highly recommend both the Salt and Pepper shrimp, as well as the pork/shrimp dumplings.

I've had great french vietnamese food at Bui in Berkeley. However, Aux Delices seems just to be another vietnamese place. Located in Russian Hill, this small restaurant has slightly kitchy decor. The staff was very friendly and once seated we immediately got tea (very small cups of it). We started with the spring rolls, rice paper filled with lettuce, chicken, cilantro, carrots, and shrimp with a peanut dipping sauce. They were okay, I thought the chicken tasted a little weird, I also would have liked to have basil in the rolls. The peanut sauce was fine, I added some chili sauce to add spice. Next we had a ginger beef noodle soup. The broth was delicious and aromatic, and the beef tasted buttery. The egg noodles were a chewy addition. Mushrooms and veggies were plentiful. Our last dish was fried chicken in a sweet garlic sauce. I was thinking this was going to be similar to some spicy chicken wings I've had before with fried basil. This was completely different, but the chicken was still good. Overall, I liked the food, but since I was expecting more french influence, I'm not sure it lived up to that. I personally would go to Bui for the french/ vietnamese experience.", "author": "Kate A."}

When it's chilly and you are in the mood for something simple and hearty, the pho can't be beat - the broth is clean yet flavorful - and all the accompaniments are fresh. On those warm days (or if you're wanting something a bit on the lighter side), order yourself a \"Bun\" (Noodle) Salad with the combo of grilled lemongrass pork and imperial rolls. My favorite appetizers are the Imperial Rolls (the best I've ever had), Vietnamese Crepe, the 'fresh' Spring Rolls. If you are lucky enough to have friends who are into 'family-style' sharing, you must get the Shaking Beef, Crispy Chicken, Pan-fried Pork Chops, Grilled Fish with Dill (Cha Ca). When it's crab season, I always order the Pan-fried Crab and the very tasty Garlic Noodles...I'm happy to share the noodles but no one gets the crab...it's too good to share! The prices are reasonable and even it's not as upscale and trendy decor-wise as some of it's brethren, I chose Aux Delices every time. The Ngyuen Family is so welcoming and accomodating, they make you feel a part of their family so much so I chose to celebrate my birthdays with them and my friends.

There are so many- TOO many places to go if you live here full-time, and since I'm just part-time, I am always looking for the best of the best. That doesn't mean the most pricey or the most trendy, just the most delicious.  I could eat Vietnamese food 4 or 5 times a week and have tried several options here. However, the one place I find myself thinking about when I get back home is Aux Delices. Translated, it means \"to joy\", and their food does bring my palate joy. It is clean VIetnamese food, with a French touch-not heavy or sauced to death, but finished nicely. Their #54- a grilled fish dish with dill and shallot hits the PERFECT note. It  comes with fresh herbs and lettuce and vermicelli noodles on the side and you can ask for  the rice wrappers on the side. The traditional method of eatng this dish is to wet the wrappers and then roll a small amount of the deliciousness  up like a spring roll. (I am still working on my technique). Or you can  just ask for rice and not wrappers. Either way, you get the pleasure of a light, and flavorful VIetnamese dinner. This place is family-owned and operated and they are the warmest and friendliest people you could ever hope to meet. The service is spot-on and the prices are more than reasonable-especially for the Polk Street setting, where some places think quite alot of themselves.  There is no bar to sit or eat at, so it's just straight to your table, unless there is a wait (and there is on the weekends).The decor is warm and everything  else I have eaten here is very, very good.
