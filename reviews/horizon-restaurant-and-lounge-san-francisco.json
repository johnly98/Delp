The club was reserved for a private event in advance with an agreed upon price, and upon arrival the club continued to add additional charges including charging for tap water - which is illegal in the state of California. Additionally, the security was rude, dismissive, and let in random people from the street while refusing to let in guests on the designated list.

Firstly--the security is rude, overly aggressive, and has zero training on what a fake ID looks like. We actually had to call the police in order to get them to give back some of our group members' real out-of-state IDs. The security constantly manhandled members of our group without cause, and seemed to have no rhyme or reason for letting people in or out of the club, because we were actually prevented from leaving. \nThen there was the issue of the water. Even though we've had water provided for us before, they did not put out water or provide it when requested (by many members of our group). We were given several reasons: only those 21+ were allowed to drink water, you had to pay for water (illegal in California?), they couldn't serve water because of the drought. This was a ridiculous experience. \nWe also had booked the entire club and had wristbands for members of our group, and yet there were random strangers let into the club during our event.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-01-01", "description": "My friends and I came here for the NYE party (Dec 31, 2013). We all bought the all-you-can-drink \"VIP\" tickets ($59.00 ($62.06 w/service fee), general adm. was $20.00 ($21.69 w/service fee), which really turned out to be a mistake.\n\nThis place is understaffed, and the staff they have is poor. Here's the full picture:\n\nWe arrived around 10:30 p.m. and wanted to check our coats. We waited by the coat check for about 3 minutes, but no one was there. Eventually a bus boy passed by and we asked him where the coat checker was -- he told us they had quit that night. Based on other reviews people have written, my guess is that they just didn't have it open. So we carried our coats around most of the night.\nSidenote: This place is pretty small, too. So don't be surprised when you thought you were going to some big party. Also, they never announced who the DJ(s) would be for the night; the music was pretty average.\n\nWhen we finally got around to getting drinks, we went to the \"VIP\" section, which is just the smaller bar in the back. There was only one bartender serving 25-30 people. So there was plenty of waiting for drinks, averaging around 10-15 minutes per round. I complained, noting that this was nonsense, since we had paid \"the premium price\" but were receiving \"less than average service.\" We put up with this until 11:59 am.\n\nIn the middle of the dance floor, there was a bag full of balloons suspended from the ceiling. At 12am (Happy New Year!), a staff member pulled on a string to attempt to release all of the balloons (about 20 of them). The result was that the entire bag came down, and no balloons came out. Brilliant execution. \n\nFollowing that fantastic countdown, we went back to the \"VIP\" section and ordered drinks. I tried to take my drink out of the VIP section (something I had done 3 times already that very same night). The small female \"SECURITY\" guard told me that I couldn't do that, and that she \"already told me that.\" I explained that she had never told me anything about that, but she insisted that she knew who I was and that I was trying to trick her. As a result, I told her that she, like everything else about Horizon, was terrible. Her response, \"alright, that's it, you're out of here.\" She crushed the cheap plastic drink in my hand and started pushing me. I didn't really bother fighting, since it wouldn't have been much of a fight. She was about 5 feet tall. \n\nSo I got kicked out of Horizon on New Year's Eve, and it was probably for the best, because I didn't have anymore patience to deal with such absurd, sub-par service. It was a total waste of money, and I hope that you think twice before supporting this business. \n\nRead other people's reviews; there is a general consensus that this place is poorly managed/staffed, and the service is whackaroni & cheese.", "author": "Alex T."}

It has the loungey feel to it but there isn't much to lounge on. \n\nWe stayed in the back where the 21+ spot was and there were luckily a few tables and booths and stools around. The bartenders all looked young but they poured some pretty stiff drinks. I guess we came on a really bad night because the crowd was looking pretty sad. And by sad I mean there wasn't much of a crowd. The bathroom totally grossed me out but what nightlife venue isn't unsanitary? They didn't have any paper towels to dry off your hands.

By 7:45 there was a few other tables I noticed most of us were using the restaurant.com coupon. Perhaps an ominous sign for a restaurant considering it was Friday in hopping North Beach.  \n\nOur waitress was friendly and on point the entire night. The food was surprisingly good. My partner had a generous portion of ribs. I had some kind of fish, I forget, but what I remember is the amazingly seasoned mashed potatoes. I usually don't even like mashed potatoes but these were so delicious! The cocktails were good too. \n\nSo where did they go wrong?  They didn't know how to calculate the restaurant.com certificate. It took about 20 minutes to get our check. We wanted to subtract the coupon, then split the bill between the two of us - easy - never been a problem before.  When we got our checks they were not split evenly, and a tip was added that we figured out to be over 20% - closer to 25%.  We always tip about 20% on the total of the bill before the coupon is calculated in. It's a shame the waitress felt like she needed to do that without any explainationa bout how our bills were calculated. The original bill was not incuded at the end for us to compare how it was split either. \n\nI probably won't go back to Horizon.

Everything was $5 only so boyfriend and I ended up ordering 7 dishes!  \n\n~ Beer Battered Calamari: came with fried asparagus and shrimp and there were at least 5 pieces of shrimp too!  Anyway, everything was seasoned really well and it came with a soy dipping sauce and a sweet chili sauce (the one for lumpia).\n\n~ Crab Cake: this was my least favorite dish.  It came with one crab cake and the texture was off.  The outside was hard and seemed more like a fish cake.  I couldn't taste any crab either =/\n\n~ Slider with Skinny Fries: mmM...the burger was cooked medium to order and the beef was very tender and juicy.  Loved the caramelized onions in it too.  FYI, if you add cheese, it's an extra dollar.\n\n~ Buffalo Chicken Wings & Drumettes: our order came with 4 wings and 1 drumette.  This dish was decent...the sauce was more tangy than spicy and I would have liked it more spicy.\n\n~ Kobe Beef Nachos: best dish of the day and sooo worth it.

First off, as we started eating, I noticed a large table of Asian kids right next to us.  Asian kids in San Francisco, no big deal.  But at a closer look, turns out it was Quest Crew from MTV's America's Best Dance Crew!!!!!  I knew I've seen them from somewhere before so that was pretty neato.  I didn't ask for a picture or autograph or anything because that's just lame and if you do end up getting a photo with those guys, everybody you show it to would just see a bunch of asian kids and wouldn't be able to discern it from any other cultural club college photo.\n\nAnyway, onto the food.  My gf coined Horizon's risotto as \"paying $16 for American jook.\"  I don't think that's a compliment.  I tackled the chef's choice burger and while it was good, it was a bit too messy and not worth $18.   I also had high expectations for the parmesan and truffle oil fries, but very disappointing as they were over fried and overly salty.  On the flip side, I got to use my Restaurant.com $25 coupon so the meal only came out to $22.  \n\nA fair warning: the parking right outside Horizon and across the street has signs that say cars will be towed after 8PM so make sure to get your cars out of the area if they parked on the street by that time!!!!!", "author": "Albie F."}

The burger was good in the sense that it had high quality ingredients but it wasn't that tasty -- I was slathering on the ketchup. The fries were reallyyy good though. The lycheetini and cucumber presse are really good as well.\n\nThis place has a very mature, minimalistic modern feel to it -- very different, especially for a burger joint. However, they don't need to have a snotty attitude just because they're more upscale. And when I say they, I'm referring to one of the bastard bartenders.\n\nMe: Hi, can I have 2 slippery nipples?\nHim: Sorry, I don't have stuff to make goofy drinks like that.\nMe: Ok... can I have 2 buttery nipples? [I've never had a slippery nipple so I was thinking maybe it was too weird or something... I don't know!]\nHim: This is a high end bar. How about I get you a cranberry f*ing something?\nMe: ...What?!! Are you serious?\n\nThen he proceeded to leave and serve another customer without taking my order. \n\nI have no idea why he gave me so much attitude -- it's not like I was drunk and being obnoxious and I definitely wasn't rude. I'll give HIM a cranberry something, stupid f*er. And I KNOW that the bar has the alcohol for \"goofy\" drinks because I had B-52s with a friend from another bartender there.\n\nTherefore, I am never coming here again. Plus driving around forever only to not find street parking and then paying $15 to park at a lot makes this place even less worth coming to. Maybe I'll consider coming again IF and ONLY IF management gets rid of that douchebag or gives him an attitude adjustment.\n\n*12/10/07 EDIT: Soon after I wrote this entry, I was contacted by the PR guy and a fellow Yelper informed me that the bartender was fired. I don't know if all of this was legit [my friend still needs to follow up on this because he knows one of the owners], but it's good enough for me -- I'm over it. They can have 1 more star, haha.\n\n*12/15/07 EDIT: So even though I said I would never come here again... I actually went last night, but only because I was hungry & really had to use the bathroom so yes, I had a $50 late night \"snack\" at  a place I swore I would never go to just because I wanted a clean bathroom to use haha. BUT this place is good! I noticed the pretentious prick of a bartender wasn't there (but he may have been on the lounge side) so that was a plus. And the food & service were excellent. We ordered the skirt steak, salmon, and tater tots. I must say, Horizon definitely knows how to make their potatoes. The fries with truffle oil & parmesan last time were awesome but the tater tots!!

You got the Saturday night \"we be clubbin\" wanderers in all their drunken glory, the out-of-town tourists who \"want to see San FRAN,\" and of course the cheesy gentleman's club laced on every corner.  Not my cup of chamomile tea.  \n\nSo, ask me how I ended up at Horizon, which used to be Sake Lab, which used to be something else?  Blind folded, handcuffed and brought against my will.  Nah, but it felt every close to that feeling once inside.  \n\nFirst of all the bouncers made us wait in the line.  Seriously?  For what?  Because it's such a hot spot?  Because so many people wanted to get into such a poppin' place.  NOPE.  Because they're DB's.  I looked through the window and saw all of 5 people inside. \n\nSo after waiting in that atrocious line with all the hoochie mamas and their leather jacket wearing \"boos,\" I went inside.  The place is a restaurant during the day and early evening, so for the club, the tables and chairs are pushed against the wall to create the perfect \"dance floor.\"  Dun-dun-dun!!!!!!!!\n\nOf course, it was your typical Asian party.  Not hating on the Asian parties, but y'all know how those work.  You got that one group of Asian girls dancing in a circle, drunk already, and the slew of Asian guys standing around them, sipping their grey goose and staring at them, mustering up the liquid courage to ask, \"do you come here often?\"  Except to be c-blocked by that one short brotha (who is obviously there by himself) to get him some Asian-lovin'.  \n\nThen all of a sudden, at around 12 midnight, the dance floor is filled.  The dj yells into the mic, \"where all my single ladies at?\"  To which, a roarish scream comes from that one group of girls who started dancing at 9pm and have now taken 500 photos of themselves. \n\nThe music that night wasn't too shabby, it was your typical hip-hop, top 40. I even got up to dance, but somewhere along the line, the music stopped twice and it made the drunkies mad.   I kept looking at my watch and after I felt like I got enough \"QT\" with the folks I came with, I peaced out!\n\nThis time I will not be deceived by another name change.

Inside it's elegant and comfy - with an intimate dining area a central U shaped bar that dissects the space and a sophisticated, modern lounge area.\n\nThe drinks are fabulous - perfect mojito anyone? Or for a fun spin try the scrumptious watermelon version.\n\nAnd the food is lovingly served up by Chef Christopher who is passionate about simple flavors and fresh, local ingredients.

Compliments to you, Chef!\n\nWe failed to make it on time to the preview screening of \"The Men Who Stare at Goats\". Sigh. George Clooney, you're the only old man that can make me swoon... Okay, aside from being chronically late to anything and everything, we missed Happy Hour at 4th Street Bar... Sigh. Until we stumble upon a revelation: \"I'm craving crack fries.\" says Priscella T. \"Okay, let's go get some.\" says I, off to Horizon.\n\nI walk in and try to wave down the hostess to let her know that we have arrived. Tada! I don't know if it's the dimly lit restaurant or the fact that the walls were painted black so it is really hard to see anything, let along tiny me. Well, she eventually sees me but does not acknowledge the fact that we have walked in, until she was done talking to the bartender. WTF?! After that, she directs us to a wobbly table and seats us, upon realizing the table was super wobbly, she moved us to another table. \n\nWe ordered from the 3-course prix fixe meal to share amongst the two of us and let me tell you, the portions are pretty damn good for a 3-course.\n\nFor the appetizer we had the Sampler consisting of Parmesan Cheese Truffle Oil Fries (aka Crack Fries because they are so addicting and delicious; you experience withdrawal symptoms when you're too far away from them), Tater Tots, Buffalo Wings and something I'd like to call \"An Array of Fried Something\"... I can't honestly tell you what that \"Fried Array of Something\" was, but I can tell you it was edible so I ate some of it... Haha. Um, leave it to me to just devour anything that's placed on a plate in front of my face. We couldn't finish this because the portion was sooo big. \n\nOh yeah, my Sparkling Pineapple Lemonade and her Watermelon Lemonade finally made it's way to us. Mind you, the restaurant was EMPTY at this point. No patrons at the bar, no patrons having dinner, just the two of us... It felt a little eerie. The drinks were both refreshingly, good, but I think mines lacked pineapple juice to begin with, but not knowing how the drink tastes, I thought it was supposed to be like that... Hmm, go figure. The Watermelon Lemonade was made to order and I ended up liking it more than my Sparkling Pineapple Lemonade, sigh. I always end up liking something someone else orders... ]= ALWAYS! We saw them use watermelon puree straight from a blender. Yum!\n\nAt this point, the Chef brought out our Seafood Pasta. \n\nThanks for bringing us our entree and then checking up on us! My friend eventually wanted to trade drinks because her drink was too sweet and mines was sour. She has a sour tooth. She wanted the drink to be more sour, so when the Chef was at our table checking up on us, we told him that her drink wasn't sour enough and he immediately had the bartender remake the drink! What an amazing guy! The drink came back WITH pineapple and extra lemons! Hah. Damnit, I tried the drink the second time around and wanted a trade back, sigh. This ALWAYS happens to me! Ugh. Anyways...\n\nThe Seafood Pasta was drenched in sauce. I don't know about you but I love pasta drenched in sauce, literally, like pasta swimming in sauce. I don't know if it's just because I love soupy things like jook,  pho or won tons in soup. The pasta was cooked to al dente, just perfect. They were a little conservative on the seafood though, but the fresh cherry tomatoes floating around were really ripe and added a very nice touch to the dish.\n\nFinally, we made our decision on what dessert we were going to have and we chose the Mojito Cake. Let me say, we made the best decision because the Mojito Cake was absolutely delicious and something I have never heard of before. The cake had a nice minty flavor without it being too overpowering and it came with a virgin Mojito Shot which my friend loved because it was sour. \n\nOverall, the amazing experience was made possible by Chef Christopher Lee and tator tots.

This is what we did. It wasn't awesome, but it didn't suck. \n\nThe one awesome thing about Horizon is that it's actually a burger place disguised as an upscale restaurant/bar/lounge. There are LOTS of burgers. Like, build-your-own Kobe, Organic, Lamb, or free range Turkey burger with such toppings as cheeses, truffles, and various other burger-y things, plus your choice of bun/bread. The possibilities are endless here. I was fairly inebriated upon arrival, which made navigating the many options on the menu extremely difficult. We went with the sliders. They are delicious, if not a little too bread-heavy. Skip the buns and you're good to go. The parmesan truffle fries are the stuff of pornographic food dreams. I would totally come back here and tolerate the place  in the name of those fries.\n\nIt's not that I don't like Horizon. I just don't get it. It feels a bit boxy and hollow inside and everything is very, very BLUE. I don't get electronic music + $20 burgers + drunks + dancefloor + seated dining. It just doesn't all add up for me. It's kind of like Circolo and I never liked that place either. I prefer an establishment that does one thing really well over a place that tries to do three things really well and falls short.\n\n Front Porch's burgers are better and the environment is warmer.

Shockingly, the place was kinda empty. there was only two other couples eating there. But with the economy nowadays, people aren't eating out at nice and pricey restaurants anymore.\n\nThe food here was amazing! there was a prix fixed meal that included appetizer, entree, and dessert, so we ordered those plus their parmesan truffle fries.

It came with anchovies...which I am not a fan of, so I just gave them to my bf.\nBABYBACK RIBS: my bf had this appetitzer and it was absolutely delicious! probably the best part of our meal.

The salmon was cooked perfectly with a hint of pink in the middle, just the way I liked it. It came with mashed potatoes that were really creamy and smooth and steamed asparagus.\nKOBE BEEF BURGER: this was my bf's dish. It was juicy and a little undercooked for my bf (who likes his beef meat well done). It came with pepperjack cheese, bacon, and avocado on a ciabatta bun. \n\nDessert:\nFLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE: I really didn't enjoy this too much. I mean...it was considered healty b/c of the lack of flour...but it didnt taste that good. It tasted like eating cocoa powder. I ended up eating my bf's dessert which he wasn't so happy about. haha.\nRASPBERRY CHEESECAKE: this was my bf's dessert. I'm usually not a fan of cheese cake, but this was really creamy and sweet w/ fresh raspberries. The crust was firm and crumpled in my mouth.  \n\nThe food was great and the ambiance was nice. the only problem I really had was my drink. I had one of their specialty cocktails and it was just wayyyy to sweet. But aside from that, I had a wonderful dinning experience.", "author": "Ivy L."}

Luckily, I never was so unlucky to have visited in the reign of Sake Lab, and this visit to Horizons actually turned out better than I thought it would be.  The boy and I rolled slightly late around 845PM but it wasn't crowded as hell.  It was actually a comfortably packed.  The seats were uncomfortable though, without a back, the bar stool seating they used wasn't comfy at all. \n\nBUT...\n\nThe food was quite good, and so were the prices. Prices were standard, $8 for signature drinks, and entrees ranging from 15-25 dollars a pop, and I believe appetizers and sides ranged from 6-15 dollars.  I don't know about other people, but the standout item from here were the famous \"crack fries\", your choice of fat or skinny, topped with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil. OMG soooooo very very good.  I was delighted to find that my chicken risotto was also pretty good, but the BFs steak tasted didn't really taste like steak.  It was actually pretty disturbing how it so closely resembled the texture of LIVER. EW.  The taste itself was good but the texture...i was soooo freaked out. \n\nThe only problem with the other stuff is that everything was super heavy and rich....after half my risotto I felt pretty gross.  I wish they'd make some LESS heavy entrees for people who don't necessarily want to clog their arteries.........\n\nAND NOW, for the \"lounge\" review.....\n\nOkay, new name, same old face.  By the looks of it, this place still has the same crowd, same music as the old sake lab.  Sure, costs nothing to get in if you're there for dinner, but man....if you paid to get in here, you'll be a very sorry person.  Chock full of people who either:\n\n1) \"Just\" turned 21 for the FOURTH time\nOR\n2) Really just turned 21 and don't have any dance etiquette\n\nThe music was alright for the most part, but the ventilation was pretty bad and eventually with the crowd of scary guys, my friends eventually got out of here. \n\nThus, overall I;d say Id come back again for the food, but not for the \"lounge\" or \"club\" aspect of it ..... 3* for the food!", "author": "Linda C."}

There were about 8 of us in our party and there was NO ONE else in this place the entire time we were there.  While ordering our food the server informed us that they were out of several types of their breads, cheeses, etc.  Uh, ok ... like our choices weren't limited enough.  After ordering our meal around 6:45pm we waited around and around 7:30pm the server came back to us, not with our food, but rather to tell us that they had ran out of another type of bread; so those of us who had ordered it had to change or order.  Great ... so once again the server retakes the orders and leaves.  FINALLY around 8:40pm we get our food, ALMOST 2 HOURS LATER we get our burgers.  CMON NOW!!  there's only 8 of us in the ENTIRE restaurant and you can't dish our 8 burgers?!  Just about everything about the place was terrible .. the parking, the service ... the food was just as bad, and we thought it'd be at least good seeing as to how long we waited for it.  The only pro to this place, was the fact that they gave us a round of free shots and desserts because of our wait.  The desserts were not anything special.\n\nNever going back there to eat again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-11-02", "description": "OK, this review is a bit overdue. I generally wouldn't expect to come to this area for a good dining experience. Maybe because I think of it as the strip club and clubbing area.  Nevertheless, we came to Horizon for dinner.\n\nAnd apparently the menu has already changed a bit (something about no more ribs?)  Which is too bad, because the ribs were just crispy enough on the outside and yet they are fall-off-the-bones soft.\n\nI had the lamb burger.  As a fan of lamb, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was HUGE, too.  So while some others in my party had the sliders, I didn't want any beef take up room in my tummy that was reserved for lamb.  My wife did love the sliderse, though.\n\nThe parmesan fries were awesome - and they were even still good the next day after I put them in the toaster oven. HAH!  Garlic fries could have used a bit more garlic, but then again I'm a big garlic fan and I don't mind smelling bad as long as it tasted good. So maybe for the majority of folks it would be a good amount of garlic.\n\nI didn't order the appetizers so I don't know exactly what else we had. We were a party of eight so the party ordered several appetizers. There was that one with the raw fish in what looked like a martini glass or something. That was my favorite one.\n\nNow, going back to the lamb burger, the only problem with lamb burgers in general is that with all that bun and condiments and whatnot that goes in a burger, the wonderful taste of lamb gets a bit buried. That's why I'm always a bit wary of such things.  Considering how well the ribs turned out, I'm sure the chef can whip up some awesome lamb that'll fall right off the bones too! (hint hint).\n\nAs for the lounge, the four stars has nothing to do with it. The lounge is very hit-or-miss.  We went a few weeks ago for a birthday party and it was never very crowded, so we ended up leaving at about midnight.  Then, more recently, we decided to hang out after dinner.  It got crowded with the quickness.  Both times were random weekends without any special events, as far as I know. \n\nThere used to be Asian parties out here but I'm not sure if they do that anymore. So if you happen to come on an Asian night, there'll be a bunch of Asians, of course. Otherwise, both nights I went there was a mix of people - but the crowd seemed to trend toward being a little bit thuggish. Not my crowd.\n\nFour stars because I'll come back for dinner if I'm headed to this area for clubbing anyway.  However, these four stars does not reflect the clubbing experience.", "author": "Robert L."}

My friends and I often go down to Broadway for dinner and drinks so when we finally saw the doors of this place open, we knew we had to ditch our reservations and try it out. The verdict: Let's just say. . it's been a week and I've already been there twice. ;D \n\nWhen we first walked in we were greeted by the very friendly (and tres chic!) waitstaff and were given the option to sit at a table or at the bar. .so we opted for the bar, seeing as we were planning on having a few cocktails as well. Our server was great, extensively explaining everything and anything on the menu. . And without missing a beat, gave us the lowdown on all their SPECIALTY cocktails ;D (which I'll get into in a bit.)\n\nI started with the Green Bean Salad and went on to a Kobe beef burger with Jack cheese on a ciabatta bun with the Parmesan Truffle Oil fries. . I don't think I put my burger down once. The beef quality was amazing, the bun fresh and fluffy, . . and the aioli was to die for. With my other free hand I was contently picking away at the magnificent Truffle Oil fries which were the perfect pairing to my meal.\n\n. . . and just when I thought it couldn't get any better. . . the chef recommended dessert. . Cherry Cheesecake, also made in house. Ok, now before I go telling you how amazing this cheesecake was. . you must know, I don't like cheesecake. And I hate cherries. BUT THIS!!! THIS CHEESECAKE!!! . . has completely changed my views of all cheesecakes to come. Silky, creamy and absolutely delectable! I don't know what they did or how they did it. . but I sat and finished every last crumb of my little slice of heaven. . and I can promise it will not be my last. Definitely well worth the extra hour on the treadmill.\n\nAt the end of our meal, I was drawn to their signature cucumber martini which I had never seen or heard of before. I took the first sip and after having its refreshing, surprisingly very \"cucumber-y\" aroma wash over my palette. . I thought to myself \"uh oh. . careful now, alcohol is not supposed to taste this good. . you could totally get drunk!\" . . and I would not have minded!

In fact, the bleu cheese was a tad bit overwhelming and really dominated the entire burger.\n\nWhat I have been dreaming about are those amazing Truffle fries.

The bouncer didn't open the door to start letting people in until 9:30. So we waited in line for an hour! I would also see employees getting ready, ice ect.  They were not ready. Once we got to the front door at 9:30ish they attempted to not let my husband in bc he wasn't wearing business dress shoes but I insisted that he was wearing casual dress shoe's and not sneakers (he was wearing dunhams). They finally let us in though at around 9:40. We went to the bar and ordered a our drinks (2) from open bar. The drinks were served in little plastic dipsie cups. we drank those and waited in line for another 15 minutes to get another drink but before we would get drinks they told us open bar was closed. It was 10pm. What a load of s;';';t, they didn't even open the door until 9:30. Common sense would state that if open bar was supposed be be from 9-10, an hour, that they should extended it from 9:30-10:30, since door didn't open until 9:30. Did I mention there was only one bartender, trying to serve 50-100+ people. It said on horizon website they were going to have 5-7 bartenders. I think this was their way of saving money on booze. Drinks the rest of the night were $9 a dipsie cup.\n\nMoving on, the appetizers included those microwavable pizza rolls, warm cheese cubes, green olives from a jar, stale mini cupcakes and pigs in a blanket (which were pretty good). No sign of the chocolate covered strawberries, other than when I saw a waiter delivering some to a reserved table. \n\nWe got the nye hats and ball drop but never saw an champagne at midnight.\n\nIt was a big disappointment considering what we were promised by horizon but it was still a great night bc I got my husband to dance for the first time in public, he has been so self conscience. we are going to honolulu for vacation and he asked me if there are any dance clubs near our hotel!", "author": "holly k."}

I got an angus burger which was perfectly grilled, swiss cheese was melted nicely in my mouth, and the ciabatta bun topped it off. It's the kinda feeling where the food is sooo good that you want to savor every bite. Worth every lil finger lickin penny. Try the lychee martini or cucumber. One thing that my friend pointed out was: Where is the Mediterranean aspect of this place? The lamb...thats about it. \n\nTwo of my friends had the salmon. One described it as \"excellent\" and the other \"simply delicious!\"\n\nATMOSPHERE: Half the place is a restaurant and the other is a lounge. Every seat in the restaurant was filled. They were a bit disorganized handing out our orders, but I guess that is expected with a party so large. This place has a classy, yet had a laid back feel to it. The location is convienently located across from clubs. We hit up Club Latitude afterwards. In response to the person who complained about the backless seats...I was worried about that too...but we were able to coat check our jackets and purses.\n\nThe manager came out in the middle to check how our food was. One of my friends said it was too dark (she couldn't cut her steak), and another had to send back her burger because they put a big fat mushroom on it instead of cheese.\n\nYou gotta get the FAT FRIESSS!!!

Who is going to turn down a three course meal and dessert in the city at a modern looking restaurant?  The experience did not match the price we paid for our meal though, and I somewhat feel disheartened that I have to write this boring review, but I am compelled to share...\n\nThe place looked nice.  They seated us right next to the window at these minimal looking tables with backless stools for our meal... I looked around to see that was the basic set up of the place around the majority of the restaurant.  Stools with no cushions and a minimalist looking table with minimal space to eat.  Great.  These people should definitely call me up later if they're looking to give this place a REAL facelift.  If you want to design an atmosphere in which you want people to enjoy themselves over a luxurious meal prepared worthy of the price you are asking for, you better be for sure as hell be able to provide a comfortable enviroment for oneself to dine in.  Enough of my bitching about the shitty set up.  Looks nice, but there's not much to look at - and when the food doesn't make up for what the place is lacking, you're pretty much assed out.\n\nWe were greeted and waited on.  It took a good minute for them to put out glasses of water while we waited for our chosen menu items to come out.  The table was so damned cramped, they constantly had to clear our dishes after each course - which was fine, but they seemed as though they were hawks snatching up our plates for the last morsel of food before we had the chance to sit back and savor our meal.  Uncool...  If you even have to ASK me whether I've fucking finished with my plate or not, that usually means, \"NO, I've not finished my fucking meal because I still have a fork in my hand...  Do not make me stab you to get that last piece of food I paid so dearly for...\"\n\nTheir menu for that night started off mediocre with oysters on the half shell [4 pieces each person?!], butternut squash soup w/ creme fresh [the creme fresh tasted more like a dollop of sour cream and the soup was reminiscent of baby food], and a steak and potato au gratin for the main course.  The steak was cooked to medium rare how I liked it and the potatoes were crisp and well prepared... the kicker for that meal just so happened to be the caramelized whole onions that was a part of the steak dinner.  I liked it a lot, but it wasn't enough - portion wise - to satisfy my dinner cravings.  \n\nThe chocolate sampler they had was CRAP.  It tasted good, but why the fuck would you give a COUPLE dinner ONE stupid chocolate covered strawberry?!  Think about it: I'm most likely going to be sitting across from my date, so don't you think it would be a little cumbersome to lean forward in your flimsy bar stools to reach across your table too small to accommodate all the various dishes we have, to feed my significant other?  The chocolate truffle was good, and whatever that little espresso cup was filled with too.  More would have been better... because it didn't taste so wonderfully rich and decadent to the point where I was happy with just the amount you shelled out.\n\nThey messed up my friends beer order by accident and the peach bellini's my friend and I had were alright.\n\nNice looking - but that is about it.  I'd definitely go back for the potato gratin steak dish if it were a part of their regular menu, but that might just be it.   The service tried too hard to act pretentious enough to fit the price of our food, but was executed sloppily when we realized one person we asked for help did not speak a lick of english.  I do not fault the person for not being able to help due to language barriers, especially when he is the only one willing to notice we needed some service.  I blame the idiot with the phoney international accent too stupid to notice the table in the corner waiting forever and a day for their food.  The lack of service might have been overlooked if it were busy, but only half the space was occupied while they were trying to set up for their club event afterwards.\n\nParking was terrible.

Fresh spinach, caramelized walnuts, a nicely sharp but dreamy- soft goat cheese, and oven-dried tomatoes all add up to a series of sweet/savory/smooth/sharp bites that are very pleasing indeed.\n\nHubby then had a \"build your own\" sandwich of turkey burger on sesame bun with goat cheese and avacado; mine was the chicken breast on brioche with provalone and avacado.\n\nWe opted to have skinny \"cheese fries\" for hubby rather than the house fries.  Folks, you've never had \"cheese fries\" like this - they were crisp but fluffy, and were generously dressed with truffle oil and parmesan.  They are addictive.  Our server rightly called them \"crack fries\" because you just want more and more.  The house fries that came with my sandwich were very nice - herb fries, delicate and perfecty cooked...but those \"crack fries\" were the bomb.\n\nThe sandwiches were a cut above as well.  The chicken breast in my sandwich was plump and moist, and avacado creamy and buttery, the brioche had been grilled, and it all came toether very nicely.\n\nEven if you're not clubbers, do yourself a favor and have someting to eat at Horizon if you're in North Beach, like maybe the \"crack fries\".\n\nYou'll be glad you did (did I mention that you should get the \"crack fries\"?)", "author": "Kathe W."}

Imagine my complete and utter disappointment when I walked in after paying a cover fee to boot (*grumbles). Apparently it is a restaurant by day and by night they shove all tables somewhere, turn down the lights, and call it a nightclub. It is literally one room with zero effort in d\u00e9cor/atmosphere with \"VIP\" (ha!) booths on one side and a bar on the other. DJ and sound system is weak...I can do better with my Logitech speakers and iTunes library at home. The few other occasions I returned to Horizon (was most likely dragged there kicking and screaming), crowd is NON EXISTENT. In the rare case where there was a (small) crowd, people would be STANDING(?!) on the \"dance floor\" holding drinks and chit chatting. Felt like I was back in the 6th grade at schools dances where all the boys and girls stood on opposite sides too shy to approach each other and be the first ones to dance. Oh but I cannot forget the time where they hired one (eh) go-go dancer to get the crowd going whom everyone ignored. I was actually starting to feel sorry for her dancing by herself faking excitement and trying to be...sexy..?\n\nHorizon is a joke as a nightclub. FYI you will need A LOT of alcohol (which equals cash money) to have a good time here.

We sat down and I ordered a glass of wine and the calamari - J ordered just a coke.... and the wait began. There wasn't very many ppl in the restaurant so I don't know why it took 20 minutes just to get our drinks - in fact we were sitting right in front of the bar so half the table (after dealing with our server) just walked the 3 feet to the bar where they could get their drink in 50 seconds compared to what seemed like 50 minutes. The calamari came out and it was pretty good but by the time that came out (20 minutes after the wine came out), we all needed another round of drinks and ready to order. I chose the Mushroom Risotto and J got the Hanger steak, D and Dan ordered the Mac n Cheese, Spinach and Fries. I ended up trading my risotto for half their mac n cheese.

The steak was great and the mac n cheese was to die for - I ordered an extra one for all of us to share but I ate most of it. \nI wasn't overly impressed with anything and everyone in our party agreed - but it was great prices and certain entrees were delicious but I wish our server wasn't so slow and actually came to our table more instead of talking to her friends and hanging out by the machine.

Granted, it was only 7pm, but we stayed well past 8pm and the place stayed pretty empty except for a few other diners that popped in.\n\nThe menu on the website sound delicious, but once you get there the menu is less than a third of what the web has listed. I was super disappointed by that, as with a brand new restaurant you would assume the brand new menu is updated. Unfortunately, that's not the case here.\n\nBoy had the Oregon Kobe burger, which he was not too happy with. He said it wasn't good, although he was comparing it to real Kobe beef, so... that's probably why he didn't like it. Anyways, I had the tofu burger  which was fried. Eh. And not very tasty.\n\nThe french fries were ok, but very over-seasoned and with way TOO much garlic. The beer selection and cocktail menu are really pretty good, and our server was very friendly and quick.\n\nI'd love to say I recommend going to Horizon, although I would give it about a month before doing so.

Another friend who was organizing got the owner to throw in champagne and cake so I figured this was why we were going to have dinner here.\n\nI showed up with an open mind since I'm all about trying new restaurants.  First off, the tables and chairs are dumb.  The tables are high and so the chairs are high (with no backs).  I get the modern/minimalist look they were going for but comfort was definitely overlooked.  It was really difficult to scoot in since we were on stools.  \n\nSo when we finally ordered, the food took FOREVER to be served.  Food service was terrible inconsistent.  My bf ordered a burger and he got his food last (about 45 minutes - 1 hr after ordering).  I was done eating by the time he got his burger.  I had addressed the manager while we were waiting for his burger.  He told me that because they just opened two weeks ago and because we were a big party, that they were working out the kinks.  I was still upset and told him that it shouldn't take an hour to get a burger.  It was definitely a very frustrating experience.\n\nThe only good thing I could say about the meal was that my chicken was delicious.  It was nicely crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The fries were tasty as well.  However, a friend ordered a tofu burger that was terribly charred.\n\nDespite a good piece of chicken, I would not recommend this place at all.

Since the space spans the corner and behind another establishment, we ended up walking through the back door mistakenly and thinking, this is the weirdest looking restaurant ever. So one of the bar waitresses set us straight and we noted our reservations to the hostess.\n\nThe place is sleek and slick. I felt like I was in a Manhattan club. Black on black, chrome/matte silver highlights, and the place is darker than most traditional steakhouses. The furniture is very modern and the high table we sat at had these crazy low back hydraulic seats. They're menus are still just black type printouts on white paper, one for drinks and one for the food. After looking at the cocktails, I've just found another scotch drink for my arsenal. Now I've been drinking Rob Roy's quite some time now and most bartenders don't know it or think it's an old man drink. Ok maybe it is an old man drink. I still love it nonetheless. Anyways, the scotch cocktail here is combined with a ginger syrup accompanied with a candied ginger garnish. Fantastic. I could have gotten wasted on these all night and as a bar/lounge alone , this would be a great place for just drinks. However the food was what we were here for. \n\nAfter constructing our meals in our minds, we went with the following:\n\n- Beef tartar \n- Kobe Burger with Avocado, Swiss+Bleu Cheeses, on Brioche\n- Cold Stone Farms Beef Burger, Bacon, Truffle Cheese on Brioche\n- Parmesan Truffle Skinny Fries\n- Sea Salt and Herbs Fries\n- Creme Brulee\n- Ice Cream Sandwich\n\nThe beef tartar was served with a quail egg, cornichon, parsley, onion, worcester, dijon sauce accompanied by mini toasts. Fantastic flavor. We could have eaten a few orders of this for our meal. Our burgers and fries came out shortly after and everything was very flavorful. My only disappointment came in the fact that my truffle cheese was missing and they went over on my burger's temp. Cheese was an easy fix but the overcooking made me sad. Especially for a place that is touting itself as a burger bar. Luckily it was still tasty, albeit lean, and I think the experience would have been excellent if not for this hiccup.\n\nThe servers were very French as were many of the touches to the food.  Even the coffee was served in a French hand press. The place wasn't too crowded at first but started to pick up around 9pm. We were definitely taken care of and were happy with our meals.

However, it was a cute, semi-romantic place just to chill and quick access to the bar on both sides of the room.\n\nThe place filled up quickly around 12am--crowd was mainly Asian with a few exception of 3-4 white girls.  Music was on repeat but they played some good songs along with some old school of Michael Jackson.  So, if you're not feeling the music.. just down some alcohol then it's all good!!  P.S.  There's one cute bartender here, so get at him and maybe he'll hook it up with a shot!  =)", "author": "MaryGrace V."}

I can tell this place could be nice as a restaurant, however there's an awkwardness in the way things are pushed to one side to accommodate dancing.

If anyone has ever known anyone that has been a promoter or a person that throws parties... It's not about the venue it's about the person that throws the party.. So for all of those people that say that this place is only an 18+ party.. Try coming to this place on a different night... Or for those individuals that said that there were only a few people in the venue... Try a different night when there is a better promoter... Perhaps your experience will be a bit better. Never judge a place just based on one experience... ESPECIALLY if it's a club!\n\nI, however, love this place... So much better than it was before. If anyone has ever been to this place when it was called Sake Lab you will truely appreciate how this place has transformed... The food here is awesome... Love Love Love the fries... I came here with some co workers on a Friday night... The event was a fashion show (sorry forgot who was promoting the party) but there were free apetizers all over the bar...

But, the staff is a little too inexperienced, the decor a little too black, and the food less than tantalizing for Horizon to creep beyond 3 stars. Nevertheless, the hostess was a sweetheart, and along with the rest of the friendly staff + a to die for Kobe beef burger, Horizon turned out to be A-OK. \n\nThe menu is well composed and worthy a fourth star, but the execution does not live up to the expectations. The lettuce on my starter salad was on the yellow side, and my puny mussels not fresh either. Perhaps the cream sauce tried to camouflage this, but the lack of basic seasoning blew its cover. \n \nFrom the fixed price menu, Eric picked out ribs for starters, which looked great! The meat slid off the bones, and he loved the taste too. The Kobe beef burger was a winner, but I admit, based on the reviews I'd read by fellow yelpers, I overestimated the truffle fries...bummer! Oh well, it only means I still have something to look forward to.\n\nFor dessert Eric picked the cheese cake option off the fixed menu choices (among flour less chocolate torte and ice cream). I couldn't tell whether it was homemade or store bought, but the chilled berry sauce helped. \n\nThumbs up on the good french press coffee, and in general the drink selection is good. The staff didn't know how to fix a Kir Royal, but the drinks from their own menu were good and didn't skimp on the alcohol.  \n\nWhat I learned from this? Horizon is the burger place to go to in the neighborhood with a decent bar.\n\nNote: Be careful parking curbside Horizon since all cars up the block on both sides of the street get towed after 8pm. Someone near our table learned that lesson the hard way, and the hostess told us it unfortunately is a daily show...", "author": "Kirsten L."}

My friends from out of town were coming into town this weekend and I figured this was a cool place to take them to. I would say I was not impressed and wouldn't go back.\n\nWhen we sat down, me and my friends noticed that the lobster and the Foie Gras were not on the Menu and we were wondering why. They said it was because they didn't have it. Not that we would put lobster on the burger. But we wanted to see how a burger would taste if we put Foie Gras on there. As I look closer at the restaurant menu, it was very different from the one shown on web.\n\nFOOD -\n\n1) Beef Tartar - my friend said that it was over seasoned and couldn't taste the beef. Often times, restaurants over seasoned the beef because it is not fresh. But we are not sure.\n\n2) Burgers - I had my Angus burger and it taste like charcoal (bitter and not seasoned). So, that's that. My friend thinks the Tofu burgers tasted pretty well seasoned. \n\n3) Fries- The Parmesan and Truffle oil fries was really good. I was in love in them.  The Fleur De Sel and Herbs fries was ok.\n\n\nSERVICE- \n\nThe waiter who took our order was pretty nice with a French accent. \nHowever, the food took a really long time to serve. We were famish when the food arrived. When the food the being served, the waiter with a Mexican accent didn't know which dish was which and mentioned all the dishes incorrectly. On top of that, we were confused because we don't really understood what he was saying.

At first, it was a just a great place to go to on the weekends to have some drinks and dance off the weekday stress.  Then along came the charity event they hosted along w.promotion crews for the victims of the earthquake in China.  I began to see Horizon in a whole new light.  All this was BEFORE I discovered their food.  Are you kidding me with those amazing truffle-parmesan fries?  They are the most crazy-good frites I've EVER had and second in line to them are their sweet potato fries.  They are crisp on the outside, naturally sweet and soft on the inside, the perfect texture and sweet to savory ratio.  Since you're going to order their famous sliders, make sure you ask your server to add a fried egg.  Christine C. gave us that great advice and boy, just when I thought the sliders couldn't get any better, the egg added a whole 'nother level of yumminess!  The fried chicken is also a must-have, the skin is crisp and dry to the touch.  I don't normally eat chicken skin, but I make an exception for Horizon's fried chicken!  When your teeth bite into the chicken, you will experience a near-nirvanic moment, that juicy gush of flavor and tender breast/thigh/whatever-piece- it-is with that crispy skin is to die for!  The taste is phenomenal and quite different from any other fried chicken I've ever had, I want to say there may even be a hint of wasabi(??) in the batter.  If you're more of a fish eater, I would suggest the salmon, it's always cooked and seasoned perfectly and the ribs are great and fall-off-the-bone tender for any carnivore out there!   If you're looking for a place to have a tasty and satisfying dinner and staying for drinks and dancing, Horizon is the place to go.  If you're looking for just a place to have dinner and then hopping up and down Broadway, Horizon is where it's at.  If you're looking for a place to party w.your friends, Horizon is also the go-to!

But it was good. \n\nFor the entrees, we got 3 burgers and shared'em. We tried  the Lamb, Kobe, and Sirloin. They were all med. rare and Doubles. Yeah that's right!! We don't \"F\"around when it comes to burgers Dogg!! Let me start witht the Kobe burger. It's aight!! We ordered it med. rare and it came out still a little overcooked. The taste was good but I don't think there is much of a difference if you go to a good burger joint. It's kobe beef!! I thought it would Knock me out my chair but..... anyways..... maybe Kobe beef isn't meant to be grounded up...... maybe i needed a bit more rare..... I'll give it another shot though.   For the sirloin, I thought it was a little dry but still a pretty good burger and you can taste the quality of the meat. I was still a thumbs up. And last but not least the Lamb burger. LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR THE MOTHER F***ING LAMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOW!!!! OMFG!!!!! This was by far the best burger I ever had in my life!!! It was juicy and spiced just right with a hint on mint  on a fresh ciabatta bread. This burger made me believe that there is a food God out there and he was blessin me that day!! Halalujah!!!!!!!!!!!

I were even given a ticket for my first drink at the bar- I ordered a Amaretto Sour but they didn't have DISARONNO. *sigh* Since I have never been here this review is solely based on my experience on the food and service as a guest. \n\nWe were served finger food and they were yummy. The mini burgers whether it was beef or vegetarian were tasty and juicy. I don't normally eat veggie burger but this one is yummy. The chicken breast on skewer has a taste of terriyaki sauce and ginger, the BBQ chicken wings were meaty, the deep fried prawn on skewer was very crispy; I think it was salt and pepper.. yumyum, the BBQ ribs is on the fatty side so it's greasy but nonetheless very meaty too. The dessert, I have to tell you, go for that chocolate truffles -- it's dark chocolate ie. pure decadence pure delight! The cheesecake was yummy too. And they have some different kind of french fries. One of them I tasted Parmesan cheese but my friend told me it tasted like plastic... lol.... we later found out it's truffle oil with Parmesan cheese. The same person wouldn't try the veggie burger saying they usually taste like cardboard. Given the fact that she has neither eaten cardboard nor plastic I took that as personal preference that has nothing to do with the cooking. \n\nThe staff in Horizon has done a very good job in keeping the food coming! They know how to deal with a hungry crowd. \n\nI would certainly come back for some more food if I am nearby the neighbourhood.", "author": "Bella A."}

I have been here a handful of times, mostly just for a dinner/drinks before going out with pals. The menu has actually got some tasty items on it. My personal favorite are the fries, but I am sort of a french fry addict. I love french fries. So when I saw they had a variety to choose from I knew I would want to come back a few times to try them all. I really like sweet potato fries, they are  becoming quite the ultimate weakness for me in my pre-wedding diet. Also their parmesan truffle fries are the bomb. I could order a cup of them from here alone for dinner they are so good. Their veggie risotto is surprisingly nice. Their burgers are just ok, I would do the sliders instead of the full on burger. It's a huge space so I can see why they had to utilize it as a wanna be night club. But ugh, Broadway just draws such trash. I hate saying it because I adore northbeach and like going out there. I can normally appreciate a night of bright lights, lots of distractions, loud music, dance club type scenes, but the people are just yucky over here so it's unfortunate.\nMy last visit was for a fashion show event. A bunch of friends and I came in before the event for dinner. Our waiter was a doll, but slow as molasses. He seemed to have almost the full dining room to himself so we could tell it wasn't a fault of his so we didn't take it out on him. He was so apologetic and kept bringing us rounds of free shots (random, but ok, we accepted). Any who, it was ok dinner took a long time because the fashion show didn't end up starting until really late. Ugh, what an awful fashion show filled with some attractive guys that i felt bad for getting suckered into being part of this event and some beat up looking girls that were clearly not models but were up there anyway. So, back to the crowd. Some drunk guy kept getting up on the stage holding a full bottle of jack daniels putting his arms in the air like he was 'the man' or on a rap video or something. Give it a break, get off the runway, you are not part of the show lameo. Just a crowd trying to be extra wild, disrespectful and dirty. gross. That event has totally turned me off of ever actually coming her past 10pm. I will probably still need to get a fix of their fries every few months, but I will stick to their happy hour scene as opposed to the night time bar scene.", "author": "Audrey V."}

I came here a while back for a friend's birthday and they had a guest list just for her event so we wouldn't be charged cover.  So, I get here with 2 friends at 10pm and there's no one at the door with any type of guest list so we just walk in.  Reason for no bouncer?  There was about 40 to 50 people inside only but they hyped it up like it was going to be packed.  Around 11 or 11:30 more people started coming in and then the place started to fill up.  We had a really big section to ourselves as there was 25+ people in our group with more showing up as the night went on.  The place is okay but nothing to write home about.  The dance floor can get packed but it's manageable and the DJ spun some good music that night.

The club told our organizers \"as long as we show up before 11pm, we get in free.\" The majority of us showed up at about 10:50pm, went to the bouncer at the front told him who we were and that we were on the guestlist. He told us to go to the back of the line where we waited for 20 minutes (for nothing really, just to make the place look more hoppin), and when we got to the front they charged us $10 each to get in...pretty shady move. \n  We decided whatever, won't let it ruin the night. We got in and ordered drinks and were charged $9 for the weakest drink I've ever had. Supposed to be Vodka-Cranberry, was 99.9% Cranberry juice. Even my just-turned 21-year-old sister who can taste alcohol in Mike's thought it tasted like juice. Stick to the beer if you order anything.\n   The music selection...terrible, wasn't even top 40 type of music, maybe a few top songs sprinkled in among the vast majority of rap..that most people hadn't heard of, and half the people didn't end up dancing to (no joke). Add this to the fact that they couldn't work the equipment properly and it was making ear-splitting screeching noises and I can safely say I will never go back, even if there was no cover. Oh and we only paid $10 because we were on the guestlist, if someone wasn't on the guestlist they had to pay $35 for this \"insert expletive here.\"\n   The only somewhat decent thing about this place was the bouncer who took away the prop that went with my costume at the beginning of the night went inside to retrieve it for me at the end of the night.", "author": "Mo S."}

I have returned a few times with my employees and friends to see what all these poor reviews are about. As owner of a successful restaurant, I took notice to several things most customers probably overlooked. What I see isn't poor service, I actually feel bad for those girls. What I do see is upper management struggles, way too much micromanaging, a small kitchen, and not enough employees at times. Weekends seem to be overbooked and under staffed. Multiple large parties are great for business when you have all the tools to accommodate them, and trust me its not easy. I was in the same boat about 15yrs ago. Which is why the Horizon hit so close to home my first time there. I see a kitchen that just can not produce the demand, and the struggle of servers trying their best to hold it all together from the front of the house to the back. You guys have potential to be successful but some advice for you is, set yourself up to succeed. Break up your reservations, set up big parties in your lounge, create a \"Party Menu\".  I don't know who is in charge of ordering and stocking food but someone needs to be! Every time I have been there my server informs me you are out of something. Okay once in a while at the END of the night but at 6-7PM! Come on guys, what would you think if you were the customer! I wish Horizon the best of luck, stick together , you guys can do it.

The cucumber martini was delicious albeit too \"fruity\", er cucumber-y to taste any sort of alcohol. It was pretty refreshing too. I wanted another but instead opted for their bellini which was pretty standard tasting as far as bellinis go. I have no idea what sort of sparkling wine or champagne they used.

Cover was $20 which is experience for such a crappy place. We did not know it was an 18 and over club. And if you read the list below, you'll see why it was not worth the effort and money to come here.\n\nPros: None other than maybe you should come during the day to eat dinner with a date or something.\n\nCons:\n1) on broadway , SF where there is absolutely no parking. Right across the street from Impala which is 100x better.\n2) the dance floor is pretty bright. There's a lot of spot lights, but not much disco lights. The atmosphere felt like a restuarant/bar more than a place to go dance. The place is also very small.\n3) The alcoholic bar is on the other side of the dance floor. You have to walk across just to get a few drinks, which I find a waste of time. Also there shots are actually less than 30mL ( the size of a full medicine cup when you take cough syrup), but they still charge you $10 for a pardon silver. I don't think 1/2 a shot for $10 was worth it. There's 2 people working at the bar, and 5 people at the counter waiting to be served and still, it takes about 10 minutes before you get served. \n4) music is hip-hop, but it's a bit slower than what you can really move comfortably to.\n5) Bar closes and the DJ starts playing slow jam at 1:30am. They turn off the music, turn up the lights and kick people out at 1:45am. Most clubs would assume you'll leave naturally when the music stops playing, but this one really do have people pushing you like you're a herd of cows to get you out before 2am.\n6) customers here are really inconsiderate. Though the place wasn't that big, there was definitely room to move around. Guys would bump into you constantly knowing that they are in your way.  Out of all the clubs I have been to, no matter how crowded it is, my friends and I were never bumped and pushed around like last night.

It was good but not SOOO good ... \n\nWe also ordered a side of spinach ($5) which was extremely garlicy, the spinach was drenched in garlic ... and believe me, I love garlic but not to the point of having liquidy garlic ... \n\nlucky me didn't have anyone to smooch that night, or else it'd have been bad, VERY BAD -- I'm sure all of our pores were stinking through so it worked out... \n\nthe mac and cheese ($6) wasn't a hit but it was ok. Pretty bland, and of course I had to get me my Tabasco ... which def made a huge difference in my taste bud.\n\nblah bla bla bla...\n\noh, and of course we can't forget their restrooms ... rather clean, but i actually fell in love with their art work ... they had a picture of audrey hepburn in a blk and white canvas, which is what i would LOVE to have at my next place ... in fact, the blk and white theme went quite well...\n\nSo yea, since Horizon is also known to be a lounge, we decided to lounge around on the other side but left rather quickly since the crowd was rather dead ... \n\nOh, now the KILLER ... I swiped the tab on my card, and I shit you not, I literally had to wait at the register for a good 10-15 minutes because they ended up swiping my card multiple times because the register was acting up ... i just hope, i hope* that they didn't ring me up 10x or else i'm not going to be happy -- it's one thing if my cc company is easy to work with, but to deal with this hassle of complaining that i was rang up 10x = $1700 -- i don't even want to think about it ... later, the manager came up to me, apologized and offered to get me a drink and gave me 2 complimentary dessert coupons for the inconvenience.

I must say that the mussel and clam dishes were my favorite appetizers while the salmon with mashed potatoes was my favorite entree.  The mussels and clams were seasoned perfectly and was served in a savory broth while the salmon was perfect--purposely undercooked so that it was still moist and succulent while the mashed potatoes were super creamy and perfectly seasoned.  I also had a chance to try one of the best burgers I've ever had before on a Monday night and it was only the bar burgers, Sliders.  Makes me wonder how their entree sized burgers taste which I will definitely try next time.  Served alongside are perfectly crisp and seasoned fries whimsically named crack fries!  They really live up to their nickname because they're so darn addictive!  They also have some of the best cocktails.  I had THREE within an hour because they were so fruity and delicious but don't be fooled--they all got a kick to them.  The cucumber press, strawberry kiss, and watermelon martini are must haves for ladies--and/or guys--to unwind after a long day of work.  They're a brand new restaurant and still have a few kinks to work out but other than that, they still have a very charming staff, DELICIOUS food, great bar, and I forgot to mention how fantastic they did with their remodeling job.

The interior atmosphere is lovely and the wait-staff is wonderfully polite and friendly. But everything falls apart after that. I recently ate dinner there with a group of about fourteen people. It took the staff about thirty minutes to actually come to our table to take our order. After finding the restaurant was disappointingly bereft of a few items on their menu, we ordered our drinks, appetizers, and entrees. They brought entrees to about three people. Then a pattern swiftly arose: every fifteen minutes another three to five individual items would arrive at our table. Many had finished eating entirely before everyone had received their plates. Moreover, most of the appetizers arrived after the meal entirely. The appetizers were also the only food of any quality. A few of us ordered the \"seafood pasta\" which boasted a rich variety of seafood: including shrimp, calamari, scallops on risotto with spinach and tomatoes in a lemon creme sauce. The reality proved to be flavorless shrimp and calamari afloat in a lukewarm sea of  lemon-water, with modest bits of spinach, bowtie pasta and macaroni elbows trying not to drown. I ended up eating mostly appetizers. When we asked about the missing ingredients we found that the restaraunt was simply \"out\" of them, along with nearly half of everything else on the menu including the glass of wine I ordered, which, I had to ask about halfway through the meal. The establishment, again to their credit, apologetically gave us a 10% discount on our $400+ bill.

The ugly...when asked the reason for the delays  the server said the order tickets did not print out due to a malfunction of the registers (earlier he told us the food was being plated, \"Dr. Jones you a LIAR\"!)  Not entirely his fault, they were very short handed and the hostess even brought out our food and took drink orders.  The consolation...drinks were on the house which made us feel 'okay' but not satisfied.  My wife said she'd return for the risotto and I agreed if it was on a Monday or Tuesday no later than 6:00pm.  There are too many restaurants in SF with excellent service and better food, don't waste your time or $$.  One star for drinks on the house.", "author": "Glenn M."}

The service was worse than unacceptable, I ordered a gin and tonic with Hendricks gin and I got coke and gin, with Bombay gin? Then they were out of food, no fish, no steak, just lamb or pasta. We were told this of course after we had made our menu decisions, doesn't the chef normally communicate to wait staff what he has and doesn't have? We had reserved a table for 6 and only had 4 in our party, I wonder what we would have done if everyone showed up. I ordered a starter as my main since they were out of mostly everything on the menu, my food showed up 20 minutes after everyone else's mains had arrived. All in all it was an awful experience, I eat out often in SF and have never had something as awful as this. Everything was just off.", "author": "isabella m."}

The night went from strange, to bad...to worse. \n\nStarting things off...it was a tasting menu (Which I LOVE) and so,  we proceeded to order all courses at once...because they even gave options(which I also LOVE)! So, we order our food and our drinks...we were on our second course before a drink came. Now, our server, having forgot our drink attempted to make up for things by continuing to bring drink after drink...there were no less than 2 drinks per person on the table at all times, kind of strange, but welcomed.  So, we have our drinks...we waited quite awhile for our final course, after being rushed through the previous...though, just as we're finishing our meals and sipping our drinks....WE GET KICKED OUT OF OUR TABLE. Yes, that's right KICKED OFF OF OUR TABLE. The hostess approaches us and asked us to get up. We hadn't even had our dessert yet, we still had full drinks on our tables...we both just starred in amazement. She informed us, that dinner was no longer being served because the restaurant was changing into a club and the space that our table was currently occupying was to be the dance floor. So, we were kicked out of our seat...and then presented a bill while being told to \"wait at the bar to finish our drinks\". \n\nSo, we did not get our dessert (which, btw is my favorite part, and I normally eat first), we got KICKED out of our table...because of THEIR timing...we had a reservation, don't take the reservation if you don't have time to feed us... it was all so strange, and we still shake our heads about it. \n\nNow, the reason for the stars-- the food we actually got to eat was pretty great, and no complaints there...I just wish I wasn't rushed through my meal, denied, and kicked out.", "author": "Lacy R."}

Their pear salad, kobe burger, risotti, and fries are great.  Their baby back rib appetizer was awesome.  (Hear that their chef used to work for 4 star french restaurant.)  Good experience.  They actually had lingerie models later on that night.  Enjoyed it. Had a great time.", "author": "Linda W."}

The riffraf inside this club assulted my buddy and I took a hit for him while trying to break it up.  Bouncers did not get my back and kicked us out.  I did not drive 50 miles for a sore back and expensive drinks.  I HIGHLY recommend not going to this place.  There are plenty of other places in North Beach to check out.", "author": "mike f."}

This is strickly for the lounge side, first of all we went on a friday night and there was hardly anyone there, the party was lame, the crowd (what ever crowd that was there) sucked ass !!!but that wasn't the worst part, my sister ordered a shot of patron for $10! (which is pretty reasonable) but it was the  little plastic container that it came in, it was so tiny, that it held probally a half the size or less of what a regular shot glass.  Such a rip off, and a cover charge i don't think so!!!!!!", "author": "Nai S."}

Perfectly seasoned and so bubbly, creamy and melty... They use elbow macaroni too.  I hate when places front and use some other pasta like penne or fusili and try to pass it off as mac 'n cheese.  This is the real deal.  The service is great.  Very friendly staff and super-cute bartender (with dimples to boot!).", "author": "Michelle K."}

VERY tacky in my opinion.... this would generally be enough on principle to not go back, but my gf and i still have another promotional gift certificate to use....", "author": "craig t."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-03-31", "description": "I only went to this place for a friend's birthday. They were having some block party event where you get into either Horizon or Latitude and you could hop back and forth between the 2. The big group of us (about 10-15) went to wait in line at Horizon because it was shorter. The jerk of a boucer was a complete a-hole (the bald asian one). I understand that they had a dress code, but one of my friends was wearing dressy tennis shoes. The bouncer did not let him know that he was out of dress code. Instead, he stood on the street and yelled \"You can't wear tennis shoes. You know who you are.\" and just kept glaring at him. My friend was busy chatting with the others in our group and didn't notice. The bouncer finally came over and let him know he was out of dress code. Why couldn't he have done that the first time instead of broadcasting it to the whole street? We were trying to figure out the sitaution because one of our other friends had an extra pair of shoes nearby. The same bouncer came through the line and said my friend couldn't even stand in line and he had to stand on the street. He said he was asking nicely, although not once did he say please or act very nice. All he did was try to embarass people. I let him know politely that he actually wasn't being very nice about it, and he simply replied \"I don't care.\" I guess he was just on a power trip that night. Anyway, we were all about to ditch that place because of that jerk, but another friend knew someone and they actually let us in. And I might add that there were several people inside without a collared shirt or in tennis shoes. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it's actually a pretty nice place inside. The drinks weren't weak either. However, they did almost double charge my friend for her cover charge. A place that is trying to enforce a strict dress code shouldn't serve their drinks out of plastic cups.", "author": "T C."}
