I took my friend from Germany to San Francisco to the pier etc. we stopped in here and had the worst service. I had to take him elsewhere to reassure him there are nice people in the service biz in San Fran. This place gives off a bad vibe to tourists. Please do not waste your time in the city by going here. The bathrooms are also dirty and the hand blower did not work.  This is not the way you should experience the city that has so many great things to offer to have a experience to remember in positive way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-25", "description": "This is a divey touristy pub just off the tourist madness that is fishermans wharf.\n\nParking can be tricky, due to the super popular destinations close by (Fisherman's wharf, maritime park, powell and mason cablecar line, historical hyde pier, Ghirardelli square, pier 39 etc.). There are some pay lots and garages scattered around, but like a lot of things in this city you will be best served by getting here some way that does not involve driving.\n\nThis is a gigantic space. The entrance is make by a life size or slightly larger wooden carved bear, and the restrooms are close by the entrance, clean (usually. Late at night around closing they get more problematical.), they serve food, the bar service is quick (again usually. On a dense pack game night with one bartender out things can get sticky), and there is often live music which will make up for whatever inadequacy in skill and tone with volume. There is seating enough for just about any size group with no waiting, the main bar has room for twenty ish on almost comfortable stools, and on packed nights there will be a smaller auxiliary bar opening up towards the front in an effort to get you liquor quicker. The overall theme is of the dark cave like dive bar motif.\n\nThe crowd can be eclectic ish. A lot of touristy passer by, a smaller amount of blue collar folk drinking their pay, and even some local peeps. The tap wall is a reasonable mix os mass market brands (coors) macro brews (sam adams, sierra nevada) and local/regional beers (anchor steam for the win!). The wine selection isn't any too deep, yet offers some good verging on great choices. This is a full service bar with wide (in variety if not premium) selection of spirit's. Whatever your tasty adult beverage of choice is (applejack, beer, brandy, slivovitz, whisky in a jar, red red wine and so much more) they are likely t have some version of it. Pricing can be more then you'd expect/want however. Six dollars a pint is on the low end of things, and yes you can get into the twelve dollar a beer range. \n\nThe food will run twenty ish a plate on the low side-although the apps can be a bit less. The menu isn't too ambitious-eggs, burgers, steak, soups and salads. Standard American pub fare. They can do vegetarian versions of everything but the steak. It's really too easy to get into the forty-fifty ish dollar range for a meal and a drink which....well, I dunno if you like the place and have a great time that's all well and good but it can seem more money then value a lot of the time, especially as the food falls decisively into  the good but not great category.  Service is okay. It's quick if at times indifferent at the main bar, but in the dining area you may have uncomfortable periods of isolation if they are understaffed-and they almost always are.\n\nOverall it's not bad-it can be reasonably painless to get in/out of but the overly loud music, steep city pricing, and indifferent food make this a solid three stars.", "author": "Steven W."}

I had no idea Jack's was still open!  I came in here fairly often thirty years ago while living in the city, but somehow or other they've sort of fallen off my radar.  \n\n\nAnyway, pretty much as I remember:  a big, rather dark room, with two bars (there used to be a third upstairs), pool tables, and lots of brewery miscellanea--also a small display of Studebaker memorabilia, including models and a complete dashboard from a '57 Golden Hawk.  Not surprisingly given the location, the clientele appears to include a heavy mix of tourists.\n\nAbout 47 craft brews on draft, in the $6-$8 range; also miscellaneous industrial beers and bottles.  I had time for only one:\n\n- Devil's Canyon Deadicated (sic) Amber Ale.  5.4% ABV.  Clear red-brown, light head.  Taste is caramel malt, modestly bittered with Cascade.\n\n\nOne thing left a bad impression:  I gave the bartender a $20, and initially was only given change for a $10.  Of course she made it up when I pointed out the error.  Deliberate attempt at short-changing?  Oh, who can say?  I prefer to think the best of people.", "author": "Alan F."}

The meat seemed to be of solid quality, but it was just overcooked to my liking.  The bread did not add or subtract anything from my thoughts of the burger.  The fries were the thick kind.

I notice a lot of hating on Yelp, and I'll grant you that I haven't tried the food.  But, there are a lot of good qualities about this place.  I could go to 3-Stars as a local, but in the context of Fisherman's Wharf, I think it goes to 4.  \n\nThe Good:\n*68 Beers on Draft\n*Cool space.  There's a main bar, a side bar, separate area of tables, and they have an outdoor patio/bar.  \n*Live Music\n*Long Hours - Opens at 7am\n*Usually interesting tourists to chat up, many of them Euros.\n*$1 Oysters\n*Cool Location in The Cannery - Right next to Aquatic Park\n*Food - Both Breakfast and Lunch/Dinner\n*Solid Bartenders - Always good in my Book\n\nThe Bad:\n*Of the 68 Beers on Draft, there aren't a ton of stand-outs if you're a seasoned Local Beer Drinker.  If you're on Vacay, you'll get plenty of West Coast offerings.\n*Wharf Prices - $7 for a Lagunitas Lil' Sumpin.  (BTW - That I order this shows there isn't a ton off novelty to the menu.)\n*One of the two TV's at the Main Bar is clearly not in great shape, which makes me wonder about standards.\n*Bad Cell Reception.  Come on, some of us have Yelping to attend to.  \n*Cash Only\n\nIf you hate The Wharf, this place probably won't make you a convert.  However, this isn't a Pier 39 \"Why would you come to SF and do this?\" type experience.  I enjoy the atmosphere down here, particularly now that I don't work here every day.  It's fun to meet tourists, and it's pretty by The Bay.  My opinion may change if I tried the food.  \n\nIf you are a tourist, particularly if you're down here with your family and need a few minutes to \"re-group\", you'll probably enjoy a visit while you give the kids the plastic so they can go buy an \"I got Crabs in SF\" t-shirt.  (I saw a 6/7 year old wearing one - Stay classy, Mom and Dad.  Although, I always wonder if someone buys it and doesn't understand the deeper meaning.)

I was shocked when he put a bag over it, then grabbed a hammer and started to smash it in front of us!!!!  As everyone knows, fluorescent tubes contain highly hazardous mercury powder.  The mercury powder started billowing from the trash can and I watched him roll this can into the kitchen where they were prepping our food!!!!!!

What I do remember is the awesome giant old wood bar. They have a story posted about it on the wall, but with 70 beers on tap who's going to remember the details? Beers were about $6-$8. I'm used to that from frequenting NYC but could be considered a little pricey.

My sister in law and I are in SF for a few days and popped into this bar for a what should have been a few beers and ended up being one beer.  Jack's has a fantastic selection of craft brews and being from MI, craft beers are a standard for us.  It was 2:30ish and not busy.  We sat at the bar about in the middle, and the bartender (blonde, female, wearing a sweatshirt) asked for our order.  I jokingly said \"You have 68 craft brews, we need a minute\", she said ok, but we got zero other response, no smile or nod or additional comment.  After several minutes, she came back for our order and we got served.  Although we enjoyed our beers, our bartender made no effort to engage with us even though we made a few attempts at conversation.  We both felt very much like we were being ignored.  As we are drinking our beers, the blonde bartender was yucking it up with what must have been a local, laughing and talking.  This happened with another apparent local at the other end of the bar. I did not expect her to entertain us, but a smile, eye contact or a little conversation would have gone a long way.  Pretty sure that is what bartenders generally do.  We left the tab money, no tip.

The souvenir t-shirts says 84 beers and I counted about 60, so I'm going to say there's about 60-84 beers on tap.  They had a wide selection with local Nor Cal staples (Anchor, Lagunitas, Speakeasy, Bear Republic, Firestone, etal) as well as small batch brews from all over (Hangar 24, Alaskan, Ninkasi, Deschutes, etal).  They'll have a beer for everyone's taste.\n\nWhat really surprised me were the oysters.  Even at their low price point ($1 each), they were still fresh and went down smoothly.  I ordered 2 at first to try them out and I ended the afternoon downing a whole dozen.  The bar environment was casual, relaxing, and not too loud.  Service was solid and the bartenders managed a good pour.\n\nI'm really happy with the oysters and the beer selection here.  I didn't order food nor mixed drinks so I can't comment on that.

I drank here for about eight hours and didn't repeat a single brew. The bartender was very helpful in her suggestions and explanations of all the brews on tap.\nMy group and I came here early on a Sunday morning to catch our east coast football team. The employees of Jack's were good enough to put the Eagles game on and let us stay for hours to watch. Not to mention, they have a great breakfast menu. \nThis is a trivial detail, but whatever radio station they play here is kick ass...the music is so good! \nJack's really captures the essence of what I love most about the west coast-one's ability to catch a buzz and watch football early on a Sunday morning.", "author": "Mallory D."}

Yes, it is in a touristy area, but I happen to know it has regulars, too.  We were looking for a place to eat after leaving our hotel and saw a sign outside advertising a $5 breakfast.  An old man who we assumed was the owner (it turns out he's not) sat on a stool beside the sign.  We asked him if they were still serving breakfast.  His response: \"Hmm...let me think about it.\"  Pause.  \"Sure.\"  Okay then.\n\nHe led us in and we sat at a large table near a television.  It was not at all crowded, but that was just how we wanted it.  I think we all instantly liked the feel of the place; the decor, the energy.  I was impressed with the number of beers on tap.  \n\nThe waitress was young and friendly and attentive.  I tried to order a Coke but they only had off-brand sodas, which was fine with me.  I ordered a typical breakfast plate for about $5: bacon, eggs, toast, hash browns.  It was exactly what you'd want in a breakfast plate.  Very satisfying.  \n\nI would have given this place four stars if it weren't for one factor: we waited for our food for what seemed like forever.  It was pretty ridiculous, because there were hardly any other patrons at that time and everything we ordered was pretty simple.  Other than that, I liked the place and recommend it if you're close by.", "author": "Casey B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-07-14", "description": "07/13/2013 6:30 - 9:00PM\n\nWhen did customer service ever depend on ones mood? Well, I have to say that this night depended on that.\n\nMy 1-star rating is based on: 0.5 for attempt at providing quality customer service, and 0.5 for quality of the food (sadly, this score would truly be a 3 if our waiter was more accommodating - my friends said that though the food was not gourmet, it was good enough).\n\nI would have never chosen this spot for any outing, event, or gathering, but came since this was for my friends birthday.\n\nDecor is quite eclectic, with some British flair - certainly made me want some shepherds pie. Space is large, and is nestled within a touristy area.\n\nLets get to the actual review: I brought a cake in celebration of my friends birthday, and upon asking our waiter (man in his 40's, caucasian, bald, and wearing a yellow t-shirt stamped with a star in the center - didn't quite get his name) if we could serve our cake here - I was told that there would be a fee, and it wasn't said in a nice way, more of an attitude. I politely declined and said that we will eat this cake elsewhere. (As I continue with this review, he continues to instigate and contribute more attitude regarding serving my cake).   \n\nEverything on the menu is expensive! I can see why: TOURISTS! On their actual menu, at the very top right hand corner, it read - and as I quote from memory, \"We do not accept cards, cash only, there are two ATM's on site - $1.50 added to go, $6 minimum to order from the menu\". This is the new age, establishments should have the options of both cash and credit/debit. My friend ordered a cheeseburger ($7.75, which does not include cheese, $1.00 to add cheese, and neither did it come with fries - an extra charge for that). She also ordered 3 sodas and was charged $9 (really, for coke, yes really). And lets be honest, with all the fees that banks charge nowadays, I would prefer not to use one of those DINKY THIRD PARTY ATM's, and that's exactly what i did.\n\nOur waiter continues to make his rounds, making sure that we have everything we need - okay service, sure. My friends ask for the check, while they were paying, the table next to us (also our group, we had probably 13 people in total) - I hear one of the members say as the same waiter walks away \"oh what, you really think your service equates to a $10 tip\". I thought that was intriguing, up until the same waiter questions my booth (which I did not order, but my friend did) why such a small tip was left - then it made sense. Excuse me, tips are based on ones level of service - we can give as little or as much as we find valid. My friend felt so angered, that her husband removed the tip that the waiter leaves in favor for a penny - yes a penny. I would have left nothing!\n\nMy friends and I were talking about how our waiter expected a high tip for his \"exceptional service\", he walks himself to our booth and says \"with the little tip you left for me, that could have been for the cake service charge\". Excuse me, I had already said no and that we would eat it elsewhere, why pick a fight? He then continues with \"if you go to any other restaurant, they would certainly charge you for bringing in outside food\". Technically, I have never been told that such a fee is mandatory with the restaurants I've been to, in fact, we left Jacks Cannery for Apple Bee's for dinner and they gladly chilled our cake and even served it without charging anything extra. \n\nIt's 8:30PM and we get ready to leave, and again, another instigation. \"I hope you really enjoy that cake\" - in a very nasty tone. The waiter continues (again), \"restaurants will charge you for bringing in outside food, even if it's for someones birthday\". I told him that I don't need anyone repeating themselves. He added (again) \"well, I would have gladly served your cake had you paid the extra fee or use the tip that you and your friends left behind\". I was also called CHEAP and a six letter word that I will not spell out but will define (noun: child born out of wedlock). Terrible customer service!\n\nMy friends mother at this point walks in to Jacks Cannery as we are ready to leave, and she over hears the whole conversation. She is also given some feedback (from the entire group that this same waiter has provided us with terrible customer service). She approaches the manager on duty at the time, and her response was that \"oh, he is having a very bad day, I am so sorry that he treated you and your group that way\". From the kitchen, she said she could hear that same waiter yelling the FWORD repeatedly. She is then given the number to the owner of Jacks Cannery, \"Bill\", that should a complaint be filed, he is the best person to reach. \n\nI am appalled with the word that I was given and associated with. Let this be the first and last time that I ever step foot into Jacks Cannery. \n\nAnswer this, are you having a bad day? If you answered yes to that - bite your tongue and do your job.", "author": "Alex C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-03-23", "description": "I must preface this review with a note on my experience at Jacks.  It was horrible.  I went for my friend's birthday.  It was a long day and we ended up here because Capurro's across the street was booked for a private party on a Saturday night.\n\nFrom the outset, the place looks like a bar.  But, it does have tables in the back for dining.  It also had signs for specials out front.  Unfortunately for us, food is not the highlight of a Jacks Cannery Experience.\n\nWhen we sat down to order, the place was practically empty.  This might be due to the fact that there was a solo acoustic guitar guy playing and singing enthusiastically the same pattern, over and over.  Grateful Dead inspired, but that is as far as it went.  It was not musically pleasant and it was so loud.\n\nSurprisingly, the service was not particularly fast.  So, we got the menu.  It is limited.  My first order was unsuccessful.  They have a bunch of plastic banners outside advertising dinner specials.  When I tried to order one, the waitress kindly informed me that they haven't had those specials in a long time and that she had told the owner to take the signs down.  This is probably some violation of the law.  But, we were hungry.  So, I decided not to make a fuss about it.  \n\nWe ended up ordering the crab sandwich, which the waitress claimed was the best thing on the menu.  We couldn't verify that.  After waiting for half-an-hour, the waitress told us that they were all out and that the kitchen failed to tell her this fact when she was taking our order.  We had also ordered some appetizers, and a steak.  So, we decided to share that instead and eat something else later.  I felt sorry for the waitress.  It wasn't her fault.  The kitchen and service staff obviously have some communication problems.  And, the management obviously refuses to do anything about it.  Also, it is surprising that we arrived at like 7:30 on a Saturday and they were already out of the top seller on the menu.  It is like they did not plan to serve food at all that day.\n\nSo, you might think, top seller.  Maybe it sold out quick.  However, my friends tried to order other things from the menu like grilled chicken, which does not require any advance prep.  They were also out of chicken.  How do you run out of chicken at 7:30 on a Saturday.\n\nThe waitress informed us that they had just hired a new cook and that they were having some transition problems.  In fact, she pointed him out as the skinny, dirty looking guy at the bar, smoking and drinking with the other customers.  Meanwhile, we were still waiting for the food that we previously ordered.\n\nWe were very hungry.  They didn't even serve bread.  After a while, we had to ask because no food was coming.\n\nThis was not the waitresses fault.  The drinks we ordered came right away.  They have a large selection of imported and domestic draught and bottle beers and the prices were reasonable.  Some imported draughts were under 5.  Some were over 8.  So, there was a range.  I appreciated the variety.  And, overall, the beer was tasty.  So, concludes the highlight portion of our tour.\n\nWhen the food arrived, it was not very good.  The steak was tough.  It was overcooked.  My friend ordered a hanger steak that looked smaller than the palm of his hand.  We all laughed when we saw it.  My friends ordered the shrimp cocktail and they seemed to like that.  But, everything else was disappointing.  We all did our best not to have that be a focus of the meal.  But, it was kind of like driving through a cow pasture and trying your best not to react to the smell.  There was an uneasiness that permeated the meal.\n\nWe go the check.  The waitress graciously took a few items off the bill to compensate for what was a horrible dinning experience.  But, she was great.  The place is cash only.  But, there was an ATM inside.\n\nThis place has a lot of potential.  It has a great location.  The high ceilings are covered with beautiful moldings.  The wainscoting on the walls looks very classy.  The place is large.  It looks like a good place to have classy meals or to have a fun place to appeal to tourists.  This is unfortunately neither.  It feels like a dive bar.  The patrons seem to like getting drunk in peace.  It doesn't seem particularly busy.  The low lighting makes the place feel dirty somehow.  And, the music was just horrible.  You end up shouting because the syncopated chording makes you want to fill the air with anything, but his music.\n\nIf this was just a bar, without food and music, I might be tempted to give it 3 stars.  There were a lot of good beers on tap.  But, unfortunately, this place does a lot of things too poorly to ignore.  So, one star.", "author": "Andrew W."}

It deserves it.\n\nTook the family and the grandma to the aquatic park to watch the 7/4 fireworks.\nWalked pass this place and saw the outdoor dining area. It looks like a nice place to have casual dinner.\n\nSpoke to the waitress and was told that it's open seating, so just seat yourself.  She was frank about the 45 min wait for food.  Since we have some time, it is okay, picked a place and sat down.\nThen folks at the adjacent table picked up and left.  Left, as in nothing on the table, completely vacant, void of any person or personal belongings, out of sight.

Was I dazed and confused...or did I have a momentary surge of machismo insecurity...or did I just get hungry after looking at a queen?\n\nWell, it turns out a bit of all three since I just finished spending the afternoon with my friend waiting for the deluxe Queen Mary II ocean liner to arrive into the bay. We were smelling Davy Jones' locker...or at least his gym socks...on the crescent pier in Maritime Park. Instead of defaulting to our stand-by, In-n-Out, we both acknowledged a hankering for a bowl of clam chowder. And thus, Jack's happened to be on our route.\n\nWhen you walk in, it looks like a regulation sports bar with a smaller-than-average TV screen above the bar. But then you have to take an odd turn toward the right to find the extended beer bar and then make a sharp left to get to the dining area where it looked like lunch hour at the Shady Pines Retirement Home. Given a circuitous route only Marco Polo could figure out, I thought for sure we would be ignored. And I was right, but once we told the bartender upfront that we needed menus, the service improved.\n\nOur sweat-shirted waitress was friendly and sadly seemed to be the only one serving all the tables. But we all persevered. The food, as it turned out, was mediocre. We ordered some popcorn shrimp, which came on a small plate and had the texture of a botched microwave job - overly moist and not crispy. It wasn't helped by the ketchupy sauce that seemed like only a distant relative to cocktail sauce. But who am I kidding?...we ate it all up.\n\nOur bowls of chowder were good-sized and full of fresh clams, but the broth was quite watery, a bit of a letdown given that they flaunt how the Chronicle deemed theirs as the best chowder in the city. It did come with a big hunk of crusty sourdough bread, always a treat.

The live music was really cool!...But, the bartender made me feel uncomfortable after I asked to charge my phone. They charge $7 for a pint of beer, and she implied people charging phones was expensive for the business...Wow! I work in the same building and was looking for a local place to have a drink before heading home. After my first beer was done, I sat for 10 minutes before I was checked up on. I had to flag the bartender down to ask for a food menu. She seemed annoyed. I decided to take my businesses elsewhere. Go to red jack saloon. $5 pints everyday and friendly, down to earth employees. I rarely write reviews, but I felt compelled to steer people clear of this kind of nonsense. I seriously contemplated walking back to retrieve the dollar tip I left. Not sure I've ever done that....

Well when I walk in, it is busier than when I was last there, but luckily there were a few stools open at the bar.  It's always nice to sit at the bar, maybe watch some sports or just sit and talk with friends and the bartender. Like last time Dara was the man who served us the beer. We actually got a lesson in what a snake bite vs black velvet. When my friend ordered a snake bite which they thought was a Guiness and pear cider, Dara told us that it was called a Black Velvet. A snake bite is lager and pear cider. Well either way since I never tried it, I was down. It was pretty good, but a little sweet for me near the end.  Too much sugar equals possible hangover when consuming mass amounts of alcohol. haha\n\nLater since it was my choice I made my friend take a shot of Jameson whiskey and a pint of Guiness in one hit. Oh how I love the combo.  Drank a few other beers including Pabst beer since I have seen it in the last 2 movies I've watched. Pabst is a fairly light and smooth beer.  I'll be back down to Jacks soon for anyone who wants to go. If I lived in the city I'd hit their happy hour.

Um no, it kinda didn't end up that way.\n\nWe sit at the bar.  And my hubby is impressed with all the beers they have on tap.  The bartender didn't even card me. :(  \"You mean I've been using a fake id for nothing!\"  \n\nSo the day progresses and the bartender found every imaginable mixed drink with Jagger in it.  \n\"MMM... I like the red bull with it,  oooh, the Jagger and coke is good...\"\n\nBy this time my hubby and I had made friends with the entire bar.  Including the 2 college boys that played, \"Here Comes my Girl\" by Tom Petty.  Awww so sweet.  And this ugly, man faced woman that sat at the bar alone.  Now I'm all for chicks hitting the bar by their lonesome.  That's exactly why I started talking to her.  La La La we're talking, and I'm getting more drunk by the sip.  \n\nHere it is 8:00 p.m. FIVE *AFTERNOON* HOURS LATER!!!  \nI'm walking around bare foot!  I called my mom and dad outside sitting hunched over on the curb to let them know that their baby girl was having a good time. I go to the bathroom several times not to go pee pee, but to throw up.   Then the ugly, lonesome manly girl comes in to see if I'm \"okay.\"  I tell her yeah, \"cus even belligerent I don't need any chick to *hold my hair*. \"  I come back out to the bar ready to have another shot, and my hubby looks at me and says we have to go.

I believe it's close to 80+ different types if beer on hand which was served by some friendly bartenders.

The fish in the fish & chip was actually quite delicious but there was only 3 or 4 small pieces and the fries were a little soggy, nothing to write home about.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-31", "description": "We ate breakfast here 2/3 mornings we were in San Francisco.  Breakfast was great diner-esque style food (bacon, eggs, hashbrowns, and sour dough toast).  I ate almost everything and I'm not a big fan of breakfast, in general.    The best part of breakfast?  The 80 beers on tap!  There is nothing like beer and breakfast on vacation...\n\nI'd love to give this place 5 stars, but the service did leave something to be desired.  The young woman (blonde) who was working our first morning there (just beers, as we'd had breakfast elsewhere) was the best of the staff we encountered.  She was polite and helpful and even poured me a taste of a beer (which is apparently a no-no there and is one of my pet peeves!).  She knew the most about beer of any of the staff we encountered, which is a bit of a let down for me (the others, not her) because I want to get some local insight on local beers when traveling.  \n\nThe older man we encountered the next morning was obviously not feeling well (and was actually replaced shortly after we ordered so he could go home), though he was nice, and I can't even remember the gender of his replacement, so (s)he obviously wasn't memorable.  The third morning we were even a bit later than usual (7:30) and we were told there was no one there working yet (despite the \"OPEN\" on the door along w/the posted 6AM open time and 7AM breakfast time).  As we were heading out, they told us to stay and just wait a few moments.  The young man who came in was very nice, but harried as it seems the prep work wasn't done and he was behind from the start.  He did not seem to be very beer knowledgeable.  \n\nSo, in reading that, I guess my issue is really w/management.  If you don't want to be open at 6, don't open at 6.  However, if you choose those hours, I'd like to actually feel welcome when I walk into your establishment (especially the THIRD morning in a row).  My other issue is, while they have a fantastic beer selection (I'd put it up close w/any other we encountered in San Francisco), they're not really a \"beer\" bar.  The beers aren't prominently posted anywhere, save table \"tents\" on the bar, some of which were inaccurate, and none of which provided ANY description of the beers.   I also have issue w/not allowing tastes.  I've never been to a \"beer\" bar that didn't allow tasting.  I'm even perfectly happy w/limiting tastes or offering a sampler flight for a fee, but neither of those options were offered.  \n\nI love the decor; the old dark wood and ornate ceilings are truly gorgeous.  I also enjoyed all of the tap markers lining the top of the bar.  \n\nBeer selection was impressive w/lots of local breweries represented (Anchor heavily so).  I was pleased to encounter a few IPAs I'd never seen/drank before and thoroughly enjoyed the Ninkasi (sp?) Tricerahops (Double IPA)....I may even go as far as to call it my favorite beer of the trip!\n\nI would imagine it probably gets crazy busy here in the afternoons/evenings, but if you like good beer and old school diner style breakfasts for a reasonable price, this is the place to go for breakfast on the Wharf.", "author": "Summer K."}

Allowed a SF resident a brief respite from tourists along the main drag of Fisherman's Wharf.  Service was good, cash-only policy was clearly marked (plus I know of at least two or three major bank ATMs in the area so if you want to walk a block or two, you can avoid the $2 convenience fee) and we had a decent time.  \n\nThree stars only, though, A) because we had to ask for water, and a refill, when it was obvious we were having lunch,  and not just drinking beers, B) menu could be expanded a bit, and C) clam chowder was bland and milky.

Our story:\nWe're a bunch of eight 40-ish guys celebrating a friend's birthday. After a long day chasing each other through the city on a spy adventure, the birthday boy wants to treat his pals to a beer and maybe grab a bite of early dinner.\nGroup inertia leads us to Jack's outdoor area (\"Where do you want to go?\" \"I dunno, where do you want to go?\") Big mistake.\n\n1. Some of our party start to shift a small patio table over so we can all sit together. A server shouts \"No! No!\" at us like he's disciplining a dog. We should've left right then. *sigh*\n2. We sit and jaw for a while at our separate tables. I notice how much time has passed with no sight of a server. I don't usually notice this sort of thing. This was our best chance to escape.\n3. I'm reading the menu posted on a column next to me and I see that Jack's is a cash-only place. I announce this to our group as our server finally shows up. The birthday boy does some quick counting in his wallet as the server suggests that they have two convenient ATMs on-site at $3 per transaction. How thoughtful.\n4. We float the idea of ordering a pitcher and the server lady counters that by the glass is a better deal. Huh?\n5. We place our drink orders and wait and talk... and wait... I wonder if they are brewing our beer to order. I notice that the young couple with a stroller who sat after us is looking a bit impatient and checking their watches. The promise of beer keeps us seated.\n6. Finally! Beer! Our server arrives with a tray of little 12-oz sampler-sized solo cups. Seriously? I down mine in two pulls. Later, one of our group mentions that he's \"never been served beer in a urine sample cup before.\" Funny, but he's not too far off.\n7. A friend ordered iced tea and, considering how things have been going, has to ask if he's got refills on his tea. The server scrunches her face and replies reluctantly \"I'm supposed to say 'yes', but don't go wild.\" Oh. Yes. Please don't go all chugfest on the free refills of iced tea.\n8. The young couple has had enough and they leave.\n\nWe finished our beers/iced tea, paid our $48 (cash), and walked away to find a place that could make us feel good about spending our money instead of making us feel like we were being anally probed.", "author": "Phil D."}

Usual bartenders notice when glasses are empty and pushed forward. We got another round and decided that we'd come back for dinner that night, so we left. We came back that night and there were about 3 tables of people eating dinner. No one was 'hostessing' the front, so we sat ourselves. We waited approx. 15 minutes, the waitress walked past us several times to attend to other tables, she didn't even glance our way. Another waitress pointed us out to her, but still nothing. She continued to chat and socialize with the bartender and other waitresses at the bar. She occasionally would tend to the other diners, but not once did she stop at our table, offer us a menu, wipe our table. Nothing. Finally, after waiting for so long, we got up to leave. My husband stopped her and asked 'What does someone have to do to get service around here??\" She looked completely dumbfounded.

But Jacks totally missed the boat for ambiance.  I can only review the food and service in the outdoor area.  We were here for a late lunch.  After waiting 5 minutes for a server or anyone to show up, we finally searched for our own menus.  Another 10 minutes a server came outside and I and several other tables tried to get his attention.  No luck.  After another attempt, we were able to order our salads with shrimp, and a couple of beers.  The salad arrived (no bread, no knives) with the lettuce on the bottom, two long stalks of celery, a quartered tomato, a huge thick slice of unpeeled brownish cucumber, and a thick slice of red onion.  On top was a large portion of tasteless shrimp.  All this was piled onto a small plastic plate.    There was no way to get to the greens underneath the mound of shrimp without everything falling off the plate onto the dirty metal table.  With the salad came a tiny paper cup of cocktail sauce and an equally tiny cup of ranch dressing.  Each bite had to be dipped into the sauce, because there was no way to dress the greens and vegetables underneath the pile of shrimp.  The worst part was that I felt the food was old and probably full of invisible yuck.  I couldn't finish it.  After about 20 minutes, two more servers showed up.  They made the rounds asking each table if they were being served.  One of them was dressed in short shorts and black leggings with holes in them.  She was overweight and unkempt;  looking at her was unpleasant.  Good beer served in plastic cups.

Any bar that can escape the noise and scene of Fisherman's Wharf is ok by me.  I took some friends from out of town down to the area and we stumbled across this bar.  Great amount of beers on tap, more than ample room to relax with a drink.  I will definitely be back.", "author": "Matt B."}

The place is a fave amongst locals and tourists alike. The bar proudfully boasts it's wide range of draft beers numbering to approx 80 I believe, maybe more but the number could fluctuate. They set the standard of bars here in SF to encumber the most widest range of tap beers in most of the bay area as well. Also keep in kind that they have a full service kitchen with extremely exceptional burgers,fish n chips, and specials that can hit the spot for ya when need be in the hunger department folks. The bartender extraordinaire Tuula, is your answer for awesome mixed drinks with a few you've probably never tried, humor, and unrelentless debauchery when it comes to a down to a good night of swilling. The vibe is very sports bar, and the decor on the ceilings is quite old bcuz the Cannnery has been there since 1907, one year after the big one. So when you are up to having a drinking fest with friends and taste 10 beers that have wacked names, take a trip to Jack's, you'll be back in no time flat for more.", "author": "Sven S."}

The weather was amazing and my boyfriend and I wanted to enjoy being outside.  We thought we'd get a couple drinks and share something to eat.  We sat down, looked at the menu, and should have left right then and there.  But we ordered a drink, he got a draft beer, which ended up costing $6.50, and I got a glass of the house wine - $7.50.  After looking at the menu for about 20 minutes, we finally chose to share the chicken sandwich.  The server asked if we wanted fries.  We asked if they came with it, and he said no, so we ordered a side of fries.  When our food came out, there were probably about 20 little pieces of old, cold fries, with a few pieces of good looking steak fries mixed in.  We thought it was a joke - asked our server if that was really the side order of fries, and he responded like an idiot.  Then we asked how much the \"side\" order cost.  $2.75.  Absolutely ridiculous.  They were disgusting.  It was the worst $30 ever spent.  I would never ever go back to this place.  The experience sucked for such a wonderful day.", "author": "Kristen V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-28", "description": "the staff in this bar is great.  they have a beautiful outside area which i didnt realize from sitting in the bar.  sitting wondering why the bartender was busy and just me sitting there once i asked who he was pouring beers in plastiy c cup for he said the outside is packed.  And wow to my shock they have an outside area thats huge.  but you may have to wait because all your beer is comming from one bartender inside.  maybe two at times.  eventually i found out that there is only one cook that cooks for all this outside and inside.  but you dont know that when your waiting inside by yourself for 30 minutes until they tell you.  also  yeah the beer is expensive but remind you it s the norm on the wharf.  and i've been to toranados and i was afraid to ask them about beer and they were so unpleasent and nasty.  at least this jacks staff knows there bere and are not scarey.  yeah maybe thay didnt smile to you.  but have you ever had a bad day?", "author": "cindy b."}
