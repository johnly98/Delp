It may be a problem when the store is crowded, but no employee told me that my ice cream was being made. I personally believe a large reason that these Ice Cream Rolls are popular is because it is very awesome to watch your ice cream being made.\n\nThe Ice Cream itself was good. I don't believe that it was artisan level ice cream, but the Matcha Ice Cream was still delicious. A big component of this style of ice creamery is the unlimited toppings. How the toppings work is: you ask the employee whatever toppings you want. If you want more, then you would have to ask the employee in your first trip to the toppings. In my opinion, I believe there should be a topping station for the customers(For things such as cereal, chocolate chips, nothing complicated).\n\nWhile the quality of everything is good, the outrageous price and the lack of viewing experience definitely makes this place somewhere I don't want go back to for awhile.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

The thai rolled ice cream trend has been appearing all over the Bay Area lately. Surprisingly, I never tried it when I lived in SJ. Walked in and there were crowds of people waiting for their order. \n\nThey have a little stand up menu at the entrance with several combos they've created from either thai tea, matcha, or vanilla ice cream I believe. It would've been nice to have listed what types of ice creams were in each design.. Anyways, my boyfriend and I shared a cookie monster (vanilla ice cream + oreo cookie). Unlimited toppings, but I'm not a huge fan of toppings on my ice cream so I only asked for strawberries. It took about 30 minutes for us to get our order. They were so backed up with orders, it was crazy. Kudos to the guys making the ice cream rolls though.. it was nonstop work for them! \n\nThere's really nothing special about these ice cream rolls except for the fact that they are freshly made and rolled up. They appear a little more frozen compared to regular scooped ice cream, but that's necessary to keep the shape. Ours tasted like any ordinary cookies n cream ice cream. \n\nIt was $6.50 (they had a promo going on). You're paying that price to get photo worthy ice cream and to pay for the labor that goes into making into these rolls! Honestly, I'd rather get a scoop of ice cream elsewhere and avoid the long wait.\n\nThey definitely need to hire more staff to keep up with this craze.", "author": "Sydney C."}

I LOVE my ice cream so it doesn't take much to make me happy when it comes down to it. But waiting 40 minutes on a Friday afternoon at 2pm is not my thing. Food does not taste better to me if I have to wait so long to get it. Since it's a small place after ordering you kinda get pushed in a corner or have to be super close to other people. The one spot in the corner I waited near had a stool which was nice but it was away from the guys actually doing the rolling so I never actually got to see the \"magic happen\". I hear that's the main reason people come here. \n\nOnce you order they give you a number. It costs $6.50 for the roll and you can get as many toppings as you like but they keep it minimal. I had the Thai chee with lychee and strawberry(only 1 piece given), condensed milk(very small amt), pocky sticks( I had to ask for 2 twice), cookie stick, whipped cream( a dollop) and rainbow sprinkles. I would ask for more since the toppings don't make it very long. The rolls stay colder longer so that's nice for less meltage while eating it.

We've been wanting to try rolled ice cream for awhile and was super excited to try it. There were a lot of people around 6:30pm on a Saturday but since the wait for izakaya sozai was an hour, we thought it would be a good idea to wait here and enjoy our ice cream before getting some ramen. Although the line was pretty long, we thought it would be a max of 20 minutes wait time, but nope! We waited for about an hour and ended up missing our table while waiting for the ice cream :( \n\nLuckily we were able to get the next table available at izakaya sozai.

The novelty is fun and the actual flavors are pretty darn intense. Not something you would expect. Storefront is pretty cramped though inside so if you're claustrophobic, I'd recommend waiting outside.\n\nThe menu is set already and you have a variety of flavors to try from. I ordered the \"mocha matcha\" which is matcha & cream. The workers actually making the ice cream get a decent arm work out each time. They're mashing up the ingredients and spreading it over the machine until the mixture freezes. At which point they scrape up the ice cream and roll it into 6-7 pieces. The amount may not seem like much but when you're eating it, it's actually quite filling. I almost finished mine. Almost.\n\nIn any case, after it's all neatly stacked in a cup, it goes down to the assembly line where an assortment of unlimited free toppings await you (sauces, fruits, cookies, nuts, etc). I opted for pocky sticks and an Oreo cookie.  The store should provided heftier spoons. These plastic ones are barely cutting it. Almost snapped mine in half just trying to eat the ice cream which is quite dense.\n\nI contemplated whether the wait was worth it. I mean, why wait for a ridiculous amount of time for ice cream when you can get ur dessert instantly at a regular ice cream shop? Well, the ice cream texture here is def different.

While they broke my Thai Ice Cream Rolls cherry last year in San Jose and I thoroughly enjoyed my first Thai Ice Cream Rolls experience, there was no way I was waiting up to 2 hours for it again for a novelty dessert.\n\nSo, we settled for froyo at Yogurtland in the same plaza, and all was good until the beezie in front of me sneezed INTO the toppings bar. She didn't even attempt to turn her head, she sneezed into the oreo's bin like it was nothing. While me eyes gave her the evil stare down, my thunder thighs thanked her - they did NOT need all those oreo filling. \n\nI heard that Let's Roll Ice Creamery (formerly JJ Ice Cream) started to serve Thai Ice Cream Rolls these week so decided to pay a visit before word gets outs. I visited on a weeknight and there was no one in line when I ordered but since everything is made to order expect each order (from ordering to finish product) to take about 5 minutes a person. Bench seating only.\n\nThey currently have 8 flavors: Nutella & Banana, Thai Tea & Lychee, Berries, Oreo Cookie, Coffee, Matcha, Bacon & Syrup, and Ube (Purple Yam). You receive 6 ice cream rolls with unlimited toppings for $6.50 this week. Regular price is $7. If you don't want to wait for the Ice Cream Rolls, they have Bud Ice Cream for $1.95/scoop. CC's accepted. Stamp card available. \n\nIf you've never had Thai Ice Cream Rolls before, it's a cool process to watch. A milk concoction is poured onto an iced grill, smoothed across the surface until it stiffens, and is scraped into ice rolls. Then, it's crowned with your choice of toppings. They don't have the toppings listed or labeled but they have over 10 sauces/syrups like condensed milk, caramel, chocolate, etc. and over 20 toppings like pocky, wafers, sprinkles, oreos, etc. Thank you for keeping the toppings covered!\n\nI ordered the #8 Master Ube ($6.50): http://bit.ly/2oMCDP2 with a condensed milk drizzle, pocky, and added fruity pebbles as suggested by one of the kind staff. Great suggestion as the fruity pebbles gave a nice crunchy texture contrast. \n\nI loved Icicles and STEEP Creamery's Thai Ice Cream Rolls but I wasn't loving this one. The ice cream rolls didn't maintain its shape so it was just like eating scooped ice cream. Part of the draw of Thai Ice Cream Rolls may be the theatrics of making it but I enjoy the sensation of the creamy roll melting in my mouth. It's a different texture and mouthfeel than plain 'ol scooped ice cream. I didn't get that here. They do give you an ample portion though so it's good for sharing. \n\nThe employees are really nice and it's obvious that they're trying their best, especially the ice cream rollers which have the toughest job of handcrafting each order. I appreciate that they wear sanitary face masks. Very hygienic. \n\nIf you have little hoomans, Let's Roll would be a great place to take them so they can marvel at their ice cream rolls being made in front of them. But, for those looking for artisan quality with housemade toppings/puddings, I think STEEP Creamery is a better option in San Francisco.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

My reason being I would already get to sample some of my friends' flavors; bless their hearts. If you haven't heard, rolled ice cream starts off as regular ice cream that gets smashed with some cream on a ice plate. The ice cream artists will then scrape it up into sections that look like a roll, place it in a little cup let you add toppings. I chose fruity pebbles because I can. Also added a straw biscuit because I'm adventurous.  It was good but I would still prefer regular scoops on a waffle cone.\n\nThat being said, be prepared to wait if you go at peak times.

The full list of rolled ice cream flavors are on a board on the floor. There were a lot of people and there wasn't always a person at the front with the tablet to get your order so one couple actually didn't know they had to order near the door beforehand. There are no signs or anything showing the process. \n\nAfter, you wait for your number to be called. They'll call your number to show that your ice cream is being made at one of the two stations if you want to watch or if they have any questions for you. Then either they give it to someone to help you put on toppings or they'll hand it directly to you to bring to a worker to put toppings on for you (another kink). I'd rather not have to get someone's attention to hand them my ice cream for toppings. \n\nLastly, you choose whatever toppings you want. Another kink is that they don't have a full list or any labels on their toppings so you kinda have to guess what they have. They have condensed milk, chocolate syrup, pocky sticks, oreos, Graham crackers, sprinkles, and more. It didn't seem like there was a limit which was nice? Or maybe there is one and I just didn't hit it. We only asked for 2-3 toppings on ours. It took about 20 mins for ours to get made. \n\nWe got the Cookie Monster and the Cafe Ole but I only tried the Cookie Monster. I thought it was pretty good.

There's usually quite a line here and if you try this place - you'll definitely understand why! Something about their ice cream is extremely addicting! It's like they put crack seasoning it there (in the most harmless way!). \n\nSmall will run you about $5 while a regular will run you about $7. The top flavors for me to try here are the ube and the thai tea (with lychee!). I had the thai tea one the other day and it was just lovely - happiness all around! We split a regular between three people since we did have dinner coming up, and I'm pretty sure I could have consumed that whole cup myself (and plan on doing this soon!). Toppings are unlimited - and range from cereals, to asian snacks (chocolate wafers, pocky, mochi!), to roasted marshmallows and a huge array of fruit! You can watch as they make your ice cream fresh through the glass panes and the staff are so nice and friendly when I'm piling on as many toppings as possible! The staff actually asked us if we wanted three roasted marshmallows and wafers (which would never fit in the cup)! So sweet!  The quality of ice cream here is really good too. If you've ever had ice cream fall apart to goop if you don't eat it quickly enough, be prepared for the complete opposite. You thoroughly enjoy the entire experience of thick, cold, flavorful ice cream, virtually melt free! \n\nMy favorite toppings are mochi (you HAVE to have mochi), an assortment of fruit, and cap'n crunch. You can ask them for more of any item if you'd like and they will do it so don't be shy. Much of my happiness comes from the combo of ice cream and mochi so I must have a bunch! \n\nSome benches are available in one corner of the store, but probably only fit about 10 - 12 people max!

They have pre-made flavors in milk form, then they roll them out for you and add all the toppings you want at no extra cost. The wait? Kind of ridiculous. I understand it's new, so everyone wants to try it. They had 3 workers making the ice cream at a time and I had to wait about an hour for mine. \n\nWas it worth the wait? Probably not. Maybe I'm picky since I've had it in Thailand, where it originated. The flavors are mixed with plain milk and created per order there. It would take a long time there as well. \n\nTo sum it up, if there's only a few people WAITING, then go for it. If there are people waiting AND there's a line, you may want to prepare yourself for a bit of a wait or come back another time. I'm still glad this type of place is opening up in SF, but the process can be better.", "author": "Aaron Y."}

Here's the concept: skilled ice cream scoopers skillfully mash and mix your ice cream into little rolls, cup them, and add toppings. It's a sight to behold. You've seen the videos online, right? (example: http://imgur.com/gallery/ckRFA)\n\nFor $8 ($7.95 before tax) a piece, it's basically a glorified Cold Stone Creamery--that is, ice cream, customizeable toppings, and a show. I do appreciate the unlimited toppings, though. The number of bases you can choose from is limited (and may be more limited than you expect--no matcha, no ube when I went), and they \"roll\" a limited amount of ingredients into the actual ice cream rolls, which tbh makes it a little less impressive. After they're finished rolling, they call you up and ask you which toppings you want. Don't get me wrong, the rolling is a spectacle to behold, and definitely adds depth to the flavor of the ice cream. I think it would be a little better if they used a creamier ice cream to add some softness though (although it might compromise the integrity of the rolls? idk I'm no ice cream expert).\n\nAfter getting one of our orders wrong (asked for a Cookie Monster & a S'mores, got two S'mores), it felt like the employees were implying we were lying by showing us that they rang up S'mores x2. I was sure that our order was repeated back to us when we ordered, and I didn't really mind the mistake, but it didn't feel very good to get the blame deferred to me.\n\nOther things:\n- Love that there is an area strictly for viewing the \"rolling show,\" behind glass and all.\n- Price tag seems to be growing. A while back it was ~$7 a cup, now it's ~$8.\n- Beware of the loud high school crowd.", "author": "Jade V."}

My first time ever having Ice Cream rolls was here at Let's Roll. \n\nMY EXPERIENCE:\n\nIt's a really small shop. When I say small, I mean \"you can only take a few steps into the shop\". The place was packed when I went, but there were only like 9 people. \n\nYou order right when you walk into the shop and then they give you a ticket with numbers on it after you purchase your order. I ordered the 3x Berries. I had to squeeze my way through people to see them make my ice cream rolls. It was interesting just watching them prepare and make the rolls. I feel like it's a very important experience when you get ice cream rolls for the first time. \n\nAfter your ice cream rolls are done being made, they call out your number when ready. You then get to pick out toppings. They had a whole board of toppings. I was really surprised at how many toppings there were. I got the raspberry sauce with strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and whip cream! They say you can have as many toppings as you want. Which is pretty cool. \n\nI really didn't know what to expect when I took a bite out of my ice cream rolls. I thought it wouldn't be creamy enough because it was thin and made on an ice cold metal surface. But I was wrong! It tasted creamy and had a great flavor. Personally I really liked it. The toppings made it even better. \n\nMy overall experience was good. I have no complaints except for the size of the shop. It was just too small for how popular it is. I came here a second time and it was still packed. I ordered the same thing. It was still good to me! It's a nice dessert snack on a warm sunny day!", "author": "Tiger Y."}

I really like that this place gives you unlimited toppings so we topped it off with crushed Oreos, whole Oreo, almonds, mochi, pretzels, and a toasted marshmallow that they torched! I think it's a very cool idea but I don't see a big difference of this in texture (when you get a scoop it kind of looks like regular ice cream) and a regular scoop of ice cream.

Along with myself and 3 others, we encountered a decent long line that took about 10-15 minutes. Having tried rolled ice cream previously at Icicles in San Jo, I was very excited to bring my mom and sister to try rolled ice cream for the first time locally and with a menu listed on the menu we decided amongst 4 flavors: Master Ube, Strawberry Cheescake, 3x Berry, and Mo'cha Matcha. Inconvenient enough, they did not have master ube so we had to suffice with Cookie Monster AND we got a Mo'cha Matcha but they didn't have mochi toppings at all! Someone please explain to me why it's called \"Mo'cha\".\n\nEach cup with unlimited toppings called for $6.50 a piece; spent about $28 including tax. Our number was #81 and they called out #63 once we got out of line so we knew we would be here for a while. All in all, we waited in line for 1hr 45 min. I honestly believe the reason it takes very long compared to other rolled ice cream places is their lack of # employees. Having 6 employees on a busy day is not enough and gets very tiring for the rollers!\n\nI suggest that while the cashier takes down the order he has a nice amount of cups enough to pause with the next guest in order to prep the cup and help out the other employees so the line won't go by as quick and the wait for the product itself wouldn't take as long.\n\nWe had a bit of an additional hold up, however, when our four cups of ice cream did not come out at the same time. The third cup was taken by the employee and came out 10 minutes later than the fourth cup had its toppings. We were very aggravated and disappointed by the lack of reassurance that the ice cream will come out on time. When we tried to inform the workers, we got ignored multiple times and were never appreciated with an apology for the wait. By the time we got out ice cream, the next cup to be asked for toppings was #91(mind you we were #81). I appreciate the time and effort for the workers and understand it is a tiring job but some reassurance or decency to inform the customers that the wait would increase is just a prime factor of customer service. \n\nFor the product itself, the ice cream was very decent tasting but I wish they had more toppings such as mochi and tapioca. Some rolls were very sloppy once put inside the cup and toppings are very limited quantity. For myself, I got the strawberry cheesecake and I really enjoyed the cream taste in it. I included toppings with crushed ghram cracker, crushed Oreos, condensed milk, strawberries, raspberries, & whipped cream(must try!) I appreciate the place itself and despite the wait, I will come back again just to have my cup of local rolled ice cream.", "author": "Alyssa G."}

There wasn't much of a wait, probably because this is still fairly new. It was my first time having rolled ice cream and I LOVED it. One of my friends had tried the one in New York, and another one had tried the one in San Jose prior to this, but they both liked this place more. \n\nService: 5 Stars! Their rolled ice cream is good but the service I experienced last night made the experience even better. The owners and employees were super friendly, and one of them told us that he grew up in SF. I love helping out local businesses since I grew up in the city myself. The girl that made my ice cream was super friendly and didn't get annoyed at all when my friends and I took a while deciding on our toppings. Instead, she helped us narrow down our decisions and even tossed out some suggestions. I felt like I was talking to a friend instead of dealing with customer service. They also gave my entire group of friends (there were 5 of us) one free stamp on our stamp card! SO NICE. \n\nRolled Icecream: We shared the Cookie Monster and the 3x Berry (Strawberry, Blueberry, Raspberry). Both flavors were delicious. The vanilla base that they used for our ice cream had a slight malt taste which personally I am a huge fan of. I love malt! The berry flavor was refreshing and not too overwhelming. I love that they use fresh fruit and combine the ingredients in front of your eyes. When they're done rolling your ice cream, you can add as many toppings as you want - whaaat?! So awesome. \n\nAt first I thought $6-7 was a little pricey for an order of ice cream but when you think about the service and the effort that goes into it, it makes sense. The portions are fair - I recommend sharing with a friend(s) because I think it would have been too much for me to finish by myself (unless I had an empty stomach).  \n\nDefinitely looking forward to my next visit here.

I am a really big fan of rolled ice cream and I have to say I really enjoyed the Thai Chee the first time around, much more. During my visit the second time around, I noticed that when they add the Lychee, it's one small piece. The first time I came here, they were really generous with the additions into the rolled ice cream. The rolled ice cream definitely still has it's amazing taste, however there are some downsides, such as service and lack of structure. Some of the workers didn't seem to know what they were doing and were slightly confused. My friend checked in and wanted to use the Yelp discount promotion and the young man helping us at the register was unsure of how to use this promo. This definitely was a bit shocking, as you'd expect every person working the register to be up to date with current promos and how they are to go about entering them. In addition, it was quite upsetting that they would literally use one piece of fruit to mix in with the ice cream base. Example: One slice of a banana, one cube of chocolate, one chunk of mango. \n\nAlthough there were many people waiting for their orders, it was a little unusual to see how much this place has changed over such a short period of time. I really do hope that they read their reviews and improve on the negative aspects.", "author": "Julia K."}

I got their matcha flavor (all ice cream flavors are $7.05 with tax included) and had crushed oreos, lychee jelly, and a condensed milk drizzle as my toppings - all toppings are included in that one price too! I really liked the ice cream from this place - just a heads up that this store is very small and they have limited seating (just a few benches next to the walls and no tables) so if you plan to come here on a nice sunny weekend like I did, you might want to go somewhere else to actually eat your ice cream since there probably won't be much space inside!

I've been wanting to try rolled ice cream for a while but didn't want to drive too far for it. So I was pretty excited when I found out that Let's Roll just opened up in my neighborhood.

While we waited for our rolled ice cream we enjoyed watching the staff carefully creating our orders. It's such a unique technique to make yummy ice cream.

Since it was 20 minutes before closing time, there was not much of a wait. The cashier was waiting for us to order.\n\nI ordered a small Thai Chee. It came out to be $5.42. I gave the cashier $5.50 since I could deal with the change. But he just stood there and told me repeatedly that it was $5.42, even raising his voice at me after I gave him 2 more cents. The worker who was at the toppings station even looked over. He could have just taken my money and given me change, but instead was incredibly rude and made me confused. Customer service could be improved.\n\nThe ice cream was great and did not melt fast. Thai flavor with a lychee aftertaste. There were unlimited toppings so it was a plus. The same person who was the cashier served me and gave generous amounts. Also, I had no idea there were unlimited toppings until after I paid and thought that I missed my opportunity.\n\nSuggestions: Have a menu board that has the flavors and toppings in one place.", "author": "Jia Yi S."}

It takes time to roll ice cream - part of ordering here is getting to watch them make it right in front of you! And if that isn't what you're looking for, then there are tons of regular ice cream places you can go and get your normal rounded scoop in a cup (or cone) :)\n\nThat said, I really liked this place! I came here on a Saturday evening, and yes, there were a good 5+ people ahead of me, so I had to wait. Nonetheless not *quite* 5 stars from me mostly because of the price, but it was fun watching all the different flavors being prepared, and plan out how many of the (freeeee) toppings I wanted.\n\nThe layout is awkward and you're kind of funneled into the corner to watch them roll ice cream, or up by the window with some limited seating by the cashier. \n\nNotes:\n\n- Everyone will have their phones out to video the rolling process. It's like you're in a mosh pit but without all the sweat.\n\n- Friendly service from the cashier and topping-adding server! Our server was particularly creative and did very nice (read: Instagram-able) designs with our topping choices. Courteous and friendly.\n\n- Ice cream rollers appeared to be the strong, silent type. Focused and doing their thing. Also probably avoiding eye contact with all the videographers.\n\n- The ice cream will be practically solid once you get it. So enjoy taking photos with it for a bit to let it soften up before digging in.\n\nI'm coming back for sure!", "author": "Vicky F."}

I tried Thai Chee for my first time there and it was really good! They poured their Thai tea cream and mixed in whole lychee pieces in it. If Thai and Lychee is your two favorite things then you'll definitely have a strong taste from both flavors. The next one I tasted was Master Ube (purple yam and vanilla).  I definitely recommending topping it with Oreos and Condensed milk. Overall I'd come back here again when the crowd dies down so there's less of a wait time.

The ice cream tasted very much like regular ice cream but left us  waiting for 20 minutes with two orders ahead of us. Giving an extra star for their effort and kind service but I just can't justify how our cup of ice cream that taste so normal costed us $7.", "author": "Crystina L."}

We wanted dessert after having a nice Saturday lunch at San Tungs so we decided to try the rolled ice cream craze.  We waited 57 minutes for ice cream!  I can't believe we waited this long.  We should have asked for our money back after 15 min.  They should really disclose how long you have to wait for your order to be completed.  Our wait for San Tungs was only 5 min! SMH.  The ice cream was creamy but I would never wait more than 5 min. for rolled ice cream.  You're better off finding another ice cream scoop place.  Waste of time!!!! It's not worth it. One star for wait time and lack of space to sit and eat your ice cream when you actually get it.", "author": "Leen B."}

The wait was absolutely horrendous and took over an hour and a half! The store was also super hot and unbearable to wait for your ice cream in. You're better off going to the grocery store next door to get a tub for $4.99 and throwing some strawberries on it! Very overrated for me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-16", "description": "This was a great experience. If you've never tried rolled ice cream, you must. They make your individual order from scratch--meaning they start out with a cup of cream. You can watch them make it. They pour the cream and whatever ingredients you order onto a super cooled pan, mix it up, and flatten it out.  It freezes, they scrape it off (into rolls), & put it in a dish. You have your choice of about 20 different free toppings and then they serve it to you.  It's delicious!  Please be aware, however, that since every order is custom made from scratch, you need to allow 15 to 20 minutes (if it's not too crowded) between ordering and being served ice cream. But it's well worth the wait!", "author": "Jay Y."}

My only complaint ... please ask the young lady with the very long ponytail to tie it up because every time she turned around, the bottom of her hair would touch the ice cream waiting for toppings.  I'm sure she didn't know it, but it's not very appetizing to watch.  Hair nets?!  Just kidding, but maybe a bun couldn't hurt.", "author": "G. M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-04-23", "description": "This place is great if you have an hour window in your day that you can solely dedicate to getting ice cream.... The ice cream itself is good, but nothing special. The service and wait on the other hand was atrocious. Paint drys faster than these people work. Everything they do is in slow motion. I'm willing to cut them some slack though, because overall they looked like a rather young staff. Nonetheless, an hour long wait for some ice cream is absolutely ridiculous. Let's Roll could improve by picking up the speed and finding a way to be more efficient with their service.", "author": "Nick N."}

It was my second time coming here and I waited much longer than I did the first time. I waited 30 mins the first time and this time I waited 45 mins. I also waited an extra 10 mins because they still weren't open even though it was already 1. They should also have more people make the ice cream because they literally only make one order at a time. The ice cream isn't bad but it isn't amazing either. I won't be returning unless they find a way to get the orders out quicker because 45 mins for just one order of ice cream is ridiculous.", "author": "Cee H."}

Decided to bring my family to try it, since the first time I ordered the Thai Chee and thought it was really good.  This time we ordered the Matcha-cha (regular sized, the larger of the two sizes) and the Thai Chee again. \n\nAs the guy was making the matcha roll, he sloppily puts all but one roll into the cup. There was one more roll left on the cold plate.  Thought he would easily adjust the position of the rolls to fit the last roll. But no...he picks up the perfectly good roll and throws it away! Right in front of us! Basically, he made a sloppy \"small\" sized cup but I got charged for the larger size ($7). The guy should know, as in any business that you prepare someone's meal or dessert in front of the receiving patron, you should never discard a good piece (it wasn't \"extra\" either) that is owed to the consumer. In fact, they always \"pre-measure\" the cream mixture in a cup beforehand, so it is not like he made too much. When I started eating my ice cream, I noticed the center roll was really thin and half was missing (probably an edge of an incomplete roll), so there was a good empty space in the center. \n\nI regret tipping them now....but my fault since I tipped before he made my ice cream roll. Very disappointed since I didn't get what I paid for. Sorry, I really don't like giving negative reviews, but for the high price and for ditching my last roll, minus 3 stars.", "author": "Kimmie G."}

There is a tiny sign hidden by the register and that's the only way you know not to hop in line like everyone so eagerly waiting (to see their ice cream made not order) either way I got to the front to be laughed at and told sorry you need to order over there and get in the back of the 30 minute line again.. you've got to be kidding me!! They were rude and wouldn't give me any consideration for having waited for nothing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-04", "description": "The ice cream is okay, but nothing special.  The process of making the rolls - spreading the melted ice cream onto a frozen surface, then scraping the thin layers into rolls which are then stacked vertically into a cup - is, first, tediously time consuming, and second, changes the lovely smooth creaminess into a very cold flaky structure which only becomes edible when it melts a bit.  Plus it's VERY expensive, $7.05, for a smallish cup.  This feels like a gimmick, a fad with a short life.  I hope the hard working folks doing the scraping don't get wrist injuries.", "author": "Betty K."}
