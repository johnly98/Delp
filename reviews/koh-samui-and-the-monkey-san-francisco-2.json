Huge portion of rice and then small/medium portion of meat. If they made the portions more balanced I think it would be a winner. With that said the food is always delicious.

Upon entrance, it took a minute for anyone to even acknowledge us. It was probably the tail end of the lunch rush. Not a big deal to wait, just felt awkward as there was a bunch of people leaving and we had nowhere to go but stand by the entrance/podium. \n\nAfter we were seated, everything felt nice with the windows letting in a perfect amount of light. Service was fine, as I don't have any complaints. What it came down to was the food. The pad see ew was good - a very fair amount for the price and the flavor was good. The panang on the other hand was very disappointing. It wasn't sweet and the flavor was off, the tofu seemed a bit off..perhaps even a bit sour. \n\nI'm fairly forgiving so this could've just been an off day.

We did not, and were seated at a two top by the window pretty quickly. \n\nFood: We ordered the Panang curry with chicken instead of beef. A bowl of curry arrived with a side of rice. Tasted OK. Not spicy, and looked heavy on the coconut milk. The belly basil was a pork belly stir fry with Chinese broccoli. The pork belly had been previously deep fried, and then added to the stir fry. This was pretty tasty. Pork belly seldom disappoints. \n\nService: It was the beginning of lunch, but as most tables were still filling up, it was still a bit slow for getting our order taken. Food took a little longer, but came out hot and fresh. Water needs to be requested, but staff were good at keeping them filled. \n\nCost: The two entrees ran us about $27 after tax. \n\nOverall: They've also got a to-go area when you first enter the building if you want a quicker option.", "author": "Shirley B."}

When deciding what to pick for our Friday office lunch, I realized I hadn't had Thai curry in a while. Decided to try Koh Samui & The Monkey. It arrived on April 14th around 12 noon via Forkable.\n\nGreen Curry Beef ($13): \n*Sliced beef with bamboo shoots, zucchini, basil, and bell pepper in green curry; served with jasmine rice\n*Choice of Rice: sub Brown Rice (+$1)\n\nI was a little delicate from the night before, so I really needed carbs! The brown rice was actually the best part of my meal. Perfectly cooked. Soft and chewy, but not mushy. The curry, however, was a little too thin for me. Almost watery. I love thicker curries, so this was a little disappointing. Almost like spooning soup on my rice. Not quite the sauciness I wanted. There was an average amount of meat and veggies (maybe even less than normal), but I think because the curry was so thin, it just seemed less substantial. It did have a nice flavor and they made it spicy, which I indicated on my order.\n\nLoved the brown rice, but the star of my meal didn't really shine. If you like thin curries, this may be the spot for you. But I need my thick, saucy, comforting curry. 4 stars for the rice, but 2 for the curry. Averaging it out to 3 stars.", "author": "Elena N."}

Slightly more than Ozone a couple of blocks away but I really appreciate that they take credit cards and trust you enough to walk away with your food to go next door into the dining room to pay with plastic. \n\nPretty standard Thai fare like pad Thai, basil chicken, a variety of curries (meat and veggie), and other stir fry dishes. The one standout is something that is simply called \"crispy chicken\" and it is exactly what it's called. Crispy fried bits of chicken dressed in a sweet and spicy sauce.

We usually say, \"Hey what do you want?\" and usually our response is \"Well we haven't had Thai food this week.\" It is like a weekly tradition to come here.\n\nI have tried a lot of things on the menu, some really good and some not so great. I have had the Fresh Spring Rolls (Po Sod). They come with shrimp, lettuce, mint leaves and noodles and served with peanut sauce. These are my favorite! I usually eat these as a meal also because they come with a good amount for one person. I also ordered the Green Papaya salad. It has shredded green papaya, prawns, cherry tomatoes and peanuts with a spicy lime dressing. This was really good also, but it is more of a side dish than a personal salad. It was so small that I was still hungry afterwards.\n\nNow for the things that are not terrible, but didn't blow me away. At every Thai restaurant you have to try their Pad Thai. Their's comes with thin rice noodles with tofu, egg, bean sprouts and lime in a tamarind sauce. I thought it was good, but nothing special about it. I definitely have had better elsewhere. Also, my all time favorite Thai dish is Panang Curry, so I always have to try this too and compare which is my favorite. The Panang Curry Beef is stewed with kaffir leaves in panang curry. This was a little on the bland side for me. I am used to a lot of yummy rich curry flavor and then the freshness of the kaffir leaves, but this just was subpar.\n\nThis place is great for a quick lunch, dinner, or a big party.

One is Ozone on 2nd, and the other is Koh Samui & The Monkey.\n\nOne thing is clear - both are pretty mediocre. The challenge is which mediocre Thai food you feel like that day. \n\nKoh Samui has a higher yelp rating than Ozone but I find Koh Samui worse. \n\nFirst of all, the prices are pretty high for mediocre food. I get it, we're in techie SoMa so everything is going to be a bit more expensive. But I expect a higher standard if you're going to up your prices. \n\nSecond, the menu is a bit misleading. Our group of 6 all expected something different from the description in the menu. For instance, I ordered fried chicken with papaya salad expecting a breaded fried chicken but got a skinless \"fried\" chicken. My two friends ordered a pork stew with no \"stew\" but only pork with very little sauce. My other friend got a ginger honey pork with egg noodles, but this one actually came in a soup without him realizing it. \n\nAnyways, I've always known this place was mediocre but what broke me is the last (and final) time I visited. You see, we got in at 12pm and finally got our food at 1pm and the restaurant wasn't even busy. And all of our food didn't arrive at the same time. Three people got their food and the others had to wait for another 10~15 minutes which is my biggest pet peeve. Not only that, every table seated after us got served their food first and were out the door before our group. Our server started to bartend (?) and was not interested in our table for the most of the meal. We had to get up and track him down just to ask for the check.

Unfortunately this would turn out to be a huge and costly mistake, one that would become a kitchen nightmare.\n\nWhen our party of 4 was seated, we were delivered only 2 waters.  When asked over and over and over for another two, we were generally ignored until it came time to order.  I should have taken this as a bad sign, but the worst was yet to come.

After multiple inquiries to the waiter (who couldn't possibly have been more incompetent), I took up the issue with the two hostesses who couldn't care less.  I asked a total of 4 times when the dish would arrive and it wasn't until we had completed our meal that the salad hobbled in on our heels.  I turned the dish away and sent it back, and there was absolutely no apology from the waitstaff or hostesses whatsoever.  Not even a gesture of good will was offered at all.  Besides all that, I found the food bland, and the portion sizes were pathetic for the price.  Pedestrian dishes averaged between $15-20+ for basic entrees and had about half of the food we would have expected, leaving our table hungry and angry all at the same time.

Only one waiter for the entire restaurant so you can imagine how things went.\n\nWe ordered the bacon wrapped scallops which were uhmazing! Loved the sauce! And the grilled steak salad - pretty good.  Then it went downhill from there.  We ordered pork belly basil which turned out dry, tough, and lacking in flavor.  Looking down on our plates we felt we really couldn't eat it we sent it back and ordered something else.\n\nWe tried the Beef Mango which didn't turn out much better.  The vegetable presentation was the same so meat with peppers, carrots, the beef was tough and tasted like boiled beef and the sauce was just a sauce.\n\nOne glass of wine and three beers plus this unmemorable meal came up to $79 before tips.  So close to $100 I'd say was expensive for mediocre food.  OSHA Thai is a more reliable bet for tasty food. And better service!", "author": "Favoloso M."}

Yes.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, it just wasn't that great, especially for the price. First of all, the lamb was definitely not to die for. The lamb was tender (a plus!), but was over seasoned (too salty!). It did, however, come with some nice veggies to cut the salt factor. The pad thai was slightly too al dente for my taste and the flavor wasn't too memorable. The Fire Cracker (mixed seafood, bell, onion, carrot, green bean and spicy peanut sauce) had a great sauce and the seafood was cooked well. This was my dish of choice among the three we tried. The Thai iced tea was too sweet (but that is the case for a lot of places); I simply diluted with water.\n\nOverall, the food was probably at 3 stars, and at a 3-star level I would return to try other dishes, but because of the price tag I have to give this place a 2. The food is definitely not worth how much they charge. As far as coming back to this place... chances are I probably wouldn't unless someone was celebrating a birthday here.", "author": "Erin G."}

There's Miracle-Gro, the fertilizer that turns Venus Flytraps into man-eaters and returns Pluto Flytraps to legitimacy. Then there's Miracle Duck, the cooked Thai duck that upon being served rears its head at you, smiles and winks, gets up, flies around in a trail of sparkles, and after the meal goes to your house to clean your room and do your homework.\n\nThe stuff we have tried, however, is still pretty good. There are actually a number of things on the menu that I want to get to. In addition to the menus, they have an off-brand version of Highlights magazine for kids to read while you and your compatriots douse the sugar cubes for your absinthe - absinthe, in a Thai restaurant! - and dig into the meal.

The popular Thai restaurant closes their lunch menu each day at 2:30 PM, but I just happened to completely ignore the posted hours when I walked into the restaurant closer to 2:45 PM.  I asked if I could still order lunch and surprisingly the friendly staff seated me.  It didn't even dawn on me that the restaurant might have been closed even as the table settings were being changed and the bar area was being swept and vacuumed.\n\nI was handed an express lunch menu.  The Quick Set lunch allows one to select an appetizer from four available choices and a main entr\u00e9e from another list of four choices served with jasmine rice.  I selected the Chicken Satay and the Spicy Roast Duck Curry.  Shortly after I ordered my server politely informed me that normal lunch hours end at 2:30 PM, but he insisted that it was okay and asked me not to rush with my meal.  As you might have guessed I felt pretty awkward at that moment.  As the menu implies the food is served very quickly.  I'm certain my late arrival had something to do with that too.\n\nThe Chicken Satay (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9Q8_UWUAf32TbnldHWonRw?select=Z89WJfBr1yfx9_B7L4fU-A) was two skewers of seasoned chicken breast meat grilled and topped with peanut sauce and served over a bed of shaved red cabbage with a pickled cucumber and red onion salad on the side.  Despite the hot temperature of the chicken I was definitely feeling guilty as I woofed down my appetizer quickly.  It was very good.\n\nThe Spicy Roast Duck Curry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9Q8_UWUAf32TbnldHWonRw?select=MQM_x4lDAnIvLKGyuHjeUg) was very good too.  It was maybe not quite as spicy as I would have preferred, but I managed to eat the entire serving with the rice and all.  The main entree had lots of boneless duck meat that had sunk to the bottom of the dish of mildly spicy curry sauce with chunks of red and green bell peppers, pineapple chunks and cherry tomatoes.  I enjoyed the selection very much and will order it again if it is available in a future visit.\n\nWhen my server walked by to ask how I was doing and reiterated to me not to rush through my meal I just couldn't help but to eat it bit faster than I normally would.  I was in and out of the restaurant in less than 30 minutes.  Long story short, the food was very good and the service was impeccable.  Next time I'll be certain to visit well before 2:30 PM to enjoy their lunch menu more properly.\n\nThanks to the staff at Koh Samui & the Monkey for seating me and offering me such fabulous service when other restaurants might have asked me to leave!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Ok back to my review. For starters we ordered the pork spare ribs, fried sweet corn fritters, chicken mieng kum and a cup of tom yum kung soup.  Everything was served hot which was nice, except the mieng kum which is a cold dish. The pork spare ribs ( 4-5 avg sized ribs) had a little kick to them, luckily our daughter still ate it with her side of steamed rice. She's 4 1/2 years old. The corn fritters ( 6 pieces)  had a crisp to them on the outside and then soft on the inside which I did not expect. Not bad, but different. The mieng kum ( 6 spinach leave sizes)  was new for us and that tasted really good and refreshing. The server instructed us on how to eat it and pretty yummy. Lastly the cup of tom yum kung soup came and 3 prawns were included in it. Very flavorful. \n\nBy this time we were pretty content. Although we still had 2 dishes coming. We had the shrimp pad thai and the Sri Ra Char Grilled Pork. The Pad Thai had was served with maybe 6 pieces of shrimp or more which was nice, although the noodles seemed a bit undercooked or stiff. Not as soft and lacked the kick I usually taste..maybe it could have used a little more fish sauce or rice vinegar? I'm not sure..but something... and the Grilled Pork was plentiful but it seemed more like it was panned fried vs. grilled? It came with sticky rice and some pickled cucumbers w/ mangos on the side which was a nice touch. \n\nWould we come back, maybe...although it was pricey although we did order a lot for just 2 1/2 people.  Service I would say was pretty good. Everything came out hot and fresh. You might think service may be slow, but it was fine for us... It enabled us to enjoy our dishes and digest and be ready for the next dish. \n\nBefore I forget..one thing I did notice was that the chairs you sit on are very heavy so if you have a child, I don't think you have to worry about your chair tipping over.

We ordered the Andaman Sea Bass, Jurassic Park Shrimp and tom yum soup. The tom yum was the worst that we've ever had. It was very sweet with big whole pieces of cherry tomatoes floating in it. When the sea bass arrived, the tiny little piece of fish was hidden under a bed of huge pile of veggies. The fish was so less, $20 for the plate it was shocking. We were 2 in our group. When we divided the fish it was exactly two spoonfuls. One spoon for each of us!! The shrimp was also quite small, but not as less as the fish. For $55 (without tip) we left feeling cheated. There are many Thai restaurants in and around Soma where you can get a good portion of protein for $55! While walking out, I politely told them about the disappointment about the food and the quantity. I was told that sea bass is very expensive that's why the portion is so small. Sea Bass is also one of my fav fishes and I order it in other restaurants quite often. Never have I been served two spoonfuls of fish hidden under piles of onions, red peppers and some leafy vegetable. So watch out for the Monkey!

Koh Samui managed to fit the bill, so we trekked the one block to get there, glanced over a well-rounded menu, and ordered the Miracle Duck and Basil Gai for entrees, two sides of rice, and a green tea creme brulee for dessert.\n\nOverall, everything was just okay, with nothing that stood out. The duck curry had good flavor overall (a bit sweet, with a bit of kick), but the texture of the duck was a bit unusual, and more akin to chicken. The basil gai was even less interesting: a simple stir-fried ground chicken dish that was a bit on the sweet side as well. And the creme brulee was a bit disappointing because the green tea flavor was not noticeable at all. \n\nService was very friendly, while the decor was interesting (very thematic, if any anything, which can sometimes err on the side of being too touristy). Total bill came out to $57 after tax and tip, which was probably a bit more than we were aiming for (they charge $2-3 dollars for a bowl of rice). All in all, not a bad Thai restaurant, but given the other options available to you in the city, there are much, much better places for your money (Ler Ros and Basil Thai, for example).\n\nAs an aside - one will notice that the restaurant is actually up on the second floor.

They had called in earlier and inquired if the groupon could be used. The person they spoke to on the phone confirmed that it could and made a reservation for them. They came, completed their meal and so began a pretty lengthly, verbal battle between Koh Samui versus the groupon couple. Although they were verbally told when making their reservation it was allowable, the server and shift manager would not budge. There was zero remorse and minimal accountability. In fact, the on shift manager began to threaten the patrons if they would not pay the bill. She offered a partial discount, but wouldn't honor the groupon. She began to threaten the patrons that she would call the police. \n\nThese people were trying to enjoy a meal and you pretty much not only ruined theirs, you ruined mine as well. \n\nIf companies don't want to deal with the repercussions of deals like groupon, living social, etc., DON'T USE IT. \n\nFor the owners, teach your staff basic etiquette and fundamentals of customer service.", "author": "Natalie S."}

It looked nice from the outside and it was very packed so I thought \"let me add this place on my bucket list\".   \n\nLast night the Mister and I stopped by here because we were on our way to the Giants game and didn't want to pay bank to eat overly processed and bland ballpark food.  Not impressed.  The food was just as bland and equally overly priced.  He ordered chicken pad thai: bland, unseasoned chicken, terrible presentation, cold tofu pieces that smelled sour (old).  I ordered tom yum goong extra spicy: very bland, no flavor dimension, very sweet and not close to extra spicy like I ordered.  We also had the bags of gold: tasty inside and nice presentation.  That's about it folks, nothing to rant and rave about and definitely not a place I'll be visiting any time soon, if ever at all...\n\nNote: There is a pretty nice bar set up.  Several flat screen TVs and at one point the place even set up a projector which played the game...this is the only real positive.", "author": "Nancy P."}

He is insane now.\n\n\"Would you like to touch my monkey? Touch him! Touch my monkey!\"\n\nKoh Samui & the Monkey sounds like a Siamese organ grinder and his pimpy chimp with the little bellboy hat and an even littler tin cup. But no, it's not....it's really an industrial-chic Thai restaurant with lots of Pier One touches to remind you that hey, you're in a Thai restaurant.\n\n...\"I am so filled with anticipation that my genitals have sucked up into my body cavity.\"\n\nSaturday in the early afternoon is a great time to go there. It's empty since you can barely tell it's open from the street. Jamie W. and I realized neither of us had been there in quite a while. He used to work a block away and get take-out, and I used to meet colleagues there after work. When it's quiet, the open space makes the place seem more inviting. That and the staff is relaxed and constantly smiling in that true Thai manner.\n\n...\"I appreciate a warm hand on my opening....your story has become tiresome.\"\n\nWe are trying to eat healthier these days, so we went for three dishes that did not appear to make our triglycerides do a sizable uptick. First up was the $8 Crying Tiger Salad, a provocatively named dish that mixed grilled strips of beef with lime juice, various herbs, chili flakes and red onion. Deliciously savory. I was genuinely excited to see Pea Shoots in Garlic as a vegetable side since I haven't had them since a visit to Ton Kiang out on Geary a couple of years ago. Extremely tasty with a nice bite to them.\n\n...\"Now I am as happy as a little girl!\" (Dieter is now pinching his black spandex shirt to simulate the erection of his nipples.)\n\nOur main entree was the $10 Bangkok B.B.Q. Chicken which came with a tangy green papaya salad. The chicken came in small pieces perfectly grilled. We were sated. The only blight on the afternoon were the expensive Diet Cokes, $3 a glass and no refills.\n\n...\"I feel spent...like a man who is forced to wear his genitals around his neck like a pendant.\"\n\nJamie and I decided we need to come back here more often, as this and Basil are easily the two best Thai restaurants in SoMa. By the way, what's with those funky \"Lost and Found\" postcards of faux-missing dogs in the restroom? I think they would have been funnier in a Vietnamese place since their fictitious canine dishes are the stuff of legend.\n\n ...\"I am emotionally obliterated ...now is the time on Sprockets when we dance ...DANCE!\"\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...really like every dish I've had at this place...fresh and never sauce-laden\nAMBIANCE - 5 stars...love the open space, and hey, I like Pier One\nSERVICE - 5 stars...forever smiling and attentive\nTOTAL - 5 stars... Dieter has the final word: \"This restaurant pulls down my pants and taunts me. But not in a mean-spirited way. It looks at me when I'm naked and calls its friends.\"...need I say more.", "author": "Ed U."}

The preparation on the noodles is hard to beat. Everything is very fresh with attention to detail and presentation. Every other Thai place I got to in the East Bay seems second rate by comparison.\n\nAlso, I eat at the bar especially where there is World Cup or NCAA Tournament, so it is a good place to eat solo.

That being said, there are definitely a couple things that have changed for the worse. They have crammed in way too many tables in the space that they have... almost all were occupied, but it really doesn't create a positive dining experience when you are surrounded by other tables within an arm's reach. (A claustrophobic's nightmare!) And you can only imagine how loud it would be! We requested to sit at a table on the side, which was still quite loud, but bearable. In addition, when I dined here previously, they used to carve the outside of the \"pumpkin\" in which they serve the pumpkin curry... it was a nice touch. But it seems they no longer do this...\n\nWe ordered the Bags of Gold and Corn Fritters for appetizers. Both were excellent. The pumpkin curry was delicious as always... one of the best red curries I've ever had, and the pieces of squash are so yummy! Our server recommended it with shrimp, which was a nice change from the usual chicken. The grilled chicken was our least favorite... the flavor was okay, but the chicken itself was dry, and my bf detested the papaya salad it came with even though he generally loves green papaya! Aside from that, our server was very friendly and energetic... no complaints about the service.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy the food here. The atmosphere would be nice if it weren't so cramped... Change that, and Koh Samui would be back to a solid 4 stars.", "author": "Kavita S."}

Popular in Thailand, but rarely found on menus in The City, mieng kum ($8) features an array items--peanuts, roasted coconut, fresh lime, ginger, onion, and fresh chopped Thai chili peppers--that diners wrap in spinach leaves and eat:  the perfect finger food.  \n\nTasty but not exceptional, chicken satay ($5) is served with the de rigueur peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  Piquantly spicy, tom yum kung soup ($6) with prawns and mushroom is redolent of lemongrass and kaffir lime.  Sea bass ($16) simmered in green curry with green beans, bell pepper, fresh basil, and eggplant offered a zippy spice level, while pumpkin curry ($16) with chicken and bell pepper in a red curry sauce was more mild.\n\nService is friendly, and dishes arrived at a pace that was neither too slow, nor too fast, although refilling water or iced tea glasses did not seem a priority.\n\nWhile Thai food seems created to be perfectly paired with beer, Koh Samui and the Monkey has a full bar and reasonable wine list for more adventurous drinkers.\n\nThis is not a cheap date:  prices are more than a bit steep for Thai food.  On the other hand, you get what you pay for.  While Ozone Thai down the street may be less expensive, Koh Samui and the Monkey delivers so much more.  For the thrifty, the deal is a happy hour that can't be beat:  beers are only $2.50 and some food items are less than $5.\n\nFor expensive, but tasty Thai, Koh Samui and the Monkey can't be beat.", "author": "CJ G."}

The beef was perfectly stir fried to have a nice carmalized crust and the mango added a nice refreshing tart bite.  Good balance in terms of both texture and flavor.\n\nThe duck curry was pretty good because they gave us lots of moist duck meat.  Most Thai places will give you lots of skin and bones with their curry dishes.  Not this place.  Good amounts of duck breast.  So you get something for the money.  \n\nCap it off with some spicy string beans and you have a great balanced meal.  \n\nVery happy with the food and the service was promt and enthusiastic so made for a very pleasant experience.  \n\nLooking forward to coming back.", "author": "Scott C."}

Yes, the dishes here are more unique, but eh..\n\nChicken Mieng Kum\nThis Thai snack is full of flavor - chicken, lime, ginger, coconut, peanut, jalapeno, onion all wrapped up with a spinach leave, and topped with some peanut sauce. I would've never imagined to combine all these ingredients together, but they do complement each other very well. I would recommend this to try! \n\nTom Yum Kung Soup\nA little bit too sour for me, but it was okay. Bf really enjoyed this soup, as the prawns inside tasted really fresh! \n\nLarb Gai\nOther than spiciness from the chilies, the chicken was otherwise bland. I felt that it was a little bit too spicy for my taste.. and just underwhelming. Would definitely skip this dish.\n\nKee Mao Pork Sausage\nLimited selection of noodle dishes. This dish was okay, but was a little bit disappointed when it came out because it wasn't the flat rice noodles.. instead it was like squid ink spaghetti.. This dish, too, was a bit too spicy and lacked some flavor of a Kee Mao noodle dish. The pork sausages were okay, but not a fan.\n\nEmerald Curry\nSurprisingly packed a lot of prawns and scallops in that little coconut that was served in. Yes, a little bit too spicy, but it was much more manageable with the sticky rice. \n\nFor two starters, one soup, one noodle, and one entree, it was about $70-80 total. If you were to eat at a regular Thai restaurant, it would've probably costed you $40-50. Luckily, we made reservations through Savored.com, so the meal came out to be $50ish. With gratuity, we walked out the door at about $70. In conclusion, pretty pricey for what it is. Not sure if I'll be returning.. definitely not for a long time.", "author": "Michelle L."}

And I'm not sure he actually washed his hands properly in the process of trying to fix it, because he came out to say he couldn't. \n\nAs for ambiance, it's a bit busy with the decorations, but it gets quite loud, to a level where it was hard to hear one of our dinner companions two seats away from me unless I really leaned forward and strained to listen in. \n\nI'm not sure that I would recommend it, but I wouldn't object if someone suggested going there for lunch (when rice is apparently included with meals).

Its seems quite expensive for spring rolls as it is 3-4 times the price depending on what city you order spring rolls.  \n\nFor my main entree, I ordered the pumpkin curry as people raved about how it was the best pumpkin curry ever.

We were not initially offered this menu and had to ask ... and when we did the waitress suggested that we simply share one $40 set between us.  She suggested that it was plenty of food for two people, and I definitely agree.\n\nWe also got their pumpkin curry ( served in a regular bowl - some times they apparently will serve it in a hollowed out pumpkin ) and a seafood salad called Yam Talay.\n\nFlavors were generally very approachable, though somewhat heavier than we are used to from Thai food.  Nothing was particularly spicy, including dishes that are traditionally *very* spicy.  The papaya salad was the least spicy I've ever had.  What was lost in spice was made up for in strong salt and savory flavors - plenty of fish sauce to go around.\n\nThe pumpkin curry was excellent, though my companion complained that the pumpkin chunks therein were a little large for her taste.\n\nService was generally good and very friendly.\n\nIn the end, there are some good things going on here, and it's a bit more upscale than most Thai places I've been to.

Koh Samui also gets extra props for managing to fit us in for a VD dinner reservation after I brain-farted and had to call the morning of.\n\nBrannon and 3rd Street is definitely a destination for us (we don't find ourselves strolling around this part of the City too often), but it was well worth the extra effort to get here ($10 cab from Financial District).  Unassuming and industrial outside belies the warm, chic, yet comfortable interior.\n\nCheck-in on a busy Valentine's Day evening was quick and painless.  We got a cozy window seat.  The interior is beautifully lit, nice music, oil lamps on tables, and seating not so close as to be eavesdropping on your neighbor's conversations.\n\nThe menu is extensive and is what I'd call Thai fusion.  What it's fused with is hard to tell, but I like the creativity!  We ordered the Fresh Shrimp Spring Rolls and Sirloin Salad as starters.  Six portions of Spring Roll arrived on a porcelain boat with a spicy peanut fish sauce dip.  Cold, crisp, and delicious!  The salad was a good 2-person portion.  Slices of perfectly grilled and seasoned steak atop chunks of iceberg lettuce, red onion, cilantro, with a fish sauce and vinegar dressing.  I could eat a bowl of this.\n\nWe ordered a $28 bottle of La Follette Pinot Noir which paired beautifully.  Light enough to not mask flavors, yet the crisp Pinot fruit came right through.\n\nWe decided to sample a few entrees so ordered the Belly Basil (crisp-skin pork belly slices stir fried with basil and vegetables), Eggplant Tofu (sauteed with bell pepper, fresh basil in chili and garlic sauce), and the Grilled Lamb To Die For (marinated lamb chops served with grilled asparagus and carrots in a white wine & garlic sauce with a side of sticky rice).  We also ordered a side of steamed brown rice and side of coconut rice.\n\nHands down, the lamb chops ruled!  Perfect grilling, slightly gamey taste that worked well against the sweet sticky rice.  The Belly Basil was addictive, spicy, basil-licious, and the portion of pork belly was generous.  Crisp pork skin added a great play of texture against the fatty deliciousness of the belly.  The Eggplant Tofu was good, but perhaps the weakest of the entrees we sampled.  The eggplant was well-cooked (still firm and well-flavored), but it was already only warm by the time it arrived to the table rather than piping hot.\n\nWhile the steamed brown rice was your average steamed rice, the coconut rice was OFF THE HOOK!  I'd go back just for a side of rice!\n\nNeedless to say, we had no room for desserts (and they had already run out of fresh Mango and Sticky Rice).\n\nAll in (apps, dinner, bottle of wine) we racked up a $120 tab (not including tip).  And we tipped well, as the service all around was impeccable.\n\nThis may have been a Valentine's Day destination dinner, but I think Koh Samui & The Monkey is now on our favorite list.  We'll be back often!", "author": "Rick M."}

Why can't I review restaurants in Ketchikan, Alaska? Ketchikanans (I can only assume that's what they're called and hope that it would be pronounced Ketchi-cannons) don't have this problem. \n\nWe visited Koh Samui on our honeymoon so I admit the main reason I picked this place for dinner was the name. I hoped there would be pictures of the island all over the restaurant. Well, that wasn't so much the case. However, we also LOVE elephants, and we were happy to be served on a plate lined with raised elephants. They also sell uber-cute elephant teacups for $8.\n\nGood thing #1\nThere was parking right in front\n\nBad thing #1 \nIt was super noisy. They didn't attempt to soundproof the ceiling. At all. It was so bad that we wanted to linger since we were going to a show, but decided to get to the show early instead.\n\nOkay thing #1\nOur server brought a bottle of sake and claimed that for tonight only that bottle - usually priced at $99 - would be half off. He persuaded us to try a cup, and even though we had no intention of ordering the sake we tried it without feeling like he was giving us the hard sell. The sake was really, really good. And we still didn't order it.\n\nGood thing #2\n-The food was universally very good (at least to me). We started with the Chicken Satay Mieng Kum ($8), which consists of a leaf (spinach?) topped with chopped peanut, roasted coconut, fresh lime, ginger, onion and chili. Each one was a really strongly flavored bite (especially with the lime - I advise you to remove the rind). I really liked it but the husband didn't. Six bites for $8 didn't seem like the best value.\n\n-Entree #1 was the Pumpkin Chicken Curry ($16 - eek!), which is served in a whole pumpkin. This was definitely the best Thai pumpkin dish I've had. It was a little sweet, but definitely still savory with red curry flavors.\n\n-Entree #2 was the Spicy Tofu with zucchini, onion, carrot and fresh basil in chili garlic sauce. The menu lists this item as $9, but it was itemized on our bill (with the name of the dish printed from the computer) as $8. It was just the right amount of spicy, and tasted great. The Pumpkin Curry outshined it, but at any other restaurant this dish would have been the big winner. \n\n-Rice was $2.50 to $3 per person (I don't think I've ever had rice be more than $2 per person). The Coconut Rice was yummy and tasted so good on its own we hated to put food on top of it.\n\nBad thing #2\nThe cost. I've had upscale Thai food before but this was tied with the most expensive I've been to. (The other restaurant is Sirayah in San Carlos but at least they have an excuse. They use organic ingredients and free-range chicken). Lunch sounds like the good deal here. You can get the Pumpkin Curry Chicken with rice for $8. (And since it includes rice so you don't lose $3 either).\n\nGood thing #3\nThe bathrooms are decorated with lost dog and cat notices from around the world.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-01-26", "description": "You've been there before: you work in San Francisco, city of culinary delights, but have grown tired of even the yummy eating establishments around work. And when work is in SOMA, well, let's just say this whole process happens a bit faster.\n\nNow, imagine that you didn't even really like the place to begin with, its food is incredibly mediocre, and you have received consistently incompetent--not bad, but incompetent--service there...but every goddamn person in your office wants to go there for some special occasion. Farewell lunch for someone in the office? We're having it at Koh Samui and the Monkey! Someone's birthday? Let's celebrate at Koh Samui and the Monkey! Long overdue lunch with a coworker who's usually too busy for a lunch out? Well, I'll be damned--Koh Samui and the Monkey for the friggin' win!\n\nWhy, may you ask, does Koh Samui and the Monkey anger the blood so? Picture a large, somewhat uncomfortable gathering with your coworkers (surprise, surprise). Waitress is taking orders, and when she gets to me, I ask her which she personally prefers: some rice and meat dish (I forget which) or their new menu item with cellophane noodles. This was a brief conversation, but a *conversation* nonetheless, over which she communicates that \"they're both good\" and \"if I want rice, I should get the rice place, but if I want noodles, I should get the noodles plate.\" No shit. \n\nI ended up ordering the cellophane noodles dish, while clearly pointing to it on the menu. But though she saw what I was pointing at, I had the sinking feeling that she confused it with some curry dish that started with the same couple words--which, might I add, did. not. contain. cellophane. noodles.\n\nLo and behold, the food starts arriving and someone from the kitchen sloppily delivers a curry plate. I dislike curry. But, that's beside the point, because that is not what I ordered. They send it back, but instead of making my order a priority to remedy their bad, I know it went to the bottom of the pile--because my order arrives when our party of 11 is just finishing up. \n\nTo add insult to injury, what arrives is, again, not what I ordered. What happened to the cellophane noodles in a light sauce with yummy salmon and shiitake mushrooms (all inherently delicious ingredients), as was promised by one of the most expensive items on the menu? Instead, the noodles were just swimming in a heavy but somehow texture-less sauce, there's very little salmon, and instead of shiitake mushrooms, there's all that Chinese mixed veggie shit, like once-frozen baby corn cobs, peas, water chestnuts, and broccoli--which are fine in other contexts, but obviously not apart of this dish's original conception, and, again, not what I was promised.\n\nI gesture to wrap it to-go, so everyone doesn't have to wait, but they insist I eat. Noodles are awkward to eat as is, but when you're scarfing extra saucy ones down while 10 of your coworkers are watching you and also waiting for you to finish--it's kind of mortifying. \n\nThe food itself was mediocre. Alas, something I was promised.\n\nThe worst part, really, is that the waitress did not even apologize, and because we were a large party, she was awarded a fairly high tip for remarkably sub-par service.\n\nI have a theory that their service is so awful because the restaurant has stringent requirements for its waitstaff that are totally irrelevant to waitressing competence: i.e., must be able to fit into an XS, off-the-shoulder dress. This, my friends, would explain a lot.", "author": "Anna L."}

I suppose it's on par with Osha Thai, but I think that place is a pricey as well, and i feel like it has the same kind of flavors and atmosphere--definitely more of a hip vibe than your usual thai spots. \n\nWe started with the calamari appetizer and the dumplings--both were not what i was expecting.  Neither were bad, but i don't know that i would order either again.  I thought the calamari was a little bit tough. \n\nFor the main courses, we had the pumpkin curry, the scallops and the green beans plus rice.  \n\nThe pumpkin curry was excellent.  No complaints there--plus it is presented in the actual pumpkin so that was a nice touch.  \n\nThe scallops were breaded which was ok, but the breading was too heavy for the scallop and kept falling off.  That was fine since I didn't feel they needed it.  The scallop was flavorful enough on its own with the sauce.  \n\nlastly, the spicy green beens were ok, not my favorite, and I have had better versions at other places.\n\nI am sure I would end up going back there, but if I do, I am hoping someone else is going to foot the bill.", "author": "Lu E."}

The time between bringing out the first plate and the last plate was at least 15 mins. This meant that the first served meals were nearly done whilst the latter served meals were just getting started. \nAs if to add insult to injury they didn't even serve you properly - they just put the dish at one end of the table and you had to pass it down to the correct person?! Odd. Never been to a place like that before.\n\nThe food itself was fairly good IMO. I had the Asian beef which was cooled to order perfectly. It tasted great with the pineapple salad and sticky rice.\nMy wife ordered the pumpkin curry which was supposed to come in a pumpkin but didn't?! It was also a good curry.\nI'm not sure whether everyone enjoyed their dish...the grilled catfish looked good and our friend finished that off impressively.\n\nFor some reason, the wait staff kept dropping things - plates, forks, glasses.", "author": "Nick L."}

The sea bass was moist, non-fishy tasting, and was snuggled beautifully amongst string beans, mushrooms, and thin noodles. The portion of fish was impressive considering the price. The spicy noodles were also delicious. There was a plethora of vegetables, and the spiciness and slight grease of the noodles complimented the sweet coconut rice and buttery sea bass perfectly.\n\nI'm definitely keeping this place in mind for future spontaneous dates with my bf in the future.

We're talking what tastes the like the sweet and source sauce you can get at 99 ranch.  The fish wasn't fully cooked all the way in too (probably because of cooking style - smoking might not get it cooked inside all the way w/o overcooking the edges).  Either way you know catfish is still raw when the meat doesn't break apart easily and is chewy.  \n\nFried Chicken in Fried Rice: this is normal panko chicken.  Thai fried rice, when done well, is very fragrant - I think it comes from the heat of the pan and stove as well as oil and onions.  This fried rice was just meh.

Atmosphere is a nice woodsy Thai/Indonesian theme, it's dimly lit, cozy, and romantic; my boyfriend and I had our first date here.  I've been here several times and have never been let down, everything is wonderfully flavored and cooked really well.  I read a review where someone complained about the lack of spice, this has never been the case for me; if I ask for it spicy, it comes out spicy.  I've never had an issue with the service, they've always been prompt with the food and check, and they check in mid-meal.\n\nOn to the food and drink:\n\nAromatic Pumpkin Curry:  O M Gosh, this is one of my favorite dishes ever.  This curry is so flavorful, and the pumpkin pieces are cooked to perfection: not too hard, not too soggy.  The curry comes in a hollowed out green squash, nice touch.  I've had OSHA's version of this and it doesn't even compare, Koh Samui owns this dish.\n\nThe Lychee Politan... this cocktail is a must.  Koh Samui has a great happy hour, cocktail and appetizer specials, plus $2.50 for beer.  There is always a good amount of people at the bar and their cocktails are really tasty.  The Monkey is Paris is my second favorite, and Shock the Monkey is great too.\n\nTIP:  If you follow them on Twitter @kohsamuimonkey you will see their tweets for \"Flip Night.\"   On flip nights, you can play heads or tails with the bartender to bet over whether you pay for your drink or not.

This restaurant and its sister places (Another Monkey as well as, way back when, Citizen Thai) have always gotten my vote as the best Thai food in San Francisco. But ...\n\nThe service was really bad in many ways.  It was a real disappointment because, based on past experiences, I expected much better.  For now, I would stick to Another Monkey as I've only ever had perfectly fine service there.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\n1.  We requested a reservation through their web site and never got a confirmation back.  Sure enough, when we got there, they had no record of our reservation.  Fortunately, the place was not too busy and we were able to be seated right away.\n\n2.  Within seconds (literally) of us sitting down and cracking open our menus, the waitress appeared and asked if we were ready to order!  Naturally, we said we needed a minute.  We got that minute and about 20 more -- even then, the server only came back when I asked someone else to fetch her.  Also, she hadn't even asked if we wanted a drink while we were deciding (I don't really care about that but it is standard practice usually).  \n\n3.  When I ordered, I specifically said which 2 dishes we wanted to come first and which 2 dishes we wanted to come in a second round.  But all 4 came at the same time -- there wasn't even enough room on our table to fit them!\n\n4.  It was another long wait after we finished before we again had to ask another staffer to fetch our server with the check.\n\nI can forgive any one of these things in isolation but, coming all together in one meal (and, remember, the place wasn't even particularly busy, so that's not a factor),  the pattern seems to indicate a systematic problem.", "author": "pablo p."}

This was served in an actual pumpkin (pretty large one, too!)\n- Sesame Crusted Scallops: my friend said this was good - scallops weren't that big, but it was tasty and served with bok choy.\n\nService: In general it wasn't bad, though there was a semi-awkward moment when the waitress came and tried to take my friend's plate away but there were clearly some more scallops and she wasn't finished eating...\n\nHopefully my tummy feels better...but I won't write of Koh Samui just yet", "author": "Alvina W."}

Tofu Meing Kom, very fresh, nice flavorful ginger, only thing missing for me were the diced thai chillies, but I can understand, this is San Francisco and even though we think we are \"hip\" we can't really stand the heat.  My Emerald Curry ( Keang Keow Wan Talay) was exquisite. I asked for it Thai spicy and didn't get it quite as hot as I wanted it, but it was hot enough and very good.  My friends ordered the Sea Bass Clay pot, and a spicy pork Belly dish. All cooked to perfection and very tasty. We had two really nice upscale  glasses of sake and a \"Monkey in Paris\".

However, post-dining experience, I have severe mixed emotions about the place!\n\nThe food was fantastic....no denying it. My fav Thai food in SF is probably Osha, but this was hands down delicious. To start with, we ordered the chicken satay, which was slightly overcooked but the flavor was still good. For the main course, we ordered the tofu pad thai, asian beef, and the southern kur king (spicy ground chicken). We also ordered the spicy tofu, which NEVER SHOWED UP (and I forgot to check whether they billed us for it, because I had one too many glasses of wine at that point). Anyway, the food that did show up was fantastic. When they mean spicy, they mean spicy, so beware.\n\nIn terms of ambiance, I was slightly disappointed upon first walking in. The shades were all pulled up, he light was pouring in, and the not-so-attractive scenery of Brannan St. was quite visible. Basically, it was nothing like the pictures on the website, and not why I chose this restaurant. In addition, the AC was cranked on, so it was FREEZING like an ice box (we politely asked them to turn down the air, and they complied). Oh, and this was at around 6pm. However, after the sun finally set, the interior ambiance started to show up in dark wood, dim lighting, and asian decor. It turned out to be very trendy and romantic.\n\nMY MAIN GRIPE: We went here for a birthday occasion, so upon making the dinner reservation via OpenTable.com, I indicated in the notes section that this was a special birthday dinner. Having completely forgotten about that note, I was completely shocked when they brought over a nice little plate of chocolate cake with coconut ice cream and a happy birthday serenade. It was very sweet! The cake was actually delicious (and I normally don't like cake), and the coconut ice cream complimented it quite well. We didn't have to go to our next spot for dessert. HOWEVER, and here it is...I got the bill, and they charged us a whole $9 for the cake!! WTF?? Who does that? First of all, birthday dessert is normally complimentary at restaurants, and when it's not, they specify....not just randomly bring something out to your table and then BILL you for it!? Especially on a tab that was already $80?? NOT COOL. Management needs to get its act together. Two stars for that shadyness.\n\nI'm uncertain whether I'll be back at this point...", "author": "Mansi A."}

Two dishes that seriously disappointed me Southern Curry w/ Beef Stew and the Pork Belly with Basil.  Both are fattier types of meat if cooked the right way, but Koh Samui did it all wrong.  The beef stew was tough, dry and overcooked to the texture of liver, not what I was expecting.  Not to mention the curry was presented on a plate with a spoon, which I don't get how I am supposed to scoop it up and serve it with rice.  The pork belly was overfried, so I had a hard time chewing it.  I have to say that the waitress was very nice as we showed her the beef stew was close to inedible and she took it back and switched to some other dish for us.\n\nService is very slow.  We waited for about 10 minutes before someone came by to take our order and we had to ask for water.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice.

I have actually saved the sauce, purchased some vegis and had another meal ... but it is not what I was paying for!\n\nThe pad thai was awful. It tasted off/old. The noodles were overcooked and because they are rice noodles, it ended up in just a bloob. There were also huge pieces of crispy,almost burnt egg.

The issue was in how long it took us to order and how the food came out.\n\nEach person was basically getting their own plate, and it should have been obvious because each person ordered a single plate. So when they brought out the salad my friend ordered first it was a weird mistake for a decent restaurant to make (you serve everyone their main course at the same time).  If you want to get a salad for yourself while your friends eat, you need to be extra specific about when it comes out because they just assume that everything will be split regardless.\n\nAfter that, no food came out for about 30 minutes. It was rather inconvenient. The drinks were also quite slow to come out, both because it was hard to get the attention of someone to order it, they sometimes forgot the order and the general process was also a bit slow. \n\nIt looks like they had too few waitresses for such a busy night and the side effect was bad service. I hope they fix this, because I like the food and the drinks there otherwise but it isn't worth going out and spending money is the restaurant isn't getting orders to people in a reasonable amount of time.", "author": "Jeff L."}

He seemed shy, so I didn't catch his name, he was a blonde kid, but I really respected that he wasn't all up in interrupting us so that he could take our orders and stuff.  I really dislike super aggressive waiters who interrupt you and get all up in your business when you're just trying to enjoy your friends.

The service was great, ambiance is excellent and the lost dog posters in the bathroom are really weird, but unique & interesting  :)  I definitely recommend this place, one of the best in SOMA.\n\nHad to reduce this to 4 stars because the next 2 times I went here the services was SOOOOOOO slow!", "author": "Amy P."}

We had all gotten very excited by the HH menu--not only did the food look pretty good, but it was also decently priced compared to the overpriced items on their regular menu. When we got to the restaurant, we were informed that we could only order Happy Hour at the bar. We asked if we could all get drinks at the bar first, and then bring it to our table--she said no, we could only drink at the bar for HH. OK, so then we asked if we could get drinks at the bar, drink them at the bar, pay for them, and then move over to the table for dinner--she said no. \n\nWe finally decided to just sit at the table since there wasn't even room for us at the bar. I handed her my opentable coupon and ordered:\n1) Fire Cracker: seafood Sizzling hot plate of prawns, squid, scallop, crab claw and spicy peanut sauce\n- This dish was very very good and had a lot of flavor.\n\n2) Aromatic Pumpkin Curry* chicken, bell pepper in red curry sauce served in pumpkin\n- This dish looks small, but there is a lot of curry in this pumpkin.

The show was at 8 and we arrived at the restaurant at 7. Even though it was a Wednesday night, the place was pretty full. We told them right up front that we had a show and that we would need to be out of there by 7:45. While waiting to be seated, we took a look at the menu and figured out what we wanted to order. We were seated and ordered by 7:15. All of the food was out within the next 10 mins--a total of 5 dishes which i'll get to in a second--and we were done right on time. The waiters were very attentive and friendly, and they got us in and out right in time, I really appreciated that.\n\nNow back to the food:\n\nLarb Gai-excellent. Larb is a salad of sorts, which is mainly composed of a meat (or tofu), onion, cilantro, lime, fish sauce, and chili. They do it very well here and it's served in a bell pepper. We also ordered the green papaya salad. Not much to say here, other than it was fresh and tasty.\n\nDuck---something, i can't exactly remember what, but it was served with a soy based sauce and spinach and it was amazing--succulent, succulent duck. Unfortunately it was kinda skmipy.\n\nPad Thai- again, not much to say here, it's pad thai. I didn't order this one. I never order pad thai. We actually had a discussion about this before ordering, one of the other people said that pad thai is the best way to tell if the thai restaurant is any good...a barometer of sorts to gauge the place. I personally disagree, i feel like pad thai is like ordering refried beans at a Mexican restaurant, it doesn't really tell you anything. The curries are where it's at! to me pad thai is a waste of a dish, but some people like to stick with what they know, what are you going to do?\n\nSouthern Curry. Beef panang curry. So amazingly good, it was a great blend of sweet and spicy and it was a thick curry sauce--it really stuck to the meat and rice and added a lot of flavor. THAT was the gauge for me and it was really good.\n\nThe ambiance here is nice too, it was actually kind of a bummer that we were in a rush, because it would have been nice to hang out for a while. \n\nSo for the food, the ambiance, and especially the service, 5 stars for me. I would definitely come back.", "author": "Daniel G."}

It was Saturday night (7pm) and we did not have a reservation but they were able to seat us almost right away. The place is always clean and the decor is nice. The service has consistently been fast and friendly.\n\nFor the appetizers we ordered the vegetarian samosas and chicken & beef satay.  My only wish is that they brought more. There wasn't enough for us to each have one samosa so we had to share. \n\nFor the main course I ordered the Spicy Tofu with extra wide rice noodles (which are my favorite). It was not as spicy as it could have been but it was very good. I have had trouble finding the extra wide rice noodles at other Thai restaurants and so The Monkey gets a star for having them!\n\nThe rest of the guests ordered a variety of dishes with a general consensus: good. \n\nIf you are looking for a good lunch this is the place, if you are looking for an amazing dinner you might be setting the bar too high for The Monkey.", "author": "Tuesday C."}

I can't deny liking the food here, but I do have a fair number of complaints:\n\n1) The dishes are expensive. You can often compare restaurants by a standard dish; in this case, Pad Thai with chicken. It costs $12 here, while other places often have it for around $7 but definitely less than $10. Also, there were not many noodles at all. Additionally, they charge for rice no matter what you order; other places often serve rice with a curry dish, but not this place.\n\n2) The service wasn't very good. We went after 9pm one night when the place was relatively empty. Our waitress rarely swung by after she took our order. In fact, we had to ask for chopsticks and order another serving of rice through the bus boy.\n\n3) It's hard to believe that this place doesn't have the standard Chicken Yellow Curry, a fairly standard dish at other Thai places. I can understand if they want to be unique, but you can do that while still offering popular dishes that many like. That being said, I highly recommend the Aromatic Pumpkin Curry (chicken, bell pepper in red curry sauce served in pumpkin).\n\nAgain, the food is tasty but also expensive and the service isn't very good/attentive.", "author": "John C."}

I had been to this restaurant once before and thought it was pretty good then.  The New Years Eve dinner though blew the previous experience away.\n\nThe pre-set dinner was normally $60 per person, but since my friends and I did the vegetarian option, we only had to pay $50 each.\n\nThe drink that we all got was the Apricot Monkey.  That drink itself was $14 on the menu, so we were happy about that.  It was an exceptional drink as well.  It was a tad sweet but good.\n\nThe surprise of the night was the appetizer.  Since there were three of us, we got the perfect amount for everyone to have a taste of everything.  It included the samosas, stay tofu, fried tofu, corn cake, spring rolls, and mango salad.  Even if most of it was fried, it was amazing.  I am Thai and thought it was an exceptional presentation as well as good tasting.  I loved the samosas and the spring rolls.\n\nWe than got soup which was tom kha vegetables with tofu.  It was really creamy and strong in flavor.  I didn't like it too much, but it wasn't bad.  Definitely would have been better to eat with rice than as a opening soup dish.\n\nThe dishes we got were spicy tofu, pad Thai tofu, and pumpkin curry.  My favorite one was the pad thai.  It wasn't as moist as other pad Thais I've had before, but it was flavorful enough and not too sweet which equates good!  The spicy tofu was my second favorite.  It was great with the brown rice... yes they gave us brown rice, another plus.  The pumpkin curry wasn't bad but could have had more pumpkin (not that we couldn't scrape off pumpkin from the pumpkin bowl it came in).\n\nAnd finally we had desert: Two banana thing and one chocolate cake.  The chocolate cake gave me some strange spasm, so I was somehow allergic to it or something.  I didn't eat it after the first two bites.  The banana thing was okay.  I was full anyway, so I didn't mind the desert not being better than I want it to be.  It all also came with a mango ice cream.\n\nSo based on my review, it should be about 3.5 stars right?  Here's the other good thing about dinner, the service.  Our waitress was awesome!  If it wasn't her coming to ask how everything was, there were others always filling our waters and taking empty plates.  Exceptional!  And we also ended up getting a wine as a gift for being there.  All in all, everything we had eaten and got was probably worth more than the $50 price tag.  I will definitely be coming back here again to get a meal without desert.", "author": "Andrew N."}

The pad thai is drenched in too much sauce and doesn't taste as good as the one at Basil Thai.

It's also fairly quick, so we were able to fit in dinner here in under 1.5 hours on a Saturday night.\n\nThe assorted appetizer tray is a must if you're at a table of at least 3 or 4 people. It's mostly little pieces of fried food, but it's so tasty! The ingredients all taste really fresh, too.\n\nMy favorite dish is the peanut tofu. The peanut sauce is a bit overwhelming, though, and the dish comes off much more creamy than it is spicy. So I don't think it's the perfect execution of the dish, but I still appreciate the attentive service (hey, I get thirsty while eating, don't you?) and the good variety of food.\n\nOne oddity: they always have sort of dance music playing in the background, and the TV is showing something like sports games.

As it is, this place very nearly ruined Valentine's Day for us.\n\nWe'd taken care to get our reservation in for Valentine's Day weeks before. They called to confirm, we had the confirmation email. What happens when we get there? We get told our reservation is not on the list at all, and they refused to seat us to boot - we had to dig out the email on my bf's phone for them to even give us a table.\n\nThe hostess then apologizes profusely and hastily gives us the tiny table along the aisle between the wall and the bar stools. Which turns out to be extremely drafty, and since I was dressed for the evening out I was shivering with cold and nearly got sick by the time the night was over.\n\nI'm not the sort to be turned off a good meal by cold, bad/rude service or crappy decor. But I've eaten better at holes-in-the-wall and this time the mixup with the reservations could not be saved by the food. My Royal Curry with the red curry sauce option was horribly undercooked and I was so hungry by the time the food arrived that I just ate it anyway. The vegetables (carrots, etc) were hard, tofu in it was bland. The only good thing about the curry was the sauce, which kind of tasted like it simply had been poured on. My bf's pumpkin curry was better and tasted like it had been properly stewed a while, but for $16 a portion, I'm expecting a great curry, and not merely a small portion of decent curry I could cook at home. Since we had gotten a Bloomspot deal I decided to have a pumpkin curry without the chicken. Which cued a repeat performance of blah-ness, though since squash is so easy to cook, it was soft enough for me.  The curry sauce did not fare so well and tasted hastily slapped on yet again.\n\nWe probably should have demanded they take back the Royal curry and complained about our reservation, but BF and I aren't the types to make a scene. If you are a curry enthusiast, and/or wanting to take no chances on impressing on special dinner date, this is a place best left unvisited.\n\nEdit: To the poster who called me an idiot - Oh sure, because other people have lives (including myself) to the extent they're busy on Valentine's Day and go to a restaurant post-work or college totally invalidates their previous review that the food sucked. I know what good curry tastes like and if you got offended that I slammed your favorite haunt, sorry, but it doesn't work that way. I say to you - I have standards when I eat, and I wouldn't have chosen this place, V-day or no, if I'd known the food and service was this bad. Had the restaurant cared about its customers they would have saved us a table in the main dining area, as well. My opinion still stands.", "author": "Kit A."}

We ordered the fresh spring rolls, pumpkin curry and mango beef. They were are great. The service was also excellent. \n\nMy main complaint (the reason for the 3 stars) are the prices. We each ordered a side of rice with our meal. The sides of rice were $3 each ($9 total). Most Thai restaurants give you a huge pot of rice for the table, for about $1.50. Also, my friend ordered a side of steamed vegetables to mix in with her food, and that was $4.50 for a few pieces of broccoli and baby corn.  \n\nI can see myself going back, since I live so close by.

The service was weak...I sat for quite some time at the bar with no one around, finally walked over and found a menu at the front (no one there either), and went back to the bar.  Not much of a greeting when the bartender came back, no smile, just took the order.  Had to ask for silverware and napkin after food arrived, and for soy sauce and chili paste, which came in separate small open bowls on a plate.  I noticed later that they gave the same little plate with bowls to another party at the bar, which didn't seem very sanitary to me. \n\nThe food was weak.  I ordered fresh rolls, which came with nice size shrimp but overall lacked flavor and didn't taste fresh...the sort of roll that I would expect in a grocery store deli.  The peanut sauce was odd, ingredients had separated, not the usual consistency I typically see in peanut dipping sauces.  For the main course, I got cashew chicken.  The chicken was twice cooked, probably deep fried once then sauteed with the rest of the ingredients.  The result was chicken that was chewy and tasted overcooked, the sauce didn't penetrate...not a good dish.  It came with white rice.\n\nFor that, and iced tea, the bill came to almost $24 plus tip....not a cheap lunch by any means, and given the quality of the two dishes I had, I wouldn't recommend this place.  In fairness, though, the place was crowded, so they must be doing something right...they missed with me though.", "author": "Rob C."}

I don't care if it's Westwood and the campus of UCLA or the slummiest ghetto ever.\n\nMonday was my birthday and the sun was shining. Which meant that my birthday dinner at Koh Samui and the experience was better than would have been otherwise. \n\nThe food here is good. That's the plus side. Corn fritters, beef and chicken satay, imperial rolls, and veggie samosas started us off and all were delicious - especially the fritters. Each came with a nice sweet sauce loaded with cucumbers and carrots. Yum. For main courses, we split the koh tao (like a chinese chow fun with gravy), honey duck (soooo tender and slightly sweet), mango salad, pumpkin curry, and my personal fave, the soft shell crab (steeped in garlic and salt and soooooo wonderful over rice - it also came with a creamy chili sauce which accompanied the rice with a light spice and a terrific flavor). The mango mojito I had was also yummy.\n\nThe reason why this place isn't 5 stars is the service and the entryway. The elevation of this place is seemingly pointless as the navigation from the wheelchair ramp is cramped. And the service. Oy. \n\nDo Thai restaurants have a requirement where their servers all have to be stereotypically thick accented Thai people? Also it took like 15 minutes for two cocktails. And I saw the waitress just shooting the shit with another server. Another mild annoyance was she asked how we were doing after half of each dish. Dude. Serve and check in with us in about a half hour...like every 5 minutes!\n\nAll in all I would come back here again. I just hope they recognize the deficiencies are NOT in the food. Keep up the AMAZING soft shell crab.", "author": "Aaron F."}

They come looking like a Jenga game, stacked on top of each other.  It looks like you're getting a lot, but in reality, because they slice the rolls in half before stacking them, you get 3 full rolls, and then the tower is topped with three rolls of basically fried carrot.  All of it delicious.\n\nWe shared a yummy curry beef stew and grilled BBQ chicken.  We also ordered coconut rice (dinky bowl for $3, really?), and Pad Thai as well.  Everything was really good.  The pad thai, while delicious, was the smallest portion.  Basically, it would give three people a small serving.  \n\nThe only bad thing was that from the time our 'take home bag' was packed and sitting on our table, it took about 15 minutes to get the bill, pay for it, and get our credit card back.  It's like we were done with our meal and they forgot about us.", "author": "Denise M."}

So many different types of vegetables, spices and offerings- it's hard to go wrong.  Love the Mieng Kum-- a great starter for any meal. Love that the pumpkin curry is served in an actual pumpkin.  Everything is appropriately spicy (a definite plus) and I'm always impressed by the ingredients and presentation of all of their dishes. There is such a wide variety of options, it's a new experience every time I go.\n\nHad dinner with a group of 6 last night, and my only complaint was that they waited way too long to bring out the courses. I think they were attempting to be formal about the servings (appetizers followed by salads followed by entrees) but that ended up taking way too long and then we had too much food being served at the end. It was a bit frustrating especially when everyone was pretty hungry. But the service was very friendly, so we probably could have specifically asked for food to come out quicker.\n\nLove the monkey.", "author": "Sonia S."}

Ordering took forever. The coke that they gave one of the guests at my table was out of syrup and it was hard to get my busy waitresses attention to switch it out. I don't even think she came by our table once to check up on us and ask us if we needed anything the entire dinner. \n\nAt the end of the meal she asked us if we wanted dessert. Me not wanting to wait any longer I said no. You would think common sense would be to bring the bill but she kept serving other tables, bringing their orders and taking orders. She could've at least dropped the bill to us before doing all of that. Service was definitely thumbs down. If you insist in eating here because you work or live around the neighborhood... I suggest you give yourself a significant amount of time.\n\nAnd if you want suggestions on the food... I would see the sea bass in green curry was not bad.

Go here for an elegant meal at reasonable prices with consistently great food!\n\nLunch - Despite the upscale appearance, Koh Samui is a really great lunch choice.  Meals range between $7-14/person and they turn around the tables quickly.  Despite the appearance of a line, the wait is usually pretty short and the service is quick.  I'm a huge fan of the Larb Gai --mmmmmmmm meat salad!  Hell, the burger stand down the street runs $14 for a burger and fries.  Why not indulge in something far more elegant?\n\nBar - Creative cocktails and a rather comprehensive wine list --standard pricing.\n\nDinner - Koh Samui's pumpkin curry is a San Francisco dish not to be missed.  I'd put it almost on par with a plate of spaghetti from Emmy's.  Dinner for two with cocktails and an appetizer runs about $70.  Service is usually good but I've had to work to flag down wait staff a few times.\n\nAnd what's up with the bathroom?  The bathrooms at Koh Samui are filled with photos of lost pets from all over the world, and each has a Sharpie inscription, \"Belongs to Koh Saumi\".  It's a little creepy.  I wondered if there was some Thai legend about some character named Koh Samui who cared for lost pets.  I finally asked the staff.

Sadly, we spent a small fortune on a meal that consisted of sub par Thai dishes and horrible service.\n\nOur first mistake was ordering two overpriced cocktails that both tasted like Robitussin. Our second mistake was ordering the expensive appetizer sampler for two.

I don't like seafood, I don't like food I can't pronounce, and I usually don't like more than two flavors competing for my attention at once.  So, getting me to try ethnic food is usually an exercise in futility.

To me, it's either the \"Thai Restaurant\", or the \"Monkey Thai Place\", or more recently \"Kofi Annan & The Monkey\" (which sounds like a great children's show).  Apparently there's another Thai restaurant in the area called Citizen Thai & The Monkey, which I think means either a) they're owned by the same people b) adding \"the Monkey\" to your name means good luck in Thailand, or c) there's a lawsuit on it's way.\r\n\r\nThe decor of the restaurant is authentic looking (at least from what I remember in my dreams of Thailand) and serene (minus the prerequisite flat screen TV at the bar).  It feels a bit crowded at times and your ass will hurt from their chairs if you're there too long, but overall the dining experience is a pleasant one.  The drinks are pretty strong and you get a nice, plastic monkey with most of them that you can play with while you wait for your date to return from the bathroom.  \r\n\r\nFor dinner I went with the American staple of getting Pad Thai along with their Pumpkin Soup.  The soup was up first and I have to say I was a little disappointed by it.  I'm a HUGE pumpkin fan and will generally eat anything made from it, but this soup was perhaps a little too authentic for me.  Not that I was expecting a mashed up pumpkin pie served in a Green Goblin pumpkin bomb bowl (but, yeah, how cool would THAT be?), but it left me wanting something a bit sweeter.  \r\n\r\nThe Pad Thai, though, was excellent!  A generous serving and just as good in leftover form the next day.  I have since ordered carryout from here and found the quality of the food to be great.

Best part is that happy hour lasts till 7 instead of the standard 6:30. \n\nOrginial lunch review:\nSeems to be the only Thai place in the area, and when I walked in, I was impressed. However, I was quickly frustrated by the awkward heavy chairs, and the pricey lunch menu.\n\nBut then I got the fresh roll appetizer and was really impressed. Fresh rolls are great in theory but rarely live up to my expectations. These did. The duck curry was standard. The duck meat was good, but there was too much fat and skin to pick through. But then the Pad Thai showed up, and I was appalled. It was tomatoey and completely unacceptable. The only reason this place gets three stars and not two is that I loved the fresh rolls.", "author": "Lauren H."}

All the dishes were good and pretty much what I expected.  The soup came as a serving for one??  That was odd.  I have never been to a Thai place and received a cup of soup.  Its always a big ass bowl that can be shared.\n\nThe space is nice enough too.  The decor is kinda modern crammed into an old building with lots of Asian stuff tossed in.  It was comfortable.  They did have really pretty plates, white linens, real chop sticks and cloth napkins.  That goes far with me.  As did the big bowl of flowers floating in water at the door.\n\nThe service was interesting though.  We were kind of left sitting and reading the wine list for a long long time.  It was a good wine list, but we wanted to drink it not read about it.  When someone did approach us she asked if we are ready, we said yes.  She left.  What??  We are ready!

When he asked for the tofu it was brought cold.  Refrigerator cold.

I love it so much that for days after I eat it I have dreams of it's coconutty goodness and visions of the carved decorations on the green pumpkin in which it's served dance in my head.

So today I went for my usual and was extra hungry so got the stuffed mushrooms.  My expectations were $8.95 for the fried rice just like I have paid 3 dozen other times and stuffed mushrooms (published on their website for $4).  \n\nSo by default every retaurant I eat at gets 5 stars by default.  For every fuck up, I take a star (just like episode of Seinfeld).\n\nF*ck Up #1\nThey charge me $20 for the two items.  Well that doesn't add up.  $8.95 + $4 is only $13.  Not a big deal but I inquire anyhow.  Apparently the friend rice now is now $12 (33% increase) and the stuffed mushrooms are $6, not the $4 as advertised.  The hostess said that the prices just changed.  Technically, that's false advertisement, but ok I'll let that slide.  Shit, I have a restaurant too and I know prices are going up across the board and they need to survive.  I'm hungry.  $20.  No big deal.  Nonetheless, -1 star.\n\nF*ck Up #2\nSo when I got there the hostess said they were packaging it up.  So I waited and waited and waited.  15 minutes passed.  Then the hostess informed me that they gave my meal to someone else and it would be another few minutes.  Grrrrrr.  I was understanding but still a little peeved and i'm pissy when hungry.  She was nice enough to order me a complimentary cocktail but all I could think about was my CHICKEN FRIED RICE!  Nonetheless, -1 star for not getting a simple pick up order right.\n\nF*ck Up #3\nSo I got my food.  I get to my boy's place and ready to devour the food and there are peanuts in my fried rice.  I have been to every city in the asian continent and not one of them has ever put PEANUTS in my fried rice.  WTF?  Are you kidding me?  You mind as well put M&Ms in my fried rice!  This place has truly been bastardized.  No wonder there were no Asians eating up in there!  But that's fine.  I just patiently picked it out one by one and continued to chomp.  Nonetheless, -1 star for putting peanuts in a dish that should NEVER have peanuts.\n\nF*ck Up #4\nStuffed mushrooms were basically mushrooms stuffed with some weak ass meat filling, wrapped in some dough and deep fried with the funnel cake batter.  $9 for 4 of these mofos?  But that's ok.  I was hungry and continued to scarf it down until i got to the last stuffed mushroom which was SOUR and uncooked.  As hungry as I was, I spit it out and that was the end of my meal and it was insult after insult after injury.  Minus 1 star for almost food poisoning me!\n\nKSM is a great place if you have never had Thai food...ever.

Here's why:\n\n1) Atmosphere: at Koh Samui, they've taken SOMA warehouse/office building and turned it into a lush, bubbling fountain, Giant Buddha kind of place, but without being tacky.  The decor doesn't overwhelm nor underwhelm: it just fits.  The end result is when you go to Koh Samui, you feel like you're doing something a little special, but without paying \"special\" prices.\n\n2) Presentation: The Fresh Spring Rolls (with shrimp, mint leaf and noodle) come out in a little dish that reminds you of a boat, with an umbrella that suggests a long lazy float down a river.  The pumpkin curry (chicken with red curry sauce served in pumpkin) is served in an actual green pumpkin.  Bags of Gold (minced chicken, shrimps wrapped in rice paper sacks) look, indeed, like bags of gold.  Even the dish I get most often, the \"Tofu with peanut sauce topped with crispy basil\" looks like someone thought about where they would ladle the sauce, not the standard mashup of ingredients you find elsewhere.\n\nWine List: A Pinot Noir from Central Otago. A Spanish Tempranillo. A lovely Chilean Reisling.  These are not your average Thai restaurant wines.\n\nFood: I think about the Tofu with peanut sauce when I am away.  Plus a plethora of rice choices: white, brown, jasmine or COCONUT!\n\nIt is these small things that really set Koh Samui apart from all the other wonderful, but predictable, Thai places in the City.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

Inexpensive share plates, but none of that small plates crap. You got a few apps, everyone can pick an entree and let the fun begin.

I already sort of had a bad taste in my mouth about the place as I had bought a Groupon deal for this place back in the summer when we were looking to move to SF and specifically looking at places in this area. Unfortunately it took us until May to find the right place so as the expiration date approached for the voucher to be used by, I called them to see if it could be extended. They were rather rude about it and said no. I understand they can't make exceptions but for someone who lives a block from this place and would potentially be back over and over if it had been a good experience, it's too bad they couldn't help.\n\nSo anyway, gave them one more chance and while it was okay, I really wasn't impressed. The service and the food was a bit slow, we ordered 2 apps and they took a while, coming out at separate times, then still a wait for our mains. i was disappointed by the apps, while they tasted okay, they looked like they were out of a box, everything was perfectly uniform that it didn't look homemade at all.\n\nThe curry that arrived in a pumpkin or squash was pretty good - I asked for it spicy and it had a nice kick, but wasn't too much. I don't blame them, typically at these places they don't spice it up as much as I like. It took us a while to flag a waiter down to bring us some of the hot chili sauce.

And if they want more stars from me, all they have to do is kick the quality of their food up a notch and give the service a bit more urgency.  At that point, food, service and atmosphere will catch up to the price.", "author": "Arvey S."}

We arrived at around 6:30pm and the restaurant was pretty sparse, but by the time we left at 8ish it was already quite full.  That's a good sign I suppose.  \n\nNow onto the food: we ordered the following dishes and shared family style:\n- Whole Snapper (fried and coated in a sweet sauce, it wasn't bad but the fish did not taste especially fresh)\n- Crunchy Tofu (with \\spinach and mushrooms covered in a thick peanut sauce - this one kind of sucked)\n- Belly Basil (pork belly with basil and bell peppers, portion was very small and the pork belly was tough and greasy)\n- Chicken Pad Thai  (how can you go wrong with pad thai at a thai restsaurant? this one unfortunately was pretty dry and bland)\n- Duck Curry (with pineaples, again, portion is tiny with a couple meager pieces of duck floating around)\n- Tom Kha Gai soup (more sour than it should be, and not at all spicy or flavorful)\n\nThe thai iced tea tasted a bit watered down.\n\nOverall, the food was very underwhelming. As much as I hate to say it, you should just go to Osha instead.  And if you don't care about service or atmosphere, go to King of Thai.", "author": "Nancy J."}

Go to Grand Pu Bah on Berry & Division instead (just 4 long blocks south of this place) - similar prices, better food, better service, similar ambiance.\n\nLong version:\n\nYou know you're in trouble when there's a line out the door to get in, even when two people are behind the counter:  one who is jabbering to a customer, and the other who is ignoring the people waiting to be seated.  5 minutes to have someone seat you - and there were plenty of open tables.\n\nThis place puts emphasis on style/presentation and none on actual food prep.  For entrees, we ordered Southern Curry (chewy beef that had brown sauce slapped on at the last minute - the beef was utterly tasteless and the curry was bland), Sea Bass Clay Pot (bland, and to top it off, the vermicelli tasted like it was processed in an oil tanker), and sticky rice (I kid you not, the bf had to cut his sticky rice with a knife.  Like, sawing motions.  Let's actually cook the food the day of, shall we, instead of using a microwave?)  I will give them this - they'll give you sizeable portions... of inedible food.\n\nNo booze in my Mango Mojito.  I ordered booze with my syrupy sauce, thank you very much.\n\nThe service was awful.  We asked for a second beer and it literally took 10 minutes and 3 (yes, THREE) requests from our server for it to arrive.  Dude was nice, but c'mon.  If your busboys aren't bringing the beer, and your customer has requested it 2x already, why don't you go up to the bar and I don't know, retrieve it and serve your customer?  I know, it's a brilliant idea!  \n\nBottom line - go here if you want to look trendy, and don't care how long you wait for your food/beverage.  Or how your food tastes, for that matter.   Maybe we caught this place on a bad night, but I after reading a few other reviews, I don't know how this place stays open.

The interior is really well done - the restaurant and bar are separated by a medium height wood wall. Plants and other wooden artifacts are on display everywhere, giving the impression that they care more about the diners' experience than cramming in as many tables as possible to maximize profit. Thats always an immediate plus.\nThen there's the parking - this side of SOMA you can park on any of the streets, and the spots opposite the restaurant rotate out fairly frequently on weekends. Another plus for not having to circle the block like a vulture. They take plastic, so automatic plus for that also.\n\nAnd finally, the food is excellent.

We had the Chicken Mieng Kum, the Garlic Pepper Shrimp, and the Golden Triangle. \n\nThe Mieng Kum was an interesting appetizer with many flavors to savor. The ginger was a bit strong and the lime had a kick to it, but the sauce was perfectly balanced. The Garlic Pepper Shrimp was pretty standard, nothing too special about it, but at least it tasted good. As for dessert, we wanted to try the more unique dessert and went for the Golden Triangle. It was a strange dish, the egg yolk spun cocoon thing had a good texture and yet it tasted like Filipino nan bread. Then, it had these little fruit-looking things, but it was mung bean filling with a gelatin covering to look like cherries and other fruits. Interesting, but not a standout.\n\nOverall, pretty good Thai food, service was pretty quick and efficient, and the ambiance was subtle. We went on a Wednesday, which seemed like a slow day since there weren't many people. Still, a good choice for decent Thai in SF.", "author": "Jess W."}

It was open and airy inside, with just enough decor to be decorated without being tacky.  There was a TV with \"asian music videos\" my fiance had in his view (I couldn't see it) that didn't need to be there, but that's my opinion.\n\nWe started with the fresh spring rolls.  They were the largest I have ever had and were a bit lacking in flavor without the sauce on the side.  But the sauce was terrific!\n\nThere were many things on the menu that tempted me, but I ordered the chicken pumpkin curry since it was so highly recommended and was very glad I did!  It was rich and creamy with tender chicken pieces and yummy bits of pumpkin with just the right amount of spice (for me, which I think is on the milder side), served in a hollowed-out pumpkin!  Awesome!  My fiance got the pad thai with chicken (his usual) and the cashew prawn entree.  The pad thai was good (no spice), and was pretty typical.  The prawn dish didn't have as much spice as you would have thought since you could see the peppers and red flakes all over the dish... but it was still flavorful.  My honey got some hot sauce on the side that kicked up the spice for him nicely.  If you like things spicy, you should probably order them enhanced from the start.\n\nWe also had a bottle of Malbec (don't remember the name, but I think they only had one) which was... warm.  As in, seemingly warmer than room temp.  Still was tasty though!\n\nService was great!  Very nice waiter who was attentive and always had a nice smile.", "author": "Lisa T."}

But, the place was warm and stuffy - they need to open some windows or something. Ambiance was a bit weird, too as I had to listen to the self-important geek proselytizing at the next table about something fantastic he'd just done that day. His voice just echoed throughout the place.\n\nI ordered the Thai BBQ chicken, and the waitress confirmed it'd be all white meat. Well, the meat wasn't white. It was dark and undercooked. And, a few pieces were so strange that I couldn't figure out what part of the chicken they came from - one piece looked like a knuckle all bloody and weird. I didn't want to gross out my coworkers, so I kept quiet and ate around it. The flavor was quite good once I got over the strange chicken part and undercooked bits. If it had been all white meat and well done, I'd be giving 5 stars. But, mysterious dark chicken parts that are undercooked just don't pass muster. And, one of the other people at the table had an order of Pad Thai that was so small - we all thought it was an appetizer.\n\nAll in all, very average with plenty of room for improvement.", "author": "Maren P."}

I would order it again.\n\nMy wife and I don't often order dessert but we were in the mood for something sweet. We went with the chocolate cake and it didn't disappoint. What we liked about it was that it wasn't a really thick, rich, overly sweet, chocolate cake that you typically get at a restaurant.

I've eaten at a lot of different Thai restaurants and while the food was good, it wasn't anything special. Except for the Tofu Mieng Kum appetizer, which was awesome. This appetizer is a lettuce leaf containing a small piece of fried tofu, a tiny lime piece, onion, chopped peanut, chili and ginger. You simply put some of the accompanying roasted coconut dip on top of the other ingredients, wrap it up, and devour. I joked to my friends it was a \"flavor bomb.\" Each bite of this wonderful appetizer packs an incredibly flavorful burst to the taste buds.\n\nWe had a chicken dish that was good but pretty basic - just some chicken with red and green bell peppers, onion and basil. The portion was pretty small. The green vegetable curry tasted good but was very watery. We also had tofu and shrimp pad thai (tasty, with noodles that were more al dente which I prefer) and pea sprouts sauteed with garlic. I loved the pea sprouts, which were flavorful and garlicky.

Everyone seemed happy with their orders, but portions were small.\n\nService: excellent!  With a group of 40, they patiently waited for us as members slowly arrived.  They got all our orders in quickly and my cup of water was refilled at least 5 times that night!  The staff are well dressed, very friendly, and had great service.  The toilet got clogged and immediately 2 staff quickly came to the rescue and in minutes all was at peace again.\n\nPrice: the food was good, but portions were kind of small to be charging $12 for a little plate of noodles with some chicken pieces.  Slightly over priced, I feel, so this is why they get 3 stars, not 4.\n\nAtmosphere: very cute (the cartoon monkey logo and other cute pieces) and posh.  If all the food weren't around, it could easily be a great bar spot to go out to town with friends and laugh next to the decorative Buddhas and dark wood finished floors and furniture.\n\nRestroom: one single-occupancy restroom each for males and females.  Speaking only for the male restroom: very clean, well lit, and the cutest decorations of various framed \"Lost Dog\" or \"Lost Cat\" ads from around the world with handwritten inscriptions saying the dog/cat belongs to Koh Samui.\n\nLocation: the restaurant's kind of out on its own in SOMA, but it also allows for lots of available street parking.

I only came here because it's close to my office.\n\nFirst off, the decor was pretty nice. I could do without the TVs, but I guess they come in handy at the bar during happy hour.\n\nThat's where my compliments end. The food was pretty bland. I ordered the seafood pad thai during my first visit and the chicken pad see ew during my second visit. While the presentation of the dishes were aesthetically pleasing, both dishes lacked flavor. I wanted to ask the wait staff for soy sauce, but they weren't very attentive.\n\nWhich brings me to another complaint -- the service. During my second visit, the service was subpar. Our waitress came to our table only once -- in the very beginning when she took our order. After that, we were basically ignored. In fact, I had to ask the food server for water since our waitress never came by and did not respond when I tried to get her attention. After we finished our meal, the food server promptly cleaned off our table. We then sat there at an empty table for a full 20 minutes, wondering if our waitress was going to come by with the check. Eventually, I had to flag her down to ask for the check and she gave us an annoyed look and did not address us as she put the check tray on the table. I left my Discover card on the tray and waited for her to come back so she could swipe my card. After 10 minutes, I had to flag her down again. When she came by, she rudely said, \"We don't accept Discover.\" So, I replaced the Discover card with my Visa only to realize that she had already walked away. Couldn't she have waited a mere 2 seconds for me to give her a different credit card before leaving our table? Or, at the minimum, couldn't she have said, \"I'll be right back.\" Nope. So, once again, we were sitting there wondering if she would ever come back or if we would have to get her attention again. After yet another 10 minutes, I had to flag her down so she could swipe my card. She was not very apologetic. Sure, the restaurant seemed busy as it was during the lunch hour, but I do not think that is an excuse for not being attentive.\n\nOverall, the tasteless food wasn't worth the prices and the service was pretty bad. I was also annoyed that they did not give free refills of my iced tea! It wasn't even Thai iced tea -- it was just the plain, unsweetened iced tea. C'mon, they could give free refills for that. It's not like this was a fancy restaurant whereby the concept of \"free refills\" might damage their reputation -- I mean, hello, they had TVs on the walls on the ESPN channel right next to their fancy elephant tusks and Buddha statues.

The bill came out to be just under a hundred bucks, so basically 120 with tip.   Good thing we passed on drinks... cause that's pretty pricey for Thai... But worth the enjoyment.   \n\nI particularly liked the Sample for twor, which was $22t, and the server took the time to tell us about each of the 6 items them.  I particularly liked the Mango Salad in the center.   My Beef was a bit overdone, and her Duck was very fatty and slightly overdone as well.    The volcano rice was a nice presentation, as it comes served in a pineapple, with the rice pouring out the side like lava down a mountain.   But unlike a traditional Pineapple Fried Rice Thai dish... which is sweet and retains the Pineapple flavor... this dish had a lot of yellow curry seasoning.  It did however have a load of sea food in it, and was $15 Ala cart.     \n\nI was also a bit disappointed that they did not have Nam Tok beef salad on the Menu, and only had a pork version of it.   \n\nBut the best part of the meal was the Tam Kha Gui coconut soup appetizer.   it was very rick and rick with a nice taste of sweet and hot Thai spices, but agan, pricey @ $6 per small cup.   At any other Thai place you get a big bowl o it for $6.\n\nI probably won't go back because it's a bit to she-she for me, and I like my Thai a bit more Native and a lot less expensive.   Even though we did have a lot of food, it was at least twice as much as any other Thai place would have been, less the upscale ambiance and stuffy atmosphere.

Also, service can really suck, slow and impatient, and it is incredibly noisy, can't hear any conversation at all. Pad Thai was greasy, salty, no good flavors, and small. Curry also lacked any real flavor, tasted too sweet. \n\nUpdate: \nSo you think that at most restaurants when the staff finds a negative review, they should ideally try to improve. Not with Koh Samui+Monkey! I got nasty messages from someone working at Koh Samui (Ricky S., apparently he did this to other people who gave negative reviews as well). He basically called me an idiot and hypocrite for my review, somehow assuming that even though I hate the restaurant, I have gone back (which is false!).

It was great after the dot-com bust as you seemed to have the whole place to yourself and everyone knew you. Things change.\n\nThe food has been consistently good, if you know what to order. Best bets are the Corn Fritters, Larb Gai, Crying Tiger Salad and anything grilled. Curries are hit and miss. True, it's not the most authentic Thai food in the world [ you need to actually go to Thailand for that ] but it is tasty and usually doesn't disappoint. Also, while not authentic, the Nigori Sake with a nice spicy salad is a great paring.\n\nKoh Samui can get noisy when crowded. It seems to have been \"discovered\" by many of the hip and cool people in the SOMA area [ and people from the Marina who pretend they are] so your best bet is to go on a weeknight if loud parties and all black outfits aren't your thing. \n\nI will say that the service has taken a nose dive in the past couple of years.

Not only do they have a full bar but all the drinks are monkey related...and boy are they tasty! Wine and beer are also available at very reasonable prices.\n\nThe food menu is extensive as well. It felt like 5 Thai menus jumbled into one. Well you can't have Thai food without the staple pad thai and it was yummy.

I live in South Beach/SOMA with about 10+ different thai restaurants around the neighborhood and I have to say that Koh Samui and the monkey has one of the best quality food.  But the owner must learn to hire better staff.  The person who answers the phone to take orders or reservation sounds incompetent and half of the time messes up the carry out order. I would have ordered from here more often despite the more expensive menu had the person on the other line been more professional and validat orders before hanging up the phone.  I was just here for dinner tonight at 6:30 when restaurants was half empty and yet it took a long time for the first round of drinks to arrive.  then when our party ordered a 2nd round of drinks to compliment our entrees (restaurant still quite empty), they never arrived.  We were just about done with our dinner and asked the waitress to cancel the drinks, that was when she finally said the drinks were coming...we were too nice to agree to the '5 min' wait. but still the drinks didn't come for another 20 minutes.  We literally were drinking after all the food were gone..and we kind of expected she at least would apologize or give us some discount even just $5 as a 'nice' gesture...like we care about that for a $130 meal.  but no, the check arrived quickly, and she picked up the credit card quicker than she had every paid attention to us throughout the entire meal.  no discount and no apologies. we were still gracious enough to give her a 10% tip even thouhgh she really deserved nothing.  She only came by the within the first 10 minutes of our meal and that was it.\n\nOwner of the restaurant  - please read these reviews.  the food is AWESOME!  Kitchen staff is excellent.  however, half of your staff and service need to be changed/improved. unlike  Osha Thai - their food is not good as yours but they are efficient and the service is impeccable!!  the reason they are getting all the customers in this area in South Beach ahd SOMA (and the reason the are still profitable after opening up 3 chain locations all within a few miles in this area).  you need to interview and train your staff more carefully and get the right folks to work for you.  then you will see the difference.  I go to Osha all the time for their efficiency, customer service and I know if the same situation happened at any of their locations tonight, the GM would have came to apologize offering half o the meal on the house.\n\ngood luck with the business. this is San francisco - we expect great food (it's a given) and most importantly, customer serivce and you certainly need to train your staff better.", "author": "wen y."}

So we ordered the imperial rolls, spicy chicken w/ basil, green curry w/ beef, and garlic shrimp.  The Imperial rolls were presented in a unique style. It was log cabin style!  They didnt taste any different tho.  The Garlic Shrimp was very good but the portions are on the light side.  The spicy chicken and curry were good but nothing to die for.  \n\nIn hindsight, this restaurant is great for a girls night out dinner.  It isnt made for the blue collared guy with a good appetite.  The decor and presentation is great but I don't see anything here that makes me scream eat here. My girlfriend loves the place making me think, this place is more for the women.

At Koh Samui, it's almost the same thing, except in this case, it takes so long to order and then get your food, you may forget what you ordered or what you just ate.  The industrial space is beautifully decorated, sort of a Thai restaurant with a SOMA-loft flavor. The hostess definitely did not seem to grasp the concept of multi-tasking.  She was on the phone, apparently taking a (really looong) phone order or reservation, and she couldn't be bothered to look up to acknowledge our existence (nor the 2 other parties that showed up in the next 5 minutes). \n\nThe food was good, but as someone else said, a bit on the sweet side.  The MIENG KUM appetizer was good, but it wasn't well explained on the menu, and it was so loud in the restaurant, we could barely understand the server's explanation of the dish.  It was spinach leaves covered with the described ingredients  (dried coconut, lime, etc.); it felt more like a dessert (due to the coconut) than an appetizer.  We also had the sea bass clay pot (delicious), the pumpkin curry (good, but too sweet and, while the pumpkin as a bowl is indeed a pretty presentation, the actual amount of chicken and pumpkin was exceedingly skimpy), and the grilled pork (really good).  \n\nKoh Samui is definitely a cool restaurant with pretty good Thai food.

Not bad, but the serving size is a little small.  I ordered the wonton soup and was happy with it.  It had cabbage, spinach, bean sprouts, Chinese BBQ pork, egg noodles and 3-4 wontons.  Love that it had such a variety of stuff in it.  My cousin had the red curry and it was kind of small.  He said it tasted ok, but lacked veggies.  My friend had the asparagus with shrimp and she was impressed with the asparagus.  That it was cooked perfectly, and the best she has had in a while.  And my other friend was eating the spare ribs and the chicken eggplant, and enjoyed it too.  Overall, not bad, but now let's talk about the service.  The have 3 on the floor and usually one bus boy.  The dude waiter is not very attentive and cordial like the ladies.  Asked for hot sauce and never got it.  And he tried to rush us to leave and immediately gave us our check after we finished, not ever bothering to ask if we wanted dessert.

Although, I'll agree with other reviewers that the decorum struggles to find balance on the fine line of trendy and cheesy and it can be tough to find parking.  Note: if the Giants are playing, forget about it!  On to what matters, though...the food!!!\n \nFor starters (see what I did there - kind of a double entendre, no?), you can't go wrong with the \"bag of gold.\"   Or, if you feel like going the non-fried route (what are you doing at an Asian restaurant?!) I'd recommend the \"fresh spring roll.\"  The Tom Ka Gai (coconut soup) is refreshing and flavorful without being overwhelmingly sweet or coconut-esque.  \n\nOn to the main event(s)...The \"fire cracker seafood sizzling hot plate\" is delish!  Prawns, squid, scallops, and crab claws with a spicy peanut sauce - a must try!!  The Penang Neur (stewed beef) and Kang Dang Ped (honey-roasted duck and pineapple) are two of the better Thai curry dishes I've had in my illustrious gastronomic career.   Also, you get the option of steamed jasmine, brown, coconut or sticky rice, which is kinda neat!\n\nOh, and this is definitely a point of personal preference, but in my humble opinion nothing accompanies Thai food quite like an Argentinian Malbec, which they just so happen to offer by the glass of bottle.

Plenty of other places with great food but you also get to pay for that privilege.\n\nThe building exterior isn't much to speak of - it's easy to walk right past this place without knowing it's a restaurant.  The first time we went, that's exactly what happened.  The inside has a definite southeast Asian theme to it, including requisite Buddhas and elephants.\n\nAll the food I've tried there is very good, though I've had better and more authentic Thai in the south bay.  They regularly have tasty variants on the Americanized standard Thai dishes, though my only complaint is that what they call hot isn't all that hot (and I don't really go for the scorching Thai hot).  Decent sized portions - not French tiny but not a heaping plate full.

I actually liked the dumplings a lot.  The spring rolls tasted like they do at any other restaurant.  Nothing stood out about them.  For our main courses, we decided to order the Crispy Soft Shell Crab and the Pad Thai.  I wasn't too impressed with the Pad Thai, but the soft shell crab was good.  And luckily, the dish came with two, so we each got one to eat.  After perusing through all the Yelp reviews for this restaurant, I had intended on ordered the Pumpkin Curry because of all the rave reviews, but I didn't.  I'm just so not into the spicy and this one time I went to Osha Thai on a business lunch and ordered Pumpkin Curry and it was waaaaay too spicy for me.

The decor, ambiance, service and cocktail selection (mango mojito, yum!) got a 5 from me right away. It was a late dinner, so it wasn't crowded. However, they lose a star for being confusing with our appetizer. We asked for the chicken satay mieng kum appetizer, which neither of us had before. So when they brought out both a chicken satay appetizer on its own AND the chicken mieng kum, we figured they went together and gobbled both up (delicious, btw, thought I'm not a fan of ginger). However, we got the bill and realized they'd given us two separate appetizers. Too late, we'd already eaten them. They gained back that lost star when they brought out the madame sea bass, which was so buttery-flaky-delicious that I nearly lost my head. The coconut curry sauce that came with it was to die for; almost tempted to lick it off my plate. However, their pad thai left something to be desired. It was a little dry, lacked flavor, and the beef we ordered in it  was a little chewy and fatty. Pad thai is such a go-to dish that it better be made right, but this one definitely lost them 2 stars... \n\nI'd still go back and try other dishes. Their pumpkin chicken curry looked great, and I'd definitely have the madame sea bass again (not to mention the coconut rice!).

It's not the biggest restaurant holding maybe 60 people. There were about 3 groups of at least ten people so there was a lot of chatter. Seems like a great place for a group party. They have a bar area with 2 big screen tvs. \n\nStarted with the stuffed mushrooms with peanut sauce. It's fried so it's pretty hard to mess up. There's a lot more meatball inside than mushroom which was fine with me. The peanut sauce was pretty good.  Main course we had pumpkin curry, fried soft shell crab, sea bass in a clay pot and their special for the night fried scallops. The pumpkin curry was fantastic. Nice flavor, texture and presentation. It comes in a small little pumpkin. The fried soft shell crab was good but nothing out of the ordinary. It came with some kind of tangy, spicy sauce that was delicious. The fried scallops were ok but I ate more of the fried breading than scallops. Try to stay away from their sea bass in a clay pot dish. The noodles and flavor were pretty good but we only got 3 pieces of sea bass in the whole dish. Stick to some authentic chinese restaurants for good clay pot dishes and avoid this one at all costs. \n\nThe restaurant had a plethora of exotic cocktails that looked pretty good. They had a few beers on tap and a nice wine selection too. Definitely a fun place to go, have some drinks and eat some good thai food. You will have to talk pretty loudly since the whole restaurant is pretty loud.  The service was fantastic.

For the HH you can only sit at a bar which has 2 huge TVs playing sports, which I was not a big fan of. Music playing was also questionable. For $5 each we got the fresh Summer rolls, they were good size but mostly filled with iceberg lettuce and few pieces of fried tofu. Next was the the Pad Thai, which had a weird odor to it - i guess that was the fish sauce, which I personally can't handle. I've had Pad Thai elsewhere, but it was never this strong.  The Pad See Ew had really wide noodles some where stuck together, there were few pieces of brocolli and some of the tofu pieces were cold in the middle. On one side I can see that restaurants get skimpy on the HH food offering.  On the other side they should serve food that is a sample of what you might get if you ate dinner there. And since the HH food was horrible I will not be back for more. \n\nAs far as the interior based on their site that has only evening photos, I was a bit dissapointed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-10", "description": "In The Know: Right of the bat I knew I was going to love this design. It isn't like every other restaurant that is street level; you actually have to go up a small flight of stairs to get there. (Its not that it is the only restaurant that is like this in SF but I haven't blogged on those places yet so outta sight, outta mind - at least for now so back off!) It is great as far as restaurants go because you feel better than everyone else when you are looking down upon all the other restaurant minions...muahahahaha. At the top of the stairs is a bench with bronze see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil monkeys. Great touch seeing as how the restaurant has monkey in the title and flippin monkeys everywhere (all thats missing is the barrel). Once you enter the full bar is to your immediate left, a great water fountain/Buddha sculpture/partition situation separating the dining area. The tables and chairs used to furnish the restaurant was only one of the things that really tickled my pickle. One could say custom build furniture is a fetish of mine so....hi, creators of those fabulous wood/metal pieces...hi ;) The other pickle tickler was how they incorporated the obvious Thai decor in a warehousey shell. There was almost floor to ceiling warehouse windows (generally it is several small panes of glass) and exposed ventilation system. On one of the walls there was an incredible Buddha sculpture surrounded by candles adding to a very intimate feel throughout the whole space. It would definitely be a great place to take a date, if your into the looking down through warehouse windows at other restaurants while surrounded by monkeys, sculptures, and candles siting on fabulous chairs...kinda thing. \n\n\nBehind The Bar: A sexy tattoo, slick haired, beautiful eyed, pirate looking chap. Please don't mistake the mention of this pirate with the SF's infamous pirate (General Lee) that works (ed) at the Beauty Bar. Oh, no no no. He is a much cleaner cut and of the more delicious variety. However, even with the pretty ones I can always find fault. My one qualm with him is I think he thought I was some sort of undercover agent sent by the powers that be (i.e. his bosses) to make sure that nothing but whispers of sweet nothings come from his supple lips. Translation: he was boring and withheld all the juicy gossip from me. He mentioned how nice it was to have large windows surrounding the space allowing for the sun to heat the room up itself. That's it, that's all I get!?! I blame in on his equally boring and non-imaginative colleagues/friends siting at the bar. You don't have to be shy with me and look at your friends to help you answer questions my sensual succulent. If he was to humor me, however, he would have said that in the dining section they tried to squeeze to many tables into the space. There was no coherent flow. Unless you know the layout extremely well, it was hard to navigate the maze. Some tables where just far enough apart that made you think you could fit through them but come to find out after sipping on the Pumpkin curry chicken in red curry sauce served in pumpkin you realize how tight your cloths fit now and promise to start tomorrow with your Extreme Makeover: Stop telling yourself your going to start tomorrow and just do it already! edition...so getting between these tables was a bit harder than you could imagine. Thanks for the help and words of wisdom you sexy lil pirate vixen you; I'll be after your booty soon... \n\n\nWho's Who: Other than the aforementioned pirates' shipmates at the bar, I saw two after work ladies and a group of diners in their mid 30's (ish). Not a whole lot to work with. (It also was 7pmish on a Thursday. pretty much been proven that is exactly the hour where no one goes out to eat....ummm....ya) Let me paint you a picture of what kinda crowd I can imagine would frequent this kinda joint: at the bar we have a mixture of 20-30 somethings sipping on tasty beverages after a long and extremely prosperous day at work. Everyone is enjoying each others companies, laughing at each others jokes, and lining up to buy me shots;) The dining room is filled with folks of all ages and backgrounds, from a grandma knitting in the corner to Jesus playing cards with 50 cent to children hiccuping rainbows to Johnny Depp (the real, and my forever #1 pirate) feeding me strawberries to everyone lining up to buy me shots. Come to think of it, I am an extremely great artist and think I really should frequent this place more often. \n\nFind this review on Behind the Bar - www.btbdesign.blogspot.com", "author": "Sheyna G."}

Fortunately for me, we came here for a work related dinner so money was not an issue (thank you Jim!) The tables were decorated with tulips in water glasses. A well stocked bar is evident as you enter the restaurant. We started with some delicious appetizers- fried sweet corn fritters dipped in a cucumber chili sauce, fresh spring rolls served with peanut sauce, and a dish with spinach leaves filled with chicken, peanuts, and toasted coconut. For dinner we had an assortment of delicacies including pad thai, panang duck curry, lemon grass tofu, beef with fried mango, pumpkin curry served in a hallowed out kabocha squash and sizzling seafood stew. All was served with coconut rice. The pumpkin curry was my favorite, but perhaps I am biased since I a huge fan of pumpkin. The panang duck was also quite tasty. Desserts were a whole other ball of wax. Completely out of this world that is. Very creative. We had the following: fried and caramelized bananas flambe (ie they were on fire) served with toasted coconut and ice cream, mango sticky rice with mango sorbet, baked kabocha squash with pumpkin custard and pumpkin ice cream, and a jackfruit iced milk. I must say that again my favorite was the pumpkin dessert although all were quite spectacular. I should also mention the cocktails they serve are creative, although I was not too much of a fan of the one I ordered (something with pomegranite and gin).", "author": "Kate A."}

Considering the look and feel of the place, I did expect better service. We basically had to seek out the service anytime we needed something. One big ding is my drink order. We had 2 orders of thai iced tea but only one arrived. After 15 minutes and my mouth getting quite dry, I asked about my drink. It was obvious they forgot my drink. So, the waiter came back and told me the reason I didn't get my drink was because they're of thai iced tea (at 830PM on a Friday nite). That was an impressive start. No apologies, just that they're out. So, we went ahead and ordered several of the popular dishes; duck, beef, and shrimp. The food was ok. Nothing special to rave about. The beef was very hard and the \"spicy\" dishes were not all that spicy. I like the atmosphere of the place, but for the food and price, I'd try other places first.", "author": "nik t."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-10-20", "description": "I really wanted to like this place but today I came to the conclusion that it's just not going to happen. I have tried a variety of dishes from the daily specials to various curries and have not been blown away by any of them. One of the first items I ordered was the ever popular pad thai and it was by far the worst pad thai I have ever had. I didn't realize you could screw up that dish but they found a way to make mess out of it. However, the curries are a big step up and I would recommend the pumpkin curry. Today I had the sweet chili chicken with crispy basil and while the flavors were fine the food was served lukewarm. It only took them about 5 minutes to serve my two friends and I so I'm guessing our meals were scooped out cafeteria style which surprises me because it doesn't strike me as that type of restaurant. The portions are also very small for the price. I paid $9 today for a small scoop of chicken and rice. For $9 I could take a quick bus ride up to the Thai restaurant in the food court at the Westfield Center and get three times as much food for the same quality or go to Osha for much higher quality. Also, my friend ordered a coke which came in a glass that I doubt could hold 12oz of soda. He finished it and asked the server for a refill... when the bill came we noticed that not only does Koh Samui charge you for soda refills but each soda costs $3 so he was rung up for $6 worth of soda! Now maybe it states this on the menu but who would have figured it would of cost that much? Bottom Line: Koh Samui has just joined the list of restaurants I will not be going back to.", "author": "Mark B."}

The decor is a little quirky and over the top for a thai place...they kind of try to do a little of everything, but once you get past that, the place is nice. We went here for my birthday so it was a large group of people and although I don't have a clear recollection of all the occurrences that took place, I remember the food was quite tasty and the service was great.

My husband and I live nearby and this was our go-to place for a low-key Thai dinner when we didn't feel like cooking.  The last several times we've been there, however, the food has frankly sucked.  We ordered a papaya salad that came in this odd cylindrical wooden bowl, and unfortunately, it seemed that it had been sitting in that wooden bowl forever because it actually tasted like wood.  I think the salad just picked up the flavor of the wood bowl or the varnish because it tasted exactly how the wood bowl smelled.  Not so great.  My husband ALWAYS gets the pumpkin curry, but over the years it's become a watery mess with half-cooked pieces of pumpkin.  My green curry beef was okay, but really not worth the price considering the 4 or 5 slivers of beef in it.

Koh Samui caters more to the american-thai palate, with creative twists on thai dishes. Their most popular dish by far is the pumpkin curry, which completely delivered on my expectations. Unique dish, great taste, interesting use of spices and beautiful presentation! (The curry is served in a hollowed out pumpkin). Seafood is also fresh. I had the garlic pepper prawns recently. Really enjoyed that dish - the spices used in the dish were well balanced. Pad thai is consistently good as well. One of the most interesting things I've had here is the fried sweet corn patties. I'd definitely recommend trying it if you're a big fan of corn bread or tamalito. Koh Samui is the place to go if you're looking for a good cocktail and a good meal with friends.

The food is delicious and the perfect level of spicy requested on each dish (just shy of breaking a sweat for me and just above ketchup for my wife), the service is fast and nice and the cocktails are innovative and fantastic (we always end up drunker than we planned because it sounds, and is, so good).", "author": "Mike B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-10-31", "description": "I have had great experiences here - best yellow curry and peanut sauce in town.  One bad experience recently drops the star level.  The new hostess seriously screwed up our take-out order.  I am not exaggerating - it took over ONE HOUR to get our food - even though they initally promised 15 minutes.  We kept saying that we had to go b/c the other people in our party were performing at the Hemlock and she kept saying \"5 more minutes\". To say that the band barely made their performance on time is an understatement.  Of course, when we left AFTER WAITING ONE HOUR our orders were wrong anyway - including a veggie dish that ended up with chicken in it.", "author": "d l."}

Asian Fusion interiors will never cease to intimidate me. Hip decor aside, the food was just okay, but at least the lunch menu was affordable and comparable to other Thai places. We ordered the panang curry with chicken and their Bangkok pad thai with beef. The beef was a bit  over cooked in the pad thai, and a bit too chewy. The panang curry was really good though. Totally reminded me of the Burmese fish noodle dish, oh no kauswe. It had that same coconut-y milky taste and consistency. I swear could just slather that all over my rice and be happy with just eating curry sauce and rice. It's a nice comfort food feeling. Service was great with very attentive servers. My glass of water was never really empty, so I can't complain about not being hydrated.", "author": "amy y."}

The food is good and the service I get at the restaurant is not bad.  That said, you can imagine how excited I was when I learned that they were offering delivery service.  I ordered lunch for my staff the very next day and bragged about how great this restaurant is.  An hour after ordering, my assistant pointed out that our food still hadn't arrived.  Okay, that was strange.  Perhaps they are just backed up, I thought to myself.  We called the restaurant and the host confirmed our address and assured us our food was on the way.  Thirty more minutes later and still no food had arrived.  We called back a second time and were told the restaurant would call the driver.  No return call.  Needless to say, we never received our food despite two calls to the restaurant.  The following day I called and asked to speak to a manager.  I was put in touch with a woman named Zoe who not-so-politely told me that they had \"issues\" yesterday and that she was told by her staff that the driver couldn't find my building.  Uh, what do you mean couldn't find?  There's just three-foot high numbers in front of my building showing the building's address!?!  WTH!  Zoe could care less than I looked like a complete ass or that my staff ended up not having lunch because of their error.  She non-chalantly said that she was \"sorry\" (yeah, right!) and basically blamed the non-delivery on us because supposedly they called me back and there was no answer.  Hello...I'm in a building with a 24-hour doorman!  Whatever!  I highly DO NOT recommend ordering for delivery.  I won't knock the in-house service though--which is why I'm rating this restaurant one star!", "author": "Keilani L."}
