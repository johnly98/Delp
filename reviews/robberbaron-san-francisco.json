Someone in our group picked up the tab so I never even saw menu prices or options but we drank a Sangiovese red wine and both a sparking and flat rose.

Was here for happy hour with the Golden Gate Tri Club and they had an excellent selection of wines and AMAZING customer service. Before my wine glass was empty it was filled right back up. I had the Grenache noir which was nice, light and slightly tart. I am moving to the neighborhood so I am looking forward to coming back again and again.", "author": "Kristina P."}

It was night time after 7 PM at the bar, and these 2 kids were playing and running around. The staff actually played with them instead of asking the kids to at least sit by their parents.", "author": "Monica R B."}

We were comfortable and cozy, we ordered 2 bottles of wine that was a delish red zinfandel from dry creek valley. Atmosphere was a mixed crowd passing through- service was friendly- cant beat a friendly server guy with a twisty mustache. My friend ordered the Krispy bar- which was out of this world!", "author": "Angelica M."}

The place just has a great feel -- they've mastered the perfect chic yet welcoming style. Great drinks (still craving the Einstok beer), really fun and friendly staff (love the bow ties).  If we had a spot like this in the Mission I'd be there every night.  We posted up at the bench in the window and didn't leave (AMAZING people watching up and down Polk). I highly recommend for after work, drink date, or meeting up with friends.", "author": "Dolores Y."}

We'll see if they change anything on the menu.", "author": "C W."}
