Also took the recommendation of someone who, as it turns out, doesn't really care for raw fish.  Oops.  \n\nThe Hamachi was good, but the temp seemed a little off, and it was sliced very thick and the pieces uneven in size.  The Inari was ok though the skin/pouch fell off of the rice.  The tempura roll was ok, but very salty.  The Dragon Roll was just ok.  The 49ers Roll (Hamachi/Avocado topped with salmon) was also ok, but again, not remarkable and the presentation unimpressive.\n\nThe 'star' of this review is the recommended scallop prepared sashimi style.  Who knew a raw scallop could be so tepid and rubbery and fishy?  It was terrible, I had wished I hadn't swallowed it!  We had ordered four pieces.  My friend and I each had a piece, looked at each other and said, uh oh.  We returned the scallops to the sushi chef and we told him they were awful, not fresh at all!  He looked very surprised.  Kudos for him for taking the charge off of the bill.\n\nI'd like to think that this was all just due to Sunday maybe being a less than ideal option for fresh fish, so coupled with the pleasant service, I'm going with two stars.  \n\nWhen the best thing you ate was the watermelon at the end of the meal, well, I'll be giving this one a miss in the future.", "author": "D S."}

You will have better service and food at a fast food restaurant, trust me. We walked in because my parents couldn't wait any longer (1+ hour) for a table next door at Zazie's. We sat down in an empty restaurant with only three other customers sitting at the sushi bar. We put in our appetizer order for our parents because they are older and needed something in their tummies quick. We ordered a plate of agedashi tofu and chicken karaage. We waited until the sever came back to take our next order. We placed our orders for our entrees and the appetizers still have not come yet. 35 minutes later...we get our appetizers. I don't get why it took so long for our appetizers to come out considering that the rest of the restaurant was empty. Anyways, they used the wrong type of tofu for the dish. They used firm tofu instead of soft tofu. I've tried this dish way too many times and I've never had firm tofu used. The texture was not fitting for the dish. The chicken karaage was super dry and tasteless. It came with a dipping sauce that was overly sweet. Both appetizers were disappointing considering that it took over half an hour to make. Our entrees (sukiyaki beef with tempura, chicken teriyaki, beef teriyaki, tempura, rainbow roll, and chicken entree) were all equally as disappointing. The chicken was dry, rubbery, and drenched in teriyaki sauce. The beef was chewy and drenched in teriyaki sauce. The sukiyaki was drenched in sweet sauce. As you can tell, the chef uses this tactic of drenching the food that s/he cant cook in sauce for flavoring. The service was comparable to the food--slow and once you get it, you wished you never asked for it.

As other reviewers point out, the vibe is more family-friendly than anything else. This is NOT a romantic date spot (well, not by my standards).\n\nIn my lifetime, I've eaten my body weight, possibly many times over, in sushi, so I like to think that I know good sushi. The fish at Kamekyo is simply mediocre. I've been pleasantly surprised a couple times with, what I felt was, very fresh fish. However, there've been an equal (or maybe greater) number of times where I've gotten a whiff of that dreadful, off-putting fishy smell from their nigiri.\n\nAt the end of the day, it all boils down to the value, though. Something positive could be said for a sushi joint that may not necessarily embody Jiro's dream of quality but can be had for a relative pittance. In Kamekyo's case, I have a hard time spending less than $60 for dinner. WAY too much for this food.\n\nAll of this gets them 2.5 stars in my book, and I'll round up for the Cole Valley convenience factor.", "author": "Matt T."}

Months passed, and after untold times of passing the place on the way to and from the N line, I finally grew curious.  My father came over to visit for dinner, and I suggested that we give the place a try.\n\n\"I think they're Chinese\" he whispered to me as we entered the restaurant, referring to the couple who appeared to be running the place.  Later he confirmed to me that he heard them speaking in Chinese (my father is Chinese but my mother isn't, and so as is common in mixed-race/language families the father's language was not passed on).\n\nThe food, well, it tasted like sushi made by non-Japanese.  The flavors weren't quite right, the sashimi lacked the freshness that makes sashimi so wonderful, and the rolls were eminently forgettable.  A month ago I could have told you to grab real sushi at the authentic joint around the corner on Carl run by an elderly Japanese couple.

However, after trying (and failing) to enjoy either take-out or in-store food on multiple occasions over the past 18 months, we are calling it quits. Furthermore, we sadly note that this place has been on a steep decline from mediocre to downright bad since 2010. \n\nRationale for rating:\nThe sashimi is poorly cut. It is thick and cut in such a way that you notice the \"grain\" of the fish. It is tough. \n\nThe spicy rolls are covered with sriracha so that is the only flavor you taste. (Yes, I know spicy rolls are inauthentic, but they can be done in such a way that you can still taste the type of fish.)\n\nThis place is expensive- about $25-35/person (food only) at dinner time. This pricing is at or above higher-quality sushi places in the city for that price. \n\nAlso--and this is the dealbreaker: ***the fish is not fresh***. It all has a distinctly \"fishy\" flavor and is not enjoyable and perhaps not advisable to ingest. \n\nTo the owners- \n\n(1) please consider abbreviating your menu and focusing only on the most demanded seafood, so that you can turn over the inventory quickly and only serve your customers the freshest product.

We were really excited to hit a sushi joint that was not closed at 9pm.\n\nIt smelled a little fishy, but I was not ready to judge.  \n\nFirst mistake: I wanted to order a roll that was on he menu, but add spicy tuna and tobiko. The lady did not seem to understand what I was trying to ask for, and made it sound WAY more complicated than I was wanting it to be.\n\nSecond Mistake: She offered a roll that was neither on the menu nor on the specials menu board. Because it seemed that all the rolls were around or under $10, I did not bat an eyelash at her suggestion. After all, it was another fairly simple roll (A 49er roll).\n\nThird Mistake: I asked for low sodium soy sauce. I prefer it because the less salt means the flavor of the fish is not over powered by the salty regular soy sauce.  She brought me regular, and even my company agreed it was NOT low sodium. What if i were not able to consume high amounts of sodium do to medication or health reasons? \n\nFourth mistake: When the bill was brought to us, we had already stated at the beginning of our meal that we would need to split it (only in two bills), and she did not. When we looked at the bill, she had charged us $15.99 for the 49er roll!! Never have I paid that much for such a simple roll at a place that averaged $10 for a roll!!\n\nFifth Mistake: She refused to put less than $20 on a credit card, when clearly you walk in the doors, and there are TWO huge stickers on the door stating they take Visa and MasterCard, with NO \"minimum limit\" anywhere!! Not even on the menu as far as I can tell.  So we have to fish out our last cash (which we needed to get into the club), and could not leave a tip. \n\nWhile the fish was fresh, it was not enough for me to say anything nice about this place!!  There are far better places to spend your money on sushi in SF!!  \n\nDont give these guys your biz!", "author": "Christelle M."}

It was a *little* bigger than your average Chirashi order but nothing too special.  Yes, it was fresh and tasty but nothing spectacular.  Standard sushi (i.e. 2 pieces) is probably $0.50 - $1 more expensive than most other places.\n\nWhich brings to light the menu.  It's decent but it doesn't seem to have some of the options other places have.

There was an empty table for four, but I was told that since there were only two of us we had to wait.  15 minutes later (and starving - its was 9:00 pm) we were finally seated.  20 minutes later a group of 3 assho...err...I mean...people came in and were seated at the precious table.  \n\nWhile I sort of understand the whole efficiency aspect of it all, it was late on a weeknight and I likely would have been done eating by the time the larger group came (did I mention I eat sushi faster than I drink water?).  Also another large table opened up shortly after the table for 3 came in.  \n\nThis happened over a year ago and I still want to go on a wild rampage of revenge.

Service was good, but we really couldn't figure out why everything cost so much. \n\nOne novel thing on the menu is the Ume shiso roll, which has an intensely salty and sweet taste of preserved plum - not for the faint of heart.  Also, one roll we ordered had huge chunks of eel on top - probably more eel than you normally get on a roll (but I'd rather pay less and get the normal amount of eel).\n\nOur meal did not come with edamame or miso soup, which are each about $2 pp extra.

I ordered pretty standard fare (two avo maki, an ume-cucumber maki, some edamame) my companion ordered some sashimi. I wanted to order some agedashi tofu and after a little back-and-forth (I wanted to check if there was any fish/fish oil/bonito chunks the size of my fist that come standard) we found out it wasn't vegan and skipped it. That's fine, my specific-diet having ass is plenty stoked on an avo roll and I'll eat your kid's stroller if it has ume on it. \n\nTwo super simple veggie rolls, one edamame, an order of sashimi. We drank water. \n\nOur bill? $50 (plus tip). \n\nI literally did a double take, thinking that we got the wrong bill. I'm no dope - I know that sashimi is expensive, but I normally don't check the prices like a hawk in casualish restaurants like this. I'm also not a cheapskate - I love living beyond my means and eating a good meal that costs me a lot. However, this was not that meal. The quality of the sashimi (according to my non-vegan companion) was \"ok\". He didn't order anything special like Toro from The Land Before Time nor did my rolls cause my mind to melt with their amazingness. It is the first time I have felt like I should have been paying better attention to the menu prices though, which is too bad because based on the service (not terrible but not positive) and atmosphere I would have gauged that as a $30 meal for two.

Wanted Japanese food, me and two other friends went inside. \n\nThe lady whom I believed the owner gave us a dinner menu with everything about three to four dollars more. She hesitated when being confronted the reason that a dinner menu was presented. We insisted to have the lunch menu because it was lunch. Not expressing herself well, we did not have a clue what she was trying to explain... maybe she was trying to make up stuff like they don't serve the lunch menu on a Sunday's brunch time? Bad taste if that's the case. \n\n$17 for a rainbow roll and as my friend said I should make sure I lick the plate. Sounded \"unclassy\" but the portion was small and fishes tasted like water. We ordered three small rolls and one special roll and the total came out of $44. \n\nThe lady asked if everything was okay whilst presenting the check and I recommended very nicely that with their pricing, they should make sure that the food portion was big. She was offended by telling me that they have been in the business for THIRTEEN years which, to be frank, I was speechless and to tell you that it was just my personal opinion.\n\nSo we went on Yelp on our way back to the car, and only to find out that they just recently acquired that restaurant which HAD very good reputation and basically I think they had ruined it. MY suggestion to them is that if they don't know Yelp or any social media which are how people review businesses nowadays, go online and read their reviews. It is critical to accept comments when the business is still new. Don't lie to people that you have been in the business for 13 years because you have not, the previous owner who did a fantastic job on the place did.

He prepares mouth-watering sushi and also wonderful conversation. The fish is super fresh. I would highly recommend the toro and the hamachi. The toro literally melts in your mouth. Yoko San prepares some awesome combinations by adding additions such as apricot sauce to his creations. The cooked food is very good too. They have this grilled fish appetizer that is so tender and tasty. The service is amazing. They brought us edamame and tea as we were waiting for our seats at the sushi bar. One bad thing is that parking is very difficult in the neighborhood, but I think it's well worth it for the quality of sushi you get from Grandeho.", "author": "Vanessa W."}

It was a little late (probably around 8pm) but we easily slipped right in at the sushi bar.  The rolls aren't the craziest combinations in the world but they're AMAZING.  The spicy tuna wasn't mired in a sticky mayo mess...it was very clean and tasty.  The hamachi delight was also a real treat but the rainbow roll took the cake.  Surprisingly for me, we really fell in love with the nigiri.  Whereas most sushi joints give you a small, wafer-thin slice of fish, these guys used big, fat, fresh slices.\n\nOn top of the fish, the service was great...the chefs were extremely nice and were more than happy to share a beer on our behalf, and the hostess joked with us all night like we'd been in there a thousand times.\n\nIf I could give this place 10 stars, I would.  It was a bit pricey but you pay for what you get.  The food was great and the atmosphere and service made us feel like family.

The first time I ate there the food was mediocre. The rolls were stuffed with dry rice, and the fish tasted like it had swam south a good time ago. I remember waiting for 20 mins or so just to pay the check. Tonight I was there, aparantly just before closing time, and they opted to serve me food without stressing the severity of closing time. They stole the soy sauce, the edemame and then turned the lights out while I was eating. Yeah, and the food wasn't very good either. I gave it a second chance only because it is across the street from my house, and because some jackhole called it the best sushi place in SF. You sir, are a liar and a  drunk. Don't do it friend.

We stopped going for about a year and then decided to give them another chance, only to discover that the sushi had gone downhill (and the hoes even more grumpy).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-09-19", "description": "First, the review part:\n\nGrandeho's is a small, friendly, sushi restaurant that makes most things well, and some things excellently.  Your best bet is to sit at the front of the bar when Yoko-san is there (Tues, Wed, Fri, Sat) as he's skilled and friendly -- and his selection of fish is fantastic.  We've eaten almost everything on the menu over the years.  The misoyaki fish (homemade marinated black cod) and hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail cheek) are both excellent choices for appetizers.  The standards are always good; my wife swears by the hotate (scallop), while I'm a fan of the anago (sea eel -- not the teriyaki basted stuff).\n\nThe staff has always been friendly, and over the years we've introduced dozens of people to the restaurant, all of whom have been extremely pleased.  There's often a wait to sit at the front of the bar when Yoko-san is serving, so clearly the word is out.\n\nThis is my first Yelp review, because all of the restaurants that I've checked out here were pretty thoughtfully written up, and I agree with what people say.  But I just read Alyssa F.'s write-up of Grandeho's, and I'm pretty sure she's got the wrong restauraunt.  We've been coming here for seven years, and have never gotten mints with the check; a complementary dessert is always a few pieces of fruit, occasionally with a drizzle of condensed milk.  There is a sushi restaurant around the corner -- maybe that's the source of the confusion?\n\nAs for whether or not this is \"real\" Japanese food, I've lived in Japan, and (shocker) things are different in San Francisco.  I've had the best sushi of my life at 7AM at Tskuiji, and yeah, that's good stuff.  You can't get that here, just like you can't get a decent sourdough loaf of bread outside the Bay Area -- too many differences to replicate the experience.  So when maria d. wants something \"resembling Japanese food,\" don't look for it in Cole Valley -- duh!  If the ambiance is what you want, head to Japantown, and get your fix on in that most glorified food court.\n\nGrandeho's does what the best transplanted ethnic restaurants do: take the best ingredients available, and turn them into something inspired, delightful and unique.  The inspiration comes from sushi, but the magic, as always, is in the hands of the chef.  Trust in Yoko-san's acumen, and you'll not be dissapointed.  In seven years, neither we, nor our many guests, have ever been.\n\nI should point out that at some point, we've eaten at just about all the other sushi restaurants in walking distance of UCSF (Cole Valley and the Inner Sunset).  Highlights are as follows: If you're looking to pay more, head to Ebisu.  Tell yourself that your empty wallet meant you had a great meal -- because it was good, no question -- but pricey.  Creativity can be found at Koo; fish there is good, and the presentation is lovely.  And if you confuse authenticity with attitude, there's Tekka on Balboa.  \n\nThanks for reading!", "author": "David S."}

California Roll (boring, I know) and Spicy Tuna for the carnivore and Shitake Roll and Tempura Veg Roll for the herbivore. The Shitake Roll was, I grant, fairly inventive and, for us lovers of fungus, nice to see on the menu. Not fabulous, but not bad. Same for the Veggie Tempura Roll. California Roll was reported to have real crab, which, I guess, is not always the case, but the real deal here. The Spicy Tuna was said to have a slightly different spiciness/flavor than the many, many Spicy Tuna Rolls devoured by the resident carnivore at other sushi places. Again, though, not really amazing. In other words, it is simply good sushi. Now, that probably doesn't play well for most, and, honestly, I would not go out of my way to get sushi here. The rolls were rather small in my experience and for their size, a tad on the pricey side. It happens to be convenient and consistent.

I was lured in because they had a nice table on the sidewalk and it was a rare, warm SF night. I glanced at the empty tables inside and decided not to risk ordering any raw fish, as I was worried that the fish might not be too fresh. I figured I would be safe if I ordered only cooked items. I ordered the beef sukiyaki and tempura, which was disgusting. The slices of beef tasted old - it had not been marinated and had been cooked to the point where it was both rubbery and powdery - I don't know how a restaurant can manage to do that simultaneously. There were some gross vegetables dumped on top - the carrots were so old they looked dried and had cracks in it, the green onions they put on top were wilty. I was so hungry I might have eaten it if it had been smothered in a tasty sauce, but even the sauce wasn't palatable. It's been a long time since I've gone someplace extremely hungry, ordered something with absolutely zero expectations as to how it might be (I've never ordered sukiyaki before), but geez, I think asking for something to be at least palatable isn't asking for much. My husband ordered the chicken teriyaki and it looked okay, lumps of chicken breast smothered in teriyaki sauce, but methinks $49 bucks for dinner that looks like it came out of a cheap Chinese take-out place is horrendous.
