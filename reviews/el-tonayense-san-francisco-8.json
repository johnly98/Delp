Two moist tasty corn tortillas support a mound of juicy succulent meat with the most incredible smoky/spicy sauce generously drizzled on top along with some minced onion.  Several slivers of pickled jalape\u00f1o pepper and radish plus slices of lime on the plate to add even more flavors.  The guacamole sauce lends yet another layer of flavor plus reduces the heat a bit.  Better than anything from a 5-star pricy sit-down restaurant.  Delicious!

Unlike the one that parks on 22nd and Harrison, this truck is located on a dark street corner without tables and chairs. I contemplated for a while before settling for a tripa and carnita tacos for $1.75 each. Even though it's still El Toyanese, the vibe was radically different as there was no one walking around within that three block radius. It was pitch black and all quiet but the two guys in the truck. Instead of walking away my anticipation was upheld by a red flier posted on their window to assure that they are Yelp approved. \n\nBy the first look of my tacos, they were huge and juicy with two layers of tortillas to keep the stacks of meat and salsa intact. The hot salsa was noticeably thicker than the other truck, and the sight of these pickled jalapenos was just magnificent. I was ready to dig in. I've been ready all day. This is what greasy messy spicy foodilicious tacos were all about. As it turns out, looks and the actual taste were a world apart. Both the tripa and carnita were way over-fried to which the carnita was dry without much redeeming value while the tripa was tough and noticeably soaked in grease for too long. I thought the salsa was decent but it did not have any effect in bringing some sort of balance to these super oily tacos. Portions were generous but I literally thought I was eating lard.\n\nThere's a good chance that I might have ordered the wrong things since I didn't see other reviewers talk about their tripa. On the other hand, Tom R. did warned me about their big head syndrome from yelp exposure so I think this may be a case in point of an over hyped truck that has since raised its price while letting its quality slip to the deep end. 2 stars for the food and another half star for cleanliness. Yelp may approve the truck, but I won't recommend it.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Don't hate me because I'm dutiful.  \n\nThe thing is, El Tonayense is a 5-star choice for the taco lover... who eats meat.

These guys do a yumaaaaazing fish taco-- but only on Fridays.\n\nTo be fair, these trucks are insanely clean, have efficient, friendly service, and serve up grilled meats that the carnivores LOVE.  The Mr. uses grand hand gestures to describe the carne asada taco.  And the salsa here is so much his beloved that taco sauce anywhere else that dares to be green will inevitably feel his wrath: \"This is NOTHING like the taco truck. Blech!\"  (Yeah, we call it \"the taco truck,\" because after all these years we still can't pronounce the name.)\n\nSo that's the deal.

The meat was well prepared and had good flavor/texture. The tortilla was fresh and the overall eating experience was very pleasing. It was just the right sized burrito -- nothing too hefty and filled with a good proportion of meat, rice, and beans. I could have gone for more salsa and cheese in the burrito but am not too picky so long as it tastes good, which it did. I'd consider trying El T. again but maybe not at an Earthquakes match (see below)..\n\nThere are a couple things I'm puzzled about to say the least. First, I originally asked for a torta, but the guy taking orders said they weren't making any. But the menu had tortas on there and hadn't been crossed out. Next, I asked for a beverage but was then told they weren't selling beverages...when they've got dozens of beverages sitting there. They didn't have any signs for this, which sucks if you're waiting in line for a while. Lastly, when I went to pay the $8 for my burrito, I handed the cashier a 20. He then told me they didn't have change for it. If it weren't for my friend who had two 10s, I would not have been able to afford my burrito and would have stood in line and placed my order for nothing.

They dish the cow out from sesos, cachete and lengua to simply carne asada, and BBQ and grill the shit out of chicken and pork goodness. Spicy, juicy and flavorful. The tacos come piled high with salsa verde, fresh onion and cilantro. The only thing that would carry my eye roll any higher would be a nice chunk of radish to accompany my $1.75 pockets of awesome.\n\nThe folks there are damn friendly.

Remembered reading about this one on Yelp and figured it was close enough to lunch to give it a shot.\n\nI was a bit disappointed. Ordered three tacos...pastor, carnitas and lengua (my gauge when trying a taco truck). Pretty skimpy on the meat portions, and the watered-down salsa must have been made using the \"pulverize\" setting on the Cuisinart. Also, they seemed to be serving the white corn tortillas. Don't know if that's a regular thing, but my preference is for the standard yellow corn when it comes to taco stands. Service or lack thereof was a non-factor.\n\nAnd then there's the $1.75/ea vs. the $1/ea standard that is the norm with these kind of fine eateries. The $1 tacos I get when the craving strikes at Ruddy's (see my previous review) kill these. Even Angelica's (also $1) is noticeably better. They taste better and cost 42% less. Of course, neither are in the city, and the price IS what the market will bear. \n\nIF these tacos were $1, my rating would go up to 3-stars which I define as \"average\" on a 5-star scale (as opposed to Yelp's \"A-OK\").\n\nPrice not being a factor, if you really like good tacos, take a drive 10 minutes south of here and check out the options.
