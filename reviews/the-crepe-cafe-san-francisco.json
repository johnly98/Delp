I was a tourist who didn't want to spend a lot on dinner. I wanted something super simple and easy.\n\nThe workers taking orders and cutting veggies were playing around with each other and throwing out the f-bomb as if the place were empty. It took about a minute for them to come over and take my order. I stood awkwardly looking around in front of the register. \n\nThere were 2 slices of deli turkey slices slabbed on a bed of shredded cheese with 2 chunks of avocado. The pesto was incredibly salty and had the straight-from-a-jar taste. I was nauseous the rest of the night.\n\nI would not come back.", "author": "Dana M."}

Now, under normal circumstances, an employee would apologize and offer something else, a refund etc.  This girl laughed in this man's face, said, \"really, well i like it\" then turned and walked away from him, the man was shocked at what had happened and just shook his head,as if asking himself \"did that just happen?\"\n\nDo yourself a favor and don't bother - it's overpriced and you get bullshit with your order.", "author": "Basilia C."}

I know, crepes and fries sounds weird, but it works for this place pretty well. And believe me, their fries are delicious! The crepe was savory, with cheddar and feta cheeses, spinach, and onions. My only suggestion would be to saut\u00e9 the spinach, because it was just fresh spinach thrown on the crepe- not that I'm complaining, because trust me it was delicious, but I think it would be even better with saut\u00e9ed spinach. \n\nThe fries were cooked fresh, and were hot, crispy in the outside and soft on the inside.

I have decided to leave my crepe cooking  up to the professionals. \n\nWe brought a couple of crepes (the Ghiradelli Chocolate and Strawberries Crepe the and Nutella and Strawberries Crepe) to enjoy back at the hotel room. Sadly, after a full day of rich food my stomach became really upset (Cowgirl Creamery grilled cheese sandwiches, Codmother fish 'n chips, Peet's caramel blended iced coffee, an empanada from Tanguito's and a couple of oysters from the Fish Market). \n\nI took one bite because I didn't want to waste it.

You will probably encounter a little wait (we waited about 20 minutes) but they keep the cafe very toasty warm so the wait inside isn't too bad.

I asked for a refund and left. All they had to do was cook it a little longer on both sides no different then cooking fries a little longer to make them crispy. It's VERY simple .... As the commercial says, even a caveman can do it!\n\n The crepe was a 1 and the bad customer service and attitude was -5 \n\nMy date drove me here all the way from Hayward so I could have my favorite crepeI didn't know it came with a free side of nasty attitude and bad service.", "author": "Felicia E."}

They just moved here from Paris about three years ago. They actually live in my apartment complex. Wait, never mind that's a different French family. \n\nWhen the chef flipped the crepes, it ended up looking like a tortilla. I thought I was here for crepes, not a burrito.

We didn't have to walk for long before we stumbled upon this little cottage like cafe in the heart of a plaza near Pier 39. A couple of us had the hawaiian crepe, and one of my friends had the chicken one. The hawaiian crepe was simple enough, with cheese, ham, and pineapple, but it was delicious nonetheless. The chicken crepe was good as well, but I wasn't a big fan of the cheese. But that's just me, because I'm not a huge cheese enthusiast.\n\nThe price wasn't super cheap, but it wasn't too expensive either. It's a nice place to stop and have a quick breakfast, but it's not really a 'sit down and enjoy your breakfast' type place. It kind of has the feel of a fast food environment for some reason, I can't really put my finger on it. The food is good though, give it a shot.", "author": "Yong L."}

With my new office in Fisherman's Wharf, I've been adjusting my expectations a lot lately.\n\nThe Chicken Special with spinach, red onion, tomatoes, and jack cheese is quite tasty. They use real breast meat, not processed-chicken-food-product, and they cook the whole thing fresh just for you. (Notice that many of the Paris street vendors don't do this, they precook them. Hey, maybe we can compare!) The Crepe Cafe even offers a discount for folks that work on the wharf, so a big filling crepe with fries and a drink still comes in at $8 and change.\n\nI've had mixed experiences with the staff. On busy summer days, they can be a little brisk, but just today we had a delightful conversation with  a guy that explained what a cordless power-drill is doing on the shelf behind the counter with the other cooking implements (hint: powerdrill + paint mixer = $40, commercial mixer = $400).\n\nThey've never messed up my order, and they get bonus points for having an Icee machine along with the regular soda fountain (white cherry and blue raspberry, thanks for asking!).\n\nThe fries are good and very fresh since they're made to order. The dipping sauces... well.... the honey mustard tasted more like corn-syrup than either honey or mustard. The ranch and the jalapeno ketchup on the other hand are both quite tasty.

I'm just not used to the fact that you can stuff meat and cheese into crepes and still call it a crepe. Crepes are meant to be for desserts. Right? \n\nWell I tried the chicken crepe. It was good. It wasn't horribly disgusting. It was just okay. It felt really odd to be eating cheese and chicken and a crepe. I mean it just didn't feel normal. I wouldn't order it again. I mean some people think it's normal, but I would like to stick with crepes being desserts please.\n\nMe and my ex boyfriend always come to SF specifically for shopping and tourist attractions. We made it a tradition to always come here for the crepes. He is a big fan of crepes. We've tried them all, from tiny milk tea cafes to ones in Monterey. Nope, they just don't cut it. Here is the BEST crepes you can get. Seriously. Just cause they use the same nutella, it doesn't mean they all taste the same...\n\nOur original consists of: nutella, strawberries and bananas. They have many fruit ones. Dessert crepes range from just plain nutella or just powdered sugar or with just fruit. You can make up something in your head and they will accommodate you. You won't be disappointed. Once you see how packed the place is and the staff making crepes in front of your face, you can't help to try it. Oh and smell sucks you right in. \n\nThis place is a MUST try. It just ain't some tourist attraction. They literally have the BEST crepes here. You'll fall in love if you haven't had before.", "author": "Katie C."}

Sweet or savory, bring it on.\n\nA little about my own life: I thought crepes were just thin pancakes, or hotcakes as I knew them when I was growing up. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nI have been to several creperies in Socal. They were good to OK. Some are great, some, not so, but all in all, good. There's a saying that compares an intimate act to pizza. I compare the same intimate act to crepes; even if it's bad, it can still be good.\n\nHad the Ham and Cheese crepe from nice little quaint place in Fisherman's Wharf amidst all the overpriced seafood. It came with pommes frites, just another name for french fries and a drink. Boy, they don't skimp on the ham at all. It had layers and layers of it! The crepe was nice and tender, not at all overcooked and dry. \n\nNever tried the sweet ones, but Nutella seems to be a favored spread used for crepes. Hey, it's delicious, how could they not favor it? If you don't find the correct combo you want on either the savory or sweet side, just make your own up to four ingredients for less than 10 clams.\n\nI love this place, I won't hesitate to go back to this place, even amidst all the other things that beg you to taste them, including chocolates, mini donuts and a place that sells a ton of salt water taffy.", "author": "Alex L."}

Crepes here are generously large and two layers, which I appreciate. It's filled with slices of strawberries and has a little too much chocolate...but every single chocolate crepe i've ever had always had too much chocolate. \n\nFor a tourist place, prices and portion size are very fair. Stuff like this can cost up to 12 bucks at a tourist location.\n\nInterior is nothing to boast about. Service is fine but not exceptional. I enjoy getting a crepe and then walking down to the end of the pier.\n\n5 stars because of all the crepe places i've been to, this place has the largest crepes by far, and pricing is fair.

And the fact that you get to see them actually make them adds to the experience. The only complaint is that they do not really have a wide variety of crepes but that's understandable considering their size. I highly recommend this place for a nice eat on your day out in san francisco.", "author": "P S."}
