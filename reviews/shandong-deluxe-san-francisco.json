The staff is mostly non -english speaking. Mandarin is the main language spoken here and unless they you speak their tongue it's really hard to communicate with them. When I came here there was no line and we should of been the first on the list. Due to their disorganisation they didn't cross the names before us and so they kept looking for them. When people started coming they seated parties who came after us cause they were Mandarin speaking. \n\n\nAnyway we finally got seated and we ordered mapo tofu, Xianjian noodle, and beef pancake. Out of all 3 the pancake came out decent. The chicken and veggies in the Xian noodles came out tasting slightly raw and tasted like they could of Cooked it more. The mapo tofo had a strong herb taste to it. I've had mapo tofu at other restaurants and it tasted light, buttery smooth, and pleasant to eat not tangy like this one. \n\n\nAll in all don't see myself coming back here since the food is rather mediocre and house of pancakes is across the street and has much better service and food by far than Shandong Deluxe.", "author": "Jude N."}

Having been to a lot more places since then, i hate to say it, but this had a few too many issues compared to other chinese noodles places in the area. Some of the dishes are reasonable, but there are a lot of misses as well. The noodles and dumplings are probably worth checking out if you're in the area, so this could be worth it if you dont get the other stuff and are willing to put up with poor service. \n\nPork and mustard green noodle soup - 4/5. After all these years, at least the noodles are still good quality. A little too soft for my liking, but still pretty chewy and springy like I remember it back in the day. The pork was nice and soft, but any other flavoring the soup had was masked by how much salt they put into the soup. This made the soup and flavors feel very one note, which was disappointing. I do think the noodles are solid though, so this gets a reasonable rating regardless since I love noodles.\n\nPork and cabbage dumplings - 4/5. Juicy and on point despite being a bit salty. Similar to how my mom makes them, which makes this pretty authentic.\n\nLamb skewers - 2.5/5. Texture was okay, but it came to the table lukewarm... the spices were also didnt have much flavor to it, which is very different from the skewers youd get in china.\n\nCabbage/shrimp thing - 2/5. Parents insisted we get this, but wasnt a huge fan. All I could really taste here was cabbage and salt, but I suppose I don't really like shrimp to begin with.\n\nFried green onion pancake- 2.5/5. Flavor was okay, but this literally fell apart as we were eating it, which I didnt think could happen with green onion pancake... (in not a good way) this was also on the softer side rather than the crispy side, which is more of a preference.\n\nTea - 2/5. I dont normally bring up the tea since it's fairly standard, but it was lukewarm when it arrived to our table.", "author": "Nevin L."}

The wait at House of Pancakes was 5 parties deep and 30 - 45 minutes, saw that this place was known for their hand-pulled noodles and decided to try it out.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty old school Chinese, so don't expect super attentive and warm service. I ordered the spicy beef noodle stew and garlic green beans. The noodles themselves were very good--you could tell by the texture and consistency that they were hand pulled and fresh. The beef was okay, tender but without a ton of flavor. The broth and soup were a letdown. You could tell the spicy flavor came from a sauce that was just dumped in to spice up the soup. This flavor completely overpowered the rest of the broth and even made it taste slightly sour, which is not how a Chinese beef noodle stew is supposed to taste.\n\nThe garlic green beans were very good. Overall, this place is cheap and the noodles are good. Maybe another noodle dish would've been better.

The restaurant is small but the wait is usually not more than 15 minutes when we come at our usual Sunday lunchtime. \n\nShanghai steam pao (D1, $4.95) - this is their XLB, comes with six. Taste is good but they over-steamed them today, which made it difficult to lift out of the steamer without breaking them (btw - self-proclaimed chopstick pro over here). The metal steamer's bottom has a sparse lattice structure and because the XLB was cooked too long, the dumpling skin sunk into them and started sticking to them despite the paper layer underneath designed to keep this from happening. If this is how they usually cook their soup dumplings, then I wouldn't order it again...seeing all that good XLB soup escape to anywhere other than my mouth is a small tragedy.\n\nBeef wrap (D8, $6.95) - such a great deal for a large portion of the beef wrap. My dad always orders this. Comes with a lot of onions and cilantro in it though, so just a heads up if you're not a fan. I pick all of my cilantro out lol.\n\nXian cold noodle (E1, $6.00) - this is awesome. Apparently the wait staff puts this dish together (not the kitchen) with a variety of sauces, so the taste each time depends on the ratio of sauces the waiter or waitress mixes for your dish. Today it was really good. It was the perfect amount of spicy to make it more flavorful without making your mouth feel like it's on fire, and there's some vinegar for a sour kick that's not overpowering. The dish comes with cold noodles, cucumber, cilantro, bean sprouts, and chopped peanuts. We mix it all together before eating. \n\nComb spicy seafood, chicken, pork noodle (E7, $7.95) - this is also great, and comes in a big bowl without skimping on the meats. The seafood in here includes shrimp, octopus, and fish fillets. There are also mushrooms and red and green bell peppers. The kitchen does a great job of blending the spicy and sour flavors into the soup, and the noodles are a great bouncy texture. Def a fan of this.\n\nOwner and wait staff are friendly, food is good, space is clean enough for this type of Chinese restaurant. This spot would have four stars from me if not for the XLB breaking all over the place. Will order it again next time and update my review accordingly.", "author": "Nicole M."}

I always passed by the restaurant and was curious to try the food. We got a small table in front of the cashier. It wasn't very comfortable, but the restaurant was small. The first red flag was that the waitress used a dirty towel, which was dropped to the ground, to wipe our table. She did not even apologize and think about getting a new towel. (Other waitresses used the same dirty towel to clean other tables. This is very not hygienic!) My sister and I tried flagging down the waitress, but she refused to make eye contacts with us. Finally, she came to our table and take our orders (Shanghai Dumplings, Spicy Mopo Tofu, and Vegetable Soup Noodle). While we waited for our food, I noticed two families came inside: one family of six and one family of three. These two families got their food first before we got our first dish, which was the noodle soup. I was already irritated at this point, but I didn't want to make a big scene. My sister and I kept eating our food. Fifty minutes into eating, I was shocked we still hadn't gotten our Shanghai Dumplings! Fifty minutes. I flagged down the waitress and asked where the dumplings were. I actually asked her to cancel the order, which I rarely do when I am dining out. She came back to our table and said that the dumplings were being steamed. At this moment, I knew the waitress had forgotten our order. How long does it take to steam dumplings??? I asked her when the dumplings would be ready. She pretended she didn't understand me. She didn't even apologize for her mistake! My sister was honest and rejected the dumplings. At this moment, I noticed the two families already finished eating and left the restaurant! Unbelievable. Terrible service. Rude. Unprofessional. My sister and I did not have a good experience here.

The restaurant was small and a little crowded, and we were seated right away. The servers spoke Mandarin, and we spoke Cantonese so communication was a little spotty, but nothing too major. The first thing I noticed when we were seated and given the plates and utensils was that the plates were not the same size. My plate size was bigger than my brother's and the inconsistency of the plate size kind of bothered me. The seating was also tight, since the tables were all close together. We ordered 6 dishes for the 6 of us.\n\nFood:\n\n- Xiao long bao: The xiao long bao was kind of small. It was also overcooked, since the soupy goodness came out and wasn't in the dumplings when we ate it.\n\n- Potstickers: The potstickers were big and delicious, though it didn't have that nice crispy bottom from when you panfry them, and the skin was a little soggy.\n\n- Green onion pancakes: There was not a lot of green onions. This pancake was thin and crispy, which I liked, but I wish there was a bit more dough in the pancakes.\n\n- Beef tendon noodle soup: The noodle soup broth was light and not too heavy, though there wasn't much flavoring. However, the beef tendon was nice and soft and tender. The noodles were super long, and we had to ask one of the servers to come and cut it for us, since it was hard to dish the long noodles in the bowls.\n\n- Beef chow fun: The noodles were oily and not crispy enough. There was a lot of bean sprouts (I love bean sprouts), but the ratio of beef and noodles to bean sprouts was way off, with too many bean sprouts and not enough beef and noodles.\n\n- Garlic green beans: The green beans had enough garlic, though the green beans themselves were kind of soggy and not crispy.\n\nAnother major thing that I noticed was that when we were served the food, no serving utensils were given to us. Maybe it was kind of like \"every man for themselves\" and everyone was supposed to get the food with their own chopsticks, but I just wished they gave us serving utensils so it was easier to dish out the food.

I'm pretty sure I've been to at least a third of them now and to me, none of them have stood out from the rest. I was pretty excited to try Shandong Deluxe as I had already missed an opportunity to do so many moons ago. Let me tell you this; go earlier than traditional lunch time noon hours as you'll be waiting if your party is greater than 2. It got packed quick but luckily I was smugly sitting my table already.  \n\nThey have a semi open kitchen and you can see them cooking up food and putting it on the counter for the wait staff to bring it out. We started with the fish filets in spicy chili oil and it was presented in Paul Bunyan's soup cup. Tons of Sichuan peppers and fresh peppercorns provided a kick but it wasn't overwhelming. I wish their had been more fish than vegetables though. We also got their seafood and meat combo noodles that I thought would be stir-fried but instead came with some odd looking tomato like broth. Not bad but not great either.  The dumplings, which were pan fried but can be steamed, were humongous. It reminded me of the Vietnamese banh bao in terms of girth and dough to filling ratio. I had one and it was delicious with their home made hot sauce. I would recommend skipping the beef roll pancake though. Too much hoisin and not enough flavors of beef.\n\nI'm big on having competition for most things in life, with food being my most passionate to date. It gives me an excuse to continue looking for the best since this was only 3 stars for me.", "author": "Quoc N."}

For Shandong Deluxe, their forte is the handmade noodles and it's something I keep coming back for.\n\nI first tried this place on a whim about two years ago and was instantly hooked on their spicy beef noodle soup, more specifically their delicious noodles found in said soup. When picking up the noodles, I always notice how each strand is strikingly different. The imperfections from hand pulling creates a variety of thin and thick noodles that provide a nice contrast in textures and gives each bite a unique mouthfeel. I've had this dish elsewhere and their noodles are always identical, and uniformity is boring. The broth is also very flavorful, with a good balance between spicy and savory.\n\nI always order a few items when I come here and that's so I can see what goes well with the spicy beef noodle soup. While the dumplings aren't the best I've had, they are a great side to compliment the main course. For pairing, I recommend the pork with napa cabbage or chicken with corn as the subtle sweetness from the cabbage and corn goes well with the spicy broth. Their beef pancake and pan fried buns are okay, but the former is a bit too greasy and the latter is too doughy for my liking. Maybe I'll try dipping them in the soup next time, I'll have to report back. For about $9, it's hard to beat a bowl of soup with delicious handmade noodles. Give it a try!", "author": "Philip W."}

I knew finally it's our turn for the next call.\n\nA lady from the restaurant came outside, she showed 2 fingers which I guessed \"2 people\".\nI approached her, told her that it would be us.  She just ignored me and talked another couple whom came after us in Chinese, then let them bring inside for seating.  I guess she doesn't speak any English, which is still OK, but she even didn't bothered to bring the white board to see or just simply try to communicate to us.\n\nI was very upset especially after long waiting in hot sunny sidewalk. \nThey have English menu, but WTF, don't show the menu in English if you don't care other than Chinese.", "author": "Manatee T."}

I can't say that this place is mind blowing but it meets all my criteria for \"mom's comfort food.\" \n\nI had the fennel dumplings, pan-fried bread (\u751f\u714e\u5305), and beef noodle soup (\u725b\u8169\u9eb5). \n\nFennel dumplings: it was a great take for a toned down version of the traditional chive dumpling (\u97ed\u83dc\u6c34\u9903). The fennel flavor was subtle enough where I didn't feel like I was eating a savory licorice dumpling but strong enough to complement the chives. The dumplings however were a little overcooked. \n\nPan-fried bread: not the best take on this dish but it wasn't bad. I would say it's just about average. Contrary to the dumplings, this dish could have been pan fried a bit longer to achieve that delicious crispy bottom. The filling was pretty good and didn't give me an oily mouth-feel. \n\nBeef noodle soup: the specialty of this place are their hand-pulled noodles (\u624b\u62c9\u9eb5) as to which I must agree. Their noodles were perfectly cooked and still tasted great when I ate my leftovers the next day. This was the definition of homey comfort food. The flavors weren't mind-blowing and 5-star status but eating it reminded me of the flavors I grew up with. I would totally order this dish again when I'm missing home.", "author": "Victoria C."}

I guess it was my fault to blame that I imagined this dish to be similar to San Tung chicken wings. Well, at least having somewhat of a familiar taste. However, the chicken wings were just fried with little pieces of bell peppers and onions - basically just tasted like it was cooked with salt and pepper. \n\nI have tried their noodles before and I must say, those are the better dishes offered from this restaurant. \n\nService:  \nTwo chefs, two waiters, ten tables of customers, what do you expect?

Two tables down, I hear a table of four complaining that they had been waiting for more than 30 minutes, yet no food had been served. Meanwhile, a table that had arrived later than them had their dishes delivered already. No apologies mentioned, nothing but shy aways.

I don't know if all the workers speak mandarin, but the one we got did and while my mom's good at speaking it, the girl was still a bit slow to understand. Which isn't a problem, but she just stood there looking at us at first and it was awkward. And through the rest of dinner, I noticed that not one single server actually attempted to smile or be nice. They were like robots writing down orders, cleaning tables, and bring food out. That's it. Think of those workers at Quickly's, but in a restaurant setting instead. \n\nFood is eh. Their pig ears are good in my opinion and so are their dumplings, but that beef wrap and green onion pancake were bad. The pancakes were too oily and the beef wrap lack sauce to improve the taste.

Not only are they family owned/operated (I think the father and son work the kitchen while the mom and daughter work the tables), but their size certainly qualifies as \"small\"!  House of Pancakes up the street may be smaller, but seating here is just as tight and limited.  Just ask the people who had to slide in out of their seats so that the people at the neighboring table could get out...\n\nWith a menu that leans towards Northern Chinese cuisine, the vast majority of Shandong Deluxe's dishes revolve around dumplings and noodles.  However, they do offer a few staples from other Chinese cuisines (like Xiao Long Baos).  Still, my family and I were more interested in trying their specialties:\n\n-- SALT & PEPPER FRIED TOFU...$5.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shandong-deluxe-san-francisco#o7IfCb2v24QebqmazCE6wQ)\nThe portion was a pleasant surprise, and I liked the crisp batter, but the dish was underseasoned.  Not that I would want a ton of salt/MSG, but the tofu was really bland, which was only exacerbated by the fact that there were so many pieces.\n\n-- SHEN JIAN BAO - Pan Fried Pork Dumplings...$4.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shandong-deluxe-san-francisco#HrDs0ocIp3boMbZf4TKHVw)\nAlthough it's a Shanghainese dish, I had to try it.  The skin had a nice thickness and there was a good amount of filling, but the meat just wasn't that flavorful. It's still not bad overall, but it doesn't come close to my favorite down the street (Dumpling Kitchen).\n\n-- PORK DUMPLINGS WITH NAPA CABBAGE...$5.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shandong-deluxe-san-francisco#MGLI_kwAUQflWl9qYQifNg)\nSee above.  While the dumplings were just as plump, the filling also fell short.  I don't know if there was too much cabbage or lean meat, but the pork just wasn't that juicy.  Still, it's not like they were bad (I liked them better than the Shen Jian Baos).\n\n-- BEEF STEW NOODLE SOUP...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shandong-deluxe-san-francisco#fQGzbeZXJohvGwgr5rjxGw)\nProbably the highlight of the night.  The beef was mostly tender and I thought the noodles terrific (the consistency was perfect).  Even though the broth could have been \"beefier\", I liked how it was slightly peppery.\n\nAlthough none of our dishes may have overwhelmed us, I can't say we had any complaints about the experience either.  The wait wasn't bad, service was nice, and prices were quite friendly.  There may be better restaurants in the area, but Shandong Deluxe deserves some praise for putting out decent food at great prices.

Dumplings are alright, not amazing or anything. They have some interesting dumplings like the sea cucumber dumpling. Curious but nah. They have this dish called Xinjiang Style Chicken with Noodle that is worth trying. It's a spicy dish, so avoid if you're not a chili fan. There's pieces of potato, chili, chicken (with bones) served over a bed of thick, measuring tape looking noodle. Imagine chow fun type fo noodle but extra chewy and thick, that's the noodle's texture. This dish takes time to prepare, some people call in, or just order it first thing when you sit down. It's definitely a family size dish, you can probably split it with 4-6 people.\n\nOther than the food, this place has the best service ever! No one to greet you, no one to look over at your table when you're like raising your hand for their attention, slow to take your orders, doesn't bus tables quick enough even if there's a long line of people waiting to be seated, has a credit card sticker at the door but won't let you use credit card to pay because they are closing in an hour.

Shandong Deluxe has the core makings of a good Northern Chinese restaurant, but I think the execution fell a little short of expectation. \n\nThe restaurant itself is a small, hole-in-the-wall place, with crowded tables and a small corridor in the back that has both tables and kitchen staff making the food. Service is friendly and efficient enough, although being able to speak Chinese does make things easier.\n\nCold flat noodles with sliced cucumber and sesame sauce:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shandong-deluxe-san-francisco?select=MMi8D5prN9FI1lLQyJMstQ#CLgjGww5rHW9BEN4g6zhkg)\nThe sesame sauce on this dish was amaaaazing, definitely reminiscent of the kind I used to have in the street vendor noodle dishes back in China. The flat noodles were initially of good texture, and you could tell that they were hand-made, but unfortunately they were a little over-boiled, which caused them to be a bit waterlogged and softer than optimal. I liked the contrast of the crunchy cucumber and soft noodles, but there was some watery sauce on the bottom that was a little unappetizing towards the end when the last bits of noodle were swimming around in there. Good flavor, but I think the execution could use a bit of work.\n\nDan Dan Mian with hand-pulled noodles:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shandong-deluxe-san-francisco?select=MMi8D5prN9FI1lLQyJMstQ#Lr8rLySle8GICq5agDaxvA)\nI haven't had Dan Dan Mian at many places since I don't usually eat spicy foods, but the broth on this had good flavor. It was pretty salty though, and the spiciness was a little reminiscent of the sauce that was in the condiment section of each table. I tried some of the actual hand-pulled noodles though, and those were really good. You can really tell that they were hand-pulled, as the elasticity was on point. \n\nPork and chive dumplings:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shandong-deluxe-san-francisco?select=MMi8D5prN9FI1lLQyJMstQ#nWJIZ6YVJ2AUsFAERMczGw)\nThese dumplings were a little disappointing. They had the \"hand squeezed\" look of authentic Northern dumplings, but they were way overboiled and super waterlogged. I was not a fan of the execution on these at all, and they would have been really good if they had not been so overboiled. The pork and chive mixture inside was tasty, but a little bit salty, and there was that juiciness that was reminiscent of soup buns. They sell frozen dumplings as well, so I might opt to just buy the frozen version next time and go home to boil them myself.\n\nI might drop by again if I'm in the area to try some of their other noodles (beef tendon sounded good!), but I'm a little wary of the execution of the cook here. Also, I'm not sure if they over-salt their dishes or use MSG, as my friend and I both had slight headaches after eating here.", "author": "Maggie X."}

I ordered two noodle dishes and had finished eating around 1:30 pm.  Requested the check, paid, and while waiting for the change back, one of us went to use the rest room.  As he is still at the bathroom, a group of 11 people came in and was looking for a table; the owner/waiter (his picture was on the wall, so I assume he is one of the owners) quickly clean the table when I was still sitting sipping tea waiting for him.  The owner/waiter picked up the change and try to pocket them but felt he shouldn't at the same time.  He struggled back and fourth 3 times taking the tips, then put the change back onto the table.  In the mean time, several of the people from the group of 11 begins to sit down at our table impolitely!  So the owner/waiter said, \"please take the change back, no need to give us tips!\"  From my perspective, this is what restaurants should never do, chase your customer out!

I should not expect that Shandong food here tastes the same as Shandong food back in China, but food here is no where close to Shandong food. There are not many dishes are Shandong food on menu. \n\n1. Pork Dumplings\nThe skin is so thick and the filling is so small. Shandong Pork Dumplings should have thin skin and big filling. The Napa Cabbage is not fresh because it is squashy. You name your dish pork dumpling. Are you kidding me?\n\n2. Black Bean W Pork Noddle (Zha Jiang Mian)\n Zha Jiang Mian is a disappointment. It is freaking salty, and I can't find much pork. In addition, it has big pieces of Chinese Onion pieces. I like Chinese Onion, but why the heck it comes in big pieces? It should be in small pieces so that the sauce can have much more onion flavor.  Further more, it should come with small and thin cucumber slices. Where is it?\n\n3. Five Spice Fish (Xun Yu)\nAre you kidding me? The fish pieces are very hard. It means that it is not fresh at all. It was probably cooked and frozen a few days ago. Five Spice Fish tastes good only if you eat it right after you cook it. This is not authentic at all.\n\n4. Xinjiang Doddle W Lamb\nThis is not a Shandong dish. I don't know how it should taste. However, I can't find much lamb but just lots of noodle. \n\nI don't want to comment anymore. Nothing is authentic. I came with excitement but left with huge disappointment. I will NEVER come back again, and I do NOT recommend it to anybody. It is not expensive, but it is not worth the money. \n\nIf you want to have some authentic Shandong food.

While I've tasted better black bean sauce, the hand-pulled noodles were chewy and had amazing texture. For less than $10, it was a pretty good portion.\n\nThe lamb noodles were similarly great. The lamb was soft and flavorful while the noodles were perfect. The soup was a clear broth so the lamb flavor was really clear and strong. Also under $10, good portion. \n\nThe onion pancake (~$6) came really late, after everything else. It lacked flavor and was flimsy, not crispy or crunchy at all. \n\nThe pork dumpling with chives (~$6) was not bad and definitely was flavorful. The meat was also nice and juicy, but the noodles were just better.\n\nI highly recommend the noodles!!

But I'm still a fan!\n\nTip: Cash only!! \n\nPros:\n-authentic, fresh, homemade, flavorful dumpling filling with THICK hand-made dumpling skin. My family does not make dumplings on our own from scratch so I've learned over the years to appreciate the quality of thick, chewy handmade dumpling skins!!! This place is definitely where it's at.\n-not too salty, but just right. In my opinion, Shandong has the proportions right for  taste+filling vs. thickness of dumpling skin. YUM!!\n-fresh. Everything you order is hot right off the stove. Gotta love hot foods :) \n-fast. Ok let me clarify - while the service isn't the best (don't expect it to be, it's a hole in the wall restaurant), once you do manage to get your order in, it's in. And they're cooking it! Our 3 orders came out quickly together after we ordered.\n-cheap! We ordered 3 dishes for 2 people (ate til we were full) and paid $24 total including tax and tip! \n-the orange homemade hot sauce. It's hot and it's good. Mix it with the soy sauce. Enough said.\n-conveniently located on Taraval near the muni line. Can take the L-line there and walk over within 3 mins. \n\nCons:\n-if you read the other low star reviews, it's mostly attributed to service. But like I said, don't expect to be treated like you're royalty. They're busy cooking everything from scratch! Be supportive and take initiative to help yourself :P\n-even if there is a wait list, wait inside or check back often to see if there is movement. If the restaurant isn't packed, they're not going to look at the wait list. My friend and I were sitting on the chairs outside and were wondering what was taking so long. We went inside and realized no one was checking the wait list and there were a few empty tables. They gave us a table and hot tea right away after that.\n-...but no menu. They have a box of blue paper menus near the entrance. Or table was close enough for me to notice that so I went up and got one.\n-we had to call our waiter over to order. Seems like this place is short staffed. (However after we got our order in the food came out pretty fast afterwards!)\n-had to ask for refills on the hot tea\n\nLe Menu:\n-chicken and corn dumplings. My friend visits this place often and highly recommended this one. Especially if you love corn!\n-pork and leek dumplings. Also a good one\n-leek pancake. YOU MUST GET THIS. Super hot and crisp, delicious, and satisfying.\n\nWe were both super full and I even got to take 6 or 7 dumplings home to bring for lunch the next day = win :) (and btw, they were still amazing the next day).

My friend brought me here once and I ended up coming back 2 more times after that over the span of 2 weeks. I NEVER DO THAT!! Plus, I was on spring break from the east coast, so these meal choices were precious. 3 times in 3 weeks. That alone should tell you how good this place is. \n\nI've been incredibly happy with almost everything I've gotten here. My favorites include:\n- BEEF ROLLS: the best I've ever had. Great ratio of fresh veggies!\n- DUMPLINGS: the skin is better at San Tung, but the filling is better here!! The skin is too thick, but its okay because the filling is SOO juicy and flavorful. \n- CHIVE PANCAKES: delicious chives stuffed in a wonderfully crisp pancake. \n- FUNGUS, EGG, AND FLOWER NOODLE: the noodles here a great! And the broth was not too salty like it usually is at other Chinese restaurants. \n- BLACK BEAN NOODLES/ja jang mien: because hand pulled noodles!!\n\nThe only dish I wasn't a huge fan of was the Dan Dan Noodles...which tasted like a mix of peanut butter and chili to me. This might just be a personal preference though. \n\nI've noticed most of the negative reviews are mainly about the service. But damn, when prices are that cheap and the food is that authentic, I've learned to expect that! The $ you save is compensated in the lack of service. That's just how it works at cheap Chinese restaurants. \n\nThe main con for me is the rate that they bring out your dishes. Every time I've gone, they've been quick to bring out most of your dishes, but there has ALWAYS been one dish that arrives after you finish eating everything else! \n\nPS make a trip to the bathroom, where you can see workers making the dumplings out in the open!", "author": "Carolyn L."}

However, the food was all on point, tasted like home cooking that I grew up with.\n\nI got the noodles with mushrooms - taste was pretty authentic, definitely like my moms cooking! The noodle broth had a very deep and rich flavor, with hints of cinnamon, cloves, and star anise - just how they do it in Shan Dong.  This is northern cuisine, which is notorious for having heavy flavored foods and really big people! \n\nDumplings were well worth it, one serving is about 12 dumplings, and they are SUPER legit and cheap.

You can tell it's super Chinese because decor is an afterthought, and they didn't bother to remove the Japanese paintings from the previous restaurant that was here. There's nothing wrong with that. I just think it's funny. \n\nAnyway, I wasn't able to try the dumplings, but we had the Lamb Skewers, Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, and Lamb Noodle Soup.\n\nThe Lamb Skewers had a good amount of meat on them, but they were pretty tough and kind of bland. Although it looked like they were seasoned thoroughly, they weren't that flavorful. I thought they didn't have enough cumin to bring out the lamb's flavor. A little salt could've helped too.\n\nIn both noodle soups, the noodles were the highlight and had a delightful toothsome chewiness. The soups could have been better though. The Spicy Beef Soup didn't have a strong foundation. It was spicy and a little sour, but there was no beefiness in the broth. It kind of just tasted like hot sauce and water. The Lamb Noodle Soup was a little bit better, but the broth still wasn't very robust. There was a shiitake earthiness and slight gamey flavor in the broth, but it was still leaning heavily on the bland side. In general, it doesn't seem like their broths are very well developed. Like San Tung on Irving, maybe the thick saucy type of noodles are better. I'll have to try those next time.", "author": "Nei N."}

We chose this restaurant since it had a) the most interesting menu and b) the most dining customers.  The restaurant name posted on its front signage prominently describes their signature specialty:  hand pulled noodles (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) (okay, they describe it as \"hand cranked\"?).  Here's what we ordered:\n\nAppetizers (shared)\n1) Handwritten appetizer #A - My English description is Yuba strips and marinated vegetables with peanuts (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7T256d1661SEA9KHsEFO-w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Reminds me of Hodoy Soy's Yuba strips, but a bit more watery from the cucumber.\n\n2) Bean Curd Noodle Salad - Tasty but pretty one dimensional.\n\n3) Shandong Style Marinated Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=GXIwks6wo5RA0RFazqDYPA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Reminds me of drunken chicken without the alcohol.  The timing on the marinating is good as the flavor and texture (soft and not dry) were spot on.\n\nEntree\n4) Beef Stew Noodle (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XG9J6HxZ1jhAeO6za33R7w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Hand pulled noodles (unmistakable with the varying width of the noodle strands) are not my favorite as they tend to be more doughy than ramen al dente crunchy.  Soup was okay with five-spice ingredients, mainly star anise and peppercorns (careful when biting those black balls on the bottom).\n\nVegetables (shared)\n5) Sautee (sp) Bok Choy (Ching Gong Chai) -  The English wording doesn't quite match the veggies served here.  Need to refer to Ken K. for a more accurate translation, but they cooked this well with diced garlic.\n\nWhile walking to the restroom, I noticed a lady kneading and folding chive turnovers (Jiu chai he zhi).  The older gentleman in the posted photo (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shandong-deluxe-san-francisco?select=3z3b7zYuf185YImVHchAtA#3z3b7zYuf185YImVHchAtA) walked the dining room, serving food and checking on dining customers.  At the front window, it clearly displays the man pulling noodles (noodle master) and the lady doing what she was doing (dumpling duchess).

With the high concentration of Chinese restaurants in the area, it was nice to be able to pick one out that came highly recommended.\n\nWe came here for dinner on a Monday night at 6:30pm and got a table for 3 right away. Seating is somewhat limited and the restaurant got busier around 7:30pm with a short wait so come early. \n\nWe ordered 3 dishes for 3 people which wound up being the perfect amount of food. The dishes were as follows:\n1. Pork Dumpling with Chives - The dumpling skin had a good texture. It wasn't too thick and had a good chew to it. The pork was well seasoned and had a great consistency. Sometimes I find that dumpling places can be a little sloppy with the meat and there's often unsavory bits that are inedible but there was none of that today. The chives are a classic complement are were a nice flavor bump. Definitely above average. \n2. Onion Pancake - Great item. The plate came with 8 good sized pieces. They were crispy, a nice thickness and extremely flavorful. The only thing I would say is that they were a bit oily.\n3. Xinjian Noodle - This was one of their signature dishes and it fell a little flat for me. I'm not entirely sure what this dish is made up of traditionally but we opted for the beef version. Aside from noodles and beef, there were veggies including red and green peppers, white button mushrooms and onions. The noodles themselves were pretty good. I am told they are hand pulled and made in the restaurant. The overall flavor of the dish was okay. Nothing too crazy but good. The veggies were kinda meh and there was a lot of water seepage from it all. \n\nAll in all this place is decent.

The first time here, we are IN LOVED with their noodles.\n\nFirst-time visit, I got the spicy pork noodle (less spicy cuz idk how spicy it would be for \"shandong people\"). The bowl of noodles came out pretty fast. The bowl of soup is orange/red-ish? OH! It must be hot sauce i guess? I tried the soup with a spoon hoping its not THAT spicy, but guess what, it tastes so good, a little hint of spicy taste last on my tongue, its not like super duper spicy. (Cuz i got some crazy hot sauce from other \"shandong\" place before). The texture of the noodles: chewy and elastic, pretty awesome noodles here. I guess they make it themselves? cuz I haven't tried any of the machine-made-noodles has this kind of texture. It's really really good. WOULD RECOMMEND TO FRIENDS.\n\nWe also got the pork dumpling with spinach. It has a huge chopped spinach with pork inside the dumpling. It tastes nothing really special, just spinach with pork with the outside part (flours/men fun? LOL) but we like it too. FYI: dine in or take out -12 pieces. Take out with \"raw/uncook dumpling\" - 20 pieces. Don't let the menu fool you LOL.\n\nWe also got the beef fried rice noodle (beef chow ho fun). Not much beef, but a big portion of rice noodles. The rice noodles are kinda dry and oil. Sadly, bf doesn't like it, but I took all the beef LMAO. AND he took half of my spicy pork noodle!! (THIS IS HOW AMAZING THEIR NOODLES \"LA MEIN\" IS)\n\nSecond visit: We got the lamb noodle, and yes the soup and noodles came out just like what we've expected it. Im craving their noodles from now on LOL. \n\nAll in all, this is a very good noodle place to try if you're craving noodles like me.

We were the first to be seated with the wave of hungry dinner patrons, but it was obvious that the restaurant was completely overwhelmed. Waiters would ask already seated guests to swap tables in order to accommodate other tables.  Food came out slowly and was either lukewarm or bland. \n\nCase in point, my combo seafood noodle. I love hand pulled noodles, so +1 for that. The noodles themselves were thick, not too chewy, and super long. The dish featured little pieces of squid, conch, and shrimp. It was a nice mix, however, they were all incredibly briny in taste. It was as if they were taken fresh out of the ocean and thrown straight in. Don't get me wrong, I like my seafood fresh, but not that fresh. Also, the broth was heavily flavored with white pepper salt.\n\nAs for the lamb noodle, it also featured handpulled noodles along with a bed of vegetables (celery, carrots, tomatoes) and little bits of lamb. The lamb was awesomely tender, but the pieces came few and far between bites. I guess I shouldn't expect so much from a dish under $7...but I do. Or at least my taste buds do.\n\nWe also ordered pork/shrimp/chives dumplings. They came out looking like they had been sitting nearly 10 minutes.\n\nAll in all, I have no plans to come back soon.\n\nBy the way, they didn't have a doorknob on their unisex bathroom...literally a hole in the door.

A few important things to point out: \n\n(1) They only take CARDS for purchases OVER $25. \n\n(2) The HOT SAUCE is delicious and very SPICY; more like pureed peppers (not the dry chili peppers in oil). \n\n(3) BEEF PANCAKE is not synonymous to the Beef Roll. Other restaurants call it the beef pancake (e.g. across the street), something that looks like a burrito. But my fault for not realizing that's not the name here. The beef pancake is tasty though, it's a thick green onion pancake cut into fours and deep fried. \n \n(4) The hand pulled laimein NOODLES are good quality, but I did not expect the spicy beef noodle soup to taste the way it did. It tasted more like a tom yum soup, SPICY and SOUR. I would not be ordering that dish again since it's not my palate preference... Would prefer the noodles in a different broth. I only came in here as I am on a quest to look for laimein closest to the kind I've had in China. \n\n(5) PAN FRIED DUMPKINGS are also not what I expected. The consistency is more like a pan fried BAO (BUN). A bit disappointing as there are 6 to one order. \n\nI may only visit again to try their noodles outside the soup. \n\n(6) The SERVICE is absent minded as she will frequently forget to get napkins, glasses of water, bowls as she goes back and forth.

Such a shame since my gf and I really like Chinese food. \n\nWhen we arrived, it was really booked so we thought, \"hey this may be good\". As soon as we were seated deep in the hallway towards the restroom, I kinda had a bad feeling but still stayed positive on ordering the food. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\n-Beef Pancake Rolls - Pretty good but I've had better.\n\n-Leek Pancake - Meh, I wouldn't recommend it. Should have gotten something better.\n\n-Shrimp and Chive Dumplings - The first two bites were not bad, but it gets tiring and I lost my appetite when I reached this dish (you will know why in the next paragraph) \n\n-Zha Jiang Mian - It's good but again, I lost my appetite later on and couldn't finish it, which is rare for me.\n\nThe main reason why I was really really really annoyed by this place is because there's a stupid metal circuit box right next to my face right on the wall at our table. Every few minutes, a different restaurant worker will come to our table to open the circuit box and hit switches. Every time they open the box, it's right in front of my face and my gf saw the insides of the box, which is super dusty. I don't appreciate them hovering the circuit box door over our food 20 times (yes I counted), it really made me lose my appetite. One of the workers, middle age man just slapped my shoulder and told me to move so he can open the circuit box. \n\nMy feedback is, either they remove that table right next to the circuit box or they should pay for a more efficient way of using energy. This is not how customers should be treated, they really have to fix their attitudes, especially when it's something they are doing wrong. The food could have been good but I really lost my appetite with the constant interruptions at our table with that stupid circuit box they keep opening and closing. \n\nIn conclusion, I will never ever come back, nor would I recommend this place to anyone. If you want real good Chinese food on Taravel, I highly recommend House of Pancake or Dumpling Kitchen. Or even freaking drive down to China North Dumpling on Noreiga for better Shandong food. It's really a shame since I wanted to like this place..", "author": "Victor Q."}

The dumplings were good, the soup noodles a bit hit and miss.\n\nSitting here and writing this now, I'm not much inclined to come back. The service always tests my patience as asking a fork for the kids requires persistence (just grab me a damn fork already) and tonight I gave up after asking both waiters and got it myself.\n\nThe food is okay. Their dumplings are still good - try the pork with chives. Their spicy beef noodle soup is actually too spicy and I used to just plow through it, but now they're skimping on the beef slices. The noodles are homemade and they're still good and chewy, however. The beef chow fun is riddled with cabbage and sprout fillers and not much beef. Their fried tofu is good, but it's usually good everywhere. There's a cold noodle dish (can't recall the name) that looks like a gray pile of dead noodles, but surprisingly good. The beef pancake is an oily and salty mess-avoid it.\n\nAnyways, after tonight I'm probably not going to come back. It's not that the food is terrible, but the service and food is not enough to make me want to come here when there are better places to go. House of Pancake up the block is much better, so rather than bounce between the two as I had in the past, it's just HoP from here on out. 2.5 stars.\n\nOn a side note, this one time we were having dinner here, this big huge fight erupted in the kitchen.

Apparently, not so well.\n\nAs Yelper Bri Y. mentioned, ShanDong Deluxe replaced Ramen Doraku in name and menu, but not in decor.  I found the menu hilarious, since there was handwritten scribble all over ours, crossing out misspellings and updating options.  At least someone is helping to proof the menus?  Although shouldn't this be done prior to printing?  But I digress.\n\nSo the food....in summary, lacking in flavor. Here's what the FH and I ordered:\n\n- Salt Pepper Tofu $5.95 - super bland\n- Onion Pan Cake Egg Wrap $5.95 - I could do without the egg next time (well, actually, doubt there'll be a next time), and the onion pancake itself was limp and virtually tasteless\n- XLBs $4.95 (for six) - sad. These XLBs were small, shriveled, and nearly soupless, not plump and juicy like I had hoped for\n- Spicy Beef Sauced Noodle $6.95 - chewy noodles were actually pretty good, but the broth had zero flavor and just tasted spicy\n\nService was fine, and we were told we needed to pay cash because the restaurant would be closing soon.  No problem, but if you are closing, why are you still accepting walk-ins?  Also, for being a new restaurant, why are your condiment containers already caked with dried sauce?

Saw the guy in the window hand pulling them and immediately thought FRESH! Then while enjoying the outstanding flat flour ones, I saw it! It was \"love at first sight.\" It looked really sexy. A mountain of chicken, potatoes, bell peppers etc, on top of big fat No.3 type flour noodles, all swimming in a deep red pungent sauce, with 100 small red Sichuan chili peppers for company! Wow!! It was called \"Xinjiang Chicken\" and it was gigantic. (And not cheap at $20.99.) But I knew at first sight, that I had to have it! Visit #2, \"Xinjiang Chicken please!\" After a short wait, it came. As I dug in, I closed my eyes and there it was, i was in the Urumqi main market, The Erdaoqiao Market, the Silk Road, the smell of grilled kebabs in the air. Handmade pita bread being rolled around me. Middle Eastern type music wafting through the market. Asian faces with strong middle eastern lines all around. The shopowner beckoning me to come into his shop in Turkish, and to try his special \"Xinjiang Chicken,\" and as I went in and sat down, and he brought it to me, my eyes opened to the taste of fire and cardamom in my mouth.  It was so good, I almost started yelling in Turkish (the language of the Uigher minority who inhabit Xinjiang,) \"mashallah, \u00d6ld\u00fcm ve cennete gitti ettik\" (oh god! I've died and went to heaven!) but I didn't, to keep the Cantonese people around me eating this delicious shandong food, from thinking I was crazier than they already thought, (about a white guy eating a 100 pepper dish, smiling and howling.) So, like to travel to faraway, exotic places? Yes? But you don't have the time and money? Can I interest you in a trip to Xinjiang? It only costs $20.99 and 2 hours max. If you go, don't forget to try the \"Xinjiang Chicken,\" and don't forget  to hit me up afterwards and I'll tell you how to say \"delicious, thank you\" in Uighur, (Turkish.)", "author": "George F."}

Their Pork and Napa and Chicken and Corn dumplings were good and actually different from the other dumpling places I've reviewed around the Bay Area (Town, Kingdom, King, etc.). These dumplings seem to have a thicker skin, larger, and the filling is flavored differently. I normally like Pork and Napa over Chicken and Corn but it's the opposite here. There's a larger selection of dumplings here than most places too, including crab, fish, and different lamb combinations. I also tried their signature Xin Jian Chicken Noodle plate...which is huge and has to have at least a whole chicken in it. It's worth a try but it's more for 3-4 people and doesn't have much noodles in it since the noodles are huge, thick, wide styled noodles. The portion sizes here are pretty generous and if I were to come back, I'll be looking for more dumplings and one of their handmade noodle soups.", "author": "Daniel C."}

I'll be nice and give 3 stars for now.  \n\nI was excited when Shandong opened in the Sunset, because I thought it was related to Shan Dong in Oakland Chinatown that I've heard so much about from friends.  Both places have hand pulled noodles and fresh made dumplings, but I don't think the restaurants are related.  \n\nThe place was packed on a Tuesday night, and the bf and I stood there unacknowledged as we waited for the next available table.  We watched in puzzlement and worry as the staff was visibly frazzled and the diners were either waiting for food or trying to get the staff's attention.  After 5 minutes we were finally greeted with a \"please sit\" and some hot tea.  \n\nThe menu is divided nicely into soups, noodles, dumplings, etc.  However, unless you know what Sam Sun, or Xinjiang style, or Hanamaki mean, it is difficult to pick what to order.  There are no descriptions for any of the items, which is a huge mistake because people generally want to know what they're about to eat.  This, along with the fact that the place could barely function with 18 diners, was very unsettling.  But then the food came, and it was okay.\n\nThe onion pancake was crisp and chewy at the same time.  The vegetarian dumplings were the perfect thickness and consistency, and filled with edamame and tofu (I think).  The noodles (I don't even known what we ordered) were the best hand pulled noodles I've had in the city.  They had a great flavor and chew, and were in a light, spicy, garlic broth with plump shrimp and cabbage.  The house chili sauce enhanced everything, and I was lost in spicy, chewy, deliciousness.  \n\nThat is until we were done eating, and it was an effort to try to get the staff's attention so that we could pack our leftover dumplings, pay, and be out of there.  \n\nI want to go back, but only when they are not busy and overwhelmed.  Hopefully they'll learn the ropes of running and operating a restaurant soon, because the food is pretty damn good and it would be a shame if they don't improve their service.", "author": "Sandy K."}

I will definitely be back!  What really gives this place a five star rating (on top of all the above) is that it is a small,  local,  family run business with extremely honest employees. I accidentally left my purse behind filled with my wallet, my tablet, etc. and didn't realize until after my massage hours later. Not only was my tablet and my wallet still there, they kept safe in the back for me - and all my cash was still in it! I tried to give the father the cash, but he wouldn't take it.

I was sitting in the way back and saw them getting all the dumplings for each order out of a large freezer. Many were very seriously frozen together and had to be beaten apart. If you're in the front of the restaurant and wonder what that thumping is that you hear fairly regularly, now you know.\n\nI didn't see all that when i initially placed my order for dumplings and noodles.\n\nNevertheless, despite this glaring warning, I was curious because of the (now clearly suspicious) positive reviews. The dumplings were horrible. They were pretty much inedible. They had clearly been frozen and were not any where near fresh. They did not even LOOK decent. They did not even taste kinda good. Bleck. Horrible is being nice.\n\nI asked the waitress for what they were famous for. I figured it must be something other than dumplings. She suggested the noodles and suggested one dish as the most popular. She said the sauce is the part that is the best and what to really look for.\n\nHmmmmm\n\nWell the noodles were crazy oily, like many reviewers noted. Not only that, but there was hardly any sauce. I added a bit of the mustardy sauce they offer. After adding that, I'm fairly sure this is the \"sauce\". It totally tasted the same, or at least VERY similar to the original sauce... Just more of it. The noodles themselves seemed decent. but i wonder what's the real story about them considering the dumplings and sauce fiasco. Basically the noodle dish sucked.\n\nI won't even go into the smell, and the feeling that oil is in the air. My guess is that the smell is from oil. Hmmm\n\nAt least I had fresh baked cookies that I had made myself at home.... Otherwise I would have had a really hungry night ahead.\n\n:(\n\nI feel bad writing such a scathing review.

Although some or a few choices here are quite delicious, their customer service is indescribably HORRIBLE. Okay, my fault that there's so much people in line and waited for almost two hour to be seated. Then Ms.Waitress comes and tries to take my order without her notepad, then fails her attempt and gets her notepad and takes my order (lamb skewers, celery and pork dumplings, Shanghai dumplings, crab dumplings, and pan-fried meat buns). \n\nFirst dish of lamb skewers were fine. But the Shanghai dumplings are disappointing. The skin of the dumplings were made poorly, therefore once I clamped my chopsticks on them, it broke immediately. Yuck, thought you were dumpling masters. \n\nFinally after asking the waitresses twice why our order is taking OVER 30 MINUTES to get out, it finally came, yeah, the wrong order. Then we had to tell them it's the wrong order then the pan-fried meat buns finally came out. Sorry, let me introduce that again. The OIL DRENCHED meat buns came out. \n\nThen after TWENTY MINUTES, after TWO more asks to the two waitresses why the orders are taking so long, the \"celery pork dumplings came\". Uh, no. Just kidding, it's corn and chicken dumplings. So I was to my extent and told them that it's not what I ordered and asked for the check. Okay. She comes and shows me that she cancelled the two dumplings and it's thirty dollars for eating four skewers of lamb, four Shanghai dumplings, and four oily meat buns. I was like, \"This is thirty? Are you sure?\" Then she recalculated and it was actually 19.50. \n\nOverall--horrible. It was unpleasant seeing other tables who came after us with tables filled with food in less than twenty minutes. Afterwards, I got the takeout menu and recalculated the check. We were charged extra $2.50. Could've given that money to a homeless person or for the meter, y'know. Go to this restaurant if you want horrible customer service and get ripped off. Tips?

It's nice and chewy, but it's an occasional hit or miss with the flavoring. Their dumplings are yummy!!! especially the one with chives and shrimp. If you like it, you can also ask to buy frozen ones and boil them whenever you're craving them at home if it's a further drive for you. \n\nUnless you like a lamb-like tasting beef pancake.. I would not get that one. I'm not sure what it's called exactly, but it's one of the two pancakes that's advertised in their window. They say that the lamb-like tasting flavor might come from all the different herbs and spices they use... but who knows, I did not like it at all. \n\nBe careful not to mix up the vinegar and the soy sauce bottles.. They tend to be identical and both are not always provided on the tables. Their hot sauce is really good, but be very careful because it's pretty spicy! I usually use that on all my food =P. \n\nIt's a hit or miss on the wait times.. sometimes they're ridiculously busy and other times they have no lines at all. From what I've observed, their longest lines are usually during lunch... especially on the weekends. Highly recommend getting there before 12 if you want to barely skip their rush hour!

I loved the hand crafted noodles and flavorful broth. I don't exactly remember what I ordered, but you can't go wrong with any of the noodle soup dishes. Though I have been warned that there are apparently two chefs that make the noodles and one of them don't cut the noodles. So be prepared to eat a ridiculously long strand of noodle. You can request for a pair of scissors, but I don't recommend it because they were kids paper scissors (how unsanitary). The best bet is to ask them to cut the noodles prior when you're ordering.  \n\nOn to the bad service, when I did come back that second time I wasn't expecting such a long line. Taking into consideration that it was a weekend, our group didn't mind waiting for a little bit. But the wait got ridiculous, because the owner/server kept on letting people he knew cut us in line for about 30-45 minutes. I can understand that you would let people you know in first as a courtesy but after awhile it was just unfair to the rest of the patrons. After that our table was largely ignored because none of us spoke mandarin Chinese, so of course getting service was difficult.

It's so delicious and surprisingly not oily at all! Very well made and super cheap (12 dumpling for $6.99).\n\nOnly reason why I docked a star is cause I never eat inside of the restaurant itself which is semi cramped with only a dozen tables or so available and also because I've ONLY tried the dumplings, nothing else. I docked another star cause I usually only order pick up which is a feat all on its own because they sometimes have a difficult time understanding English so it takes me longer than I'd like just to place a pick up order over the phone.

Long story short, I definitely had better with better service. Since it is a new restaurant and it is sort of small, it is often packed with people. However, the table turn over rate is terrible (probably due to the lack of staffing), they will leave tables uncleaned for at least 10 - 15 minutes (at least when I was there). \n\nWait list, forget about that! They did not follow it whatsoever! On the day I went, my family and I waited over 30 minutes, we were pretty much next for a table of 3.

The family they seated first, arrived well-after we did. SERIOUSLY?!? Oh hell no! Luckily, I was standing inside the restaurant and demanded we be seated since we were next on the list. Originally, they offered us 3, one of those tiny table for 2 people. I said, no and requested a the four people table that was open. After we sat down, it took at least 10 minutes before we received a menu or water. \n\nFood-wise: It was blah for me. I have traveled to China and Taiwan before and had hand-pulled noodles. It definitely cannot compare, but compared to U.S. standards, it is quite crappy.

The noodles were horrible and the flavors just did not mix well, it was very oily. For a dish like Liang Pi, the noodles itself is very important. As for the dumplings, the skins was slight tough and the pork filling tasted funny (not in a expired way, but flavor-wise). Also, the stir-fry noodles with lamb, the flavors are interesting, its main base is a tomato sauce.

I actually made it 5 mins before closing. It was a packed house...There were still a ton of patrons. The barely English-speaking waitress told me that the kitchen was closing and needed me to order immediately. She didn't bother hiding the fact that she was irritated and rudely rushed me to order. Being my first time there, I asked her to suggest a noodle dish. She recommended the Xinjiang Noodles. So I took her recommendation and also ordered the shrimp with chives dumpling, green onion pancake and mongolian beef. Spent $30 total. \n\nAs I waited for about 10 mins, I watched the same waitress turn away a couple that wanted to eat there. Astonishingly, I also watched two separate goups walk in that seated themselves. At the time, the waitress was in the back and didn't see the two groups walk in. However, I witnessed the whole thing unfold and saw her extremely pissed off reaction when she discovered what happened. She ended rushing them through their order as well.\n\nAnyways, I got my food and went home right away to eat it. To my utter disappointment, everything was ridiculously nasty. With the exception of the shrimp dumplings that were tolerable. I am not a picky eater. But even with my asian palate, I couldn't bare eating the food. The food was just ridiculously flavorless. The worst dish was the Xinjiang Noodles!!! I couldn't believe it!! I even tried reviving it with some soy sauce and hot sauce but it was so far gone that it was beyond edible. The mongolian beef was practically just as bad. And the green onion pancakes were nothing to rave about. Not even sure if they deserve 2 stars and $30 bucks..... Bad service plus bad food should equal to zero stars. Not going there again.", "author": "Mary L."}

My relatives and I really wanted to try this place out for lunch today. We got seated right away and we ordered one beef stew noodle bowl and one beef tendon noodle bowl.  Both arrived promptly and in fairly good sized bowls. The broth was well made, not overly salted with additives. The hand pulled noodles were soft and chewy. I loved it! Warning, the noodles were crazy long, so be prepared to ask for scissors or a knife to cut them. My beef tendon were soft and succulent, just this side of gelatinous heaven. It came with Chinese mustard greens for color and balance.\n\nWe also ordered the xiao long bao, which has the juicy broth I expected, but not the ginger flavor in the pork meat which I didn't expect. I'm not a fan of ginger so I was taunted by the little morsels...didn't help that I had 3 baskets of xlb at Shanghai Dumpling King the night before...xlb overload!\n\nI wouldn't recommend the beef pancake, mom assumed they would be pan grilled, not completely fried up into a greasy brown hot mess.

I have been going back for a quick meal of warm noodle soup and hot dumplings.\n\n* Spicy Beef Noodle (4 of 5) $6.95 - Flavorful and filling. I think this is my favorite spicy beef noodle in the Sunset Area. I would like more beef, but they give so much noodle. The spiciness it not too hot, but not too mellow. And not to sour, as some places serve it. It has a great amount of noodle and I really like the noodle choice. It is chewy, stringy, and fresh tasting. \n* Pork and Chive Dumplings (12) (4 of 5) $5.95 - Fresh and tasty. I have no complaints. The freshly cooked dumplings are tasty. Best to eat it as soon as it gets to the table.  \n* Black Bean Noodle (2.5 of 5 ) $6.95 - It is a pass for me. They use the same noodle as the soup one, but their sauce base is dry and not that tasty. Their black bean sauce does not compliment the noodle or coat it to be a good tossing noodle choice. Too bad. I was really hoping this was another hit. But it is a pass for me. I will keep with the noodle in soup.\n\nBeen going back often when I want some hot noodle soup to warm up from the cold and wet winter.

I've read about the other comments compare noodles or dumplings from Beijing and Xi'an. It is hard to compare because Shandong and Xi'an or Beijing styles are very different . I highly recommended the pork and napa cabbage dumplings and Wan Tou ( \u5c71\u6771\u5927\u9945\u982d ) ( the big Shandong Bun) which is a real big shandong bun, nothing like the soft little buns you will find in dim sum place.

I 've lost this taste since my grandma past away back in the 90s. I felt touching which brought me back a lot of good memories because of this pork bun. My grandma made this bun exactly the same way. \n\nI guess I created my fusion way to eat this plain big buns when I was in kindergarten and I would like to share with everyone.

Really bad noodles.\n\n\nThis was my second time here.\n\nI ordered the Jajaing Mein: bean paste and pork noodle:\nThe noodles are hand made, but over cooked.  The sauce is watery, one dimensional--as if they gave up on draining the noodles and just slopped a ladle of canned bean sauce.  Instead of finely minced pork and tofu, there were sparse bits of dried tofu and token amounts of meat.  Instead of cucumber of green onions, there were leftover bits of veggies (raw green berms and a course lay chopped white onion.)\n\nThe dumplings were good.  Firm skin, hot, good filling.\n\nThe reason why 2 starts, not 3:\n\n1. Service: the waitress recommended the most expensive items of each section with no consideration to others ordered.  She's also constantly in a rush for tips.\n\n2. The noodles were *really* sad.  For a shandong restaurant, I'd expect decent noodles.  As it is, I could cook better than this as a 12 year old!\n\n3.

Even Dragon's City across the street has better service. Waitress was extremely inattentive and our tea wasn't warm at all. \n\nMy boyfriend and I just shared their hand pulled noodle dish (xinjiang noodle) for dinner. I was looking forward to eating it after all the rave reviews about it. I didn't mind that they didn't de-bone the chicken in the dish, (as a typical chinese restaurant wouldn't anyway), but there was some sort of seasoning/dirt/loose bone pieces the chef had used that caused my mouth to hit a brick wall every time I chewed. My boyfriend had observed what was in the dish and there were little round black balls that were completely solid in the middle. Didn't really know what they were. Most asian restaurants don't give a crap if there is anything wrong with the dish so we didn't bother asking for another one. We ended up eating what we could and taking home the rest, only to further examine that the chef probably had used some huge 'star anise' seasoning, which might have made it difficult to eat. It literally tasted like there were rocks in my mouth. In terms of flavor, the xinjiang noodle was alright, nothing spectacular.\n\nI suppose the other dishes on the menu are just as great, but I have yet to try.

Ohhh fresh hand-pulled noodles.. gotcha!\n\nThis tiny place has potential to become a hidden gem after some improvement.  My friend and I walked in at 7:30pm on a Wednesday to a full house. Luckily a large group was finishing up and we were able to snag a table. Unfortunately, it took about 10 minutes for someone to get the table ready.  There are 2 waitresses and an older man who seems to be the owner/manager.  All three were very friendly, but my only complaint is that both girls seemed waaaay too flustered and definitely did not know how to prioritize duties-chickens running with their heads off.  For example, while taking a tables' order, the table next to them interrupted and asked for water. The waitress immediately left to get water without completing the tables' order and seemed to have forgetten about them for a few minutes.  I went back tonight and service was horrible.  This time there were two waiters who were nowhere to be seen unless they were bringing food out or to clean a table. When they did come out, they didn't bother to look around.  It took forever to get our tea refilled,  which was never very hot.  When we got our refilled teapot, the guy was so lazy that he climbed over a chair and stretch over to put the teapot on the table. Wtf?!\n\nMy friend and I ordered the chicken and spinach dumplings, beef pancake, and combo spicy noodles. Let me tell you, this was way too much for the both of us. \n\n-combo spicy noodles: 3.5 stars thick \"handcranked\" noodles in a spicy broth with chicken, pork, and seafood.  The noodles were perfectly cooked and weren't mushy. Warning:these noodles are looooong. I see a lot of complaints about the noodles being extremely long, but chinese hand pulled noodles are supposed to be long. Simply ask for a pair of scissors. The broth had the perfect amount of spice but there was not enough broth and had a crazy amount of noodles. By the time we were done with our meal, the bowl looked untouched. This is definately a bowl full of gluten that will make you stuffed to your neck.\n\nChicken and spinach dumplings: 3 stars. Nicely filled steamed dumplings. They can be plain without sauce, which the waitress forgot to bring to us. They had the perfect ratio of spinach to chicken.\n\nBeef pancake: 4 stars. Yum! A tasty beef patty stuffed inside of a dough then panfried to perfection. Crispy on the outside, meaty on the inside.  I'd give it 5 stars if they werent so greasy.\n\nTonight we had the shanghai pork pao (soup dumplings) and blackbean with pork noodles. You get 6 dumplings for $4.95. They were mediocre, nothing to rave about.  The blackbean noodles seem to a popular item. The noodles were perfectly al dente, but none of us were too fond of the flavor.\n\nParking can be hard since there are a few restaurants along the next couple blocks.

She has bumped into us a number of times.  \n\nI am more interested in the food anyway. \n\nNo one is mentioning the lamb skewers.  I love these.  They taste almost exactly like lamb skewers I had somewhere in Yunan.   \nThe Xinjian diced chicken dish is expensive, but a huge amount of food not meant for 1 or even 2 people.   Tons of not too dry chicken, potatoes in a super flavorful sauce. Not spicy, but a little on the numbing side.  Plus big hunks of ginger, tons of whole garlic cloves and star anise.  (To Amanda S.  You don't eat the star anise!  And those black balls were peppercorns.)\n\nWe've tried, i think, 4 of the dumplings.  Favorite so far is the regular old pork and chives.   I see they have a listing for mackerel dumplings. That sounds crazy.\n\nAlso tried the \"Beef Pancake\". I really enjoyed this. It was not thin. Half inch thick maybe. Seemed to be made from layers of dough and ground beef. The irregularity of the thickness of the dough was a plus in my book. The best part was that it was fried to a crisp on the outside yet quite juicy on the inside. Yet another large portion. My friend commented that it tasted oddly European. I've had various kinds of Chinese beef pies over the years, and these were quite distinct. \n\nThe Xinjiang noodle dish is a bit odd though.  VERY mildly flavored.  (not just water and tomato sauce as someone said) but pretty mild.  The lamb was good though. Not chewy.  The texture of the noodles was great, but you have to be into firm noodles.  I saw someone refer to them as shoelaces.  If all your used to is soggy limp noodles, these are going to seem reallllly firm.

The restaurant was full of customers, only 2 small tables were empty, but we have 4 adults + 1 toddler and waited for 20 min or so.  When we sat down, I found people from 3 other big tables just finished and left!  Anyways, we ordered beef tendon noodle soup, onion pancake, Xiao Long Bao, pan fried pork dumplings, and pork and bak choi dumplings.  They are quite tasty, and the portion of beef tendon noodle is quite large!  The service is a little bit slow, and the tea is not hot.  But the food came out quite fast.  I think they are improving.  I personally would like to come to this one rather than king of dumplings (their wait is even longer and service also not as good, and their tables and chairs are too packed).\n\nBTW. There was no waitress, only 2 waiters.  I think they fired the waitress yelper Wilson Y. mentioned in his review...", "author": "Cat. C."}

The Mapo Tufu was decent , but the weakest out of the list. I might be partial to how my wife makes it and there is many different styles to the dish, so it was just so so. My wife liked the noodles even a little more then King of Noodles, I think it could be, def the meat in the soup was allot less fatty then King of noodles. Either way, it is great to see more Mainland Chinese Restaurants opening. The people working there were very nice and the prices good, we will be back, next time Jiaozi!", "author": "dub g."}

I wanted to order take out and had some questions about the dish, like how spicy it is and how big is it. The waiter replied me \"please hurry, we are busy here.\" We ordered and it took us almost 1 hour. We had to cancel one of our order otherwise it will take longer. They never apologize, never smile, never care about you.", "author": "Hsin C."}

It was Halloween evening around 6pm and the place was almost filled. We were seated near the kitchen area. We ordered a pork/chives steamed dumplings, pan fried pork buns, and the xingjiang beef lo mein. Food came after a decent amount of time. Server was lukewarm, not too warm nor cold. The dumplings were ok, filling was good. The pan fried buns weren't so great, meat was dry. The noodles was not tasty and they advertised it!! The sauce tasted like a cross between ketchup and hot sauce. But anyways since we live in the neighborhood we decided to give it a 2nd try tonight....another Wed evening around 5:30pm,\nUpon arrival only 2 tables were filled. Hub wanted to try their spicy beef soup noodles. We ordered that , a shredded pork stir fry with green bell peppers, &a bowl of pork/fungus/egg flower sauce noodles. After 15 minutes the dish came....then half way thru the dish, the server walked by and told us over her shoulder, \" your noodles coming soon.\" 5 min later it came. Hub said the the beef was good but the soup was just spicy water. 10 min later I asked the server when my noodles would come. She looked at me as if I said something wrong. I asked her again. She said, \"did you order it? I didn't write it down.\" No apology whatsoever. I told her I did and asked if she could make it fast. She said she would have to ask the cook. 10 min later it came. It tasted just ok.\nSo...I don't think we will return....didn't like the service, attitude, food was just ok, nothing to rave about. Unless they improve.", "author": "agnes f."}

There was no sense of management and organization at all! My family and I already sat down at a table (which we basically cleaned ourselves) and placed the order, but we were asked to get up and have the other group to sit at our cleaned table.  It was just extramely rediculous and disrespectful to the customer! My family and I will never go to such a lousy restaurant again!", "author": "Vivian H."}

I guess they just don't care about their customers time. Unbelievably slow. Friendly enough. Come for the dumplings. Lamb in particular were good.  I had spicy pork noodle. Boring.  Noodles weren't that special to me. Nothing that bowled me over. The table next to us ONLY ordered dumplings and dim sum. Smart. Their hot sauce on table is tasty. Not super hot but flavorful.", "author": "Michelle M."}

You have to keep asking for every little thing and they lag on everything. They do not even acknowledge you when you walk in (you have to walk up to them). Seating is cramped. We ordered the sam sun noodles, spicy beef noodles, and the shanghai soup dumplings. The spicy beef noodle (super oily, fatty, no flavor) and the shanghai soup dumplings were ok (have had a lot better at other places), but the sam sun noodles had a nasty after taste and just didn't taste right. I think it's great that they make their own noodles and own shanghai dumplings, but the taste isn't there. Will not be back.", "author": "Ellen T."}

I usually have to go get my own menu and have to flag the waiters down to get their attention. The place is also pretty cramped too and it's cash only. However, their food makes up for all the negatives! My favorite dishes are the beef wrap, xinjiang cold noodle, and chinese spinache dumplings. I always order these every time i go! Price is also super cheap. 2 people can definitely dine for about $20 and you'll be stuffed!", "author": "Annie L."}

People have recommended their noodles, and I have to join them. If you don't get anything else there, get something with noodles in it. Their hand-pulled noodles are definitely something to come back for. \n\n- Spicy Beef Tendon: I guess I'm bias toward the Kingdom of Dumpling version's thin slices. The one here is quite thick in comparison, but just as delicious.\n\n- Onion Pancakes: These are probably the best I have found on Taraval so far. Highest of quality, the perfect amount of dough. It's on par with my former favorite Northern Chinese food restaurant in Milbrae. \n\n- XLB (Xiao Long Bao): Could have been more soupy, but other than that, it was quite enjoyable.\n\n- Beef Tendon Noodle: They are quite generous with their tendon here. Soup was good, and of course their noodles were divine. They could have added a bit more vegetables, but other than that it was enough food between me and my guest.\n\nService: Could have been better, but they were really busy (even for a Wednesday night), and didn't really notice our small table. \n\nOver all a fantastic experience food wise. I would recommend this to anyone who is having an inkling for fantastic quality noodles.", "author": "Jess H."}

We tried the cucumber appetizer, bean curd, tripe, shanghai dumplings, and the spicy beef noodles which were all very good. Their homemade hot sauce was delicious.

So sometimes there will be quite a wait. We actually accidentally found this restaurant, my dad saw that they do hand pulled noodles so we decided to try this place out. Their dumplings are pretty good. I got the pork, shrimp and chives ones. The chives weren't overpowering and you can still taste the pork and shrimp. Very well balanced. Their green onion pancake are pretty greasy for not being that golden brown. We ordered the spicy beef noodle and the beef tendon noodle. I wasn't such a fan of the spicy beef noodle, it's just sour and spicy. The beef tendon noodle (is not spicy) had a nice mushroom tasting broth to it which I thought was quite nice. They also give you a nice big bowl with a good amount of noodle. The staff here are pretty forgetful and it is hard to get their attention. Also, their English isn't very good so you might have to repeat things to do a few more times. Probably wouldn't come here again for their noodle but instead their dumplings.", "author": "Tiffany Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-28", "description": "Came in for an early dinner and was seated quickly. The waitress helped us pick items and explained the different options. It helps if you know Mandarin. We ordered a few dishes, one was the lamb lai mein (hand pulled noodles) soup or at least that's what I'm calling. It was unique, three or four different kinds of noodles but had a lot of white pepper added and made it spicier for others. If you can't eat pepper or do not like your soup too spicy make sure to tell the waitress when you order. The green onion pancake was supper thin and crispy so if you like it this way like I do then it is a must order! We order the fennel dumplings and vegetarian dumplings. Both were good and look forward to try different kinds. Arrive early as it is a small place recommended for parties of 4 or less.", "author": "D. M."}

We stumbled upon this place after parking across from Dragon City only to find it is now Taraval Seafood House.  So, not sure about trying it, we crossed back over to Shan Dong.  It is a casual atmosphere with friendly efficient service and low prices and excellent food to boot.  The lamb dumplings are delicate with thin wrappers, tender lamb filling, and a little broth inside like xiao lung baos; perfect with the sauce over it.  The beef wraps are chewy but not overly so with tender beef, onions, and cucumbers.  The Mongolian beef is tender with not as much beef and more vegetables with crisp onions and peppers in a vinigrey chuili sauce; it is ass kickin spicy; so you better have water nearby and some rice.  I can hardly wait to go back and try other things.  So, for excellent Shan Dong cuisine at low prices in a casual atmosphere with friendly service, Shan Dong cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.", "author": "Brian S."}
