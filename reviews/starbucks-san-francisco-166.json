Unfortunately, I have to go to this Starbucks because it is located in the building where i live.. but soon, i will just revert back to my nespresso machine or Pete's down the street. \n\nTonight, they closed one earlier than 7pm (locked doors) and therefore, although I ran downstairs to get my daily order, they were closed. \n\nYesterday, they made my gouda/egg/bacon without bacon, WITH bacon\n\nThe day before, they made my drink order after the order of people who arrived after me. \n\nThe day before that, i was waiting at a register to be helped and a cashier decided to come and work but instead of coming to me while i was at the register waiting to be helped, he went to the next register to help the woman before me! lol - no logic. \n\nEarlier last week, they had their usual reggaeton channel super loud with commercials (don't get me wrong i love this music) because they prefer to dance and sing than to work\n\nThey repeatedly have ONE person on bar, and like two making sandwhiches or cold drinks.. so he/she gets overwhelmed and forgets drink orders all the time\n\nTHEY ARE SLOWWWWWWWWWWW so slow its unbearable. I order my orders through the app most of the time, to avoid the crazy line, but even then i request it with three times more advance to avoid waiting. They send me messages saying the drink is ready when i already have been drinking the drink for ten minutes.\n\nTHEY ARE A MESS. THEY NEED MANAGERS. i have seen them piss off customers a million times.. sometimes someone will order 4 drinks and they finish them all except one.. so the girl just sits there and waits and waits and waits until she finally speaks up and they finally fix their error and wink at her in apology without apologizing.. \n\nIt's just depressing. i would whip them into shape if i worked in this starbucks. if you don't HAVE go here, DONT! avoid it ! run with your lives!", "author": "Sara S."}

For context, I work at a tech company that serves your typical hipster-ish cold brew and it doesn't taste nearly as good as Starbucks. I rather walk across a street and get my cold brew at Starbucks than just walk a few a step. I've also gone to the Market where they serve Four Barrel cold brew and that is at most alright. \n\nFor what it worth, Starbucks is more than about just coffee.

The first one got to me @7 mins after the espresso and the lady making it had a burgundy dye job and an expressionless face. Zero personality and soooooooooooo slooooooooow!!!!!???? Two grandes can be made together FYI, i worked at Starbucks a ways back. On top of it all they were the ONLY two blended drinks made while i waited. She poured milk into cup for #1 then held still while another staff spoke, two mins later she poured milk into blender, pause half a min to respond, pump in sauce, ten sec pause to listen, puts dow the blender to speak, looks at blender in confusion adds ice. Stops to thunk, adds cookie crumble, lid and blend. A full min of chut chat ensues, removes lid, washes lid, pours ONLY ONE DRINK OMFG.. stops, washes blender puts away. Chats a few beats, turns reads cup ignores the extra whip request, hands me beverage. Thinking she is clearly stoned i remind her there are two.

Sometimes, like today, I was out of coffee at home. Headed out with the pooch, my quest for coffee begins.\n\nWith my 4.5 pound Chihuahua tucked under my arm, I go in. The (sort of) hipsters behind the counter look at me -- the guy asks \"Is your dog a service animal\"? I'm thinking, Iraq? \n\nThen I hear it...\"NO DOGS ALLOWED!\" The chick makes some weird face, and says \"allergies\". \n\nWhat really burns my beans, is that I have been in there a few times, with my dog. I mention that this has never been a problem, and ask for their names. The chick says Amber, the dude says \"we sort of don't give out names\".\n\nWould Amber sneeze if I didn't have the dog -- I'm, basically covered in dog hair. If I wanted to make a service inquiry, or complain -- would the dude then give me his name? Well, that is what I wanted to do.\n\nTotally lame!", "author": "Kevin M."}

I know it's Starbucks\"......\n\nThis place is beyond convenient for me, since I live in the building.  The people there know most of the regulars and what they drink, to the point of being nearly comical.  \n\nThis location is always busy, yet you never need to wait very long in line.  Often, my drink is ready by the time I get to the register to pay.\n\nIf I were smart, and less lazy, I'd make my own coffee upstairs, but since I am lazy, (and I guess not financially smart) I get my morning fix here.  \n\nEveryone is friendly, and it makes the crazy ass rent I pay to live here a bit easier to swallow.", "author": "King O."}

I usually wait in line for about 10 min. Always busy . The inside is clean , the outside a diff. Story. The usual homeless asking for change, its rite in front of bart so that's another reason for all the traffic. Overall if you just want good coffee you may want to go somewhere else. Rite around the corner is a cafe called \" m cafe\" obviously no Starbucks but still great coffee its clean and you don't wait forever. Also try Starbucks butter croissant, ask them to warm it up . It's a butter party in your mouth ( worth the wait )", "author": "Ashley G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-03-21", "description": "One day I thought I'd try this Starbucks hoping to get faster service. I was wrong. I believe most of the people in line probably work in the building and come here because it's close. Well, I came in here thinking since it's larger than the one down the street it might have more people working. I was wrong. They had only two people working the whole time. One guy making drinks and one guy taking drinks. I waited for a while and was frustrated and left. I will never go here again. \n\nThe other Starbucks down the street is tinier, but they have one (sometimes two) person taking the order, two registers (sometimes) taking payments, and one or two people making drinks. The manager of the store needs to know the customers and have many people in the morning and cut back in the evening.", "author": "Jen C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-04-19", "description": "The employees working were more concerned about the not letting the last person in line use the bathroom at closing rather than cleaning up their store which was so filthy and disgusting. Coffee cups, food and their wrappers were all over the tables and floor and god only knows what else. Very rude employees, ESPECIALLY the guy with glasses. As soon as it turned 7:30 glasses guy was going around kicking everybody out and was not friendly about it. The woman working told my boyfriend that everyone needs to leave for \"security\" reasons. What happened to the technical 10 minute grace period that I've been told that Starbucks has for customers? I understand that the employees want to go home but give me a break one person has been waiting to use the bathroom long before the clock turned to closing time, I think that the extra minute spent in the store is not that life threatening.  I've never been so poorly treated at a Starbucks than I was at this location. I was with three other people and they were all just as equally upset with the customer service. This location should look into hiring some new staff because the two people we dealt with should not be working in a customer service environment. I wish I would have looked at their name tags because I would really love to name drop right now!  Just know that you suck!", "author": "Ashley M."}
