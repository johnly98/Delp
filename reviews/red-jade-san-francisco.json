A statue one day will be made of you\" - My Fortune Cookie Saying\n\nRed Jade has been my go-to Chinese restaurant since pre-Yelp! Yup over a decade of loyalty here! \nIs Red Jade the best ever? Nope. Yet if you combine quality + quantity + presentation = a happy customer! And why I keep returning.\n\nRed Jade is located on the corner of Church St. & Market St. On my latest visit, after a year hiatus, I enter remembering to go during lunch special time. Basically specials under $9 that include soup, hot tea, a sesame ball, and fortune cookie! And it's not like they only have a handful of lunch specials, in fact, I think it's closer to 25-30 choices! My favorites include the Lemon Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Sweet & Sour Pork. \n\nOn my last visit I ordered the Lemon Chicken which includes freshly steamed broccoli, a bed of steamed rice, egg drop soup, and the extras I mentioned above. I have zero complaints here. I wouldn't exactly call the specials authentic as it's more targeting us Americans with huge appetites lol, but it really does hit the spot. More authentic dishes can be had on their very large menu offerings. For American me, the specials are just fine! And under $9! Oh baby! Keep the Hamilton! \n\nAll in all, I recommend Red Jade to all. Families or solo communist diners too. It's clean, furnished with care, hey it's a \"real\" restaurant that uses \"real\" dishes & table clothes! I've been coming here for over a decade and have always been treated with respect and taken care of, maybe it's my tattoo of Chairman Mao, but who really knows, eh?", "author": "Eric R."}

I requested spicy (not an option but on side note had made the request).\nI would say that it was a damn good dish.\nThis was probably the best vegetarian dish I've had at a Chinese restaurant. Portions were not great but a hair on acceptable. The rice had good texture and moisture balance though had to be ordered as a separate dish.\nI would have this meal again as I enjoyed it immensely.  The added spice was critical to the success of the dish for me but the Sauce carried it well also. With that said, the meal is a 4 and portions, 3.5 stars. The dinner was $10 for a small container of veggies in sauce and should have included a small rice. Other than that, high marks for flavor and the veggies were cooked well. Rice was acceptable. Overall, good meal! Would return.", "author": "John B."}

After getting seated, we were presented with a double sided menu, and they kept it fairly simple and easy to read... sadly no pictures on the menus but I ain't mad at it! We had a total of four in our party in picked what we wanted as a dish, but did not know it was gonna be an Al La Carte style, which turned out even better with more servings for a good price! The staff/waiter was very prompt, responsive, and had patience with our orders since it took us all a little longer to decide what we really wanted, so the waiter happily came back a couple times without showing any agitation or distress. Once we finally decided what we wanted, the wait time for our food was about ten to fifteen minutes which isn't bad at all... but my God was the food amazing. Fun fact, they do put a little zing of spice upon request and know how to jazz it up just to correct amount! We all really enjoyed our meal and left with happy stomachs.

The restaurant is clean, the service is fine, and the food is of decent quality, if a bit bland. Ate here family style so I got to try the Mongolian beef, sea food chow fun, a tofu dish that I've already forgotten, broccoli cashew chicken, and shrimp fried rice. The chow fun was easily the best dish, and the fried rice was pretty good. The rest was just alright, and tasted better doctored with soy sauce and chili paste.\n\nI'd consider coming back here to try their appetizers or tomato beef chow mein if I were nearby and pressed for time. The price was decent for the location and quality of the food. There's better Chinese food in SF, but you'd be paying more or waiting more than an hour to sit down at peak mealtimes elsewhere. Red Jade is a nice compromise where you'll be seated quickly, and affordable if you're treating a group to dinner.

Quoted time was 45-60min and they were definitely within that window.

I've never had rangoons, but my coworker ordered this for her appetizer. It tasted like cream cheese and green onion in a fried wonton skin. Granted it was tasty with the sweet and sour dipping sauce, however for being called CRAB MEAT rangoon there was ZERO crab meat except for flecks of red which is assumed was artificial crab meat. Call it deep fried cream cheese & green onion rangoon and you got yourself a winner! Crab meat rangoon-- complete and utter fail. However, I blame the people of Eat24 who gave this a \"what's good\" ranking. (2/5)\n\n~Mango Special with Chicken ($9.95): For being a \"Special\" there was nothing special about it. First time having cooked hot mango in a dish, and I'm not sure how I feel about it. Again this was a coworker's choice.(2/5)\n\n~Green Onion Pancake ($5.25): Yum. A bit dense, a bit greasy, but still very tasty. (4/5)\n\n~Tomato Beef Chow Mein ($7.25): OH. MY. GOD. A place that does a good tomato beef chow mein AND lists it on the menu?! I frequently order this with my family when we want chinese take out on the weekends for lunch, and our usual go-to is inconsistent. (We noticed they make it better on the weekdays--must be different chefs) I digress. ANYWAYS, I was pleasantly surprised how well this turned out. (5/5)\n\n~Sesame Balls (Free with order over $15): They gave us 3. Taste better eating them fresh rather than hours later. Nothing special, but it's free!\n\n~Steamed BBQ pork buns: This was a pleasant surprise! We knew we would get the free sesame balls, but the buns were an added bonus!

We made a HUGE mistake. We ordered three relatively simple items, Sizzling Rice Soup (w/ Chicken),  Beef & Broccoli, and Mu Shu Pork. They added free Pork Buns (not very good) and free sesame balls (decent) to the order, a nice touch, but not enough to raise them above the minimum 1 star.\n\nSizzling Rice Soup - this was the most edible of the three items, although the chicken was anything but white meat, however the broth, veggies and rice were good.\n\nMu Shu Pork - this was decent, however the pancakes were basically tortillas, not at all proper mu shu pancakes.\n\nBeef & Broccoli - this is what truly inspired me to write this review. It was awful, mushy overcooked broccoli that tasted like it had been sitting cooked for hours, and flavorless beef. \n\nThe whole meal left us feeling terrible and very unsatisfied, save yourself the stomach ache and order from somewhere else.", "author": "T B."}

I just ordered their Ma-Po Bean Curd and it is something so unusual and flavorful.  Ten times better than the usual offering of this dish at other restaurants.  The tiny slices of pork with perfectly-shaped tofu squares in a sauce that has a hint of hot and it is not gummy like so many are at other places. Fantastic.  My wonderful hubby ordered the spicy green beans and THAT dish was a revelation.  Those chefs really know how to cook--I would love to watch them perform their magic, but I am afraid of cleavers and knives!

Green Onion Pancakes. Do you like greasy bland dough with Sweet Peanut Butter? Order these. \n\n2. Seafood Chow Fun. My friend ordered the Chow Fun with Gravy not on the side.

After having used these guys for several years now, we recently had a really bad experience with the way we were treated by their staff.\n\nHaving ordered food for delivery, our chicken & broccoli came with just broccoli.  I rang to see if there had been a mistake and was instantly yelled at by the woman on the phone.  I asked here why she was yelling at me and could she simply speak to me several times, which seemed to make her annoyed.  That, and the fact that she barely stopped talking herself to let me speak when she asked a questions, got me really annoyed.\n\nThey offered to send something straight away or give credit for next time.  When I replied that based on the way I was currently being spoken to I wasn't sure if I would order there again, this seemed to infuriate and confuse here more.  She just kept asking me if I wanted to them to deliver it now or get a credit.  I said several times that I did not want to wait (I am 8 months pregnant and hungry - so just wanted to eat what we had by that time) and that I would not be ordering again given the customer service experienced.  \n\nAs she continued to yell at me on the phone, I just decided to hang up because there was no talking to the woman on the phone.  Two minutes later they rang back and I let it go to voice mail.  This time someone else placed the call wanting to know if I wanted the incorrect item to be redelivered.  Clearly the amount of times I said \"No, I don't want to have you deliver it again\" didn't get through the sound of the woman on the phone yelling at me.  \n\nDisappointing to say the least, as we really liked their food, but am moving on to new horizons where I don't get yelled at for checking on an incorrect order that was not my fault.", "author": "Danae R."}

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0w6dNMrpBQFLxhVYqx_J5Q?select=3wNiPOX1pN0Q5DGXG2KfSA)\nb) Green Onion Pancake - Served with two dipping sauces (peanut and sweet/sour), the pancakes also were browned well and the flavor was good; however, it wasa bit thick and doughy.  Not bad and not quite \"the Bomb\" as it was described on the show.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0w6dNMrpBQFLxhVYqx_J5Q?select=poDaMgtJYUUJ9SfgXIHLQw)\nc) Fried Chicken Wings appetizer - Your basic salt/pepper flavored fried wings.  I probably misordered as I expected the San Tung style wings that Euge mentioned.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0w6dNMrpBQFLxhVYqx_J5Q?select=5RUSLrPKzGwbohnSCRu5pA)\nd) Chicken and Black Bean Sauce Chow Fun - This was probably my favorite dish as the flavors were good and a good portion of tender chicken pieces, green peppers, and onions in a mild black bean sauce.  The portions were very generous.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0w6dNMrpBQFLxhVYqx_J5Q?select=dpBX0uAyDrIoq-Cu5mProA)\nWe came here with open minds and the restaurant did not disappoint.  Service was very good as they explained the various dipping sauces and even entertained my friend's baby girl as we ate.  However, the food was okay and the portions were pretty generous; they also provide sesame balls and fortune cookies as complimentary desserts.  Good spot to dine if you're craving Chinese food or the lines at Woodhouse or Chow are too long.", "author": "Mike C."}

This place is unique in the style of sauces used in their dishes.  It's okay to ask for lighter sauce, foods not so spicy, and to reiterate the old mantra, no MSG.  Some of the favorite standards are the salt & pepper pork, walnut shrimp, broccoli beef, and yee won-ton.  \n\nThe wait staff is very efficient, helpful, polite and the place is clean (ever eat lunch in a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown?). They work hard in making sure you have plenty of everything including tea.  My non-chopstick using friends appreciate the forks on the table without asking for them.\n\nThe favorite part is the dessert: black bean sesame balls, which are delicious and freshly prepared.  I grew up with these and the smaller size is just right which makes it tasty and not too greasy.  \n\nIn summary, Red Jade has its own unique flavors and style.  Folks are friendly and helpful, and the sesame balls are fantastic.  Thank you.", "author": "Stefan L."}

Beautiful, clean restaurant, kid friendly and really well priced.\n\nWe started with the onion pancake and potstickers. The Onion pancake is more cake like than we've had before and was really fluffy with great flavor. The potstickers were fantastic, pan seared  with a great crispy base and then stuffed with really tasty pork.\n\nFor main dishes we ordered sweet and sour chicken and kung pao ostrich along with pork friend rice. The rice was great - great texture and flavor but the two main dishes were the true stars. I never expect much out of sweet and sour anything, we usually order it for the kids. This dish was above and beyond! The chicken morsals were tender and moist and lightly fried with a nice crunch. The sweet and sour sauce was lighter and nicely sweet. It was THE best SS dish we've ever had, here in the U.S. or in China. I had to order the ostrich because I love it and have never seen it available in Chinese food before! It was amazing - really well cooked, tender and flavorful in a lightly spicy sauce.\n\nThey concluded the meal with fortune cookies and sesame pastry balls with red bean filling. \n\nOur entire meal, with soft drinks was less than $40 and everyone left happy and full.

I don't try to fool myself. When I go for Chinese, I prepare my stomach and know it may be grease-filled; that's okay. This is definitely flavorful and it is pretty nice ambiance.

The texture was fantastic. It was not too salty, and was paired well with the rice which was cooked perfectly. I hate if rice is too hard or too soft - bleh.\n\nThe portion size was so large that I couldn't finish it in one sitting, and decided to take it home to share with my loved ones for dinner.\n\nI also heard that they make party platters that are very affordable without sacrificing taste!

After the show was over we knew we had to try it especially the \"Best Green Onion Pancake in Bay Area.\" We made the track out to San Francisco and after battling to find parking got there. Cute place. \n\nBecause they were on the show there was a bit of a wait. We tried calling ahead for a reservation but all of the times where booked and only walk in was available. My Man and I joked about how many people where there as regulars v. viewers. As it turns out we ended up chatting with another lady who was waiting and had also come out because of the show. Ah, the power of marketing. \n\nThe place is small so it took about 25 minutes to get seated. We were so hungry and had stared at the menu for so long that we immediately placed our order. We ordered: \n\n- Pot stickers: They were not the worst I have had but by far not the best. Not to mention they don't have that yummy pot sticker sauce. :( \n- Dim Sum: Which my Man really enjoyed. \n- The Veggie Chow Mein: Was pretty yummy, but not delish. \n- Broccoli Chicken: This was bland and did not taste all that great. \n- Asparagus & Cashew Chicken: This tasted exactly like the broccoli chicken. \n\nBecause they were super busy it took forever to get our food.

When my friend stated that he wanted it refunded from the bill, the waiter stated that he could replace it with another dish because his boss had already left and couldn't do the refund.  We had it refunded.\n\nThe waiter brought our check over.  The ticket listed all the items we ordered, without the prices, the waiter only wrote down that the entire order was $50.  Considering our experience already, we decided to add up the bill on our own.  As we were referencing the prices on the menu and adding it up, the waiter came back over, grabbed the check and added all the prices to the ticket and the total with tax was a little over $47.

I'm having a really hard time getting used to paying for sides of rice in this city when it's free where I've lived before. One dollar for a bowl of rice would be questionable, but a two-dollar charge is shameless gouging. I make organic jasmine long grain rice at home all the time, and it's cheap! Really cheap! Anyway, most Chinese meals seem incomplete to me without rice so I order it and complain on Yelp! lol\n\nThe pork loin was very tasty, not greasy at all, not overcooked, and a good portion. So many Chinese restaurants present a beautiful large platter of beautifully battered fat and bone, but this was not the case with this dish. There were enough leftovers that I could make another meal at home.\n\nWhat I found especially interesting and encouraging was that when customers were still streaming in at 9:20, they were greeted warmly and seated with no mention that the restaurant was closing in ten minutes. Being greeted warmly is a refreshing change from what happens in most San Francisco Chinese restaurants.

And one that has great, fresh-tasting food can only mean one thing: a brain transplant.\r\n\r\nThat's why I am thrilled that a good friend of mine made me aware of Red Jade on Church. There are plenty of Chinese restaurants that deliver in my neck of SOMA, but they all seem to serve from the same vat of mystery brown sauce that covers all their food no matter what you order. Whatever it's made of, I believe it's the same ingredient that Ron Popeil uses in his spray-on hair aerosol can.\r\n\r\nRed Jade, on the other hand, serves fresh Mandarin cuisine superbly prepared. I can always tell how good a Chinese restaurant will be by their garlic chicken. I've been to one that actually deep fried their chicken like McNuggets and ladles some kind of goop with just a half-clove of garlic in it. At $6.95, Red Jade's is fresh with a light marinade but heavy on the garlic. I also like their tangy Fire House Spicy String Beans with Minced Pork ($6.95), heartier than your average veggie side, especially with all that meat.\r\n\r\nTheir $8.50 Lettuce Wraps are much better than what they serve at Long Life. The appetizers are worth a meal in themselves - the $3.95 Green Onion Pancake is flaky perfection, while the $5.95 House Special Dim Sum for Two is a nice treat without the burden of a Tourettes-screeching woman clanking by with a steam cart. Best of all, they offer lunch specials that range between $4.50 and $5.95 that include soup and rice. They even deliver the specials as long as you hit the $15.00 minimum.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the restaurant itself is perfectly nice and worth visiting. The service is fine, and I've yet to be there when the whole place has been crowded. But, c'mon, free delivery...how can you beat that?

And the white rice is good, too: it isn't overly dry, isn't too sticky or glutenous, and the grains aren't all broken up...so, a detail as small as the rice is noticed and cared for here. \n\nThere are a lot of vegetarian options, too, and this restaurant can accomodate large parties.  Their lunch specials are seriously inexpensive (think $4.25-6.25) and definitely fill you up!\n\nAs far as location, you couldn't ask for better:  It's right by Muni, in the midst of many things to do and places to go.  You can walk to a number of coffee shops, dessert places, clubs and bars from here, should you feel so inclined, and the neighborhood feels safe to walk around in, even very late at night.  The only downside is that parking seriously sucks in this neighborhood, so give yourself extra time to drive around and around for 10-20 minutes before finding a spot.  \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this place to people on dates, large groups, and anyone who is less concerned with food snobbery about how \"authentic\" their Chinese food is (I can hear it now: \"What?!  No chicken feet on their menu???  Honey, let's just go...\") and more concerned with just having a tasty, affordable meal in a nice environment.\n\n**Note:  If you're looking for \"Prawns with Walnuts\", ie, my favorite dish, you'll find it on their menu under the name \"A Happy Family\".  Don't ask me why.  Just order it :)", "author": "Amy L."}

If I had one word  to describe the food it would be \"satisfactory\".  I always walk out full and content but never bowled over. \n\nIn my experience Red Jade has two strong points. The first is the service.  The hostess and servers are always welcoming, attentive and proficient. I usually receive food recommendations that fit both the group and the budget appropriate to the dining occasion. \n\nThe second is the green onion pancakes. They are consistently good and their quality has not digressed each of the five times I have ordered them.  The pancakes come with three different sauces (hot mustard, peanut and the ubiquitous red sweet and sour) of Safeway Select quality. I find that a drizzle of soy with a splash of the house vinegar work best for me. \n\nOther good dishes are the Hong Kong Style pan-fried noodles with scallops and shrimp. The noodles are a nice crispy brown on the outside that gives way to wonderfully moist and chewy ones on the inside. The bok choy served with the seafood on top of the noodles is always very fresh and expertly cooked. \n\nI also enjoy the kung pao shrimp. I have had it three times and the shrimp is always plump, juicy and never overcooked. The sauce is just spicy enough and the veggies are usually fresh and crisp. \n\nDuds included the fried rice and pot stickers with the remainder of the items I have had being just meh to o.k. \n\nThe dining room is tastefully appointed for a midrange Chinese place. I cannot say the same for the soundtrack (which can be quite loud if you are unfortunate enough to be seated by a wall speaker). \n\nUltimately this is good place to meet up with friends when on a budget and am wanting to get some middle of the road Chinese.

General Tso's chicken was awesome, the pot stickers are an 8/10, Sizzling rice soup was great, Mongolian beef was so-so (a bit chewy). Overall the food was good quality, and very tasty. IT wasn't the best, but certainly good. Very affordable, I was able to feast with my wife for $30 and have plenty of leftovers.\n\nThe only problem I had was as follows. I called to find out the address and was met with a very hostile counter with the woman on the phone. I brushed it aside because I really wanted to try the food here. Well, during our meal, I noticed the woman answering the phones getting hostile with a customer. She began yelling at him, and rather loudly stated \"because your bothering me\" and abruptly hung up the phone on the person. I can only imagine the other person asking \"why are you being so rude?\" Several people in the restaurant noticed and we all looked at each other and kinda laughed. I thought it was kind of funny, but beware of the hostile woman. Maybe she was just having a bad day. \n\nThe food is worth trying, and I will go back if in the mood, and in the area.\n\nEDIT: I went back for a second go, and this place impressed me more, and I upped the rating to 5 stars. The Peking duck is amazing and rivals one served at the most expensive Chinese restaurant I know of in SF. The green onion pancake is also terrific.", "author": "Jon P."}

The delivery guy was a sweetie.  The food was great. (It's American Chinese food.  If you want Chinese Chinese food, try Ton Kiang.)

Seeing the Red Jade episode in July 2013 I looked forward to trying the place. Two of the diners really 'raved' over this green onion pancake. Well I ordered one this evening, and like some of the previous comments here, it was real waste of money. It was gummy, and completely lacking in flavor. Even the sauce that comes with the dish, had no definitive flavor or punch. I later realized that it was supposed to be a peanut sauce, but it was truly bland and watered down. A small pie, it's cut in 6 slices. I ate two and declined to take the rest home.\n\nI'm glad that someone else here, also noted the meat that was used in their beef dishes was horrible. I ordered the scallop and beef with Chinese broccoli. There were a few bits and pieces of scallops, but I swear, the meat tasted as if it had come out of a can.\n\nBesides the really distasteful meat, I'd asked them to make the dish 'spicy'. Well it arrived with a one whole small dried red chili pepper mixed in the dish, and what amounted to the emptying of a can of chili flakes which were stir-fried with the food. Every piece of meat had several chili flakes on them. Besides too much chili, the basic sauce also lacked flavor or direction.\n\nOkay, you might think I'm done, but my attempt to be tolerant and gracious came to an end, when a small black bug walked off of the broccoli. I tried to shoo it away, hoping it was just a gnat, but no...it wouldn't fly, it just walked around the rim of my plate.\n\nIn their favor, the waiter deducted 30% from my bill.

I spoke to the same man the second time, and after telling him I needed to pay with my card, he literally yelled \"please hurry up! I'm so busy!!\" at me over the phone.  I HATE to be rushed by customer service persons, so that made me want to go even slower.  I asked him to please calm down, and gently read him my credit card info.  Afterwards, he felt it necessary to let me know that he had 10 more phone calls after me.  Which is fine, apparently they're recession proof, good for you Red Jade.  But don't make me, a paying customer, feel like my business is unwanted.  \n\nSo when that delivery guy gets here, he will not be receiving a tip.

I knew they would get busy on a Friday night, so I called and placed my order at 4:20 pm. It was almost 6:00 pm when it finally arrived. Good food goes bad when it sits around (or rides around) for 90 minutes. When I called after an hour of waiting to ask where my food was I got the standard response, \"Oh, he'll be there any minute now.\" Well, he arrived after thirty more minutes with cold food and a bill for $50. I could drive to the restaurant in ten minutes and pick up my food, if there was anywhere to park. There isn't because all of Church Street is a bus zone now.

It wasn't a problem or an extra charge, which was nice.  Unfortunately, the brown rice tasted old and half cooked.  The spicy tangy chicken was good, but the chicken pieces were oddly small--think peanut sized.  It was odd.  The prices were all pretty good, but I would have gladly paid a little more for something special (and properly cooked brown rice).\n\nAnd then I sat.

They also put up with us graciously as we read fortunes aloud and added 'in bed' to the end as if it were incredibly original and hilarious, even though I'm sure I could hear their eyes rolling.\n\nThe food itself wasn't bad either. Fried rice, mango chicken, mu-shu pork, standard Chinese restaurant fare. Ostrich is on the menu but wasn't available at the time. We had a tomato chow mein dish that was a lot like spaghetti with ketchup (which is the only thing I wouldn't recommend) and General Tso's chicken as well.\n\nTso Tsingtung (1812-1885) was a brilliant Chinese general during the Qing dynasty. Merciless and effective on the battlefield, his army put down the Taiping and Nian rebellions and reclaimed portions of Xinjiang from invaders.\n\nHe was not known for his cooking. General Tso's chicken by most accounts was invented at one Chinese restaurant or another in NYC in the 1970s.

The appetizer plate was a fantastic deal with two each of pot stickers, crab rangoon, egg rolls, and fried chicken. The crab rangoon was rich and soooo sinful.

It also came with a decent sweet and sour sauce and a rather disappointing peanut sauce. \n\nWe settled on a plate of beef chow fun (my staple Chinese comfort food) and an order of black bean asparagus.

But it would not be in the true spirit of Yelp to only write good reviews, which I am guilty of usually doing. Plus all the positive reviews of Red Jade really started to get me riled up.\n\nLet me first state that due to the close proximity to my residence I have been to Red Jade more than a handful of times, mostly as take-out. If you are looking for something fried, greasy and sure to make your left side go numb the Fried Crab Meat Rangoon is a pretty safe bet. The potstickers, while less fried, are a pretty tasty deal. That, however, is about all that is remotely decent on the menu.\n\nThe soups are inedible with chunks of meat and veggies that are obviously (fresh) out of the freezer. You know, the type of chinese food where all the ingredients seem to be water-logged from de-thawing.\n\nEvery entree I have ordered has been as disappointing as a Jack Shepherd 'Lost' episode. If you order something crispy it will be soggy. If you order veggies they will be covered in glutenous goo. Not like this description is different from any other cheap chinese restaurant, it's just that Red Jade delivers the cheap and the chinese without the guilty payoff at the end.\n\nIn short, don't let the interior design fool you: Red Jade is no better than the buffet-style dim sum joints scattered about San Francisco.

I mean it shouldn't be about ordering the \"right thing\" they should make everything exceptional.", "author": "Chantay X."}

If you want reasonably priced, delicious, HOT, and quickly-delivered, slightly Americanized Mandarin-style Chinese takeout, Red Jade is your new favorite restaurant. My skeptical, unsure self ordered from delivery.com for the first time, and wondered how long it would be before they got to my house. Answer: in under a half hour. My lack of cash was even worse than my lack of fridge food, which was fine because I was able to pay the bill and tip with my credit card--yesss. \n\nAnd the food--sent from the takeout Chinese gods themselves. I was starving, and I got the vegetable egg rolls, sesame chicken, and szechuan sauteed broccoli, which all was easily enough for two to share. The chicken tasted like chicken (already it's winning me over), the sauce was sweet but not overpowering and the portion was huge. The broccoli was crisp and the sauce was delicious--I mixed the two dishes together and it was awesome. The egg rolls were nice and crispy, just as they should be.\n\nAnd, I got 2 FREE pork buns, 2 FREE sesame seed balls with red bean paste, and the usual fortune cookies to complete the meal. I'll have plenty left over for lunch and maybe even dinner again tomorrow, and it's good enough that I won't mind eating it that often.  I'll definitely be a repeat customer as long as I'm living in the Castro. Take note though--rice is not included unless you order it.", "author": "Allison G."}

She had seen a review on Check Please Bay Area recently and wanted to check it out especially the green onion pancakes that the reviewers had raved about.  We arrived at lunch and the lunch dishes were pretty standard.   I had the Sauteed Green Beans and she had the Garlic Chicken.  Both came with white rice and were good as was the Egg Drop soup that accompanied both luncheon dishes.  Of course we ordered the Green Onion cake which was delivered to our table after the soup was served but was served before our other dishes.  This is a nice touch only because at many Chinese Restaurants they serve all the dishes at once.  Red Jade paced it very nice.  You can imagine our surprise when the first bite of their touted onion cake was doughy and tasted uncooked.  We alerted our server who informed us that the onion cakes are crispy on the outside and are supposed to be soft on the inside.  Now Red Jade's onion cakes are the thickest that I've ever had, usually onion cakes are flat, these were a good inch or more thick which would explain why the inside was not fully cooked.  I was about to explain that to the server but she was insistent. The peanut sauce that was used for dipping was good however neither of us could have more than a couple of bites of Red Jade's doughy Green Onion cakes which would definitely NOT win any prizes for Best Onion Cakes. I'm not sure if the diners on the television show had ever had green onion cakes before, but Red Jade's are only good if your taste prefers an uncooked doughy center.\n\nThe other dishes were OK...but Red Jade doesn't offer anything more than just standard Chinese Food in a neighborhood that has absolutely no parking. \n\nOne last thing...the Sesame Balls that accompanied the fortune cookies and our bill were fabulous providing a nice sweet touch to what was a very ordinary meal.", "author": "Nick C."}

Red Jade completely surpassed my meager expectations... both in delivery and in house service.\n\nI first tried their food using the handy delivery.com service.  I placed my order with 8 minutes until the 10:00pm shutdown.  I had no problems and received my order within 20 minutes!  \n\nMy favorite, as others have mentioned, is the General Tso's chicken.  I'm a generally a fan of the sweet stuff like Sesame Chicken or Sweet and Sour Chicken, but this has enough kick to it without being too spicy for a spice-weenie like myself.  Don't get the Sesame Chicken if you're hoping for a kick... this one's pure sweet.\n\nThe other great thing about Red Jade is the very reasonable prices, for v. v. good chinese food!  I'm still in utter shock... if you order btw noon and 5 pm, take advantage of the rice plate lunch specials... for ~$6, you get heaping spoonfuls of white (or brown) rice and more heaping spoonfuls of your entree... plus soup, and the occasional freebie pork buns.\n\nAlso, don't let the sketchy \"Red Jade Chinese Restaurant\" sign fool you... I was expecting a lackluster interior when I finally took my stomach to the source.  On the contrary, they have a pretty decent setup in there... nice wood tables and chairs and cloth napkins.  Not too busy and decent service... dinner entrees run ~$7 and could easily feed two people.\n\nThis place rocks... AND it's cheaper and closer than Eric's!  In short, this is the best chinese food for the upper market area (esp., delivery)!!", "author": "Laura N."}

I order the sweet & sour chicken lunch special, with steamed rice.  The sweet & sour chicken is crispy, not soggy, with ample amounts of sweet & sour sauce, and the lunch special--an extraordinary deal at just under $6--includes soup (egg drop or a spectacular hot & sour with tofu and seaweed in it, depending on the day) & a pot of tea, both brought out before the main course.  It also includes a fortune cookie and small sesame ball for dessert, brought out with the check.\n\nThe service is amazing.  I normally don't like being waited on, because I honestly don't like the forced social interaction with strangers that entails, especially with tipping involved, which makes me feel like an American Idol judge, but these guys are great.  The soup & tea come out right after you order; the main course comes out right after the soup & tea; the plates are cleared and the check comes as soon as you finish the main course.  Other than that, they leave you alone to read Tom Tomorrow or Savage Love in the copies of the SF Weekly & Guardian you've brought over from nearby Aardvark Books.\n\nThe ambiance, also perfect.  Very clean, no tablecloths, paper napkins, a good amount of natural light if you sit toward the front of the restaurant, and nonintrusive muzak playing in the background.

It was chunks of battered who knows what and it tasted disgusting.It was the 1st time in my 31 yrs that i took 1 bite of my food and dumped the rest in the garbage.We also got spicy Mongolian beef which was fatty and gamey and I have more of a spice in my cornflakes ...Never again!to the chef at red jade try  Naan king road my usual for a proper dish", "author": "P B."}

And while they have the \"dim sum sampler\" I only really like the shrimp dumplings and steamed pork buns, and when I order it, I tell them that I only want those two things - which they oblige.  Not living in the inner richmond anymore made me crave dim sum like crazy, since its not as accesible down in the lower haight, but with Red Jade, I can get my fix anytime.\n\n 2) Sweet and sour pork.  Individually fried balls of pork-goodness in a sauce that tastes like candy!\n\n 3) This one time while I was waiting for my take-out order, my arm was leaning on the counter, and I knocked off one of the little knick-nacks which was on the counter.  The woman gave me the dirtiest look ever, and made me feel like I was going to hell.  But, the reason I love it, is because they have since forgotten about it and they haven't held it against me every time I come in, until i felt so uncomfortable I had to stop going in.  Because that would have been truly tragic (see #1 above)", "author": "Leigh c."}

After being born and raised in Asia, I have pretty high standards for Chinese food -- but I've also adjusted to Americhinese. \n\nThe food Red Jade actually didn't disappoint! The vegetarian hot and sour soup was deeeelicious AND they had white pepper on the table, so I didn't even have to ask. The \"vegetarian delight\" wasn't exactly delightful, but the broth had a nice flavor and the kale was delicious (a little heavy on the water chestnuts though). \n\nYou also get free tea with your meal, and the lunch specials are a total bargain: it's a TON of food! What sold me was the fact that they serve jin deui (sesame balls) with your bill... I haven't had those since Singapore! Kudos Red Jade, kudos.\n\nI have to admit, they lost a star for service. It was busy when we came in, but service was prompt. By the time we were ready for our check the place was empty (and no, we weren't there forever), but we ended up having to go ask for the bill.

I have many fond memories here from my high school days...more importantly, their combination wonton was very very good...so good that we come back again and again just because of it...now it's gone.\n\nAlright, we all must move on but it's hard and it's likely unfair to the new dig.  The place isn't the same - it's much nicer and cleaner but the homey and relaxed ambiance are gone.  I refused to go in a few times but finally broke down and decided to give them a try - hoping (praying) perhaps the same cooks are there...after all, they still have combination wonton on the menu...\n\nIt just didn't feel right to order just the wonton so we also ordered the chicken chow mein.  We asked them first what kind of noodles they use -the thin ones or the thick ones.  The answer was they had both and we can choose...we chose the thick one.\n\nThe combination wonton came first in this huge white bowl - normally that huge bowl would have put a smile on my face anywhere else but not here because I was hoping to see the round flat bowl they used before...sigh.  It looked ok and appeared to have all the right ingredients but it was missing the gravy on top.  Taste was alright, will I come to this hood where parking is a challenge for this - absolutely not.  The chow mein was tasty but on the oily side.  Besides fortune cookie, they also give out mini sesame balls - it was warm and pretty tasty.  If to go, they charge $0.40 each!\n\nOverall, it's ok and I will always remember Hong Kong Restaurant and my favorite combination wonton.", "author": "Gloria H."}

We also had the kung pao tofu which was OK but not outstanding.

We were both tired, cold and hungry and sought shelter at this humble abode. We were immediately seated in one of the best and larger tables even though there were plenty terrible, tiny tables all around. And then also immediately given water and hot tea. We ordered hot sake, a large bowl of hot and sour soup (WHICH WAS AMAZING), the spicy salt and pepper soft shell crab (perfect if you're looking for some terrible for you but tasty fried stuff) and the garlic chicken with a bowl of steamed rice. With all the food and plenty of leftovers to take home we walked around with under a $37 dollar bill.

Unfortunately, the temperature was about the only positive thing about the meal.\r\n\r\nThe soup was adequate; the broth was tasty but the proportion of broth to vegetables to meat was way off. The green onion pancake was okay.  The fried rice was a little dry, and they very obviously used frozen mixed vegetables. THe honey walnut prawns were absolutely disgusting. The prawns were rubbery and covered in a mayonnaise-like goop that overwhelmed the batter, but couldn't mask the fishy smell of old prawns.\r\n\r\nWhile prices are reasonable, you definitely get what you pay for in terms of quality. I will not be ordering from Red Jade again,  and the search for a good neighborhood Chinese food spot continues.", "author": "Cai O."}

So we come to red jade because my boy Kevin was like I used to come here everyday after school in high school to get the Mongolian beef. So pretty much the lunch special runs till 5pm which is pretty cool and you get a big ass plate of rice or whatever mandarin style side you like and a main dish for $5. So I got the Mongolian lamb and It was bomb and tasted good, the veggies mixed were good too and smothered with delicious sauce. So I mean $5 for pretty decent Chinese is not bad since its cheaper than Panda Express but its real legit. Service was good and I enjoyed the fact that after we were done we got fortune cookies and sesame balls filled with red bean paste NOM NOM NOM.

She got the Hunan fish and the vegetarian egg rolls. Our order total was a little over $17, including tax. Delivery was prompt and way faster than the 30 minutes quoted over the phone.  I was also pleasantly surprised to find, in addition to the two fortune cookies, two sesame balls. Apparently if you order over $15 in food they include a free dessert. Yay dessert!\nI didn't care for the soup that came with the meal, egg-drop-corn-something-gross kind of texture-soup of the day.  My meal was okay, not memorable but fresh and plentiful.

New food recommendations: the lettuce wraps are good. Nice, fresh lettuce and taste-full chicken. The dry-fried chicken wings are also tasty but they're very saucy so get ready to lick your fingers.\n\n-End of Update-\n\nThe Boyfriend introduced me to Red Jade after his protestations of Chow's Kitchen (which I found three-stars-acceptable). I was pleased to discover that the food is a step above Chow's but still three stars because it's not San Tung. The fried crab rangoon was about as good as anywhere else, as were the vegetarian egg rolls. The wok-fried beef fillet with snow peas was ok - the meat was decent, not too stringy. The kung pao chicken is average as is the General Tso's spicy boneless chicken. The steamed tofu with combination seafood was like Ma Po tofu or like Korean soon-doobu. The beef fried rice is actually pretty good - it might be my favorite dish here. I liked the beef chow fun ok too, but I thought there was too much beef (I know, strange complaint). The ratio was a little off. I do like how they give you free sesame balls/BBQ pork buns with your delivery order. There's a minimum $15 delivery charge and they're pretty fast - I'd say about 30-45 minutes, depending on where you live. You can order online, which I love, too.", "author": "Christine P."}

The general Tso's was good, but was over battered and over cooked. The Spicy Beef was sweeter than it was spicy. All in all, the food left us happy, without a Tiananmen Square incident in my tummy. Oh, and they give these pretty tasty sesame donut/ Lotus fruit snacks in addition to fortune cookies.\n    The service was great, love the neighborhood and Id go back if I were there again.

I and my friends are completely full and it only cost three of us only 20 bucks in total including tips and taxes.\n\nFor the dinner, I ordered\n\nHunan fish : similar quality with the rice plate I had before in lunch special. The fish was very good but some of them doesnot even have the taste of the Hunan sauce. Obviously, the fish was fried separately and they are not thoroughly mixed with the sauce so if you order it you will probably have to mix it yourself before eating.\n \nYee-Wor Wanton soup with chicken : basically this dish is a chicken broth with fried dumpling, chicken and bok-choy. The broth was plain but with a little bit of szechuan chili paste (they have it on the table) and some soy sauce, It is very good. Chicken was highly palatable but the dumpling is not that special.\n\nGeneral Tso chicken : this is a real HIT for this restaurant. One of the BEST General Tso I have ever had.

I have to say, we were very disappointed. We ordered orange chicken, Mongolian beef, and the Hong Kong pan fried noodles with seafood. \n\nThe orange chicken was terrible. It came with the sauce on the side, so when I initially opened the chicken I noticed that it appeared as if it had been frozen and then thawed for this occasion. The sauce was thin, and tasted synthetic - almost like a citrus household cleaner. Honestly, you can get better frozen asian-style chicken from Trader Joe's. The beef was nothing to write home about - not terrible, but not good either. I've definitely had better before. The noodles seemed to be half pan fried. The top edges were crispy, but the bottom was soggy. There was no sauce or flavor to the dish. \n\nWhile the food was mostly lackluster, there were some upsides to the meal. The delivery service was right on time, and the food was hot. It was also very convenient to order online. In addition, we received free BBQ pork buns with our meal, and those were fairly good. \n\nOverall, I would say that there is definitely better Chinese food out there. It might just be that we happened to order the wrong dishes and missed the real gems at Red Jade. However, from my experience, I would say that you're better off eating elsewhere.", "author": "Lisa H."}

I would say though as a preface to this review, there are some items on the menu that I've tried and not especially liked. I'm not sure if this is my own preferences or what. Anyway these are my favorite dishes at Red Jade for sure. Try the Green Onion Pancake. It's the best I've ever had. Then the Fried Crab Meat Rangoon, as well as the Pot Stickers. The Combination Plate Appetizers is amazing too if you want to share with others. My favorites on the entree menu are Walnut Prawns With Honey Dew Melon, House Eggplant Special, Peking Duck Special (order first thing), Original Dry Fried Chicken and any scallop dish. I like all the different Fun plates as well but they're pretty fattening if you're on a diet. Most of the other entree-type items are good but of course I haven't tried them all yet. Also I would advise that you go to this place during the week if you can because weekends are fairly crowded and the kitchen can't always keep up with the demand.

But DANM!!! the food was great.\n\nProbably the best Americanized Chinese food I have ever had. \n\nLook, I love going to china town (Oakland) and getting a real deal Chinese meal. But this is the best take out I have ever had in SF.\n\nFast forward to last night. I decided to get some Chinese food with some friends and we wanted to go out to eat, I decided to give the red jade dine in experience a try.\n\nAnother great idea.\n\nI love this place, I mean $2.50 beers, 20 bucks for a bottle of wine and the food was fresh out the kitchen. The service was great, super friendly and totally on top of the water situation. \n\nRed jade you have done me right, dine in or take out this place is on point.", "author": "Derek d."}

You'll get the usual american tourist options of sweet and sour pork over rice, mongolian beef over rice, shrimp fried rice, beef chow fun, etc, but it's all pretty good and inexpensive.($5.95 or so) if we take a coworker out for their birthday or some other big celebration like a promotion, we'll order the family style dinner/lunch of orange chicken, garlic egg plant, brown rice, bbq beef, some kinda \"jean-mean\", walnut shrimp, and vege plate. all of the plates are good but the bbq beef is so-so and kinda tough. i've never tried the onion pancakes. probably the only thing i don't like is when the bill comes, there's no breakdown. all they have is what you order, and the total amount. they say the tip isn't included even with a party of 6 or more, and there's no \"tax\" line. not bad enough to stop going back, but this practice is questionable.", "author": "Hagow C."}

We moved to a new area, but still come back for their food. I see the same waitresses and waiters each visit which leads me to believe it is family owned. Service is quick and efficient, and the food is served fresh and piping hot. The wait staff takes care of filling waters, removing empty plates from all tables ensuring that no table is left unattended. The only problem I have  when I am here is to stop from eating. The food is so delicious that I tend to forget that I am full and I am just eating because the food is incredible!

Soup, brown rice, entree, tea, sesame cookies (made onsite) for $5.50! I like that the menu has many spicy dishes and they are not afraid to turn up the heat if you ask. The lemon chicken, twice cooked pork, spicy salted spare ribs, Mongolian beef, moo shu pork, and dim sum are all winners. The staff is friendly and efficient. And the bathrooms are always spotless which says tons about how they run the restaurant. And when I saw my Chinese plumber having lunch there with his work crew, It reinforced my belief that this place is the real deal.", "author": "Jimmy R."}

Since Red Jade has taken its place, the decor has been upgraded and the food has never come up to the level of HK.  I decided to give them another chance and went in for some seafood chowmein.  The calimari was like rubber, so tough that I could not bite through it.  The rest of the seafood was ok but some of the crispy noodles were burnt.  I took the squid out of the dish and sent it back to the kitchen asking that he return with the calimari redone.\nThey did not do this and tried to minimize how they had ruined the dish with squid so tough that it should not have been plated!\nFor great noodles in that block, go to CHOW for Smiling Noodles which is what I will do in the future.  \nFor great seafood noodles go to Broadway/ Columbus and they will not disappoint.  They have a great sculpture right on the corner which you can watch while you are eating.  It is motion activated and has many books in the air that light up when someone is near.  On the ground on the cement are many words, some foreign.  This sculpture leaves me with a loss for words--it must be experienced.  Enjoy", "author": "L H."}

They are super friendly (which almost always makes me a fan...) and were very accommodating. We have a 2 yr old boy and a 6 month old boy. They helped us get set up at the table and helped us store our stroller away out of the main dining area. For all parents with young kids out there, this place is very kid friendly. The waitress brought an extra free bowl of soup for our son, even though we only ordered 2 lunch specials. The food is pretty good - not the best chinese I've had but for the price? Definately worth it. Plus they give you kick ass sesame balls and fortune cookies at the end of your meal. Forget the fortune cookies - just give me the sesame balls!", "author": "Jo A."}

Conviently located in my old hood (Church and Market) they deliver to my new hood (Glen Park) and they have the best-ever General Tso's Chicken.  Now, I hate to say this, but I discovered the General at a Safeway in Seattle several years ago, and have since tried every General Tso's I come across.  This dish, from Red Jade, is something I get every, every, time I eat Chinese, and every, every time I eat Chinese I eat Red Jade.  Sometimes I call in and order General Tso's and brown rice, and I swear they know who I am from the order.  If I stop in to get an order to go I sit and drink a Tsing Tao beer and revel in the busy atmosphere.  It's an all around great place for delivery, take-out, or dining in.  And in addition to the General Tso's, the Walnut Prawns are absolutely delicious.

After walking around the city for 4 hours or so we decided to hit up a place back near our apartment only to wish we'd stopped anywhere else during the four hour walk.  The service was prompt but to the point of annoying where we had 3 separate people come up to our table within the first 2 minutes of being there to ask us if we were ready to order, not even giving us a chance to look at the menu.  We then preceded to order an entire array of 6 dishes so that we could share and experience all the food.  None of them were good.  The food was either bland, or oily, or just downright inedible.
