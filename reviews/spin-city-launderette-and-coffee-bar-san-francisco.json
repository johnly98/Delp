{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-02-21", "description": "Wow.\n\nI've been doing my laundry here for a few years now and the only reason is its proximity to my home. It's a pretty poorly run operation. On any given day at least 40-50% of the washers and dryers are out of order. The ATM doesn't work either. Thankfully, the change machine was always functioning.  I'm not sure if the coffee is a separate business from the laundromat, but the coffee is good. Now comes the 'wow' part. A few weeks ago I noticed a washer that wasn't draining and had standing, discolored water in it. It had probably been like that for at least a few days or more. I remember mentioning it to someone that worked there. I stumbled upon the same washer again today, at least a few weeks later. The water is still there, was an opaque black color, and had a mat of mold or something equally nasty on top (see photos below). Truly horrific with a literally breath-taking smell.  I mentioned it to the woman who was working there and she thanked me for informing her (in her most patronizing tone, I'd wager) and said she was aware and would clean it up. When I mentioned that it was a health hazard to prepare food 10 feet from this mess (black mold, E. coli, mildew, and who knows what else is in there) she again thanked me and went back to talking to her friend. She closed up shop and left a few minutes later. The lack of concern with regard to a toxic situation was also breathtaking. I'm wondering if it will ever be cleaned. I'll never find out but I'm sure the Health Dept. will now that it's on their radar.", "author": "el r."}

I arrived to see they'd removed half of their smaller washers and replaced the large stainless steel folding area with tables for drinking coffee at. They seem to have put some sort of bare wood counter where the washers used to be, but it's also a chalkboard for the neighborhood kids. It feels like this is a clear message that this is not a place for people like me who go there to do laundry. The wood is less than sanitary and I don't want chalk on my clothes or little kids under my legs.\n\nI understand it must be nice to be a part of the  neighborhood, with families stopping by with kids and dogs to buy coffee (who all comment how they love the tables, yet do not sit at them), so maybe that's why they are focusing their business on the coffee part. Because I can't do laundry here anymore, there is no space to fold anything if there are more than two other people doing laundry in there besides you. :(", "author": "Christopher J."}

The woman is always extremely rude and unhelpful if there is any issue related to the laundry machines. She actively ignores customers to talk with her friends. \n\n- It's expensive, and increasingly so.

It's THE destination for coffee, lattes, donuts, pastries, other cafe delights and of course, freshly cleaned laundry. As they say, \"if you're truly in the Noe, then you know Spin City.\"\n\nTheir flagship drip-coffee is flavorful, intriguing and reliable. I'd stick in an IV and pump it all day long if that were appropriate. The beans are all sourced locally and ground on the spot, making for a genuinely fresh cup of joe.\n\nTheir baked goods, which are sourced from various local bakers, are not your typical run-of-the-mill pastries. Each item has a unique twist that makes it especially delectable. Two personal favorites of mine are the Lemon Buttermilk Powdered Donut and the Maple Glazed Bacon Apple Donut (both from Dynamo).\n\nLast but certainly not least, the baristas at Spin City are always inviting and open to making pleasant small talk if your java has you feeling chatty. And if you're a furry, four-legged friend then you are more than likely to receive a tasty treat upon your visit!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-24", "description": "I did something I have never done before.  I went to a public laundromat.  And I liked it.\n\nSince my 2nd year of college, I've sent my laundry out for wash 'n' fold OR have lived places with a W/D inside my apartment.  On the east coast, for 20-some years--in several cities--wash 'n' fold has been a constant delight. The laundry is whisked away, and returns beautifully folded and sorted (often according to color, sox rolled in neat balls, etc.). It's an indulgence almost as satisfying as a full-body massage. \n\nBut here in San Francisco, it's been a battle. For 4 years, I've used wash 'n' fold services all over the City, and the results have not once been as good as:  (a) I would do myself with my own washer and dryer, or (b) east coast laundry services.  \n\nMost recently---I gave them 10 tries---was Rinse. The customer service cannot be improved upon---the delivery aspect is par excellence, bar none.  The **laundry** is mediocre at best. On the east coast I would expect and get A or A+ laundry returned to me.  With all the services in San Francisco, including Rinse, it was at very best B- and more likely a C or C+.\n\nSo------for the first time in my life---I realized I had to actually GO to a public laundromat. I put it off for 6 weeks, until I had not one shred of clothing to wear,  I dreaded the prospect---and hoped this wasn't a sign I was coming down in the world. Next I would be selling pencils and plastic mugs on Mission Street. \n\nI Yelped highest rated places, and looked at photos. I liked that this place has coffee. The photos were encouraging. Noe Valley isn't my hood or my peeps, but likely the least offensive place in the City to go to a public laundromat.  Couldn't have been more right.\n\n Spin City Launderette & Coffee Bar  is so awesome.  Had a refreshing flavorful cold-pressed coffee ($4) and a couple of unreal cookies, hooked up to WiFi, and proceeded to navigate the system----getting quarters----figuring out the machines.  MaryCar the woman running the cafe was helpful in figuring things out, as were some of the charming literate friendly neighborhood patrons--all of whom seem to love MaryCar.  \n\nFor the first time in 4 years I have sparkling clean, perfectly done laundry---and it was totally painless. In fact, it was almost pleasant. And it was actually fun talking to such nice, interesting people.  Not \"laundromat denizens\"---the prospect of hanging out with for hours, as said, had led to 6 weeks of procrastination.  Clean, no smells, tons of room, sunny, plants, attractive art, and machines that got the job done. Who could ask for more. I am glad for such a pleasant experience.

She's funny, unpretentious, and outgoing, and as if that all weren't enough, she also makes great coffee. The other barista Zach is also wonderful. Not an ounce of attitude from either of them, unlike a lot of other high-end coffee places. \n\nThey also have delicious pastries from local vendors. These aren't your regular City Bake selection - there's Dynamo Donut, sea salt chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter cupcakes...awesome stuff.\n\nLast bit of loveliness: there is a real sense of neighborhood community in here.

We don't use the launderette, but we've made the trek here on the weekends for coffee. As Prattle P. points out, the coffee options in Noe Valley are, ahem, underwhelming, so Spin City is a welcome addition.  Blue Bottle Coffee, tasty baked goods, and friendly service - nice!  Mary remembered my son's name, and had organic treats for our dog.", "author": "Blake M."}

I ordered a usual regular cup of coffee and from the corner of my eye, I saw her look at me totally perplexed.  She immediately asked in disdain, \"Why did you NOT order the Goat Milk Latte?\" Having been brought back to reality, I changed my order.  At first I didn't add agave syrup, but decided to go the distance.  Before I reached the door, I had consumed half of the drink.  She offered me a taste of the macaroon, and proceeded to nearly finish the elixir.  Never had I a better caffeinated drink.  Thank you Lady Katherine, and 5 stars to spin (10 if the option were available!)", "author": "Matt L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-20", "description": "I haven't been here to do my laundry, but the new coffee shop that just moved in is wonderful. Marycar (the barista whose name I've probably massacred) is very knowledgeable about coffee and the different roasts that are available through my most beloved Blue Bottle Coffee. It's worth paying the $2.50 for a single cup of coffee when you see intricate steps taken to make it. I just hope that they stock up on beans. They had almost run out when I was there on Monday, and did not yet have any beans available to purchase. According to the barista, they will very soon. I will be going back on my morning walks!", "author": "Anne K."}
