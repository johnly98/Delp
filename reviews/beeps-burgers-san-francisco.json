This joint has been on Ocean for years and I grew up in the neighborhood but honestly didn't try this place until a few years ago. Totally regret choosing McDonald's over Beeps!\n\nI've gotten the normal burger, turkey burger, and chicken strips. They've all been good and the bun is much higher quality than other places. Kind of reminds me of a shake shack burger.\n\nThe drive thru concept makes this place a lot cooler and easier for parking (ocean avenue parking can be impossible).", "author": "Mary X."}

I don't typically crave burgers or sandwiches but whenever I am in san francisco, I crave Beep's. \n\nBeep's is a drive in restaurant. They have plenty of parking and you order at the cashier. There are a few tables for outdoor seating.\n\nThe chicken sandwich is so amazing! I love the slaw since it's not too flavorful and complements the crispiness of the chicken well.

Menu has tons including corn dogs, chicken nuggets, and milkshakes! Outside seating only.\n\nI loved this place! Honestly I was blown away at how much stuff they have on their menu. Most places have some burgers and wings and fries with a couple options for toppings. Not Beep's! Beep's has corn dogs, jalapeno poppers, chicken nuggets, fries, curly fries, garlic fries, milkshakes, etc etc etc. Pretty much any typically American burger-and-hot-dog type food you can find here! You can also find lots of different types of 'burgers': chicken, fish, etc.\n\nThe burgers are great too. They're hot and fresh, and I ordered extra cheese so the burger was gooey and delicious. The patty is slightly crispy on the edges and meaty on the inside. The sandwich itself is huge and will leave you full forever, pretty much. I like my milkshakes almost too thick to drink, which is how they serve them as Beep's. The chocolate is delicious and doesn't taste chalky like a lot of chocolate shakes do.\n\nI'd say the only thing I really didn't like about Beep's was that it's outside seating on bar stools around the stand, so it's kind of annoying because everything will blow away while you eat and your fingers are greasy and it's just kind of a mess...\n\nBut it's worth it!", "author": "Claire C."}

You see I've been out of the Yelp review game for quite awhile but as I took that first bite...I realized that there are still things in this world worth reviewing. Now without a further a do...Beep's Burgers, a humble burger shack, taking it's rightful place on Ocean. It serves as a reminder that sometimes it is the simple things in life that reveal the most beauty. A burger joint of humble beginnings yet profound results. No hipster twists, instagramable trends, or food network stardom. Strap on your seatbelts cause it's just you and the burger baby.\n\nI ordered a 1/4lb Beep's Burgers (with cheese and bacon) with a side of curly fries for $13.02. And I gotta tell you as far as first bites go, that was the most memorable, fireworks in the brain inducing first bite I have ever taken of a burger. And get this, that first bite wasn't because the juicy quarter lb sweet baby jesus of a burger patty (which i'll get to later) it was because that god damn BUNS. Traditionally burger buns are toasted and I don't believe Beep's toasts their buns if not lightly toasted. But what it lacks in crunchy toastedness it makes up in divine texture. That first bite welcomed me to the buns of the most beloved angel of God Almighty, whos buns are the fluffiest, pillowy, and cushiony buns ever to land upon my taste buds. It served as the royal throne to its burger royalty. Ya kno sometimes the burger chooses the bun but today the bun chose the burger.\n\nNow for the burger itself. I tell you Beep's Burgers gets it. It is a testement to how simple, fresh ingredients pay big dividends. The 1/4 burger was not lacking it was thicc, it was juicy, its a burger you wanna take on a nice date. The lettuce provided that nice thin layer of crunch. I dont usually like tomatoes in my burgers but I tell you that lovely slice of tomato gave the perfect sweetness and juiciness that meshed well with the burger and tangy Beep's Sauce. Look as a Californian I always slept,ate,breathed, and believed in In&Out as my favorite burger. Cant lie Beep's makes you question what you know as the truth. While In&Out may have the heart of the kid in me...Beep's Burgers resembles manhood's appreciation of the simple things in life. Oh Beep's Burgers until our paths intertwine again...", "author": "Adrian E."}

I also had the veggie burger with grilled mushrooms and jalapenos with Beep's sauce on a Semifreddi bun. Both of these were surprisingly tasty, and the both burgers were so juicy and warm.

I have to say the burger was good, I mean you cannot go wrong with  a burger and the garlic fries were good as well, you can def taste the garlic. The chicken sandwich was cooked perfect, the chicken was not dry at all.

They have a microphone to let you know that your order is ready. The fries and shakes are my favorite things to order here. It's not ver coward and I love it as one of the last drive up eateries in San Francisco. This place is a lifesaver for students at city college looking for lunch, dinner or a snack. You can park here in your car and wait for your order or walk it's accessible by public transit. I also ran into a childhood friend and his daughter when I came here.

It's just your usual components of a burger with a  beef patty, cheese, lettuce, onions, tomatoes and pickles but everything was fresh and wasn't poorly constructed so it tasted great.  The bun was sweet and soft, but didn't break apart from the grease of the burger.  The fries were warm and crunchy with large portions.

Upon reading some of the mixed reviews, I was hesitant to come here, but my friend wanted to try it, so I obliged.\n\nTLDR: delicious burgers, even better fries!!\n\nTHE BURGER WAS DELICIOUS. It was, I think, $6.35 for a 1/4 pound cheeseburger, which is fair for San Francisco pricing. In n Out is what.. $3? But it's also further out in Daly City, and a chain.\n\nI got the Beep's burger which meant that it comes with their house sauce - I didn't really detect the taste of it, though I saw some orange, so I'll need to ask for more next time. Initially it looked pretty underwhelming as the bun top wasn't fluffy (this ain't a nice gourmet sit-down!) but they do use a good quality Semifreddo brand bread (a brioche?).\nFresh vegetable toppings (tomato, BUTTER lettuce(?), not the cheap iceberg shit that oxidizes hella fast, and onion)\nThe patty itself was perfectly grilled to a juicy, oily, meaty medium level and it was the perfect ratio of toppings, bread, and meat in one bite. Not too messy and very hearty, so I didn't feel 'ripped off' with the portion and quality. Definitely got a good 8 bites out of it or so - a good small dinner.\n\nNOW.. even though this place is called Beep's BURGERS, their criss-cut fries are the best I've had! I'm fairly certain they don't use fresh potatoes for these, but they were extremely light, extremely crispy (haven't seen a crisp like this at a fast food joint), and not too oily. How the hell do y'all prep and cook these? I NEED TO KNOW!\n\nA very solid place if you're in the area hankerin' for some good burgers and fries!!", "author": "Emily C."}

Leave it to my mom to shoot down any of my requests. *le sigh*\n\n\"Aiya, it's too expensifey...\", she would say.\n\nIn my mom's eyes, anything over $1 for a drink and $4 for a meal was \"expensifey\" so we rarely ate out unless she was using a B1G1 free coupon. If you ever see an older Chinesey lady dressed like Peg Bundy with electric blue eyeliner and hooker red lips at Olive Garden in Stonestown, that's my mom...and next to her, you will find her bag filled with [endless] breadsticks. =/\n\n25 eons later, Mr. NSS, Tater Tot, and I were passing through and decided to stop by Beep's for a quick bite since I saw they had one lone picnic table available (plus 4 counter seats). Come with patience as I learned this is not a place for a \"quick bite\". I was third in line to order and it took over 25 minutes to receive our order. At least Tater Tot got a nice bootie sniffing session with Rufus, an adorable chocolate lab puppy. Another customer who placed an order over the phone was quite irate when he was quoted 5 minutes but had to wait an additional 20 minutes.  \n\nFrom what I read Beep's has changed owners several times since their inception in the 1960s. It's now Asian-owned so in addition to burgers (beef, salmon, turkey), sandwiches, fish & chips, corn dogs, chicken nuggets, shakes, they have teriyaki rice plates on the menu. Everything is reasonably priced under $8. CC's accepted. \n\nI ordered the \u00bc Pounder Basket w/ cheese ($5.40 +.35) and Mr. NSS ordered Fish & Chips ($5.95) http://bit.ly/1EAD8x0. We also ordered 6 Mini Corn Dogs ($2.40?). \n\nMaybe we came on an off day but we found the food to be less than subpar and I wasn't expecting much either. \n\nMy burger patty felt like it was flattened one too many times with a metal spatula. It was as thin as the tomato slices, overcooked, and very dry. Together with a heaping amount of iceberg lettuce, and a huge untoasted bun, all I could taste was the bun and lettuce. The special sauce was like a sweet & sour sauce which gave it an Asian flair that I personally didn't care for. Next time, I would ask for ketchup and mustard only. At this price point, J. Georgie's on San Bruno Avenue makes a much better old-skool burger: http://www.yelp.com/biz/jim-georgies-donuts-san-francisco. \n\nThe mini corn dogs were overfried so the batter was cracked and was very hard. Another Yelper had mentioned that the hot dog texture was between a pencil eraser and a hot dog. I have to agree the texture was really weird; like funky mystery meat.\n\nI'm a skinny fries girl but the steak fries were really good here. Crunchy around the edges and soft on the inside. Lightly salted. It was the best thing we had that day. \n\nI'm hoping our lackluster experience was just a fluke. There's no shortage of yipster spots with booty raping prices in SF so it's nice to see SF institutions like Beep's still alive and well.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The patties are juicy, the lettuce is fresh, and the buns are perfectly slightly crispy around the edges (that's a weird detail to include, I know).

In terms of food, Beep's easily beats Whiz for quality and price. Overall, I give it 3.5 stars.\n\nAccording to old rumors, both had carhop service back in the 60s. And also both places had multiple ownership changes. A newspaper article mentions that Beep's current owner is Samantha W., a former regular customer when she was a student at SFSU, now working to preserve this piece of SF history.\n\nI love the crispy steak fries!!\nI also like the milkshakes, but I didn't get one this time.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beeps-burgers-san-francisco#2ZEq6fA7N97gJwqfvfNBoQ\n\nThe burgers are okay. They put a unique secret sauce inside (passed down from the original owners, part of SF history, I've been told). It's sweet and orange, probably a ketchup mixture but it's not thousand island. It's not the best burger in the city but decent enough and satisfying for the price. In comparison, Bullshead Restaurant (a favorite of mine, in West Portal) uses a much better meat burger patty, but their burgers also cost a bit more. I crave the fries far more than the burger, so I got the combo.\n\nTips:\n\nAbout the long waiting time...\nIt takes at least 8 minutes to fully cook a regular burger patty. Most fast food chains (McD's, BK, etc.) use a custom cooking press to cook their burgers on both sides at the same time, so that's why they're faster.\n\nThere's only 1 table on the side of this restaurant.

Simple, old fashioned, perfectly cooked, and affordable (about $5.00).  They are like the ideal combination of In-N-Out and Shake Shack.  The 1/4 pound burger patty is thin, crispy on the outside/edges, and juicy on the inside like Shake Shack.  It is clearly homemade and hand-formed.  The bun is more substantial than Shake Shack, more like In-N-Out, but still soft like Shake Shack.  The Beep's sauce is good, but I could go either way on that versus mayo.  The veggie toppings - lettuce, tomato, and pickles - are all fresh and good-quality.\n\nThe whole dill pickle side dish is surprisingly tasty.  Way better than the version you can buy at the movie theater.  Chilled, crispy, and fresh-tasting. The curly fries are enjoyable but not necessarily revelatory.\n\nI love the old fashioned signage and styling.  I'll definitely keep coming back and supporting them.

This place will always have a special place in my heart, unfortunately these days it's only because of its nostalgic value. \n\nOwnership changed a couple years ago. At first they made modest changes to the menu, that was okay. It wasn't quite the same, but they got higher quality meat I guess, which I'm all for. \n\nYesterday I went to beeps for the first time in a few months to find out that they no longer had the cheese steak. Seriously the best thing on the menu for the last 20 years that I've been going to beeps. That was disappointing. \n\nSo I ordered a burger instead. Wtf y'all?! I know the city is becoming gentrified and there's a whole foods across the street that used to be a crappy auto parts store. But that burger was the most pathetic attempt to be a gourmet burger I've ever witnessed. Just because the block is changing doesn't mean you have to try so hard. Special seasoning and wannabe aioli type shit isn't gonna be popular forever, it's a trend. Once you've added that component, your no longer a drive thru burger spot. Your a trendy attempt to grab hipster dollars. As you may have realized, that business model typically does not last. \n\nThe only reason I gave beeps 3 stars is because of nostalgia, which is now fading into a distant memory of what San Franciscan culture was. \n\nI sincerely hope you bring back the cheesesteak and knock it off with the crappy \"attempted gourmet\" sauce/seasonings. That shit won't be popular forever. However classic American food at a drive in, will always has a place in our local economy. Sincerely- A", "author": "adrian s."}

For about the same price as a McDonald's Double Quarter Pounder Meal, you get a infinitely superior Beep's 1/2 lb Burger with hearty fries. Sure, it's minus the drink you'd get at McD's. But who's looking to get sugared up these days? Beep's burgers weren't gourmet, sure. Perhaps bought their patties frozen elsewhere (though, if true, they were damn good pre-made patties), who knows? But the value drew people to Beep's. You never feel cheated or ripped off when you leave.\n\nAnd all that have ended last month or so. Just yesterday I've came to Beep's burger after a month long trip oversea.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if this was due to a new owner or not. The burger patties had changed to the somewhat loose kind, the kind you get at those fancier hip burger joints. Which's fine, I do enjoy those. But what's unforgivable is that the good old 1/2 lb Burger has had a HUGE price jump from $6.75 with fries included, to $8.00 WITHOUT fries. And what I get instead is a burger with those loose patties, fancy thousand island looking sauce, and what looked like artisan buns. Oh, and NO fries.\n\nThe same thing have happened to other items on the menu as well. Bottom line is that you're now more or less paying the restaurant price for burgers at a road side joint. The value had been utterly destroyed at Beep's burger. Perhaps whoever runs the place now is looking to attract the hipster crowd that frequent the Whole Food store across the street. But it doesn't appear to work out well for Beep's, for obvious reasons. I was there this Friday at the time of this review. It was during dinner time, I barely see anybody there picking up their orders. I did, however see a few people looking at the new price listed on the window and then turned away. Or perhaps I was there during the wrong hour?\n\nLook, I'm not against the whole hipping up the place. I even think their new 8 dollar 1/2 lb burger was pretty good (not nearly good enough to worth 8 bucks without fries, though). But name those new fancy burgers Beep's Gourmet Special Burger or something. And leave the good old fair priced 1/2 and 1/4 burgers on the menu for those of us who came for the value year after year.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-01", "description": "Burgers are getting carried away with some going for more than a hundred dollars, and yet I've found that spending more for ground beef (even when it's ground steak) topped with any of a ridiculous number of vegetables and other accoutrement are generally not good burgers, just expensive.   Brioche may have its merits, but on a burger it's usually stiff, covered with grease from the grill and not very soft.   Brioche also holds up poorly, often dumping much of the burger onto your plate well before you've finished with it.  Sour dough takes so much crushing power to tear off, the burger is often smashed out of the bun before making it to your mouth.\n\nSometimes Tradition is a virtue.\n\nIf I wanted to improve the Beeps burger, I'd use a sesame bun, as they use a basic hamburger bun without the seeds.  But that's it.  I compare Beeps to places similar, from It's Tops to Cable Car Burgers (on California) and Grubstake Diner, not the sit-down restaurants that tend to go for silly burgers that add junk to justify the inflated price.\n\nI order burgers these days without the veggies, at least on the first visit, until I know what sort of bun they're using.  I also try to order American Cheese, although I'd never eat it in any other context.  Medium, not rare, but they usually come well done.  Didn't even have to ask about the medium, and American cheese was available here.  Pale pink center on a hot patty;  lightly seasoned full beef flavor;  soft warm bun.  Perfect.  One of the very best burgers I've had;  surpassing Burger Meister, which is very good, and possibly even Smash Burger (although this is more of a fast food chain-level burger) which means it's better than In N Out (again, also a chain burger but not like the BIG meat-product burger corporations)\n\nI only had the burger so I can't comment on how the fries are.

Generally our favorite quick burger spot in the city is Super Duper, and we thought Beep's was better.  The burgers were really tasty, obviously fresh ground and hand made patties, and they use Nieman Ranch beef.  The buns were soft and really tasty (note - some photos posted show buns with seeds.  These did not have seeds, seemed like a nicer bun than those in older photos).  Nice variety of toppings, all really fresh and generous amounts.  And the menu is big with a lot of variety - different kinds of fries, fried chicken sandwich, shakes, and breakfast sandwiches.  The order area is very clean, signs are nicely done, and I love the retro feel of the place.  \n\nBurgers come with lettuce and tomato.  Onions and pickles are free to add, and then other toppings are available at different (reasonable) prices.\n\nWe had a 1/4 beeps burger with cheddar and with grilled onions and pickles added, a 1/2 burger (2 1/4 patties) with cheddar and avocado added, two orders of the regular fries (really good!!), an order of onion rings (very tasty), a root beer, and a large milkshake for $30.  It was too much food and in the future we would get 1 fry and a small milkshake instead.  We were completely satisfied after - everything a good size and generous portions.  Food came out pretty quickly and it looks like you can call in an order as well.  Overall I thought it was terrific and will be back again and again!  Next time I will get a cone too.\n\nPlease note that Beep's was taken over by a new owner pretty recently - so I don't think ratings from before the past year or so are very relevant anymore.  And despite some of the reviews saying this place is hipster or fancy, it certainly isn't.  The ingredients are high quality and the service is great, but it is still a low key take out burger joint (of the best kind).  So glad it is in my neighborhood!", "author": "Emily d."}

Beep's is an SF staple that many natives love and cherish. For burgers and fries made in a shack it is on the pricey side, but in its defense you can tell they're using fresh produce and bread and they use locally sourced meats. The 1/2 lb is two patties, which is quite heavy. So if you can't eat a ton definitely go with the 1/4 lb. It is hard to find good garlic fries, especially during AT&T's off-season. But Beep's is definitely the place to go if you have a craving for them. I did expect a little bit more from the nutella milkshake. It wasn't quite blended well and the hazelnut flavor was lost.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-23", "description": "Oh Beep's! What have you done?! Sadly this week is my last week of my weekly trips to Beep's. I should have written a positive review years ago as they really deserved it. As others have said, for a price less than a similar meal from McDonald's you use to get a good quality fast-food style burger and fries. I don't generally like steak fries, but Beep's was the only place I knew that made them delicious. Perfectly crisp and golden on the outside, yummy on the inside.\n\nThat Beep's is no more. I can't blame a business for wanting to \"evolve\" but they've priced me out. The new fries just aren't as good... more dry tasting and they don't come as a combo anymore. They just come separately and while that might not be such an issue the problem is they only have one size, huge. A 1/4 burger and an order of fries is now about $3 more than I use to pay AND way too much food. I can't justify paying more every week for additional food I don't have room for. I might start going again if they bring back combos or start selling several sizes of fries. But until then my weekly trips are over.\n\nSome positives. The new burgers are marginally better than the old ones... though a lot greasier. The new \"special sauce\" is tasty, though its pretty similar to the sauce that comes with an Outback Bloomin' Onion. The folks who work there are still really friendly and the owner's have done a lot making it not look like a rundown dive.\n\nI wish Beep best of luck with this new direction... perhaps they're hoping to bring in a wealthier clientele from the new condos being built across the street, but it looks like its happening at the expense of their old fans.", "author": "Andrew B."}

The quantity and quality at Beep's is definitely more worth it. The downside is that it takes a while (anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes) for your food to be made. But the long wait-time means freshly cooked food.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of steak-cut fries, but their fries here are so fresh and hot (I always burn my tongue eating them). They're a beautiful golden brown with crispy edges and hot soft centers. And if they're small and thin enough, they're very crunchy like a kettle-cooked potato chip. Their cheeseburgers are very simple, with a hot beef patty, melted cheese, iceberg lettuce (yuck), tomato slices, onions, and pickles. I can definitely get full off one of their burger value meals. I've also tried their chicken tenders basket, which comes with four pieces of chicken tenders, fries, and BBQ sauce. Overall, food is nothing too special but relatively cheap.\n\nAlthough their main attraction is burgers, Beep's also has fish & chips, shrimp & chips, chicken nuggets, philly cheesesteak, hot dogs, corn dogs, teriyaki bowls, and breakfast options. Most items range from about $4 to $6. And I have yet to try their pineapple shake!", "author": "Priscilla W."}

Their burgers weren't as rich as Super Duper's or Joe's Cable Car (RIP) but they were what I thought of as an old-school American hamburger, and for around $5 their value was hard to beat. In the past year their owner has changed and the place may seem a little different but give it a try and you'll see why Beep's is still reminiscent of the classic burger experience I remember. The burgers are still great and I don't mind the increase in prices to match the minimum wage or the Niman's ranch beef, and I love their pineapple or strawberry shakes!\n\nThe service is much friendlier than before and their menu is easier to read.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-23", "description": "One of my biggest complaints with the millennial generation is their constant need for instant gratification and after eating this rather mediocre-at-best meal that sentiment still remains.\n\nI'm a newbie to San Francisco and the Ingelside community and had happen to come across an article that Beeps was a rather well-known San Francisco establishment that was being taken over by some aspiring entrepreneurs who wanted to keep the old school spirit, but improve the menu. Now I have no idea how good the food was beforehand, but this afternoon's experience made me believe the owners don't understand that quality fast food is on the up and up. When you have franchises like In n Out, Shake Shack, Super Duper, etc then it's imperative for local businesses to either have a superior product or some \"original shtick\". This place had neither, instead it's \"original shtick\" was mediocrity. Here's why: \n\n1) I ordered a $5.25 chicken sandwich when I could've went across the street to McDonalds and got one for equal quality at $1. I was expecting chicken, not a frozen chicken-meat-product, but instead it tasted like a super-sized frozen chicken nugget sandwiched between two pieces of stale bread. Chicken isn't that expensive, even a Tyson frozen chicken breast slapped between two buns would have been a better effort than the embarrassment of a chicken sandwich that I got. \n\n2) My boyfriend ordered the shrimp and chips only to get skimped on the shrimp and to be bombarded with twice the amount of soggy fries. Supposedly the Richmond District has a similar place by the name of Buffalo Burger, which has superior shrimp and a nice 1:1 ratio of shrimp to fries. \n\nIn the end, my beef with the place is you walk away feeling gyped. It's as if a couple of college students went on a shopping trip to Costco and raided the frozen section and started a business hoping the legacy of the restaurant will carry them through. NO, it doesn't work like that. It's like listening to a paint by numbers pop song like \"Call Me Maybe\" or walking out of a recent Arnold Schwarzeneggar action flick. In a day and age where chefs are coming up with new ways to make the simplest meals out of fast food you'd expect a place like this to step up their game, especially after pitching locals of injecting \"new flavor\" to the business. Instead, it feels like a lousy millennial youtube video made with minimal effort, in hopes of getting a viral audience without any thought behind how the story was going to unfold.

Beeps was the neighborhood grease joint where one could expect an honest, no frills burger and a combo deal for under $8.\nSadly, it seems that new management has greedily seized on a course of modernization which has effectively destroyed the many qualities that were so loved by the locals. Firstly, it used to be cheap. No one ever went to a forgotten drive-up for the ambiance. Beep's serviced the needs of the community for an alternative to McDonalds. Now, the fries are sold separately and cost $2.75.\nSecondly, the menu used to be barely legible and was posted behind the counter. Now, it has been redesigned and placed in front of the window, grossly printed in a faux-hipster, Courier derivative. \nThirdly, they play loud, upbeat, top 20 music, which reminds one of a boba teashop. \nFinally, the place has been cleaned and repainted: the many years of grease and aging that gave Beeps an air of legitimacy has vanished. As I sat eating my 1/4 pounder (without fries), which was sandwiched by some sort of spongy bun that I'm sure the owners think classifies as 'artisanal', I reflected on the sad fact that this is no longer the Beeps that I had grown to love, but a trumped up imposter parroting the outrageously priced burger establishments which litter the city, providing only such weak defense as the ode to Neiman Ranch beef that takes up the center of their menu.\nHonestly, it's not even that good. So if you're going to pay an arm and a leg, you might was well go buy an actual $15 burger on Valencia somewhere.", "author": "Stephen D."}

No longer is there the simple goodness of a charbroiled burger made with frozen beef patties topped onto a sesamie seed bun (what is it now, buttered Brioch?). I never noticed if grilled onions was an additional charge but they charge you for that. And their steak fries are now anorexic and flavorless. \n\nThey give you too many options, what kind of cheese you want, and fries..they have the new regular, curly, and garlic. I'm thoroughly disappointed because the burger taste like most burger places and even though they use better meat, it's actually less flavorful and kinda dry. \n\nI don't know if the change is because of what San Francisco is becoming and if they're trying out the whole ..your food is raised locally and all natural, but Beep's has been the one place I would go to to get away from restaurants like that because they all taste the same and sometimes you just want an old fashion drive in burger...BEEPS! \n\nThey might as well change the name because the Beep's we all love and know is basically dead.

He slid the food across the counter, \"Here you go,\" all the while with a look of nuisance, as he addressed me.  No smile, no \"Thank You.\"  Since I wasn't raised by wolves, I said \"Thank You,\"  to the gentleman, to which he didn't even say you're welcome, or acknowledge receipt of this courtesy.  Rude.\n\nNow onto the food review.  I liked the spread they put on the burger.  The fries were fine for being Restaurant Depot fries.  The burger, I hated.  The double patties were burnt.  Not just a little burnt, which would actually give the meat a pleasant charcoal taste, but it was bitter and crispy burnt around the edge.

Not quite remembering the intersection on Ocean, Beep's sign stood out in its age and size. Luckily it served as a beacon to the parking lot. Ever since I bought a car out here, a little over a year ago, dedicated lots have become really big deals to me.\n\nI got the #11, double cheeseburger & fries, adding bacon. The occasional detailed description of the pineapple shake didn't look appetizing so I passed. With a $1 tip, I spent $8.18....a good deal though not the best I've had for a bacon cheeseburger in SF. The wait was only 10 minutes, and 5-10 was the promise. Had 9 people not ordered immediately after me, I might have received my order a minute or two sooner but it wasn't a big deal because all the food was still hot.\n\nThe burger and fries were both good. The patties were cooked to medium well or well, which is more than I want but perhaps for a volume shop and/or meat quality they want to avoid the hassle.

Beep's takes into consideration the budget of the starving students' from City College across the street. You want a drink? Pay the extra buck for it. I don't know of ANY restaurant (fast food or sit down) around SF that doesn't charge for a drink. Hell, McDonald's meal without a drink would still be cheaper than if you were to by the extra value with the drink. \n\nIt's fast. 10 minutes? Come on; it's a bit of a stretch. 5 minutes, yes, but 10? You must have been starving for what you perceived to be an eternity.\n\nIt's filling. I don't need to have a 5 course meal to fill me up. A veggie burger and fries goes a long way for me.\n\nIt's delicious. Condiments, salt and pepper work wonders, and everyone knows that's the key to good flavor. Without them, EVERYTHING would be bland.\n\nWhat more could you want? Seating? There's a park bench nearby. It's full? Well make a new friend. They'll make space for you. Perhaps you like the bar atmosphere. Find a stool or stand at the window. That's why it's there. To set your food. Perhaps it's a bit too cold for you. Eat in your car (for those who have one).

It always just looked so ghetto. The other day, I finally gave it a try. I figured it's a burger joint, go with the standard - a 1/4lb burger w/ cheese, fries, and the pineapple shake. \n\nI liked the pineapple shake. If you've ever had one of those large sheet sponge cakes with the fruit and whipped cream like frosting from a Chinese bakery, imagine that in a liquid form and that's what the pineapple shake tastes like. \n\nThe fries were fresh and hot when I got them. They are big thick fries, fried to that nice golden color, very crispy on the outside, almost like potato chips, and soft like mashed potatoes on the inside. I liked the color and textures, but I thought the flavor was just very potatoe-y...I mean which is understandable since they are potatoes, but I like more seasoning on my fries. Though some of the mustard from my burger got on the fries and that was quite tasty. \n\nI made the mistake of waiting until I got home to eat the burger, which was a 20 minute walk. So of course the burger was cold. But I still enjoyed it. The burger had a very nice charbroiled aroma and matching flavor to it. A good proportion of pickle, tomato, and onion to meat and bread. Not too much ketchup or mustard. I thought it was a decent burger overall. \n\nIt was good. Not great. Not bad. and being that it's so close to city and in my neighborhood, I'll probably go back again. The guy before me had ordered the fish sandwich and that sounded quite tasty.

Humble, spartan, and true to it's purpose?  Yes indeed.\n  \nA glance at Beep's menu reveals bargains aplenty.

I always look for an excuse to eat the tasty treat which is usually involves a thrice decade trip to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk. \nWell, there was a celebration of the batter wrapped psuedo-sausage-on-a-stick at StreetEat alright. The place was packed! There were more beards, ironic Ts and sundresses accessorized with toe-less boots (?) than I could count. Pabst Blue Ribbon in 16 ounce cans beat out the microbrews in mind-numbing numbers. The lines to get a teriyaki corn dog and bacon-wrapped delights were hundreds of devotees-long. \nDespite the discouragement at the crowd, my taste for a corn dog was not decreased. I did not want to wait in a huge line with the sun-scorched masses, but I did want the dog. The mister suggested a trip to the grocery for a frozen-type to make at home. No. That wouldn't do. He started suggesting alternatives: The Zoo? Carousel or whatever the last Doggie Diner became? He was trying to please his disappointed wife and I loved him for it. I started reassessing our home refrigerator contents in my mind for a sad replacement when he hit on the solution: Beeps! Did Beeps have corn dogs! Yes!, my genius mate, yes they do! We left South of Market with our quest in mind and made the trip to Ocean Avenue recounting our last visit to the iconic drive-in. It must have been 15 years prior. Luckily, Beep's still existed. My mouth was watering in anticipation.\nWhen we got there, I jumped out of car to queue in the short line. I scanned the menu --yes, corn dogs were still part of the fare. A woman in front of me asked what I was getting. Corn dogs, I beamed! \"Are you getting the kind on a stick or the mini-corn dogs bites?\", she asked. I was almost overcome with the choice. Not only could I get the more familiar, traditional vertical presentation, I could get baskets of 6 or 9 mini-dogs! I knew my selection, but I had to leave the line briefly to see if my mate would like a variation on the classic. I was slightly relieved to hear that he wanted the stick version and returned to order. I was told it would take 10 minutes; I had been waiting for a week for the sweet, hot crunch of the crispy batter followed by the pop of the spiced meat product, I could wait. \nWe did wait. I heard the story of the guy behind me in line of how he worked at Beeps when he was a teenager 20 or more years ago. I saw the surprise on the faces of the 20-something, dating couple on bar stools at the outdoor counter as they asked,  \"How long has this place been here?\" and watched the young family as their three daughters piped, \"We want french fries!\" \nThe short wait, was worth it. The sweetness to meat ratio was perfect. The fry was light and perfect. And they cost $2.49 each! My husband and I were reminded that Beeps is a great value and an institution. We'll be back for other diner dinners soon. And I've already set a calendar reminder for Corn Dog Day 2015 at Beeps.", "author": "Ruth W."}

I've gone here a couple of times for food before and I thought it was okay. I honestly rather deal with their lines rather than McDonalds (which are ALWAYS packed during lunch hours or when the kids get out school). It is at a convenient spot, seeing as how it's so close to CCSF, but what really makes me sad is that they don't have indoor seating. If anything, I always just get it to go because 1. they hardly even have any seats, 2. We all know how SF weather likes to change on us and I'm definitely not sitting outside in the rain while eating my burger.\nThe customer service has always been great though; they're really polite and the service is pretty fast. \nIf anything, it's a great place when you're on the go.

Only thing that bugged about the joint was the owner was shiesty on ketchup packets and asked for an extra quarter per packet.. so you might wanna pack a lil bottle of ur own in ur bag or somethin. So thats a 1 star deduction. Other than that, flavor of the burger was great, and I love the thick cut fries, just wish there was more ketchup!

Huge, super greasy, slathered in sauce on a bed of thick cut french fries, all of my aspirations of avoiding becoming a junk food vegetarian for convenience got thrown out the window today in the middle of a 5 hour language lab cram session. As a meat eater I'd probably give this place a 3 or a 4 but because of the lack of vegetarian food on campus (no, I don't want an avocado sandwich. I work at fucking Ike's Place.), the proximity of the best veggie burger experience in recent memory bumps Beep's up to 5. The fries are awesome, thick cut (probably frozen but who cares) and always come out well done with plenty of salt packets. PLUS ITS ALL 4 DOLLARS.

I tended to be super lazy between classes at school so unless I had more than an hour break I would stay on campus an get gross cafeteria food.  Whatever.  It was something to eat, even though it tasted like cardboard.  \nFinally one day I was on my way to McDonald's, (ewwww I know), when I really got way too lazy so I cut across the street to Beep's, since Beep's is all of a block closer to campus.  It was the best occasion of laziness I've ever had in my life.  I ordered a cheeseburger and fries, and though it took a while, the product was so so so good.  Surprisingly, I was expecting the food to be dripping in grease, but you know what?  It wasn't.  It was grilled to perfection and the fries were great! Thick cut, and crispy.

Also tried a rice plate. Can't really remember which one...pork with onions? Something like that. It's pretty good for a place that sells burgers and fries. It comes with a special dipping sauce that I personally really liked! But I've yet to try their famous pineapple milkshakes, but I will make it a point to, one day! ALSO, waaaay tastier (and cheaper) than anything you can get on the CCSF campus. No more paying for overpriced chicken bakes!", "author": "Bub B."}

Anyone looking for a good hearty burger from a legendary SF hotspot ought to stumble over to Beeps for a vintage old school feel.  Be sure to accompany your cheesburger with the city famed pineapple shake.  I haven't had a shake at a Burger joint that tasted this good since going to Foster's Freeze as a young buck.", "author": "Rex J."}

At about 5 bucks for a half pounder with cheese, Beep's is a real deal. Sure the place is ghetto, but you get what you pay for, but it goes with my saying that the more dirty something seems, the more tasty it will be (sort of like Pork's status amongst meats). Besides, I'm tired of gentrified foods, because at its heart, a hamburger isn't supposed to be made from the best beef. I think the only problem with the place is that they aren't super fast for fast food, or at least it doesn't seem to be.", "author": "Derek L."}
