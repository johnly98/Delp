There are several fillings to choose from and one order can have as many as 12 dumplings. These dumplings are still 100% authentic and better than anything from the frozen section of your grocery store. We received great service and the prices were completely reasonable.

We ordered Boiled Corn and Chicken Dumplings (12) ($8.95), Green Onion Pancake ($6.50), Grilled Skewered Lamb ($8.95), and Dandan Noodle ($9.95).  \n\nHits:\n- Green Onion Pancake: The pancake was very crispy on the outside and doughy in the inside. It seemed thicker than most green onion pancakes. There were not as many onion pieces as I thought there would be. Nevertheless, it was pretty good. \n\n- Dandan Noodle: These noodles tasted better than they looked. The dish was not salty and there was an adequate amount of meat. My friend would give this dish 5 stars. \n\nMisses:\n- Grilled Skewered Lamb: It was extremely dry, under seasoned, and a little cold. My friend thought it was a disappointment and warned the waitress about this.\n\n- Boiled Corn and Chicken Dumplings: Right when I took a bite, the corn pieces fell out. They were not mixed in well with the chicken. I think I would be better off buying chicken potstickers from Costco. \n\nIf you want to use your credit card, you have to spend at least $15. Only one credit card is accepted per table. \n\nSince we only liked 50% of the dishes we ordered, we will probably not come back.

Turn around, don't look back.\n\nMany of the positive reviews for this restaurant quote the lamb skewers and Shanghai soup dumplings. This is perplexing, as neither of these dishes are xian specialties. Which is fine -- good food of a region doesn't have to come from a restaurant of that region. But this was not good food.\n\nThe only reason to come here is if Chongqing Noodle and House of Nanjing next door have a 30 minute + wait and you have to sit down immediately or you will literally die.\n\nLamb skewers are supposed to be dry rubbed to extract moisture and then grilled over smoke to impart flavor and render the fat. These lamb skewers were cut so tiny that there was no possibility of juiciness, and were fried, not grilled - the laziest of possible preparations. The result is a greasy, salty, leftover-scraps-after-barbecuing style of lamb skewer that's tasty only by virtue of being seasoned fried meat. Why drive to SF Chinatown for that, though?\n\nThe dumplings are previously frozen, not fresh or made on premises. When you come from a Chinese family that cooks as often as mine does, the difference is immediate and obvious, from the dough to the shape, doneness, texture, and flavor of the filling.\n\nIt's not my intention to be a stickler for rules or a snobby gourmand, but this place is a parasite that continues to exist only by the grace of the overflowing success of the two restaurants next door (which are quality), and by being in Chinatown. Within a 200m radius of this restaurant, there are literally tens of restaurants where you can get a more authentic, better value, better flavor Chinese food fix.\n\nLeave. Turn around.

The beef scant and chewy, but the best feedback is for the noodles. The menu says that these are hand pulled noodles. The question I want to ask is - When were these pulled. A day ago? A week ago? And then they were left to sit out and dehydrate? Man I did not know that having dry, chewy, doughy noodles was now a thing. Bad that's all that I can say.\n\nI didn't learn my lesson. I thought maybe I should have got the dumplings as that's what their name says and that's what would be good. So I was back to get the Dumpling Noodle Soup ($9.95).

We heard about this place from others in the office and it's definitely a change of pace from our usual soup, sandwich, and salad fare.  Aside from their XLBs, they have a nice selection of boiled dumplings too from pork to chicken to even beef, fish and lamb.  I personally prefer their dumplings over their XLBs.  Not sure if they were steamed for too long but no soup in each bun + the skin was super doughy and tough, not the best combo.  \n\nIf you are not big on dumplings, they also have some pretty tasty hand pulled noodles.  They have some tough competition when it comes to Noodles a few doors down but not bad.  The 2 of us ordered a noodle soup, 1 dumpling, and 1 XLB and it was plenty of food w/ some leftovers.  \n\nThe restaurant is pretty small in itself and does fill up quick during lunch so definitely come early before the lunch crowd.  The lady server we had was very knowledgeable, explained some of the items on the menu and offered some recommendations.  However, the owner lady that came around later on was not as friendly.  She was rushing several tables to finish and the table next us was only half way done with their meal when she asked if they needed a box.  We saw a WTF look on their faces but quickly looked away as I'm sure it was awkward and uncomfortable for them.  Thank goodness my table was done and getting ready to pay but I'm sure it's not a great feeling to feel so rushed through lunch.", "author": "Janetto L."}

The hand pulled noodles are chewy and endless, just the way they should be - I like the regular kind more than the thick kind, but they're both delicious. Of course get the beef noodle soup. I also really like their Dan Dan Mien - the serving is huge! And of course, their dumplings (pork and cabbage is the real deal) are just steamed goodness. I have to say, the Yelp reviews judging this place solely by their soup dumplings should be ignored. You can't judge a place that serves Xian cuisine by their soup dumplings (xiao long bao) - leave that for the Shanghainese places. I think their xiao long bao is okay, but their normal steamed dumplings are where it's at.\n\nI'm perfectly okay with people going to House of Nanking next door instead because that means more dumplings and noodles for me!", "author": "Alyssa T."}

He enjoyed their dumplings and noodles, but, being a bit of a, tsk, tsk, dumpling snob, I never found the time to try it.\nRecently, another friend surprised me by inviting me here for a weekday lunch.  \nArriving around 1 pm, there were four or five occupied tables as we were seated on a wall side table.  My friend studied the menu and ordered the following, all shared:\n\n1) House special sizzling rice (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BtPr2KvZsYXutCwKVgBtYA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Do not advise ordering this unless you are a fan of the place a few doors over or just enjoy anything fried.\n\n2) Celery and shrimp dumpling (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W4F8BhJQCqb_VlZ5e7PqlQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Never heard of this combination but it works.  The celery flavor wasn't overwhelming and no fishiness from the shrimp.\n\n3) Xiao Lung Bao (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=I8o17MDcDsQiLu-TOeEE9Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Very good version as the skin was thin, yet held the integrity of the fillings well.  Good soup content, but definitely eat them while hot.\n\n4) Braised beef noodle soup (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Bn8ZSjOC6xITHdgetU7igA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Pretty good rendition as the broth flavor was clean and the meat pieces had a good mix of lean and tendon.  The noodles are on the wider side which lends me to believe that they are pulled in house.\n\n5) Sliced lotus root salad - Good change from the above with a pleasantly seasoned marinade while the lotus was shredded into easy to eat pieces.  My friend ate most of this while I mostly finished the noodle soup.\n\nService was efficient but pretty vanilla, empty plates removed and teapot checked from time to time.  The noise level is pretty good as we could have a decent conversation without having to raise our voices. \nBesides the above mentioned restaurant, there are a number of noodle places on Kearny Street now.

Inside is a different story. Tables are small and fill up fast, no bar.\n\nService: Ok. Expect to hear Mandarin first, but English is also spoken. My water did not get refilled automatically though.\n\nFood: This is my first xlb experience. It was good but I don't have much of a reference point. The SO said that good xlbs have thinner skins and more broth, but the flavor was good. We also ordered some Chinese broccoli and won tons, all decent accompaniments.\n\nHow to eat a xiao long bao (according to the SO): Place an xlb on your soup spoon. Add vinegar and/or dumpling sauce as desired. Take a pea sized bite on the side near the bottom of the dumpling. Slowly drink the soup from the dumpling, taking caution in case it's very hot. Eat the remaining dumpling by putting the soup spoon into your mouth. Use chopsticks to help hold the dumpling in place as needed during this process.", "author": "Sue V."}

That said, I will have you know that the food is better than several luxury dinning experiences I have enjoyed in the past with regard to Chinese cuisine.\n\nAt House of Xian, I had the Beef Noodle Soup with the complimentary green tea:)\n.... and the delicious soup dumplings. \n\nThe Beef Noodle soup is one of the best noodle soups I have had in SF. Now, needless to say I am a repeat offender when it comes down to the Chinese cuisine and I have had many noodle soups. From the picture you can see the vibrant colors and hopefully from this review you can take me seriously when I say the noodles are fresh and delicious. The dumplings are also equally equip with freshness which I am always pleased by as I operate on a strict NO STALE DUMPLING POLICY...\n\nAfter reading some of the reviews, I have to say I am flabbergasted how anyone could argue with the prices at this place. But this is just my humble opinion. I encourage you to try it for yourself.\n\nNom Nom Nom.", "author": "Kimberly N."}

That being said, my office is only a couple blocks over, so take-out is a great option for us. \n\nI hate that people say this is where you go when the House of Nanking is too full. Screw that, as a native San Franciscan, AND a Chinese person, I'll tell you that we do NOT go to House of Nanking. Tourists, fine. But us? No. XiAn is right next door, and has really great quality, and HOUSE MADE foods. You know why those dumplings and noodles aren't uniform? Its homemade. \n\nI've had a lot of their foods, but things that stood out:\n\nLamb dumplings - very lamby. Like gamey. So if you want that great lamb taste, do it. If you're not a fan of it, don't get it. Its pure lamb.\n\nPork dumplings - light, and very delicious.\n\nNoodle Soups (with dumplings) - also light and delicious. Great on a cold SF day. \n\nPotato appetizer - Surprisingly delicious. It comes out cold, so don't freak out. Its good though\n\nGreen Onion Pancake - I've had better...but this one wasn't bad at all. It gets you your fix. \n\nXiao Long Bao - First of all, never call it XLB's. No Chinese person would know wtf you're talking about. Call it soup dumplings if you can't say Xiao Long Bao. Theirs are pretty good. Though not as soupy as I'd like.\n\nThe service is pretty on point. For two people running the entire outside floor, it's not bad.", "author": "Lily W."}

As I was working long hours, this place was one of the few dinner restaurants open late and had great to-go options. Location wise, it is super close to Fidi and is also very affordable and fast. I would highly recommend stopping by here and ordering a large bowl of beef noodle soup or xiao long bao (soup dumplings). \n\n[Food]\nFor the price and the quantity, the food here is amazing. They have a great selection of homemade dumplings. Two of my favorite things to eat in this world is beef noodle soup and xiao long baos, two items that are all-stars here. The beef noodle soup is a large portion and made with handmade thick noodles. The beef is also very fresh and the soup is very tasty. The xiao long baos have a great amount of soup in them and is very fresh as well. I've also tried the green onion pancakes and pan-fried buns, and both have been great as well. I definitely need to expand my options when I eat here again, but I have an undying love for beef noodle soup.\n\n[Decor]\nIt's a little hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. For its price point and convenience, there's nothing super special here. \n\n[Service]\nIt seems to be a family run restaurant and I've personally become friends with the lady that runs the store. She's very friendly and I speak Chinese to her. While sometimes you need to flag down the servers to ask for anything, it is your usual Chinese restaurant. The service is very fast and the food comes out very quickly.\n\nI highly recommend giving this place a try.

The only reason anyone would write a negative review about this place would be because they don't want to share it. These guys deserve success.\n\nYeah, I was worried when I saw it was right next to House of Nanking. And there is a better-decorated restaurant with a picture menu nearby with a lot of Sichuan items on it which almost threw me off my mission. But that place was packed and the menu looked kind of small.\n\nWe got there about 2pm on a Saturday and there was plenty of room. We were astonished by the menu, which had all kinds of interesting stuff on it as well as a lot of the traditional favorites. It was hard to decide\n\nHere's the rundown (for three very hungry people):\n\nSpicy Beef Tendon appetizer: my compatriot noted that this was superior to where we used to go. I'd have to agree and admit that I'm a sucker for the heavier, saltier sauce.\n\nCucumber Salad with Peanuts: I nearly fell over when my compatriot ordered this. I mean, there was Tofu Sticks Salad With Cilantro and all kinds of fried stuff there. I was expecting sliced cucumbers, Thai-style, perhaps even accompanied with peanut sauce. Instead there was a lovely stack of cucumber toothpicks dressed in a delicate invisible sauce, and a piles naked peanuts. Fresh and delicious. Heaven, honestly.\n\nHouse Braised Pork Knuckle: It took me a while to figure out this was pig foot. Once that was established I was perfectly comfortable with the way it giggled. Deeply seasoned with star anise, this is the best pig food dish you'll ever have for less than ten bucks.\n\nShanghai Soup Dumplings: served thoughtfully with three porcelain soup spoons, a no-nonsense version of the classic. Of all the dumplings we had, these had the thinnest skins.\n\nBoiled Radish Beef Dumplings: This was by far the most unique thing we ordered and the standout. I'm not sure what the colored radish they're using is, but it's delicious and completely accessible. Stop whining about the thickness of the skins. They're not going to slow you down.\n\nChives Fish Dumpling: I love chive dumplings but they always have shrimp in them, so I was thrilled to see this. I was not disappointed. Fresh and light!\n\nRed Bean Paste Pancake: a delicate pop-tart cut in 6 pieces, served perfectly hot, crispy, and not at all oily.\n\nBoiled Black Sesame Mochi: six little white mochi eggs filled with sweetened black sesame, served in a glass bowl with little metal spoons. A mind-blowing finish to the meal.", "author": "Seth G."}

I thought you would only add the mandatory service charge when you have a party of 6 or more.

On my last trip in, the power was out, and the server seating us told us that service was slow because the power outage had slowed down the kitchen and made them cash only.

Service:\n\nThe service at the restaurant was quick, polite, and efficient. When you ask for something, they do not forget, and get you that something right away. They always have someone looking out, in case a customer needs service. The food comes out quick, and there's not awkward wait between ordering and eating.\n\n2. Food\n\nThe Xiao Long Bao here are one of my favourite dishes the the restaurant. For about $8.95, you get about 8 of them, which isn't a bad price. Have them with the red vinegar, and it'll be so bless. \n\nThe also have a beef noodle soup with hot chilli peppers. It's really good too, especially if you like a little kick in your food. The size of the bowl is pretty decent with the thick type of noodle. Personally, I would say it is as filling as a big mac with a side of small fries at McDonald's, just for perspective. \n\nFinally, if you're looking for the drink, the soy milk is good at this place. I personally like it cold but you can also get it hot. They have the sweet version (which is what most people are familiar with) but they also have the savoury version of the drink. It's quite unique and really a hit or miss with a lot of people. However, if you have not tried it before, you should try it here! They do it quite well!! \n\n3. Wait for seats\n\nThis place isn't as packed as their neighbours but I find that this place is a bit better for the quality to price ratio. It's a small shack but rarely has a wait, so if you're looking for something quick. this is your place.\n\nOverall Comments:\n\nAll in all, great place with friendly servers. I highly recommend this place if you are in town.\n\nNotes: \nThey only accept VISA if the bill is over $15. Else, you'll need to pay with cash.", "author": "Kenny C."}

Unfortunately when we arrived, there was a gas problem so the owners emphasized there would be delays. We were so tired that we didn't want to go search for another place that was open and stayed, opting for the longer wait. The waitresses were very apologetic and polite, so there's a star for that. \n\nThe food, however, was very lacking. Because it's known as a dumpling house, I got veggie dumpling noodle soup, hoping I could get a good combo of both dishes. However, both noodle soup and dumplings were extraordinarily plain and bland. I'm not sure whether the food quality would have improved if their stoves were fully functional, but from my experience with the soup noodle dumplings, I definitely do not recommend that. It's something I could have made myself at home in 10 minutes. I suggest saving your money and go elsewhere instead of paying for overpriced Chinese food.", "author": "Kelly L."}

I ate about 4 pieces and only 2 had soup? So I guess that's a 50% rate actually biting into a delicious dumpling and another 50% of a mediocre below average dumpling. Because the soup IS what MAKES this dumpling.\n\n-Spicy beef hand-pulled noodle: The noodles are not hand \"pulled\" but they are indeed hand made. I can tell because I sat right in front of the chef. The noodles were good and they are 100% hand made! Not even machines were used for mixing the dough. But this had to be my favorite dish. The broth was good and the meat was tender. Portion wasn't lacking and I would definitely recommend this\n\n- Pork dumplings: We wanted pork and chives dumpling but they ran out. So we settled for these. These weren't amazing or anything just okay lol.. \n\nService: \nNot attentive. I feel like they are... understaffed. The buslady was constantly rushing around and sometimes tables were left and not cleaned for a long time.

We also ordered the shanghai panfried pork bun, and let me tell you, the skin was not too thick and had a great crunch. The pork was nicely seasoned as well. Next we had the hand pulled beef noodle soup. The soup tasted great, msg free and made from hours of stewing beef bones. The hand pulled noodles were also nice, not too soft and they had a good chewiness to it. There's also two sizes of these noodles: thick or thin. The pork and chive dumplings were piping hot and pretty good, don't let them cool down before you finish it otherwise your taste buds will be mad at you! The skin is a little more thick than I would've liked, but at least they don't tear on you when you pick it up!\nThe waitress is also super funny and nice. The seating is a bit cramped but it is Chinatown!\n\nOverall, the food is great and flavorful, the price is decent, and the staff is friendly. I would definitely come back again because their xiao long baos are BOMB.", "author": "Eva C."}

I'm pretty familiar with Chinese service, and I had my expectations set quite low. However, this restaurant was beyond saving...I'm being generous with two stars, because they had a guy making hand-pulled noodles live on the spot, which was pretty neat. It's not too often you get to see that first-hand. \n\nWhen I walked in on a weekday lunch hour, the place was actually pretty packed. There were no tables available, except next to a woman who was sitting and waiting for her takeout order. That was fine by me. I learned that she had already been waiting ten minutes or so for her takeout. She didn't receive her food until a good ten minutes later, after I placed my order. That's pretty ridiculous for just getting takeout chinese if you ask me. there was nothing really complex about cooking this food -- most of it was steamed or fried. I ended up waiting about 20 minutes for my food as well. I can't believe they've been open for months and they still don't have their cooking line in order. \n\nAll I ordered was dumpling noodle soup...how could it have taken 20 minutes to make? Anyway the broth was completely flavorless. It just tasted like water, which it probably was. At least I have the comfort of knowing they didn't add MSG. However, as a restaurant, I'd expect them to take the taste of their food more seriously than that. The dumplings tasted pretty good though, and I'd imagine the spicy soup would have gone well with, and pan-fried dumplings wouldn't have been bad either. Just don't order the plain soup (it's just water)! \n\nJust keep in mind that they take their own sweet time cooking the food during rush hour, so don't come here if you're in a rush.", "author": "Audrey L."}

Me and my sister both ordered their beef noodle soup, a plate of green onion pancakes (they were out of the five spice pancake which we wanted to try), a plate of their pan fried shanghai dumplings, and a plate of steamed buns.\n\nIt was pretty packed on a monday at 1pm, probably because its still lunch time. But we were lucky to get a seat. We saw the people who also ordered a noodle soup got their food pretty fast. We got our green onion pancake, steamed buns and pan fried shanghai dumplings in a timely manner.\n\nThe green onion pancakes: it was pretty dry and bland. Would not recommend! \n\nThe steamed buns: its was ok, nothing special. I was probably stupid to ordered that when theres a lot of steamed buns in chinatown for cheaper. \n\nThe pan fried shanghai dumplings: this disappointed me the most. There was no soup in it! It was so dry. I ordered this the last time I came here and it was good (there was soup inside). \n\nO wait! My review for the beef noodle soup? I cant rate it because we never received it. We were close to finishing our other dishes. And we noticed new customers who came in after us got their beef noodle soup, finished eating it AND paid their bill and left already. We just decided to pay our bill and leave because we thought maybe they forgot about it and we dont want to wait anymore. We didnt finished our other stuff so we asked for boxes. \n\nWhen we got our bill, they sure DID NOT forget to charge us for the 2 beef noodle soup. So i told them we never received it (so we're not paying for that). The lady who looks like shes in charge apologized, took the bill back and told the kitchen to make our noodle soup. I was surprised that they thought we still want the noodles after we already boxed our leftovers and was looking like we're ready to leave. So i told them we dont want it anymore. They apologized and gave us our adjusted bill.\n\nI noticed a 10 cents charge for a bag which i didnt ask for. I didnt want to make a big deal for 10 cents so I just sucked it in and paid. But the nerve, wow. The total was 15 something which I didnt think was worth it. I still left them $1 tip because at least they apologized.

Remembering a dumpling feast I was served in Xian, China, this seemed a good idea as any.\n\nThe owner/ manager was very friendly and speaks perfect English. This is a hole in the wall, very casual, the prices are cheap and they do take credit cards, if I recall correctly. \n\nThe shrimp and chive dumplings were just okay. While they were fresh, the wrappers were too thick for my liking and the chives overpowering. \n\nBe sure to order some of the scallion pancakes. The dough is basically wheat flour and water, lightly seasoned, sprinkled with chopped scallions, brushed with sesame oil, rolled out flat, folded over, brushed again and so forth. The result is somewhere between phyllo and pizza dough, deep dried. Delicious. \n\nThe vegetable fried rice is a huge portion and enough to feed a family of four. It was very flavorful and difficult to stop eating it. I wish they had a brown rice version.\n\nThe red bean filled pancake is a simple and yummy dessert.

Young moms and bearded dudes pine for farm FRESH anything - eggs, veggies, shampoo. Shoeheads will never stop amassing FRESH kicks. Coffee shops are always on the lookout for FRESH wallpaper prints.\n\nHowever, all this focus needs to be redirected immediately to House of Xian Dumpling's FRESH NOODLES.\n\nThe Beef Noodle Soup that houses these pliable strands is spice bombed with potent flavor. The high profile chili invasion exercises restraint in providing the broth with a gradual warm buildup and refrains from being overly salty. The square-cut pieces of beef that usually portend a jaw workout are instead wonderfully tender - not quite at a melting point but still delightfully delicate. The medium-width noodles are noticeably springy, characteristic not only of its freshness but of the chef's pursuit of al dente. After bite upon vibrant bite over the course of half an hour, these hardy noodles do not lose any vitality and ensure quality to the last slurp.\n\nThe Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings are less revolutionary but still admirable for its effort. The juicy interior is sealed with flavor and piping hot, but the expected outer crispiness is simply absent. Whether due to temperatures that are not high enough or oil oversaturation, the wings fall short of complete satisfaction.\n\nThe service is extremely pleasant and unusually attentive for a Chinese restaurant, much less one in busy Chinatown. Note that there is a $15 minimum for credit cards.", "author": "Andrew M."}

I find a majority of the dishes bland, overly salty, and one-dimensional. However, the two dishes I absolutely love are Xiao Long Bao and Beef Noodle Soup (with the thick, chewy noodles). Despite living near Chinatown, I hadn't been able to find any restaurant serving a decent portion of these two items (this is probably due to a fact that a majority of the restaurants are owned by Cantonese speaking immigrants from Southern Chinese provinces). Until now with the opening of House of Xian Dumpling!\n\nThe restaurant itself is small and a bit cramped, but cleaner than a majority of other Chinatown eateries, and better yet, the staff is friendly and accommodating to non-Chinese speakers (tourists, this means you!). The space is further occupied by a small stall with a staff member hand pulling noodles for the dishes in front of you. \n\nFood-wise, the Xiao Long Baos are not soupy enough in my opinion, but since I have a pretty high standard for XLBs (Joe's... I miss you), this wasn't surprising. \n\nI've had the Braised Beef Noodle Soup and Braised Tendon Noodle Soup, both good, filling, and SPICY. My favorite dish however, is the Pork Knuckle Noodle Soup with the hand-pulled flat noodle. I love Pork Knuckle and I was delighted to find a place east of Inner Richmond that actually serves a good amount of it! The noodles are the right amount of chewiness and the broth is deliciously rich. Best of all, a bowl will only set you back $6.95!\n\nIf you're coming alone, bring cash because there is a credit card minimum of $10.", "author": "Sophia V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-10", "description": "LONG VERSION (Skip to SHORT VERSION below if you're impatient):  \n\nI have been having the day from hell, or, more appropriately, the week from hell.  (Props to Richard Lewis.)  Today at noon, I needed a walk, and my partner in cryme had a conference call.  I have had a hankering for Chinese as of late, so I decided to walk approximately nine blocks to get take-out from House of Nanking. By the way, I had ripped a huge hole in the back of my pantyhose that I did not notice until about 3:00 p.m. this afternoon.  FYI, a big ass hole in the back of your pantyhose does not work well with a 1940's navy blue floral dress and brown cowboy boots. \"Crackwhore\" never works with vintage. \n\nAfter a 10-15 minute walk, I get in a rather long line that has formed outside of the door.  I pull out a book I've been engrossed in and start reading while I wait.  I'm standing behind four young republicans.  Ugh.  Ten minutes passed.  Now, granted, I could probably have walked into the restaurant and told the server I wanted take-out, but to be perfectly honest, I was in no hurry to get back to the office.  The server finally comes outside after about 15 minutes and asks the cabinet of young republicans how many are in their party.  Then she asks me how many are in my party, and I tell her I want take-out.  The republicans have turned around to face me now.  I'm starting to feel uncomfortable with all eyez on me.  She walks out of the front door, stands next to me, and asks me what I want.  In my most matter-of-fact tone, I tell her I would like sesame chicken with steamed rice and steamed pork dumplings.  I bet that would have been the bomb.  Ugh. Here's where things really devolve.   \n\nShe's like, \"We don't have that, you have to go next door.\"  I'm confused, so I ask her if she's sure they don't have that.  Naturally, I had checked the menu online beforehand so I would know what I want.  The republicans are staring at me as though I just told the server I had leprosy.  She hands me a menu with the same look my mom gives me when I tell her who I'm dating.  At this point, I'm extremely uncomfortable, and I'm also glad I wore clinical strength deodorant.  For a brief moment, I thought, what if I just broke into a really fast jog and ran out of here like Lola (or \"Forrest Gump-ed\" my way out of it, as my sister called it).  This method has worked successfully for me in the past, when I've accidentally set off the fire alarm in a certain bar that will remain nameless.\n\nAnyway,  I hurriedly order pork dumplings, and a side of rice with spicy chicken over it.  Here's the worst part: at that point, it still did not occur to me that I was not at House of Nanking.  Ugh.  There I was, just standing there with my teeth in my mouth, like a prize asshole.  \n\nFinally, when the server handed me my order, I began to realize I was at the wrong place.  Don't ask me why, but I started to think about her comment that I should go next door.  Then, with the reaction I should have had about 15 minutes earlier, I looked at the place next door.  Ignorance is bliss, isn't it?  While she ran my ATM card, I felt that lovely burn of sheer embarrassment coarse through my veins.  Ugh.  She came back with the credit card slip.  I left a tip that I hoped would make me feel better about what I had just done, and she told me that I was \"very generous.\"  UGH.  I'm on a self-imposed timeout.   \n\nSHORT VERSION:\n\nWell, the pork dumplings were pretty decent, although the color of the meat was a bit too pink for my taste. They were pretty standard, overall, but not remarkable.  The chicken was okay too, for a place that does not make chicken over rice as a general rule.  It was a huge portion.  \n\nAnd the humble pie was delicious.", "author": "Sunny S."}

What I like about this place in SF is that unlike some other Chinese restaurants in town, I know for certain that this place is clean, that certain dishes' elements, like the pig knuckle soup (amazing, clean flavor, with marrow pieces!) is thoroughly cleaned. Again, I'm partial because my aunt (not blood relative) runs the place. Not only has she put her heart and soul into this, but she also has an extensive background in hospitality management. How many restaurant owners can claim that? And no, she has no idea I'm writing this. Tehe.\n\nThe cooking here is not flashy. The flavors are meant to evoke homecooking, and if you notice, their soups are neither oily nor over-salted.\n\nTry the flat-looking red bean pastry dessert! It's their own creation and it's yummy. Oh and the lamb skewers!!!! Omg, so tender. Oh and they also make their soy bean milk fresh and in house. Not sure if that's always on the menu....", "author": "Eda C."}

If not, it's still worth the wait.", "author": "Gary B."}

The quality and authenticity of wonton dumplings they prepare daily and on the hour was appreciated, and delicious! I had the pleasure of being sat down in front of the small station where a chef prepares and rolls, fresh wonton dumplings. It was to my surprise that I would even have the luxury of watching this action as I waited for my food. I ordered the boiled cabbage and pork dumpling soup, it was delicious and simple. Soup was fresh and very authentic to the Chinese culture/cuisine. Also, price was super cheap!! Only paid 6 bucks for a big ol' bowl of soup, generous portion size. The service was decent, I really can't complain, I had a nice server. Just an FYI, the restaurant is tiny, perfect for a meal for one or a small group, I wouldn't recommend bringing a big party as space is very limited.", "author": "Mariel C."}

The first night we went, we had a really pleasant experience and I would give it a 4 or 5 out of 5. The lady in charge (30s/40s young with long hair) was multi-tasking and running around, but was friendly and attentive. She was nice and answered any questions we had.\n\nThe food: Soup dumplings, house special fried rice, beef noodle soup. \nSoup dumplings - were good, but couldn't beat Bob's in Chinatown, New York.\nHouse special fried rice - pretty good for fried rice. The meat they put was well marinated and wasn't overrun with sauce. \nBeef noodle soup - the best thing we ordered. This beat my favorite beef noodle soup in Maryland by far. This was so good that I'm pretty sure it's ruined beef noodle soups anywhere else that I'm used to going in my local area. \n\nThe second time we went, it was a different lady running the show. Slightly older looking with short hair. She was rude. She saw us enter and ignored us for a minute and then told us to pick any seat. She was gone for awhile when we were ready to order and we tried to get her attention, but she just waved back to us and decided to chat with her co-worker. When she did get back to us a few minutes later, she was just rude. After we got our food, she didn't come back to check on us and we even had to wave our hands to get her attention so we could pay the bill and get out. The restaurant wasn't overly busy, maybe 1 or 2 other tables had customers. We ordered similar things but swapped the soup dumplings for grilled chicken skewers only to receive chicken skewers that were clearly fried. The fried rice didn't seem as great as the first night and I had to wonder if it was a different chef. Anyway, this second experience was a 2 out 5 for me.", "author": "Allie O."}

I ordered 1 beef noodle soup and 1 order of pork dumpling and nothing more. A few minutes later She brought a plate of peanut/sliced cucumber that I thought was complimentary because this is usually at alot of other Asian restaurants so I didn't think anything of it. She then brought out the noodle soup and dumplings which was decent and she looked at my cucumber dish and mumbled something is Chinese to herself as she walked away. After I was done she brought over the check and it showed that I got charged $5.95 for the little peanut/cucumber dish that I did not order or want. I went up to the counter and told her and she said it's not complimentary so I told her I didn't order this or wanted it and she told me you ate it so you have to pay for it. I'm standing here thinking I am getting scammed. I told her that's not right for you to bring me a dish I didn't order and say nothing about it and expect me to pay but she kept on refusing take responsibility for her mistake. She finally said I will knock off $3 half of the dish price and I was like no I shouldn't pay for your mistake and again she refused so I was like screw it I'm not spending any more time arguing with her about her mistake and I paid for the bill. If I was in her shoes no questioned asked I would not charge you for my mistake. Right after I paid she gave me my receipt and told me tip was not included and I was thinking in my head really? are you kidding me? Of course I know that. I shouldn't even tip you for the bad service you gave me but I'm a reasonable guy so I left her $2 for a $20 bill. Usually I could care less about bad service just as long as you serve me good food and charge me the correct amount but in this case I felt forced to pay for something I didn't order..

So I had to wait a few weeks to cool down before writing a more objective review.\n\nWho am I kidding? It was still gross and reviews are subjective. I had the dumpling noodle soup, which was really good... until the very end when I spooned up the broth and a roach the size of my fingernail floated up (hidden under the noodles). I couldn't speak, so I flagged a waitress and pointed. The family next to me saw it, too, and although they looked alarmed, continued eating their noodles. The waitress quickly whisked the bowl away. I was not looking for another bowl or a free meal. At the end, she explained to me that since I ate all the noodles, they couldn't give me another bowl, but next time I come in, she'd give me extra noodles. She also said it would've been okay if I had eaten the roach because it was \"good protein.\" She then tried to tell me it must've crawled in the back where they keep the bowls of noodles, because there were no roaches in the pot of soup (keep in mind, I was not saying very much or initiating conversation because I was still in a state of shock from seeing the ROACH in my soup). She then gave me my check for the entire meal. I paid, left, but the more I thought about it, the more upset I got about how the situation was handled. I wished I took a picture of the roach to post before she took my bowl away. I don't think I'll be coming back for \"extra noodles.\" Oh well. What's done is done. I finished the noodles. I did not eat the roach. But it was there, hidden, the whole time WHILE I was eating.\n\nSo, although the food smelled and tasted good, rich flavors, and authentic, I cannot overlook the way this situation was handled or the cleanliness of the restaurant (since it did not seem to phase my neighboring table, it must not be unexpected). I also wonder how \"fresh\" the noodles are if the bowls are sitting in the back for a roach to crawl in. I thought hand pulled noodles were made to order, so there wouldn't be a chance for the roach to crawl in. And if it did, I wonder if they would even make a new bowl, since it's \"good protein.\" If anything, the waitress might've said too much.\n\nI do love hole in the wall restaurants, and I've eaten at some shady street corners, so the waitress was right: it's just protein, and I'll live. But when you are an established, professional hole in a wall, in the USA, you should address roach issues. I don't think I'll be coming back, but if I do, I'll be sure to stir up my food carefully before eating. I recommend you do the same.", "author": "Teresa P."}

I arrived during the lunch hour and waited about 30 minutes. The wait should've been shorter because as I saw customers leave, none of the tables were being cleaned up to allow for new customers to be seated. What was shocking was that they had a table that they allowed this one customer to sit there while she waited for her to-go order! That table could've and should've been used for dine-in customers!\n\nWhen we were seated, we ordered immediately. Here's where I knew there was something utterly wrong with this place. We ordered the XLB (the first item on their menu). The waitress said they don't have them. What?! The number one thing you have on your menu...the item that your restaurant is named for...and you don't have them!? Ok, we ordered the chive and pork boiled dumplings. Waitress says they don't have chives. WTF! How can you not have these basic menu items?! We ended up trying the beef noodle soup, pot stickers, and cabbage/pork dumplings. \n\nWhat I didn't understand was that there were 4 tables that needed to be cleaned, and there was a line of customers outside. No one was cleaning that tables! There were 8 workers (between servers and cooks) and only 12 tables! \n\n20 minutes later, we got our noodle soup. Not bad. Not the best, but ok. 20 minutes later we got our boiled dumplings. They came out hot, and again, not bad. By now, I'm wondering where those potstickers were. The waitress came by and asked if everything came yet. Did she really forget that she ordered potstickers for us? We had only ordered 3 things, for heavens sake.  By then, I realized that (1) they were going to start cooking our potstickers now (40 minutes into our lunch), or (2) we were going to get the most overcooked, cold potstickers ever. Well, we got our potstickers hot. They had just cooked it. We asked for our bill now, anticipating that it may take another 20 minutes to get our bill. But our lunch wasn't done just yet. As we started to eat the potstickers, we received a \"hairy\" surprise on the plate. We flagged the waitress and told her to take it off our bill and don't worry about giving us another order. What was quite comical was that she took it off our bill and came back and was about to give us seven dollars and change. We were confused because we didn't even pay yet and she was giving us money?!!!!  We should've just took the money and went.\n\nAnyways, I had to try the place out and I know never to come back.

Although not gourmet, a lot of their dishes feature noodles that are hand pulled by an employee that's sitting behind a glass wall for people to watch. Their noodle dishes are okay, although I prefer their soup noodles to the greasier chow mein. I would recommend going with their buns and dumplings as they were a little more authentic in my opinion. The dumplings come in several different filling choices, but all have a great texture to the dough. Though the dumplings are small, the ratio of filling to dough is just right. I also loved their pan-fried pork buns, which get a nice grilled char on the bottoms, but have that same juicy pork in the middle. Other dishes like the green onion pancake and fried rice were a little too oily for my taste, but all in all the meal was satisfying.", "author": "Ashley T."}

I got 2 orders for my colleague and I. I took it back to my office. They give you 2 containers to separate the beef from the noodles. I was about to pour the soup into the noodle container but it was so hot so I decided to put some of the noodles into the soup container instead. So I add some noodles to the soup a little at a time but as im eating I am noticing the noodles had brownish flecks in them. I was thinking it was just like that from the broth. But then I look in the noodle container and instead of the noodles being all white, I see that they are flecked even before I put it into the soup. The noodles are very sticky without the broth so I start pulling it apart and inspecting it closer. I see that there are indeed brownish green spots and I realize, its MOLD. My colleague's was the same. In hers we found an even bigger piece of mold, about half the size of a dime. I also bought some boiled dumplings and that was fine, but needless to say I am never going back. I can't help thinking that if I was eating at the restaurant, I never would have been able to tell that there was mold in the noodles as it would already be mixed in with the soup.", "author": "David L."}

The response of one of the waitresses was simply \"if it's not coming out of the kitchen yet, there's nothing I can do about it.\" She seemed too scared to even go into the kitchen to check on my order. I ended up canceling my order for the two items, as I had to return to work. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the waitress decided to comp us the 1 item (fried rice) at the end, after my cousin gave her an angry look of disapproval while paying.
