But almost every single time I've been in the neighborhood I've ended up at Gold Cane. Doesn't hurt when the former are packed and there is always space at Gold Cane.\n\nAnd it was only on this most recent trip did I learn they had a patio. Ugh...\n\nGold Cane is an affordable dive bar that offers some simple cocktails around $5, decent beer around $4, but the ambiance is where it is at. Filled with a friendly if eclectic mix of regulars and the occasional tourist group. Coincidentally I've usually taken friends out of town to here. With a solid bar, and a secondary room for sitting, pool, or pinball, it does offer a lot of space for groups or just finding a bar to sit at. Doesn't hurt they have some TVs to play some games. Even the bathroom situation is nice.\n\nBut on this most recent trip, the sliding doors to what I just thought was a backroom were open. Some extra space, some kegs, and a cool little bookshelf with books and even some VHS tapes. And then I saw it...\n\nGold Cane has a two level back patio. On the first level is a large, round table and a single bathroom. There was a jamband playing some music when we saw it. There are some stairs to the second level which has more tables or space to rest drinks. There is also a HUGE covered area behind this second level, but due to zoning or some kind of laws they can't actually have people go there. \n\nI'm a big fan of the Gold Cane, and looking forward to drinking more on the patio now that I know about it.", "author": "Michael C."}

There is a window directly next to the toilet that was frosted, but you can kind of tell if people are outside.

If you're anticipating anything farther up the classiness ladder, keep looking.\n\nDespite living in the Haight for 2+ years, I'd never even considered venturing foot across the threshold of what appears to be a very dark den of sketchiness. It's one of those spots on Haight St that I find myself actually stepping off the sidewalk to get farther away from as I walk by. I didn't ever even bother to glance at the name. So now you may be wondering, this sounds horrible and yet you rated it 4 stars?!\n\nLast Saturday night, the boyfriend was browsing Yelp for a drink spot in the neighborhood. We just weren't in the mood for our usual haunts - The Alembic or Zam Zam. He noticed that there was a bar on Haight with a shocking 4-star rating that we'd never heard of. When I looked at the location, I knew it was one of those totally sketch-from-the-outside-pass-quckly-by spots (along with Trax). But I mean, I'm willing to try almost anything once. So over the Gold Cane we strolled. \n\nHighlights\n- $4 draft beer (Blue Moon, Anchor Steam, etc)\n- $3 draft beer (Coors, Bud, etc)\n- $6 well drinks (Soco + Coke....it was a weird urge, don't ask)\n- vintage jukebox - and some great classic rock tunes were playing that night\n- friendly white-haired bartender who quite probably has been tending Gold Cane bar for nigh on 40 years\n\nThis is the type of bar where you'll find a contingent of neighborhood regulars taking shots of Jack, a few pool players, a lone ranger or two, and a table of random chicks who accidentally wandered in from the Marina. It's an interesting mix. Add to that the family portraits circa 1975 hanging behind the bar along with a \"No Smoking\" sign in Chinese, and honestly I'm sold.

Pretty awesome, if I do say so myself. \n\nIn terms of beer, it's ok. Nothing super amazing, but considering most of the dives in my neighborhood in Philly only serve the main domestics and pony bottles of Rolling Rock, I was more than content with Lagunitas and Fat Tire on draft.

It's a great Tuesday afternoon place.

The atmosphere and people were pretty chill, not too mellow but also not too crazy. The music was great, and the jukebox had a superb selection: from classics (Etta James, Nina Simone) to eclectic (Talking Heads) to a few modern things (Black Keys, Built to Spill). Three songs for a buck... Yes!\n\nOnly minor downside was that my friend didn't dig her Long Island Iced Tea ($8). It was tasty to me though! \n\nThe friends and I will definitely come back.
