For a restaurant in the Tenderloin, it's a got a thumbs up if you want to be in a restaurant and forget that you're in one of the worst neighborhoods in San Francisco.\n\nAll of the dishes are vegetarian, with some vegan alternatives as well. I ordered the Pumpkin Curry, Pad See-Ew and Spicy Fried Rice. Prices of the dishes ranged from $10~$13. Food came out quick and was a great presentation. Service was good as well.\n\nMy only complaint here is that I wished the food was warmer and spicier. The food seemed to come out a little over room temperature, wish it was straight from the stove. I'll definitely be asking for spicy next time, though there was plenty of sauces that were placed on the table as well.\n\nApparently the owner (Pop) is the son of Thai immigrants who opened other successful Thai restaurants in the Bay.

No one was humping a tree or shaking their booty while standing in the middle of the road this time. Welcome to San Francisco, :P. \n\nIf you can ignore all the sketchy (and potentially sketchy) people, you should probably try this place.

My friend ordered Roasted Duck Curry ($11.50) with Jasmine Rice ($2.75). \n\nBoth the Pad Kee Mow and Roasted Duck Curry were delicious and very flavorful. The veggie meats actually tasted slightly different from each other. \n\nThe Pad Kee Mow had a strong bamboo taste. The vegetables were slightly raw but were still seasoned. \n\nThe Roasted Duck Curry was sweet and not too spicy. \n\nThe amount of rice my friend received was pretty huge.

Times Square has changed yet the TL still has a gritty edge to it along w/ being a great place to visit if you are a vegan.\n\nThere is Golden Era, Thai Idea Vegetarian, L & G for a tofu Banh Mi, & the energy of Millennium's legacy in the neighborhood. In fact it was countless visits to Golden Era over the last few months that have kept me from visiting Thai Idea sooner yet am glad I made the visit. \n\nThai is always a good idea & is especially a good idea if you dine at an all vegetarian restaurant called Thai Idea Vegetarian. It is in fact an ovo-vegetarian restaurant that is vegan except for serving eggs & dishes can easily be made vegan be omitting the egg on selected dishes.\n\nThe website link to Thai Idea on Yelp was down so the prices listed on Yelp were in fact higher than prices actually are here. Besides that rice isn't an additional charge as rice comes w/ all the dishes except if you have brown rice there is a minimal charge of around .50 cents which is very reasonable.\n\nMany of the dishes offer choice of protein as either: \nveggie chicken\nveggie beef\ntofu\nveggie shrimp\nveggie lamb\n\nAs is the case w/ dining at a vegan or vegetarian restaurant there is too much choice. I decided to go w/ the Green Curry as my server recommended it.\n\nThe Green Curry came w/ bell pepper, bamboo shoots, eggplant, string bean, baby corn, & basil. I opted to get it w/ veggie chicken.

Typical Thai fare with a few Japanese and Indian dishes in a very non typical manor...100% plant-based! Whether you're a veg-head or not, this place is definitely worthy of a try! Their use of plant proteins is so imaginative! Surely to impress anyone. \n\nAll dishes are vegetarian with the option to make them vegan (ex. minus egg on pad Thai). Just ask! \n\nI started with some Thai lychee iced tea which was light, refreshing and delightful. For our party of three (with leftovers) we then ordered...\n\nTom Yum Soup: \nI must admit I consider myself somewhat of a Tom Yum snob as I eat a ton of it. The bowl here was up there with some of the best I've EVER had. Perfect flavor. Perfect broth. Perfect amount of spice and basil, and it definitely contained the most veggies I've had in Tom Yum, that's for sure. \n\nPanang curry with \"shrimp\" and avocado:\nThe \"shrimp\" blew me away. I've had my fair share of faux meats but this \"shrimp\" was not only of the same consistency, but the same shape and taste also! I'm so fascinated and highly impressed by this use of strictly plant based proteins! I also loved the addition of creamy avocado! \n\n\"Shrimp\" Pad Thai:\nWe opted to go ahead and add that delicious \"shrimp\" to their pad Thai which was perfectly peanut-y, but not overpowering. Noodles cooked just right and topped with fresh shredded carrots as well as the bean sprouts. Great kiddo option and big enough to split between two littles. \n\nService was topnotch \nStreet parking was easy \nAtmosphere was welcoming and clean. \nFood came out remarkably quick and was presented beautifully. \nPrices were reasonable. \n\nI honestly have no reason not to give this place a flawless rating and as much as I do not like to repeat restaurants when I travel, I will certainly hit this one up again.

I had first thought that the spots in front of the restaurant were available to park but after a period of time one of the servers informed me that the car spot was not available, wasn't quite sure who could park there but I appreciated the heads up vs getting some nasty ticket which in SF is going to be steep.  The staff also warned me not to park around the corner because she said there are people hanging out and they will break into your car.  Again thanks for the heads up.  I ended up parking a couple blocks away and removed everything from my car and it worked out ok.  \n\nSo once you get the parking situation figured out the place is very modern and inviting and surprisingly not crowded or noisy.  The staff  are super friendly and helpful letting you know about the different dishes.  Was very happy with their suggestions.  We got the larb salad to start and it was incredibly good.  I have never seen a veggie version of this anywhere and wow they did a great job.  it was ground tofu with greens and lettuce and shaved beets and herbs with a super big kick of chili peppers.  Totally recommend this dish.  It almost can also be used as your side of rice as it really went well with the other dishes.  We also got the yum woon sen salad which is basically a glass noodle salad with veggie shrimp and chicken.  Again most places do not have a veggie version of this dish and it's light and delicious.   \n\nFor main courses again everything looked great but I decided on the jungle curry which seemed to have a lot of veggies and it was a lighter dish not having any coconut milk.  The dish looked great and filled with fresh veggies and it went great with the rice.  I'm not much of an eggplant fan but it was really good in this dish.  \n\nOne warning is the spice levels here are some of the spiciest I have had for a Thai restaurant.  I asked for Thai hot so just be prepared that if will get what you ask for. On top of that they will bring you all kinds of condiments to add even more heat.  I was pretty much asking for extra napkins.  \n\nPrices are very reasonable considering how fresh everything tasted.  They will also give you to-go boxes if you want to take anything home.\nIf I lived in the City I'd be here a lot because there is so much on the menu to try and it's tastes pretty darn authentic to my American taste buds.  5 stars for sure.", "author": "Ron K."}

The whole meal was so tasty and fulfilling, and you can tell everything is of quality. However though. I HIGHLY recommend that you order the cat fish.

We had the firecracker sushi appetizer, crispy duck with tamarind and green curry with tofu. The food itself was decent - but I didn't really find any of it to be memorable. The duck was a strange texture (not very much crispiness to it, I was expecting a bit more) and the curry needed more coconut cream and spiciness to make it more flavorful and filling. The vegetables were undercooked and the curry was watery, at best.

What an odd time, right?  Wrong.  Completely and utterly wrong.\n\nI found parking on Turk about an hour early and should have put my name down then, but I didn't.  I read in my car and then headed over at 1:45... only to find that there were 20 other parties ranging from 2 to 4 people ahead.  Dang.\n\nSo I opened up Yelp and just searched for restaurants nearby, restaurants that weren't going to be closed at 3/4 to set-up before dinner service.  And that, my fellow Yelpers, is how I ended up at Thai Idea Vegetarian, just one block up from Brenda's on Polk Street.  \n\nThe restaurant was empty save for a group of three toward the back.  I chose a table set up for four at the front near the window which, in retrospect, was not the best spot.  (Saturday was just not. my. day.)  As our late lunch wore on, my poor friend ended up being completely in the sun.  Our server, Nan, was such a sweetheart, though, and offered to help us move our dishes over to another table.  \n\nSpeaking of dishes, we went with the following:\n\ntom yum soup w/ vegetables - 10.25\nthai fried rice w/ \"chicken\" - 11.25\npanang curry w/ vegetables and fried tofu - 11.25\n\nGiven where this story began one might imagine how easy it would be to be completely let down by every vegan bite when you had Brenda's as your original target.  Nevertheless, my friend and I enjoyed all three dishes even though if I were to come here again, I'd forgo any sort of meat substitute and just stick with vegetables and tofu.  The chicken in the Thai fried rice didn't look at all like chicken and while it tasted just fine, the visual piece messed with me.  \n\nI hadn't seen this particular friend in a while so I was grateful for the more peaceful atmosphere at Thai Idea.

Thankfully, we got there just before they stopped serving. I had the Thai Iced Tea which was made with soy milk. I could tell it wasn't real milk but it still tasted great! We got the Pad Thai and Cashew Nut stir fry. By mistake, she brought us Pad See Ew at first but had already realized her mistake so gave us the dish for free! That was really nice and we ended up loving the Pad See Ew, as well. Everything tasted amazing and even though I'm non-vegetarian, I honestly didn't even miss meat. Great flavors and value since you get several meals out of each dish. I highly recommend this place whether you're veg or non-veg!", "author": "Pooja C."}

The waiters were rushing us. The lady took my plate away when I was in mid bite. I couldn't believe it. The presentation of the food was horrible. It was like night and day! She spilled the water all over the table, we didn't get silverware, the bill came out before my food. I was so disappointed, this was suppose to be such an amazing day for us, yet I talked about how disgusted I was the whole time we were there. The desert they brought out was unacceptable.

We also shared a pot of tea. I only wish there was a larger menu because I love having options but I still can't complain. I also wasn't a huge fan of the tofu in my husbands dish - maybe it was because it was fried or seemed to be sitting (she initially handed him a plate of broccoli and when he asked for tofu she came back out with it one minute later).

It came in within 15 minutes, which is quite impressive\n\nNot good. Bad. Very bad: the food!!! I ordered fresh rice paper rolls. These are perhaps 2 rolls cut in 4 pieces, presented as 8. The rice papers are quite thick. Never had them these thick. The idea of rice paper rolls is for the filler ingredients to sing. All I tasted was the thick skinned rice paper. Thank goodness I asked for extra peanut sauce. It helped mask the flavor of the dish. \nI also ordered pad Thai. My go to main dish at Thai restaurant. It's hard to go wrong with it.  It's a safe choice. Well, not here. I added 'fake chicken'. Well, it tasted and smelled gross. I took a bite and set it aside and decided not to eat it. I decided to stick with the noodles. Well, there were not many. As the dish was overpowered with bean sprouts and raw carrot 'noodles'. And I believe they did not salt it. The dish was inedible for me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-10", "description": "I feel like I need to preface this review by mentioning that I'm not from San Francisco and was visiting from NYC for several days this month.  I had no frame of reference for vegan Asian food and the only thing guiding me to Thai Idea was a quick search on Google, with sporadic WiFi while wandering around another neighborhood, for \"vegan food\".  i was able to see very good ratings and stars and all sorts of things that led to me saying, \"OKAY, GPS, TAKE ME THERE.\"  And so I went.\n\nI'm not one of these New Yorkers who thinks everything in \"my\" city is the best.  Indeed, I'm often willing to concede that, yeah, a restaurant in Indianapolis is so damned good and should find its way to the Upper West Side because I'd be there all the time.  That's how I feel about Thai Idea.  As soon as I walked in and was seated immediately by a very nice young woman, I felt at home and knew -- or at least hoped -- that the whole experience would be worth the trek.\n\nAnd oh, it was.  This is a very casual place, and everyone already there seemed to be having a good time, eating their food happily, and even though I was alone, I felt like I would soon be joining their ranks and didn't feel out of place at all.  No one pointed at me and said, \"Oh my god, she's not from around here and has never seen this menu before.  LOL.\"\n\nThe only problem with this place is that there are so many options on the menu and I wanted all of them.  Literally.  And I mean *that* literally.  I was in a noodle mood(le), though, so I chose the Pad Kee Mao with tofu (and veggies).  For the life of me I can't remember if I ordered an appetizer.  How is that even possible that I don't remember, especially knowing that 99.4% of the time I order an appetizer?\n\nI don't like small food.  This portion did not disappoint.  It was the perfect size and wonderfully seasoned, the ideal degree of spiciness.  My mouth was singing a cute little song and I may have hummed very softly to myself as I took the first few bites, and thought, \"Can I sit here all day and just order another entree every half hour?\"\n\nThe service was brisk and efficient yet friendly without being annoyingly attentive.  I felt welcome and like a \"native\" here.  The entire time I was eating, I was thinking how much I wish this place existed in NYC and that no doubt I'd be a regular and thus have the opportunity to try every single item on the menu.\n\nWhen I visit San Francisco again, I'll definitely be back, will make sure to order an appetizer, remember what it was, try another entree, and order another one \"to go\", while knowing that I'll be finding somewhere to sit about ten minutes after leaving the restaurant and eating it with my fingers if I forget to pack a traveling fork.", "author": "Jodi V."}

I've never been a huge experimenter with thai food as I can't stand when there is coconut in anything - like many of the thai curries. However, I was excited that this place was pure vegetarian. And oh man, their imitation meats were fabulous. I was so impressed.\n\nI asked for a recommendation, and the very sweet server offered the Pad Kee Mow. It was pretty spicy - which she warned about. I am usually fine with that, it was just a bit shocking the first few bites. Haha. I got the imitation chicken inside it. It was a little darker \"meat\" than I would have expected, but the texture and taste was fabulous. We also got the roti. It didn't come with any kind of sauce, which was odd. But we used my boyfriend's yellow curry. That went together great. My boyfriend also got a soy thai iced tea. It was different for him, but we both really liked it.\n\nI was really impressed with this spot overall. We were waited on attentively. There were only some small downsides, like the specials drink menu looking really crumpled and raggedy. Nothing too notable - it was pretty good!", "author": "Melanie P."}

The vegetarian idea was not bad, I got all the eggplant and tofu I could eat. What I found interesting was an event that happened: We sat at table 2 next to the window. A homeless lady walked in, walked up to table 1, said \"Excuse me I'm really hungry\" and took a handful of food from table 1, and left. In the next second the waitress walked over and offered to bring a new plate of food out. All this took less than 10 seconds! I was a bit surprised by the audacity of what the destitude will do (But I'm not really), but really amazed at how well the staff handled the situation. It easily could have been me and my table (give I was 4 feet away). So I give Thai Idea Vegetarian 5 stars for the class. Oh the food was good too. Good Thai food, and good Thai Iced Tea.\n\nThe location is located on Eddy Street, in the middle of a not-so-upscale area. Parking is non-existent here. You'll have to find a lot. My hotel was across the street so I was lucky enough to just walk here. The restaurant is a bit small so there was a wait to get the table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-10-24", "description": "Storage solutions. \nLet's talk about 'em. \n\nOk, maybe not you and I but certainly this business who is next level using its bathroom as a junk drawer for random supplies and some cleaning products that I'm honestly a little skeptical even get used... or at least never get used in the disaster of a bathroom that is also swarming with flies, has duct tape over the otherwise open drainage hole in the floor, and is just not anything you want to see from a place you're about to eat in. It was cute when Carrie Bradshaw used her oven as a shoe rack... restaurants storing their high chairs next to the sh*tter is not. \n\nI'm truly astonished with the nearly 5-star review here until my dining partner and I took note of the completely empty dining room, less the people who came in to pick up carry-out items. I think maybe you'll enjoy the food here more if you never set foot in the bathroom... which on top of all the problems noted above also has a massive full sized garbage can in there that was overflowing with trash... at 4pm on a Sunday when there were ZERO customers in the place. I'm 100% certain the bathroom is never cleaned to any sort of ethical food-service establishment standard and 20% certain there was a single spider leg in my order of 'Volcano Beef'. \n\nSpeaking of the Volcano Beef... I realize the place is vegan but the 'beef' was the worst veggie beef I've ever had. Veggie beef at Asian restaurants is pretty much my favorite thing ever since I stopped eating meat a decade-ish ago and this was by far the worst I've encountered. Maybe if they called it chicken I'd have been more forgiving but straight up it was flavorless beige protein chips that they dumped on top of a random salad mix that just got in the way of the only thing that might have had flavor: the thimble of sauce underneath all the garnish. \n\nWhat really bummed me out was that this was supposed to be a spicy dish noted for its \"smocked\" chili sauce. At first I'd assumed they'd just spelled 'smoked' incorrectly but when the dish came it was just the boring protein, lots of garnish, possible spider leg, thimble of sauce and then on the side they brought out the little community container of Sambal Oelek (but likely off brand or out of date since it wasn't as flavorful) and I'm like... what.the.hell? Did I order this dish deconstructed or something? Why are they serving the only thing that the dish was named for like an afterthought?\n\nService was fine but like, I've never gone to eat somewhere and been so close to walking out after seeing the state of their bathroom. For real, when I walked in the toilet seat was up so I lowered it with my foot and upwards of 4 flies came out of resting. And when we got the check there was a plastic spoon with a smiley face drawn on it in permanent marker attached to the pen and the spoon was full of dust, lint, and dirt and I had to wonder how many complimentary dust bunnies I'd possibly consumed on other plate-ware thanks to Thai Idea. \n\nAnd I know I sound like a real jerk off here but like... I'm a mess, too. I get it. But when people come over to my place I have enough sense and shame to try and spot check with some bleach and wet wipes and shove obvious traces of my hoarding into closets and then pretend like I'm in the middle of purging stuff to bring to goodwill and I definitely don't hand them dust-collecting dirty spoons with smiley faces drawn on them and there's just a level of filth so flagrantly present here that its beyond even my very low health & cleanliness standards which anyone who knows me can tell you that's really something. \n\nThe nicest thing I can say is that I stole a piece of baby corn out of my roommate's dish and it was pretty darn good but if you're gonna get food here I highly advise you order for pick-up or delivery with blissful ignorance of the state of their standards of cleanliness.", "author": "Candice G."}

One of my favorite things to do while traveling is to try at least one new vegetarian/vegan place in the area since I'm trying to cut back on my meat consumption. I was visiting a friend in Daly City, and we decided to have dinner here since they had a large vegan/vegetarian selection. \n\nWe ordered the crispy chicken over fried rice and panang curry with tofu as well as samosas to share. All three dishes were amazing! The samosas came first. They had excellent texture, crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. It was a great appetizer to start us off. I've tried a lot of mock meats in my day and the \"chicken\" they use In the crispy chicken over fried rice almost had me thinking I was actually eating real chicken. The fried rice in the dish was really flavorful and paired well with the chicken. The panang curry was my favorite dish of the night. All the spices blended perfectly with each other and the mix of tofu and vegetables tasted even better smothered in the curry sauce. Come to think of it, anything would have tasted good smothered in that sauce. My friend, who was skeptical of vegan food, couldn't stop raving about how great it all was. \n\nOn top of the unforgettable and healthy food, the service was courteous and welcoming.

Once I added jalape\u00f1o vinegar and hot sauce, the acidity balanced out the sweet and it was much better.\n\nNext, we ordered two mains to share. The spicy string beans with shrimp and pad basil with beef. The string beans was the better of the two dishes, but felt pretty neutral about it. The beef in the pad basil was white, which seemed a bit confusing to both of us (did they really give us \"chicken\"? But the waiter insisted it was \"beef\") The pad basil was bland, the beef was boring, and the sauce at the bottom needed way more flavor. \n\nJust an FYI, the textures of the meat were nothing like real meat (if you're looking for that sort of thing).

The interior is well decorated with a spacious ceiling and the servers are very friendly.\n\nUpon the first look at the menu, you'd think that this was a regular Thai restaurant, all of their dishes use regular Thai dish names with meat names in the title \"Volcanic Beef\" \"Spicy Catfish\" \"Lamb Curry\", but then the description says vegetarian beef, vegetarian catfish, and vegetarian lamb; which makes you wonder what is vegetarian beef? or catfish?\n\nWell it turns out the dishes are basically regular Thai dishes but with substituted meats.  The dishes were actually very flavorful and all had a good presentation.\n\nWINGS BOMB - looks like you're eating a roasted chicken drum but tastes like you're eating ground chicken wrapped in a tofu skin. Not bad...\n\nPUMPKIN CURRY with BEEF - just like what you'd expect in pumpkin curry, pumpkin, great curry sauce, slightly spicy and then some beef which tastes a little like the \"chicken\" meat  from the Wings Bomb dish.\n\nSPICY CATFISH - this dish was actually quite surprising.  The \"catfish\" is a deep fried meat substitute, not bad, served alongside a ton of other stir fried vegetables (carrots, onion, etc) then garnished with whole black peppers (which were still green and still on the stalk) and a lemon leaf?\n\nThe prices ranged from roughly $13 per dish which isn't bad for what you're getting.\n\nThai Idea is a nice sit down restaurant, good tastes, presentation, and service, a place you wouldn't mind taking your date to.\n\nI probably won't be craving Thai vegetarian food anytime soon again, but I have to give this place kudos for doing what they do very well.", "author": "Mike L."}

We had a reservation for 6:15; and showed up ON THE DOT at 6:15. They were not prepared for our party of 10 and asked if we minded being seated separately. We did mind, since we were celebrating my friend's birthday, so we said no. They kept telling us the tables would be ready in 10-15 minutes, which wasn't true. They eventually sat 4 of us down (which was okay, since our remaining friends were finding parking), because they said the people next to us were just about finished. Unfortunately for us, and by no fault of the party next to us, they were taking quite a while to finish their food (the party on our right side seemed like they had just arrived and finished before they did). The host moved us to the other side of the restaurant before realizing the area they had given us was too cramped for 10 people and moved us back to the initial place they had allocated (once the other 2 parties left). When we complained, she simply stated \"it's Saturday night and busy. It's first come first serve.\" Except almost every restaurant in the city is busy on a Saturday night. Mind you, by the time we finally got our table/party together, it was about 7/7:10. \n\nWe shared our meal family style. We got the Panang curry with veggies and with tofu, and we got the Pad Thai, and the Pad Kee Mow. We all also got Thai Iced Teas, which tasted pretty good to me (I go to a lot of Thai restaurants and get Thai Iced Teas); but it didn't sit well with my friend. Everyone else was fine. \n\nThe restaurant did make up for it because we did bring a cake to surprise my friend and they turned off the lights.

Well at Thai Idea, not only do I leave full and satisfied, I sometimes even have a to go box to boot. \n\nReally loving the veggie Tom Kha soup here. It's a wonderful balance of flavors with plenty of aromatics from the lemongrass and galangal, the tartness from the lime juice, and the richness from the coconut milk. It's hard to beat on a chilly SF evening. The golden cauliflower appetizer goes really well with the soup too. Deep fried cauliflower florets with the tamarind dipping sauce mirrors the flavors from the soup well. \n\nThe entrees are pretty filling and satisfying. The pineapple fried rice balances sweet and savory well and the veggie \"shrimp\" comes one of the closest in terms of texture to real shrimp that I've had. Like the deep flavors in the \"beef\" Pad Ped and the chili green bean dishes... even more so when you consider they don't have access to fish sauce to create that same intense salt factor. And lastly... the crispy chicken fried rice. I like fried chicken and while this definitely doesn't look like fried chicken, it has its own charm. It kinda reminds me of a less salty version of crispy fried spam which to me is incredibly yum! All in all, so happy with the food I've had here. \n\nThe service is amazing sweet and attentive and the restaurant is always clean and comfortable.

It's everything from the interesting space to the friendly service to the well-presented and tasty food. \n\nOur most recent dinner here was 2 years since the previous visit. Thai Idea never strayed far from my mind when I thought about dinner in SF, so I had plenty of time to build up expectations. The dishes were as artfully presented as ever, looking like they really should have come from a far \"nicer\" restaurant. The service was attentive and friendly. Walking by the kitchen, I saw it mostly seemed like one family cooking and running the place. They were really cheery and I think the positivity shows in the food. With vegetarian places I often relax my standards, acknowledging it's hard to replicate the raw biological satisfaction of meat. Thai Idea needs no such leeway, as it can stand up to any competition. \n\nWould recommend the following:\nVolcanic beef: incredibly flavorful type of spicy, great texture to the \"beef' and nice presentation\nBangkok duck: sweet, savory, and crispy. nice sauce with it\nPumpkin curry: always loved pumpkin curry, and Thai idea had one of the best around\nFirecracker balls: fun appetizer, as with everything here, it's not hard to forget the tuna isn't real meat\nPad thai: noodles were oddly sticky so it was hard to serve, but filled with smoky vegetables \n\nAs has been repeated in numerous reviews, Thai Idea is byob with a liquor store next door carrying great beers and wine. This makes the place as good for a pre-gaming dinner as a romantic night or even solo dining. \n\n\nI would eat here everyday if I could. Being full time vegetarian would be laughably easy if I lived within range of Thai Idea.", "author": "Erik L."}

My friend and I came for dinner and were seated right away--the decor was very modern, and it looks like they might have recently renovated. We started off with the papaya salad (som tum) which was fresh and delicious; could perhaps have used a bit more spice in my opinion, but they also provided us a little caddy of sriracha/sambal/pickled jalapenos, so no complaints there! We also got the pad kee mow (stir-fried rice noodles) with tofu, which was decent, and the spicy vegetarian \"catfish\", which was absolutely amazing! The chunks of meat substitute weren't necessarily convincing, but the stir-fry was one of the most fragrant I've had, containing peppercorns, basil, and a variety of other chiles and herbs--so enticing and delightful!

The ambiance inside the restaurant is nice though it doesn't look like much from the outside.

However, the portions are small and as a result, the dishes are pricey. The taste of the food is inconsistent. Sometimes they nail it and other times you end up wondering if they gave you the wrong item. I generally tend to enjoy the Papaya Salad, Spicy Fried Rice, Pad-See-Ew, and Pad Khee Mao.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-05", "description": "This place is the bomb dot com. If you're veggie and are new to the world of Asian food courtesy of growing up in Riverside County, CA where good Asian restaurants that pander to Vegetarians are anomalies, welcome to heaven. \n\nI've tried my share of Thai places in my last 6 years in the Bay. The first time I had Thai was in the unpolitically correct \"Asian Ghetto\" area near the Berkeley campus. I come from a very strict vegetarian family so I was alarmed when I saw that all food, veggie or not, was cooked in the same wok. Add to this that my friend's order was a beef somethingortheother and my order came out 2 seconds after hers and I was sick to my stomach. For propriety's sake, I took a bite of my order, did not understand the flavors and was completely grossed out at what juices may have mixed in with my food. I threw that $6 dish out. Fast forward to two years later where my tolerance was increased courtesy of my increasing inability/laziness to cook at home. Here I had more Thai food. In India. And I grew to like it. A lot. \n\nComing back to Berkeley, I discovered a multitude of great spots including Imm, Sabuy Sabuy II and yes, Tuk Tuk Thai (they are open obscenely late). With a promise from my servers to avoid cross contamination and a determined avoidance of looking at the kitchen and all meat dishes, I discovered nothing but more love for Thai. \n\nThis sets the scene for my discovery of Thai Idea. My parents are still VERY strict about where they eat. They avoid Asian restaurants that serve meat like the plague which makes having them taste Thai food damn near impossible. This place changed the game. Not only are the servers angels from heaven who smile, greet you and explain dishes, they also do a fantastic job of alleviating desi parents' fear of meat. My mum must have said \"no fish sauce\" 5 times and the lady did not snap once. \n\nThe food is beautifully presented, with seasonal orchids that my mum like to take off the food to put in her hair. The food is also very tasty. All the dishes, especially the curries are fresh and flavorful. There is also a delectable offering of mango sticky rice with the thinnest filets of mango I have ever laid my eyes on. Lychee tea is amazing. All things are good here. Except for the \"samosas/sambusas\". The potato is sweet. If you're gujarati/like sweet savory food you may enjoy. If you're me, avoid. Thai tea is great as well. \n\nThey are SO good at doing birthdays. When I told them it was my bro's birthday, they literally brought out the cutest fritters with ice cream and a candle, TURNED OFF THE LIGHTS in the entire restaurant (freaking me out slightly TBH/reminding me of power outages in India) and came to our table singing Happy Birthday. I was so thrilled I wish it had been my birthday (yes, I like birthdays a lot). \n\nSo that's that- show your patronage. Support the hell out of this place. They are that good.", "author": "Radhika P."}

Because he should have taken me here sooner!! Darn it!! This place rocks!!\n\nFrom the outside, it looks like a dump. The construction fixtures outside doesn't help the d\u00e9cor. Once you walk in, it's transformed to a beautiful place. The waitresses were not the friendliest bunch but very attentive. They quickly sat us at a 4 table seat, which was a plus since we love sitting next to each other. \n\nWhile looking at the menu...I wanted EVERYTHING!! Darn places that give you so much options. I think my tummy was controlling my eyes for sure!!\n\nWe ended up ordering the following...\n\nDRINKS - THAI ICE TEA $2.50...it's your basic thai ice tea. Not too sweet, but great to have if you suddenly take a bite of something spicy.\n\nAPPETIZER - WING BOMB $7.95...which is \"the bomb\" a must order. Great sauce and flavor.\n\nMAIN DISHES - EGGPLANT BEEF $9.50...I loved this dish. The eggplant was perfectly cooked, not mushy. Not too spicy and the best part...the next day my honey had it for lunch and he said it was even better because it marinated in the sauce over night.\n\nGREEN CURRY BEEF $9.50...I love sweet and mildly spicy dishes. This was a perfect combination. My honey didn't care for it as much, since he's not a fan of sweet curry. It's ok, more for me!! Hehe\n\nKEE MAO CHICKEN $9.95...if you have a weak stomach for spicy food then don't order this. It was super spicy. Even my honey's taste bud kinda went numb after eating this. He finished the entire dish since I couldn't eat it and was only able to sample the other two. \n\nI'm glad we were able to finally come here. I'm a total fan and can't wait to go back again. The prices are reasonable and the presentation of the food makes you feel like you're at an upscale restaurant.\n\nStreet parking is available, but not easy to find. You can walk from BART to get here (that's what we did). It's a bit of a walk...so be prepared ladies with heels.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-04", "description": "Since Jamie W. and I embarked on a plant-based way of eating a couple of months ago, believe it or not, we've been trying out places around the city that we wouldn't have dared try before. Vegetarian fare was anathema to us when a slab of pork would please us to no end. Alas, while I haven't completely gotten over my love of the pig or frankly any edible creature that had a mother, Thai Idea definitely goes a significant way to fill the gap by serving vegetarian dishes you just wouldn't expect to be so tasty. Deep in the 'Loin as it is, it has a surprisingly calming ambiance that's jarred periodically by the cacophony of mouthy veg-head diners who obviously don't know how loud they are.\n\nThe menu is deceptively similar to any standard Thai restaurant with chef's special plates that feature \"veggie meat\". Now I usually run away from meat replacements like this, but I have to admit that the $11.95 Bangkok \"Duck\" was almost as good and savory as the real thing. Because it was crispy-fried and glazed liberally with tamarind, the flavor and texture of the faux-duck confit really delighted me, and the shallots and chili complemented it nicely (see photo). Jamie went for the $9.95 Pad Thai, which really didn't miss the flavor of meat given the pan-fried rice noodles, sprouts, ground peanuts, egg and tofu cubes that were served in an abundance (see photo).\n\nI've always said you can tell how good a Southeast Asian restaurant is by the quality of its spring rolls, and the $7.95 Fresh Salad Rolls were a good litmus test. They were delicious creations with bean sprouts, lettuce, carrots, mint, glass noodles, and cilantro piled into a thick roll of rice paper flecked with sesame seeds and served with a luscious peanut sauce (see photo). I would definitely order those again in a heartbeat. It's good to know you really don't have to sacrifice flavor when going vegetarian in this town, and Thai Idea is a solid place to get a meat-free fix that doesn't taste like it was ground from bales of wheat.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...first-class vegetarian fare for meat lovers in need of a forks-over-knives alternative\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...sleek and modern with a high chance of loud vegans in the room\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...quietly effective\nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely give it a try, you health nut!", "author": "Ed U."}

Before even stepping foot into Thai Idea I already knew it was a 5 star place for me even if they served up steaming turds on a plate I would probably give it 4 stars minimum. It combines my two of my three favorite loves, vegan & Thai food! After my first visit did Thai Idea live up to my expectations? Oh hell yeah!\n\nSince it was Sunday, parking was relatively easy to find. Only took one trip around the block. Upon entering we were greeted by two pretty hostesses. They seated us and were helpful with our questions about the menu. My glass of water always stayed full throughout the meal. You could tell by watching the servers with the other tables, customer service is job one around here. The setting of this place reminds me of a fancy lounge that is a direct contrast from the gritty streets just outside the door. Even the bathroom is nice looking here.\n\nWith so much to choose from I think we went a lil buckwild on the menu. We ordered the Thai Samosas, Roti, Tom Kah Soup, & the Volcanic Beef. Of course every Yelp review mentioned the Wing Bomb so we had to order that too. Everthing was so beautifully presented, which is a rarity for veg places not named Millennium. I was salivating just browsing the photos here on Yelp. \n\nThe samosas were excellent! Not a traditional Indian samosa but it was probably my favorite part of the meal. At first I was disappointed that there wasn't a dipping sauce other than what was on the plate. One bite and it turned out it wasn't necessary. This is coming from a self-proclaimed condiment whore. I even ate the edible flower! The wing bomb is in fact da bomb! The sauce perfectly matched the chickenish flavor of the wings. The crispy basil went perfectly with these wings that I damn near licked the serving tray clean!\n\nI will admit the Tom Kha wasn't the best. Way too many onions and not enough spice to overpower the coconut milk. Should've went with the Tom Yum instead here. The Volcanic Beef more than made up for it. The spicy smoked chili sauce melded perfectly with the peppers and \"beef\". If you like spicy food be sure to specify in advance. Normal heat is good but I can always use a little more kick. \n\nMy only small gripe about this place was they charge extra for soy in the Thai iced tea. With almost everything being vegan why not just make it all vegan since they're already getting rave reviews from vegans, omnivores, and Carniwhores alike?\n\nUp until recently the best place to get fake meat dishes were run by the Supreme Master's disciples. Now not only can you get this at Thai Idea, you also get excellent service and presentation that most veg places lack. In fact with them allowing BYOB wine without charging a corkage fee, I will be celebrating all my special occasions here from now on. No need to shell out extra cash at Millennium when Thai Idea is so exquisite!\n\nAfter a *short* wait, my babygirl is a fan: http://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-idea-vegetarian-san-francisco-2?hrid=ReSzY37EMvu3O3yXhyWK5g", "author": "John B."}

On the BART, we decided to get off at the Civic Center station, or whatever it is, and I found this place on Yelp. I wanted something spicy. We're wandering around en route to the restaurant and the area is just a total dump. People were cat-calling my wife. Drug deals were taking place on the street. This is stuff you don't see in Chicago unless you really go out of your way to be in a bad area.\n\nWe get to the place and it's situated next to a massage store. Gross. However, inside, it's wonderfully decorated and people are quietly enjoying their dinners and talking. This place is meat free, so I ordered the pumpkin or squash curry. She asked me how spicy. I said that I wanted spicy. We also got some sodas. I was shocked how expensive one can of soda was. Yikes.\n\nThe curry was good, but not as spicy as she promised.

Today's trip was no different. On my way to Thai Idea, I was solicited for money by a woman...on her cell phone, cat called by a toothless man, got mistaken for a tranny (geez, I didn't even have my full-on whore lashes on today) and nearly fed my Uggs into a pile of poop dung not once but five times! But, it was SO worth it...\n\nEver since opening its door in October 2011, I've been dying to try Thai Idea but being the loser at work I had no one to go with. \"You shouldn't have lunch alone...\" as Susy C. said, so she kindly accompanied me to Thai Idea along with her friend.\n\nThai Idea serves authentic vegetarian and vegan Thai dishes which is the first and only restaurant in SF to do so. The extensive menu is most similar to the Osha Thai and just as beautifully presented at the fraction of the cost. Everything on the menu (for lunch and dinner) is no more than $11.95.

The wooden skewer made to replicate a drumstick was wrapped around faux chicken meat which tasted just as moist and flavorful as chicken thigh meat. The exterior was slightly crispy so you still get a crunch factor to mimic fried chicken skin without the cholesterol. The homemade sauce gave it a nice sticky sweet tang with a fiery kick. \n\n*PUMPKIN CURRY: Kabocha Pumpkin, Veggie Beef in Red Curry Sauce Topped w/ Crispy Yam & Brown Rice ($8.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f8kY-c4xNHanSwQuI3nYGg?select=h7RwyIzs6E7isWYCf-mbgw\nThe pumpkin curry was INSANELY good! Silky smooth, the curry was rich in complex spices with a prominent exotic coconut flavor (just the way I like it) and a lovely sweetness from the tender pumpkin.

I've been here several times and it never disappointed, until this time. I've been telling my friend about this place for long, and finally we were in the neighborhood and she insisted on trying it out. \n\nI'm only complaining about the Pad See-ew that I ordered. I've had it before and it tasted great. However, this time, the egg was burnt and the entire dish tasted burnt and bitter. I couldn't stand it so I asked the waiter to bring it back to the kitchen. When the new dish came out, it tasted exactly the same like the first dish, the egg still burnt and the noodle bitter. I was so...disappointed that I had a few bites only. \n\nDespite this minor setback, the rest of the food here is still amazing. \n\nCrispy Cauliflower -- 4.5 STARS -- Deep fried Cauliflower, with sweet sauce and shredded sweet potato strips. I love the long dish they use to hold the cauliflower, so instead of cluster together, each cauliflower stood in the place, good to the eye as well as the mouth. \n\nPanang Avocado Shrimp -- 5 STARS -- I can't recall having avocado in a stir-fried dish before, though the avocado was not cooked but place in the creamy curry sauce after the shrimp and bell pepper (green and red) strips were cooked. The savory taste of the curry complemented well with the creamy texture of the avocado. I would suggest having brown rice with the dish, because the roughness and firmness of brown rice (compared to brown rice) balance out the creaminess of the curry and avocado. \n\nLastly, the service there can use some improvement, more smiles would do.", "author": "Maggie L."}

Let's just say I definitely leave this place happy, lol. The dish is more tame in terms of spiciness in comparison to other Thai places.

The \"chicken\" is tofu that has been texturized to give a closer (albeit not exact) match to the real deal.  It was flavorful and I had to really control myself to not chow down the entire thing.  (It was quite a large portion.)\n\nMy husband got the Bangkok Duck.  I was a little scared to try it, since I wouldn't eat duck if I weren't veggie, but he promised it was good.  He was right!

There is no meat, no fish sauce, none of that. It's a 100% vegetarian facility. \n\nMy family brought me here for an early birthday celebration. We decided to go family style and just order several things, to get a little taste of everything. \n\nAppetizers: \n*Firecracker Balls: These are described as \"Veggie Ahi tuna roll, panko deep-fried, mayomustard & spicy sauce\". These were hot tasty. The breadcrumbs on the outside had a great crunch factor. Definitely tasted a lot like a real tuna roll. \n\n*Corn Fritter: A bit disappointing. Not my favorite. \n\nMains:\n*Pineapple fried rice: Pretty straightforward. Lots of chunks of pineapple, vegetables, and veggie shrimp. It can also be ordered vegan, so they can skip the egg. \n\n*Green Curry: This was my favorite out of the bunch. I definitely recommend it. Great flavors. I would probably order it spicy next time, since it was more on the sweet side.\n\n*Bangkok Duck: On the menu, it's described as \"Tamarind glazed crispy fried Veggie duck confit with crispy shallots and chili.\" It seemed to be wrapped in some type of puff pastry. My dining companions really enjoyed it. I've only had duck once, but it was a pretty close match. \n\n*Pad Ped: I was eyeing either the Eggplant or the Vegetable Combination, but my brother seemed to think those were \"boring\", so I opted for this instead. It has a spicy red sauce (a bit on the salty side) with bell peppers, onions, cauliflower, broccoli, eggplant. \n\nDessert: \n*Fried Banana: YUM. This was a great ending to our meal. The outside coating was golden brown and had a perfect texture. The coconut ice cream on the side was cool and refreshing. They even gave us six small plates and spoons so we could share. \n\nService was warm and friendly. Our water glasses were never empty. We felt very welcome here. \n\nThe presentation of the food was FABULOUS. Everyone described it as being \"very clean\". Shaved beets or shaved carrots adored the side of most plates, as well as an orchid.

Totally forgot I was supposed to be \"sharing\" with my gf (my bad). \nNext came the pad kraw which stated on the menu that it would be \"slightly spicy\" and I was like \"oh no big, I eat jalape\u00f1os in my sleep\" Psssh WRONG I don't know if slightly means something different in NorCal than SoCal but I suppose so because one bite had me chugging my Chang beer a la Homer Simpson during the chili cook off episode but aside from the hotness surprise it was so delicious and flavorful it made glad I came!

A close friend and I drive across the city to eat here all the time because it has predictably wonderful food and an extremely friendly and accomodating staff. We have never had to wait for a table and while you'd think the parking would be hard, we have never had trouble parking in the neighborhood either. The presentation of the food is beautiful and there are no filler vegetables... you know what I mean... the inexpensive vegetables that no one wants to eat. Thai Idea doesn't do that. :-) I have brought some meat eating friends here and they have all been impressed and the most meat and dairy knoshing of my friends said that he'd eat here all the time if he lived in SF.

I wish they delivered, so we wouldn't have to rely on Los Ros, which is also not a bad place, but a tad bit less vegan friendly, this place with slightly better food overall.   They have creamy peanut dripping satay sticks and meat substitutes like the carnivorous-consistency Wing Bomb.  Sometimes you miss the carnal-ness of flesh eating even with your enlightened Vegan dietary choice.  If you are going down that route, down the route of concentrated and processed meat substitutes, it's always good to start the pallet out with the healthy papaya stuff - called the Som Tum Salad to balance everything out in an aggregate sense.  Their Pad Thai is amazing too, biting into its thick noodle, a consistency that also ranks up there for those who like that kinda stuff.    It's all mouth watering.  Umm, except for their Green Curry, but that's probably just my own taste buds or maybe it's the fact that the only time I got it, I felt that the eggplant wasn't cooked to it's proper \"meltedness\", a proper tenderness so fragile that the eggplant's skin and pulp slices upon forktouch, then taking some of that seasoned eggplant skin and pulp, mixing it into the forkful of rice before dropping off that whole multidimensional admixture into the mouth, the spices, pulp, skin, oils penetrating the rice, activating your tastebudes in a far eastern fugue.  This is good karma.  Their Red Curry rocks, and they can make it all mild, like we need to do it, us with young kids and all.  Their pumpkin curry doesn't disappoint either, now finding ourselves ordering it a bunch now in October and all.\n\nWe mostly order takeout and sometimes come-on in.  They are always gracious and accommodate our stroller needs in that small hallways in-between sets of table high table-surface area salon.  They are all smiles with our kids and nice and can't keep their eyes off of them in a cute way when the place is empty.  We come here a lot too.  Clean bathroom means clean kitchen too, and it's always clean.  Just saying.\n\nThere are other things we have yet to venture-into: Veggie Lamb Yellow Curry.  Volcanic Beef, et al.  All can be made Vegan.\n\nWhat's not to like about this little gem on Polk Street?

Highly recommended!\n\nFound Thai Idea on Yelp. Nice, quiet atmosphere with maybe 20 tables.  Very nicely done. Could be romantic if you get a corner table.  Several families were there with kids but it was still pretty quiet.\n\nThe service is absolutely exceptional.  About half the tables were occupied when we arrived but a surge of patrons filled them all over the next 30 minutes.  We noticed that only 1 waitress was on duty (our receipt said Nan) but she was so friendly and nice and worked so hard that none of the tables lacked for anything.  \n\nThe food is some of the best I've had.  This appears to be a completely vegan menu with the exception of a couple of items that include egg but you can exclude it so that these are vegan as well.  The menu may be confusing because many items can include chicken, beef, lamb, shrimp, etc, in addition to tofu or vegetables.  These are all some fake form of the meats and not the actual meat.  All 4 vegan entrees we had were super tasty with tons of fresh vegetables.  The pumpkin curry with tofu is crazy good--diced pumpkin in a semi-spicy, creamy broth with mushrooms, onion, peppers, tofu, green beans and other veggies. Wow!  Everything else (Chicken Noodle Soup, Kee Mao, Chicken Vindaloo Curry) was equally good and did not appear to be oily or greasy.  \n\nWith the high quality atmosphere, service and food, Thai Idea is a bargain. A no-brainer for vegans or vegetarians and a fantastic choice if you just like good food.", "author": "T T."}

The wing bomb was AMAZING! That delicious tangy sauce paired with the soy chicken which I'm honestly questioning how it isn't chicken was so tasty I think I preferred it over most chicken wings made with real chicken. The Thai ice tea paired well with it and was just sweet enough. The tom yum was packed full of veggies and tasted average but appreciated the vast amount of veggies but I wished there was more broth. The best part was the lamb curry. Once again I question how this could not be meat because of its pure deliciousness and meaty flavor! The curry was just right and tasted better than most curries I've had. Sometimes the consistency can be very thin but not this one, it was just thick enough to coat the brown rice. However, I took off a star for the pad Thai.... That stuff was just bad. I normally love pad Thai and I had an insane craving for it but this disappointed. It was very bland and super sour.

I have never seen a soup with so many veggies in it, you could eat it with a fork, could be served over rice like a curry. Not too spicy or too sweet, just how I like my tom kha. Wasn't super impressed with the veggie chicken, could have done with out any fake meat in the soup. The pad Thai I also ordered with veggie chicken, but it also comes with tofu, so I wouldn't have missed any meat. The eggs are always my favorite part of pad Thai anyway... Well and the peanuts, and the sauce, and the noodles. Love that I can order anything on the menu with out having to worry about fish sauce. When I come back I'll bring more friends to help me eat everything, and I'll be able to try more things.", "author": "Kathleen M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-02-06", "description": "It's really tough to recreate most Thai dishes without fish sauce or shrimp paste, so it's probably not fair to compare this restaurant to your standard Thai joint...but I'm going to do that anyway. \n\nOrdered takeout today and strolled down to the Tenderloin to pick it up - location-wise Thai Idea is not in the super-duper heart of the 'loin, so if you're worried about the location, don't be.  I had my trusty German Corgi with me and they were nice enough to bring my order to the door so I wouldn't have to come in - star for being nice!\n\nI tried the much raved about Wing Bombs and Pumpkin Curry - both were pretty average.  The Wing Bombs ended up being standard fare \"chicken\" drumsticks served with sweet chili sauce.  I remember thinking drumsticks like this were they second coming of...well, chicken...when I first tried them at Golden Era, but since then I've realized you can get them frozen at May Wah.  Not sure if these were frozen or what, but not so impressed - I was hoping these were marinated/doused in sauce, a la hot wings.  The Pumpkin Curry was also OK - the veggies were all fresh and crisp, but curry itself was not so great.  Most of the flavor of the curry didn't seem to come through, there was absolutely no hint of spiciness, and it largely tasted like semi-sweet coconut milk.  A star for fairly standard Thai food.  \n\nFinally prices were pretty standard so nothing to complain about there - the portion on the Wing Bombs is modest (4 wings for $8) but the portion on the Pumpkin Curry was large (probably 2.5 meals for me), so that's a push.  \n\nAgain, maybe not the most thing to compare this restaurant to non-vegetarian Thai, but with so many great Thai options in the 'loin I think it's only appropriate to hold this restaurant to an equally high standard.  All in all, that's a star for good service and a second for pretty standard-fare food.", "author": "Rosers M."}

This was hands-down the best curry dish I've ever had and possibly one of the best meals I've ever had. I could tell from the first bite that this was a dish I would remember and crave and possibly try to recreate later at home. The pumpkin curry sauce was deliciously flavorful without being too heavy or viscous. It coated the vegetarian beef filets, starchy pumpkin cubes, and bell peppers. The dish was topped with crispy yam slivers, which were a brilliant addition and textural contrast. Accolades all around for this culinary delight! As an aside, as I was enjoying, I looked up at some of my fellow diners and one man to the right of me had pretty much cleaned his bowl of pumpkin curry and another guy in the front of the restaurant had just received his order. Apparently, this is a popular dish.

The mint was a bit overpowering and it may have been if there were other greens to balance out the strong flavor. I'm also not sure why they used mint, as opposed to cilantro. The soy chicken was flavorful. The portion size was huge; two people could easily split this as an appetizer.

The food sounded good, was reasonably priced, and was fairly close to the venue.   The place is intimate (read smallish) and off the beaten path a bit.  The decor was attractive and the restaurant had a nice ambiance.  The service people were friendly and attentive.  The food came quickly with a good temperature...hot but not scalding.  \n\nWhat can I say...the food was AWESOME!  Not just because it was a vegetarian Thai restaurant, but because the food was AWESOME!   I have eaten at some vegetarian restaurants that were awful, and I eat at non-vegetarian Thai restaurants fairly often.  The food here was far and above any Thai restaurant I have been to in a long time...and to top it off I could eat anything on the menu.  So fun!  \n\nMy friend, a meat eater, thought the food was great, too.  My friend had the crispy egg roll appetizer, the \"beef' Volcano, and the \"beef\" green curry.  I had the Wing Bomb appetizer, the \"chicken\" Pad Thai, and the yellow \"beef\" curry. I get Pad Thai pretty much every time I eat Thai food, sometimes it's good, sometimes its not so good.  This Pad Thai was fabulous...great flavor and texture.  The yellow curry was made with \"beef,\" potatoes, and onions steeped in a delicious coconut milk yellow curry sauce, with just the right amount of spice (OMG...I am still craving that amazingly delectible curry...yum!!!).   My friend and I shared some Jasmine rice, and we both had iced lychee drinks (very refreshing).  I normally would have ordered a Thai iced tea, but after I tasted my friend's lychee drink, I had to have one, too.  \n\nThe food was plentiful and was served in unusually shaped bowls, which added to the character of the restaurant.  We were so full we could not finish the food nor did we order dessert.  We got 2 appetizers, 4 entrees, rice, and 3 drinks for just over $70...very reasonable.  I can find absolutely no fault with this place, so count 'em...5 stars!  And although it is pretty obvious, yes, I would definitely dine there again, and so should you!!!", "author": "Veg Gal R."}

Given that I'm the only vegan in my circle of friends, they are already putting up with enough dietary pickiness from me, so I don't complain when I dine out with buddies as long as there is some sort of vegan option.\n\nIn this case my sweet friend found this lovely vegetarian and almost completely vegan spot for my to try.  How awesome is that!  I suppose I was immediately inclined to like it, and I did.\n\nFirst and best of all, they serve no booze!  Why is this great?  Because you can buy booze next door and bring it in.  This saves you HUGE dollars on the bill.\n\nOverall the dishes were good.   It gets 4 stars instead of 3 because of all the vegan options and because of the booze factor.  Oh and the prices are good too.  This will be a very good, very cheap dinner in a place with a very nice little atmosphere.  It's hip and cozy, and it doesn't have that \"fast food to go\" feel that some asian restaurant do.\n\nOn to the food...\n\nGolden Cauliflower:  I didnt' realize this would be deep fried, I don't usually order deep fried.  But it was soooooo good everyone loved it. I suppose deep fried is always good.  \n\nSatay Chicken:  I'm not a big fan of immitation meat, but this was good. My husband and our friend really liked it.  (gosh, I'm started to realize WHAT A PICKY EATER i am, lol - I swear I usually find things to like).\n\nSom Tum:  This was a nice big portion, but overall they made it way too sweet for me.  It's a green papaya salad and I know it's a common/famous dish in thai restaurants, maybe it's always this sweet? I just found it waaaay too sweet.\n\nSpicy Lemongrass Beef:  Good!  A nice curry.

Short of it is, I don't think my meal was contained any fewer calories than non-vegan Thai -- BUT, it was extremely tasty and the overall experience was wonderful.\n\nIf you ignore the view of the tendorloin mess outside the window, the restaurant looks quite upscale and has a superb ambience.  Staff is super attentive and friendly too.  \n\nFor food we ordered:\n--Tofu Pumpkin Curry ($8.95) -- Amazing presentation and even better taste.  A very light curry that I suspected has less cream than other curries.  Served with a tower of brown rice. \n--Veggie Chicken Pad See Ew ($7.95) -- My first time trying \"veggie chicken\" -- while it doesnt taste like chicken (and I wonder if there'd be any difference if i ordered \"veggie duck\"), the texture of the faux meat was great -- as was the flavor.  The noodles were cooked to the dark brown that I like with a lot of \"wok hei\" (flame flavor).  There was about two tablespoons too much oil in the dish -- so I'd ask to go easy on the oil next time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-05", "description": "I *really* wanted to write a 5-star review of Thai Idea.  After all, I'm a veg*n, Thai Idea is located just a few blocks from my home, and they have a very impressive menu.  Added to that, the servers were charming and helpful, and the space is appealing.  However, a number of problems came up that prevent me from giving them a higher rating.\n\nFirst, I telephoned in a takeaway order for an appetizer and two entrees, based upon their website's current menu.  The total price they quoted to me on the phone was a few dollars more than what their on-line menu came to, which confused me.  Also, I asked the young woman on the phone to make my entree _mild_.  She repeated my order back thus, so I presume that she understood it.  Not only do I find spicy food unpleasant to eat, it's really hard on my digestive system, so I have to make it a point to specify \"mild\".  And \"mild\" means \"mild\", not \"contains 10% less cayenne than 'regular'\".\n\nWe walked over to pick up the order, and the young lady at the counter first got confused and handed us someone else's order but, suspecting that it was incorrect, we asked her what dishes it contained.  Sure enough, our order was in a different bag.  Not a serious problem -- unless, of course, we hadn't caught the mistake until we had gotten home.  \n\nAlso, we discovered why it was $3 more than the on-line menu stated: the prices on the paper menus, from which they reckon things, were $1 more for each of the dishes.  Call me old-fashioned, but I believe that the prices listed on your website are what a restaurant should charge their customers who are calling in orders from it (and the laws of State of California agree).  And $10 for a veggie entree is a bit steep, especially compared to neighborhood competitors like Golden Era.\n\nWhen we *did* get home, we broke into the food.  We started with crab cakes, which were quite good, and unlike anything else I've had in veggie form.  I'd definitely get them again.  I had ordered Pad See-Ew with shrimp.  It was tasty, but on a hotness scale of zero to ten (with zero being absolutely bland and ten being the hottest thing I've ever eaten), it was about a 4; too spicy for me to really enjoy.  I even found red pepper flakes in the sauce.  'Twas a shame, since the other flavors were quite nice, but they were largely drowned out by heat.\n\nI would like to raise my rating of Thai Idea, and to try it again (and will likely do so).  But they need to make a few changes before I'm willing to give them more stars.  They need to be careful to charge their customers the prices that are listed, or at the very least, explain why they're charging more than the listed prices.  They need to take patrons seriously when they ask for dishes to be prepared \"mild\".  And they need to be very careful to double-check that they're giving patrons the correct order.  Nothing ruins a dining experience like being given someone else's order, and not discovering it until you get home.  \n\nIf Thai Idea can do these things, I'll be happy to raise their rating commensurately.  I want to enjoy their food and I want them to succeed.  Whether or not that happens is entirely up to them.", "author": "Curran H."}

The dish looked good and flavored very well. Still wondering why i am giving 1 star? The veggie catfish pieces were very thin seemed over-deep fried as each piece was hard and cruchy with no taste as no texture. As a teaser, there were just one of two pieces that were kind of juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside, giving me an idea of how good this dish could have been. Not sure whether I was unlucky in getting an over-fried dish or the dish is made that way. If it is made that way, it is certainly not for me. Plus, I walked 1.5 miles from my work just to try this, and you can understand how disappointed I must have been. Don't think I will come here again as I have tried some of their other dishes in the past and did not feel their mock meat was as good as many people are raving in yelp or available elsewhere. \n\nWhat surprises me is I see so many reviews saying the food is cheap here. I\n don't understand what is cheap. Personally I feel their dishes are very pricey and not worth the money or walk for me. The lunch specials all are $10 (+ tax & tip) or more, plus the curry entrees does not come with rice. So you look at spending at least $11.50 for a lunch. The spicy catfish was like $12.50 plus bought a rice, so total bill was a little less than $16. $16 for a meal for one person is too pricey for me, which I could have digested had it been good. If the dish was alteast in the $10 range and came with rice I could give it 2 stars.

Yum.\n\nI got the Pumpkin Curry w/ \"chicken\" (all fake meat) & brown rice. The rice was perfect. The curry was amazing - not spicy not the menu states (1 star for spicy compared to other dishes w/ 3 stars!). The cubes of pumpkin were fork-tender & made me swoon. The faux-chicken isn't something I'd do again though. Brown, flat pieces of \"chicken\" that tasted a bit slimy & chewy (when tasted alone but when eaten in combo w/ the dish I didn't notice as much). Next time, I'll stick w/ tofu. \n\nMy friend got a noodle dish w/ tofu. (the middle choice on the noodle options on the menu).

What do I mean by that...  \n\nIf you've been to Thai restaurant, vegan/vege or not, then you know the disappointment of overly sweet, water down, less savory echos of quickly made Thai food. \n\nThai Idea delivers deep flavors that are not held back, presentation was perfect, and I found myself experiencing an unexpected 5 star moment of bliss. One word of advice, they do not tone down the spice for, I am guessing, the typical American palate as they should not, so when requesting hotness of your food drop it down one notch....ie. if you like it medium go with mild, if you like it mild perhaps no heat for you. If you want a real experience let them spice it how it should be, you will not be disappointed.\n\n6 stars for the cuisine\n5 stars for the comfy yet artistic environment\n5 stars for presentation\n5 stars for the price considering all of the above ($7-10 for entree) \n5 stars for the friendly wait staff and the owner checking how the meal went\n\nI only wish this place was in Berkeley and I didn't have to go into the city for something this good.\n\nEven the bathroom was nice and upscale.", "author": "Wish W."}

When it came out, I saw the mango was the green type of mango, and that the sticky rice had sesame as garnish.\nIt's a pet peeve of mine when there are ingredients in my food that weren't mentioned in the menu (if I knew there'd be sesame, I would have said something beforehand), but it happens so much that I should probably just get over it :p lol *sigh*\nWhen I asked the hostess about the mango, she said, \"yes, right now the sweet mangoes aren't in season maybe.\"(having green mangoes is something a server should mention, because it's NOT the norm for this dessert, but some patrons may still opt for it) I explained that I wish this issue was expressed when I ordered because I'm not OK with tart/sour foods. (I could have saved us both the time :P)\nThe reason I'm giving my visit 4 stars is because mistakes are made, but the service was VERY friendly and customer oriented. She understood the problem and promptly returned my money. The minus one star is for not communicating the food issue when I placed my order, and because their website states they have not only coconut vegan ice cream, but regular vanilla as well. The website needs to be updated to reflect their no longer having the vanilla, and other items that have also changed.", "author": "Awesomeness S."}

They've got that going for them.  \n\nThe pros:  Wonderful service, beautiful presentation, nice atmosphere.\n\nBut where it counts, the food fails to deliver.  The peanut sauce was bland, as was the satay chicken.  I ordered the crispy chicken expecting it to be different from the BBQ chicken, but it was just the BBQ chicken with a coating of fried batter.  The fried rice that it topped was very average.  My friend's Pad Kee Mao was nothing out of the ordinary.  (They are very good about making a dish genuinely spicy if requested, however.)  It was not busy, but the fresh spring rolls were mysteriously unavailable for order during lunch.\n\nThey undoubtedly fill a niche that's been dying to be filled since Mekong, which served wonderful Veggie Thai food, closed several years ago.  As a vegetarian, it's always a pleasure to order Thai and not have to worry about fish or oyster sauce inundating your entrees and dips.  But I'd rather they spend the energy they use to window dress their plates to flavoring up their food instead.\n\nI'd give them another chance; I'd really like them to succeed, but they need a bit of tough love.  Because as it stands, Ken's Kitchen Chinese restaurant at the end of the block has great fake meat (though you'd never guess from the outside).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-30", "description": "I finally got a chance to try this place out. I've read about it in articles and blogs, plus Yelpers praise this place! I went with my boyfriend and even though he is not vegetarian, he does not mind eating fake meat and is always willing to try it (but this guy is a meat lover and probably would not turn vegetarian).\n\nThis place is really cute. It has a modern Thai ambiance. I like the pillows laid out on some sitting areas, plus I like the color decor of browns and greens. I really loved the tree art they had near the register... very cute! I opened the menu and I was just overwhelmed by all the dishes and options! I wanted to order everything. After debating over what we wanted, here is what we ended up ordering:\n\nAPPETIZER - CRAB CAKES (Vegan)\nWe opted for the vegan, because my boyfriend  freaked when he heard the word \"egg\" (the one piece of food he hates). These were delicious! I never really had a crab cake in my life, since I am allergic to shellfish so I really can't compare them to regular crab cakes. These were crunchy, had a slight \"crab/fish\" taste, and had a very flavorful sauce that went on top of the cakes. It also came with a few pieces of potato wedges on the plate, which was a little treat. He also enjoyed them and we devoured these really fast!\n\nPINEAPPLE BROWN FRIED RICE\nI do not eat white rice, so when I asked to substitute the fried rice with brown... I was glad that she was willing to do so! I did not want to just order plain brown rice, because the description of the pineapple fried rice sounded too good to pass up.  The menu said: pineapple, chicken, shrimp, and some other veggies... but when it came out it the dish had other ingredients in it. One, instead of chicken it was beef... Then as I mentioned, my boyfriend hates egg, so we usually order fried rice without egg. We assumed that since the menu didn't list egg we didn't have to worry, but it had it when we got it. He was really disappointed but sucked it up and still ate it. I think this partly ruined his dinner, and I felt bad but he insisted that we not order a plain bowl of rice since there was so much food. To me, it was good but something tasted a little off to me. I can't really describe the taste but I did not like it and the taste kept creeping into my nose. I was drowning it with the curry to not taste it.\n\nPUMPKIN CURRY WITH BEEF\nThis was yummy! My boyfriend always orders pumpkin curry, so of course he had to get it here. I really enjoyed the crispy strips of sweet potato on top, plus this curry was full of flavors! I liked the texture of the squash/pumpkin, which was soft and mushy. The fake beef was good, but was a little too chewy.\n\nAVOCADO SHRIMP PANANG CURRY\nThis is the dish I ordered and I thought the avocado complimented the curry really well! I was a little hesitant to order at first because I would never think about having avocado in my curry, but I loved it a lot. The shrimp didn't really taste like what I remember shrimp to taste like, but I still enjoyed this dish.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the food, I came to the realization that I prefer fried tofu in my curries over the fake meat/shrimp. I think sometimes fake meat can get too chewy for my liking and I think tofu soaks up the curry taste more. I look forward in going to this restaurant again and trying their other dishes! Next time, I will make sure to leave room for dessert because I was way too full!", "author": "Aiza B."}

It's not the typical papaya salad you'd expect with the fish sauce, but it is damn delish.\n\nI opted for the Duck curry (not real duck, but looks and tastes just like it!).

If you only eat small portions like my girlfriend does, an order of this four-piece appetizer and some rice will fill you up.\n\nThe first entree we had was the Bangkok Duck, which was deliciously accompanied by a sweet tamarind sauce. I rarely eat duck -  vegetarian or otherwise - so providing a comparison between this dish and other duck entrees would be worthless. The bottom line is that my girlfriend and I both enjoyed this dish tremendously, although she didn't like the outside breading, whereas I did.\n\nI found the Thai IDEA Beef to be pleasant. I generally do not like mock beef, as it is usually chewy. This dish was not an exception, but that isn't to say I didn't find it delightful. The Panang Avocado Shrimp curry was the only unsatisfactory part of our meal. The shrimp wasn't very tasty; the curry itself was decent, but nothing special.\n\nWe complimented our meal with the Lychee Iced Tea, which was flavorful, but incredibly sweet - to the point where we had to mix in a good amount of water.\n\nIt has been some time since I have been excited about trying a new restaurant.

This was my first experience with \"veggie meat\" and I can say I definitely will eat it again (which is a lot to say about a food posing as another food because I'm usually not into that).  Here is a breakdown of the food I tried:\n\nTom Kha - This coconut soup was delicious! It had lots of great veggies in it. I generally like Tom Kha a little spicy so I may ask if they can do it that way next time but regardless it was super tasty.\n\nVolcanic Beef - The \"veggie beef\" had the texture and taste of very tender beef.  The presentation of the dish was beautiful. It was pretty spicy and very tasty. The onion ring on top was a yummy touch.\n\nGarlic and Pepper - This dish usually comes with a choice of chicken, beef, tofu or shrimp (all veggie of course). I decided that since I had never tried these \"meats\" that I would go for a combo of chicken, beef and shrimp. The sauce was wonderful and I used it all over my rice. The beef was the same kind that was in the volcanic beef. The shrimp was a little weird to see since it was shaped like and felt like shrimp but wasn't. I think I might actually like the veggie shrimp better than real shrimp because I didn't have to wonder if the dish would taste fishy. The chicken was really flavorful but I wasn't diggin the texture (this is personal preference though). This is a great dish to get to try the different meats and there are lots of great veggies in it too.\n\nThai Iced Tea - Standard and very good\n\nIf you are looking for a vegetarian experience that non-veg people will enjoy this is it. I will definitely be back.", "author": "Brittany M."}

Surprised that the sauces came on top rather than as dips.  The fried potatoes and salad garnish were a nice touch though.\n\nROASTED DUCK CURRY:  About half way through this dish, I finally found some veggie meat product floating in the sea of far-too-rich coconut red curry sauce.  I'm sure that the \" roast duck\" was the same stuff we get out of a can for $1.50 from the Vietnamese market a block away.  There were also some underdone red bell pepper and tomato wedges and canned pineapple chunks.  I can see why the person who took our order thought that I should get some rice to soak up the sauce and make it seem like there was more substance to the dish.\n\nPAD SEE EW with Shrimp:  This was my husband's dish and I only had a bite of it, but I have to say that their supposed \"wok hei\" noodles were not a patch on Sam Wo's for more than twice the price.\n\nI'm not as optimistic as he is about giving this restaurant another chance, but if he's buying...", "author": "Kelly H."}

The tofu is as good and as well-prepared as you can find in China or Taiwan, and the accompaniments were all there. \n\nService was the crown jewel of this establishment.

That is why I was very disappointed today -- on a day when I am recovering from a bad flu and just needed my partner to pick me up some simple, healthy food to-go -- that Thai Idea put old tofu that had gone off and fermented, into my soup.\n\nYou see, I know my local tofu, too. The tofu they used was Wo Chong's fresh tofu, which is distributed in large brown boxes, and oftentimes sold in local Asian markets at 5 pieces of tofu per dollar. Wo Chong is really good local tofu... but it doesn't keep well unless properly stored in a cold environment, and replaced with fresh water, ideally twice a day. Part of the problem could be that the restaurant ran out of stock and went to one of the local markets for fresh tofu. Unfortunately, the local markets aren't always very good at keeping their tofu fresh either, which is a problem I have experienced before, and which can cause diarrhea and stomach upset. \n\nIf you want great tofu, go straight to Wo Chong in Chinatown, get it same-day fresh, and either eat it immediately or put it in a container with lots of water and store it in your fridge. But for a restaurant -- especially a vegetarian restaurant -- to serve a customer bad tofu is unacceptable, even if they have otherwise great food... which Thai Idea does. \n\nSorry, but healthiness and freshness of the food comes first, and is a problem that must be addressed. For this reason, I must give Thai Idea 1 star -- and deny them my business -- until such point as they make a clear effort to correct this problem.", "author": "Mark K."}

The Tenderloin location is definitely on the sketchy side, but once you get off the sidewalk, you are in a cozy little dining room with nice furnishings. The food is delightfully presented and tasty. Service is prompt and friendly.\n\nAppetizers may seem on the pricy side--nearly the price of the entrees--but the portions are generous. I actually wouldn't mind if they had smaller appetizers at more appetizery prices.\n\nPersonal favorites: Fresh salad rolls, tom yum or tom kha soup, panang curry, pad kee mao (spicy noodles). But really nearly everything here is yummy...except for the pad thai. I don't know what it's lacking, but it's lacking something.\n\nThey are often closed by 9:40 even though they say they are open 'til 10:00. I'd give them five stars otherwise.", "author": "Nik G."}

Now I am not a vegetarian but am always up to try great food - friend I took is a vegetarian. We started with the firecracker roll - not bad. Then we had the \"beef\" salad. Amazing flavor and the texture of whatever that \"meat\" was - was pretty \"meaty\". We then went on to the \"lamb\" yellow curry with brown rice and it was delicious. We were about to dive into the Chicken when it happened.....   \n\nI was sitting right by the front door and I had just taken a pic of the beautiful beef salad when some punka$$ dirtbag dashed in, grabbed my iPhone and ran. I yelped (no pun intended) and jumped up. He ran off and I stood there stunned and then the sweet server ran out - as panicked as I was and ran up and down the street with me. What either one of us gals was going to do - I don't know.  I went back inside where my friend sat - also stunned. The other server was already on the phone with the cops. The cops came and he let me use his iPhone to immediately wipe my phone clean. Thai idea has video surveillance and was already accessing the tape to make it available to the cops. Talk about on it.  After the shock had died, I obviously had lost my appetite. The server apologized and I felt like she meant it.  I thanked her and asked her for the bill.  She said no.  (!!!)   I asked again and she waved me off - with sympathy in her eyes. THEN she asked if I wanted a to-go box to take the food home!  These people are a class act. And they have delicious vegetarian food..... the lychee iced tea is pretty dope too. I will go back, but I will NOT sit by the front table by the door - with my shiny iphone sitting out to tempt city trash (mostly because I no longer have one).", "author": "Bethany G."}

We made reservations in advance and had no issue with seating. For four people, we can recommend what we ordered: Satay Chicken, Crab Cakes (app), Papaya Salad, spicy lemon grass beef, Bangkok duck, Pineapple fried frice, pad Thai, pumpkin curry.

It's located in a fairly sketchy neighborhood, so maybe our expectations weren't as high as they might have been, but we came away completely charmed. After several follow-up visits, we have yet to try anything we didn't enjoy, but the real standout has been the Pumpkin Curry, which is kabocha pumpkin (basically a winter squash) and veggies in a red curry sauce that has fantastic flavor with just a hint of spiciness. Every dish is a visual masterpiece, looking like they were created with an artist's brush. The menu features a lot of faux-meats (not really our thing), but there are loads of veggie and whole-food options, too.

I ordered some of the fried spring rolls, expecting them to be a small appetizer considering how the price stacked up against other Bay Area restaurants I'd been to. However, they could practically be a meal on their own for 7$! I also ordered the pad Thai, which was great, and took abut half I it back for leftovers.

We are vegetarians, love thai food (to the point we've taken thai cooking classes to try and learn the secrets of the spices-- we haven't), and had some friends visiting so we met them here for lunch on a weekday. The place is in the tenderloin but is average size, clean and has seating for larger parties -- the street in front is pretty shady so be prepared for that. The server was friendly and the food came out hot/fresh and fast. We ordered the \"crab\" cakes to start, which were breaded, texturized protein with a wasabi mayo sauce and were on the dry side but OK. We shared the pad kee mao with tofu (noodles were not soft and fresh, they were cut thinner (ie pappardelle style) than we typically like), panang curry with \"beef\" (spicy, good flavor), pad eggplant with 'shrimp' (eggplant steamed not pan-fried the way we have to come enjoy eggplant at thai places, 'shrimp' just rubbery without any discernible flavor) and the pad basil which comes with \"ground chicken\" (didn't have much flavor other than basil). The portions were fine, presentation was nice and the flavors were one dimensional.\nI am really not sure why this place is so highly rated -- Thai spice on Polk in Russian Hill and Marnee Thai in the sunset are much better, just to name a few. As vegetarians, you can basically get tofu substituted for meat at every Thai restaurant in SF. Overall, not impressed and not going back.

It didn't seem authentic, but it's not that the food was horrible... It was actually fairly tasty for what it was, except for the Pad Thai which was lacking some flavor, not to mention the noodles were all clumped together. The Pumpkin Curry was a little thin for our liking, but pretty good overall, and the Golden Cauliflower appetizer was hot and fresh, although I'm generally not a fan of sweet and sour type sauces which it was served with. \n\n...so why does Thai Idea == bad idea? The service.\n\n- We must have been sitting there for atleast 10 minutes before anyone even brought us water. \n- We order our food and the waitress asks if we would like white rice or brown rice...\n- \"Brown rice, please.\"\n- The waitress then tells us that the food might take a while because they were overwhelmed with 2 large groups that were there, and asks if we would like an appetizer.\n- \"Will an appetizer come out sooner if we order one?\" my friend asks.\n- \"No, it won't come out any faster.\" she says. So we don't order an appetizer. \n- A few minutes pass, then the waitress comes back. \n- \"Actually, if you order an appetizer, it will come out faster.\" she says. \n- We ask to look at a menu again. I didn't want anything fried, so we ordered the fresh salad rolls. \n- A few minutes pass, and the waitress comes back again.\n- \"Actually, the fresh salad rolls won't come out faster, but if you order something fried, it will come out faster.\"\n- What??? Ok fine. Then we'll take the golden cauliflower. (which actually does end up coming out fairly timely).\n- When the main dishes arrive, the waitress puts a plate of white rice on the table. \"We're out of brown rice.\" she says. No apology, no nothing. \n- What??? I didn't think it was possible for an asian restaurant to run out of rice! Guess I was wrong. \n\nAnd one other thing...they put ALL our leftovers together into a single takeout box...Pad Thai on the bottom, then Pumpkin Curry, then the leftover white rice on top.

They had a wide variety of veggies in the dish and the overall portion was not shy. Not enough to split into two meals but too much for one meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-15", "description": "I am not a vegetarian, but trying to lose some beer pudge has forced me to eat healthier lately, so I gave this place a shot.\n\nI live right around the corner from this place and can see it from my living room window, so I witnessed first-hand its booming early success as a new restaurant in the area.\n\nI eat lots of Thai food. I'm surrounded by it. In general, it's healthy, affordable, and tasty. Those are the three adjectives than win me over when I think of Thai food. Scratch 1.5 of those, for this place is healthy, not affordable and only a little tasty. I know I seem like a naysayer here; when a restaurant comes into an area that is 50-100% more expensive than its competing neighbors and has only vegetarian/vegan dishes, the local SF snobs are going to create a lot of buzz to show off: 1) they can afford it, and 2) they're trendy enough to not eat meat. But are the high prices and aesthetic aura really worth the $10 entrees that don't even include rice (+$2.00)? \n\nThe red curry was excessively oily, the vegetarian chicken tasted like plastic and my girlfriend's food made her turn red and splotchy, which makes me accuse this place of using MSG. Sure, they use fancy silverware and geometric plates and bowls, and the entrees APPEAR as though they should be on Food Network, but that doesn't compensate for the fact that this is a THAI restaurant in the TENDERLOIN. There are plenty of other places within two blocks that offer many of the same vegetarian dishes for 1/2-2/3 the price that taste much more homemade and won't make your MSG allergies emerge. This place is, quite frankly, overrated. Sorry to be a bummer, but I'm not one to cling to pretentious SF trends. I wouldn't be surprised if I saw a bunch of Segways and Nissan Leafs parked outside this place being driven by people with anti-cigarette stickers on their cars and smudges of their own crap hanging off their noses. I really wish I could hear what sorts of comments people will make when they read this. I apologize for being a realist. Go flare your nostrils now.", "author": "Eliot R."}

The noodles were well cooked and seasoned and full of veggies. \n\nI wasn't as impressed with their soy \"meats\" here as other veggie places. I prefer Enjoy Vegetarian or Golden Era in that regard.

On one of the standardly grimy blocks of The Tenderloin is a new promise of lunch time hope. On the few occasions that I don't pack my own lunch to work, and grab a bite to eat in the TL, I sometimes have a hard time separating myself from the yuckiness of the streets, to the food-safe environment inside the restaurant.  At Thai Idea, I was able to enjoy that separation, and as a result, thoroughly enjoy my delicious lunch!\n\nI'm not new to vegetarian Asian cuisine, but this was my first time trying out a place which is Thai-specific.  As with my past experiences with meat substitutes, the soy and gluten meat doesn't taste like the real thing, but they do a good job of making it taste pretty darn flavorful.  Combined with a texture that is consistent with a particular type of meat, who cares if it's the real thing or not, it's tasty!  I had the pad kee mow, with \"chicken\", and despite having just recovered from an abdominal surgery, I left not a single molecule of a noodle on the plate.  The heat of the chili was perfect.  It offered a bit of pizzazz, but without overpowering the other flavors in the dish.   The vegetables were tender, but not over cooked, and the noodles slid across my tongue like silk, yet, had a satisfying bite to them.  Before leaving, I had some of their coconut ice cream.  Because there is no milk fat in the ice cream, it is light, and the coconut flavor is very natural.\n\nFrom the exterior, it's rather nondescript, but a peak in the window is rather inviting.  The decor is fresh and modern, and most important, everything looks clean.  The lunch crowd there wasn't overly populated, so we were seated in an instant, and the two servers who we interacted with were rather pleasant and welcoming.

The drink menu was very small, and the Jasmine tea was a bagged Trader Joe's.\nIt is a cozy, tame and pleasant atmosphere, an easy place for conversation. I really enjoyed Nina's yellow curry (a thick, heavily flavored slightly spicy broth), though the lamb meat was also pretty bitter - though better tasting than the beef. I found the prices a little higher than expected(~12-15$ / entree), though they do an excellent job on presentation and preparation, aside from the meats.

The Tom Kha soup was authentic and perfectly savory. The tamarind duck...oh geez....the \"skin\" was crispy and savory-sweet.  The Thai iced tea was also done very well; not overly sweet like most restaurants. Everything about this meal was so scrumptious, and the portion sizes were very reasonable as well. The menu is also extensive enough that you can come back multiple times and order something new every time. (quick public service warning: you should only order medium spicy if you like it hot, and only order hot if you're into BDSM...)\n\nThe service was amazing too. The food came out super quickly and in the end, the owner even came out himself and asked us how the food went! The decor was trendy, and the bathroom smelled like Christmas...I can't say enough good things about this place!\n\n ps. Before I went, I had a dream about the beef that they served there and that the owners told me that it beef was actually not vegan and that they were serving emu meat to vegans/vegetarians, but I'm happy to report that it tasted nothing like what I imagined emu meat to taste like!\n\nGo to Thai Idea!!

The waiter informs you that you can get beer next door, where you pay $4 for a 22 of a local IPA.  Much better deal than any restaurant and so easy.  This also gives Thai Idea a leg up over other vegan Asian restaurants in SF, which are typically completely dry.\n\nThere's enough reviews on here that I probably don't need to go into too much detail about how the portions are great for the price (not to mention the presentation) and the staff are super friendly.  But I have to mention two things.\n\nOne, this is the first restaurant I have been to, in my memory, period, where I ask for extra spicy and they really BRING IT. (Though not too many items on their menu are marked as spicy, you can make anything spicy to your desired level.)  In that, I'm sucking air and eyes watering.  That I can't finish my meal and have to take 3/4 of it home.  That I order dessert merely to calm the burning in my mouth because the beer I'm drinking alternating with water (attentively proffered) is not sufficient. I really enjoy spicy and most places don't seem to take me at my word.  Next time I go to Thai Idea I'll know to order medium spicy.\n\nThat said, this exposed me to my next favorite thing about Thai Idea: the coconut ice cream.  I had the vegan Thai crepe with ice cream, and the crepe itself was a bit forgettable, but the ice cream was amazing.  It has chunks of toasted coconut meat and a wonderful texture and flavor.  Because of the chunks, I had to ask them if they made it in-house.  The waiter said he didn't think so and insisted on checking on the source for me.  Apparently they get it from a distributor in LA who imports it from Thailand.  It is pretty amazing, and I look forward to trying it with the fried banana next time.\n\nNice big windows so you can keep an eye on your bicycle locked up outside.", "author": "Tamara F."}

From food taste, food presentation, the ambiance, cleanliness, the friendliness of the staff, ability to order online, and the prices of all the dishes, this restaurant far exceeds most of the Thai restaurants in SF. While I am a vegetarian (so this place is the only place I would order from, now on), most reviews from other, otherwise carnivore, Yelpers should attest to how good this place is. \n\nSo far, I have only had Take-Out several times (Green Curry and Pad Basil) - all super well-made): \n\n* The *Biggest comment is on the food portions. For the same price you would pay at Thai Express, Zen Yai, T2J, Ozone Thai, you get approx. 2 or 3 times the food, depending on the comparison restaurant. The portions are in-line (if not exceeding) what you would expect to get for $8-9. \n\n* As a vegetarian, I don't have to worry about fish sauce in anything, or about cooks re-using the same cookware to prepare my veg. dishes as they've used for non-veg. dishes. If you're a vegetarian, you would appreciate this. \n\n* If you order a non-curry entree, the presentation of the food in the take-out container was (surprisingly) nice...it just *looked* well-placed in the container. This might be silly comment, but, again, this is attention to detail even in a take-out order!\n\nWhile it's location may not be ideal, everything else is....", "author": "M s."}

Thai idea vegetarian looked much nicer than the other places around it and had good reviews, so I went in. I hate eating alone!! But sometimes it's a necessity. It was 6pm on a Tuesday, but the restaurant was mostly empty and I was seated right away. Comfy pillow seat! The inside was nice and restful. What I personally didn't like about the menu was that it was full of imitation meat. I'm a part time vegetarian, but even if I were full time, I'd not want to eat that stuff. If they are making plant matter to taste and feel like meat, what on earth are they doing to it? It seems scary. I'd rather eat real meat, or just eat vegetarian things that look and taste like vegetarian things. I wish they had more real vegetarian options on the menu. So I got sweet and sour tofu with veggies and rice. Good choice. Many sweet and sour recipes are super sweet, but this was not (it was sweet, but not cloying). Great sauce, without being over sauced. Cucumbers, tomatoes, pineapple..and the tofu super yummy. Great presentation as well. The thai iced tea was pretty good too! The only drawback was, it was hard to get the waitresses attention. There were only a few of us in there, and there was a waitress just standing at the register staring into space, while I sat there with my menu down, looking at her intently to try to catch her eye, willing her in my head to come over so I could order (after all, I was in a rush). She walked around aimlessly, not even thinking about me, even though it was pretty easy to see me, and finally another waitress came out, not the one who had started waiting on me, and took my order. So, the service was a bit iffy, but not too iffy because no one was rude, but it definitely wasn't great. I only had time to eat less than half before doggie bagging it and heading on my way, but the rest tasted good at 11pm when I got home! I would come here again, if I were in the area and give them another try. Oh, and not sure why some people were saying it's pricey, my meal came out under $20. I think $16 for the drink, rice and entree.", "author": "Merredith L."}

After a fun afternoon at the Asian Art Museum we walked four quick blocks to Thai Idea and got a seat, no problem. We had good service and the decor is nice, bathrooms clean and comfortable. We ordered the spring rolls, Tom Kha with tofu & chicken, and the Pad See Yu with beef. The \"meats\" are gluten based, and very juicy and tasty. The rolls were served cut in half standing in a martini glass (cute and easy to grab): they could be a little fatter with more filling, but the sauce was super yummy with nice chili bite. The Tom Kha was a standout: hearty, full flavored base with great variety of veggies, mushrooms and silky tofu and gluten chicken. Terrific! The Pad See Yu was very tasty too. For dessert we had the fried bananas with coconut ice cream: a little disappointing as the bananas tasted flat, would suggest a nice seasoning like cinnamon/clove/nutmeg in the batter. The Thai iced tea was delish, served in a tall thin glass. All the presentations were lovely, with flowers and touches like ribbons of beet on the Pad See Yu.

We ordered the Wing Bombs and Chicken Vindaloo and they were both so flavorful and delicious. My husband, who eats meat, really enjoyed the meal as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-10", "description": "Extra points for being vegetarian friendly. The fried rice is flavorful, the pad thai is good, and the papaya salad is probably the best I've had. This place is really cute inside. The complimentary carrot soup they serve at lunch was not my favorite and made me nervous for the rest of my meal. BBQ \"chicken\" was just OK. This is near my place of learning and so I will definitely return.", "author": "Erin M."}

After some wine, she brought me to this amazing restaurant (she's a vegetarian! ) and since I'm carnivorous, I expected the worst...but Oh, my! I was speechless! The restaurant was very well decorated and the presentation was fabulous! But what really surprised me was that vegetarian foods are actually good! We had firecracker balls as starters, then I had the shrimp and avocado curry ( hmmm! Yummy!) and my aunt had the pumpkin curry which looked so delicious! My descriptions for the food: yummy...yummy...yummy!", "author": "Adele V."}

New to SF and I was on a quest to find somewhere I can eat that I don't feel completely guilty. Their mock meat is tasty although I don't know if its GMO free. Had the pumpkin curry and it was as good as everybody on here said. Highly recommend this place, I would be an addict if I lived any closer. Area is kind of funny. During dinner some black dude was throwing fire crackers at people every couple of minutes.", "author": "Diver D."}

Then the appetizers.. so beautifully displayed that I had to photograph them before they were eaten.  I had the chicken satay and the wing bomb.  The wing bomb was the best, but I have been dreaming about both for a week.  The menu is very well labeled what is vegan (V), and what can be made vegan if you ask (VO).  I had the fried rice and something with tofu for my entree and it was really great, but not as good as the appetizers.  When I go back, I'm definitely choosing a different entree.  The service was quick and very attentive.  My water was filled constantly (maybe too much?) and plates were swifted off my table right as I was done with my last bite.  That part was a little weird but I guess you have make room for the next course IMMEDIATELY!  The inside of the restaurant is very cute and comfortable.  I'll be back soon!", "author": "Janey F."}

I'm vegan and they also have great options on the menu - in fact the whole meal we shared that night was vegan including papaya salad which I rarely get to eat at most Thai restaurants!  It was delicious. The atmosphere is cool and the service was excellent.  Even though we're so lucky with Thai restaurants all over the city, I can't wait to get back to this one again!", "author": "Marc M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-22", "description": "Just had a meal at Thai Idea that featured probably the best curry I've had in years. I ordered the pumpkin curry with faux chicken and it was buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  I also got the white rice (which sadly, is NOT Thai sticky rice boooo!...just normal rice.) and a nice vegan Thai iced tea in an extremely tall and narrow glass. A+ for presentation on the whole and for the great decor.  I DO wish they would frost the street windows so you couldn't see the unattractive sights and passerby hobos outside the doors, but inside it was modern and chic, the service was really great from the chef and waitress/hostess, and my partner enjoyed the meal as much as I did.  We both agreed, this is our new favorite place!  The menu is about 10-15% overpriced compared to other Thai places, but it's worth it for the taste (it's like buttery coconut heaven!) and the peace of mind you get from knowing there are no fish or meat products in your food. Now, if only they would replace the white rice with sticky rice, I'd send them a love-letter...", "author": "Lisita P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-31", "description": "This place is pretty good. I ordered the Pad Kee Mao with faux chicken and shrimp. I am a vegetarian as well as a serious thai consumer. The food was great but I think it would be better if the veggie meats were cooked more and perhaps maybe a little bit more crispy. Also, I am not sure I fully like their choice in faux chicken yet. I think they could do better with their choice as a serious vegetarian. Also, their peanut sauce is a little too flavorless so far. I think that in a few months their food will be perfect. They should consider macrobiotic vegan cooking combined with authentic thai styles. Also, their drink selections could be better. I would recommend that they added things like Kombucha, healthy energy drinks, ginger beer, and things of the health food variety. It will earn them profits and up their value. Take Love & Haight Deli for example. That place has the right idea. If they insist on serving pepsi and coke they should serve pepsi and coke with real sugar in glass bottles. Little things add to appeal. I think this place is off to an excellent start and really love the way they chop their vegetables. Their preparation is 5 stars.", "author": "Sashy R."}
