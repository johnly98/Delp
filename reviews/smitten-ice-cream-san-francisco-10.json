One of the girls in the back throws a cone at her co-worker, because of the angle it is thrown across the co-workers chest. Said co-worker is super confused so the girl in the back grabs the cone and puts it on top of the ice cream bowl and says \"can you just eat it like that,  we're busy\". Rude much? \n\nThey also got my friends order wrong,  they confusingly asked her if she wanted the ice cream to go then when her order comes up they give her chocolate sauce in a take out box,  an empty cone and a bag......

So i asked, if this was the other one and the dude was rude and he's like \"why would that be\" and I'm like cuz I have a cookie dough one as well?

For their first day, all proceeds go to La Cocina (https://www.lacocinasf.org/mission). Love that and thank you for giving back to the community!\n\nSmitten's liquid nitrogen made ice cream has rotating seasonal flavors. Today, they had Earl Grey, Classic Vanilla, Tcho Chocolate, Cookie Dough Lemon Gingersnap, and Turmeric Gold Latte. Prices for seasonal flavors (the latter two): Small - $6 and Regular - $7. Waffle bowl +$1.50. Cc's accepted.\n\nSince they didn't have my usual go to (Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche), I tried the Lemon Gingersnap in a Waffle Bowl ($6 + $1.50 for waffle bowl): http://bit.ly/2mxbfUN. \n\nWhat I love about Smitten's ice cream is the texture is always on point - super creamy, silky smooth, and nicely dense (no air pockets). The lemon gingersnap was zesty and tart with a good amount of gingersnaps for texture. Really refreshing but doesn't hold a candle to the cr\u00e8me fraiche with pear caramel...I like really simple ice cream flavors. \n\nLoved the waffle bowl - crunchy, buttery, and vanilla-y. It held up very well. When I flipped the bowl over midway just to eat the cone, it was still crunchy. \n\nService was ultra-friendly and smiley on opening day so kudos for that. On my last two visits at their original Hayes Valley location, the customer service wasn't nice and I got a side of 'tude from one of the staff there. \n\nAs for seating, there's a bench and a standing counter so you can people watch as you lick (no pun intended). There's also a public parklet outside so you can bring your furbaby. \n\nWhile Smitten's ice cream is solid, their pricing is a little steep. The same quantity and quality of ice cream (with unique flavors) can be found at Garden Creamery down the block for $2 less.

I initially hadn't realized that the ice cream was made with liquid nitrogen, but the huge tank behind the bar and the open kitchen area definitely proved me wrong.\n\nI got the Dirty Horchata, which was a flavor created in collaboration with the Boba Guys. One of my friends got the vanilla ice cream with strawberry proseco sauce. The texture of the ice cream was smooth--definitely smoother than your average ice cream. The horchata flavor was also pretty good as well and tasted a bit more like coconut and coffee than horchata itself, but was still good. The vanilla was pretty standard, and the sauce was nice and tart, but not aggressively proseco flavored. I think I'd expected a stronger flavor, but I still enjoyed it.\n\nDespite coming right around closing time, the staff was friendly and didn't try to rush us out as they prepped to close. I'd definitely come back for a chance to sample some of their other classic flavors next time!", "author": "Catherine H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-03", "description": "Ice cream is one of my favorite things in the world. I have a great distaste for gimmicky things like rolled ice cream. I was at first skeptical of freshly churned ice cream. It seemed like just another toy with some liquid nitrogen. BUT, this is damn good. This is some of the smoothest ice cream I've ever had. They use organic milk and cream so it's a good quality base too. There's only a couple of flavors available per day but there's a good variety. On top of that, this location wasn't busy at all so I didn't have to wait long either. \n\nFor those interested in why I have such a distaste for rolled ice cream and the science of why Smitten works, read on. In order for ice cream to be smooth, you need to get the ice crystals to be super small. This means either having higher milk fat or egg yolks that act as stabilizers and emulsifiers.  Gelato on the either hand compensates the lower milk fat  by churning for longer. It also has a shorter shelf life for the same reason. Because Smitten uses liquid nitrogen, the fastest readily available cooling agent, it allows the cream to freeze super fast while attaining smaller ice crystals. Add a little agitation and you get air in the cream which adds to the smooth velvety feeling in your mouth. Rolled ice cream on the other hand involves pouring cream on a anti freeze griddle which isn't as fast or cold as liquid nitrogen and there's very little air introduced when it's pressed and re-scraped. Rolled ice cream falls short of being novel whereas Smitten's machine may be the coolest new innovation on ice cream in a long time.", "author": "Regina C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-18", "description": "I reaaaally wanted to like Smitten Ice Cream more than I did. Why? Because the flavors sounded bomb, their branding is on point, and who doesn't love liquid nitrogen!? Unfortunately, the ice cream turf wars are in full force around Valencia, and Smitten's got some stiff neighborly competition. \n\nI was hoping for Salted Caramel upon arrival, but it was not available at the location. No biggie. I decided to try the Blueberry Lavender, because blueberry AND lavender are some of my all time favorite flavors. It's also important to note that you can't get more than one flavor per serving. My guess is this is due to a quantity thing. Again, no biggie. I asked if the Brown Sugar Caramel would be a good pairing, and the cashier said that a lot of people were getting the recommendation pairings. I did not even see this part of the menu, because honestly the menu was not that easy to read. Black font on gray background... why!? Oh, another design note - having the cashier on the right side of the shop felt odd to me. Ok, so besides these not so big design woes, let's get back to the flavors. \n\nThe Brown Sugar Caramel was a good choice for topping, and I enjoyed it, however the flavor was a bit subtle. As for the ice cream, what I wanted to be a somewhat deconstructed taste on my palette - meaning hints of blueberry and hints of lavender - was instead a weird melding of blueberry and lavender that didn't taste wonderful together. I was expecting chunks of blueberry and pops of lavender, not the blending I received, both flavor and texture wise. The blueberry tasted a little too sweet, and the lavender didn't hit me enough. I had to really search for the individual flavors on my tongue, which is not the experience I want when eating ice cream. The waffle bowl was delicious, but if I had not gotten the bowl, I don't think I would have even finished my two scoops.\n\nProps for the pops - the vegan options are Vegan pops - but there are more, delicious vegan ice cream options literally within a block.\n\nAs far as service, it was meh. It didn't seem like the cashier cared at all what I ordered, they were not very friendly, and wouldn't mind if I just walked away. I also didn't get the waffle bowl I ordered and had to ask for it. This wasn't a big deal, but it made the impression that the staff was a bit disorganized.\n\nI'm willing to give Smitten another try, perhaps at a different location, and perhaps once they've finely tuned their flavors.", "author": "Erin W."}

They also ran out of waffle bowls at 7:30pm on a weeknight, and the advertised seasonal flavour of the moment, was also not available. Honestly, they shouldn't advertise items on their menu if it's not going to be available.\nThe Tcho flavour, even though it contained 60% cocoa, did not have an intense chocolate flavour. The Early grey and choc chip ice cream had a hint of bergamot and tea flavour, but it was too subtle and overpowered by sweetness.  The waffle cone also was like eating a pound of sugar.

For starters, the pricing here is choking bananas. A small (2 scoops) of their seasonal flavors will run you $7.00. But, I will say, the Lemon Gingersnap was pretty good. In addition to my Lemon Gingersnap I ordered a Classic Vanilla that explicitly states on the menu that it comes with strawberry prosecco sauce and all-natural rainbow sprinkles. After waiting roughly 10 mins the guy hands me a plain vanilla with no toppings. I asked him for sprinkles and he responds \"WHAT? you want sprinkles?\" and he begrudgingly sprinkles them on. Then, I had to ask for the strawberry sauce. Seriously, there's only like 6 different flavors on your menu, make an effort to memorize them.

The extra cost would've been fine, but the ice cream this time was disappointing. It was very fluffy but not that creamy, and the strawberry flavor tasted more generic than expected, and it was difficult to tell where the buttermilk came in.
