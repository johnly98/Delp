It's a classic bar with good ambience and friendly service. They also have a huge wine cellar with a decent selection of wine, the last thing you would expect in a bar like this :-) \n\nIt's open late and the bar is nothing super special on the inside. It's just a classic American bar with a huge selection of spirits and a fairly extensive cocktail menu. The patrons seem like regulars and the ladies serving here seem like they have also been here for ages. The owner is also around from time to time and chatting with guests. \n\nI liked it enough to come back here three times during my week stay here. It's reasonably priced for this town and the cocktails I had were good.", "author": "Sam S."}

Sam's Cable Car Lounge was really the only bar that opened early-ish on a Sunday (11:30) so I stopped in for a beer. The location is great, right on the path of the cable cars going to and from the turnaround. The bar itself was super hip with a variety of cocktails available and a cigar shop in the corner. I ordered a Peroni and was served a small bowl of peanuts to snack on. It certainly wasn't the cheapest beer I had in San Francisco but the view was nice and the beer was refreshing. Their bathroom area is cute, the ceilings were very low it made me feel like I was walking into a fun house. Looks like they have a downstairs wine cellar too. I could definitely see myself hanging out here again if I'm in town. \n\nTip: If you're looking to ride the cable cars get a ticket from the separate booth and be prepared to stand in line on a Sunday. I think I was looking at an hour wait and decided to walk instead. I would have jumped on some of the further stops but the cable car was moving so much slower than I could walk (even uphill) that it wasn't worth it.", "author": "Emily B."}

And it's insanely expensive. Like I've lived in SF for 3 years and this is the most expensive bar I've been to and I didn't expect it for a second. And it's not a 5 star hotel or a cocktail lounge. It's just a tourist bar. I got a glass - not even a pint- of peroni beer and it was 13.99. No joke! They add a service charge to the drinks which isn't clear and still leave space on the receipt for a tip. I thought it was a mistake but no- it was that expensive. I asked the bar tender was it a mistake and they said no- this place is just that expensive. The menu price was 875 for just a bud light and that was before he service charge too. \n\nI've written a paragraph about how expensive this place is so I'll move onto other things.

Wanting to grab a drink together, we wandered around downtown only to find every place packed. We eventually settled on Sam's Cable Car Lounge as another friend suggested it. We arrived on Thursday, February 16th around 6:30pm. It wasn't packed at all, so we easily grabbed two seats at the bar. The friend that suggested this place joined us a little later and was able to grab a seat next to us.\n\n*Bulleit Bourbon on the rocks ($9.75)\n*Old Fashioned ($8.75) x2, one with Bulleit Rye (+$2), one with Maker's Mark (+$2)\n*Cable Car Nachos: tortilla chips, cheddar cheese sauce and sliced jalapenos ($9.95)\n\nI got the Bulleit Bourbon on the rocks, though I do believe I asked for Rye. Not a big deal in the end. I just wanted something to sip on. I didn't taste the Old Fashioneds, but everyone seemed to enjoy their cocktails. The nachos were on the larger size, but for just chips, cheese and jalapenos, I thought they were pricey at almost $10. They do give you complimentary popcorn and peanuts though.\n\nSam's has a happy hour Monday through Friday, 2pm to 6pm. Draft beers and Well drinks are $6.50 while House wines are $7.50. Not the best HH pricing in general, but considering their beers are $8.25-$10.75, it is still a decent discount. Overall, due to the location, I felt this place was kind of a tourist trap. And pricey. Cocktails averaged $14-$15.\n\nI got to check another place off my list of bookmarks, but I wasn't really impressed with their drinks and food. One saving grace, I did see a case of cigars on the way out. I do love smoking a cigar while drinking some scotch or whiskey. There is a chance I might be back for that.", "author": "Elena N."}

I was headed up to Union Square to meet an out-of-town friend for lunch. As I walked up Powell St., I saw this place and was intrigued. So much so that I stopped, walked back to the front of the building, and poked my head in. Cool place -- I need to try it out sometime. \n\nAs my friend and I were talking at lunch, she mentioned that somewhere around this area is a bar that her husband really enjoys frequenting when he is in San Francisco for work. She had been with him before and said it's a really neat place and then she told me the name. I was so shocked that in a city so large, she said the ONE bar/lounge name that I knew, and had only JUST learned. I told her it was right around the corner, and after lunch, we went there. \n\nThe male and female bartenders (I didn't get names...yikes!) were both VERY welcoming and friendly. We ordered our drinks and when they arrived in a very timely manner, the bartender realized she had made me the wrong drink, and I was welcome to keep that one at no charge. Score! She made the correct drink while the gentleman got us popcorn, peanuts, and cheese. How nice!\n\nWe had a great time talking to the bartenders...mostly the guy...and he was really funny, but in a genuine way. \n\nAs far as the 22% gratuity goes, I do agree that it's a little steep, but you get what you are charged for. They completely catered to us and made us feel like we were the only two in there. They were very quick and efficient, and we did get all the little bar snacks. I can't say they didn't earn that money, because they did. And it says on your bill/check//receipt that you may ask to have the automatic gratuity charge removed, so no one should have an issue with it. \n\nI highly recommend this place to everyone.", "author": "Greg C."}

He tipped on top of that.  Later, I found out that they add a 22% service charge on each drink, but they don't inform customers that this 22% Tip is already added to the price of their drink. So my friend ended up tipping double.  I ordered a well vodka drink. It ended up being $9 after tax and the service charge. It was very weak. Since the bar is located only one half block away from Union Square, I am not surprised of the inflated prices. But I feel that charging a 22% service charge, and not letting people know about it is highly deceptive and unethical. I will not go back to this bar again.", "author": "Suzanne E."}

I know we are the most expensive city in the US.  But when I stopped in this bar for the first time yesterday afternoon and ordered a Blue Moon (domestic beer), I was shocked when the bartender said \"That will be $10.29.\"\n\nNow this place isn't the Top of the Mark nor the Palace Hotel.  It's a quaint little bar with a few TV's; a nice place to drink I'm sure, but nothing that warrants that price.  I asked the bartender about it, because I thought it must be a mistake, but she assured me that was the price and after all, \"this is San Francisco.\"  Well yes, this is near Union Square, and they probably get lots of tourists who they like to overcharge, so I paid $13 in cash, (I included a tip, because the price wasn't the bartender's fault, right?) and enjoyed my beer.  \n\nI didn't get really upset until . . . \n\nMy friend order a drink and paid by credit card.  When they brought her the check it included a 22% service charge.  No really, you read that correctly.  They automatically included a 22% tip without her permission.  \n\nNow let's forget the fact that including a tip is immoral and probably illegal.  If your service people aren't making enough in tips there's a problem, and if you want to compensate them start paying them more.\n\nAnd let's forget the fact that it's 22%, which is a few points higher than the 20% that is typical for bars.\n\nLet's go straight to the fact that when they charged me $10.29 for the beer, the bartender never told me service was included, not even when I mentioned how high the charge was, even after I tipped her another $2.71 which now it turns out equates to almost 30%.\n\nI suspect this is illegal.  It's certainly immoral.  So yes Sam's Cable Car, you have not only lost my business, but earned a nice warning to tourists and locals.  Avoid this place.  There are plenty of places in the area to enjoy a nice drink with fair and transparent prices.", "author": "Glenn M."}

First they ask for my ID and almost reject me and look at me skeptically because they think it's fake (maybe I look very young? But I can guarantee it's a real drivers license) and then the bartender asked one of his co workers about my ID and it ended up being fine. I wasn't too offended from that and still decided to stay, then I order my drink which lists at $8.75 for a \"sex on the beach.\" After I received the bill I noticed it came out to $11.92..... wait what? I then read the bottom of the receipt and it says that they charge a whopping 22% service charge (which is optional but there were no signs that indicated anything about the service charge) plus tax on top on that. I didn't mind paying it but it discourages tipping extra and is a bit sneaky since the drink menu didn't include there would be an extra service charge..", "author": "Chelsea T."}

We stopped by in early afternoon and there were not too many people inside. The drinks were strong and flavorful. They give you complimentary peanuts and small popcorn bag while you are there. I think they should do something like give free snacks for the price of the drinks. $39 for two drinks (two flavored martinis). \nMaybe later in the evenings this place will draw more of a crowd.", "author": "Steven H."}

This isn't a TAKE OUT establishment! \nI stopped in during the World Cup to meet a friend, and was immediately approached by a waitress regarding my drink order, when I told her I was waiting for a friend to join me within a few minutes, she insisted I needed to order right away or she would 'get in trouble'... WTF? I asked her if she was serious, and ordered an IPA. Got my beer and my friend showed up a second later, I told her of the high pressure sale. We decided right then and there to move on to a friendlier better value establishment! Got my check and then noticed the 18% SERVICE CHARGE (REALLY??)  plus tax and the SF healthcare mandate made my one high pressure beer more expensive and LESS PLEASANT than it should have been! :(    I understand this is tourist central and that NOT all cultures TIP, but TIPS are NOT COMPULSORY in SF or THE USA! I'm considered a generous and empathetic tipper when service is good/friendly, and think it WRONG to charge FOR SERVICE THAT SHOULD BE PROVIDED / INCLUDED in a dining and drinking establishment!! \nIf you have deep pockets (or your dumb) you may find this place quite adequate, otherwise move on... you have plenty of options and vote with your money supporting those businesses that EARN your MONEY!!!\nYou might also notice that many of the HIGH RATED REVIEWS aren't from Yelp Elites or the more active and serious Yelpers!!!\nCHEERS!", "author": "Sean M."}

My boyfriend an I stumbled upon it on our trip to San Francisco as thirsty tourists walking thru union  square. I came in, and I immediately noticed 18% charge for all orders. I'm glad I noticed and asked what it was, with so many tourists from all over the world, many times the bartenders would not get tipped. We all know that bartenders work solely on tips, which is the reason for that rule. 4 stars because if you don't notice that, it is likely you'll tip on top of that. \n\nWe came in during 'happy hour' 11-7pm which meant $4.50 drafts, descent for SF, and where I'm from. We stayed here for a few beers, and even had the opportunity to meet the owner, which was pretty cool! He was personable and friendly and talked to us about the other restaurants he owned.

But when each drink is over $18 and then a mandatory 18% service charge AND some other mandatory charge of 4%....that's where I draw the line.  When you read reviews that say $79 for \"a shot\" and \"we had a few shots\" then you know this isnt even for your average well paid professional...this is for people who are making so much they dont care.  I cannot speak to the tastiness of the cocktails as I walked out.  I have read one of the responses the bar made to a patron, and it was quite rude!!  They wouldnt let the guy watch the last 15 mins of a basketball game without ordering a drink and they were RUDE about it.  I despise paying money to a business that is both RUDE and so horrendously overpriced that its offensive.  \nOh, and Me (40 years old) and my mother (64 years old) were carded before we were allowed to walk in.

I ordered a cable car martini, which was ok.. it tasted exactly like grape kool-ade. One friend ordered a margarita, when it came it looked like foggy water with a lime! My sister ordered a gin gimlet, and when she got it they didn't strain it so it was full of mint and cucumber floaties. My last friend ordered a lemon drop, which she said tasted like cheap vodka.\n\nWell we drank everything anyways and when the bill was left at our table we saw that they add on their own SF tax, a service tax, and regular tax!!! $62 for the 4 of us, not even worth it in my opinion! \n\nSo if the ONLY reason ur going is for the free hot popcorn and peanuts, then great!

He is a character and made our day!! We live in SF and yes this is a touristy place and yes the drinks are not happy hour prices but what do you expect people when you are at ground zero for the main tourist area in SF?! Yes there is a gratuity included for the drinks but that is only due to the foreign tourists who don't tip and who are not from tipping cultures. How do you expect to keep a staff when they rely solely on their tips? \n\nThis place has amazing service and I credit that to Sam, the owner, who seems very hands on with his businesses. Since living in SF for the last three years we never expected to stumble upon a place on Powell where we could meet a true SF character, but we did. We will be returning very soon. If you are so lucky to land in this bar while Sam is there, you have hit the jackpot my friends. He has pearls of wisdom to share about relationships, business and life in general. You may not be smarter, but you will be a better person from the exchange. Pay the gratuity and enjoy your $12 drink. It is worth it.", "author": "Shannon K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-24", "description": "When my friend told me about this place I was little skeptical; I mean it's in the middle of one of San Francisco's tourist areas. So I walk into the place and the wall behind the bar has a Cable Car replica  on it as if it's coming out of the wall. Hey, what do you expect? The place IS called Sam's Cable Car Lounge and the Powell Cable Car line is right outside.  So, it's appropriate for this bar in this tourist hot spot.\n\nThe clientele?\nMostly tourist, but overall friendly. I've had conversations with people from England, Ireland, Denmark, Germany, Australia, Japan, So. Cal, and even locals; and I don't necessarily consider myself to be very outgoing.\n\nThe staff?\nAlways friendly. Sure, there may be times where it may take a while for them to get to you, but in my experience it's rare. The bartenders are among the friendliest I've seen.\n\nJack is a manager here who's friendly and genuinely cares about his patrons. If you've got a problem, I'm sure he'll do what he can to try to make it right.\n\nOn occassion you'll see Sam, the owner.  He's an Interesting, friendly, older gentleman who really enjoys the music he plays here, which is for the most part good even if some selections are a bit dated.  He also chats it up with patrons.\n\nDrinks/food?\nMost of the night they're serving up complimentary snacks of popcorn, peanuts, chips and salsa, and or salami and cheese.\n\nThe few cocktails I've had have been pretty good, but I haven't been drinking a lot of cocktails for a while to give any great feedback in this area.\n\nThey have a decent imported beer selection, but it's not your run of the mill import that you'll find at many other places. And the prices for these beers are considerably higher than what a Bud drinker would expect. But if you appreciate good beer, their a safe bet, except the Beer With Me. I've had every beer here and the Beer With Me is by far the worst I've had anywhere.\n\nTheir draft beers are a slightly higher than some other bars, but it's in a tourist area, so I'm not really surprised.\n\nTheir hard liquor selection is pretty good as well. I've had a few drinks here that I haven't seen elsewhere such as Belvedere Intense, quite possibly the smoothest vodka I've had. Some of the liquors are priced about the same as other places and others are priced considerably higher. My best recommendation here is to know your liquor.\n\nThey've also got a wine cellar here, though I haven't had any of their wine.\n\nEntertainment?\nThere's usually a game on at least 1 of the 3 big screen TVs they have there and there's live music Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nLastly, the reason why just about everyone on yelp has given this place a bad review: they automatically charge 18% gratuity no matter the order or number in your group.  In their defense, the bar is in a tourist area that draws in tourist from places where it isn't customary to tip, 2) it's in big letters on their menu that they have this policy and I'm pretty sure I've seen at least 1 sign for it as well, and 3) most of the time the bartenders will tell you that gratuity has been added when they bring you your bill so you don't accidentally double tip.  Granted, I've seen times where they haven't warned a patron, but from what I seen they warn them more often than not.", "author": "Dennis Z."}

Jack and Sam were engaging and welcoming and just plain fun.  \n\nWe left for dinner, then returned later instead of going to one of the clubs we had planned to go to since we were so impressed earlier in the day. Sam and Jack welcomed us back, with Jack making our favorite drink and making sure the other bartenders knew how to make it too.   We loved those guys!!\n\nThere was a band playing and a fun crowd.

However,\nafter hitting traffic and searching for parking for what seemed like forever, once\nin Macy's,  we just wanted out.  Much to my relief Sam's Cable Car was near the\nexit.  We were greeted by the bartender Thomas, his service was excellent!  The best rasberry lemon drop martinis ever!  Perfectly shaken with the tiny pieces of ice just as\nI like.  Sam and Charlie were also great and made us feel at home.  The music was a blast to listen to, often sparking up great conversation..  All in all, Sams Cable Car rescued us from what would've  been just a horrendous day of traffic, pedestrians, tight spaces and never ending escalators.  \n\nThank you!!! \n\nI would definitely recommend stopping in.", "author": "Victoriana A."}

The atmosphere was ok, plenty of patrons hanging out. The drinks are pretty pricey but I suppose that's to be expected in a busy tourist area. What will ensure that I will NEVER return was how rude the OWNER treated us. My friend had a walking cast on and was resting her foot on a chair. The owner asked her to take her foot off his chair (the chair was not cloth and could easily be wiped off plus it was just her leg resting on the chair and not the bottom of her cast). The way he spoke to us was not called for and it was not a polite request. We quickly finished our drinks and paid our tab. We will not be returning to this place!!!!", "author": "Risha G."}

He even sat with us to get to know us!!! We had dinner reservations so we had to leave but he suggested we come back because they have a DJ and dancing in the evening. We came back after dinner and WOW. what a great time we had, the DJ was awesome and the tunes were GREAT!!! I highly recommend this place if you are visiting the city.

They were having a happy hour so we decided to stop in and get a quick drink. It is located directly off the cable car line (cable car drives in front of the restaurant). When we were seated at the bar we were met by a respectful and warm staff. They sat us quickly and gave us their undivided attention. After allowing us to sample some local beers, they served us with a smile on their face. It was at this point when we were approached by the owner Sam. Sam is an individual who cares about his employees and even more so about his customers. He had a genuine conversation about his life adventures and showed great interest in our journey as well. He generously provided us with his very own wine and cheese to try! It's a great place unwind and have great conversation!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-08-12", "description": "We were really hungry having just arrived mid afternoon in San Francisco and happened across this place. The staff are very friendly, the Bloody Mary was very good and I had beer. Prices are what I would expect to pay for the area. The music was like a random selection of CDs from a yard sale. Michael Jackson came on a couple times at least. Probably some better choices for mid day at a sports bar. I hope the owner will take my advice on the food. It's almost like it was an after thought and random stuff was chosen to include. We had a combination pizza. It certainly wasn't fresh made and my guess is that at some point in its sorry life it was frozen. You could tell that it was a pepperoni pizza originally and additional toppings were added. It was actually just beyond warm in the middle and a little cool in spots. Definitely frozen pie. Making dough is so easy and using fresh ingredients is probably cheaper than the pie we had. Make dough in bulk and use it fresh throughout the day. Try 1/2 cup 130 degree water, 4 tablespoons olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon sugar, 3/4 teaspoon yeast. Dissolve in the hot water and mix in 1 cup flour. Now add flour a bit at a time while kneading until it's no longer sticky. Coat with olive oil and let rise an hour or two. Roll into a thin circle about 14\" across and add fresh toppings. Cook until done. So easy and so much better than frozen. I like to cook the dough after rolling it out and before topping it for about 4 minutes. Use a dough docker so it doesn't all puff up. We were going to get nachos but it was suggested that we don't. I'm guessing it was a plate of chips with melted cheese product on it. Go for the drinks if you don't mind paying big city prices but not for the food. At least not until they fix the menu and work on having the best damn bar pizza in town.", "author": "Greg B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-14", "description": "I was referred to this place from a friend. On the first visit, I immediately became impressed by the cool signage in front, and it being ground level for my tired feet. It's right in the middle of grand central Union Square, where shopping, eating and fun times abound. The place was what I EXPECT from places I frequent: clean, trendy, stylish, touristy, intimate and classy at the same time. HAPPY HOUR IS AWESOME! Beer for $4.50! And to top it off, their hard liquor drinks are delicious and worth the slightly higher price. Their \"Cable Car Cosmo\" specialty drink hit the spot with a nice buzz AND great taste. The background music was a decent level and trendy. The tourists that came in were happy to spend money and relax in a prime spot of San Francisco. I had just missed one of the team mates of the Giants, who came in and shared a rather spendy bottle of wine with his friends. That's right, not only do they sell beer and hard drinks, but the owners wine collection is expansive and elegant. I was very impressed. \n  I see other reviews complaining about the prices, but to be honest, THIS IS UNION SQUARE, SAN FRANCISCO! \n I also see people upset about the automatic gratuity added....I don't see a problem with it. This is standard, to tip the people who serve you. People are cheapskates when they don't tip. Call me old fashioned. I believe in supporting  the businesses that serve me and offer a classy place to hang. 18% is less than standard. And most of the foreign tourists DON'T KNOW THIS. Yet, it the tourists that mostly frequent this establishment. It's called BUSINESS. Right? \n  Another great thing I noticed (with the several visits I made to this place)\nwas that the owner is there a LOT, and he really cares about what his customers think. It is not unusual to see him walk up and personally check each customer to make sure they are getting what they need. I watched as the owner proceeded to get to know a couple that was seated beside me, and he bought them each a couple drinks and talked with them awhile. The guy is very people friendly. \n  The bartenders, hosts and door man are all very friendly and it is obvious they love their job. They do it well. \n  This place caters to the tourists very well, but is also a hot spot for the locals to come in and enjoy happy hour and relaxation in a classy environment. This is no hole-in -the-wall dive. You get what you pay for people. You want class? Get out there and get it. You'll find it here. Not kidding. \n  In talking with the owner on one of my visits, I found out he is also gearing up for live music in his place every weekend. This will be a big bonus, as it will go into the wee hour of morning for all of us late night flowers. :)\nA perfect spot for parties to hang out after an event.    I say YES!

When we paid with a debit card there was a section on the receipt that said \"tip\" So if you're from out of town and aren't too familiar with our tipping customs you might just pay even more money for mediocre (at best)  food and drinks.  We had 4 cocktails for a grand total of $77.  That is not normal at all.  In fact it's downright offensive.  My wife and I are actually ashamed that we came into this place.

The cocktails were tasty, not too strong which is good if you plan on dancing for the rest of the night! The rest of the staff was very friendly too! I would recommend you guys to any friends who are thirsty and looking for somewhere to practice their dance moves! ;D", "author": "Mz. Social B."}

But then it got better with the owner doing what he did and the manager was awesome and very friendly.  And as others say , it was not expensive.  It really isnt. Its a fair price.  San Francisco tax is higher than what we used to so I would recommend this place to  tourist thumbs up. .", "author": "JJ F."}

Turns out this Lounge just opened less then a month ago. Was originally a Wine Store. Great Decor with a Cable Car coming out of the Wall overlooking the Bar. An impression the the Golden Gate Bridge on another wall. A miniature replica of major scenic attractions of San Francisco. T.V.'s strategically placed for the Sports Aficionado. The bar staff was Wonderful. They were courteous and very friendly.  Well versed in Spirits of your delight. Was lucky enough to meet Sam him self. He came right up to us and introduced himself. He treated us like family. He told us he just opened the lounge less then a month ago. He prides himself in making the customer happy. He designed the lounge for all. Having a live Pianist, Up Beat recorded music, a VIP Section over looking the bar Area with DJ for the more discreet (To be open within week or so of this writing), and finishing up a private lounge on the second floor that will be available for private parties. Did I say wine. Yes, large selection of wine to order. Lower end and for those who can afford. I definitely plan on going back.", "author": "J G."}
