It doesn't look like much as its set up out of a trailer but the crepes are delicious. They have savory and sweet options. I tried a bit of both. Got a strawberry and chocolate sweet crepe and a beef and cheese savory crepe. The crepe itself is made hot and fresh to order. The strawberry and chocolate goes really well with the thin and crispy crepe and tastes even better with whipped cream. The savory beef and cheese was soooo good, its like a large soft taco. Pretty much ground beef and cheese wrapped in the the prefect warm crispy crepe. FYI this place is cash only so hit up an ATM before.", "author": "Peter P."}

Are you ready? Here we go.\n\n1. Be mentally prepared for the overwhelming number of options. They serve all combinations of sweet and savory ingredients known to mankind. If the exact concoction you want isn't explicitly listed on the menu, just let them know and they'll hook you up.\n\n2. Counting calories is strictly prohibited. Don't deprive yourself of the crepe that your heart most deeply desires. It'll be so worth it. Besides, I'm pretty sure all foods become calorie-free after midnight.\n\n3. Your BAC level must exceed a certain threshold to enjoy the full experience. Everyone here comes to satisfy their drunchies after a night out in SoMa. Folks are socializing while waiting in line and hanging out by the couches. Remember, it's no fun being the only one on sober patrol.\n\n4. Fear not the sketchy alleyway. The truck itself is located in the shadiest back street off of 11th. You might have considered showing up armed with an AK47, but just do some bicep curls beforehand. Bigger arms will make you look more intimidating, which should suffice.\n\n5. It's cash only, but you probably already knew that.", "author": "Miko B."}

I felt like the workers were high or something, because they couldn't seem to get anything right. \n\nMy friend repeated his order several times and they still got it wrong. Since he's vegetarian he definitely didn't order meat in his crepe, but somehow they put ham in there.

Eventually my friend got a crepe he could eat.\n\nAs for me, all I wanted was a ton of fruit, so I asked if they could make just a cup of blueberries, strawberries, bananas, and apples. They said they didn't have cups but could put fruit in a crepe. Okay, fine. I was told ran out of blueberries but could add kiwi. Okay, fine. I was able to get a decent amount of refreshing delicious fruit in a crepe, but was WAY overcharged. I didn't realize until much later the amount we had paid for it. $12.50?!?

Very convenient for those who are drunk/buzzed after a fun night.\n\nI actually came for dessert since I had dinner nearby. I got the King Lias crepe and I added strawberries. The crepe itself is $7, reasonable, but adding strawberries was an additional $2.50. I honestly had no idea extra strawberries were so expensive or else I wouldn't have gotten it. I couldn't find a price for additional toppings on their menu. The king lias crepe was delicious with an awesome medley of flavors and textures. The only thing I didn't like is that they make their crepes on the softer side, it had no crunch to it. And the fact that my delicious crepe was $10. It was delicious but not $10's worth in my opinion. I also like to have ice cream in my crepes which they don't offer.\n\nCash Only.\n\nThis wouldn't be my first choice for crepes, but if I was nearby I would not mind stopping by to get a crepe.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

(I'm just going to have to pray it was a sugamama sort of arrangement and know it has no bearing on my value in life.) \n\nBut one thing that at least somewhat eases my consternation is the fact that he introduced me to the Crepes A Go Go truck. Disgustingly drunk, a sloppy mess, at an unholy and ghastly hour in what can only be described as a semi-somnambulant stupor, I have made my way to this truck by hook or by crook and never been disappointed. (I only wish I could say the same of our love affair.) I always went for the avocado, sun-dried tomato and Jack cheese and would practically cry tears of joy every time my order was called and I (or some other, more sober member of our party) would reach up to retrieve the lil' foiled and folded bundle of joy. That is so much better than any newborn I will ever reach for after hours of grueling and intensive labor. Plus in this situation, I get to eat--whereas in childbirth, only the babe does.\n\nI'm sure they don't appreciate it whenever I encourage my designated driver to double park, flip on those hazards and essentially bump NWA so that I can jump out and get my order started as quickly as possible, but I think almost anyone can be bought with a hefty tip and what I hope was a really dapper wink but probably looked like a mild seizure to the person I was giving it to. No matter, at least I got what I came for. \n\nI prefer the savory crepes here because I'm just a savory type of gyal but the sweet crepes are divine too! I just happen to be the type of lady that stays loyal and true once she finds something she likes--unlike my ex. But thanks for the restaurant recommendation!", "author": "Gabrielle T."}

My favorite post DNA clubbing location is the pizza right there! After discovering this location today, I have to say there is definitely competition. My bf and I were craving crepes and desserts after dinner so I found this place on Yelp. My bf was hesitant to try since he thought this was the same name as a chain in Berkeley. Then he looked at the picture and realized it was a cart. We then drove here and tried it out. They have a few tables and chairs to relax and sit. We got there and the menu was easy to read- divided into sweet vs savory. On the cart there was also a quick menu of popular savory item. I wanted to try the king Lias which is the \"sweetest crepe\" it has banana, Nutella, almost powder, coconut, sweet cream and sauce. The total was 7.50 without tax. My bf and I did not know that this was a cash only location so we barely had 8 dollars. On top of the the doesn't like coconut either. We then decided to order just banana with Nutella and whip cream. Unlike most locations, the crepes here are pre made, and the person working there simply heats it up which still came out very tasty. Anyways we got the crepe with banana and Nutella plus some cream and it was AMAZING! I highly recommend coming here. Although I think 5.50 for a crepe with Nutella and banana is a bit pricey- given that trader joes sell 10 cent bananas. But hey he needs to pay rent and for the business", "author": "Amy Y."}

The scallions were fresh and firm, riccotta was good, the beef wasn't anything to write home about but with fresh jalapeno's wrapped in a hot crepe it was worth the 9 bucks.

Then I changed into less stressful attire and we headed off to a bar where I broke my personal record for most jello shots in a given night (previously set at 1) and had an alcoholic beverage that involved Tang, before heading out to try and catch a cab in the rain, while creepy Cheetara make-up ran down my face. \n\nA hopeless case in a hopeless place I was. \n \nUntil.... \nA Crepes A Go Go (by way of Steph Y's suggestion) saved my life.\n\nIt took all of a minute and 15 secs to get a big ole floppy crepe up in my face, and after that, we didn't even make it back to the street before the two of us had torn that ish up like mongrels and agreed that it was far more important that we go back and eat a second crepe than catch a cab back home. #WorthIt\n\nI found love in a hopeless place.

Not I! \n\nOnce you've tried and loved it, it's hard to stray from the classic Nutella-banana sweet crepe base. To mix it up a little, sometimes we add cinnamon and strawberries or coconut. Everything has turned out delicious, and while the credit may largely be due to the Nutella, Crepes-a-Go-Go makes a darn good crepe base and matches your Nutella with just the right amount of complementary toppings. They don't match up to the gourmet crepes I've tried in other cities near and far but they're certainly a great & easy choice for under $10!\n\nWe have yet to try the savory crepes at this location, but many in my company have tried it and devoured it with the passion of a starved wildebeest. Looked good to me!", "author": "Asha S."}

Beside it taking almost 45 minutes for my crepes With 1 person in front of me. I paid for a banana nutella crepe..wit whip. I didn't taste a banana til about 3/4 of the way and by that time there was no whip left..so there was just a overwhelming amount of nutella at the bottom. I ordered the same thing from crepe temptations on Judah at it was excellent. The whipcream was evenly distributed with banana and nutella so you don't miss Anything in a bite.

Avocados are HIGH in insoluble fiber (75%), so it will all come out any ways. TMI, I know...so just add avocados to your crepes and the calories will be out by the morning; NO guilt!!! Yes, I have a justification and/or excuse for everything. :X\n\nSome of my gfs have been raving about Crepes A Go-Go for some time and I finally got to see what the hype was all about a month ago. And, I've since been here twice after stumbling out of The Cow on Friday AM.\n\nCrepes A Go-Go is located across from Slim's and right past Paradise Lounge, MIST, and Butter and is perfect for a late night snack since it closes at 3 AM.\n\n1st visit: Smoked Turkey w/ Provolone and Avocados - OMFG! I'm normally NOT a fan of savory crepes, but Crepes A Go Go has since converted me. Either that, or the 6+ shots of GG clouded my judgment. :X The crepe is delicately cooked producing crispy corners and a soft/fluffy center. It's generously filled with thick deli-sliced smoked turkey, cheese, and chunky slices of buttery avocado. The turkey is tender and the creamy provolone has some burnt edges which adds a great creamy, savory crunch. And, the best part is the uber-ripened avocados which is so buttery it just melts in your mouth. The crepe is a perfect balance of textures and flavors; crisp, soft, savory, salty, creamy, and buttery. \n\n2nd visit: Spinach w/ Provolone and Avocados: It was just ok. In attempt to make a more \"healthier\" choice, I just ended up a bit disappointed. The crepe was cooked perfectly; crisp, yet soft. However, I expected the spinach to be cooked. Rather, the crepe was stuffed with huge raw spinach leaves. I'm a carnivore, not a herbivore, so with each bite, I took a leaf with me which made me look as if I went grazing on the field. \n\nThere's ketchup, siracha, and generic tabasco sauce to the left on the truck that you can pour on your crepe to your heart's desire.  \n\nPRICE (cash only):\n*Sweet Crepes (15+ varieties): Starts at $2.50 (Butter & sugar) - $6.00 (King Llas w/ nutella, banana, almond powder, coconut & whipped cream).\n\n*Savory Crepes (15+ varieties): Starts at $3.50 (Cheese) to $6.50 (Saut\u00e9ed chicken, cheese bell peppers, onions, and garlic).\n\nCheese Choices: Swiss, cheddar, moneterey jack, and ricotta.\n\nExtras ($.75-$1.50): Nutella, jams, spreads, sauces, eggs, avocados, caramelized onions, mushrooms, etc.\n\nSERVICE:\nOrder with the cashier and wait for your order to be called. There are only two people working, the cashier and the cook and they crank these bad-boys out like an assembly line; very fast and efficient. It normally takes no more than 5 minutes for your order. \n\nSEATING:\nThere are about 5 or so lawn chairs against the wall to the right of the truck. If you want to sit, make sure to go snag some seat(s) while your friend(s) order. Otherwise, there's ample standing room. \n\nCROWD: \nDrunks, drunks, and MORE drunks...esp during peak hours after 1 AM.

And I'm not talking about in general--that's a given.  I'm talking about just in one night.  \n\nExample 1: I came here with friends for a quick dinner before heading to WISH.  A couple hours of later, we made our way next door to Holy Cow, but we were the very first ones inside, so we decided to pass some time by noshing on some sweet crepes from Crepes a Go-Go.  But I guess I just didn't have enough of them, because we made one last stop at Crepes a Go-Go before calling it a night!\n\nExample 2: After a satisfying sushi boat dinner, the SO and I came here for a post-dinner treat.  We were talking about having a dessert crepe the entire way there, but once we got here, we couldn't resist the delicious House Special.  Fast forward 4 hours later after a night at Swig, we brought our friend here and we finally had that sweet crepe we were talking about!\n\nSo, case in point: Crepes a Go-Go is addicting, delicious, and so worth going to multiple times in a night.  \n\nEveryone who's in the know knows that the House Special (2 eggs, smoke turkey slices and cheddar cheese) is \"DA BOMB\" (I swear I've heard this over 10 times since I've been here).  Ask them to add hot sauce -- you can choose from Sriracha, Tapatio, and Tabasco -- and it makes the crepe even more mind-blowing.  My favorite sweet crepe is the banana, nutella and almond powder.\n\nThe guys working the crepe truck have great memories and are super efficient with taking down orders and cooking the crepes.  The crepes are pre-made which make the wait go a bit faster.  \n\nCheap and delicious crepes from a permanent roach coach...this is what  I call a San Francisco treat!", "author": "Diane L."}

Donair? Sure. Subs? Absolutely. Thin, sweet, French pancakes wrapped about savoury ingredients ranging from cheese and ham to apple and cinnamon? Well no. That's just not something I go to when I've been out on the town and am wholly focused on retroactively avoiding a hangover. But after three hours of dancing at a Bootie SF party, my thighs just didn't have it in me to be picky. If crepes are right across the street, we're eating crepes.\n\nThe line-up was long but moved really fast - almost too fast when you consider just how much reading is involved with their menu. There are two categories of crepes - Savoury and Sweet - with well over a dozen varieties each. I went with the cheddar, egg and spinach combo that was way more flavourful than I expected. Quite frankly, Ben needed some alone time with his crepe and I'm not shy to admit it. And at about less than $4 a pop, these treats have forever earned a wildcard spot in my late-night menu.", "author": "Ben B."}

I run club nights at a venue a couple buildings away, and this is perfect for a snack at 3am.  The crepes themselves aren't heavy like some are here in SF, and i was totally sober. They are easy to eat by hand before, after or during one of the nearby clubs, and a healthier and yummier option than getting greasy pizza. Cash only, but there's an atm at the convenience store nearby. There's also a little outdoor seating, and the people who run it are friendly.

They were only 24, so they really didn't know any better.  The bouncer let me in because no toddler was actually going to order a Manhattan.  I obviously chose to nurse a Ginger Ale.  Around 1am, my mother got tired and decided we should all tramp onward back home.  That's when we passed Crepes A Go Go.  Since there was no Bernstein Bears novel to appease me, my folks decided a crepe filled with nutella and apple sauce might do the trick.  Did that ever put a smile on my face!\n\nOk, so all of that was a bunch of fantasy.  I did, however, recently stumble upon the magic of Crepes A Go Go.  I was taken here on my way to BART because my friend took pity on his roommate's dinner of Lean Cuisine.  I wasn't going to complain.  I chose the House Special: two eggs, lots of cheese, and turkey.  I will say this.  It was devoured in less than 15 seconds.  Or three minutes.  The details are fuzzy.

Oh my.  The crepes are just slightly spongy, but there should really be no resistance nor should the crepe tear when picked up.  Think of placing your teeth through very very thick cream....that's my kind of crepe.  Now imagine the delicate sweet starchiness of the Chestnut sandwiched with fresh slices of strawberries bursting in your mouth.  My other choice would be the pineapple, strawberries, Kirol, and a little Ricotta Cheese.  Like a fruit basket cake, but in a wrap form instead.    \n\nFrom the Savory side of the menu, I enjoy the tart and salty exchange of the Cheese, Smoked Turkey & Cranberry Sauce crepe.  As a French take on the so American dinner.  But this was slightly different in taste, as the cheese provided a smooth backdrop to the very smoky and tender pieces of turkey.  Add in the tart sweetness of the cranberries, and the crepe was just as rich as a croissant.....with less guilt.\n\nDecent crepes, perfect for snacks, brunch, late evening sweet fix!", "author": "Miika M."}

I'm not saying this will cure whatever adjective you fit best with the previous statement, but it's so damn tasty after a long night out.  So who knows, this place may taste better due to the circumstances of being out drinking and that it's past 2am, but I can't tell a difference.\n\nThe place is one of the more ghetto places around that I didn't realize this place even had a name besides \"the crepe place on folsom and 11th\" until I reminded myself one time that I should be more observant the next time I went so I can give it a proper Yelp review instead of writing \"Tis ish goood.\"  This restaurant, if you will, is basically a meals on wheels parked in this tiny vacant lot that looks like the entrance to a junkyard.  On the right hand side is a makeshift canopy and an old, dirty ass couch, which I've seen people sit on.  And above that is a small neon sign that says \"Crepes A Go Go\".\n\nThe French guy there isn't the nicest or the most courteous of people, but then again look at his customers, so I don't completely blame him.  Just one time I went, he barked at me saying that he called out my order 10 times, but I didn't want to talk back because I was salivating for 15 minutes.  The thing is he kept calling out an order that was similar to mine, but he kept saying one ingredient that I didn't have in mine and I only heard him call it out 5 times, not 10.\n\nBut after all that, I love what they make here.  I've always gotten the salty crepes and it's cooked to perfection.  There's enough variety here that you can come back plenty of times before trying everything.  I think it's customizable too, but I'd rather not deal with the confusion that it is there every night on weekends.  The hot crispiness of the crepe in combination with whatever topping you get with it is superb.  This is one reason why I like going to SOMA for going out just because of this place.

Or you can go dessert style and get a bananas and honey crepe, a ricotta and jam crepe, etc.  But where you really strike gold is the salty + the sugary.  I'm talking apples and cheddar cheese, or turkey and cranberry sauce - seriously people, these are the best things ever.  I know you're doubting the turkey and cranberry - don't doubt.  eat it.", "author": "Natalie S."}

So after about 5 minutes inside, I've managed to push, squeeze, and elbow my way about half way deep into the club.  Where I then witness  a group of underage or just turned 18 sheltered suburban kids dancing completely off beat on top of tables and chairs poorly trying to be sexy.  Followed immediately by 2 puking incidents about 10 feet from one another.  I then push, squeeze, and elbow my way back to the door and decide to spend the next 2 hours til the bus comes back elsewhere.  But this isn't about Loft 11... \n\nThe husband and I walked down the street a bit and there it was.  Our saving grace... crepes!  I had almost forgotten it was there.  In my drunken state, it was exactly what I needed.  Yummy crepes in the middle of the night served out of a lil dingy kitchen on wheels. Sweet or savory they have what you need.  There's a covered seating area where discarded couches find that prolonged use and love they so desperately seek.  As I was munching on my crepe, chillin on a comfy couch, we start talking to a couple friendly guys dressed in the preppiest clubbing gear I've seen in a long time.  But nice guys... especially nice since they shared a blunt with us.  My hour and a half spent on those used couches, munching on yummy crepes, meeting cool new people by far beat out anything I woulda experienced had I stayed in Loft 11.  My only gripe is I wish they had a couple space heaters in their couch tent.", "author": "Jasmine D."}

It's a good option in that you have plenty of types of fillings to stuff your face with and those comfy, disheveled couches to sit and digest. Disappointing in that their mediocre level, already prepared crepes come overloaded with a sickening amount of bottom-drawer cheese that'll definitely test your intestinal fortitude.
