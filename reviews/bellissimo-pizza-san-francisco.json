I ordered from their website, which uses a service called SimpleMenu. The order went through and I received an email confirmation. I went to the store to pick up my order, and they told that they did not have my order. The guy behind the counter asked for my order number. I gave him the order number, I showed him my email confirmation, and I even showed him that I was charged in my bank account in the bank app on my phone. He acted as though I was engaging in an elaborate plot to steal chicken wings from them. I asked him for the phone number of the service they use for their online orders or even a number for an owner or manager. He managed to give me the name of an alleged manage. \n \nThere were a number of customers around to witness my embarrassment when trying to explain to this genius behind the counter that I was charged even though they do not have my order. He looked at me with disdain multiple times and said that this has never happened. I half expected him to call the police on me for *them* stealing *my* money. \n \nOrder at your own risk. It might just be that they did not like my demographics and thus treated me like a criminal. If this happens to you, they might actually treat you differently. But what annoyed the most is that the guy behind the counter was extremely unhelpful in giving me *any* information on how I could resolve the problem. They earned this one star--I only wish I could give them a (well-deserved) negative rating after this experience.", "author": "Will V."}

It was a bit crowded and I ordered a slice of pesto. There was no pesto slice on the rack, so I figured I'd have to wait a bit for a fresh one, like I've done before. They decided to rush I suppose due to the crowd, and just grab an old cheese slice and cover it with some new cheese and pesto. It was hardly heated up enough and the cheese wasn't even melted on top, creating this gross consistency between the new barely melted and old stale cheese.

The pizza was just that good.\n\nFood: I got an x-large (16 inch) pizza both times I went. They only have small (12 inch) medium (14 inch), and x-large pizzas. I had the Tijuana and the California pizzas, both of which were incredible! Of the two, I would recommend the California because the pesto and spinach toppings worked so well together on that pizza.\n\nService: The service is not roadrunner fast. In fact, it's probably average at best, despite the fact that my friends and I were the only ones in the store for lunch. The worker was patient with us while we tried to decide what pizza and even asked us if we wanted to change pizzas after we had already paid. However, because we went to the store both times (despite the fact that delivery is free), we did not get to experience their delivery service.\n\nInterior: It is not spacious inside. There are a three round, tall tables with probably six chairs, and then you also had the option to sit along the wall, where there was another four chairs.\n\nPizza here is not the cheapest pizza in the world. I split the cost 4 ways and then 3 ways on my two visits here, respectively. On occasions when you're looking for some quality pizza, Bellissimo's is the place to go.", "author": "Jacob R."}

There's a handwritten sign on the front that says it closes at 2am. I went around 2am expecting it to be open (based on the Yelp review, I should have fact checked this, however) and sure enough, the door was open yet there was a huge line in front of us being turned away. One patron (possibly intoxicated, so take this with a grain of salt) said out loud how she had been waiting for twenty minutes (which would have been within the store's operating hours that day) only to be told the place was closed once it hit 2am. If that's the case, that's pretty bad. Again, there may be more to this circumstance, so I'm not saying this is the gospel. I was disappointed either way.

The guy that took my order was pleasant and got my order right (except for the delivery address) and told me it would take 20-25 minutes max for the delivery.  Here is what happened next:\n\n1. Delivery took 1 hour - I didn't get a call to notify me that they were running late\n\n2. The delivery guy went to a different address.  Not sure if the guy that took my order got the wrong address or what not, but ok fine I'll wait since it wasn't far from where I live\n\n3. Pizza finally came and when I asked the delivery guy how I can pay for the pizza, he gives me a blank stare and tells me that I should have paid over the phone.  UMM ok??! How is that my job to know how I should have paid if it wasn't communicated to me when I placed the order.  I tell him I'm paying via CC so he tells me to call back and speak to the guy that took my order.  I tell him to hold on so I can get cash for the tip and then call the place.  I go back into the house and came back with tip $, when I handed over the tip $, he says \"what's this?\"  I tell him that it's his tip money so he starts to demand that I call the guy that took my order in front of him.  I tell him that I would get my phone and call.  He pulls out his phone and tries to call the person that took my order then AGAIN demands that I give him my credit card now.  Are you F'ing serious?? No way that I'm going to hand over my credit card to you.  Apparently the guy on the other line hangs up on him so he tells me to call him instead.  At this point no apologies from the delivery guy on how they F'D up big time and that the delivery took 1 hour but tries to put the pressure and blame on me.  I don't think so buddy!!  So I explain to him that as a BUSINESS, customers come 1st!  If you don't have guidelines/process on how to take orders and take payment, I'm sorry to tell you that it's not my F'ing job to figure that shit out for you.\n\nMy mom finally got fed up and we ended up giving him cash for the order.  At this moment, he apologizes (*bullshit)\n\nNote to this business: If this is the way you treat your customers with blatant disrespect, you definitely won't get my business or my friends/family.

None of them was better than Domino's (or Little Ceasar's, Round Table, or the like)...in fact, I'd give each of those chain establishments a 3.5. So, if you don't like those, you'll be even more disappointed than I was by these locally owned pizza places. \n\nAll three rated only 3 stars, but each for different reasons. Bellissimo's slice went in the oven for a bit, but still came out a bit underwhelming. I'd read the review that said the dough/crust was \"spongy\", so I had pretty low expectations. I didn't find the dough to be spongy, but the bottom had a slightly crunchy texture...perhaps from going back in the oven, but unlike other reheated pizzas I've had. \n\nHowever, the cheese and toppings went closer to the edge, so not as much crust to deal with...and it tasted good enough.

I've ordered cheese pizza multiple times from Bellissimo, and they somehow have managed to make it taste completely different every time. A few weeks ago, I purchased a few cheese slices and they tasted great: different from all the other similarly priced pizza places around town (a bit crispier), but had a perfect balance of sauce and cheese. In my most recent order, the pizza had a strange texture and little to no sauce - I could hardly finish a slice because it made me gag. It was like eating layers of funky tasting cheese on a crust that was too thick to be thin-crust, but too thin to be a normal crust. Not doughy at all like pizzas from other pizza places. I can only compare it to the cafeteria pizza I was served in high school... yikes. Won't be ordering from here again.", "author": "Anna C."}

And to make matters worse,  my friends and I stopped here after being on a party bus for the afternoon and drunk food supposedly is always good.  Well, Bellissimo Pizza definitely contradicted that notion. \n\nAll I wanted was a hot, cheesy piece of pizza.  Instead I got a piece of cardboard with a sprinkle of cheese.  I ordered a slice from the available pizzas that just may have been sitting out all day.  I noticed that the cheese looked sparse, so I asked for extra cheese.  Even after asking for extra cheese, my end product boasted more more sauce then cheese!  Horrible.  The crust was like cardboard. Ewww.   \n\nAnd then there were the hot wings - gross!

That's right, Contestant #1! The correct answer is 'paying $2500 bucks for a 500 sq. ft.  apartment'.\n\nKnow what definitely does not suck? Living within 2 blocks of 4 markets, 4 or 5 decent-to-great restaurants, 2 or 3 coffee shops including at least one that's really superior, and (here's the point) TWO late night slice shops.\n\nSo, naturally I've tried Cybelles and Bellisimo. Just as naturally, I've been on the verge of blacking out every time I've done so, so up until now I haven't reviewed either, even though their pizza tastes like some kind of devine manna at midnight, or whenever you happen to be wasted. \n\nAll that said, I made the leap today and bought some slices from Bellissimo without being intoxicated at all! Astonishingly, it's pretty damn good... and as you can tell from my other reviews, I'm actually kind of a foodie. Oh, and to be fair, I had a double bourbon before I actually started eating, because how are you ever gonna catch a buzz with two slices of pizza in your stomach?\n\nit's important to understand pizza-by-the-slice. Of course they're a little cooler than I'd like, with a crunchy-hot crust from being reheated. Naturally, they're not quite as good as a fresh pizza. You have to take that into account when you review.\n\nCrust was crunchy-tasty. Sauce was good, not too sweet or over-spiced. Toppings didn't look exceptional, but it turns out that they worked great together.\n\nPros: Fast (5 minutes in and out). Tasty. Affordable, but not what I'd call cheap. Open 'til 2am. 1 block from my apartment.\n\nCons: Slice pizza (might be fresh or stale depending on the luck of the draw). Toppings could be a little higher-rent.\n\nI'll do it again, because it's easy, tasty, convenient and cheap...ish.", "author": "Dave T."}

My ankle is hurting from an injury months ago and tired from the long day, I decided to order some food.  I wait about an hour, and finally get a call from the delivery guy.\n\nHe says that the security guard came to him and told him he couldn't park on the fire lane in the roundabout.  This, I realize immediately, is a lie.  Been here 6+ years, and everyone has always parked there for hours at  a time, myself included, while moving groceries in and out, and so forth.  Hours---I highly doubt a security guard, who is even rarely seen there, would tell him THIS NIGHT that he couldn't stay there for a minute.  But ok, this is beside the point---to continue...\n\nI explain the situation, saying I can't walk on my foot right now, so I can't come down, and wonder how the situation can be fixed.  He proceeds to raise his voice at me, telling me how I told him the same story months ago about my ankle being injured.  Clearly this guy has never had an injury.  \n\nLong story short, after speaking to someone from Seamless, he declined to deliver the pizza and they issued me a refund.\n\nSeriously, SEAMLESS SAVED THE DAY.  It was nice to talk to someone professional, especially after having a stranger with my home address shouting at me and calling me a liar.  I think I'd be a lot more perturbed at this point ...", "author": "Rosanna S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-08", "description": "I don't know why so many people are hating on this place. While visiting my favorite city we stayed at the Hotel Vertigo and were looking for a pizza place nearby because we were lazy, had the munchies, and wanted to eat in. All the reviews for pizza joints in the area were pretty bad so we decided to take a chance on Bellissimo.\n\nWhile the guy who took the order was not very personable and had a thick, non-Italian accent, he got our order correct, including our thin crust request, and even offered us a few ways to combine things to save a few bucks. \n\nWe ordered a pepperoni pizza, thin crust, with a dinner salad. He mentioned one would be enough for two people. They delivered it to the door pretty quickly. The pizza was super hot when it arrived. Everything was correct and even though we forgot to ask for things like utensils, they included those, napkins, parmesan cheese, pepper flakes, and dressing. The only thing I can complain about were that the cucumbers in the salad could have been fresher. Everything else in the salad (iceberg lettuce, green olives, tomato, onion, and some greens) was fresh and perfect. The pizza crust did get hard after it sat for a while. Maybe that's why people were complaining about it being like cardboard or from the freezer section. I would recommend getting a thinner crust in the future. The cheese on the pizza was so good, salty, greasy, just like a pizza joint should be. Everything came out to about $17 and we gave a $4 tip. \n\nWe were really surprised at all the bad reviews. I have not been inside, only briefly walked by the actual place, so I can't comment on that.\n\nI'm satisfied with the food I got for the price I paid.\n\nDon't let the bad reviews fool you and give this place a try.", "author": "Catalina V."}

I've had a lot of different styles of crust (thin/crispy, thick/doughy, thin/foldy), styles of sauce (\"white\", sweet marinara, one with lots of herbs and spices, etc), different toppings, though my go-to is Pineapple and real (not Canadian) bacon, or plain cheese.\n\nBellissimo's does Pizza by the Slice, or made to order whole pizzas. Rarely do I get a PBTS, unless I'm drinking, which is usually how I find these local pizza joints anyway (I'm looking at you, Angelo's in Dover, DE, across from Irish Mike's and that one place in Chester, PA near that uh... one bar... yeah, I was pretty drunk and don't remember the name of either, BUT their 420 pizza topped with chopped chicken tenders, sliced mozzarella sticks, and french fries was awesome!).\n\nI digress. I unfortunately did not find this one by stumbling into it at last call and ordering by the slice. For 3 days, walking between Hotel Vertigo and Union Square, I passed it and finally decided to check it out. I ordered a whole pizza because of price, really. I could eat a 12\" by myself in the course of a late afternoon through the night. I only saw Canadian bacon on the menu for the Hawaiian, so I asked the guy behind the counter if they had real bacon. He grinned and chuckled a little bit because he understood I considered Canadian \"bacon\" to be Not Real Bacon. Skipping the meat, I went for a cheese and pineapple. Pineapple goes really well with mozzarella and pizza sauce, even without the meat.\n\nService was fast, I tipped their jar. Brought two doors down to my hotel room. This pizza was LOADED with cheese! Yes! I LOVE pizza places that aren't stingy with mozzarella. The crust wasn't too thick or doughy, not too soft or too hard. It was nice and chewy, the sauce wasn't overpowering, and the cheese did that wonderful stringy effect when you pulled a slice away from the pie... and WITHOUT the pool of grease on the top! How did they... ? Black magic, I say.\n\nThe first bite was heaven. The second and third bites were even better. Before I knew it, I had eaten half of the pizza. \n\nBest pizza in the city? Very probable. This is quite possibly one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Tenderloin has some very, very good local eats, and probably one of the only reasons to come to this district (unless you enjoy being panhandled by the homeless, of course).", "author": "Meg S."}

Really friendly delivery guy. Pizza was pretty alright. Not amazing but by no means bad. While it was a little underdone the dough was good enough for it not be a huge issue. The mozzarella was little stringy/rubbery but still delicious. Peperoni and pineapple tasted great. They thoughtfully included pepper flakes and parmesan without a specific request--not everyone does. Most importantly its pretty cheap. $17 plus tax and tip for an xtra large (16\") Hawaiian is deal.

But this is one has the best pizzas ever!  If you went when the former owner had it try again you will be pleased at the improvement.\n\nI was amazed at how good their pizza is!  When you walk in check out the ready to go slices, but be fast.  It is not uncommon for many people to come in at once.  \n\nLast night three pizzas were ready and in five minutes they were all gone.  If you get  a slice you will probably want a second one, if you wait one of the herd will grab it and you will have to wait for a fresh one out of the oven.  I saw about 15 slices sold in five minutes no kidding!\n\nWho goes there?  locals, tourists, Academy of Art Students, Retired people, the mix is very San Francisco.\n\nLast night I had three slices since I missed lunch and dinner.  The guys there are great and have great customer service!\n\nThe place has inside and sidewalk seating.  With all deference to my ex who loved North Beach Pizza, this is better and cheaper.  The crusts are never burned or overly dry, the condiments are fresh.  If you are into garlic try their garlic slice (but not before a date), it is the most pungent garlic slice I ever had.  I simply love their classic cheese slice, it is exceptional.  The spinach and feta is wonderful...\n\nThere is a late night market next door (Yogi Market) that has about the same hours, so you can grab a pizza and whatever you need just next door both are open till 2AM...\n\nIt is open late and great if you need a bite after partying, if you go in sober the food will taste great.", "author": "Tom B."}

The guy behind the counter overheard me and mentioned that they make sandwiches as well, but that they're just not listed on the menu. \n\nI was skeptical about a sandwich that didn't make the menu board, but I figured I'd give it a try.  I decided on a turkey sandwich with lettuce, tomato, red onion, green bell pepper mustard and mayo.  To my pleasant surprise the large sandwich, which was made on their homemade focaccia bread, was grilled to perfection on a panini press.  I also took a side of their homemade pesto to try on the sandwich.  OMG- it was delicious!  It was flavorful and not super oily like I find most pesto sauces to be.  \n\nI would have given this place four stars for their quality \"fast food\", but they earned a fifth star for their genuinely nice staff.

It's dark golden brown on the bottom which is really nice. The crust is really the best standard crust i have probably ever had. Nothing super stands out about this pizza, but it's a perfect standard and their sizes are larger than other places.

Combine all this with the fact that they're open until 2:30 most evenings, and they easily garner five stars.", "author": "Robert P."}

Almost gave them 5, but it could have been hotter (temp) and the sausage could have been more spicy.  All in all a great slice.", "author": "Jane P."}

It's my go-to late night spot and I will order delivery or carry out from here if I'm ordering pizza.   \n\nTheir crust is of the thick fluffy variety, and their special \"bellissimo\" pizza is deeelicious!", "author": "brooke m."}

I had the pepperoni pizza, nothing that special but not horrible either. The pizza and a can of soda came out to $4 even, not bad after a night of bar/club hoppin around the area. \n\nOh and they just recently got rid of the cardboard and magic marker menu and stepped it up to something official and legit lol. \n\nThey close at 2am, atleast on friday nights when we're always there.", "author": "Mafia J."}

I asked for a slice of pizza and he gave me a dirty look, and said we dont have that.  I was disappointed by the service.  So i left and waited outside while my friend ordered his pizza, which was cold and dry.... avoid this place.", "author": "Neems y."}
