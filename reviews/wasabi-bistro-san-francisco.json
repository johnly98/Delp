We started off with some appetizers - the pork gyoza was absolutely delicatable and the tempura was alright. \nIn terms of sushi rolls, they are a great size and seem super fresh. We had the California Roll (classic) that was packed with flavor, a Boston Roll which was top notch and the 49er roll (love me some lemon on sushi and no seaweed on it which let the flavor of the salmon shine). \nA bit expensive outside of Happy Hour but a great selection and taste.", "author": "Joolia M."}

The tuna was a deep red color and not fishy in the least. The fattier tuna was a good amount of fatty. The yellowtail had really good flavor, and was also buttery. The halibut was also super soft and tasty. I quickly gobbled up all of the other fish.

It was a Saturday night around 645 and all the tables were full but luckily there was no wait so we get the first available table within a few minutes. \n\nThe service wasn't overall friendly but they we by no means rude. We ordered the shrimp tempura appetizer and a large hot sake to start. The tempura was good except for one piece of some type of squash that was super undercooked and crunchy. The sake was not bad for $7, the large was around 4 small cups. \n\nFor our main rolls we had the shrimp tempura and the rainbow roll. My wife gets the shrimp tempura roll every time we get sushi and she did not like this one at all. I finished it for her and agree that it definitely was not great. I however did love the Rainbow roll. The California base was flavorful and the assorted fish on top was fresh. \n\nFor the app, the sake, and 2 rolls it was less than $40.

We ordered a total of 8 hand rolls, agedashi tofu, a large hot sake, and coke all for under $40! They have a wide selection of items for happy hour like hand rolls, regular rolls, hot appetizers (tempura, agedashi tofu, karaage, etc.), and beer and sake. We had ordered the spicy tuna, spicy scallop, salmon skin, and unagi hand rolls. Out of those four, the unagi and salmon skin were the best. The spicy tuna and spicy scallop were of good quality, but there was not enough flavor or spice to the mixture. I do have to applaud the sushi chefs for not having any sinew in the spicy tuna! Some places that we've been to have sinew in the mixture which makes the texture unpleasant.

Hence it still tasted good they changed the highlight of the teriyaki chicken: they now using white meat without skin so the great crispiness is gone. I was informed that this was done based on customer complains. It seams that people are worried intus to fat with skin on. Well through the process of grilling like these guys somit most of the fat will be gone. I have to say to the owner now you have another type of customer complaining and that's me. Bring back the taste that a chicken pieces with skin bring on the plate  or at least give the customer a Choice!\nBut again I got an outstanding service from Pak, but I hope the owners reconsider to bring this specialty back! Stay to your first ideas! That will bring the five star back!\n***\nWell sometime it just take time. As with this place. I have run across this restaurant, well I can not tell how often. Fro\n The outside it looks so upscale that you don't wanna get in for a quick lunch and when you have been looking for dinner it didn't came in mind. \n\nBut now that I'm more around the Castro when I do some volunteering for the SFAF/Struts it just jumped into my face. And since today they advertised my favorite \"standard\" meal as a special for lunch, I thought I will give it a try. \n\nAnd I am happy I did. \n\nThe service is good and fast. I had Pak as waiter, got my order really quick taken off. But my first question, as with each Asian restaurant was of they do MSG, they don't! Which is great, since a real chef should know how to make food tasty without that \"help\". \n\nThe water is infused with citrus fruit which gives it a real good taste, and not the typical chloride water that you are used to in San Francisco or other big cities. \n\nBut let's talk about the food. Upfront you get the typical Miso soup, but this time I almost finished it - it was very good, and the small green salad had an yummy dressing. Up to a good start, when it comes to the main: It came in a decent size for a lunch. The rice was cooked perfect and was ideal for the use of chopsticks. As garnish there have been cold (?) Brokkoli strains. Well, I could live without them, or just wish they would been heated up. The chicken itself was the real surprise, I love my chicken with crispy skin (well I think it's a german thing) and to provide chicken teriyaki with crispy pieces - you need to know how you tread a chicken. Well they do here, the teriyaki sauce itself was good nothing outstanding, but definitely Had sauces that have been not as good. The sauce was also not to overpowering. The whole combination was just right, a good amount of sesame (always not enough for me) on top has made this a really good chicken teriyaki. \n\nI learned that the place had a change of ownership recently (four month so in September 17), when I read the old review, it seems as iwas a necessary change. \n\nSo guys keep up the good work, I will check in the future if the crispy chicken was a one time achievement, or if this is the general quality (which I hope).", "author": "Martin W."}

Thick slices, fresh flavor, overall a win!\n\n-Temaki trios of salmon skin, salmon and hamachi, for $2.95 each.

Wow! We later found out that there has been a recent change of hands in management. New sushi chef, new manager, new atmosphere!\n\nThe decor was pretty clean and modern feel.

The seatings were nice and cozy.\n\nOn to the food: they have dozen of appealing selection to choose from and many recommendation from the chef. Since we were crazing for sushi and sashimi, we ordered a few large party trays. The chef also recommended a few dishes for us. The fishes were fresh, high quality cut, and delicious! Definitely some of the best I had in the Bay. You know how they put the leftover heads and tails of the fish as display? Well, the chef came over to our table and offer to make some nice warm fish soup from it!! Now that's customer service! The soup was a nice addition for our after meal. For the other dishes (cooked food), we had tempura, sushi rolls, fried shrimp, and many more that I can't recall. Everything was just amazing. (See my photos).\n\nOverall: if you're in the area and looking for some Japanese fusion food, you should definitely give this place a try!

The not so attentive service? Or the acceptable [sic] sushi? I guess starting with the flow of events makes the most sense.\n\nMy friend and I ordered a mojito each. It came out in a tumbler glass with a little stirring straw that didn't event make it past the rim of the glass. My glass had white wash streaks around the edge in places and looked less than clean. The drink itself tasted like a lemon/lime soda drink that had gone super flat. Recognizing that this was made with Soju didn't really account for the fact that the flavor was so... odd. And amount of alcohol was a little suspect.\n\nWe also ordered the oysters because, when in a coastal area, that's what you do! Unfortunately, with the way the drinks came out the oysters also felt a little suspect. When they came out they were very much no-frills, which is/can be fine. But, the oysters didn't really taste like they had properly been kept frozen. They were not necessarily properly shucked, so the meat slides right off, and personally I felt like the oysters were just a little less than fresh taste wise.\n\nThe garlic edamame app we also got was fine. The garlic taste feels like an after though thrown on to the general edamame dish but whatever.\n\nThe sushi itself was acceptable. The menu had a lot of frill-ful options but a lot of the base was tuna. Can't say I loved the sushi, can't say I hated it. It was just that, regular sushi.\n\nThe service was slow and took us a while to get our checks. We were never asked if we wanted more drinks. We were never asked if we wanted water.

The space is large but was relatively empty, so I was seated right away. My friend and I shared the baked chicken wings, the steak teriyaki, and a roll. Both the chicken wings and steak were on lunch special so they came with a miso soup and house salad. Miso soup was fine, not much to be said there. The salad dressing was very thick and had a strong mayonnaise taste to it. Our entrees came out soon after. The order of baked chicken wings were very slimy and had an interesting texture to them, while also lacking flavor. Our order of steak teriyaki was mediocre at best, but was riddled with so much extra fat on the meat. The roll was a toss up, I didn't enjoy it but my friend had a better taste for it. Service was fast and the place was clean. I should have followed my instinct and headed to Osaka a block over.

We were greeted so kindly from one of the workers. We thought he was a host seating us but as it turns out he was our server. He introduced himself as Eric and he was just so kind & genuine. We really wanted some amaebi but they didn't have any. His guidance and knowledge of the menu helped us pick great choices. We enjoyed the fresh oysters. They were so tasty! The garlic edamame was soooo good! We never had seasoned edamame like that before. It really kicks up the boring typical salted edamame. The rolls were tasty and the sashimi was so good! It melted in our mouths. Eric helped us pick out bottles of cold sake to celebrate my birthday. I definitely recommend the Yuki Nigori Lychee sake and the Sho Chiku Bai Nigori Saka.

No refills on our water at all and 2 waitresses we're just too busy chatting with the regulars. \n\nWe finally got a chance to ask for our check and the girl with the ponytail just dropped the receipt on our table and walked away. \n\nWe were both polite through out the visit, but the service was so disgusting that food I just had is about to come out.

He got the chicken miso ramen and I got the Castro Roll..well..when in Castro right?!  The Castro roll was spicy crab, avocado, cucumber, jalapeno and Suzuki (waiter described it to me as like a butterfish) and a special spicy sauce.  Veggie gyoza was nice and crisp but not greasy filled with delightful veggies.  My Castro roll was huge and yes indeed, spicy!  The seafood was fresh and it was a great roll.  However, after I ate a few pieces, I noticed a hair ontop of one of the pieces..ugh..and I don't think it was mine.  But this happens at so many restaurants so I won't hold them too accountable for it.  He enjoyed his huge bowl of ramen.  I like how Wasabi Bistro offers a lot of alternatives for SF's diverse clientele - veggie options, soy paper options for sushi, etc. \n\nService was friendly and good, but then as they got busier a little less attentive.

However, after a couple of abysmal experiences, I have to say avoid it.  The food is ok and the happy hour food special is very reasonable.  The problem is the service is terrible.  My first experience here was last June.  We were a group of 8 on a Sunday evening (Pride in fact).  The first hint that we should have avoided the place was that it was empty.  It still took about 20 minutes for a waiter to come over and take our orders, and then another 45 minutes to get food.  \n\nMy second poor experience with this place was yesterday around 6pm (a Saturday night).  5 of us ordered a bunch of food to share.  Even though the place was not busy at all, it took forever to get the food.  The worst part was that when we paid, we were short-changed $20.  I personally know all the money was there since I counted it.  Not sure how that happened, but not going back, ever!  Don't waste your money and time.", "author": "Larry L."}

The purpose is clear; to soak in the local flavor and find things that you love about a city; to make it home.\n\nWhen I moved to Phoenix years ago, I discovered Fez. Then I got to San Diego and it was Hash House a Gogo. Then in Berkeley, it was Lime (okay, in SF). Then in LA, it was Animal.\n\nThe category? Mood enhancers. Those places that are so on top of their game, do what they do so well, and make you feel so comfortable, that you just click into place and go \"Yup, this is one of those gold-star places.\"\n\nIn 2014, in San Francisco, Wasabi Bistro is the place. I don't even know what to say, other than look at my pictures. The presentation was spot-on, the flavors were flawless, the sushi amongst the freshest I've had. The sake was delightful. The waiters were handsome (Hey, you're looking at a place in the Castro. You care too.) The owner was friendly, knew half of the customers by name, and hugged half of them on their way out the door after their meal.\n\nChatting with the owner a bit as our party had dinner tonight, somehow he came to feel like a friendly uncle who owns a restaurant. Which is two things... one... really how you want to feel at a place to plan to return to regularly... and two... really weird because there's no resemblance at all... Okay, maybe I should stop taking myself too literally here.\n\nSeriously, worth checking out. I don't know what the few bad reviewers were talking about, but I suspect that either they caught the place while it was still undergoing some settling-in period... they had a few bad apples they no longer have... or something. Because I'm a sushi snob, as well as, you know, a general snob, and this place just nailed it.", "author": "Sean B."}

A disturbing scene to say the least\n3- the four dishes came out in three waves, though the restaurant was almost empty at the time\n4- the steak teriyaki had large chunks of fat on it.

Moreover, their happy hour starts at 11:30am, which is unheard of.\n\nI recommend their 3pcs/ or 6pcs Omakase menu in order to enjoy the best and tastiest sushi they offer.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend their seared walu sushi-succulent, tasty, buttery, orgy and heaven in your mouth awesomeness.\n\nAs of right now, I'm the \"duke\" of Osaka sushi, which is a far cry from what Wasabi Bistro is.

My friend frequents the restaurant a lot, so I figured it must be good still. Well, the food was good, but I experienced the weirdest service ever. \n\nLet's start with the food though. I ordered the bacon scallop, which took a while to make but I was glad because it was grilled perfectly and had the natural flavor of the scallop and bacon without any extra sauces. The tuna tataki was not the freshest, and had a super rubbery texture. The teriyaki/soy sauce saved it from being a flavorless, mushy disaster. Finally the veggie tempura was quite nice. Perfectly fried. \n\nSo the next part was really weird. My friend asked for a glass of water, and upon bringing it, the waitress asked if I wanted a glass of water too, so I said ok. She replied \"why didn't you tell me earlier so I could bring them at the same time. Now I have to go back and get it. hahaha, just kidding.\" At first I was going to brush it off, but then it sunk in and I was furious. I'm thinking you asked me, not the other way around, and second I don't even know you. I haven't become a regular customer to have that kind of banter.

My husband and I went to Wasabi Bistro last night and had an unbelievable situation. When we first arrived (to an empty restaurant) at 7:45 on a Saturday- the hostess looked at us as though we were bothering her. After being seated -  my husband went to the men's room and I looked at the menu. When he returned, he asked if a noticed a candle smell (which I did) and he said the smell was really bothering his eyes. We decided to leave. Instead of just walking out- I made an effort to tell the hostess we were leaving and explained that the smell was bothering my husbands eyes and that we would come back another time. Well- this hostess went off on me - and actually told me we were rude for coming in to \"pretend\" we were going to eat there just to use the bathroom. I was floored and calmly tried to explain that wasn't so. My husband came back into the restaurant to see why I didn't walk out with him and I explained what was going on and he asked to speak to the manager. A women came from the kitchen who claimed to be the manager and as we were explaining what happened she abruptly stopped me and said \"don't come back here again\". Then the hostess called my husband a bitch? Rest assured we will never be back and I will tell everyone I know not to ever eat at Wasabi Bistro. We live in the neighborhood and are very connected to the community. To the owner of this establishment- you have very poor representatives working for you and they may be the reason why your restaurant was empty on a balmy Saturday night.

At least that's the impression I got when I entered the doors of this new Japanese eatery, the one that took over All Season Sushi. I came at about 8PM on a Wednesday after a rather long day at work, and the place was still moderately busy. I was seated in the bar area where there were plenty of empty two-tops. It should come as no surprise that the decor was dominated by black lacquer, high-end light fixtures and lots of mirrors.\n\nIt was like eating at Liberace's Vegas showroom. Like I said...fabulous. Complimentary edamame arrived almost as soon as I sat down (see photo). While I was squeezing the beans into my mouth one pod at at time, I kept noticing how the menu went on for days as it was dominated by quite an eclectic collection of sushi and rolls. I always feel guilty ordering an elaborate sushi plate just for myself, so I went modest and ordered the $6.50 Spicy Tuna Roll (see photo) - simple, risk-averse and to the point. It was just fine as a starter.\n\nThe main event came with the $11 bowl of Pork Ramen, which came in a white designer bowl more fitting as part of a Danish modern place setting. The surprise was how delicious it was with slices of rolled roast pork generously swimming in the hearty broth alongside bamboo shoots and bean sprouts (see photo). I had every reason to believe it was going to be a noodle disaster, but far from it, I think I may come back just for that again. I'm also tempted to try tantalizing side dishes like wasabi scallop, tofu steak or any of the robata since I like the challenge of skewers when I eat.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...killer ramen bowl is a major surprise worth trying here\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...just fabulous...it's the Castro, sweetie\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...on the quiet side\nTOTAL - 4 stars...makes me want to try some more", "author": "Ed U."}

I was embarrassed and it ruin the whole experience, I will really like to come back to this place but the service is just unprofessional , how can you not even count your money and do such a scene? \nI called and ask to talk to a manager or owner and there is none, that explains her behavior.

IF YOU WANT TO BE VERBALLY ATTACKED BY A WAITER, PAY WASABI BISTRO A VISIT. \n\nI came here with my girlfriend and roommate to grab some lunch. The service was a bit slow from the beginning, and after delivering our initial order, we asked for a sake refill from our waitress, who then disappeared from the restaurant for at least 20 minutes. After 15 minutes of waiting, we asked the sushi chef about our sake and received an eye roll and response that \"it was coming.\" \n\nOnce 30 minutes had passed a different waiter who was serving other tables stopped by our table and asked (with an attitude) if we were done . My roommate commented that we were waiting for sake and weren't ready to go, but had waited so long that we just wanted the check now. The waiter then snapped at my roommate that \"I didn't take the order, don't get an attitude with me BITCH.\" YES, HE CALLED HER A BITCH. He then grabbed the check and slammed it on the table and said \"Don't leave a tip because it would be an insult.\" And procceded to cause a scene in the restaurant that caused another couple around us to leave the immediately. My roommate asked to see the manager and was told there was no manager there.\n\nIn my opinion, a meal from a restaurant with an  employee who verbally assaults a customer, has no manager available, ignores its customers unappologetically and has the most unprofessional and disgusting service I've ever witnessed IS NOT A MEAL YOU SHOULD PAY FOR. \n\nSo we weren't going to. As we walked towards the door, we were bombarded by both the waitress and waiter working who demanded we pay for the meal since we ate the food, and the waiter who was hurling verbal insults proceeded to push past me to PHYSICALLY BLOCK THE DOOR with a phone in his hand threatening that we could not leave and then calling the police asking them to come because we did not pay-\nMid sentence we shoved money in his hand and walked out. \n\nGood riddance. I'm disgusted. The food was alright but the audacity of the service will leave a rotten taste in my mouth forever.

However I found it had different owners now. I used to be loyal to Osaka Sushi in the Castro for my healthy food meals (amazing a neigborhood full of gym bunnies mainly has heavy food restaurants), however Osaka's sushi a while back was noticeably not as fresh one day and never got better, and it was still hard to leave without paying $35/$40 for a simple small lunch of sushi. \n\nThe interior looks nice. There's a host in the middle of the day waiting to seat you. They are super friendly. Don't let the fact that this place is empty fool you- it's good, just undiscovered! They have a large selection of food, some dishes such as the tuna tartare (delicious) have a california cuisine edge to them. I was impressed by the size of their side salad, and the price and quality were good (no iceberg lettuce). There is a large selection of hot and cold sakes. It's really easy to walk out of here after having a fresh, healthy, good tasting meal for around $25 for lunch (without being limited to the lunch special).\n\nI highly recommend this place to all my clients who often ask where to eat in the Castro.

In the front room there are 2 dangly chandeliers that are quite ridiculously over the top, and a harsh transition to slated walls that were either made of mock-porcelain, or something resin coasted with a low-sheen to it. \n\n-tuna poke: maybe a bit too much onion\n- rainbow roll: was frighteningly awful, the salmon and tuna tasted a bit rough in texture and the level of freshness was definitely questionable. \n\nPROS:\nDespite the atrocity of overwhelming decadence that is the interior, the service is always friendly, prompt, overly polite, and overly apologetic. Both times I've been here they have been very proactive about taking orders too soon, without giving me time to first breathe while I am still perusing the menu in an effort to make the best of informed decisions.  However, in the same breath plates of pickled ginger, wasabi, and edamame immediately come out upon seating, along with tall tumblers of iced water.\n\n--miso: fresh bits of tofu very firm, light on the sodium, and perfect for the cold weather.\n-spider roll: was nice and crisp\n-gyoza: were cooked very well and had with the perfect amount of seared crisp\n-walu nigiri: I was rather impressed with the excellent freshness, texture, and taste.\n-castro roll: had a subtle severity to it, as the slices of fresh jalapenos complimented the sweet sauce really well\n\nMAS-O-MENOS: so-so\n-spring rolls: were descent \n-hamachi nigiri: I've had much better\n\nI would probably come back here exclusively for the things I had good experiences with, since this place is conveniently located to where I live.

It was also crisp outside but mushy inside.  I would expect firm tofu to call this a steak. My sense is that the chef added it to the menu just to please vegetarians but does not really care how it tastes. The veggie dragon roll was pretty bland and the ratio of rice was too high. It was like eating plain rice garnished with a little avocado. \n\nNext the potstickers were mushy and the dipping sauce way too salty for this dog.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-03-22", "description": "I'm really not sure how this place gets a Yelp 4-star review.  We came in last night, and sat approximately 15 minutes before a server came by.  We weren't even asked if we wanted drinks during the wait!  Meanwhile the front door's broken and swinging in the wind (my girlfriend complained of being cold).  And there's BLOODY MURDERED BODIES on the TV screens throughout the place, courtesy CSI: Miami on 3 giant TV screens.  The human blood and guts was pretty unappetizing.  We managed to get the attention of our waitress after 5 minutes, now with the murdered bodies being dissected at the morgue on the TV... She said she'd change it.  But she forgot.  5 minutes later, I told her, \"Listen, we were actually serious about not wanting to see dead people while we're eating.\"  She did fix it then...\n\nAnyway, the food was unremarkable.  They said they had hamachi belly, but they didn't.  So I had some hamachi, and it was rubbery.  Certainly not worth savoring in any way.  We also had some rolls, which were pretty decent... Though one was overly sweet and hella fatty (deep fried).  The garlic edamame were very good.\n\nBut back to the service... So my girlfriend's vegetarian, and we ordered her stuff very clearly as \"the vegetarian stuff\"... Then the food comes out, all vegetarian stuff first, then all the fish!  So I got to watch her eat (well OK I stole a bunch of it) and then she got to watch me eat.  Really?  Seems like that could have been done better.\n\nAll in all, the only explanation for the high rating must be the prices.  Because it was actually pretty cheap.  I would much rather pay for something a little better though.", "author": "Jon E."}

We shared several plates and rolls.   Ordered were the beef robata, smoked salmon, akimo (monk liver fish), chicken karaage (not on menu), chicken teriyaki, pink lady roll, and several other rolls that I cannot remember.    \n\nMost of the food was OK in taste except for the pink lady roll.  The roll is served with some odd sauce over the salmon layer.   The sauce was not to my liking.  \n\nService was slow that evening, though it wasn't really crowded. I would say it was a little over half capacity.  Our server though was very good, as she was attentive to what we ordered.  She provided an extra large salad and 4 miso soups for our (at the time) 1 plate order.

I ordered the Sake (Salmon) and Maguro (Tuna) Nigiri, Q Madness and Miso Soup.\n\nThe food was very ordinary. Fish was mediocre quality at best. The Q Madness tasted very 'fishy', not like lobster and tuna. If you ordered something that had a strong sauce and hid the quality of the fish, you'd probably have a much better time than i did. Miso soup was fine.\n\nDelivery: Very disappointing. It says 45-60 minutes and it took over 80 minutes.

It had salmon and some sort of mayonaise sauce and it tasted really horrible. That needs to be axed from the menu. The spicy tuna and spider rolls were good .I can't say how good  their nigiri is since we only had the rolls. I'm always skeptical if the sushi chef isn't Japanese because I know to be a sushi chef in Japan takes years of apprenticeship and training.\n\nWe ordered other stuff off the menu which was surprisingly good, and some misses. The hamachi kama was good. Fried tofu, good. The bbq beef was good too. One thing that was not on the menu but you should try is chicken karaage (fried chicken). That was a winner.\n\nSome of the not so good. Aside from the Princess roll mentioned above, the Teriyaki chicken - this was just grilled chicken with a sweet teriyaki sauce on it. Kinda dry. I'm used to my teriyaki chicken being marinated. We also had ankimo, which is supposed to be the foie gras of the sea. I think it sat a little too long because it didn't have that rich, buttery flavor its supposed to have. I found the taste to be rather flat. \n\nThe service was good.

I'm new to the city, but not to the Bay, so I found this place on Yelp, thought it looked pretty classy, and sent out the link so my friend could make the reservation.\n\nTuesday night, 8 pm, the restaurant is basically empty and we get our pick of tables. Now that I think about it, it's probably because the Giants' World Series game was on, although there are TVs at this restaurant too. \n\nI'll admit, the empty tables were worrisome at first, but the service was all the more attentive for it. We were immediately offered water and edamame. My friend brought a coupon for a free crunchy CA roll for a purchase over $35, which apparently can only be redeemed if you order online. But since we didn't know that, and because it was my birthday, the waiter told us that they'd honor the coupon anyway. So far, so good...\n\nWe ordered 6 rolls: X, Kamikaze, Martini, Miso Salmon, Crunchy CA, and Volcano. The Martini and Crunchy CA were fried really well and the Martini roll is actually served in a martini glass! As a salmon lover, the Miso Salmon roll was right up my alley. All the fish was very fresh.\n\nWe also ordered 3 of the soju cocktails, which were hit and miss. My passion cocktail (soju, pineapple juice, mango juice), was definitely the hit. Not very strong, but very delicious.\n\nAfter we finished--free dessert (since it was my birthday and all)! The waiter (I wish we knew his name!) brought a plate of mint chocolate and coffee ice cream mochi with some chocolate syrup in a flower pattern, and he and my friends started a round of Happy Birthday, all in different keys. Very cute, and I love both mint chocolate and coffee ice cream.\n\nGive this place a shot. I sure am glad I did, especially on an important occasion like a birthday.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-23", "description": "Was very concerned when I saw high percentage of \"spicy\" rolls on the menu. In my experience this has been an attempt to mask low quality or less than fresh fish.  I am not a spicy tuna fan.  If I wan't to add chiracha to my food I will do it myself so I NEVER order anything on the menu with spicy tuna or a lot of sauce like ponzu or unagi sauce.  When I order Sushi I want to enjoy the flavor and texture of the fresh fish. Because of that this menu made it very difficult to order any rolls. I ended up order nigri: maguro, hamachi and hamachi toro., a rainbow roll, and and X roll which did have a spicy sauce.   \n\nThey brought the Nigiri first and was quite pleased with the freshness and portion of fish to rice. The maguro was one of the best I had in a while.  Then came the X roll.  very nice roll with salon and tuna on top, but drizzled in a typical chiracha based sauce.  Once I wiped that off it was pretty good.  Then came what I thought was the safe roll.  the Rainbow Roll.  It touted no imitation crap, they used snow crab instead with avocado and then an assortment of fish on top.  Well it may or may not have been imitation crab, but it was the worse crab salad in a rainbow roll I have had in a long while.  I ate the fish and avocado off it and left the roll. \n\nWhen I told the waiter what I thought he thanked me and said that he appreciated the feedback because that is the only way they can learn and grow.  He also brought green tea ice cream as an apology. \n\nTo wrap it up. The fish buyer seems on top of it.  If I came back I would probably stick with Nigiri Chirashi or Sashimi.  The Menu really misses the mark for me. Place is a bit too Hipster Hong Kong and prices are a bit high, but it is the heart of the Castro so their rent is probably outrageous.

To follow up, we asked if they served blue fin tuna, and our server proceeded \"oh YES, and it's delicious!\".  \n\nIf you know anything about seafood sustainability, you know that the blue fin tuna industry is among the most egregious of all fisheries. Google it, and boycott this restaurant.  96% of the world's Blue Fin Tuna are gone already, and a full 90% of what's left are got before they have a chance to reproduce.   \n\nIf you'd like your children to eat fish, boycott this and other restaurants like it.

The wait was about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad considering how packed it was. We ordered veggie udon, a sashimi bowl, and a hand roll. The hand roll was pretty tiny for the price and a bit bland to me; however, the udon and sashimi made up a great deal for it. The soup was very yummy with lots of veggies and the sashimi tasted very nice, fresh, and cold. It was a bit hard to get servers' attention at times but I figured it was due to the heavy crowd of that night's event. I would go here again if I was ever in the area.", "author": "Jane M."}

Well, I found the design to be cool and very welcoming, pretty cozy with updated decorations of black accents, with a full size bar and lots of sake selections!\n\nThe food was awesome, with very fresh and tasty sashimis, yummy.

I probably wouldn't have gone if I looked at the reviews on here a head of time, so I am glad I didn't! This place was very good! I was stuffed by the time I left as it was so good, I just kept ordering more. \n\nThe hand-rolls are extremely fresh and well prepared. You could taste the crunch of the nori and the freshness of the fish. Definitely some of the best hand-rolls I have had. The sushi was pretty good too, but I just got the standard Rainbow roll and 49er roll. Nothing too fancy, yet I was extremely excited that they use real crab in their rolls! It is so hard to find a good sushi place who also uses real crab. \n\nThe only negative that I had was that the wasabi was really weak/mild. I had to use a lot to get any sort of kick. \n\nI will agree with another Yelp review in that it is a weird ambiance in the place (lounge music, sports game on the TVs, etc), but it would not prevent me from going back.  The service was also very friendly as well.

My partner ordered the chicken teriyaki and I had the chicken udon soup.  The chicken is paper thin, and I do mean paper thin.  Rather than a tender morsel, it feels more like chewing wet, chicken jerky.  The miso soup tastes like it's the freeze dried/rehydrated kind you get at the supermarket and the soup broth was simply brown and salty (perhaps thinned Oyster sauce)?  The food really tasted like Chinese food, meant to look Japanese.  The quality of ingredients seemed subpar (is this where they cut cost to pay for all that tacky remodeling\n\nThe prices were simply outrageous; $15.95 for a chicken teriyaki lunch special with 3 tablespoons of paper thin, chewy meat, and a similarly priced, bowl of salty brown udon, accompanied by the same, lackluster, processed looking chicken meat.\nBarracuda on Market or Takara Sushi on 18th if one must have Japanese in the Castro, never, ever Wasabi Bistro.", "author": "Dwayne R."}

I've been several times now - irresistibly drawn by the oyster appeal. The oysters are a nice size and taste ( drakes bay perhaps?) and it's served with a ginger green onion ponzu dressing.  The dressing is ok but I'd prefer  a traditional mignonette with shallots and champagne vinegar.  I wish they offered the option of more than one accompaniment.\n\nI tried their house hot sake - a lil rough...\n\n One very good thing is their California roll made with very nice real & tasty snow-crab crab-meat.. I was pleasantly surprised and would come back just for the California roll.  \n\nI decided to try some other appetizers on the menu - the fried chicken - Chicken Karaage and Tempura.  These were mediocre, not soggy but not tastyeither.  I think this place has room for improvement.  I love meat , especially fried chicken but I think this dish would be improved if the chicken were more bite-sized and the if the dish received a sprinkle of seasalt before service.  The Tempura was not as crisp as it should be and was rather flavorless.. this place should take a page out of Osaka Sushi's playbook up the street..\n\nThe service is strange here .. a mixture of attentiveness coupled with periods where you are ignored.  I think this awkward service is due to an inexperienced & untrained staff.. out of the 4 times I've been here my order has always somehow been messed up.  Once the sake I ordered failed to arrive until halfway through my dinner.  Another time the 12 oysters I ordered never came until I brought it to the attention of the staff.

He said that wasn't a problem and left. \n\nI agree with other reviewers in that the service is quite slow (we were the only ones in there) and the food was pretty mediocre. I mean, the sushi rice was pretty dry, but the nigiri was fresh and tasted good. I didn't like one of the nigiri pieces (albacore) and didn't eat it. When the waiter came back he was so apologetic I didn't like the albacore and offered to go get me a salmon slab of fish instead. I thought that was quite nice of him.

I've tried something new each time and every dish has been impressive. My favorite has been the uni served on a spoon, gyutan izakaya, and baby lobster tail sushi. Their sashimi omakase is always fresh and in season. \nGreat place to grab dinner and drinks with friends. Tip: Ask for the fresh wasabi, it brings out a different taste compared to the regular paste and not all places have it.", "author": "Anita C."}

It melts in your mouth like a sliver of congealed fat would and brings the consumer on a euphoric boat ride down Flavor River. The rest of their sashimi stock is also delicious and fresh, especially the Toro. I've eaten at several high end sushi bars and most of the fish here is prepared on par with those restaurants. One of the many highlights of the restaurant is the wasabi. It transcended the fish to a level enjoyed only by demi gods and up. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.", "author": "Chesley Z."}

The three big screen TVs are distracting, but the awful blaring music and sub par sushi are much worse.  Went there last week, the one and only time.  You're trying to eat and this godawful music is blasting through the speakers.  Vocoders and dubstep, I'd rather get a spinal tap.  If the sushi were good I wouldn't come back because of the music, but the sushi fails too.  The fish is not good.  They can't even get the rice right.  They overcook the rice til it becomes pasty, and they use it as their sticky rice.  I suspect that's what gives you the strange aftertaste.  Oh I almost forgot, the lighting.  Way too bright.  \nIf things stay this way, I don't think they'll be open very long.  As it is now it's just another bad restaurant in this neighborhood.", "author": "Jason D."}

First off, for some reason whenever you go there the restaurant always has a table open (shhhh... don't tell anyone).  That's quite a rarity in the Castro and awesome to know that there's always a seat available at a good, reliable sushi place.  Second, the staff is really nice and the service (when you're in the restaurant) is always great.  On multiple occasions, the staff have either sent our table free edamame or given us a free sample of sake if we're having trouble deciding.  And, just last week, I was in there with a friend.  We were so deep in our conversation that we didn't realize it was already 11:20pm and the restaurant had closed.  I really appreciated that the folks there didn't rush us out and seemed happy to accommodate to us.\nOne last time, the Dragon Veggie roll is totally delicious and the salad dressing...

First of all we only decided to come here for the happy hour which is 3-6PM and you can get $1 oysters. When we were seated it was a long time before we were acknowledged. I had to motion twice before our orders were taken, but after 15 minutes of waiting we were finally able to flag down a waitress. We were told that they weren't doign happy hour oysters today and when we asked why, she just said \"we're just not doing it today.\" There should had been a sign outside or something indicating of the happy hour cancellation. We came all the way from Civic Center after Pride for nothing. So decided to just order something else. I had the seafood curry rice. I'll give this place 2 stars since the curry was fine, no complaints on the dish. When we were done, again I had to flag down a waitress for the bill. During the dining experience, our drinks we never refilled. They were fast on taking our money when we were done and yet slow on everything else including the service.

It feels like you are sitting outside without having to deal with the outside noise and uncomfortable weather during cold periods.  \n\nMy wife and I like to be surprised so many times we just ask the owner or manager for their best recommendations at that time.  Many times it's different because they will give us something that is fresh or in season.  There were a couple of times I asked for one of my typical sushi dishes and he would recommend something better.   It's kind of a team effort thing that we really aopreciate.\n\nThe food was great!  I like how creative some of their dishes are.  I don't really remember the names of the dishes because I just told the owner (Albert) to hook me up with some of the best stuff he can offer.  He did not disappoint us.  I just remember having various sushi and grilled dishes that I never had before and walked out of there totally stuffed and happy.  He actually comp'd me with a couple of dishes that were new and asked my opinion before adding it to the menu.\n\nI did take photos of what I liked though so all I have to do is pull it up on my iPad and I'll get to re-experience the yummy dish I had before!  \n\nAs Arnie S. would say ... \"I'LL BE BAACK!\"  :)\n\nP.S.

Some of the rolls are quite special and delicious.  A few pointers based on past experience.  First, I have always had a better experience at the sushi bar rather than the tables.  Second, some of the specials can be a bit pricey (for example the Toro Tartare).  If you take the staff suggestions regarding a special...just be sure that you know the price.

Secondly, everyone there is pushy and trying to get you to order the thing that they suggest -- even though you've told them three times you're not interested in cream cheese in your maguro roll and no, you don't like deep-fried sushi rolls.  Fish tastes fresh, but there's so much rice surrounding it that you can hardly taste it.  The only good thing was abundant green tea :) \n\nDefinitely worth skipping!", "author": "Mike Y."}

Appears they've put in quite a bit of work and invested a good sum of money to update this restaurant.   The food was quite good: the sushi seemed fresh, rolls were good, and gilled very salmon flavorful.  The restaurant was quite full but didn't feel too crowded (a little loud with the music but not too bad).  The restaurant itself was well kept and clean as well as food nicely presented on the dishes.  I do think the service was somewhat disorganized, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they'll work through this since they've only been open a few days and they did seem to have plenty of waitstaff to handle the crowd.  Within a few weeks, I'm sure they'll have all the kinks worked out and running a smooth operation.", "author": "Kent W."}

The food was nothing short of excellent, particularly the sashimi sampler and the AMAZING Golden Eye, which a salmon wrap with snow crab, shiso, mango and tobiko. Quite possibly the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. Our waitress, Wendy, was incredibly knowledgeable and gave us very helpful tips, including which things really shouldn't be dipped in soy sauce so that their flavor could be properly savored. They also have REAL WASABI in addition to the paste one almost always gets, which is a nice treat. We were actually the only customers there, which was sad and in due in part to the war zone of the Castro, which is being completely torn up and renovated these days, so I can't speak for how the service might be if it was crowded but for us it was perfect. \n\nSo we gorged on a lot of food and had a $30 bottle of sake that seemed magically bottomless, and the meal came to $100 for the two of us, which seems very reasonable. We will definitely be back! I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews here. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because we're in San Francisco and that does not do justice to the truly extraordinary restaurants we have here.", "author": "James W."}

The decor was nice, the menu is honestly on the expensive side for what you get... But I really wouldn't expect much else in the Castro.\n\nMy date ordered some sushi for main course, and I ordered one of the entrees (pork katsu). His sushi came out in about 5-10 minutes. Fifteen (!!!) minutes later, I still hadn't received any soup or salad, much less my entree.\n\nWe had a hard time flagging down someone to help us (despite eight people front of house that we counted). We mentioned that none of my food had come out yet, waiter was apologetic, went to the back and immediately returned with my entree.\n\nWhen I mentioned that I didn't receive my soup or salad still, they were surprised and brought them out immediately.\n\nAs for the quality of the food, mine was mediocre at best. Under-seasoned katsu that was soggy on the bottom (I'm guessing it was sitting out for a while). Pretty much flavorless. Date said that the sushi wasn't bad, fairly standard.\n\nThe management was very apologetic for the mess up with my food, and comp'd us our sake. They offered us free dessert too.\n\nAll said, I think they really have to work on the quality of their food for the prices they are charging, and their communication between the front and back of house. Having 8 people milling about that haven't noticed a half-served table is pretty unacceptable.\n\nDoubt I'll return.", "author": "Will C."}

I had ordered a bunch of food to eat after work and was waiting for it to arrive when I got a call about 10-15 mins later. They were calling to say that they were busy, I was too far, it would take over an hour for me to get my food, and they would charge me an extra 5 dollars because of how far away I am. I'm not sure how eat24 works with their restaurants or whose fault this would be but don't state there would be free delivery or say you can deliver to a location just to call and say I'm too far and will be charged for it. Also the lady on the phone was nice and I'm sure she was thinking of me when telling me about my order but I still got the impression that they didn't want to deal with this order. They rather me cancel it than for them to come out all that way. You guys should change whatever it is your range on eat24 is because that's just horrible. To top it off they didn't even properly cancel the order so I would have still been charged if I didn't contact eat24 myself. Horrible and unprofessional.

We hit some happy hour items but put ourselves into our servers hands. We had to have Shima Aji and OToro sashimi and a sashimi platter. The oysters were excellent because my son ate four out of five. The Toro had just come in so it came last as it needed preparing and cutting but I were very pleased when it arrived. We had Chicken Karaage, a Hawaiian roll that had butterfish and baby scallops, and pineapple and usually fruit in sushi is a disaster, but it was light and fresh and scrummy. All of our fish was of excellent quality, exceedingly fresh, generous portions, hon-maguro to die for, and the robata was very well cooked and spiced. The Toro was amazing.

I ordered the Omakase 10pc lunch to see what the sushi chefs were featuring today and it's absolutely a dish this restaurant can be proud of. It was some of the freshest sushi you'll find in town and amazingly, it's served with delicious bright green fresh wasabi (the pale ground version has more horseradish in it).  I see that some Yelpers complained about pricing but my lunch was very fairly priced for their excellent quality fish. If freshness is essential to you and you would never think of cutting corners on sushi, you will love this place.  I also had a spectacular salmon roll with fresh (super fresh!) dungeness crab, mango and roe.  I think it's called the Sun Roll. Unique and excellent.
