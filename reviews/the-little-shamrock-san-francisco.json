That is unheard of in the city. \n\nMy friend and I were very lucky to stumble across this place one night. We were supposed to go to the museum but tickets sold out and we wanted to figure out something to do while we waited for our friends who did get in. \n\nWe talked to the security there and she mentioned to visit the little shamrock. Just half a mile away from the museum. This security guard is also a bartender at this spot. I wish I could remember her name! Very friendly lady she is. \n\n$5 beers, is a bargain in the city especially since I'm not from there. We went around 7 pm and it  as quiet and plenty of available seating on nice furniture, couches, chairs. They have table games available. \n\nI like that the bartender would come up to us and ask if we wanted drinks instead of having to go up to the bar.

From the outside, it looks like just-another typical irish pub. If you give them a chance, though, you'll discover that it's actually so much more.\n\nThey have a reasonably good selection of beer on tap for absurdly cheap. My go-to is the $12 pitchers of Deschutes Black Butte Porter. But they have plenty of great, drinkable options if you don't like darker beers. And if you're just looking for cheap beer, the PBR is $8/pitcher. \n\nThe bar has a ton of couches & other seating for big groups, which I love. I can (and have) come here with a group of 15-20 people on a week night. They dont' serve food, but I actually think this is a plus for the bar because they'll let you bring food in instead. There are a ton of good options for food within a couple blocks (gyros, mexican, burgers, thai), so everyone can get what they want and meet here to eat, drink, & be merry. Better yet, they usually have a waitress doing table service, so she'll make sure you're topped off while you eat.\n\nAnother of my favorite things about this bar is their collection of games. They have a few typical bar games, like darts in the back room, but they also have a whole shelf of fun boardgames, and several backgammon tables. It's so easy to come here and just hang out for several hours with a group of your friends. \n\nMy introduction to the Shamrock was through the SF Rec Ultimate League. This is the de-facto post-game watering hole for the league, and has been for at least a decade. On a Tuesday or Thursday evening in the summers, you can regularly expect to get a crowd of 20+ jovial Ultimate players sharing pitchers and taking over couches. I think other rec sports leagues also tend to end up here. If you find yourself here on a night where everyone's wearing matching shirts and athletic shorts, go introduce yourself and make some new friends, they'll be friendly.\n\nThe Shamrock is in the Inner Sunset, but still reasonably accessible via the 71 or the N.

Inside, the bar was well lit in soft lights that were enrobed in stain glass lampshades that hark of days old.  There were many many lamps.  Many.  \n\nThe tables and chairs are mismatched the way only time can bring together pieces of discarded furniture.  The ceilings are higher than average, about 14 feet, yet the lowered wooden beams that crossed with the support post gave it a cozy pub-like feel.  The groupings were natural and the clustering was inviting.\n\nWe settled down at the back of the pub where a lively fire was burning.  There was a living room like cluster of couches and armchairs in front of the fire, and board games off to the side.  On the walls were an esoteric history lesson in Irish Crests and beer.  The clock perpetually said 5:00.  It was charming.\n\nThe Guiness took forever to \"draw.\"  The BF said proper Guiness takes years to pour, and it tastes creamy.  This place gets the stamp of approval.  The beer is fresh, creamy, slow, but still only 16 oz (vs. 20 oz).  Despite this drawback, the BF kept thinking that it felt like being at a pub back home.

I love the homely interior and the very reasonably priced drinks.  Great beer selection plus killer white russians and car bombs.  Spent so many nights here getting that warm feeling.  Cool seating with a nice look over toward the park.  No jukebox but the bartenders do a pretty good job managing the tunes.  It's cash only, probably cuz they couldn't hook up a credit card slider to that 1800s cash register.  It's my favorite bar in the area and there's a lot of 'em around.

First thing I noticed when walking is that none of the furniture matched. Second was the two or three group of folks playing backgammon while enjoying a few pints of their favorite beers. \n\nThe group I was with settled down and found a great spot to enjoy ourself. We were coming from dinner and just wanted a little night cap. So we ordered 4 Irish Coffees. The bartender banged out 4 tasty Irish Coffees and we proceeded to enjoy the end to our evening. \n\nAt one point I noticed 4 spunky girls with darts in their hand making their way to the back section of the bar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-04-09", "description": "The Little Shamrock is a nicely laid-out pub that provides a homey, lived-in feel while still presenting itself as clean while not overly sterile.  Less rectangular and closer to square in shape, it gives off an inviting cafe-like feel.  The shape of it also allows for ample front windows, allowing natural light to more effectively penetrate most of the seating area.  Further back and at night, lighting is tastefully done with hues of green at the bar gently blending to orange-ish earth-tones towards the rear.  A nice art collection compliments the walls, while the ceilings are tastefully accented with a sizable assortment of stained-glass lamps.  \n\nThe clients are mixed, local, and friendly.  I cruised in, commented on a discussion involving past loves and mistakes made, and I was instantly one of the crowd.  Very little pretension, with insularity bordering on nil.  The jukebox and the selections coming out of it were nothing short of perfect for the Saturday afternoon I was visiting, and the ratio of music-amplification to ambient-noise never made conversation a problem.  Board games are available for use to patrons, and it didn't look like you'd have trouble finding a friendly opponent.\n\nThe barmaid was nice, and the selection of beer was about on par with any other well-trafficked pub in the city.  They don't cook here, but a popcorn machine provides free relief from the munchies.  If you want something more substantial, a host of restaurants can be found a block over on Irving Street.\n\nThe really nice thing about this place?  Despite it's pretty close proximity to USCF, most of the crowd were grown-ups.  There weren't any boisterous kids present, and their usual twenty-something mating game along with the bad vibe that follows it around was thankfully absent.  It's one of the first pubs I've stumbled into in a long time that I'll consider a home away-from-home.  Look for me at the bar on Sunday afternoons.....I'll be one of many with a pint in my hand, and a smile on my face...", "author": "Mike W."}

Once around the holidays, I walked into the Little Shamrock and all these friendly looking people started handing me cookies and candy and there was this crazy guy playing the piano and everyone was singing Christmas carols. That's the kind of place it is. \r\nI love the art work, there are lots of cool lamps and beatiful stained glass. I really dig that they have board games, as board games provide a fun activity when you are socially awkward, like me. Although the games are a little run down; I wouldn't expect Clue, for example, to have all the murder suspects, weapons, and rooms. But I have played a mean game of boggle here. This place is quieter than most bars, which I like because you can actually hear it when someone says something to you. And props to the popcorn.", "author": "Kathleen B."}

It was 2000, and to get there we had to strut from STATE on the 19th ave bus to Lincoln, and hiked over with our umbrellas. Did I say it was pouring that night? Wow, trenchcoat whether. When we walked in, I remember thinking how cool the bar looked, it's OLD. In fact, it's the 2nd oldest bar in San Francisco! Another thing I noticed, quickly, was that it gets so crowded! The last time I went to Little Shamrock, nothing changed. It looks the same as the first day I stepped foot, only this time the weather was better....it was just a slight drizzle :)\n\nDuring weekdays, You'll often find athletes having post-game drinks. It's where coed leagues like to meet up after playing their games. Speaking of games, there are various behind the bar that you can ask for, should the occasion suit you.

It's got old furniture, old popcorn, old bathrooms, and sometimes I ponder what I will be like when I get old while in here. This thought usually occurs when I am playing one of their old board games with missing pieces. Then I figure if I become an old drunk one day and don't like it I can stand in front of the old dart board (in the very, very, very distant future of course) and get taken out by one of their old patrons.

There are plenty of tables and comfy chairs, a dartboard, a fireplace, popcorn, cheap well drinks, and Boont Oatmeal Stout on tap. But what's really great about this bar is that it has a good cross-section of patrons. There are middle-aged groups of friends, med students, house painters, a fashionista or two, and MGD-drinking dinosaurs with flipped-up collars on their polo shirts. All in relative harmony, like those videos you see of the African savanna when there's been plenty of rain. The heart of this kaleidoscope of patrons, however, are the regulars: Old men with no teeth who come in every day of their lives and chat with the (totally stoned) bartender. Their teeth are like the board games here: missing a few pieces, but basically functional. And increasingly amusing the more you drink.", "author": "Ben P."}

What else...oh and the bar has a very authentic/historic feel to it (another reviewer already mentioned the grandfather clock that stopped ticking in 1906, right after the great earthquake).  So, the little shamrock is a great place to enjoy a few with some good friends, and think about earthquakes.", "author": "Mr. G."}

I enjoyed my New Castle and doing trivia with old Trivia Pursuit cards.  Only complaint is it's slightly dirty and run down but I guess that's what gives it its character...", "author": "Scott L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-02-10", "description": "Yeah, that's right.  One Friday night, instead of the usual go out, get drunk, dance, and stumble home routine; some of us decided to go out, get drunk, play games, and stumble home.  A very good time was had by all in this little bar far far away from where i live.  We all had headaches by the end of the night from games like set, apples to apples, scattergories, taboo, scrabble...  The waitress was a doll for dealing with a huge group of us taking over the back half ( it was only her 2nd day on the job) and the other patrons didn't get too pissed off there once we got there even though going to the bathroom became an obstacle course.  I drank Fat tire all night and it was cold, delicious, and well priced.  Since we were playing games all night, nobody got too drunk, and I believe I remember everybody's names (bonus).  Plus, the bar had a couple of t.v.s showing sports (soccer!!!)   So 5 stars for games, t.v.s, nice waitress, good people, and good memories.", "author": "John B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-03-25", "description": "Great laid back bar with a nice bartender...plus popcorn - gotta love popcorn.  Darts in the way back with an old radio that you can control makes it feel like you're in your own rec room - if your rec room had old couches and random (and obscene) chalk messages all over the walls.  There was an old Frogger video game that sadly did not work.  I wish they had more of a selection of beer on tap but they have a pretty good variety.", "author": "Sofia S."}

It's a tiny corner dive bar with lots of little games (i.e. darts, etc...) and the drinks are cheap.  There is tons of seating a free popcorn.
