Sun setting in the horizon of a magnificently blue Pacific Ocean, birds hovering over waves and zooming in and out of sight; I lost myself for a bit in this spectacular view. Pulled out of this wondrous reverie by the courteous greetings of our server allowing us to transform this panorama into something we could taste. We sipped on wine and chatted while waiting for our entrees. I ordered Bacon Crusted Scottish Salmon. Perfection.

Get here while there's daylight to take in the views that they're known for. \n\nWe ordered: \n-- sweet corn soup: a little garlicky, very rich texture, had a couple pieces of whole clams in \n-- wild white shrimp tempura: the sweet chili sauce was disappointing & generic, I liked that the picked cucumber & shallots cut through the fried heaviness \n-- sakura pork chop: moist & flavorful, nice pistachio parsley crust, neither of us cared for the cauliflower pur\u00e9e \n-- saut\u00e9ed scallops & wild shrimp scampi: texture of scallops were perfect - slightly firm with a brown crust from being left in the pan just the right amount of time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-11", "description": "Summed up in the fewest words, Sutro's at The Cliff House is a breathtaking view-romantic-modern-cuisine eatery. Having had the pleasure of dining here as the sun was setting over the Pacific, it was one of the most magical moments I have ever had. The combination of ambiance, elegance, and service makes this a remarkable place for tourists and locals alike. \n\nReservations are highly recommended during busy dining times as this place rightfully draws in a diverse group of visitors. During my visit, and even with said reservation, I still waited a couple of minutes at the bar while my table was being prepared. Patrons expectedly linger here as the view is incredible. The restaurant quite literally sits on a cliff and with the floor-to-ceiling glass windows it's as open and airy as a restaurant can get. Diners can enjoy their meal while looking at the crashing waves outside which certainly adds an extra element.\n\nAs for my meal, an order of appetizer and entr\u00e9e would be what I would gauge the restaurant on.  The Dungeness crab cakes is what I started with. Two pieces of crab cakes both topped and on a bed of chipotle aioli sauce was served with an arugula fennel citrus salad. The crab cakes, though lump as they were, had an exterior that was too hard. The hard breading didn't do the soft crab meat inside justice, as I felt they could have made it softer. The aioli certainly had a nice kick to it which melded well with the side of citrus salad--in a way cleansing the palate. Wanting a lighter entr\u00e9e after the heavy appetizer, I chose the saffron risotto. This dish, I must say, hit it out of the park. With the creamy risotto as its base, a combination of mushrooms, snow peas, and spinach were topped with parmesan, lemon mascarpone, and micro greens and drizzled with both an arugula pistou and agrumato olive oil.  As an avid carnivore, I would have no problem listing this vegetarian dish as one of my all-time favorites. The execution of the dish, the flavor combination, and the restrained elegance made every bite as savory as I can explain. The slight bitterness of the arugula pistou worked quite well with the saltiness of the parmesan and the hint of sourness from the lemon mascarpone. Not to mention the perfectly cooked mushrooms, which were meaty and satisfying.\n\nOverall, I would say that this restaurant is worth a visit when in the Bay Area. It was recommended to me by a colleague of mine, and after dining here I must say completely I agree.", "author": "Dexter V."}

If the restaurant sold it in a container, I would pick up a few!\nOther than our appetizer being put on another table's order, the service is good. It was entertaining that our server presented the appetizer and then mixed up the ahi tartare at the table.

Where else can you get views this gorgeous inside without suffering from the piercing wind and cold temperatures of SF. \n\nThe coffee is superb! It's most certainly what makes their Irish coffee one of the most requested drinks in the restaurant. Reflecting back I most definitely left with a caffeine overdose from how attentive the staff was at refilling my cup. \n\nFor Sunday Brunch I was craving eggs so I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and let me tell you that everything on this plate was FIRE! Not only does it come beautifully displayed in front of you with impressive culinary artwork but it carries such rich flavors that will have your taste buds screaming for more. Drizzled on top was a lime sour cream and a mole like sauce that enhanced the dish by tenfold. The egg was cooked over easy so as soon as you broke into it with your fork the yolk oozed over the tortillas, salsa, and beans, giving it a world-wind of flavors all at once. Oh and how can I forget the perfectly roasted chili on the side! Biting into that was delicious and not spicy one bit. \n\nOverall I had a great Sunday brunch experience at Sutro's.

Had a party of 5 for our friends birthday (she was in town from out of state) with a reservation at 7:30pm that was made weeks ago. 4/5 of our party was present at 7:20. As the host downstairs began walking us to our seats, she began complaining to us that \"the server will be really mad if the entire party isn't here.\" Ok then? So, as we're walking to our seats, we have to turn around back to the waiting area because we had \"the best seat in the house.\" AKA we don't want to seat you because your table is a prime photo spot lol.\nThis set the tone for the night. We explained to her that the 5th person was parking. She then changed her mind, sat us, and we wait for our server. Once our server arrived, he said to the table, \"where's the fifth one?\" No welcome, no how are you, NO HAPPY BIRTHDAY. For the remainder of our dinner, service was slow and we honestly felt discriminated against because of our age. We're a group of women in our twenties and yeah, we can afford our bill. We did not feel welcome here.\n\nIf you're visiting San Francisco for the first time, get ready to fork out an arm and a leg for the location.\n\nIf you're a Bay Area local, don't waste your time on this place.

If you happen to come by for a meal when it's gloriously sunny, you'll be treated to quite the uplifting mood lighting to complement an otherwise average meal. \n\nThe food plays second fiddle. Think \"cruise ship fancy\" but nothing truly imaginative. Started with a couple of apps. The shrimp tempura were plump but the sweet and spicy sauce was basically straight out of a bottle of Mae Ploy.  Pretty standard Caeser salad but our both orders looked like different dishes i.e. one the last scraps of a head of lettuce, the other fresh and bright green leaves - even the plating was different. Probably wouldn't have noticed if they weren't side-by-side.\n\nI had the crab sandwich for my main and it was fine. Interesting play on texture between the warm dungeness crab salad and the crispy fried soft shell crab although it felt a little one-note after a few bites. It comes with sweet potato fries. I think I had meal envy of those who got the crab Louie salad. Had dessert to finish the meal but honestly don't remember it much. Probably some molten chocolate cake and such.\n\nWe celebrated a birthday over Sunday lunch here and service was pretty great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-08-04", "description": "TL;DR - Views are okay. Food and service isn't great. Not worth the price or any price really.\n\nSaw Sutro's at The Cliff House on Check Please Bay Area and was excited to try it out. I made reservations on Open Table and requested to sit by the window for the views. Note to reserve on Open Table you have to put down a credit card and will be charged $25pp for a no show or late cancellation.\n\nWhen we go there I immediately noticed how cold it was. Sutro's is down on the bottom floor, but because the dining room opens to the top floor, the fact that they kept the front door open in the cold SF weather made the whole restaurant cold.\n\nThe decor is also very sterile and dated. Giant metal supports intersect all the windows so while you can see outside there isn't much ambiance.\n\nThe hostess was also terrible. Took forever for her to appear. When she finally did she noted she had a great window table for us, started grabbing menus, then stopped and said, actually I have two tables before you then proceeded to tell me she forgot it was 8pm not 6pm? What? She asked me if I wanted to wait 45 MINUTES for a window table with this giant grin, like it's your choice, up to you. I was just put off by the whole experience, of course waiting for 45min is not really an option. She was not sympathetic or accommodating. If the Cliff House wasn't so far from other restaurants I would have left right then and then. She then proceeded to seat us and try and sell me how every table has a view and just came off so fake and it was just irritating. I get mistakes happen but it's how you respond to it that counts and it's like she didn't care about our experience at all.\n\nOur server seemed nice but had a number of slip ups. We didn't receive water at all until halfway through the meal when I thought to ask for it. He looked down at the table expecting to see it and then flagged a bus boy to grab some. Everyone else in the room had water.\n\nMy husband also ordered the bread service (yes, you pay $2.75 for bread). That also never appeared and I had to ask for it as we were already finishing the appetizers. When I flagged to the waiter he again looked down expecting to see it then had to flag a bus boy.\n\nMy crab cake appetizer I had requested no aioli. It came out with aioli. I told the runner I had asked for it with none, and he brought a new one. I was starting to eat it and I noticed they had swapped the crab cake itself, but the salad and other parts of the plate still had aioli on it. Ugh, lazy. The server finally came around and I flagged and he said, his fault, and went to get a new one. My husband had finished at this point and I was still waiting for the food to come out as ordered.\n\nThe entrees were hit and miss. My husband had the Scottish Salmon (crusted in bacon). It was hot and flavorful. I had the scallops and shrimp. My dish was pretty terrible and it was fairly rich/oily I didn't feel well afterwards. First it was lukewarm, not even hot. The starch was an Israeli couscous, and had pine nuts which just tasted oily and was oil on oil with the oily cream sauce on it. Altogether it was just bland. The scallops were undercooked and my husband agreed it wasn't a great dish.\n\nWe went on a Tuesday and the wine bottles were 50% off which was nice, but the bottle we ordered was pretty terrible I didn't really want to drink it. \n\nJust so many misses that even though it was cool to see the water so close, wouldn't be something I'd return for.", "author": "Allison R."}

Absolutely.  \n\nDon't leave without having the tuna tartare.\n\nIf petrale sole is on the house special, get it.  It is one of the most well prepared fish we have ever had in terms of temperature, but just a tad overseasoned on the skin.  Server will debone the 1.5lb fish tableside.  The mushrooms potato kale accompanying the fish was also tasty.\n\nFor the duck prepared 2 ways, the duck was grilled well and seasoned well.  However, the leg meat came out mushy while the skin was crispy meaning it was fried well.  The butternut squash puree and green pea puree was very good, but the black pepper honey gastrique did not pair well with the duck.  Two separate flavors that was good by itself, just not great together with the duck.\n\nThe dessert here is special and worth the calories.  It is original, complex, well presented, and slightly on the sweeter side.  We loved the butterscotch pot de creme and the frozen lemon souffle with blueberries.  \n\nService leaves much to be desired.  Our water was refilled only once, after our entree plates were collected.  The busers knocked over a full glass of lemon water over at the next table onto the table cloth, chair, and all over the ground but did not dry it.  Instead, they looked around that the servers didn't see them and walked away after collecting the wares.  An older Korean man who is a server slaps his hand onto the table / menu / check when he wants the guests' attention instead of relying on his voice.  Over the evening, this became quite annoying as you can't help but notice the sudden loud clap or rude gesture.   Now onto rude, let's talk about our server Michael.  He:\n\n1) Never looked anyone in the party in the eyes.  As he speaks, he is looking over his shoulder or behind him to his other tables.\n2) he left us sitting for 15minutes without ever taking a drink / appetizer order.\n3) he walks away while you're mid sentence\n4) he drops down your plate / drink as he is turning his back away from you", "author": "Sandy C."}

The wine sauce did taste quite aromatic, however the combined sodium between the sauce and the marinate of the steak took away any flavor of the steak. For a brief moment, I wondered if the beef was not fresh and the kitchen tried to cover it up. \n\nThe lamb sandwich ($28): the lamb is lightly marinated and doesn't tasted that much. We wished the chef could balance the salt profile between the steak and the lamb. Dry bread. \n\nThe \"two\" crab sandwich: the portion size is abysmal - imagine the size of PBJ sliced into two halves. That's where the \"two\" crab sandwich come from.", "author": "Jiayi L."}

The city does an interview and the case was referred to The city and county of San Francisco Health Department about a week ago..DO NOT GO HERE****\n\nEnjoy the FLIES. FLIES IN EVERYTHING. Directly from the manager, 'We have flies in this building, were by the beach. There's Nothing I can do about it. Can I buy you dessert so you'll come back?' \n\nWe didn't get dessert; we got out asap. This place is disgusting. More about the manager below. \n\nI would outline the good and bad but the bad greatly outweighs The good.\n\n1. There was a fly literally dead and drowned in Caesar dressing. \n\n2. When the kid had a burger delivered it had a fly crawling on the mayo and outside the ramekin. \n\n3. A fly flew into our water glasses and STAYED. \n\n4. Flys on EVERYONES HEADS as we ate. (A fly flew onto my hands as I wrote this)\n\n5. Flys were crawling over the window to our left. \n\nYay flies!\n\n6. Now the food. The Caesar is watered down and sour-BONUS; it has flies in the dressing: YUM, PROTEIN!\n\n7. The SAFFRON risotto - has NO SAFFRON threads, nor color. But the server happily and excitedly lied that it was, \"like mixed in.\" He was banking on us not knowing what saffron was OR tasted like. Pictures included. Do YOU see saffron? Nope..cuz the dish we received was NOT AS DESCRIBED as on the menu. \n\n8. The bouillabaisse which was on the menu as having salmon, clams, mussels, halibut, shrimp and crab-WONT COME WITH CRAB AND HALIBUT. (Because it's the most expensive and this restaurant only cares about its bottom dollar). I asked about the halibut and crab missing when my dish got to me and was told 3 SEPARATE THINGS: 'the halibut is out,' 'this doesn't have the halibut,' and 'there was a mistake on the menu.' To which I asked, 'Why is it on the menu then?' And 'if the halibut is \"out\" then why is it ITSELF on the menu as an entree?' I received a stumped look and was asked if I 'would like a replated bouillabaisse with all of the seafood?' (Completely absurd question. I was asked if I wanted what I was paying for. Smh)\n\nWELL DUH???? This place is absolute trash. A woman and children in my party went to the restroom at 615pm (this joke of a restaurant opens at 5pm) and ALL FOUR ROLLS OF TOILET PAPER were gone-out-NOTHING. And so we're the toilet covers. \n\nThe manager had slicked back hair and looked really tanned/red. He didn't even bother introducing himself: pitiful. He said \"well I never even go in there..\" when we mentioned the restroom. When we mentioned the flies he was instantly annoyed and began making excuses that they were by the beach and 'we're in/by nature.\" --um, no..no we're not in nature; we're indoors. \n\nI have eaten at MANY fine dining, linen table places in my life and NEVER was I inundated with such filth as the onslaught of flies we encountered. The manager was unapologetic and literally said \"well there's nothing I can do about all the flies,\" and simply shrugged. \n\nWe wouldn't have gotten dessert despite it being free. It was probably seeded with fly bacteria and fly eggs since this pitiful excuse of a restaurant is \"by nature\" and \"by the beach.\"\n\nAbsolutely disgusting. \n\nBank on NOT getting what's clearly on the menu. The SAFFRON risotto-didn't have saffron and the bouillabaisse didn't have all of its described ingredients. And when we left, the menus were not changed out. The front of the house manager does not know what he is doing and is despicable to not make the bare minimum effort to at least check the bathroom and menus. \n\nGo somewhere else.", "author": "Gerald H."}

Great place to dine if you can get reservations before sunset and enjoy. Out reservations were a bit late so we went to the bar area to grab drinks, hang out and just enjoy the view of the sunset. Came here for the first time and definitely recommend trying at least once. \n\nThe drinks and food were okay. For drinks we tried a few; the Bloody Mary was okay even though I saw they had won for their signature mix but I didn't think it was that special. It definitely needed a more peppery spicy kick to it. The espresso something drink was really unique (pictured) as it had a pleasant taste...not too sweet and actually it was hard to taste the alcohol.  The Ramos drink was actually interesting kind of like a pisco with egg white so it was unique but there seemed to be a lot more foam than expected in the drink. We also had wine during dinner and it was a little pricey given some of the wine labels. They have a small selection of half bottle wines which tend to be the trend now. \n\nFor food, we had the lamb chops and New York steak. Both were well cooked, we asked for medium on the lamb and medium rare on the steak. They were cooked as expected; some places tend to over cook or under cook but ours were fine here. I typically don't order lamb because it can taste game-y if not prepared right but it was fine. I wasn't impressed with the veggie selection or potatoes that came with the dish though; was expecting something more refined and tasty. We got mixed veggies with the lamb and peas with the steak and potatoes with both. The other thing I would say is I wish they heated the plates so the food would come hot and stay that way for awhile. \n\nNice thing is they give you this cube of butter for each person with some type of chunky salt on top. Super delicious and too much butter to go with the bread so I saved it for my meat. The bread they give you is the sourdough kind you would get at Boudin. \n\nWe were celebrating a birthday there so they brought out a butterscotch pot de creme which was so good! \n\nOverall service was decent. We were expecting our reservations to get moved up due to how big the place was (which slightly did) but I also made reservations kind of late so it's expected that they get busy as there aren't many restaurants around there.  Parking can be difficult but there's plenty from the beach parking to the mountain to the area almost where lands end is.

The scallops were cooked PERFECTLY, in fact these were one of the best scallops i've ever had. Shrimps were big and succulent as well.

All of the roasted veggies/etc. should be good by all means but compliment the CRAB not overwhelm it, just didn't make it worth it.  \n\n(4) Refreshing cocktail - I can't remember the name of this damn cocktail, but it was so tasty.

It was inconsistent. \n\nThe bad: The pricey Kumamoto oysters were room temperature and served on a platter without ice. The steak frites was bad. It was rubbery and the sauce was unbalanced and overwhelming. \n\nNow that I think of it I should have sent the steak frites back. \n\nThe great? The tuna tartare is easily one of my favorite versions with the lovely Apple pear and the jalape\u00f1o infused sesame oil. The quail egg yolk lended a rich mouth feel that made the sesame oil linger on my palate a little longer. \n\nThat was so good I not only had it for my appetizer - after such a disappointing lunch entree that I didn't eat, I had it again for my \"dessert\" \n\nOrder the tuna tartare. It is glorious. \n\nHangar One handmade vodka, the pride of the Bay Area, recently released Fog Point made with Bay Area fog! At a well deserved retail price of over $100 it completely sold out in a flash. I was so sad I missed out because I drink Hangar One exclusively as I have since I first had their wasabi infusion way back when. \n\nI was delighted to the Fog Point here. \n\nParking wasn't challenging, the views are stunning, our server was outstanding. \n\nThe scowl faced rude blonde hostess needs to figure out what her actual purpose is. She was wildly unpleasant. I showed myself to the bar after being smugly told I can't be seated unless he other person in my party is present. \n\nReally? First - I hate that policy ESPECIALLY when parking in the city is weird. This building is on a hill. I wear high heels. I was dropped off at the door to avoid the perilous trek into the restaurant. \n\nSeating me wouldn't have been a tremendous financial loss. I guess looking at folks Open Table profiles isn't enough of an indicator. \n\nIt wasn't a financial loss as I ordered 2 drinks waiting an entire 3 minutes for my lunch mate to appear. Oh the inconvenience and financial devastation she averted *sarcasm* \n\nApparently it isn't a financial loss when the bill was $200 for 2 people to have lunch. \n\nLearn better customer service. Act like you value people handing you their hard money and never ever EVER scowl, sigh, or make snarky comments to the guest. \n\nHaving said all of that, I would recommend with two caveats - just don't order oysters or that steak frites and watch out for that rude hostess. She has the potential to start your dining experience off on ridiculously bad footing. \n\nOnce you are seated - enjoy the tuna tartare. Have a drink or 2, and enjoy the beautiful view. \n\nYou work hard. You've earned this moment of bliss.", "author": "Jennifer C P."}

In fact 90% of the evening was perfect. The hostess was gracious and friendly, assuring us that she'd reserved for us the best table in the house - which in fact it was. We were seated at a spacious table in the corner overlooking the bath house ruins. The food was outstanding - I had the bacon crusted salmon and am still dreaming about it. And the service was great - empty plates were cleared immediately, empty glasses were promptly refilled, and dishes were run to us quickly so everything arrived hot and delicious. Our waitress was wonderful - right up until we were leaving. A few of us threw in cash and my elderly mother covered the rest on her credit card. Well, I guess the dim lighting and the broken up bill confused her and she ended up leaving a less than generous tip (she's used to leaving the tax as tip which obviously isn't an ideal strategy in California). Rather than take it on the chin and chock it up to tourists being tourists, the waitress chased my mom down at the elevator to point out the lousy tip and asked her if she was sure it wasn't a mistake. My mom was visibly flustered and embarrassed and tossed an extra $20 bill at the waitress. I tried to intervene but mom just wanted to leave. While I agree that the tip was extremely skimpy, I found it in extremely bad taste to have the waitress shake down my poor old mom for extra cash. It put a damper on an otherwise perfect evening.

He told me the view was beautiful and the ambiance was relaxing. He was right! The window view is perfect for watching the waves come and go, especially beautiful on the sunny day we went. The host on the top floor were quite nice and instructed us to head downstairs for further assistance. The host down stairs was even kinder, making small talk and jokes before seating us in the perfect spot. (my boyfriend said you don't want to sit here because the sun will shine on you, she quickly responded the sun is already shining on her she's so pretty! So sweet.) \n\nThe decor is nice but simple, I was facing the bar with plenty selection of different liquors and beers. They also had a nice selection of wine in a book that looked a bit worn out. The bar has these tiny ceramic dolls as decoration that can be bought at the gift shop. They're so precious! \n\nAs for service the waiters are very attentive, they gave us fresh bread with butter on the side topped with pink sea salt. They consistently filled out water cups and didn't take too long to assist us with placing an order and bringing the food to us. I did notice some slight animosity towards the hostess from one of the waiters but it wasn't too obvious we were just right next to their work station. \n\nThe food was great, I wouldn't say it was the best though. For almost $40 for duck and $28 for a simple ravioli dish I would say it was ok, the view is definitely the selling point of this place. The ravioli was just ok I wouldn't go there again and get it for the cost. The duck was cooked to perfection and different parts of the duck was on the same dish. Skin was crispy, meat was tender, fat on the portion that had some was juicy but not greasy. I liked the huckleberry sauce that came with it but there was also squash and a green sauce on the dish I didn't care for, unfortunately it covered a lot of the plate so it was unavoidable. I would definitely order the duck again without the sauces but only on a special occasion or when I became upper middle class. \n\nAll in all it was enjoyable, the view was great, service was nice, food was acceptable. I'd love to come back at night to see the view. This is a great place for a special date, anniversary or business meeting. \n\nSide note: there's old bath house ruins right next to the restaurant with an unholy amount of stairs but it was nice to visit and go through the little cave.", "author": "Rita K."}

It was less stuffy than I had imagined from the pictures on their website. We had a large party and took up the longest table in the restaurant which has multiple floors.\n\nFirst, I must say that the service is that of a more highly-regarded restaurant. Everythingdone in excellence. The drive along the coast, where Sutro's is nicely perched, is beautiful and even from inside the dining room you are afforded a gorgeous view of the ocean.\n\nAs far as the good, I think Sutro's does a good job but could execute a little better given the price point. As a table, we ordered nearly every entr\u00e9e, and I chose the Duo of Maple Leaf Farm Duck, which was prepared medium rare default but which I upped to medium. I thought it was going to come with a nice little portion of butternut squash, which is one of my favorites, but no such luck.\n\nThe duck was fairly standard and was cooked well, although not overdone. The presentation was wonderful. As a table, we sampled a variety of whines (mostly oakier reds), and I particularly remember the Cliff House Sangria. I had my reservations about ordering sangria at a place like Sutro's that clearly does wine well but may not exceed in the sangria realm...and I wish I had ordered something else. It was very watery and not very flavorful, so I quickly switched to wine. Sutro's does have a diverse, fourteen-page wine menu that covers so many possible regions and tastes, so I definitely have to give them credit there! \n\nFor dessert, I had the butterscotch pot du cr\u00e8me, which was interesting. It was neither thick nor thin, but I would describe it as creamy. It comes with a thin wafer of some kind, which was a good little accent.\n\nOn the whole, I think Sutro's has the potential to be fantastic but falls more toward the \"average\" category for me.", "author": "Willie R."}

The remodel (several years back now) brought us a modern & swanky space.  Aesthetically speaking, the new space was a massive & major upgrade.  \n\nUnfortunately, the food is less noteworthy than the digs.  If you're looking for romance on date night, it will certainly deliver.  But the meal will cost you, & chances are you'll be left both hungry & disappointed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-05", "description": "Sutro's at the Cliff House is one of those restaurants that you save for special celebrations.  The views from the dining room, perched over the crashing Pacific waves, are gorgeous and the prices are expensive, as you'd imagine.  Our special celebration was my wife's 6oth birthday.  We arrived a few minutes before our reservation time and were seated almost immediately, albeit at a table not next to a window.  The service was friendly and efficient and our waitress and bread server where on the scene moments after we were seated.  I liked the ambience:  high ceiling, large picture windows overlooking the ocean,  and a sort of retro chic furnishings.   \n\nThe food was good but not great.  The a la carte menu is small with only a dozen entrees that  pretty much fall into the standard fish, meat, and vegetarian (pasta, risotto) options. We started with a bucket of mussels that was probably the best dish we ordered.  The mussels came in a large bowl smothered in a thick creamy sauce that hinted of garlic without being overpowering. I prefer the thinner, more liquid broth that usually accompanies mussels but this was good and quite nice for sopping up with the excellent dinner rolls (served at an extra cost.) I regret that we didn't sample the acclaimed popovers.   As a main course all four of us ordered the Scottish Salmon without the bacon. The portion was generous but the salmon seemed just a little bit undercooked to my taste.  Still, it was fresh and flavorful and flaked easily with the fork.  It came attractively plated,  sitting on a bed of pureed potatoes (ok but rather bland) and a mustard sauce that was pleasant but lacked the big flavor that I like in a sauce. There was also a small side of steamed spinach on the plate that was edible but unremarkable.   As I mentioned the plate was generous and filling.   For dessert we shared a lemon souffl\u00e9 that was quite nice with a delicate flavor and a creamy consistently.  A rich indulgence to say the least! I should also mention that the restaurant took the hint I left and brought us a special sliver of birthday cake (on the house) served on an attractive  platter with a candle and a \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate drizzle.  It was a thoughtful touch that my wife really appreciated. \n\nThe check for the table of four with one glass of house Chardonney (average wine at best) and the tip came to $240,  which is substantially more than I'm used to paying at a restaurant.\n\nSo was it worth it?  Overall I'd say \"yes\" because the positives outweighed the negatives:  the view was marvelous, the service good, and the food certainly acceptable if not extraordinary.   If you want to live it up in a stylish locale and are prepared to pay the price, I recommend Sutro's at the Cliffhouse.  But if you're seeking outstanding and creative cuisine above all else, there are probably better choices to be found in the Bay Area.", "author": "Robert B."}

Despite having made a reservation, there was a wait to be seated and then another lengthy wait before the food came. The food was decent overall but I was expecting a bit more bang considering the amount of buck. The staff also seemed bored. \n\nThe upside is that the view is spectacular. Instead of having a view of walls adorned by banal artwork or other people eating, as is the case with average restaurants, at The Cliff House you get to watch waves and the sun setting over the Pacific. I can also give them credit for a nice interior decor - something not bequeathed by nature. I'd suggest working up an appetite for dinner by taking a stroll at Sutro Baths or even Lands End if you have versatile attire. \n\nThe experience was positive enough that I think I'll give this place another try at some point and hope that more emphasis gets put on the food. I mean why not put in the effort to make a place like this spectacular?", "author": "Jake B."}

I will definitely be back here soon. \n\nMy parents last came to the Cliff House in 1982, and haven't been to San Francisco since. I moved here three years ago, and they kept telling me to try the restaurant, but I always assumed it was too touristy and didn't make an effort. They FINALLY visited, so my boyfriend made reservations for us all. I have to say I was blown away. \n\nThe restaurant is GORGEOUS! So many floor to ceiling windows, and water views everywhere you look. We had a 6pm reservation, and it was perfect. Though we couldn't snag a window table, we did have a relatively nice view. We got to enjoy the sunset and the live jazz band (every Friday starting at 7pm). They have an impressive wine list, and a long list of classic cocktails. \n\nThe food is a bit pricey $30-45/dish, but well worth it. The food surpassed my expectations, and I would go as far to say I enjoyed our meal here more than Chez Panisse! We started with the shrimp tempura, and our table ordered the halibut, salmon, and risotto. I enjoyed the salmon and halibut the most, and was not too impressed with the risotto. \n\nThe service was fantastic. It's upscale, but not in the stuffy snobby make you uncomfortable in your own skin kind of way. They all seem to be quite down to earth and it was refreshing. The furnishings are elegant, but not over the top. \n\nSmall irritations: they were rude when my boyfriend called and specifically requested a window table.

I asked my mother where she wanted to eat for her birthday and she said The Cliff House. I did not have high expectations for the food. So many restaurants with beautiful views serve up some pretty mediocre food. But, it was my mother's birthday after all. Still, after all the years that I lived in SF, I can't say I wasn't curious about the iconic Cliff House.\nMy mother invited a few family members, so I figured a reservation would be a good idea. Since Sutro's is the only one that takes reservations, I decided on Sutro's for lunch. We went down the stairs and into bright-white dining area with white table cloths, historical images on the walls, and floor-to-ceiling windows that look out onto the Pacific Ocean. \nSo now that I've dined here, all my preconceived notions have been confirmed. Choosing an entree was already a bit of a challenge, since the menu items looked rather mundane and uninteresting, and of course, comes with a premium price tag.\n\n$30 Two Crab Sandwich - warm dungeness crab salad, fried soft shell crab, root vegetable chips:\nThe shredded crab meat in the sandwich was very dried out. The sandwich desperately needed some type of dressing or sauce to bring it to life. The texture of the bread was soft, though. The plate came with colorful root vegetable chips, which were a touch stale, and some pickled carrots, which were too tart for me to enjoy on their own.\n\n$29 Steak Frites - skirt steak, truffled fries, bordelaise, red wine onion compote:\nMr. Joy ordered steak, which happened to be one of the safer choices. The slab of skirt steak was definitely on the petite side. It erred closer to medium well as opposed to medium rare, but that's something I can actually deal with. At times, I felt the red wine onion compote was a little too tart and overwhelming for the small portion of skirt steak. On the plus side, the truffled fries were thin and crisp.\n\nI honestly cannot recommend the food. The other members of our party seemed equally underwhelmed with their various dishes. Although there were no glaring errors, the dishes were not satisfactory. Maybe Sunday Brunch in the Terrace Room would have been better.\nHowever, our server was very nice and accommodating, and not to mention, very patient while taking orders from my indecisive family.

The food is always excellent and the service is always over and above board but not today! I did get to speak to Lisa one of the managers explained to her how shocked and surprised I was that the server was rarely around and I had to even insist on getting the check almost had to fight to get the check. I ordered a steak and never once did this individual come over and asked if I needed a steak Knife! Fortunately the chefs in the kitchen are above par and the steak passed a butter knife test because that's how I cut the steak! Sorry that the quality of service has gone down at one of the most restorical places in San Francisco so I'm definitely afraid that tourist will have to endure the same thing and think that that's the way we treat everyone that comes into San Francisco because there are some top-notch professionals in a lot of the four and five star restaurants in this great city of ours!", "author": "Jim S."}

So we came in for an early dinner, we didn't have a reservation, we were just in the area so we decided to have a nice romantic meal together. It would have been understandable if they couldn't seat us bc they were booked, I get that.. I have worked in restaurants for the past 8 years and currently work in fine dining myself, so believe me when I say I absolutely know how this works. The food was PHENOMENAL, hands down one of the best meals of my life, hats off to the back of house! I swear I still drool on thought of the tuna tartare.. absolutely amazing. service was great, no complaints there, fine experience for majority of the meal. Now, my boyfriend and I were there to bare no expense. We shared an app or two, each got an entree, cocktails, dessert, coffee... we should have been a good table for our server and the restaurant. And considering I'm a server and my boyfriend is a perfect gentleman, we always tip 20% or more. Here's what really had me shocked... they actually basically kicked us out of our table. They told us that they were sorry but they had reservations and really needed the table. I'm sorry but didn't you choose to seat us here ? Aren't we spending money? Yes, we were taking our time, after all this was a date. But I can tell you right now as a server, we were not \"camping\", we just ordered several courses! I couldn't fathom the idea of management allowing this at any establishment I have been employed by. There's really no excuse for that and the more I think about it the more I'm really infuriated that they would treat their customers that way. Needless to say I haven't been back. I would return though given the opportunity bc it truly is a beautiful place with amazing food and I'm sure that this isn't a common occurrence or experience. However, I hope that management has either been changed or has stepped up their level of customer service bc I was honestly mortified and like I said, still think about that experience today and shake my head at their lack of professionalism.\n\nI give three stars bc I am not here to bash this restaurant but I really want to bring this to the attention of staff and management and to warn others so if this happens to them , we will know it is not an isolated experience, Although I truly hope it was.", "author": "Danielle D."}

But luckily some frequent customers came in and sat at the other end of the bar so he helped them with their bloody mary drinks which he made in front of us so he kinda had to acknowledge us to look good in front of the frequent guests.  We told him it was our son's birthday - He checked son's driver's license because he is young. One would have thought he would have said \"Happy Birthday\"   I think he needed to get back to his guests at the end the bar.   Sutros teach your bartender to be nice to everyone. Common courtesy.   He gave us our drinks  -( I had a Tin Roof 2015 Hi Vista Sauvignon Blanc - yummy) and then he went down to chat with the other couple.  Couple was on their second bloody mary. This time he was able to totally not look at us to see if we were having a nice day.  Our table is now ready and I had to go down to the end of the bar to interrupt him with this couple to say we need to check out. I felt bad he was having such a good time.  - Unfortunately, he made us feel very welcomed. At this point we should have left. Bad vibes.\n\nSo we get our window table - nice view.  Thankfully it was a nice view because there was not a waiter in sight for a bit. We had menus so we could make out lunch decisions and then look around for someone to acknowledge we were there. And P. Chris did finally show up to get us water.  Watching him disappear.  then wait .  Saw him see us again - and remember he was getting us water.  We ordered our oysters.  They arrive.  Son doesn't eat oysters but i knew there would be bread to satisfy him. Only there was no bread.  Other people had bread.  So I had to ask for bread.  After a bit P. Chris brought the bread.  He must have been very busy on the other side of the restaurant.   Husband ordered a second drink Sazerac (love these at Cliffhouse they make it with Herbsaint- very New Orleans) Saw bartender make Sazerac and then it sat at the bar for quite a bit.  Other waiters got their drinks and my husband drink sat there getting warm.  Fortunately for us someone ordered a Manhattan.  And bartender sat it beside the Sazerac. Waiter  P. Chris when he finally realized he should get my husband's drink since we were now done with the oysters he picked up the Manhattan and served it to my husband.  He left we looked at the drink and saw the cherries and then had to get waiters attention to get new drink because he pick up the wrong drink.  This time bartender made a cold one and waiter served it up quicker. Kitchen served our lunches and all was well because the food was great.  Bacon crusted Salmon, Crab Louis salad and Lamb lamb sandwich.  Ask kitchen staff for more bread to have with lunch - first serving of bread was quite small pieces.  He returned quickly and we ate our lunch.  \n\nChris picked it up a bit for second half and retrieved our plates Got us dessert menus - My espresso came quite quickly.  I guess that the restaurant did not get the special occasion request from open table. Because we did not feel special.  Kitchen served my son's cheese plate and my sorbet plate.  The menu does not describe what is on each plate so it would have been good if someone came by to tell us about the wonderful cheese we were tasting and what the accompanying jams, fruits , nuts were.  Other restaurants provide a nice commentary with their food to make your experience more interesting.  Not Sutros.  \n\nSo recommendation:  If you want to spend $200 for a nice lunch for 3 people ( not including the bar tab in the lounge)  food is good - The mignonette sauce for the oysters is devine. The Crab Louis salad - grape tomatoes, avocado, endive Yum.  But, don't expect wonderful service from anyone. Come for the view be prepared to wait.   Wait staff are not engaging.  \n\nSorry Dan H.

Seal Rock was covered with pelicans.  About 45 minutes after we were seated they all took flight.  Our waiter, who we all enjoyed, told us to look out the window to see dolphins.  It was fun.\n\nThe restaurant had a decent wine list.  Some of the items on the menu were from local farms, including some from west Marin and Full Belly Farms, a personal favorite of mine.\n\nI had the chicken and dumplings.

He might want to stop saying that.  It was rather disappointing. It could have used drawn butter to add some flavor, a squeeze of lemon helped.  There didn't appear to be very much softshell crab.  Overall it wasn't worth the price.\n\nThe other two at the table had the skirt steak and they both loved it.\n\nThe table finished off with two desserts which I did not taste.

I guess it's like a waiting area for when your table is ready.\n\nThere is another level downstairs and the Bistro is on the left side. We saw people ordering food and drinks and asked the hostess. If we could sit down in there, she told us we could. So we decided to wait on the upper right side of the Cliff House. Rather then walk around or sit outside and just wait for our table. Hour and some change is a long time, so a table cleared up for us and we were on our way.. \n\nNote: Where we were seated, it has a beautiful view of the ocean and rocks ,it was perfect for my grandparents. \n\nOur server Hannah came up to my Granparents and I, very quickly and asked for our drink options. The menu that was given to us was a bar menu and had limited food choices. So we decided to order some appetizers for starters. \n\nMy grandma just wanted water and my grandpa wanted a coffee and I had a coke. Hannah came back with our drinks and we put in our order. We didn't want to spoil our meal later so at the time we thought . We wouldn't get full off the Pot Stickers for my grandpa and I. A cup of clam chowder for my grandma and a bowl of clam chowder for my grandpa. We also added some fries to the mix as well. \n\nNote: Hannah suggested that we try the pot stickers. She told us that they were her favorite.\n\nI will say this!!! The fries here are really, I mean really good here. That's something we all agreed on. My Grandparents really like the clam chowder. The pot stickers were pretty good and I had to take one for the team and polish off the rest for gramps. Yes Hannah you are right the Pot stickers were an excellent choice.\n\nAs time went on our reservation was ready to eat dinner. I won't lie my button up shirt was feeling a little tight. The fries did me in, I lost self control and killed most of them off. So I had no room in the BELLY. My grandparents were full too, so we decided to hold off on dinner and take a walk and go sight seeing. \n\nJust giving a shout out to our server Hannah, you did excellent that day with us. I love the fact when the sun was setting in and our area. The blinds got stuck and you pulled the motorized blinds down manually. So we wouldn't be in the sun. Thank you for that small but wonderful thing you did. Your service was top notch and love the fact that you always had a smile on your face.  \n\nSo my first impression of the Cliff House is a moment that I'll always hold dear too me. Like I always say good company and good food, go hand and hand. \n\nSincerely VD......ta ta for now......", "author": "Vincent D."}

They explained that Mother's Day Brunch reservations are open April 14th at 9:00 am and to call early to get a reservation.\n\nI called on April 14th at 9:14 am (right after the reservations were open) and went to voicemail. I left a message and explained I wanted to make a reservation, my party size, my phone number, etc. I never heard back. So, I called on Monday morning to inquire about what was going on since I never received a phone call from The Cliff House. This is when their disaster of customer service really hit. I explained what happened and the hostess basically said too bad and we can accommodate you at 4:30 pm for brunch. I explained that it is really awful that I followed their instructions and called on the date and time of the reservations being opened, and I have proof, and I never received a call back. I asked to speak to a manager.\n\nFrom there, the manager never got on the phone, but rather I was sent to a voicemail machine. Well my history with their voicemail response left me less than hopeful, but I decided to leave a  message regardless. Guess what? Never heard back from anyone!\n\nCliff house -- you not only missed out on one chance to fix the situation once, but twice. And you missed out on getting a hefty 7 person tab for the Brunch.

We showed up at about 3:25 pm in the afternoon, walked in and the host told us we had just a few minutes left to make it to the dining room for lunch.  We walked forward 5 steps or so; the group ahead of us got seated.  Lady at that stand said we are no longer seating for lunch. When asked well that hostess said we had a few minutes to get in. This lady (older lady black hair and heavy eye liner) made us point out who it was who said that and then said well they don't know anything, and she refused to seat us.  We went to the bar area, nobody greeted us, we found a seat and waited for someone to at least greet us or give us menus. It took 15 mins to have a waiter finally acknowledge us, pointed to a server (early 30's male, shaved head, black nike's with a big air bubble and some patent leather), said he'd be our server.  The server walked by 3 times, on the fourth I asked if we may please get some menus and some drinks.  He pointed to a menu on the table and said, \"You have menus.\"\nMe, \"Can I order from this menu because it says lunch?\"\nHim, \"No.\"\nTakes menu.  Then points at a different guy and said, he's actually your server in an extremely condescending fashion.  \n\nSorry for bothering you.  Actually, we're sorry we stopped in.  Great location, but if you don't want extremely snobby service.  Just go somewhere else.\n\nWe whisked down to the beach chalet, less than half a mile.

The food is priced rather highly. I was disappointed in their seafood pasta dish, Frutti de Mare, which had the smallest of everything in it. The dish came with scallops, shrimp, clams, and mussels. All of which were tiny. For the price I expected bigger seafood. We also grabbed an appetizer which was the crab cakes. They also were over priced for what they were. Two small crab cakes for $18.50. They were mostly breading as well. I'll finish off with caveating that all with the food was delicious regardless. I just expected a little more for the price.

My cousin had been wanting to eat here so I followed his lead.\n\nThe restaurants all have a stunning view of the water and there didn't appear to be too many other dining options in the immediate vicinity, so this seems to be the go-to spot, but I'm not a local so I don't know.\n\nWe started with the Kumomotos, which tasted super fresh and paired nicely with the champagne vinaigrette. We followed up with the Dungeness crabcake, which was light on the breading and heavy on the crab. Not too lumpy, but not too skimpy.\n\nFor entrees, we split the Thai bouillabaisse, followed by the Maple Leaf Farms duck breast. Both were delicious, but it felt as if the kitchen staff had to go all the way to Maple Leaf Farms in Leesburg, Indiana to find us a duck. Our waitress was kind enough to offer to split our dishes for $3/each and serve us in courses, but the serving time between the bouillabaisse and the duck had to be somewhere between 25-40 minutes. (Fortunately, my cousin and I had never previously met, but we were getting along just fine so this snafu was non-problematic.)\n\nThe restaurant made a great recovery by giving us the chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream, which our server claimed was made by mistake.

The louie sauce had an authentic San Franciscan flavor and consistency. This salad was particularly delightful because it came with fresh cut fruit. Unusual and satisfying. Worth skipping the Terrace room for. Would come back just for this.\n\nThe crab cocktail was also first-rate. Fresh cracked crab tasted like it just came off the boat.

That's how not good they were. \n\nWe did have a bowl of clam chowder. It was different. Not bad. Not amazing. It was dill heavy. \n\nFor our entrees we ordered the cioppino and the steak.

It boasts magnificent views of the coastline at a elevated height.  It is a very romantic setting and definitely a good way to soak in Northern California.  \n\nThe wait staff were friendly and attentive, not once did I feel rushed or pressured into ordering.  The drink menu alone was several pages..its a little overwhelming, however life is about choices and these choices do not disappoint.  Lots of local choices as far as wine and beer.  Their craft beer selection highlighted some of San Frans best and the 2 choices I sampled were excellent.  \n\nFor starters we opted for the crab cake.  I have to admit that this cake was one of the best i have eaten anywhere.  I have had crab cakes all across the NE and South as im from the eastcoast.  However, this cake takes it...no pun intended but this cake is the cake to take when its the cake thats taken!  The cake had a nice crunchy exterior which comes apart delicately, exposing the crab strands.  The chipotle aioli was a perfect compliment.  Not too spicy but subtle, especially when paired with the arugula and citrus.  It melted through every bite,  leaving me wanting more.\n\nFor the entree, i opted for the 28 day dry aged NY Strip which would have held its own in NY.  The texture was perfect, cooked to a medium rare delight, not too bloody, just perfect.  The sauce robert was an excellent pairing, however the star of the show was the organic potato creation.  Hands down the best iteration of any potato based complimented dish.  For that alone it deserved an additional star.  I tried the bacon crusted scottish salmon, but it was brief.  Every table member guarded their food respectively, allowing only the slightest tease to sample.  From what i had tried, it deserves a mention.  \n\nBy the time the desert menu arrived, i was full but can manage sharing a small dish.  I opted for the lava cake, which was rich in dark chocolate wonder.  It was a good take on this also ran dish, however its worth a try.

The sourdough offered at this restaurant was stale and clearly not fresh. The butter was difficult to spread as well.\n\nOut of the four items we ordered, the clam chowder was the only decent dish we had. The clam chowder wasn't even the best we had in the SF area. The Frutti Mare dish was below average. The pasta tasted like pasta you could buy at a grocery store and the seafood was NOT fresh at all. It definitely was not worth paying $30 for such a dish. The shrimp were tiny and the scallops didn't taste fresh, it was hard to chew. The clams were less than mediocre and the meat inside was very tiny. The lamp chops were extremely disappointing, especially since the price of the dish was so high. Not only was there so much fat on the bone, but also the sauce they used tasted like cheap barbeque sauce. The meat wasn't tender and the sauce wasn't incorporated into the meat very well. The only part I liked about that plate was the carb side that came with it; it had apricots and figs in it which I thought were pretty unique. \n\nHowever, service was amazing.

Brussels sprouts on the side were not as good as the simple ones I make at home. Its saving grace was the addition of crispy bacon on the plate, which pretty much saves any doomed dish.\n\nThe view is AMAZING. Ask for a table by the window, and if there is a small wait for one, it is worth it. We had a reservation and an inside table was available when we arrived but we chose to wait 20 minutes for one by a window and I recommend it. Have a drink in the bar while you wait and it goes quickly.\n\nService was SO BAD. I don't know how these servers get away with giving such bad service in a fine dining establishment. We sat down and were given menus, and then 30 minutes went by before we saw our server again, at which point all our drinks had been empty for some time and we had been ready to order for at least 15 minutes. The place was not even busy. It's not just bad service but bad business. She could have sold our party of 4 another round of drinks in that time and bumped the check up another $40 at least, which would have increased her tip.\n\nBasically, if you can stomach bad service and mediocre overpriced food, come here at least once to experience the beautiful ocean views. Highly recommend coming around sunset so you can see it happen while you eat.", "author": "Traci R."}

Literally situated on a cliff, Sutro's has HUGE windows, letting in tons of light and giving you a constantly beautiful view of the ocean and the rocks below. Now that it's colder out, they even have floor heaters near all the windows, to keep the chill at bay.\n\nI came here with my father for his birthday, and he was quite pleased. He went with the pan seared scallops, with heirloom tomatoes, rock shrimp, and clams, and ate every last bite of it. I stuck with the steak frites - skirt steak with truffled fries and a red wine onion compote. The quality of the steak was ok, not cooked rare, as I had requested, and a little tough, but good flavoring, at least. The truffled fries were delicious, and hard to stop snacking on.\n\nI had let the host know it was my dad's birthday, but my dad was too quick for them to bring out the celebratory dessert, so we ended up getting a second dessert as well. Both were outstanding, really. The waiter brought us a complimentary butterscotch pot de cr\u00e8me for his birthday (along with a signed menu), and it was perfect - smooth, creamy, not too sweet, although the large cookie sticking out of it was lackluster. The frozen lemon souffl\u00e9 was outstanding as well - light, not too tart, and delicious. I'm actually surprised more people haven't reviewed it.\n\nSide note: our waiter was outstanding, very personable, helpful, and friendly. If it wasn't for the service and the dessert, I'd probably rate them 3 stars (I've had better steak frites for less $$), but those two things really set them above and beyond in my book. \n\nHowever, I think I'd return for cocktails and dessert, not for dinner or lunch.", "author": "Claire S."}

Crashing waves, jutting rocks, sun - the view alone warrants a visit to the Cliff House.  We were able to walk in and snag a sit by the windows early Monday night.  Unfortunately, service and food was poor.  Given how well known this place is, I was very disappointed at the experience I had there.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, the waiter tossed the check on the table.  It was incredibly jarring; a negative note to end the meal.\n\nWe ordered the crab cake app and scallop & pork belly entree.  The crap cakes were small, topped with some kind of mango mix.  I didn't care for the mango, but it was easy enough to scrap off.  However, I felt that the ratio between the outer deep fried layer and crab cake meat was unsatisfying tilted towards the fried stuff.  There just wasn't a lot of crab!  The entree didn't get much better.   The scallop was overseasoned, while the pork belly was overcooked and a bit dry.  I like the fresh, light taste of scallops, but these were overwhelmed by the seasoning.  Also, you don't need to do much to make pork belly taste good (yum...fat), but the meat had less flavor than expected.  \n\nCome for the views and have low expectations of the food/service.", "author": "Elle W."}

Keep in mind that I'm not always the smartest, but when the belly starts a grumblin', if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right.\n\nSo, desperate for food and some draaanks, I did what any faithful Yelper would do and yelped for the nearest restaurant.\n\nThe closest place to eat was Sutro's at The Cliff House. \n\nAh- ha! \"I'm tired of all this walking. We'll go there!\"\n\nAs we scurried through the front doors, we were kindly greeted by the hostess and asked whether we wanted to be seated for an entree menu or just drinks and appetizers and that waiting for entree seating would take approximately 45 minutes, whereas for drinks and appetizers, we would be seated immediately.\n\nUh duh, I'm a sucker for instant gratification so I'll go with the drinks and appetizers to be seated immediately.\n\nWe were escorted into a nice dining area with windows spanning the size of the entire walls, and with great reason. The restaurant lookout carried out into the Pacific where you can see waves crashing onto the beach from the endless ocean, where the blue skies rolled on forever, and if you're lucky, you might even spot a whale spouting as it breaks the water's surface for a much needed breath of air. \n\nWe were handed our menus and I was fixated on creating this experience into a meal being that I was straight hangry. \n\nI went with the: clam chowder, cheese plate, fried calamari, potstickers, jumbo prawns, with me washing it all down with a delicious Bloody Mary while my friend opted for a Irish coffee and mimosa. \n\nEverything was presented very beautifully and tasted of the freshest and highest quality. I was actually very impressed and enjoyed my experience here. \n\nService was friendly and efficient. Despite being a busy day, she made us feel well taken care of. \n\nI will gladly come back to Sutro's at The Cliff House.

I was a bit skeptical considering this is a HUGE tourist attraction/destination spot on this side of SF.  I imagined sub par food, snooty service, and obnoxious tourists. In all honestly, I got the exact opposite.\n\nThe cliff house actually has three dining spots on Sunday\n1) The champagne brunch buffet (which you have to schedule a reservation way in advance). I hear it's pretty good but pricey ($55+/pp, and more expensive on holidays!)\n2) Bistro - casual dining. \n3) Sutro's - where we went. A little bit classier than bistro but you don't have to get dressed up. \n\nHonestly, the best part of Sutro's is the view. Big giant windows line the wall, with great views of the waves crashing along the shoreline, you might see surfers in the water. You honestly can beat the view of the Pacific Ocean skyline - 5 stars here. \n\nOur server was very attentive, she came by frequently and always check-in with us. Super friendly.  \n\nFood - I had the hangar steak which was made well and had good flavor paired with truffle fries (who doesn't love truffle fries). \n\nMy favorite part was dessert.  I had the butterscotch pot de creme while my sister/mom had the daily selection of sorbets (mango, raspberry and lemon). \n\nThe only drawback here was parking. It's on a hill so chances are you are either going to be walking up or down to/from the restaurant unless you uber/lyft it over. Area itself gets packed so if you find a spot close, it's like winning the lottery. I would recommend going early/late (and not during prime time lunch/dinner)", "author": "Phillip D."}

But, alas, how mysterious are thee!\n\nYou surely are a beautiful lass . . . but for a return visit I shall pass!\n\nWe made our reservation online a month in advance for February 24.  On the reservation form, I noted that it was our 20th wedding anniversary and we'd like a window table.  Clearly stated on the reservation form was that window tables cannot be guaranteed.\n\nTwo weeks in advance, I confirmed the reservation by phone and verbally requested a window table, if possible.  I was told a window table cannot be guaranteed, but it would be noted on the reservation.\n\nWe arrived at 6:10 for our 7:00 reservation.  It was a Wednesday night, and the restaurant was about half full.  I let the hostess know we were early, but it would be great if we could be seated.  I said we would like a window table and were willing to wait for one if it helped our cause.  She told us she had one window table request ahead of us (there was one window table available at the time), and she would seat us at the next one that became available.  I let her know we would be having a drink in the bar located adjacent to the restaurant seating area and the hostess kiosk.\n\nKiddies, here's where things turned decidedly southward . . .\n\nThere were zero customers in, or at, the bar, and we sat at the table closest to where the bartender was preparing drinks.  We sat.  And sat.  And sat.  After about ten minutes, I traversed the cavernous eight feet between myself and the bartender and ordered a couple of drinks.  The drinks were quite tasty.  The bartender, however, had zero personality.\n\nAfter about ten more minutes, a second window table became available, and a group was seated at one of the two tables.  I went to the hostess and let her know it looked like our promised table was ready.  She told me she had one window table request ahead of us.  Whaaa?  I reminded her of our earlier conversation and told her we just saw her seat people at a window table.  Caught in what appeared to be an exaggeration of the truth, she then told me she was not allowed to seat people that evening at the window table that was currently unoccupied.  Hmm.  Interesting.  I reminded her we were in the bar.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later (now there were two open window tables), she came over and told us the reservation she was waiting for didn't arrive, and she could now seat us at a window table as long as our drink tab was closed.  Of course, our drinks were long since finished at that point, nobody ever did check on us the entire time we were in the bar, so it was a moot point.\n\nHere are where things turned decidedly northward . . .\n\nSuddenly, it was as if we were transported to a different universe.  Perhaps the steps between the restaurant and hostess/bar areas have a \"good service\" deflector shield in place.\n\nOur server was attentive and entertaining, our drinks and food (Caesar salad, pork chop and salmon) were otherworldly delicious, as were our after-dinner coffees and passion fruit cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e dessert.  We were never rushed and thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience.\n\nUnfortunately, our overall total experience was three stars, at best.  The complete lack of attention at the bar, and bullsh*%t story and treatment we received from the hostess are reason enough never to return.  We were there over two hours, and the seating area never did get above 3/4 full, and there was always a window table available.  Thank goodness the experience within the dining area after we were seated was beyond five stars and rescued our anniversary dinner.\n\nFor the effort it takes to get to Sutro's and the lack of quality customer service, there are much better dining options in San Francisco.", "author": "Michael S."}

I said sure, why not. But as it started to rain whilst sitting in I-80W bay area traffic, I started to regret agreeing to dinner that would not be worth this commute time. \n\nWe had reservations at 630pm and were promptly seated near the window. For starters we had the foie gras and spinach salad, and I had the bacon crusted salmon, while my friend had the lamb chops. My salmon was better than average--because anything with bacon makes things tastier :D But my friend's lamb chops were perfect. He ordered it well-done, but it was still moist and flavorful. Moreover, watching the sunset disappear into the ocean over dinner made dining at the Cliff House more appealing.. \n\nFood would not be something I would return to here.

We ordered 2 appetizers, the oysters and the foie gras. The oysters were fresh. They serve it with some kind of vinaigrette. They should serve with some kind of wine sauce or cocktail sauce. The foie gras was not bad. Love the way they make their celery salad on the side. You can't really taste the celery.

What was supposed to be a really sweet dinner turned out to be a semi disaster thanks to raw porkchops. My husband surprised me by taking me to Sutro , both our first time here. The place was beautiful-- large windows, all overlooking the ocean. All seats had a nice view, and we were extra lucky we got to sit right by the window. We got to see the sunset, which was excellent. \n\nHubby and I ordered beer (for him) and wine ( for me), and also started with the braised mussels appetizer. The mussels were tender, and the broth had an excellent flavor, however it all started going downhill from there. I ordered the pistachio crusted porkchops, while my husband orders the Thai style bouillabaisse, and we waited a decent enough time for the food to come out. The presentation of the food was good, and my mouth was already watering upon seeing the thick cut porkchops. As soon as I cut into meat though I saw that it was practically raw on one side, and cooked on the other. It kind of reminded me of ahi tuna because the inside was really raw, while the outside was done. I didn't think anything of it, no biggie, and just asked our server if I could have it cooked a bit more. We waited around 20 min or so for my food to come back, and when it did I was completely confounded. The pork chop that came back was not mine- I only took one teeny bite of the porkchop seeing as how raw it was, and didn't even get the chance to eat any of the veggies nor the pur\u00e9ed cauliflower. What came back instead was a butchered tiny piece of pork, cut on all sides, and only had a few pieces of vegetables and practically no pur\u00e9ed cauliflower. The porkchop that came back looked as if someone had eaten the cooked sides of the porkchop, leaving only the middle. I then heard the server talking to the table behind us asking if their porkchop was still raw. This is when I realized that they must have switched our food, seeing as both were raw and returned to the kitchen. I snuck a glance at her dish and saw that it roughly looked the same size as how I left mine. I called the server over and explained what I thought happened, adamant that I did not eat any portion of my food, and that this was someone else's dish but he insisted that it was mine and that they base it on table numbers. I said this mishap was very probable since our tables were so close together, and the busser could easily have been confused but he said it was not likely to happen, and that the pork just shrank because it was cooked more. I understand food shrinks when cooked, especially due to the fat being rendered, but the thing is I left my food completely uneaten (aside from one slice I made to check how raw it was in the beginning), and what they returned to me was a 3/4 eaten piece of porkchop. The server did ask me if I wanted a new one, but by this time, I was just over it and asked him to bring me a dish that wouldn't take as long to cook, especially since my husband wanted to wait for me to eat and his food was already cold. He suggested the mushroom ravioli, and it came in about 10 minutes.\n\nOn a funny note, the guy beside me also got the porkchop , and he started raving about his, saying how it was the best porkchop he's ever eaten. My husband and I couldn't hold back our laughter cause there I was eating my ravioli, missing out on the worlds best porkchop lol wish I could have eaten mine! Also on the plus side, the server did try to make it up by bringing us some butterscotch pot de creme, and I was very appreciative of it, but he was only apologetic about the long wait time and not the whole mishap that happened. We took a few bites of the dessert and left shortly after. Sutro, you left me very disappointed and ruined what was supposed to be a rare date night for me and my husband.", "author": "Bunny B."}

However, yesterday we were really disappointed. Our Bloody Mary tasted bland and it lacked the proper amount of alcohol. It tasted like tomato sauce and water, with a little horseradish. My husband's Sangria was mediocre. Our dinner selections were caesar salad, bacon encrusted salmon on a bed of spinach and mashed potatoes, yukon gold potato/ leek soup, and foraged morel mushrooms risotto. The bacon encrusted salmon was disappointing--the bacon was not visible and the flavor was nonexistent. The mashed potatoes' flavor was solely salt. The salad and soup were delicious. However the risotto was dry--not creamy--and hard. The one piece of mushroom I tasted was also flavorless. I've tasted Rice a Roni with better flavor! Needless to say, we sent the risotto back. I mentioned the lack of flavor in the Bloody Mary and the entrees, to our server. He offered to remake both, however, we declined. We don't much trust having drinks or food remade after a criticism. When our bill arrived ($97), the risotto was removed from the total--I only took two bites--but there was no compensation for Sutro's failure to provide a good dining experience. An occasional bad drink or food order is not unusual. However, when the majority of an order is lacking flavor, it's not a good sign. Paying $100 for an unsatisfactory meal is unacceptable.

The food is above average, yet so is the price.  Yet I still find it worth the visit for a special celebration.  Service is generally good, depending on your waiter.  Today my friend and I both chose the Crab Louis salads as entrees.  Loved that it included Belgian endive and arugula, yet there could've been more crab.  This is their priciest entree.  The Newton Cabernet, as recommended by the waiter was excellent.  No wonder our bar tab was more than our food bill!\n\nI love coming here for special occasions.

I haven't had raw oysters in a long time. This made my night. \n\nAhi Tuna Tartare- pine nuts | asian pear | mint | quail egg habanero infused sesame oil-didn't taste the spicyness to this, but it was fresh, light, and great flavors. You eat it with the same crackers as the charcuterie plate. \n\nDungeness Crab Cakes- chipotle aioli | arugula fennel citrus salad-2 small pieces, but perfectly crispy and enough crab meat. \n\nArtisan Foie Gras au Torchon- aged balsamic | celery-apple micro salad late harvest riesling \"jello\"-I asked if they can torch it off so it's more of a seared foie and it was amazing! \n\nWhite Gulf Shrimp Tempura-sweet chili sauce | cucumber | pickled shallots-it's not Japanese shrimp tempura. It's big whole shrimp fried lately on the outside, but still super crispy. Loved it. \n\nBacon Crusted Scottish Salmon-pink lady apple | full belly farm rainbow chard potato pur\u00e9e | whole grain mustard sauce-this was the worse dish of the night. I didn't know until my dad gave me his last piece to try. It was super dry and over cooked. I'm not sure why my dad didn't say anything, but I think he was enjoying all those yummy appetizers. \n\nThai Style Bouillabaisse shrimp | clams | mussels | salmon | halibut | crab red curry coconut shellfish broth-this had a lot of seafood. The broth was good, but I felt like it was missing something. Maybe some spiciness would have made it that much better.\n\nDay Boat Scallops & Gulf Shrimp Scampi-saffron couscous | pine nuts | parsley jus-this was delicious.

It was so flavorful and not mushy at all. \n\nDuo of Maple Leaf Farms' Duck-roasted breast | confit leg | butternut squash pur\u00e9e\nhuckleberries | black pepper honey gastrique-very tender.

The Cliff House is a standard tourist attraction in San Francisco. It is impressive both on the inside and outside. With a superb location where you can see the waves crash amongst the sands while you dine on seafood.\nNow, for the food portion. Since this is considered fine dining you won't find anything under $30 dollars on the menu, or massive portions of it. Our table ordered the Tuna with a quail egg for appetizer, it was tasty and was served with thin peta chips, sf delicious. For my entree I had the crab ravioli with artichoke. It was flavorful, and left a wonderful after taste after each bite. Lastly, for dessert, I had the chocolate lava cake with a scope of coffee ice cream on top. I do not care much for coffee, so I'll leave that out of my review. The cake was mediocre, I was expecting it to be a bit undercooked in the center, but I suppose the ice cream blocked most of that 'lava' effect.\nIf you fancy yourself a cocktail you must try their specialty drinks. Sure, they have all the standard cocktails but they have plenty of old fashioned drinks such as the boxcar. I had about three cocktails there, and felt no pain afterwards.\nParking can be a bitch there because it is on a hill with a blind corner, in any case you have nice view as you walk towards the restaurant. The prices were pretty steep, our bill came out to be over $300 for three people, be ready to spend big. The Cliff House may not be for everyone, because it tries too hard to be fancy but it's worth a go for anyone visiting San Francisco", "author": "Joel G."}

My husband and I live in FL and we vacationed in San Fran the first part of August.  We made a reservation for Sutros at the Cliff House for July 30 @ 6:30 PM for just the two of us and requested a window table.  Now I know window tables are not guaranteed but they take preferences.  We arrived at about 6:20 and checked in.  The hostess there that night went on break after we checked in.  She turned her station over to Dana (I think he was one of the managers).  She briefed him of our arrival and told him we requested a table by the window.  While she was on break,  there were about 4-5 couples that came in without reservations and Dana sat them at window tables.  We remained patient.  After about 30 minutes (6:50), we asked Dana how much longer we would have to wait and reminded him we had reservations.  He was very condensending and acted annoyed that we asked.  About that time, the hostess came back to her station and apologized to us for making us wait.  If it wasn't for her return and trying to make things right, we would have left.  I had high hopes that the food would make up for Dana's attitude but it did not.  It was so unmemorable that I don't even remember exactly what I had.  I do remember it was a fish dish.

I've passed by The Cliffhouse many times during my past visits but never got the chance to try it until today. The entrance of the building leads into the Bistro portion of Cliff House, which is a brunch styled restaurant. As we decend downstairs to the bottom of the building, then we finally enter the actual Sutro's restaurant and wow, I must say it looked beautiful. The windows as they say are really large and give a beautiful seaside view as you enjoy your dinner. The first thing that came to our table was the interestingly shaped french bread with a seasoned salt butter. The taste of this particular butter was delectable! Be careful for just taking the salt portions as it can be salty, obviously. We then received our wine, a Chardonnay and a Riesling. Unfortunately, I can't remember the years and brands but overall, they were good. \n\nFor our main courses, we ordered the Caesar Salad as an appetizer and then the Sakura Pork Chop & Duck Duo. The Caesar Salad was like any other Caesar salad but actually quite delicious and well presented. For the Sakura Pork Chop, the pork was medium rare and soo juicy and tender. The dish came along with brussel sprouts and I believe potato slices, topped with pork kindling and a crisp slice of bacon, all with a delicious sauce on the side. The Duck Duo was served well-done to my friend's preference and served with a delicious butternut squash puree and huckleberry puree. It was AMAZING. The duck was prepared perfectly and not too dry and when mixed with the puree, it was like heaven. I would definitely refer to ordering this dish. It's not literally called the Duck Duo but something close. Presentation-wise for both dishes: excellent and well done.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a Passion Fruit Creme Brulee. Presentation was good, looked like any other creme brulee but topped with small pieces of passion fruit. Taste was delectable, creamy like a perfect custard, and mixed with the hint of tangy passion fruit. For those who love passion fruit, I'd highly recommend getting this dessert with a side of Moscato.\n\nIn conclusion, the overall service of this place was stellar. Friendly, observant, and always making sure you have a great experience at a phenomenal area of the Bay. The food quality and presentation here was truly exceptional with nothing really to say that stood out in a negative manner. How do I feel after dining here? I would have to say it was one of the most memorable, best birthday dinner I've had in years. I would highly recommend coming here for any fancy or higher end occasions, whether it be birthdays, dates, or simply a meet up of good friends.", "author": "Al B."}

Since my friend is a vegan for health reasons, we decided to split the risotto, asking if I could get the cheeses on the side since they were the only non-vegan ingredient.

Even topped with a soft blue cheese they were boring, boring, boring. \nThe steak was dry aged 28 (?) days. It had a nice flavor but the plate overall was also deadly boring. \n\nThe Ravoili with peas and mint was ravioli in a creamy sauce with spring peas and a few sprigs of mint.

Turns out they have another room that was also nearly full, but we got front row seats to the sunset view without even asking!\n\nService was nice and friendly, and I could tell my waiter had been doing this for a while--competent and even had all his own phrases to substitute for normal waiter questions. I said \"we'll have the corn soup,\" and he split it in half for us! Very sweet. \n\nDuo of corn soup was really good, but we love sweet corn so that may be why--it's all you can taste! My Alaskan halibut was dry and unflavorful, but the risotto, vegetables, and sauce it came with were really good! My boyfriend enjoyed his salmon too, but we both thought the corn soup was the best part.", "author": "Kimberly Y."}

In this league it can be a champion in terms of food and service. However, if one disregards the history, the ambiance, and the views, it is quite pricey for the food and service offered. The food and service  are both merely good, not excellent - thus the four stars. The food was inconsistent: duck duo excellent, whole fish quite bland, foie gras plate had a large piece of foie gras, but the preparation was underwhelming. \n\nThat said, interior design is great, views are to die for, the location is excellent, food will not disappoint, so I recommend to visit - for a complete enjoyment just make sure you start your visit before sunset (no views in the dark), overlook the minor flaws in the service and don't mind the price tag (about $100 per person). \n\nEarly dinner on Sunday was possible without a reservation.  Most tables have at least few seats with a good view; tables by the windows are taken early.", "author": "Dmitri V."}

Were certainly hungry! I was always hesitant to come here, thinking it was too 'hoity toity' for my taste. But, I had my daughter with me, hours to kill (at the beach, no less!) and growling stomachs. So, we stopped at this place! Dressed in jeans and sweaters, we walked in and were greeted right away. Asked for a window seat and spent time perusing the gift shop waiting. 10 minutes later,  we were seated in the Bistro with our waiter taking our drink orders. The view was amazing! No one seemed to mind our casual dress (most everyone were just dressed up versions of a Saturday morning breakfast dive group anyway. Mind blown!). \n\nNow, the food. Coffee, very good (coffee snobs out there). And those puffy bread things!!! Clouds from heaven that you slather butter on and eat (though, butter was straight from the fridge and the fluffy delights were crumb disasters - still good). I ordered the Eggs SF and daughter ordered Classic Eggs Benedict. Both came with same sides of roasted golden butter potatoes and fresh fruit. \nDaughter ate all of her food and seemed to really like it. My food, however.... The bread the poached eggs came on seemed to be the end of the loaf, almost too toasted to even cut (I briefly wondered if it had been from the day before, just reheated?). The brandy sauce was pretty flavorless and the Dungeness crab sprinkled onto the whole thing ... Well, it was fabulous until I got my first bite of crab shell. Then another and another. I finally just stopped eating and wished I'd gotten what my daughter had gotten. Not terrible tasting. Just bland. And the shells really bothered me. The potatoes had a very slight frozen flavor quality about them. I can't imagine they had been frozen and reheated, right? The fruit was so delicious and sweet! Strawberries, grapes, red and green melon. Yum!\nThe whole time, there were more than enough staff to ensure that our drinks were filled at all times.\nIn the end, the total tab (minus tip) came to 47.24. Pretty steep for the breakfast we got, but the experience was well worth it!! \n\nWill go back someday but will order differently. Giving 3 stars because of my meal.", "author": "Christina H."}

I think the environment at Sutro's is probably actually nicer and quieter than at the bar/restaurant upstairs. We hung out at the bar for a bit, ended up having a couple drinks each and chatted with the bartenders. Both ladies were very nice. Turns out Sutro's serves egg white beverages, something that not many places has.\n\nMy first drink was the French 77, a champagned based beverage with St Germaine and lemon juice, that was incredibly refreshing. It was the perfect drink to sip on, as I soaked in the beautiful view. My second drink, was a signature, the Ramos Fizz. This was an egg white drink with half and half among other mixers. I had to try it because it's what they're known for; however, I'm not much of a person for creamy drinks, so this wasn't exactly my thing.

We sat right against the window overlooking the ocean and couldn't take my eyes off of the water. \n\nI waited 15 minutes for my appetizer and drink. The appetizer was oysters on the half shell. Despite the wait, I dug into them greedily. The waiter said that it was \"imperative\" that I try the tequila-lima mignonette so I did with much gusto. It was vinegar, plain and simple. The oysters themselves were \"Olympian\" I think from Washington and the literally the size of a nickel. All in all, extremely unimpressive. \n\nOur main lunch came. Chris and I got the \"two crab sandwich\" and it was pretty darned good. Chris said it was a \"legit\" crab sandwich.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-14", "description": "I have been waiting.  I have been searching near and far.  I have put dozens of reviews on hold.  Why? Because this is.....\n\n!!!!!~REVIEW 300~!!!!!\n\nNow for review 300, I would love to be writing a Valentines Day review about how I got 300 half naked Spartans all fighting for my honor and glory.  That would be very sexy...and slightly overwhelming....but fortunately, you won't have to read about steroid and Photo-shop enhanced men.  Instead, it is a review about a restaurant that used to be a bath house.  Hey, still sexy right?\n\nThe Atmosphere:\nThis feature alone should be give the place 5 stars!  The decor is light and airy with ceilings that go on forever.  The ocean side wall is just one huge window so you can take in this beautiful scenery.  No amount of interior decorating in a small cramped restaurant downtown can ever be as breath taking as this view of the ocean.  Romantic evening, planned a month in advance for V-Day weekend, we were seated in the main room right next to the window that overlooks the ocean.  Watched the sun set over Ocean Beach, sipping excellently crafted cocktails, and enjoying our appetizers.  This place had ambiance oozing out of every pore...no Spartans though...\n\nThe Service:\nOur server was a little spacey but very sweet and accommodating.  The bus boy got switched out from our area...I think he was menstruating... (totally unlike a Spartan) but once he departed, our evening service was acceptable.\nThe Booze:\n\nItalian Greyhoond--\nAh I love my grapefruit and vodka together. This is especially delicious with some soda water fizz and a healthy pour!\n\nV-Day Special Drink--\nSparkling wine with rose water and a candied hibiscus at the bottom! So pretty, romantic, and TASTY (most likely like a Spartan?)\n\nThe Food:\n\nAhi Tuna Tartar--\nFoodgasm!!!!! Presented in little piles of goodies (pine nuts, chili peppers, sesame oil, onion) surrounding the main attraction (high quality diced tuna with a quail eggie on top) the server (and my man) patiently waited for me to snap my yelp picture before stirring it together table side.  I took my time consuming this delectable dish...I want some more of it even now!\n\nField Green Salad with Passion Fruit Dressing--\nSimple and healthy, this dish had an added flare of romance as it had a ton of edible flower petals mixed in with the delicious and flavorful dressing.\n\nScallops and Pork Belly over mashed parsnips and butternut squash--\nThe scallops were HUGE and cooked perfectly.  The Pork Belly was crispy and the whole thing came together a lot like scallops and bacon.  The parsnips and butternut squash were very simply prepared to star the meats, though I think they could have had a bit more flavor, since they sort of got lost in the boldness of the meats.\n\nRolled Chicken over mashed potatoes with brocolini--\nSO MOIST!  I though the flavors could have been a bit more bold.  This seemed a little monotone.  That being said, the man loved it.\n\nChocolate Souffle with a Glass of Port--\nChocolate Souffle was done perfectly.  Rich dark chocolate that poured out of the cake like molten heaven.  The hazelnut ice cream was so good I could have eaten a bucket.  It was sweet but not too sweet and was richly hazelnutty.  Paired with port, what more could a girl ask for? (Maaaaybe a Spartan)\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nWhen it comes to a romantic evening such as Valentines Day, it is massively important that not only one enjoys the food that is being consumed, but it is important that the atmosphere encourages the celebration of the person you are with and makes you feel the love wafting through the air.  This night was so amazing that I forgot all about the rest of the world and could only see my man, who is a hero to me. (Maybe he was a Spartan in another life?)", "author": "Susan C."}

We were actually aiming for lunch at the Bistro upstairs (after nixing the Beach Chalet down the street cause I just couldn't bear another burger/reuben menu, so, so boring). The Bistro had a 50 plus minute wait--they don't take reservations though I can't imagine why not when they charge $16 plus for their egg dishes etc. Anyway the Sutro which is the fancier option downstairs didn't have a wait, so that's what where wound up. It's more quiet down there too--kind of a zoo upstairs. But that's what you get for going to a tourist mecca. The food options at the Sutro are varied and good. There's some creative cooking going on. One person had a crab two ways number that was really quite good--soft shell plus a crab salad but they they added over-oiled sweet potato fries to this and took it down a notch. I had some shrimp tempura with a pickled vegetable garnish that would have been good had it been more hot and crisp instead of slightly soggy and leukwarm. The third person ordered scallops with couscous which was very nice indeed, best dish of all. Butterscotch dessert to share was well done except for the soggy cookie they served with it. Crispness seems to be a missing skill here. We all had wine and the bill came to $137 for lunch. If we are going to pay this much for lunch I would rather you did everything perfectly, hence the three stars.

While it sounded enticing - warm crab salad AND fried soft shell crab with a side of \"root vegetable chips\" turned out to be a lukewarm, semi-dry sandwich with a side of store bought Terra blue chips. \n\nService was also fairly slow, it took quite some time to get our food and drinks however our waiter, Roger, was excellent.

We watched whales spouting and whale tails during our early dinner. We found the waiter recommendations helpful. Casual dressy. Relaxed vibe. So happy to start at 5p. Earlier than usual but the setting celebrates the sunshine. Great cocktails. Delicious Kumamoto Oysters on the Half Shell with champagne vinegar mignonette. Saffron & Roasted Mushroom Risotto with bloomsdale spinach, reggiano parmesan and micro greens was cooked to perfection. The flavor of the Pan Roasted Petrale Sole was sensational (and portion was enormous). True confession? I wouldn't have ordered sole if I had understood that it was served whole with bones but the waiter's removal of the bones was impressive. Note: Its side dish of braised mushrooms, pearl onions, fingerling potatoes, bloomsdale spinach and lemon parsley beurre noisette were worth the order. It, alone, would make the most discriminating vegetarian wildly happy. (The table next to us had the Bacon Crusted Scottish Salmon, which looked beautiful, and they raved.) We decided to exercise restraint and not order dessert. But, again, the table next to us squealed with joy after ordering what appeared to be one of everything.

I believe the food is a little bit more fun upstairs at the Cliff House. Though, obviously, the food at Sutro's is very well prepared. The downside to the Cliff House is you frequently have to wait to get a table. Downstairs at Sutro's is by reservation only, so as long as you have made one in advance, you are all good. My suggestion is to make your reservations near the time when they open for breakfast or dinner. By doing this, you are assured of getting a table by the window so you can take in all the beauty of the coastline and don't have to view it over the tables of the other guests.", "author": "Scott S."}

I wasn't entirely clear at first what the difference between Sutro's and the Bistro was, but ultimately decided that Sutro's was the more upscale of the two and more appropriate for the occasion. \n\nWe made reservations on OpenTable, but it was pretty empty on a Monday night when we arrived. It wasn't obvious where to go when inside and the woman at the front desk was less than helpful in showing us in the right direction. We finally were able to figure out that Sutro's was downstairs so down we went and we got our table right away. Not knowing how busy it would be, I had requested a table by the window and this night there was no issue with getting one, however our view was solely of darkness (thanks, Daylight Savings). \n\nOur server greeted us fairly promptly and we ordered a bottle of wine however when it arrived we were informed that their freezer was broken and that the wine had to be chilled for a while before we could drink it. Not a huge deal but slightly annoying and just expected a tad better from such an upscale establishment. We were served sourdough bread and butter which was warm and delicious! For dinner my sister and I both ordered the duck and my mother and stepfather split the halibut. Duck is one of my very favorite meals and I have a hard time resisting ordering it anytime I see it on a menu and this was one of the best. Great presentation and just amazing flavors. We also ordered the ginger creme brulee which had the perfect amount of candied ginger to give it a kick while stilling being deliciously sweet.\n\nThe only reason that I feel like I can't give Sutro's at The Cliff House 5 stars is the service was just a bit sub-par. I have worked in high end restaurants before and know the do's and don'ts of customer service. Several things that jumped out at me: no black napkins (though the white ones didn't seem to shed that annoying lint all over my black pants); as another Yelper mentioned, servers and busboys put their hands on the tops of the plates when delivering them to the table...gross; our table was bused before everyone in our party had finished their meal. These are pretty basic restaurant procedures and I feel like when you are paying top dollar these are things that you expect without question.\n\nSince my only real issue was sub-standard customer service (keep in mind - for a high end restaurant), and I was extremely happy with my meal, I would recommend Sutro's to anyone for a nice night out.", "author": "Emma B."}

We sat at the bar and admired the view and the interior design, in addition to the really cool female bartender behind the bar.\n\nSo last Friday after a great afternoon in Golden Gate Park, we decided to drop in again to have dinner.  We didn't have reservations, and unlike our prior visit the restaurant was busy.  Our bad for not having booked reservations on a Friday during the height of tourist season.  We did ask the disinterested hostess if we could be put on a waiting list to be seated for dinner in the event of a cancellation.  She said that she would do so.\n\nWe were lucky to get a table in the bar area.  Not a good table, but at least we were able to sit and have a drink while we hoped that something would open up in the dining area.  About ten minutes later, two women came into the bar, and they also, like us, had come to Sutro's at the Cliff House without reservations but wanting to have dinner.  But they did what my wife and I didn't do:  they pitched a fit about not being able to be seated in the dining area.  They complained to the hostess and then to the manager.  And they were accommodated.  So note to anyone who wants to be seated at Sutro's if you don't have a reservation and they are fully booked: don't be polite and respectful like my wife and me.  Be aggressive and pitch a fit.  You'll be accommodated.\n\nSo we ordered dinner at our crappy table in the bar area (we were having such a nice day we didn't want to use the same tactic as the two women).  Our waitress was indifferent (sense a theme here?) and not very friendly.  We had to flag her down for everything.  When we got the dinner menu I asked her if there was anything in addition to what was on the menu.  Though she said no I had to flag her down a few minutes later to ask her what the fish of the day was.  She could have given me that info when I had inquired earlier.  Very indifferent service.\n\nI ordered the Caesar salad and the halibut.  The salad wasn't good at all.  The dressing was mayo-based and heavy on the mayo with imbalanced flavors.  The halibut, however, was delicious and very well prepared.  It was a small consolation to a highly disappointing dining experience.  \n\nI'm giving Sutro's at the Cliff House one star for the indifferent service.  I guess because the views are so good they don't have to try very hard.  Though after our first experience here my wife and I thought that we would become regulars, we now have vowed to never return.", "author": "David W."}

They were delicious, piping hot and freshly fried, with a perfect blend of truffle oil, dried herbs and grated cheese. My friend had never had truffle before and was devouring the fries by the end.

It was delicious! \n\nService was excellent. Our waiter was one of those witty, wry, older British gentleman-types and at one point, when we were seemingly being attacked by this one persistent fly, he helped us swat it off my friend and offered to stand next to her to attract the fly away from us.

As to be expected for a restaurant of its class, prices are quite high for all dishes.  Portions tend toward a smaller, more appropriate size compared to the absolutely fattening portions dumped on patrons by the more affordable, \"day-to-day\" restaurants.  Nothing stands out as particularly fantastic, though the fare is quite above average; this is arguably adequate given the high cost per item.  The ambiance of the restaurant feels cold and sterile, like a museum (though not a mausoleum, so that's a good thing).  Personally, I think it would be a waste of time to dine here at night, since the view would be rendered ineffective even with a full moon.  Without the view, this restaurant is heavily overpriced for what it offers.  However, during the day (and even moreso on a bright, sunny day), Sutro's is a fantastic restaurant with an undeniably gorgeous view.  The view is truly what separates this restaurant from being ranked as a 3-star; I am not swayed by the taste of the food or the good service, since the price of each item is substantial enough that I feel I am paying for what I receive, and at those prices, I expect above average taste with very good service.", "author": "John S."}

My twin sister was in town visiting for a long weekend and we thought it'd be special to dine here (at the recommendation of my other sister).\n\nI was quite disappointed with the experience. For the price, the food was very blah.\n\n1) Bread was just okay. Cold, nothing special.\n2) It was dine about town week so we had all decided to go with that. I looked at the regular menu, and wasn't very impressed with the options either.\n3) For my dish, I started with the squash soup while others at the table ordered the Caesar salad or duck meatballs. Caesar salad was not your typical Caesar salad -- it was one long piece of lettuce with a few garnishes. My soup was okay, and duck meatballs were just okay in my opinion.\n4) For entrees, I opted for the meat dish (I believe it was duck on the regular menu --duck breast with pring onion soubise, baby turnips, duck confit, cherry jus\n -- I remember it being just okay). I had a few bites of the fish dish (also just okay).\n5) Dessert was a choice between cookies with a root beer float (mini) or a bread pudding -- bread pudding was actually pretty good.\n\nI must say, my sister has raved about this place, but I was disappointed, and probably would never come back. There are far better places to dine in SF. If you want these views, it's best to drive/bike up and around the area and take them in (no need to be in a chair in the dining room of Sutro's).", "author": "Siv L."}

To start off they were nice enough to let me wait for a better view even though I had reservation and didn't say take or else type situation. I'm not a local so it was great they let me wait for an amazing view. Bread was so warm and crisp along with the butter sprinkled with salt. I had the salmon which was well done the way I like it with bacon on top and was so hot!! I hate cold food so was pleased to have hot food which sounds obvious but we've all had that situation where food is warm or 50/50 hot and cold. The mashed served with it was very creamy and the greens not overcooked and the apple added a nice touch but the mustard sauce was bit to much and strong. My dad had the soup and was fond of how well it was made. As for my lady....she did like her meal but would've wanted it much hotter temperature wise and her creme brulle was fine but not a wow factor to say.\nI got the sorbet which was raspberries, blood orange and mango. Mango wasn't that flavorful. Best was raspberries more so than the blood orange. The candied orange on top was much to bitter and not like candy at all.

Living up to it's name, this restaurant is seated on the side of a cliff with a beautiful view overlooking the bay. We went for an early dinner and caught a glimpse of a stunning sunset. During our meal though, they decided to roll down the blinds (to block the glare from the sun?), but that also meant the view was also blocked... the main reason we came in the first place. Oh well, on to the food...\n\nMy favorite dish, hands down, was the Ahi Tuna Tartare! This appetizer officially sets the standard for other tuna tartares to beat! It is served with the tuna in the center and pine nuts, asian pears, mint, and habanero infused sesame oil quail egg on the side.

It's a pity the original Cliff House burned down in 1907. I would pay $60 for a crab sandwich to check that place out, including the bath houses, which are now sadly reduced to (bad) graffiti rubble.

The food is supposed to be higher quality (think seafood rather than burgers).  I would be willing to duck into the Bistro if I were in the area.  The website made it seem like there was no way in hell I was getting in without making a reservation of only which Sutro's took but the Bistro was not at all full.  Whatever.  We made a reservation for an early dinner at Sutro's and were seated right against the glass to watch the surf and stare at the rocks.  Only problem is that when having an early dinner, not only is the sun so intense that we couldn't see without squinting for 45 minutes but the heat was so intense that we were ecstatic to get out of there by the end of dinner.  The wind felt so nice!  If we end up returning, we'll definitely get a time closer to sunset so that we can enjoy the moment a bit more.  It took a bit to get greeted but once we were, we were off.  We started with dungeness crab cakes that were awesome!  I loved them!  They sat atop a tiny mound of frisse and had two sauces that were incredible.  The crab cake was all meat and perfectly fried crispy on the outside and warm, dense, creamy crab on the inside.  Yum!  For my entree, I got the seared scallops of which I got three giant scallops that were perfectly seared on the outside and translucent on the inside making them practically melt in my mouth.  They sat atop risotto that was made with fresh vegetables and a pepper foam that I lapped up with the incredible chunk of bread they gave me at the start of dinner.  My partner got the salmon that sat on wilted greens and mashed potatoes.  It was a tasty dish as well.  We were each quite content with our choices.  We couldn't agree on dessert so I got the passion fruit creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and she got the chocolate lava cake.  Again, we each dove into and enjoyed our choices but by that point, we were as roasted as the tomatoes in our dishes and too full to be hot.  Even the really good blackberry tea couldn't cool us so we made a break for the exit (after paying of course).  One pet peeve was that the bread server and one of the waiters both acted as if they'd rather be doing their taxes than to be at work lazily scuffing their feet as they drug their bodies back and forth to the kitchen.  Pick up yo damn feet and act as if you're working in a high class restaurant.  For the price we paid to dine there, I expected more.  I guess when the place isn't as busy, the staff hang out and shoot the shit in the bar and mope around as if the few of us that are there don't really matter.  Disappointing.  The surrounding walk-ways erased any ill feelings and we enjoyed the rest of our evening outside.\n\nThere is also valet parking which makes it pretty nice to pull up and head in.", "author": "Michelle S."}

He would have drank the whole bowl of broth if he weren't filled up by his pint of Anchor Steam beer.  I had the Pressed pork sandwich which reminded me of a Wendy's burger.  There is just something about square meat that is not right.  The pork was flavorful but a little dry & the apple mint jam didn't provide the extra moisture.  I wish the spicy, tangy slaw that was served on the side was on the sandwich instead because that was so refreshing and good.

My friends from out of town (I live local in SF) wanted to go to The Cliff House this past Sunday evening, November 3rd. There were 5 of us and we were told it would be about a hour wait, which is fine - we expected it. So, we go and sit down in the bar area, and this is where it all went downhill. \n\nNot one server came up to us after sitting at a table in the bar area for roughly 20 minutes. We eventually decided to go up to the bar and order from the bar tender, who took good care of us. Meanwhile, the server whose section was the bar area went around to all of the other tables before us (they sat down after we did) and did not even stop by our table to say, \"Hello\" or \"Sorry, you have been waiting for a while.\" So, we get out appetizers and drinks delivered to us by the bar tender who helped us. Still, the sever did not stop by once to ask how everything was or anything!! Horrible service and horrible attentiveness. \n\nI go to complain to the hostess about the service we are experiencing who does absolutely nothing about the situation. Anyway, we get our table after about a hour, order our food and drinks. The food and drinks were amazing! Yet again though, the service at our table was horrible. Our server never checked up on us once to see how everything was. Maybe she thought once our food and drinks were delivered, her job was done? I about had it at this point. I work in the customer service industry in a luxury hotel and I know what good customer service entails, and this for sure was not it. \n\nSo, I go and complain to the hostess yet again and ask for the manager to come over to our table. He comes over after about 15 minutes and I tell him about the experience we are having and not once does he apologize, but just keeps saying \"I appreciate your feedback.\" He does absolutely nothing to amend the situation. I was shocked! \n\nWhen we were leaving, I went up to him along with my other friend who also works in the customer service industry and who was equally dissatisfied with the service, to say it was one of the worst experiences I have ever had dining in a restaurant. He then proceeds to say, \"Well, I have to listen to both sides of the story.\" I was shocked yet again by this man's lack of customer service skills!! You never ever tell a customer that, the customer is always right and even if they aren't you don't tell them that. He never once apologized nor did anything did amend the situation. It was as if he didn't care about us and all he wanted was our money.  \n\nI gave this place two stars simply for the food and for the lovely African American lady at the bar who helped us in the very beginning of this horrible experience.", "author": "Chad W."}

My wife ordered her first ever martini and I ordered a Lagunitas.  The bartender was female and her name started with an M (she knows who she is but her name is withheld to protect her, lol).  She was great!  Excellent personality and large assets (yeah, I went there).  The lady knows her martinis.  No complaints at all with the bar.\n\nWe continued on to Sutro's and our 1:30 reservation.\n\nWe scanned the menu and she ordered shrimp tempura and I ordered swordfish steak sandwich.  We also ordered dungeness crab cakes for an appetizer.  \n\nThe good:  Our bartender.\n\nThe bad:  Crab cakes were tiny and topped with orange marmalade.  What the hell?  $18 for two tiny crab cakes.   Mostly breading and not a whole lot of crab.  I make much better crab cakes at home for waaay cheaper.  Plus orange marmalade and crab cakes do NOT go well together.\n\nShe gets her shrimp tempura and the batter was heavy.  Too heavy to be considered tempura.  Note to \"chef\":  Go to a good Japanese restaurant and order shrimp tempura.  This is how you should, but didn't, do it.  Try again.\n\nThe ugly:  My swordfish comes to the table.  It is a swordfish steak on toast.  The swordfish is burnt.  So is the toast.  Badly burnt.  I tried it anyway because we were there and I wanted to go with the flow.  The swordfish was inedible.  Burnt and oily.  (They later changed the menu to \"Blackened swordfish sandwich\".  It was NOT listed as blacked or I would NEVER have ordered this dish.)\n\nWhat bothers me is this:  The manager either does not know the quality of the food coming out of his kitchen or DOES know and lets it come out anyway.  The chef cooks it this way and the waiters bring it out.  Huge breakdown in giving a sh*t.  Would any of YOU eat what you brought me?  I doubt it.\n\nFinal word:  This place is iconic.  What a view.

I was expecting much more out of Sutro's as it is one of my Aunt's favorite restaurants. There's really nothing spectacular about the flavors found in the food, and my cut of meat was cut the wrong way and super dry. I feel as if they just put some lemon zest or some other zest on top of a lot of their food items to make it seem fancy.\n\nOther than the food, the ambiance, service, and view is worth giving it a second try.", "author": "Jessica L."}

We were waiting for our fifth and final member of our party before we saw a table open up. This table that got up would seat us perfectly so I kindly asked, \"do you think we can sit at that table while we wait for our last group member?\" I was addressed in an unprofessional manner explaining that \"we don't sit incomplete parties\" when there was no one else waiting for a table.....even if our last person was just looking or parking. Simply put, we walked out because of the lack of customer service and immense amount of disrespect. I don't go out of my way to write reviews often, but I don't appreciate a poopy excuse of a host. Anyway, I will never eat there. Safe to say. Embarrassing that any host would treat a guest in a negative way. She wasn't busy or anything, mainly preoccupied with talking with a coworker. And this happened about an hour ago. We went to the cliff house and had great service. Go to Louis' and just keep walkin down the street to cliff house.", "author": "Najelah N."}

Brought the fam bam here a couple times as well to celebrate a birthday.  Wouldn't say it's ideal for a huge birthday celebration, but nice for an intimate group.\n\nFirst off the location is awesome!  Love the setting!  Building is literally hanging off the cliff!  Parking can be a bit challenging, but not bad with a nice scenic walk. There is always valet if you are up for it.  I would suggest making resies on the weekends, as this usually tends to be a popular date night spot.  If you get there at the right time, there is always a beautiful sunset to watch, and you can hike down to the ruins of the original pool house building.  The history of the location is quite interesting.\n\nI always like to start fine dining with a dirty martini.  Can't really go sideways when if comes to whipping one of these bad boys up.  They usually nail it well, but there was just one time not enough vermouth was added and made it a bit too sharp.  No biggie, they gladly remade it.  Wine selection is decent as well, enough to satisfy the average patron.  I never had a chance to talk to their sommelier (if they have one?) but the waiters seemed to know their wine basics. \n\nUsually start off with a half dozen oysters to kick start our appetites.  They were very fresh and crisp.  Nice wine vinaigrette to add a kick to it.  Their burrata dish is awesome.  I have always loved burrata cheese, which is basically an upscale mozarella if I am not mistaken.  Nice soft outside texture, with a nice fluffy yet almost on the verge of liquid custard center.  Very light and easy to eat.  Definitely should try it, as it tends to be one of the harder cheeses to find.\n\nWhen it comes to the main dish, I have tried their lamb, steak, and halibut.  All done to perfection.  I love my meats rare, and they nail it head on.  Nice crisp seared outter layer with a chilled soft red core.  Mmmm just drooling thinking about it.  Halibut was done great as well.  Usually many places over cook it, but Sutro's got it right.  Nice moist core and it was layered on top of a bed risotto with a mushroom reduction.  Very tasty.\n\nEnded the dinner a couple times with their seasonal sorbet and/ or their chocolate cake.  They had a unique selection of flavors for the sorbet, but in all honesty I forgot what I had at that time.  Their chocolate cake was nice and fluffy, and not overbearing in richness.  Very good balance.  Coupled nicely with a port.\n\nOverall, great setting, awesome view, nice staff, and most importantly great food!  5/5 stars in my book.  Will definitely be coming back!", "author": "Peter C."}

We got a window seat which I was very happy to get. It was raining earlier that morning and with the sun finally coming out from hiding, a rainbow actually formed near the window we were sitting next to! During our entire dining experience, we saw a total of 2 rainbows form. It was a very lovely dining experience. Besides the rainbows though, the view of the ocean waves hitting against the rocks and the seagulls hanging out at the Sutro's baths was also nice to look at.\n\nIf you want a window seat, I suggest coming a little before the lunch hour and dinner hour crowd hits. I notice the workers would seat everyone at the window seats until it's all taken, and anyone who comes after gets stuck sitting at the tables next to the window seat tables.\n\nThe food was average. We ordered off from their Dine About Town lunch menu. We were pretty satisfied with their 2 first course dishes which were Caesar Salad and Roasted Butternut Squash Soup. I really enjoyed the salad because the lettuce was crunchy and fresh. For the main course, we ordered the Pan roasted Corvina and the Braised Beef Brisket. The Corvina (fish) was okay, but it could have been more flavorful. The beef brisket was decent, but I had better. I'm also not a big fan of horseradish, which is something they had in the beef brisket dish.\n\nThe service was also average. Not bad, not exceptional. I felt the waiter would speak directly to my boyfriend (maybe because my boyfriend would be the one who tips at the end) and ignore me. However, it's not really something that bothers me because I saw the same waiter treat the other tables very respectfully. So I'm sure he's a nice guy.\n\nI would recommend giving this place a try if you're interested because of the nice view!", "author": "Jenny T."}

Texture, flavor, color, and presentation (plain but fitting) made those little darlings go down with delight.\n\nThe desert too, was a another delicious part of the meal.  Fresh tiny blueberry creme thing that was shared between three people.   Unfortunately one person was on a diet and has to stick more with the fruit.  Ah to be young and able to ignore the cholesterol creme demons   I promise I never saw a bit you took!  \n\nHowever my problem came with the Steak Frites. (Steak Frites - skirt steak | truffled fries | bordelaise | red wine onion compote)     The steak just did not taste quit what I was expecting.

We had told them ahead of time that it was our wedding lunch (in the hopes of getting an extra nice seating location), and we were not disappointed.  Although it was foggy, we still had a spectacular view of the ocean through the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the water. \n\nI had an artichoke ravioli, served with a bechamel sauce and roasted vegetables (including celery -- I had never thought to roast celery before, but it was amazing!), and our server helped me select an appropriate wine.  (Although my wine was delicious, it paled in comparison to the spicy red that my mom got to pair with her steak...drool.)  Everyone seemed to really enjoy their meals -- and I must say, the truffle fries served with the steak were excellent.  The fresh sourdough and butter were a nice touch.\n\nThe service was excellent -- our server was friendly, attentive, and very nicely brought us a butterscotch pot de creme to share with the table (and two half glasses of champagne for Adam and I).

We called ahead of time for a reservation and they said they were booked solid for a 5pm on a Tuesday evening which we found hard to believe. We decided that we would take our chances and go right at 5 to see if they had a table available. We got there at 4:30 and had a drink at the bar. I would recommend the famous Ramos Fiz and the Pisco Sour. Both are unbelievable drinks!\n\nSure enough, we talked to the host and were seated at 5pm at one of the best tables in the house! In fact, throughout the meal there were only maybe 5 tables taken so I am not sure why they said they were booked solid! If they tell you the same when you call- I would come in anyways and take your chance!\n\nWe started with the oysters like we always do and ordered a bottle of wine for the table. Its actually half-off bottle of wine on Tuesdays so we purchased a bottle of wine for what we could buy it at the vineyard which was awesome!\n\nWe also ordered a wedge salad which was tasty, but nothing unbelievable and I ordered a fish special for the entree. It was sole and it was very tasty, but it was presented with the skin and bones which was a pain to get rid of.

From the DAT menu, we had the Caesar salad, the butternut squash soup, the braised pork shoulder and the poached flounder. The two appetizers were not so exciting. They were well made but simple. I would have liked more acidity with the soup and the salad came with 3 little croutons on some uncut hearts of romaine lettuce. \n\nFor the mains, the pork shoulder was hearty with potatoes and dark greens. The dish was flavorful and overall was a well put together plate. The surprise of the night was the flounder which ended up being our favorite. The dish itself isn't the prettiest, the first bite even made us cock our heads, but I think the great thing was the uniqueness of the flavor profile and how well it all went together- a fun foodie find. The flavors on the flounder dish were quite subtle - not too salty, sweet, spicy, or strong in any way - but it kept getting better and better as we ate it. The cooked and raw daikon that was paired with it were quite complimentary and overall we were happy with the surprising flavor profile of a light, perhaps Asian-inspired, fish dish.\n\nWe also had a pot de creme and the gingerbread (with poppyseed ice cream) for dessert. The pot de creme tasted like a good creme brulee custard without the sugar crust. The gingerbread was dry, not so interesting.\n\nFinally, for the drinks: the sangria and cocktail were just average. The DAT wine pairing was great though. For $16, you get 3 generous wine pours. The 1st course chardonnay really brought out subtle lemon flavors in the caesar salad. The sauv blanc we had for course 2 was smooth and the dessert moscato was fine as well.\n\nOverall, we found the mains to be fantastic and everything else to be just okay. Not too bad as a dine about town experience but we probably would have much less happy to pay full price for the meal. For the interesting mains we would have gave a 4 but everything else brought it back down to a 3 star rating. Note: we consider 2 stars to be \"average\" so overall we were still happy with this experience.", "author": "Amy D."}

Sure it's great for the environment and I get a little bit of change, but it's also completely disgusting and wreaks havoc on my car interior even if I put down a trash bag. When I'm done, I just never feel like I've gotten all the gunk and germs off my hands. Anyway, every year, we take the proceedings and pick a restaurant to go to since we usually have about $90 to spend.\n\nMy wife likes the Cliff House for one reason: pop-overs. If they didn't have those, there would be no reason to go. We got there a little after it opened to have some breakfast and a nice view. Oh yeah, did I mention the view? It's right next to the ruins of the Sutro Baths and looks south over the Golden Gate windmills and the great highway. It's beautiful! OK, back to the food experience...\n\nI got the eggs Benedict which were mediocre at best. One egg was warm and the other one was cold which leads me to believe that the food is not cooked to order. There were three or four potatoes and some fruit on the side. I thought the pop-overs were good, not great, but they keep bringing them out for as long as you want them, so that's good. \n\nFor me, my wife, and my mother-in-law, the total for three average breakfasts came to $70 (including $8 tip). That's super expensive for such mediocre food, but I guess you're paying for the view and the history. The place is definitely nice and clean and stylish and the wait staff are all really nice and attentive. SO, two stars for the food and 1 extra star for the ambiance.", "author": "Jason W."}

The Butternut Squash Soup [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uwYO55f9vlLdGXDIDNfhpA?select=lCHcypSjcRYE926reCCYkg] was definitely delicious. While it was not too thick, the flavor was spot on. The Pasta [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uwYO55f9vlLdGXDIDNfhpA?select=B8dVgAk3njp-7Tm6tLUvZA] smelled like Lemon Shortbread according to Mona, but it was good none the less. My crab cakes [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uwYO55f9vlLdGXDIDNfhpA?select=IKJ8mCo1VSg_5KdJDGJ6Bw] were really good as well. Though on the smaller size, it was filled with plenty of crab yet it was a little too crispy on the shell for my taste. It came with a nice little side salad which was light and refreshing.  \n\nFor my entree, the Steamed Mussels [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uwYO55f9vlLdGXDIDNfhpA?select=K31QX6Qg3uSlUNFe5qk4Fg], it was really good as well. The bread was a little too hard even when I soaked it up in the broth but the mussels......oh man they were delicious! This was definitely one of the juicier and meatier mussels that I have ever had. If you think that this won't get you full, think again! The bowl of mussels was humongous and the portions are generous!\n\nOn the side note, the restaurant is really spacious and the seating are far enough apart where you can have a nice conversation without other people eavesdropping. The restaurant is definitely on the dark [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uwYO55f9vlLdGXDIDNfhpA?select=nUSzkKbWgQeiUfkCfjlIzA] side as in there isn't much lighting and I will never understand this concept. It always makes me sleepy and I don't think that's a good combination along with food coma haha. \n\nAll in all it was a great experience for you and your loved one. I think we will definitely visit Sutra in the future for a different occasion.\n\nPARKING: Parking shouldn't be a problem.

It is a bit of a drive from the more touristy areas in SF, but that is what made it so cool. You have a big, bustling city on one side and a classy restaurant nestled against the Pacific ocean on the other. The restaurant has an open feel with huge windows all around that give the most spectacular views of the water.\n\nWe had reservations for lunch on a weekday, and did not necessarily need them, since they were not too busy at that time. The lunch crowd was mostly 40 and up, seemingly with money, but not stuffy. I am sure many kids dine here, but it is not a place that I would bring little ones. \n\nThey bring you bread with rock salted butter, and are very good about coming around to give you more if you want. My lunch partner and I don't drink, so we stuck to water. We both ordered the Steak Frites (skirt steak with bordelaise and a red wine onion compote). The steak was very well flavored and perfectly portioned. It came with truffled fries which I am a huge fan of, and Sutro's made them perfectly. That dish came to $25 pp. I had wanted to go to Ghiradelli's for chocolate after, but was so stuffed, that I had no desire to look at dessert. In fact, I appreciate that about this restaurant.

One was more nostalgic with a 1880s-early in 1900s theme (upstairs) while the other (Sutros at the Cliff house) was a bit more casual romantic brunch (up and downstairs). \n\nI had the steak frites while he had the chicken. My steak came with steak meat covered with caramelized sweet onions with a side of truffle fries. His was a moist baked chicken smothered in various herbs with a bed of salad and a crab cake. Mmmmm, Mmmmm. I can sure go for that steak right about now. I couldn't imagine a more perfect day with the greatest person I know. \n\nI'd say the bad part was the wait for the restroom. There were two unisex single room restrooms for public use. For some reason when I lined up to go the was no one else behind me, but when I inched toward the front there were five people behind me!

We dined here on our second night of our 4 day trip. \nI originally made our reservation for earlier in the evening, but then changed it to later when I checked what time the sunset for the day was. I made our reservation for 20 minutes before sunset. \n\nWe were greeted by the valet. It was $10 up front.  The valet guys were nice. The one taking our car asked if we had anything valuable in the car because they said break-ins were bad lately.  We did not have anything in our car since it was a rental. It did put a little worry in our minds, but not enough to take away from our experience. \n\nWe were promptly seated at a booth. We did not get window seats, but with the floor to ceiling windows any table is a great table. As a former Las Vegas concierge of over 7 years, I understand that most restaurants' view tables are first come, first serve unless you grease the hostess or maitre d and even then they may not be able to do anything for you. \n\nWe had a friendly server. She came to our table after we were seated and took our drink order.  \n\nMy hubby and I shared the Caesar salad which they put on a plate for each of us. It was not overly drenched in Caesar dressing. \nFor our main course, hubs had the bacon crusted salmon and I had the maple leaf duck breast. The salmon was perfectly cooked and my duck was as well. \n\nFor dessert, my hubby had the chocolate lava cake which he demolished.  He said it was really good. I had the butterscotch pot de creme.

This guy clearly doesn't know anything about high end dining or progression of wine through dinner.  Nobody drinks champagne at the end of their meal and I know the reason why they offered the champagne because it was the cheapest drink on the menu outside of beer.\n\n As a side note the offer of champagne by the manager actually back fired as it allowed me to think over tipping with more time and actually caused me to tip less than I actually had planned on by 2% less.

We tried:\n\n- Carrot Ginger Soup: this was the only dish we didn't care for, too much ginger, it was all we could taste \n- Little Gems Caesar Salad: fresh greens, tasty dressing, and crunchy croutons, nice and simple way to kick off the meal \n- Bacon Crusted Salmon: fish was perfectly cooked and the mustard sauce perfectly complimented the fish\n- Grilled Skirt Steak: my husband enjoyed this dish, the steak was nicely cooked, and the potatoes and mushrooms we're nice accompaniments \nTres Leches Brioche Bread Pudding - nice flavors and textures, but couldn't taste the tres leches much\nButterscotch Pots de Cr\u00e8me - creamy and delicious, perfect way to end the meal \n\nLive music started as we were finishing up our meal so we went upstairs for an after dinner drink to enjoy the tunes, all in all, a good evening!", "author": "Naomi A."}

I almost forgot we didn't order yet a couple times since it seemed like the food must've been in process.  Not sure how you get the popovers, but we didn't get any and I didn't see them on the menu.  I forgot about them until days latter when I remember that they are supposed to be the best out.\n\nWe had a wedding party and the 50% off wine Tuesdays helped a bit with our Champagne bill.  The food was quite good.  The appetizers were tasty and unique.  Some items seemed to be Chinese cuisine influenced (a plus).  The bouillabaisse that I got was delightful, although the yellow sauce on the bread was tasteless and reminded me of a substance found in an auto body repair shop.\n\nAll in all a wonderful experience and a memory that I'll always enjoy thanks to the good food, pleasant service, insanely awesome location, and wonderful wedding day.", "author": "Brian L."}

We decided to get here a bit earlier than our reservations hoping that we could get a window seat. They only seat you by the window on a first come first serve basis. So even if you made reservations, you cant request for a window seat.\n\nWe get to the restaurant around 600pm, all the window seats were already taken so we got seated at a table which is next to a table that is near the windows. Honestly, you cant even see a single thing out there because it is PITCH black. So it didnt even matter if you get a window seat or not. If youre coming here for a date, I suggest a booth seat instead. Unless youre going to come here before the sunset which is unlikely because the sun sets before the restaurant even opens(530pm) there's no point sitting by the window. \n\nIt took our waiter fifteen mins to even greet us and bring us our water. Took our drink orders, than waited another 20mins for it. Then took our food orders and waited another 15mins for our appetizers to arrive. Then took another 15mins for our food. The restaurant wasnt even all that busy, but yet I noticed that our waiter barely ever came to our table to check on us. He would check on every table around us consistently but never us. The window table next to us changed out customers TWICE while the time we were there for our dinner. Not because my bf and I were taking our times eating, but because the waiter didnt make them wait as long as we did for EVERYTHING. I even overheard the customers complaining about how slow the service was, and I couldnt agree more. \n\nThis was one of the worst \"fine-dining\" experiences that Ive ever encounter. If Im going to pay a great amount of money to eat at a \"fine-dining\" restaurant than I expect BETTER service. Food was mediocre, there's other american restaurants I can go to and spend less money for better service. \n\nDefinitely not coming back or recommending this place to anyone. You can take your chances though, maybe it was just my waiter who was slow.", "author": "Bonnie S."}

However, we walked by it last year and noticed a Michelin sticker.  After doing some research and finding out they had a new chef since they went downhill, this was a target for DAT last year, which was a great lunch.\n\nThis time, however, we were treating our parents out for dinner and it was a great experience.  We managed to get last minute reservations for 5:15pm on a Friday, but coming from Walnut Creek, we hadn't passed the Caldecott tunnel yet and it was 4:45.  Luckily, we made it by 5:30pm so it was in the \"grace period\" most restaurants hold your reservation.  On top of that, we got the corner window table!  Score!\n\nLooking at our tab...what didn't we get?  I could list everything out, but everything was good.  Our favorites were the rack of lamb and the duet of beef.  If you're a meat eater, you HAVE to get one of those.  All of the appetizers we ordered for the table were also very good and the desserts...I'm not sure how we squeezed them in.\n\nOn top of that the wine selection was nice so the lady and I shared a half bottle.  Plus the service was great.  Mike was very witty and very attentive.  My tip: even if you're not keen on eating early, get there around sunset and ask for a view.

I also hold it against the owners of this restaurant. It is an absolute shame this restaurant has only 3.5 stars rating on yelp. This place should absolutely wow enough people to land a solid 4 or 4.5. There's always enough people that want to hate places to drag someone down from 5 stars, so it would be understandable.\n\nThis place is squandering the amazing view and history by not having an amazing restaurant in tow. Maybe it used to, but it doesn't now. Here is what's missing. A friendly service staff. They weren't rude at all and said all the right things, but I would not call them friendly. In fact I had friendlier service at both a Carl's Jr and a Cheesesteak Shop this same week. I'm sure those folks weren't for some reason happier to see customers any more than Cliff House's service staff, but they sure were friendly. Why? Probably just friendly people I guess. The hostess was one of these people. She was incredibly friendly and did a great job.\n\nThrow in some contemporary, or maybe just newer dinnerware.

My parents were in from Ohio and really wanted to go, as we'd had a great experience there about 10yrs ago. Luckily our reservation fell on a fogless evening so the setting was spectacular.  If it's cloudy, I'd have to say that you should pass, because the food is definitely not worth the trip. Some items were tasty, others were not.  The salads were all good, but the mains were very disappointing, especially the $44 NYStrip which was downright awful - tough and flavorless with tons of gristle.  Yuck  \nThe service was ok. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable though harried - spread too thinly. The bus people need improvement. My chair was rammed multiple times by them, water was spilled on our table and plates were removed mid-bite while others were still eating. When one took the largely uneaten steak and we mentioned how bad it was he shrugged. It felt like amateur hour - not at all in line with the high-end atmosphere and prices.  \nAnd I guess that basically sums up the whole experience, outside the stunning views - not in line with expectations or prices. The place was packed, largely with tourists, so perhaps management realized that there's no need to try very hard.  It was far below our experience there from a decade ago, and we will definitely not be back.\nIf you're looking for ocean views, and it's a sunny day and you have plenty of time (at least 30mins each way from downtown) and money to spare, I guess it might make sense to go.

I love the idea of the restaurant having so much history and formerly being this huge bath house. \n\nIts on Ocean Beach right on the water, up on the hills so you do get a cool view BUT we went for dinner on a Thursday night so the fog was SO heavy in SF that we couldn't see ANYTHING.  We were hoping to see the sunset and get some type of view but no luck.  This place is most likely better suited during brunch. \n\nLuckily the parking was easy and available on the street.  There is valet too. \n\nBut only in SF do you find dreadfully cold weather in late August.  We ran to our cars after dinner. \n\nSo anyways on to the food.. \n\nSutro's is the fancier restaurant at Cliffhouse versus Bistro is the more casual with TV screens to watch the Giants play or whatever. \n\nSo we ordered the following: \n- Crab cakes- 2 pieces.  Pretty good\n- Bacon Crusted Loch Duart Salmon (really good) \n-  Maple Leaf Duck Breast (pretty good) \n\nThe food and service were good but disappointed in the views.

I made reservations through OpenTable for 12:30 and right around the same time. If you have reservations, you should just head on downstairs and a hostess will seat you. Here are my overall thoughts:\n\n1.) Service is a bit inconsistent and a bit slow. Our waiter was nice, but the women who gave us bread and took our plates away seemed a bit grumpy and upset.\n2.) The view is spectacular. Sadly, all the window seats were filled.\n3.) I got an email later from OpenTable saying that they had marked me as a no show. Kinda annoyed simply because 4 no-shows means your account is deactivated on OpenTable.\n4.) Food was alright. It was simple and good, but wasn't blow away by it.\n\nOverall somewhere between a 3 and a 4.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-01-21", "description": "My quick one liner: For the prices of this place, the food here just did not deliver.\n\nWhat a gorgeous restaurant! Breathtaking view of the ocean, romantic decor, and the menu sounded absolutely delightful! \n\nWhat bothered me though, was that the tables were oddly placed. I feel like they can line them asymmetrically (...somehow. Hey, I'm no interior designer) because the tables for 2 that were right next to each other were literally, RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. There was no privacy for a place that seems to be a setting for an intimate date. The couple sitting next to us had a hard time conversing when we were conversing and vice versa. It was just awkward.\n\nOur waiter reminded me of a old-timey train conductor: enthusiastic, endearing, and super charming; I loved him quite literally, and wished for him to be my grandfather. He even showed us a cute magic trick at the end :]\n\nLooking through the menu, EVERYTHING on the list was making my mouth water. Ended up ordering:\n\nBottle of Red/White Wine (~50)\n     Recommended per waiter. Dinner date said he likes red and I liked whites, so the waiter offered us a bottle of a mix (not sure what it's called sorry). The ideal of a wine BLEND did not sound amazing to me, and it was subpar. I'd rather drink a straight red than a blend. Boo to the recommendation. He was also really pushing that same wine onto other tables because the table next to ours were drinking the same one.\n\nAhi Tuna Tartare (18) \n     Raw tuna served with pine nuts, red peppers, chives, (some 4th thing), and a quail egg on top, drizzled with sesame oil. The server mixed it at the table, but before I can tell him that I absolutely despise red bell peppers, he mixed it in without getting my ok. So I thought to myself, if the chef made it to be eaten this way, is shall be eaten this way. NOPE, red bell peppers are disgusting. Give me green or yellow, I can eat that in any way. Red though, just... no. The plate also came with pita-like chips that go with it. It was a bad mix. The flavor of the pita chips were too strong, floury, and was too heavy on texture. It completely hid ALL the flavors and smooth texture of the tartare. I ended up forking all the tartare (picking out the bell peppers if I can) and it was SO MUCH MORE DELICIOUS. My dinner partner did not enjoy the dish until after I recommended that he eat it without the chips.\n\nColorado Lamb Rack (44)\n     My main course. 2 fist-sized lambs with a rectangle of au gratin and side of veggies. I was extremely excited to cut into the melt-in-your-mouth lamb and take my first bite. At first glace, it was apparent that the lamb I asked to be cooked medium-rare (I emphasized the rare part), was a full blown medium. There were no questions. I cut into it anyway to see if MAYBE the inside was a little less overcooked. I was disappointed. Then I thought maybe it'll be so good, I won't have to send it back! Nope. It was way too dry. and the meat was not glistening with juices. This is MY FIRST TIME asking the waiter to take my food back, saying that it was way too overcooked. He took the lamb back without apologies. 15 minutes later, and after my dinner date have slowly eaten half his food (sharing with me), my lamb came. COMPLETE 180! Still a little overcooked but pink enough. Glistening, juicy, and looked so ALIVE compared to the dried out lamb I had before. No complaints afterwards. Au gratin was meh. It was hard and a little undercooked.\n\nRoasted New York Strip Loin & Bone Marrow (42)\n     My dinner date's main course. I got the chance to have a taste of it because my date cutely fed me while my lamb was sent back for a refire. The steak was a little tough for me. The sauce that it came with though was divine. The steak almost needed the sauce for it to be edible. The bone marrow was served on the side with seasoning and breadcrumbs over it. It was a completely overkill in seasoning. The creamy, fatty texture of the bone marrow got lost in the bread crumbs. Do chefs understand that bone marrows, gizzards, hearts, tongues all have such DELICATE FLAVORS that masking it like this is completely pointless? It was quite maddening, really. \n\nChocolate Lava Cake (~10-12)\n     It was not a great lava cake. The molten chocolate in the center tasted more like  raw batter. It was grainy and heavy. We shared the dessert and didn't finish most of it.", "author": "Azn B."}

Their irish coffees, which I think are the cheapest cocktail, are absolutely delicious, and very strong. Service is friendly and not pretentious, even though this is definitely a fancy place. Our server made seemingly genuine conversation with us. The cocktail menu is hella broad, including hard to find options like Dark and Stormys. They know how to mix them too, for sure.

The bread/butter was good (nice that it was served warm).\n\nThe biggest disappointments were that despite making the reservation a couple of days in advance (a necessity, as there appeared to be a 2 hour wait for walk-ins), we couldn't reserve a window table (which is pretty important if you want to really enjoy the great views and location that the restaurant has to offer). The biggest disappointment, however, was that, despite notifying the restaurant when making my booking, that it was my wife's birthday, the only recognition that my wife got about her birthday was when the guy who walked us to our table wished my wife a happy birthday. Nearly every other restaurant that I've been to at least puts a candle on a desert or gives a free desert for birthdays or something else to make it special. So overall, it was a pretty good (if somewhat expensive) birthday lunch but I'd hoped that the restaurant would have made it more special by offering the ability to reserve a nice window table and some better recognition for my wife's birthday.\n\nP.S. I'm not sure if we were just lucky with our service flow but the people on one table next to us were complaining that they'd been waiting over 30 mins for their food and another couple was offered desert by their waiter before their entrees had even arrived.", "author": "Jon Y."}

It wasn't crowded which was nice so I can hear the table conversation.  The food was great.  The waiter had the smarts to start on the kids dishes first so they don't have to wait while we got our appetizers.  I can't say the same for Chouchou.  This place is reasonable too.  Their price fix is the best 39 for soup, duck which was done way better than Chouchou - moist and unique, full of flavor, and the dessert too.  The presentation of food is like what you see on food network's iron chef.  High quality food, presentation, taste, and food art.\n\nThe duck was so good.  Medium and the sauce underneath was smooth with a little spice at the end.  there was a cilantro sauce for contrast color, but the taste of that was a well balance cool to the spice with the duck.  there was a duck shred meat mixed with various beans which was a total different presentation of duck as well, not just the breast fileted out.

We had a 5:00 PM reservation but arrived early so we sat in the bar and had a glass of white wine.  At 5:00 PM, we paid our bar bill and went to see the host to be seated.  The place was empty and the host was not busy but he told us to wait.  About 5:10 we were seated.  our waitress took our order which was crab cakes as appetizer, I had artichoke ravioli and my boyfriend has scallops.  We ate our dinner and told the waitress it was my boyfriend birthday, she brought a butterscotch pudding with whipped cream, and two coffees.  We paid our bill and left. \n\n That was when the trouble started.  As we stepped out from restaurant, and  walked outside my boyfriend started to feel sick.  We stopped at the fence over looking the cliff, and my boyfriend said to me that he could not walk up the hill to the parking lot across the street.  When I took at my boyfriend he looked very sick and pale, and he told me that he felt sick and could not walk up to the hill.  I helped him back to the lobby where he sat in the entry way while I went to get the car in the parking lot.  I drove us home where my boyfriend lay down for an hour.  \n\nOn Friday, July 19th, I went to speak with the manager, Ralph Burgin, I told him what had happened to us on July 17th when we came to eat at the Cliff house restaurant.  He was not at all sympathetic with my situation.  In fact, he said that it was not his fault or the restaurant's fault that we got sick.  Mr. Burgin said, there must be something wrong with you.  He told me that he will investigate the problem and will get back to me on Tuesday at the latest but he never called me,  However, I did receive a call from Kevin Weber the cook, and he also said that it was not his fault but he would  investigate the problem.\n\nI feel that the Cliff house did not handle the problem appropriately and totally disregarded us. They don't care about their customers. I feel that the treatment I received was very disrespectful.  So, I am writing this yelp review to let other people know how disappointed we were and nothing was done to correct the problem.  An established restaurant should treat its customers better than that.", "author": "ann d."}

It was just before sunset, how could I resist?\n\nOur waiter was unusual. He was prompt and punctual but awkward and almost rude when explaining things. I assumed it was just the way he spoke so I didn't pay too much mind to it. There was a point in the evening when he came up, close enough to talk to us, but looked at our table quickly and said \"Water okay, wine okay. OKAY.\" Then he walked away! Who does that? It was just weird to me. Another thing I found strange was when we asked about a dish he said he thought it didn't look too appetizing but it tasted great. Being in the industry, I know that selling a dish is sometimes hard, but you don't need to be that honest.\n\nThe food was alright. Nothing too memorable. Some of the plating and presentation was pretty to look at, flavor was good, nothing stellar.\n\nThe desserts were HUGE! They were probably my favorite part of the meal, along with the champagne we busted open. We had a butterscotch pot de creme and a frozen lemon souffle. Both wonderful.\n\nOverall, desserts saved this place from being a 2-star review. The location is wicked, and it's especially beautiful to go on a sunny afternoon (went a second time to try lunch with a good friend). Maybe it's not all the waiters, but the waiter we got that night needs to practice reserve. The menu has potential, everything sounds amazing, but some dishes need to be worked on.

The first thing that will catch your eye is the incredible view of the Pacific Ocean surrounding the restaurant. I had arranged a few months ago to have a table with a view. It was so magnificent you could even hear the waves through the glass. Plus there are sea rocks right in front of the restaurant. Cliff House has a gorgeous interior. Its floor to ceiling panoramic windows make the restaurant a sight to remember. We ordered Thai style bouillabaisse, and the pan roasted halibut. The seafood tasted really fresh and delicious. What made it even more spectacular was seeing the Pacific Ocean from the panoramic windows and knowing that the seafood almost seemed to jump out of the sea. We highly recommend Cliff House as a must if you are visiting San Francisco and want to see the more ocean like side of the city. It is great for a special occasion because it is far away from the noisy city life and has the best view of the Pacific Ocean you will ever see in San Francisco!", "author": "Josh F."}

The soup is huge so it could be a serious part of a meal. The cesar salad was very tasty. \n\nWe had scallops and halibut as the mains. The scallops came with a nice garnish of bacon, asparagus, potatoes, ... very tasty and a well balanced dish. The halibut came with a sweet potatoes cake, which was also tasty and it balanced the fish very well. \n\nWe had coffee and strawberry almond cake for dessert. The cake is light and a great finish to an excellent meal. \n\nWe had a Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc 2008 with the meal. The wine is fruity and a great match to the two dishes. \n\nThe setting is fantastic and the food is very well composed. Our waiter was friendly and provided just the right kind of attention. \n\nOverall a great experience. \n\nAt the end we ordered a taxi and it took us 1 1/4 hour to actually get one.

I do not know why I have not been to this side of San Francisco. I had to take Great Highway to get to Cliff House from San Jose. It was a nice ride with the ocean on my left and beautiful small houses on my right. The restaurant itself has a great view at a great location with cool history of Sutro Bath. I especially like the painting of the Sutro Baths in the late 19th century at the stairs going down to Sutro's at the Clifff House. \n\nFood: The brunch menu at Sutro's is very diverse and tasty. They have chicken, crabs, fish and steak. I ordered the Pan Seared Scallops. The fresh baguette was crunchy and delicious together with the salted butter. My main entr\u00e9e   came out with 3 big piece of scallops, fregola, clams and shrimp. I have never tried fregola before. They are very good even though I am not a big fan for carb. I like how the chef sweetened up the whole dish with some super sweet small tomatoes. The scallops were perfectly cooked. Tender and chewy at the same time. I also had the chocolate molten cake for dessert. It was one of the best chocolate molten cake I've ever had. It was moist with running chocolate inside. It had a perfect sweetness. Even though I was a little sad that the cake did not come with the ice cream, it came with a piece of caramel candy. It was delicious. Overall, the food was very good and it was also presented lovely. 4/5 stars\n\nService: The host was very helpful. I booked the table at 1:15pm on Sunday. I arrived 20 minutes earlier but she was able to accommodate me right away. I appreciated that. Our waiter did an ok job but he did not go above and beyond, did not give me any special feelings. 3/5 stars \n \nAmbiance: I had brunch here on a Sunday. The whole restaurant was lit up with sunlight. That was beautiful. However, perhaps it was during the day that's why I did not feel the fanciness of the restaurant. If it was at night, with candle lights or the lighting of the restaurant, the restaurant would appear to be fancier. I like the decorations related to Sutro Baths. They have paintings and signs from old Sutro Baths. The only thing that was a little annoying me was that the restrooms were for both men and women. Not to mention that the interior of the restroom was not upscale or not suitable for the restaurant. 3.5/5 stars\n\nPrice: The price was just right for the Sunday brunch. My scallops were $30 which is pretty reasonable. The price for dinner was a little higher. 4/5\nConclusion: The Cliff House is located at an amazingly beautiful spot. It was surrounded with the ocean and the white waves. You can do the dinning and the observing the amazing nature right in front of you. It was lovely!!!! I will definitely go back to this place.", "author": "Tee V."}

As we are ready to head out we call the Cliffhouse asking for any happy hour there going on or specials, the lovely lady who is front desk or whatever host replies \" Yes we have Happy hour allday come on by, we have $5 specials going on.\" We head on over there, great view, very excited because of my lady being never been there. All of a sudden, there is no specials, no happy hour, no nada. We ask the lovely lady who answered the phone, and she replied like she didnt know about anything and tried to direct us to another place down the street. We even showed her the dialed call and confirmed if we were at the right place and all was right. As my girlfriend was asking of this the lady turned and directed the problem over to the manager....then...I heard her mumble and whisper \"Bitch\" (excuse my language) while faced the other way. I stayed professional but wanted to give her a peace of my mind but thanks for Yelp we can finally speak out. Lemme say this first, I am a server, host, bartender, and all at a respected Country Club and know about fine 5 star dining service. The manager attended to us and was very polite of the situation and tried to (take care of us) but what does that really mean? We dont know, didn't stay to find out. \n\nThis place is snobby, fulla fake ass rich people, and lost confused tourist.\nThe only worth here is the view and yeah the manager guys is ok.\nPlace is garbage to me.

The restaurant is very cute and it seems that most people are there for a special occasion. I loved the view, we had as we were dinning. The service was pretty good but it seemed a bit slow. I think that it is probably based on the fact that people want to stay and watch the sunset while they eat, I don't know if I think that is a good or bad thing. \n\nThe menu seemed somewhat limited to me since I am not a big seafood fan, I tend to eat mostly vegetarian so this was a slight problem. My boyfriend ordered the bacon crusted salmon and I had the grilled beat salad. The food was descent but not anything special.\n\nI think what really made me give Sutro's a good review was the dessert. The desserts here were phenomenal. They brought me a mini Caramel Pot de Creme because it was my birthday and my boyfriend and I also ordered the Frozen Lemon Souffle. Both of these sweets were amazing. A great way to end the night. \n\nOverall the whole dinning experience was pleasant and Sutro's is a good place to celebrate a special occasion.", "author": "Nava N."}

I liked the nautical feel, historic background of it all with pictures and artifacts from the Sutro Baths. We were seated in a room with a great view of the ocean. However, it was still sunny and the shades were down to keep glare out of the customers' eyes. But they pulled it back up once it was sunset and it was a gorgeous view.\n\nI'm not sure if it was because our server was tired from a long shift or it was super busy but there was bit of a wait time in between for our food to come in; longer than what I'm used to. Such as the bread. We ordered our food first before we got the bread. Usually I'd rather eat my bread first and then have the menu come in so I can expect how much I could eat as I have bread filling me up. And my waiter seemed a little cold and hasty when he took our order, my family would make jokes with him and pouring our water.\n\nFor starter, I ordered the crab cakes. They were tasty. A good amount of breading outside and crab inside. For my entree, I decided to stay away from the typical filet mignon or duck or lamb because I'm a meat eater. But I thought, if I'm going to eat by the sea, I'm going to order seafood. So I took a chance on the bacon seared salmon and I made the right choice. Good sized portion and no trace of that fishy smell you would usually get from salmon. I was excited for dessert though. I needed something creamy, chocolatey, and to end my dinner off well so I ordered the chocolate lava cake. And boy, I should have ordered just the ice cream. The cake was good but I need more ice cream to balance out the richness of it. My senses were getting lost in the little specs of sea salt that were hidden in the ice cream and had to spit them out. Salty doesn't go with sweet. I just wanted to enjoy a simple chocolate cake and ice cream... For once, I was not happy with dessert.\n\nI'm giving Sutro's 3 out of 5 because I wasn't too crazy over the service.", "author": "Candice L."}

IT was great! The swordfish was just perfect, and I'm pretty sure the bacon was made in Heaven (and i'm not a bacon eater). The tomatoes were three different varieties of heirlooms, and the sandwhich was topped off on one side with a chipotle-mayo sauce, and on the other side with a avocado and lemon spread. The only super sad down side was the bread really should have been grilled. Instead, I think that they really just took the bread, showed it to the grill, and then threw it on the plate. Point being, the \"sandwich\" thing didn't even last one bite. We also had the Bacon crusted Loch Duart Salmon. While delicious, the portion left a lot to be desired.\n\nBut really... it's all about the dessert! Between 4 of use we split the Triple Chocolate Mousse and the Butterscotch Pots de Creme. Both were fantastic. The mousse was three delicious layers of thick, creamy chocolate mousse (white, milk, and dark), garnished with a chocolate wafer, and a side of both amazing strawberry and blackberry sauce to bring out each chocolate flavor. The butterscotch was fantastic!! Creamy and sweet (but not overly sweet), and the tuile is made of a sweet, gingerbread-like marsala that sets it off just perfectly!\n\nI had never been to the old Cliff House, and knew only a little of the history.

The duck meatballs were cold with some weird mushy brown rice coating them, and honestly I can't even remember what else I had, except there were lots of glue-y mashed potatoes.  Wine pairing was ok, nothing special or anything you can't get in the discount aisle at Whole Foods.\n\nThe meal was over and it was time to go out for the night.  The valet told us we could get the house car to take us anywhere in San Francisco for $35.  \"Do they take credit cards?\" \"Sure do!\" \"Great, we'll do it!\"  Seemed like a good deal since cabs are hard to find that far out in the city.  We paid the deposit and waited for 15 minutes for the car to show up...or about as much time as it would have taken for a cab to be dispatched.  Whatever.  We got in the car and were going to our destination (the bowling alley by the ballpark).  Half way there the driver tells us it will be $45 since it's so far away.  \"That's not what we were told by the restaurant.\" \"Well that's what it is.\"  Going back and forth yielded nothing, and since it would be more expensive to get out where we were and get a cab, we agreed to the ransom.

Yes that's how bad my experience was, but I guess here goes. My two sisters and I arrived to the Cliff House, we get no greeting from the hostess at the front desk so we inform her that we have reservations, she then tells us to head downstairs. She never even asks us whether or not we've been there before or not, she just assumes that we know where we're going. So that's what we do, we head downstairs and think there's one more floor, so we take the elevator downstairs, but mind you we don't get stopped by the staff at the restaurant on the second floor. We then get into the elevator and head for the 3rd floor, the elevator door opens and we see a door, so we take the elevator back up to the second floor and still are not greeted by the hostess. We inform the hostess that we have reservations and she begins the process of taking us to our seats. We get seated and wait about 10-15 minutes before someone comes over and asks us what we would like to drink, we give the waiter our drink order and look at the overpriced menu again. When time comes to order we give our waiter our orders and the last thing my sister asks the waiter is if they have macaroni and cheese, he says yes, and my sister says she wants 1 order of that...well guess what, HE DOES NOT put the dish on our order. So when we get our food we ask our server if we're going to get our mac-N-cheese, and of course he checks in with the waiter who took our order and totally forgot about it. What makes this experience worst is that our waiter never comes back to check up on us because he's too busy trying to get a bigger tip from this other table, so we never get our water refilled until we ask the servers around us. Overall, the mediocre food was overpriced and not worth it, the view wasn't even that great, your basically surrounded by the ocean and three rocks with bird poo all over them. I could have eaten a burger on a bench at the beach if I wanted that view.", "author": "Susan Y."}

I realized somewhere into the meal that I was going to have to be designated babysitter for the night. One of my biggest pet peeves is taking care of drunks, but I refused to let it ruin my night.  After I talked my dinner companion into not discussing emotionally heavy bullcrap at the dinner table, I really enjoyed the dinner and desert. My cosmopolitan tasted more like a kamikaze but it didn't go to waste with the lush who was with me, of course. Luckily the true babysitting began once we were at a dive bar later and I was not subjected to embarrassment in this fine establishment. I look forward to visiting Sutro's again, minus one drunk.\n\n******\nGot to go back for a non alchy-holic dinner for Mothers Day and Sutros did not disappoint. My mom was totally diggin it, which was the best part of all. We had a great view and it was kinda cool being in a room full of so many different types of moms and families all celebrating the same thing. I had the swordfish which was great, but my moms salmon was even better. I was totally coveting other peoples plates at one point, really wishing I had ordered the scallops but making mental notes for the next visit.  We shared a lemon thing for desert which was of course really nice too. As usual, its always a pleasure to have 5 start dining while the waves are lapping underneath you and sailboats are cruising off on the horizon. It naturally makes any meal or wine tast that much better.", "author": "Lisa J."}

It happened to be our 29th anniversary which I communicated on my Open Table reservation form. We couldn't have had a better evening. They gave us a table by the window and at the end of the night, the server brought us a personalized menu scroll from Chef Seawell. A very nice touch! We found the staff professional and friendly. The decor was great and if it hadn't been 8:00 at night, the view would have been breathtaking! Our meal was great, and the price was reasonable for the entrees we chose.

The food was much better than I remembered from the last time, but the service was subpar for a fine dining excursion. First off, we had a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday. We specified that we wanted a window, and ended up having to wait nearly another hour at the bar for a window table to open up since they didn't want to give us a four-top. To the nice hostess's credit, after such a long wait at the bar she did give us a four-top rather than wait even longer for a two-top to open. \n\nWhile we were waiting, we had really yummy drinks at the bar, and the bar server was very nice. But when the table was ready, we were made to close our our tab at the bar rather than just transfer it. Also, a slightly less subtle indication that this is not the fine dining establishment that they advertise themselves to be, we carried our own drinks across the restaurant. Not too big a deal for me, just a detail that real fine dining restaurants would never allow. When we were seated, the gal actually asked us to share a menu because they had run out and would bring another when one became available. Ummm. Yeah. OK. \n\nSo, we ordered the beet salad and the crab cakes, which were very good. I usually prefer my crab cakes grilled and probably would not have ordered them had I remembered to ask, but they were very good. I then ordered the pistachio-crusted scallops with pork belly and my almost fiance ordered a steak special. Both were very good. Unfortunately, it took more than 2 hours to eat our 2 courses. It took FOREVER to get each course, then another year to have it cleared, then another few months to get the next one. We finally flagged down a bus boy to box our food and get the check. \n\nIf you don't get out to the beach very often and are looking for something with a large group to celebrate a special event during daylight hours, this is definitely a good place to do it. What you're mostly paying for here is the view, so if it's not daylight you're not going to see anything anyways, and in a large group you would expect to spend a long time over a meal. Otherwise, there are lots of great places with great food in the city that also have exceptional service.", "author": "Amy B."}

My original plan was to get brunch at the Cliff House Bistro, but I was told the wait would be a ridiculous hour & a quarter. (Clearly, on such a sunny weekend, others had also come up with the same idea...) So, as a fallback, I decided to go with the more up-market Sutro's Restaurant.\n\nThe wait was much better - about 30 minutes: clearly, the higher prices scare away the majority of the tourist crowd. We started in the upstairs bar area with some fairly excellent Bloody Marys. Great drinks, not outlandishly priced at $7.50, with stunning views out over the Pacific and along Ocean Beach. \n\nWe went downstairs to the restaurant for lunch. The place is a fairly formal dining space -- white table-cloths and uniformed wait-staff, but in a bright room with tall windows overlooking the ocean. We were given a comfortable booth and looked over the surprisingly pricey menu. Clearly, you are paying, in part, for the astonishing location of the restaurant and the slightly elitest environment. Another slight disappointment -- the Terrace Room does not share a kitchen with the adjoining Bistro restaurant, so we weren't able to order the excellent pot stickers that are on the Bistro menu.\n\nNevertheless, the food looked very good -- we could see the dishes our neighboring diners had ordered -- if a bit old-school in terms of presentation and \"sauciness\". I ordered the Steak Frites -- good, but not remarkable. Likewise, my friends ordered a Ravioli dish and good Chicken entree. Good food --and a very good place to bring my out-of-town friend -- but really, nothing exceptional, and certainly not worth the fairly inflated price. (And -- slightly annoying -- our young waiter was very smug, bordering on the arrogant. Not good, for such a low-key, refined-seeming, restaurant.)\n\nFor the future: the venue is great, the view astonishing -- but I'll stick to the more casual and fun Bistro the next time I need to entertain my tourist friends...", "author": "donal c."}

Dinner with \"his/her\" parentals/ Meeting the parentals\n3. Romantic dinner with your significant other\n4. Date (not first, maybe 3rd or 4th) with someone you are REALLY into.\n\nThe view is amazing. The food is good.  What more could you ask for?\n\nI came here for the first time last month with my Mom for her early birthday dinner.  She was really pleased with the ocean view.  It was a clear day and we caught about an hour of light and then saw the beautiful sunset.  We had a really intimate dinner and she couldn't stop commenting on how beautiful the view was.  She was a happy camper, and I was happy she was happy.\n\nRound two was last night with the boy's parents.  The dinner went really well.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food.  They also couldn't stop commenting on how beautiful the view was.  \"Great view, great food, great company\" - YES, SUCCESS!! :) \n\nAll jokes aside, the food is good.  It's not the best I've ever had.. but paired with the atmosphere and view this place provides, this place deserves 5 stars.  I can understand why some people might've given the place 3 stars based on the priciness of this place.. but I think if you are going for one of the top 4 occasions, this is a 5 star place.\n\n1. Ahi Starter - I don't usually do raw fish.  Definitely without the boy asking me to just \"take a little bite\".. but after tasting this I went back for seconds ON MY OWN! THIS SAYS A LOT.  Trust me, you gotta try this starter.\n\n2. Crab Cakes - This was good, but for $17.. I'd rather get something else or wait until the next time I go down to SD and hit up crab catcher..\n\n3. Corn Soup - I LOVE chinese corn soup (you know, with the egg, creamy corn, chicken broth, etc.)... and this is totally different. Half white and half yellow corn..thicker... but SO GOOD! I'm a huge fan.  The only thing was they put this spicy seasoning where the white and yellow soup meet..and that kept hitting my throat and making me semi choke.  THIS IS GOOD.\n\n4. Filet Mignon - PERFECTLY cooked.  I just didn't like the sauce all that much.. too peppery/spicy.\n\n5. Duck - had a nibble, cooked perfectly as well - good taste.\n\n6. Strawberry trio - milkshake was good, nothing special, the cake was moist with strawberries on top (strawberry shortcakey) .. and didnt try the sorbet\n\n7. Milk chocolate Fondue w/fresh fruit - fun + yum!\n\n8. Bear & Lion Old Vine Zin - Once again, I'm a total wine noob but I really liked this!  I was actually the first one to finish my glass of wine..the boy's dad refilled me... then i realized my face was probably lit up with asian glow so I slowed it right down.. but I liked this wine!\n\nI know I don't do a great job on reviewing the \"taste and \"flavor\" of the food.. but all I have to say is that no one is going to convince me this place ain't 5 stars if you go for one of the top 4 occasions listed above.

We seriously considered paying for a cab to get us back.\n\nI started with a mixed greens salad, while some other friends had the lobster bisque. The bread served with dinner was not the finest, but decent. My friends had some 16 year old scotch which tasted of this smokey flavor. It was good and very dry. Nevertheless I am of the mindset that drinks should not taste like wood. I might as well go to the local park and grab some tanbark and stir it into some vodka for the same effect but for half the price!\n\nFor my main course I had the seafood bouillabaisse which was delicious.

It has a great view but the view can change if the weather is bad. It is restaurant whose cuisine and service is average trying to be upscale.\n\nThe Food: \n  The food is average American style seafood. They are beautifully prepared but lack the wow factor. The oysters we had were very fresh. The ahi tuna tartare was very well balanced in flavor and texture. other dihes were just ordinary. The prices are a little higher than usual. \n\nThe Decor:\n  Since this restaurant is located by a cliff looking out to the ocean the view is great if weather permits. on the day I went it was quite cloudy so the vision was quite low. The inside decor is filled with antiques from the old Cliffhouse set in a modern decor.\n\nThe Service:\n  The service was a little lacking due to the fact that there was no dedicated server to each table. Once it got busy the servers seemed to be overwhelmed and confused. The food started to come much slower as our meal progressed. \n\nThe Summary:\n  I have mixed feelings about this restaurant in general. It is a average restaurant trying to go upscale. If not for the location this would not be a restaurant I would choose to dine at, at least not my first choice. If I was in San Francisco an feltt like seafood I this place would be my 3rd or 4th choice. On the other hand they are kid friendly though...", "author": "Stanley C."}

The kids meals were quite hearty with big baskets of tasty fries. (Hubs and I were starving, so we had to steal a few.) The bread came soon after this, and we found it hard and not incredibly tasty. \n\nThe entrees were a completely different story. My salmon was amazing, and the hubby's halibut also very good.

Limited, mostly seafood.  Menu not evidently seasonal which is a bit stale of an approach given the price point. \nFood presentation: 2 stars. In your minds eye, imagine any of the fictitious restaurants mentioned in American Psycho brought to life- very 1980s. Also lots of brown involved. \nPortions: 2.5 stars. Again, given the price... Entrees do offer a wee bit more than they visually appear, but I'd also filled up on bread.  But the appetizers- nope. Consider eating a sandwich before arriving. \nCarpet: 1 star. For the price and the location, one wishes for more than casino carpeting from an off strip Vegas casino\n\nI dined with a group of 6 for dinner, so we got a fair sampling of the small menu. Nothing arrived hot, and just teetered on pleasantly warm for maybe the first bite. Senior diners will likely appreciate the non threatening food temperature. Best thing was the salmon, but the rings of beige encircled by brown pur\u00e9e were not aesthetically appealing. It was tasty though. Paprika prawns were in an oily smoky paprika broth that almost punches you in the face with it's overpowering.... Smokiness? Would have benefited from more prawns, less oil and a whisper of light or sweet to temper the savory/salty/smoky. \nDuck-  Not too greasy, and the skin was cooked fine, but not a home run. \nBoulliabaise- pretty good. Just had a great Boulliabaise at a place in Oakland recently, so maybe had that not been so present in my memory this woulda seemed better. \nMussels- decent and the broth actually would have almost been great were it not for the overpowering alcohol (Marsala I am guessing) present in the sauce.  Dial back the booze in the sauce and it would have been better. \n\nWhat's our takeaway? \nCome here around sunset, grab a cold beer or glass of wine and maybe an appetizer at the bar and toast to the fact that you're next to the majestic Pacific Ocean in one of the best cities in the USA.", "author": "Kristen R."}

The view did not disappoint me, it was really sunny today, very sunny in fact. I got the window seat, so it was the perfect moment to have lunch at Sutro's. \n\nFrom the DAT menu, I had the soup and I'm so glad I did. The soup is tasty and has great presentation. While the salad looks blunt, and tasted usual a.k.a nothing special. Second course, my friend had the rock cod while I got the chicken breast sandwich. The food itself is a 3-star. But with the wine and the view, they taste like 5-star. My friend was so indulged, he thinks he is in heaven. Now I understand why wine pairing is so important. What I like about this place is that they have wine suggestion for everything in the menu, so it's good. \n\nThen we shared a dessert. Since it's so hot today, I ordered the sorbets: Blackberry Cabernet (favorite!), Bloody Mango (friend's favorite!), and Strawberry. I think the sorbet was the best part, oh and the soup too. My other favorite is the...bread. Yes, the bread with butter. I believe it's free and all-u-can-eat, haha! Seriously, it's pretty good. \n\nService: I like the guy who serves me bread and water, busboy? He is nice. The service from my server was not attentive enough, and it was not even busy, so no excuse. Plus, I don't know his name (not a good sign). \n\nI'll come back for sunset.", "author": "Marlis T."}

Almost as if the staff is writing them.\n\nWhy in the world is the service so poor at this establishment?\n\nFirst off, the view is wonderful. As far as I can tell, you'd only come here for the beautiful view or because you enjoy mediocre service. I personally like the view.\n\nI went to the Cliff House in December, 2009 and the service was atrocious. It seems to have plenty of waiters, so why can I not get served? I went with friends and we ordered appetizers, we ordered cocktails, but it was like pulling teeth to get service and seriously, those are some pretty mediocre cocktails.\n\nI reluctantly went back in December 2010 and you know what? Same lousy service! After waiting nearly 10 minutes with an empty bar where the waitstaff outnumbered the customers, a waiter came by and gave us napkins. She didn't even ask if we were ready to order. It took almost 10 minutes to get her to come back and take our order. Instead of spending a decent amount of money, we stopped at one drink because the server clearly indicated she had no desire to serve us, so why bother? My partner was really annoyed I left a tip at all and to be honest, she did not deserve any tip at all.\n\nIf a manager wants to contact me, I'll give you the full story, but no manager will contact me. You simply cannot have such uninspired service unless you have a truly inept management team.\n\nSee you in December 2011.\nHopefully with an entirely different owner, management team, wait staff, menu planners, cooks, plants and tables. You get white linen unless you sit in the bar, where they are sticky.\n\nOh and a few more questions. Whats with the freaking tree in the bar blocking the view? Who was the dim pickle that decided to have the bar face a wall of tile and not the ocean? You know, the ocean. The only reason someone would come here to eat.\n\nTo summarize: This place sucks on so many levels, it's like Dantes Inferno of bad restaurant decisions. One half expects the ghost of  Adolph Sutro to float in and curse the place into closing. Or maybe that's the problem. Adolph Sutro hates this place and is trying to lure it into crashing down on the Seal Rocks like the sirens or lore. If only this place was that much fun. But no. It just sucks and I don't think ghosts, sirens or Gordon Ramsay could make this place tasty, attentive or fun.", "author": "Peter G."}

Modern minimalism sitting right on top of the water. Literally the best ocean view from an inside-table you will find in the country. For that romantic touch, make reservations for a time just before sunset; watch the beautiful scenery as you sip on some wine. Inside, is peaceful and perfectly lit. \n\nThe Service... 5/5\nValet is worth it; my girl was in stilettos and a fancy dress, leaving her at the door while I parked or making her walk up the hill would have been cruel. We were seated within moments of walking in by a pleasant hostess; who gave us the best table available. After being seated we had cold, fresh water immediately. Our server was quick to order drinks and knowledgeable on the wine selection. A 'bread lady' was attentive to every table. Later, the server was helpful with food Q/A's.\n\nThe Food... 4/5\nQuality gourmet plates, but a bit pricey (you're really paying for the great service and location). The Beet Salad was underwhelming; merely a few cooked beets with different garnishes. On the fence about an appetizer?... Stick with the plethora of bread. I ordered the Roasted Maple Duck; a tasty meat with interesting garnishes (huckleberries, honey...). A good choice for non-seafood eaters like myself who enjoy gamey meat (although duck is not very gamey tasting). Tina ordered the NY Strip Steak; one word, stellar. Ordered medium, her juicy cut packed flavor in every bite (I finished it off). Even the char was amazing! It came with melt-in-your-mouth potato wedges and side vegetables. *(Side note, another reviewer said that her NY Strip was very fatty and unsatisfying; she should have just requested a new plate. This cut can sometimes have more fat than usual, unfortunately she got a bad piece. Most restaurants of this caliber will (or should) satisfy you if this happens). I believe the chef actually let the steak 'rest' for the recommended time (10-15 min.) before serving it, which would explain why it took longer than expected for the food to arrive, and also why the steak was so amazing. \nDrinks... I had the Franciscan, a bold red that wasn't worth the price. (Wine is either hit or miss for me, mostly miss because I know of $2 bottles that taste just as good as my $10 glass of Franciscan). Tina had the Sangria which was surprisingly light and flavorful. \n\nConclusions... \nOn the pricey side, but worth it for the overall effectiveness. Tip the valet well, I was taken aback to see the kid literally sprint up the hill, into the wind on a chilly night just to get my car back Asap. Like I said, make reservations at sunset and she (or he) will be yours.", "author": "Shane R."}

Alas I haven't been to the Cliff House in years. When you get there there are two restaurants to choose from. I chose Sutro's vs. the Bistro because they had more of what we wanted that night.\n\nThe decor is nothing special but as long as the food is good, I don't care, though there are cool old pictures and stuff to see.

Friday night special Prime Rib, I LOVED IT, made old school style, slow roasted. It was one of the best prime rib I've had in a long time (been to Lawry's and Burlingame Prime recently), can't wait to eat it again. It was served with a merlot reduction (with prime rib this good I don't need it) baby carrots and small baked potatoes. I'll be looking forward to my leftovers!\n\n3.

Hands down, the best Filet we've had in recent memory, melt in your mouth perfection, couldn't be any better, unless you prefer one smothered with a sauce. Luckily my better half couldn't finish it so naturally I polished it off and opted to take the rest of my prime rib home.\n\nInstead of cake the waitress brought a birthday sized serving of butterscotch pots de creme. I was going to order this but the server told me (when I pretended to use the restroom to sneak away from the table) that's what they give for birthday guests. It was tasty, served with candied orange rind. I would order this in a heartbeat, then again I've been craving something butterscotch. \n\nSaw several diners order the halibut and overheard the table next to us comment on how good it was.

We started with appetizers. \nAhi Tuna Tartare - pine nuts | asian pears | mint | habanero infused sesame oil \nquail egg \nVery smooth and put together by a waiter at our table. It was very good. \n\nDungeness Crab Cakes -- orange & red onion salad | basil aioli \nIt was average, not amazing just average. I did like the salad. \n\nHerb Roasted Chicken \"Under a Brick\" -- watercress-persimmon salad | goat cheese | golden raisin | white balsamic vinaigrette \nOMG, it was a complete little chicken that was de boned, very tasty. I ate everything but the 2 leg bones and I had to be restrained to not eat that. \nSalad was not bad, sounds a little odd but it worked pretty well. \n\nSteak Frites* -- truffled fries | bordelaise | red wine onion compote \nSteak was prepared perfectly yes I was sampling my dates food. Fries were ok. \n\nPumpkin Bread Pudding - cranberry coulis | swiss meringue \nThe Pumpkin Bread Pudding was velvety smooth and with a coffee even better. \n\nYou just can't beat the ambiance, with the ocean crashing in the background, my beautiful woman in front of me and of course my Little Herb Roasted de boned Chicken.  The 3 of us were very happy together.", "author": "Hugo E."}

Otherwise, it's just average food with really marked up prices. We went here for Dine About Town, but found out that they don't honor this on Fridays and Saturdays. Go figure. \n\nAnyway, we still ate there. I ordered the only vegetarian entree on the menu: Tricolor Gnocchi with root vegetables. It was mediocre at best. It was good to taste the textures of carrots, onions, turnips and parsnips along with the gnocchi, but it was nothing to write home about. The cream sauce was also average. Pizza Antica in Santana Row serves by far the best gnocchi I've had, and it's far more reasonable in price than this place!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Triple Chocolate Mousse and Captain Dan's \"PB&J\". The PB&J was certainly interesting - I liked it even though I don't really like the flavor of peanut butter in anything other than the actual peanut butter itself. The mousse tasted exactly like I thought it would - good. Nothing great though.\n\nOn top of it all, when the bill came, I noticed that they charged $25 for my gnocchi though I recalled reading it as $22 on the menu. I figured it's a nice place and I shouldn't bother asking for a mere $3, but asked them anyway upon my friends' insistence (and after I double-checked the price on the menu again). The server indeed was surprised this happened and said, \"Good eye! This is what we have been charging everybody and nobody has complained. I guess this is the dinner price. We will take care of this.\" I thought he'd come back with the corrected price and may comp one of our desserts, but no - he just re-adjusted the price of the gnocchi on our bill.\n\nBEWARE people!

I read reviews on Yelp where people said that this restaurant is more for people (or tourists) who want to enjoy the view rather than people who actually love good food, but I thought I'd give it a shot anyways... I mean you never know 'til you try! At the Cliff House, I ordered a cocktail, a white asparagus soup, chicken breast with risotto, strawberry shortcake and souffle for desserts! The soup, chicken, shortcake were straight off of the Prix Fixe, the rest were extra. I would say the soup was so-so but everything else was pretty amazing!\n\nOcean Beach cocktail. From their special wine list menu... it's named after the beach the restaurant overlooks. It was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Just vodka mixed with various juices.\n\nWhite asparagus soup. It was way too rich for me, I like New England clam chowder as much as any other person but this was too much for me. It almost felt like I was eating liquid cheese. It was really unique but just a little too much. At least it was plated really well.\n\nChicken breast with mushroom risotto. YUM normally I don't like eating chicken breast because it can go wrong so easily with chefs overcooking it or making it extremely dry. But this one was GREAT, the seasonings on the skin were delish as well as the actual chicken. The chicken wasn't the least bit dry. The mushroom risotto was also very yummy though a little saucy.\n\nStrawberry shortcake. One of my most favorite desserts ever! Super simple with cream and strawberries sandwiched between two crackers but it was to die for!\n\n\nFrozen lemon souffle with blueberries. Definitely to die for as well! The lemon souffle was very creamy and delectable. The special cookies with frosted powdered sugar and blueberries made what was already good extra good.\n\nI'd go back to Sutro's just for the strawberry shortcake and lemon souffle. Their desserts are GREAT! Definitely come for the desserts.", "author": "Constance C."}

I had been here once before at the bar, but not to Sutro's for dinner.  Overall, it was a good meal, but I gave Sutro's 4 stars mainly because of the ambiance.  We were fortunate enough to be there on a clear night and had a spectacular view of Ocean Beach.\n\nBefore I get on to the meal itself, I just want to mention that their menu on the website was different than the menu at the restaurant (no big deal, but be prepared to possibly see a different menu when you are there)\n\nWe started with two appetizers, the ahi tuna tartare and crab cakes.  I loved the tuna, it was plated with pine nuts, asian pears, mint, habanero infused sesame oil and quail egg, and right there at the table the waiter mixed it all together for us.  It was served with toasted bread and it was delicious!  I love crab cakes, but the crab cakes at Sutro's were only OK.  They had a pretty thick crust on the outside that overpowered the flavor of the crab itself.  A little bit of a disappointment that left much to be desired.\n\nFor the entree, my mom and I both had the Bacon Crusted Loch Duart Salmon...it was served with apple, rainbow chard, whole grain mustard sauce, and celeriac-potato puree.  I LOVED it...I mean, bacon makes everything better!!  There was a consensus that this was the best dish of the night.\n\nMy brother had the Bouillabaisse, a saffron-tomato broth, soft shell crab, shrimp, clams, mussels, and grilled herb foccacia.  I tasted a little bit, and it was good.  I personally prefer cioppino, but it was something different to try.\n\nMy dad tried the crusted snapper (not on their online menu, and not part of their specials).  I didn't try any, but he said that the chef had gone a little overboard with the crust on the fish like with the crab cakes.\n\nAs with most \"fancy\" restaurants, the portions were not very big, but what they lacked in size, they made up for with flavor.  Overall, my experience at Sutro's was good, but I'm not sure if I'll be back anytime soon.  Maybe for another special occasion.\n\nOne last thing to add, when my dad had made the reservation he had said we would be celebrating a birthday, and once they cleared our table, our waiter brought a Butterscotch Pots de Creme that was yummy!  I liked the fact that there was no need to remind them, and that they brought my mom a birthday treat!", "author": "Patricia P."}

I was hoping to try their calamari (my fave), but was only told by the waitress that they had just run out.  I would have believed her, until the table next to us who were seated, and ordered after us received a plate of calamari!  I politely brought this to our waitress' attention, who only shot back with a rude, snippy attitude and said they had just received some in.  Wow.

We saw people wearing jeans and tshirts, so we definitely felt a little overdressed and had a few stares coming in our direction from passersby.\n\nThe bread here is amazing! Each person got their own huge chunk of super crusty and chewy bread. The entrees were also great. I had the vegetarian mezze platter, and the falafel and dolma were very well prepared. We were all pleasantly surprised to see huge portions on our plates when the food came out - who said pricey restaurants only served tiny portions? \n\nThe bathrooms here were super clean and spacious. My friend and I were a little confused when we walked toward the bathroom doors because there were two doors with weird swimming-related symbols on them and we couldn't figure out which bathroom was for women and which one was for men. After standing by the doors observing people coming in and out for a while, we realized that they were probably both unisex  bathrooms!\n\nThe bill was a little shocking (all entrees were $20+, pushing $30 each for some of them), but we had a great time eating at and enjoying the beautiful views at Sutro's.", "author": "Karen L."}

Just kidding.\n\nThe food here wasn't anywhere nearly as impressive as everything else.  A little bland, actually - the signature Sutro's roll tasted more like pre-packaged sushi from an upscale grocery shop than real restaurant-quality appetizer.  The organic spaghetti with crab and shrimp meatballs tasted more healthy than delicious.  Even the Thai style seafood bouillabaisse was a little boring (Whatever happened to the kick from that Thai spice?)  On food alone, this would have been a 3-star review...  \n\nBUT (and you know there is a big BUT)...\n\n... on a nice Saturday sunny afternoon, there is no other place in the City with a better view to spend with family.  The company was awesome and made me feel right at home.  The service was impeccable - with very friendly and attentive hostess, wait staff, and even the bread lady.  Actually, I think it helped that I told the matire'd ahead of time that we were celebrating my sister's pregnancy.  Even though there were people waiting for our prime window table, the staff didn't rush us at all.  The view was incredible - we could see cargo ships far out in the sea, with white clouds overhanging the opaque blue sky.

We scored the prized corner table with a commanding view of the Pacific Ocean.  A major storm had just rolled through, so the waves were big and the sky was just clearing.  Notice where I started this review?  With the View?  It is truly stunning.\n\nIt's hard for everything else to reach the high bar set by the view, but it comes very close.  Our waiter was extremely professional, perhaps a little bit too professional.  At one point we asked for truffled french fries along with our appetizers and he responded by saying something like, \"We've found that when we do that, it ruins your appetite for the excellent meal.\"  Come on, are you my mother?  Realizing he'd kind of over stepped his bounds, he recovered a bit by saying something like, \"But of course I'll do whatever you want.\"  At the end of the meal, sure enough I could not finish my Salmon, and he asked, \"Did you not finish because you were full or because you didn't like it?  Because if you didn't like it, you don't have to pay for it.\"  Wow, a bit over the top, but nice to know.\n\nThe presentation of the food was a full five stars.  The Ahi Tuna appetizer is composed on your plate for you.  The plates are brushed with this sauce and that ingredient in just the right way to say \"eat me\".  Almost too pretty to eat, one guest actually took photos of their meal before eating.\n\nThe food taste was really good, a mix of 4 and 5 star plates.  I got the  salmon and it was cooked perfectly.  Crab cakes good but not awesome.\n\nThere were some really creative dishes on the menu, including this two crab sandwich deal that looked really interesting.\n\nThey have an excellent wine list - the Rambauer Chardonnay was a great choice and value.\n\nBe prepared to spend a lot of money here.", "author": "David L."}

Because of the aforementioned draws, you're likely to overhear existential conversations by persons with syrupy accents and sophisticated postures. My girlfriend and I sat near two gentlemen, each loudly lambasting each other over the importance of law, while we tried to eat our dinner. It was difficult to obtain a level of romance while the quarrelsome duo argued over their meal. Such outbursts as \"come now, let's not bring freshman law into this!\" were heard at full volume. It would have taken a jet engine to drown them out. To make matters worse, our table, being only three feet away from the said boisterous dining guests, made us feel like awkward voyeurs. Couldn't they scoot the table over a tad more? I feel as if they were trying to get as many customers as they could into the place. This is a restaurant, not a lifeboat.\n\nAnyway, the steak I had was amazing. The meat was pliable against the prongs of my fork, giving way to a flashflood of juiciness. The potatoes were seasoned in a buttery whirl which made for a great chaser. And the dessert - in my case the strawberry shortcake - was pretty memorable; it was a modern take on the pillowy after-dinner delicacy, with wafers being substituted for the angel food cake. \n\nThe atmosphere is all outside the windows, while there is none inside. If you're lucky enough to sit next to the window, at dusk, you're likely to encounter seal rocks in their finest - just beware of a pompous patron bobbing his head in front of you while he makes a grandiose exposition about the solar system.

However, I gave this place a 4 star since the view amazing and the butterscotch pot creame was fantastic.  I don't really like sweets; however, after reading the views on yelp - I thought it was a must-try and I am glad I did.

The menu and the food is solid at Sutro's as is the view which is why I keep coming back. However, it always seems like nobody that serves customers in the bar or restaurant truly want to be there. Tonight, Fathers Day, my friend and me were lucky to get a table at the bar lounge and it was a disaster as far as service. The bartender looks and act so unfriendly, I would never order a drink from him. And the wait staff, with one exception, would all be fired if this were a television version of restaurant redemption. And it's difficult to ignore the dirty menus and bathrooms that should not be seen by the public. There was one woman who was lovely to us and today was her 1st day.  Any time one of the waitstaff would walk by I would smile and attempt to say hello.  But since scarcely any of them made eye contact with me, that become impossible. Working with and for the public isn't easy, I know, because I also serve customers daily. The difference is I enjoy people and my company only hires people who foster an upbeat attitude and desire to be present and to make a difference in people's lives. The people here clearly are only in it for a paycheck. Will I come back? Probably because the ocean is gorgeous and the chef and cooks do great work.

If only it had waited for me...\n\nWell, of course I wasn't going to be cheap and leave the restaurant right away when my family and I had just been seated. We decided to suck it up and pay those couple extra dollars for the entrees. Started off with the crab cakes, but wait, $17 for just 2, no really, 2 crab cakes. Ordered it anyway because they were delicious. Crunchy, and the crab melts in your mouth. Ordered another appetizer - the cocktail shrimp for $14. Beautifully presented though. \n\nNow for the entrees. My mother ordered the steak frites. The steak was tender and juicy and those fries that come along with it are to die for. They're like ballpark fries except not as greasy and not as messy. My brother ordered the fresh local fish, which I forget what the fish was that day but it was good as well. Soft and filling. My boyfriend got the mussels, and they gave him a pretty big bowl filled with them. He finished them quickly because they were tasty and easy to digest.

But when we were seated, he decided to seat himself facing the sunset, and I had a nice big column and a wall blocking my view.  I had to lean over to see it.  This was a bit odd.  I think he was trying to go for the romantic edge with the dinner at sunset thing, but instead he seemed to be enjoying the sunset all by himself.  Fine for him, I enjoyed munching on the bread and butter!\n\nService was pretty attentive once it got going.  But it first took awhile to get our sever to actually take our order.  \n\nWe shared the Crab Cakes for our appetizer.  It was very tasty, with Japaleno and Cilantro Aioli, it was also sitting on top of a mango salsa.  Pieces of cakes were pretty thick but skinny in diameter. A bit expensive for the price at 17 bucks. \n\nEntree's, I had the Lemon Dill Fettuccine in a Pesto Sauce.  Average.  Pesto was very plain. Barely any lemon flavor to me.  The flava beans and peas were nice though.  Haven't really had these in a pasta before.  My date ordered the Scallops.  And finished it within less than 10 minutes as we barely had anything to talk about.  Quite awkward,  while I was slowly trying to eat my pasta which didn't really taste good at all.  He mentioned to me that he found 5 bucks on the street earlier that day, and was going to invest it in buying Lotto tickets.  Clever, but not something to be talking about on first date, other things are more interesting to get get my attention.  Great way to get me intereseted.  Heh, then again maybe he wasn't trying?  \n\nErm, overall, I definitey give Sutros love for their beautiful huge windows displaying the view of the ocean.

There was only one disabled parking spot for this large building. In fact, I believe it's the only \"official\" spot for the entire place, so if you have someone in your party that has trouble walking, particularly on those uneven sidewalks on the hill, be prepared to battle limos and others to try to drop them off as close to the door as possible.\n\nI love the remodel and thought the atmosphere was bright and exciting. The views out of Sutro's are just phenomenal.\n\nOur waiter was friendly and  attentive. Drinks did take a LONG time (even the iced tea), but I can only assume the bar was the issue, because our waiter seemed very keyed in.\n\nI had the duck, which came with a wonderful wild rice pilaf with cherries and apricots.  The duck was succulent and came prepared two ways - one crispy, the other roasted. Delicious!\n\nMy mother ordered the scallops, which came with a shrimp on top of each one. The scallops were tender and light, and perfectly prepared.\n\nMy husband dined on the pork tenderloin, which he ordered done well, and it was still juicy and tender.\n\nMy dad had the prime rib special, because they had no crab on the menu (his favorite thing to eat while visiting either coast). It was okay, though a rather fatty cut of meat (even by prime rib standards).\n\nWe each ordered dessert, and were not disappointed by any of them. Honestly, though, at first, none of them actually sounded very good, as their descriptions were short and vague on the dessert menu.  When we asked the waiter to give us details on one of the desserts (the trifle, which was not at all like an English trifle), he gave such a tantalizing description that we asked for more items to be expounded upon. When he was done, there was something each of us had to try. Even though we thought we were full when our desserts arrived, not one of those plates went back with a morsel of chocolate or a single berry on them. :-)\n\nSutro's could do themselves a big favor by having our waiter write their dessert menu, and give up on trying to be \"high class\" with the obtuse language.\n\nOddly enough, this large, completely rebuilt restaurant has only two toilets downstairs. Not sure how that passed regulations, but be prepared to either go upstairs to the Bistro or to wait in a long line (they are unisex, so guys have to wait, too!)\n\nThe only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is that the food was served on cold plates - by the time our plates arrived, several items on them were already getting cold. My duck breast was only lukewarm, while my wild rice pilaf was HOT (obviously added to the plate last).\n\nAt these prices, all food should come to the table at the correct temperature.", "author": "Valerie F."}

We ordered from the Dine About Town Menu and opted for the wine pairing to go with each course.  Overall, the service and timing was pretty terrible, which was most evident when the wines failed to come during the course they were meant to accompany.  My entr\u00e9e was gross, but the server offered to replace it immediately, so I was happy about that customer service gesture.\n\nFirst Course:\nI had the Roasted Butternut Squash Soup, which was just OK.  It was super earthy from the mushrooms and was bland aside from that. \nMy friend had the Petite Romaine Caesar Salad, and they are not joking when they say petite!  She seriously had 3 lettuce leaves and a couple of croutons.  When she asked if I wanted to taste it we both started laughing because had I taken a nibble I would have eaten a large percentage of her dish.  \n\nThe server was absent and never brought the 1st course wine pairing.  We had to flag someone down to ask for them, and drank them after we'd already finished the appetizers.\n  \nSecond Course:\nMy friend had the Braised Pork Shoulder and was very happy with it.  That was probably the best thing we ordered.  I got the Poached Flounder and it was so bad that I didn't eat it.  The redeeming part of the evening is that the server (when he finally checked in on us) acknowledged I hadn't liked my dish and offered to bring me another one.  I chose the Butternut Squash ravioli, which ended up being delicious albeit pretty standard.  It was sweeter than the savory, earthy soup, but also had mushrooms so it was similar to my appetizer.  \n\nDessert:\nI got the Gingerbread which came with Poppy Seed Ice Cream.  It was dense and fairly dry, but the ice cream was good.  The Vanilla Pot De Cr\u00e8me was yummy but not mind-blowing.  Again, the dessert wine was not served with the desserts, but when it came we enjoyed the sweet muscat.    \n\nThe Cliff House is just one of those places that doesn't have to try very hard.

Can SF live up to our expectations? Let's see. \n\nI booked reservations at Sutro's for my wife's birthday. There were plenty of options available but I picked Sutro's because of two things. The first is the amazing views afforded by it's name sakes location on the bluffs by Ocean Beach. In one word, stunning. But I was a bit worried that the food wasn't going to be up to par - normally what you gain in views (and by extension being a tourist attraction) you lose in food/service quality. I read some reviews on Yelp, Chowhound and Google and after some consideration thought it would be a nice experience if our food expectations weren't too high.\n\nWe drove there from downtown SF - nice quick drive down California St - for those traveling from outside the city the restaurant is located off the Great Highway (HW 1) and is accessible by 240 or 101. It's not the most convenient location as it's far off from other landmarks but makes for a fun excursion if you want to also checkout Ocean Beach (never, never swim or wade there!!!) or nearby SF Zoo. If you drive, and for the most part you really need to, parking could be a bit of an issue. We had early dinner reservations, don't laugh 5:30 (we are early eaters and no we're not in our 70s), and managed to get lucky as a car pulled out right in front of the restaurant as we drove by. Strictly street parking. We were lucky with the weather but unlucky with the wind - it was howling, 30+ mph. Took some quick pictures around the area - beautiful and interesting. There are remains of an old fort nearby with a trail head that meanders down a gentle slope to the water. Can't see the Golden Gate Bridge from here - it's just around the bend - but the contrast between the Pacific and the green mountains of Golden Gate National Recreation Park is amazing. \n\nThe history of The Cliff House is interesting. I won't get into it here but it's definitely worth a quick read on Wiki. There are two restaurants at the Cliff House. The more casual Bistro and the more traditional Sutro's. Don't know how much more casual you can get since Sutro's is definitely doesn't require formality - at least from its patrons. Very friendly and attentive staff. Here's a breakdown of our meal and what we thought:\n\nBread basket:\nNot a basket per say but you know instantly when you place bread on your plate that it came from Acme Bread - which is a great thing since they are perhaps the best bread company in the country. A++\n\nAppetizers:\nAhi (Yellowfin) tuna tare tare - prepared table side by server with quail egg, toasted pine nuts, pepper infused sesame seed oil and onions. Beautifully prepared and enjoyed the table side prep. Overall a nice dish - the pine nuts and slight heat from the pepper adds a nice touch but felt like the sesame seed oil was too strong a flavor against the tuna. Interesting concept but wish the oil was toned down a notch. Came with a side of toasted bread. Rated a B.\n\nCrab Cakes: 2 pieces. Perfect size as an appetizer, about 2-inches round. Flash fried for a nice crisp exterior. The interior wasn't greasy and was moist - most important it tasted like, yup you guessed it, fresh steamed crabs. Excellent. A\n\nMain: Red curry rock cod. Very good. I would come back just to eat this again. Perfect balance of heat and creaminess. The fish was cooked spot on. A", "author": "Sam P."}

How could my friend and I pass up having drinks at this lovely spot one summer afternoon?! Both having grown up in the city, we were anxious to revisit the newly renovated San Francisco landmark. We were quite surprised, and convinced we need to return for a full on meal. \n\nWe sat at a table in the bar area that also overlooked the beach. Definitely romantic in the sexy sense, but also just in the general loveliness of it all. Love the swanky, yet welcoming and friendly vibe of the venue. Young, old, dressed up, down...the place welcomes all. \n\nWe shared the cheese plate and crab cakes. Our waitress was excellent in explaining the cheeses and even suggested an order in which to consume them given the sharpness and bite. We both don't usually care too much for blue cheese, but the one served was palatable. All but one cheese was to our liking (too nutty perhaps), and we both thought while the crackers were nice, they had too much seasoning (altered the cheese taste?). The crab cakes were delicious as were the sauces atop them. Would definitely order those again, though an order to myself, as it's a small order. \n\nThe wine and cocktail list is very extensive. We both settled on a pinot noir from Anderson Valley...very classic pinot! Liked it so much I ordered two glasses. \n\nAgain, will have to go again and update my review real soon.", "author": "Marie B."}

The server mixed the tartare with all spices at our table, (just like Aqua, but nowhere near as good) with mint, pine nuts, habanero infused oil, and quail egg...but it was flavorless! The mussels however were VERY GOOD. The broth was creamy with caramelized onions. Sopping it up with the bread was good, but drinking it straight up was even better. That's the only reason why they're getting two stars for this review.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the Filet Mignon (medium rare) and the Prime Rib (medium rare). My filet was ok.

We were quickly seated in a booth overlooking Sutro Baths. I had to ask for bread, which was good, but arrives one roll at a time. No announcement of specials, so I had to ask about that, too. \n\nMy grilled whole petrale sole came with all the bone, tail and skin, which indicates a level of freshness. The problem is, the server had to de-bone it at the table, and I had to take the seasoned skin off, which is a waste of the sauce and messy. Plus, to me, fish skin is just plain inedible. I don't know what kind of potatoes I had; they were very thin and sort of pickled.\n\nMy husband's filet mignon came with truffled potato souffle and spinach, and at $38, was a bit pricey.

My man took me here for a nice romantic evening dinner to celebate my 25th bday. (nothing good about turning 25, except now, one won't have to pay that stupid BS young driver's fee when renting a car.)  Looking hot and sexy in my sweater dress and 5 inch heels, I stepped out into the monstrous weather. It was SO windy i thought my earrings were going to be ripped off from my ear hole. By the time I entered the restaurant, I looked a hot MESS. Nobody at the restaurant seemed to care that I now looked like Chucky's Bride and so I didn't give it a second look.\n\nWe were promptly seated for our 8:15 reservation. I didn't care for a window seat because it was dark as heck and there wasn't much to see. Dark windows scare me anyway because i always think scary white faces are going to suddenly appear. (too much scary movies.)\n\nOur waiter was courteous and friendly. He let us have our privacy and was extremely polite.  We started off  with crab cakes and wild mushroom soup. \n\nCrab Cakes- average and needed some accompanying sauce to make the flavors pop. \n\nMushroom soup- interesting and creative. There were 2 contrasting soups placed together in one bowl. The lighter color of the soup had a more rich and creamy texture-tastier of the two. The dark colored soup was a little bit more strong and bitter. This soup is a little bit on the thick side, would be perfect for two people to share.\n\nFor entrees,I opted for the ginger crusted Mahi Mahi and he selected the grilled salmon.  \n\nMahi Mahi- Wasn't terrible but I could've made this better at home. ( PM me for the recipe.) On the plus side, the accompanying broccolini was delish!\n\nGrilled Salmon- he ate it all but said it wasn't anything spectacular. Also said the giant ravioli was atrocious. This one ravioli was HUGE! it covered the entire plate. \n\nDesert, however, was a different story.\n\nTriple Chocolate Mousse- To DIE FOR! TO DIE FOR TO DIE FOR TO DIE FOR. Don't touch my mousse i will KILL U! Perfect concoction of white chocolate, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate. \n\nFrozen Lemon Souffle- not to die for, but pretty awesome. \n\nOverall, service is outstanding, food is average, restaurant is hip and sophisticated, view- what view? \n\nI'm just glad I don't have a weave, or else the rain woul've destroyed it and i would've gone from looking like Chucky's Bride to...........AMY WINEHOUSE!!!", "author": "Linda L."}

Not fun butts; the buts of \"it could have been good, but...\"\n\nSEATING\n\nI don't see the point of reservations here. A got them 1.5 months in advance and was informed that window seats cannot be reserved as they're very popular. We showed up at 6:50pm for our 7:15 pm reservations and were told it would be a 45 minute wait for a window seat. I already figured I'd never come back, so I was willing to wait for a window seat. \n\nPlus side: it took less time than expected. In about 5 minutes, we were seated. Downside: only one of us got to face the ocean.  And we got a nice view of a concrete walkway-fabulous. But we did get to watch a fashion show of sorts. It looked like art students doing a class project together. The model was wearing a poufy black and orange strapless dress with a black and yellow wrap...made me think amateur and bumblebee.\n\nFOOD\n\nAppetizer: $16 crab cakes. Meh. It was ok. Came on top of tomato confit that made me think of bruschetta. I was very uncouth and dragged my bread, politely ripped into bite-size pieces, through the tomatoes.\n\nEntr\u00e9e: $28 duet of organic chicken. The pot pie looked huge, then you lift up the crust: 80% empty space, 20% food.  The filling was good; the crust too salty. Even the bottom layers without salt flakes on it were salty. Chicken leg and breast confit: way too salty. Maybe it's my fault for not understanding exactly what confit is: \"food that have been immersed in a substance for both flavor and preservation\". Does confit = salty? In addition to salty, A said he could tell the chicken was dry by looking at it.  \n\nThe chive potatoe puree: the amount of salt overwhelmed my poor taste buds. And I have nearly none to speak of!  Not creamy, not delicious. The only thing worse would be instant mashed potatoes. I took a few bites, then gave up eating it. The entire plate was bad enough I didn't bother to ask them to box up the leftovers (and there were plenty).The chicken would need to soak for several hours to be rendered edible by reverse osmosis.\n\nDessert: the one highlight of the meal. The $9 butterscotch pots de cr\u00e8me was soo good! Very sweet, which I liked.  Thick, delicious. The garam masala lacey was a bit weird, but it helped cut the sweetness of the butterscotch. \n\nSERVICE\n\nService matched the food: medicore. No one was rude, surly or snotty, but the waiter didn't ask us how the food was. Five minutes after we got our entrees, she asked us if we needed anything and that was it. She didn't come back until after our plates were cleared. After giving us dessert menus, there was a long lag for her to return to take our order.  (A informs me that some would call this ambiance.) On the bright side, the lengthy waits allowed us to watch the sunset. And the person filling our water was good at it; I didn't get thirsty. Give that person a raise.\n\nPRICING\n\nOverpriced. Nearly $30 for salty, dry entrees. To be fair, A liked his salmon and thought it was very fresh. But it was unimaginative.  The service didn't match the pricing either.  I normally don't give a crap about service, but for $30 there needs to be service.\n\nIN SUM, don't eat here. Not for a one-time thing. Not even for the view.  Pack a picnic, park by the restaurant, and enjoy the view for free. There are places with better food, prices, service and larger portions. Writing this review has been my favorite part of eating here.", "author": "Yan E."}

Very happy with all my choices.  \n\nBroccoli soup, to me, makes me think of a take-out deli or something that comes from a can.  I was a little skeptical about ordering it, but the very first sip won me over.  Like comfort food turned classy.  A part of me hoped that a restaurant like the Cliff House would introduce me to something a bit more innovative, but their play of this classic soup won me over nonetheless.\n\nThe fried oyster sandwich!!  Oh. My. God.  First off, it was huge!  I could barely finish half of it.  The bread was good and easy to bite through which saved me a huge mess.  The oysters and the carroty cole slaw filling were to die for.  My favorite part of the meal.\n\nChocolate mousse.  I'm just a sucker for chocolate.  On par with what you can get in any sit-down restaurant.  No complaints, but I kinda wish I got the chocolate banana bread pudding like my friend did.  That one was special.\n\nFor 12 bucks you get a glass of wine for each of the first two courses.  Good deal and not too shabby, but if money isn't a concern for you I'm sure the wine book has something much better.\n\nWonderful restaurant.  I recommend it for a fancy lunch...  during the day you can still enjoy the beautiful view.", "author": "Jen P."}

There is enough room between tables to keep conversation private. The view is gorgeous!  Enjoyed viewing of ocean and sunset!

Although the food was fantastic, views were spectacular (we even got a corner table at sunset, I mean, perfect right?), I will say the only downside was the wait staff. At any high-end, pricey and \"special occasion\" spot, the wait staff is always top notch.

Sutro's got its new chef on Jan 1 - and he is esteemed as he's linked with Aqua's stars, the Fifth Floor and Michael Mina - and it shows - but, it's still on the edge of adding a greatness there where the food will match the location  The food is innovative, but still evolving, with bits of innovation, flavorful tastes but, as of yet, not as refined as a Aqua or Minna.\n\nThat said, we went there for Dine About Town with an extra of very flakey crab cakes with a fiery jalapeno tomato compote.  We each had the broccoli soup (not as warm as it should be) that was, well, very broccoli heavy, creamy and accompanied with a great puff pastry. \n\nI had the salmon (apparently flown in from Scotland) and it was quite different than salmon we've had here - richer, buttery but also a bit fishier.  Opposite of me, my date had the chicken, which was a Rosie's chicken.  A bit dry but generally flavorful but not as good as say a Range/Delfina/One Market chicken.  \n\nBoth dishes could have been a bit warmer.\n\nThe desserts - bread pudding and chocolate mousse were very good, but not particularly special.\n\nThe service was nice, friendly and knowledgeable about the strictly California wine menu and the dishes.  Not refined to perfection, but on its way.\n\nThe challenge of making this place not be touristy and making it unique is something that I'd like to see succeed.

Usually the food is excellent and the views are great.  We made a 7:00 reservation so we'd be able to see the sunset and take our time with a leisurely dinner.  We arrived at 6:55.  We were forced to wait until 7:35 before we were seated. I make note of the exact time because sunset was at 7:34.  We didn't specifically request a window table, but were given one, which was nice, but it would have been nicer to have a table on time. To their defense, they did buy us an appetizer.  I also happened to hear the hostess apologizing to other tables about having to wait as well.  Apparently they don't know what reservations are for.  You reserve a table--keep it empty--until an allotted time agreed on by both parties so that when one arrives, one doesn't have to wait excessive amounts of time. \n\nFor our free appetizer, the waiter suggested the Oyster appetizer. None of us care for Oysters so we didn't order that.  He became snooty and short tempered almost immediately when we ordered something else.  To their credit, the two appetizers we ordered were pretty tasty.  However, we received them while we still had our (rather large) menus in hand as we hadn't ordered our main courses yet.  We had been ready for some time, but were never asked for our order, despite the fact that the waiter had been by the table a number of times. When the server came with the appetizers, I asked her if we could go ahead and order our main course.  She sent the main waiter over and he came over to the table while we were eating the appetizers and said VERY gruffly \"What do you want?\"  We each gave our entree orders, but of course the entire meal was off timed.  This was the last we saw of the waiter until we asked someone to get him so we could order dessert.  We didn't receive the entrees for almost 45 minutes after the appetizers were finished.  All-in-all, the entire experience took more than 3.5 hours.  Now if we had been seated on time, been waited on with some proper timing and had some attention paid by a courteous waiter, that would have more likely been 2 hours and we still wouldn't have felt rushed.  I know this, because I've had that happen before at other restaurants. \n\nBased on the service experience, I'd most likely not go back here again.", "author": "Corey H."}

The waitress took the plate back to the chef who clearly wasn't happy about it. I know this because my chair was situated where I could see the whole (lengthy) uncomfortable conversation. Finally the waitress returned and delivered the message from the chef that there was nothing wrong with the meat and he'd like to buy my mom dessert. After declining dessert the waitress disappeared for a long time again. She finally returned with the bill. Apparently she had been speaking with the manager who took the steak off the bill. At no time did my mom ever ask for anything free. She simply wanted it brought to attention that she didn't enjoy her meal and that most of it was inedible. \n\nThe worst part, the chef stood at the window and kept staring at our table and shaking his head. So unprofessional! Not only did he not graciously acknowledge that the steak was bad, he proceeded to try and intimidate us and make us feel uncomfortable. Yes, I could see you! And I wasn't even the one who sent the food back! \n\nWe are likely to visit the Bistro in the future, but after this experience we won't be returning to Sutro's. We won't be bringing friends and family here and won't be recommending it.", "author": "Anisa D."}

It's the first time in years that anyone's done that proper, polite thing.\n\nSo, as a place to take a guest to the city (you can read other reviews about the view to the ocean, and the nearby Sutro Baths), this is a very good - albeit expensive - choice.", "author": "Dan S."}

I wanted something ethnic and cheap, but sometimes you have to let the other guy pick.  Anne really wanted to go here, and it's true the view on a clear day like yesterday is wonderful.  For $70, without tip!!!, for lunch  - One glass of Pinot Noir (Calera), One glass of savignon blanc (St Supery) and...\nAnne had Loch Duart Salmon over steamed veggies with something that looked like hollandaise.  I didn't taste it, but she said it was delicious.  I had a fried oyster sandwich.  I've been having a hankering for fried oysters for a couple of months now, so maybe my expectations were too high, but - the oysters (3) were tiny and didn't have the briny flavors we all crave in them.  The breading was average to below, not much flavor.  The sandwich was billed to have a slaw on it.  Well it looked like carrots (no cabbage) processed, not hand cut, very tiny with almost no discernible dressing.  So, in a nutshell the sandwich didn't satisfy .  The potato salad on the side with a mustardy mayo dressing was delightful, and I could eat tons of it.  The day was sunny and clear.  We could see the Farallones.  Looked like most people were tourists or entertaining tourists.  I would definitely take an out of towner for a drink on that mezzanine level.

First off, you'll notice the contemporary design of this place.  Clean and elegant, like a slice of the MoMA only with tall windows cascading over the view of Ocean Beach--definitely a great place for a date.  The setting alone makes this place worth the visit.\n\nBut not so much the food.  I had the caesar salad to start, which was reeking of anchovies, and the wagyu flank steak.  The bbq sauce gave the steak a bit of a tart flavor, and the steak itself was a little overcooked.  For wagyu it was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nFor desert I sampled the fuji apple bread pudding, served with vanilla gelato.  That was pretty awesome, and I would definitely recommend going just for the desert.\n\nLooking back, it's strange thinking what this place used to be, a gift shop, an old arcade with pinball machines, coin operated fortune telling kiosks and retro 80's arcade cabinets.  I'll definitely remember that setting more than I'll remember the food that replaced it.", "author": "Tony L."}

The day was the 31st of Dec around 4ish to 6ish New Year's Eve.  You never ever go anywhere like that on a day like that unless you are willing to spend a couple bucks.  I was actually surprised that the drinks weren't more.  So there's that.\n\nI also should say this:\n\nI live near Grandview Park\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-view-park-san-francisco#hrid:lZaHdArLKJndIXStqSxGhg\n\nI have seen more beautiful sunsets than dozens of people combined.  Sure it is pompous, but it is for the sake of the story.\n\nAnd I guess I should say, this was a day of discovery.\n\nMy ladyfriend heard about the old Playland At The Beach at Ocean Beach back in the day.  Our SF Coney Island.  The windmill is still from that time.  Anyhoo.... that was awesome.\n\nAnd I learned where the Camera Obscura was, and went it...\n\nit was open, it was a beautiful New Year's Eve Day... and the image of the ocean looked like something from another dimension.  As much as I lost it, I cannot imagine how those in the older days viewed this.... it must of blown their minds.\n\nSo as the sun was setting, walking back from the Camera Obscura.... we mused about going in for a sunset beverage.  Being quite keen on Sunsets, I could obviously tell this one was preparing to be spectacular.  It was about 25 minutes until it set, so we ushered ourselves into the Cliff houses stone meets glass facade.  I know the architects who did this, and frankly did a brilliant job while being limited by retaining the historic integrity.\n\nIt was New Year's Eve, after all, and the place was jam packed.  IT took us a second, but we ended up at Sutro's at the bar.  The place was lined with couples and friends and family.  There *was* a particularly annoying conversation from adult's near us about Bible class, religion, and sounding markedly ignorant about other human beings.  Sort of the \"chewing tobacco, country, and Nascar\" crowd.\n\nOther than that, the crowd was fantastic... just a bunch of normal people feeling happy and close on such a special day... and a special moment.\n\nEXCEPT... the three to our left at the bar.  I was at the end, my girlfriend was to my right, and next to her was a woman decked out regaled like a stunning yet ancient starlet.  Her presence was noticeable, but she is not the story, nor are any of their fur coats.  She was silent but forceful.. silent all the same.  The other bookend on this threesome was a larger man, cherubic, kind looking....\n\nI must take pause and let you know they are all wearing stylish sunglasses.  It is fitting as the sun is setting in our eyes, but these don't seem like the type that ever take them off... sun or no sun.\n\n... Whatever the case this man on the other end was very agreeable, especially for the man in the middle, and always seemed to laugh at the middle man's jokes and concur wherever possible.  He was in all black, and a sleek full length leather coat.  He somewhat resembled a less haggled Ricky Gervais, but that is bizarre equivocation to say the least.  The one in the middle was tall gaunt, with a huge full teeth grin that his lips could barely wrap aroung.  He was wearing a huge wide brim fadora with a large jade bolo style hat band.  His turtle neck crept up his bony jaw, and I imagine he might find himself with a rash after telling the stories he was telling.\n\nAnd oH!, the stories.  He was regaling these two with effortless moxy, a fervour of which struck and kept our curiosity during the entire moment that we were there.\n\n\nThe barkeep was quick, and attentive.  The marg rock salt and gin and tonic were perfect and refreshing for the out on the town experience we had had that day.  So we sit, sipping our drinks... and something amazing happens.  Our wonderful conversation subsides, everyone turns towards the brilliant glass wall of windows, and just watches as we spin around....\n\n.... the sun sets, and it is perhaps the most glorious thing I have ever seen in my life.  I mean that for a lot of things... I saw the northern lights and that still might be at the top, but there are certain things that move you and help give you a depth of understanding as to our place here, and the depth and importance of really enjoying every moment of our time.  Aaaaand the arbitrary moment in time that we were experiencing was just our idea of a new year.....\n\nBut it was such a special way to share it with someone you love.  I couldn't have had a more wonderful, exciting, and fun New Year's.... not possible in the slightest.  \n\nIt is cool to think that we are the one's spinning around and the sun is setting.  I like that very much.\n\nIn the end, the service was lovely.  The beverages were delicious but pricey due to the sunset.  I would have paid more... so much more.\n\nI didn't have a camera, and for some reason I was ok with that.\n\nSo yeah my experience hear was quite good.", "author": "Uncle Fishbits Aeneas X."}

The large glass windows afford an amazing view of the rocky shore and the ocean.  I imagine this would be an excellent location for a romantic dinner.\n\nLunch, however, was our meal of choice, and the place was relatively empty on a late Sunday afternoon.  The cocktails were superb.  Sutro's makes a terrific bloody mary.  It was spicy, though a little heavy on the clam juice, which made it a bit thin.  The food was excellent.  I recommend the Maine lobster and crab cakes for your appetizer.  They were savory, with an amazing crispy texture.\n\nThe prices are quite high, and while the food is good, you're really paying for the ambiance here.

Got the feeling that either we were not wanted or not a table he cared to serve (told me later they were very busy)\n\n2) Food serving was terrible. The wait time between Starter and Entree was ridiculous. I got the feeling our order had been lost and then hastilly put together but the waiter said it was not\n\n3) When the Entree was served the Scallops left much to be desired. Cold, burnt on one side and not cooked on the other (the waiter did refund the entree which was decent of him but at no time did he check to see if all was OK. It was almost 30 mins after finishing our entrees that we got any assistance\n\n4) Time between finishing out Entree and Dessert also ridiculous. Just trying to get the servers attention was impossible.

I was a bit apprehensive about it, but thought at least the view would be good for the out of towners. Sometimes you're just paying for the view, but the food ended up being pretty good. We got a corner table with a view as requested and the view didn't disappoint. To be honest, we actually had the best table in the house. The round in the far corner where the windows meet. Too bad it couldn't have been light for longer. \n\nThe food was good across the board. (And I have to pat myself on the back for the wine selection of under $35 each and all great.) The only downside was the busboy. This guy had no idea what he was doing. I had a salad and used my knife. But he took it off my salad plate and put it back on the table as he removed the plate! Then, after we were done with dinner, we had about half a bottle of red left. He actually began taking away the red glasses!!! Ridiculous.

That is if you're into paying for an expensive meal for a great view. But we couldn't see the ocean from where we were sitting at because 1. we didn't get the window seat 2. it was pretty dark. But had we gone during the day or when it was lighter, i'm positive the view would have been spectacular. \n\nThe food was good. For the appetizer I ordered the Cream of Broccoli soup which was delicious. The oven roasted organic chicken breast was good. It didn't blow me away but the soft mascarpone polenta made the dish totally worth it. The dessert was a little bit of a downer. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure for folks who have a sweet tooth will absolutely love the classic bittersweet chocolate mousse. But I'm not too much of a sweet tooth kind of gal so it was a bit too sweet and rich.\n\nOverall I give the place 4 stars. 3 for the food and 1 for what could have been a great view had we come earlier during the evening.", "author": "Silvia K."}

It's been on my list of places to try for forever so my husband and I finally stopped by last night for dinner.  I was always a little nervous that this would be an overpriced tourist trap reminiscent of the restaurants in Fisherman's Wharf - not so.  The interior is beautiful, they have a fantastic menu, and our server was a total professional.   Plus, we started freaking out when we saw their wine list - $50 for a bottle of Cakebread wine?  The last time I saw prices like that in DC, I..... well, actually, there just aren't prices like that in DC.\n\nSpecifics: we had a reservation and were seated right away.  I would recommend making a reservation in advance because the main dining area was pretty crowded. Bonus points to the hostess - when we saw our table, we asked if we could switch to one with a better view (not that the first one was bad) and she said no problem at all.  At 7pm, we had just missed the sunset but the views of the Pacific were still incredible.  \n\nThe food was outstanding.  I wanted to try every appetizer on the menu but we finally settled on the ahi tartar and carpaccio dishes.  They were SO good!  Both had great flavor and were perfectly prepared.  For entrees, my husband tried the bacon crusted salmon and loved it.  I tried a bite and would definitely recommend - it comes with great sauce and of course, everything tastes better when bacon is involved.  I had the halibut and when it arrived, I found it to be not what I was expecting as it was described in the menu, but it was still really good.   Great sauce - kind of a green scampi sauce.  The portion sizes were excellent and after splitting the two apps and having our entrees, we were stuffed.   Although we ultimately decided to suck it up and make room for the triple chocolate mousse for dessert and I'm so glad we did.  White chocolate + milk chocolate + dark chocolate + mousse = perfection.  With some after dinner coffees, our little dessert was the perfect way to end the night.\n\nI'm docking one star because our food really did take forever to come out.  I don't think it was our waiter's fault, as he stopped by several times to reassure us that it would be out soon.   While we were waiting, I looked around to see who was left in the dining area and there really weren't that many tables, so I'm not sure why it took so long.  \n\nOverall, it was a great experience - I'd come back any day!", "author": "Kristen W."}

I ordered the grilled swordfish, dungeness crab and fingerling potato hash.  Since I always appreciate crab and fish combos, that was excellent.

Went because of the new menu and Morrone taking over the kitchen.  Understood the risk of gong so early in gestation.  Michael Bauer was a little too enthusiastic.\n\nSummary:  Since I was in exploration mode, I'm strangely not upset in any way--you know how sometimes you feel ripped off--but the experience is definitely not worth the money.  The low rating is due to the weight of many dings across the spectrum.  At a restaurant of this supposed caliber (if price and chef are fair measures of expectations), each elemeitem should be top notch.\n\nThis is a pretty small restaurant.  Maybe 15 tables.  A nice, high-ceiling room with window walls.  Although it was dark out, you have that \"by the sea\" feeling and it makes a difference.  A little too dark inside; trouble reading the menu.\n\nOur table was a non-traditional tete a tete shape, which was fine but the traffic back and forth resembled a freeway.  Due to the layout, four other tables would have the freeway feel.  There was literally someone going by every 15 s, many doing I don't know what.  And since our table was against the short wall separating the bar, there was someone hovering on the other side that you could \"feel\".\n\nHere's one for the diners.  Please don't take a camera to dinner at a nice restaurant.  Flash flash flash throughout the night.  I guess it's still a tourist stop in some people's minds.  I think the restaurant could do something to fix this.  One or two pictures wouldn't be noticeable, but after more than a dozen, it gets old.\n\nThe food is, well, pretentious.  Looking at the menu, it's really hard to see what the restaurant is trying to do.  It was hard to look at the first and seconds and make any sort of plan.  They need to lose the big, flat, rectangular plates.  Yes, it's one of those places where your food looks like the Hawaiian Islands... something here, something up there in the corner and all that white space in between.\n\nThe ahi tuna tartare came out and for some reason, they had the waiter mix it all up and smear it around the plate.  The food wasn't on another set of dishes, mixed and transferred.  They took the plate I was served and treated it like a mixing bowl.  It just wasn't appetizing and I didn't see the purpose.  The thin-sliced toast was only done on one side and served in some pretentious pocketed drape to the side (think how silverware is stored).\n\nBTW, we had to wait until we ordered before someone brought out any bread to chew on.  I had the odd feeling they didn't want to serve the bread earlier in case we left.  I tried to  One of the many people trooping back and forth repeatedly by our table was the bread guy, who never could seem to notice we didn't have any.  He had the bread hunks piled up on a plate and dished them from there.  Not in a warm basket nicely wrapped up.  inattention to detail..  Just plain cold sourdough.\n\nThe other appetizer was the lobster ravioli, which had a strong Asian taste (teriyaki or soy I think).  With my Sonoma duck l'orange (too heavy a sauce), I thought that we had 3 Asian dishes and that's not what I thought the restaurant was.  The huge plate was silly here.  A small cut of duck in one corner slathered in a heavy sauce.  Up in the upper left were two little tater tot-like contraptions sitting on end and to the right, white asparagus in another heavy sauce.  Like having three different meals on one plate.  Aren't these things chosen to compliment one another?\n\nMy wife broke with tradition and had the prime rib, which came out cool to the touch.  She asked for \"medium\", so that should have helped get it hot.  The meat seemed a good cut, but it wasn't well prepared.  It's a tough cut to serve well.\n\nThe chocolate mousse dessert was fine.  The bread pudding was an excellent example of the downside of overly fussy food.  The bread pudding itself was really lovely.  But then there was this little dish next to it with a chocolate sauce.  Then a long dollop of whipped cream to the far right (another big plate) on top of a line of finely chopped nuts.  And you had what could only be called a serving spoon to eat it with.  How you were supposed to scoop up the nuts short of getting in there with your fingers was beyond me.  The thickness of the spoon was almost a high as the pile of nuts.  How much better if the pudding, sauce, whipped cream and nuts were assembled in the kitchen to highlight the combination and synergy.  I felt that I was being asked to figure out what to do with the ingredients instead of experiencing someone else's vision.\n\nService was ok, but not up to the standard of the restaurant.

We have been to the Cliff House twice and have been lucky that both days were absolutely beautiful (no gloom, rain or clouds).  We are so impressed with the Cliff House that we may host our wedding reception in the Terrace Room (which is also a part of the Cliff House).\n\nThis is a perfect place to go not only on first dates, anniversaries, parties, etc., but also a perfect place to go to relax and have a nice, very tasty meal.", "author": "Tiffany A."}

Yet be prepared to pay top dollar. Appetizers are the price of entrees and entrees start at $28.00 \n\nTo start, I had the watermelon gazpacho. It was served cold with a salsa mixture and a avocado mousse. Sounds fancy and it was with a wonderful service presentation. Very tasty! It was $12.00 \n\nThis is not an any night of the week type of dinning experience. When you go there be prepared for a bit of elegance. Table clothes with cloth napkins, polished flatware and tall water glasses. \n\nView next to the window overlooks the ocean and Seal Rock. \n\nThe atmosphere is very pleasant and staff is friendly and very efficient. \n\nThis was a treat for me as it was part of a journalism business meeting dinner. Very much appreciated! If I had to pay for the entire meal it would have broke my wallet for sure. \n\nRegarding the food itself, this is what I would refer to as \"new fusion\" dinning. For me the portions are seemingly controlled. They are very decorated with drizzles of particularly selected sauces and flavors to compliment the entree. The flavors were wonderful as everything, including garnishes were set on a square and elongated plate in a pattern display. \n\nFor me there was not enough food. I wanted more on my plate. \n\nYet in light of new research on the American diet, eating more modest portions is perhaps healthier for us all. \n\nHouse red wine is delicious, it was perfect with the pork entree I had. \n\nOh and save room for dessert. The desserts are yummy and like the entrees very decorative. The multilayer chocolate cake is very rich and oh so satisfying for chocolate lovers. \n\nThe coffee and cafe latte is good too. Reservations are recomended.\n\nNext time, if I am able to do so I will try the Bistro Restaurant upstairs. Yet, when I make my first million dollars I will return to Sutro's it is well worth the visit.", "author": "Jonathan F."}

Our dinner went very smoothly. We arrived a little early and decided to order a few drinks and wait at the bar before being seated. Our waiter was funny, but you could tell he was so over it. Just over being there and being a little careless and actually quite rude to one of the bus boys. We ordered the crab cakes to start which were incredibly small. They were brought out in separate plates for the two of us. I ordered the surf and turf for my entree and the bf ordered the lamb. My steak was medium well instead of medium rare, so it was pretty chewy and hard to cut through. I was also extremely disappointed in the \"surf\" part. First of all, crawfish, really? and second of all, it was pretty measly. The bf's lamb was so incredibly rare that I couldn't even look at it. The only thing I enjoyed was the lava cake and the cinnamon brittle ice cream.", "author": "Lily Z."}

We were lucky and were seated near the windows and the view can be described as nothing short of spectacular. \n\nOur food was good but nothing more. I half expected something that would really make me go \"wow\" - but the only thing that blew me away were the fancy little red tomatoes in my salad. If I were rating little red tomatoes I would have 5 stars for this place, but the red tomatoes and salad happened to come alongside my unimpressive fish of the day. The fish was nicely pan seared but had the skin on and a few scales left on it. Not a big deal, but again, part of the reason the food was a little bit of a turnoff. It was good, but not something I didn't already make at home. My friend had ordered the scallops, and they were good. The sauce it was served with was very rich, but with the richness needed something to be paired with it that would help tone it down. The Chef's choice? Little steamed carrots. Again, good, but not impressive. \n\nFor the price, you are definitely paying for the view - and you will definitely have enough time to savor that view because the service is a bit on the slow side.

It's a long drive out to the coast (longer than I even remembered from living in SF), but it is always worth it, especially on a rare non-foggy day or when one arrives to catch a sunset.  We had a surprise birthday party for my mom, who lives in San Diego, and this is always a good place for out-of-towners, and sure enough, we caught a perfect sunset.  But of course, you could put a Burger King on Ocean Beach and it would be romantic and special--what about the restaurant itself?  I am happy to report that the quality of the cuisine at Sutro's appears at last to be approaching the quality of the location.  There's nothing particularly innovative--I had tuna tartare and a steak--but everything was nicely prepared and delicious.  I also have to give kudos to the staff at Sutro's for being so accommodating:  we were able to bring in a cake (something that other restaurants in the Bay Area aren't always too keen on) and the staff worked really hard to make it a special evening for my parents.  Definitely a better experience than anticipated, and a good time was had by all.", "author": "Ty D."}

After a confirmed reservation and an additional follow up call from the hostess that day, we had 6 PM reservations. Upon arrival a few minutes before 6, we waited approximately 15 minutes to accommodate our table \"being set up for you.\" We were seated in a prime spot - the corner table with beautiful views of the ocean; the weather could not have been more beautiful. (The table had been ready the whole time and nothing additional was done to it. I can forgive that.) \n\nWhile the server was pleasant and professional, the service was dreadfully slow, particularly after dinner when we had ordered 2 desserts to share a couple of bites around the table. This was in addition to the complimentary butterscotch cream pot of some sort for my father which he gobbled up and said was delicious! The problem was in the fact that after my Dad's dessert, we didn't see our waiter for nearly a 1/2 hour when we were still interested in ordering a couple of desserts to taste. Needless to say, I was bordering on not ordering anything but we were eyeing another patron's layered fruit cream parfait and really wanted to try it. That was the best thing on the entire menu. \n\nThe food was just average. I ordered the fillet Mignon which was okay but nothing I couldn't cook myself at home. The mashed potatoes with chives must have been whipped through a food processor because they were like glue and luke warm. The spinach on the side was fresh and nicely sauteed. \n\nMy husband had the duck breast which was very good. Sister had the prime rib, Dad had some sort of whole fish and Stepmother had the day boat scallops - all were fine but nothing went \"wow\" to anyone. \n\nThe kids ordered a hamburger and the fish and chips - overcooked and over fried for each. \n\nRealizing now I have gone totally in reverse to what was served, let me finish with comments about the 2 orders of fried calamari we ordered as appetizers. Blah, Blah, Blah! Salty, Salty, Salty! No delicate tender taste of calamari; just over battered and over fried. In fact, my husband even said it reminded him of the little scraps you get at the bottom of the basket from a fish and chips order. \n\nWe still had a wonderful time - you can't beat the beautiful dining room and if you don't mind the lack of wow factor, it's fine. \n\nI will continue to watch the reviews to see if this place improves in the food and service department", "author": "Buttercream C."}

Our waiter was friendly enough when we saw him which wasn't often, but he clearly was just \"going through the motions\". Our crab cake appetizers arrived promptly and were ok, but not special. Then there was the interminable WAIT for our main course. It was literally 40 minutes before we saw either our waiter or any food again. (Except the bread lady who dropped rolls on our plates every 10 minutes or so without a word.) We finally managed to get the waiter's attention to ask about our meal and he blandly replied that he would check on our food. About 10 minutes after that, someone else arrived to drop our plates with little comment and no apologies. My turkey meal was dry and tasteless. The tiny amount of gravy did little to help. A side course was completely forgotten until we asked for it. It then arrived when we were done with our meal, again with no apology. My husband's salmon was very good, much better than the disappointing turkey meal. When we asked for the check it arrived promptly. Then it took another 15 minutes to get someone, ANYONE, to pick it up (even though we had our coats on, keys on table, clearly ready to go.) No one asked or cared if we enjoyed the meal or the experience. It was as though we were simply invisible. Very, very disappointing especially for Thanksgiving day.

I can't quite put my finger on it, but the way our waiter spoke and treated us made us feel un welcomed. There were mimosa's on the menu and when we asked for a bottle of sparkling wine for the table, he made it seem like it would be a lot of trouble to get us a pitcher of orange juice and even said \"well I mean I could get you the orange juice but it would make the table a mess.\". My stepmother really wanted us all to have a good time and have mimosa's. He brought us back a half full glass of orange juice for the entire table. We didn't make a mess. I asked if I could have something off the children's menu because I am allergic to cucumbers and many of the items on the pre fix menu had cucumbers in them. He laughed, looked at me with disgust and asked how old I was. He embarrassed me and said he would ask his manager, but the portion would be too small anyway. I wanted to get up right then and leave. I understand having a pre fix menu on holidays but if  someone has a dietary problem, why make world war 3 out of it? I felt like he was trying to up sell us the whole time and if he would have just been nicer, less condescending and less fake we would have spent a lot more money at this restaurant. More over, we would have gone back many times.The waiter knew his 18 percent was included in the bill already so felt no need to make us feel like we were eating at a beautiful establishment.

Amazing! \nLast year I met the chef, and talked with him. Great guy. \nUnfortunately I can not say too much about Sutro's, since they had a limited menu (most restaurants have a special menu on holidays), but for what I had, I can say it was delicious and actually a lot less expensive as I thought it was gonna be (no, I didn't pay, but I could see the prices on the menu). The only thing I can say, is that I would expect the service to be more personal, instead, it was rather distanced and hurried. Then again, maybe it was only like that because it was so crowded.\nI would really like to go back here, on a \"normal\" day. \n\nBesides the food, of course you have an amazing view (I love the ocean) and a great experience. \n\nI think everyone that lives or visits SF should go to Sutro's at the Cliff House. Why? The location is definitely 1 reason why you should go here, but the food is awesome too.", "author": "Helen D."}

I didn't know it was possible to make the word ravioli sound classy until i found out you can stuff lobster in it. Also got the dungeness crab cakes, only 2 pieces.

We came for lunch on the most gorgeous day and got the table in the corner with amazing views of the ocean.  A great touch.  The steak frites were delicious.  Agree with everyone that the truffle fries were to die for, and I couldn't get my grubby hands off of them until every last one was eaten.  We think the steak was flank, but it was really tasty with the accompanying sauce.  I didn't particularly care for the bread pudding dessert, and the romaine salad was made with the most bitter romaine possible.\n\nService was passable but inconsistent.  We asked about the \"catch of the day\" (non-DAT) and were told it was black cod.  After ordering it and getting it, we discovered it was rock cod, which is very different from black cod.

The ceviche was flavorful, tangy and interestingly textured. It came paired with a mini-pocket of seasoned flatbreads- very cute presentation. I felt like it was a challenge on Top Chef.\n\nMe and the person I love to see naked than shared a main entree of Lamb. Note: there are many fish options on the summer menu but two wonderful meat ones (lamb and steak) and a few veggie ones I noticed (angel hair pasta, and something mushroomy). For $36 the lamb dish was wonderful and large enough to satisfy the two of us. It came with 4 chops, a garlic flan side and eggplant quinoa. Again, the presentation was beautiful and the flavors of the meat and the side dishes were all splendid together. \n\nFor desert we finished with the coconut trio. For $9 we sampled coconut gelatto, panna cotta and a macaroon with chocolate sauce. YUM.\n\nThere's no dress code so if you're on Ocean Beach and you want to indulge stop here before going to the bedroom. The dining area is large and open with tons of natural light.

When I bit into the sushi, it was freezer cold. This can't possibly be freshly made. Other than that... everything was again, perfect.  :) Oh - PS - we ordered two desserts since we couldn't decide on just one.  We had the strawberry shortcake, as well as some kind of flan/custard trio.  It was sooo yummy. We've never finished dessert at restaurants before, this was the first... and that's telling you a lot! \n\nTips: Sit by the window.  The view on a great Sunday afternoon is breathtaking!  This alone is well worth the wait and value.\n\nFood was great as well. We ordered crabcakes for apps - it was better than average but not spectacular. I heard that the smoked salmon chevre and the sutro roll were really yummy!\n\nFor main course, I ordered the Thai Style Seafood Bouillabaisse.  The flavors were so amazing! I have to say, I was very surpirsed as it felt like the serving was HUGE.  My boyfriend ordered the pan roasted scallops, he said it was ok - I tried it and I thought it was even better than my entree. I like the scallop entree's simplicity and distinct flavors.  My entree had lots of stuff going on - but it was really good, so no complaints there.\n\nLike I said, I didn't think that the entree portion would be so large, I pretty much scarfed my food down and forgot to make room for dessert.

We told him and he continued on without comment or help. We were shocked that he offered no help whatsoever. He certainly didn't receive our usual generous tip. On the way out we spoke with him and asked why he hadn't helped us clean up the water.  His response, with no apology, was \"it was only water.\"  Appalled we asked to see the manager.  We told him what had happened, and again no apology with the response something like \"ok\".  By that time we were all seething. We were dismissed by both the waiter and the manager with no apology or attempt at reparation. I will never frequent this establishment again!

The views make up for anything else that could be lacking. I came here a few weeks ago with my team for a team dinner. We wandered outside first, since we were a tad early for our reservations. The ocean and the beach were right behind the restaurant, and the view was phenomenal. When we went to be seated, we were seated right next to the large bay windows, so we could continue our sunset watching until the very end. The night sky accentuated the lighting in the restaurant and made for a very pleasant evening.\n\nThe service was fairly attentive despite us being a large party, and took our food orders carefully. They were a little slow to take our order though, and also got our drink orders a bit confused. They were also sometimes hard to flag down.\n\nThe food was very very tasty. I ordered a steak dish, medium rare. My friend and I shared that dish, as well as her kebabs dish. The falafel and hummus on her dish was really good, not too salty, but creamy and savory. We also ordered a side of truffle mashed potatoes that we devoured to the last spoonful - smooth, buttery, mind numbingly comforting!\n\nWe thought we couldn't order dessert but we ended up ordering strawberry shortbread.

We got seated after arriving -- attire, please note, do not wear flip flops or anything you wouldn't want to wear that would make you the sore thumb of the crowd.  Dress nicely, like for Sunday's best -- \n\nThe jazz was a little too loud for my liking. The acoustics in the restaurant could have been better. Instead of the sound bouncing nicely off of the walls, it just bounced into everyone's face, leaving conversations filled with \"huhs\" and \"whats\".  Our waiter, nice until the end, he could have at least asked if I wanted coffee!  And the 20 minute wait for him to take the bill after the meal, was a little too long for my liking. \n\nThe meal I had for Dine About Town was pretty amazing. The salad was more than just leaves and dressing on a plate. It was fresh, crisp with a bit of edge to every bite.  The steak was a little chewy for my liking, but still - the flavors intertwined with every bite with the potatoes and green beans resulted in almost fireworks in my mouth, keyword, almost.  And the creme brulee, pretty good, but I was so full, I really didn't know if I could finish it. But as kids can say \"I don't want anymore, I'm full\", as adults, we just keep stuffing until our stomachs expand too much to comfortably sit behind the wheel to drive home. \n\nCome here on a date. Impress your date.  Come during the sunset, actually see the ocean and waves... and if on a Friday, enjoy the music too.

We came, we wondered about a DAT menu, but sadly that was only during the weekdays. So we sat, and looked at the menu, pondering about what to get. In the end, I chose the salmon, and my boyfriend chose the seafood with Thai sauce. I'll start by saying that the bread with organic butter was quite good. I guess I'm biased because the butter was like real butter, not the kind you get at Safeway, but the kind that can be difficult to spread on a piece of bread. \n\nTo review my dish, I'd say was quite surprised that the plate was full of food. Usually for overpriced places, you get a plate about 1/2 to 2/3 full of food, you know, the more expensive the less you get type of deal. But this plate was filled! Creamy mashed potatoes with a bed of vegetables and a large piece of salmon with a baked bacon crust. And also worth noting the three thinly sliced pieces of apple. Anyway the salmon was good, but to be honest I think it had a lot to do with the bacon. My first bite tasted a little blech, but upon eating the bacon bits that blech taste went away. The plate really made me full as I did not have any room for dessert at all. Usually I expect to be wanting more but this time, I really couldn't stomach it.\n\nFor $31, I'd say this was a deal because, as I mentioned, most places I've patronized did not give me that amount of food. Unfortunately it made me so full, the full feeling where only a shot of a strong drink and push down the food. Additionally, the lack of DAT lunch on the weekend made me sad.

I am a farmer, and I know a good beet. There were three kinds of beet...red, chioggia, and golden. The beets were cooked to tender perfection and there was a generous portion. I'm used to getting charged $12 for about a half cup of artfuly arranged vegetables in places like this, but this was a SALAD. I was half full when my sandwich came. The soft shelled crab was delicious, in contrast the the crab meat also in the sandwich. The broth base of my companion's entree was rich and complex.....everything, however minute, was just so delicious. It was painful to be too full to take advantage of the dessert menu, which looked amazing. Lunch was not rushed....I will remember this lunch for a very, very long time. It was just one of those special, incredible snapshots that life can bring. \nOnly one thing happened to mar this beautiful experience. When I went to use the restroom upon leaving, I wanted to admire the large photo collection of the historic baths that line the walls on the way to the restrooms. There were two different ladies, (bus-girls?) who appeared to be native Japanese, as I heard them speaking the language fluently. They all but shoved me out of the way without any \"please excuse me\" or any form of verbal nicety as they tried to rush past with carts  or...just in general. I would hope that perhaps a lesson in etiquette from the management could correct this unnecessary flaw, likely due to lack of cultural knowledge.", "author": "Deborah R."}

It is like watching a mediocre Elvis impersonator. \n\nIt is not that the food is awful. There just so much better in The City. \n\nThe Seared Day Boat Scallop Salad, Baby Spinach, Avocado, Rice Noodles, Yuzu Truffle Vinaigrette wasn't unpleasant, but the dish didn't pull together. The four scallops were plump and delicious. The baby spinach was just that and under-dressed. It did nothing to enhance the scallops. Very good avocado, but again it was a lone wolf doing nothing to pull together the spinach and scallops. The rice noodles were just annoying. With the taste of rice cakes, they were difficult to eat, and I'm ashamed to say, some flew off the plate and under the table. \n\nThere is a limited, reasonable and respectable selection of wines by the glass. The Crane Lake was $5 (which sells for $3.99 a bottle retail). \n\nI think the room is cold and stark. Without the view, I don't think Sutro's would have remained in business very long. \n\nAt first I thought the staff was rude, but it turned out that when you finally got their attention, they were very pleasant. Getting their attention was not easy. \n\nTo me, Sutro's is just the Old Cliff House in a new package. The old Cliff House featured the popular dishes of 60;s and 70's done adequately.

The seared scallops with the truffle mashed potatoes are my favorite.  The iced tea is served with natural syrup instead of sugar - love it.  Desserts are heavenly and a must.  Don't worry you will always have room for dessert because the servings are NOT what you might call large - or even filling, but the quality and taste make up for quantity - or lack of.  \n\nI keep hearing that this is a tourist trap, but as a San Franciscan, I see the Cliff House as a great restaurant I wear my slacks and heels to when I want guaranteed good food and the best view of the Pacific for miles around.

He was a little slow getting our drinks considering it wasn't busy. \n\nMy food was delicious, i got the bay scallops as well as my sister, they were perfectly cooked and tender. Not rubbery. The sides that came with the dish were paired well. My dad got the fish sandwich which was awesome.

My nieces got the Chicken which had my favorite, green beans with polenta. which was also yummy but the polenta kinda turned after a Little while. Not really worth the price for a roasted chicken breast. My other niece got the burger which i did not try but the french Fries were SOOOOOO good. When i was leaving i saw a woman with her kids and all they had was a huge bowl of fries in the middle. The french Fries are definitely a must get if you like fries. \n\nOverall i had a pretty good experience the only reason why i can't give it a fifth star is because our server charged us for some stuff that we didn't get and this is a rookie mistake for such a high class joint.

Ok, so the food we had was from the left side special two course meals (DAT?) according to the above reviews. She had the soup and a fish dish, which looked very minimal on the plate, I thought. She was done rather quickly with it, so it seemed to me that they could give you more fish, to not leave hungry. I had the basic salad, which was a large plate of lightly dressed greens, without any toppings. It was tasty, although I would have liked it more with some cheese shavings and olives, perhaps. I ordered the pasta dish, which came in a large asymetrical white bowl, which I enjoyed the shape of. The pasta was pretty tasty, with lots of veggies like asparagus. The sauce was ok but seemed a bit thin to me. My portion was ample, so I took home a doggy bag. We shared the key lime tart for dessert, which she wasn't big on, but I enjoyed it. It It came topped with coconut sorbet, and a rasberry? coulis with pineapple tidbits. Interesting looking dessert, but overpriced at $9.00 really. Our waiter was ok, but seemed to be in a rush most of the time, which made me feel a bit uncomfortable at times. We must have sat there for 4 hours, so perhaps he wanted us to leave.

The waiter was prompt, but very casual.  If you stuck him in a Denny's, he would fit in just fine.  We order cocktails and crab cakes for an appetizer.  The crab cakes were the only good thing we had all night.  The cocktails were very unpleasant, as if made with Gordon's vodka.  Not worth the price.  After receiving our entrees, my wife mentioned her strip steak was very tough.  She said likened it to a shoe sole, I likened it to an over cooked TV dinner.  When the waiter asked how the food was, and we politely stated the steak was tough.  He told my wife, \"Well when you order a strip steak mid well, that's how they are\".  We felt insulted.  True, a steak cooked to that temperature may not be as tender and mid rare, but a steak for $38 should not be that disgusting.  Please don't blame your incompetence on your diner's preference  He asked if we wanted another.  My wife lost all confidence and just asked for more bread.  My food was ok, would rate 2 stars.  I order duck with sweet potatoes and rhubarb compote.  The mustard greens on the plate were inedible and the rhubarb compote was so overly sweet, it overpowered everything on the plate.\n\nAfter sending the dish back, the waiter made no attempt to help us enjoy the evening.  We felt ignored for the next 45 minutes.  We asked for the bottle of wine to be recorked, to which he simply set the cap on the top lightly and walked away.\n\nWe ended up going to the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square to finish eating (10 pm by the time we got back down town).  The sad thing is they tried so hard to make up for our last waiters failure.  They knew we  were not having a great night and went out of their way to make sure they turned it around.  Management at Sutro's would do well taking notes next time they eat there.  Our bill there was a quarter of what it was at Sutro's (no fee was assessed to finish our bottle we carried across town), but the waiter earned quadruple the tip our Sutro's waiter did.  Again, it would do the Sutro's staff well to take note how proper service should run.  \n\nIf you are from out of town, save your money and time.

We were casually dressed, but that didn't stop us from taking a chance. We were greeted by a very nice hostess who directed us downstairs and we saw a table (with a view) that still had napkins and glasses from the previous party. I asked a waitress if it was ok to take the table; she said yes and that she'd be back in a minute to clear it. That didn't happen. After five minutes, she asked a co-worker, who looked like he was pissed off to be at work, to help her, referring to our table. He frowned while he grudgingly removed a few items. Of course he did not make any eye contact. Then the original waitress returned, finished clearing the table and gave us a menu. I already knew it was on the pricey side, so that wasn't the issue; the appetizers were un-inspiring. Couple that with expensive cocktails (and no waitress / server paying ANY attention to us for another ten minutes), we made the decision to leave. On our way out, we walked by a wait station with no less than six servers in there, talking and laughing, one with his butt up on the counter...guess that they didn't have much to do (??) and then stopped to tell the nice hostess about our experience and that it was the reason we decided to leave...she took our feedback with grace and gthough she seemed to be someone who cared; I am not sure if it will be delivered, nor am I confident that anything will ever improve there, service-wise. And that's what makes me sad; this place is historic and they have poured much money into its most recent face lift. It just isn't some place I will take out of town guests, nor soon to be residents again.", "author": "Cassandra B."}

We asked them to make selections for us of what there best happy hour tapas were...they brought us french fries and different flavors of chicken wings... hahaha seriously? I mean yes truffle fries to be fair but they were pretty subpar. The wings were alright nothing special, but is this really what you had to offer. I'm not sure if it was because a large portion of the party was young or what but it was down right stupid... On to the drinks. worst gin and tonic around not sure if it was bad alcohol or just something terrible happened but i had two sips and left in on the table.

Go somewhere else, this place is NOT worth it.\n\nFirst off, it was my birthday and my best friend flew in from Florida. I went to lunch with her and my boyfriend. When we walked in, the girl sitting at the front desk was on the phone. Now, I get that restaurants have calls and I get it that she cannot do everything at once. She took 5 minutes for this call (no exaggeration) and NEVER acknowledged us. No eye contact (she knew we were standing there) no hand motion that she'll be just a minute... nothing. So, after 5 minutes we figured out that we needed to go downstairs anyways. We were then seated and given menus by the host. We were not greeted by our waiter, we were not told his name. He just came up and asked if we were ready to order. I would think that when you charge $30 for a lunch entree, you are paying for service as well. We were not given any service worth this much. We ordered our meals and when my friend's arrived, there was a bug on the side of the spinach on her open faced sandwich. \n\nNow-- I have never had this happen before, but I know it does. I am not complaining about a bug in the food. I am complaining about how this was handled.\n\nFirst off, the person who took the plate away ( a bus boy) did not apologize. He said \"ohh jeeze\" and took the plate. Our waiter then came out and did not apologize either, but just asked if we would like something else. She ended up ordering something else. During this whole time my boyfriend and I are eating while she is watching us. She finally gets her food at about the time we are done. We are offered a complimentary dessert, but  we declined and asked for the check. \n\nThey charged us for the second entree she ordered. She, enraged by this, asks to speak to the manager. She talks with him, off the dinning floor and then comes and sits down. He then comes over to our table and gives us a half ass apology as if it was forced and then leaves. He at least took off her 2nd entree.\n\nNow, again-- I am not complaining about there being a bug in some food. I understand that happens. I am complaining about how a restaurant that charges $30 for lunch can expect to get by with some bull shit like that. I don't know what gave them the impression that you can give such shit service, but I highly recommend you skip this place. San Francisco has so much more to offer than this place. The food was mediocre at best and the service was terrible to say the least!! I was expecting something a little bit more gourmet than a white roll for a crab sandwich. Our waiter \"Christian\" (which we got his name after he came to our table after the incident) is a Denny's standard waiter at best. If you are in that kind of restaurant, you better apologize when something happens. Not avoid the table and act like nothing happened!", "author": "Alyse A."}

This is years of high winds blowing the trees back to grow this way.   \nThe original Cliff House was an old building, which many past presidents visited for fine dining way back.

The \"Bistro\" is straight ahead and to your left as you walk in. This is less expensive than downstairs but you do pay a price in that it's a lot noisier and not as nice of ocean views. I figure if you are at the Cliff House in San Francisco, pay a little extra ( ok, maybe double) and eat downstairs at what they call \"Sutro's\"  for the view of the ocean you can find no where else. The wait time is less than the Bistro, unless you ask for a window seat which I highly recommend. It's worth the wait. The host was very pleasant and made sure we were taken care of as it was our 25th anniversary. The waiter was great and we ordered Lobster Benedict. This was perhaps the best meal we have ever had. The eggs were done perfect and the sauce complimented the lobster and didn't over power it. All the flavors mixed so well together. We did get the crab cakes for an appitizer, but if I had to do over, I would save all the room for the main course. Couldn't ask for an all around more perfect dining experience. Price breakdown: Bistro- $15-$20, Sutro's- $28 & up, Brunch is $45 per person. Our meal ended up costing $95.00 for the two of us with tip and appitizer.

A sunny day with wind, so we got to watch huge waves crash against the cliffs with great backlighting. As everyone's said, the view alone makes the price worth it. As to the food:\n\nAppetizers -- The baby romaine salad didn't go over well: too much pepper and eating it took a lot of effort. I had the cream of broccoli, which was quite tasty. Both were beautifully presented.\n\nMain course -- The mushroom farrotto was both different *and* good. The barley worked, which surprised all of us, and the flavors were nicely balanced. The fried oyster sandwich was great as well. But what really wowed me was the steak. My friend ordered it between \"medium well\" and \"well done\" and the rest of us looked at her funny... until it arrived and was (a) not burnt, (b) not pink inside, and (c) soft, succulent, and full of flavor. THAT was impressive.\n\nDessert -- We were divided on the banana bread pudding, which was more like a moist, excellent piece of banana bread than the anticipated gooey bread pudding. (Closer to Irish Christmas pudding.) But everyone enjoyed the chocolate mousse, especially the nuts on top. Neither had the sparkle of the entr\u00e9es, but they were both pleasant.\n\nIn short: For DAT lunch prices ($21.95++), this place is worth it. And the entr\u00e9es are good enough that I'd go back (but for a less gluttonous line-up).

If you want to see me nekkid take me to the Cliff House and then dare me to go skinny dipping after. I'll probably do it. Why? Because the food is delicious, the drinks are amazing, the service is impeccable, and the view is orgasmic. Add in some great company and you've made me a very happy woman. Unfortunately there was no nekkidness tonight as I dined with the family for a bday celebration. \n\nI had the Seared Ahi (a favorite dish of mine) and they were super awesome about specializing the order for me (allergic to sesame). \n\nHaving an allergy and going out for food is tough (which is why I'm constantly yelping about it) because half the time you feel that the service person is lying to you about their knowledge - \"Oh! I know this doesn't have sesame or peanut in it.\" I'm like... \"Oh really... You spend a lot of time studying the ingredients label in EVERYTHING that goes into this dish? Like that salad dressing... You're sure it doesn't use sesame oil? Cause it is a Miso Vinaigrette... Or how about that hamburger bun... You know, I can't eat about 75% of the brands of chocolate anymore and I don't know them by heart, so don't tell me you do.\" Then, 25% of the time they can't understand what you mean by ALLERGIC and instead will give you extra, like when I ask them at Noah's to please give me a side of cream cheese and make my bagel on the paper rather than on the cutting board. Once in a while they give me a side of sesame seeds, or sprinkle it in the cream cheese. I'm like... uh.. I said I was ALLERGIC, ie- I WILL DIE STUPID. Then the other 25% of the time you get these FANTASTIC servers like I did tonight at the Cliff House and they triple check the ingredients, write it on the order, assure me when they deliver my food that they did indeed check, etc. I was in heaven. Instead of just playing it safe and ordering something I didn't want, I got to have my ahi. YAY! \n\nAnd... Peanut allergy people please take note... They make all their own chocolate in house!!! Meaning they use cocoa powder from fancy places (which is almost always peanut free) and then make it into chocolate there. So I had the cheesecake served with a roasted banana (had a sugar glaze like a creme brulee would have) and TONS of chocolate sauce on it. YUM!!! It was absolute perfection. \n\nAll in all, I have zero complaints about this restaurant, so come here (and invite me!).", "author": "Ali R."}

We made reservations for Friday, August 3rd. While the views from the restaurant are absolutely spectacular and the historical photographs were very interesting, that's were it stops. The four of us ordered seafood and we insured by our waiter that is was not only fresh but a great choice. Two of us ordered the Bouillabaisse, and the other two entrees were Scallops and Halibut. The Scallop Entree were just okay, the Halibut Entree was so overcooked that it was difficult to consume. It was so dry and tasteless. If this wasn't bad enough the Bouillabaisse was horrific. First of all to serve shrimp with their heads  still on in a fine dining establishment is just wrong. The clams and mussels were not fresh and the broth was not edible. Needless to say these dishes weren't consumed and when the waiter came to remove the dishes he didn't even inquiry if there was a problem. When you pay $30 + per entree you expect to receive food that is fresh and edible. We asked to speak with the manager which took forever for the gentleman to engage in our conversation, when we explained how dissatisfied we were with the whole dining experience, he seemed so indifferent.  As it turned out two people in our party got food poisoning within hours of leaving the restaurant and suffered for the next several not being able to consume any food.

The chicken dish consisted of the leg confit and a pot pie. The leg confit was nice and crispy on the outside, which I liked, but the inside was a bit dry. The pot pie tasted ordinary. The chive potato puree on the side was really good though. The salmon dish was actually pretty disgusting. I must have read the menu wrong, because I thought it said baked, but it looked and tasted more like it was boiled or poached. It was also very fatty, and very fishy (like it was going bad).

(the restaurant was only half full on a tuesday night).  by the time we had arrived, the sun had already set so we couldn't fully enjoy the view, but we were still impressed with the  2-story tall windows overlooking the ocean.\n\nfirst course: \nhubby had the cream of broccoli soup w/ a cheddar profiterole set atop a broccoli floret in the middle of the bowl.  aside from the slight awkward moment when he wondered how to eat the cheese puff and was carefully slicing the broccoli in a bowlful of soup, he was impressed.  i ordered the baby gem romaine lettuce and was served 3 small wedges of romaine, lightly dressed in a citrus vinaigrette.  found 2 slices of satsuma but none of the advertised persimmon, and the presentation, while lovely, was a bit unwieldy (trying to slice into wedges is not easy and the dressing didn't make it to the outer leaves).  it was good but didn't warrant a \"wow\".\n\nentrees:\nWOW! i LOVED the mushroom farrotto - comparable and almost as good as one market's version.  nutty and chewy farro both complemented and contrasted nicelywith the earthy mushrooms and shaved paremsan, very satisfying \"fancy\" comfort food and not too rich. i was also impressed with hubby's roasted chicken breast, served w/ bone in. i rarely order chicken breast in restaurants (too many dry/rubber chicken experiences!) but was pleasantly surprised by how moist and flavorful this rendition was.  and the mascarpone polenta was creamy yummy comfort again!  perfect for the cool ocean setting, with the clouds overhead and fog rolling in (it can also get a bit chilly in the restaurant).\n\ndessert:\nwe both opted for the bittersweet chocolate mousse - i pretty much finished mine and proceeded to help hubby with his! very rich and decadent, a chocaholic's dream.\n\ni also ordered the $12 wine pairing, which to my surprise included a 4-oz pour for each course!  (the dat menu online made it seem like it was $12 per course and even the dat menu the waiter provided only listed the first 2 wines).  the crisp mondavi fume blanc went perfectly with the salad, as did the slightly richer and oakier william hill chardonnay w/ the farrotto; i was going to order coffee w/ dessert but was informed that the raymond merlot was coming - it was good w/ the first few bites but then the bittersweet chocolate overpowered the wine, or perhaps the bitter notes made the tannins more pronounced...still, an amazing deal on the wine pairing.  it made up for the unexpected $25 charge on the bill for hubby's macallan 18!\n\naside from not giving hubby the 12 v. 18 year option on his scotch (or at least warning him), our waiter was excellent.  ever so gracious and charming without being overly intrusive.  checked in often, and the busgirl quickly refilled water and cleared plates.\n\nperfect \"date nite\" or special occasion option, i would definitely return (earlier to catch the sunset!)", "author": "Jen P."}

For my meal I had English Pea Ravioli and it was great.  I was a bit hesitant to try it but I was glad I did.  Then for dessert we had the frozen lemon souffle.  That was top notch too..

My last visit was for dine about town brunch. I ordered some orange juice to start and got Minute Maid from concentrate. I ate some boring salad and dry (though impressively large) schnitzel. We had a big party with several couples ordering differently, so people wanted separate checks. The waiter said he was all over it, but when it came time for the bill, he said he couldn't figure out how to do it because they hadn't kept track of who had ordered which drinks. He said it would take \"another hour\" to straighten it out. So we asked if he could just separate out the drink bill (which we were happy to split) and give us separate checks for our food. Then he said he couldn't do even that--this time he said would take \"an hour and a half\"--basically admitting that he had failed to keep track of anything. The prices didn't help either.

Vintage photographs and a male mannequin in a Sutro Bath suit recall the history of this San Francisco institution. The seasonal fare emphasizes seafood and Northern California produce, but rarely is it as impressive as the panoramic views. Nothing is particularly bad, but neither is it spectacular. An appetizer of salmon 'pastrami' had a heavy smoked flavor, and golden beets, tossed with Humboldt Fog cheese, were woefully undercooked.  The oyster-mushroom sauce topping broiled scallops, served with English peas and excellent risotto, was oversalted, but sesame-crusted ahi tuna on a bed of teriyaki lentils was sublime. Smart diners will reserve a table for shortly before sunset and pray the fog doesn't roll in, because this is just an overpriced, out-of-the-way eatery without the spectacular view.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

My cousin ordered the fettuccini and it looked like more of a mint salad than a pasta dish. I mean, c'mon, it's REALLY hard to ruin a pasta dish. It was not edible. My mother ordered veal and it looked like a huge piece of fat dumped on a plate. We were all very disappointed, especially since it was a special occasion AND a place we've all come for years (some have been coming over 50 years). Did they change the chef?

Prices very high, 3 scallops on a plate with a couple of tablespoons of chopped veggies for $26 a la carte. The rock fish ($24) had no taste at all, just overly salty, super-greasy, and a strange gray. The accompanying salad had no dressing. I basically had bread for lunch. \n\nWe met friends who'd made a reservation for a window table and the hostess, after much discussion, stuck us in a back corner with a bunch of plants. Boo. The view for two of the four of us would have been all right (the other two got to look at the jungle and the wall) but the windows were all smeary. \n\nAltogether, a lunch for four that had very little food and cost $164 should have been a better experience. We had to fuss to get a coffee warmup--it was cold by the time the desserts, ordered at the same time, arrived. Dessert was the best part of the meal but that isn't saying much; the bread pudding was dry as dust and the chocolate mousse was more sweet than anything, didn't much taste like chocolate. \n\nOh, and the restrooms are unisex, and the one I happened to use was awash in \"water.\" The puddle on the floor was so big I had to put down towels to get near the potty without getting my shoes soaked.", "author": "Frances C."}

Easy parking, we are always seated at a large table by the window, the food is not so frilly, consistent, really good; the wine list offers wonderful by the bottle surprises; the servers have time to spend with us and we can spend relaxed hours chatting, eating, watching the ships lazily meander in and out of the horizon and loving each other.  This is our spot.  Of course, there are better restaurants ~~ but none offer Sutro's breadth.  \n\nOnce in a while I'll just need an Applewood Bacon Crusted Wild Salmon fix.  The trick to not waiting if you happen to arrive after the lunch service but before the dinner service: order an appetizer and drink in the bar around 4:30 then ask the bartender to order your meal at 5pm.

She wanted to eat in a nice American place, already having eaten Burmese, Mexican, Italian, and of course returning to French food.  She suggested the Cliff House, which I doubted at first because having lived here so long I'm suspicious of tourist spots.  We decided to go, if only for the view and the atmosphere.\n\nEven though it was a rainy night, the view of the rushing waves was spectacular, and the restaurant was lovely.  I especially liked the Cowboy statue in front and my daughter liked the carved bar.  We weren't seated next to the window, but there was still a good view.\n\nThe waiter was bright,  attentive, friendly, and helpful.  My daughter ordered a bio-something merlot, as she likes natural wines.  It was only $32, and very nice.  \n\nWe each ordered different dishes:  Me, the mushroom soup (yummy, not too creamy or fatty, nice big bowl) and the beet salad ( beautiful beets, artistic presentation, enough for an entree even though priced as a salad. ) After the tuna appetizer,  my daughter had mahi-mahi.  She asked them to leave the pistachio crust off and they did so, and wanted a different vegetable, also.  We passed on dessert, but they seemed to be popular and other customers definitely enjoying them.\n\nI am glad we chose it, will definitely return.", "author": "Sharon G."}

I can't deny, the location and view are spectacular but besides that, I was not impressed. First off, there were seven of us in the group. I understand that is fairly large but I feel like places like this should be able to accommodate better. Instead, the stuck us in a corner, round table that fit everyone fine but was awkward and uncomfortable to sit in. I right in the corner, crammed up against the wall and it was impossible for me to get out unless I made the other people move. Also, I didn't care for the waitstaff. Because of how the table was situated, every time they came to fill water glasses, they had to disrupt the conversation and reach over the entire table. I understand that's not there faults but it's poor form.\nNothing on the menu really impressed me and it made me angry to see \"Peruvian potatoes\" and \"Alaskan salmon\" when so much seafood and produce can be found locally. I ended up ordering clam chowder and a salad and asked them to be brought out as a meal. Instead, they brought out the clam  chowder 15 minutes before anything else so it just sat there and cooled off. When the rest of the food arrived, which was slooowly, one by one, over a five or so minute period, I was not impressed. I had a apple and endive salad which tasted fine but had the texture and look as if it had been sitting in the fridge since it was prepared yesterday. The clam chowder didn't taste fresh which was disappointing as well considering they call it there \"famous\" clam chowder and cost $9 for a small cup!  I didn't really try anything else because I was so put-off but everything. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving it two stars at all is because I love the view and being able to overlook the surfers at Ocean Beach.", "author": "Caroline A."}

I was excited to see the newly remodeled restaurant that I had so loved in the past.  \n\nI was surprised at the change in atmosphere.  This was not the quiet, dim, elegant restaurant I had remembered but now resembled a high priced Red Robin.  Is was incredibly overcrowded and was a chaos of noise such that you couldn't hold a decent conversation.  \n\nAlthough we had made reservations, we still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated.  After making a special request two months earlier for \"romantic\" seating for my fiancee and I, we were seated in between two large groups and were largely ignored by the wait staff for the next 45 minutes.  This is 45 minutes of waiting after talking to two separate waiters asking for some kind of service.  Mind you, this is asking... not telling, yelling, demanding or any kind of aggressive or angry behavior.  This was kindly asking for service in a moderate, neutral tone.  After an hour, we decided to leave and I made a bet with my fiancee.  I bet her that we wouldn't be noticed on the way out by anyone.  Had she taken that bet, she would have lost.  We were completely ignored on the way out with neither a \"have a good evening\" or \"please come again\".\n\nI wish I could write something about the food but we never made it that far.  The view is still as fantastic as ever.  The renovations are nice but they have changed the mood and atmosphere to cater to a more \"hip\" and younger crowd.  For those of you who like loud and boisterous, this place is for you.  For those of you looking for a nice, dimly lit evening where you can carry on a conversation, and where your waiter acknowledges your presence... well... look elsewhere as this is not the place to find it.  \n\nThose days are gone and I'm sad that something so treasured and historic has been removed from San Francisco.", "author": "Anthony X."}

Of course you have to be choosy about when you come here.  Sunny, clear day time is the best!\r\n\r\nYes, the food is a bit overpriced, but what do you expect?  A place with lovely views tends to have higher prices.  I am just glad that the food is worthy of the environment.  I started the meal with a cream of celeriac soup which was a bit more sour than I expected.  But my main course made up for it.  I had a lovely Seared Wild Striped Bass served with Parsnip Puree, Forest Mushrooms, Savoy Spinach, and Foie Gras Butter.  Oh, it was so yummy.  The skin was perfectly done with a nice crispy texture that makes you want to not share.  And this was combined with the exceedingly moist and tender meat of the fish.  Oh so good.  And I am a sucker for good mushrooms, which these were.  I managed to enjoy my meal even though I was very upset with my dining companion.  I didn't sample much of his dish, but I did manage to snag some of his fries.

We were vacationing in Frisco and wanted to stop someplace to eat for lunch while checking out the sutro baths but nothing caught our eye and there wasn't an In-n-Out to be found for miles. My bf practically had to drag my body down the stairs leading to Sutro's because I took one look at the menu prices and wanted to bounce (expect to spend about $30 per person here + drink, tax, and tip). The wait for the Bistro next door was over an hour and it was already about 2 PM and we were too famished to wait so I ended up submitting to Sutro's. And I'm glad I did because it quickly became one of the most memorable dining experiences I've ever had.\n\nAfter being seated by our uniformed waiter with perfect posture at a table covered by a pristine white cloth with crystal wine glasses and neatly folded cloth napkins resting on top, I observed another waiter combing crumbs off of a neighboring table with a fine-tooth table comb. Quickly realizing the formal nature of our lunch venue, I felt a little out of place in my ripped-up jeans and track jacket. Luckily, it was still lunch time so other guests were dressed fairly casually as well. Besides, we were out-of-towners so I figured no one would remember the ghetto Asian girl who dined there that day. Besides the formal setting, the next thing I noticed was the incredible view of the Pacific Ocean from the large windows that encased this spacious restaurant. Truly breath-taking.\n\nThe bf went straight for the salmon. But it wasn't just any old salmon. It was apple wood bacon crusted salmon with truffled potatoes, bloomsdale spinach, and calvados broth, which is a salmon fillet crusted with bacon bits on top AND bottom resting on a bed of mashed potatoes and spinach all under a pool of apple brandy sauce. OK, even dumbed down that shit still sounds impressive. I had one of their lunch specials, a lamb \"sandwich\" with \"frittes\" (when I ordered this, I was all WTH ARE FRITTES? But I didn't dare ask because I was already feeling so crass in those damn jeans). My dish entailed slices of a tender and juicy lamb fillet drizzled with a creamy sauce (OMG I wish I knew what that was so I could bathe in it!) atop a hearty slice of fresh sourdough to soak up all those yummy juices. The \"frittes\" turned out to be delicately crisp battered shoestring fries (which came with ketchup for dipping but strangely, the ketchup looked so out of place with this fancy dish). \n\nI wanted to take pictures of these culinary masterpieces but refrained, again out of fear of appearing GHETTO.

We were told it would be a 1/2 hour wait to get a table by the window. We did not mind waiting as we got to explore the entire restaurant that was filled with pictures and plaques telling of a time gone by. We came back in 15 mins and low and behold we had a table. \n\nLast night's sunset was amazing and sitting in Sutro's simming on my distilled water and holding hands with my boy made it even better. Our waiter was a little aloof most of the time but still tried to maintain his professionalism..it must have been the view he was as mesmerized as we were I guess. Oh and they have this guy who comes around to your table with bread and butter it was very she-she. I love bread and butter so everytime the bread guy came around I got  a little excited kind of like it was Christmas knowing I was getting something I really wanted in this case it was simply bread and butter.\n\nOk now to the food...for appetizers we got some kind of smoked salmon and avocado salad it was tangy, salty and sweet all at the same time.....I also got a bowl of their gumbo spicy but not too spicy it was a rather small bowl for the price but it was tasty and that's all that matters to me. For our main course I ordered the Bacon Wrapped Salmon which came with spinach and mashed potatoes. The salmon was frickin good and the spinach could have been a little more done the potatoes were creamy but not buttery. My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger which is not on the menu (thanks yelpers) but they were happy to serve and he was happy to eat. The burger itself needed some mayo I think it came with some aoli the meat was tender and juicy it was accompanied by garlic fries that were crispy and crunchy...did I mention these fries were orgasmic ok maybe just damn good deep fried goodness. For dessert we ordered the banana cheesecake which was in one word heavenly. The bill was a little under a c-note with tip it put us over. It was worth the moola to have a nice and relaxing evening just a few blocks away from my hood. We will be going back to try the other restaurant which had a less fancy vibe but I am sure the food will be just as yummy!!", "author": "T H."}

I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical because I imagined that it could be a bit touristy and cater to that crowd more, but it was not like that at all.   We had 5pm reservations on a Monday evening.  We arrived a bit before and watched a beautiful sunset over the ocean.  If you go for dinner, watching a sunset is a must.  The parking is a bit difficult because there is only street parking and if there are a lot of tourists, you may have to park a bit of a ways a way from the restaurant.  Also, bring a jacket, it is windy on the coast, of course.\n\nAfter watching the sunset, my group went inside and got seated right along the windows.  The view was great, we could watch the waves crashing on the rocks below as we ate dinner.  The atmosphere is relaxed, but refined.  Getting our drink orders was a bit more difficult than it should have been.  The waiter started in the middle of the table and kind of jumped around (there were 11 people in our party) taking orders, which inevitably led to drinks being delivered to the wrong person.  A minor glitch I suppose.  Also, they only gave our large party 1 wine list, which was kind of problematic because we had to pass it around the whole table.  The wine list is quite extensive, they offer by the glass, half bottle and bottle.  I enjoyed a nice syrah.  Others had cocktails, which they all seemed to enjoy as well.\n\nThe menu is seasonal and is not very long, but offers a good selection of dishes that will suit a variety of cravings.  My friend and I split the crab cake louis as our appetizer.  It was very good, a bit different from a traditional crab cake that you would find on the east coast because it was much crispier and thinner.  I ordered the wagyu beef and lamb kebabs with hummus, falafel, tsatziki sauce and flat bread.  The kebabs were so flavorful and moist.  The falafel and the humus were tasty.  I particularly liked the tsatziki sauce, the freshness of the dill and cucumber was a nice compliment to the heaviness of the beef and lamb.  My friend ordered the masami ranch wagyu beef coulotte steak.  It was really really tasty.  The beef was nice and tender, perfectly cooked (med rare).  We split a side order of truffle mashed potatoes, which could have been some of the best mashed potatoes I have had in a long time.  They were creamy, buttery, and oh so comforting.  Others at the table had halibut and chicken, and they all seemed very happy with their orders.  \n\nI almost turned down dessert because I was so full, but my friend and I decided to split one, since we had been splitting everything else that night.  We selected the organic strawberry and almond shortbread with chantilly cream, berry coulis.  Very delicious and not as heavy as I was expecting, good thing too.  The cream was slightly sweet, the shortbread was crumbly and buttery and the berries were perfect.  I ordered tea, but they delivered it to the wrong person...again.  \n\nOverall a very enjoyable experience, with the minor problems of drink orders.  For the most part the wait staff was attentive and helpful enough.  I would definitely return for another meal.", "author": "Kristina D."}

Food was good. Smaller portions but that allows you to have 3 courses and not feel like bursting afterwards. Should probably be considered as value for money.\n\nBad points : The complex is cluttered with lots of visitors milling around either just looking at the views or visiting the gift shop or the other restaurants in the same building. Sure, it's nice to have a crowd to help get a buzz, but the overall feeling I left with was of being in a bus station, which, unless you like buses, usually isn't a good thing. Service was patchy. Ordered a half bottle of Champagne. Glasses arrived, cooler arrived, waiter arrived, \"Sorry we're sold out\" (Wouldn't you have checked BEFORE you got the cooler and glasses?) \"You can either have a bottle or by the glass\" We went for by the glass, which actually worked out a lot more expensive, but anyway. Tables are too close together and there's nothing to break up the dinner hall feel. Main courses took far too long to arrive. Washrooms are 2 single rooms for men/women, which meant either a long wait or a trek upstairs through the bus station / foyer again\n\nIn summary, fair to middling, but with so much competition these days, why risk a second trip ?", "author": "Scott C."}

The space is grand, with tall ceilings, but cold, all metal and glass.\n\nA taste for what is to come is the wine menu. The by-the-glass selection offers a number of good wines (La Crema pino, yum), but is tame and predictable. All wines are chardonnays , cabernets, pinos, zinfandels. You won't find any interesting or obscure varietals to try.\n\nThe food menu continues this trend, but with a focus on fish given the sea's proximity. It is also overpriced. We had the salumi plate, good but nothing special, except for the tasty lavender mustard; the soup special, again tasty, but not memorable; the scallops, ditto; and the wagyu beef, which was very flavorful, but had some connective tissue that make it a little though to chew.\n\nThe end feeling is one of \"meh\". One can't help to feel that Sutro's is more an attempt to pretend to be high end than more than an effort to achieve it. They understand that most of their clients will be tourist, and therefore they play it safe on the wine list and menu.

I saw shorts, athletic shoes, etc. We dressed for dinner, but it does take away from the experience when you are expecting fine dining and people are dressed more for a bbq. We actually took public transportation via the Geary Street Muni the day before to The Cliff House and decided on taking a cab instead, the following day.

Lunch has a come-as-you-are vibe that lets you feel comfortable in jeans or a wedding tux (and you'll see both.)  At our waiter's recommendation, we shared the shrimp tempura appetizer that had amazingly sweet, fresh shrimp fried  in a crisp, greaseless batter that had lots of flavor with a touch of spice. Five fat shrimp made it a nice appetizer to share. My husband had the steak frites, which was a perfectly medium rare, flavorful piece of beef with a generous portion of wonderful  truffle fries (that he was forced to share!) I had a 'tongue & cheeks\" papardella pasta which had, yes, beef tongue and beef cheeks...all very tender and flavorful, with mushrooms, crisp fried shards of Brussels sprouts, and beautifully trimmed nuggets of crunchy carrots and zucchini. The unctuous sauce coated every pasta strand and gave the dish a luxurious mouth-feel. We also encourage trying the dessert menu. We had a satiny butterscotch mousse that, with a dab of not-from-the-can whipped cream, seemed to make you want to close your eyes and swoon with every bite. Yep, this was a fantastic meal. We also had a very helpful waiter who steered us towards some of the best choices and let me know the 'tongue and cheek' dish was one he ordered when visiting the restaurant with friends on his off night. As others have said, they've found a great bread provider. It's SF sourdough, but with an artisan twist. Lovely. And the serving of sweet butter with a sprinkle of crunchy Hawaiian red sea salt was an ideal topper. It gives me more to do with the red and black sea salt I brought back from our recent trip to the Big Island ! With a couple of great Bloody Mary's to start and  espressos with our dessert, this was a $100+ lunch. But on a sunny, clear day, it's one of the most magnificent views in the Bay Area and on an overcast or stormy day, it's one of the most dramatic ones.

I ordered the the petite caesar salad with a side of grilled chicken; the chicken kind of tasted like fish. The lettuce of the salad tasted like paint. That meal didn't go well. For $117.00 we got 2 glasses of wine, a fountain drink, caesar salad, salmon, mussels, and a desert sampler. The whole meal tasted fantastic. Except the salad.

Perhaps it was the managements fault or they were understaffed but he had no right to take it out on us.  We had no choice but to hang out because we were waiting for our reservations. So finally, after he did say he'd be with us in a minute, he asked us what we wanted.  I was in the mood for a bellini - but I forgot that it was called that so I said the drink with the champagne and peach.  And he gave me so much attitude I wanted to slap him! He replied really snidely, 'Oh you mean a Bellini?' Snarl Growl. :P 'Oh yeah! A Bellini - that's what I meant. What kind of peach do you use?' I asked this because different places make their drinks in different ways. Again with the attitude, 'Peach. Peach puree of course.' It's not an of course.

So we took a table with no view, who has time for this?! But that was not the worst part! Our waiter was horrible. He simply ignored us while serving  the tables for people who came later.  Few times I had to stand up and look for him. My friends were seriously puzzled  with his behavior and thought that he didn't like them because of our accent. I had to reassure them that San Francisco is not really the place where you can have trouble having an accent (right?!). I still regret we didn't just get up and go somewhere else, because everybody got extremely annoyed and disappointed and our evening was ruined. It just felt like we were really unwelcome there. And it was their only evening in San Francisco. \nThe food was just OK. It was eatable, but definitely not worth all the trouble and pretty high prices.

They cooked my steak exactly as I asked them to and the way they arrange things on your plate is pretty novel and artful. I didn't find it too expensive. The view is incredible. The architecture of the building is gorgeous and watching the waves crash against the rocks outside the glass windows can be spellbinding. Not everything about this place is awesome, though. My girlfriend and I were barely ten minutes late for our noon reservation and they threw it out and made us wait until things died down to be seated. The waitress we got was also a little annoying. We'd barely sat down when she came and pestered us about whether or not we knew what we wanted to eat. We asked for some more time to study the oddly-organized menu, and she appeared again about two minutes later. This happened three times, and then when we were finally ready she was nowhere to be found. Aside from that, it's a great place to have lunch or dinner, especially if you're big on great views.", "author": "Anthony L."}

This place would get four stars, but service, specifcally our server Veronica, made for a poor experience. We had to ask for water and bread -- we never got the bread. Off all things, she opened the bill to look at her tip right in front of us...?! No class.", "author": "Jim T."}

It came with this fabulous little risotto stuffed with blue cheese deal that had a nice crunchy crust and that was a highlight for sure in my book.  However we started with the blue crab sushi roll and for $16 it was not impressive in the least.  Aside from that, the service was minimal and  the food was fabulous and it is a very romantic place to take a date.", "author": "Nicole L."}

George Morrone has made quite a difference. Lobster ravioli was amazing as were the frites accompanying the steak on my guest's order. Lots of attention to detail and beautiful service.

A lot of people-watching was going on in an understated way and a lot of stylish people were there being happily blinked at.   Regarding the fare, I had excellent halibut and the perfect banana cheesecake with Valrhona chocolate afterwards. The only qualm anyone had was that my sister's boyfriend's scallops were a tad undercooked.  The service was perfect.", "author": "bridget p."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-03", "description": "My husband and I celebrated his birthday here, and were fortunate to score a window table at sunset, on a fogless evening.  The corn soup was tasty; too bad we had to ask for bread *after* we were done with it.  Cocktails and wines by the glass seemed fairly priced for the location.  My halibut with pistou and tomato water risotto was tender, moist and delicious.  For $32, I wish there was carrot or some vegetable with it.  My husband enjoyed his steak and au gratin potatoes.   The major flaw was seeing the dirty/dusty woodwork separating the bar and restaurant, and more dust on the windowsill.  Hope the dust didn't fly into our soup!", "author": "Trina L."}

I came here with my co workers for our annual Christmas Luncheon and I was about 8months pregnant. This is a great tourist spot with good service and lovely view of Ocean Beach. However this is not a spot where hungry pregnant women should be. I ordered the stuffed pasta which cost about $16. Our waitress brought me my plate and boy!! was I surprised. Four stuffed pastas, with shredded mini clams (it literally looked like they took one clam and chopped it up into tiny pieces and sprinkled it onto my pasta) and to make it worse they placed it into this huge, in what look like a soup bowl. Now for $16 it wasn't worth it, I could've made my own pasta dish to feed a family of 4-6 with $16. After I scarfed down my four pasta pieces, I said goodbye to my co workers and headed to a chinese take out place by my home and for $5, got a whole meal to complete my hunger!! Aside from the expensive meals, theres parking available, the hostess/waiters/waitresses are all friendly people and the view is beautiful.", "author": "Anonymous P."}

My husband thought that it would be great to go there for our anniversary.  He requested a window table, which was nice.  You'd think that you'd be sure to have a nice meal on a mellow Wed. night.  We were seated and sat there waiting for 25 minutes without be greeted by our server or even having our water glasses filled.  We knew that the evening would have only gone downhill from there.  So, we decided to cut our losses and leave.  We spoke with the manager, who had been standing at the bar the whole time chatting with the bartender.  His response was, \"well, your server is having a tough night.\"   I guess you can have this attitude when you know someone will always fill your table--qualitiy service and food don't seem to matter.  I'm just glad that I wasn't a tourist in this situation, without somewhere else to go.  My husband and I headed to a neighboorhood restaurant that we hadn't been to in years and had a great dinner.  Saved some big time $$$ while we were at it.  Don't bother going here, regardless of the view.", "author": "Frannie R."}

SPECTACULAR and panoramic view of the ocean. Architecture is stunning. Our waiter was an absolute delight. Like the old time waiters. He was so much fun. We had a fantastick Caesar salad, crab cakes weren't that special (but I'm not that big on crabcakes - I love fresh crab unadulterated), french bread was sweet and wonderful, latte's and opera cake were OK. The butterscotch dessert was very yummy. And, the price was way high for the little amount of food. At $60 which included tax and tip we were kind of hungry but didn't want to dish out more money for lunch. Here's the thing...a waiter brought a small dessert and candle, while singing happy birthday when he overheard it was my sister's birthday. It was a wonderful experience and the view and service made up for the foods that were just OK. Next time I'll try the soup which looked as good as the caesar was (great caesar). It's such a Beautiful spot!", "author": "Nicoletta K."}

When making our reservation I requested a window seat, however they said they could not accommodate the request until we arrived for our reservation. Upon arrival they put us right at the window with an excellent ocean view. The service was very good as well, they make some very good wine recommendations, and when my girlfriend asked for a suggestion and they brought her their recommendation, she did not realized it had a lot of pepper (which she cannot stand), so when we politely informed them of this, they asked if there was something they could replace it with. In the mean time, they brought out an appetizer on the house for her to have while waiting for her dinner. (though I think she decided to eat my dinner instead). The food was really good, but the view and experience was great. I would definitely recommend the experience of dining at Sutro's at the Cliff House.", "author": "Rob P."}
