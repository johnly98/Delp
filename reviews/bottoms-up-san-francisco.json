I assured her that my animal was indeed a service dog but she kept asking for paperwork and if you know anything about the American disabilities act or service dogs there is no such thing as paperwork or registration for service dogs. Furthermore she was extremely rude about it, I could have accepted it if she would have been nice about it but she was not. I'm OK with it because I don't plan to set foot on your establishment again but I did file a complaint with the Department of Justice, it takes a while but you will receive a notice.\n\nI would suggest that you train your employees on that least being kinder to older people And I find it very insulting that not only what she rude but even after I pointed out that I was a veteran with a service dog she still dismiss me in an extremely rude manner.\n\nRead the americans disabilities act rules:\n\nQ7. What questions can a covered entity's employees ask to determine if a dog is a service animal?\n\nA. In situations where it is not obvious that the dog is a service animal, staff may ask only two specific questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability? and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform? Staff are not allowed to request any documentation for the dog, require that the dog demonstrate its task, or inquire about the nature of the person's disability.\n\nDo you see where an establishment is not allowed to ask for any documentation? Your employee is clearly in violation of the ADA law. Be sure that I will not let this go so that you will never make another person go through what I went through with your employee, she humiliated me and treated me horribly.", "author": "Diana S."}

Got there a little before 6pm and kitchen was not up and running...i knew how it felt to be to under staffed so i was quite patient. They had 2 bartenders and 2 servers and a fully packed bar. We placed our order but it took forever... but that wasn't the issue. We got our nachos and then later our wings. I then placed an order of jasmine rice.... i shit u not that shit took one hr. One effing hr for one scoop of jasmine rice after asking the server over 5x or i probably would not of got it at all. So i decided bring my ass down the block and get me a burrito because after 2 hrs of waiting, i was starving. So i sure did bring my burrito in the bar and long and behold all of a sudden i finally get the attention n service, but it sure wasn't pleasant. She told me to no outside food. Ok i get it because it is policy but fu... give me my damn food i ordered 2hrs ago then i wouldn't have this problem. So the owner and i got into argument, i told her monkey ass that on the busiest day she should not be understaffed and that she is losing money. Then along came the bartender in the picture saying that i didn't wait that long for my items, the nerve of this bitch. This whole situation could of been all good if they would of told their patrons the eff is going on and how long it would take so my monkey ass wouldn't have ordered shit.. so no thank you to bottoms up because my bottom is up and out that place in a heart beat.

When we kept refusing, we were asked to give up our bar seats. We moved to a standing table and were soon asked to give up the table.

Turns out when my cousin closed her tab over at the other place, they gave back her card and I.D. and she totally didn't even think twice about it. So when she pulled her I.D. for the bouncer to see he looked at her and said \"Are you serious?\" and she was like \"Dude that's totally me!\" turns out it was an I.D. for an African-American male with dreads HAHAHAHAHA\n\nOn top of that, I guess the manager thought she was underage so he comes out and says \"No, it's okay you can come in still.\" WOW Bottom's Up, you are awesome! hahaha\n\nOther than that hilarious episode, the drinks are decently priced, the DJ isn't too bad and their \"End-of-the-World shot\" is crackin'!", "author": "Mellani L."}

Some of the bartenders are not proactive, they dont really ask you if you want anything from time to time. They expect you to stand up, wave your arm, scream on top of the music and flag em down. They should really be less passive and ask customers if they need anything some times. Not all the time, but when a guy been sitting there for a awhile with his finished drink, I think it's time to ask. Just my opinion. \n\n2.) The music is SO DAMN LOUD! I mean jesus. I know its a bar, but godamn, it gets to point where my eardrums hurts and I cant hear what the girl that is sitting right next to me is saying and vice versa. When you have to scream into the ears of the person right next to you every time, that means the music is too dam loud. I even saw the bar owner cover her ears.\n\nOverall, it's a decent bar with nice ambiance. Mostly an Asian crowd. There's usually always street parking, but after 6pm, you can park in the BOA parking lot just across the street. \n\nBeer is average priced and shots are pretty expensive compared to other bars.

So after a few minutes my friends and I moved over to the table and chairs and hung out. Soon the place started getting crowded.  Despite this, the bartenders actually walked around and made sure everyone in my party was well taken care of.  Everyone's drink was filled and ordered and they make sure to even talk to you a bit while doing their rounds.  I loved it!\n\nI love the atmosphere and the people at this spot.  The only negative side is that they ran out of my favorite starter drink and their drinks were a bit heavy on the juice rather than the alcohol.  The prices are also reasonable.

One of those small lounge places where you can come and have drinks with your friends. Theres a DJ that usually comes on the weekend who start playing around 10 pm. When you come inside, the lighting  at the lounge area has the low dim lights. but when you go towards the DJ and bar area, it's has more brighter and colorful lights. On other days, if you want music in the background, you'll have to pick songs that you want to hear from the jukebox which you have to pay for. I was surprise that this place was a quiet lounge especially on a saturday. My group made up half the space here since we were a big group. There were people here too who came here to drink but not as much. But the workers were friendly and the owner gave a free shot on the house since  she knew that i just graduated on the day we came. my friends and i order variety drinks here and everyone paid separately whenever we order a drink from the bar area so we don't gave to pay together. If you want to buy food to snack on while drinking, better buy your food somewhere else since they don't sell food. Other than that, parking around this place are decent if you come after 7 or 8 since most of business are closed and there's free parking meter.

First thing I walk in and see florescent blue light bulbs glowing the place which was pretty awesome. They have a super long couch with tables and sweating. They've got the little stools for the other side. \nWe got there fairly early so it was pretty empty. The waitress set us up at the end near the stage area. Partially bad because it lead to the hallway where the restrooms where.....\nGot a few rounds of drinks going. Beers on tap, pretty good selection. Too bad they don't give shots of 151 anymore though. Got a few End of the Worlds for my friend and boyfriend. Got a few mixed drinks for myself. They pour a little light handed though. The drinks seemed a little watered down, mainly the Goose shot that I had....really didn't feel much or taste it for that fact. \n\nThey don't take card if it's under $20 so we kept having to buy more alchie. Drinks are decently priced. \n \nPluses about this place: They have the dice game, which occupied most of our night, but as soon as the DJ came in and the place started to fill out, we couldn't even shout over it to know what game we were playing anymore. \n\nNegatives- seems like there are a lot of lonely single guys who go there by themselves to creep on girls. Spotted a few of them and they tried to dance up on girls without them knowing. \n\nParking was easy, street parking. But then again we got there early so we parked across the street. It's easy to spot the place while you're driving. \n\nPlace is a tad small with the amount of people who were there by the time I left which was around midnight. \n\nI think you should try it, but be open minded.

THIS IS NOT DOWNTOWN GUY! THIS IS THE OUTER MISSION. You are a stone's throw away from sketchy panaderias and a Safeway that gets invaded by pigeons (please refer to my update of this Safeway). \n\nMy girl and I were meeting up with a group to celebrate a friend's graduation, but when we get there the bouncer tells me he can't let me in because of my baggy pants. I offer to pull my pants all the way up but he wasn't havin it. WTF! When did this dive bar turn into a \"club\"??? I remember this place being on the same level as The Dr's and Carlo's with patrons lookin like bikers in raggedy Bret Michaels clothes. \n\nWe call our friend Marie outside and tell her what's going on. She is equally baffled (again, we are in the EXCELSIOR) and so she calls everyone outside. We're all going on about how stupid this is and then all of a sudden the cops roll up. I guess they were called to get us to leave their doorstep but as it turns out, Marie (whose graduation we were celebrating) knew one of the cops! So instead of kicking us out, he is talking to us and he even takes a picture with Marie. He then just says that it's ultimately up to the bouncer, who BY THE WAY isn't even dressed to abide by his dress code. He was in a big blue t-shirt with baggy black pants and a Giants cap. Yeah, way to enforce your dress code. Oh and Marie got her name shouted out inside the \"club\" but she didn't get to hear it herself because she was outside tryin to help me get in. \n\nAnyways I offer to go home to change because I do want to be there for my friend's party and I live nearby anyway. Get this though, the bouncer goes, \"I heard you guys talking shit out there, I'm not going to let you in.\" ALL BUTTHURT! Acting all sensitive with his feelings hurt!!! LMAO!!! \n\nWhy 2 stars for this review and not 1? Well the bouncer didn't completely ruin my night because after all we did have a good laugh about this for at least an hour after the ordeal. No one get hemmed up and to be fair, we did witness the bouncer turn down a group of Asians because they were wearing flip flops. And....

I also hate the $20.00 minimum on the card, I honestly feel like it's a damn rip off considering most bars have a standard $5.00-$10.00 minimum. I also didn't like how this one bartender in particular told me I couldn't keep the tab open and had to close it out by ten. I was kind of confused and thought to myself \"don't bars stay open til 3?\" Then it dawned on me, she wanted me to close out at 10 so she could get the tip because that was when she was clocking out. WOW, so not only did I give her a big tip but as a burden to me I would have to reopen the tab and still do $20.00 minimum. Wow, I felt hustled like, I was a 50 year old rich man named berk and just fell into the clutches of yet another golddigger. Thankfully this bar is both BOA AND Wells Fargo adjacent.\n\nEven on really slow empty days it's a long wait to get one shot. \"Ok, so I don't want it chilled anymore could you just put the pour spout on and put it in the damn shot glass, no sprite back either now I just want it\" \"WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF THOSE 5 PEOPLE FIRST, I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 15 FUCKING MINUTES. I'M SICK OF LOOKING AT THE LOSING GIANTS SCORE GOD DAMNIT and I WANT A FUCKING CIGARETTE\" \n\nI'm only kidding, the service is really friendly so it's hard to be upset, and I'm being unfair since I know how it can be to be understaffed and overwhelmed. plus my friend works here, did not know that, she is incredibly sweet. I wish I had braces like her. Knowing that she is an asian bartender with braces is probably gonna send like 10 of you horny males in this general direction isn't it?\n\nOh yeah they kick you out at 1:30 and they do this by shutting off the music and turning on the bright lights so the hot guy you're talking to see's how thick your makeup really is under the bright unflattering lights and then see's the pimple you desperately tried to cover. NOT MY STORY because 1.) the guys here are still under the impression Neil Strauss ways work and that they forget that it's a small bar so I sit in the corner and observe and see that they have hit on every girl in the bar before realizing they missed one, me, yeah, see ya, 2.) my makeup is not thick! lOL \n\nanyway I only come here because it's so close to my house, I can get a (expensive asssssss) drink after studying 8 hours of Anatomy and my friends are always here...for some reason............ but if I had the choice it'd still fall under\n\nBetter to Have Never Loved", "author": "Olivia Vanessa R."}

Who would've thought.\n\nThe $10 happy hour special (from ? to 8pm) is a good deal. It includes 2 drinks (beer or well) and an appetizer. The only catch is that both drinks have to be exactly the same, so choose wisely.\n\nAppetizers, ranging from $5 to $9, can also be ordered off the menu. The six of us had calamari, hot wings, angel wings, popcorn chicken, garlic fries, and fried zucchini (yeah, we're pigs). Nothing particularly memorable, just standard, good deep fried bar fare.\n\nThis cute little establishment has modern decor with fresh paint, 4 flat screens, and clean bathrooms.

We accepted her offer, and as she goes to poor us the shots, she replies \"by the way, you took too long, they are now $7\"  I understand its only $2, but c'mon now, really?? Why even offer?? I then declined the shots strictly out of principle of her trying to hustle us for 4 extra bucks.  And then,to pour salt on the wound, she refuses to close us out b/c our tab was $19 (literally) and they have a $20 CC minimum.  Are you kidding me?? How cheap can you be??? Both incidents she blamed the computer system not allowing her to make an exception.

I didnt even pick the place, it was just where my girlfriend, some of her friends, my sister, and me met up for some drinks one Friday night. Seemed like your typical asian run bar, where you pay for atmosphere and views of the bartender more so than the quality, or knowledge thereof, of the beverage itself. So when I was talking to the newbie bartender in training, I kinda figured she didn't know much about beers when she recommended an IPA for a pilsner or lager.  That's ok, she's new to the biz, she's still learning, I've met experienced beer and shot bartenders who thought simple syrup and triple sec were the same thing.  The thing however that got to me was the older lady who seemed like the manager/owner responded with the exact same response when she tried walking me through for recommendations for a second round of beers! I'm not a snob by all means, but as a customer and beer enthusiast I'm insulted that wrong information about alcohol is being thrown around so carelessly.  Another thing was my sister and me felt like we were splitting a shot when we ordered 2 Makers neat. Nothing wrong with measuring shots, but get better glassware that can hide the fact you're being cost conscious. One thing I will appreciate was their willingness to try to be helpful. They don't have a list since they do have a good selection on draft to make both of our jobs easier when it was busy, but at least tried to walk me through it even though no one really actually knew what they were talking about.  They also were willing to redo my sisters guiness when they gave way too much foam at the top (like 2 inches btw) no attitude or questions asked.

I live 10 blocks away so it's nice having a bar I like close to home but last night was the last straw. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I use to love this place. They have drink specials on weeknights before 10pm. $10 gets you 2 drinks and an appetizer. The food is decent and the drink prices aren't that pricy. \n\nWhen we sat down we got served right away, we ordered 4 Patron shots for $34 which isn't a bad price, but asking for it chilled wasn't that great of an idea I guess because they were a bit watered down. I use to serve liquor so I still know how to tip. We gave her $8. Our first waitress was decent, she was nice, checked on us often esp when we needed drinks, she was there. \n\nWe started to playing a drinking game where it required a lot of beer, I wanted Blue Moon but they ran out at 1030pm! So we ordered 4 Heinekens instead and the price we were told the first time was $14 by the same waitress. After 2 rounds of that, we got a new waitress and she started serving us 4 more rounds of 4 Heinekens and she started charging us $18 for each round. May I remind you I still tipped these girls $5 or more every round not knowing the 2nd waitress was charging me more because after 2 rounds of Patron and 2 rounds of Heineken and drinking before I got there, I was a bit faded. During our last round we ran out of cash and we needed to pay with a card and I went to the bar and handed them a card and the first waitress tells me theres a card minimum (and by the way, they don't take American Express!), so I tell her to add another beer to the tab to make it over $20 (thinking it was $18) and she tells me I have to add 2 beers because it's only $14 and I turn to the other girl and say, \"Well she's been charging me $18!\" What upset me the most was the 2nd waitress tried to charge us twice. My friend found cash in his pocket and paid her while I went to the bathroom and then tried to pay her with my card... Are you serious?! After that I stopped tipping. I hate being taking advantage of esp when I did nothing but tip these girls over 20%. \n\nOne of them actually came over started to clean the table and hinted me she wanted a tip, saying oh she's been working alone all night even thou there's other girls here, it's like working alone. Well train your girls better and maybe you would've continue getting tips from me. \n\nI honestly don't know if I'm ever going to go back. I guess I'll just have to make sure what the prices are next time, but I would like to go to a resturant or bar and pay what the price is on the menu without having to check the price every 5 minutes. It is that hard to just be honest. Maybe these girls got bad tippers all night and need more $, but either way, they should've gave me a chance instead of charging me more... They just lost 5 people who did want to go back and tipped great.", "author": "Lynna N."}

If you frequent this bar alot and get to know her, she'll not only remember your name but also what you like to drink alot.  It's really impressive when you don't stop by the bar in months and she still remembers what you usually order.  Parking may be a bit tricky but it's not too bad.  She always has great bartenders working for her and they are all attentive to all your drinking needs.  They'll have a DJ spin music on the weekends.", "author": "Allan T."}

Pia V.'s my cousin and I have to agree with her review -The fact that there's no cover and dress code is awesome.  They have plenty of bartenders on hand to serve people drinks and they're so nice! It is quite tiny and if you're lucky enough (early enough) to get there as a party is leaving their table, you can have a seat.  The DJ plays decent music, but I'm not really there to dance (it also doesn't help that the dance floor is probably 5 by 6 feet... hahahaha. yippee? hahaha but the place is clean. I believe prices for drinks here aren't outrageous, but not cheap (range 6-9 dollars? I can't remember.  The ladies restroom has 2 stalls only, but there's rarely a line since only so many people fit in the bar/lounge anyway. They have nice outdoor seating for a few people.  Parking can be tough so be prepared to search and/or walk far (good thing there's no cover ladies, so you don't have to wear your heels! hahahaha)\n\nI will definitely be back if ever my cousins wanna part-ay.

Where do I begin?  Number 1, this place is packed and you can not get from one end to the other.  Plus there is no air conditioning in this place. 2nd, this place just cater's to only a specific ethnic group on various night.  3rd, the thing that got me so worked up about this effen place is the owner, an asian lady she's this little short chinese lady that has medium length hair that is hella permed\nand has a raspy voice that sounds kinda like a bitch and she always wear skanky clothes like she dress as if she's 20 when that bitch is actually in her effen late 40's, well that whore bag sent my friend and I away bc we didnt order a 2nd round of drinks.  Remind you, this is a Tuesday night.  As quoted from that skank \"okay then if you guys arent going to drink then you should go somewhere else to talk because we're here for business and this area is for people that is going to drink and is for business\" you guys cant stay here and talk because you guys arent going to drink. go somewhere else to talk like a coffee shop.\"  First of all, there were only 3 other customers in there, 2nd of all, skank should be glad that we even order 1 1/2 round of drinks.  If I were you, I would not set foot into this damn spot ever again.  Skanky lady is rude, really rowdy neighborhood, and overall, this place does NOT deserve to be open.  Skank owner is NOT a friendly rodent.  She will shoo you away in a heart beat if you only order 1 round of drinks. WARNING: do not waste your $ and time going to this hell hole.  Spend your $ on beer from the liquor store, or better yet, drive far, far, away from this place.", "author": "Mimi S."}

Okay..first of all the bar service was just plain slow and they choose to ignore you. This place was not even that busy, probably less than 30 people and they didn't provide service. One of the bartenders there was texting while pouring drinks. \n\nON TOP OF THAT, they refuse to take cards. They have to charge a minimum of 20 dollars on cards, which I'm fine with but they refused to leave my card open. They wanted me to make a purchase now. Either way, they would've gotten their money, either electronically or by paper, but they are so stingy. I had to argue with the bartender based on legal grounds with the contracts that they are obliged to follow when they have a credit card machine. Anyway.....DO NOT GO HERE. \n\nSeriously, you'll have a much more fun at other bars nearby who treat their customers well. Seriously, in these tough economic times, the least thing you want to do is piss off twenty people, all who are willing to get wasted, but also have cards ready on hand. I was trying to explain that to this bartender who again had the authority to take our money (because she is the owner as well as I found out), but she refused. She preferred cash, which is fine, it's just that our party of twenty five people or so all had cards, and all wanted to leave everything on tab open. Not very smart for a slow night either. So, I don't know what's going on inside that owner's head, but I give that place another three months if they continue to do business like that. \n\nSeriously, avoid this place at all cost.", "author": "Alicia A."}

It's a small place and it can definitely be packed like sardines on some nights but it's a decent place to drink especially if you're one of those people who love specialty cocktails--Shirley is always mixing up something new and for the traditionalists, it's not a bad place to order your vodka tonics either.", "author": "kristin e."}

The owner is a sweetheart and will always remember a face if you show up more than once.  It's a great place for happy hour on the weekdays.  The food there is excellent.  All the recipes are original and created by the owner herself!  I love this place because it's been open for over a year now but everything is still kept new and CLEAN.\n\nAnd referring to the ignorant review by Kimmie Q, the crowd was predominantly Filipino that night because there were 7 birthdays being celebrated, half of which happened to be Filipinos.  That's also why it was so packed or as we like to say, crackin.  The bar is not as huge as a club should be because it's a BAR.  There was only one bouncer because it's a BAR but as you could see, it's popular on weekends and that's why they had to hire one.  You don't usually see too many bouncers at bars that are dead.  And it isn't a place to go bar hopping because it's one of the only NICE local bars around in that area.  Obviously it is a different environment from San Jose downtown where plenty of clubs and bars are crowded into a small area.  And there was no fight that broke out and I was there until the very end.  Sorry you were disappointed and couldn't get the real feel of this place but please don't lie in your reviews!

Parking can get crazy around here depending on what night you go, but no worries! The bouncer or bartenders can hook you up with a parking permit for the B of A just down the street. Of course the lot there isn't ginormous, so it would be wise to get one while spaces are still available. The price for drinks here is reasonable. My girl and I each had 2 Jaeger bombs, totaling $28. Most bars I go to don't really give customer service outside of the actual bar itself. But being that it wasn't too hectic of a night, the bartenders and the owner herself checked up on us and cleaned up after us consistently. Plus side for the fellas, the bartenders here are all female. The DJ was enjoying himself during his set and played some pretty bumpin' music. Not only that, he was eating a bowl of noodles at the same time. Who does that?!  I wouldn't say this would be the place to go all out on the floor since 1) it's a bar and 2) being that it is one, don't expect the supposed \"dance area\" to be huge, if even there at all.
