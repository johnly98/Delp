It doesn't really sound like the best thing to have or think of, but lemme tell you about this Sandwich Place. Oh my lawd, I walked in to I guess \"Juan\" the owner? Manager? Whatever the main guy, talking to his employees in Spanish about how they can do it, they got plenty of orders but they're gonna make them all and really trying with the team effort.\n\nI walked in with 3 of my friends, one whose been there since she was like 10  and the rest were new like myself. Juan greets us telling us he'd make the best sandwich in the world and of course I was like nah, that's not true. So I ordered my Steak Milanesa sammich, and of course I didn't know what to expect cause you know it's just a sammich. \n\nI waited inside for like, 15 minutes or so for the sammich but I don't blame them for the wait. They had a lot of orders you know? So like that's okay with me cause they got a poppin business. Some customers are rude though, they are so impatient and I can see why the employees might get upset. If you go here please have a lil  patience cause it can be busy. Anyways they get my sammich done and I go outside and eat it. Lemme tell you this, I took one bite, and I felt my soul leave my body. Deadass, I fell in some kind of trance and I fell in love with this sammich. It was just soo poppin, it had lettuce, tomato, chipotle, cheese and all that meat. My lawd, it was just amazing. I plan to come every time I can when school comes again. Juan if you see this, you and your crew are amazing.", "author": "Manuel E."}

Multiple people from off the street stopped in just to say hello during our 10 minute wait for 4 hot sandwiches. Our first time here so they suggested the standing favorites of the joint, that have been popular for almost 40 years! (1st is pastrami & 2nd is chicken milanesa). The sandwich we had in question had a sundried tomato spread. Without even asking me, the owner, Juan, offered me a taste by cutting off the butt of a home made loaf of bread and spreading it generously with the flavored mayo. I was so surprised that he so willingly offered a free sample! The spread was tasty and the bread soft. Brother trusted the recommended pastrami sammie, Son got the BLT. I, on the other hand, reluctantly asked for a sample of the pastrami (since he had just given me a taste of the spread.) \"Do you like mustard?\" \"Yes.\" Mayo?\" \"Yes.\" And Juan happily cut a nice slice off the loaf, finessed it with mustard and mayo, and loaded it with a heaping pile of pastrami. \"Whoa! I just expected a small piece of meat but you gave me everything!\" He said, \"you can't taste it without all the other stuff!\" Then jokingly said to my brother, \"Watch- as soon as I give her this sample, she's gonna run out the door.\" I said, \"No, as soon as I walk out the door I'm gonna give you 5 Stars on Yelp!\"....

Since we came by way of (16th and Mission) BART, we decided to eat around there. We saw this sandwich shop's reviews and thought, \"why not?\" When we arrived at the quaint shop, Juan was sitting in front of this establishment. He immediately greeted us and said \"you guys hungry? Come on in!\" First impression of the inside was how small it was, BUT the selection of sandwiches on the BOARDS were GLORIOUS! Juan started to rattle off what kinds of sandwiches they offer from classics to vegetarian, hot to cold. We were so hungry everything sounded amazing. Then, he walked over to the meats and pulled a handful of steaming hot pastrami from its warm au jus! We were SOLD!! He mentioned that he makes his own bread every day, fresh cut meats and friendly service. Above all else, he made us feel like we've known him for years (we were in the shop for no more than 10 minutes). He genuinely cared about the customers and their needs. He even brought us more chairs so everyone can sit and enjoy their food! \n\nSandwich time: I ordered the hot pastrami sandwich with everything (mayo, pickles, jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, pepperoncini, American cheese) except mustard. Total was less than $10. I was very impressed when I took my first bite. Everything was warm, crunchy, melty, and DELICIOUS! Bite after bite, I was more and more impressed.

You walk in, order your sandwich, receive it quickly, then proceed to enjoying it. The place may be a little small on the inside but honestly what more do you need from a sandwich shop. The selection is plentiful and well organized, very easy to find the right sandwich as soon as possible. The service is speedy and all the employees are very affable, they can help pass the short amount of time waiting with some light banter. Absolutely no time is wasted in this place, besides enjoying the sandwich. I had the honey chicken sandwich and it was truly a top tier bite. The honey added a delicate tang to the savory taste packing a punch to the sandwich as a whole. It was grilled to perfection as well, the bread had the slightest crisp on the exterior while still being soft and warm on the inside. But what really stood out to me was how well the sandwich held itself together. It was snugly packed and stayed together until the last bite. If it's one thing I don't like it's a loose sandwich and this was the tightest sandwich I've ever sunk my teeth into. This makes the podium when it comes to sandwich shops.", "author": "Qasim S."}

My favorite thing was the homemade gluten-free bread. They don't offer different choices for bread, I think because they use the same type for every sandwich. It is a little sweet, and a little savory, but it is light, delicious and toasted lightly so that it doesn't cut up your mouth.\n\nThe pastrami itself was pretty okay. It could have used a little more taste, but I ordered it with everything, and jalapenos so it helped to add a little pizzazz.

Wander a bit looking for somewhere promising, check Yelp a bit, not feeling it, start heading back up to 16... and then the planets aligned. I've been tourist-trolling this area for a decade and 16/Mission BART is always my first stop when I arrive on a plane. How in the hell have I managed to miss The Sandwich Place? Answer: truly a hole-in-the-wall. They've been around almost as long as I've been alive and have got this Sandwich Thing down to an art. For me, go big or go home unrepentant gluten-omnivore style: Giant Kitchen Sink with everything. They bake their own bread and the roll was amazing: that perfect light crispiness outside and just the right amount of soft, glutenous chewiness inside. The pile of meat and cheese was an inch and a half thick and the overall sandwich looked like it could fit at least four Subways. Very \"me.\" Taste was as it should be: fresh. The kicker? I couldn't have made this sandwich at home for less money. \n\nMy only regret is not having had a hangover, because eating this beast in this place in that condition would have been the only way to make it better. Maybe I need to come back for lunch.\n\nFinally, Juan is an absolute trip. I was in just after open and we sat outside, me munching while he told me stories in between greeting by name gaggles of the morning passersby.

It was so good, that I wanted another one, as soon as the last but of crust was gone--even though I was completely full. \n\nThe very gregarious owner called Juan, gave me a brief history of the shop and how he came to perfect his own loaves of gluten free bread. When he handed me my hot and savory sandwich, he said that I had to eat it right away, as most GF breads go limp quickly. I had a good 5 blocks to walk, and several flights of stairs to climb before I could devour my goods, and despite the fact that the bread was almost too-soft, the buttery flavor, and crisp edges made it not matter one lick.

The milanesa was amazing and breaded perfectly, and topped with fresh ingredients. And the turkey was roasted in cranberries! I never wanted the sandwich to end, which actually took some time, despite the fact that it was the \"small\" roll. \n\nIn addition to the amazing food and service, the abuelita continued to check up on us constantly, and even chatted it up with us as well.

I really liked the fact that they didn't just use lettuce, but various greens because it made it tastier.  It also included jalapenos and onions.  I think I still have heartburn from the jalapenos.\n\nAgain, the \"guy with the glasses\" was there and just as friendly as from before.  I forgot to mention the grandma from last time, but she was also there handling the cash register.  The grandma was really nice also.  I had trouble holding my wallet, sandwich and soda before I left, but she told me to take a second to put my wallet in my pocket before I left.

I've seen what happens to small businesses in this neighborhood, and I don't think people appreciate how good they had it until a place closes. \n They have a guy bake their bread fresh daily and use organic vegetables in their sandwiches.  It's true not every sandwich they make turns out exactly the same depending on who makes it, but that's for factory assembly lines and fast food.  \nIt's the kind of place where if you go there every so often, they remember you, and what kind of sandwich you like.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-17", "description": "This place always had that \"I'll eat it if you eat it, first\" idea attached to it for me. Total hole in the wall, nondescript awning, seedy surroundings - qualities that, especially in the Mission, (as I should really know by now, having grown up in the area) generally point to tasty food.\n\nSo, someone wanted a sandwich and was due for a break. We keep menus in a file so that we can order ahead of time, sparing our wee 30 minute window from waiting with hunger pains. The Sandwich Place menu found itself on the counter and we were all pretty shocked to see the broad span of options. You've got your standard salami and american cheese mixed in with the homemade veggie burgers that are commonplace on Valencia, but less frequent one block east. \n\nWe ordered five sandwiches and because it was One of Those Days, I volunteered myself to Get the Hell Out of There for a few to enjoy the fresh (debatable) air and steal a few bites from each one to allow the Yelp readers a fair and balanced review (not because I was hungry, or dishonest, or taking more than my fair share, or just honestly curious, or impatient, or indecisive). \n\nThe \"inside\" of this place hailing sandwiches (that apparently has decent soup, too!) is consistent with the outside - no frills, just some counter space, and a clear view of ingredients being piled on top of one another, heated, sliced, etc. When hangry (hungry+angry), I can become a bit demanding and the plexiglass (I hope the guy that installed all of the bullet-proof glass has a monopoly on Mission St. because he either is already, or ought to be making a killing) can present problems with my temper as I squeal out to the poor guy making a sandwich that could be mine (but 9 times out of 10 isn't) that \"I DON'T WANT MAYO!!!! JUST MUSTARD!!!! EXTRA ONIONS!!!\" Generally, I retract back to my corner upon hearing that this sandwich is for someone ELSE (who is not as controlling and obnoxious, I'm sure) and that, YES, my order is being prepared as specified in the phone order and will be ready shortly. \n\nThe guy that works the counter (owner? manager? just all-around nice guy?) is amusing and always has something to say, and never ceases to make me chuckle my plummeting-insulin laugh.  \n\nThe sandwiches are huge and inexpensive, always tasty, and remind me of my school days spent living off of Cala sandwich meal-deals. Part of their beauty is that they aren't the sandwiches Frjtz is serving (which is not a negative for either business, I love me some Frjtz, too!) , but certainly leaps and bounds above what one might find in the refrigerated section of Walgreens. \n\nSandwiches are such a no-brainer when one thinks of quick \"American\" food, but fewer places than I would have anticipated actually deliver a simple, enormous, cheap tower of stuff between slices. Extra points go to the diverse menu that can feed our entire store, each person with a favorite, but eager to try everything else on the menu.", "author": "haley d."}

Juan G. was behind the counter when I first walked in on Monday (the day before actually placing an order) so that I could double check their hours, confirm the prices on their sandwiches and also make sure they accepted credit cards before I placed a slightly large order for a work meeting.  Juan was super nice, answered all my q's and told me it's cash only but that they do take company checks.  I wasn't sure if it would be a problem or not, but I conveyed to Juan that we couldn't issue a check until the following week, would this be alright?  He didn't even blink an eye.  He was like \"Don't worry honey, we'll take care of you.  That's ok.\"  So our meeting was on Tuesday, I went in the following morning to place the order, and a sweet older women, who I think was the owner, was in and spoke to me in such a sugary way, that I genuinely felt like she was someone's cool grandma that you just wanted to hang out with.  When Juan walked in he threw in some adjectives to make any girl blush, and once I again the smile on my face was ear to ear.\n\nSo if you can't tell, saying that service rocks here, is an understatement.\n\nAs for the food, I had the Vivi's Veggie burger and inhaled two regular sized rolls in not a whole lot of time.  The rest of the people at our meeting seemed to be equally satisfied w/the B.L.T, Supreme and Club sandwiches b/c usually at the end of the night, we have leftovers.
