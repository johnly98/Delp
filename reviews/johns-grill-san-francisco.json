That makes it worth the trip, but do remember that this place is OLD.  The small tables wobble and the chairs are ricketty. \n\nAnother old thing here is the menu.  The food is heavy, a caloric throwback to the mid-20th century. Meat, potatoes, pasta, cream sauce, cheese. It's all delicious, and some of it (not all) is surprisingly inexpensive compared to other SF tourist destinations.  Red Snapper in lemon butter (more butter than lemon) sauce was just $17 and came with a generous side of fresh green beans (and two ornamental carrots). The Seafood Cannelloni, at $14.95, was one of the most delicious things I've eaten all week, and it was huge (two cannellonis stuffed with shrimp, crab, mushrooms, and cheese). \n\nTIP:  If you are a party of two, you will want to sweet talk the host into putting you at a 4 top because the narrow two tops are not large enough to fit the restaurant's giant plates of food, basket of bread, and drinks, especially if you order an appetizer or a bottle of wine.", "author": "David A."}

They told me to come back in about 30 minutes, so I wandered around SF for a bit. I came back and they directed me to the bar area to wait for a table. This was a poor idea, as it was still packed and I was in the way of the servers. I decided to wait outside. \nThe host asked me to go upstairs and someone would seat me and walked away - I'd never been there before and I couldn't see the stairs. I was becoming anxious because I was in the way of a lot of people and had nowhere to go. I then went back to the host stand and told him I had never been there and wasn't sure where the stairs were (there is a small label pointing to the stairs in the back area of the first floor). \nI then went upstairs and was immediately seated. There was a gentleman playing music loudly, but it still sounded nice. What I was hoping would be a quiet, nice dinner was actually a raucous-filled party floor. I almost left then, but I knew that everywhere would be crazy since it was DreamForce week in SF. \nWhat really caught me off guard was the impeccable service. I couldn't say I had one server, because people were constantly taking care of my table. Bringing drinks, taking my order, serving food. It was wonderful. \nI had the jumbo prawns dijonnaise and it was fantastic! I hadn't had a baked potato in so long. \nI loved the mushrooms in the dish and the veggies were cooked perfectly. Oh, and my food literally came out 10 minutes after I ordered, which was extremely surprising. \nI didn't try dessert, but I did have a martini and it was divine.", "author": "Kristen B."}

This downtown restaurant became a literary pilgrimage stop when Dashiel Hammett's 1930 novel, The Maltese Falcon, published. His main character and lead gumshoe is Sam Spade, who scours the city in search of a mysterious jewel-encrusted statuette known as the Maltese Falcon, and dines on a meal of chops, a potato, and sliced tomatoes at John's Grill.\n\nI came for a business dinner, and was concerned with the Yelp 3.5 star rating. I ordered the ribeye steak medium with fries instead of baked potato. The ribeye was served medium rare instead of medium; however, it was nicely prepared, tender and absolutely delicious. It is as if the chef refused to ruin the steak by preparing it medium and served it the way it should had been ordered. The fries were also prepared the way I like them, crispy and not too thick.\n\nI'll not comment about the service, as the restaurant was extremely busy when I visited and it was a total chaos. Conveniently located close to the Powell Street BART station. Recommended based on the food.", "author": "Tom S."}

But I figure its a 110 year old restaurant, it wasn't always touristy was it? And John is my nickname, so there you go. This classic American restaurant feels like an episode of Madmen, with Donald Draper and Roger Sterling having a power lunch.  Traditional American, but not too pretentious. Our friendly waiter kept on top of things, all with a smile and just the right amount of visits. \n\nComplimentary sourdough bread and butter...yes please!\n$14 Half dozen oysters...served the old fashioned way with lemon wedges, cocktail sauce, and horseradish.  \n\n$35 Filet Mignon...wifey's pick, and the wife was happy. I think it was an 8 ounce piece of meat heaven.  She barely finished it.  \n\n$35  Ribeye...my favorite cut of steak, and it was think, fatty, and fabulous. I guestimate it was around 14-16 ounce, I was full AF!  I also got a $10 glass of house red, which was a generous pour of delicious velvet liquid perfectly complementing my red meat.  \n\nFREE Birthday Flan...thank you! Light and creamy, accompanied with a healthy side of fresh berries and cream. \n\nUltimately, I wanted a nice thick juicy slab of beef inside of me on my 40th, but without completely emptying out my 401K and selling my body on the Tenderloin.

But it makes up for it with charm -- the place oozes it. This is a classic San Francisco grill -- think Tadich or Sam's. We are not talking fancy food; we are talking good comfort food, a great bar and friendly service. \n\nI am a creature of habit -- I always get the lamb chops. The same dish that Dashiell Hammet had, and the same dish his alter ego Sam Spade had in the Maltese Falcon. John's was a favorite haunt of Hammet's back in the 20's when he lived in the area as a Pinkerton detective and later as a writer. Upstairs you can see a little homage to the book and movie, along with a replica of the falcon. Sometimes touristy is great. Do yourself a favor and pay John's Grill a visit.", "author": "John C."}

We also indulged in a little afternoon cocktail--a negroni and a sidecar, both of which were perfect!  The shrimp cocktail was exactly as it should be, with huge shrimp!  The escargot were cooked to perfection and practically melted on one's tongue.  Both steak options were cooked exactly as ordered (being rare/mid-rare enthusiasts, it's always a gamble to order steak out) and they were so tender, one barely needed a knife to slice through them!  As a lovely after-dinner treat, our waiter brought us little Kahlua-milks which was indeed very sweet and much appreciated!\n\nMy only complaints are very minor:  it was a particularly warm day and so it was *very* warm in the restaurant.  I understand that that was a particularly rare occurrence in the area for this time of year, but still, a fan or cracked window would've gone a long way!

I would definitely recommend making a reservation or getting here before the rush begins.\n\nI got the shrimp cocktail, salad, lamb, and flan. Everything was bigger than I thought it would be. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach that night. The shrimps on the shrimp cocktail were definitely huge. I really enjoyed the cocktail sauce that came with it. It was tangy and spicy, extra horseradish wasn't needed for me. The salad was packed with crab pieces and shrimp. They definitely used real crab! It came on a huge plate. It could stand alone for dinner on its own. The lamb was great! It was cooked perfectly. I love the taste of char on my game meats and this definitely served that up right. It came with this most perfectly baked potato! Everyone at the table was raving about the potato for sure. Portions were so large, I would definitely have needed to take it home. The flan was creamy and not too sweet. It topped off the meal perfectly! \n\nI'll definitely come back here again if I'm craving a retro-vibe, straight-shot American dinner.", "author": "Tina Y."}

They will let you in but you will be out of place. Business casual is perfect.\nEverything on the menu is wonderful. Their steaks are cooked to perfection and they have a large choosing.\nTheir fish is out of this world. Most of it fresh, they will tell you, and all of it great. I love any and all of their White Fishes. Their John Dory is great. \nThey have a full bar and serve a mean martini. They also have a good wine list.\nYou may be able to get in without a reservation, but I would make one to be sure. The place is not huge.\nThe service is perfect. They know the menu, they are attentive and will even tell you what place to try next.\nThe walls are awash with photos of authors and celebrties and Presidents who have dined here. It is told that Dashiell Hammett wrote at least part of the Maltese Falcon here. Whether that is true, I am not sure.

It is known as the setting for author, Dashell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon, where Sam Spade was a diner. This old school restaurant has dark oak paneled walls with white linen table cloths has pictures of well-known patrons and old San Francisco. \nThe main dining room is on the first floor and private dining rooms were on the upper two floors. I was here for a retirement luncheon, which was set up on the third floor.  Our entr\u00e9e selections were limited to Chicken Dijonnaise and Pacific Red Snapper, which I selected.\n\nThe entr\u00e9e included a lightly dressed mixed greens salad with two cherry tomatoes topped with fresh parmesan.  A classic style salad. \n\nThe entr\u00e9e included steamed vegetables - squash, carrots and broccolini.  The Snapper was grilled with a buerre blanc sauce.  The large portion of fish, which consisted of one and a half filets, had a light batter on it was flaky, moist and well-seasoned. \n\nDessert consisted of a scoop of very good vanilla ice cream with fresh berries. \n\nCoffee or tea was part of the menu, but it was never served.  \n\nOverall, the Pacific Red Snapper was very good, salad was ok, and ice cream was good quality.

The Yelp pictures of the clam in cream broth enticed me to pick this place and clam we ordered. We ordered not just the clam, but also the escargot in garlic cream, filet mignon, and ribeye. The escargot is equally as great as the clam, I was floored by the flavor of both. My husband said this is the best clam he's ever had, I agree. Very succulent!!! My ribeye was cooked perfectly, but it was kinda bland so was my husband's ribeye (it was more medium well, far from medium rare like he asked).

Tablecloths, real service, and a great menu await you here...no gimmicks, no fusion, no hipster decor.  Just real food in a real steakhouse that knows what to do with meat.  (You know it's true, they don't all know how to cook a steak-even if they say they're experts at it!)\n\nIt's been a hectic month or so for us, so we were ready for a nice meal and John's really hit the spot.  They'll start you with cocktails and bread and keep giving you fantastic service all the way through.  I had an amazing, REAL caesar salad-which is hard to find these days.  (I know, run of the mill, but I love a good caesar with handmade dressing-which is what John's is.)  I added chicken to it and had so much, I couldn't eat it all...Hubby had the porterhouse, which in my opinion is the Cadillac of steaks-you don't see it on every menu these days!  Cooked to medium perfection, it was wonderful.  I believe he also had a baked potato and creamed spinach with it. (The spinach was just right.  See, old school. :)  )\n\nWe will definitely count John's as one of our regular spots.  Steak is on the menu for us a lot, and when you find a good one, you'd better hold onto it!\n\nThank you everyone at John's!  See you soon!\n\nTIP:\n\n*Head down Powell to where the streetcar does it's turn and look to the left.  You can't miss the giant neon sign.\n\n*Make a reservation with open table online, you'll walk right in and get your table, no hanging around waiting...nice!\n\n*If you're old like me, you'll go dressed pretty decently-but you'll see people wearing pretty much everything off the street.

The food was fair to good overall and the service was a bit slow. Also, the waiter seem to be a bit young and inexperienced and had difficulty describing the menu or answering questions about wine selections. As was commented on by several reviewers, the clam chowder is a very solid contender. The lobster ravioli was good if one is looking for a cheese ravioli but if you are expecting much in the way of actual Lobster you will be very disappointed. My wife had the oyster Wellington which she enjoyed very much. The pecan pie was very good and had a hint of maple which allowed it to stand out relative to many restaurant pecan pies. However, there seem to be a slight taste of freezer burn which of course detracted from the overall quality.

I would say they are more known for seafood here, followed by steak. \n\nPersonally, I was looking for something more off the beaten path so I ordered what was featured on Gourmet Magazine, THE OYSTERS WELLINGTON at $28.95that contained\nCreamed spinach, smoked bacon, baked in puff pastry on a bed of sherry cream. The cream is super creamy and you receive 3 good size fried oysters on your plate. One of the three oysters was a bit bitter for me so my experience was down to two oysters. The side vegetables were excellent and seasoned well. \n\nIf you need to use the restroom, you'll have to take the stairs up and on your way you'll notice the Maltese Falcon. But if you are going to get up and take the narrow way there, be advised the it is difficult when they're busy as the waiter and waitresses also takes the up and down stairs frequently. So basically, don't wait until last minute to use the restroom. \n\nI don't dine in the city too often, maybe this is why.

By \"Jazz Nightly\" they mean a guy on an electric keyboard singing stylized renditions of John Legend, Willie Nelson and Beatles songs. The music was too loud, poorly played, and most certainly not Jazz.\n\nThis place has so much going for it, it should be a San Francisco \"destination restaurant,\" but everything is so poorly executed. It's as if everyone there stopped caring decades ago. The restaurant is crowded and dirty. The carpet was stained and needed a good vacuuming. The Maltese Falcon memorabilia was in dusty glass cases. The images on the website shows white tablecloths, but they line the tables in paper for each setting, so the effect of fine dining is completely lost. They should add crayons so people can color as they wait for the incredibly slow service. The bartender acted generally annoyed with having to deal with people. \n\nThe food was average. The New York Steak was reasonably sized but equivalent to supermarket quality. The calves liver was quite good but was topped with overcooked, stale (and in my opinion unnecessary) bacon. The creamed spinach as extremely thin, but had an interesting, almost Mediterranean seasoning to it. The sourdough bread would have been much better served warm.  We normally would have split a salad, but they were priced $10-12ish per person, so it didn't seem as if splitting was an option. \n\nIf they decide at some point to start caring again, and elevate this place to it's assumably previous greatness, here is where they should start:\n1.  Clean the restaurant top to bottom.\n2. Re-matte and reframe, perhaps even update some of the pictures of celebrities.  \n3.  Reduce the number of  tables by 1/3.\n4. Put a piano upstairs and hire a true jazz pianist, or put in a 3-piece combo\n5. Update the menu, while keeping the standards to include fresh sides and higher quality proteins.\n6. Invest in white table cloths and stop using the paper.\n7. Customer service training for everyone.\n\nMaybe someone will read this.", "author": "Diana D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-12", "description": "John's Grill is a standard.  I thought it was going to be outdated, but it wasn't.  We had a small group of six people, and ordered a fairly wide variety of choices.  We enjoyed cocktails, appetizers, chowder, escargot (more on that in a minute), petrale sole (a favorite among our guests), and good wine choices, even a number of quality selections by the glass.  There was one in particular I've never seen on a restaurant wine list before (Clairborne and Churchill, Pinot Gris), let alone on the \"by the glass\" list.  Impressive.\n\nAs for the escargot... I recoiled when they showed up in a creamy sauce.  You see, I'm a traditionalist.  Our waiter reassured me that they would something new to me, but renowned there at John's, and he warrantied them.  These  tender escargot were out of the shell, and the sauce was a rich, yet subtle, garlic sauce that not only dressed the escargot nicely, but not overly so.  (You do know that all restaurant shells are stuffed from carefully processed snails, not fresh, right?.... except maybe in rural France). Anyway, these were perfect, and the sauce was beautiful with the bread.  Applause!\n\nThe New England Clam Chowder could have used, in my opinion, a more flavorful clam broth and more clams.  It ended up being  too smoothly creamy and lackluster in flavor.  Note: it only comes in the bowl size, therefore could pass as a main course, for some people.  Not a morsel left on any plate by the end, so that's a good sign!  Their French Fries are the optimal thickness so they stay nice and hot by the time they arrive at the table.  I hate cold Fries.\n\nWe couldn't resist dessert.  Cheesecake, Flan, Chocolate Mousse, all just the right sized portions.  Each was enough to share between two who just want a bite.  Together they made for a great dessert buffet for the table.  Coffee and Cappuccino set the whole meal off perfectly.\n\nBut wait, there's more! I need to give props to the wait staff!  They worked like a well-oiled machine.  Courteous, professional, and always available with a mere nod of your head.  Sample a beer, or a wine, before deciding?...No problem!  They had none of that territorial attitude that keeps someone from helping you because you're not in the \"station\".  \nAlways a smile.  And they got us out to the theater on time! Yay!", "author": "James G."}

While it looks small from the street, the dining area actually goes pretty far back, and up a story or two.  In other words, it's massive inside.\n\nAnyway, it's a decidedly mainstream and or throwback experience, with an Italian-centric menu featuring lots of pastas and steaks.  No anything-fusion sauces or exotically herbal cocktails here; your out of town relatives will be completely comfortable!  We had the Tortellone, the ribeye, and a couple drinks.    Of everything we had there was general agreement that the bearnaise sauce on the steak was the biggest winner.

Crazy packed (not sure why) \n\nI get it, it's an iconic place but so what! \n\nThe waiter recommended the Johns bone in NY. Sounds great!!!!! But this steak was not only small but over cooked and cold. The weird green beans were way too crunchy basically raw no flavor and the baked potato was also small wrinkled dry like they pulled it out of a microwave 4 days ago. \n\nAlso only having mashed potatoes during lunch, big mistake. At least if I had mashed potatoes that were good and hot, I could have masked my boring steak instead of the weird tiny baked potato \n\nOne more thing.... the seating by the front window is way too cramped.

At the beginning I was kinda doubting my friends decision cause I'm not a steak kinda guy, I try staying away from any kinda beef or pork products. But I heard they had a good sea food menu so I decided what the heck let's go!! Since the beginning I got greeted by the nice gentleman and lady at the door, for not having reservations we got seated fairly quick (less than 5 mins.) We decided to split the \"Jack LaLanne's Favorite Salad\" as an appetizer, we understand why it was his favorite.. this salad was full of crab meat and baby shrimp it was delicious! As an entree I went with the Sea Food Cioppino And my friend got a Porterhouse Steak. My cioppino was filled with fish, shrimp, scallops,mussels and lots more, one of the best if not THE BEST IVE EVER HAD. My friends steak came with a huge baked potato and some veggies, looked like it was cooked to perfection cause he didn't complain. We ended the night splitting a delicious cheesecake and a bowl of their homemade ice cream. Overall the service, staff, place and the food was amazing.

I was going to head to a second Hog Oyster House meal, but this is so close to the Hilton Hotel I decided to re-visit and have the Seafood Cioppino.  The bar had seats and the cocktail was excellent as well as the bar tender.  I so waited for the Cioppino.  After snapping some pix, I decided on the large scallop to begin.  As I put it into my mouth expecting a great flavor I was totally shocked with a mouthful of Ammonia.  No doubt this is a taste and experience that cannot be denied.  That was the end of that.  Meal over.  No manager or follow up..I finished my drink.  They did not charge me.  History.  Here is the case that I experience:\n\nThe ammonia-like smell is because the fish is not fresh. It is a product of decomposition. Don't eat it if it smells like that. It might not make you sick, but then again it might. Why risk it or have an unpleasant experience? Fish should have only a briny aroma of the sea. If it has a fishy smell from being in plastic, briefly rinse in fresh water. If the fishy smell persists or is strong, take it back and demand a refund. For that reason, it's best to cook fish the same day you buy it.\n\nThis means I will not return.  It clearly is not fresh and there is nothing they can do to fix that fact.  YUK.  And no manager visited to ask or anything..they know, I know, and they know I know.  Best to stay away my friends.", "author": "David G."}

Yup, bring your wallet!!!  The person who holds the door open must have been freezing as the wind was blowing and he was in the shade.  I felt bad for the guy.  Our host was very nice and we were seated promptly.  Our server was also genuine and nice.  So, we go off to a good start.\n\nThe place is small, so if you come at peak time, you will be waiting.  Old school wood paneling with lots of pictures of many famous people who ate there.\n\nWe went ahead and ordered a salad  (no ranch here :) ) along with our meals.  The salad was underwhelming at best.  Very small for the price.  The Filet and Rib-eye were cooked as requested, however there was absolutely no seasoning at all at any level.  Thank goodness for the side of grilled onions and mushrooms.  This was one of the plainest pieces of meat I have ever had, especially at (what I found out later) an expensive steak house.\n\nThe rib eye was very fatty and 1/4 was unedible as it was all fat.  The filet had no taste.  The sides were ok, however, nothing to write home about.\n\nThe only thing that saved this from going into two star land is the desert.  We had the Cheescake/Berrys and homemade ice-cream.   Both of those deserts popped with flavor and we thoroughly enjoyed them!

My husband and I visited John's Grill in honor of our dating anniversary, as we have for the past dozen years.  We love the atmosphere, the Maltese Falcon connection and the decadent food offerings.  Those are the reasons for the stars.  What we did not enjoy this year was the service.  The waiter was warm and friendly, so we suspect this is a management problem.  Here's what happened....  We ordered an appetizer, to be followed by soup and then entrees, but both the appetizer and soup came out all at once.  Not ideal.  Then before we were finished with the soup, the waiter appears with the entr\u00e9e plates and looks hopefully to us to put down our soup spoons, move the bowls and make room for the entrees.  Awkward.  We noticed the waiter was doing that to people around us, too.  It wasn't like they needed to move diners along to make room for others - there were a few empty tables.  There was no reason for rushing diners along.  The waiter never does bring our side of French fries, but does try to charge for them.  When clearing the table, he stacked plates before removing them (a training issue).  Having had the clam chowder (delicious), we could not finish the entrees and asked them to be packed up to go.  When we got home, we found he'd decided not to pack any of the vegetables.  Annoying.  We hope to come back next year and have a better service experience.

To top it off the cheesecake was divine and although we were so full, we finished it all, nearly licking the plate! Service was so prompt and attentive without hovering.  We sat on the 2nd floor and enjoyed ever minute. I highly recommend!! A must see historic San Francisco Union Square Gem! Don't forget to ask about the Maltese Falcon!", "author": "Natalie W."}

We were shown to a table tucked in a corner of the second floor next to the hostess stand which proved to be loud and distracting at times during our meal. The stairs looked to continue up at least another floor so there must be lots of room in this old building.\n\nHaving a member in our party named John, several of us just defaulted to ordering dishes with his namesake in the title. I ended up starting with a Caesar salad ala John and dining on John's bone in strip steak for my main paired with a couple of bottles of John's Cabernet. I thought the service was spotty and found myself on several occasions with an empty water glass looking for a refill. \n\nMy salad was huge and I ended up splitting it with a colleague. It was quite fresh and I loved what I think were homemade croutons. They did come around with fresh ground pepper to top it off as well.\n\nMy strip steak arrived in a reasonable timeframe after the salad and cooked to my preferred medium rare temperature. My initial reaction was that the plate it was served on was cold and with its light weight may have been made of plastic?! Not my expectations for a $37 steak. The meat itself was flavorful though and I enjoyed it. I skipped the baked potato and doubled down on the veggies. The mix of green beans and leafy broccoli was also enjoyable and quickly disappeared. Our wine turned out to be quite pleasant and paired well with the steak. At $39, I thought it was a good deal.\n\nFor dessert, we split a couple of cheesecakes and a flan. The little round cheesecake with fresh berries turned out to be the highlight of the meal for me and really delicious. I didn't sample the flan but others mentioned it was very light and melted in your mouth. I think that's good.", "author": "Michael K."}

There is seating on multiple levels/floors -- the first floor is more lit and is perfect for friends and families while the second floor is a little dim, perfect for dates, couples, and lovers.  Maybe you'll spot Sam and Bridgid here on a date here?  Even on weekdays, It can get pretty crowded at dinner time, so eating earlier in the evening or making a reservation would be recommended!  \n\nMy friend and I both had the Jack LaLanne salad, ribeye meal, cioppino dish, and lastly the homemade vanilla ice cream for dessert. All the food is kind of expensive, probably marked up for tourists due to its novelty and relation to the \"Maltese Falcon.\" Of the dishes we had, I enjoyed the Jack LaLanne salad as it was packed with seafood, full of flavor, and the textures and different tastes (veggies, dressing, and seafood) all complimented each other.  Because my friend and I aren't a big fan of blue cheese, we substituted the dressing with Italian vinaigrette (tossed lightly), which was tasty.  The Ribeye and the cioppino were unremarkable and pretty average as they tasted similar to other places.  The vanilla ice cream was pretty good, but a little steep for $7.95 as it tasted a lot like Dreyer's ice cream.  Hope it was really home made...\n\nI'm glad I got to come to John's Grill and experience part of history (with the \"Maltese Falcon\").

We were surrounded by Chinese and Indian food, but we had already met our fill of each so were looking for something a little different, but didn't know what.   We took to Yelp to figure out a place to eat and came across the reviews for John's Grill.   \n\nWhile we weren't keen on the price, the history and proximity caused us to decide to give John's Grill a try.  \n\nI love the signage for the building and the ambiance once inside makes you really think about the history and people who have dined in this space before you.  Oh, and about that space, it is a little cramped, but no more so than many restaurants we have dined at recently.   I liked that the tables were not set up bistro style so I didn't feel like I was sitting at my neighbors table, but I wasn't going to back up in my chair for fear of hitting the person sitting behind me.   The chairs were anything but comfortable and by the time we left my back was in such a knot I had to stop on the sidewalk to just take a moment to stretch.  \n\nAs I wanted to make sure I wasn't too full before my entree arrived, we decided to pass on any starters, but I did try a slice of bread.   It was sourdough bread.   Nothing remarkable about it.    \n\nMy husband ordered the ribeye steak with a side of creamed spinach.   Two of his favorite things.   It could be that I live in a place where beef is prevalent and our steaks are cut thick, but the steak was really thin, like thinner than the soles on my shoes thin.   He ordered it rare and he said that it couldn't have been much rarer.   I take that as a good sign.  He has eaten in a lot of steakhouses around the country and said that this was one of the better steaks he has had.    The creamed spinach also received positive reviews and I don't think I have ever heard him remark on the quality of the baked potato before, but this one caused him to take note.\n\nNow, I'm going to lose a few of you here, but I ordered the calves liver and onions.   One of my favorite meals when I was a kid (the liver without the onions that is).   The liver was prepared perfectly.   The mixed vegetables that were served with the meal really didn't do much for me.   I'm not a huge fan of snap peas and I can't stand cooked carrots.   I picked out the zucchini and yellow squash and called it good.   They could have used a little more cooking time, or been called a salad.   I, too, enjoyed the baked potato (though I didn't eat much of it as my stomach had reached capacity).   \n\nThe waitstaff was very attentive and checked back with us regularly.   All in all, the food was good, not rave about it for months and  it was worth it for the experience of enjoying a meal in a San Francisco landmark.", "author": "Karin H."}

To be honest with you, it's probably the last on my list to try around Union Square area or in general. It's always that one place with some dude in front trying to lure you in as if you're a tourist. Stumbled upon this place on a weekend for the after-Christmas sales, every place was packed with 30+ minute wait. I was craving for a steak and wasn't feeling a Tad's Steak (gets the job done, but cravings will return shortly) or Lark's Creek (I've spent enough this month). So I ended up here since there were many slots on OpenTable for ~$30 steak. Not a bad choice if you were out here casually shopping, the restaurant is a bit narrow, was a bit hard to fit my bags with all these sales going on. The place looked so traditional, I could almost ask an invisible cousin sitting at the table to pass me the bread while my invisible grandma ask where is my significant other at dinner. \n\nOrdered a ribeye and creamed spinach on the side. I didn't trust them fixing my steak to medium rare so I ordered rare in case they overdo it. My meat came out so pink, I could almost match it with my nails!  They actually were able to prepare the meat just right. The seasoning was your traditional salt and pepper, just enough to bring out the meat's original taste. I liked it a lot actually, just simple and warming. Not as warming as it would have been if I ordered it medium rare though. The steak dinner also came with a baked potato and grilled veggies. The creamed spinach was a bit lacking, too single flavored, missing some type of spice and shallot. Needed a bit more aroma. Overall, dinner was great, it felt just like a holiday dinner on TV.", "author": "Connie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-09-22", "description": "Honestly, for the price and the wait, this was less than OK for me. I come from the land of beef/cattle, so I committed a cardinal sin by ordering a steak outside of Texas, but it's also really difficult for me to turn down Surf & Turf at a place that delivers both. \n\nI should have just stuck with the surf! \n\nWe started with raw oysters which were also pretty disappointing...they were fresh, but tiny, which I was only ok with because the price point was reasonable. \n\nI ordered the surf and turf, but my steak, ordered medium rare, was barely pink and I had to saw through tendons/gristle even with the steak knife in hand. That was extremely disappointing. I would have caused more of a stink about the state of my steak if I wasn't sitting in a tiny corner where our waiter couldn't even get to us because of the crowded table situation. He literally handed us menus across the backs of diners sitting at the two adjoining tables. \n\nServices was impeccable. Our waiter was definitely on top of things and I'm sure he would have made it right had I said something about my meal, but when you're edging toward 10 pm, the last thing you want to do is wait for another plate to be brought out/corrected. \n\nMy recommendations for this place would be:\n\n1. Take some tables out. You should NEVER have to sit at a table that you can't easily get into/out of or be properly waited on. The dining experience would just be that much better seeing as how fewer tables equals fewer diners which also means that the noise level would decrease (it was almost hard to hear yourself think). \n\n2. Don't skimp on beef if you're a steakhouse. Never, ever, ever, ever should a steakhouse serve a steak that has to be sawed through. The cut of the meat was just bad, no other way of slicing it (ba dum dum, ching!)\n\n3. Figure out a way to make the bar easily accessible. If I'm going to have to wait upwards of 30 minutes to be seated, I should be able to enjoy a drink. It helps me and it helps you make more money off of me. Win win. The bar was so cramped you could barely even get to it, not to mention that the unfortunate diners having to sit next to the bar were not able to sneeze without hitting someone. That drops your dining experience down significantly. Bottom line, if you're charging on average $50 a head for a drink and a plate, the atmosphere should reflect that.", "author": "Emily P."}

A week prior I had made on-line reservations, in the special request field, I wrote a \"Special Birthday,\" for my husband. After completing the on-line reservations, I called the restaurant directly, and spoke to a gentleman, confirming the reservation, I also, told him, it was my husband's birthday. I asked \"does the restaurant do anything special?\" His response, \"Oh, yes, we receive these requests all the time, no problem.\"\nWhen we arrived Sunday, October 2nd, after we were seated, I spoke to the hostess, and again, confirmed it was my husband's birthday, and something would be brought out, after our meal, \"of course, she said.\" We ordered our meal, the food was fair. The filet mignon was medium to medium well, even though my husband ordered medium rare. \nAfter dinner, our waiter came by, checked to see if we wanted dessert, I knew something special was going to be served, after all, I was reassured by 2 people, our waiter returned with the bill, but no dessert?\nI immediately excused myself, went to the hostess, asked, \"where was my husband's cake?\" she looked at me, and wasn't sure what to say. I then asked for the manager, he arrived, I explained, he acted like it was no big deal, even though the check was already delivered to our table, we could still have dessert, he clearly didn't understand. They delivered two small glasses of a sweet liquor and flan with a candle. At this point, the surprise was ruined. \nWhile our waiter was a very good waiter, because of this incident, how management discounted our experience and, the food which was not that good, I regretfully will not return back to this restaurant. There are far too many wonderful restaurants in the area.\n\nHusband UPDATE: We were contacted directly by the restaurant and we were given a name of someone to contact at the restaurant. We called and were quite impressed with deeply felt apologies from the contact. This contact went above and beyond to make the situation better. We are at this time comfortable with restaurant that we will be returning for a second chance. Everyone deserves a second chance. I will update the review after our return.", "author": "Brent J."}

Yes, 8 minutes from order to table.  They split the meal on 2 plates, which would have been nice if they would have allowed the steak to rest before cutting it in half.

Tonight - to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday - we had dinner at John's Grill, which was (somehow!) a first for both of us.\n\nOur reservation was for 6:00 p.m.; when we arrived at 5:45, they were ready to seat us (and it wasn't as if they were having a slow night - the restaurant was full). We chose, however, to first have a cocktail at their little bar while we waited for our daughter to join us. We were immediately charmed by the bartender, Gary, who told us about the rich history of the restaurant, offered a sample of a fine Scotch, and talked \"shop\" with my husband (who is also a bartender).\n\nOnce our daughter arrived, and had had a cocktail with us, we decided to eat at the bar, rather than take a table - we were having that much fun with Gary (although I doubt that Gary was having that much fun with US!). As a starter, we shared an order of the lobster ravioli (just a couple of ravioli each), which was outstanding. For the entree, I had the NY Steak, my husband had the grilled sea bass, and our daughter had the Prawns Provencal. No one was disappointed! In fact, all of us were excited to share, and spent a great deal of time happily spooning food into each other's mouths. Even the baked potato and broccoli rabe were great. Everything was...perfect. Truly.\n\nGary recommended our wines and entrees, and didn't once steer us wrong. He also, very thoughtfully, ordered a flan for us to share at the end of our meal in honor of my husband's birthday - candle and all.\n\nLast, but by no means least, the ambiance here is as good as it gets in San Francisco. This is THE quintessential San Francisco dining experience. Old-timey, dark wood, pictures of celebrities, politicians and dignitaries lining the walls...this is the real deal. And, of course, it's where Dashell Hammit wrote, \"The Maltese Falcon,\" upon which the movie of the same name, starring Humphrey Bogart, was based. There is a mini museum (basically, a cupboard) on the second floor, which features a replica of The Falcon itself (replica because the original was stolen several years ago), among other Falcon-centric memorabilia. \n\nJohn's Grill is a must for anyone looking for a \"true\" San Francisco restaurant and all that that implies, great service, a great meal at a good price, and anyone interested in classic movies.

There is a cocktail menu and nice selection of wine by the glass which are poured almost too amply by the bartender. The meal started with a basket of chewy, fresh sourdough bread and butter. The clam chowder bowl was presented with fresh ground pepper. It was piping hot, relatively thick and savory if not borderline salty. It was quite heavy on the clam and overall satisfying.

I ordered the Ribeye and my wife had the fillet.  The cuts were prime and both were cooked exactly to order and were delicious!  We had a bottle of Longoria Pinot Grigio which was EXCELLENT and reasonably priced.\n\nWe ended our meal with a glass of port (tuaca for the little woman) and a conversation with the young couple at the next table.  \n\nEven though this was a steak house in downtown San Francisco, as is sat there sipping port out of a proper cordial glass, I thought the place had the mob feel of New York or Chicago in the 30's and 40's...

I've been to John's Grill numerous times in twenty years and this is the first time the food was unacceptable.  We had reservations after seeing the Nutcracker so this was to be special holiday meal.  Our reservations were for 5:15 p.m. on a Friday.  We were seated promptly and order immediately.  We ordered lobster ravioli, red snapper with veggies and a baked potato and the Fisherman pasta (linguine).  Immediately after ordering the waitress informs me that they do not have any baked potatoes ready and that it would be an additional 30 minutes.  Mind you John's Grill does not have mashed potatoes or rice, so the only other option is fries...for a plate that is almost $30.  I waited.  In the meantime the raviolis came and half of them were still cold inside. SMH I was going to send them back but didn't want to make an issue of it since my daughter had chosen this place.  Now for the Fisherman pasta...worst dish of all.  The so called linguine tasted like Pasta Roni, I kid you not.  The noodles were mushy and sauce tasted worse than what comes out of a jar...way too think.  The best part of our meal was the bread and the dessert, which neither John's Grill baked.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-26", "description": "I've been hearing and reading about this place for years,  the legendary century-old institution featured in the Maltese Falcon.  I love historic places, and am a bit of a Bogart/Sam Spade/film noir fan, so I really wanted to check it out.  But every time I've been in the neighborhood, it was totally booked up.  Finally, on my latest trip to San Francisco, I got to try it, a couple of times.\n\nFirst visit, I met up with a friend for post-conference drinks after a long day at Moscone Center.  The place (or should I say \"the joint\") certainly looks its age.  From the vintage neon sign out front, to the dark, vaguely musty interior, John's Grill certainly feels historic.  In business since 1908, and apparently never altered since, it's all dark wood paneling, dark wood partition running down the middle, small and cramped, designed for those smaller people of that era, not for big 6'4\" lugs like me (sorry, my inner Spade is coming out).  Sure, I can definitely imagine Bogie/Sam Spade grabbing a drink or a bite here. The only addition over the years seems to be the ever-growing collection of B&W photos covering the walls, which range from scenes of post-1906-quake devastation to decades of celebrity patrons.  We sat at the bar, which wasn't exactly comfortable -- smallish, rickety, hard-edged old bar stools and no rail to rest your feet on -- but they served us excellent cocktails.  I had a French Gimlet, which is sort of a citrus-laced martini, my buddy an Old Fashioned, both notably good. \n\nSecond visit, I was on my own, my last night in town, and I went for a full dinner.  To submerse myself in the whole Sam Spade aura of the joint, I downloaded a copy of the original 1929 Dashiell Hammett novel, The Maltese Falcon, and read it while I ate.  Yup, there it is: \"...Right.  Have him pick me up at John's, Ellis Street, as soon as he can make it. ... He went to John's Grill, asked the waiter to hurry his order of chops, baked potato, and sliced tomatoes, ate hurriedly, and was smoking a cigarette with his coffee when a thick-set youngish  man with plaid cap set askew above pale eyes and a tough cheery face came into the Grill and to his table.\"  I wonder if it was my table. \n\nThe food is also old-school, the kind of stuff your grandparents would be comfortable ordering.  I started with a Dungeness Crab Cocktail, which turned out to be just a generous pile of crab meat with cocktail sauce in an ice-chilled dish  -- excellent, fresh, simple.  Then I had the Roquefort Salad (note: roquefort, not \"blue cheese.\" I remember my mom always used to order \"roquefort\" dressing, back when I was kid), which wasn't quite what I expected (cheese crumbles, not a creamy dressing) but still good.  My main dish was the Seafood Cioppino a la Marinara, which was also excellent.  The flavor was more old-style American than Italian, the tomato-based broth reminding me of Manhattan-style clam chowder, but it was loaded with all sorts of excellent seafood. Very tasty and satisfying.  I topped off the meal with the New York Cheesecake, which turned out not to be a massive wedge (fortunately), but a modest-sized hockey puck of cheesecake topped with berries -- just right, and one of the most delicious vanilla-laced cheesecakes I've ever tasted.\n\nSo yeah, even though it's a bit cramped and not particularly comfortable, stuffy in back and drafty by the door, I kinda like this joint.  I'll be back. Maybe bring a dame next time.", "author": "Steve L."}

Ok.. it's pretty limited, For a \"Steak\" place, it's mostly seafood.   There are a few salads, there are a few sandwiches but there are a lot of seafood choices and there are a few grill options.  In the end, once the waiter came to take our order (after delivering some REALLY GOOD sour dough bread!) we ordered 2 lunch salads and the husband got a hamburger and I got the NY Steak sandwich. \n\nThe bread was -phenomenal-! It must be from a local bakery because it was So Good. Of course, Due to my diet, I've not had real bread in ages, so that might have been why too.. but yea! BREAD!.. The salads.. for $5, I expected something more than a half cup of mixed greens, 2 slices of cucumbers cut in half. a wedge of tomatoe and about 2 table spoons of carrots and cabbage.

Since most of downtown SF looks like a smashed erector set these days, I was concerned that the stretch of Ellis where John's sits might be in upheaval as well; thankfully all was fine.\n\nThe room is tight, to put it mildly, but the eclectic group of diners -- tourists, conventioneers, and a gaggle of Herb Caen's \"EssEff\" literary characters -- makes people-watching well worth the submarine wardroom snugness.\n\nOh, the food?  As good as ever, predictable, ample courses with good drinks and friendly, efficient service.  I chose their club sandwich with fries, a dish any good restaurant should knock out easily, but so few do.  John's definitely rates an A+.  My colleague gave his fresh fish choice the same grade.\n\nProbably not a destination place for me, but if you are working and/or shopping downtown, by all means it is worth a visit soon, perhaps best for a late lunch.

To our surprise we were seated upstairs immediately. The room was crowded but the live jazz guitar helped the mood. To start, I had a bowl of their thick and creamy clam chowder. My wife had a dinner salad. For entrees I ordered the T-bone steak medium and my wife had the fishermen's pasta.  The food came out quickly and the seafood pasta was terrific. I had to send the steak back as it was barely kissed by the grill and far to rare for my taste. Our server handled it like a champion and without delay and comped my wine. My cooked to order steak arrived in just moments later and was delicious. Our server continued to be attentive without hovering and the remainder of our experience was a delight.

Brother picked this place since it was near our hotel. Place was pretty busy for a Thursday night...good thing he made reservations. We got seated right away. The menu was pretty simple..take your pick of steaks and seafood...mostly fish and then they had four other dishes... lamb, liver, chicken and oyster wellington. \n\nI opted for the oyster wellington...my brother opted for the ribeyed steak... my mom had the grilled liver and my dad had the broiled sea bass. For appetizers we tried the escargot and sauteed mushrooms and creamed spinach for sides. \n\nThe food took a very long time to come out... we waited for about 30 minutes or so. The escargot came out pretty quick...6 nickel-size pieces drenched in a basic white sauce served on a fancy little dish...it was okay...a little on the bland side...would prefer a more buttery based sauce..but that's my personal preference. Our main dishes came out really late.. waited what felt like 30 minutes or so for it after the one appetizer we had. \n\nMy dish came with three mini oyster wellingtons and veggies (sugar snap peas and a couple of baby carrots and two pieces of zucchini)- first bite of the wellingtons were pretty good however I realized it was stuffed with more bacon than oysters...it was stuffed with bacon and spinach. Still pretty good though. The veggies were kinda bad....sugar snap peas were chewy and undercooked...the other pieces of vegetables were slightly undercooked and bland. However, the two side dishes we ordered was much better - good sauteed mushrooms and creamed spinach. My brother's rib eye steak was acceptable - tender and flavorful. The grilled liver was a tad chewy but the crispy bacon compensated for the mild flavor of the dish. In the end only my brother ordered dessert - a rich but very tasty chocolate mousse torte. I was stuffed but still couldn't resist a few bite of it. \n\nNow onto the service - I straight out didn't like ourl waiter.....perhaps he's tired or whatever but he was so inattentive and I can't say he was all that friendly either. Felt like I had to snap my fingers at him to get his attention and having waited for so long for the food - he didn't bother to tell us. No no on service!\n\nOverall the meal was pretty decent but I need another waiter next time.", "author": "Joanna L."}

I have dined there several times over the years and regrettably, its gone downhill. How so?\n\nUsed to be that there was a knowledgeable and personable bartender who served you drinks and took your food order.  Last night, the bartender took my drink order and that was it.  He was polite enough but made no effort to engage in conversation.  And he only serves drinks.  A waiter came over and took my food order, again he was polite, but rushed.  \n\nI ordered the lamb chops, a house specialty, and 5 minutes later I was served them. Why am I complaining about fast service?  Because they couldn't possibly have been made to order in that amount of time.  The Chops themselves were decent but nothing to brag about, I've had better.  But the message that clearly was being sent was to rush me (and I suppose other diners) through: serve drinks, take your order, and then hurry it to you.  Repeat with next customer. \n\nJohn's should know that one of the pleasures of dining at the bar in a \"fine\" dining restaurant is to have an unhurried meal, prepared to order, and served by a knowledge and conversational bartender. That used to be the case here, no longer. \n\nI guess they can live off their storied history but it will take more than the Maltese Falcon to get me to dine there again.

The inside is historic SF and the walls covered with pictures of famous people who have frequented the place, not to mention Dashel Hammett. The service is always good, except on my recent visit, the server was just \"ok\". No need to wait for a special occasion to dine here. \n\nAmong my favorites is the New England clam chowder, seafood cannelloni, fishermen's pasta, chef's special red snapper, and the chicken Jerusalem (I got my mom hooked on this one). The steaks aren't bad either and a throwback to the old days where you got the sides and not just a piece of meat. \n\nIf you visit, check out the vintage bar and try to get a table on the second floor as it seems less crowded and a little more classic.

The mussels were huge, tender, perfectly cooked, and swimming in a garlicky pool of utter deliciousness. Once we had licked the bowl, we split a medium rare ribeye, our appetites fueled by a couple of kick-ass old fashioneds. Excellent flavor, perfectly done, accompanied by tastily  seasoned fresh vegetables and a fat baked potato that we slathered with butter and sour cream. A completely satisfying steakhouse dinner. Go.

A streetlight glows in the dark and illuminates the front door of a small, nondescript restaurant. A man looms out of the night sporting a long trench coat. A wide brimmed hat obscures his face. The mysterious figure slips through the door. \n\nWhen I follow him in, I find Phillip Marlowe, who looks remarkably like Humphrey Bogart, smirking and sneering by the bar while smoking a cigarette. Dashiell Hammett is tucked in a corner scribbling in his notebook. The piano player turns out to be Nat King Cole who starts singing a wistful tune in his smooth, mellow voice.\n\nIn reality, it was in the middle of a hot, sunny day in December. I was doing some holiday shopping around Union Square and I decided to break for a late lunch. I wanted to get away from the crowds, but didn't want to walk too far from the stores, so I decided to eat at John's Grill. \n\nFood was OK. Very solid and dependable. I decided to be daring and got the escargots in garlic cream. The appetizer came in a dish that had little wells that reminded me of an artist's painting palette. A snail nestled in each well. The snails were chewy and once I got over the \"ewww\" factor, quite tasty. I got the NY steak sandwich. Very basic but well executed. \n\nService was efficient if harried. I think I must have come during a shift change. For the first half of my meal, it seemed like my server was covering the front door, the bar and the tiny dining room all by herself. Luckily, I wasn't in any hurry and was prepared to linger and rest my weary feet. \n\nThe restaurant itself had a lot of character. Dark wood floors. Celebrity photos lining the dark panel walls. Potted palms and green leafy plants lined a half wall divider. Brass lamps brightened the space. The bentwood chairs felt very fragile, mine creaked every time I shifted in my seat.\n\nThe first floor dining area is small since about a third of the square footage is taken up by the kitchen and bar. The restrooms are on the second floor, past the kitchen and up a cramped stairwell. The upstairs dining room is bigger and actually kind of cool.

Being a block away, and having been here before with a client, my friend opted to eat here instead - immediate gratification won out over tastier food, unfortunately.\n\nIt's a bit tough for me to classify the decor of this place: a mixture of neat and kitschy, it's definitely geared towards an older crowd, and tourists too, at that, given its location. That said, not wanting to drop $30+ on a diverted lunch, I ended up ordering the deluxe burger for $13, while my lunch companion got their ravioli. Both dishes were decent, with the burger being a very simple one - but, for $13, I'm expecting an amazing burger (a la Thermidor).\n\nFriendly service and okay food leaves these folks with 2.5 stars.", "author": "Johnny W."}

After we had time to look over our menus my Aunt told the waiter that she was stumped as to what she should get. Instead of offering some assistance he just left us alone. Every time he came to check on us it seemed as though he was rushing us to hurry up and get out. Not very good customer service. I ordered lobster ravioli. It was an appetizer that was a tad over priced. When I tried my food I noticed that the lobster was EXTREMELY minced and grainy. To the point were you couldn't even tell that there was lobster inside of it. My aunt ordered the oyster Wellington, specialty dish featured in gourmet magazine, which had nothing special about it. My aunt found her food extremely bland. Don't get us wrong, the food was not awful but it was definitely not worth the price. So, as  we are trying to leave the waiter notices that almost to all of my aunts food is still on her plate. Instead of asking if everything was okay or if she wanted to box anything up, he just takes the plate and leaves. So... long story short...... this place was a waste of money.", "author": "Avory G."}

Any place that's been around since 1908 gets a bit of a pass. The bathrooms and upper floor are not accessible, and the ground floor is packed and narrow. Let them know that your party includes a wheelchair and they'll do their darndest to make things work; they'll need to pry open the front doors and maybe move some chairs. (Wheelie tip: there are lots of hotels nearby whose bathrooms are only a block or two away.)\n\nThis place is serious old school, so if that isn't what you like, don't bother. Leave room for the rest of us. \n\nIn case you somehow don't know already, John's Grill is mentioned by name in the text of 'The Maltese Falcon' as a place where Our Hero gets a chop. A collection of mystery writers and buffs helped keep the place going, and the upstairs function room used to feature an original copy of the Falcon itself from the movie (it was stolen a while ago, not sure if they ever got it back). The walls are covered in photos of famous writers and City luminaries and historical newspapers and the like. It's old and classic. \n\nJohn's also gets by by shilling itself out on the list of Fine Recommended Dining at a lot of local swanky hotels and convention lists, so expect it to be packed when the Association of Surgeons or whoever are in town. It's less packed on weeknights and great for lunch. You want to get a reservation. On the rare occasion where I've had any problems with the service, it's because the place was packed to the gills with conventioneers and they were swamped. \n\nThe menu is old and classic and features that aforementioned Chop as well as some tasty local specials and great steaks. My partner is fond of the Jerusalem Chicken. I get a steak usually but the seafood options are also tasty. The wine list is decent and they know their way around a classic bar menu very well; Cocktail Snob has never had a complaint here. \n\nTake a noir buff or old-school dining connoisseur here for a treat. Not ideal for big groups unless you're reserving the upstairs inaccessible room, but for meeting your girlfriend's parents or treating a visiting boss type, John's Grill has your back.", "author": "Anne K."}

There was a bit of a line, and the 1st floor was a bit warm inside.

Not too much fat was left, just enough to do the job, and not feel like you had a poor fat to meat ratio.  The included potato was a disappointment, it was overdone.\n\nThe part that brings them down two stars... Service. Not that they weren't prompt, which they were.  It's the barging in over the shoulders shoving in food, refilling water etc that was annoying.  No \"excuse me coming,\" so we could lean over and away. I kept getting bumped each and every time they brought something to the table. I kept getting splashed each time they poured water. Annoying.\n\nNo acknowledgement to me saying thank you. In fact, I'd argue the hostess refilling water didn't want to be there at all, that night!  \n\nWas the steak good? Yes.

I don't know about the history so I can't really appreciate the maltese falcon. I can only comment on the atmosphere, service, and food. \n\nWe got a reservation on OpenTable and came in at 8pm on a Saturday. \n\nAtmosphere: It is cramped. War-zone like on a Saturday night with diners dodging servers in the narrow lanes between tables. It is dim, and rather annoying that many other customers were flashing their bright iphone lights everywhere when reading menus. The live music was very good, but since it's so small and packed with people, the roar of conversation overrides it. We were really only able to hear it because we were sitting directly next to the keyboard. \n\nService: Server was really nice, but it took him so long to get anything. Refills on water, waiting for him to come around and bring more bread, waiting for him to come so we could place our orders, waiting for him to come to ask him to get the check, etc... If I had to guess, it wasn't his fault but rather that they were understaffed. \n\nFood: My lamb chops were very tender and quite flavorful. I also go the escargots which were nothing to write home about, but my friends were impressed having never tried snails before. Our table also shared a couple bowls of clam chowder which was the highlight of the evening. The other entrees at the table were not very good. The Seafood Cannelloni was full of cream and cheese more than anything and my girl friend's ribeye was very tough @ medium rare. We're total steak connoisseurs and have a hard time believing that it was grade A dry-aged beef. \nBottomline: Soup, appetizer, and lamb chops were alright. The beef and seafood weren't worth it. \n\nGo somewhere else for that rare night out. You can get much better food, service, and ambience better for the price.", "author": "Farrah N."}

We were to early to check in to our hotel so we parked and looked for a spot to eat. It was our first time in San Francisco and we were pretty confused with the streets. There seemed to be Burger Kings everywhere. With rumbling tummys, no desire to eat Burger King, and the need to get out of the car we went into the first restaurant we could find which happened to be johns grill. The place is cramped, they didn't seem to have a table for a party larger then 4. My daughters chair was added to the side of our 4 top table in the walkway. (We had a party of 5) When we looked inside we saw a couple with a 3 or 4 year old so I assumed they had kids menus. Boy was I wrong. Our waitress came over and we asked if they had grilled chicken or chicken strips...nope. She said she would give us time and never came back. We decided since we were there we would bite the bullet and allow our kids to order the $27 steak....each. After about 20 minutes of our waitress ignoring us every time she passed by (I think she wanted us to just leave) another waiter dropped some bread at our table as he was passing by to deliver food. I'm pretty sure he felt bad for us. Finally after another 5 minutes another guy came over and took our order. He was nice and made up a lot for our waitress that abandoned us. My kids enjoyed their steaks. My husband ordered the red snapper, it was delicious. I had the lobster ravioli. It was just ok.

There are some drawbacks to this restaurant, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons. This review is for lunch time only.\n\nFirst the price. Can't be beat. This restaurant is about 25% cheaper than you would find at pretty much any other place in the area for the same quality. The dinner prices negate this value as they are pretty standard nighttime prices.\n\nThen the food. Foodies are definitely going to be disappointed. The menu, like all the great old-school restos left, hasn't changed in decades. And, yes this is a good thing. But old-school sometimes does not stand up to today's standards. For instance, the beef is cooked over direct open flame, so you get a lot more char on the steaks and burgers than you would normally expect. Cooked perfectly, just a lot of char. I'm not a big fan of this, but my dad loves it. My favorite dishes are the Jack LaLanne Salad, the clam chowder and the Crab Legs Supreme. Even though the Lamplighter (crab-stuffed sole) sounds better, the Supreme is a bit tastier. Now the clam chowder is hand down the BEST clam chowder ANYWHERE, no possible argument. It is simply perfect consistency and flavor. Their mustard vinaigrette is to die for, but the greens they put them on are a bit lacking. This used to be a straight green and/or red lettuce with tomato & cucumber slices, and they downgraded (in my opinion) to mixed greens, cherry tomatoes and cucumber pieces. The food is all top-quality recipes, even the mashers are whipped with butter and I think cheese. The french bread is excellent.\nThe d\u00e9cor is definitely showing its age. It's charming, but they need to upgrade the furniture and refinish the wood and other things. This is not a slight, it's just becoming a bit tired, but again, part of the charm.\nOverall, if you get some favorites, you can't go wrong with this place.", "author": "Jeff S."}

We made reservations which I would suggest, they even let us choose the area we sat in (upstairs, by the window).  \n\nEnvironment- The restaurant is very old and very beautiful.  There was a jazz player who was amazingly talented sitting directly behind us.  He played the Beatles \"Yesterday\" upon my request (after I tipped him of course).  It was a busy Saturday night so the place was packed with people talking (or yelling...if you don't like noisy places I wouldn't suggest this one on a weekend).  I think it added to the ambiance.  \n\nFood- I got the Chilean Sea Bass, others at the tables got the Halibut, the Prime rib, the Oysters, and some amazing seafood soup (by far the best pick!).  Everything was perfect! Each entree comes with a baked potato and vegies.  For dessert we ordered the cheesecake which was small but very good, the chocolate mouse which had a bit too much dark chocolate for me but if you like dark chocolate then I would suggest it, and a bowl of mixed berries and whipped cream...yum!\n\nPrice- A bit pricey, but my in-laws were paying so I didn't get to see the overall total\n \nDrinks- I ordered the signature drink that comes with a souvenir glass..it tasted like a spiked shirley temple and it was very good!\n\nService- Our server wasn't the best I've ever had, he rushed us a little bit with the drinks and didn't come back to refill our waters unless we asked him and even then it took him forever...but he was very busy so we all understood.\n\n\nOverall amazing environment, amazing food, we had a blast and will definitely come back! oh...I hope the same Jazz player is there!", "author": "Courtney M."}

But even so, there's just no real excuse for poor service.\n\nOur waitress, a dippy young blonde, I think was more interested in ending her shift for the night than she was in actually providing great service. We had to ask multiple times for things like bread, butter, water. The topper was when I'd ordered a well done ribeye and was brought a medium NY, horribly pink in the center.

We stopped outside to view the menu, as two ladies walked out and told us to go in, the food is fabulous. So we did. I loved the ambience, the connection to the Maltese Falcon, the decor. Had no idea we'd stumbled upon a landmark. The three of us were seated and a waiter promptly welcomed us and we ordered drinks. I ordered a caesar salad and was discouraged by the waiter as he stated it was very large. So I changed it to a house salad, and ordered the Ravioli Primavera, which was so good I ended up eating the portion I thought I would take back to the hotel. My husband ordered the burger, served open faced, and forgot to mention no tomato (allergy) and so asked to replace just the lettuce, onion, and pickle. The waiter never returned with it, nor did he check in to see if we'd like a second glass of wine. Our companion ordered the salmon, which he said was the best he's ever had. Eventually the waiter did return, passed the buck to someone else who \"never brought you the lettuce and pickle?\" and apologized. Our companion was a bit riffed, but the waiter soon returned with a complimentary flan surrounded by fresh berries that was absolutely divine, and all was forgiven. The food was delicious. I am very picky about service, as my family owns a fine dining restaurant, and the waiter's forgetfulness did not go unnoticed. He couldn't remember who ordered which wine, nor the entrees we each ordered. He was otherwise pleasant and knew how to smooth a misstep that made us leave happy rather than feeling \"meh.\" On a side note, this being my first trip to San Fran, I was shocked at the number of homeless. One of them made his way loudly into the restaurant, just asking for a cup of coffee. I had my back to him and the door, but the hostess handled the situation well. I could barely hear her voice as she spoke to him, and he was quickly gone. If we ever get back out west, we'll be back.", "author": "Tara A."}

We were still charged for the steak but got a complementary small desert that was very good!. Seemed like the waiter got a little bit of an attitude after I expressed my dislike for the steak.

The reviews were good and it was close to our hotel.  \n\nThe service was wonderful.  Our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  The mandatory San Francisco sourdough bread was brought to our table warm and crispy soon after we sat down.  \n\nI ordered the New York strip medium rare and my husband ordered the rib eye medium rare.  The couple at the table next to us (the tables are very close together) and made comments about the meat not being cooked as requested, and they were so right.  The ribeye arrived medium.  My New York was well done.  I asked the waitress for another steak; she was very apologetic and took away the dish.  Shortly after, my steak arrived.  This time it was not just rare, it practically mooed.  Our waitress had waited until I cut the steak to make sure it was okay, and immediately took it back.  The couple next to us started laughing and we all agreed that if the chef in a steak house can't cook steak, that cook needs to be replaced.  Although the steak was over cooked when it returned, I had given up by then and just ate it.\n\nThe restaurant was busy but I was very surprised that after returning the steak twice the manager never came over.", "author": "Francine L."}

It arrived with a coating of flour and pan seared.  But ...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-23", "description": "Located just off Union Square convenient to theaters, shopping, and tourist attractions, historic John's Grill is a favorite of San Franciscans and tourists alike.\n\nThe home of Daschiel Hammett's Maltese Falcon, the wood paneled dining room makes patrons feel as if they are the stars of a Bogart flick.  Just order one of John's capacious martinis, and one can almost see the fictional Sam Spade or any of the myriad of real-world personalities that have come before you--from Hillary Clinton, Ronald Reagan, and Al Gore to Joe DiMaggio, Baronesse Phillipine de Rothschild, or Andy Warhol.\n\nClassic rather than innovative, the menu features selections like jumbo prawn cocktail, escargots with garlic cream sauce, and the delicious Jack Lalane's Favorite Salad (for 2) consisting of fresh seasonal greens, dungeness crab, shrimp, avocado, and tomatoes--it was so huge one wonders how Jack could have eaten it all by himself.  (Ord er dressing on the side, as the chef seems to believe that lettuce should be overwhelmingly drenched.)  Continuing the traditional theme, entr\u00e9es include steaks, seafood, and pastas.  A thick, bone-in New York cut, the John's Steak was cooked rare as ordered, a \"rarity\" in these days of caution in the kitchen.\n\nThe compact wine list is not a trophy tome as in many high-end restaurants.  Consisting of selections mainly from California and France, it simply contains the wines that a diner would need to complement John's straightforward food--some good Chardonnays, some great Cabs, and the odd Pinot, all reasonably priced.\n\nService is friendly and attentive.  Bread arrives, drinks arrive, appetizers are served, drinks get refilled, entr\u00e9es arrive, drinks get refilled, the check arrives--all like clockwork:  nothing fancy, nothing pretentious, just good, professional, honest service.\n\nNo wonder John's Grill has been a San Francisco tradition from before the time of Herb Caen.  John's is an icon--it's not trendy; it doesn't have a world famous chef who has his own TV program; it doesn't have a multi-million dollar marketing budget--it is simply a restaurant that delivers good, classic food at reasonable prices.", "author": "CJ G."}

Steaks were very good, but not great. Did not seem any better than those at steakhouses like Mortons or Ruth Chris. I had to send one steak back because it wasn't cooked the way I ordered it. The baked potato seemed small in comparison to other high-end steakhouses. Service was good but inconsistent and a little scattered. Busboys kept trying to take our plates before we were finished.

Bits of shell were left over from shucking and the oysters weren't detached from the shell, which made it less enjoyable.", "author": "Christina V."}

My girlfriend and I were seated on the second level, and since the tables for two upstairs are right next to each other, who your neighbors are really matters.  While the couple to our left were perfectly fine, the couple on our right were having a way too loud business meeting.  On a Sunday night?!?  Anyway, my loud neighbors really brought the evening down.\n\nI liked the food (I had the John's steak) and for my one and only, she really enjoyed the mussels and liked her steak as well.  The piano player we had was very good.\n\nThe baked potato was fine but it was odd that it only came out with sour cream, no chives, and for butter, I had to take a foil pack pad of butter out of the bread basket.  Do I mind doing these things?  No.  But when I go out to dinner, I'd rather not feel like the scrounger at Stalag 17 trying to put a proper potato together.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience and I would go back.

I'll take my money to Flemings, thanks.\n\nThis place wasn't BAD, but there was nothing special about it. I don't understand how it's survived since 1908.. Maybe being in such a tourist-trap area has its perks, or maybe the standards of cuisine in SF just weren't as high for most of the 20th century.\n\nOur mussels in garlic butter broth appetizer was good, and generous in portion. My friend had some seafood salad which was very generous in the amount of seafood in it, as well. Our other friend got the lamb, which he liked. I tried a bite and it was okay, but it just did not have the flavor of lamb chops from better restaurants that I've been to. \n\nI ordered the porterhouse, medium rare. The meat was flavorless for some place that's supposed to specialize in steaks. Even after adding their peppercorn sauce, all I could taste is the char and no meat flavor. The meat was also very overdone -- most of my New York felt very tough and very dry. To top it all off, it was a SMALL porterhouse.\n\nMeh... If the steak cost as much as one from Sizzlers or something, I would think about coming back here. For this price, though, I'm sure the only people coming here are the tourists in the Union Square vicinity.", "author": "Kazu O."}

We could have left there and then and been happy with our happy bellies.\n\nBUT, we both ordered the Filet Mignon.  Yummers!  My boyfriends' steak was disproportionately smaller than mine, and he sent it back and got a normal sized one.  Once it came, we dug in and we both loved the way that the steak melted in our mouths.  Amazing!\n\nWe finished off the night with the cheesecake, and we were sent home with happy bellies.  There was not a drop left on our plates.  We had some yummy drinks thoughout the night including the John's special drink (which was ok) as well as champagne, wine, and kaluha (sp?) and cream.\n\nOur waitress was amazing.  She was very friendly and was happy to answer any questions.  It was a throwback to the days where it felt like a night on the town was a night with amazing food and quality service.\n\nIn a city with amazing food, I felt like we hit a historic gem.  I feel like every time I head out for a special (as in expecting good food for a good buck) meal, it is some fusion meal with a twist.

It was not very good at all. It was not fresh by any means and had no taste other than the lemon I squeezed until death on the lifeless and most likely previously frozen crab meat.  John Bob says, pass on this if you go here. I ordered the rib-eye. It was a very thin steak, surprisingly so. It was the size of a Denny's steak you might get with scrambled eggs sitting in a booth with hobos at 2AM.

We were seated right away upstairs, which was excellent as we were both hungry and I hate the idea of anyone having to wait for food on their birthday.\n\nStarted off with a Grey Goose martini, which was potent and good. Not sure where they get their bread but it's damn good (and I honestly have no business eating gluten). I also had the house salad with tarragon dressing - great mix of veggies and those itty bitty shrimpies. The dressing was delicious.\n\nWe both ordered the steak - I like mine cooked to medium. When our food arrived - which was faster than I expected - I was a little nervous that there wasn't any sauce to dip the meat in. No A1? What?? (Tip: they do have two sauces you can order on the side for an extra charge.) But I thought, this place has been here a damn long time, they know what they are doing. And they most definitely do. The steak was tender and moist and flavorful. I didn't miss the sauce and they obviously get very choice cuts of meat. You definitely get what you pay for here.\n\nFor those whining about a limited menu, or small portions for the money, get over yourselves: this isn't Applebees or TGI Friday's.

For over 20 years this restaurant has had ambiance, excellent service, and incredible food.  One of the FEW PLACES that makes REAL CAESAR SALAD from scratch!!!!!.. The bread is fresh made and delicious, the Steaks are legendary. Yesterday I was \"tourist guide\" for my co-workers, They asked me to take them to a good steak place, and they were greatly impressed with he restaurant atmosphere and the food.  They have live music, and that adds a special touch to the meal. I highly recommend this historic place. Don't forget to buy a  John's Grill highball glass to take home.", "author": "mario a."}

It's far too expensive to want to try again.\n\n I ordered the seafood linguini ($32.50). It HIT the spot, dead on. I had just come from shopping and was looking for something hearty and creamy. The linguini is packed with seafood - shrimp, clams (like 8 of them!), fish, crab - and mushrooms. I felt the pasta was done right because there wasn't a bunch of sauce leftover once I was finished. I'll assume that the pasta sauce stuck to the pasta (as it should when made properly). I was shocked by how much seafood they gave you. Usually I expect very little meat in my pasta dishes when I order it at restaurants, but they were generous and I appreciate that. \n\nIt was crowded Sunday night when I went with friends. Also my friend ordered the porterhouse steak. Oh my goodness that thing is huge. It covered the entire plate (part of it was bone yes). It looked like it was a 30 oz. steak (?)! So order that when you're super hungry or if you can eat a lot. I got to steal a taste and yes..it was delicious. They do steak right. Salt, pepper, proper cooking time is all ya need to do steak right. That and good beef of course.", "author": "Sarah W."}

We decided for an early dinner on a historic restaurant with a literary connection: John's Grill.  (This restaurant was featured in novels by Dashiell Hammett, such as the Maltese Falcon). \n\nEven though it was a Friday night, as it was early (around 5:30 pm), we had no trouble getting a table.  At this time only the first of three floors was in use. We were seated in a booth in the back; it was surrounded by photos of Dashiell Hammett and photos of historic San Francisco. \n\nMy son ordered Oysters Wellington.  He inquired if it was indeed an entree and not an appetizer and was assured that it was an entree and of sufficient quantity.  He was a bit disappointed to find that it was only three (but they were plumb) oysters, with each coated with pate and a puff pastry, in addition to string beans.  He felt that for the price of $23 there should have been more.  However, he did feel that the taste was excellent.\n\nI had Seafood Cannelloni ($21).  It was two large cannelloni that were stuffed with a very delicious mixture of seafood and covered with a very nice sauce.  (Also served with string beans). \n\nWe had very good service and an overall good experience.  A bit pricey for the portions, but it was a good before-the-symphony dinner. \n\nJohn's Grill is conveniently located near the Powell Street Bart/Muni station, one block up Powell and a half a block east on Ellis.  After dinner, we walked to Bart and in about 20 minutes were in front of the Paramount Theatre in Oakland.", "author": "Mike M."}

Excellent personalized service, great food, a warm, cosy atmosphere and music that soothes without being intrusive.\n\nWe came across it by chance one Sunday night years ago; a caring staff member invited us inside from the cold and placed us at what would normally be a much coveted table by the bar. When you look at the magnificent dark wood panelled walls you quickly realise that you're sharing the experience of presidents, movie stars and an amazing array of celebrities past and present. It reeks of atmosphere and is the ideal place for a romantic dinner; on one occasion I ordered roses for my lovely wife from here in Australia and sure enough they were there on our table when we arrived. When we last dined there we invited my family from Palo Alto and they were equally impressed. Like my namesake (McArthur) we will return.\nDr Arthur F.

Proximity and pricing were big motivating factors. The location was great and we got right in with no wait on a Sunday night. We got sat upstairs at a two top table right next two other two tops. A bit odd being so close to other couples like we are all dining together, but it was fine. I ordered a dirty martini with extra olives and got no extra olives. I ordered the filet mignon and my boyfriend got the New York strip. We both agreed our steaks were seasoned wonderfully but our steaks were lukewarm when we got them. I could tell they were sitting for awhile. I mentioned it to the server and got a little bit of attitude even though she offered to take it back. I said no, knowing what it's like when take back orders get sent to the  kitchen. (I worked as a server before).  I just wanted to give her feedback is all. She didn't even apologize and avoided eye contact with me for the remainder of the night, but did great in bringing my boyfriend flan with a candle. It was his birthday and the pianist played happy birthday, which was a nice touch. Overall, a very nice meal and experience.", "author": "Cynthia M."}

We loved sitting next to the contemporary jazz guitarist upstairs in the bustling cozy room full of families and friends gathering close across tables close up just like the feeling I had out in Paris or New York! I was surprised at the generous variety of greens on the dinner salad, the perfectly prepared side vegetables and how great the food was, I knew it was a landmark, but didn't know it was like #3 of steak houses. I've been to Morton's, Ruth Chris, and Harris's, and you know I have to say, John's is the local downtown vibe, and feels festive and genuine. I've not been to the House of Prime Rib, but I can guess it is more \"stuffy,\" and boring. I'm reviewing it because I do eat at many good places but this old school experience earned throughout with worn chairs, was perfect for a change. I'm a jazz fan and The music made my night, too. I think I recognized a famous face and felt like this is a well loved local scene.

I went here during the holidays with some family and friends before a show. I chose this place because it was the only place that had a last minute reservation.  The restaurant was \"festive\" but VERY crowded - over crowded and cramped really, which is understandable for a touristy place on a Saturday night during the holidays in Union Square, but they held true to the reservation and seated us in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe service was slow on the uptake - we sat for a long time before even getting drinks in.  However, once we told them we were on a time restriction, our waiter was quick to pick up the pace.  One negative report, he forgot our appetizer order entirely and had to bring it at the last minute at the end of the meal.\n\nThe food was very overpriced for the poor quality of food.  It was \"fine\" but not worth the money.  I had the restaurant's famous OYSTERS WELLINGTON, which was actually not great - VERY greasy, and so flavoured with the bacon that there really wasn't a point of having the oysters in there. Just tasted like salty puff pastry that sat too long so that the puff pastry wasn't even crisp. Definitely not worth the price.  My friend had their also famous CHICKEN JERUSALEM, which I tasted, and that was actually deliciously tender; she cleaned her plate.  My sister had the Fisherman's Pasta, which she had no complaints about, but it didn't seem very special.  Her boyfriend just had side dishes, which were clearly nothing special or well-cooked at all.  Our appetizer ended up being the steamed clams, which were in NO WAY worth the price, considering how few clams were on the plate.  \n\nOverall we had a very wonderful evening, but that had very little to do with the food at this place. Maybe we should have had the steak?", "author": "Renee R."}

For those who like classic old SF recipes well-prepared and huge cocktails, John's and Tadich's Grills are always a delight. \n\nWe came on a Friday night at prime dining hour without reservations. We were able to get seated immediately on the second floor. The second floor atmosphere is a far cry from the first in terms of charm and space, but we still enjoyed it. If you're making reservations, I suggest requesting the first floor.\n\nThe above said, we had a great time. We ordered a caesar salad to split -- it was among the best I've had. Perfectly sized lettuce, delicious croutons, and the dressing was not creamy, but deliciously balanced between the vinagrette, anchovy, and lemon. And perfect for two people. My tablemate had the oysters wellington. Such dishes don't really appeal to my sensibilities - I prefer a clean steak or bit of fish, or maybe one of the decadent seafood casseroles a la Tadich's. But the oysters wellington was delicious - medallions of puff pastry stuffed wtih spinach, oysters, and a binding of rich cream sauce but not overly sauced. A very nice surprise. The deviled prawns were quite good - like an old style dish with a deceptively rich, very flavorful sauce. \n\nDinner was served with a very nice serving of al dente veggies and lots of fresh, crusty bread.\n\nJohn's Grill is excellent quality and the service was way above par in my opinion. The waiter described his favorite dishes with the utmost patience and was great at anticipating our needs, and did not rush us. I was impressed with this place - it is what it is, no nonsense and still proud of what it is. I would say this style of restaurant is not everyone's cup of tea, but I'm thrilled to have finally patronized this gem.", "author": "Roxmarie M."}

Although the clientele has changed, the ambiance and the food have not changed.  It's a true steak and martini kind of place. I always have a hard time deciding between the steaks and the chops.

I really enjoyed the baked potato and veggies that came with it. The wine list is prolific.

I traveled from Texas to visit family and I recommended this place because it is apparently a San Francisco institution.

After spending 3 day's at a MacWorld convention I thought I'd treat myself to a great meal. As I walked down Powell Street I passed by an officer and said \"I know you must know where a good place to eat a reasonably priced steak is around here\". He pointed right up the street to 120 Powell at 'Tad's Steak Restaurant' and said you can get a good steak for around 15 buck's (almost with a New York accent). So I went in that direction, before crossing Ellis St, being a good citizen looking both ways before I crossed the street, to my right 'John's Grill since 1908' caught my eye. It rang a bell for me, so I thought I'd peek in and it was the home of the movie 'The Maltese Falcon'. It's a little more spendi for my budget. But as a filmmaker, I couldn't help but want to sit in a room where Sam spade from the movie sat and be inspired by History. Why not spoil myself once in a while.\n\nI will say, as frugal as I am, I have a very sophisticated pallet for a great quality steak. My mom spoiled us with her restaurant sized indoor grill and teated us to a good T-bone or New York steak once in a while. Not to mention, we got our meat from cows my step dad's family had raised in Portland Oregon. So trust me, I know a good quality steak. I start out on a steak adventure very skeptical, that it will be near as good as what I have grown up to know. A great steak needs just salt and pepper. Sometimes a hint of butter and garlic. \n\nGoing in a fancy restaurant as a single female alone, isn't always a nice greeting. I was pleasantly surprised all the way around. The first thing I thought about when they sat me down and brought me bread and butter, was the great tasting San Francisco sourdough bread (my best friend in Alabama makes me bring her a loaf when I visit). Most restaurants have this chewy bread. Even if it's freshly made nothing compares to a SF sourdough bread crust. It has its own taste and texture. Even though there's a \"Sam Spade's Chops (Broiled lamb chops)\" on the menu, I had myself a nice Medium rare New York USDA Prime or Certified Black Angus, the finest available. Corn-fed in the Midwest, it is specially selected for the highest quality and naturally aged for maximum flavor and tenderness steak.  Yummy! Perfect flame broiled on the outside and rare on the inside. The flavor of the meat was superb, As I enjoyed live jazz filling the air. \n\n33 bucks for the steak includes seasonal vegie, a baked potato and roaming around the unofficial museum of San Francisco's rich History. On the walls are many famous people who have visited including the late Jack Lalanne who said my newest favorite quote \"The worst thing you can do to your body is not use it\". I sat across from the 1984 Olympic Torch. You know they have to know someone to have that. It's a different experience than going to a museum and observing, than actually sitting where films have inspired a part of your career. Before I left, I got my photo taken next to the Maltese Falcon and Emmy Award to inspire my next generation of filmmaking with a great meal underneath my belt and new technology to expand my horizon. \n\nA Superb Stake & The Maltese Falcon At John's Grill In San Francisco \n-By Stacy Poulos www.PostcardTravelers.com", "author": "Stacy P."}

Right before we all had to board ***seperate flights*** and head home we were hungry for some food so we headed to John's Grill. The food was good but I have to say the service was lacking. I left the table to use the restroom and when I came back the table had been completely cleared and I had not been asked if I was done. A portion of my meal I was looking forward to finishing was now gone.\n\nMy friends had accidentally left their credit card in the hotel room so I had to pay the entire bill on my credit card (I'm not a super rich guy). As I paid I asked the witress to wrap up the John's Grill glass I'd used when I ordered that special drink you guys made.\n\nShe informed me she'd given my glass to the people who I ate lunch with. I was stunned at this. They were flying out to another location. They were a couple - 2 people - and she had given them 3 John's Grill glasses. Why would you give two people all 3 glasses? This is after not allowing me to finish my meal...\n\nNeedless to say, I felt completely snubbed. She made no move to correct her error or even seek a manager. She is the one who gave away the glass to people who did not even pay the bill...\n\nThe food was tasty, but upon reviewing the service I have to say it was attrocious and I would probably think twice before I ever recommended any of my friends eating there, or going back again.", "author": "Chupacabra S."}

We were given a double wide window table for the two of us and appreciated the extra elbow room.\n\nOur personable and prompt server Michael brought our gin, beer and bloody mary in no time and did not rush us for the lunch order. We both ordered the clam chowder, Jack Lalanne salad (for the lady) and calves liver (myself)\n\nThe clam chowder is really more of a clam/potato bisque: creamy and rich without being gummy or starchy with very tender clams. The serving was most generous: a large soup plate for only $6.95.Very different style from other chowders I've had recently, but oh so good and sinful! 5 stars.\n\nThe Jack Lalanne salad $16.95 was good, 3 to 3.5 stars. The calves liver was done just right, medium rare, smothered with onions and several strips of crisp bacon, excellent mashed potatoes and a medley of zucchini and other squashes that were cooked just right - not too soft. This serving too was very generous and the price a most reasonable $14.95. As calves liver goes, this too earned 5 stars, and this is the rare restaurant that even has it on the menu.\n\nOverall I was surprised how reasonably priced the food and drink were, especially when one considers it is in the middle of the touristy Union Square area. Tanqueray gin/rocks (with two olives! cost $7, Tanqueray bloody mary $8, Sierra Nevada draft beer 5.50 and a glass of very nice sauvignon blanc $10.

We then asked to speak to the manager, we explained that this was my girlfriend's birthday and she wanted a glass of wine, I was to remain sober due to I was driving. The manager then told us that they wouldn't serve us anything because we appeared to have come in intoxicated, I explained to the manager that we were both sober, not one drop of alcohol had touched our lips. Still the manager refused to serve two perfectly sober customers. Now I'm not one to pull the race card, but was this all do to the fact that my now fianc\u00e9 is half African American and I'm Asian, and that we were enjoying each others company and were overly happy to be together hmmmm makes me think...

Additionally it's important to note that this joint is sporting some of that great classic early 20th century  San Fran architecture that, although aesthetically is very pleasing, leaves something to be desired in the comfort category.

Your first impression of this place on a busy night is undoubtedly horrible because the place is so packed with tables that they've got the host's desk literally against the door of the entrance. What this means is that when there are more than two people waiting, bodies spill all over - butts in the faces of diners and those who arrive are forced into the cold outside or in between the two sets of doors - BAD PLANNING! Despite this suffocating proximity to the host - he went back and forth between the dining room three times before even acknowledging our presence- no \"hey I'll be right with you\" or anything. Finally a server passing by welcomed us to the establishment.\n\nWe had to wait 20 min. for a table which was to be expected but at the bar there was again, zero room and we weren't even given a passing glance by the bartender for at least 5-6 minutes.\n\nOnce we got our drinks, got our table and were able to relax - the experience was great. Our server was attentive and kind despite a very full dining room - the food was outstanding and plentiful. They graciously split a salad for us and made other substitutions without attitude and didn't hassle us as we chatted away the night, drinking a bottle of wine we brought with us, long after our plates were clear.\n\nWith some minor space/service improvements I think this place could be somewhere I would frequent when I am in San Fran.", "author": "J.Nichole S."}

I ask the server not to leave and cut into one and show her gray and dry, not med rare. She asks me to check another. More gray cardboard. She removes them and returns soon with another plate of 5. She asks me to cut in and it is very rare but edible so I nod OK. The next one is perfect but 2 others are so raw that the meat looks blue.

THIS PLACE IS THE WORST PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN TO!..and I'm not exaggerating.  This historic hole in the wall has been around for 100 years, and I can't see why.  My guess is like others who have reviewed, in that it traps poor unassuming tourists, (and people like me) who get reeled in based solely on its history.   \n\nI had my first and surely my last experience of this dreadful place on Valentines Day.  The service is my number 1 complaint.  They just don't care.  Only after asking for my waitress did she suddenly appear.  When I asked her where our food was, she replied, \" You guys too a long time to order that's why.\"  What kind of answer is that?  I was furious, but hungry so I decided to let it go.  After a total wait time of 55 minutes our order came out.  The only problem was that it wasn't our order.  Completely wrong!!!!...  That was it, I got up and spoke to the manager, and told him of my experience.  \n\nTo all those out there who are thinking about going to John's Grill\n\nDONT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "author": "Jason S."}

The concierge recommended John's Grill as a good place within walking distance for oysters and cioppino.\nIt was indeed a welcomed short walk, having put many miles in earlier in the day.  We arrived about 6:15, party of two, and were seated right away but the place was packed.  \nThe tables are placed VERY close.  We love oysters and the oysters of the day were Blue Points.  They also advertised a nice salad menu, seafood, steaks and my desired ciopinno.  There was also a nice, reasonably priced wine list.  I was feeling pretty good about the choice.\nUnfortunately it all ended there.  We both ordered the oysters, DH ordered the house salad and steamed salmon and I ordered the caeser and ciopinno.  The table next to us was seated while we were waiting for our drinks.  The woman was sitting less than a foot away and wearing perfume so strong my eyes watered.  Then the oysters arrived.  I seriously question whether they were Blue Points.  They were about the size of a quarter, I wasn't feeling the love but then our salads arrived and they were actually pretty good.  Up to this point our waiter was fairly attentive but the place was really starting to get cranked.  Our main courses arrived.  My ciopinno was ultra bland with everthing but the scallops over done.  The waiter came by and I asked for more lemon and water.  DH dug in to his \"steamed\" salmon that was actually grilled to well done.  He is not a complainer, saying that the thicker parts were okay but he didn't eat the thinner parts.  I finished my wine and water and never received my requested lemon or refills on either wine or water.  \nNormally I would have taken a stand on such a poor experience but it was so crowded and the situation so ridiculous that I just wanted out asap.\nOur neighboring tables all ordered steak, since we were seated so closely there were no secrets and it was obvious that every singel table was unhappy with there over-done steaks.  I saw three steaks returned because they were not prepared properly. \nThis was such a disappointment.  We were in San Francisco on business and don't have the option of meal do-overs.  This one was a lost cause and not an inexpensive mistake.  Don't waste your time or money here.

The steaks are always done perfectly, the vegetables are fresh and the Woodford Manhattan is to die for! The selection is not all that broad, but it's more than adequate. The appetizers, the salads, the entrees, the steaks, the desserts are all what one is looking for at a grill. The clientele is eclectic, the wait staff is attentive, the prices are reasonable. \n\nOn our last visit we both had the Roquefort salad, which is very, very Roqueforty, I had the seafood cannelloni, my husband had John's steak.  The cannelloni was exceptionally tasty, the vegetables were crispy, the steak was done perfectly.  We ended up having a great time drinking with some Red Sox fans at the table next to us and the server was just fine with that.\n\nAfter all is said and done, this is one of my and my husband's favorite San Francisco restaurants.

I had a Jack Lalanne salad, which I thought was pretty tasty.  Supposedly there was some sort of blue cheese dressing, but I couldn't taste it.  For my main course, I ordered the filet mignon.  It seemed a little closer to medium than the medium rare I ordered, but that didn't bother me as much as the lack of seasoning.  The peppercorn sauce for the steak was pretty good and helped compensate for the lack of seasoning.  The steak came with a baked potato (you could choose between baked or mashed potato) and veggies (green beans, carrots, and squash).  I generally like my baked potato loaded with extra heart-attack-inducing fixings (butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon), but they only had butter and sour cream here.\n\nService was very friendly and attentive.  However, the restaurant was ridiculously cramped.  I could hardly squeeze into my chair without bumping into the people sitting at the table behind us.  The waitress could only access one side of the table, so she had to reach over me to do anything.  Basically, the seating arrangement here was the worst I have seen.

Unless you want to wait 20 minutes for someone to finally stop by to bring you a basket of bread and, semi-explicably, maraschino cherry stems take your order and disappear for another half hour. \n\nBesides the cherry stems (if you're going to combine cocktail toppings with bread and butter at least give us unused toppings) we eventually got drinks (The Bloody Bridgits are tasty yet tiny and firmly \"Girl Drink Drunk\" category) but, after a long wait, were informed they were OUT of hamburger buns. They offered us toasted bread. Toasted Bread. The irony was, moments before entering John's I'd mentioned going home to make burgers and had it shot down due to everyone agreeing that House Burgers suck. Primarily because they're served on regular bread. \n\nWe turned down the burgers but they brought them (late and on bread) and gave them to us gratis. And they were bad. Burnt (nobody ordered well done but that's what we got), with huge, unconquerable slices of onion. One of our team described it as \"the kind of burger someone might offer you at a tailgate BBQ that you'd politely take a bite of and then ditch on the way to your seats\". \n\nThe fries. Well, good french fries are not rocket science. This isn't a perfectly grilled steak or a carefully seasoned mole. French Fries for gods-sake. We're in John's Grill where they filmed the fucking Maltese Falcon and we get ruined and I mean not even high on weed edible ruined french fries? I cry. I weep. And the one little cocktail sauce dish of ketchup they gave us? Bitch, please. \n\nAnd don't be suckered in by \"Jack Lalanne's Favourite Salad\". It may sound marvelous but, it's really a fat plate of bland with enough blue cheese dressing to choke a French lumberjack. \n\nMinor kudos to the waiter for taking shit in stride, dealing with a lot of peanut gallery sniping from us (which I will not apologize for given we  received plenty of strong drinks but inedible food). \n\nEnough shit went wrong we were able to wrap things around from crappy to hilarious. However, this is not a justification for going. My recommendation would be to grab burgers at somewhere decent such as Taylor's Automatic Refresher then head here and do the bar.", "author": "Milk N."}

You are greeted by a doorman, and polite and professional  hostess's.  After that, serviced falls short very quickly.  Our waitress was not well versed with the wine selection, we were constantly tracking her down to order drinks, our water glasses were always empty and we had to ask for everything.

They made the drink without bitters, cherry or vermouth....rather a loutish drink if you ask me. My friend asked for a Gin Ricky. They had no clue what that was.... Now for some old time steeped in tradition bar this was clearly a rather shabby performance. Went upstairs to see the Hammett collection behind glass. Another cheap trick. The books in the display case were all current or recent editions. They couldn't even spring on a replica of the original Maltese Falcon. Very cheesy and cheapo.

I started out with a cocktail that seemed worthy of John's Grill: a Manhattan and something I never order, but the occasion called for a stiff, old school drink. I have no idea what to compare it to, but it was strong and good, complete with two cherries. \n\nI couldn't resist the Jack Lalanne's salad which was chock full of Dungeness crab and shrimp and was way overdressed, however, I'm a sucker for drowning my salad in creamy, caloric-heavy dressing, so I was happy. \n\nThe fisherman's pasta was a huge portion of linguine with salmon, crab, snapper, shrimp and clams bathed in a heavy cream sauce. It was way too much food and so rich due to the overflowing pool of cream sauce. For some reason I also opted for a side of the creamed spinach. There seemed to be an overly creamy theme at John's. \n\nAt the end of the overly rich, overly creamy meal, I found myself in a food coma and in need of a brisk walk around downtown SF. \n\nGreat place for a drink, but I think my dining days at John's Grill are over, however, I know where to go when I'm in need of a creamy meal.", "author": "Lee H."}

I've gone through its menu from the seafood to the steaks and while it was okay, its signature steaks of any cut have always been lacking in the top quality I've come to associate with true steakhouses worthy of the appellation.  Yeah, it's got all that history and that ambiance but for a restaurant, I'm more concerned about the food.\n\nThat said, I was here just last week for a solo Valentine's Day meal and sampled their Escargot with Garlic Cream and Roast Prime Rib.  I wasn't impressed with either.  A good escargot dish is cooked in a sauce redolent with the aromas of its ingredients.  The \"garlic cream\" tasted like a cream sauce with a hint of garlic and that's it. How disappointing!  Then the Roast Prime Rib, which I'd assumed to be carved off a huge chunk of roasted prime rib turned out to be a prime rib steak that had been sliced, then broiled in an oven.  There's a difference between the two:  The former is sliced off a bigger roast has the edges nice and crispy with the center red and juicy that's worthy of a true steakhouse  while the latter is brown all over and worthy of a ratty corner diner trying to cut costs yet fake out a customer into believing they're getting top quality product. And for $35???  Surely they jest for such subprime preparation quality!  Compare the pictures of what I ate with the pictures of Roast Prime Rib served by House of Prime Rib in San Francisco or Ben Benson's in New York to see how a true Roast Prime Rib should look like!!!  Service was spotty in that the waitress did go out of her way to make me a creamed horseradish sauce but she kept disappearing on me.  Finding her after the initial order submission was sometimes an exercise in frustrated head swiveling even though the third floor area was kind of small and there was a kitchen on the same floor so she couldn't have vanished into the kitchen (the door was open so I could see the chefs \"doing their thing\").  \n\nThis is absolutely appalling and a new low for John's Grill.  I don't think I'll be back after this--over the years of patronage, their food quality has just taken a nosedive right into the dirt and has just become nothing but a tourist trap.

It was absolute perfection! \n\nMy steak, on the otherhand, was very tough and would have been sent back were it not for the late hour and the fact that I was extremely hungry! I believe that when you pay thirtysomething dollars for a steak, you are entitled to a tender, flavorful piece of meat.

It feels like a place that is using it's history to draw in tourists rather then continuing to make great food to draw people in.\n\nI started with the Clam Chowder which was very good. The Porterhouse was cooked as directed but still seemed a little dry for some reason - thought the pepper sauce was quite good, use it sparingly though, you don't want to over power the flavor of the steak. The accompanying baked potato was over done and the vegetables (beans and carrots) were completely forgettable. For dessert I ordered the pecan pie, which i received after about a 20 minute wait. Unfortunately it was served cold - as in it might have just come out of a refrigerator. It first looked like a tiny slice, but it's pretty rich and I'm not sure if i would have wanted a much bigger slice anyway. The whipped cream that comes with it is fantastic though. \n\nAll in all it was an ok meal and the history of the place (including the Maltese falcon replica on the second floor) make it an interesting place to eat but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there and if I were going to a steak house you'd probably find me at Alfred's or Izzy's before you found me here.\n\nFor those watching your budget: soup, entree, dessert and wine will run you 50-60 per person before tax.", "author": "Russ C."}

Here it is useful as a metaphor for John's Grill. Just as Sam Spade discovered, this falcon is worthless lead.\n\nI had a Clam Chowder and a Caesar Salad after seeing entree prices that just looked way too high after a quick scan of the tables around me. Both were average and would have been fine in a diner for around $5-6 but priced too high at $9 and $10 respectively. Chowder was almost all cream, very few chunks of potato or clam. Salad very dull with no anchovies, few croutons (those out of a box) and black olives. The bread didn't seem that fresh. Table was tiny and so close to the one behind that chairs bumped. \n\nService was good, and that's the nicest thing I can say about the place. Ambience is not \"classy\" and noise level is not \"average\" but dress certainly is \"casual\".\n\nIf you're staying in town briefly, maybe in Union Square at a big hotel, then the prices of the food and the dress sense of your fellow patrons (lots of shorts, trainers and hats - people, this is not a sports bar) might be OK.

Alas, this meal was not so deserving.  \n\nA little background:\nI have a good mate from Belfast, Northern Ireland.  His parents and Auntie and Uncle came out here last year and wanted a solid \"meat and two veg\" meal.  I sent them to John's and they had a great time.   So good a time that they ate there at least twice in their 4 day trip.  That's how good it was.\n\nThey come back for my friend's wedding 10 months later and where do they want to go, now with even more relatives?  You guessed it, John's Grill.  Mate calls up and asks if they can make a reservation for 13, fully realizing this is a tall order.  \"No problem!\" is the reply.  So we show up at the appointed time to find...two tables (round) near each other.  Now realize this is an extended family that has come from a total of four different countries to be together.  They want to sit at the same damn table, but not wanting to rock the boat we just push them together into a \"8\" shape.  Okay, we got past that.\n\nMove on to ordering drinks.  Waiter screws it up and it takes 30 minutes to get the drinks right.  Another 15 minutes goes by until we can flag down a waiter that is willing to take our order.  We all order quickly enough as we have been there 45 minutes already and have memorized the menu by now.\n\nAnother hour rolls by.......\n\nFinally the food comes out.  My potato is hard as a rock from being under a heat lamp for god knows how long, the green beans are like smooshed worms, and my steak is cold.  When I say \"cold\" I don't mean, \"not piping hot\" I mean COLD.  As in, \"has been sitting on a counter and not under a heat lamp for over 20 minutes\".  And its not just my steak that's cold.  Its everyone's.  A total of 13 ruined meals.  \n\nWe call the waiter over and his response is, \"we only have one chef tonight, sorry\".  Then he walked away.  I raised the point that they seem to have plenty of waiters, and last time I checked its the waiters that bring the food, not the cooks.  Basically the food was rendered inedible, at least when you're paying over $30 a plate.\n\nWe complained again to a waiter whom called down to the front desk to the manager? owner? someone? who told us this gem: \"You have two options.  We can reheat the food, and you can pay full price, or you can leave, and we will still charge you full price.\"  Neither of these was acceptable to us.  We worked out a compromise in that we would pay for our drinks and appetizers (fine.  No argument there, we were prepared to do that all along), and we wouldn't be charged for the steaks.  No problem.  We even left a 20% tip as the waiters were actually really nice about it all.  \n\nMy friend and I went down to talk to the owner/manager guy personally, but when we got down to the first floor, we were informed by a waiter that the guy had immediately hung up the phone and ran (ran!) across the street to his car and drove away before we could talk to him.\n\nTalk about cowardly behavior.  The waiters all to a man told us that that is his standard procedure when faced with a dispute.  He gets in his car and goes off and hides for an hour or so until things cool down.  \n\nNow, is that any way to run a business?", "author": "Jake S."}

This spot is not on the same level as the Slanted Doors, or the Boulevard's or the Gary Danko's.  It is not swank or scenester.  The interior is dark old school (think Tadich, House of Prime Rib) and full of grandparents.  The menu hasn't been changed in 100 years.  The steaks are cooked in an old-fashioned style with the criss-cross grill marks.  The cuisine is buttery and hearty--not the place to come if you're on a diet.  There is a dust around the picture frames.  \n\nIf you consider yourself a real San Franciscan I would recommend eating here once, especially if you are a Dashiell Hammet enthusiast.  The dinner portions are huge, but their steamed clam appetizer is a great starter.  Probably their most famed dish is the John's Steak.   I had the Chicken Jerusalem (grilled and topped with mushrooms, artichokes and a creamy white wine sauce) which was fantastic.  \n\nOur service was great, though I felt a little rushed.

My friend and I wrapped our leftover pastas together and gave it to a homeless person while walking back to our hotel.

Nice decor inside and has a very retro feel to it. I tried the Caesar Salad which was average.  I was torn between a few items on the menu but the waitress said the lamb chops are what they are known for. Average at best. They were cooked to perfection but they were flavorless. Your better steak houses serve them crisp on the outside but these were soggy and lacked over all. If a place claims  a certain item is what they are known for then it better be good.

Those people are idiots. And here's why.\n\nWhen a restaurant has been around for 5 or ten years you can unequivocally say that it's successful. John's Grill has been around for 100 years. You don't stay in business that long unless you're awesome. I don't care if you're a restaurant or a hardware store. That kind of resilience through time deserves a nod. \n\nMy two favorite words when it comes to John's Grill (besides the name \"John's Grill\", I mean, come on, when you name a place, stamp it with something timeless. \"Frisson\"? WTF did that even mean? It's gone now of course. I could name other restaurants in the area with restaurant names that BLOW, but there's too many and I have to get back to work.\n\nAnyhow, two favorite words about John's Grill -- FILET MIGNON. Im a NY Steak kinda guy, pride myself on being able to put away a pound of steak in a matter of minutes while chasing it with a couple of Manhattans, but the filet mignon at John's is, what's the word I'm looking for? Oh yeah. PERFECT. Run, don't walk.\n\nThe service is excellent. No nonsense. Smiles. Of course we can prepare it that way for you's. You know, service like it's supposed to be? Service that you don't find any freaking where else in the city because every other place is too pretentious and snooty?\n\nBONUS: Frigging place is a setting in Hammett's Maltese Falcon. And if I have to explain what the Maltese Falcon is or who Dashiell Hammett is, move back to Boston. Please. \n\nI'll keep going to John's Grill for another hundred years. And guess what?

I had no idea of the history of the place...I liked the classic steak-house vibe.  They had classic crooners playing and it had a refined (though cramped) atmosphere. Dont go here if you require special assistance, or dont feel like climbing the stairs to the bathroom.\nBAR:  After sitting at the bar I thought an achorsteam draft beer would hit the spot. The friendly bartender pulled an unchilled glass from the rack and proceeded to fill it. The draft beer was only about 60 percent as cold as it needed to be...and the unchilled glass (no fine restaurant should serve beer in an unchilled glass) probably made it worse.  I broke my never complain rule and politely told the bartender about the warm beer. His excuse was that if beer was left in the lines overnight it could be higher in temperature. I sat there and wondered why warm beer left in unrefrigerated draft lin we s would be served to me in the first place. I suggested a chilled bottle anr he let me kbow he fould fetch one \"upstairs\". I expressed my remorse in him having to visit another floor to find cold beer but he insisted it wasnt a problem. He returned in 5 minutes with bottlesbof anchorsteam.  Since he didnt have any chilled glasses....he improvised by filling a pint glass with ice and water  and waited...prior to dumping the mixture in to the now cold glass. Whew! A cold beer! Halefrickinleiuya.  Lol. Imagine the time savings that could be gleaned by fixing the tap system and refrigerating some pint glasses. If you love beer, you are completely feeling m3 right now.\n\nHere's where it gets weird.  Same bartender is working in the bar sink and I hear the sound of a shattered bar glass. When I worked in a restaurant...if a glass broke in the sink...or God forbid the ice container....the sink would need to be meticulously cleaned out and toweled dry to ensure every shard of glass was removed. If yoy have ever broken a glass...you know that there are large fragments, small fragments, and pieces you can barely see.  This bartender removed 2 large broken pieces of glass from the sink andbwas back serving in seconds.  So...the bar...was a failure.  Bartender was polite...but beer was warm...beer pints were served unchilled and I had concerns over the broken glass which...in my opinion...was not addressed in a way that made me feel like EVERY precaution was taken to ensure the safety of the patrons.\n\nChowder was excellent.", "author": "Chris C."}

Why steal the Falcon!\n\nWhen we first moved here the first destination stop was John's Grill as my collection of Humphrey Bogart movies is now missing two.  (this is a complete nerd feet considering how many movies Mr. Bogart made) and we have a healthy collection of Dashielle Hammet books ourselves. \n\nWe also have a Maltese Falcon I got my man from Metro Golden Memories in 1986 as a birthday present.  Wrapped it in newspaper and twine and had my friend drop it at his feet at a party.\n\nSo of course the first eatery we went to here was John's Grill.  We were in the Falcon room.  Your best bet when you go there is to make a reservation because it is a landmark place that gets crowded (you can make reservations on line too) and there is literally not a wait and you get a good table.\n\nFor an actor going into a place that touted actor and writers hanging out there once upon a time?  The prices now are so not for actors. For an artist, this is a once or twice a year thing.\n\nBut it is worth it.  The steaks are prime cut and tender.  The pasta dishes are creamy and rich.  That chocolate mousse cake they have.  It is sex on a plate.  The wines are top quality.  \n\nAnd I had a cocktail that was so strong?  I honestly had to be a touch ghetto and water the thing down.  That is not a bad thing honestly.  Because how often do you have to *water down your own drink*  :)\n\nThe last time we went was for our anniversary lunch/dinner Sunday Feb 18th 2007.   Made the reservation on line Thursday.  Was reminded on Saturday via email, got a phone call from the restaurant at noon saying the Falcon room was not open (because some jackass stole the falcon.

I will say that the steak was without a doubt one of the best that I have ever had, but the rest of the food was average, to midland.\n\nI haven't had a steak that tasted that good in a long, long time.  They could have added chives and cheddar cheese to the baked potato, which was otherwise just average.  The wine was decent, but again pricey for what you get.  For as much as we paid for that place, I would have expected more trimmings with the baked potato, and perhaps some more veggies to go with the steak.  Oh, and as for the bread that they gave us to munch on before our meal, I have to say that I don't like the hard crust.\n\nOverall:  If you don't mind eating a fabulous steak in a cramped environment, with mediocre service for the price, then this place is for you.

It was about 8:30 and the place was packed. It looked old school and had lots of famous celebrity photos up all over the place and only a 20 minute wait for a table for four, so we went for it. The host at the reservation desk was a little snooty, but we got seated in less than the twenty minutes he originally quoted us, so it was fine. We got a really great table upstairs by the front window, and the atmosphere up there was amazing. The tables are very close together, which ordinarily would be annoying, but here it just adds to the cozy atmosphere. They had live music, which was great, as well. The service was just okay. Someone else described it as \"sloppy\", which I think is a good way to say it. Not terrible, but for the price and the atmosphere, I expected better. The food, for the price, was just average. My Roquefort salad was just okay, and my seafood fettuccine was not hot. If I said it was warm, that would be generous. The seafood tasted average, and there were some mushrooms in it that were underdone. My husband had surf and turf, and it was just 'eh. The kids had fried shrimp and New York steak. The steak looked decent, but the shrimp looked mediocre and the baked potato was nothing special. The bread at the beginning of the meal was the best part. Yummy sourdough! Our drinks were exceptionally overpriced. We paid like over $40 for two diet cokes and two Shirley temples! That was insane, I thought.

Thai is typically disappointing, and we were cranky that eve).\n\nWe came in and were promptly seated, but it was late on a Sunday night so I did not expect anything other than that.

It's such a cool place, the Maltese Falcon connection, the old movie photos, and what I think is the look and feel of a timeless San Francisco restaurant serving American food.   I was excited to go, we had reservations and that was good because this restaurant is jam packed with people spilling out the front door.  The service is attentive and friendly - from the door, to the hosts and our server and serving assistants - they  absolutely  treated us well.   Our smiling adorable waitress is why this has two stars and not 1, she was lovely, and the only saving grace to this experience.  The food is average, the prices are terribly high, the noise level is unbearable, and the way you are packed into the dining areas is a nightmare.  There is live music there, a jazz pianist and although this genre of  music adds to the ambiance and flavor of John's - they've set the pianist up right next to tables, and also amplified the music overhead at a high level, making ordinary conversation  impossible.  Dinner companions need to shout at one and another from 2 feet away.  Not a good place for a date unless you hate each other.  It's easier to talk to the diners seated near you, than to your own date across the table.   I noticed several men dining alone there, and it looks like a good place for a traveling business person to dine alone, since talking was not an option.  The guest seated next to us actually left before his order was served because the noise was overwhelming to him.    The food is OK, and I liked it, (Fillet, Chicken Jerusalem) but didn't love it; as another reviewer wrote, it was bland, needed much seasoning, and there wasn't anything to stand out and make me feel good about spending so much money.  We were in and out of there so quickly, no way I was going to have dessert.   I really couldn't leave fast enough, I felt like if I wanted to enjoy my evening without my head exploding, it wasn't going to be there.  I think that may be the method to this madness.  Get people in and out, turn the tables, make the money, and move onto the next group of diners impressed with the promises of a peek into the San Francisco of years past.    Great service, awful atmosphere.  John's is such a unique place, and one that warrants diners staying and exploring the wall photos and memorabilia, drinking in the period furniture and historic qualities, and yet I feel like they drove us out of there by design.", "author": "Kris K."}

(let's just say a few years now).  One of the old San Francisco restaurants, it hasn't changed a bit, which I love!  It has that classic SF feel.  Small and long, there is more seating upstairs, although I've never sat up there.  The wait staff is always very attentive.  If you order certain drinks, it comes with the John's Grill glass.  Of course, this was a lot cooler when I was 10.\n\nI will admit, the food is not 5 stars, but neither are the prices.  They are higher than other places, but mostly because John's is located in tourist central (union square).  The burgers, the fried calamari, the john's special all solid very filling meals.  \n\nIf you're looking for a traditional SF restaurant where the food is good, this is your place.

We were seated immediately at a table for two. Our order was taken within 10 minutes of being seated and our drinks were brought to us promptly. We were immediately captivated with the nostalgic feel of the place. Not knowing the history of the place our imagination ran a muck! We ordered Oysters on the half shell for out appetizer. They were some of the freshest oysters we have had, my boyfriend rated them quite highly. He is from the Seattle area and has had his share of them. We ordered the filet, medium rare and the halibut with the intentions of sharing. Can I just say the filet was cooked to perfection and it was fork tender and very tasty. The halibut was grilled and moist on the inside with this mushroom caper sauce that was to die for! The bread was very good but I do agree that the butter in the foil is a little cheesy for image that they are trying to portray. The service was good and our overall experience was very nice. I have been to some very nice steakhouses having lived in Las Vegas for 18 years, the quality of food was very good. The restaurant was very quaint and filled with history...if those walls could talk!  We got out of there for just over $100 and that's with 2 rounds of of imported beer!

Despite that, John's Grill is a Union Square institution as a site used in the filming of the Sam Spade classic with Humphrey Bogart, the Maltese Falcon. They even have the falcon on display upstairs.Over the years, I have eaten here maybe a half dozen times. In each case, I have been happy, receiving good service and a reliably good meal. I think the most common item ordered at John's is one of the 8 or so steak or chop choices. The only real negative is that it is a bit pricy. Prices are definitely $$$ and reflect that John's receives a fair amount of tourist trade in the Union Square area. Other menu items worth trying are the clam chowder, the big salad for two, and the petrale sole. The wine list is pretty decent and provides enough range for most diners. John's Grill, like Tadich Grill on California, just keeps trucking along.", "author": "Robert H."}

We started with the dungenes crab app. For $17 it really was delicious and fresh, though I could have done without the ketsupy sauce on top. We ordered the chef's special red snapper expecting really fresh snapper only to find a somewhat battered (maybe with flour) fish-stick tasting fish. The veggies to meat/potato ratio was way off and the sauce was more of a gravy with mushrooms and crab/frozen shrimp. The fish was basically inedible and save the gravy sauce I would have just sent it right back and walked out. The menu was not exciting and this place really isn't worth the money OR your time with so many better restaurants in SF. the service also left something to be desired. Didn't refill our drinks or offer another glass of wine. The only great thing there was the bread, and even then after having eaten at Boudins earlier-it was a stretch.

I suppose now's a good time then any other.   How we came about ending up in SOMA at 8:00 PM on the day before Christmas Eve, don't even ask.  My sisters were with me and so we decided since we were in the area we'll check up on some Christmas shopping and try some new places to eat.  One of my sister's was aching for some seafood and and the other beef.  I didn't have a preference but anything that tastes good and greasy.  As we were making out way back to the park structure we found John's Grill.  They had everything that we wanted to eat so we stepped in and the hosts seated us immediately.  Gave us our menus and got us some bread while we were deciding what to get.  I browsed through the menu the first thing I noticed was price ($$$) so I figured that if I'm spending this much I better have good portions and really good food.  While browsing I decided on their Chef's Special Red Snapper .  My sisters on the other had decided on Prime Porterhouse Steak and Chicken Jerusalem.\n\nThe waitress came back and we gave her our orders and while we waited for the food we were admiring their Holiday decor.  Very nice and homely you can say - great place to bring your other half here and enjoy the evening.  While we admired, the waitress filled out drinks up again and gave us more bread.  15 minutes later, our dishes arrived and boy was it looking good.  The Chef's Special Red Snapper dish was just smothered with butter, crab meat, and shrimp.  Just looking at the dish made me salivate and full already.  My sisters dishes looked divine as well - great portions on sides and main dishes.  After ah-uh's we started eating, Sea Bass was like heaven flowing on Cloud 9 and the Prime Porterhouse Steak and Chicken Jerusalem was just so succulent.  Refills on the drinks just kept on coming - I think I finished my usual 3 cups of AP if not more... \n\nFinal review, funny how I was the one ending up getting the Seafood.  I would recommended coming here if your not too worried about the overall cost.  Good times!!!", "author": "Kong Y."}

Last night, Better Half took me to John's Grill for dinner before heading off for a show at the Rrazz Room.  We made a reservation earlier in the day in person.  We mentioned at that time how we like the front window - and a large table there was waiting for us when we returned.  I wasn't overly hungry so I passed up my usual rib-eye steak (the best - juicy and perfectly prepared) for the house salad (delish mixed greens and veggies topped with loads of bay shrimp), filet mignon (perfectly cooked - juicy in the middle and not dry at all on the charred outside), baked potato with skin thicker than anywhere else I've eaten, and string beans (very crisp-tender).  BH had red snapper with a sauce that included shrimp and crab, and was superb.  Drinks were outstanding, as always, and service was professional without being snooty.  John's Grill, to me, is the ultimate traditional San Francisco restaurant.  I can't believe it only has three stars on Yelp.

We started off by ordering the clam chowder and cesar salad. The clam chowder had a potato to clam ratio of about 10:1 and the cesar salad was so salty that it was virtually inedible. We had already ordered our main course and figured, \"well, we already ordered, so we might as well stay and give the food a chance right? WRONG!\" I ordered the fried oysters and not only were they oily, they smelled like they have been a few days old. I'm sorry, but I won't eat old oysters. My Mom ordered the crab ravioli, but she mentioned that the taste of crab was lacking. Not only that, but the ravioli's were completely drenched in sauced. (It looked a bit like the clam chowder we had earlier to be honest.) My Dad, being a huge steak lover, ordered a steak and told them to cook it medium rare. The meat was really tough and overdone and had very little seasoning. When we received the check we were blown away by the price. I am fine with paying a little more for good quality food, but this is unacceptable. We ended up eating a slice of pizza at Blondie's down the street because we were so unsatisfied with our meal.

I was game...since he was picking up the tab.  Sure enough, we got there and they had a large table waiting for us.  The place is deceivingly small-looking.  There's actually 3 floors, so while the 1st floor doesn't look like they can handle a crowd, they actually can, and do, especially at nite when they have live jazz upstairs.  While I would've like to have tried one of the steaks, I opted for something healthy...the Jack LaLanne salad.  It fit the bill perfectly.  Fresh greens (no iceberg lettuce), sliced avocado, tomatoes chunks, mushrooms, bay shrimp, and chunks of fresh dungeness crab.  It was delish!  I should have stopped at half the bowl.  The lunch steaks didn't look that expensive at about $22 for a rib-eye.  My co-horts indulged on the same salad as well as  some of the pasta dishes.

We never waited for anything from the fantastic oysters as appetizers, to main courses that were served perfectly timed in between  drinks and soup and all the bread and other stuff.  Nothing was sub-par as far as quality. Yes it is a \"famous  place'  due to the Maltese Falcon, but go there because of the food. I sampled  everything from my friends dinners, as we were all curious, and everything was very good. Even the plates I don't care for, like New York strip (it was very tasty an exceptionally tender). It was very crowded, but we were not rushed, and  the place has terrific atmosphere. Initially I did not want to go there but am very glad we did. We even bought some souvenir glasses. There are a lot of bad  restaurants in the Union Square district, and this is sort of touristy due to the Maltese Falcon deal, but if you want an upscale  quality place to have a very good dining experience, go here! I will definitely go again. And as I live here and have for  some time, I rarely eat at Union Square other than Sears, but that is a different type of  restaurant). This place is excellent.

When we asked him to suggest a bottled of wine, he said the house and then could not tell us anything about it.  We had to ask multiple times for Lemon and Steak sauce by catching him as he walked by our table.  \n\nWe split the house speciality salad which was okay, despite being very over dressed and finding lots of crab shell.  The bread was stale.  My friend had the Ribeye, which was over done and tasteless.  He took it home for the dog.  I had the prawns, which were not fresh and fishy tasting.  I was only able to eat two because they were that bad.  The sauce they were swimming in tasted like a stick of butter had just been melted and thrown in with some mushrooms.  It was awful!

Their pecan pie was delicious!!! \n\nOur waitress was really nice and friendly. The place has this elegant/classy decor. I could tell people around me was having a good time, too.

The prawn cocktail was sizable and cooked perfectly, however the cocktail sauce tasted like ketchup. My filet mignon was done well and was good. The asparagus was soggy and the hollandaise sauce was salty. Vanilla bean ice cream was excellent as was the berry dessert. The pecan pie around the sides tasted really dry untill you got to the middle and it was moist and good. For such an historic restaurant, the first floor atmosphere  was blah and dark and we sat by the window. Walking up to the second floor bathroom, the dining room was beautiful. We did not have a reservation and maybe that is where you sit with a reservation. I believe that is what I overheard the hostess saying. All in all a mediocre dining experience and not worth the money. There are many other dining options in the area which are better.", "author": "Ryan D."}

We were seated on the third floor where I can only assume that the new servers are trained. This is the only reason I can think of why we would have such HORRIBLE service. Our server could not remember who ordered what, addressed the ladies at the table as girls and rudely interrupted conversations for no good reason. To top it off, at the end of the meal we were commanded to basically either order dessert or get packing because the kitchen was closing... At 9:30 on a Saturday night? Really? It's obvious that the server saw a party over 6 and knew his gratuity would be included so there was absolutely no reason to try and do his job in any respectful manner. \n\nAs for the food: pretty much everyone ordered the filet cooked from either medium rare up to medium well. I assume that the server guessed which ws which as they came out because no one got what they wanted and the \"medium well\" looked like straight hamburger. The cold steaks are served with cold green beans and an undercooked baked potato with nothing on it. We had to ask for butter and/or sour cream. No chives, no bacon and oh yeah... It was cold just like everyhing else. One girl ordered the halibut and I applaud her for even taking a bite. I am very weary of iffy looking seafood. \n\nAs we were leaving, my friend ripped her new sweater on the broken chair. When she informed the waiter he told her that she should write the owner to have him pay for it. No apology, no nothing.

I went to the Historic Johns Grill, open since 1908 and the home of the Maltese Falcon. When I arrived at the three-story building at 63 Ellis I learned from the host that it is one of the oldest and most famous establishments in San Francisco. Funny thing is, every time I have looked down Ellis (between Stockton and Powell) I have wondered what it was like inside because of the HOT location and traditional red awning...reading steaks, seafood, and cocktails.\n\nThe host was extremely friendly and with a beautiful smile he asked us where we would like to dine. We told him it did not matter. He suggested the upstairs where the guitar player would be and we agreed. As we walked through the restaurant, I noticed the plethora of past customers and celebrities covering the walls inch by inch. It was amazing...so many faces and names from Hillary Clinton to Clint Eastwood. We were escorted through a full house on the first floor to the second, which is known as The Maltese Falcon Room. The room is in honor of Author Dashiell Hammeett who used Johns Grill as a setting in his book. I also learned that Johns Grill is a National Literary landmark. I did not get a chance to see the third floor but maybe I can hold a private party there hmm  The furniture was totally original and from The old San Francisco. It provided an exquisite atmosphere to dine in. The host informed us of the specials for the evening before he departed our lovely table. Shortly after our waiter came over and asked us what we would like to drink and if we had any questions about the menu.\n\nCyril ordered the special house drink called the Bloody Brigid which came in a souvenir glass and it tasted SO delightful. Rene had a beer and I had a Bay Breeze. We started off with the Jumbo Prawns and Dungeness Crab Cocktail ($10.95). The nice sized portions came in the most adorable silver I have ever seen. The seafood was fresh and tasty. We also ordered a bowl of the New England Clam Chowder ($5.95) which I HIGHLY recommend. The soup was so splendid, it melted in my mouth and I groaned after every spoon full. For a salad we ordered the Seafood Florentine ($15.95) for two. The salad consists of fresh spinach, crab, shrimp, and special dressing. The dressing was light yet creamy, it was the perfect combination.\n\nFor our main course I ordered the Broiled Swordfish ($21.95) and they each ordered a steak (Filet Mignon ($26.95) and New York Cut Steak ($24.95). The slab of meat was the perfect size sitting next to a baked Idaho potato. The fish and steaks were just so full of flavor! To top it all off after unbuttoning my pants we had the White Chocolate Cheesecake ($5.95), Carmel Flan, and coffee. It was so yummyevery bite had my approval. The meal was just TO DIE FOR! It was absolutely the best meal I have hadmy mouth is still watering! The secret is out, Johns Grill is the MOST PHABULOUS place to go for steaks and seafood in the city!", "author": "Tamara M."}

Porterhouse steak was just the right consistency - not overdone - with some life left in it still (ordered medium-well) flavorful throughout. Appreciated the generosity on the sour cream for the baked potato - and even the side vegetables were not overdone. Chocolate mousse dessert was very very good with the right selection of fruit sides without overdoing it. Espresso was flavorful - not burnt.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-05-09", "description": "My husband and I decided to be spontaneous and wander around San Francisco to find a hidden gem of a restaurant for our anniversary dinner. When we walked past this restaurant, a gentleman outside handed us a menu and asked if we wanted to come in for dinner. We had been wandering for awhile so this seemed like fate. The place does look like a nice anniversary dinner spot inside. Dark, intimate, fresh flowers on the table, and a romantic atmosphere. Except for the strong rotten fish odor that nearly knocks you out before you can sit down. Our waiter brought us cold, disgustingly sour sourdough bread with a very tough crust. The butter was frozen and would not spread, nor did it taste good. I thought those little foil wrapped bars of butter were only served in back alley truck stops in the middle of hick town. The waiter made no suggestions when he saw I was struggling to make a decision on a drink from the wine list. He huffed off. When he came back, he had a poor attitude. My husband ordered the bloody something or other signature drink. It was gross. I ordered the pomegranate cosmopolitan and after a 20 minute wait, my husband asked the waiter what happened to my drink and the waiter said they had to go get more pomegranate juice. Thanks for telling me that sooner, you know, I think for a $10 drink, you could at least let me know what's going on. The alcohol in the drink was a disaster! The alcohol made my lips, mouth, throat, and stomach instantly turn into a pit of fire. Even the slice of lime was a disgrace, more like a little square chunk. How do you screw up a lime slice so badly? FOR TEN BUCKS???? I tried a second drink and the fire only burned worse. I ordered the filet mignon, which came with a potato that was burnt on the outside and undercooked on the inside and a pile of practically uncooked, untrimmed green beans that had sharp edges perfect to cut your mouth with! Mixed in with the awful green beans were two little pieces of flavorless, but perfectly steamed carrots. The steak was rather good and had some good flavor. My husband and I both ordered our steaks medium well, but mine was pink and slightly bloody and his was a grayish brown color inside. Overall, really a horrible experience. The dinner has ruined my anniversary and my feelings towards San Francisco. My husband and I have never eaten a $100 dinner together before because, quite frankly, a dinner doesn't need to cost $100 to be delicious. How can I not be mad that we spent $100 (the bill was $94 and change for 2 steaks and 2 drinks, the waiter got the change from the $100 for his tip) to eat the worst meal of our lives on our anniversary no less? This is the smallest tip I have ever left anywhere and I don't feel guilty because the waiter was rude. Everyone working there was very unprofessional. Arguing, whistling at each other, no courtesy, smacking each other with towels, and I heard one waitress arguing with a customer because he was complaining about his $10 cocktail being awful! We wanted to send our food back, but since the staff so unprofessional we chose not to. I would rather be stuck with undercooked food than eating green beans that got stomped on and spit on! Oh and let me add, the glass that my cosmopolitan was served in was a disaster and kept spilling all over the place. This restaurant was so bad I don't even want to come back to San Francisco ever again.", "author": "Phylicia B."}

But upon arriving last evening at about 3-4 minutes till 10 (their closing time) and standing at the front door to be seated for  a number of minutes then having a female server stare at us at the front door and yell across the room, 'We're closed!\" was not cool. You see darling, when you do that to a good customer it makes me think less of your establishment. I'm sure you were in a hurry to get home but you still had a good number of patrons in your restaurant. And call me stupid but I thought if you're open til 10 PM that means we can be seated and enjoy a meal if we arrive just before by several minutes. The right thing to do would have been to seat us and serve us. Yelling across the restaurant over customers is something they do in a hamburger joint. Shame on you. Management you need to give her a refresher course on proper etiquette. As I recall she was rather plump in disposition. That's the one there. The one who came off as lazy, unprofessional and with an attitude problem. Oh, last night I walked across the street to enjoy a terrific filet mignon at the jazz restaurant.

John's is always doing wonderful civic duty as home to the unique celebration of the 1906 earthquake, home to The Media Excellence Awards (Pubbies) and a host of other great and worthy causes.  They are also home to one of the greatest PR maestro's still creating headlines and long lines for the food, drink and experience only John's Grill can provide.  They do a lot of dishes really great, and one of my favorites is Petrale Sole with lemon, garlic and parsley gently grilled and a generous portion, perfectly served and accompanied by a wide choice of vegetables and starch, go for their fries or roast potatoes.  My other favorite, you can't go wrong with anythinbg here, is their collosal burger, huge, cooked to order with a great bun, fixin's and fries.

Our server was over right away and was extremely knowledgeable about the wines and the menu ( I think his name was Dirk or Drake I can't quite recall). We started with two of their specialty cocktails the Pear Martini and the John Daly. Delicious. We then ordered their famous Jack Lalanne salad which was packed with crab and shrimp. After the salad our server recommended a fantastic bottle of Pinot to go with our dinner. For dinner my girlfriend had the Cioppino and I had the Lamb Chops. The cioppino was excellent and loaded with fresh seafood in a delightful marinara broth. My chops were mouthwatering, they were served along with the traditional tomatoes and spinach. We were so full we decided to skip dessert even though the ones we saw brought to other table looked very nice.

The interior is filled with original period furnishings and authentic memorabilia, and the dark oak-paneled walls are covered with photos of well known patrons like Lauren Bacall, George Lucas, and Hillary Clinton. Over the years, the kitchen has resisted experimenting with nouvelle cuisine, so the menu is heavy with simple preparations of steaks, chops, and grilled or broiled seafood. A favorite is Fisherman's Pasta, linguine with salmon, crab, snapper, shrimp, mussels, and clams in a basil cream sauce. Desserts are very basic; the best is probably the New York cheesecake, served with a berry sauce that changes with the seasons. Dinner entree prices range from $18.95 - 29.95; the lunch menu is less expensive and actually more extensive.

When we went last year we thought it may have been an off night as the food was average. Last night...what a disappointment. I dont know if the current chef just doesnt know how to cook many things or the economy has left them with the ability to purchase only so many ingredients because the menu selection was pitiful. When we started coming 15 years ago, it was amazing. The Jack Lalannes Favorite Salad was to die for and it was huge! Last night when my wife ordered the Jack Lalannes Favorite Salad the portion was smaller than when we used to split a single order. This establishment used to be in the league of other iconic restaurants in San Francisco such as the Tadich Grill on California and Scomas on the wharf. In my opinion this iconic establishment has let San Francisco down. I used to feel very confident letting friends know what a fine enjoyable place this was to eat. The Salmon (since it was one of a hand full of choices) was marginal at best. You go to Scomas or Tadich Grill and you have so many choices it is hard to make up your mind. The service was also deplorable. They did not even serve us San Francisco sourdough bread with the meal or offer ground pepper with the salad. When they brought the check we had our check and some other tables check in with ours. I am so sorry to say that we would have been better off eating at any number of the walk in places in Union Square and that at this point I will never go back again.

I ordered the Fisherman's Pasta, which was presented beautifully and came in a large portion with generous amounts of seafood. In most cases, there's lots of pasta, but hardly any seafood, whereas, this dish contained a wonderful amount of both. The sauce was surprisingly flavorful and all the mussels, clams, and fish were cooked to perfection. Our waiter was very attentive and genuinely nice. He knew exactly when to take our plates away and we got instant refills without a word.

We were told our table would be about a 20 minute wait, so we opted to have a drink at the bar first. We ordered gin and tonics - a simple drink to make. They came without limes. When we requested limes 4 shriveled slices were presented to us by the barman on a crumbled napkin. This gesture raised eyebrows from several patrons at the bar, but we let it go. The drinks were over powering - no tonic at all. Everything was downhill from here. Our table was ready in the time alloted - upstairs in a corner right next to a bin of dirty dishes. We told the staff we would wait for a better table which even the waiter said he would not accept. Finally, once seated downstairs a male waiter asked us what we wanted to eat. Not welcome, may I take your order - what do we want to eat?!! Geez, no style at all. We didn't even have menus yet - we had to ask. We also had to ask for water which never came. We settled on filet mignon and a baked potato. They were so bland and uninteresting - almost tasteless. The beans were barely cooked and barely warm like the steak. it was like cafeteria food only MUCH more expensive. Please, please don't get sucked into the hype of this restaurant - it was very disappointing.", "author": "Carolyn W."}

We arrived at the height of the dinner rush, 7:30-ish and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. Ok, we'll wait. Barely 5 minutes later we were seated. Unlike the experiences of some other Yelpers, our table was quite comfortable and we were not at all crowded. This place screams early 20th century San Francisco. It's old and rickety and has a really awesome atmosphere inside. If you're turned off by that, as apparently alot of people are, you may not dig it too much. We enjoyed it alot, chuckling all the while about the flickering lights due to the 100+ year-old wiring in the building. As for the food, all 4 of us in our party cleared our plates with no problem. So good. We even managed to polish off a couple of desserts, and enjoyed the cocktails very much. The service was excellent, the food was excellent, the company was great. No complaints at all.", "author": "K H."}

We were starving, the concierge at their hotel recommended John's Grill, so we headed over. Big mistake. The first problem was trying to get in the place- there was this huge crowd of people who were all trying to eat there too. Once we got in, it took a few minutes just to flag someone down who works there. The restaurant is cramped and claustrophobic. The stairs are not ideal for starving customers who were served chardonnay but no food. Anyway- we were finally seated and someone took our orders. We ordered a salad for my 8 year old daughter, another salad for 2 of us to share, and fish for all of us. The salad to share came after about 20 minutes, but my daughter did not get her salad. So 2 of us ate salad, while the rest of us just sat there with nothing to eat for 45 minutes, other than some stale bread. We ordered some chardonnay to pass the time, which actually did come. Finally we cancelled our orders and left, at which point we were billed $60 for a couple of glasses of chardonnay and some salad. We won't bother going back.", "author": "Wendy S."}

As soon as we walked in, the first thing I noticed was the smell. I asked my culinary elitist friend if she smelled it, and she replied, \"Yeah, it's called kitchen.\" We were seated next to the kitchen, so there was a lot of foot traffic and general commotion around our table. Our server was pretty cool: he checked on us a lot and kept our water glasses full. He even tried to help us sell a pair of Giants tickets to the staff members, but no one had that particular day off to go to the game. I didn't have much of an appetite so I just had the house salad, and my friend had the filet mignon. The food was good but not great. I wanted to give one star but we had a great server and we got a free arm-wrestling show, which helped lighten the mood. I doubt I'd come back, unless they seat me upstairs, far away from that gross smell. But then again, I think I'd rather spend my money at Morton's.", "author": "Alani F."}
