The ambience Corridor emits almost pairs well with the food and service.\n\nI do knock a bit off of service. Not for the fact the the servers are bad, it just seems like the restaurant is stretched very thin. It took about 15 minutes before I was handed a menu, even more to place an order. Workers are scrambling about and it unfortunately created an experience leaving more to be desired.\n\nTo begin my meal, I started off with the popular monkey bread. These are mostly ready-to-bake and it reflects on the texture. A stale and oily bread is what you mostly get. There is some good flavor here, unfortunately the raison d'etre simply falls short of average.\n\nThe meatballs were another unsatisfying plate. When one orders meatballs, especially if it's the item's namesake, one expects a hearty amount of protein. The plating literally hides the meatballs. There's cheese slices, basil, and croutons (why??). Then again this might be because they are hiding the meatballs sad and frozen flavor.\n\nMy main course was actually great. I got the Green Garlic Pesto Campanelle. The pesto flavor really was the star and the details of flavor elevated the plate to a surprising level, given the past plates performance.\n\nI ended my meal with an okay dessert, 'Nilla Pudding Tart. I don't know what I was tasting. There's just a big scoop of mush and taking one bite you don't really taste much from it. You'll either get small hints of chocolate or a strong force of peanut butter. The dish just seemed lost and confused.", "author": "Vinh T."}

Since Corridor was close by, I made a dinner reservation about a month and a half prior through OpenTable for Wednesday, March 21st at 5:45pm. We were seated upstairs at a table in the corner.\n\nThey have a $5 happy hour, Monday through Friday, 3pm - 6pm. It applies to draft beer, wines by the glass, and cocktails. And you can still take advantage if you are sitting at a table. So go ahead and make a reservation if you want to guarantee yourself a seat. Since my gf was running late, I got myself a glass of Sparkling: m bonnamy brut, loire valley, france nv (regularly $10), and her a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon: vinum 'the insider', paso robles, ca 2014 (regularly $12). During dinner I switched to the cab as I'm more of a red wine girl. I believe my gf had one more while I had two more glasses. Too bad HH didn't go until 7pm, as it would have been great if they were still $5 each.\n\n*Little Gem Lettuces: crispy bacon, avocado, dijon vinaigrette, herb crisp ($13)\n*Asparagus Risotto: black truffle butter, button mushrooms, parmesan cream ($15)\n*Herb-Crusted Pork Porterhouse: creamy farro, glazed fall root vegetables, mustard jus ($24)\n\nMy gf and I shared everything, so I thought this was a good sampling of things. I adored the risotto. So creamy. And that truffle aroma and flavor. So good! The salad was tasty as well, but I found the vinaigrette a little one note. I kind of wished they offered us fresh ground pepper for contrast. Instead of the pork porterhouse, we actually got the loin and rib. I believe the preparation was still the same though. Same price as well. The pork was cooked nicely. Flavorful and tender. The rib was a little drier though as the meat was tough.\n\nFun place for HH and dinner before going to a show. I've been wanting to check this place out for some time. Glad I finally had an excuse. Great HH drink specials!", "author": "Elena N."}

This place has a pleasant open atmosphere and absolutely fantastic service. Prices aren't too bad either.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n1) Monkey Bread: The bread itself was average but it was soft and fun to eat. The chive oil was a nice touch as well. The basil aioli could've been a bit stronger but overall a good sharing appetizer (3.5/5)\n\n2) Crispy Duck Confit: I've had a lot of misses when it comes to duck confit but this was solid all around. The duck has a smooth and tender but the exterior had a nice crisp. The highlight was definitely the forbidden rice which was mixed with a light peking sauce and more duck. However I believe they also slightly fried it which gave it a wonderful texture. It was also a decent size. (4.5/5)\n\n3) Garganelli Bolognese w/ burrata & calabrian chili: My main entree for the night  and apparently one of their specialties. I couldn't decide between this and the burger and the waiter said if its your first time this is one of their main dishes though he'd personally go for the burger next time. First of all the dish looks small but is deceivingly filling. The meat tasted almost like a sausage and I wish there was more of it cause it was full of flavor. The burrata was also a great subtle touch of flavor. I also appreciated they used a ton of basil. Besides these highlights the dish was average. I do agree it's something that's nice to try once but not quite amazing either (3.5/5)\n\nOverall, Corridor was a filling tasty meal and a perfect pre-show dinner stop.

By day it's more casual counter-service restaurant, at night it has table service including the upstairs area. The menu looked good and reasonably priced so we thought we'd give it a try pre-theater. Boy am I glad we did! So many good choices and options...I'm on the fence between 4 and 5 stars...I'd say 4.5 if I could.\n\nAs for the food...onion soup was great...croutons and nice cheese with onion soup with real depth. Last 3 onions soups i've ordered (not here) have really disappointed me...this one didn't and lived up to what it should. Monkey bread is off the hook. It's basically like a brioche...butter filled, light and airy like a cloud with some cheddar cheese and some garlic aioli to spread on yourself. The spicy meatballs were ok...the sauce was nice with a little kick, but the meatballs themselves were not as tender and not hot all the way through which was disappointing. We also had the fried calamari, which was also so-so...needed more seasoning.\n\nFor mains we got were all solidly prepared. The tagliattelle carbonara was full of little surprises like croutons, fresh pasta and little pancetta bits. The risotto with a wonderful truffle kiss.\n\nAlso, our service that night with Caley was fantastic. Super thoughtful, attentive and not intrusive and very personable.

I guess this just gives me more of a reason to return! hehe\n\nTo share amongst our party of 4:\n\nSWEET CORN SOUP ($10): Poached Shrimp, Lime, Thai Basil, Coconut, Chili. Wow, did this app give us a scare. When the waiter brought the soup over, it was just a bowl of toppings fit for just one person, then he poured the soup over it and we were like Ohhhh... okay....The soup was rich, creamy, sweet, and very tasty (almost like thai curry). Incorporated with some potatoes and corn gave a nice pop. Sharable amongst two. \n\nMUSSELS & CLAMS ($15): Spicy Fregola, Capers, Toasted Bread. this app was alright. Taste was just okay but had a spicy kick to it. mussels and clams were just super duper tiny. probably won't order again..\n\nGARGANELLI BOLOGNESE ($16): Burrata, Basil, Calabrian Chili. My friend got this and it was absolutely yummy. The pasta was cooked al dente, cheesy, rich, and full of flavors. Definitely must try!\n\nPAN-ROASTED SALMON ($22) Clams, Bacon Lardon, Confit Potato, Chowder style broth. The salmon was cooked medium rare: crispy on the outside but super soft on the inside. Taste was simple with enough flavors from the chowder broth. \n\nHALF ROAST CHICKEN ($19): Made with Brocollini Panzanella and Calabrian Chili Vinaigrette. The brocollini was simply delicious! The chicken was juicy, most, and flavorful. Woo hoo. so far so good!\n\nDUCK CONFIT ($23): Duck... omg. the duck was really good. With the forbidden black rice was a nice finishing touch. Only downside was the rhubarb... SUPER sour..\n\nDRINKS:\nConsists mostly of wine and beer. They didn't have a full bar. Had only 4 low proof mixed drinks on the menu so bleh..... I opted for the sauvignon blanc ($9) which was crisp and refreshing (paired nicely with my salmon). The others liked their drinks as well. Also tried my friend's Peanut Butter Stout for the first time and it was surprisingly not bad! \n\nA BONUS was that they accepted my last minute call-in reservation for my party of 4 literally 40 minutes prior to arriving at 8:30pm. The ambiance and decor was very hip and casual with wide open windows and an open view to their kitchen! There's two floors: upstairs for reservations and downstairs for first come first serve. Right when we entered, the host gave us a key and we took it upstairs and gave it to the waiter and he brought us to our table! So cute... omg. like a corridor key!! Service was attentive. Had some good recommendations by Sarah and she accommodated my shrimp allergy with the Sweet corn soup. \n\nDefinitely gonna return to try their Monkey Bread and French Onion Soup. \n\nFor 4 people: 2 apps, 4 entrees, 4 drinks was ~$193 pre-tip.", "author": "Anissa D."}

The staff is incredibly nice and very present throughout the whole meal. We never needed to hunt them down for anything.\n2. The food was good for the most part! I enjoyed the calamari and most of the vegetable pot pie (see negatives below).\n3. The ambiance is incredible - it's good for a date night. I also liked the fact that it was multi-story. The second floor was definitely more intimate than the first, which makes sense as to why people with reservations are seated upstairs.\n\nA few negatives:\n\n1. The bottom parts of the vegetable pot pie tasted like the skillet - it was very odd so I didn't eat the bottom of the pie. The crust and the middle, however, were very tasty.\n2. I booked this reservation through Opentable and mentioned that when I walked in. However, they didn't mark that I showed up so I got an email from Opentable asking why I missed my reservation. It was added hassle for no reason if the restaurant had marked that I showed up.\n3. The dinner options are minimal - review the menu before deciding to go!\n\nAll-in all, it's a good restaurant for a date night, but there are better options out there in my point of view.", "author": "Remy B."}

It was really good better than the ones from Stones Throw. \n\nSpicy Meatballs ($10)- Tomato-Braised, Parmesan, Focaccia Croutons, Rosemary. I'm not a fan of meatballs but I liked this dish. It wasn't too spicy and it went well with the monkey bread together. \n\nPan-Roasted Salmon ($22) - Clams, Bacon Lardon, Confit Potato, Chowder Style Broth. Salmon was perfect and the chowder style broth added great flavor to this dish. \n\nMeatloaf Wellington ($23) - Creamed Spinach, Orach Salad, Bordelaise Vinaigrette. I didn't order this but was able to try the dish. It was okay. The meatloaf didn't have much flavor. You have to rely on the other ingredients on the plate to enjoy it. It was just not that enjoyable. Glad I didn't order it.\n\nChocolate Walnut Brownie Sundae  ($8) - I love desserts so this was good. We shared it cause we were full after our entree.\n\nEnvironment- The restaurant was really spacious and open. We were seated upstairs by the counter facing the entrance.

The deal applies to the wines, beer, and low liquor mixed drinks on the front of the menu. \"But no one brought me the menu!\" you say. Check those wooden ledges poking out from the table. Maybe hang your bag on the hooks stuck to the table legs. Other considerations aside, I like the design thought put into this place - you don't even need a patio to enjoy the sunshine with their floor to ceiling windows! \n\nWe arrived early and managed to get a table all to ourselves (4 seats, but you can squish 6), but pretty soon people had filled up the bar seating as well and were milling around. You'll notice you have to raise your voice as well as the evening gets on. Our table initially had a \"Reserved\" sign, but the perky staff pointed us there so we shrugged and made ourselves comfortable. The actual restaurant area is located upstairs, and I had no reason to venture up there as one of the bathrooms was located conveniently 10 feet behind me. \n\nOne of the mixed drinks had already run out (huh? before 6pm?), but my friend's Pimm's Cup looked gorgeous (and supposedly tasted so too), and my Gone with the Wind drink went down smooth and velvet-like. Solid marks all around for the non-alcoholic (and non-latte) Matcha Green Tea drink also.\n\nThe rest of the drink and appetizer menu looked decent, but without happy hour coverage, none of our party wanted to venture into overpriced territory.

From the classy Stone's Throw to the incredibly affordable Trestle and the cozy wine bar Fat Angel. Corridor is the latest addition and is planted in mid-Market area where some restaurants like Cadence and Oro didn't have a chance of surviving. But Corridor has longevity and these are the reasons why:\n\n1. It's their ability to combine healthy California cuisine and indulgent comfort food\n2. $5 cocktails, beer and wine for happy hour EVERY DAY. (so important during these hard times!) \n3. It's a cafe, a casual hangout spot and an upscale dinner place rolled into one.\n\nIt maybe confusing at first when you walk in, as the counter person checks you in and can also take in your orders as well. You can get your drinks at the bar or order food and grab a seat at one of the communal tables. If you made a rezzie, you're given a number to be taken to the mezzanine where a full service experience awaits. The best seats are the counter ones facing the tall glass panels which gives you a view of the bustling street below. \n\nI've been twice and both times opted for the mezzanine dining. You must order the Monkey Bread. It's a cake like bread served warm, topped with cheddar cheese, chive oil accompanied with basil aioli. Or their healthy version of the deep fried calamari served with leeks and olive tapenade. More heartier items include the roast chicken served with seasonal veggies atop garlic mashed potatoes or the loosely packed medium burger with melted cheddar, secret sauce and pickled slaw. This is comfort food at its finest and even more alluring is the fact that, entrees are all $23 and below! \n\nI'll constantly have Corridor in my radar when near Civic Center. It's perfect for catch up with gfs before going to a concert at Bill Graham or dining out with parents before they hop on BART back to the burbs. Corridor is a winner.", "author": "Janice C."}

I came here early May for my graduation dinner with a few of my close girlfriends and the horrendous customer service that we experienced, makes all of us not ever want to go back.\n\nWe were seated upstairs, and our waiter was Haley (Kaley?). He was the main server, that I could see upstairs. The start of the night was fine, everything was going well until he took our order for our entrees, which we had waited to do after we finished our appetizers. I ordered first and wanted the burger. When asked how I would like it prepared, I answered \"medium to medium rare\" because of how wide the range is, there is less room for mistakes as well as it gives the chef more of an idea of what I would like. I have asked this request many many times before at different restaurants around the city (Spruce, Michael Mina, Gary Danko etc) and have never had anyone say \"No, we can't do that\" before. With a puzzled look on my face, I asked \"Why?\" He explains that the restaurant only offered medium or medium rare, there is no spectrum for the middle. I was already thrown off because not a lot of servers would say \"No\" in such a brash and condescending tone. I then told him that I didn't have a problem with various restaurants when making this request before, and I was honestly confused as to why they couldn't do it or even say instead \"We can try to accommodate that but on the event that we can't which one would you prefer?\" Instead I got \"Maybe you haven't been to restaurants that know how to cook.\" Wow. Ok. Then I got pissed. And I knew he could see it in my face and curt responses so he stooped to my level and asked me again if I preferred medium or medium rare in such a condescending tone I wanted to get up and leave.\n\nThis as well as a series of other events (this was the huge main one) made me feel crappy the rest of the night. I didn't want to be THAT person and tell the manager since I could tell they were busy and I went back and forth in writing this review. But I felt like the management has the right to know how poorly their staff is being trained and treating their customers because the table next to us was also having problems with him and rolling their eyes whenever he asked them something in his tone. I definitely won't be coming back and will tell my friends who ask about this place the same. It's actually really disappointing because the food was actually good.", "author": "M T."}

My friends made reservations here for a large group dinner, which meant we had to order the dishes ahead of time, and everything would be served family style. This was perfect for our group since we all love to share. The prix fixe began at $45/person (before tax + tip), although we did pay a supplemental fee for a few of the dishes. It ended up being a crazy amount of food, and you really get your bang for the buck. \n\nI loved the appetizers and pasta courses, but the mains and dessert were just ok. However, I'm keeping the review at 5 stars since our server was awesome. We walked into Corridor Cafe, and were a bit confused at first since it was so casual. Corridor Restaurant is actually up the stairs, and provides a more intimate dining experience since the area isn't very big. We tried:\n\n3 Starters:\n-Monkey Bread (Pull-Apart Bread w/Cheddar Cheese, Chive Oil, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Ufp6ebCVpNbOwAyY_x9DOg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Super buttery and cheesy deliciousness. The additional butter/dipping sauce was also delicious, and it was difficult to stop eating this- a must try!\n-Mussels & Clams (Spicy Fregola, Capers, White Wine, Toasted Bread, + $1 Supplement/Person, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qPKkSk-IyPWfI4WG-OJy9w&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): This dish was very flavorful, and the mussels and clams were cooked perfectly. I loved the hummus like spread at the bottom of this dish, which was perfect with the toasted bread- recommended!\n-Beef Tartar (Shaved Ducked Liver Mousse, Tokyo Turnips, Truffle Vinaigrette, +$1.50 Supplement/Person, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Nb8bDdHP5ePCg6uQpP3V6A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- the beef tartar was really fresh, and the flavors in this dish worked well together. Recommended!\n\nPasta Course\n-Yellow Corn Risotto (Maitake Mushrooms, Black Truffle Butter, Parmesan, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=5hA4XPnT9kcL_2xODfE-_Q&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Delicious and flavorful, but also really rich. Although I enjoyed this dish, I'm not a huge risotto fan and wouldn't order this again.\n-Garganelli Bolognese (Burrata, Basil, Calabrian Chili, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=MndxRu__YgoOffTYpWDKew&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): SUPER DELICIOUS, and this was a favorite dish for everyone. The pasta was super fresh and cooked to the perfect al dente, and the sauce was amazing. The burrata was also a delicious plus- a must try!\n\nMains\n-Meatloaf Wellington (Creamed Spinach, Orach Salad, Bordelaise Vinaigrette, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HAfhJKcDSJcxPN0fDbD2Gw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Not that great- I didn't like the texture of the meatloaf or the flavors. The creamed spinach was also more of a sauteed spinach. Skip!\n-Pan Roasted Salmon (Clams, Bacon, Chowder Style Broth, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VAjRuPsgpoKqKdggVnTS5A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Not very good- the salmon pieces were tiny and overcooked/dry. The potatoes in the broth weren't cooked enough, and this dish was bland overall- skip!\n-Vegetable Pot Pie (Asparagus, Peas, Confit Potato, Pearl Onions, Corn Cream, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0zBPYFnZXweuycGg4ed-GQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=r2LXYQaQh-DxKdo6Tny-QA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok. The flaky top of the pot pie was delicious, but the filling was bland and a little watery- skip!\n\nDessert\n-'Nilla Pudding Tart ('Nilla Cookie Butter, 'Nilla Pudding, Banana, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XQoi7a8K6-4kVY-085F2Pg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): This dessert sounded delicious, but the execution was lacking. The pudding didn't have much flavor, and the cookie butter didn't quite work with the rest of the tart- skip!\n-Seasonal Fruit Crostata (Ice Cream, Brown Sugar Crumble, Mint, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=y10jwJ4-pKG8rtFQo3nKpw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok. The crostata was overbaked and hard, but at the ice cream was good. Skip!\n\nAgain, our server was amazing, and he did a great job getting us out of there in time. They do not skimp on the portions here, and we were all basically full after the pasta course. All the leftovers were sent home with one of the girls, so no food went to waste!

It's easy to track the buzzier openings, but I'd be lying if I said I knew much about Corridor before coming here.  However, it wasn't hard to get excited about checking them out after reading their reviews on Yelp, including a rather glowing one from Yelp buddy Cherylynn N.!\n\nNot to be confused with Corridor Cafe (their coffee, tea, and to-go arm), Corridor is a great spot that seems to be getting seriously overlooked.  Their location might be why (it's easy to miss, being at the bottom of a condominium tower), but it's also the reason there's plenty of street parking around (there aren't many other businesses nearby).  What's more, both the concept and the menu are very approachable - slightly elevated dishes at rather budget friendly prices for what you get.\n\nNOTE: Not sure about their lunch service, but for dinner, we had a traditional restaurant experience, as opposed to the \"order at the counter and take a seat\" concept others have mentioned.\n\n-- CALAMARI MISTO - Marinated & Fried Calamari, Smoked Potato, Harissa Aioli, and Olive Tapenade...$11\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/corridor-restaurant-san-francisco-4?select=bvutmt7LjNYn7l7QIUBoCQ)\nAs much as I love a plate full of fried calamari, this was an awesome take on the dish.  Not only were the fried pieces crispy and delicious, but I liked how the marinated ones added a textural and flavor contrast.  Also, the dish as a whole was well seasoned, but I thought the dabs of aioli added a nice touch.\n\n-- MONKEY BREAD - Pull-apart Bread with Cheddar Cheese, Chive OIl, and Basil Aioli...$6\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/corridor-restaurant-san-francisco-4?select=Q-HVph3ul8e_a1Rih4b8eQ)\nThankfully, all of the good stuff we had heard about this dish were true!  As a whole, the bread was very light, albeit a little oily.  The crusty exterior gave way to a soft, cheesy center that was accented well by the herbaceous flavors of the chive oil and basil aioli.  Plus, it's a great value, as it was enough for the four of us to share.\n\n-- GARGANELLI BOLOGNESE - Burrata, Basil, Calabrian Chili...$16\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/corridor-restaurant-san-francisco-4?select=ZgW_pspakiEOiOzqHB3GwQ)\nSeveral menu items caught my eye, but my pick was made as soon as I read \"burrata\".  The noodles had just the right bite to them and the taste of the sauce was terrific.  It could have used a little more meat and herbs, but the burrata more than made up for any shortcomings.  After all...it's BURRATA!\n\nBesides how solid the food was, we all thought the service was great as well.  Despite a short stretch where it felt like the servers had disappeared (maybe because we were seated at a corner table upstairs?), all of the workers were warm, friendly, and very accommodating.  Plus, unlike the chaotic traffic outside on Van Ness, Corridor has a relaxed vibe that's perfect for get togethers, whether it be with friends or that special someone.\n\nPersonally, this one experience was more than enough to quickly perch Corridor high on my list of go-to spots in SF.  The food here may not have impressed like how State Bird's or Marlowe's did, but I'd definitely like to come back to try the likes of their burger and chicken parm sandwich, as well as their sister restaurants (Fat Angel, Trestle, and Stone's Throw).\n\nFOUR AND A HALF STARS rounded down for now, but Corridor, you will see me again soon!", "author": "Mike L."}

I would recommend calling and making reservations beforehand if you want to sit in the restaurant portion of the restaurant upstairs, as it is a smaller area than the more casual bar seating downstairs.\n\nWe showed up on time and were prompted seated at our table upstairs. We ordered two appetizers to share: the crispy falafel croquettes ($9) and monkey bread ($6), which according to Yelp is a popular item here. \n\nThe falafel croquettes were alright; I was expecting something with potato since it was called croquette (and maybe there was), but it tasted exactly like a regular falafel to me. The monkey bread was the standout of the meal for me. The bread was still warm when served, and it was such a pleasure to rip a chunk of it out (with your hands, hence the name monkey bread) and take a big bite of the well-seasoned bread. The cheddar taste wasn't overly powerful either, which I was worried about.\n\nFor my main, I ordered the vegetable pot pie ($17). I am a sucker for pot pies and usually order it if I see it on the menu. It came out looking very promising, as it was much larger than expected and was still piping hot. However, once I started cutting into it, I realized that probably half of the pot pie was empty inside and that the size was deceiving given the amount of filling inside. I would have preferred a smaller pot pie that was fuller than a large one that's half air. The filling itself was okay, nothing really stood out except for the beets, which I thought was an interesting addition to the pot pie even though it felt like it didn't really belong. I don't think the salt was spread out evenly among the crust, as I hit a couple of areas of crust that were especially salty.

We ate:\n\n* Cheddar monkey bread: probably our least favorite dish. Immense waste of calories. It's like they took a piece of stale bread, and tried to reinvigorate it by dipping it in a vat of oil for 7 years, surrounding it with cheddar, and baking it until it somehow got even drier.\n\n* Falafel: it was just okay. I wouldn't come here for falafel, there is much better in the area. Also, this was pure falafel, not like whatever name they fancified it with.\n\n* Half chicken: it was a moist half chicken. Not the best, not the worst.\n\n* Bolognese: they either didn't make this pasta fresh, or it was overcooked, but the pasta melted in your mouth -- not in a good way. It's SF folks. If I'm going out and spending $20 on $2 worth of pasta, it's not unreasonable to expect it to be home made and al dente.\n\nI never go out of my way to write negative reviews, but none of our dishes were up to par. It's not that one or two were bad. They had a 100% failure rate. Really quite embarrassing that I brought a friend here after claiming SF has such a good food scene.\n\nOverall, this place was overpriced for what you get, and the food was just not good. There are much better options if you just walk a little west towards Hayes Street.", "author": "Gil F."}

The second floor is a bit more intimate. \n\nWe made reservations for 7:30 pm and notice how packed the upstairs floor was. Reservations are always a good idea.

I'll definitely be back for that. \n\nAfter careful consideration, my boyfriend and I decided to share the monkey bread, french soup, and garganelli bolognese. We completely underestimated how filling our carb-dominant dinner would be. We started off with the monkey bread which was warm, savory roll of bread with chive oil on top. Crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The inside of the bread was as soft as a sponge cake. Next, we had the French onion soup with a large helping of melted cheese. Not too sure what kind of cheese they use but it was very mild and perfect with the short rib and crostini. The chunks of short rib would literally melt in your mouth. Lastly, the bolognese which was perfecto! The pasta was cooked al dente and I liked how it had a strong taste of basil. \n\nBest part of all is that we barely broke our bank with this meal.

He asked us, first thing, if we had any food-allergies and my man-friend said he really doesn't like onions.

The monkey bread was soo good, worth every bite and the two toppings were just amazing together. We also ordered the spicy meatballs - not that spicy, and I am a wimp when it comes to spicy, the little gems salad (one complaint was that the avocados were a little under-ripe, but they tasted good, just too hard to cut with just your fork, and the calamari misto.

With a young hipster couple heaving sighs of entitlement behind us, Jamie W. and I found it hard to get relaxed when it felt like we needed to make several decisions quickly.\n\nNow I suppose we could have taken ourselves out of the line and really studied the menu among ourselves, but as we recited our order, it still felt like ordering a burrito bowl at Chipotle. Chef Jason Halverson and partner Ryan Cole would have you believe this is the future of upscale dining and probably tell you to get over it because mounting labor costs and exorbitant rents make it impossible to provide traditional table service anymore. OK, I get it. I'll just take my number upstairs to our table and shut up. We started with one of the \"Shareables\", the $6 Monkey Bread, a fairly reasonable price for the familiar pull-apart bread filled with melted cheddar cheese and accompanied by a chive dipping sauce (photo:  http://bit.ly/29Jz70p).\n\nIt was tasty enough though personally I didn't think the dipping sauce was necessary since the bread was so pliably oily. For his entree, Jamie definitely got the better deal with the $19 Half-Roast Chicken, which was a plentiful portion but even with the garlic chicken jus, it was a rather generic treatment given any number of rotisserie chicken operations around town. He wisely chose the crushed Yukon gold potatoes and the asparagus a la plancha as his sides (photo: http://bit.ly/29MBq0Z). Mine was an unmitigated flop, the $26 Beef Ribeye, apparently whole-roasted with a thyme and black pepper jus. Not only was it lukewarm but for medium-rare, it was overdone and sliced to the consistency of chewy roast beef. Expensive cafeteria fare.\n\nI also went for the asparagus but with the tomato-braised green beans instead of the potatoes (photo: http://bit.ly/29A2nbS). Never will I order the ribeye again, especially since it was the most expensive item on the regular menu. To pacify my spirits, I ordered the $9 Stones Throw Pimm's, which they aren't kidding is a low-proof cocktail as there was barely any giddy-up to what is normally one of my favorite libations even with vermouth and ginger beer reportedly in the mix (photo: http://bit.ly/29A2oMQ). The volume was getting awfully high with the neighboring party of obnoxious tech-heads particularly indifferent to the decibel levels they were generating. The three $8 dessert options just weren't enough for us to stay any longer than we had to.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...surprisingly disappointing execution given the pedigree\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...the bar is nicer than the noisy dining room upstairs with the plastic chairs particularly uncomfortable\nSERVICE - 2 stars...the not-quite waiter upstairs was attentive enough but otherwise...\nTOTAL - 2 stars...just think the attitudes at Little Gem are more in line with this order-at-the-counter concept we all have to get used to", "author": "Ed U."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-28", "description": "The San Francisco food scene has gotten ostentatious and in some cases, offensively overpriced. Don't get me wrong, I like fine dining and it has its place (for special occasions) but there's so many new [non-fine dining] restaurants in the city that seem to only be catering to new tech money.\n\nI won't name names but two weeks ago, I dined at a restaurant that charges $6 for carrot soup, for a sh*t you not: one shot worth. And, there's a newish restaurant nearby in Mid-Market where my friend and I paid $11 for three lettuce leaves adorned with 3 dots of dressing.\n\nWhat the PHUCK is up with this pretentious bullsh*t?! \n\nLadybugs eat more lettuce than that! \n\nEnter Corridor from the Hi Neighbor Group (Fat Angel, Stones Throw, Trestle, and Corridor Cafe). I've dined at all their other restaurants and I've consistently found that they offer solid food with healthy portions at reasonable prices served by a professional and a hospitable staff. Corridor is no different. \n\nThey grand opened today at the ground level of the 100 Van Ness luxury apartment building. They're open for lunch, happy hour (3 pm - 6 pm everyday), and dinner. The concept is \"fast fine dining\" and is a good option for nearby theatergoers. \n\nThe menu is New American and American Comfort Food with items like Falafel Croquettes, Corn Chowder, Crispy Duck Confit Salad, Pastas, Ribeye, Burger, French Dip, and Daily Specials (Hello, Porchetta and Braised Short Ribs!). Beer, wine, and loophole cocktails only. During HH (3 pm - 6 pm everyday), all draft beer, wine by the glass, and cocktails are $5. \n\nUpon walking in, you're greeted by a hostess. You order at the register, they swipe your credit card, and you're given a buzzer. You then seat yourself: downstairs in the bar or in a communal table, or upstairs in the mezzanine area (counter seats overlook Van Ness). Once you're seated, it's a full service restaurant. Your friendly server will take your buzzer, serve you water, deliver your food, and you can order additional items from him/her (e.g. extra booze or dessert). There's an automatic 15% gratuity added to your bill which is more than fair.\n\nIf you're in a rush and order multiple items, make sure to tell the cashier to fire your entire order, otherwise your meal will be coursed out. \n\nI stopped by today for a quick bite before going home. I can never order just one thing so I started with the Corn Chowder w/ cornbread madeleines ($9): http://bit.ly/2917QTa. Poured tableside, the corn chowder was velvety smooth and the plump corn kennels gave a nice pop of sweetness. The addition of the potato cubes is substantial enough for a light lunch or dinner. Minor gripe: it was a tad too salty for my taste. The accompanying cornbread madeleines were piping hot and carblicious - really enjoyed the salty bits of bacon. \n\nI also ordered the Garganelli Bolognese w/ burrata, basil, calabrian chili ($16): http://bit.ly/29dKsnW. The pasta was perfectly al-dente and blanketed with a robust meat sauce. At first, I thought it was bit too salty but the soft, milky burrata really helped temper the saltiness. \n\nUnfortunately, I had to drive home afterwards so I couldn't partake in their $5 HH drinks. Instead, I opted for their Top Hat: Ginger Beer, Cucumber, Lime, and Mint ($4.50): http://bit.ly/29dL3pG. Really refreshing and recommended for ginger lovers. \n\nI plan to return later this week to try other items on the menu so stay tuned!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-19", "description": "I really enjoyed this place! I think it's a great restaurant to come to for date night or to catch up with friends. There are two levels, I think the bottom level is for walk-ins and the upstairs is for parties that made a reservation. Since we made a reservation, we were seated upstairs which was smaller than the lower level, but had more of a romantic vibe. The lower level was a lot more casual, with high top tables and bar style seating. \n\n90% of their drink menu was beer & wine. The food menu was smaller compared to most places, but offered a great variety of options and had many different flavor profiles. My friend and I started with the Crispy Falafel Croquettes. This was a tad bit misleading since croquettes have potato in them, but these ones didn't. It was a normal falafel. Came with 6 pieces, topped with red onion, cucumber, and a creamy Tzatziki sauce. The falafel was good. Nothing outstanding, but I appreciated that it wasn't dry and had great seasoning. The Tzatziki sauce was very good too.\n\nFor dinner we ordered the Walnut Pesto & Polenta Ravioli Pasta, and the Stones Throw's Da Burga. The ravioli was very good. The noodle tasted like it was homemade. I also liked the crispy kale and pomegranate toppings. It added a unique flavor to the dish and gave it a nice crunch. The burger was smaller in size, but very filling because the meat patty was thick. The bun was fluffy, fries were crunchy, and came with a great aioli for dipping. \n\nOverall great dining experience. Food was yummy and reasonably priced. Service was fast and the staff is very attentive. Looking forward to coming back and trying their lunch menu!", "author": "Chisholm T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-02-07", "description": "Sometimes innovations and disruption are really spectacular.  Sometimes they are not.  Unfortunately, Corridor's \"innovative\" approach to restaurant process and flow are less than spectacular.  In fact, it seems like they have taken the least efficient parts of different service/flow concepts and merged them together for Corridor.  Or it's schizophrenic and can't decide if it wants to be casual and quick or a sit down place w table service.\n\nIt's counter service, but they go to \"reserve\" your table while you read the menu.  While it's nice to know you have a seat staked out, if you've already had time to decide what you'd like, you are left waiting for them to return and take your order.  Then, they take your order but start a tab rather than having you pay at the counter which leads to inefficiencies at the end of the meal.\n\nThey give you a table flasher/beeper thing like you would get at TGI Friday's or similar to tell you when your table is ready.  At Corridor, however, it's a nicer looking flasher/beeper and is for your server to know where to bring your food. I suspect this set up probably works equally well to the number-on-a-stick approach. Not likely more, or less, efficient.\n\nUnfortunately, when 30 minutes have passed and no one has come by to let you know your food is, indeed, coming, it's hard not to wonder if the gadget flashing on the table is working.  Can the servers actually see it, since it's flat on the table?  How do they know to bring your food to *your* flasher and not to someone else's?  Is someone eating my duck confit salad right now?!  Yes, some minor panic may start to set in...\n\nWhen the food finally arrived, I found my duck confit salad to be quite delicious. It was just a couple more dollars than salads I usually get near my downtown office, but much larger and included a lot of duck.  It was billed as duck confit w chicories, so I knew what I was getting.  I do think adding one non-bitter green would further enhance the flavor.  As I started eating, I thought that it was too bad that the food quality was marred by the strange service concept...or was it?  \n\nMy friend's pot pie was...something.  It had a lovely crust on top of its cute, generously-sized cast iron skillet.  Certainly promising at first glance.  Upon first bite, my friend was met with a fairly dry filling that wasn't very, uh, filling.  Ordinarily, pot pie has a good amount of bechamel or other gravy-like sauce and lots of veggies and chicken.  This was a mushroom pot pie, so no chicken expected, but my friend and I definitely expected to see a generous portion of veggies/mushrooms and sauce to go with the tasty crust.  We think if she had pulled the crust off completely to count the bits inside, it would have been about 10 pieces of potato and mushrooms.  Certainly, not the warm, comforting, filling experience expected from pot pie.\n\nSince you pay at the table rather than at the counter when you order, we had to flag down our server to get the check.  Not a big deal, but while we were pretty sure we had the right person, it was hard to tell bc there wasn't any one person who seemed to really be responsible for our table.  Paying was fairly speedy, but not as efficient as if we had simply paid at the counter.\n\nAmbiance: 3.5 stars. The decor is quite attractive but all high tops and hard surfaces.  Due to the hard surfaces, it is extremely loud.  Sitting across from my friend, I felt like I had to yell at her to have a conversation.  \n\nValue: 3 stars. The food itself was mixed.  While my salad was a good value, my friend's pot pie definitely was not.  Other people's food at our communal table appeared to be more along the lines of my salad in terms of value.\n\nService: I can't even give it a star rating.  I can't decide if it was poor service or not.  Kind of not, but such a weird service concept.\n\nWould I go back?  I enjoy seeing performances at the Opera House and it's nice to have another pre-performance option.  I won't go out of my way to go to Corridor, but I wouldn't be opposed to trying other things on the menu.  Now that I know how it works, I might find it less strange, but overall, I prefer to not need instructions on how to \"use\" a restaurant.", "author": "Sara E."}

We got some wines by the glass - the by the glass and bottle prices are pretty much the same. Prices aren't bad for SF at around $11-12/glass.\n\nTo start:\n1. Green garlic soup: could have used a little black pepper, but it was a nice smooth green puree. It was a nice presentation - poured over asparagus, spring peas, pickled onions, poached salmon, garlic croutons  \n2. Monkey bread: not as cheesy as I thought it would be.  It has cheddar in the middle, but the rest is like a lighter brioche-ish roll - very airy but also very oily. It's best eaten warm. \n\nPastas:\n1. Garganelli: with bolognese, burrata, and grilled sourdough. The bolognese had good flavor - nice and savory with a bit of spice from Calabrian chili. Pasta texture wasn't soft but wasn't al dente enough for me. the Burrata was the highlight of the dish.\n2. Sweet corn risotto: with maitake Mushrooms and black truffle butter. I'm not sure the super sweet corn and truffle better were a perfect match, but the rice texture was ver proper, and I liked the giant parmesan shavings\n3. Carbonara: the asparagus was a nice spin on the traditional carbonara. It wasn't overly heavy. Of the pastas, it was probably the one I liked best, but again, I think the pasta could have been more al dente\n\nMain:\n1. Crisp duck confit: good flavor and texture on the duck. It was a pretty big piece, served with forbidden black rice. I liked the Tokyo turnips and rhubarb in the black rice.\n\nPortions were pretty substantial - we were all actually very full despite walking in starving. \n\nFood-wise, nothing was amazingly stand out, but they had a good variety on the menu.  Notably, the kitchen staff were great - the chefs were all super friendly and seemed happy to be there - from when we walked by the kitchen to head upstairs to when one of the chefs brought out a dish to when we departed the restaurant.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

It serves mostly comfort food so don't expect anything too healthy here.  The food tastes good and I wouldn't mind eating here on any given night.  Corridor is a bit on the expensive side in my opinion, but I believe 100 Van Ness residents get a discount when opening a house account. \nMy favorite thing here are the meatballs. They are drenched in a sweetish tomato pepper sauce and sprinkled with cheese and basil. There are little piece of pepper in the sauce which add a nice kick of spice. \nMy boyfriend is a huge proponent of the bolognese here. I haven't had it myself but that's what he orders over and over. \nI've noticed that the monkey bread is one of the highlights here but I really have to say that I don't like it at all. It's super greasy and comes with a greasy dip. It's like eating garlic bread that has been soaked through with oil. It feels like a heart attack and I couldn't finish more than one piece before I threw the rest away. \nOverall, a solid dinner choice with the added benefit of being right under a residential complex.   The food is yummy but I would not recommend the monkey bread.", "author": "Amy X."}

The perfect combination of really good food, great service and a great atmosphere.\n\nWe are upstairs which was a smaller area (maybe 12 tables) and they had a counter that overlooked the city.\n\nWe started with calamari which was delicious. It was perfectly fried, and a spicy aioli sauce, but also had potatoes and an olive tapenade mixed in. I was a little hesitant about that mix but it turned out to be great. \n\nFor dinner we both had the Maine style shrimp roll. The brioche bun was small but flavorful and a good amount of shrimp. I was very pleased with the sandwich.\n\nI got broccolini for a side - quite good. \n\nThe waiter was very attentive, if any server walked by and your water was low they would fill you up. \n\nReally great place and we would definitely go back.", "author": "Trish B."}

Seems like an interesting place that had a very open design yet very modern. Situated on the bottom floor of the building it seems like a very welcoming place. Came here during their Happy Hour and they were offering beer, wine, and mocktails for $5. Started off food with their Gr\u00fcner wine and some appetizers before the main course. \n\nTthoughts on the Gr\u00fcner wine. Never that type of wine, so it was enlightening to be able to try it. Being a White Wine, it's flavor profile seems to be quite positive. Not as sweet as a Sav Blanc and a lot drier. Good for people who enjoy that type of thing, and recommend trying out once. \n\nThe Monkey Bread. A pretty decadent of fluffy bread topped off with some baked cheese on the top with a light layer of basil aioli. \n\nThe spicy meatballs were not as spicy as most people think. I would think the Tomato probably offset it, but it had a nice sweet sauce that would compliment the meatballs well. The croutons were crunchy soaked well in the tomato sauce.\n\nPanning the horizon for the flatbread, it ended up tasting alright with the different dips. Felt the flatbread wasn't too tasty and the sauces were decent but not as impressive as I would have thought.\n\nNow to the entree. I ended up getting the Pan Roasted Salmon in medium rare compliment with cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and walnut pesto. Thought that the charring on the vegetables gave an excellent effect that would compliment the salmon well. Salmon was very flavorful and did not seem overcooked. Bringing it together was the Walnut Pesto which provided a bit of a nutty yet a bit of an earthy sauce to the food.\n\nOverall I think it's a good place to grab a decent meal which may be a little pricey. However, their happy hour provides a good value for beer and wine.", "author": "Frank O."}

Both I'd dined at in the last year or two. The restaurant is very efficient, and I love it for it. You order at the front counter. Names the dishes, and you can then head to a table to eat. They will bring the dishes to you as soon as you place the order. Or you can sit at the bar and order at the bar. We took the last table downstairs. Now that we are officially middle aged people, we started to share entrees and appetizers as opposed to ordering two large entrees. Old people like us can't handle heavy meals. The burrata and heirloom tomatoes (I know it's very basic and every semi decent SF new American restaurant has it now) and calamari mistro (not basic, and taste more like salad) came very quickly, and were delicious to boot. as much as I wanted monkey bread, I said no to the extra carb. He wanted the salmon and who am I to say no to the healthy choice? Medium rare was not cooked to medium rare, it's more of a medium but it's actually quite lovely. Chased it down with Belgium ale. \n\nAll in all, a very efficient restaurant. Perfect location for opera, symphony or lectured goers. The restaurant can also be a good date place, though it's not terribly romantic for the set up, which I believe is its exact intent. I think the world has enough of those places, and its sister restaurants: Stones Throw on Hyde and Trestle on Jackson got those audiences covered. \n\nNote this is a fairly new restaurant in Civic Center area. It's price point is beyond reasonable for this city where a table for two religiously costs over $100. Here, the cost of two appetizers, both substantial and filling, and an entree, plus a beer on tap is way below it's contemporaries, and it all arrived within 10 minutes. Perfect for middle age people like I, who have places to go and bed to sleep in.  So is it because it's new that it's therefore charging less so to attract new patrons? Or is it designed to be on the more affordable side? I guess time will tell and I'm in no hurry to make this a known place to others.\n\nHere I am, already kick started yet another season of City Arts and Lectures (have ticket on hand for the very first front row seat for Ira Glass and Bruce Springsteen but I shall not brag any further) and until I find something else as convenient as this, I imagine I will be back in a heart beat.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Given the gentrification that accelerated in the past 5 years (see 100 Van Ness Condos, The Civic, NEMA), I automatically assume that new restaurants would cost an arm and leg (just for appetizers!). \n\nTherefore I was surprised, and pleased, to learn that Corridor's prices were relatively decent! My girlfriend and I shared the french onion soup with braised beef short rib, spicy meatballs, English pea risotto; she also enjoyed a glass of wine while I had herbal tea. The total was about $60 - not necessarily as cheap as a hole-in-the-wall Tenderloin joint but it was certainly cheaper than Alta!\n\nNote: Corridor is situated right on the intersection of Van Ness and Fell, surrounded by several theaters and the San Francisco Jazz Center.

It's a bit modern, and the layout is split into an upstairs and downstairs eating area. Even though there is plenty of space in both, the restaurant is usually busy and full, which speaks to how popular it can be. \n\nFood:\nMonkey Bread - Lots of Yelp reviews raved about it, so I had to give it a try. Overall, it was pretty good, but maybe I had high expectations about it. It's worth a try and definitely tasty, but just not as good as it could be. A bit too oily/greasy.\n\nWarm Flatbread & Dip Trio - Out of the three dips, the burrata and chermoula was the best. Salmon was interesting, but the texture and consistency seemed a bit odd. You can ask for more flatbread if you run out! Decent overall, but nothing amazing.\n\nPan-roasted Salmon - The sauce is divine. Really, that caper vinaigrette is quite something. It goes well with the salmon, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and...surprisingly, the grapes. The salmon is roasted to have a crispy texture on the outside, and is perfectly soft on the inside. Apparently it's medium-rare, but it seemed like normal roasted salmon to me. My only issue is that there was way too much salt on the salmon.\n\nSteak Frites - One of the specials during the evening when I went. The steak is decent and flavorful, but both the fries and steak were way too salty. About 6oz of meat, I believe. \n\nThe food was good, but nothing really screamed \"amazing\" out of the dishes I tried. Corridor is worth a try, and seems to have a lot of potential.

To be honest, not knowing what to expect (just read that it was on the top 100), it felt like an upscale cafeteria/diner. I think it has to do with the concrete floors, and the communal tables were \"sterile\" with 6 tops that were set-up in a cafeteria style layout. We sat upstairs which was nicer but still lacked ambience.\n\nI'm a big fan of casual, clean, simple, healthy cuisine. Reading the reviews gave me the impression that's what this was - but there were no salads or vegetable options on the menu. Everything was very meat or carb oriented - so if you are into that - this is your spot. I did order the burger (no bun) and asked for a green salad on the side, which they were happy to accommodate. My husband ordered the beef wellington which he said tasted good. Our friends ordered the special beef shortrib onion soup, which he said tasted good but surprised that it wasn't hot just warm. We also ordered the Monkey bread recalling a version that we had in Hawaii. This really was not the traditional \"pull apart\" monkey bread - it was tasty but I felt it was very rich and soaked with oil and didn't taste much of the cheese.\n\nOverall, it was good - but did it stand out and inspire us to come back? Unfortunately not... I just had dinner at Alta which is also in the same neighborhood. I felt that the food was much better, more memorable, better priced, and a nicer ambience.", "author": "SY K."}

We live in the neighborhood and were originally pumped; hopefully everything we experienced was just symptoms of new restaurant growing pains.\n\nFrom the start, things felt disorganized - the locked front door directed folks to walk around the restaurant, enter through the small side entrance, at which point we were ushered through the busy restaurant all the way back to...the front entrance? Why not just let us in there?\n\nThe concept is an upscale casual in that you order at the front at a register to be given a number, which you take with you to find open seating somewhere (note: this will probably be difficult for any party bigger than 4, as the tables are either communal or small)\n\nFOOD: \nMonkey Bread: Like cheesy bread from dominos, just less cheese and more chives. 3/5\n\nRibeye: This literally came out cold.

I love the pastas from Trestle and Stones Throw and was looking forward to see how they translated to the new concept. They did not disappoint.\n\n1 of our 4 guests was over 15 minutes late and they offered us a beverage immediately while we waited at the bar. We chose an affordably priced rose which was delicious.

Good sized portion and the best restaurant falafel that I have ever had.\n\nFLATBREAD TRIO - loved the combination of choices, the spicy salmon spread was to die for and had to fight my table over every bite.\n\nSPICY MEATBALLS - the sauce was so flavorful and not too spicy (the spicier the better for me but not for all of our group). Plus, the portion was a nice size we almost had 2 pieces each. Quite filling.\n\nTOMATO & BURRATTA SALAD - the burratta was creamy and soft (not too chewy) and  the pesto gave it a brightness and depth of flavor with a hint of nuttiness.\n\nASPARAGUS RISOTTO - this was a table favorite, hands down. We could have eaten another and it was not a small plate. The rice was perfectly cooked and the texture was superb.\n\nSQUID INK CONCHIGLIE - the classic from Stones Throw. Several of us have tried it many many times but one person just had to have it again and the squid ink pasta was so tender and the seafood plentiful. \n\nGARGANELLI BOLOGNESE - I think that this is from the Trestle menu and it was delicious. Not heavy, but very flavorful. Like what my Grandmother would make but better.\n\nVEGETABLE POT PIE - this dish was surprising. It was very reminiscent of a certain Lobster pot pie with veggies. The crust was perfection.\n\nSTONES THROW'S DA BURGA - this was meaty and perfectly cooked. The slaw added the right crunch.\n\nFRENCH FRIES - I love french fries and am a pretty picky when it comes to them. Not too thick, not too thin. Right on.

I would make myself a special tunnel so I could go back and forth with ease.\nTheir menu is a little difficult because simply you want to order everything. We settled on monkey bread, shrimp rolls , vegetable pot pie and tomato and burrata salad. The monkey bread reminded me of the cheesy bread you get from Sizzler's but a 100 times better. The shrimp rolls were light and flavorful on a perfectly toasted buttery roll. You would never miss the meat in the vegetable pot pie. Pure decadence!

OK, then why didn't she just explain that to begin with. I can see that going up and down the stairs all night might be problematic, but I've been to other restaurants with different levels that don't have this process.\n\nWe ordered the monkey bread, which was nothing special. The meatloaf Wellington comes with two sides of different spinach preparations, which I find strange. The Wellington had a strong sharp taste that I did not enjoy.

You come in and order your food and first round of drinks at the counter. This is similar to how they do things at pubs in London. You're given one of those little buzzy things for when your food is ready. If you don't have a reservation you just find a place to sit downstairs. I had made a reservation so we went upstairs where we had a table. When our food was ready they brought it to the table. And any subsequent drinks or dessert you can order from your waiter. I think they do a lot of sharing here because they have a tendency to cut things into portions. For example my daughter had the burger and even though we said not to cut it up they cut it into four pieces anyway. When her burger first showed up even though we had said only cheese and nothing else it's still had some sauce on the bottom so we had to send it back. Our food came out in waves. My wife's salad came first and then we waited quite a long time for the rest of our meal to show up. I guess this is part of their whole sharing concept but it was a little awkward while we waited and waited for the rest of the food. The food itself was very good. I had the salmon which was excellent. It came with some brussels sprouts and some grapes of all thing which was an excellent  accompaniment. My son had a roast chicken which was also excellent.

Instead of cream spinach, we asked for simply wilted spinach without the cream, which they obliged. The service was fantastic, several people came to check on us, and when I realized that their sesame dressing on one of the salads was waaay too spicy and inedible for me, they gladly substituted it. Friendly, warm, cordial, they made us feel welcome. I loved the upstairs seating, away from the cacophony of the downstairs kitchen and bar area.

A huge shout out to the host who checked in with the kitchen to make sure we could be in and out before we had to leave for a show. As we were waiting for our table he came back regularly to us to give us updates on when our table would be ready. As we waited we observed his interactions with other guests and his service was above and beyond. Good service goes a very long way with me and of course the great service was matched with great food. I remember the food being fabulous from my last visit and it continues to be so.

FIrst off, it is located in the restaurant desert near the  civic center and is ensconced in a lovely, two story venue.  Lest I forget, service was very good.  Of course one would expect that from the newest member of the Stone's throw/Trestle restaurant group.  But it's really all about the food with me.  How they manage to keep pricing so low is incredible.  However, why complain about a bargain?  And the food itself is up-dated comfort food with a twist.  \n\nFor example short rib onion soup comes topped with a layer of cheese, naturally.   Underneath the cheese is a tasty melange of short rib, carrots and tomatoes.  Wonderful.\n\nA salad of smoked trout, quinoa, green apples, potatoes, dill and horseradish is large enough to be a main course and every bite was tasty.\n\nFinally, pedestrian meatloaf has been upgraded to meatloaf wellington.   The immense portion of meatloaf comes with crushed potatoes and a medley of vegetables.   \n\nIf you like really good food at bargain prices then Corridor is for you.", "author": "David D."}

The chicken parm sandwich is the best chicken parm ever and I've lived in Philly! ;) Perfect bread. Perfect sauce. Gooey cheese. Tender meat. Also try the corn on the cob. \n\nGenerally the portions were large. The gargnelli was overcooked and bland despite the fresh basil and chili oil. Needs some vivid flavors. The salmon entree was also boring and the fish was too salty. But I will definitely return for the chicken parm.

It seems like most of the food here is really rich, so we would cut back on ordering on our next visit.\n\nThe service is outstanding, throughout. Very friendly staff without being overbearing.\n\nThe setup is a little strange: downstairs, the bar atmosphere offers long banquet tables for sharing, accommodating probably 8-10 guests.  Upstairs, there are about 10 tables, which fill up quickly with the theater crowd.  The set up is a little awkward, with someone at your table having to face a blank wall with their back to the room.

Thought we'd try it out because of the good Yelp reviews. We didn't have a reservation so we ordered at the counter and then got a beeper thing. This was  a bit confusing because they also have servers and menus at the table but you pay back up at the counter before you leave. We wanted to order beer after we had sat down but it took forever to flag the waitress. Our food ended up coming out long before she came back with the beer.\n\nI ordered the mushroom vegetable pot pie.  It had a delicious-looking crust on top of a cast iron skillet.  It looked promising but there was fairly dry filling and didn't have much inside of it. The pie was mostly filled with air. The pieces of mushroom and potato that were in there tasted good, but it wasn't as filling as I would've hoped. It came with a wedge salad on the side that looked good, but I personally wasn't a fan of the mustard dressing they put on it.\n\nMy boyfriend got the burger. Again, it looked promising, but was EXTREMELY buttery. The meat was cooked well. \n\nAll-in-all, fun ambiance, weird service system, and good beer selection, but the food was absolutely not worth it for the price.", "author": "Rachael R."}

There is a range between decent and really good, between really good and superlative, that could only be expressed in half stars. Corridor is a 3 1/2 star.\n\nArrived on time for Happy Hour, when beer, wine, and lower alcohol drinks are $5. Got a very nice Sangria, fruity, could taste the wine without being knocked flat.\n\nWaiter told me they had added a side Little Gem lettuce salad. Just what I needed as a first course after a weekend of rich food. Pretty basic, lettuce wedges, thin slices of radish and cucumber, with vinaigrette. But nothing wrong with a basic salad.\n\nDecided on meat loaf as I have not had meat loaf in years! Came with smashed potatoes and root vegetables, both decent, not outstanding. Meat loaf was very good but frankly, although they called it meat loaf Wellington and therefore I knew it was bread wrapped, found the bread extraneous. I liked the taste but maybe by the end of the weekend of foodie-ism was a bit \"over-starched\". \n\nFor dessert I might under other circumstances have had the brownie sundae (which did sound good) but alas, Corridor suffered by being the last of my four restaurants in a weekend. Tried the apple tart. The tart was good, so was the ice cream, so was the caramel sauce. But it was garnished with dice and thin slices of apple that were so sour they set my teeth on edge. I have eaten Granny Smith many times, they are tart but not sour like this. They tasted unripe. The apples in the tart were fine so maybe they just had an unripe apple that became my garnish.\n\nI have to say this. I was one of the first two parties (OK, party of one) seated and everyone else in the dining room, including people who arrived well after me, got their food before I did. Possibly it was just that meat loaf takes longer to cook than everything else, possibly some minor kitchen error. I do like to give benefit of the doubt. But being a woman who often dines solo, it has happened too many times so I always wonder - was it just chance or was I considered a less important customer than couples/groups/men?", "author": "Carol S."}

After a supremely lackluster brunch, my expectations were very low for this place, holding nothing against it, as I'd never been. Just being seated by someone would have been a win. Thankfully, this restaurant delivered. Parking, since it's near the theater and the civic center, is unbelievably difficult, so don't even bother trying to park nearby. We ended up about 6 minutes away somehow, which was another win in itself. I had an Open Table reservation, so even though I was about 5-10 minutes late, the restaurant was able to seat us quickly (you check in on the first floor, and go upstairs. They have a high top table area/bar downstairs). We sat along the rail, so we could people watch from above. The space upstairs is extremely limited, and only one-two people handle all of the logistics. They really never stop moving. The server was nice and accomodating, and made sure we never had to wait too long for anything. Went with just a plain pilsner to start off (not many cocktails listed, I don't think they offer a full bar upstairs or something), which I have no complaints with. The monkey bread was raved about, so I made sure to get some. It's like a gourmet cheese bread, really. Very soft and easy to tear into, I liked it. The lasagna was spot on: great sauce, and even a tint of spice (probably the salsa verde, very unique). I liked they also gave you extra sauce to dump all over if you wanted more. I really liked the Radicchio too. My girlfriend's burger was good too, it was not as pink as I'd thought it'd be, but still tasty. Bathrooms are downstairs, so you do have to do a little limbo-ing to get past the servers, who are booking it up the stairs getting orders out to people. Nothing too crazy though. Even saw an ADA lift nearby if you have disabled guests. All in all, great bounceback dinner, and would be back to try other items.", "author": "Dan M."}

Too bad this concept is not offered in DC, I hope to try one of their sister restaurants before I leave. My understanding the Chef is Jason Halverson and he absolutely knows what he's doing. Me and my friend had a cocktail and some food. We shared some fries, ordered the brocollini for each of ourselves, and she had the French onion soup. The french onion soup was prepared a little different than what I'm used to. This presentation included tender beef, and tomatoes with the standard ingredients that make up French onion soup.", "author": "Jarrett C."}

The counter ordering makes it feel like a deli and yet you pay restaurant prices. They serve you your food but it didn't feel like restaurant service. It feel like deli service, like someone serving you your sandwich. It surprises me that this is a sister restaurant to Stones Throw. The food did not match the quality, nor did the service or the ambiance. Save your money and go to Stones Throw.", "author": "Stacy M."}

Their happy hour menu is a GREAT deal, with all beer, wine, and cocktails offered for $5. I will say that I wish the cocktails weren't \"low proof\" and had a little more kick to them, but they definitely taste great even if you don't get much of a buzz off them. We were seated right at the bar so we were also able to look right into the open kitchen where they were plating the food, which looked really good.

The hostess told me she would call if a table opened up ....she called that afternoon. Great service already! \nWe were a group of 4. We started with the monkey bread , which was delicious! We had an assortment of items, all very good! French onion soup was great!  Everyone at the table was pleased with their choice. Service is good, very friendly staff. We were upstairs, which was still a bit noisy, but not bad. \nI would definitely go back, especially if heading to the theater. Very reasonable prices, portions are big. They have a nice happy hour too, which helps with the bar bill! Wish we could have tried dessert, but we were all stuffed! \nGreat place all around!", "author": "Lisa B."}

Avocado had brown spots and tasted like vinegar (clearly bad), chicken was dry and flavorless (unless you count the slightly old taste), greens were soggy and overdressed (in gross greasy dressing), bacon was dry and had a weird taste, ... Overall, there was a bitter taste, and the combination of bad & old ingredients didn't taste good. Left with a stomach ache, looking for anything to eat that would change the bad taste in my mouth. Maybe Monday is an off day for them; regardless, I don't think I will go back to try something else given the lingering bitter taste in my mouth and stomach ache.", "author": "Ruth C."}

Every item was cooked and seasoned to perfection. It's a great place for lunch or dinner!

Most disappointing was the food, none of which I would order again. The sunchokes were nearly raw and were covered with raw flour, the vinaigrette on the salmon tasted like it was bottled, and the little gem salad with dijon vinaigrette tasted only like horseradish.  It is difficult to believe that Michael Bauer gave Corridor any stars in his Chronicle review. Our service was almost nonexistent until we spoke with the manager.  She was responsive and they subsequently became much more engaged and for that I am appreciative.  It comes down to the food for me and it was simply horrible.", "author": "Leslie C."}

I counted six micro bites.  The risotto was cooked days ago and reheated.   The savory bread pudding wasn't really bread pudding -- rather a brioche style roll with a cream sauce (that was NOT raclette).   The quality does not match the pricing.

It was incredibly rich, and hearty, with none of the oiliness of some french onion soups; perfect for a foggy day in SF.

This brand new eatery is a welcome addition to the Civic Center area of San Francisco. Two decades (and before) ago, no one would do anything but scurry through this area--very seedy. Downright scary. However, in the last couple of years, this area \"woke\" up, the Vitamin D came in to feed creative people and lo, The Corridor Restaurant appeared.  What an attentive staff!  What professional and friendly managers! What terrific food!  Light dishes and full meals are available in several combinations. Try the \"Little Gem\" salad--it belongs on a magazine cover--just a picture of crisp romaine slices with perfect little radish dials, and just a dribble of savory dressing. Try the pesto-covered roasted carrots! DO NOT miss the Falafel Croquettes--you will swoon, just swoon. I am afraid every time I go in that I will lose control and just order two dozen plates of those!!! When you arrive, march purposefully to your left and place your order. Don't dither as there are a dozen people behind you hungrier than you! You are given a little glowing coaster that has a GPS finder which will direct the server as to where you are in the restaurant--either next to the HUGE curved picture window (what that must have cost!) or hiding upstairs in a little romantic corner so you can sip your favorite beverage and kiss your sweetie. The spicy meatballs are a wonderful addition to the meal. NO hard distilled liquor is served, but innovative beers and unusual wines are always available. They cleverly sunk the menu into the tables themselves so you can pull out the list again to order MORE once you've stuffed yourself with those falafels!
