We were looking for a delicious place in the area and this just popped up at the top of our list at the time. They take reservations I believe, but when we went with a big table, there was an extra table free in the back so we didn't have to wait.\n\nThe curries were delicious, but we ordered ours medium, which ended up being a lot more spicy than I am used to. My favorites were the Butter Chicken and the other recommended Chicken, it was called creamy or something. The garlic naan was also pretty good.\n\nThe one part I didn't like was that the rice had this weird smell to it. It was like they didn't wash it or washed it in bad water or something, I'm not exactly sure but the rice was not good.\n\nOverall a good choice, but I would pass on the rice, or hope that that was a one time incident.", "author": "Tyler T."}

Food is priced well for the portions. \n\nThe place does fill up a bit around 6:00PM, but they will try to fit you at a larger table before using the small ones. For two people, we ordered a garlic naan ($2.99), rice pilau (2.00), Chicken tandoori mild (9.99), and Paneer Makhani ($8.99). The entree comes with a free salad. The salad is a nice touch, but I did prefer if the carrots were shredded and not roughly sliced. \n\nI LOVE THE GARLIC NAAN. Usually when naan gets could, it becomes a bit tough to get through. But these ones did not have that problem! The chicken tandoori was placed on a hot plate on top of onions and green peppers. While the chicken was tender and juicy, the onions were still raw. Would prefer if these vegetables were cooked a bit more before placing on the hot plate. Lastly, the Paneer Makhani. For those who haven't had this before, you're missing out. Cubes of cottage cheese in a tomato butter sauce. A perfect touch of both sweet and savory. A DEFINITELY MUST TRY. \n\nThe wait staff pays attention to each table, and doesn't rush anyone to order.

She's not good with the hole-in-the-wall places.  This is not your fine dining place, but a good place to pick up your food to-go.  But it was just me today, for a quick lunch, so I popped in, sat at the counter and ordered a curry.\n\nBADAMI CHICKEN CURRY (4/5) - The waiter said this was his favorite, so I went with his suggestion.  Curry was made with pistachios, so it had a nutty flavor and the garlic definitely came through too.  I asked for \"very spicy\" and it came spicy, but not very.  The only criticism I had about the curry is that the chicken wasn't tender.  Sometimes Indian restaurants will throw un-marinated meat into curries, when they run short or to save time.  This was definitely not tandoori chicken, but the curry was flavorful enough to make up for the chicken.  Still enjoyable.\n\nGARLIC NAAN (5/5) - Nothing negative to say about this naan.  Hot and puffy, garlicky and buttery.  Some Indian restaurants over-caramelize their garlic and sometimes you get burned pieces of garlic in the naan.  Not so here.  The garlic was nicely done, soft with a good amount worked into the bread. \n\nIt was a good lunch.  No doubt the cooks in the back are good at what they do.  The service was mediocre, what you might expect at a place like this.\n\nI was looking through pictures that other Yelpers have taken here at LD, and I came across a picture of the restaurant (posted below) that I didn't recognize.  And then I looked closer and realized this is the same restaurant where I ate!  I noticed the date of the pic which was 2005.  Wow, this is what the place originally looked like!?  Boy, have times changed! Just let me say it doesn't look AT ALL like that anymore.  \n\nMy wife (who is from India btw) just asked me now, \"was the curry good there?\".  \n\nI told her, \"yes\".  Then she asked, \"would you go back?\" \n\nAnd I said, \"yes, to pick up food to go, but not to dine in.\"\n\nSo that's my advice - call in your order and pick up some tasty curry and naan. Or if you're good with hole-in-the-wall environments, come on down and dine in! But don't expect the restaurant to look like what you see in this picture or you're going to be very disappointed.", "author": "Darien R."}

Portions are generous, price is reasonable, and the dishes are packed with flavor without being too heavy. My go-to's are usually the dal soup, chicken vindaloo or tikka masala, rice pillau, and the saag paneer. Their naan is very large, so you really only need to order one. There are always leftovers when I order two main dishes & rice for two people, which is an added plus. \n\nBe careful: their spices are HOT. Even medium is too hot for me, and I am usually pretty good about heat in food. \n\nThe only negative I have is an issue with a delivery person. One of the many times I've ordered delivery, the driver drove too far up the street, refused to go around, rolled down the passenger window and made me reach in to get the food. Then he demanded a tip from me, which I had left inside. He sat in the car, not moving, until I went and got it. Needless to say, it ruined my evening. I thought about giving one less star for this issue, but I don't think it adequately captures the restaurant as a whole.", "author": "Regina L."}

Once I got checked into my hotel and settled in, I opened up my trusted Yelp app and began looking for some food for delivery. I knew I could trust the Yelpers in SF as they are the heart and soul of what started this amazing directory. \n\nI knew right away that I wanted Indian food and there were a plethora of options near by. After narrowing things down to the spots that delivered to my hotel, I decided on Little Delhi. They had an enormous number of phenomenal reviews and my favorite Indian dish, navratan korma. I ordered that as well as some samosas. Yelp told me the wait would be about 45 minutes but I was pleasantly surprised when I got a call about 15 minutes later saying they were in the lobby and I could come down to grab my food. Once I got back to my room, ready to devour my dinner I was immediately halted because they didn't include silverware in my order. Like..seriously? Isn't silverware a staple for to-go and delivery orders? It took me some time to track down some utensils but once I did, I dove right in. \n\nI started with the samosas and it was a total let down. They were so greasy it was crazy. They were almost see-through there was so much oil. They also lacked flavor and were super bland. The only good thing about the appetizer was the two sauces that came with it. The tamarind sauce was sweet and the other was spicy. They were a good pairing and did help with the lack in flavor. After that I got into my main dish and I can say that this made up for the not-so-good samosas. The korma was delicious, had just enough spice and was very flavorful. The rice and naan paired with it was good too. For roughly $25 in SF, I gotta give this joint a 3 star. The main dish was great, they were speedy on the delivery, and fulfilled my mean appetite.", "author": "Jayme H."}

It is a cold blend of crispy fried chip puffs, garbanzo beans, potatoes, yogurt, and chutney. t's my first time having it and it was pretty good! I also had MANGO LASSI which is a classic sweet mango yogurt drink in India. It was very sweet like usual. They also gave us complementary chips and sauce, I didn't know what it was called but it was pretty good. \n\nCHICKEN TANDOORI was the best!!! The sizzling platter screamed yummm when it arrived. The 4 pieces of boned in chicken were roasted to perfection - soft, tender, juicy, and not crispy/burnt at all. It also comes with a plate of salad, and grilled onions. \n\nBUTTER CHICKEN was delicious too, the sauce was rich and and chicken were soft. It pairs extremely well with GARLIC NAAN and rice. Garlic naan was a but expensive, and each serving is cut into 4 quartered pieces. The naan was soft and chewy just the way we liked it. I would probably go with plain naan next time, so the taste will not overpower the curry. \n\nOverall, I loved this place, the food was authentic and delicious, prices were reasonable too.

I came here for lunch today (after having Pakwan the previous night for dinner) and I ordered saag paneer along with some naan. Compared to Pakwan, I prefer the saag paneer here. It's not only more flavorful, but I like the ability to choose your added level of spiciness.

Every time I pass this restaurant it's busy but I've stayed away because of the strong aroma of curry from out on the sidewalk.  Granted, curry is far more pleasant of a smell then most of the smells in the tenderloin; however, it can be overpowering.\n\nI decided a simple dinner of fresh bread sounded good, from the menu posted in the window I was thrilled to see all the bread options available.  After much deliberation I decided on the Little Dehli Special Stuffed Bread which is \"delicately seasoned ground chicken, onion & cottage cheese\".  Basically, it's naan bread similar in concept to a quesadilla with what appears to be scrambled eggs and sausage and by delicately they mean very mildly spiced. I also got the garlic naan with the intention of sharing but ended up stuffing my face with it as it had the appeal of garlic bread.\n\nBoth servings were large with the stuffed naan at $3.99 and the garlic naan at $2.25, it's an incredible bargain & cheap eats score.  Each piece was sized to fill a small basket on the table so there was plenty to share. \n\nDecour is old-school diner with tablecloths.  There is a lot of staff whom are mostly young, thin and decked in crisp white aprons.  All are moving at a constant rush and I can only imagine that the service is very attentive when dining there.  I had ordered my bread to go.  Even after walking to The Warfield and waiting a few minutes before opening my bag, the bread was so hot I had to wait for it to cool before eating.", "author": "Ann T."}

We checked Cheesecake Factory which was jam packed and had over 2 hours of waiting time. We were so hungry and disappointed, one of the friend suggested this place and we all agreed to give it a try. \n\nFOOD\n\nPapad with green and red chutney - It was complimentary. \n\nChicken Kabab - Another mouth watering dish which had 6 succulent pieces of chicken. We finished it before it even served.\n\nChicken Tandoori - It had to do justice to the name of this restaurant and it did. It had perfect amount of spices to ensure it wasn't too spicy and served on a bed of caramelised onions. (They were bomb!!!)\n\nPapari Chat - Being a huge fan of chaat, I must admit it was one of the best chaat I had so far in San Francisco downtown. Perfectly flavored chutneys, and garnished with Sev, added the spicy and sweet punch to the dish. \n\nDESERT\n\nKulfi - We were so full, but still thought of giving kulfi a try to balance our palates. It was sweet, had no nuts and had a weird toffee flavour to it. (I didn't enjoy it as much I enjoyed the other dishes) \n\nAmbience - Gives a feel of the typical Indian restaurant with ancient paintings of goddesses on the wall, just like a lot of old structures present in Delhi, high ceilings, bright yellow lights, comfortable and spacious seating makes up for a great fine dining option.\n\nService - Place was very busy, but we got lucky and one family was just leaving. We had to wait for 5 minutes. The staff was attentive and amicable. \n\nSuggestion - Please be a little generous with Green chutney, we had to ask them twice thrice for more chutney it was that less.", "author": "Simran K."}

The chaat arrived still crunchy. Loved all the different textures and layers of savory, sweet, and tangy flavors. This was enough for a light meal. \n\n*Badami Chicken: Tandoori chicken, pistachio & cashew curry ($10.99): http://bit.ly/2ah4XBj\nThe tandoori chicken was perfectly cooked - the chunks of white meat were surprisingly juicy and very tender with a nice smokiness. It was the best cooked tandoori chicken I've had. \n\nHowever, I was slightly disappointed with the nut curry because it was really thick (almost pasty), didn't have much nutty flavor, and had a slight burnt aftertaste. For the most amazing nut curry, Cuisine of Nepal (Bernal Heights) has the best cashew cream curry. Ever. \n\n*Naan ($1.50): Hot and fluffy with a good soft chew. Great vessel for the curry sauce. \n\n*Basmati rice ($2): http://bit.ly/29ZJUEg\nA large portion of fragrant, al-dente rice studded with cardamon pods (?). \n\nI went overboard with the carbs (to use up all the credit) but I had enough food for 3 filling meals which is a rarity in San Francisco for under $20!\n\nLittle Delhi: Non-gentrification prices, generous portions, fast delivery, and the best cooked tandoori chicken. \n\nWho says, there's nothing tender about the 'loin?!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

And they all love it. \n\nThe wait staff are super attentive, so I really appreciate that. They all seem really chill, too.

The times I had luck going here for dinner was either 5PM or later on at 8PM. \n\nI liked the food I got here so much, I never decided to experiment otherwise. I swear by the butter chicken and the garlic naan. Nothing else. You dip the naan in the butter chicken sauce and you can thank me later. I've tried it both mild and spicy. The spicy is just the right amount of spice. But just so I can devour my food more quickly, I opt for the mild because I am weak. The sauce is thick and creamy, the chicken has a great chewy texture. I can't even describe it properly, just get it. I read somewhere online that the \"butter chicken\" is the equivalent of a \"General Tso's Chicken\" for Chinese cuisine. As if that's supposed to deter me because that means it's not as authentic? I'll rep it with pride. BUTTER CHICKEN WITH GARLIC NAAN.\n\nMy boyfriend, on the other hand, is more adventurous.

We HAVE to check Little Delhi out.\n\nYou know a place has to be decent when it's packed with so many people... my friends and I came around 630 on a Friday night and we're lucky enough to find a table for 3.\n\nThis place is a North Indian restaurant and so you're gonna get your typical curry dishes with rice and naan. The prices are pretty reasonable given SF competition, but note that if you want naan or rice, you'll have to pay for it. We family shared and got several items.\n\nGarlic Naan (10/10). We first have to get this naan out of the way. Even by itself, it was GOOD! Unlike a lot of places, it wasn't too buttery. The garlic was phenomenal and the bread was flaky and not too crunchy. It definitely wasn't the best I've ever had but for like $3 ish you get what you pay for and more. Plus serve it with...\n\nLamb Vindaloo (9/10). Apparently this restaurant was known for its curry so we had to try it. The lamb Vindaloo was a more mild curry than your Marsala. The sauce was phenomenal and the most lamb pieces were tender. I wish that every piece was as juicy as the first few i tried, but unfortunately some were tougher - the problem with lamb.\n\nButter chicken (9/10). Oh, everyone's health nightmare. This butter chicken was really good! I love the tomato based sauce. It pairs well with the naan. Although I didn't like it as much as the lamb Vindaloo, it was still amazing. Shoutout to my friend who got this.\n\nFish Tandoori (7/10). I guess I was expecting something amazing with this one and I was somewhat satisfied? As a tandoori you're not gonna get much flavor-the meat is smoked. The fish was very soft and paired well with onions. I guess I wished there was some Indian spices in there that gave it a kick. The salad that came with it was also underwhelming. Mix it with the sauce and you are good to go.\n\nTl;dr this restaurant was really nice to try.

Vegetable Biriyani ($9.99) - Humongous portion with welcoming homely flavor, freshly prepared ground masala (not like ready-to-cook Garam masala) (9.99$).\n5. Indian Chai ($1.50) - Good & Indian flavored.\n\nRestaurant is located at the heart of San Francisco city, although the surrounding would make you think otherwise.

I really did.\n\nI ordered a delivery lamb tikka masala from them via Seamless, and I hope it was delicious.  I was staying in a hotel, and make the (apparently incorrect) assumption that the dish was delivered with rice and utensils. After many repeated conversations with various levels of management at the restaurant, they told me that dishes aren't served with rice or utensils, and that it's the responsibility of Seamless/Grubhub to supply utensils with meals.  Given that I'm in a hotel, I was perfectly willing to let the rice issue go, but without utensils, I wasn't actually able to eat what I received.\n\nIt smelled delicious.\n\nEventually, I just started getting a busy signal at the restaurant (I guess they got tired of talking to me), and just called Seamless customer service.  They eventually gave me $35 in Seamless credits, which was more than I actually spent ($22), so I was made whole-ish, but the process left me pretty hungry and very frustrated (it took just over an hour to get all of this ironed out, and I still haven't eaten).\n\nThe bottom line is this:  If you want food that smells good (I can't vouch for the taste -- I couldn't eat it), order from here.

It was looking like we would be dining at Burger King, until Little Delhi came into view.\n\nWe were seated right away, and waited on quickly as well. Since we were both hungry we ordered a huge lunch that included: Naan with raita, tandoori chicken, chicken vindaloo, rice, and a salad. However, the first thing that was brought to our table was a plate of thin and crispy, cracker type bread, with two dipping sauces: A sweet mint sauce, and an even sweeter brown sauce that I can only describe as close to bbq sauce. Both tasted amazing, but the mint sauce we kept and used on everything else throughout the meal. It was that good. \n\nThe salad was good, and large enough to share between two people. \n\nEverything else was served family style. The naan was fluffy and crispy at the same time, and tasted amazing; Naan is good, but fresh made naan is better. The cold and tangy raita sauce made for great and delicious contrast to the naan. The chicken vindaloo had decent sized chunks of chicken and potato, drowning in a dreamy sauce. The tandoori chicken came out on a sizzling plate, was bright red, and was lying on a bed of peppers and onions. The chicken was tender enough to pull apart with a fork. \n\nThe staff was very quiet, but also very attentive. I cook/ chefs are the ones who bring the food to your table, so that was a nice touch.

Little Delhi is amazing with their spices and flavors. As entree dishes, he ordered the Butter Chicken, Lamb Saag, and Baingan Bharta. Then, a variety of naan to go with it. I couldn't actually tell the difference between all the naan but I loved their Garlic Naan. I've never been a rice-eater.\n\nMy favorite will always be the Butter Chicken - the creamy and tomato-ey-ness of this dish is perfect. The chicken is tender and it warms my heart. The Lamb Saag was also wonderful - giant cubes of lamb all tucked into the spinach dish. Also, despite my hate of eggplant, the Baigan Bharta wasn't bad. And yes, boyfriend did order this dish with full knowledge of my food preferences -_- but again, I admit, it wasn't bad.\n\nIf you like chips and salsa as an appetizer, you need to get the Pappadam. It looks like a thin tortilla. You break off a piece and dip it into one of their two sauces. If I remember correctly, the green one is less spicy. Interesting.\n\nYou HAVE to get the Chai Tea! It gives you warm fuzzies on a cold foggy San Francisco day. Also, I don't know if there's a trick to getting unlimited refills, but it's real! You can get refill after refill of this deliciously spiced drink!\n\nI took a star away because of the inattentive service. Getting a waiter to refill the Chai Tea was annoying, especially because we were stuck in between two tables in the middle of the floor. It's lightweight understandable though - they're always busy. They also asked us to move to a smaller table so they could set up our 4-person table for a bigger party, which isn't an issue at all - but halfway through our meal, we noticed that the other table was still empty. Hmm...\n\nAlso, because I work so close, I'm tempted to get delivery one of these days and compare the quality, even with the scary 60-75 mins standard ETA.

Since leftover chicken badami tasted pretty bomb diggity good, I knew that eating it fresh would be even better.  And what resulted was three years of continuous patronage to what I can safely say is my fave Indian joint in the city.\n\nEach time I come here, I usually order an order of samosas, chicken badami, butter chicken, onion kulcha, garlic naan (plus the complimentary papadam).  This amount of food is very filling for two people.  I wouldn't recommend ordering more than that since I am always stuffed when I get these dishes (and I consider myself a pretty big eater). Here's my summary of items to get (or perhaps pass on):\n\nTHE GOOD (MY TO-GO-TO ITEMS):\nChicken badami is a pretty unique dish in that not many Indian places offer this dish... in fact, of all the Indian restaurants I've been to around the nation, I haven't found this dish except at Little Delhi.  One of the central ingredients are almonds, which is why chicken badami is creamy, rich, nutty, and sweet.  I've probably had this curry 15 to 20 times, and it's always been good.  The butter chicken is also very tasty and rich tasting, as would be expected for any curry with butter as a central ingredient.  I've had butter chicken at other Indian restaurants in SF, and Little Delhi's is one of the better ones I've had.\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD:  \nThere have been times where I have deviated and have ordered different dishes than my typical to-go-to items. I've had their fish curry, prawn biryani, and aloo gobi... which were average and not the best I've had before at other Indian joints.  The most recent time I came here, I ordered the fish curry and aloo gobi as medium spicy and prawn biryani as mild spicy; however, none of these were spicy.  A little disappointing for those who want a little spice to pique their palate.\n\nIf you haven't been here before, I'd stick to what the restaurant is known for (in the menu, marked as a Chef's Special/Recommendation).  Curry-wise, I'd recommend trying my all time faves chicken badami and butter chicken. Skip the fish curry, aloo gobi, and biryanis.\n\nEven though I've had some so-so dishes here, the chicken badami and butter chicken still win my heart over. Chicken badami and butter chicken for the win!", "author": "Matthew L."}

Walked there after work to pick up take out.\n\n*Samosa: fried pastry shells stuffed with spicy potatoes, served with chutney ($4.50)\nCrispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I did wish their mint dipping sauce was mintier and creamier. Could have provided a better contrast since I really liked the samosas.\n\n*Chicken tikka masala: diced tandoori chicken cooked in creamy sauce with tomatoes and spices ($9.99)\nThe sauce was super flavorful! But I thought the curry wasn't creamy enough and the tomato overpowered the rest of the flavors.\n\n*Rice pillau: long grain basmati rice ($2)\nRice was cooked nicely. Great with the curry.\n\n*Onion kulcha: stuffed generously with crushed onion ($2.25)\nA little mushy for me, but lots of onion flavor.\n\n*Garlic naan: tandoori naan topped off with seasonal garlic ($2.25)\nLoved the garlic naan! Soft, chewy and garlicky!\n\nIn hindsight, I think I would have enjoyed the butter chicken more. But chicken tikka masala is my go to dish when I'm in need of comfort.

A jewel in the Tenderloin!\n\nI ate there twice in 7 days and when you think about the AMAZING dining choices in SF, that really says something!\n\nA friend who had never tried Indian food before dined with me and loved the food. I went with my standard favorites...tomato soup, CTM, peas pilau and of course, garlic naan. \n\nSome would ask why on earth tomato soup, but once you try it here, you'll wonder why they don't sell it  by the quart to take home!  Richly flavored, nicely spiced for flavor and not heat and generous with the fresh cilantro....I honestly think I could have just that and be happy. But then, the other items are so good, there is no way I can pass them up!  I also got a tomato soup to go and had it cold the next morning after a hard 11 mile run...SO refreshing!!  I sometimes mix it with \n\nNow, onto that Chicken Tikka Masala...love, love, love that they ask what level of spice. And when you say NONE they respect that. They still season for flavor, but no heat at all and this tender tongued diner appreciates that!  I can't help I was raised by a woman who thought milk was a spice!\n\nThen the peas pilau...how I ever went through my life without fragrant rice, fresh peas, sliced almonds and the bevy of seasonings in my food choices....I do not know!  And the naan....oh the naan!  Garlic without being GARLIC! GARLIC! GARLIC! Some places go so overboard, vampires from miles away run and hide after garlic naan. This is just the most delightful and savory naan...crisp in the middle and pillowy at the edges. \n\nNow I know better than to order a caffeinated beverage at night--but the siren song of the MOST incredible chai tea I've ever had in the United States called out to me and I had a cup. The flavor, the richness, the silky texture, the perfectly understated and reasonably sized cup...what is up with cups the size of my head...all add up to a delightful experience!

The samosas were freshly cooked and wonderfully delicious. \n\nThe chicken tikka masala was very flavorful and creamy. The lamb saag wasn't as good. The lamb was too tough and the spinach sauce had no flavor. We ordered both entrees with a medium spice level, but neither had a kick to them. Next time, I'll have to try them spicy.

This is where Little Delhi, and Eat24 came in. \n\nOrdered up a pile of stuff online (vegetable biryani, butter chicken, aloo tiki, kabuli naan, green salad, and papadam, and a mango lassi and the rice pudding). They showed up early. Brought paper plates and napkins. And the delivery guy was friendly and patient while we wrangled the dog and got the cash. \n\nThe food was great. We did think the biryani was quite spicy, which we didn't expect based on the menu listing. But, I know my mom's spicy level is less than a two year olds. So it's us probably. And the mango lassi portion was small, and I thought the other portions were small, but this was actually too much food for us all said and done. \n\nI was stoked this worked out. Easy. Came to my hotel room. Wasn't screwed up. Was hot and tasty. Excellent experience and I would do it again. \n\nI've lived in SF before, and I'm a big fan of Indian takeout, and this is probably the best experience I've ever had.

Our friends told us to be sure to eat at the Little Delhi restaurant while we visited San Francisco.  Wow! What a fantastic tip!\n\nWe ordered two entrees, a vegetable, bread, and rice. The service was impeccable with constant, friendly attention. The serving dishes were traditional Indian and kept the food hot. \n\nOur feast started with complimentary papadum served with spicy mint chutney and tamarind sauce that did not disappoint us. Shortly after savoring every morsel of the papadum, our meal was presented to us, beautifully, and piping hot. The roti (whole wheat tandoori cooked/baked bread) was flavorful and hearty. We ordered the curry lamb spicy (not extra spicy) and I can attest it was SPICY, with a generous portion of melt-in-your-mouth chunks of marvelously seasoned lamb. The chicken dish (ordered mild) was served with a light sauce containing cashews and pistachios. The spices were well balanced and caused our tastebuds to dance with joy. \n\nBut the greatest surprise of the evening, the total show stopper, was the eggplant in a succulent tomato sauce with green peas. This flavorful combination produced explosions of flavor each time a green pea \"popped\" when bitten down upon. The snap of the peas with each bite was mind shatteringly scrumptious. \n\nWe have added the Little Delhi restaurant to our short list of \"must dine at every time we visit\" San Francisco. We now know, first hand, why our friends so vehemently recommended Little Delhi. We are eagerly looking forward to sampling other dishes on our next visit!

One problem I keep running into is that a lot of places make their curries just WAY too oily.. like to the point that you're just drinking oil. I am actually very sensitive to oil so I just can't have that. Little Delhi's curries aren't oily.. they are just thick, flavorful, and FULL of meat.\n\nI am seriously addicted to this place. So I just had to come here and thank them for making the best curries in the area and making it so readily accessible and affordable that I can eat it every day.

Over the years, I've introduced Little Delhi to fellow Indian-food-loving friends and family members, and they've all been very impressed. In fact, this past Saturday night, I took a friend who had never been to Little Delhi to the place. Evidently she's now hooked! She texted me last night to tell me that she ordered a good four dishes in for herself!!\n\nThe dishes are delicious and ever so flavorful. I highly recommend the butter chicken (which is a\u007f chicken dish that comes with a thick red delicious curry), baingan bharta (eggplant), the okra dish, and the chicken tikka masala (now generally I'm not a big advocate of chicken tikka masala but I love Little Delhi's version as it's on the less creamy side). I also highly recommend getting the dishes with some delicious garlic naan and a bit of rice. The beverages are also a solid way to go at this place. The chai and the mango lassi are both quite tasty. \n\nWhat's more than all this? The dishes are so reasonably priced.

If it was a song, it would only have one note repeated over and over again. I was not impressed with the dish. \n\nWe also ordered some veggie samosas. The pastry was a bit too doughy, but the filling was quite good. The chutneys were decent, but nothing special. \n\nOn the plus side, our service was very good. \n\nGiven that there is another Indian restaurant literally  right across the street, if I was in the area again, I'd probably opt to try the other place instead of coming back to Little Delhi.", "author": "Ravi S."}

But I guess that's the conundrum of the area since it instills fear even as you look for the hidden culinary pleasures to be had. Chief among them is the abundance of great South Asian eateries like Lahore Karahi, Shalimar and Chutney - all winners in my book. You can add Little Delhi to that semi-exclusive group because the $10.99 Badami Chicken is - what does Liza say - oh yeah, it's 'stupid'. Badami Chicken...it's 'stupid'. Yeah, I don't get that playaz talk either, but that dish is awfully good.\n\nI ordered the chef-recommended dish on a brisk weeknight when the place was already starting to fill up around 6PM. Its enviable proximity to Powell Street Plaza and the big convention hotels like Parc 55 and the Hilton ensures a steady flow of city-ignorant diners, which I have to admit is a bit of a turn-off. But it doesn't affect the service, which I found pretty attentive but bordering on automatic pilot. The complimentary papardam and dipping sauces came right away (see photo) as I was perusing the menu. The Badami Chicken had me at hello since it appears to combine my two favorite types of poultry preparation - tandoori and korma.\n\nThe chicken chunks were tender but with the unmistakable texture only tandoori grilling provides as they were swimming the backstroke in a creamy sauce filled with chopped pistachios and sliced almonds. Ladling it liberally over the $2 plate of Rice Pillau made for a most satisfying meal (see photo). I did think it was a tad overpriced, probably due to the tourist influx factor, which also prevented me from ordering the equally pricey $9.99 Okra Vegetable. Oh well, next time. I did wonder, however, if this same restaurant was on Jones Street whether it would have been as expensive. Probably not but then again, I would have needed a bigger can of pepper spray.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...that Badami Chicken was pure ambrosia\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...once a diner, always a diner\nSERVICE - 3 stars...efficient bordering on robotic but who's complaining?\nTOTAL - 4 stars...a killer dish goes a long way for me", "author": "Ed U."}

Raisin, cherry and coconut puree inside. I have not stopped craving more. We tried the chicken tikka masala, the lamb curry and saag paneer. All were a delight to eat. The flavors were explosive (in a good way) on each bite. The chicken and lamb were both very tender. A key player in this meal was the chai. The perfect blend if you ask me. \n\nEveryone from the staff we interacted with was very kind. Our bill came to something like $45 before tip. We were all stuffed and struggled to finish the final few bites. You really get good value here. I fully intend to be back sooner than later. \n\nFor those who have to commute over, it's adjacent to Market Street so plenty of public transit options to get here.

It's pretty good, but for their tandoori, I prefer other locations in the Bay (though nothing can hold a candle to Punjabi Tandoor in San Diego). Despite being in the middle of TL, with needles and people sleeping all over the street, you walk in and it's a nice ambiance. Promptly seated and given papad and water, we knew what we were ordering from the beginning. My fiancee had the paneer makhani and I had the tandoori platter. We also ordered a papdi chaat, which was pretty good, as it went low on potatoes and high on crispy bits. The paneer makhani was good. The paneer wasn't too chewy though I think the gravy was a little too tomato-y for my tastes. The tandoori was good, though the chicken was a little dry and the seekh kabob kind of soft.

I came here with two other friends who were also trying Indian food for the first time as well. For starters, we ordered a yogurt appetizer with chips and chick peas. (Forgot the name but i rate it 7/10) After, we had the Chicken Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken. The staff were very friendly and explained to us what each dish was as well. I thought customer service was 9/10. \n\nI was a little bit unimpressed with the Chicken Tikka Masala. I thought it was a little too sour for me and that the hype about having the chicken tikka masala depends on the person eating it. Some may like it sour, but those who don't enjoy sour tomato sauce, should not order this. \n\nOn the other hand, for those who like creamy texture (butter) chicken should definitely order the butter chicken. We also ordered 3 types of bread and a side of lentil ricr. The roti bread, garlic naan bread and the plain naan were all very delicious. I would recommend dipping the bread into the sauce and scooping some rice along with it. Think of it like a nacho chip or salsa chip. That was the way i ate it. \n\nThose who have not had Indian food for the first time should definitely check this place out. It's convenietly in the downtoen area, so it is very easy accessible. Instead of getting just chicken based sauce dishes, I recommend getting some curry options as well. After all, it IS an Indian restaurant.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

I've probably ordered food from here upwards of 30 times in the last year, and I've never been disappointed by their paneer tikka. \n\nI really like that their paneer tikka masala also has bell pepper and onion pieces in the gravy. It gives the dish a nice crunch! Paneer is good, I've had better, but it's the gravy I really enjoy. It is a little oily so beware of that. Also, for spice level, their medium is pretty spicy. I would not recommend getting anything other than mild unless you have a really good spice tolerance. Ordered the medium once, and I could not get through more than a few bites. I usually pair this with their onion kulcha - I never get anything other than plain naan whenever I go to other Indian restaurants but I really enjoy the onion kulcha here!\n\nI've tried their daal makhani and that dish can be really good sometimes. My only complaint is that the dish doesn't always taste fresh, I've ordered it before and it tasted like it was a few days old and made my stomach hurt after. \n\nI've also ordered their aloo saag, and it tasted extremely bland so I've never ordered it again. Their papdi chaat is good - nothing amazing; I had it to-go, and I would assume it tastes better served in the restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant location is kind of sketchy and not that great from the inside. Totally fine if you're going for a casual meal, but wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a nice or upscale ambiance. I almost never eat at the restaurant, but atleast with the paneer (which I've ordered both at the location and for delivery/to-go), I haven't felt like it tastes better in the restaurant. The dish has been consistent in taste everytime I've ordered it. \n\nMy other favorite item on the menu is the nimbu pani. Nimbu pani is Indian style lemonade which is not as sweet as regular lemonade. It has masala in it so it gives the drink a bit of a kick. Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying if you've never had nimbu pani or if you've had it and you like it.

It is actually located on the outskirts of the Tenderloin (very close to Union Square) so it is not too bad in terms of the sketch meter.  But the smell of pee (or something similar to it) did still pervade the restaurant which was unfortunate.\n\nThe restaurant is OK.  There is a lot of seating.  The food is fairly cheap as far as food prices go.  You can expect to pay around $10 a dish, but rice is extra.\n\nThe food itself was OK.  I love vegetable korma but each Indian restaurant seems to do it a bit differently.  My particular favorite ones are the kormas that are bright orange and full of vegetables.  This vegetable korma was more of a muted yellow color.  The flavor was a bit too bland for my taste.  I also got mild and there was absolutely no spice.  I think I should stick with medium from now on.\n\nThe garlic naan was not bad.  The bread was fluffy although I suppose it could have used a tiny bit more salt.\n\nThe plate of rice is big enough to feed two people.  It's basmati rice though so it will definitely fall apart and inevitably end up all over the table so be careful.", "author": "Danielle C."}

I was addicted to their Chicken Tikka Masala, creamy, spicy with a subtle sweetness over saffron rice.  \n\nBut their chicken started tasting old/bad and they substantially reduced the quantity of chicken in their Chicken Tikka Masala.  They are so nice, a real honest small business just trying to make it.  So I tried the chicken 2 more different times with the same results, the final time the old chicken taste grossed me out so much that I just threw the whole thing away.

Unfortunately, it's been about a month (or maybe just a few weeks) and something seems to have changed. I ordered food and the curries I received were salted to the point of being inedible. Not just talking about a little extra salt - I mean, in a bite of curry you could feel the salt crystals.\n\nI rarely send food back or try to seek a correction on an order. The only time is if it completely ruins the meal and the money paid was essentially for absolutely nothing. This was the case here. I contacted Eat24 (who has excellent customer service -- also, they're now a Yelp company for what it's worth). Eat24 reached out to the restaurant and explained the situation and they offered a 20% discount on the food.... which would be nice if they had ruined the sides of rice as that's about what the dollar value is that they offered as a discount.\n\nI have to say I'm very disappointed in the restaurant that upon learning they sent out completely ruined food they did not offer to comp the entire meal in the hopes that they would be able to keep a customer. I've been a patron for a long time, but now I'm not likely to order from here again. If you want to keep customers these days, you have to make things right when you mess up and they did not do that. Instead they offered what amounted to maybe 4-6 bucks off an almost $30 order that was wholly ruined by over-salting. \n\nIf you've seen any cooking show or ever cooked anything ever, you know over-salting is one of the most heinous of culinary crimes. You can under-salt and people can add it on their own... but you can't take back over-salting and it renders food completely unpalatable.\n\nVery disappointed in this experience.", "author": "Marc C."}

Their food is really reasonable especially their lunch menu which is so cheap but also limited so you can't have the same food every time you go there. \nI recommend trying their paneer tikka masala which was really nice, may be the best tikka masala I've had in a long time. If you have a sweet tooth try their kulfi, it was a little sweet for me but definitely delicious. I just hoped there could be more variety in the menu.", "author": "Pratibha S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-01", "description": "Little Delhi is a lot like a spouse. They aren't perfect, but you love them anyways. There are days when everything about them is perfect and wonderful, and there are days when you're a little irritated and something is a little off. But you can't live without them. You need them in your life. That is Little Delhi for me. \n\nI have ordered takeout from them through Eat24 probably 40 times... maybe more. After eating somewhere this often, you have to expect some ups and downs. Being that I continue to order from them, it is a fact that most of the time, everything that has arrived at my apartment from Little Delhi is excellent. My favorite thing on their menu is the Badami Chicken. I have never done crack, but I imagine the feeling I get when this Badami Chicken hits my mouth is how a crack addict feels when hitting the pipe. The difference here is they get skinny while I get fat. Oh well. Indian food addiction is much more acceptable than crack addiction. So there.\n\nMy other favorite is the Dal Makhani, which is is creamed lentils and is fabulous for dipping your naan in. Dal Makhani is the item that I never know how it will be when I order it. When Little Delhi is on top of it, the dal makhani is creamy. When they are having an off night, it's kinda runny. It's still tasty, but it's way better when it's creamy and thick.\n\nI have tried their butter chicken and chicken tikka masala numerous times but ultimately gave up on them, because most nights they were too tomato-y for me. Like, not enough spices and it tasted very similar simply to tomato sauce. So I gave their chicken curry a shot in place of those 2 items and love it. So far it has arrived delicious every single time. The naan is great too! Definitely get enough naan to scoop up all the extra sauce from the badami chicken, dal makhani and chicken curry. You will have a happy swollen tummy.\n\nAs far as delivery times are concerned, Eat24 usually quotes me at 60-90 minutes, and only once out of the 40 something times I have ordered has it ever gone over 90 minutes. Maybe 6-9 times has it taken over 60 minutes, which is within the quoted time, but still feels like forever when you're hungry. Obviously, I would say give them a try.

The place looks small from outside but is very spacious and has a bar too. I went here twice during my last visit to sfo, that definitely means I had a great experience here.\n\nAs we walked in we were seated to a table right next to the bar. They give complimentary papad with chutneys(tamarind and corinader ), this is so common for restuarants back in India.

Everything was so perfect about it right from boneless chicken, right amount og sauce, peppers and onions. The chicken tikka masala was not spicy was really tasty. I still remember licking my fingers after eating that F**KIN awesome biryani. The naans were fresh too. There was so much food that we had to take it back home.  \n\nDuring my second visist I told them to make food extra spicy, thier definition of \"Extra Spicy\" is really to the point. The food came out fresh and was super spicy like Indian spicy not American spicy. My Moijito wasn't strong but that was a $5 mojito so can't complain.

I have no complaints about the CTM.  I don't care for Saag Paneer, that was more for everyone else at the table.  On the other hand, the Butter Chicken surprised me because I kept having to pick out bones and/or seasonings that were un-chewable, which ruined my meal and appetite.  Same for the Lamb Biryani, which I was very excited to try.  I hate having to be mindful of chewing just in case I end up breaking a tooth, especially when you're eating plates that you're supposed to be able to swallow easily.  The service is kind of nonexistent also.  They're very nice to you when they are at your table, but don't come back unless you wave your arms like crazy to get their attention.

There was plenty of seating in the restaurant so I don't know if there is ever a wait. We did come on a Thursday night, so it might be a little busier on the weekends.\n\nThe menu offers so many good choices I didn't know what to do! Because of this, I decided to go with one of the \"Chef's choices,\" the Badami Chicken. This was tandoori chicken cooked in a coconut curry sauce with pistachios and one other nut (forgot). Let me say that the pistachios in the curry with the sweetness of the coconut was damn near heavenly. The huge chunks of tandoori chicken in the curry were cooked very nicely (not dry at all). I asked for it spicy but it wasn't that spicy which in the end I was happy about because too spicy would've taken away from the great flavor of the dish.\n\nThe naan was perfectly fine, as were the samosas I ordered for appetizers. They also bring out complementary sesame chips with curry and mint dips which were a nice small appetizer as well.\n\nNext time I definitely want to try one of the rice dishes because they looked amazing!\n\nNo complaints about service. We got our food within 15-20 minutes which is completely reasonable. Our cups of water were filled constantly.

It's so good, I'll be able to forgive some things like: Slow service and long wait when you eat in the restaurant (30 minute wait at 7pm on a Sunday Night) and then ever slower service when you order delivery (eat24) - on average 45 minutes from when you place your order. \n\nWhy do I love new dehli so much? One common theme: creamy, savory, flavorful, well put together dishes. The chicken they use is typically big succulent chunks of white meat. Yum!\n\nMy favorites that I recommend:\n\nChicken Tikka Masala  - creamy tomatoey yummy with rice AND naan at the same time.  But for me, since i'm not the world's biggest indian food specialist - I've tried most of the tomato based curry dishes and I thought they were all fabulous. \n\nChicken Saag or Saag Paneer - pureeed spinach, spices, cubes of cheese - just dive in, don't mind the green color - you won't be disappointed. \n\nPapri Chat - \"Indian Junk food\" think 7 layer dip, but indian style - different types of beans, yogurt, crunchy chips, onions, tamarid and cilantro sauces - perfection - but eat fast before it all gets soggy! \n\nVegetable Korma - think potato yum yum with spices, beans  fried with tamarid or cilantro sauces to dip. \n\nSpicy Level Tip: If you think Siracha sauce is too spicy get medium. If you think siaracha is just right get medium. If you think siracha is too weak get hot - and you can ask them for the super spicy.", "author": "Christine B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-15", "description": "I love curry and I love spice. Indian food really satisfies these two criteria, and so does Little Delhi. \n\nWhat's for dinner:\n-Lamb curry, (ordered spicy) \n-garlic naan\n-paratha\n-raita (yogurt sauce with cucumber and carrots)\n-chicken biryani (ordered medium)\n-aloo matar (potatoes and green peas in a tomato based curry sauce)\n\nIn all fairness, I'm not an Indian cuisine connoisseur, but this was good food. You can order your food either mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy. All the food came out hot, and I was worried that I didn't order enough food for two, but it was just the right amount. \nThe lamb was tender and very flavorful. The aloo matar was a little too sweet for my taste, and the chicken biryani was off the chain. I was able to count 6 chunks of chicken in the rice, and my naiveness got the best of me when I avoided eating what I thought were slivers of garlic on the rice but were actually almonds, which added a nice crunchy texture to the biryani.\nThe garlic naan was D-E-licious and complemented the curry sauces well. The paratha wasn't memorable here, and I've had better versions that were from the frozen section of Trader Joe's. \n\nThe \"spicy\" level of spiciness was perfect for me. Not spicy to the point where I couldn't enjoy my food but spicy enough to give me a runny nose and make my ears warm. The yogurt sauce was a nice cooling touch in between bites. \n\nThe service here is a slow but friendly. We had to flag down the waitress a few times to order, refill our waters, napkins.. So I ended up walking to the front counter myself to pay and get a to-go box which I really didn't mind. This place isn't advertised for their service or lack thereof. \n\nOverall, an enjoyable dining experience.", "author": "Victoria T."}

At the time, I actually didn't realize that's where the delicious Chicken Tikka Masala originated from...\n\nI've probably eaten dinner here 6 or so times over the 4 years since, and it's my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.\n\nA few quick downsides:\n\n- The service can be really slow....or really fast. I guess the takeaway is you never know, so leave yourself some time.\n- It gets really hot and stuffy inside, I think they suffer from a bit of a ventilation problem.\n\nThe numerous upsides:\n\n- The vegetarian menu is extensive and fantastic. My go-to favorite is the Paneer Makhani, but the Bengan Bharta is also pretty fantastic. \n- Their Garlic Naan is to die for. Seriously good.\n- Their Chicken Tikka Masala is also really delish - in fact, it's my baseline against which I measure all other tikka masalas, which are just never as good.\n- Cheap drink menu\n- Never had to wait\n\nI went here most recently just last weekend. It was a Saturday night around 7:30 and we were seated right away. They did forget our drink order and didn't bring it until after we reminded them (at which point the food had already arrived). But honestly, I really don't care so much about service as long as the food is good! And it once again lived up to all my expectations. On top of that, I had a vegetarian dish, two types of naan, a side of rice, and a glass for wine for $22. Hard to beat that in SF!

The Chicken Korma is creamy and tasty. The Butter Chicken is gross, probably because they grill the chicken beforehand and that normally delectable smoky taste just doesn't mix well with the butter, tomatoes and spices. The Chicken Biryani is one of the better ones I've had. I don't know if it's because I've made Chinese fried rice many times, but I always appreciate a well-cooked rice dish. Little Delhi's is fragrant, flavorful and delicious without being the slightest bit oily. And the portion is abundant.\n\nOn food alone, I'd probably give LD 3 stars.

I have to admit, when I saw this place from the street and walked in, uncertainty was at the forefront.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised.  The food was on par, very tasty, standard Indian fare.  Everything was screaming hot from the oven, washing away any GI concerns.  The spices were all there, and they didn't hold back on the heat, which for me is a plus.  My co-worker and I ordered about six dishes, and all were good.  The chicken in pistachio and cashew curry and the bengan bartha (eggplant) were my favorites.\n\nNow for the bummer.  The place is not well ventilated, so it was crazy hot in there.   When we asked the waiter how he was, he even said, \"hot.\"    It made the whole experience a little gruesome.   Outside, it was maybe 65 degrees.\n\nAt least the waiter was on point, and had a sense of humor.

Not only did I finally find it on my last day, I think I may have found the best Butter Chicken I've ever had! Not that my experience with Butter Chicken is that extensive. But it was bloody good regardless.\n\nI was walking from my cousins' apartment towards BART. I originally planned to go to Lahore Karahi because of their good Yelp reviews and the fact that they have Butter Chicken. I failed to realize that they are closed on Mondays. I then checked a couple of other Indian places around the corner from there. No luck.\n\nAll I can say is, thank God for Yelp! I found this charming little place as a last resort. I was seated and greeted by some very friendly staff. In addition to the Butter Chicken (have I said that enough yet?), I ordered some Garlic Naan and of course, Mango Lassi (it's almost a given for me). They also brought out some complimentary Papadum, which is like a huge tortilla chip (with accompanying dip).\n\nLet me tell you. I was in Butter Chicken heaven. There was no need for rice. I used every inch of that delicious Naan to soak up that amazing sauce. Unfortunately, I ran out of Naan before I ran out of sauce. Maybe that was a good thing because I was pretty full by that point. I saved my glass of Mango Lassi for the end. It was the perfect way to end a terrific meal and a fun and eventful San Francisco trip.", "author": "Paolo D."}

This restaurant looks like it used to be a diner. I really liked the mix of Indian decor with the diner undertones. \n\nWe ordered the aloo gobi, the badami chicken, chicken tikka masala, raita, garlic naan, rice pilaf, gulab jamun and chai tea.\n\nI loved everything we ordered. The prices were reasonable about $9-$12 a dish. The music was good and service friendly.\n\nIt's not as fancy as New Delhi so go here if you're looking for a more casual atmosphere.", "author": "Lori K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-02-12", "description": "I ate at Little Delhi in early December 2013. These are the points that clearly stand out in my mind; all else is unimportant.\n\nNOT FUN TO BE PASSED UP WAITING FOR YOUR FOOD:\nDefinitely call in to reserve or order take-out. It took a long time to sit down and a long time to get the main entr\u00e9e. In fact, people who ordered take-out were coming and going at a much faster rate. From our table, we could see the workers put together take-out orders faster than making orders for the people sitting inside their restaurant. Maybe if you are seated by the kitchen, avoid watching, because you will only be disappointed.\n\nNOT A GOOD PLACE TO GO WHEN IT'S BUSY\nGranted there was a conference going on, it was super busy...however there are many conferences held at the Moscone Convention Center, so they should be better prepared to handled a large influx of people on a week night. In my opinion, they looked like amateurs handling all the people. Maybe geophysical scientists have a broader taste palate and dare to venture out this far to get Indian food. \n\n50/50 HELPFULNESS\nWe spoke with the waiters/waistresses, asking about our drinks, silverware, appetizers, (we knew the entre wasn't coming out anytime soon). The male waiter was not helpful at all; you might as well be speaking to one of those good fortune porcelain cats that nod their heads and smile blankly. The female waitress was really the only one who actually helped us out. It wasn't clear who our waiter/waitress was, since both had come to our table with water or menus, etc.\n\nTHE ONE REDEEMING FACTOR: BUTTER CHICKEN\nThe food was okay. I usually prefer vegetarian dishes, so I usually avoid the butter chicken, however, this butter chicken was smokey, maybe cooked in the tandoori way, then added to the curry. It was great mixture. Very tasty and the definite winner at the table. \n\nPRICE: eh. I could find cheaper food for the same, if not better, quality elsewhere and the same can be said of nearly any place in San Francisco.\n\nThere are so many Indian restaurants in the Bay Area, that this one does not offer anything special. Maybe if you work or live in the area this would be the place for you. I would not feel compelled to eat at this particular restaurant when in San Francisco.", "author": "Poiuytrewq A."}

I came here with 2 friends for Saturday lunch and it was one of the best Indian meals I have had. We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Tandoori, Daal, on top of 3 garlic naans.\n\nAs a complementary dish, a few large pieces of big chips (not sure what they are called), were brought to us with 2 dipping sauces. A green and a red one. The green one was spicier and salty while the red one was sweet. It was fun to eat while we waited.\n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala was creamy and had tender chunks of chicken that were bathed in curry. We had the medium spiciness level, which was spicy but did not overpower its flavors. One of the best Tikka Masala's I've had. This dish goes perfectly with naan.\n\nNow for the Chicken Tandoori...WOW!!! I could hear it sizzling before it even came to our table! The thing was steaming even after 5-10 minutes. I cut into it and the chicken sizzled even more. Talk about fresh and piping hot, the way we all like it! The chicken was salty to taste, red in color (not sure what it was), and bedded on top of some grilled onions. I loved this dish. A definite recommend. [It also comes with a bonus salad. The salad dressing was sweet and the salad included some green peppers, tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, onions...it was pretty refreshing].\n\nLastly, the Daal came in a bowl. The lentils were cooked so nicely there was no need for teeth to enjoy this dish. I liked that there was a subtle sweetness to the curry. It was also delicious with the garlic naan.\n\nSpeaking of the garlic naan...I would eat this by itself without any curry. It was just that good. It was fluffy and generously coated with garlic. I thought this was a nice break from all the sodium-based dishes on the table.\n\nIf you're in San Francisco near Powell, stop here for a bite! Initially walking in the odors of the restaurant might be a bit overwhelming, but it'll pass quickly. Another to note is how attentive the service is. Enjoy!", "author": "Elina L."}

Butter Chicken, Chicken,Tikka Masala, Lamb Korma, Palak Paneer, Biryana, Naan, mango lassi... Oh and the Chicken Soup is lemony and unexpectedly addictive.

Little Delhi is conveniently located literally one block away from Powell Street Bart station. A great option to for lunch if you are shopping in the area.\n\nMy friend chose this venue as early dinner. I usually never crave Indian food, but I am not a picky eater. We ordered the following items: \n\n1) Butter Chicken, this is my first time trying this dish. I was not a fan. It tasted like grilled chicken slices in ketchup. The sauce was a little too tangy for my palette. This was the only meat fish we ordered. \n\n2) Vegetable Korma, my favorite dish from the rest. A bunch of veggies, from cauliflower, peas, potatoes and carrots in a creamy curry sauce. Veggies weren't mushy and had good texture. There was enough sauce to use as dipping sauce. \n\n3) Makhani something, this was also tasty. Cheese were tangy, savory. Will try this other Indian restaurants next time.\n\n4) Garlic and Regular nann. Flaky, warm, nicely cut into quarter pieces.\n\n5) Rice, I opted out for rice since I don't enjoy Indian rice. \n\nOverall the food was good, portions are a little small. There is absolutely no parking since this is a touristy area. Service was a little weird. The lady that took out order firstly didn't bring a note pad, so when she was repeating our order, we had to correct her over three times. It would have made her job easier if she just write down our order. Also, we were very stern on ordering 3 nanns and 1 rice because I am not a rice eater. But she kept in pressuring is to get more rice over nann. We were \"Oh it's okay, we want more nann than rice.\" But she kept pressuring us to get more rice. She responded \"You won't be able to finish the nann\" I thought this was a little odd.  We are usually not food wasters, but if we weren't ably to finish something there is always the option of packing it home.

Samosas are usually pretty standard so when a restaurant has extra tasty ones it's noteworthy. The Butter Chicken was straight FIRE! First off, they serve you up with a lot of chicken, unlike some other places that have mostly sauce. The chicken is nice pulled strips from I think the thigh, not chopped cubes of breast, so you get even more flavor. Finally, the chicken has a great smokey flavor from the tandoori. I wasn't impressed by the Matar Paneer, in fact I would pass on it. Matar Paneer is one of my favorite dishes and I would still pass for something else next time. It's good, but I've just had some mad fire Matar Paneer before so my standard for it is pretty high. The rice was good, had the standard flavor, nothing too amazing about it but it was on point. The Naan.... man you can tell it's super fresh because the texture was major key. Unlike some Naan that's often tough or rubbery, this Naan broke down nice when chewed. The value was great, at $31 bucks for the whole meal! I've been to a lot of places where that much food would run over 40, close to 50. Especially because it's in the middle of The City, I expected to pay much more. I was so impressed that I suggested to some folks across the street that were looking at the other Indian restaurant. Definitely check this place out if you like Indian food and are in the area.", "author": "Nick L."}

We ordered the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and shahi paneer. The butter chicken was the \"chef special\" and was more expensive than the chicken tikka (probably by $2-$3), they both tasted almost the same. The naan was soft and fluffy, and rice were good as well. Before your food comes they give you complimentary papad - which were kind of disgusting. Usually papad are crunchy, these were soggy and stale like they had been cooked a while ago and had just been sitting around. I don't care much for papad, but the rest of the food was amazing and the prices were decent. I would recommend this place if your in the area and craving Indian food.", "author": "Deepika S."}

A few weeks ago, I ordered some chicken tikka masala. I bit into a piece of \"chicken\" and there was a deep, earthy, then filthy taste.  It was a cockroach. \n\nI almost puked after this realization and am only now able to talk about it; I was so disgusted and horrified! \n\nI don't care how delicious your food is.  Cockroaches are absolutely unacceptable, and it appears this has been a problem at this establishment for some time.  \n\nLittle Delhi needs to revamp their cleanliness standards before I ever step foot here again.", "author": "Annie C."}

I went way out of my way to visit this place based on the incredible rating.  I really wanted to like it.  On top of it, I was quite hungry.\n\nI didn't see cockroaches as others did, but the place is dingy, dirty and has a third world feel.  In fact, I've eaten in cleaner restaurants in Cambodia.  The restrooms are terrifying.\n\nWhile fresh, the food (Aloo Saag) was bland, mushy and unappealing.  It may have had a couple of small pieces of potato but it was mostly bland, mushy spinach.  The portions, while fine for what I require, were substantially smaller than what I typically see for an entree serving.\n\nI absolutely hate it when an Indian restaurant charges for a serving of rice, and Little Delhi engages in this practice as well.  Toss a scoop of rice on my plate for pete's sake without dinging me $5 for a massive plate of rice I'll never finish.  Lastly, the Mango Lassi was small and not very good.\n\nI'll never return and I absolutely do not recommend this place to anyone.  I have no idea how a place like this could ever achieve such a high rating in a city as sophisticated as San Francisco.", "author": "Brian J."}

Well, every time I eat Indian food I have some crazy  nightmares. I'm sure it's something about the spices. But the medium-spicy chicken tikka masala was so fiery and burning that I am convinced all of my worst fears will manifest themselves in tonight's dreams. It's just that the flavor was so good that I couldn't stop eating it, even when my mouth was on fire and I was gulping down my Taj Mahal beer without even tasting it. Plus, we got this garlic naan that was the best I've ever had... more like an Italian garlic bread than the usual garlic naan I've tried. We also got some samosas which were HUGE and delicious as well. \n\nSo despite the extreme spiciness of my food, the super sketch neighborhood, and despite the fact that we had to work REAL hard to coax a smile out of our waiter, I can't in good conscience give this place any less than 4 stars as a true Indian food lover.", "author": "Christina P."}

We got two \"chef recommended\" items which were both good.  The lamb curry had wonderfully tender large chunks of lamb, and the curry yummy but nothing to write home about.  The butter chicken was your pretty standard creamy, delicious sauce with tender strips of chicken inside.  The garlic naan was superb with fresh herbs and plenty of garlic, although my friend said it wasn't as \"poofy\" as he would have liked it to be.\n\nI had the chicken tikka masala the next day for dinner (obviously we were greedy and ordered way too much), and while the chicken was a tad bit dry (possibly due to reheating), it was still delicious.\n\nOverall, extremely satisfying meal with good service.

BUt seeing that we were dying for ethnic food, our little iPhones gave us some suggestions, and told us to stop by LIttle Delhi.\n\nI had mixed feelings when I entered through the door; I was mildly intrigued about the history of the place, what with the diner counter configuration combined with the touches of Indian decorations all housed in a somewhat dilapidated commercial interior (heavily trafficked commercial carpeting,  drop ceiling acoustical ceiling tiles).

Of course there's a heaping plate of Basmati Rice, which we tend to finish and have to navigate our stomachs home to an uncomfortable night of 'Rice Belly'...\n\nWhile we had to order the Lamb Korma, we went a little different on our second dish, and decided to go for the Sag Paneer...\n\nNow the Sage Paneer is a Non spicy dish consisting of Spinach curry with cubes of an Indian cheese which has the consistency of Tofu, with the flavor that is just as light.  It's been a while since I had this dish, (mostly when I was in company of vegetarian friends) but it's a lighter of Indian fare and it's compliments the other heavy, creamier curries that we tend to favor..\n\nLIttle Delhi managed to deliver, their version of Sag Paneer was exactly as I had remembered and it met my expectations wonderfully.\n\nI think the one dish that we absolutely cannot do without is the Lamb Korma, the sweetness of this curry dish is unparalleled and the rich flavor that unfolds in waves of spices and cream make this the ultimate dish in our book.  What I don't get is that there isn't that much in terms of portions, but I'm always feeling full after I leave...I don't get it.. oh yeah the Rice... and the Naan, it's a carb comatose!\n\nIn any case, Little Delhi is a great place if you're a seasoned Indian cuisine enthusiast, and want something familiar and comfortable and if you can see yourself getting a little down and dirty, definitely this is the place for you!!!\n\nRatings (Out of Five Stars)\nFood                  3.5\nAmbience          2.75\nService              3", "author": "Alan M."}

When we walked in the interior smelled strongly of cleaner which was bit off putting, but we were seated right away and menus were placed in front of us. Water was also brought to us immediately which was great.\n\nWe decided to get the tandoori chicken, plain naan, and the Bengan Bharta (eggplant with peas, onions and tomatoes). Our waitress was very nice and helpful, and brought us a complimentary plate of papadum with two yummy sauces. I was pleasantly surprised that we received a free side salad with the tandoori (didn't read the menu that closely I suppose), and it was pretty yummy (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers). The tandoori wasn't what I was expecting; the flavor profile was a bit off and the color reminded me of Chinese BBQ pork. It didn't taste bad but it didn't taste how it was supposed to. The veggies under the chicken were yummy though, lots of onions and peppers. The plain naan was good but on its own it's a bit flat, so if you aren't going to dip it I recommend ordering garlic. My favorite dish was definitely the Bengan Bharta! So NOMMMM. It didn't look the most appetizing, but it had great flavor and tasted awesome with the naan. We ordered it mild so the spice was not killing our tastebuds. I would definitely order this again.\n\nI think we made a mistake ordering the tandoori, but since the eggplant dish was so yummy I have a hunch that some of the other curry dishes are legit... maybe we should have got the butter chicken or tikka masala...

Overall, its good quality Indian food. Loved the garlic naan, and in particular, the lamb korma was outstanding.\n\nThere was some inconsistency with the spiciness of the food. We were given the option of \"mild\", \"medium\", or \"spicy\". We were told \"spicy\" was the real deal, so got two dishes mild and the rest medium. The mild ones had zero spice, and the medium ones had a range, from mild to decently spicy.\n\nThe wait staff was friendly, and we had a nice dining experience. Little Delhi is like an Indian oasis in the middle of a very sketchy part of San Francisco --- lots of weirdos in this part of town.", "author": "Laurent L."}

I knew I had to try it then since I'm the one who weaned him onto Indian food in the first place. So if he said it was good, it had to be good. \n\nThe set-up inside is really nice and space-y. The first thing I noticed after we sat down was that it seemed like the place was run by non-Indian people. There was an older Chinese(?) man who seemed like the person in charge. Not too sure about that. Same thing with the waitresses too. But didn't matter in the end since the food was delicious! \n\nFirst off, they give you complimentary papadum with two dipping sauces. That was a bonus in itself since all the Indian places I've been too have never done that. It didn't hurt that it was so addicting to crunch on before our dishes came out. Also tried a mango lassi for the first time here. Apparently I've been missing out! (Would have liked it more cold though since I'm picky about my drinks like that). \n\nAs for the dishes....usually I would always order chicken tikka masala if I'm trying a new Indian place but the S.O. really wanted to order the lamb curry, and the butter chicken was really enticing so decided to save the CTM for next time. The lamb curry was good, but I'm not a huge fan of lamb itself so I didn't prefer it. I probably would have liked the dish more if the meat was substituted. The butter chicken on the other hand was AMAZING. I could not get enough of it. The sauce was flavorful and dipped in the garlic naan it was perfect. The chicken was also extremely tender. Definitely re-ordering this next time I go (along with the tikka masala since that seems to be pretty popular here too). \n\nFinished the meal very satisfied, thinking in my head that I haven't given a full five stars to a restaurant in a while....but then I saw a cockroach crawling around. I can't stand creepy crawlers so gotta knock off one star for that. Though the S.O. did say it wasn't anything surprising in this area. But otherwise, A+!", "author": "Jenny C."}

Their meat dishes have tender chunks of meat, something that doesn't happen enough at Indian restaurants in the city. My favorite is the butter chicken, which has generous slivers of silky chicken; the sauce is also creamy and particularly rich with flavor, but not too heavy. Another favorite is the aloo gobi, which actually has more than 50% cauliflower vs. mostly potato as with other places.\n\nOn top of all this, it's conveniently located a block from the mall and not too far into the Tenderloin.\n\nMy only qualm is their incessant use of their tamarind and mint sauces. They use it for some of their appetizers as sauces and it becomes too much when it's already served with the complimentary papadum that starts every meal.", "author": "Nicole L."}

Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those people who has no taste buds and has to ratchet everything up to 11 just to taste anything. I'm just a normal guy who likes things a bit flavorful. When I order a dish \"medium spicy,\" I want to taste a little bit of heat, but don't want to cry. Little Delhi gets it just right for my taste buds. My standard go-to dish here is the chicken tikka masala. I know, it's a totally boring dish but they just do it so well. The samosas and chana masala are also highly recommended.\n\nThe only downside to Little Delhi is that the service can sometimes be on the slow side. I've found that the hungrier I am, the slower it gets, so be prepared. I've never had a rude server or had my order messed up in any way, but it has been slow.

Maybe it's better in the restaurant instead.\n\nWe ordered a Friday-night working dinner, as a colleague and I were planning to stay in the office a little later. We put in for two entrees, a few sides, and some dessert, all ordered through GrubHub. Our estimated delivery time was about one hour. The restaurant, on receiving the order, added another ten minutes to this estimate. Acceptable, if a little long.\n\nThe delivery was nearly 30 minutes late on top of the amended estimate. Not acceptable.\n\nWhen we received our order, I made the mistake of not checking it for completeness, as an order of galub jamun was missing entirely. Furthermore, the entrees (chicken tikka masala and chicken vindaloo) did not come with rice, despite basically being stews. Many restaurants include rice as a standard item for such entrees, so it was strange seeing this omitted.\n\nIn defense of the restaurant, neither their GrubHub menu nor their own online menu make any mention of complimentary rice with entrees, so perhaps it was our mistake for assuming. On the other hand, in light of the prevalence of including rice with such entrees, it's probably worth noting somewhere on the menu.\n\nThe food was tasty and filling, certainly on par with other well-rated Indian restaurants, and arrived piping hot.

Instead of having the green chilis baked into the naan, I was given regular naan and a side dish of chopped chilis..\n\nThe service was quick and friendly.

New Delhi is, by far, the most intricate and jaw dropping flavor goodness that I have had in a loooooooooooooooooong time, with an endearing friend that boasts my loving devotion.\n\nFirst off, it's the ambiance. The professional and yet friendly services are executed in impeccable perfection. They might seem a bit distant with you, because they dont want to rush you; they're keen on giving you the time to think for yourself. Afterwards, if you can't get it straight, they'll gently give you their recommendations for their most magnificent dishes. \n\nBefore, they serve you with your orders, the complimentary deserts (chips and three kinds of sauce that I cannot remember for dear life), bursts pouches of love and appreciation on the fringe of your palate. Make no mistake, this is New Delhi, baby! \n\n Then comes the entree, veg. Pekoras! These are the most enticing little pieces of crispy and chewiness that you'll never forget in this lifetime. What's more? They actually don't serve the main dish unless you've told them to do so. And you'd better believe it, the paneer tikka masala that I've had is so sweet and savory that I'd want to camp out in N.D. for the rest of this lifetime. \n\nAlas! after the fun and festivity, it was time to say goodbye. Guess what? with 2 nans, paneer tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, veggie pekoras, and milk tea, it was only 40 bucks, for two! The proportion's humongous so you can actually take it to go. \n\nSo, what are you waiting for? If you're in the area, be sure to check them out!", "author": "Nanita L."}

I'm not going to knock down any specific restaurants, but the food from here has impressed me WAY more than any of the fancy/pricey Indian restaurants around here. My friends and I ordered a bunch of food from here from GrubHub, and had it delivered (right when they said they'd be there). \n\nWe Ordered:\n\n-Samosas: Incredible samosas that came with 2 dipping sauces (standard). I'm not sure what it's called, but the green dipping sauce was awesome. It was mildy spicy and went perfect with the samosas.\n\n-Papri Chaat: I didn't actually try this dish, but apparently it's like Indian nachos. My friend thinks its absolutely amazing, but I'm not a huge fan of garbanzo beans, yogurt, and chutney. For those that are, I'm sure you'd absolutely kill for this appetizer dish.\n\n-Chicken Tikka Masala: I've had CTM many times, and always love it. It's probably the most popular dish ordered in any Indian restaurant in America. I was feeling very vegetarian when we ordered, so I decided not to try it this time. However, I heard it was delicious from my friends, and the entire thing was gone pretty fast. The sauce is perfect for dipping your naan in.\n\n-Aloo Matar: This was my vegetarian selection of the meal. I absolutely loved it and ate mostly all of it. This dish is a tomato based curry sauce, with peas and potatoes. Really yummy, and full of flavor. Also extremely filling, and the tomato curry was excellent with my garlic naan.\n\n-Plain & Garlic Naan: Fluffy, fresh, hot naan. What more can I say? Perfection.", "author": "Ashley D."}

We left happy customers! There were three of us, one friend who had never tasted Indian food. I described to our friend the taste of Indian food as having a flavorful party in your mouth! At Little Delhi, we ordered one order of Samosas, Chicken Tandoori, Daal, Aloo Gobi, basmati rice, and regular and garlic naan. We requested the dishes to be spicy. All had the perfect amount of spice except Daal, which is a lentil dish. Daal was delicious, but the spiciness came out in full effect with a delay of a min or so. There was more than enough food for the three of us. The food was authentic comparable to the restaurant Flavor of India in West Hollywood, CA. \n\nWe would recommend Little Delhi to other yelpers who are open to the experience of a flavorful meal.", "author": "Melissa J."}

Absolutely hands down great curries, everyone we've brought or have had try their food has loved it and wanted more.\n\nBest dish by far is their badami chicken - it's a rich curry sauce made up of cashews and pistachios and is great for sopping up with a side of hot puffy naan. Their basic naan is nice and fluffy but definitely try the cottage cheese version at least once. The lamb korma and chicken rasala are also favorites.\n\nTheir vegetarian dishes are good but I don't think they really compare to the meat dishes. The tandoori can sometimes be too dry and you can sometimes find bones in your food.\n\nThe mango lassi is thicker and sweeter than others but it's definitely good and great with their spicy selections. Also, spicing can be weird as at times the medium will either be mouth watering hot or quite mild.", "author": "Sam H."}

But the gravy was really rich and really really tasty. The paneer was well cooked and had taken up a lot of the flavors from the gravy\n- Ordered the Okra - this dish was also really tasty! Spicyness level on this was perfect. It was a dry dish compared to the paneer one, so it worked well to have one of each type in our meal. Although it was really tasty, they could've eased up on some of the grease in the okra. I'm sure it would've tasted fine with a little less oil.\n- Good portion size - we had leftovers even though the two of us who shared our meal were starving and ate a lot! \n\nCons:\n- Unsatisfactory service - our food took almost 40 min to arrive! All the people sitting next to us who came in after we did got their food first. Waiting for that long was a little frustrating since we were so hungry! And no one came by to apologize for the wait even after we asked for the waiter three times!\n- Ambiance -definitely nothing different or unique. There's a LOT of red all around you, and the whole restaurant feels a little stuffy due to lack of good ventilation.\n\nOverall, from my past experience, I don't expect great ambiance from Indian restaurants, and rarely does that factor into my decision to go back to an Indian restaurant.

Doing a little brainstorming with my brain and stomach somewhat internally communicating, I thought of Indian. I found Little Delhi to have the highest ratings in walking distance and went.\n\nThe restaurant is casual, rectangular and long shaped. When we dined here, it was way too warm inside, making it a little uncomfortable. I'm not sure how the workers run around in there. \n\nService here could be better - servers forget what you ask for, and it takes awhile for them to come to you or bring your requests to them. Other than that, the food here is really good.\n\nWe ordered Samosa, the Assorted Tandoori Platter (which came with fish, lamb, and chicken - all Tikka), Vegetable Korma, White Basmati Rice, and Naan. \n\nFirst off, I really liked the bread chips that they serve to you pre-meal. They looked like wheat chips with grains toasted into them and was accompanied by the green and red sauces, very nice since I usually don't get a pre-appetizer at Indian restaurants. The Samosas were okay - they're on the bigger side, which is fine, but also on the drier side. The Assorted Tandoori Platter was great, however, we still enjoyed the chicken the most - lamb and fish were great tasting but prepared Tikka style, chicken is the way to go. Basmati Rice and Naan were freshly made and very tasty. Lastly, I LOVED their Vegetable Korma - consistency/texture/and taste were perfect. Little Delhi's Korma is probably the best that I've tried.\n\nOverall, great Indian restaurant - on the pricier side, but food is good.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

We ordered garlic naan, raita, and rice on the side (though I don't get how the staple food like rice doesn't come with but I guess those days are ending).  We ordered lamb saag medium spicy cuz I was feeling kind of wimpy and chana aloo (chickpeas stewed with potatoes) hot and spicy and it really wasn't as fiery as I'd feared.  Our waiter even asked us at the end of the meal if we noticed much of a difference, which we both did but pleasantly so.

Such is the reason why my friends and I always come here whenever we're craving some bomb Indian food. \n\nOpting to order family-style, some of the popular dishes that we always get are the chicken tikka masala (don't pronounce it mal-SALSA like I did; you might get an awkward look from the waitress), the shrimp korma and the lamb vindaloo.

Well, when asked if I want good or bad news first, I tend toward the latter, so here goes: Cold. They don't have a waiting area and because the restaurant is so small, people would come in, look to their right and left for some help all while standing in the doorway and unwittingly letting in the brisk SF air. Now, is that really the business's fault? Not really, but it certainly lends a \"cold air\" to the experience and makes dining here a little less pleasant. \n\nNext, meh service. Sure, my water glass was refilled every so often, but only when it had been parched for a while and almost always done so with a sort of reluctance from the waiter. Good thing the \"medium spicy\" was tipped more towards mild, otherwise there was great potential for suffering. \n\nHowever, there are plenty of pros to the place. Tasty food with especially thick and satisfying naan, nice decor, clean and organized setting. The staff was also very nice about my friend's birthday and presented with a large bowl of delicious mango ice cream, topped off neatly with a single candle. \n\nFor what it's worth, I think dining here is a fair value.

In the past 5 or so times I've been here, I'd never thought much of it (except one time they never refilled my water) until recently when I got caught in an unexpected downpour on my way over and the waitress very kindly offered me a warm towel. \n\nFood: Decent. As a vegetarian I generally get the veggie special. It's two different dishes with rice, some side salad, and naan for like 5.99 (seriously, it's a great price for what you get). But in my experience, the food has just been alright. It's been tasty enough but never delicious. \n\nBottom line: If I wasn't influenced by friends in the area, I don't know if I would've come back here after the first time.

The place as a whole is pretty casual, with a bunch of tables spread throughout, and there are even some booths along the walls/windows too.  The place was pretty filled when I walked through the door, and I saw that my friends had already perched themselves on a couple of stools at the counter, which just furthered the whole diner idea in my head.  All they need is a ticket carousel in the window, a bell to ring for pick up, and an older woman who calls everyone \"sweetie\" and \"hun\" to complete the whole concept.\n\nI wasn't able to there when our order went in due to parking issues (more on that in a second), but my friend that had recommended the place ended up ordering for my other friend and I since he knew what dishes to get.  Fortunately for us, he has good taste...haha.\n\n- Regular naan - It was...well, pretty damn regular.  Really soft, and not dried out or overly floured, but too plain for my liking.  I would have preferred garlic naan just to give it a twist, but I guess it didn't really matter too much since I just ended up dipping it into the sauces instead.\n\n- Lamb Tikka Masala - first time having it with lamb instead of chicken, but I liked it.  A little gamey being lamb, but still within what I'm okay with.  The spiciness level, on the other hand, can definitely get up there after a while.  Between that and the strong flavors in the sauce, this dish will definitely wake up your taste buds.  Makes Naan N Curry's sauce look pretty pedestrian in hindsight.\n\n- Butter Chicken - a little spicy on its own, but defintely not to the level of the Lamb Tikka Masala.  I think if we didn't get the LTM, I would probably be talking about the kick on this one.  In a way, think of this as the \"light\" version - not as spicy, not as potent spice was, but still a quality dish.  \n\n- Badami Chicken - probably my favorite of the three we had.  Definitely pretty mild spice wise, but really flavorful.  I really liked the creamy curry sauce and the cashews that they drop in...went really well with the naan/rice, and I think it was a perfet counter to the spiciness of the other two.\n\nAfter reading some reviews, it seems that the food has generally been solid, but the service is a bit questionable.  For us, things were fine, but I'm sure a large part of that is because we sat at the counter and had workers pass by us often.  But yeah, the only reason why I had to round down from 4.5 stars is that parking around here is HORRENDOUS.  Slotted between Union Square and SF Center on one side and the TL on the other, pickings get a bit slim.  Well, maybe just for me at least.  It's not that there weren't spaces in the TL, just that why would I want to park there when I can park on the other side of the restaurant?  Maybe I should have though...ended up getting to the restaurant about 30 minutes late after circling for a good 45 minutes for a street spot.  And I still ended up paying for a lot space...FAIL.  Oh well, I'll be back regardless, just maybe I'll have someone drive me next time.  Woohoo!", "author": "Mike L."}

This bright orange curry also contains crunchy green pepper and onion slices, and chunks of chewy paneer.\n\nAlso notable, the samosas. But if you're looking for an exemplary appetizer, go for the papri chaat. I refer to papri chaat as indian nachos: a crunchy mix of chips, potatoes, and a mix of chutneys and sauces.\n\nAs a final reminder, forego boring white rice and order the biryani.

You know it's the place to be when you see lines and lines of Indian families waiting outside on a Sunday night in the cold SF weather to be seated. It's a little cramped here on weekend evenings, so be sure to call for a reservation or get there before 7pm. \n\nI've been here twice in less than two months because I can't turn to any other restaurant for Indian cuisine. I highly, highly recommend the Samosas to start off with. Get the Butter Chicken Curry and the Shrimp Curry for your main dish. One dish is good for two people. The Butter Chicken Curry is a tomato-based curry with really flavorful spices while the Shrimp Curry is a coconut, yellow based curry. Both are rich and delicious! I couldn't decide which bread to get (Roti, Poori, or Naan) so I tried all three. YUM. The original Roti is still my favorite because the Garlic Naan was too much for my curry and the Poori (deep-fried) was too oily for my taste. \n\nThe service was also very good.

This Indian resto is a stone's throw from my office and seriously addictive - I've nary been here a month and have already been back four times. The key to service that doesn't suck is to avoid the morning/lunch hours. Apparently curry is on everyone's mind from the moment they wake?\n\nBeing onion-averse I rarely reach for samosas but the ones doled out here are the NUTS. Quite spicy and a large serving ($3.99) that was difficult to share because they were so tasty.\n\nNow onto my latest obsession: Veggie Malai Kofta ($7.99). At a group lunch it was impossible to pry this plate away from me. I shouted \"no\" (maybe too loudly) to the option to share my dish with my tablemates. Cottage cheese stuffed in vegetable balls with mildly spicy curry cream. Ugh, my waistline is expanding as we speak. It's definitely not calorie conscious, but I'd be willing to log 100 mile weeks just to get a regular dose of it. Sop it all up with some naan ($1.50), which is generously portioned. I've begun skipping rice in favour of naan and that keeps it under $15. \n\nHave also sampled the Dal Makhani ($6.99) and Aloo Matar ($7.99) as well as Aloo Tikki ($3.99) instead of samosas for an appetizer. My only gripe is that I can't seem to get them to obey my spice demands - spicy just isn't spicy enough. I want to mimic the effects of a neti pot when I'm eating, cool?\n\nAs is customary at Indian restaurants, they bring you a complimentary plate of pappadums and various chutneys to start, but I'm not a fan of unidentified condiments so I never partake. Also, if at any point your water glass is empty, one hundred baby owls are ceremoniously decapitated before your eyes.*** \n\nGo here, and say hi when you see me lurking alone in the corner gorging on malai kofta, mmkay? \n\n** \u2122Shari M: http://tinyurl.com/25zu7hf\n***Not actually, but it seems like the threat of it looms, as the staff REFUSES to allow your water level to get too low.

RAWR!\n\nI am always a bit skeptical of Indian restaurants because I used to run a swank one in Los Angeles. The food was excellent and the chef was simply fantastic, so I was quite spoiled. \n\nI am SO happy to write that my experience at Little Delhi was very, very good - especially since the kitchen was kind enough to make a dish for me that they do not normally offer on the menu.\n\nWhat I had: plain Basmati rice, Lamb Makhani, Gulab Jamun and a Mango Lassi\n\nThe rice was cooked very precise. Basmati rice has to be prepared by soaking and should be cooked a bit al dente. The perfect Basmati rice separates from each other, and Little Delhi's is actually PERFECT. \n\nThe lamb makhani was so ridiculously good that I want a bowl now as I am reminded. Makhani is actually the masala sauce with cream and butter added - ask for this and you won't be disappointed! The spices were spot on and whoever their chef is added just the right touch of cream and butter. I have to say though, the amount of meat in the curry was very little. I must have gotten 4-5 small chunks and I found myself scouring the sauce to find another piece of lamb.\n\nThe Gulab Jamun was delish, but their syrup was a taaaaaad bit too sweet for me - I still ate everything though because it was still THAT good.\n\nFrom a strict BUSINESS ($$$) PERSPECTIVE - the restaurant d\u00e9cor itself is not my favorite, but hey - I guess it's not bad either. As listed on the restaurant's website \"Vinyl booths line the walls, and except for the smell of curry, this could be a diner.\"  Well, that's a fact, but I think for as good as the food is, the half-assed diner/Indianesque atmosphere actually takes away from the experience. \n\nI am going to make an assumption and write that this was done to save money from having to invest on remodeling when the joint was purchased, but I think at a certain point in time, they should \"Indian\" the place or go all-out with the diner d\u00e9cor. Currently, it feels a bit confused in there. With that said, I'm going to have to say this place gives the impression of a hole-in-the wall. It's a shame because there is so much potential for it to compete with its swanky restaurant neighbors. Their cuisine IS authentic and the location is on one of the busiest corners of Union Station. \n\nFrom a PERSONAL perspective - I really do like the unpretentious atmosphere and can see locals liking this aspect of it, plus the current menu prices are ridiculously affordable for such food that takes much time in preparation and cooking. It would of course shoot up if they were ever to swank up.\n\nOverall - GO and if you love Indian food, you will NOT be disappointed.", "author": "Korinna P."}

We tried the green salad, chicken tikka masala, okra, plain naan, garlic naan, mango lassi, and lamb vindaloo. We asked for the tikka masala medium and I think that made them tone down the vindaloo which was too bad.

The food is extremely tasty, and they have an excellent selection. The portions are good, they don't skimp on good ingredients, and prices are decent. If you're a veggie, there's a superb dry (i.e. non-curry) paneer dish that's served sizzling and, which I have not found anywhere else.\n\nBeware, if you ask for your curry spicy here (in a confident tone) it will burn your mouth.\n\nUnlike a lot of the other Indian/Pakistani restaurants in the Tenderloin, Little Delhi has table (i.e. waiter) service.

I guess this place might be a good choice for groups or people not very experienced with Indian or spicy foods.\n\nThe location is just terrible for parking unless you happen to be taking BART or are already in the area.\n\nThe original Little Delhi on Jones was actually my favorite all time place to eat at.  It was run by the sweetest couple (Kamal & Nimi) in the tiniest hole in the wall you could imagine.  The food was amazing, but then they closed down over 10 years ago.\n\nWhen they reopened on Eddy, I was so excited to see my favorite chef in the kitchen.  For the first few months, the food was similar to the original Little Delhi, but the service was terrible.  \n\nThe cook remembered me and said he'd make anything I wanted from their old menu, but the waiter refused to take any \"unusual\" orders.  I found the staff cold and closed off and completely uninterested in providing me food I wanted to eat.  \n\nAfter several attempts at trying to enjoy this restaurant, recipes were drastically changed and I noticed my favorite cook was no longer working there which saddened me deeply.  \n\nThe menu became more \"Americanized\", the food became relatively bland and the bowls became smaller.  Butter chicken even had a BBQ flavor??  (I hope they've changed that.)  I kept going back every 6 months or so hoping the original chef would return, but it never happened.\n\nYou may think I am being overly critical, but you would be too if you ate food from Kamal, the master of the spices.\n\nWith this review I am finally closing my book on Little Delhi.

The food is always mediocre but it's close and cheap, I went there yesterday and food was unacceptable. I ordered chicken tikka masala from the \"lunch specials\" menu, it's a pretty basic dish you really can't go wrong - I also ordered samosa and decided to try the chai tea (because i LOVE chai!!) It was a to go order, I asked the man taking my order if I could substitute the salad that comes with the lunch special for dahl soup - he said no and that the lunch menu is very specific and substitution is not allowed, I asked him to add dahl soup, which I would pay for and no salad, to which he still responded with no. So once my order was ready I left and could not wait to dip my naan in the masala sauce! Except, when I got back to my lunchroom - they did not give me any naan! They also did give me soup but it wasn't dahl soup - it was what appeared to be \"chicken soup\" but it looked and tasted like baby food. The samosa was room temperature - not heated or warm at all. The chai tasted like warm milk. However - I had a great realization - their food sucks!!! Without having naan to dip and mask they horrible taste of their food I realized how truly gross and crappy their food is. It's not flavorful at all. So, in short - save yourself the trouble and don't go here. The dude is mean, he's dishonest (because he told me no several times and then gave me soup anyway - kinda an a-hole thing to do) and their food is just not worthy of anyone's time.

After reading a bunch of reviews saying this restaurant has great Indian food, I had to set the record straight.  I have eaten at numerous restaurants around the world and tasted amazing and bad indian, and I have to say the dishes at Little Delhi fall under the not very good category.\n\nWe had the saag paneer, lamb curry, chicken tika masala, and fish tandoori.  These dishes for me are the basic dishes any good indian restaurant should excel at.\n\nThe saag paneer tasted exactly like frozen spinach with cheese, the lamb curry was bland, and the fish tandoori way overcooked.  The only saving grace was probably the tika masala sauce.\n\nThe rice is a bland white rice pilaf and the naan super doughy. \n\nOverall I will never return to this restaurant and advise you to reconsider before you go.", "author": "Carnet W."}

That's a lot of Indian food for someone who doesn't like Indian food. Lucky for me, all of it was tasty and NOT heavy, the main reason why I stray away from such cuisine. \n\nThe lamb was cooked perfectly and the portions were very generous. The sauces were highly flavorful--I mean, a merciless explosion of flavor right there in your poor little defenseless mouth! The mixture of spices were complex enough to make me crave it long after I had finished eating the mound of leftovers I brought home with me (remember the generous portions?). \n\nThe naans were equally (relatively) light. I wish the garlic naan was more garlicky. It had been the first time I tried keema naan, and that naan is a meal in itself. \n\nThe service was good--we had a complementary appetizer before our meal. But I felt like that appetizer was necessary because of the long wait before all of our food came out. \n\nOverall, though, the food was great! I left feeling stuffed but still mobile.

The papadums were also some of the best papadums I've had, although the little side sauces that come with the papadums weren't anything special.

The meat itself was average and the vindaloo sauce was spicy but otherwise ordinary.  \n\nThe building/decor was mediocre, as was the service and the crowd - perhaps because I showed up on the later side of a Saturday night.

I personally do not favor indian food much, but with my out of town visitor asking for it, and my previously selected thai spot closed for lunch, I gave in and yelped this place.  I thought that all indian food was similar to that yellow curry (which I despise), but found the menu to be pretty diverse.  That is, until your food arrives.  Maybe I'm just not good at selecting indian food, but I swear that everything we ordered looked exactly the same and tasted very similar (aside from the tikka masala that everyone on here raves about).  \n\nFor four people, we ordered garlic naan, garlic roti, chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, chicken tikka kabob, and bhoona shrimp.  Everything was pretty good, but the portions are quite small.  The chicken tikka kabob probably had the most meat, but everything else we ordered was pretty much like 5 or 6 little chunks of meat and a lot of sauce.  We pretty much had to fill up by eating the breads and dipping them into the sauces.  Im not sure if thats typical with Indian food, but in any case, the food was pretty good.  If I had to pick one thing to not order again, it would probably be the lamb.  With the amount of spices and sauce, you cant even really tell if its lamb anymore.  haha.  The tikka masala and garlic naan lived up to expectations, and I will definitely order those items again if I come back here.\n\nParking here is horrible, and its all street parking pretty much.  The meters are 1 hour meters for $3.50 and hour!!!  Better make sure you have a roll of quarters ready and eat fast!  Your best bet might be to visit here after/while shopping at the mall across the st, while your car is parked in some garage, or you'll have to leave in the middle of your meal to put quarters in the meter, while some homeless guy asks for change and you awkwardly tell him no while throwing quarters into the meter slots.

Located in a very un-appetizing part of SF and flanked on either side by Indian and Pakistani restaurants, Little Delhi treats you with Big Flavors. They do a good job at regulars like Chicken Tikka Masala but also serve kebabs sizzler style, which is great. Their outstanding contribution to showcase their Indian Street Food roots is the Nimbu Pani (Indian Lemonade) that blasts your palate with spicy/tangy/sweet flavors reminiscent of Thirst Quenchers served on the streets in India during summer. The black salt used in the lemonade acts as its badge of honor. The rotis/naan's were fresh but the biryani was a major let down. Anyone specifically looking for great biryanis please stick to south bay as SF lacks a Biryani House, altough the Shalimars and Pakwaans give Awadhi & Sindhi style of Biryani a good shot they still lack the technical finesse needed.  A quick list of biryani's are as follows:\nLucknowi (Awadhi) biryani \nHyderabadi biryani\nSindhi biryani\nBombay Biryani\nCalcutta biryani\nAmbur Biriyani\nVaniyambadi Biryani\nBhatkali biryani\nMemoni biryani\nMalabar Biriyani\nDindigul Biriyani\nThallapakatti biryani\nBeary Biryani\n\nHowever, they can broadly be classified as Kacchi Biryani (meat and rice cooked in the raw together) & Pakkhi Biryani (meat and rice cooked seperately). Biryani's in SF are mostly Pakkhi Biryanis. If you need the Kacchi Biryani's try Paradise Biryani Pointe in Santa Clara or Peacock Restaurants that are present all over the Bay Area. The meat is mostly never organic, you will be let down if you prefer organic meat.", "author": "Akshay K."}

What a wonderful decision.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean, quiet, with Indian music videos quietly playing in the background on a big LCD TV hanging high on the wall aimed down the long dining area.  You could hear it, but it wasn't intrusive.  Especially nice was the red upholstery, giving the place a sumptuous feel - the gold painted walls, though, were a bit cheesy.  A homemade touch was the outline of India done in US Pennies!\n\nService was polite, quick, courteous.  The wait staff knowledgeably answered my questions about the menu with a smile.  I heard them speaking Hindi to other customers, so that was a good sign, eh?\n\nAnd then the food.  I ordered Sweet Lassi, Onion Kulcha, Samosa, Chicken Tikka Masala, Aloo Mattar, Galub Jamun.\n\nThey brought out Papad with Tamarind and Mint sauces.  The lentil wafers were crispy and fresh, and the sauces were full of flavor - the mint sauce had quite a bite to it, and the tamarind sauce was delightfully fruity and had the perfect \"coat the spoon\" thickness, not watery at all.\n\nNext came the Sweet Lassi, which had the sweet-tart flavor one expects from a yogurt drink.  It was cool, but not cold, which was good.  The only complaint was that it seemed a bit small for the price - served in an footed Irish Coffee mug.\n\nSamosas were fresh, hot, crispy, the potatoes inside tender, not rubbery, and nicely spiced.  The bed of chickpeas were tender, fresh, and perfectly cooked.  I attacked the chickpeas with gusto.\n\nThe menu says they put saffron in the rice, but if they do, I didn't see (or smell) it.  It was pretty much plain, basmati rice - cooked well, but ordinary.\n\nThe main dishes came out next.  The chicken tikka masala: the chicken had that slightly smoky flavor that grilled chicken should have, which was perfectly matched by the creamy sauce.  That sauce had that delightful texture: both thick and creamy, a gorgeous deep orange color, and the intense but not-too-hot curry flavor one wants in a tikka masala.  The sauce was so good I kept dipping the kulcha into it even after the chicken was gone.\n\nThe Aloo Mattar: I ordered it \"medium\" spicy, because it was my first time in the place and I that always seems prudent.  Medium was a good level for this dish.  Peas and Potatoes are both very mild flavors by themselves, and the tomato-curry sauce had a medium level of bite to it.  Next time, I could order this much spicier, though.\n\nThe onion kulcha was obviously fresh, tender with just a hint of cripsy crust. The onions were very flavorful and slightly sweet.\n\nFinally the Galub Jamun - the outer shell was tender, the inside was still hot from cooking.  But that honey and rose-water syrup made me weep for joy.  It was a thin syrup, not heavy and cloying, and the dish was topped with crushed pistachios. \n\nIt was a $29 meal, plus tip, and I gave slightly more than 20% - it was totally worth it.", "author": "Paul B."}

Welcome to the tenderloin. \n\nIndians are known less for their courage and more for their mind-boggling frugalness. So what keeps me, and hundreds of other super-cheap paranoid melodramatic Indians, walking through the hospitable streets of the tenderloin just to eat at a relatively pricy Indian food joint?\n\nIt's the classic Bollywood songs from the 70s, instead of trashy techno mixes. It's the welcoming free cup of chai, instead of the free whiff of B.O. It's the waiters who make sure you're enjoying the food, instead of making sure you don't leave without paying.

After a long day of exploring the mean street of San Francisco in the pouring rain, I found myself craving Indian Food for some odd reason. So I happened to stumble upon Little Delhi and decided to give it a shot. All I have to say is that I am glad I did because this was some of the best Indian Food I had experienced in quite some time. I ordered the Lamb Masala and some Keema Naan. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. The Lamb Masala had plenty of tender lamb cooked in a sweet yet subtly spicy creamy coconut curry. The Keema Naan was also awesome. First of all the Naan was so soft and warm. It almost seemed to melt in your mouth. They stuffed the Naan with minced meat onions and this dish is packed with an extraordinary amount of flavor. All I have to say is that you wont be disappointed by either of these dishes. I also love Little Delhi because the prices were reasonable and service was fairly quick. So next time I visit San Francisco I will definitely be stopping into Little Delhi and I suggest you do the same.", "author": "Wesley C."}

So, usually with long waits, you think that the food would turn out to be extraordinary, but it wasn't. It was your standard naan and chicken tikka masala.

Still running on my post-dinner high, I would like to add my comments about the place.\n\nMy husband and I got the chicken tikka masala, seekh kabob (lamb kabobs), and vegetable korma with garlic naan for dinner.  Everything was absolutely excellent, but the vegetable korma really blew us away.  I have always had a hard time finding an indian restaurant that delivers on its vegetarian dishes (having grown up with my very own five star pakistani chef, my mom, you can see why this is so difficult for me), but this dish has quickly become mine and my husband's new favorite dish.  \n\nThe garlic naan has minced garlic and cilantro cooked right on top of it, and comes out piping hot and soft yet still a little crispy - just the way I like it.  It's the perfect combination for scooping up the perfect bite of curry.\n\nWe got some chai and the mango kulfi for dessert, and if you haven't tried kulfi yet, you must!  If you like the consistency of gelato, you will like kulfi.

I come here often, as I have a friend who is obsessed with the joint. The service is friendly and attentive and the food is decently priced- not too different from any other Indian restaurant in the area. I personally think their chai is the best- which it better be, considering that it isn't free (though refills are). It is inevitable that I will be returning, at the very least for the chai. I also think that, out of the Indian restaurants nearby, they have the best interior ambiance.", "author": "Daniel F."}

So I call the restaurant AGAIN and this time I am told that there is traffic.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-11-14", "description": "It's possible the fact that I'm a fucking idiot is part of the reason I enjoyed Little Delhi so much. I boarded a plane while slightly hungry in Orlando, planning to eat three hours later when I arrived in San Francisco. For whatever reason I ignored all common sense and logic and did not count for the time change. I knew it was a six hour flight, but for whatever reason that knowledge left my mind nuggets the day the flight came.\n\nSo yes. I was hungry. I was really, really hungry. You know those sad kids you see on TV who haven't eaten in weeks? Ok, so it wasn't that bad, but for a spoiled American that eats often, I was pretty damn hungry. After checking into the hotel ran a yelp search for Indian food. Filters... Are... Wonderful. I filtered for places within 4 blocks, by rating, and most importantly, currently open. Little Delhi was at the top of the list, and it did not take long to find out why.\n\nI'm an expert at a long of things. Confusing people... Yelling at traffic... Knowing exactly where the beef is... I'm not, however, an expert on Indian food. I have it at most a few times a year, but for some reason when I arrived in San Francisco it was the first thing I wanted to try. That being said, Little Delhi is now this total non-expert's favorite Indian restaurant.\n\nGet-out-standing.\n\nBased on the reviews, I was concerned there was going to be a wait, but at 8:30 I was able to walk in and be seated immediately. I ordered the naan, the lamb rasala, and a side of rice.\n\nWhile waiting for my food, they brought a plate of that crispy, crackery, flat, and sort of tasteless, ummm. I don't know what it is. I've had it before. Let's call it cracker paper. Anyhoo, they brought a plate with a bunch of cracker paper plus 3 sauces and an itty-bitty-teenie-weenie-non-yellow-polka-dotted spoon. It was cute. Cracker paper, as I mentioned, is slightly tasteless, but the sauces they brought on were very tasty. They seemed to range from levels of spicy, from \"sorta-spicy\" to \"mostly spicy\". Nothing outrageous. It was nice to snack on while waiting for my...\n\nOh my. Here's the food. There were the right number of dishes, but it really felt like there was too much food. Again, being an American I felt challenged to finish it, and I came very close. The lamb rasala, which was lamb cooked in coconut curry, was absolutely punch you in the dick good. The large pieces of lamb were so incredibly tender and had soaked up all of that amazing coconut curry. My one complaint was that while it was marked on the menu as being spicy I really couldn't pick up on any spice. The taste though made up for that by a wide margin. The rice, was quite good, but I couldn't tell much of a difference from rice I've had at other Indian restaurants. It was great though to use as a bedding for the curry. And finally, we come to the naan. I've had good naan, and I've had great naan. In this instance, I imagine there's a magical unicorn flying around who drops this naan from the clouds above. It was perfectly soft while keeping it's structure during lamb curry pickup. Even while on my third piece, the naan was so hot it practically burned my hands. Not a bad thing. The top, and I'm not sure if this is common because I've never had it like this before, was oh-so buttery, which I imagine had a lot to do with my love for it. I'm definitely a \"would you like bread with your butter\" kind of person.\n\nThe service was excellent, the food was amazing, and the cost ($11 for the lamb, $2 for the rice, and $1.50 for the super naan) was way reasonable. Little Delhi... Please come to Little Orlando.", "author": "James D."}

The flavor and spices melted together and the lemon on top gave it extra zest.\n\nMaybe I missed this, but I wish they had a platter or something that has a mix of dishes because we had to order everything separately which ended up being way too much food.

Not a very fancy establishment, but we appreciated the music videos playing on the flat screens. So many dance ensembles! So many creepy old male popstars serenading hot young Indian babes! Great conversation fodder.\n\nAs to the food, let's get on with it. The verdict? Tasty! The Veggie entree was quite good, and the food was prepared at our desired level of spiciness. The portions are decent for the price, the rice in particular is enough for four to share, so we had plenty left over. The Naan was soft and fluffy, hot to the touch, and very garlicky-good. Great for sopping up the sauces. \n\nThe wait staff was very good about checking on us often, refilling our waters regularly, and otherwise being very attentive. Good service!\n\nTwo of us ate with substantial amounts of food left over for $27, including a soda. There are no refills on the sodas and the flavors were good if not out of this world, so I'm tagging this with 4 out of 5 stars. Little Delhi is a good choice for Indian food in the Union Square area, and I'm looking forward to trying out other menu options. We'll be coming back.", "author": "Gerald V."}

I know what you're thinking, and I'm not a senior citizen, but when you have a starving shopping companion, you gotta eat, when you gotta eat. Anyway! We chose this place based on yelp reviews. To be 100% honest, the outside appearance was a huge turn off. It looked a bit grimy, and because of the window coverings it also looked empty: Strike one and two. Who wants to eat at an empty restaurant? We forge ahead, despite the ominous appearance and I was quite surprised. The decor wasn't stellar, but it was better than expected, given the outside. One cool feature was the bar wall art, which was a mellow yellow color and lit from the back.. it looked really cool. They also played Indian music videos, which is always a good time.\n\nNow to the food. We ordered the garlic naan, tikka masala, samosas, and some lamb stew, oh and the peas rice. The samosas arrived immediately and were devoured. The order came with two, but in my humble opinion you can never serve too many samosas. We were on a roll, samosas eaten, music videos playing...and then nothing. While the servers were fast to refill our water, we waited 25 minutes for our main courses. I know I should be patient, but given the popularity of the tikka masala, wouldn't they just make it in bulk and spoon it out when needed? Suffice to say, my friend and I were starving like Marvin by the time the rest of the dishes arrived. The garlic naan was fluffy and chewy and delicious. The tikka was..eh..I've had better. I don't eat lamb, but my friend seemed satisfied. If I had to do it again, I'd order the samosas and the naan and have carbo feast, without having to wait forever.", "author": "E.J. H."}

I don't remember which shrimp dish I had for my entree, it wasn't too memorable.\n\nThe second time, the service was still mediocre, but the food was worth the wait.

I ordered samosas, garlic naan, vegetable biryani, and vegetable pakora. Absolutely wonderful. I placed the order on-site, and the wait wasn't very long. They had me waiting at the bar, and served me free chai tea while I waited, which was delicious. The staff chatted with me while I waited, and it seemed to be a pretty busy place, but it wasn't packed, which is a good sign.

My office conference room's ambiance can best be described as generic corporate. Marble conference table, black leather chairs, expansive view of Market Street. Good drink selection. \n\nAs for the food, PLEASE be aware that Little Dehli IS NOT SCREWING AROUND when they discuss with you how hot you'd like the food to be. My coworkers and I (misery loved company) uniformly ordered food that I described over the phone as \"4 on a scale of 1 to 5.\" Given what arrived, I can only imagine that Little Delhi uses the following 5-point scale: \n\n1: Pretty damn hot \n2: Painfully hot \n3: Hotter than a mofo \n4: Pure insanity \n5: Curried plasma (like the supercollider kind, not the blood wagon kind or the TV kind). \n\nThe hotness of the food started out like a practical joke and then devolved into an insane dare. The samosas were spicy, and I didn't even think that was possible. If I'd have ordered lassi, I imagine it, too, would have been spicy. \n\nIn all honesty, the spiciness of the food interfered with my ability to tell you whether it was any good or not. In part because I lost my capacity for higher-level functions for about 30 minutes, and in part because one could devour the bumper from a 1958 Cadillac if it was as heavily spiced as my lamb vindaloo was. \n\n\"The merciless peppers of Quetzlzacatenango, grown deep in the jungle primeval by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum.\" -- Chief Wiggum", "author": "Ben P."}

My first time in a new restaurant I usually order the chicken tikka masala as it's become for me the litmus test of a good Indian restaurant (ironically as it's not even a traditional dish): the best dish on the menu when done right and inedible the way most restaurants prepare it (it should NOT taste like Spaghetti-O's).\n\nI was absolutely fascinated by Little India's tikka masala because it was exactly what I dislike about bad tikka masala: too sweet and too creamy, but done so well that I actually loved it anyway.  It tasted just like barbecue sauce, and the others at my table agreed.  But this was the thing: it was the best BBQ sauce I'd ever tasted.  They should bottle the stuff and call it \"desi masterpiece\".  I have no doubt it would be a hit.  But as long as they're labeling it as curry and not BBQ sauce they really ought to save all that cream and sugar for the chai.  caveat emptor.\n\nAs for the rest of the meal, the naan was fresh, warm and not under/overcooked, though we only got 1 3/4 naan in our 2-naan order.  A simple mistake I'm sure  (wanna confuse a waiter? ask him, \"excuse me, is this naan vegetarian?\").  The lamb and chicken curries were both awesome.  In all honesty, I wish I could make it that good at home (I can't).\n\nThe waitstaff was friendly and responsive, and the bollywood flick playing in the corner was muted so as not to interfere with the quiet and clean ambiance.\n\nAll in all, about as good as north indian food gets outside of north india.  entrees are $3 more than the discount joints but well worth it IMHO. If the tikka masala were less sweet I'd give them 5 stars.  But I'll be back to check their other dishes for sure.", "author": "Kaleem K."}

Both sauces were pretty good but I'm a fan of the sweeter things in life, so preferred the red--but used both to balance the flavors out. The samosas were the best I've ever had. Flakey on the outside and not greasy. The potatoes inside were perfectly spiced and cooked. Probably one of the best appetizers I've ever had--a definite MUST. Mmm...I want some now...=P\n\nThe Bengan Bharta was really good for dipping my roti in and especially good for mixing in with some rice. I would have preferred it to be a bit spicier (I ordered medium spicy). I loved the peas and tomatoes they put it the dish as well. The portions were a good size and I was able to get a couple more meals from my take out box over the next day or two (something I'm a HUGE fan of)--I just made some rice at home to mix it with! \n\nI tried a bit of my friend's Chicken Tikki Masala (sans the chicken part) and the sauce was A-MA-ZING! Perfect balance between creamy and tomato-y. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I just wish they had this dish without meat (maybe I can ask next time I come).\n\nOverall, this place was great...not crowded (although more people began to trickle in by the end of our early bird meal), clean, delicious food, reasonable prices, good customer service.

Best of all, they deliver (free with a $20 minimum order)! \n\nTheir Chicken Tikka Masala is incredible and never fails to satisfy. Just the perfect amount of spiciness and great seasoning (even better than Naan 'N Curry). It is especially tasty when you eat it atop a piece of their tasty, chewy Garlic Naan. As my friend Jolene would say, \"YUMMERS\"! I would also recommend their Samosas and Lamb Curry--both great choices. \n\nMy only negative comment is about the size of their portions. Little Delhi is generous with the amount of sauce they give, but a bit stingy on the amount of meat. Either way, I would definitely recommend this place; especially if you're too lazy to go out for dinner and appreciate a good, relatively-priced meal from the comfort of your own home.", "author": "Joseph F."}

Spotting these two restaurants was a relief for both of us since we were so indecisive on what we were going to have for dinner.\n\nPrices ranged from $7.99 - $12.99 or more for each entree, and rice/naan comes separate (seems to be the trend among most restaurants these days...rarely do these ever come with the meal anymore, sadly). The menu consisted of appetizers, curries (lamb, chicken, vegetarian, seafood), tandoori chicken, and desserts. All of it sounded delicious, so you can imagine that it was a little hard for me to decide on what to order. However, I was in the mood for fish....\n\nMy friend ordered Saag Paneer and I ordered Fish Curry; when the server asked me how spicy I wanted the curry, I said I wanted hot. However, he didn't let me have the spiciest; he asked me, \"Are you sure about that?\" and I was certain I was going to be okay with spicy. But, we came to a compromise of \"medium-spicy\" since he seemed afraid that I would be in over my head.\n\nNeedless to say, though, medium-spicy wasn't what I wanted when I finally tasted the curry; it was very light in spice level. Sure, there was a hint of spice, but I felt I could have handled something hotter. Come on, now, just because I look like a \"little Asian girl\" doesn't mean I can't handle spicy food. This was disappointing to me, but it didn't ruin my whole meal. There were good amounts of rice and naan (we ordered one of each), but we ended up running out of both before we could finish off our entrees. =\\ Wish we could have had \"free refills\" on the rice like at Mehfil (in SOMA).\n\nThe atmosphere of the place was nice; grand decor, and it really didn't feel like it was in the Tenderloin with the way the place was set-up. However, at one point while I was enjoying my dinner, I looked up and saw a drugged-out bum staring straight at me through the window, and of course I found that creepy. Appetite was lost for a moment until the bum moved on down Eddy Street....\n\nSeveral servers helped us throughout our dinner, so that was nice. They made sure to refill our water glasses at every chance and even brought us house appetizer (Indian chips? I'm not sure of the correct name) with two kinds of dip. The place is a decent size, large enough for groups, and even has a bar area for single dining.\n\nHey, despite the lack of uber-spice in my curry, I really do like this place. I'll swing by some more since I now know that it's close by to work and shopping. =)", "author": "Helene K."}

Not sure that they turn the Tandoor oven up high enough, the bread is a tad soft on this as well as the garlic Naan we order. The real reason I keep coming back here is for the Lamb Saagt. Awesome and tasty! The rest of my standing order is the Bengan Bharta and the Assorted Tandoori Platter. And yes, I love the Kabuli Naan as a dessert. Their Samosas are tasty too.

And since I never really had good Indian food until Little Delhi, I guess it's my favorite Indian restaurant ever. \n\nThe restaurant is situated on the corner of Eddy and Mason, and there's another Indian/Pakistani restaurant right across the street. Maybe the kitchen staff of Little Delhi need such direct competition to keep themselves on top of their Indian food game. Neighborhood might be a little seedy, but the food is well worth being accosted by a few shady characters and that urine smell will soon be replaced with the smell of curry! Once you step in, the aroma of curry and Indian spices will rivet your taste buds into a Bollywood dance number. Or maybe it's the Bollywood dancing they show on the TV. Anyhoot, the restaurant looks kind of retro, with a red interior and a long counter that does not go with a typical Indian restaurant. \n\nUsually they're busy but there's never a wait for seats. If you come with 2-3 others it's awesome to order family style and share. Unless you're allergic to shrimp, the SHRIMP KORMA is a must-get. Another favorite is the CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA - the sauce is a creamy tomato sauce and the chicken is usually cooked tender and just right. And since our moms always tell us to eat our vegetables, we usually order either the ALOO SAAG (potatoes and spinach) or the ALOO GOBI (cauliflower and potatoes). I also enjoy their LAMB VINDALLO, CHICKEN CURRY, and BUTTER CHICKEN. All legit dishes. \n\nWe then top it off with a side of RICE PILLAU (basmati rice) to share and an order of NAAN or GARLIC NAAN for each person. Spicy-level wise, I have tried the food at \"hot\" and the wonderful people at Little Delhi laughed at me while I ate. I found the food to be just right at \"medium\", but if you're into spicy things, whether in your man/woman or in your food, you can maybe try HOT and hopefully not get laughed at. \n\nYou know how I mentioned the smell of warm and delicious Indian food when you initially enter Little Delhi? Don't worry, you can carry the smell home with you without taking leftovers. Some nights after Little Delhi, I decide not to shower so I can still smell the Shrimp Korma that is resting in my tummy. Real talk! \n\nOh! And they got a bomb-ass lunch deal - Rice, Salad, Naan, Chicken Tiki Masala, and Chana Masala for like $6.95 to $8.95.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-07-03", "description": "I think my dining companion really said it best, right there in our red naugahyde booth: \"It's not Tasty Curry.\"\n\nIt's true. It's not. But there are many redeeming factors. Not least of which is the fantastic, friendly, white-shirted service. They really make an effort to distinguish themselves from the ubiquitous Tandoorloin skeeve joints, with dirty plates and explosive curries. By contrast, Little Delhi (which they spell \"Dehli\" on the menu - when I mentioned this, my dining companion gave me a look that just said, \"If hear you bitch about a typo one more time I will wreck a ho\" but it bothered me)  but anyway, like I was saying, Little Delhi really makes an effort to distinguish themselves with a clean, if eclectic (Nevada license plates?) decor. Kind of an homage to the American diner, but with Indian food.\n\nThe food was fine. I really, really hate when the tikka masala sauce is sweet. Ugh. Nothing makes me gag like sweet, creamy sauce. (Get your mind out of the gutter.) Which is where the Tasty Curry comparison inevitably enters the arena: their tikka masala sauce has ruined me for all others, and Little Delhi's was yucky in comparison. But the samosas and chutneys and raita were all fine and good, the naan was warm and tasty (if a little thin) and the rice was plain but cheap. It didn't break the bank, and it's a decent place to soak up the $2.95 margaritas from the Gold Dust. But it's no Tasty Curry.", "author": "Megan W."}

(mobile.yelp.com on your Web-enabled cell phone)\n\nSister-in-law was in town and we were doing the \"shopping in Union Square thing.\" When she said she wanted Indian food, I immediately suggested Naan-N-Curry, but decided to look for some place nicer and possibly better. I fired up Mobile Yelp, found Little Delhi, and discovered we were only a block away.\n\nLittle Delhi is a great place to get Indian food in Union Square. You can tell it used to be a diner because the counter and stools are still there.\n\nWe started off with the samosas and they were excellent, especially since they were served on a bed of garbanzo beans. Our main courses were the saag paneer, lamb vindaloo and chicken badami. The saag paneer and lamb vindaloo are standard dishes and they really hit the spot. The chicken badami (BBQ chicken in a creamy curry sauce topped with pistachios and cashews) isn't something I'd seen before, but apparently it's a house specialty and it was also really good. \n\nWe ended the meal with a cup of chai, which was refreshing, but chai's relatively new to me (Starbucks doesn't count), so I can't attest to it's authenticity. But I liked it and I guess that's all that matters.\n\nPlus, feeding the three hungry people for around $40 is hard to beat.", "author": "Arnold G."}

We ended up getting Bengan Bharta (eggplant, peas, onions, tomatoes) and Paneer Makhani (cheese in butter and tomato sauce) with sides of naan and rice.  Both were good, but out of the two, the Paneer Makhani had us scraping the sides of the bowl.  We were initially won over by how unhealthy it sounded...chunks of cheese in a butter sauce?  Yes, please!", "author": "K P."}

The service is consistent, the food is very good, especially for the price, and it's comfortable if you want a deep conversation over dinner, or prefer to stuff your face and zone out to the Bollywood music videos.

I'm certain there are plenty of restaurants out there that deliver, however I shouldn't have to lower my taste standards just because I'm feeling too lazy to cook or go out to eat.\n\nIn addition to my delivery dilemma, Indian food and I haven't really gotten along much in the past.  Let's just say never make your first meal of the day the all you can eat buffet at a certain Indian restaurant located around Geary and Arguello (I'm not naming names), because you, your roommates, and your toilet will regret it.\n\nSo one fateful night, I decide to branch out from my usual delivery spot, because one can only eat so much Chinese food in a week.  Rita C. had just given this place a glowing one sentence review, so I decided to check it out.  I ordered the old standbys: Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Korma, and a few garlic Naans to soak up the sauces.  The delivery time was no longer than anywhere else I've ordered from, and the food was hot and fresh when it arrived.  I was actually taken aback by how good it was.  Honestly, I was mostly relieved that I didn't have any stomach\"problems the next morning, if you catch my drift.\n\nChances are, I'll never step foot in this place, as delicious and addicting as it is.  We've got a good thing going right now as it is, and I wouldn't want it to be ruined by the off chance of being called \"bro\" by one of the waiters (or whatever the hindi equivalent of that word might be).\n\nI give Little Delhi a fantastic score of 5 out of 5 stars.\n\nLove,\nJames", "author": "Cheryll M."}

One even asked for a job at the bar (Do they even notice a customer is sitting right next to them?)\n\nWhile $7 a glass is not expensive for wine,  the old bar had bottles  half-corked (exposed) and I was sure the Merlot was stale. I couldn't ask because the bartender left the premises right after she served the drink.\n\nThe lamb special wasn't cheap at approx. 15, and $4 for rice (Rice costs extra even if you order the special!!)  It consisted of some decent small balls of tandoori lamb in a curry sauce w/ cashews and raisins. Not bad, but not worth the negativity that surrounded. It painted an awful picture of the community, and it seemed these lady servers (without a soul in the house) were anxious for bar-goers and inconvenienced by people coming in to eat dinner. \n\n The TV was on with a College football and then Nickelodean, and they told me I could change it to whatever I wanted...

I originally ordered a full order of rice which was only $2. The waitress was kind enough to advise I get the half order for $1 which is the same amount if not more than most Indian restaurants give you and charge $2+. They customize the spiciness so I asked for medium spice. The chana masala was delicious - not too mild, not too spicy with a rich, hearty flavor. It went well with the poori, a deep friend whole wheat bread, which the server recommended as most Indians usually pair it with the chana masala. Everything came out to a little over $11 including tax which is spectacular given the quality of the food, the fact that it's a sit-down restaurant, and that they give you free papadums which most places charge $2+ for!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-03-10", "description": "The interior of Little Delhi looks something like a truck stop that was located between Modesto and Visalia in a previous life. Cushy Naugahyde booths line the Eddy street windows, and a counter with roadhouse-style swiveling chairs welcomes solitary diners.  Some ethnic decor has been added to the walls, but it's still hard to to look at the place and not expect to see a beehive-haired middle aged waitress wearing a uniform embroidered with \"Agnes\" or \"Marge\", hastily darting between tables and asking customers, \"What can I get'cha Sugar?\".\r\n\r\nI walked in the door smack-dab between lunch and dinner at around 3:00PM.  There was only one other couple sharing a sunny booth by the window.  Never having eaten Indian food at from counter seat, I took the opportunity.  Entree, nan, and rice specials were advertised at around 8 or 9 bucks, but I deviated from it and got Chicken Vindaloo, 2 Nan breads, and an order of rice for a couple bucks more.  The waiter gave a standard white-boy caution that Vindaloo was a spicy dish.  I gave him my standard fire-eaters response of \"extra hot\" and \"spare no evil\".\r\n\r\nI guess he didn't take me seriously.  The Chicken Vindaloo I got was good, but it hit only 3.5 or so on the 1-to-10 burn-o-meter.  The sauce was OK, but the mix of ingredients was notably light on chicken and heavy on potatoes.  The nan breads were a little smaller than the competition-frisbee sized ones I'm used to,  sized somewhere between that of a dinner and a salad plate. One of them was gone about halfway through lunch, and two wound up being just about perfect.  Order more than one if you go through a lot of it, and be warned that they cut it in quarters before they serve it....make sure to tell the waiter if you like it unsliced. (one of my pet preferences).\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is a bit on the Sketchy side, but fallout from this is minimized by the fact that Powell Street BART's Northwest escalator is barely 200 yards from Dehli's front door.  Though somewhat worn and dated, the interior of the restaurant is well kept and clean, reflecting a conscious effort on the part of management to create a pleasant environment from the resources they have to work with.  And despite it's near-Tenderloin location, the bathrooms are surprisingly sanitary and well maintained.\r\n\r\nLittle Delhi was nothing to set the world on fire, but I plan to give it a second shot. Next time I'll stick to the specials menu, and put a heavy emphasis on spiciness when I order.  If the burn-o-meter doesn't hit at least six, I won't be back a third time.", "author": "Mike W."}

The sauce had a stronger tomato flavor than I usually encounter in vindaloo, but the lamb was tender and delicious, so I was enthused overall.  The benghan bartha was also quite good, and the garlic naan was fresh, hot, and thick.\n\nOverall, while I have had better Indian food in a restaurant, I've never had better delivered, so call me a fan of Little Delhi.", "author": "Bitter J."}

We were looking for a casual restaurant around Union Square for dinner without reservations on a Saturday night (eeks!). This place fit the bill. It took awhile to get seated (reasonable on a Saturday night) and get service, and there wasn't anyplace obvious to stand while waiting. But all was forgiven because the food was absolutely stellar. There were a lot of locals and Indians there, which we took as a good sign. \n\nI got chicken saag and my boyfriend got lamb vindaloo - both of which were outstanding. We both got medium spicy, which was perhaps a bit too hot for me - next time I'd go mild. The food was even better because it was  pretty cheap for downtown SF. I think our bill with the naan was under $30 - which you really can't beat for such good food. I'd recommend this place, though maybe call ahead a reservation on a weekend night.", "author": "L. S."}

I prefer it that way but might notch it down from \"Spicy\" to \"Medium\" next time.  There are certain dishes I have to order when trying a new Indian place: \n\n- Chicken Tikka Masala...which is about as adventurous as getting a slice of pepperoni at a pizza joint but a great baseline.  The sauce-to-chicken ratio was about average but the actual chunks of chicken were awesome.  You could tell they came from a tandoor before being dunked in the thick sauce (which was also a plus - not the consistency of water like most places).\n\n- Okra...a kick-ass veggie dish.  Not very oily which was nice.  You need to eat this with some rice since the flavors are very powerful.  I even opted for the Raita which helps balance this one out a bit.\n\n- Garlic Naan....bigger, hotter, fresher and with more garlic than average.  \n\nAnyway, long story short, this place is now my official go-to Indian restaurant.

Hot chai tea was a bit sweeter than I'm used to, but still good and refills were timely.\n\nPrice came out to be more than reasonable for a good Indian lunch.", "author": "Alan N."}

Was the daytime ALWAYS that bright? We couldn't stop talking about The Dark Knight (which you should go see. NOW) when we got reallllllllllly hungry. So we made our way to Little Delhi. Extra points for being so close to Powell Bart.\n\nThe atmosphere was really nice and the Bollywood music playing softly in the background reminded me of the Saturday mornings when my sister and I used to watch Bollywood music videos just because. So fun. But anyway, the staff seemed friendly and we were seated promptly. And they were really quick to refill our water, which was good because my friend's boyfriend drank an unholy amount of water in such a short time. \n\nI ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala with garlic naan, and my friends ordered the Chicken Tandoori lunch special, Butter Chicken with plain naan and rice, and samosas. We had a TON of food and it was all very very delicious. My Chicken Tikka Masala was nice and creamy and the chicken was perfectly cooked. Though, I wish it had more chicken instead of just a few chunks. But in the end, it didn't really matter because I was so full after only a few bites. Also, I had requested my dish to be spicy but it wasn't really all that spicy. It still had a nice kick of subtle heat, though. Maybe it's because I'm immune to spicy foods now. But oh well. The garlic naan was very...well, garlicky and a bit salty and I found the taste to be a bit overpowering at times but it was still good. My friends seemed to really enjoy their meals as well, so it's alllllll gooooooooood.\n\nAnd the prices were very reasonable. That's always a plus.\nI left very full and satisfied which later left me feeling like some weird half-(food)comatose zombie who could barely keep her eyes open while standing in a line at Forever 21.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-27", "description": "From Tucson, AZ, and I discovered this place because it was really close to my hotel the first time I came to visit SF.  I remembered the place and made it a priority meal stop the second time I came to visit The City.  The first time I visited, a good proportion of the faces in the place were of Indian heritage, and that's always a good sign.  The service was pretty good, and it's definitely better than the service in most of the places I'm used to visiting in Tucson.  In comparison to basically all of the Tucson Indian options this place is 5 stars and really could go up to a sixth if it were allowed.  Reading through a few other reviews on here, I can't imagine how you could give it less than 4 stars really. The food may be a little slow to arrive, but this should move the score in the positive direction in my opinion, considering that the meal overall is well paced, and I rather enjoyed the company I had at every meal there.  The menu is fairly diverse, not the most by any means, but certainly offers a fair variety of options.  Last, and most importantly, the food was very, very delicious.\n\nSamosas - Scrumptious, large, stuffed heartily and on a bed of chickpeas with delicious sauces.\n\nChicken Vindaloo - Spicy..really spicy = really delicious.  My Tucson level spice tolerance was definitely challenged by this dish, but the heat was definitely backed a solidly flavorful version of the dish.\n\nSaag paneer (had both times I've visited) - Amazing and deceptively spicy.  The spinach and paneer were actually well prepared together, and I was impressed by the perfect texture and balance of the dish.  I've had versions where you get only a few paneer cubes in the entire serving.  The spinach was spiced well with a good balance of flavors and heat which provided a perfect background for the refreshing creamy flavor and of the paneer.  Definitely enjoyed this one.\n\nOkra Vegetable - Again a well balanced blend of spice and heat.  This was the only dish that was at all off--and even so it was more about the ingredients than the preparation.  While 75% of the dish was great, there seemed to be one past-ripe piece of okra that snuck in, meaning that 1/5 bites of okra seemed to have a woodier texture.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt though because this was my favorite dish, and I really didn't mind the okra being off slighly because it increased the overall texture of the dish without being so off that it ruined the whole dish.\n\nMy recommendation is to visit Little Delhi if you find yourself in San Francisco and are craving some good and affordable Indian food.", "author": "Bryan H."}

I have tried at LEAST 12 other Indian restaurants in SF (and a handful in LA) only to have my senses horribly offended. Don't try Little Delhi if you can't eat here on a consistent basis because it will make all other Indian food taste like absolute crap. I leave other Indian restaurants in a straight-up bad mood.\nI literally eat Little Delhi once a week and want to cry tears of joys. I usually try to save Little Delhi for a day I know will be bad as it will undoubtedly lift my spirit. Here are my favorites:\n- chicken tikka masala\n- Kerissa tikka masala (ask for it)\n- bengan bharta (no peas)\n- aloo tikki\n- aloo ghobi (no peas)\n- shrimp rasala\n- fish or market cheese tandoori\n- mango lassi\n- nimbu pani (lemonade)\n\nAll medium spicy and extra delicious.\n\n\nMY ORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI ate lunch here yesterday and my mind is still boggled by how great it was.\n\nEric C. and I ordered chicken tikka masala (spicy), aloo ghobi (spicy), a garlic naan, a side of rice, and 2 sprites.\n\nWe were given a starter that consisted of sesame crisps and two sauces (one red sauce that tasted like sweet and sour sauce but better, and that green minty sauce Indian restaurants always have). Eric C. and I didn't like the sesame crisps at first but we ended up eating it all so I guess we did like it.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala sauce was SO delicious. It was creamy and the perfect amount of spicy. At first I was a little put off because it tastes different than the chicken tikka masala sauce I'm used to (Berkeley's House of Curries and Naan 'n Curry, also delicious) but I almost immediately grew to love this sauce more. (Anyone who knows me knows that this is a bold statement because I LOVE HOC tikka masala sauce...) Eric C. says the chicken was not dry like at other places. Combined with the tasty garlic naan and the basmati rice...PERFECT.\n\nThe aloo ghobi was also very delicious. I'd like to see a little more ghobi but I have never been one to turn down some aloo. There are peas in this dish (which I probably request to omit in future visit, and trust me there will be future visits), but this was so tasty I was eating peas as if I liked them.\n\nThe portions look small but it's enough. Eric C. and I are HUGE eaters (we probably average 2 entrees per person) and we walked out VERY satisfied. We ordered both dishes spicy and I can barely describe how perfect the spicy was. Each time you put the food in your mouth, an explosion of flavor tantalizes your taste buds. I feel like at other Indian places, after all everything starts tasting like muted nothing. Not here. Each bite is as flavorful as the last and spiciness leaves a soft burning in your mouth that is not uncontrollable but a heated reminder of how tasty everything was.\n\nThe Sprites were SO refreshing between bites of the spicy deliciousness we were eating.", "author": "K C."}

Once you get over the former diner decor and the slightly under the table feeling of the place (which all truly ethnic restaurants in SF have, and s typically a sign of better food for the money IMO) then you can truly appreciate this little gem. I used to rely on Naan 'N Curry to get my fix, but now it's Delhi or bust unless they're closed.\n\nThe wait staff are fine, just very reserved people. They'll open up once you've been there about 5 times if you talk to them. They come off a bit gruff just because they actually pay attention to people and realize the majority of SF business lunchers aren't there for chit-chat.\n\nYou get a complimentary appetizer just for ordering with a helping of Tamarind and Chutney to whet your appetite. They have fantastic meat and vegetarian dishes and their sauces come out nice and thick. Other places seem to use water where Little Delhi uses I would guess cream. Like spicy? Order it extra spicy and get prepared to sweat a little, they don't joke with special requests.\n\nThe Chai is a bit too sugared out for my personal tastes, but like I said, they don't joke with personal requests so if you're not big on sugar ask for it with less, they're accommodating.\n\nThere really isn't a finer Indian spot near the Shopping Center or Union Square, so if you're in the mood, Little Delhi can deliver.", "author": "N S."}

Excellent service for a party of 16 and no pre added service charge.  The \"spicy\" food was very tasty and spicy (unlike other Indian/Paakistani resturants where \"spicy\" is pretty mild.)  They were really nice about plating up some cakes and desserts that we brought for the Birthday Man.  Everyone had their fills + beer and leftovers for $210\n\nThe lamb korma won great reviews, butter chicken, chicken masala, eggplant, chickpeas with spinach, cauliflower were all delicious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-13", "description": "Starting a few years ago, I decided to throw myself into a lifelong quest to try as many Indian restaurants as possible, as Indian cuisine happens to be my favourite.\n\nLet me just start with the service:\nI've noticed that a lot of people have commented on the quietness, weirdness, lack of overbounding enthusiasm, etc. Sure, the waitstaff might not have the bubbly nature of those who work in a more \"up scale\" venue... But, guess what? They have been extremely nice to me everytime I have gone in. They have been extremely efficient. They had taken my order, brought me the food I ordered, and gotten me the bill when I was done. They don't hover. They don't interfere. \nThey don't up sell dishes are try to get us to add on dishes, and only suggest things when asked. They allow me (and whomever I might be sharing the meal with) the space to enjoy my food. Best service I've ever had.\n\nNow, the food:\nI eat a vegetarian diet. One of the many reasons why I love Indian cuisine - it caters very well to non-meat eaters. The non-meat selection is great. To start, I get the Samosa, Aloo Tikki, or Vegetable Pakora. YUM. Then, for a main dish, I usually get Aloo Gobi, Aloo Matar, Okra Vegetable, Vegetable Korma, or Mixed Vegetables... Or a combination of a few of those. And, as far as the rice goes, I love the Peas Pillau (rice with onions and peas). And, to go with all that, I usually get garlic naan.\n\nAnd, I almost always get my food just a tiny bit more spicy than what the waitstaff/cooks would consider medium spicy. I love spicy food, and this restaurant offers dishes that could be as spicy as an authentic home cooked Indian meal would be.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, \"jeez, this girl sounds like a pig.\" I am not. I am usually with, at least, one more person. And, if I am by myself, I never eat it all in one sitting. I order enough knowing I can take the rest home and feed myself with the leftovers for the next few days. And, trust me, this food is still good the next day, right out of the fridge.\n\nAs far as the location:\nSo, it's in the tiny lil' Tenderloin bubble. The only (singular) problem I had walking there was that one homeless drug addict decided to aggressively call me a b!t@h from across the street, because, as I walked past her, I didn't look her in the eye when she asked me for a few dollars 'cuz she needed a fix. So, I would rather use my money to feed myself. Call me greedy, but. hey, I pay taxes, I work two reputable jobs, I maintain a drug free life, I am doing my best to avoid homelessness for myself. One crack addicted homeless lady calling me names because I chose not to give her a few dollars? I'm more than happy to subject myself to that for a good meal. No matter what, you are going to cross paths with some less than desirable characters in the Tenderloin. If you can't handle the location and live in the delivery radius, get them to deliver. If you don't, suck it up and know that a yummy meal waits for you inside, and you only have to deal with the minute space that is The Tenderloin for just a couple minutes.", "author": "Ellie M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2005-12-13", "description": "This place used to be a tiny five-table spot on Jones at Geary. The kitchen and dining room were one and the same, and was manned by an extremely friendly and cute couple who made everything to order. i immediately fell in love with Little Delhi upon being introduced to the place sometime around 2003, and ate there at least twice a week for a solid year and a half. the food was above and beyond any other indian/pakistani restaurant i had tasted, and being that it's my favorite cuisine, i had tried them all in SF. My favorite dish, the Chicken Korma, was literally bursting with flavor - the almond slivers and tiny raisins in the dish added multidimensionality that no other place in town could boast. For appetizers, the Aloo Tiki and Samosas were gigantic, dwarfing the little paper dishes they came served in, slathered in mint and tamarind sauce with yogurt and sitting atop garbanzo beans. They were a meal in themselves. The prices were perfect - not as cheap as your Pakwans or Naan'n'Currys, but nowhere near your Indian Ovens either. Eating here became a ritual that I looked forward to often. If i had lived as close as the friend who initially introduced me to this place, I, like him, would have eaten here every day. \n\nThen, in the late summer of 2004, they closed. Their lease was up, and in an attempt to find a larger space to accomodate all their potential customers, decided to temporarily close up shop and find someplace bigger. \n\nA year and a half passed. I stopped eating Indian/Pakistani food, since nothing could even come close to my beloved Little Indian Delhi.  Token trips to Shalimar and Naan'n'Curry were fruitless -- the dishes were lifeless and bland in comparison. I began to have dreams about the Delhi's food - and this has never happened to me before or since. In these dreams I could actually relive the experience - I woke up a few times mid-bite, completely distraught that I had merely been dreaming. \n\nI finally found a worthy successor - the fantastic Lahore Karahi on O'Farrell. But my circle of friends and I always spoke of Little Delhi in hushed tones of reverence. \n\nA month ago, a friend passed by this empty storefront on Eddy at Mason and noticed our old friend Kamaal inside - the chef from the Delhi. Calls were made instantly and within days the connection was re-estabilished. Little Delhi is now re-opened. Don't miss your chance this time!\n\nEDIT: I can't believe it's been five years since I wrote that review. We were so excited that Nimi and Kamal had finally found a new home. Unfortunately there were some problems in the kitchen, and after a little while we noticed Kamal wasn't spending any time cooking anymore, and the quality of the food declined sharply. A little while later, and we stopped seeing them at the restaurant altogether. It seemed there was a falling out, but we never knew what happened. The food became run-of-the-mill, we stopped going. \n\nFast-forward to 2010. Kamal contacted a friend and fellow OG Little Dehli devotee to tell him he and Nimi were opening a new restaurant, and it would be \"Jones Street style\". Not many phrases can excite me like those three words can. The spot is called Curry Village and opens mid-January, on 9th Avenue at Judah. I'm sure you'll see me there. :)", "author": "Mike B."}

After ordering, we were given complimentary papadam (lentil wafers) with tamarind and mint chutneys.  The papri chaat was quite tasty, though this was the only chaat on the menu.  The chaat was well balanced with the crispness of the chips, the different chutneys, and the chickpeas.  If you do order this appetizer, be forewarned, the chickpeas make this very filling.  The entrees came out shortly after we finished the chaat and I was amazed.  We ordered the dishes spicy which normally means more like a medium because it's adjusted for \"American\" tastes, but not here.  The malai kofta and chana saag both had a good amount of spice along with flavor.  We had plenty of leftovers mainly due to the filling nature of the papri chaat, but I'm sure those will taste even better the next day.  \n\nI will definitely be back.

We went with Little Delhi because it seemed the cleanest. Turns out it was a good choice!\n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala was full of creamy goodness, and the Lamb Curry was a bit tough but still spicy and flavorful. A side order of plain rice costs $2 but is enough for two.

Their garlic naan is buttery and flavorful, the raita isn't watery, and their mint chutney is homemade and delicious.  I haven't explored the menu as much as I'd like to, but I plan on exploring more once I can get over how amazing the tikki masala is.\n\nWatch out- they aren't kidding when they say spicy.

I was greeted by a Tenderloin Ambassador who was relieving himself in the doorway right next to the restaurant -- savory!\n\nWalking in, this restaurant is shaped like a long L with the long part along Eddy St. There is a bar (diner-style) area, which is where I sat, underneath a very unique piece of art - a map of india outlined with pennies. Hindi film music was piped in through the music system, and the decor -- gold walls with burgundy accents and tables -- lifts this restaurant a step up from being Yet Another Paki Restaurant in the 'Loin.\n\nService was quite friendly and quick, with prompt water refills. The food came out quickly and was freshly cooked.\n\nI had the samosas, which were served over a bit of channa (garbanzo), with some very good mint chutney and tamarind sauce. The spices were good and the crust was very crispy - only gripe was that the filling was a bit overly pureed, but overall quite good.\n\nNext, I had some mattar paneer (peas + cheese cubes), with some naan. First I should say that the food delivery was well timed and the service remained good with quick water refills. Staff was friendly and talkative as well.\n\nThe mattar paneer had a very good flavor, with some quite interesting spices, which reminded me of a dish I had last time I was in India. I had ordered medium spiciness, and for someone used to spicy food, this was a light \"medium\". The naan was warm and toasty with lots of butter.\n\nThe price was decent, though I wouldn't say \"cheap\". Veggie plates tended to be around $7, and meat dishes a dollar or two more. I guess maybe this is cheap afterall, though I just came back from a trip to Indonesia and I'm still readjusting to SF prices..\n\nThis is a good spot to grab a bite, and at half a block from the Powell St. BART station, it's a good location as well.

This was some veggies ground up and made into patties, with sauce. It was good! J originally ordered a lamb dish, but then I was reading foursquare and the tips on there said to get butter chicken, so he ran after the waiter, and changed his order to that. The waiter wasn't upset, and the butter chicken was tasty. It wasn't chicken in a butter sauce, like you might think, but in a tomatoey sauce, and it also was good. The very best part of the meal was the naan. They have great naan there. J had the special filled naan, but I had just plain naan, and it was warm, and soft, and fluffy, and all naany. I think it was the best naan I've had in this city! The service was good, our water was refilled, the food was good, the restaurant looked nice enough and clean. Some people on yelp have noted that the service and food are slow, but we did not find them slow in the least bit. Everything went normal speed, except for when it was time to get the check. It was a little hard to get them to bring the check, but then that happens at a lot of restaurants, and I have been to places where it's even harder.

I must say, I'm really glad we gave this place a 2nd chance. Just don't order the saag--some day I'll get back to Austin and get my favorite saag, but in the meantime I'll have to have some chicken rosala (coconut ckn) and some peas pillau. It was so delicious and fast when we ordered Sunday night. I would recommend getting chicken over lamb--bigger portions, better quality meat. My husband had the vindaloo again and he really did like it. It's a bit spicier than other places but so yum. I think this place does better on busy nights--like most places--and the delivery was fast, food was hot, and the price was right. \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: Wow. I can't believe that this place gets such good reviews. We ordered delivery a few nights ago and the food was just awful. I was really hopeful that this place could take the place of Naan &Curry--my husband's favorite, not mine--and was saddened to find that the food tasted bad and that yet another Indian restaurant screwed up saag so bad that I wonder why I ever liked that dish! \n\nFirst off, delivery wasn't lightning fast and we're maybe 2 blocks away. The food was hot (bonus) and the portions larger than other Indian places I've ordered from. I got the lamb saag and my husband got the chicken vindaloo. I ordered mine 'medium', hubby ordered 'hot'. Mine was so hot that I couldn't even taste the flavor. All I could taste was hot. My hubby on the other hand said that his was only moderately hot. Ok, must have switched the orders there. He wasn't impressed with the flavor or consistency (runny) of his food and it didn't replace Naan & Curry's vindaloo. My saag was so terrible that I didn't eat it. I had a bit of rice--large size, good price, and the samosas were quite tasty. Plus, they delivered the sauces to go with the samosas (many places forget) and these were good and the green one was really spicy. I wish they would have been better, but I hated it, hubby thought it was ok, the prices were great and the delivery was at least efficient.", "author": "Denise L."}

After Lahore, we were thinking we wouldn't find anything as good and so we were very pleasantly surprised by this place.  It's a completely different experience--it's very clean, if tattered, there is a bar and the wait staff is more professional.  We were a bit concerned when we arrived because the place was empty (Saturday lunch), but as we ate, it was filling up.  We decided to eat in here, sat down and were given our menus.  The prices were very similar to Lahore (the naans a bit more but the entrees seemed the same price). We ordered one naan, aloo tikki, kofta, baigan bhartha and saag paneer as well as a Taj Mahal beer.  We were brought poppadams and sauces as we waited for our food. We didn't have long to wait. Two huge aloo tikki came first. They were covered in chutney and yogurt and sat on chick peas.  They were very tasty but not crispy on the outside, which I do like in aloo tikki.  Also, no peas just mashed potatoes. The main dishes were served in the little metal dishes that many Indian restaurants employ, and servings were large.  The rice was a pleasant surprise. Sometimes, it seems like it's old and been sitting on the buffet table but this was fresh, fragrant and each grain was separate, just how I like basmati rice.  The naan was considerably better than Lahore. Crispy, flavorful and tender all at once.  Baigan bharta had peas and was lively and fresh.  The saag paneer was tasty but not as flavorful as Lahore. It seemed to be missing something (grease, maybe?).  The kofta was the stand out--rich creamy sauce with soft but firm kofta's that were not dried out inside.  This dish was almost too rich to eat, but soooo good.  We had enough leftovers for 2 more meals.  We will definitely be going back.", "author": "Vivek V."}

The reviews brought me here after I decided to try something different than Indian Oven for dinner (which is pretty damn good). I went and walked away thinking this place definitely gives IO a run and more for its money. \n\nOur samosas came out so fast that I wondered if the lentil chips and chutney came with it. By the way, the chutneys are crazy good. I realize now that other places maybe thin them out with who knows what; not here. Moving on, the samosas were freakin great. The daal soup showed up moments later, and by this point I thought someone had spiked the food, cause I was seriously starting to feel transported. (Darjelling Limited, anyone?)\n\nSo, finally got a little break before the main dishes showed up and decided to check out the decor. I can't remember what this place used to be, but our best guess was maybe a Dennys or similar diner joint that has been painted over. It has the feel of more work to come but maybe not just yet; they could use some more atmosphere. Let me mention, too, that the server was very friendly and unafraid to offer suggestions (and feedback on dishes they didn't think were as good as others; a surprising and very cool quality). The bussers were good and kept the water glasses full and the table clean.\n\nSo, just when I thought I was really getting into the Bollywood stuff on the big but not-too-intrusive screen, our dishes showed up... Chicken Tikki Masala (which we asked for \"medium\"), the \"Chef's Specialty\" Lamb Curry (which we asked for \"spicy\"), naan, the regular rice and something called poori, which is some sort of fried wheat dough quasi-confection (it's no dessert, but rather an awesome and decadently fattening alternative to naan. It smelled incredible and fresh, what a way to start the main course -- BRING IT!).  \n\nThe main dishes were fantastic. The tikki masala was very sweet, and rather mild for a \"medium\", but I'm a spicehound. I would only ask for it spicy nexttime. Otherwise, it came out piping and there was plenty of sauce for dipping. I thought the texture was tender and juicy, reminiscient of \"very fresh\"; maybe just a good night? That poori with the masala sauce was a big hit at the table. I'm glad there was only so much, cause I think we would have eaten it until we burst otherwise. The lamb was also very tasty and, though \"spicy\", was more like a medium to me. Perhaps even a tiny bity chewy, but an overall good complement to the chicken, also served with plenty of sauce for further enjoyment. I might ask for extra spicy nexttime if they do such a thing.  \n\nWe were quickly obsessed with the poori and and found ourselves neglecting the naan, perhaps subconsciously expecting sure dissapointment after something like fried dough(!). Well, we were wrong, the naan kicked some serious Ak'bar.  If anything, the rice was almost too plain and just barely spiced, though they do have a saffron rice with peas that will be considered next time.\n\nAnd, just when we thought we were going to burst while attempting to stand up to go: in a moment of clarity, I decided to order a dessert. I asked for a mango lassi that we split. It was also very sweet and a good cut to the wonton orgy of flavor we had just arrived back from.\n\nSo, we had all courses and even a beer; plenty of food. Walked out for just $50, including a good tip.\n\nSo, I sit here in the middle of my room (and food coma), looking forward to the nexttime. The place gets extra points for being less than a block from the Powell Street station as well. Oh yeah, it KICKS ASS. HIghly recommended.", "author": "Mark P."}

There were, oh... three..maybe four, Indian decorations on the wall, with a Bollywood movie playing in the front of the room (to my back so I couldn't watch it... my friend enjoyed it though).\n\nI had the chicken tikka masala... I have to admit, this was the worst masala I've had in a long time... imagine tomato bisque with tough chicken and you have the slop that they served me.  My friend had the lamb curry, he said it was tough and tasted like tamarind sauce with a heap of spiciness added to it.\n\nThe only redeeming quality of this place was their naan and the mango lassi (which was great).

It is too rich and unhealthy and the flavor of the veggies/meat gets lost in the thick red curries. \n\nBut our Indian cabbie highly recommended this place and compared it with gaylords - the famous chain restaurant. He said if we go to gaylords, we would just spend more $$$ for the same food. Since our previous cabbie's recos were awesome, we decided to give this one a shot. \n\nWe went there for lunch on a weekday. It turned out to be one of the tiny road side lunch places. It was almost full. We were seated in about 5 minutes. That was good considering how packed it was. Their service seemed pretty efficient.\n\nWe ordered one chaat item for starter followed by a subji and naan/paratha. We really liked the spicy papri chaat. For the flat bread, I had aloo paratha while SO had garlic naan. Both were decent - not too bad, not extraordinary either. The subji was paneer makhani. Usually the makhani dishes are creamy and mild (as in hotness not flavor). So we told the waitress to make it spicier. The quantity was good for two of us. They made it perfectly spicy. But we did not like the red gravy. And there was too much of it and few paneer pieces.\n\nOverall, we were disappointed because of the main dish - paneer makhni. Rest of the food wasn't too bad.

I am disappointed to say that this place did not meet my \"high\" expectations. \n\nEntry - The ambiance and the food prices were what we had expected. Place looks neat and server was very courteous. There were not many people but this could be because we went there on a late Sunday night on a long weekend. Menu had lots of options - both meat and vegetarian sections.\n\nStarters- We ordered chicken and tomato soup to begin with along with some chicken kabob to begin with. The kebab's were awesome (probably the best we have ever had) and my friends really liked the tomato soup. As for the chicken soup, it was okay at the best. The chicken pieces in the soup had distinct barbecue sauce flavor which is something you don't expect in and Indian restaurant. I was hoping the chicken would be marinated in some spices and yoghurt.\n\nMain course - We ordered Butter chicken and chicken tikka for non-vegetarians. For the vegetarians group, we ordered saag paneer, aalu gobhi and malai kofta. Both chicken dishes had the same barbecue flavor. Curry for Chicken tikka was great but butter chicken was average. Vegetarian dishes were okay at the best. Bread was warm and all the variety - Plain naan, Garlic Naan, Paratha was decent. \n\nDessert - We ordered Mango Kulfi.

The hostess/waitress then chided him behind the register but made no mention of it to us afterward, so we left a bad tip. \n\nNaan - Well done. Only redeeming item. \n\nTandoori Platter: You can't get this wrong cookery-wise, but it was probably the least seasoned Tandoori I've tried in a long time. \n\nRice - Clearly drawn from a pot sitting for ages. It was clumpy, sticky, and just not even close to fresh. \n\nOverall, both the food and the experience were pretty awful. Not to mention the prices were a little steep for what we got.

This is a rare option to come by when ordering online. Be careful when ordering because they mean it when they say hot. I love spicy hot food and it greatly exceeded my culinary expectations. Cooking wise my only complaint was the Garlic Naan Bread. The bread was burned so bad there were burn holes through the entire bread. Making it taste a little charred and unpleasant. I would have rather waited longer for new bread than what I received. The food was decently priced for what I got and besides the burned bread it was damn delicious.

Lahore Karahi has been our go-to spot for months but we decided to branch out and give this place a shot the other day and were very impressed with the food. We had the benghan bhartha (quite different and equally awesome as Lahore Karahi's version, very smoky/earthy flavors and tasted quite fresh), the navrattam korma (nice diversity of vegetables, sauce wasn't anything special but definitely tasty), and the lamb tikka-masala (nice, extremely tender and lean chunks of lamb in a delicious korma sauce, but maybe a smidge less amazing than Lahore Karahi's korma). The garlic naan was tasty but a little overly oily. Samosas and chutney were excellent. The Samosas were served atop a stew of chickpeas in a nice sauce and slathered with chutney (which tasted fresh and had nice clean flavors not overwhelmed by heat). Papadam was nothing special (Maharani still has the best papadam and chutney I've had downtown). The chai was quite drinkable but a little heavy on the anise (and little else to flesh out the flavor). Probably spent about ten bucks more than we would have at Lahore Karahi but still quite reasonable- lunch for 3 was about $50 with tip. Nice, clean, diner style (definitely more of a \"restaurant\" than Lahore Karahi, less than Maharani). They had a nice selection of Indian beers too (but no BYOB like LK). Servers were quite friendly and came around frequently to replenish water and chai. For me, LK is still the neighborhood champ but LD deserves some love too, and I definitely see myself hitting it up again in the not-too-distant future.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-04-02", "description": "It was my first week  in San Francisco, early 2003. The walk down the Jones street literally became a walk down the memory lane for the first time in six years of  US.  Selective combination of spices and slow cooking had the distinct smell which took me 8000 miles away,  that special food-joint in Calcutta, India which all Calcuttans are very fond of.  I could trace that special aroma even in the midst of Tandoor-loin and discovered this hidden small place of Indian food (known as  \"Little Deli\" back then). Immediately became friends with chef  Kamal.  Kamal would cook right infront of you and you could watch the whole procedure and the spices being added. Kamal completely crushed my ego as a cook that I acquired from severe experimentation and practice over past several years. There was not even a single dish that I could compete with him. So I gave up and for the first time became a regular in an Indian restaurant abroad. A lot of times on the weekend nights I had to show up after midnight to beat the crowd!! \r\n\r\nThen came the end, there was no more of that special aroma of Indian food. They closed the place for the hope of finding a bigger place and since December 2005 they are back again.  I am relieved. The menu caters to everyone. If you are a vegetarian, make sure you try out Dal Saag (spinach and lentil cooked with the right consistency) and Paneer Makhani. For non-vegetarians must-try list consists of Shrimp Korma, Tandoori Shrimp, Chicken Dancera (if you don't mind a hint of sweet in chicken) and Lamb Saag.  I will not describe the details of the dishes, because I won't do justice to Kamal. You will have to try it on your own.  Finally, for the authentic Bengalis, make sure you try out Fish curry and Rasamalai (new addition), but for non-authentic people, the bone in the fish may not be that attractive, so beware. Now, at the risk of making Kamal upset, have to say \"Biriyani\" is not the strongest dish of little Delhi.  And who cares about Biryani, when there are so many other great dishes upto the standards of the most popular restaurants in India. \r\n\r\nDon't be turned off by the location, the interior is very clean and well maintained.  Also, this place is same as what you may find under the name \"The little Delhi\" reviewed by others. A big plus is  the proximity from the Powell street Bart station. \r\n\r\nIn general Kamal is quite generous in making things spicy-hot but the degree  does fluctuate quite a bit from time to time.\r\n\r\nLet me finish with the  embarassing confession:  I am really afraid that I might even miss \"Little Delhi\" once or twice when I am on a long vacation in India!! Enjoy the food.", "author": "Kingshuk g."}

I just tried to order from them again and they were so stubborn about giving me a smaill side of Tikka sauce (which I was happy to pay a couple bucks for) that I decided that I'd rather go somewhere else due to the poor customer service.  How difficult is it to put a couple spoons of sauce in a small side container?!!! \"Oh no!  There are rules maam and we can't do that. We can only give you LARGE container of sauce for $5.!\"  Even if you were going to be a loyal repeat customer.... we (obviously) don't care.\"  Welll...... at least that\"s how I interpruted it!  Clearly no economic issues with them!", "author": "h s."}

Their food tastes good, is cooked fresh, and is not oily. Other Indian places have too much oil. The staff is friendly, and cheerful. They have a good selection of dishes too. I highly recommend this place. I take out from this place, once a week, and am a happy customers.", "author": "Kuldeep T."}

Red vinyl everywhere makes it feel like a (clean) diner, but it's strangely cozy.  It was pretty quiet when I went.  The food came quickly and it was tasty and pretty cheap.  Recommend the garlic naan, bengan bharta and the cholay aloo.", "author": "M J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-05-28", "description": "I'm positively a gourmet and have been disappointed with the SF standards with Indian-Pakistani food. Shalimar and Lahore Karahi are greasy (stuff's floating in oil) and have poor ingredients (particularly the vegetables). The attachment to these places is purely a legacy or caused by after-hour drunkenneess (neither of which I'm judging!). \nAnyway, for a genuinely good taste experience, go to a place like Little Delhi. The food doesn't resemble an oil slick and the ingredients are fresh. The chutneys (mint and tamarind) are very good and that makes the chaat dishes. The price tag is very decent too. Curries are 6-8 bucks. Appetizers are 2-4. Enjoy!\nI gave this place four stars not because its the \"best ever\" (the best indian joints are in south bay where the indians are!), but because for a city that is surprisingly poor on good Indian food (have you been to New York?!), Little Delhi is a welcome change, albeit unadventurous.", "author": "Sumant K."}
