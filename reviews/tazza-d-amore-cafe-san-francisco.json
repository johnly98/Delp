They constantly up charge, once they were out of an item so they recommended a replacement. I asked if it was a similar price and they said yes, but it was much more. They will offer add ins without telling you it costs more. For example, I ask them to leave room for cream. They offer to add it in for me and charge me without telling me. After coming here every morning, one day I asked for tap water and they said they'd have to charge. I saw them try to charge a homeless woman for asking for tap water.

Tazza is one of these businesses that have popped up inside the Caltrain station, and they have kept me alive many a mornings with their simple but quick service.\n\nOf course, it's just a little stand in the middle of the station.

There is also a variety of pastries in the window to provide sweet sustenance, but they're not very good from my experience. The cheese danish has made my stomach churn on Caltrain, which is a terrible feeling.\n\nOverall, Tazza gets the job done. I would only come here if I was taking an early train and didn't have time to make myself coffee at home. Seems like it could be a regular morning ritual for many.

The turkey expiry was also very questionable. The edges of the turkey were hardened as well.

When I have time I go to Starbucks and get my coffee and water there.  They do it at Starbucks with a smile.\n\nI was going to jump onto Yelp and give a 4 star review.  An improvement over my last one...cause they do quickly take care of my coffee fix in a challenging setting.  Trains to catch, tiny space. Never a smile or friendly comment...but it is a stressful little hot space to work in within the train station.  I get it.  But before I post, there I see a response to someone else's water complaint.  Management responds that there is a water fountain around the corner.\n\nReally?  Is a 10 cent cup worth making customers feel unappreciated?  Cause in general, that is how I feel here. Maybe when you give me change, say thank you and smile.  \n\nAttitude in a work place is contagious.  Based on the response I saw from management....it pretty much verifies why employees dont seem to enjoy working here.  If it wasnt for the location this place would be broke.  I hope that management makes some changes. Stop being outshone by the large chains down the road.  Connect with your customersn. Let them know you care. And stop tripping over dimes and missing the dollars. \n\nManagement - I want to give you all my coffee business.  I dont, cause the Baristas at starbucks call me by name. They smile. They give me water when I ask. In a nice big cup with ice in it.  They connect.  And they give me coffee rewards.  I can live without the rewards.

So I stopped by to find a worker talking to his friend. I made sure to grab his attention and asked if they had a fork I could have. Before he had a chance to answer, I even offered $0.50 for it. The funny thing is, his friend was even looking around repeating to the employee that I needed a fork. Meanwhile, the employee told me that they were closed (not even a sorry). I responded by saying that I know that they are, but if he had one handy it would be cool. He said that he had to clean-up and that I should look somewhere else (pointing at Subway). I understand they are closed and yes he was taking his sweet ol' time chatting it up with his friend and what they talk about is none of my business. I understand this, but why not be a nice guy... reach over and grab one for me. What happened to generosity? It's not even a feeling of entitlement. It's about being a nice guy.\n\nWith many fantastic cafes in the city, why would you want to support a local business that isn't friendly.

The chocolate cookie was so gross I couldn't eat more than one bite and then I chucked it out. \n\nThe tea brand they use is a pretty poor quality, I think it's stash tea, hey maybe I'm a tea snob, but not the best, the flavor is weak and lacking complexity - my preference for bagged tea is Twinings. Okay so I AM a tea snob! Their Kona coffee blend is decent though, I have no problems with it. Not stupendous, not terrible. Just a good basic cuppa. \n\nSometimes when I'm really pressed and hungry I'll grab one of Sunrise Bakery's sandwiches-of-nastyness (i.e. 1 transparently thin sliver of slimy processed turkey, a baseball-sized wad of sprouts between mealy sprouted wheat slices of gag-bread) but I don't really recommend those unless you like bland health food. \n\nThey do have baskets of fresh fruit so I raid those. \n\nAfter experimenting with Caffe D'Amore, my regular choice is a cup of Kona coffee and a piece of fresh fruit. \n\nBut now that Panera has opened up....I've found my Amore somewhere else....sorry fellas.", "author": "Brianna W."}

They make some tasty iced coffees and mochas, and my only real complaint was that they didn't have a quick pay mechanism for people who just wanted coffee.\n\nIf I was so happy with them, what happened?  One word:  Philz.  \n\nI still go back when I'm running late and don't have time to go to Philz, but let's put it this way:  I've been working on my last buy 10 get 1 free card for about 3 months now.", "author": "Bailey S."}

I have been a big fan of his since he first started with the cart at Caltrain. I am always impressed with his sunny attitude, especially at 7 AM in the morning! Everyone always remembered my drink and my name. I miss it a lot.\nI frequented a coffee cart in New York for many years and loved having a place where I was a \"regular\".

I stopped by one morning since I noticed they had pumpkin spice lattes (woot woot for Starbucks alternatives to things you generally can only get at Starbucks!), but their card reader was down and I had no cash. I thought, oh well, there goes my latte!, but the woman at the register asked if I came through every day, and that I could just stop by next time and they would ring me up then! Didn't ask for a name, didn't hold my license hostage. Frankly, while I might generally trust that a person wouldn't just take advantage of such a situation (karma people, karma!), I'm not sure I trust people's *memories* to remember the favor they owe.\n\nDear reader, so restored was my faith in humanity, I went to the ATM at lunch, and promptly settled my debt on my way home that evening. (Oh yeah, and my pumpkin spice latte was pretty good too).\n\nAlso, they sponsor some pretty good opera singers on Wednesday mornings, which always makes me smile a little when I pass them, and while they don't have a seating area, their kitchen/barista area looks so bright and warm and cozy -- not just a utilitarian coffee stand in a train station.\n---\nUpdate 12/5/07\n\nI swung by the other night for a small hazelnut steamer, which to my great surprise and delight, was only a whopping 85 cents. Sure, it's just milk and syrup, but handing over a dollar and getting change back  for a cozy hot drink just makes me like this place more.", "author": "J C."}

Don't get me wrong, the staff is friendly, and they really care about getting you in and out in time to make the train, but the food they have to work with is such a missed opportunity. I only go there for the convenience. Oh how my life could be so much better if only they sourced their food from any number of 4-stars in the city, like Little Skillet, only a few blocks away. What's worse, they hog the space - they, the Subway, and the news stand (all crappy choices) - put a stranglehold on any possible morning joy for the hordes of commuters they could instead delight.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2005-07-07", "description": "This is the coffee cart outside of the 4th & King Caltrain station.  I know I'm a total cornball, but what excited me the most about this place at first was that they have punch cards...order 10 drinks and get your next one free.  Yeah, no big deal but it's what my favorite cafe back home did so I guess I'm just nostalgic.  Anyway, the coffee is a little hit and miss here, sometimes it is really great and other days (like today) it is a little thin.  They have pretty good pastries from some local bakery (cranberry scone is my favorite).  I haven't tried any of the espresso drinks yet.  The employees are all friendly and efficient which is good because there has always been a bit of a line in the morning.  Of course everyone's getting there just before their train leaves so you get the bonding experience of collectively sweating out whether you'll be able to get your caffeine without missing the train.  Great fun.", "author": "Dan G."}
