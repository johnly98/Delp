But that may have been because she was mixing all kinds of alcohol that night. I stuck to the mainly the dark stuff, so whiskey / scotch / bourbon. We had a good time just talking and just catching up. I do remember talking to the bouncer for a bit who was really nice. (At least I believe it was at this bar.) Although I'm close to being over the hill, I guess I should appreciate being carded every once in a while.\n\nA fun final stop to end a whirlwind Wednesday night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-10-03", "description": "It's a solid bar but there are several things you should know about when deciding to pay a visit. First off, menus seem to be coveted. It might take a while to get one from a bartender, and once you order, it is quickly whisked away which makes it tougher/longer to order a second drink off the menu. Next, some of the drinks are pre-mixed at least the coffee cocktail. Nothing wrong with that but once the pre-measured drink is poured over ice, bartenders mix the drink endlessly for a very long time over lots of ice diluting the drink. I am a fan of stiff cocktails and would rather have smaller more concentrated drinks that diluted ones. I think I timed the mixing of a drink on ice for about 2 minutes (most drinks are mixed 15-20 seconds). I found this pretty absurd if not from an efficiency standpoint. Lastly, there is a selectively enforced credit card minimum of $20 which would be good to know if it was posted somewhere vs. being told after you hand over you card. I appreciate the volume of the bar, long bar seating, seating in the back and seats by the window but those items I pointed out are rather annoying.", "author": "E E."}

We were hungry, and looking for a place with a more spacious and modern vibe, to take our family visiting from out of town.  \n\nThe staff was super friendly, and he helped us get a table to accommodate my wife who uses a wheelchair.  They had a lower bar, as well as booth-like couches and tables to choose from.  We were hungry and didn't realize that they didn't serve food here, so we were immediately disappointed when we didn't see food on the menu.  The guy was super nice and handed us a free pretzel (they're normally $3), and apologized...even though it was our fault.\n\nThe drink selection is nice, and I don't know about the other drinks, but the mosquito coast packed a nice flavorful punch. If we weren't 3 drinks in and starving by this point, I probably would've ordered another.  \n\nIf you're a wheelchair user and need to use the bathroom, look elsewhere.  Their bathrooms are small, have no bars, and we had to use a weird angle to get the chair in and close the door.  \n\nFinal thoughts? It's good for a spot on a bar hopping trip, but when the hunger sets in and the drinks send you to the bathroom, you'll need to look elsewhere if you require more space.", "author": "Ashley S."}

The LGBT-friendly bar in Hayes Valley was a San Francisco institution. Back when I lived in the hood (before it became the posh Hayes Valley 2.0 that it is today), my girlfriend and I would grab a night-cap there and chat with all the regulars (everyone from hipsters to drag queens). Plus, they had a smoking section adjacent to the bar (this was back when I occasionally smoked). And, of course, Marlena's was famous for their over-the-top Christmas decor during the holiday season.\n\nBut alas, all good things must come to an end, and Marlena's was sold to new owners last year and transformed in to Brass Tacks. Needless to say, I was skeptical of the new tenants and their new cocktail lounge-y concept. Fortunately, I'm pleased to report that Brass Tacks is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. The interior is a complete 180 from the old Marlena's. They have a shiny new bar; plenty of black leather couches; lots of modern light fixtures; and open window seating. The place is definitely a nice mix of sexy and comfortable.\n\nBrass Tacks boasts a solid mixology program. All the featured cocktails incorporate a gourmet medley of spirits and flavors. I ordered the Salem's Lot (bourbon, punte e mes, lemon, apple spice). My friends ordered some sort of fancy rum cocktail. \nNow I won't lie to ya - the drinks here aren't cheap ($10 a pop). And they each take 5 minutes to prepare. But if you don't mind the wait and the price, I think you'll be rewarded with a tasty beverage. Who ever created their cocktail program certainly knows what they're doing.\n\nAlthough I miss Marlena's and its colorful characters, I think that Brass Tacks is going to do just fine in this neighborhood. And judging by all the young hipsters and yuppies who showed up for happy hour, I think this bar is off to a great start and can expect to be around for a long time to come.", "author": "Kevin B."}

I did. It was a nice bar. Really great for happy hour with the colleagues. We are a valley company with many people living in the city. It is a great company, mind you, but commute is a bit of a pain. That said, meeting colleagues after work in the Hayes was fun, in particular, this bar, was a great find. Drinks were good. Space was open. And staff was friendly. It's a bit of a young crowd, but I have no problem pretending that I was still in my 20s. While drinking a cocktail, my colleague, the engineer was showing me the new app his team was building. Then, my other colleague and I chatted about France. Two young marketing gals showed up for more drinks. Yep, it's a quintessential San Francisco tech heavy scene. We are in the middle of a gold rush. I remembered the last boom like it was yesterday. I told my colleagues \"Back in the day, I'd come here on dates, buy one of kind clothing, and feeling hip. Then we'd all hang out in North Beach for late night (drinking) activities and for the morning after, Bloody Mary served in any number of restaurants in the Marina. That, of course was before those areas went on to become full on touristy and stuffy.\" They looked at me like I was some eight-headed *ancient* creature. Hayes Valley was hip once, yes, like it was the Mission. Now Hayes Valley has become fully yuppified, overrun by French tourists.\n\nYouth is the most valuable currency of all, and yet youth is wasted on the young. Perhaps if I hang out at this bar long enough, I'd come to appreciate what I have learned, and be thankful that I still look relatively youthful.", "author": "Victoria E."}

To be met with aggro when paying a premium for a cocktail is just not on.  \n\nI'll be only too glad when this current trend of hippishly mod snobbery grows out of itself and the neighborhood returns to a reflection of what real cool in the City actually is:  genuine, down to earth, authentic human beings who treat one another in a friendly, warm, kind manner.\n\nDisappointed for the last time here.", "author": "Casey H."}

There's a lot of similarities between the two, starting with the hip/trendy/industrial/wood/metal/leather lounge look. You know, like the place where you'd go sporting a smart mustache and raw denim jeans that's cuffed. Another similarity are the serious cocktails. The drinks are pretty strong and dressed up with fancy ingredients. I found it to be a learning experience. I had Her Majesty's Secret Service, which was strong and woody. It was similar to an Old Fashioned, but with more to it. I also tried the To Wong Foo and also learned the reference. It was sweet and strong. Any drink with grapefruit flavor is good in my book. I tried the Valley Club with gin and it tasted summery and sweet as well. There was also something called Knife in the Water, which was no cocktail I've ever seen. I forget what was in it, probably an apertif, but it was served in a tiny stemmed glass and looked like a solid amethyst crystal. The Hella Berry Rum Punch was okay. It had a generous amount of berries in it, but it didn't seem all that well mixed. Some berries were added in the end for garnish rather than flavor. The beers on tap were nothing new to me, except the Bockor Cuvee des Jacobins Rouge. It was a Belgian sour beer served in a very small glass. It tasted like liquid dried cherries. The draft Racer 15 and canned Oskar Blues Pale Ale was a favorite among my group. Bartenders were nice and friendly, but also very serious about their craft. They can definitely use more people behind the bar though. This place gets crowded very fast because it's not that big. I liked that their background music is played with vinyl. There are 2 restrooms and a digital jukebox that is placed way too high :(\n\nThis place is also DOG-FRIENDLY!", "author": "Jennifer W."}

It was fine, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go back.", "author": "Liz W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-25", "description": "This place is what I would call a classy dive bar. It is definitely a divey place, but it features house cocktails, which I have tried, and they are delicious. What I think is really the seller for me and why I dub this place as \"classy\" is that their \"well\" liquor is actually decent. I know this fact because when we ordered tequila shots, the bartender picked up the tequila bottle from the well. I was about to stop him, but the bottle read \"100% blue agave\" and then when we had it, it was actually pretty smooth. In all likelihood, most people probably don't even care, but as a bartender, I am definitely sold on this aspect of this place. Personally, when my friends want to go to Biergarten, I would rather just go down the block and come here... but I am usually overruled :( . However, we always come by here afterwards :) . It's also a great place to hang out if you have just put your name down at Patxi's on the other side of the street and are expecting a 45 minute wait. However, even if you are just looking for a place to come and hang out with some friends, I would definitely recommend Brass Tacks. As I said in the beginning: a CLASSY dive bar.", "author": "Kunal N."}

I gotta say I really like what they've done with the place. Hardwood floors and blown glass lighting give the place a more modern vibe. And they're still dog friendly. Pretty awesome. The bar tenders were nice enough to make us a couple of mimosas and chat while some old school hip hop played in the background. Can't wait to hang out here more.", "author": "Judy L."}

Since i live in the neighborhood its refreshing to have an awesome cocktail bar open up with bartenders who are super knowledgeable and know what they're talking about.

But, as with many \"premium\" cocktail joints across the City (see, e.g., Rickhouse, Bloodhound), the atmosphere sucks so hard that I'd almost pay money NOT to hang out here. Guys, the room is a long shoe-box with nothing on the walls to dampen the sound. Do you REALLY need the music to be that loud? Can't you see EVERYBODY in the place straining to hear one another?\n\nI like cocktails. But I like talking to my friends even better.

Literally. She picked it up - declared the location a fire hazard - and walked off with it. We were five drinking adults (with four seats) in an overcrowded bar (see all other reviews - they all remind you that the place is crowded) with two credit cards at the bar. No apologies as I asked for it back - no effort to make it up to us. Just a cold hard stare as she walked away.... Last time I go back until/unless they track me down and apologize. I'll let you know.", "author": "Alex B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-20", "description": "One has to have a lot of style and personality to open a bar that can become a local favorite--Marlena had that. This place just seems like every other place that is opening up. Reclaimed wood; utilitarian, post-industrial stripped down; precisely measured shots in a lab glass (just give it a healthy pour!). The music was good, but incredibly loud, so after awhile we moved venues--it was just too piercing. You have to scream to hear each other. The crowd was very homogeneous, but no wonder given the ubiquity of the design. This place needs to find an identity and integrate itself into the community if I'm going to come back. There's no trace of Marlena or the old place anywhere, which is sad and disrespectful. San Francisco is painting over itself. The service was very good though and the drinks fairly priced.", "author": "Jerry P."}
