We stopped by after strolling through Golden Gate park. The beer selection is pretty good. Some beers are rare and priced a bit too high for my taste. Which you might say that I should not order it. However, if the price was listed along with the pour size of the beer then I would not have ordered it.", "author": "David F."}

We ordered a pitcher during happy hour and it came out to $23 before tip, which was kind of pricey for what it was.  When we were walking around later we saw many neighboring bars had much better deals at around $12/pitcher.  \n\nThe beer we got wasn't that great either.  I had to check the menu at one point to make sure we didn't order a non-alcoholic drink because our beer was so watery and light.  \n\nIn addition to this, the bartender wasn't the most friendly or welcoming, and she told a few of our friends who joined us later to leave.  \n\nOverall, this bar will definitely have the sports you want to watch, but they have subpar drinks at really high prices.  Their happy hour isn't really a happy hour in my opinion, and the service was okay at best.  Will definitely be trying out some other places in the area as alternatives.", "author": "Tim L."}

My cousin and I each had a beer and the service was decent. But, the tone of our experience changed when the dark haired female Irish bartender asked my cousin to remove his sunglasses because \"sunglasses aren't allowed.\" He proceeded to respectfully explain that they are prescription sunglasses and that he didn't have regular glasses with him and wouldn't be able to see without them. If we had already finished our beers we would have just left right then, but we were only about half way done. He squinted his way through the rest of our visit to Blackthorn. We will not be returning. I was shocked at this policy considering that he needed his glasses to see. The policy was not explained at all and we left immediately after finishing our drinks.

I never had any bad experiences, always just had one cider or wine and left.  I never had any conversation or interaction with anyone except one of the Irish bartenders, a very nice brunette.  On my last visit (and it will be the last), there was a blond Irish woman bartender.  I don't recall meeting her before, I greeted her politely and she responded politely.  Then, much to my total surprise, she informed me that she could not serve me.  I thought she was kidding.  Upon inquiry, she said there was an \"incident\".  News to me, so I asked for some details.  She had no info, was not witness to any incident, and was quite vague as to when this occurred or what this incident involved. She first said that it was \"last week or maybe two weeks ago\" (I was in Alaska during that period). I told her I was not going to argue with her, but told her I think there must be some mistake and I left.  Seeking clarification of why I was not being served, I sent an email asking for clarification as it was clear that there must be some mistake.  I did not get the courtesy of a response.  I have been a long-time customer of their other bar, The Cabin on Polk, since they opened quite a few years ago.  Never any issues.  Won't return there now either.

Of course, majority of the people in the bar were rocking their warriors gear. (Bandwagoners.... jk haha) \n\nIt also happened to be trivia night. Which means... People get into groups and create a team name. The M.C. asks questions about current events, pop culture, etc. and after all the questions have been asked you switch papers with another group and grade it. Whichever team gets the most right wins a prize. My team didn't win.

Let me tell you why:\n\n- KARAOKE TUESDAY is super fun! Stay away if you don't like crowds, though, it usually gets pretty packed! The more drunken bad singing, the better.\n\n- LOADS of TVs. Great for sports. And this is a sports town, how 'bout that.\n\n- It is not halfway as smelly/sticky/musty/crusty as Mucky Duck or the Little Shamrock.\n\n- IT TAKES CREDIT CARDS (boo, Yancy's).\n\n- They have pool AND pinball! *Thumbs up*\n\n- It's the only place I've found my beloved Hell or High Watermelon on tap around here... am I not looking hard enough?\n\n- Huge comfy booths nice for collapsing in with your work crew after a long day at the office.\n\n- Friendly bartenders! One thing I will say I do not like though, is that say, you may order a particular shot of something on one day, and have it be $6, and you'll be like, \"wow, that is a great price for that particular shot!\" And then a couple days later you'll go and order another round of that same whiskey or whatever and suddenly it'll be like $8-9 each... wtf? It's happened to me on separate occasions already. I usually just suck it up and pay whatever they're asking on the day sans complaining, but I just wish there was a little more consistency.", "author": "Theresa C."}

They had a pool table & supposedly, a pool league which is amazing. It looked like a lot of the locals take part in that. You also get to meet some new people which is always a lot of fun. There is also an arcade game in the corner. They have a single restroom for men & women. Unrelated to the bar, there was an incident with an impatient woman who was clearly inebriated.

Nice customer service, guy.\n\nWhen I signed out, I did not include my tip on the card because I wanted to give the tip to the only guy that helped me: The Bearded Bartender who couldn't have been nicer.

I waited for the Bearded One to come back from his break and handed him his tip in cash. \n\nThis morning, my statement shows that the Blackthorn charged me a tip anyway!

As a Giants fan, any free Giants gear is a win since they can be quite expensive!

I purposely ordered a Blue Moon thinking that I would get a free tumbler.  I was quite disappointed when the waitress informed us that it's only a promotion they run on Fridays..however the promotion on Tuesdays when the Giants are playing is the raffle of 2 tickets to an upcoming home game.

I'm pretty bad luck when it comes to raffles (I don't think i've ever won anything) so I told myself it's probably gonna be bad seats anyway.

Unfortunately, this year, they sponsored a Sunday Kickball League so at 1 p.m. non-football watchers pour into the bar to *not watch football* and play flipcup.

I'm honestly shocked that with some of the piercing shrieks, the windows haven't shattered.\n\nThat's fine if Blackthorn wants to be more like a frat house than a football bar. I know it works for the kickball/flipcup players.

But I love this bar.\n\nIf you are a soccer/football fan like me, you have very few choices in this country (although it is getting better). \n\nMost times you end up in some sports bar where all of the TVs are playing some useless sport (baseball, for example) and the world's greatest sport--the real football, the beautiful game--is relegated to a TV that looks like the size of those TVs on JetBlue. \n\nNot at Blackthorn. I came to watch Bayern Munich lose to, well, Bayern Munich in the Champions league and the game was on every TV. Nice and big, in HD. Droga's face in 60 inches of HD glory. As it should be. \n\nThey don't serve food here. Another reason to love the place. You can bring outside food and order a soda. Or a beer. Or whatever your poison is.

The cover charge was about $5 less than at Silver-Cloud on fight nights, which translates to more money for drinks! Lots of viewing screens and bartenders who were quick to jump on the switch from the network broadcast of Spiderman to the main fight card once it started. Also, they've got a menu of local eateries up at the bar that you can peruse through to order in, which was pretty convenient. A bartender even lassoed us up when our food arrived so we could lay claim to it.
