The brown rice was out and the girl was seriously going to scoop the crusty dry bits and pieces for me from the container, I didn't want burnt rice so I opted for the white rice which ended up being mushy.\n\nThe steak was really dry and didn't have that typical Chipotle juicy steak charbroiled flavored. I felt like I was chewing a dry erase marker. \n\nAlso not sure why but this location seems to have smaller ingredient containers than the other locations. You'd think they would have bigger circumferences for the main stapes like the rice, beans, and salad but nope they're all of equal size which I'm assuming makes things less efficient because you always have to replenish.", "author": "Connie M."}

Went through the line and everything was ok, not stellar service but not horrible. \nWent and got a table and when she opened her burrito, it fell apart. The guy did a horrible wrapping job. So my friend went back up to the counter to ask for another one and the guy laughed and said he'd have to ask his manager. The manager came and gave her a new burrito but when she came and sat back down, there were two employees who were pointing and laughing at her (young Asian guy and young African American girl). When she looked at them, they were waving and pointing and kept laughing. So I'm seeing this, I went up to them to ask them their names and the African American girl (think her name is kaylen or something close to that) wouldn't tell me her name, scoffed at me and my friend and then walked away. The \"manager\" asked me what was wrong and I told him and he was like \"I was watching them the whole time, they did nothing wrong\". Like cmon dude... the whole restaurant saw this and you're blatantly lying to my face. Even the customers that were sitting down said we were right and saying them mocking her. I asked the \"manager\" what his employees names were and he said he didn't have to tell me. So I asked him what his name was, he said it was Vince. I told him I wanted to talk to someone higher up than him, so he gave me Edgar's card. Edgar is the only saving grace for this restaurant. I told him what happened and he was very gracias and apologetic on the phone... that's how customer service should be.  As for the other employees, learn how to treat your customers.

However, after having visited so many Chipotle locations, it has been my experience that this issue is far and wide a problem at Chipotle restaurants.\n\nHere the story: \n\nChipotle, San Francisco Fisherman Wharf, 1/11/2018 - \n\nI ordered a Burrito and a Bowl. The person serving at the counter asked the typical question about which rice type I would have liked on my order. I asked for white rice. \nThe first problem was that there was NOT rice left in the container and he literally scraped from the bottom and sides all that he could gather from what was left, then placed this rice on my orders; not appealing. \n\nI asked: \"Don't you have fresh rice?\"\nAnswer: \"we are making new rice, then he looked at me without saying a word for few seconds after which he muttered, what meat?\"\n\nPerhaps this person should have ask me to hold on so that they could replace the rice container with a new batch of rice, assuming that Chipotle keeps its ingredients ready to be replaced. Not sure at this location, but I decided to overlook this issue.\n\nI asked for Barbacoa on the burrito. The server placed about a table spoon size of meat on it, perhaps 1 once of it. Seriously, I looked at him and asked him if he thinks that is the correct portion of meat serving. He just looked at me , again for few seconds, and said: \"Nothing else\"?.... \n\nI repeated the question about the meat portion size, and I added: \"Can you add more meat to this order, because it is obviously not enough, it does not seems right\".\nSince this guy may have been either smoked, drunk, utterly clueless, or just stared working at Chipotle, a co-worker of his responded to me in his behalf: \n\"If you want more meat, cost more money... you have to pay extra\".\n\nWell, that is fair if the initial portion was what you are entitled with your initial purchase, but this was not the case, of course in my honest opinion.\n\nI argued with this other employee, that the amount of meat served could not have been correct, at which she responded: \"This is our portion size, 4 once of meat\".\nI was laughable since first, this person obviously does not know what 4 ounces of meat may look like (1/4 of pound) and second, the employeee that was originally taking the order did not weight the portion (they do not do that at Chipotle) but just placed an arbitrary amount on top of the rice. \n\nI asked: \"Do you think that meat on the burrito is 4 ounces\"?\nAnswer: \"yes, is our standard size\"\n\nAgain, I must have ordered in my lifetime maybe 100 burritos at Chipotle, and never had a discussion about meat, or for any other matter with an employee there. Although it is never scientific the amount of meat they place on their burrito (it is arbitrary, at the discretion of the server) it is somewhat reasonable at eye sight, albeit never the same.\nIn this case, it was so ludicrous the amount of serving they provided me, that I could not have said nothing.\n\nAnyway, getting back to the event, to her answer (\"yes, is our standard size\"), I replied: \"why do not you go and weight the meat on this burrito\".\n\nAt this point she went in the back of the kitchen, and presumably when to talk to some one over there.\n\nThey never weighted the meat, nor they reasonably looked at the order and properly added meat to correct the portion (which I think it was by far the most reasonable thing to do, than argue with a client). Rather, these 20-21 years old kids gang together like I was a fool, and that they could care less. Obviously I did not complete my purchase and refused my order.\n\n\n\nTo Chipotle Corporate: You are a disgrace to have a store be ran like that. Perhaps the touristic location of this restaurant let you care less of this customer base, but the whole serving process, and attitude of your employess, I hope will contribute to the natural FAILURE of all your chain.\n\nOnce you have poisoned your customers, then used GMO, then you can not even provide consistency with your food.\n\nNOT GOOD BUSINESS!", "author": "C B."}

Everything was expensive we we were planning to go to In N Out, but the like was insanely long so we decided to get chipotle since it was right down the street. I work at a place similar to chipotle but with Korean food called Bibigo, and the way it runs is just the same as chipotle. What I've learned from working in a chain restaurant like this is that you must have outstanding customer service. The workers must make the guests feel welcomed because it's the customers who allow the workers to have a job. Right as soon as it was my turn to make an order, the girl approached my dad and I with a frown and asked us what we wanted, but her tone and attitude sounded like she didn't give a shit about us. So I just made my usual order of a bowl with white rice, no beans, chicken, veggies, 3 scoops of corn, cheese, and lettuce. As soon as I asked for 3 scoops of corn, the Asian girl gave me a dirty look and then looked at the first girl who took my order, and the put 3 small scoops of corn in my bowl with a disgusting attitude. Then as soon as we got to the cashier, the guy there with glasses rang us up at the register, but there was a frown on his face and he seemed so done with everything. The food was actually good, but they ran out water and spoons and forks, so they just didn't even care about their restaurant.

After about 5 minutes, one of the stores employees comes up to our table and all the other tables that had people eating and rudely said \"we are closed now and you have to leave\". \n\nYou mean to tell me I just spent 30 dollars on food to be kicked out? If I would have known that I would be kicked out, I would of never ordered food from there. I asked to speak to the manager and told him my situation. I told him I would like a refund as this was very unprofessional to kick someone out when they are in the middle of eating. His response was \"you already finished your food\". After I pointed to my wife walking out the door with ALL of our food he said \"I'll give you 5 minutes to finish. I said this is absolutely ridiculous and very unprofessional of you and your staff. The option to eat in should of never been offered, as I would of found some other place to eat at if I'd know my family and I would get kicked out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-16", "description": "Cut to the chase: My bowl was so empty it could've had a flat lid!\n\nLong version:\nOk before I go off, three nice things that gave this place an extra star: The lines are short, the place is clean, and the manager is nice even though he has to deal with a bunch of punks. Maybe the workers suck so bad no one wants to go here which keeps the lines short, which results in a clean store. The extra star is just for the manager then.\n\nThree of us went in today and they skimped on every bit of the process except the tortillas, which would be impossible to minimize. I was going to ask for half carnitas and sofritas but the girl gave me a stank look after she scooped a 'full' portion of carnitas she just passed it along. Their definition of full is equivalent to the size of 2-3 chicken McNuggets, enough for a toddler maybe.\n\nThey were running low on rice so instead of doing their jobs and bringing more out, they split about 2 servings into 5 (we took some orders to go as well). When you ask for more rice, they will practically count each grain. 'More guac' (after a shady ass 1/4 spoonful) to them means to give about the size of how much toothpaste you'd put on your brush. After seeing the anemic portions, the manager insisted the workers give more of whatever we wanted, so I asked for sofritas. She gave me about 1/4 of a spoonful and passed it on, then the other girl tried charging me for it! I would've walked out but the manager pretty much forced her against her will to hook it up. My bowl was still not full enough to need a 3-dimensional lid but I just don't have much patience to deal with dumb people.\n\nMy co-worker was so scared that I had to go up and ask for a salsa to go for her. It's one of those places where anything you ask for you'll either get the absolute minimum, or a dirty ass look, or both. They make you repeat everything as if you're ordering in Spanish. The workers are so shady it seems like they wake up early to slaughter their own animals, pick their own vegetables and cook one grain of rice at a time.\n\nI would be a little more sympathetic if this wasn't some giant conglomerate that makes billions of dollars per year. I'm serious, they made $2.7 billion last year, so it makes no sense why they're so shady with their portions. There was no one else in line! They rushed us as if the President was waiting, twiddling his thumbs after us.\n\nOh, worst of all, my friend found two bones in a burrito bowl. One of them looked like a petrified piece of asparagus, or maybe a chicken's toe? Something disgusting.\n\nIf you go here, be prepared to eat two bananas to make up for the food that should've filled the lid.", "author": "Eric C."}

(brown rice, black beans, cheese, guacamole, medium salsa) and it was easily the worst burrito I've eaten in 20 years. Admittedly, someone who chooses Chipotle in a town with so many other local burrito options has no real reason complaining about the food, I happened to be near the Wharf and wanted something quick, consistent and reliable. \n\nThe steak was of the lowest grade imaginable and was completely undercooked -- to the point of causing alarm. The burrito was wrapped into the shape of a deflated volleyball, but what can you expect from a fast-food worker who doesn't see burritos as an \"aspirational vocation?\" -- and all for nearly 11 dollars. That's what I'd expect to pay for a high-quality \"artisan\" burrito anywhere else in the city, resulting in a 5-star rating. \n\nOther than that, it was a very clean location, and Chipotle's signage, decor, staff and appointments are all as charming and adequate as I've come to expect. \n\nI'm generally down with Chipotle as a \"fast-food\" option in a pinch, but you have no idea what you're going to get when you patronize the location on Fisherman's Wharf.

But for me, Chipotle is in a different league.  I actually like this chain -- they serve quality food (hormone free meats, some organic veggies, most everything cooked in house), and depending on your choices, healthy too.  \n\nI came here tonight after a 6.2 mile run, exhausted, not really wanting to cook, and so I picked up a burrito bowl for a late dinner-- cilantro rice piled high with raw veggies, black beans, corn, salsa, lettuce and meat.  Mostly healthy, right?  And pretty delicious.  \n\nNo, Chipotle's and a Mission burrito aren't even comparable- it's obvious that the Mission wins out every time.  I have to say that for what they do serve, they definitely do it well.  So if you're nowhere near the Mission and wanting something in Fisherman's Wharf that's not deep fried or In-N-Out, then Chipotle really isn't a bad choice.  \n\nAnyway, I'm so glad to have this place finally open in Fisherman's Wharf!

When i realized that the Game Store at the Wharf had been shut down and replaced by this new place, I figured I had to see what this new Chipotle craze was about since the one downtown was always packed.\n\nSo one day while debating between In N Out, Hooters, King of Thai, Subway, or Boudins, me and my girlfriend decided to check out Chipotle to try out the new spot. Being that I only am aware of traditional Mexican American spots with your typical burrito and taco orders along with dinner plates, Chipotle proved to be a refreshing new place.\n\nWhen I first saw their menu and food options, I criticized them in my mind contemplating how they could have such few options and why it was all healthier than a typical Mexican spot in the mission. This was easily answered as its name Chipotle Mexican Grill is obviously misleading; however don't let this prevent you from giving it a try.\n\nThey offer your typical burrito, tacos, and quesadilla selections as would any restaurant with calorie information if you are watching your figure. What really intrigued me was the BURRITO BOWL!\n\nThe burrito bowl, basically the only thing I buy here, is a great creation. You start with your selection of cilantro-lime rice (yes, I too was surprised by the rice selection) or brown rice (evidence of healthy eating) and build your bowl by adding your choice of beans-pinto or black-followed by your choice of meat-carnitas, carne asada, chicken, etc. then you add your veggies, which include lettuce, guacamole (an additional $2.00), sour cream, then your choice of sauce (I always get the red sauce, beet part of this place), but their sauces are not hot/spicy at all and of course dont forget the cheese. I also buy a bag of Chips for $1.25 (yes, sadly Chips here aren't complimentary, not Mexican restaurant like at all) to accompany my eating of the burrito bowl.\n\nI can keep on going with a detailed description of a burrito bowl but maybe it's best you try it for yourself. The burrito bowl is the only reason I would go to chipotle just to eat something different and because of this, it merits four stars in my opinion. \n\nBut please, do not refer to it as a Mexican spot, because it's not; 100% American in my opinion.

They were the most unprofessional people I've ever seen. \n\nThey were out of brown rice when we ordered, but not a huge deal. Well, then as we ate, they ran out of cilantro rice too. Likely because they were so disorganized. The restaurant was disgustingly dirty because not once did anyone come from behind the counter to wipe anything down. \n\nIn short, glad I don't live here if this is the service I get.", "author": "Chris S."}

I went once... and now I'm not excited about it anymore.\n\nThere are a few things that bother me about Chipotle. \n\n1. No Chipotle sauce.  I asked for Chipotle sauce and I was told that they don't actually have any. I chose this restaurant based on the fact that it was named \"CHIPOTLE\" with the hopes that it would offer Chipotle sauce on their tacos. The Codmother next door has amazing fish tacos with a special creamy sauce. This establishment just offers the basics for a higher price.\n2. No Shrimp or Fish tacos. I know I'm probably asking a lot but there are a lot of Mexican restaurants in the area with Camarones as an option in the Tacos and Burritos. I really love Shrimp.\n3. No Olives - I realize this is more of a Puerto Rico/Spain thing. I just feel that if you can offer seasoned corn as a fillings option, you could throw some black olives into the mix too. \n4. $$Cost$$ - I figured since it is a major chain and it's offering just the basics, they could offer a better price as a motivation for customers to visit their restaurant over an authentic Mexican restaurant with more options. I was not impressed with the price or portion sizes. \n\nI had heard a lot of great things about Chipotle and I left feeling sorely disappointed by the experience. I don't understand the hype.\n \nNote: I gave it two stars because the food was fresh enough. I did not have food poisoning or digestive problems after consuming the meal. The restaurant was relatively clean and watching the bush man scare the death out of wandering tourists while I ate my meal was amusing.", "author": "Daisy F."}

Just for reference I ordered a bowl and a burrito to go and both were the smallest I have ever had. \n\nI am not the type of person that likes to ask for more but, I should have known when the lady didn't charge me for the 10 cent bag.  The lady scoping the food never looked up at me because she would have seen the look on my face saying, \"you can't be serious.\"\n\nBut wait it gets worse!  I guess no one orders brown rice as this location.  There were several bits of dried hard rice in the burrito when I finally got it home.  I would have brought it back but I was too far and too tired to fight over $7. \n\nThere is a difference between having not enough water when cooking rice and rice drying out after cooking.  This was drying rice after cooking. Growing up Asian you quickly learn about left over rice.  You guys can slip this by some people but believe me, Asians may not know how to drive that well, but we know our rice.\n\nWould have been zero star but that is not an option.", "author": "Ronald C."}
