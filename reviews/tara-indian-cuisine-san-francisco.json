Restaurant is casual with no wait  \n\nFOOD: \n- Paneer tikka masala--this is my favorite paneer tikka I've had in the Bay Area so far. The paneer comes in larger pieces so you have the pleasure of breaking it apart. This affords you the experience of the density and body paneer has, unappreciated pre-Tara. The paneer in this dish isn't as browned as in the other paneer dishes I've had, which I appreciate for the softer texture and flavor. I find biting into it thrilling!\n\n- Saag paneer--large pieces of paneer are a delight, and not something I knew I wanted until they arrived in my Eat24 order from Tara. The curry itself is of course delicious--plenty of spinach and not overboard on the cream. Though I feel very full about 3/4 of the way through, I never feel as though I have eaten myself into heavy oblivion (always a risk for me with delicious Indian!). \n \n- Naan--I love it! It's a like a naan/roti hybrid when it comes to texture, a little chewy with just the right amount of oil to impart flavor but not excess grease. I'm not sure if the \"chewier naan\" is authentic or not (I usually receive a more bready variety), but it certainly keeps much better as takeout than the bready variety (so oft stale and cold by the time it arrives). \n\n- Vegetarian momo--among the more flavorful momo I've had. While the wrapper was stuck to the steamer basket and the other momo, I thought the well spiced interior (cinnamon? Cumin?) and the flavorful dip made up for it. Ate every last one!\n\n- Mango lassi--on the more yogurty, tart side. Not too sweet or thick, which makes it a refreshing accompaniment to the meal. \n\n- Rice--basmati and flavorful. Grains are not as long as they come. Aroma is nice.\n\nSERVICE: the servers are incredibly kind and attentive. We were checked on several times throughout the meal and water was refilled without asking.  \n\nAMBIANCE: this is excellent for a casual meal. I appreciate the environment for what it is--there's wood cutout wainscoting, bare hipster bulbs amid older fashioned soft yellow lamps, and paintings of sculptures (less complicated than it sounds).  \n\nFor those on the polish patrol, the interior is a little musty, the carpets are a touch past their prime, and  the ceiling tiles are of the perforated white variety I would count in middle school to pass the time.  But this makes sense for the price point and does not merit star deduction. Come for the food and enjoy the restaurant for what it is!", "author": "Helen W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-04", "description": "I'm really starting to like this place even though I had not been tempted to try it when it was called Bombay for years. The first time was about four months back when it was fairly empty, and I had stumbled on it when I noticed I'd be waiting quite a while for the next F-Line streetcar eastward. The server was most attentive and served complimentary Papadum with three savory-to-sweet dipping sauces (photo: http://bit.ly/29hKvzi). I noticed above me was a flat-screen TV, and an elaborate Bollywood movie musical production was being shown. Even though I'm sure most customers would want to see a Giants game, I rather enjoyed this atmospheric touch since they were just showing dance ensemble numbers and not entire films.\n\nFor a starter, I went for the $4.95 Cucumber Tomato Salad which was simply slices of cucumber and tomato on a plate (photo: http://bit.ly/29rqB7G). It was fresh so I didn't mind the simplicity of it. My main dish was the $13.95 Lamb Shank, a huge portion of meat falling right off the bone since it had been braised for 24 hours, and it was sitting in a pool of their onion-tomato cream sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/29hKsDM). Delicious comfort food accompanied by a $1.95 serving of Basmati Rice (photo: http://bit.ly/29khFBm). It was all served quite efficiently with just enough time for me to catch the F. Months later, and it was PRIDE Saturday with the Castro especially crowded with revelers. I suggested Tara to Jamie W. thinking it might not be as crowded as other spots. I was wrong.\n\nBut fortunately for us, one table for two opened up quickly, and it was the same table I dined at the first time, and another glitzy Bollywood musical number was playing on the flat-screen. This time we tried the $13.95 Coconut Lamb Curry which chunks of the same lamb shank and had them swimming in a luxuriant coconut curry sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/29Iu11G). Basmati Rice was needed, of course, and we complemented the lamb with the $10.95 Bhindi Masala, frankly a much fresher take on the braised okra dish in onion-tomato gravy (photo:  http://bit.ly/29dM9z4). there was so much saucy goodness on he table we ordered the $2.95 Garlic Naan, plenty enough for the requisite sopping (photo: http://bit.ly/29oXpfI). Our server was the same as the first visit, and he was just as attentive even in a crowded house.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...really tasty lamb dishes and a fresh bhindi masala moves this one up the ranks of Indian spots in the city\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...a bit dark with the requisite Rajastani touches\nSERVICE - 4 stars...this young server's enthusiasm goes unabated\nTOTAL - 4 stars...the Castro finally has a solid Indian spot at last", "author": "Ed U."}

The chicken tikka masala and the lamb saag were both good, but if I had to choose I would say the lamb saag was slightly better. I ordered them both mild simply because this was the default setting and I will say there was no kick to them at all so if you want some spice make sure you switch from the default setting.

The samosas were also very tasty. Crispy on the outside and soft inside.\n\nI'm not normally a fan of biryani and this one didn't change my mind.

They have only improved in the two years since I moved in nearby, and this restaurant now astounds with every order. \nThe biryani and garlic naan is my go-to, a literally perfect meal to me. The lamb biryani I ordered today is so flavorful, even better than last time, and I have literally been more and more impressed every time i order. For instance I used to find whole spices, such as cloves and bay leaves, inside of the rice. Now, there is only a flavorful and substantial serving of pure, edible, healthy goodness in my biryani. It wasnt much to complain about in the first place, spices come with the territory, but yet they have continued to improve. Their deserts are fantastic, by the way, though I always order a Kabuli na'an for desert and it's simply delectable. \nThis is the best Indian cuisine in San Francisco during the in between hours of 3pm-5pm, hands down, I feel like they are there for me when other nice places are closed. Thank you all at Tara!", "author": "Trevor L."}

Their style of food is a refreshing blend that I find unfamiliar yet attractive. A complementary plate of very delicate Sun Dried Lentil Wafers/Papadum was placed on our table as friendly servers helped us with our menu selections.\n\nAt $2.95 their Garlic Naan and the $3.95 Onion Kulcha were inexpensive and met our expectations. At $8.95 the Chicken Momos with Himalayan spices were juicy and plentiful.\n\nThe $12.95 Coconut Chicken Curry was yummy and, at $13.95 the Coconut Lamb Curry still had that wonderful essence of lamb in a similarly delicious base of coconut milk, tomato and onion.\n\nWe concluded with the $2.00 Masala Chai, a bit sweet and two deserts.  The $3.95 Gulab Jamun which were donut-like balls touched with light syrup and their $3.95 Mango Kulfi, which is similar to ice cream yet much lighter, both were uniquely different.", "author": "Caesar A."}

All the waiters that work here are overly eager, which already tells me that I'll be in good hands throughout my meal. With freshly-cut roses, Bollywood music videos playing on the TV, and Indian art on the walls, the ambiance was set. This is the perfect date place.\n\nOur meal started with complimentary papadum with three dipping sauces. All of them were delicious. We also had Flying Horse beer which is perfectly light and will not overpower the flavor of your food. Naturally we ordered samosas for our appetizer which were so good, especially with the dipping sauces that came with the padadum. Instantly, I relived the time when I tried to make samosas but failed miserably.\n\nFor our entree, we got the lamb rogan josh and chicken vindaloo. Even though we ordered \"medium spicy\" the curries came out mild. Otherwise, they were not bad. Went well with the basmati rice and garlic naan that we also ordered. The garlic naan is amazing, by the way. This was not the best Indian curry I've had, but I get the feeling that this food will get better in the coming months. Still quite delicious. Part of me wishes I had ordered some kheer to end the meal on a sweet note, but I'll have to come back to try that.\n\nThere's always a handful of places in each city that I'll always take guests to.

Could have maybe used just a dash more seasoning (not chili but maybe a pinch of salt or something). The kofta in it were good as well and I'm glad I ordered the kofta curry over paneer as I was debating between the two.

Great ambiance around with some decent portraits. Ordered an Non vegetarian lunch special for $9.99\n\nOrder came in like 10-12 mins(they make fresh bread for every order). It had two slices of Nan(Indian bread),3 curries(Lamb curry, Chicken tikka masala, Shai paneer), a bowl of rice and a desert kheer. Liked lamb curry it was boneless lamb cubes cooked with tomatoes and Indian spices. Overall its was a good lunch for 10 bucks.

The sauce was a bit on the sour side\n\nNaan: we ordered the chicken and lamb naan. The chicken naan was very very dry\n\nChicken tika masala and chicken tandoori: these dishes were the reasons this review was not a 1 star. Both were quite delicious.\n\nLamb shank: This dish was inedible. The meat was so hard and tough that we gave up trying to cut it with a steak knife. \n\nWhen asking for our check, we politely notified our waiter about the lamb dish. He proceeds to poke it a bit with a knife and saying \"No. It's supposed to be like that.\" He comes back with our check and says, \"I asked the chef and he says its normal.\" This was a blatant lie since he was in my line of sight the entire time. A simple apology would have done wonders. This is one place we definitely won't be coming back.\n\nOur overall dining experience was poor.

It's nearby,  they even deliver,  the food has consistent every time I've returned.  \nI couldn't believe they've got only 87 reviews so I wanted to add one!

It'll be even more rare for me to get out to Spicy Bite. If you don't know if Spicy Bite and are looking for Indian food check them out as well as Tara.  Both are phenomenal cuisine!", "author": "Jason C."}

There was on old number on eat 24 and the delivery person was trying to contact me. He had already tired several times and left, when I eventually got to him he was kind enough to come back and deliver and was very polite. The food was great! The right spice and flavor... The sides of chutney and yogurt were very well made as well. Will definitely try out other stuff on their menu.", "author": "Tanya K."}

We got the thali for two and added malai kopta and parata to share between 3 people, a little disappointed that the thali didn't come in the traditional metallic serving bowls but just as an assortment of dishes, but everything was delicious nonetheless. Deducted one star because the place gets really stuffy with the fumes from the dishes and no open windows.", "author": "Noa E."}

Excellent Indian food, for sure.", "author": "Mister M."}

Tasty Indian food.i had the Chicken Tikka Masala it was solid.Service was good. Prices mid-range. And very reasonable..food is very authentic..try their biryani chicken kabab or lamb chops!! dont miss the kheer!!If you are looking for something ethnic and local, trying to avoid the typical tourist fare, this was great Indian food. In that you can sit at a table, then head up to the counter to order. However the food is too good.I had a number of dishes--all quite delicious. I felt better for getting to eat so many non veg dishes when so much in the area for the authentic biryani.", "author": "Abhinav P."}

I have those moments where I worry that one day I will be greeted like Miranda on Sex in the City and then be too ashamed to ever show my face there again.... but they are SO nice here and I believe that they really value their \"regulars.\" Prices are great and the food is my favorite in the city. You know how with some curries, when you open the plastic container there is a layer of grease chillin on top that you aren't sure if you should try to drain or mix in?..... they don't have that!!! Their curries are so smooth, everything I have ordered is so delicious and I find myself craving their food! Seriously love this place, and am about to place an order right now.", "author": "Rory F."}

Did you know that Tara Indian makes their tikka sauce by using only tomatoes without skin, and hand removing the seeds? The result is the most buttery sauce I've ever had. Naan is long, thin, not fat bread like they want to fill you up. Kashmiri Chicken is the most popular chicken, and I easily saw why. Get a masala chai tea. I ate so much, never felt bloated, and will be going back soon. One of the best kept secrets of the neighborhood.", "author": "Sam G."}

Under brand new management, the space is still a bit rough around the edges but the food is FANTASTIC!  The servers and management are warm, considerate and very friendly with our kids.  We ordered the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala and saag paneer--all cooked and seasoned to perfection!  The naan was piping hot, soft and melted in our mouths.

We ordered veggie momos and they were the best we've ever had!! Chock full of veggies, cooked perfectly along with a delicious sauce. And yummiest mushroom mutter, rice, chilli naan, chai tea..
