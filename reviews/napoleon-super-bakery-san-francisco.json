Up until 1.5 months ago, I worked right next to SF Chinatown, and I really never took advantage of the short distance here to get all my favorite comfort foods when things at the office weren't going so well. Now that I'm far away, it's hard to know the next time I'll make it back.\n\nMy mom happened to be SF last week and picked up some barbecue pork buns (cha siu bao) from here. The bread was appropriately soft, but lacked that sweet edge that really makes Chinese pastries. Good toasty brown color on the outside. The pork itself was in decent portion, had some chewy bits in it that make pork buns so yummy. Overall a solid 3.5/5 for me.", "author": "Nicole H."}

If you're new to the Chinese bakery game, get the pineapple bun(bo lo bao) or the BBQ bun(cha sew bao). The pineapple bun is the perfect fluffiness with the right amount of flaky top crust without falling apart. The BBQ buns are soft but not full of air. The pork is cool perfectly with right amount of sauce, and not full of just pork fat. \n\nIf you don't speak Chinese, it might be harder to get the attention of the ladies getting your buns. So make your way to the front so they get your attention because it's not self serve style. Be prepared to get pushed around by grouchy older folks who just want to get their buns. \n\nI got four BBQ buns for 3.60, they're 0.99 each but if you buy them in sets of 3, 6, 9, etc you get a deal on them. Each bun has its own deal, so make sure you ask them how they're sold. I also wanted to get the pineapple buns, but they ran out and it was only 2 o'clock. They usually don't run out until near closing time when they stop baking in the back. TIP: If you come right around closing, you can a discount because they're trying to push out all the buns. \n\nTLDR; All your authentic Chinese bun cravings can be satisfied here.", "author": "Sophia L."}

Had to wait 30 mins to get our dozen egg tarts. They are definitely larger than the typical ones, but they have a lot of custard in them. Custard is nice and soft while the crust is flaky and crispy. It is a little oily though, probably from all the butter in it, but they're delicious both right out of the oven or even overnight! At 80 cents a pop, the price really can't be beat. \n\nWe also got some pork sung onion buns which were delicious. The bread is super soft (even the next day!!) which was quite surprising for me because most of the time bread hardens a bit. Not theirs! It's still super soft and doughy. I wish I got to try their durian buns, but I didn't see them until after it was too late..boo :(. The prices here are pretty cheap too. Staff is nice. Cash only.

Because I wanted to keep my promise to my resigning colleague and the rest of others to buy Chinese pastries to bring back to my work place on time as a way to say \" Good bye \" and wished her the best, I decided to stay to make an order of three boxes, ten each separately.\n\nVery disappointedly, the receiving order services I was provided from two female employees , one in her early 40s' in black clothes, and the other one in her late 50s' who are both Taishanese speaking, a Chinese dialect, were really bad. Their customer service attitudes to me was totally unacceptable due to their arrogance. I felt like that they did not want my business. \n\nOut of disappointment, dissatisfaction, and unhappiness, before I left the store, I said to the younger employee who is possibly the owner, \" I have never seen a Taishanese person whom I know from my work location as mean as you to a customer\". In her arrogant response to me, she said, \" Get out here \" although I was her customer and spent twenty dollars at her bakery store. She treated me as such.

Get the durian bun! I was most excited for this at Napoleon's since it's rather rare to find. If you've never tasted or heard of this infamous fruit, don't miss out on trying it at Napoleon's. My boyfriend loves durian, so he'll describe it as tasty and sweet. I, on the other hand, consider it akin to onions in smell and taste. Be sure to ask for the durian bun to be packaged separately from any other items you order to avoid contaminating other foods with durian's pungent smell and taste.\n\nThe pineapple buns here are average. The bun itself is big and fluffy, but the sweet crust topping was lacking. This layer was thinner than that of pineapple buns elsewhere, so it was minimally sweet.\n\nEgg tarts here are also average. The filling of egg tarts are usually lightly sweetened, and this one from Napoleon was especially light. Some might find it almost too bland for their tastes, but the custard's consistency was right and the crust was flaky.\n\nThe interior is a narrow space with just three small tables and chairs.

The king resides on Grant Avenue at Golden Gate Bakery.  The only true way to settle the duel is a side by side taste test... minor problem:  GG is closed half of the year, or so it seems. \nRumor, a friend's cousin, reliability unconfirmed, recently heard that GG's baker now runs Napoleon's kitchen.  This piqued my curiosity so, on a recent Sunday, I picked up a six pack of custard tarts for the family.  When I got home, I immediately noticed a huge difference as they were cold.  Not refrigerator cold, mind you, but it certainly was not warm and toasty like GG's.  Here alone, the sense of smell being neutralized when cold, Napoleon is a notch below.\nMy friend said the trick is to pop them in the toaster oven and warm them to a flaky crispy texture.

Three tier cake, three layers, with delivery for UNDER $280. Serves 130 people. Oh yea. And if you return the cake holder, you can get $35 back. \n\nOrdering was easy. Just walk in, show them photos of what you want. How many levels.  What date, where to deliver and the flavors you want.  Paid upfront. \n\nDid I mention the cake was DELICIOUS?! I had guests come up to say it was the best wedding cake they've ever had. Who doesn't like mango cake? You don't? Okay, how about strawberry? No? There's also chocolate. \n\nYes, the cake isn't made by super fancy artists, but it worked. We cared more about the taste and the $ more than if it looked like it was straight from Martha Stewart or something. Honestly, I don't believe it's worth paying more than $300 for a wedding cake. Looking at other bakeries, they started at $500. Yes, we could always have gone with the cupcake route, but we wanted cake, and a cake from an Asian bakery since they're usually lighter, fluffier and just better than others. \n\nOnly thing is, it is best if you can speak Cantonese fluently. If you can't, bring a translator.", "author": "Lauren Y."}

I would strongly recommend the egg tarts instead--not only can you obtain delicious egg tarts without having to put up with the craziness at Golden Gate Bakery; if you come on a busy weekend morning you may be able to catch one straight out of the oven.  The layered, flaky pastry shell and soft custard filling is definitely worth the adventure of a walk through Chinatown, which is perhaps in itself a factor contributing to the authenticity experience.", "author": "Edna C."}

I'll admit that most folks, including myself, have a major preference toward Golden Gate Bakery (also made famous by the 7x7 eats list), but having just tried one of these today I'll also admit that Napoleon's egg custards kinda blew me away. You can't necessarily tell by appearance, but these not-so-little suckers for 70 cents a piece were pretty fantastic. I don't have a side-by-side, but I can tell you that the crust at first taste seems better than GGB's. If you prefer an egg-ier custard, you'll probably like Napoleon's more, and if you like a more watered-down, lighter custard you'll say GGB's is better.\n\nThis place earns high marks for a very solid dan tat that (for the price point and no wait time) is tied in place with Golden Gate Bakery.

Nope! I was brought up by Mandarin (and Taiwanese)- speaking parents; Cantonese wasn't going to cut it. She only spoke to me in English because she wanted to know if I had coins on me so she wouldn't have to give me coins in change.

This is for all the people planning your WEDDING!\n\nBrides, hear me out!\n\nI've previously written a review for them, 5 stars, but that's for their regular buns and what not. This one is for my wedding cake that they really DISAPPOINTED ME IN. \n\nSo you can see that my cake is beautifully made via the pictures I made and that I'm not making all this up, to own this review I even have a picture of me with the cake.\n\nWhen I placed this order I specifically said that I wanted their regular fruit cake, the one that tastes like a plain/vanilla sponge cake with fresh fruit fillings. I made it very clear. 5 tiers, square cake, every single layer the exact same taste. They assured me it would, they even told me their owner would be making the cake for me, and blah blah blah. \n\n*******The day of the wedding came around, the cake looked beautiful. Then I realized when it was served, about 6 of my tables hadn't finished their cake, or took a bite and left it there. Then one of my guests came up to me and told me that their cake went bad, tasted funny, and then a  couple of more people did. Turns out my 3rd and 4th tier had a lot of coconut extract in the cake, not the regular vanilla. When I went back to the bakery to talk to them about to get some money back they told me, \"Oh, we added it because our OTHER GUESTS said it tasted good...\" And I was like well I'm not that guest, I didn't like it, MY GUESTS thought that the cake had went bad. They sent me away without any of my money back. So you can understand my frustration right? \n\nOn another note, it didn't bother me at first but since I'm already dissatisfied with what happen I'll also complain about another thing about my cake they decided to do. \n\nI handed them a picture, a very large, clear picture of what design I wanted on the tiers. It was 2 alternating patterns. They once again said they understood and will definitely do it for me, even wrote it down. Not only was it NOT the DESIGN I wanted, they also made it the same on every singly layer. So yeah...\n\n******Bottom line? They're good.. but I suggest you making them write it down on paper that if they mess up, that they need to compensate you correctly. Would I recommend them?

Do not get the large cakes unless you are secure with what you buy. I like all the bread that they make here it is affordable and can last until you finish everything in the box. Most bread and small item are under $1.75 which is good because for a person who rarely takes breaks in or visits Chinatown this is the place to go. It is easy to remember where it is and it isn't far if you take the notorious #30 or just about any MUNI bus. It would be great if it was in San Jose too but you can't beat quality. If you are getting a large cake for a special occasion go somewhere else because the cake has been in the selling glasses for IDK how many weeks but the important thing is you should really come here a few times.

I asked her why would two of the same items that cost 0.90 = $1.90. It should be $1.90. She claimed that she had given me back 20 cents and made me look like the biggest penny pincher in front of everyone and disregarded my request for correct change. I used to come here as a kid and loved it here and now, not so much. \n\nFirstly, I work in the food service industry so I'm familiar with penny pinchers. Secondly, it's the principle (hope I used the right principle) that she should take responsibility to correct her mistakes. I wouldn't have even cared so much about this incident if it was for me telling my uncle what had happened and he said the same thing happened to him years ago. He handed a lady behind the counter a $10 bill and had given him change as if he had paid with a $5 bill.

In order to yank me out of bed on a Saturday morning to attend Chinese school, I require a warm hot dog bun. Over the years, as my taste buds develop, I learned to appreciate other types of bake goods. For example, egg tarts, durian buns, and green tea buns. \n\nNapoleon makes the best egg tarts in the city. Here, the egg tarts have a flaky crust that houses a creamy and smooth egg filling. For credibility reasons, I am egg tart enthusiastic, in which I have had egg tarts throughout the city, from Golden Gate Bakery to Sunset Bakery. \n\nAdditionally, Napoleon has an unique bun selection, from the traditional buns to their own inventions. Napoleon is the only bakery in the city that bakes durian buns and green tea buns. When these buns are piping hot, their aroma can fill a room with buttery delight. The buns are gigantic, fluffy, and soft. The fillings are slightly sweet and a creamy delight. These buns are even delicious when reheated in the microwave. \n\nIn conclusion, Napoleon is probably the second most popular bakery in Chinatown. Although there is a line to fight for your goodies, the line is a mere short 5 minute wait. Most patrons have done their research and know what to order. I always leave Napoleon happy and satisfied; it is definitely worth the fight.", "author": "Mabel Y."}

In fact, because of this I have found that the workers here are extremely patient.\n\nWe picked up my dad's birthday cake here recently, a sponge cake layered in real whipped cream with fresh strawberries, mandarin orange pieces, sweet honeydew and ripe cantaloupe.  It was very good.  The cake was very spongy and the cream was not very sweet.\n\nI like the large squares of puff usually found on a covered tray on top of the pastry case.  These are deep fried puffs of dough held together by a sweet, sticky glaze then finished off with finely shaved coconut.  They're not quite as good as the puff sold at the Queen's Bakery in Chinatown Los Angeles, but for San Francisco these are mighty tasty.\n\nThe mango mousse cake and chocolate mousse cakes are good too but are not always available.  Sponge cake and a thin film of whipped cream hold up an enormous portion of lightly sweetened, smooth mousse that is finished with another layer of whipped cream.  The mango had a very light mango essence, but the chocolate one had mini chocolate chips throughout and of the two I thought it tasted better.  I have found other flavors of mousse cakes such as taro root and honeydew but have tried neither.  These are normally available as whole cakes, but occasionally you'll find them sold as slices.\n\nIf you don't mind shopping with the occasional rude, pushy person who will then stand there and give you the stare down when you push them back this is a nice Asian bakery to visit.

I would highly recommend careful carrying of this cake as durian is slippery and the two cake layers shifted like two plates under the earth.  The shifting eventually smashed up the cake but no matter - it tasted great!  I believe the shifting was my fault anyways.  I should've been more careful swinging that bag around while walking... \n\nThis is next door to a dim sum bakery that had a short line coming out of it.  The shu mai is great at this bakery and according to Yelpers the shrimp dumpling is good too.  So get your meaty dim sum at that bakery on your way to picking up a durian cake from Napoleon :)\n\nOh and Napoleon also makes Sachima (google it) - it's not very crispy but it has coconut on it if you like.\n\nCash only but there's a Wells Fargo ATM on the same block.", "author": "Alias A."}

They have two bakeries, one in SF Chinatown and Oakland Chinatown. Both bakeries rocks.\nOakland bakery is the biggest in square feet of the two. People who shops in chinatown, have a foul sweatty workout, in fighting the crowd in neighborring produce market. I have a wide body and i cover up the pastry counter. AS I wait, little ladies, who wants service, wave their large dollar bills at the ladies behind the counter to serve them. I've waited ten minute just to order an inexpensive pastry. This little lady just came in to the door,who demands immediate service in a rude way, complained to ladies behind the counter, that she waited an eternity to be waited on. I hate to wait in line for anything as I mentioned in the Chinatown Walgreens and Pancho Villa taqueria. But for cheap pastries is worth the wait, eventhough coming here and to be served is a nightmare.\nWhenever I get what I want, there pastries is out of this world. They have sweet and savory pastries. I also mentioned coffee in Chinatown is not worth getting sick over, the decanter filled with coffee has in the heater for 2-3 hours. When purchasing your pastry @ this location you must leave, they have 4 tables in that crampped bakery. You can't enjoy food in this small bakery. Most of the pastries are under $.70. If you are under budget, buying two savory pastries can fill you up.\nMy favorite sweet pastries are:\n1.Custard tart & Custard roll (Bau)\n2. Raisin Roll\n3. Napoleon cake\nmy favorite savory pastry are:\n1.Chicken and tomato \n2. breaded fish covered parmesan coatted bread\n3. Old-fashion Ham & egg\n*With the tough Chinatown crowd, i had all the pastry there. They are good and inexpensive", "author": "Matt G."}

The cake layers are light, perfectly sweetened, with a melt in your mouth texture.   They put too much canned fruit filling in the middle.  So when you cut the slices they do not hold their shape.  The slice becomes an unrecognizable pile of canned fruit, cake, & frosting.

Their glass storefront and orange awning blend into the background; however, to the trained eye, the dull, metallic racks holding fresh pastries and the crowds of loyal patrons are telltale signs of brilliance.\n\nEntering the fray, customers half your size will challenge you at the counter. Leave your fear at the door. Step up, make eye contact, and shout out your order with confidence. If they are about to place second-rate goods in your rose-colored box, be sure to voice your concern. You will be rewarded.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday afternoons, there frequently are fresh, piping hot egg tarts -- delicate, light egg custard in a flaky pie crust. For those looking for something sweet, the \"cocktail\" bun (gai mei bao) and the fresh cream pastry (lai you bao) are enjoyable pastries; yet they may not completely satisfy the sugar craving as Chinese pastries are less saccharine than their Western counterparts. This explains the frequent substitution of mango for chocolate. For savory pastries, the flaky, curry turnover (ga lei gok) and the barbecue pork bun (char siu bao) are excellent options. The savory pastries balance the saltiness of the fillings with the slight sweetness of the soft pastry, similar to a Russian piroshki.\n\nIn the case of a birthday party or other gathering, the chestnut cake is a good choice. The sweet, nutty flavor combines nicely with the light, airy cake, light cream frosting, and fresh fruit. Ordering ahead is advised.", "author": "Alex C."}

I've \"researched\" a lot regarding which place in SF has the better cakes:  Napolean / AA Bakery / ABC / Sheng Kee / Sogo but concluded that this is the best tasting bakery in town....especially with their Mango Mousse.  Their cakes are inexpensive.\n\nUnfortunately, I've also heard rumors that they were selling cakes with mold in the middle.  Sometimes, their cakes have egg shells in them!  So far, I haven't experience either of this...so that's why gave 3 stars.  I've also looked up their City Health inspection score:  42 out of 100.  Now I'm skeptical about returning to this place eventhough they're still the best tasting bakery.", "author": "Gary Y."}

They have THE best buns I've ever had-- ANYWHERE.  My favorites are the custard, the coconut and the bbq buns.  Getting in and out is an experience in itself---so many people trying to jockey their position and get noticed by the little ladies behind the counter. I always get more buns than I think I'm going to eat and ALWAYS wish I got a few more.  I usually grab my bag of buns and eat one (or two) standing on the sidewalk in front of the bakery.  It has occured to me that I probably appear in the background of some tourist's snapshot scarfing down a bun (or buns) with complete abandon. I guess I'm okay with that. I really have no shame when it comes to these buns. I'm tempted to quote Sir Mix-A-Lot here but I won't.", "author": "Linda S."}

My mother always buys me the breads here and occasionally on my birthday, we purchase the cakes. Business is bustling in here so you better act fast when one of the ladies asks you what you want. Many of the customers are very ... feisty, so you better move fast. The breads are very tasty and inexpensive and are usually less than a dollar. The cakes are the best! They usually range from $13-20 something depending on how big you want it. It's a very great store if you want something inexpensive and for on-the-go as well.", "author": "Jenny L."}

My old favorites are corn with ham, bread loaves, red bean bun, and shredded pork bun. The presentation of the cakes doesn't look as nice as ABC's (across the street). I don't buy cakes from here - but the variety of the buns is amazing. The prices have gone up recently but it's still a steal. It's chaos during the busy peak hours (weekends, breakfast, and lunch hour) and you have to be aggressive to put your order in. There is no orderly line, lots of folk just cut in front of you without any qualms. Be aggressive! Otherwise you'll be standing there for a long time.", "author": "Candace F."}

Instead, the buns are filled with whole red beans that are probably as good for you as they are tasty. I also tried the cheese and fish bun. It isn't disgusting like it might sound, and I like that it's made of fresh fish rather than fish paste. Unfortunately, it was soggy in some places, so I won't be getting that again. Five stars, nonetheless, because Napoleon gets an extra star for being so cheap. Eventually, I'll get to trying the huge walnut cookies, the mango or chocolate cake, the egg tart, and the ham and tomato buns. Updates then!", "author": "Anita L."}
