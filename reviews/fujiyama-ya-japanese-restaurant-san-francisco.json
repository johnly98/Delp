Honestly, I wouldn't order anything from the menu other than the sushi combos, which are both extremely reasonably priced and also super fresh. If you ever dine in, you will see that most tables only order sushi, nigiri, sashimi, or hand rolls.\n\nThe first time I came with my dad, I overestimated my appetite and ordered a donburi and a sushi combo. Needless to say, my stomach was bursting from the food after finishing the combo and barely half of the donburi...The donburi was also not anything special. The next time I came, I simply ordered the special combo which is a decent assortment of sashimi and one order of tuna rolls. It was plenty of food for me...and all for only $10. Pretty amazing, considering that omakases in the city can run anywhere between $70-120 easily!! \n\nI know I will be back again and again!", "author": "Sherry L."}

I almost left at that point because I was starving but I asked the hostess and she said the wait would be less than 10 min and sure enough it was! \n\nThe ambiance is cute and cozy, the wall art felt unique and authentic (I normally don't even notice this kind of thing but these Japanese traditional murals were pretty awesome), and the prices were fantastic. We were served quickly and the sashimi was great quality and delicious. The rolls were also tasty though not as standout as the sashimi. Free miso soup and salad came with our meal. The overall bill was about half of what you'd pay in SOMA for this amount of sushi. Great experience and I feel as if I've found a new gem! Definitely plan to return!", "author": "J L."}

There is no notification via text or app so you will have to wait around the area. We ended up sharing our table with another party, which was awkward since we were on the inside of a bench with only one way to get out. \n\nAnyways, if you happen to dine here, I recommend sticking to the cooked options or at least dishes with some type of sauce since the sushi was pretty much bad in terms of the way the fish was sliced, taste of both fish + rice, and freshness of fish and probably the reasons why it was so cheap. Even the cooked dishes such as beef sukiyaki and beef amiyaki were just so so although better than sushi.", "author": "Sophie C."}

Very good! \n3)Dragon Roll: Yum! \n4)Spicy scallop Roll: Yummy! \n5)Sunset Roll: Roll includes salmon which is topped with Tuna and yellowtail. Wouldn't order this again.

My mistake, could not finish them both and had to take the roll back home.\n\nFirst, the salad and miso soup came out. Salad was good, but a bit too much dressing. Miso soup was okay, I think because I let it sit there too long and it cooled off. \n\nThe pink salmon roll came next. It was good, but nothing amazing. I was hoping this roll tasted like a Lion King roll that I like to get at other places. \n\nLastly, the katsudon came out in a flat bowl/plate thing, kind of hard to eat from, wished it was in a normal round bowl. But anyway, it wasn't bad. There was lots of egg and onions, with some mushrooms and fish cake. I thought the katsu was a little bit dry. I would've liked it more maybe if the egg was more runny and not fully cooked. Also, it'd be nice if the katsu wasn't completely covered so that there would be some crispy pieces.", "author": "Wesley S."}

This place is located along the lovely street of Noriega..right next to Home Cafe if you're looking for a coffee place nearby ;D The restaurant is small and cozy. It can get busy, so going off hours might be a good option if you don't want to wait. \n\nFujiyama has very affordable prices for a wide array of Japanese food ranging from sushi to donburi bowls, bento boxes, and other Japanese dishes. I ended up ordering nigiri with a California roll, and was pretty disappointed. The fish for the nigiri was cut very poorly and thinly. The rice was not made well either and seemed a bit stale. But I suppose since the price is so affordable, you get what you pay for. The California roll was okay, but again, the rice was made poorly. \n\nThe service was okay. I can see that when it gets busy, service might be a bit slower as there aren't many servers for the number of tables there are in the restaurant.

Our food showed up staggered, with the first and last dishes appearing 40 minutes apart from eachother. Since we were a party of 4, the timing was awkward and the waitstaff didn't acknowledge that service was slow at any point. Aside from the slow service, it wasn't an especially warm experience.

Second, the food was not impressive at all and even something as simple as teriyaki beef was a C- at best. The beef was dry and the teriyaki sauce had this weird gelatinous texture that was simply unappetizing and unpleasant to mix with the rice. \n\nThe soft shell crab appetizer we ordered for the table was so small that it could have been finished in 3 bites. The fish in the sashimi combo was fresh, but was sliced into such small pieces that even though it was a \"16\" piece sashimi combo, I got the equivalent of a 10 piece sashimi combo. \n\nI was really disappointed with my meal here, especially considering the fact that I love supporting local & family-owned restaurants here in the Sunset.", "author": "Winnie T."}

A definite order for steak lovers. Mom had the bento combo. It was fairly standard. The beef teriyaki was way overdone and very dry but luckily, the goyza and tempura vegetables were done nicely.

The interior is on the small side, about 10 tables, thus I sometimes get to-go instead. However, I found that their time for pick-up is usually longer than they tell you over the phone, so add another 10 minutes to the wait time they tell you. \n\nPrice is really affordable for sushi around this area, and the variety is ok. My favorite from this restaurant is the spicy tuna roll, which is quite spicy. Other than spicy tuna, I always get the California roll and rock'n' roll. There is an option to replace artificial crab with real crab in the California roll, but I could not really tell the difference, so I would not pay extra to get the replacement again. I have also tried the seafood udon here, the amount of seafood is standard, with shrimp, mussel, some fish cake, etc. however, the soup base is blend and just not enough flavor. I would say it is an average udon. \n\nOne time we came as a big party of around 10 people, with reservations made ahead, they were able to accommodate us at dinner time. They also give us complimentary miso soup too! Before this, they have always been rushed and now I appreciate their service. \n\nGiven the price, I would come back again if I am craving Japanese food, or simply call in ahead of time to get to-go.", "author": "Karen C."}

While my friends and I wait for about 30 mins or so, we were then seated inside of the restaurant. My impression of the menu was that the price ranged on the lower side of sushi restaurants. It is actually not bad, maki was about $4 for 6 rolls and nigiri was about $2 per piece and the special rolls are about $10-$12.\n\nThen the waitress asked us to move to another booth because they had forgotten that someone made reservations on the big table. And when we moved to the side booths, we waited for 10 mins to finally put our orders in. And then we waited for 15-20 mins to get our food. \n\nFood quality: okay, nothing really special. The nigiri probably tasted the best out of everything. The maki roll was okay, I liked the tuna maki rolls. I don't recommend the special rolls because the sauces and other stuff on the sushi takes away from the freshness of the fish. So if you are into real raw fish, do give the hand rolls, maki and Nigiri a try. \n\nOverall my experience with this place is good.

Upon opening the door, the entire entrance is packed with people waiting. You can't even get through. Upon getting through and to the cashier to pick up my order, no one acknowledges my existence. I tell the one and only waiter there that I am there to pick up. She tells me another person will help me out (a person who has had her back to me the entire time). I wait patiently and after messing around with to go orders, she finishes packaging a person's order. She gets his payment and passes him the bag of food to which he realizes there is no salad and has to remind her. It takes her another 5 minutes before asking me what me order was. Then once she takes my payment, she mentions we still have to wait for the tempura. Upon returning home and opening the food finally, the salmon teriyaki was BEYOND bad. It was over cooked like an extra 30 minutes and it had ZERO seasoning. Only watery teriyaki sauce. Not a piece of pepper or any seasoning on it. And it was the tiniest piece ever. The dynamite roll tasted only of the seasoning. The inside of it tasted like nothing. The chicken katsu sauce tasted like soy sauce only. The only good part was the tempura.

When I saw a Japanese restaurant with 4+ stars in my neighborhood, I nearly jumped for joy. SF isn't known for their Japanese food, and good Japanese is just a myth. I have yet to find it in this big city. The portions are hearty, it's so affordable! But you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, quality was pretty low and left a lot to be desired. While I think I will come here to satisfy my craving for Japanese food (because of proximity and affordability) this restaurant had no WOW factor. When we asked how long the wait was, the waitress just pointed to the sign in and didn't really help us further. The should have been a red flag. I will give this place one thing, their menu was extensive! However, that can also be their greatest weakness because quality fell through the cracks.", "author": "Kaitlyn F."}

It tastes like comfort food that you want to eat on a cold rainy day or when you're sad. For those of you who don't know what Katsu donburi is, it's breaded chicken with a house sauce and cooked with egg over rice and onions! Delicious! The chirashi dinner my boyfriend got never fails me. My boyfriend also split one Uni roll. Just adequate, wouldn't order again.\nMy donburi was $7.95 and boyfriend's chirashi dinner was $11.95.

It's cozy and has wooden decor with traditional paintings.  To complete the theme, I believe the waitresses even wear those traditional smocks with Japanese designs.  \n\nThe miso soup is standard, but the salad is one of the better ones I've had as a complimentary part of a meal.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy, and instead of that generic Japanese mayo they used a unique dressing that was honey-mustard like, but Asian.\n\nI got the saba teriyaki ($9), and at first I was disappointed because it looked small.  It was quite filling though, and of good quality though somewhat on the salty side.  My friend got the popular beef amaki, which she liked a lot.

However the restaurant and my saba seem legit enough that it's worth a try.  \n\nTip: It's a small place, so avoid peak hours if you don't want to wait.\n\nTip #2: The entrees come with soup, salad, and rice not just the meat.

I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now so I was looking forward to our dinner. But I felt I was a little disappointed tonight. \n\nI ordered the pink salmon roll and the spicy scallop roll. The pink salmon roll was a California roll topped with baked salmon and drizzled mayo. I thought this roll was pretty good. The salmon was well done and it gave the California roll a little something extra. The spicy scallop was what disappointed me. It was a roll with scallop inside topped with spicy seasoning. What really surprised me was the scallop. I don't eat raw fish. It's just not my thing. But I love sushi rolls so when I order rolls, I order ones that are fully cooked. I order scallop rolls often so I figured it was safe. When I bit into the roll, I noticed that it tasted a little slimy and when I looked at the scallop, it was raw. It's just my preference, but I didn't like what I had tonight.\n\nI did like that they gave us complimentary miso soup and a container of rice, similar to those at Chinese restaurants. We get to divide rice among us however we like. The prices for the rolls and for entrees are also pretty cheap. \n\nI was not impressed with the service. I felt that the lady who served us was just unhappy the entire time. She looked like she wanted to be anywhere else but there. And when she brought our orders out, she didn't know what it was that we ordered. She was like, \"It's either a Fujiyama Roll or a Crunchy Roll.\"\n\nSince no one at our table ordered the Crunchy Roll, it had to be the Fujiyama Roll. \n\nMaybe it was an off day for them. Or maybe it's just my preferences. But I feel like I could get better sushi elsewhere. I might or might not return.

There wasn't a time, where the waitress would ask us, if the food is good or even check on us, the only time I would see her near our table is to bring us food and take the plates away from us, but that's it! \n\nOverall, like I mentioned earlier, the food was yummy (my dad was satisfied) -- I would come back here, to try their sushi because for the price, it is very reasonable!

Super cheap for Japanese food but don't expect top-notch quality. \n\nThere seems to be a debate of whether Fujiyama is Japanese or Korean owned. Here's the answer to your question: http://www.manta.com/g/mm8gdqd/seikko-matzuyama If you can't differentiate \"Kim\" from \"Yamaguchi\"....Houston we have a problem.\n\nService is friendly BUT slow so the complimentary miso soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jXML1vz29FYYUeoPJIs6A?select=Eu8nqhu5lCJIvNXLW-3o8Q) and salad with the sinfully good creamy miso-like dressing (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jXML1vz29FYYUeoPJIs6A?select=6FKaBJ1AQ6T_BlxIb2fJ8w) really holds you down until you get your food. \n\nMy friend who's a regular recommended that we start with the Soft-Shell Crab ($5.95) with a panko-crust giving it more of a crunch with a nice granular texture (compared to tempura batter). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jXML1vz29FYYUeoPJIs6A?selected=iFXjjTF_YBdktWmnNo2qKw The accompanying vinegar sauce reminded me of the Filipino sinimak (spiced vinegar) which helped cut through some of the richness. He also recommended the highly touted Beef Amiyaki ($11.95) which is like a thicker version of the Korean Kalbi; nicely charred and succulently tender with a mouth-watering savory sweet marinade. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jXML1vz29FYYUeoPJIs6A?select=oT8xt_TzzTsl-lYrLaT_MA\n\nEverything was all good in the hood until I got my Sashimi Combo (16 pieces - $13.95). Except for the sake (salmon), the kampachi (amberjack), hamachi (yellow tail) and maguro (tuna) was fishy, borderline rancid with a mushy and stringy texture. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jXML1vz29FYYUeoPJIs6A?select=n7jVoBhbxXzz-DQIE42USw For the price, I can't really complain much especially if it didn't send me running to the porcelain throne. \n\nNOM on the Beef Amiyaki.\n\nNOM on anything fried. \n\nNO NOM on anything raw. \n\nOTHER NOTES:\n*5 minute wait = 20 minute wait\n*5 tables and 4 booths\n*Nothing is over $15", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Luckily, the Sunset 76 is conveniently located next to Fujiyama-Ya, so when I discover I have an hour until my car-bits are fully shined, I head directly over to fulfill my sushi-reward. \n\nI walk into the restaurant, all adult-like, and proceed to get a table, \"For one, please,\" with pride. I confidently ordered a sashimi combo complete with sake sashimi, salad, miso and beer, and I continue to eat and reward the all-growed up lady who is getting her car finally attended to. The sashimi wasn't the best I've had, but it was tasty and appetizingly presented. The salad and miso were perfectly yummy and satisfying. While I chomped the whole pile, the ginger was the pink kind (I prefer the yellow kind. I should probably discover what the difference is). I ordered a beer as well, which came with an adorably small glass -- like the kind I would drink cranberry juice out of at grandma's house -- which was strangely satisfying. \n\nSpeaking of adorable, the service was in the same category. The waitress (maybe the owner), was perfectly attentive and sort of understood that I was having a triumphant personal reward-meal. She even hopped to it when Sunset 76 called 25 minutes early to tell me that my car was already done. I got the check and retrieved ye olde vehicle on time.  \n\nThanks for lovely meal!

Below reviews can attest to how sweet Ester really is :) \n\nUpon arriving, I usually call in ahead to make a reservation since parties are seated based on the time they arrive. Party size is usually irrelevant so even if a table for six becomes available, they will sit a party of two. Expect to wait anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour, so get there early! There's a bar next door so I usually will sip on a few drinks while I wait for my table to open. For appetizers, I usually stick with getting a few orders of the spicy scallop roll and California roll. Spicy scallop is a pretty basic roll with raw scallops topped with a spicy sauce. Simple but still very good. I highly recommend it! Even my friend who doesn't like raw seafood loved it. Beware though, the sauce can be kinda spicy after you've consumed a couple pieces. I usually just power through though cause it's sooooo good! For my entree, Combo K ($12.95) is a no brainer. It comes with a huge serving of unagi (served on a sizzling plate) and sashimi. You can choose between salmon, tuna and hamachi. Can't go wrong with the salmon or hamachi. Granted it's not the best quality, it's still tasty and gets the job done. All combos also come with free miso soup, rice and salad. I absolutely love the salad - I mean, I know it's a very basic American salad but the dressing is super creamy. Yum!\n\nOnly downside is that service can be a little slow, but only because the restaurant is always packed.

The presentation was not great. The sushi tasted alright. It did fall apart fairly quick. \n\nI also had the Salmon Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll -- just know sushi is only ok. Do not expect anything spectacular. The rice is nicely vinegar-ed. And that it does fall apart fairly quickly. Many of the rolls is a \"California\" roll inside.

The meat was tastey, tender, and flavorful in 75% of the area. It also contained a lot of fat chunks which weren't hard to slice off. I also got rice, salad, and miso soup.

Also while I can eat here cheap, I can also get one of the cool fancier rolls (like the Lion King Roll or Cherry Blossom role) for around 10 bucks.

Not too bad.\n\np.s. they give a free small ice cream at the end most times (Green Tea or Black Sesame) that's pretty bomb.", "author": "Josh H."}

Glad we have reservations made in advance, the food came quickly but the same time they expect you to eat fast and leave fast!  Without asking for the bill, they automatically give us the bill! I am not very happy with that esp this is a group of friends I haven't seen for awhile.  Over all else, the food is delicious which I agreed.  The price is cheap (comparing to most Japanese restaurants).  We ordered all the fish dish, and sushi (cooked & raw).  Bottom Line - if you are with one or two friends, come to this restaurant is ok but with a group of friends, better try somewhere else!  We continue our gathering across the street the Chinese dessert place which was a lot of people too, but they don't tell us to go like this restaurant.

I'm a bit bias though because I am always craving this place... so much so my friends already know what I will choose we can't decide what to eat. You definitely get what you pay for and then some...! Quality wise, it's better than most $$$ priced Japanese restaurants.\n\nI can go on for days. Honestly, their cooking is very simple, but it just gives you that satisfaction and a happy tummy...so don't go in with too much expectations. Some people would beg to differ, but i don't care! \n\nKatsu donburi. Feel like something sweet, but savory? This is the perfect dish. It's VERY simple, don't get me wrong just tonkatsu with some grilled onions, eggs, mushrooms over rice, and a light sauce over to top it off. It's yummy and was the first thing I ever ordered here! It's less than 10 bucks, too!\n\nCombo K: Sashimi and Unagi Teriyaki set. If you don't ask, the sashimi they'll give you is Tuna, but upon request you can get salmon... or I think Hamachi is even a choice! I'm a salmon sashimi lovaaaaaa so, I only get that and it's comparable to the fresh catches my uncle gets. \n\nI enjoy this place, too because if you just can't decide for the day, they now allow you to make a combo of two items yourself.... happy choosing! I usually end up getting chicken karage with salmon sashimi =D. Their Chicken Karage is (insert thumb emoticon here... then a VERY excited and happy face!) Fries to perfection and it's not just bites of batter... like many other restaurants would do. There are chunks of chicken with each bite... ANDD it's dark meat, too!!!!!!! \n\nThey are known for their amiyakis. Both chicken and beef teriyaki are tasty and you can never go wrong. \n\nSushi's solid, no particular favorite roll so meh! But their nigiri's are for a good price and they always look good when I see it! \n\nSalad and Miso Soup might be another favorite about this place, too... haha I can just eat that and be content. \n\nFYI there's usually a small wait on the weekends, and be ready to come out of the restaurant smelling like the restaurant (that bbq-like smell) so, if you don't prefer to sleep smelling like that, save your hygiene care for after! \n\nFujiyamayayayayayayayayayayaya is just the solid back up for dinner.", "author": "Johanna T."}

I picked her up at her place on Lexington and after some thought and discussion, ended up here.  Fujiyama-Ya is a favorite local spot that SF heads to whenever she can.  \n\nIt's a traditional japanese affair, a quaint hole in the wall spot, snuggly situated between a noodle shop and bar.  We arrived @ 4:45pm and sure enough, no change to feed the meter.  We walked across the street to Fujiyama-Ya but they didn't open til 5pm.  As we chatted, a guy pulled up and was going into the noodle house.  I asked if he had change for a dollar.  He said no but proceeded to pull 50 cents out of his pocket to give to me... (sigh)  I miss the Bay Area. 8)  Awesome!  I thanked him, only took one quarter  since the restaurant was going to open soon and I could get more change then.  Big mahalo to the local braddah for the aloha! (Pay it forward, always)\n\nAs soon as the sign in the window lit up, we went in.  We were the first ones there.  After we were seated, I walked over to the register and asked for change for the meter.  The waitress Seiko, opened the register but there was none.  She grabbed a \"meter card' walked with me across the street, put 45 min. on the parking meter.  Did I mention that I miss the Bay Area?  I love San Francisco, thank you Seiko!  Mahalo! (Customer service rating just shot through the roof!)\n\nSF and I ordered the following:\nSushi Combo Plate - (squid; unagi; ebi; tuna)\nUnagi-maki\nFujiyama-Ya Roll (house spider-roll)\nSaba (nigiri)\nUni (nigiri)\nTuna (nigiri)\nSalmon (nigiri)\nSparkling Sake\n\nSee uploaded photo - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jXML1vz29FYYUeoPJIs6A?select=xklTT99D64YdmcHvvTRTSQ\n\nThe pricing was fair and the sushi good, a bit more rice than I usually see on maki sushi.  The rice was a little bit on the sticky side, the nori(seaweed), seemed a bit tattered too.  The sushi looked okay, not the freshest looking pieces I've ever seen but tasted fine nonetheless.  Another thing that I found interesting was that the nigiri sushi was sold in one piece servings.  I prefer the two piece nigiri option so you can share it if you want.   \n\nOne of my tell-tale tests for places is the freshness of the uni(sea urchin; Hawaiian - wana; pronounced VAH-nah)  Which I only order selectively on sushi visits.  After taking note of the freshness, the rice, and seaweed, I looked at the uni hesitatingly...  It was good.  Uni is one of those sushi items that you do not want to eat even if it's slightly old...  I almost completely abandoned uni after my first time, not too fresh.\nNote: Uni is for the avid sushi goer, not for the faint of palate especially if you're particular about texture.\n\nWe ordered the Ozeki Sparkling Sake, pink bottle, hana-awaka, very nice.  I never had sparkling sake, very tasy and refreshing.  I thought it was a bit pricey($10 for a small bottle).  I went to an Asian market today, saw the same bottle for $6. (So, maybe not too pricey after all...) \nSee uploaded photo - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4jXML1vz29FYYUeoPJIs6A?select=tARda4zT9I6ckur7158fJQ\n\nAfter the amazing parking meter freebie with the help of Seiko, the waitress could've spilt boiling hot tea in my lap...  'But was very thankful she didn't.  The service was awesome!\n\nAround 6:45pm, the little restaurant was packed.  SF and I sat for a bit finishing our sake, talking but didn't stay too much longer since the steady flow of customers wasn't slowing down. (Definitely, a good thing to see)\n\nIf I make it back to Fujiyama-Ya, I will have to try their signature dish, beef amiyaki and their homemade green tea ice cream.\n\n- Aloha\n\nFood: 3\nAmbiance: 4\nService: 5+\nValue: 4", "author": "Darrell P."}

Solid fish and so reasonably priced.\n\nWe were so surprised at this joint and thank fellow yelp reviewers to leading us here.

The sashimi was quite yummy- the salmon especially was buttery, melt-in-your-mouth, and with a ton of flavor.  The maki rolls we ordered were all less than $4 and well sized (not the tiny ones you'd might expect when you order a cucumber-only roll, for example).\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised that we got miso soup and a basic salad to begin with. We also ordered the basic cucumber salad with sesame and sweet vinegar that was fantastic at less than $3. Even the beers were great at only $3 for whatever you like. The green tea ice cream was $1.20! I don't even think you can get ice cream at an ice cream shop for that \n\nOverall, we loved this place.

She was really hungry for tempura & salmon teriyaki. We both enjoyed our deluxe combo meals. Excellent food. Well, again tonight we dined there & the food was excellent again. Except this time, the owner/boss of the restaurant practically threw us out of there. I was very disappointed in her abrupt, rude & rushed gestures of \"hurry up get out of here\" attitude \"so other customers are waiting outside - you paid the bill already.\" She walked to our table 3 times & the 1st time she says, \"ready to go?\" My mistake was to pay right away when the bill was presented. Not to be so negative since I think the staff who work for her are great servers & are very polite & plus the food was delicious. We barely finished our dinner in about a 1/2 hour & I barely finished my orange slices & drank my tea & water to digest my food. I really felt like I choked on my last bite because of the rudeness of the owner - I felt compelled to write this up. I feel very disrespected; however, I still love the food & I just hope we don't encounter the owner/boss again if I ever decide to dine there. My youngest son has always ordered take out from there. It's a small place, but as I reiterate, the food is good. Sushi & sashimi seem to be fresher than other similar restaurants here in SF. I would have rated it a 5-star, but because of the rudeness we experienced today, I gave it a 4-star. I understand people wait a long time to dine there especially during the peak hours, but there is no need to be rude. The owner did not even thank us for dining there; however, our waitresses did.

This place is definitely more of your neighborhood sushi restaurant when you're craving some \"Japanese food.\" \n\nIn terms of resevations/space, it's definitely a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait if you are larger than a party of 4-5, especially during meal times.\n\nLarge Portions! Definitely get your bang for your buck on these combos. A quick tip is that their teriyaki sauce is actually pretty thick (they add a lot of cornstarch to it). I've heard this is the Korean way of making teriyaki sauce - which makes sense since the owner of the store is Korean. Another tip is to try to avoid the Unagi - it's definitely not the store's best thing.\n\nThe best thing on the menu is pretty their Chicken or Beef Amiyaki. Think of it as a mixture between Korean and Japanese cuisine - it's marinated meat on a sizzling platter. What could get better?

GOOD.\n\nIt's so good that whenever my boyfriend visits the city, our dinner choices are either Fujiyama-ya or somewhere else. 90% of the time Fujiyama-ya wins. We decide on our dinner plans for Fujiyama-ya before we decide on what to do during the day until 5pm, which is when the restaurant opens.\n\nMy go-to is the sashimi dinner (8 pieces of 2 types of fish). The sashimi is fresh, and the slices are extremely thick. I usually order sake (salmon) and maguro (red tuna), but sometimes I go for hamachi (yellowtail). Ask for ponzu sauce for dipping instead of soy sauce, and you'll be in sashimi heaven.\n\nMy boyfriend's go-to is the beef amiyaki. It comes out sizzling and the smell will make your mouth WATER. Each time we come here the pieces of meat are huge, and the whole piece is cooked to perfection.\n\nIn addition, we usually order a roll. We are creatures of habit, so we routinely order the Dynamite Roll, which never ceases to satisfy our tastebuds. The roll is pretty big, comes with six pieces. I like how the rice-to-inside ratio is perfect, just the perfect amount of rice, and a LOT of fish inside.\n\nTotal for a sashimi dinner + beef amiyaki + roll = about $30, and includes copious amounts of satisfaction and a nearly overstuffed but content tummy.\n\nThis place is definitely a local go-to, and the prices are super reasonable. The food is delicious and authentic, and the staff is super friendly. I'll probably be here next weekend.", "author": "Caitlin C."}

We arrived about 10min late & there were 4 other people already waiting to be seated. It's a small little place..definitely busy though. We were luckily seated next...BUT had to share a table with another pair of people. It wasn't too bad though since there was an empty seat in between.\n\nOkay, what to order? \n\nGyoza - Tasty potstickers. Nothing wow about them, but they were good.\n\nBeef Teriyaki Donburi - Yum! I asked for it to be medium-well.\n\nPink Salmon Roll - Spicy, but delish! Baked salmon = yummm :) \n\nCrunchy Roll - Very good as well :) \n\nWe both got a miso soup & shared the salad. \n\nIt was about $32 & something cents all together.

Everything else is just okay. \n\nMy sister and I ordered sashimi here one time and it was not that great. We told ourselves that if we came back, we would not order any raw fish, just cooked food. But with our love for sashimi, we came back for the beef ameyaki and ordered a negihama (hamachi and green onion). We thought with such a small amount of raw fish, you can't go wrong but we were wrong. My sister's first bite into the maki roll had a good size bone in it and that grossed us out for the rest of the roll. \n\nI had ordered an udon here one time and it was not like any other I'd had (not in a good way). It was soooooo soft/cooked that the udon was splitting apart. Picture a hair with a split end and that's what the strands of udon I was eating looked like. I'm not even sure if it's because the udon was too cooked or too old! \n\nSo overall, I would give 4 stars for service, 4 stars for beef ameyaki and 3 stars to the rest of the food - udon, sashimi, tempura, bento, rolls, etc.", "author": "Carmen C."}

But, unfortunately, this restaurant has lackluster food, and lackluster service. The last few times I've been here, something strange with the service happened that spoiled the experience. This time, I brought my mother here because she wanted a local restaurant nearby where she lives. We are both Japanese. We ordered the Chicken Teriyaki plate for my mother, and the yakitori appetizers, gyoza appetizers, and 7 piece sashimi for me. The Chicken Plate and yakitori came out in a very timely manner. Both were just ordinary. However, after 30 minutes, the gyoza finally arrived. My mother was almost finished with her plate. After another 15 minutes, I had to flag down a waitress to ask about the sashimi plate. I waited another 15 minutes. My mother had finished eating and wanted me to ask for a box. So, after an hour, the sashimi plate finally arrived. The pieces were really small. Also, we were ready to leave. So I sent the sashimi plate back and refused to pay for it. I usually tip small neighborhood restaurants 25%. This time I tipped only 10%. I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone. They are simply overwhelmed. This restaurant might be okay to visit if: you are alone so no one else but you has to suffer, the weather is bad, you're too lazy to throw a Hungry Man TV dinner in the microwave, you start the meal with TWO bottles of beer to anesthetize you while you deal with the indifferent service, you're so tired you don't care what the food tastes like, and you're trying to save money by not tipping very much.

We got here at 6:30, had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. The place is extremely small, and watch the door. It automatically closes so stop trying to close it people. There's a giant sign that tells you that it will close automatically.  \n\nEither way, we were seated, it took another 15 minutes for someone to take our orders. I understand you're busy, but seriously, 15 minutes to take our orders is unacceptable especially if you see us trying to flag you down. Another 20 minutes for our water and miso soup to arrive, and another 15 mins for our salad to arrive, and another 30 minutes for our actual order to arrive. Seriously? No wonder there's a long wait, not only is the restaurant small, it takes forever for everything to come out. They're really understaffed here. This was the longest dinner we ever had, and it wasn't even pleasant. If it wasn't because we had waited for so long, I would have walked out. \n\nWhile waiting for our food, we heard an argument between a patron and one of the waitress. Apparently they were already waiting for over an hour and someone else got seated before them. I don't know if that's the norm here, but it did look like the regulars who knew the waitress got seated before others. I can't prove this of course, but the fact that our table was ignored while others were waited hand and foot made it difficult not to feel that way.\n\nSushi was nothing special. I guess after reading all the positive reviews, we were hoping for really really fresh fish. Not so much. Not to mention, they were flavorless. \n\nThis is not a keeper for us...

Down to the ground down.  That's what happened with Fujiyama-Ya and us tonight.  \n\nWe'd been hoping to replace an all-time favorite, Ray's Sushi in Hayward but, were sadly disappointed.  Way down.  *sigh*  We walked in with full spirits and loved the cute look of the lil Japanese restaurant.  The wait was a lil long to order but we didn't care too much.  The miso came out... it was above average.  This is where everything started going downhill.\n\nThough the prices were really reasonable, most of the food was a big disappointment.  My gyoza tasted ok but were mushy.  It's like they'd been over boiled/steamed and then lightly seared on the bottom.  Next, the Tuna Lover roll was very salty and had way too much mayo in the crab.  Not a good sign.  When my Dynamite roll came out, it was covered in a gross creamy sauce and the tuna inside was fishy tasting and drenched in a mayo sauce too.  It was mushy.  Gross Gross... I think the 2 of us only ate 3 pieces... which is saying a lot for a couple who rarely wastes food.  The Hamachi Nigiri was stringy and not so good.  The Tekka Don (maguro chirashi) had such a small amount of maguro, I thought they'd made some mistake.  It's taste was ok though.  Also, the udon had nicely chewy noodles but the tempura itself, was SO GREASY that when you pressed a chopstick into it, grease seeped out.  You could taste the oil in the batter.  Gross.\n\nI feel so let down.  I guess that's the danger of hoping for too much.  If you like cheap sushi and Japanese food that is drenched in mayo and grease, this is your joint.  lol.

After reading all the positive reviews on this place, I was pretty optimistic. Apparently Fujiyama-Ya prides itself on 2 things: quality of food and affordability. Unfortunately it only delivered on the latter. \n\nI've tried Fujiyama-Ya a couple times, giving them a couple times to get it right with the raw fish. The first time I came, I ordered the tonkatsu donburi with a side of hamachi sashimi. The tonkatsu was cut up into ridiculously tiny bits so you really didn't get much meat. And I feel like chopping the meat so small was really done to conceal the fact that it probably a lesser cut of pork. But I could be wrong. The hamachi was really fishy tasting and was kind of hacked up. The second time I came I ordered the sashimi dinner. Again, everything tasted really fishy. They give you a good amount of fish, but my tuna was mushy, salmon was tough and chewy, and the hamachi just plain tasted bad. Also, the cut job on the fish was horrendous. I made the mistake of posting a picture of my meal on instagram (who knows why I did it...the plate did not even look pretty...) and one of my friends asked me if I'd cut the fish myself. \n\nTo top it off, the service I received both times was not very good. There are a good amount of waitresses (3-4) and each time I've come they haven't been very busy. Which would usually mean that service would be great. But it wasn't. Food came out very slowly and the waitresses were very slow to take our order and deliver our check. On my first visit, one of the waitresses got my friend's order wrong. \n\nSo yes, this place is cheap. But I would rather pay a little more and get better service and better food.

One came with salmon and avocado and the other unagi and avocado with 6 rolls per order. Both are pretty standard as with any sushi restaurant. I was happy to bite into salmon that was fresh, chewy, and soft. Many places tend to use cheap salmon that leave streaks of salmon between your teeth (ew). The unagi had subtle, yet tasty flavor. I enjoyed popping the bite-sized pieces in my mouth as my friend and I caught up. \n\nIn addition, I ordered shiro maguro nigiri. The odd (but good) thing about this place is that they sell it by the piece, rather than two pieces. It was nice and soft but lacked flavor. I saved this for last so I was a little dissapointed. \n\nMy friend ordered chicken karaage that came with rice.

Yeah, that's it.\n\nAfter I ordered my dish, I heard other customers requesting all salmon for their sashimi.  I thought that odd and found out why when all our dishes arrived - all 3 of them tuna, tuna and tuna sashimi.  Dang Fujiyama-Ya, that's a little bit, I don't know?  What's the motivation behind that anyway?\n\nIf you do go here, just remember to ask for something other than tuna if you order a combo or bento with sashimi, like salmon maybe and another type of fish.", "author": "barry a."}

There are individual tables that can be pushed together for large groups, and there are booths as well.

The food is slightly cheaper than nearby Japanese restaurants, the service is excellent, and the food is delicious!\n\nMy only complaint was the wait for a Saturday night. I called in a reservation four hours in advance and when we got there sharp, restaurant was full waiting on patrons. One table took FOREVER to finish after they paid their bill.  I almost felt bad for the table of 8, they waited twice the time we did. It was a cold night and I was hungry.\n\nI. The food\nThe rolls were very good, and the plentiful for what was ordered. I spent only 16 dollars got 1 Maki Roll Plus the Deluxe sushi plate. I like California rolls like the next guy, but the other rolls on the deluxe plate were quite good.\n\nMy friend ordered their version of chirashi, and it was a huge box of fish and rice. It was plentiful, it was good.\n\nWhile we did not get it, the sizzling plates can be heard and smelled. It sounded and smelled very good. Perhaps I will get these next time. \n\nII. The price\nWe had a table of 4 and we all ordered at least two things per person, and the bill ended up being $64 or so. I found it reasonable for a Japanese restaurant where I ordered I bunch of rolls of good quality.\n\nIII. Service\nAside from my original complaint in the first place. The service was top notch. They were extremely attentive when seated and very nice about assuring us that a table was ready, and asking whether we were full instead of rushing us out even though there were people outside still waiting.\n\nIV. Decor\nI know a lot of folks find that these places are hokey in their attempt to copy Edo-style restaurants, but I always love it when restaurants try to give you good decor with your dining experience. I certainly enjoyed it even though the tables were a bit sticky. The art work was definitely a talking point during the meal.", "author": "Michael C."}

Yelp, you have disappointed me. : ( I don't know if its because we came here on a Friday night around 8. It was sort of busy but its a small restaurant and they had 3 waitresses. The service was mediocre but maybe leaning towards the crappier side. Two of the older lady waitresses were pretty nice but the other younger one with glasses was pretty rude. We asked her like 4 times for our water and our diet pepsi. \n\nWe ordered the vegetable donburi, special bento box, spicy tuna roll, and chicken teriyaki and salmon teryiyaki entree. They all came with soup and salad. The waitresses served us one salad short and didn't give the third one til we were almost done with our food. We also had to ask for tea which usually comes in the beginning of the meal along with the water and drinks.\n\nMy cousin like the vegetable donburi but I don't think it looked or tasted that great. The special bento box was just meh. The tuna sashimi tasted so fishy and disgusting that I had to spit it out. It wasn't even fresh. The gyoza was ok along with the tempura. Tasted like any other kind that I've had. The only upside was the beef teriyaki. It tasted really tender and flavorful. I think that was the only appetizing part of the bento.\n\nThe spicy tuna roll was poorly made and the consistency was like real tuna. It was really weird. It didn't taste bad, just never tasted spicy tuna like that before. The chicken teriyaki and salmon were alright. The salmon actually served was a big piece and was pretty tender which is good.\n\nIn conclusion, the service was not that good along with the food.

The sashimi & nigiri sushi & rolls may not be as fancy as other higher end Sushi restaurants, but it's fresh and most affordable. The Beef Amiyaki rib eye steak is a winner, as is their Spider, Spicy Tuna and Dynamite Rolls!  And their Uni... very fresh! They have a good Lemon Chicken for those not into Japanese flavor. They also have beer, Sake and Plum wine for those wanting something stronger than Green Tea or soda. \n\nDid I mention Esther, the waitress? She's usually the person who greets  you when you arrive.

And I do mean took over.  I've only been here once or twice, but my siblings have recently become weekly patrons as a result of some very personal service to a 5 year old.\n\nFor a Sunday night, it was very busy...as in people waiting outside busy. So I was very sorry for everyone else because they had to wait a long time for their food and for any service.  Yes, there was only the one waitress the night we were there and she was running up and down like no tomorrow.  \n\nWe ordered a lot of sushi and a couple of entrees.  Since I never had their rolls before, I was pleasantly surprised.  They also sell their nigiri by the piece, but it's not too expensive.\n\n* Uni \"sea urchin\" ($1.80/pp)\n\n* Amaebi \"sweet raw prawn\" ($2.40/pp), including the fried shrimp head\n\n*  Spider Roll \"soft shell crab\" ($5.95/8 pieces) - It was okay, not my favorite.\n\n* Dynamite Roll \"tuna, hamachi, avocado with spicy sauce\" ($5.95/8 pieces) - I like how they do their spicy sauce, and the avocado with it is nice.  \n\n* Spicy Tuna Roll ($2.95/6 pieces) - I'm digging this...less than three bucks for a 6 piece spicy tuna roll?  I'm definitely coming back for this!\n\n* 49ers Roll \"scallop, tobiko inside and tuna, salmon on top\" ($8.95/8 pieces) - The tobiko was on the outside instead of inside, which was fine.  And I like the spicy sauce they use here and it tastes good with the scallop.\n\nMy nephew loves this place - they give him broccoli tempura because he only likes broccoli.  (Yeah, a five year old that just loves broccoli!)  He also loves it because they remember that he doesn't like green onions in his miso soup.  And they also make him a special ikura maki roll, which is pretty darn good and I wish it was on the menu.  (They forgot his salad this time though.)\n\nWith only one sushi order mix up, the rest of the food came out fine.  Sure, we had to wave her down for more tea, water, sushi plates, etc.  But sometimes you don't mind a little wait in mom and pop shops.  The overall product is worth the wait.  But I did feel sorry for all the other patrons who waited a long time to get their order in and for their food to come out.  Sorry!\n\nI love spicy rolls - spicy tuna rolls, spicy hamachi rolls, spicy scallop rolls. But I hate that sriracha stuff in my spicy sauce.  And I like it creamy, especially when it's made with Japanese mayo.  And this place does it the way I like.

I've ordered the california roll, rainbow roll, chicken and steak amiyaki, and the sashimi combo. The california roll was better than standard. The second time I got the rainbow roll the fish didn't look too fresh so I was disappointed, but the chicken and steak amiyaki was always made perfect with the right flavor and tenderness; even my 90 year old grandma had no problem eating it with the few teeth she had left! The sashimi combo was very fresh and didn't have the stringy stuff you find with below average sashimi. \n\nEach time I've eaten there I got miso soup, a salad which has this wonderfully sweet, but not too sweet dressing, and tea. I believe the soup and salad is only given depending on what you ordered... \n\nOverall the price is very affordable, but major cons are the parking and wait time. At night, parking is hard and at times vicious - you know how hungry people can get in the sunset :P The wait is the worst.

They have lovely chefs and waitresses but they're busy and the food is also brought out slowly so there's more waiting you have to do.

What?\n\nI guess I must get my inability to explore restaurants other than the regular ones from my parents because this place is actually pretty good! I frequent Eagles Drift In (I like empty dive bars) but have never thought to stop in to eat here. \n\nWhat brought me out of my bubble was a school friend who picked some sushi up from here. Putting that first piece in my mouth, I didn't expect much... but boy was I wrong. After coming out of my sushi bliss, I exclaimed, \"where the hell did you get this?!\"\n\nI had a chance to finally go in about a week or two ago and walked in a little late (near closing time). They still sat us down and we didn't feel rushed at all. I looked at the menu and saw the CHEAP prices for the sushi and nigiri. I usually order simple rolls (negihama, philadelphia, etc) because I really enjoy the basic flavors. These rolls were only $4-5 each (cheap, as compared to the usual $6 elsewhere). The specialty rolls were also cheap.\n\nI also ordered two pieces of saba nigiri - yuck. The mackerel was dry and skimpy, definitely not getting this again. \n\nAt the suggestion of Yelp, I also ordered the amiyaki. It was delicious - but it definitely had garlic in it (which I am allergic to and had to pay the price for later) but it's almost worth it to eat it again even though my body doesn't like it.\n\nAll in all, not the best place for sushi but with the great prices and quality given, i'll be coming back again.", "author": "Christina B."}

I agree with the Yelpers, this is a great find: good value & reasonably priced for authentic washoku. Homestyle, like okaasan used to make. :-) And they are open for dinner 7 days a week. :-)\n\nThe highlight of our meal was the Tiger Roll, made of softshell crab & avocado, topped with eel and tobiko. We also enjoyed the agedashi tofu.\n\nI had the Chirashi Combo, which was 4 varieties of sashimi on top of sushi rice with nori & tamago. My only disappointment was that I was expecting more of a variety of toppings (e.g. a piece of ebi, some ikura, ika, etc.etc.) since the Chirashi Combo is slightly more expensive than standard chirashi...not sure how the two types of Chirashi are different. (Perhaps this was more expensive b/c it included 20 pieces of nice sashimi.)\n\nMy friends enjoyed their Chicken Katsu meal. We were all very full afterwards.\n\nThe edamame was too salty for our taste (I am sodium sensitive), so next time I will request if they can avoid putting salt on. Low sodium shoyu is available on request.\n\nLooking forward to coming back soon and trying the other menu items. :-)", "author": "N. F."}

It's great that they allow you to make your own combo and include beef amiyaki as one of the items.  The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable.

Granted, it's not the best, but compared to other places, it's decent.\n\nMiso soup seems a bit watered down. The salad dressing on the salad is pretty good though. Beef amiyaki here is definitely really tasty. Not overcooked and very flavorful. I've tried the chicken teriyaki here before too and it's tasty, not burnt and not too much teriyaki sauce drenched over either. The tempura... the day that I got it wasn't that good though. Not sure if that's how it always is, or just an off day... but the batter wasn't really tasty and was kind of soggy. I like my tempura nice and crispy! Rolls here are pretty cheap too. Got the rock and roll, which was decent. Most favorite roll was the 49ers roll, wish they put more salmon on top but regardless, it was very flavorful. Dynamite roll tasted like an ordinary dynamite roll to me, didn't care too much for the sauce on top. My least favorite was the dragon roll which is usually my most favorite roll at other places. However, at Fujiyama, the dragon roll here is sweet... which really threw me off.\n\nOverall, the food here is pretty good and really cheap. Service... as others said... is a little bit off. Waits can be a while since it's a small place. Food can take forever to come. All your food for the table doesn't come together either since our table slowly got their food... which is weird cause everyone tells you to eat before your food gets cold, but if you eat without everyone else... seems kind of wrong... but at the same time my food is getting cold! So, they should work on a way to get the food out to the entire table instead of literally 1 person at a time at different tables.", "author": "Johnson S."}

Reasonable Japanese food, decent food and comfortable place to dine in. And judging from the recent reviews, it's very much like a family-friendly restaurant. \n\nI got myself the Chicken Kaarage entree and it is an interesting way of making it. Chicken Kaarage that I usually have are pieces of chicken deep-fried to a crispy nugget. The way Fujiyama does it was almost like having a light batter that resembles beer-battered fish. The portion size is pretty generous, but after going through half of the chicken, it became a little tiresome and salty. Maybe more rice would help. \n\nService is great and friendly, so no complains there. I can easily have a good meal and good conversation with the low noise levels and the prices are easy going on the wallet. I would come back to try other stuff, but the Chicken Kaarage is done a little strange for me.", "author": "Jeremy L."}

I ordered the chicken kara-age and the hubs ordered a beef donburi and we agreed to split a dynamite roll.\n\nPricing was great - our entrees were under $10 and came with miso soup and a salad, and the roll was also under $10, but looking at the whole menu, their standard rolls (like the Cali Roll) all loked like they were under $5 and more like $2 and $3!!!\n\nParking was not too bad since we came in at night and it's a commercial street so, except for the eateries, most of the daytime businesses were closed and left more room for eating patrons.\n\nMixed reviews on the food - The soup was actually also pretty good - not too salty and the salad dressing tasted like a sweet vidalia onion dressing.\n\nI'm not a big fan of sweets on my savory dishes and when the hubs' donburi showed up, I immediately thought they might have brought him a different dish because it looked like beef teriyaki. No egg, and a thick brown sauce. When he tried it, he also said it tasted like teriyaki. When we asked the server, she said that they don't serve donburi (with the egg) with beef - just chicken... it would have been nice to know that BEFORE bringing our food in instead of the bait and switch (there are actually 2 separate menu items for beef teriyaki and beef donburi).\n\nThe dynamite roll actualy tasted really good, but the texture was excessively mushy. It's a bunch of minced fish (tuna and salmon, I think) rolled up with avocado slices and sprinkled with spicy sprinkles. I really liked the way it tasted, but it might have been a bit more texture-friendly with some cucumber instead of avocado (just a thought). I'd still order this dish - probably just with some other roll with a bit of crunch to break up the mush.\n\nThe kara-age was awesome. Kinda hard to go wrong with chicken nuggets (it's basically what that is, right?), but their batter was especially light and perfectly crunchy. It's worth mentioning that the flavor isn't really much of anything without the dipping sauce (tasted like ponzu) and rice.\n\nService was pretty good. Very friendly and attentive. She noticed that the hubs did not scarf down his food and when he got up to use the restroom, she cleaned up our table and asked me if he didn't like his dish. I noted to her that he was expecting the donburi with egg and not covered in teriyaki sauce. She apologized for his disappointment and finished bussing our table. I guess this means we'll just not order that dish again.\n\nAll in all decent spot for neighborhood eating and average food - nothing to complain about other than maybe setting better expectations on parts of the menu.", "author": "Kariz M."}

Twenty years later, I still find myself frequenting this low key neighborhood sushi joint and recommending it to friends and family alike.\n\nThe place is fairly small, and when you first walk inside a wall of faded business cards greets you, followed by a sweet waitress named Esther. You hear classical music playing from a tape cassette in a boombox, see traditional brush paintings of Japanese warriors, and smell the savory aroma of green tea and lightly battered tempura. Instantly, you feel at peace.\n\nThe portions are huge and the prices are extremely reasonable. After 15 years, I still limit my orders to a few favorite menu items: the spider roll, alaska roll, salmon teriyaki, tempura, and beef amiyaki. I rarely eat red meat but their beef amiyaki is a hit in my book. It is a marinated USDA ribeye that comes to you in a sizzling platter, full of flavor and texture. I highly recommend enjoying this with their rice, which is premium quality Japanese rice, not plain ol' white rice. A bona fide sushi lover ought to be able to discern the two.\n\nIt really makes me happy that such a small establishment is able to remain in business for almost two decades as well as keep their prices affordable.

So I decided to come here and give this place a try. I noticed nothing on their menu was over $14. Wow! Hella cheap! But I had a feeling their cheap prices were too good to be true. \n\nNegi-hama is my favorite roll to order. Its hamachi kama with green onions. I like to order it everytime I go to a new Japanese restaurant. As I bit down on my negi-hama, I noticed something hard. I was like \"What IS that?\" Took it out my mouth and, lo and behold, its a fucking fishbone! WTF?! The workers did a HORRIBLE job de-boning that fish! They also did a half ass job cutting and presenting it!  Good thing I didn't swallow it! I would have choked on it ! And I'm glad I didn't chip a tooth or anything! It came with 6 pieces but I only ate 4. It wasn't that good anyway. The sushi rice wasn't even seasoned and the fish didn't taste that fresh.\n\nOkay, now that I'm done with my negi-hama...I'm glad I still have my spider roll. Its hard to fuck up a spider roll. I mean,  the soft shell crab is fried up! What can go wrong? Well guess what? I bit down on a fucking avocado stem! Can't believe I bit down on something hard TWICE! Took it out of my mouth...looked at it...Oh Hell NO! This aint part of the soft shell crab! Its part of an avocado! Still can't believe that would happen twice! Why me?! Whyyyyyy???\n\nSo I flagged down the workers. 2 of them came to my table. I showed and told them  \"I bit down on a fish bone. And I also bit down on this. It was in my spider roll. I think its part of an avocado stem or pit....\" One of the ladies just giggled and said \"I'm sorry.\" It was pretty busy that night and they both continued to go back to work. I guess they don't care about their customers? I was irritated. And yes, I stayed calm the whole time.  They're lucky I'm a nice person. If I wanted, I could have threatened to sue them or make a scene in front of all the customers. But I didn't. \n\nSo I stopped eating BOTH of my rolls after finding my two surprises. I also ordered some chicken wings which took a while to come out. I thought to myself  \"They better not fuck up my chicken wings! \" Good thing they didnt. And I have to admit it was pretty tasty.  I mean, it would be impossible to mess up fried chicken! And as for my cucumber salad, eh, it wasn't that great. \n\nOkay, so the worker noticed I was done eating. Before she gave me my check, I asked her \"Are you gonna charge me for these rolls?\" She tells me \"I have to ask.\" She comes back a few minutes later and says \"I can only take off one.\" I told her \"Okay, that's fine.\" So my check comes. I was expecting her to take off the spider roll (since it was more expensive)  but only took off the negi-hama. My $16 bill only went down to $13. WTH?! I was too tired from work to complain and just wanted to get the hell out of there. I didn't want to waste another minute my time or my server's time (since it was super busy) so I just paid my bill and left. I thanked her on my way out. \n\nIn conclusion, cheap food usually means poor quality. If I were you, I would just come here for their cooked food. Don't even bother with the raw fish.\n\nBtw, thanks for reading my  long ass review. You're awesome. =)", "author": "B B."}

First of all, its a smaller restaurant of about maybe 4 tables and 4 booths with only one waitress, Esther. Its a real quaint little hole in the wall type of restaurant without the dirtiness. \n\nThe sushi is fairly cheap as makis can go up to $4, specialty rolls $8-$12 and nigiri $1.40 for one piece. combination boxes, chirashi and hamachi don are usually priced around 9.99. \n\nMy favorite things to order are usually Beef amiyaki--comes out on a sizzling platter with a sweet teriyaki type sauce on a marinated, grilled piece of beef. YUUMMMY! Every time someone orders it, everyone watches it as it comes out because of the sweet sweet aroma and the sizzling crackles it makes. another one of my ultimate favs is the hamachi don--sushi rice in a ceramic bowl with about 12 slices of some of the freshest hamachi I have in the city. I'' usually orer a spicy tuna roll, rock n roll and some nigiri. My ULTIMATE fav however is the salad!!! I know, how great can a little side salad really be...? Well it's good enough that I order it EVERY time. Its usually served with allt he meals unless you solely order sushi. The dressing is similar to a sweet honey mustard type of base but a little japanese spin on it.

Their sushi is good and it's cheap.  I usually get my 3 favorite basic rolls here- the california roll ($2.85), the eel/avocado roll ($3.25) and the spicy tuna roll ($3.25).  Luckily for me, they make all 3 of these rolls very well.  Wow, did I mention that this place is cheap?  Where else can you get a spicy tuna roll for 3.25???  \n\nIt's not exactly world class sushi, but it's actually really good, and the price to quality ratio is terrific.  I really like the spicy tuna here. I've also tried the vegetable tempura and seaweed salad here and I have no complaints about either of those.  The one thing that I don't really like is their salmon rolls.  I don't like the taste of their salmon... for some reason, it tastes like smoked salmon to me, and I'm not a big fan of that.  I think I had their udon once a long time ago and I wasn't thrilled with that either, but it's been awhile so I don't remember it well.  \n\nBut if I want some good, cheap sushi, this is definitely the place to be.

I was not happy with the food.  The crunchy roll was decent, with crab, tempura shrimp and lots of tobiko topping.  The hamachi nigiri was decent as well as the uni nigiri, which I rarely order.  My tempura was disappointing.  The batter looked crispy but tasted as if it had been cooked in rancid oil, the shrimp was surrounded on the inside with a pasty-tasting batter and the shrimp didn't taste fresh.  The vegts were very good with asparagus, broccoli, yam, potato and carrot.  The rice was sticky but didn't have that fresh fragrant smell.  I really didn't like the tempura dipping sauce which was overly sweet and unsavory.  I thought they used the wrong recipe.  \n\nHubby had the teriyaki chicken and Jr. Yelper the teriyaki chicken and beef.  The chicken had a nice BBQ flavor but Jr. Yelper complained that the sauce over the meats was gooey and sweet.  You would pick up a piece of the meat and see the goo hanging from it like mucus.   The salad served with the dinners was the highlight of the meal with crispy lettuce, tomato and a nice tasting dressing.  Prices were much cheaper than at Noriega Teriyaki with combos about $10 and my tempura was $8 and the nigiri was $1.40 for the hamachi (each) and $1.80 for the uni (ea).

A lot of you might have missed this small little restaurant situated on Noriega between 19th and 20th. Keep your eyes open though because this place is a gem. I have no idea how long this place has been here, but I'm glad I got the chance to try it out tonight.\n\nFood was delicious from the get-go. From the tasty salad with fresh greens and a delectable dressing to my scrumptious entree the beef amiyaki, the food was overall great. Some of the dishes we ordered:\n\nSeaweed Salad\nGyoza- More than 6 pieces, cooked perfectly, nice skin and cheap\nAgadashi tofu- A delicious, chewy membrane encasing the tofu\nAlaska Roll- Good AND cheap\nRainbow Roll- Good AND cheap\nDynamite Roll- Good AND cheap\nDonburi- Average, but large portions\nHamachi sashimi- Fresh AND cheap\nBeef amiyaki- Heaven!\n\nI just have to say again GET THE BEEF AMIYAKI. Apparently, it's their specialty. Served sizzling on an iron plate, it's tender, juicy, and just crazy delicious. All the food here looks to be priced at a bargain. It's not as cheap as Kitaro or Kiki, but it's better quality.\n\nOnly small complaint was the level of service here. The wait can get pretty long as there's only one lady working all the tables. I'm sure she means well and wants customer satisfaction, but her service skills could use a little polishing as well. Nothing to dwell on, though, as the food was fantastic and a deal. If you want to avoid the long lines and pricey menus at Okazu Ya, Koo, or Ebisu in the Sunset, come check this place out.", "author": "jeff c."}

When I pulled up the review I knew right away where this place was. I brought my gf and our 2 kids, after sitting down I realized I hadn't been here in about 25 years!\n\nI completely agree with Bret M. this place is great for what it is. If you want some fru fru fancy fusion Japanese iron chef food then keep moving along. If you want honest home style Japanese cooking (albeit with some American influence) at a bargain price than give this place a chance. I've been looking for an honest, flavorful Katsu donburi that wasn't $10! It bothers me to pay $10 for a simple (supposed to be inexpensive) dish like Katsu donburi. Though I've found a couple places that were about $8-$9 there were mostly bland.\n\nThank you Fujiyama-Ya for serving up a savory and generous sized Katsu donburi for $7.95. My gf ordered the Saba teriyaki, the fish was salty like my  mom/grandma would make and you get a whole half  with rice, miso soup and salad for...$7.95. My boy ordered Tempura udon, they allowed him to have all shrimp vs. mixed, for no extra charge unlike most places and they gave him 5 or 6 pieces...$6.95, my girl ordered beef udon, lots of meat, not the best broth I've had but it was good enough. I ordered a crunchy roll, it wasn't bad not outstanding but was inexpensive.\n\nBottom line, I will be back, the price is an extra bonus.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-15", "description": "It's hard writing a review for a restaurant that you've been going to ever since you were a kid.  For one thing, the quantity of visits certainly begins to outweigh whatever ideas or opinions you may have had at some point about quality.  But then again, if the food were really horrible, you wouldn't have been going back week in, week out for the past 15 years, would you?  \n\nTo be honest, the food here is mostly serviceable.  The sukiyaki is somewhat too sweet, as is their katsu-don.  Each time I have it, I find myself gulping down their green tea as I'd never enjoyed it before.  At least you can say they're consistent though.  For about 10 years straight, I'd order the chicken teriyaki, which in my opinion, is unbeatable.  But you're thinking, \"It's chicken teriyaki...how hard can it be to mess that up?\"  But really, their sauce is thick and tasty, their chicken never dry.\n\nAfter trying most menu items though, I can safely say that their Beef Amiyaki is the best.  It is at once sweet and smoky, sizzlingly aromatic.  The beef, if you are able to lift it off the grill fast enough, is soft and tender, always begging to devoured.\n\nLately, since I've become more health conscious, I've only been ordering their chirashi and sashimi.  For a restaurant nestled in the Sunset, I have to understand that sometimes, their fish might not be the freshest...but what price comfort?  So what if the fish is sometimes frozen and the selection is somewhat limited?  What comes out is no more, no less than what you pay for.\n\nI wouldn't in a million years give up the familiarity I have with this largely neighborhood establishment for the hipper and chicer sushi bars in Noe Valley or the god forsaken Marina.  What this place lacks in atmosphere, decor, and scene-ability, it makes up for in service, kindness, and downright charm.  I've known Esther for 15 years; she's seen me grow up from a fat kid with crooked teeth to a skinny 25 year old with crooked teeth.

Even though this place is slightly more pricer than other Japanese restaurants its well worth it. The food is good and the people who work here are nice and friendly. I would recommend the beef amayaki (marinaded steak) it comes to you in a sizzling hot plate. It is simply mouth watering good. Although it might leave your clothes splattered in hot oil and smelling like the steak, but i think it's well worth it. I usually get combo J because i love salmon. It's salmon teriyaki and sashimi (you can choose from tuna and salmon). I would also recommend the sukiyaki (vegetables and meat in a sweet broth) this place makes the best sukiyaki and it's only about 10$.

Their sushi menu is semi-extensive, with smaller, less complicated rolls--Makis range from $2-3, Special, more complicated rolls range from $4.95-$7.95 (extremely good deal for rolls!!--which are my fav!)  One roll to stay away from however is their Dynamite roll (spicy hamachi & maguro--came out mushy, and a bit stringy). For Sashimi, I'd stay away from the fish thats in the rolls. \n\nThe place itself is not too shabby..it looks a bit on the old side, but does have some nice japanese decorations along with rice paper walls....cute and super cozy (its so small!) Full house on a Saturday night seats about 40 people max.\n\nThe waitresses are nice, but a bit slow..it took quite a while for our dishes to come out, and they don't come out all at once..which is a bit odd. Miso soup and salad are included with the meal though, which is always good. \n\nOverall, a meal for 3 people or 2 hungry fatasses, will be about $40...well worth it for all the food you get!

They have a box for $14.95 with a choice of meat, gyoza, tempura, and sashimi. If you're really hungry - that bento is a good deal. My favorite combo items are the unagi (eel) with sashimi. I was given a bowl of salad, miso soup, unagi and sashimi (served on individual dishes). After having some sushi rolls - California roll, Catepillar, and Crunchy Roll - I was half full. By the time my entree came - I could only finish the sashimi. I like the freshness and texture of the sashimi and they were generous giving me 8 pieces. I also like the teryaki beef, chicken and salmon - the teryaki sauce is sweet like honey and light. You can't go wrong with what you're ordering.

My boyfriend who has gotten wrangled into yelp picked this place based on its location (close to our home), prices and yelp reviews (I am such a proud girlfriend!!). I ordered a dinner salad, crunchy roll and spicy tuna roll and I have to tell you all 3 were fantastic! I was worried about the salad dressing because its honestly hit or miss, but this one was so tasty - it hit the spot. The spicy tuna roll was fresh and had a great finishing sauce that really made it kick and the crunchy roll was good as well. My boyfriend who has trouble keeping our order down to what we can eat also wanted to try the Gyoza which was not great - mushy and over cooked so much so that the veggies didn't have any taste, plus the sauce was super sweet and not complimenting to the dish. Since he is a veggie man he also ordered two rolls which were pickled to the point that the radish and squash were so salty they were not really editable. Sorta disappointing. He did order Udon as well and really enjoyed that and felt the soup had a good flavor. So a mixed bag overall. \n\nI think this place has potential but they need to retool some of their menu items and also get another server!

I'd say the sushi is not quite as good as Yum Yum Fish Sushi's take-out but the slightly lower price combined with a cozy restaurant to eat it in by far makes up for any minor variation on quality or style.  Service was good and cheerful, I don't demand much or anything during my meal but the waitress was attentive and helpful to get down the orders and get the food out.   Really just an all around satisfying dinner out.  A hole in the wall I hope to visit again.\n\nUpdate-- I came here again with a date and we had a ton of food-- sushi, tempura, edamame, wine and maybe more than I've forgot.  Very very good.  We sampled more expensive rolls since her work was paying :) and were very happy with the quality.  But still the bill overall was reasonable.", "author": "Shelley M."}

The dynamite roll was the best, the spicy sauce made it really good, I would order it again when I go back. \n\nWe also ordered the Beef Amiyaki which was DELICIOUS! Juicy and tender; a must try!

Normally I always order the gyoza dinner or if I am extra hungry, a bento. The other night, because of some dental work, I decided I had to order something easy to eat. I settled, reluctantly, for the udon with tempura, assuming the tempura would be mushy from soaking in the broth. Such a nice surprise after the dentist: the tempura (2 shrimp, lump of fish, string bean, carrot slices, potato) came separately, which allowed me to soften the tempura to suit my needs.

The soft-shell crab had a slightly burnt, heavy crust, more like what you would find a tourist seafood shop than a good Japanese restaurant.  I was looking for the tartar sauce.\n\nThe sushi and sashimi was presented artlessly, a real oddity for a \"Japanese\" restaurant (I'm pretty sure they are Chinese or Korean), the rolls were amateurish, and some of the fish wasn't fresh enough for raw eating.  In particular, the salmon had an over-the-hill flavor - it would have been acceptable for teriyaki, but not for sashimi.

I had never seen a sushi place cut their salmon into such inelegant chunks before.  It was as if they were going to feed their cat with this, and gave it to me at the last second when I placed the order.  Not that I really care about presentation that much (I'm not a judge on Iron Chef, for crying out loud), but I should have realized this was the tip off that this place sucked.  The fish was horrible, and tasted both fishy and rubbery.  I took one bite and left the rest of the order on the table.  Thank God I didn't get gastrointestinal distress or worse from that.\n\nAs well, the gyoza was bad.  Man, if you can't even get THAT right, there's something wrong.  There really is no excuse for having such below average gyoza.  Here some advice to Japanese restaurants:  If you're really desperate for gyoza, just go to Costco and buy a bag of Ling Ling potstickers... boil, fry in frying pan with lots of vegetable oil, and pass them off as gyoza.  YOU NO LONGER HAVE ANY EXCUSE FOR TERRIBLE GYOZA!!!", "author": "Stan L."}

A four-star average for this place? \n\nThis place looks authentic, smells authentic, yet tastes unauthentic.  I could've sworn the place was THE BOMB five years ago.  Either (1) My tastes have improved, or (2) Their quality has deteriorated.  Or both.  \n\nThe menu is mediocre - contains your typical teriyaki / tempura / yakiniku / tonkatsu / sushi / sashimi.  Randomly chose beef amiyaki because of its funky name and the fact that I haven't seen it elsewhere.  \n\nThe beef amiyaki (grilled beef marinated in mildly sweet soy sauce served on a hot plate) was delicious (albeit a bit fatty), and their rolls were tasty and the sushi chef was generous with the fillings.    \n\nThe salmon sashimi, though, was just about the worst that I've had - huge contrast from the melt-in-your-mouth variety that we got from Tanto (see my other review).  \n\nThe price tag is probably just about the best thing about this place.  $2.95 for a big fat spicy tuna roll, $5.95 for volcano roll that could easily cost $10 elsewhere.  \n\nLater on we realized - this place is operated by Koreans.  That explains the awesome beef dish and the mediocre everything else.\n\nA rather underwhelming start to a weekend... but anyway.", "author": "Ange L."}

We got here at 7:15 and we left at 8:30pm. It wasn't crowded, the problem is that they only had one waitress. I have to say she did an excellent job with what hand that she was dealt with. We waited and waited and waited for food and drink to come but we understood the lions den that we waltzed into so no surprises. We finally got our food around 7:50 and boy was it worth the wait. I ordered a Dynamite Roll and a Rainbow Roll and the wife had the Beef Donburi. The sushi was very good and grade A quality and lots of it on the plate. But the real winner to me was the Beef Donburi. Something as simple and as boring as this dish was the kind of cut of meat that they used was well worth the 7.50. I fully expected thin little mitre saw cuts of beef cooked so long that you could slap a person with it and it would draw a tear. But no.... this meat was tender and thick cubes over rice and drenched in teriyaki sauce. I'm going to have to come back to try another type of sushi roll but I highly recommend it but you may want to do Take out....BTW if you open the door and it stays open, it's an automatically closing door.

The lady who serves is so nice and she always remembers me, my husband and our baby (now a toddler). We've been going here for almost two years and never had a bad meal. \nI usually order the salmon teriyaki and while you can tell the fish is not as high quality as what you'd get (for double the price) at Fuji, it's still delicious and the teriyaki sauce is so tasty! I also love that unlike other Japanese places I've been to, they give you a generous ladle of sauce - they don't skimp. Love it!\nThe chicken katsu is the best I've tried - they use breast instead of thighs, which I definitely prefer.\nMy husband likes the chicken donburi (I didn't care for it). \nThe only thing I've tried here that I really thought was bad was the oshidashi, which was way too sweet for my taste.\nThe food isn't spectacular, five star food, but it's good, almost home-cooked feeling food and always comforting. And like another reviewer said - lots of kindness all around. I've never had an impatient or unkind attitude from the woman who works here and we've been there on some extremely busy nights where lesser people would have been downright rude.\nSo - whenever we're in the mood for Japanese food at a good price, this is where we go. Warning though - don't go on a Saturday night - Sundays are touch and go too if you go after 7. You might wait a long time!\nBut weeknights, and Sundays before 7 - yummy, comfort Japanese food.\nYay Fujiyama-Ya. Now I'm craving salmon teriyaki.", "author": "Laura G."}

The place is cozy which gives a feel of authenticity. When we walked in, it took a while for someone to attend to us. Overall though, the service is very good. We got the back booth which was very private and nice. The prices on the menu are really cheap. I search far and wide for delicious sashimi combos and chirashi. The next time I see 16 pieces of sashimi for $13.95, I'll be sure to rethink ordering it. Reading the menu got me really excited because everything looked good and was really reasonably priced. However, when the food came out, it was just mediocre. The best thing was the grilled unagi. I like that they give the table a container of rice to share (like a chinese restaurant) so you don't have to order individual bowls. I had the sashimi combo and the fish was NOT fresh. It was mushy. The tempura is also overly battered. I left over half of my sashimi and the waitress asked if there was something wrong with it. I didn't want to be rude, so just said it was too much. But she asked again with a genuine concern, so I told her that it wasn't that fresh. She ended up giving us $5 in cash (as a discount on the sashimi) when she gave us our credit card back, but we refused to take the $5.

Their sushi rice in the chirashi has little bits of tamago (sweet egg omelette) and nori (dried seaweed) which I think is an enjoyable little perk. Donburi here is reasonable and decent too although it does not come with egg as I am traditionally used to seeing. Sushi rolls and Sashimi pricing are pretty cheap and everything came out good. I am definitely going to stop by more often when I'm in the neighborhood!", "author": "Tracy N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-10-04", "description": "I love the small family restaurant atmosphere. It keeps the prices down and the food authentic. I ordered the pink salmon roll and a salmon skin hand roll. It took the kitchen forever to make the food. I think they serve one table at a time. The salmon skin would have been better if they put some sauce to make it juicier. The sashimi is pretty worth it. For a side, you get 7 pieces for 8 bucks. The yellow tail was good, but the salmon quality was lame. Overall, a good place to go for a cheap slow meal.", "author": "Wendy L."}

This is my second time coming here, and probably not the last. The first time was super busy, so the waitress kept forgetting about certain things (like a whole caterpillar roll!). It's ok though, she was the only one working and it was hectic. \n\nThe second time was more pleasant. Between us two girls, we ordered a combo dinner (beef teriyaki, tempura, rice, and salad) to share, crunchy roll, and spicy tuna roll. Oh, and I think our meals comes with complimentary miso soup. The beef was good, it wasn't over cooked or tough like some other places. I like their salad dressing on their salad. Tempura is ok, but I don't really like tempura by itself anyway. The crunchy roll was good also. And who can beat the $2.95 six piece spicy tuna roll! That is definitely a bang for your buck! \n\nThe total came out to be around $22 excluding tip. I like this place better than Noriega Teriyaki. Even though this place is a lot smaller, the prices and the food are a lot better than Noriega Teriyaki. \n\nOh yeah, there is a Japanese painting that looks like some guy is peeing off the balcony. I'm pretty sure other yelpers have caught on, because they have uploaded pictures on this site. haha", "author": "Julie L."}

It's a pretty small place and you may have to wait if they're busy.  It feels pretty homey.  They use to have fish katsu on the menu which isn't that common at other Japanese restaurants.  I wanted to try the Beef Amiyaki which had good reviews, but when I was there I saw that it just looked like a piece of steak (too much meat), so instead, I went for the beef sukiyaki which was good.  It was also a lot of food and I had leftovers.", "author": "S Y."}

Been four or five times, and a two person check, with booze, is still only like 20-25 bucks. Last night I just go sushi and I thought it was really good. I'm not pretending to be a sushi aficionado, but I got the snapper and the yellowtail and they were both really good. The spicy tuna roll had a little bit too much of the spicy sauce stuff, but the flavor of the tuna was really good. Domestic beer only 1.95 a bottle!! and 2.95 for a bottle of Japanese import, or six for a big one. The service is always friendly and efficient, and they don't rush you in and out. I have noooo idea if their sushi is top notch or not, but I can walk here from my place and I've never had to wait. Really like it here.", "author": "Christopher V."}

My mom especially likes their sukiyaki and orders the combination of sukiyaki and chicken teriyaki, the portions for this are bigger to go than dining in.  Either way you'll get full, and it'll be a good full. The food is good, the waitress is really sweet, and the prices are low.", "author": "Tiff L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-08", "description": "I love sushi and tempera. This place is great for the price. I usually get the sushi rolls, but I steer away from any fish that contain fish bones, i.e. tuna, salmon, etc. My boss recommended this place and I enjoyed eating here my first time. The second time, I found a fish bone in one of my rolls, thus I stay away from the sushi rolls containing fish with bones. My favorite roll is Golden California roll. I usually order the tempera as well. I tend to eat the shrimp and broccoli tempera (and zucchini tempera if they serve it) and let my bf eat the other veggie tempera. The service is pretty good as well. The teriyaki chicken was alright, but the teriyaki sauce was gooey texture. It tasted okay but wasn't visually appealing. Other than that, it's a cheaply priced place for sushi and other various Japanese cuisine. It's definitely worth a try.", "author": "J L."}

Yeah, it's kinda like that. Ha. But in all seriousness, Fujiyama-Ya is quite possibly the best home cooked Japanese food that I have eaten and comfortably afforded in San Francisco. Upon viewing the outside of the restaurant you might be scared away by the local patrons at the Eagles dive bar (which is amazing...) but don't be, they are harmless. Also pay no mind to the other empty restaurants on the block; Fuji's has them all. The sushi is always fresh and top quality, the miso soup is always perfect and just warm enough, and to finish it off, the service is next to family status. My girlfriend is a fan of the spicy tuna roll, miso soup and the salad dressing. I must agree; those items are very well done. For those that wish to find a little bit of grandma's cooking, try the Sukiyaki and the Chicken dombori just like grandmas. The price is cheap, if your putting on a collard shirt and stepping into a sushi bar that involves more music and neon lights than it does Japanese people...get out of there and find yourself a new club in north beach, because your paying to much for edible fashion. This place reminds me of everything that I have done right in life, with that said...do it to it.", "author": "Patrick K."}

Yakiniu was well marinated with an interesting medley of vegetables - eggplant and asparagus were particularly good. the Chicken Amiyaki was not exceptional, but most pieces were moist and sweet. i'll try the beef next time. the miso soup and salad that started the meal were standard, but  a nice start to the meal. the hot tea was tasty, but i will order a sake next time.", "author": "Char Z."}
