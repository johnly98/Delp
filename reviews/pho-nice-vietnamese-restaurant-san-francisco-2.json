{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-09", "description": "I LOVE THIS PLACE. So firstly, I'm a little bit obsessed with Asian food, especially Vietnamese. My go-to dish is Pork Vermicelli w/ Imperial Roll (B\u00fan Thot Nong) which is 10$ on the dot. It's simple, yummy, and comes with lots of fresh veggies that I love, grilled pork, and a crispy Imperial Roll. \n\nThis place by far has the BEST IMPERIAL ROLLS I'VE EVER EATEN. One if the women that works there told me that they hand make their rice paper for the rolls which is what makes them so good. I don't know how they do it but the texture is unlike any imperial roll or egg roll I've ever had...and it's amazing. \n\nThe staff here is pretty timid, but friendly, and the food is decently priced. Be careful trying to stop by here if it's close to closing time - if they aren't busy sometimes they will close early. \n\nTwo things to note:\n\n- Ambience is pretty non-existent, not fancy at all, sometimes there isn't even music playing. Definitely not the right place if you're looking for romance, but maybe you can order it to-go and take it home for a romantic evening because the food is BOMB.\n\n- There is a 13$ minimum for credit cards, with a $0.50 fee if you're under that. Also tax is included in the prices so that's kind of nice...", "author": "Taylor D."}

I stopped here on a wim that I would find comfort in a hot bowl of traditional beef Pho. Instead my noodles were cooked until very soft and when I tasted the broth. I thought I would find anise and cinnamon but found none. Sadly I tried to add chilli and hoisin but it could not hide the bland flavor of an empty beef broth.  I had to ask for some basil as they did not serve the soup with the traditional basil, chards and bean sprouts so I only got noodles. I'll keep looking for a phone spot with an awesome broth.

I've always drove past it but finally decided to give it a try. I got the fresh spring rolls and the pho with steak. I must say they do a great job with the food presentation. The spring rolls were rolled in a cute way where the lettuce was sticking out and they were even placed neatly on a plate. Not only did they look good but they also tasted good. \n\nFor the pho, I asked for the steak on the side. When my order came, each slice of steak was nearly and  individually folded too! When I was ordering, I was a bit skeptical because the pho was almost eight dollars. But when the food came out, it made sense considering how large the bowl of pho was. I was also very satisfied with how much steak I received.\n\nI thought the broth was so delicious and oh not the mention the noodles. Usually pho comes with the skinny rice noodles but this pho had the fat flat rice noodles. I felt like it made the pho so much better. Definitely can't wait to come back. The only downside might be that there were not a lot of options on the menu but I don't like having too many options anyway.", "author": "Annie H."}

Even with only 1 waitress and 1 cook on staff during my visit? They still were able to match Kevins Noodle house for speed even though there were 5 other tables filled to capacity.\n\nThe good news is.

Everything seems to be in order.\n\nThe bad news. Parking can be a bitch and some of the characters who loiter  the area make you feel like its another level in GTA III.

We ordered vermicelli with grilled pork and imperial rolls and an appetizer of more imperial rolls. Lol I'm very pregnant and really wanted imperial rolls. Anyways the young lady lets us know they are out of imperial rolls so they will have to prepare and make a fresh batch and it will take longer. I didn't mind the wait. She then came out and said they were out of vermicelli noodles! What Vietnamese place doesn't have vermicelli!? She said if she could substitute with rice and I mean it becomes a totally different plate but we said ok. \n\nThe imperial rolls were a solid 3/5. They didn't have that flavor fullness that most have but we're very crunchy and overall okay.\n\nThe grilled pork was 4/5. But the portion was soooo small. \n\nWe went to the register to pay and it was strange to me that the bill was exactly $24. I double checked and it seemed like she rounded the taxes, it's not that I couldn't pay them I just asked why she did that. She proceeded to try and tell me that she was bad at math but I calculated wrong? I just ignored it and gave her my credit card. Then she asked if I lived around there or worked around there. I said no. She commented about how it was weird that we came in and how they don't advertise their restaurant.

I would suggest showing how the real dish appears on the menu, or make the dish the way it is shown in the menu.\n-Grilled chicken rice plate: S.O. loved it. Comes with grilled chicken w/o the skin, dipping sauce/soup, rice, and veggies.\n-Pho w/ rare steak: Flavorful! Plenty of meat and noodles. I did notice there were no bean sprouts though, which I wish they could include since that's what most Vietnamese restaurants offer and since this dish is a little bit more expensive compared to others (~$8).\n-Thai iced tea: Sweet treat throughout dinner. =)\n\nA few other suggestions would be to update their menu. It set us a little off seeing how pen marks were made to increase the price for certain dishes. Maybe it's a money saving thing, but it looks more professional to not see those type of errors or even realizing the dish is now more expensive than it was before.

In fairness, the bowl was a little bigger than most, I couldn't finish it! \n\nMy roommate ordered their fried spring roll vermicelli and got pork vermicelli. She had to wait a very long time to get the waitress' attention because she was busy on her laptop. When she mentioned she received the wrong order because she ordered spring roll vermicelli, the waitress proceeded to tell her she didn't, and that she ordered pork. My roommate doesn't even like pork...Eventually her order was changed and you could evidently see they just took the pork out and added spring rolls (sauce all over the edge of the dish). :/\n\nPros: Fried spring rolls are yum.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT UPDATE:\nNot the best service or prices in town, but I have come back because of the proximity. Nothing really spectacular. Also, prices have gone up yet again. Wth. Menu said $7.90, yet when the bill came we were charged $8.50. Pho MEAN of them.

She said yes a few months ago. I said, I have been buying for four months and the price was always the same.\nShe started speaking  loudly in Vietnamese to other people working in the restaurant creating a disturbance.

The spring rolls were definitely on point as well as the pho... wasn't the best pho I had but it wasn't as bad as the people that described it in the bottom reviews. I would come back here again.", "author": "Victor L."}

I used to go here when the old management was there and the recipe for the food is still the same (which is awesome!) I always get the pho and its always so flavorful :) But the weird thing is, every time I go there and get pho they never have bean sprouts. Isn't it normal to have bean sprouts in a Vietnamese restaurant?", "author": "Annie K."}

I often pass by Pho Nice but I'm never in any need to try it out.  I did today, however.  The food was overpriced and low quality.  I enjoy supporting all local businesses in my neighborhood but unfortunately Pho Nice will not be one of them.  The vermicelli plate is very below average.  Minimal effort was put into the sliced vegetables and the pork was fatty to the point that it was inedible--not to mention incredibly salty. Not recommended.", "author": "Amber R."}

Now the ultimate upset was the fact that they had the nerve to say the don't carry bean sprouts? WTF and the only condiments where some massacred cilantro and a damn lemon? Dude GTFOH! I think Ive said enough here good effing bye!", "author": "Fanon P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-01-26", "description": "Terrible pho. Noodles were over cooked and falling apart, broth was too salty with very little flavor, didn't come with a side of fresh bean sprout because they \"don't have it\".  \n\nWhat you do mean you \"don't have it\", did you run out or are all other Vietnamese restaurants are wrong to serve pho with bean sprouts. \n\nWe didn't expect much service, at least that lived up to our expectations.", "author": "J S."}

Such small portion and the noodles were FALLING apart... I should really just grab a needle and inject my noodle crumbs directly into my stomach. Three stars for fast service and also nice staff.
