I ordered the Crab Cioppino [$34.95, 2.5 stars].  Overpriced, small portion, and the highlight was crab pieces with shell inside molten lava of a tomato-based soup.

This place stands out from the other local places by looking like it was brought straight from Greece. With the nice outdoor seating, you can enjoy a beer with the great Cali weather. While looking at their drink menu, the waiter told us it was Happy Hour, so that made us order a few more than what we expected. I also ordered the fried calamari. \nBeing in California, the seafood does taste fresher, but calamari is an easy plate to mess up. Too much breading and that's all you'll taste, not cooked for the perfect amount of time and it becomes chewy or just uneatable. Their calamari was good, but not great. Would I eat it again? Absolutely, specially during Happy Hour. I've had worse, and paid way more. \nIf you're looking for a chill place, cold drinks, and good Happy Hour specials, this is a good stop for you.", "author": "Luis S."}

DOES THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS RESTAURANT KNOW ITS 2018 and one person SHOULD NOT SHUT A WHOLE PORTION OF A MENU DOWN!\n\nTo say the least I will not be back, but not because of the lack of mismanagement, but because the sever didn't even bother to mention that half of the menu wasn't available when we were ordering. Just after we had spent almost $30 on happy hour items and was proceeding to order our entrees, then it dawns on him to tell us about the lack of menu choices. \n\nSorry, this place is no gem", "author": "Wanda R."}

Fisherman's Wharf is famous for their seafood and clam chowder and I was sure that a clam chowder soup from any restaurant in this area would be a delicious, safe pick. Unfortunately, that was not the case for Pompei's. The clam chowder was watery and did not have much meat at all, it was mostly vegetables with no creamy texture. I got it in a bread bowl and it was half full with not much to eat. Other than that, the staff was very friendly.", "author": "Victoria C."}

My friend and I were drawn in by the happy hour menu and daily specials as I'm sure most other people are - drinks for $3-$6, bread bowl clam chowder for $5 and fish and chips for $8. My friend had the chowder and fish and chips. She reported back that the chowder was disappointing even for $5; there were probably 2 pieces of clam in the entire thing and the portion was close to half a can of soup you might get at the supermarket - ridiculous! \n\nI was most astounded, however, about the poor service and the fact that nobody took responsibility for it. When the bill came, we were charged $20 instead of $8 for the fish and chips. Upon inquiring, the staff sort of laughed and said that we \"ordered the large size\". In other words, too bad for me. At no point did the server try to clarify whether we wanted the fish and chips on special for $8 (which I'm assuming is a much smaller size) or the \"larger\" $20 plate. They were unapologetic and there was no attempt to resolve the issue. Ridiculous kind of bait and switch for a place with signs all over the place proudly advertising their specials. \n\nThe bloody mary was pretty decent. If you go for the $4 bloody mary, make sure you clarify you want the one on special rather than the $16 one... at least they got that one right.", "author": "Sarah P."}

The bruschetta was two nice sized pieces, loaded with tomatoes, garlic, and oil. It was flavorful, and a good little appetizer. The chowder was great! I have no chowder experience outside of a can of soup (which I hated), so I thought this was awesome. I feel like maybe the bread bowl had been cut open recently and was in the early stages of drying out, but it didn't really take away from the meal. My guy enjoyed his tacos a lot as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-08-28", "description": "As I begin to write this review I notice that this restaurants management has not responded to any previous reviews so I hope this does not fall on deaf ears.  \n\nMy wife and I visited this establishment on Sunday evening. Our server promptly greeted us and took our drink order.  My wife really enjoyed her cocktail and we were pleased with the crab cake starter we ordered and then things went downhill from there.  \n\nI ordered a fettuccine dish with a variety of seafood in a creamy tomato sauce.  My dish was a little bland and the pasta was slightly undercooked. In addition, the calamari was over cooked and chewy. I somewhat expect this in seafood combo dishes because some cooks are lazy and do not layer ingredients into the dish properly so no big deal.  \n\nThe real issue was with my wife's dish. She ordered a fried seafood platter consisting of cod, shrimp, calamari, and scallops.  The scallops were almost raw so we sent the dish back which only made matters worse.  Instead of cooking new scallops the kitchen made the decision to throw the entire plate back into the deep fryer which is a huge no-no.  While the scallops came cooked, everything else on the plate was now over cooked and greasy tasting.  \n\nOur server was very apologetic when we decided to send back both of our entrees and call it a night.  We asked that both entrees be removed from the bill. At this point I expected to see a manager come to the table to apologize and try to rectify the matter but that never happened.  I actually apologized to our server and told him I felt bad that he was in the position of having to be in a customer facing role representing an inept kitchen staff and a manager that obviously does not care about his  customers or his staff. Our server smiled, nodded, and gave me a look that told me I was accurate.  \n\nAvoid this place at all cost. If management continues to sweep these glaring issues under the rug and ignore their customers feedback I expect their fate will be much like that of the city whose name they have taken.", "author": "Bob R."}

After checking out some places on yelp, We found this. It is right in the center of the main road going between Fisherman's wharf, and Ghiradelli Square. It is the PERFECT spot for people watching. We sat outside on the patio, and barely even talked as we watched all the San Fran Crazies go by. Our server was attentive, humorous, and friendly. \n\nThe sour dough was perfect, melt in your mouth.\nThe fish was a native Pacific Ocean one, and tasted identical to cod. It wasn't anything special, and was served with veggie sides that were pretty nasty, and definitely not fresh.  The pasta was also way too oily, and had no flavor. I feel like there is much better food to have tried at other places. However, for my 10 hours that I had in San Fran, I was satisfied for choosing here.", "author": "Kim B."}

We were seated on the patio, which was very busy, but the inside of the restaurant looked a little dead (it's Fisherman's Wharf afterall).\n\nWe order almost everything on the happy hour menu ($5-7.5) except for the calamari:\n- buffalo wings: no surprise, comme ci comme ca\n- mussels: the mussels were tiny and not very fresh, but the garlic butter parsley sauce was excellent with bread!\n- fried shrimps: tasted like pre-frozen shrimps but tasted pretty good with the tartar sauce\n- fish tacos: really meh...\n- garlic parmesan fried: crispy, and very flavourful! Liked this menu the most\n\nWe also ordered the fisherman's stew ($26) (tomato broth with mussels, shrimps, calamari, fish with a side of sourdough toast). I'd give this a 7/10, they didn't cheap out on the seafood, but the broth was a little too tangy, and did not absorb the flavour of the seafood well enough. The portion was huge though!

View of Golden Gate and Alcatraz nice but not very edible. Next day, tried Pompei. No view but what a difference. These places were a late lunch for us so seating not much of a problem.\n \nPompei's Grotto is the place for linquini and clams. I died for it. My wife had the sea bass and was absolutely in love with it and she's a really picky sea bass person. \nThe good Italian wine with the great sourdough bread and butter was another hit. \n\nSeeing the pictures on the wall near the bar area was neat as I had been coming to Fisherman's Wharf with my parents since I was a kid.

FISHERMNA'S SOUP / Cioppino\ni chose the fisherman's tomato based soup as opposed to the ciopinno b/c i don't care for crabs. IT WAS EXCELLENT - and MUCH BETTER than Scoma's b/c it was not a tomato paste broth but fresh tomatoes - if you know how overwhelming a thicker paste tomato is and is not good. the fish was full filet pieces and excellent fresh clams, shrimp.  i would guarantee the cioppino is some of the best around\n\n3. Bread - famous Boudin SF sourdough - a perfect accompaniment to the soup and the sandabs. \n\nIf you're looking for a god meal, in the area of the embarcadero / whaft area, YOU MUST GO HERE, get these items and explore some others. \n\nMy whole bill was only $40 and that was one heck of a deal!  i didn't have cocktails but they do have a happy hour which seems to be quite good. \n\nWhen I am back in the area i will eat here all 2-3 meals and try all other SF items like the clam chowder, etc", "author": "Wayan T."}

First table we sat down at had a flickering light and that should have been a sign. The food wasn't memorable at all except for the sauce that drowned my meager cod portion. The half dungeness crab had a great sauce but the fish wasn't fresh and neither was the crab. We're in san Francisco and the waitress admitted that they don't get their fish caught fresh. Which is ridiculous. Kind of ticked we didn't go somewhere else with REAL fresh caught fish.", "author": "Gabi J."}

Heck, after trying it and having a little love affair with the food, I still can't say I'm completely sold on it.\n\nIn a bout of hunger, the BF and I decided to stop here for lunch. Coming here wasn't a random occurrence; With a plethora of restaurants to choose from along the walk of the wharf, the number one reason we decided to make the pit stop here was based on the suggestion of several friends. \"Francesco Misto\" and \"Crab Louis\", their words echoed. To me, the establishment screams out touristy, but I can't exactly put my finger on why. Location? Ambiance? Though I normally do try to avoid tourist \"traps\", I made sure to keep an open mind before taking the plunge. \n\nThe Crab Louis ($22) is one of the pricier salads I've had in my life. The sheer portion size though, makes it worth it! I didn't know that it was possible to actually overdose on crab, but I think if that's your goal, order this! Mountains of fresh crabmeat, already de-shelled for you, piled atop a mountain of fresh and tasty salad. I wish I knew prior that the Louis dressing closely resembles Thousand Island though... Not too huge of a fan.\n\nThe Francesco Misto (also $22) was freakin' life changing. Like the Crab Louis, the portion size of this is gigantor. Pasta, accompanied with bits of the ocean: mussels, clams, scallops, calamari, and shrimp. No skimping here either! There was so much seafood in the pasta, it almost felt like a bottomless bowl! I loved the sauce too. Perfect flavor, and thicker consistency... No soupy pasta for me!\n\nI can't lie, the food here is pretty damn delicioso. Service on the other hand, is another story. Staff here isn't particularly friendly or pleasant. One of the hosts walked right past us as we walked in, and we waited awkwardly in the hallway for someone else to seat us. Our server was a little pretentious, for who knows what reason, in an empty restaurant. Service here is also s-l-o-w, even though at the time, there were only four or five other groups dining. Water refill? Keep dreaming. Plus, does anyone in this place know how to crack a smile? \n\nThe food here is definitely worth a return visit...

All three of the fried items were bland, the cod was tough, and the tartar sauce was overly sweet (we asked them not to give us the cocktail sauce).  \n\nThe clam chowder tasted okay. It had a good amount of clam meat, but was not as hot as I would have liked. \n\nUgh, the Fettuccine Gamberetti... Terrible. It was tossed with rock shrimp, tomatoes, garlic, and basil in a bland cream sauce. Well, the rock shrimp definitely earned its name; its outer texture was rough and the inside of it was dry and hard. You know how dead shrimp tastes and feels like? Yeah, sort of like that, but worse.

The groupon doesn't state that you can't share so I was disappointed with their poor customer service.\n\nTime to review food. The clam chowder was mediocre. You will be better off going to boudin down the street. It was watery with no potatoes and too much celery.

It was reasonably priced, the food was pretty good, and the owners and servers were usually nice to us. Well, after the last experience I had, I will NEVER EVER EVER!!! be returning!\n\nI first stumbled around this place back in 2012. It was Thanksgiving day, I was with two of my friends, and this restaurant was one of the few that were open and reasonably priced. We sit down and order the clam chowder, bruschetta, and pasta with salmon. Everything was delicious and we were probably one of two parties in the restaurant. The server (who was also the owner) was really nice. The only downside was that because they were open Thanksgiving, they automatically added 20% tip to our bill. Okay.. my friends and I decided that it was a good restaurant spot, but we wouldn't come back on holidays. \n\nFast forward to about February 2014. At this point, I had been there a few times. Usually I sit on the left side of the restaurant, but because I had gone there for dinner, everything on that side was full. It was also about 6PM. When we arrived, the host said it would be about a 10 minute wait. Okay, no problem. We waited for about 7 minutes and they showed us to a table in the dining room area. We sat down and waited. I don't know if it's because we were younger or not tourists like the people that were sited around us, but we had been waiting for a good 10 - 15 minutes before we asked what we wanted to drink! I believe that she was purposely avoiding our table because she was serving the table to the left, to the right and behind us, both left and right sides and directly behind us. \n\nWhen she arrived at our table, she did not smile whatsoever, which was really strange because my friend and I had been WATCHING her for a good 10 minutes and she was laughing, cracking drinks, refilling drinks, etc. She bluntly asked what we wanted to drink and left. She returned a few minutes with a drink and left us to look at the menu. \n\nWe had to wait another 20 minutes! EVENTUALLY, another waitress had came by and took our order. It was funny because she serving the tables in another part of the restaurant, but just came by for our table. This server was really nice and very prompt with our order. \n\nThe food tasted delicious. The seafood tasted fresh and I was starving, so I was happy to finally eat. When it was time to pay, we had to wait another 10 minutes to ask for the check and when I put my card in it, my server was nowhere to be seen. I didn't want to spend another 10 minutes waiting, so I alerted the blonde server's attention. She looked at me very rudely and basically said, \"Okay, I'll give this to your server.\" We paid for the food and left. Dinner usually only takes about an hour, this time it took 2.5 hours. \n\nUsually, not that many things will bother me, but my friend and I were so disturbed by that experience that we promised we would never come back. I didn't appreciate that server's attitude and why was she serving everyone but us? It looked like she specifically served everyone with smiles, except us. The food is delicious, BUT THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND that server needs to be fired! I WOULD GIVE ZERO STARS IF I COULD.", "author": "Yubing J."}

As our server took our drink orders, one of our party asked if she didn't like a drink she was going to order, if she could change it to something different. The server rudely stated \"No. It's not free.\" (Didn't assume it was) Her drink came along about 20 minutes later, and it was AWFUL. She ordered the \"Pink Lemonade\" which tasted like straight lemon juice. We had to order cranberry juice and took one of our pineapple juice drinks to mix into her drink just to make it drinkable. The food was okay, we ordered a platter for an appetizer, some bruschetta, and avocado stuffed with tuna.

I was standing nearing a table inside but directly in the hot, glaring sun. The female server handed me 2 menus and said she'd be back.\n\n  When the fiancee came back, we noticed there were maybe 3-4 people inside the place so we decided to move to a cooler, better ventilated area of the restaurant since it was warm outside and wanted a break from the sun. I waited a few minutes until I saw the female server again and politely informed her that we moved due to the sun and pointed to where we relocated (which was closer to the bar and on the side of the restaurant where all the inside patrons were).\n\n   As I was turning around she said \"Oh we're not seating anyone right there now\"  which I was OK with UNTIL she muttered something very pessimistic and negative under her breath. As I turned around the male bartender said \"It's OK, you can sit there\" which then she repeated aloud. I appreciated the gesture from him considering there were 3 or 4 people at the bar, but the negative attitude by the female server made a bad first impression and made it seem like our business was not welcome. \n\n After consulting with my fiancee we got up and left. \n\n We could've done without the attitude and a bit of professionalism could've gone a long way since I was already understanding of her request.

The whole experience was a huge disappointment.\n\nWe went in and the host and all staff were in the bar area watching a basketball game and shouting at the TV.  We didn't know what to do so just waited until a random person just seated us.  Our waiter was terrible.  He kept forgetting our drinks so when we asked he said he'd bring it after he took our order.  We finally ordered and got our drinks but they were never refilled.  I had the Sea Bass and my other party had a caesar salad because the menu was not appealing.  The Sea Bass had to be cut with a knife...seriously...like WTF!?  Never have I ever needed a knife to cut fish.  The potatoes were so hard and seemed several days old and microwaved.  The carrots were not done and seemed microwaved as well.  Finally we tried to get our check.  It took so long, we finally got up and were going to walk out the door.  Then the waiter finally runs up and tells me he'll bring it to me.  I said no and followed him to the card machine.  I'm not sure what the staff was doing in the kitchen but I did not trust them alone with my credit card or anything else.  Horrible experience and a tourist trap.  Take the extra time and spend the extra money at another quality restaurant.  \n\nThere were some people across the restaurant I overheard complaining about the place too.  They said they had been going there for 15 years but something did not feel right with the place.  Their waitress mentioned that there was new ownership or something.  One of the draws was that this restaurant states it has been family owned since 1940 something.  This place is an absolute fraud, spend your money elsewhere.", "author": "Trey H."}

We sat outside on the cute patio tables and started off dinner with bruschetta with dungeness crab.  The tomatoes were so fresh, and the pairing with the crab is inspired. Our only gripe was that they used a little too much olive oil in the bruschetta so when I took a bite an oily bit ran own my chin.  I also tried one of the drink specials (champagne and fruit juices ) and for $6.50 it wasn't worth it.  My husband got a local beer Anchor Steam Beer) and enjoyed it though.\n\nFor our entrees my husband chose the Alfredo pasta with bay shrimp.  I got Francesco's Misto and subbed the tomato basil sauce for a cream sauce because I was craving white sauce.   The  misto was worth the $20 from the amount of seafood in the dish alone.  In every bite I had a clam, mussel, scallop, shrimp, calamari or squid piece.  The cream sauce was light but rich at the same time.  I was full halfway through but finished every bit because it was THAT good.   The alfredo dish was rich, creamy and buttery and the shrimp were delicate and sweet.  The sauce might have been a tad too buttery, but after walking San Fran all day my husband didn't mind the extra calories.  \n\nService was great, we got our food quickly and with a friendly smile.  Towards the end of our meal a rowdy crowd with fancy old vehicles parked in the loading zone right next to our tables.  Apparently they had come from a car show and were friends with the owners. They were a little loud and quickly drew a crowd so we had people on our right craning to take pictures and a stereo bass bumping to the left.

Maybe it was filled with tourists, maybe some were locals on a date, but I was surprised by the number of people at the restaurant so late on a weekday!\n\nI picked the place (based on location and Yelp reviews) and so when I met my date there, he mentioned clam chowder and the crab or shrimp sandwich as *the* things to get here. We opted to get a glass of wine each, so we asked the waitress for suggestions for a red wine. She pointed out a pinot noir that turned out to be quite nice. Then we ordered one shrimp sandwich and one crab sandwich, as well as two cups of clam chowder.\n\nI'm really bad a gauging time when I'm involved in a conversation, but it didn't seem too long before our soups were in front of us! They were the perfect temperature to dig in (not too hot, but not luke warm, either). A cup was the perfect serving size for me. I'm not usually a huge clam chowder fan, but this was really good. It wasn't bulked up with excessive chunks of potatoes. There was a good amount of clams and pieces of diced celery, along with thin slices of potatoes. The broth also wasn't too creamy. They didn't give us any oyster crackers, but there was sourdough bread for the table.\n\nWhen they cleared our cups, our sandwiches came out shortly afterwards. My date and I traded halves so we could try the crab and the shrimp sandwiches. The shrimp one came with bay shrimp coated in mayo with some added spices and a thick layer of iceberg lettuce on thinly sliced sourdough bread. It was pretty good, but not super amazing. The crab one, however, was really good. One bite into it and I could taste how fresh it was! The crab was also coated in mayo, but it didn't take away from the crab. Our sandwiches were accompanied by shoestring fries and a small container of dipping sauce (my guess is thousand island dressing). Our waitress also brought out a bottle of ketchup, just in case.\n\nService-wise, our waitress was very attentive, making sure our food was good and checking up to see if my date wanted another glass of wine when his was empty. We pretty much closed the place down since we got there so late and were involved in conversation, but our waitress didn't hurry us out or anything.\n\nIt was a seafood restaurant with good food in a touristy location, so it was fairly pricey, as can be expected.

The latter at least had some local offerings.\n\nI wasn't in for a big meal, so I got the Louie salad with \"bay\" shrimp, crab meat, egg, and avocado over greens and their house made dressing.  My dining companion got a local fish, plainly grilled.\n\nI almost had to laugh when the salad was placed in front of me.  I hadn't seen those tiny pinkie- nail sized shrimp from a can since I was a kid in the midwest.  As five year olds we may have oohed and aahed upon finding them in my Aunt's seafood dip, but now all I could merit was a groan and a chuckle.  For $24.95, I expected prawns for goodness sake.\n\nI assumed the crab meat was harvested from a local dungeness, but after seeing the shrimp, who knows.  All I can say is I was hungry.  Everything seemed fresh, veggies crunchy so it satisfied my appetitie.  I'm not sure I would proclaim the dressing \"house made\" as it resembled and tasted like my mom's quick Thousand Island dressing sans the pickle relish. \n\nFish dish was alright, but nothing you would come back for.  Atmosphere, service, house wine prices were decent.  Food, an afterthought.  No I would not come back.  Next time I will hail a cab.", "author": "Regina S."}

After wandering the wharf, we popped in and sat in their bar to review the menu and decide if we wanted to eat dinner. A drunk man that seemed to be regular chatted with the female bartender while we awaited service for 5-minutes.  The bartender then walked away and we were left to engage with the friendly yet annoying ol' drunk fella. To escape we decided to move to the dining room and eat. We got seated quickly, but  waited another 5-minutes  for a server, she gruffly (and I'm being nice)  took our drink orders and then we began to reconsider ordering any food as the service was so poor. \n\nWe asked for a few minutes to decide and were promptly told the rules that if we did not order we had to take our drinks and move...  She actually pointed at the menu to show us the rules... This was a 20-table fish restaurant, the pressure was odd. Her manager/host was a friendly younger man that supported her completely without taking the time to address us and our issues. There were many open tables, so they were rude for no reason and lost our business.  I found a highly rated restaurant nearby on Yelp named Scoma's where we had a great meal and good time. \n\nJust because it's a tourist area, you don't get to offer poor service.

The last three times I have visited I make sure to visit this restaurant, near the wharf, to sit at the bar and have my last (and best) San Francisco meal.  And it must involve Dungeness crab.  The past two times I ordered my martini (whatever kind they make me it really is a good, professionally made martini) and a crab sandwich.  This past time, I went for something different, a crab salad, with double crab meat.  I started with a special martini that the bartender Paul, made just for me and met the lovely manager, Fetenzo (sp?) who is from Sicily and just the nicest person, next to Paul the bartender, in all of San Fran.  I told them my story about how consistent this place is with their fresh crab and thus must be my last meal every time I visit their lovely city.  The manager went into the details of how they make sure it is fresh.  The salad arrived.  It was perfect.  And Paul didn't even think it was weird that I asked for drawn butter too!  So I ate half with Louie dressing (which tasted totally homemade and yummy) and the rest with butter.  I loved how they talked about this restaurant and it's owner who I believe they said her name was Nancy and how it is really a family run restaurant.  No corporations involved!  The decor is old school, and don't be frightened off that it isn't going to be good because it is near the cheesy Fisherman's Wharf.

The manager was unprofessional too and rudely questioned why we were unsatisfied.  I explained that the Alfredo was really oily and the spaghetti noodles were under cooked. The manager argued that they make the Alfredo with butter and it's just fine. It was $100 for the two of us to eat here.  Save yourself time and money and eat somewhere else classier.

We love Fisherman's Wharf and stopped in to Pompei's Grotto.  The food and service was great!  Very fresh food, and a good selection of seafood.\n\nI had the grilled shrimp and scallops, and my wife had the Fisherman's Stew.  We also had the Clam Chowder for an appetizer; we have been sampling all the chowder we could during our west coast road trip.  The food was very fresh, not spectacular, but very solid.  \n\nThis is a solid restaurant, with great service and good food.  A solid double up the middle, if you're a baseball fan.  However, the only thing I would mention is that the decor is a little tired and sleepy, and the food is a bit as well.  I can't 100% put my finger on it, but it's not fine dining.\n\nI'll close on this.  You're on Fisherman's Wharf so this place offers fresh seafood that tastes great, with an older more rustic feel.  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, but to put it up against fine dining in San Francisco would be disservice.  But if you can  drop your pretensions, and enjoy being on the Wharf in San Francisco where fresh seafood is the norm and is a rustic place with some history, this is a solid option.", "author": "John K."}

I was surprised at how many different scallop entrees they had (love love love scallops).  They were good, however lacking a punch that makes the dish special from many other I've tried.  Perhaps more garlic?  They may have been slightly overcooked than I usually perfer, but I'm really picky about my scallops.  The side of potatoes were a little too al dente.  My Dad ordered the seabass entree (they were out of swordfish).  I didn't get to taste it, but he seemed to enjoy the dish.

Yes, I was a tourist visiting SF and stayed in Fisherman's Wharf, Pompei's Grotto was in walking distance from our hotel.  It's very quaint, not a lot of hoopla, which was appreciated after a day of traveling.  \n\nRight away, the waitress was sweet and wonderful.  She made suggestions not only for what to eat, but also where to go in the city during our vacation.  She even gave us a guide book and mapped out different routes for us.  In fact, she was probably one of the best waitresses I've ever had and also I think probably the best waitress at Pompei's.  If you go, ask for Traci.  Out of all the places we ate on the wharf, this was the most enjoyable.  It wasn't overrun with kids and large families, just a cute and relaxing environment.  I only went for lunch and was told that it is busiest at night.  \n\nNow, the food.  I actually ate there twice on my visit, that's how much I liked it.  The Gamberetti Pasta is delish- rock shrimp, tomatoes, garlic, basil, and cream sauce all tossed with fettuccine.  The Crabjacks are a unique twist on a grilled cheese, it's crab salad and cheese melted between sourdough bead. They also have Bouillabaisse, which is a whole lot of seafood mixed together in a tomato broth with green peppers and onions. \n\nBasically, everything was so tasty that we had to go back a second time!

As eating out in Japan at nicer restaurants can be absurdly expensive and is usually a luxury left to up to parents to treat their children too, my friend decided she wanted to eat crab and have ambience while she could. We wandered the wharf in search of a place that did not fit the category of \"crab shack\" without breaking the bank too badly - and the three of us stumbled across Pompei's Grotto.\n\nLet's just say that everyone was overly, absurdly nice and considerate to us. Not that we're young, but I'd say out of all the older more affluent tourists, we probably had the best service imaginable. Our hostess was amazing - sweet and escorted us to the bar. The bartendresses both doted upon us when only one as necessary to help us. When our table was ready after a short 15 minute wait, the hostess came over to grab us and offered us a tray to carry our drinks so my friends could manage their bags and heavy coats (we refused, but couldn't believe she went to that extent of effort).  \n\nWe ended up adding a fourth friend at last minute, which they swiftly set a place for at our table. Our waiter was swift and attentive, several of the staff helped out in small ways like picking up my friend's hat the fell on the floor as she went to go grab it. While my choice ( I don't eat seafood, so my food review will not be a selling point! ) of manicotti wasn't anywhere near amazing, the crab sampler and scallop tortellini I was told was very tasty.

This place would have gotten 5 stars if it was just based off the food but the service and atmosphere was so atrocious (on our anniversary night no less) that I had to downgrade it severely. It was a long wait but because we were on fisherman's wharf, kinda goes with the territory, however there was only one small bench and hardly any standing room while you waited and about 4 groups were waiting at all times with no offer to go to the bar while we waited. Plus, constantly being bumped by the staff and other guests made the wait seem longer. Finally got a table after roughly a half hour wait and the blonde server was completely frazzled, confused and rude. In the middle of our wine bottle order, she yelled at us to hold on and she would be back which she did finally come back several minutes later still looking disheveled and not remembering our order. I thought if I mentioned it was our anniversary that maybe she would have realized it was an important night for us but she didn't seem to hear me and definitely didn't acknowledge it. She took our appetizer order and said she would be back for the rest of our order later. The appetizer was a crab sampler with a crab cake, crab bruschetta and crab legs and it was tasty and well made. But she never came back to take our main course order. We finished our appetizer and two glasses of wine each as we watched her frantically move around her side of the room but accomplishing very little. I finally had to say as she bumped my chair from behind that she still needed to take our order for the rest of our anniversary meal, thinking that mentioning it again she might do a better job finally. She didn't. Instead, she took our order in a huff with no apology. We both had the fish and chips (on recommendation from previously mentioned friend) which although doesn't sound like I high dollar item it did run $17.95 per meal. The breaded cod was crispy and not fishy and the fries were adequate but quite frankly the dinner had been ruined by our servers appalling behaviour. I kept wishing we had the other brunette server who was working our area as she was doing an excellent job. At the very end of the meal, I think our server tried to do damage control before bringing the check as she brought a small scoop of vanilla ice cream with a candle in it. Honestly, I was so irritated by then I didn't care what she did to get a better tip. It was very apparent why she changed on a dime 5 minutes before she brought us the almost $100 bill. I understand that severs can have an off-day but this was way beyond that. Even my husband who is pretty patient man was appalled at her lack of ability to do her job.", "author": "Jenna C."}

My friends got the linguine and clams and the salmon pasta special--both looked good and the plates were empty at the end of the meal.\nService: Not amazing, but not bad. Pretty average.\nAtmosphere: We loved the little porthole windows. No worries though, the sea theme is nowhere near tacky/overdone.\nPrices: Pretty good for the touristy location.

The chowder is BOMB... super creamy and the ingredients are so fresh you can feel the crunch of every bite of celery and the clam was delicious!  The crab sandwich on the other hand probably wasn't worth what it cost.  It was really dry even though the crab salad was probably pouring with mayonnaise.  The only other thing inside the sandwich was a big piece of lettuce.  I would've at least expected a tomato or something.

Apparently, quite a few ways. \n\nI've been to places before where the service has been bad, or the food was questionable, or the server has been rude; and, I've almost always excused the situation as an isolated problem, that the establishment might deserve a second chance.\n\nWell, Pompei's Grotto is never going to get that second chance. From the moment we walked in the door, until the moment we left, Pompei's Grotto exhibited all of the worst qualities a restaurant could ever have.\n\nI'll break it down into four categories, (1) the time before our order was taken, (2) the time between our order being taken and the service of our food, (3) the time during our dining, and (4) the rest.\n\n(1) Before our orders were taken. \n\nWe made reservations for 10 through OpenTable.com for last night. The very first contact we had with the staff was with the server that we would come to dread for the rest of the night. He immediately latched his arm around the shoulders of my cousin, told us that it would be another 10 to 15 minutes before our table would be ready, and that we should go wait outside WHILE she stays with him! That was uncomfortable and creepy. And if we had known better, we would have left. But, we didn't.\n\nThe table was set for 8. They had to find another table to make room for the rest of the party. Umm, you had the reservations a day in advance, what the hell? \n\n(2) The time between our order being taken and service of our food.\n\nCreepy guy came to take our orders, started at one end of the table and, at one point, stopped at one of the guests who wasn't ready to order. He just stood there staring at him, even after the guest said \"skip me, I'm not ready\". I swear, he did not move until our guest finally just chose a dish to get away from creepy man. When he got to me, I ordered half of a crab. He says back to me, \"a whole crab?\" \"No, half of a crab!\" I know, none of this sound significant. It will later. \n\nA couple in our group came late. Creepy guy approached the woman (she's in her mid 20's, he's in his mid 50'), bent down around her so he was right in her face, asked her if she wanted something to drink. When she replied, \"no thank you, I'm fine\", he said (I swear this is exactly what he said), \"yes you are\". Ohmigod!\n\n(3) - The food.\n\nRemember, I said something would be significant later, well here is why. Creepy guy came to serve our food, two dishes at a time. The first two dishes he brought out where some steak and crab combo. Apparently, they were for the two people who ordered first, who ordered (1) a steak, and only a steak, (2) prawns, no steak or crab. The first person didn't care, crab with the steak, just a bonus, so what. The second person did care. She started to protest that this was the wrong dish. He insisted that she had said \"I want the same as him\". Eventually, she caved in and told him, \"I guess you're right, I must have ordered this.\" \n\nPlates number 3 and 4 came out. Here we go again. Wrong dishes to the wrong people, and creepy guy insisting that he's right. As it turns out, he had just confused the name of the dishes, thought \"oranges\" were \"bananas\" and \"bananas\" were \"oranges\". Nothing we couldn't rectify after he left.\n\nMy half a crab. Okay, I see three legs and a claw. Good, we're on the right track. And a quarter of a body, not half a crab body, a quarter. I felt a little insulted about the crab order. Then I tasted it. Let me qualify one thing before I make my statement. I am a born and raised San Franciscan. And, if there's one thing San Franciscans know, it's dungeness crab, and how to cook it. This was the worst tasting, over cooked, cross contaminated with fish tasting, and poorest example of how to crack crab that I've ever had. Without exception, the worst!\n\n(4) - The rest.\n\nHow could we make this meal any worse? By completely insulting the person paying for it, of course. So, the bill comes, we pay in cash, and creepy guy picks up the money. He then proclaims, loudly, \"we don't take cash here\". Whatever. Then, he holds up our one hundred dollar bill, right in front of us, in the middle of the restaurant, and examines it. Not just briefly, but long enough for him to turn around in the light for the whole damn restaurant to see what he's doing!\n\nThat was the absolute, ultimate, most humiliatiing end for the worse meal that I have ever had, in my life! The worst!\n\nNo stars for you, Pompei's Grotto.", "author": "Jonathan P."}

My fish was not fab, ok, but it's the little things that really annoyed me. It's because it's little things that are easy to fix. For example, if you have a big dish with just ok fish, dress it up....put more than 1 sad potato on the plate. \n\nMaybe I'm just spoiled. I've been eating in SF for 12 years and mostly avoided the touristy palces. \n\nThe bottom line is if you are stuck on the Wharf there are better places to go for seafood.

I want to go to Fisherman's Wharf!\" Originally I wanted an In&Out Burger, but he didn't want a burger. We decided to walk past every rest-o-rant from Pompei's to Scoma's to those that line the wharf itself, and choose based on the price for Fish & Chips. Pompei's wasn't the cheapest of the lot, but it was the only one that came with veggies. Most of the other places were too loud, too crowded, or both. Pompei's had their Sinatra/Ella/Italian Opera Faves CD turned a bit too high, but it went well with the red check table mafioso decor and the porthole windows. It wasn't crowded and the lighting and mood were pleasant.\n\nNow, If you want a fancy italian dinner, or a fancy seafood dinner, this is NOT the place to come. There are a great number of restaurants in this City that serve fish in ways that are like little bits of heaven on your tongue. You do not go to a restaurant on the wharf and expect anything other than a tourist experience. \n\nI got just what I wanted, a touristy experience and touristy food. I was surrounded by tourists. This was, as I might have mentioned, what I was looking for. My Fish was thickly battered and crunchy on the outside, flakey in the middle and my fries were the same. My budweiser was cold and delicious, just like it should be. \n\nTo the preceding disappointed user, I will say that I just can't bring myself to use open table for reservations. I have been tempted by the convenience but there are some things that are best done by communicating with a human being. Restaurant reservations are one of them. Most especially for large parties. It is perhaps your only opportunity to sound out the staff and get a feel for what you might find when you arrive with high hopes, primed for an easy and rapid (rabid) disappointment.", "author": "Gus J."}

Sadly that was not the case last time.  We (3) went on a week night in late December '08 for dinner and I WILL NOT EVER go back.  My two stars take prior experiences here into account.  Based on my last visit it should have been 1 star at best.  Read on if you want to know why I say avoid this place at all costs.\n\nWe were greated and seated quickly enough, that's the last good thing that happened.  \n\nThe service was unbelievably bad.  In hind-site I wish I would have walked out, but I never do.  The waiter was so snide and condisending I was honestly in shock.  When he came to take my order I said we just wanted a quick bite and would have a bread-bowl of chowder and a seasonal dungeones-crab appitizer.  The waiter openly scowled and said, with a raised eyebrow, \"Is that all?\"  I tried to be polite and said yes.  \n\nAs I waited another waiter cleared the plates from a nearby table and asked if they would like anythiing else, the customer said, \"No thanks, just the check.\"  The waiter replied, \"Oh, sure thing, thanks SO much for reminding me.\"  He then walked away rolling his eyes and openly gasping.  So help me I wish I was making this all up.  The customer was clearly offended by the waiters snotty attitude.\n\nOur food arrived... sort of.  The appitizer came out and the waiter informed me they were out of bread bowls. (How is it he didn't know this before bringing us the appatizer?  Was this a trick get us to stay?  I'm pretty sure it was.)  He then offered to bring  the soup \"...in some cups or something.\"  We decided to stay and have the appatizer, big mistake.  The crab cake had NO lump crab in it and tasted heavily of mayo.  Mind you this is the height of dungeones crab season and you're not serving lump crab?  The half of a cracked-crab portion of the appatizer was TINY... this might have been the smallest dungenous crabs I've ever seen.  The bruscetta was Ho-Hum at best... again no lump crab.  Really average to poor food.\n\nThe server brought the check flopped it down, and snidely commented, \"All Full?\" when he took the plate.  We paid the outrageous $25 dollar bill and left.  As the waiter cleared our plates, we each said thank you as he took them.  No reply from him, obviously, he was deeply offended by our only ordering an appatizer.  I've been a server, and the kind of attitude this guy was dishing out is totally out of line.  I always tip, and I always try to be polite because I know how tough it can be... these guys were out-of-line.   Again, we ordered 1 appitizer and 2 sodas.  That's all, and it was $23 and change without a tip... for the record, I still left him the change, but I'm sure he just chalked it up to me being cheap.\n\nYou can get a bread bowl and whole fresh steamed crab for less from the row of vendors just down the peir.\n\nNeedless to say, snotty waiters and high priced mediocer food deserve much lower than a 2.

When I was walking down Jefferson this evening I was struck by the fact that I couldn't remember the last time I had walked down the street. For a lot of people who come to visit San Francisco, Fisherman's Wharf is no doubt a quintessential part of SF - not so far as I am concerned!\n\nStill, we came here on this night because my mom was nostalgic. She wasn't born in the city, and moved here in the 60s. Sometimes she and her friends at work downtown would hop in a cab and come down here for dinner, and she wanted to experience the nostalgia once more. I relented and decided to allow myself to be subjected to the tourist nightmare that is Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nAnd yet, the dinner really wasn't that bad at all! Service was a bit iffy, with some spilled cocktails and over-burdened waiters, but the food was pretty good and the experience not too shabby. I had a bowl of Boston clam chowder that was perfectly satisfactory (not special, but very competent) and then a pasta dish with some yummy, sweet shrimp. It was heavy on the alfredo sauce, but not a big deal. My mother, meanwhile, went all out and got a massive pot of crab legs which she happily cracked and devoured with her hands. What can I say?\n\nYou must be at peace with the notion that you are in enemy territory when you come down here, and your guard needs to be up. But actually, the restaurant was really not bad at all. They had my whiskey (Wild Turkey). They served up an Anchor Steam in a frosted mug. They brought out a basket of good sourdough bread. It wasn't even ALL that expensive for a tourist trap!

It is not bland. It tastes like fresh fish. This is not emerging trend OMG trendy-shemdy asian fusion cusine. The plump, fresh prawns with linguini were very good. The sea bass was some of the best I have ever had. The simple veggies and potatoes were fresh and cooked just right. The traditional ungarnished spumoni was good sized, creamy and delicious just like I expected. The atmosphere is definitely on the casual end of fish houses. I prefer more formal like Scomas. But again, know where you are. The decor could be freshened up just a little. But I expect wood paneling in a San Francisco fish house. The building is lacking a view.  This is fresh fish from the bay, then cooked.", "author": "Peter C."}

My family and i were tired after walking, sight seeing and also returning from the Alcatraz tour and we were famished. The one thing I had been craving since my last San Francisco trip was a crab Cesar salad. I don't know why a lot of restaurants do not serve this anymore. The one restaurant I enjoy this salad with was in the financial district and my party wanted to eat now. Meaning on Fisherman's Wharf. So I yelped crab Cesar salad and Pompei's Grotto came up. We had a lovely waitress who explained the lunch soup/salad combo could not be modified, even with an up charge to a crab Cesar salad. That they no longer have crab Cesar salad on the menu. A little frustrated, I said I would have to look on the menu again to see what I could order. I vented a bit to my mom and aunt that the one thing I wanted before we left was a crab Cesar salad. Not knowing our waitress asked the chef and she came back and said they would make it and at no extra charge. Delighted I had a great crab Cesar salad and all of us agreed the best clam chowder we had tasted on the wharf, based on three other restaurants. We will definitely visit again when in town and recommend. Thanks for the great service!", "author": "Marisa M."}

Crab Louie was excellent with good portions of crab, egg, and a wonderful Louie dressing.  Did the fried calamari as well which was light and not fishy or greasy.

Prices are fair for SF and the Wharf and the quality of the food, cleanliness of the restaurant and friendliness of the staff make it worth the price.  SF is a great dining town.

We stopped by a few restaurants looking at the menu knowing the price and the quality of food will be roughly the same for a tourist area like the Wharf. So, eventually I ended our perpetual hunt (my friends would carry on walking, believe me!) and said, \"I like the menu here.\" (I were not lying!) My order was the lunch specials, which was what they put on the blackboard outside of the restaurant that got my attention. Lunch specials comes with a cup of chowder or salad at $12.95.  Needless to say I went for the chowder, then I had linguine and clamps in white sauce.  I love the taste of chowder but there's not enough clamps in it. (that brings back fond memory in Scoma's just over a couple of months ago, when I first started yelping lol.....) As for the main dish, I like the presentation and the portion. It's not huge like most places and it didn't feel like a struggle to finish it.  The only thing is I cannot make out if I like the sauce. It tastes somewhat garlic and butter? The linguine was cooked to the right texture which I like very much; the clamps were certainly very fresh; they were so fresh that two of them gave me a mouthful of sands I had to rinse my mouth to get them out! Thank goodness of the bowl I were given for the shell earlier because it certainly saved me from running to the bathroom twice to wash out the sands in my mouth!!  My friends and I then proceed to have a conversation of how one should clean their clamps before cooking them and the various methods of preparing clamps!  \n\nThis is an average type of restaurant with average type of service and with an average type of flavour in the dish. My friends had chicken and portabello mushrooms risotto and they said it's tasty and they love it. We also agreed the sourdough is more sour than any sourdough we've eaten! Maybe it tastes more sour when it's not warm?   \n\nI would have given a 3 star if they washed the clamps properly. (my friends accused them of not being washed at all!)", "author": "Bella A."}

We arrived at about 7 PM, and we were seated right away at a nice indoor table.  We ordered a Caesar salad to share. The lettuce was fresh, and the croutons were crisp, but the dressing lacked flavor, and there was not much parmesan in the salad. It was way too bland for my taste. We also ordered the crab trio appetizer to share. The bruschetta  had lots of punch. The crab cakes were well done, and the meat in the crab legs was fresh and sweet.. The appetizer was the high point of the meal. I ordered breaded, deep fried shrimp for my entree. The breading was not as crunchy as I would have liked and not seasoned well, and the shrimp had a funny taste. Perhaps it was not fresh. I have had better breaded shrimp at Denny's. It was a bit of a surprise to see french fries on my plate, as the menu had indicated that the fish would be served with a different kind of potatoes. As it turned out, the fries were better than the shrimp. This place has a very nice atmosphere with its red and white checked table cloths, real linen napkins, wood paneling, port hole windows and soft lighting. Our waitress was attentive and checked back with us frequently. The food came out of the kitchen in a timely fashion. I'd give Pompei's a 2 for overall food quality, even though it deserves a 4 for service and ambiance.

I had the sautee shrimp that were pretty good actually. The soup that came with it was clam chowder. It was also acceptable. Not the best but it didn't smell like dead fish. Everything in the joint came with pasta. So why isn't it any good? My friend had the salmon. It looked more like chicken fingers? Three little planks that were a bit over cooked even from my side of the table. And what's with the pea's. I can't remember the last time somebody tried pushing green prune's on me. The service was very fast and friendly, again. Next time I see a cruise ship I will head for the hills.", "author": "Steven M."}

I've been here on a sweltering hot day, in the bar swigging down an icy cold beer with their mussels in a butter, garlic, and wine sauce (gotta sop up the sauce with the sourdough bread!) The mussels were so big and tender, not chewy. I've been for lunch and dinner a few times. The hot crab sandwich is rich, but crazy good! The cold one isn't as flavorful. Pretty standard fish and chips. Clam chowder is satisfying.", "author": "foxy b."}

The meal with a half bottle wine (wine had a screw top no cork) was $60. Too much for an average meal.

I'd been here once before when I decided to hit up local tourist spots throughout San Francisco, but it had been awhile.  Though it wasn't the best seafood I've ever had, I have to say it did the trick!  We were seated immediately and, since we all wanted the same thing, were served very quickly -- which definitely added to the experience!  The clam chowder was good, but what made me really happy was that it was served in a bread bowl (which for me is the best way to eat clam chowder).  There's a nice, local feel to the place and the outdoor seating is excellent for people watching.  For what you get the food is reasonably priced, and overall I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the entire dining experience.

The food is always fresh and delicious.  I recently spent 11 days in SF and ate at Pompei's on all but the couple of days when I took 1 day trips out of town.  This is my usual pattern and I go to SF 2 to 3 times a year for a week or more.  The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable.  The clam chowder has always been velvety smooth and full of fresh clams with just a subtle taste of leek which makes it special.  I would rate it as 1 of about 2 or 3 of the best chowders I've ever had anywhere and I go to New England a lot.  My top favorite is the sand dabs in white wine garlic sauce.  They are the best I've ever had any where.  My next favorite is the crab cakes as a dinner entree--it's not on the menu but you can ask for it.  I've tried all the restaurants around Fisherman's Wharf and several seasfood restaurants in the financial district and this is by far the best food and also the most reasonably priced.  It's one of my favorite restaurants in the country.  I love the chewy Italian sourdough bread.   The owner is a super nice lady.", "author": "Paul S B."}

This has been a long time favorite spot for my parents when they are in town visiting... Not any more. We were seated at the tables out front, and were not served or brought menus for well over 15 minutes, at which point my little brother went inside and asked for service. The host then brought us water and menus and it was another 5-10 minutes before the waiter finally showed up. At that point we ordered a round of drinks and 2 orders of bruchetta - to which the waiter replied that there was a $15 minimum per person. 1) we had already been there nearly 30 minutes without being served; 2) it was 230 or 3 pm - not lunch or dinner rush - they were not crowded; 3) 5 drinks and 2 apps put us around $10 each; and 4) who is to say that we wouldn't have ordered another round?! Nevertheless, because we weren't ordering full meals we were denied service. Needless to say, we will never, ever dine there again.

We had such a lovely day on the wharf with out of town friends who had never been to SF and thought, this place looks reasonable, pretty crowded, let's eat here.  What a mistake.  Maybe it was the cook that was on that night?  Maybe I expect better fish/seafood in SF?  The reviews on here are pretty mixed...........  I ordered the grilled sea scallops (aren't they supposed to be bigger than bay scallops???!!!) and giants prawns for $19.95.  Now I don't mind getting 3 of each for that price if it was GOOD.  It wasn't, the scallops had absolutely NO flavor whatsover; the shrimp, eh.  They came with a measly little white skinned potato, alas, no seasoning on it either, and some really overcooked, mushy halved zucchini.  Now doesn't that sound appetizing??  My other half ordered the fish and chips, again, figured we're on the wharf, should be \"fresh\".  I think Gorton's in the freezer section are MUCH better.  DRY and I swear they had been sitting there since the day before.  AWFUL.  Pretty much inedible actually.  What a disappointment.  Fortunately, the guests ordered non-seafood/fish items, which I guess were ok for their taste buds.  Won't ever go back to this place!", "author": "Deb U."}
