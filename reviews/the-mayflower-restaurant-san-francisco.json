According to the owner, this restaurant has been here around over 30 years. It was run by a Vietnamese family then he took over. Changed to a Vietnamese-American style. \nMy first time was 2 years ago when I first moved to the neighborhood. The order was lemongrass beef with imperial rolls and vermicelli noodles. Super tasty. The aunty was so friendly. She took the order and made my dish within 15 mins.\n\nMy second time was with a friend, I ordered the rice combo. Not so tasty. The service was great.\n\nThis time, I decided to taste their infamous blueberry pancakes. As the rumor has it, super soft! Delicious!! You can taste the hot and soft pancakes slowly melt in your mouth then spike up the favor with a pop of sweetness from blueberries. I was hooked. This will be my forever breakfast place. Their fresh squeezed orange juice was refreshing.\nSuch a great gem to be kept", "author": "Bao V."}

I always order the French toast, bacon, and eggs plus my Vietnamese coffee. I highly recommend this place for the tasty French toast and the diner feel to the place. They've never remodeled and it isn't necessary. This place is fairly priced for the meals and a small business!

This is a family-run diner that has a menu of American brunch food as well as Vietnamese cuisine. I got the french toast to share with friends and a imperial roll/BBQ pork combo for myself. The French toast came with slices of butter on the side and was dusted with powdered sugar. It was simply scrumptious. The BBQ pork was great but the imperial rolls were only so-so. I think this place is better for the brunch food rather than the Vietnamese food even though the owners are Vietnamese. The pho bowls are kind of small and I think it's one size available only.\n\nThey close at 4pm so no dinner service. They accept cards and would do split checks but we didn't want to make them run several credit cards to incur whatever credit card fees there are so we only did it on one card.", "author": "Diana C."}

Try to imagine a imagine a musty Mel's Diner mixed with a Vietnamese restaurant. It was a bit weird seeing Asian ladies make burgers......\n     Upon first walking in, I wasn't really sure about this place because 1) It was kind of musty inside, and 2) there was only one other group eating there. That was explainable, however, because we went there at 2:30 and that's an off hour for eating. They took our orders really quick and brought out the food quickly too (because we were the only ones they needed to serve). Anyway, the imperial rolls were 6/10, not as flavorful or crunchy as some other ones I've eaten. The pho was pretty good, probably 8/10. \n     The best part was seeing them make the orange juice. The have fresh oranges, and the juice them into a glass right in front of you. That's how you know it's fresh. Overall, good service and pretty good food too.", "author": "Bob J."}

I threw up on pavement on Ocean Avenue (near Franciscan Hobbies) Sorry folks at FH, nothing against you!   Plus I felt very weak. I almost was very close to calling for ambulance!  But I managed to get Muni home instead.\n\nAfter half hour of being back home, I suddenly had to literally drop everything and had to make SPRINT to bathroom, this was bowel EMERGENCY!  I had such explosive (non-bloody thank goodness!) diarrhoea that wound up being unrelenting and persistent day and night for full week!  That along with intestinal pain, cramping (and noise), bloating and gas. Plus I was malaise and fatigued from 24/7 need of toilet.  I was one sorry mess!\n\nThis was so bad I wound up having one massive unexpected bowel accident at home on kitchen floor (as I went in for replenishing fluids such as orange juice).  \n\nThis must be one of worst cases (if not worst ever) of food poisoning I ever have had in my life!  Again, I was so close to contacting 911, but still somehow resisted (for fear of embarrassment and high cost of ambulance ride) I finally -- to my total amazement -- make full (?) recovery.\n\nNEVER, NEVER.

In addition, since they serve brunch, lunch and Vietnamese food, it is a crowd pleaser.  Everyone can find something they will like.  Best of all, even at the peak of Sunday brunch time, I have never had to wait for a table.  \n\nI enjoy that they ask how you would like your bacon cooked.  Their Vietnamese coffee is strong and flavorful like it should be.  The eggs Benedict was surprisingly good.  The pancakes are fluffy and don't taste like a mix.  The Pho and vermicelli are both decent.  Who doesn't want a side of lemongrass chicken with their bacon and eggs.  \n\nI highly recommend this place, especially for the price and not having to wait for a table.", "author": "D M."}

One of the things I really craved was French Toast for breakfast, they just don't do it right in the UK.  So I looked around the neighborhood and found this little gem. I read it had american breakfast food, but when I walked in and saw it was Vietnamese I was a bit confused.  Then I realised it is great for BOTH!  \n\nOk, so it is a bit dark and not perhaps as clean as it could be but the food makes up for it in my opinion.  I've always been experimental when it comes to food and when I saw you could order lemon grass chicken AND french toast together, I had to give it a go.  Both were delicious!  And some of the best Vietnamese coffee I have ever experienced.  \n\nI have since been back for ph\u00f2 and it was fantastic. They give you everything you need to spice up your ph\u00f2 how YOU like it and the broth was so lovely.  Definitely a place I will frequent.  Just don't let the interior appearance deter you.", "author": "Brenda M."}

It has a 1960s look with wood paneling and a ship design (presumably the Mayflower). The booths have 1950s formica tables that are clean.  There are stools on the side for those that prefer eating at the counter.  The holdover decorations include pictures of Becks, Coors, and Stroh beer, even though beer was not offered on the menu.  It was quiet without the pounding music that many restaurants now employ.\n\nThe restaurant serves traditional American breakfast and lunch along with Vietnamese dishes.  It is open every day, except Monday, from 8:30 AM until 4:30 PM. Our waitress was a charming Vietnamese woman who provided good service.\n\nSince reviewers remarked on the french toast, we both order french toast ($5.25) and french toast with eggs, and pork chop ($8.75).  The chop was pretty tiny and had a hoisin sauce taste.  The french toast was very good. The coffee was $1.50/ea and looked rich and dark, but according to my companion tasted like dishwater.  \n\nThere is nothing really special about this place though it , though it was clean and comfortable.  I may try the Vietnamese dishes next time.  .", "author": "Robert J."}

Other than that, The eggs benedict hollandaise sauce was sour, the pho broth was not cooked long enough, and the hash browns were soggy. To top it all off, I ordered a pork chop and rice to go, and to my surprise, they gave me one little chop, what looked like a head of lettuce and enough rice to fill a family sized rice cooker. \n\nWhen finished with my food at the restaurant, the lady walked over with my bill with her iPhone still in her hand laughing her ass off with her friend on the other line and tossed it on my table.

They also have burgers and sandwiches here.\n\nAs I skimmed through their menu....I KNEW IT!!! THEY DO HAVE FRIED CHICKEN HERE!!!  I needed my fried chicken fix for the week. The last time I had fried chicken was about 2 weeks ago at Farmer Brown.  I was starting to go through fried chicken withdrawal.

It probably would have tasted better. The fried chicken was actually pretty good. It reminded me of chicken that your mom or someone else's mom would make. It was quite tasty and very flavorful. If you're expecting it to taste like FarmerBrown, Hard Knox, or Front Porch's fried chicken....you'll be disappointed. Cause it taste nothing like their fried chicken. Like I said, it taste like something your mom would make at home.\n\nI'm usually here at least once a week with my boyfriend. The ladies here are super nice and they always remember how I like my eggs and bacon cooked. Not sure if I'll ever order their fried chicken again, but I'll be back for their breakfast in a week or two. Thank god I live close by. \n\nThe fried chicken was more like a 3.

The food was okay, but not stupendous, and the same goes for the staff who seemed bored and while not unfriendly, rather resigned to their fate as restaurant workers. I have yet to try the Vietnamese food here, but they do stock a good breakfast variety, which was perfectly adequate fare, and filling. The prices likewise are perfectly reasonable, which is good.\n\nHonestly, this has the potential to be a really cool place. As of right now, it's just dull. The whole place is dark, and everything from the walls to the chairs are just brown and boring. The only sign of 'life' was children's drawings that had been taped up on one of the walls. Otherwise things were bland and uninteresting which just set the mood for the whole meal; the mood being \"meh.\" There was a TV playing an infomercial in the background, and even that just seemed muted and dull. This restaurant has been around since the 70's I think, and I don't think any sort of redecorating has happened since. It's dark, and quiet (quiet in a bad way, rather than good, unfortunately) and just needs to be revamped.\n\nAlso, the menu was a little unorganized, and like the rest of the establishment, could do with a little sprucing up. This is a cute place close to City College and could be an awesome place if someone would just get in there and make it happen. I feel almost bad giving it only two stars, because its got so much potential, but as of right now, it's nothing special.\n\n(also, parking is a pain on Ocean Avenue, be advised)", "author": "Betsy W."}

I am surrounded by the reviews that make me realize that Yelp is not yet the perfect site I always wish that it is. \n\n5 stars for this restaurant is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nDisclaimer: I had the \"American Breakfast\" so no Vietnamese food review here. \n\nThe Good: The french toast is good. But that is all. Best in the city?? That is just ridiculous. Reasonably priced. Service was friendly and great. What else???? Ok that is all. \n\nThe Bad: Sausage was way overcooked...at least I think that was sausage inside the crusty charred exterior. The hash browns were undercooked, and both looked suspiciously like something I would find in the frozen food section of my local discount grocery store. My scrambled eggs were hard on the outside and runny in the middle...odd and disappointing for scrambled eggs. The actual restaurant was leaning dangerously close to dirty and rundown instead of the \"cute mom and pop place\" I expected from the other reviews. \n\nPlease understand this review was based on one single dish, but I won't be going back. \n\nTwo stars = Friendly and nice and ok French Toast.", "author": "Keith J."}

I haven't been there in a couple of months but my memory is that for eggs (any style you want), bacon, sausace, 4 french toasts and a side of hashed browns is total $12 including tip.  Very reasonable for a hearty breakfast!\n\nThe restaurant has transferred owners one time since I've been there and its from one family to an inlaw family.  They've kept the menus, the recipes, the style of cooking but have added a Vietnamese menu over the years.  All the locals come here and you start to recognize faces after a few visits.\n\nThe interior decorations aren't the most appealing.  It's dark and the tables/benches probably haven't been replaced since the restaurant started... the place could definitely use some updating.
