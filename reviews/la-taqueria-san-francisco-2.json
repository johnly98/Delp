Ive actually heard of this place from bringme a while back and finally thought about coming here on a Sunday around noon, and I just knew it would be crowded. When I got here around 12:30pm, yup. The line formed to outside the building. Thank goodness I ordered to go. And let me tell you guys... to go, the food was still delicious!! It makes me want to try this place out while it's fresh.\n\nWe got the super carne asada burrito el dorado style (super came with cheese, sour cream and guac-which made it so much better). The burrito wasn't super large and probably would be able to finish it in one sitting. But I split half with my bf and got an additional 2 carne asada tacos and 2 chicken tacos. Personally, I liked all the carne asada orders. The meat was Smokey and tender. It wasn't dry. In addition to that, they did not skimp out on the meat! The chicken on the other hand was a little dry. I think it was actually shredded chicken, and I was expecting diced chicken. I'm not a huge fan of shredded chicken because it's usually dry. But that's probably why I wasn't a big fan of the chicken tacos. \n\nIf you got the time to come and wait here, I suggest coming right when they open. If you don't want to wait, I suggest calling in to go. I live about 15 min away from here and came home with the burrito still warm. The tacos cooled down a bit, but I think my favorite was still the burrito.", "author": "Rosa N."}

After all, they are a James Beard award-winning establishment. Unfortunately, I can't agree that it was best. I thought it was alright. Above all, an overpriced and overrated tourist trap. I came here around 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon, with plenty of cash in hand, ready for a true mission style burrito. The line at first glance seemed like a deterrent, but it actually moves pretty quickly. I ordered a super carne asada burrito and a horchata. Really liked the horchata. Refreshing when you've been standing in line for a while and it gets quite hot inside.\n\nFinding a place to sit inside or outside was a matter of luck. Be prepared to swoop in like a hawk for an available table. We waited for our number to be called and for our drinks to be ready. Retrieving our order was a little confusing as it's so hectic inside, but it seemed like everything was correct. My friend had said that the burrito was \"wet\" and then I had told him that there's no rice in it. I would say if you want to eliminate some carbs and still get that burrito experience, this would be the place. Next time I'm in town, I'll opt for the less touristy, more reasonably priced mission-style burritos.", "author": "Augustina G."}

I've been wanting to come here for years, literally, but the lines were always insane at any time of day so we always said \"next time.\" We'll the time has come and boy do I have a review for you!\n\nI ordered the super burrito with carnitas el dorado style, because apparently that's the best way to eat this burrito according to all the fellow foodies. I was torn between carnitas and carne Asada but I'm glad I went with carnitas because it wasn't chewy, on the contrary he meat fell apart in your mouth. I find that with carne Asada yo always risk the meat being slightly bland or not seasoned enough but the carnitas has so much flavor because they soaked up the juice of the broth they had been soaking in. GO WITH CARNITAS! \n\nEl dorado style is a must. Not many other taquerias crisp up your burrito on the outside and I thought this was a great touch to add extra texture to your food. It really sets them apart from other Mexican food joints by focusing on this small detail.\n\nThe super burrito itself was so good! Not sure if it's worth waiting in like for 2 hours, but it was worth the 25 minutes I waited. They cake in the guac and the salsa is fresh and savory without being too spicy for those of you that aren't into spicy salsas. They add really fresh tasting beans and rice and everything is evenly distributed within the burrito, which is a big thing for me.\n\nLastly, we ordered true chips with salsa and guac. If you're debating whether to include the guac in this, JUST DO IT. They add a ton of guac to each order and it really gives the chips that extra creaminess and texture. I'm definitely coming back when the line isn't too crazy!", "author": "Alejandra A."}

Don't believe the hype!\n\nBeing an SF native, I've passed La Taqueria countless times over the years and l thought I was missing out on the \"best burrito\" in SF (at least). So this morning, after running some errands in the neighborhood, I headed to La Taqueria excited to finally try one of their famous burritos. \n\nThe Wait: It was 15 minutes to open time and there was already a line of people waiting. In addition to the hipsters taking selfies in front of the place, there were a few Latino folks waiting so I took that as a good sign. We ordered to-go vs sitting in the dining area which is cute, especially the patio outside. They have a great system and despite being about 15 people back from the front of the line, we ordered, paid and got our food fast.\n\nThe Burritos: I ORDERED a regular carnitas with refried beans. I GOT a watery, loosely wrapped burrito with carnitas and pinto beans (see pic). Ok, I can get past the wrong bean BUT Carnitas are usually super flavorful and my burrito was very bland, despite a lot of pico de gallo in there. I had to add a couple of shakes of Tapatio to every bite to amp up the flavor. My friend got a spicy super carne asada burrito. Immediately he called out the size as being more of a taquito than a burrito. Size-wise both regular and super looked the same. He also said flavor wasn't anything special either.\n\nSooo, back to our usual City spots where we don't have to wait in line with hipsters and tourists for tasty burritos that are better than those found at La Taqueria! \n\nThe silver lining: I popped into Dianda's next door and picked up some yummy pastries for later.", "author": "Gelsomina L."}

Many of the other posted reviews mention the burritos, but my vote goes with the tacos being the best of the two. The combination of one soft and one crispy tortilla surprisingly elevates the experience. They are so warm and so fresh. The fruit soda is also a must. I had no idea I was missing those in my life.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-06", "description": "*** Cash only ***\n\nESPN's FiveThirtyEight named La Taqueria super / super dorado carnitas burritos as the America's best burrito in 2014 (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-best-burrito/) and La Taqueria's carne asada tacos dorados was featured in Food Network's \"Top 5 Restaurants\" (https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/top-5-restaurants/episodes/best-tacos). La Taqueria started in March 1973 and this is an EXTREMELY popular taco restaurant. Our group came here at 1:45 PM and waited a total of 30 minutes (waited 15 minutes to pay at cashier counter and waited another 15 minutes to pick up our orders at the counter - talk about a total mad house). Tables are first come, first served and please pay extra attention when the staff call out ordering numbers.\n\nMenu: First of all there is a secret menu, which includes the dorado style (taco with two shells - one soft shell on the outside and one crunchy brown shell on the inside), sirloin ends (supposedly only available about once every one to two weeks), quesaritto (burrito dorado with three cheeses), combination of multiple meats for burrito / taco / quesadilla, chilies (serrano peppers; you can add directly to burrito / taco / quesadilla or ask as a side), and red sauce (aka salsa roja with tomatillos, arbol chilies, spices and garlic; spicier than green sauce). On the regular menu, there are six meat options (beef or carne asada, pork or carnitas, beef head or cabeza, beef tongue or lengua, sausage or chorizo, and chicken or pollo) in the form of taco, burrito, or quesadilla (vegetarian option is also available). You can pay extra $ to upgrade your item from regular to super (cheese + sour cream + avocado) and you also have to make decision on whether you want corn or flour tortilla. Lastly beverages include aguas frescas (strawberry, pineapple watermelon, cantalope, mango, horchata, jamaica aka hibiscus tea, and tamarindo) and beers.\n\n***\n\nHorchata (small, $3.50): Very refreshing and not too sweet - highly recommended.\n\nSuper carnitas taco (flour tortilla, $7) and super lengua taco (flour tortilla, $7): I didn't get the dorado style because I only heard about it after I had left. I get it - $7 taco isn't cheap and the \"super\" style made these taco REALLY messy, but man I would recommend the \"super\" style because it made these tacos tasted EXTRA good. Oh not to mention that these tacos also tasted juicy and not dry at all!\n\nSuper carne asada burrito (aka Mission-style burrito = burrito with no rice; $12.35): Carne asada was made from USDA choice top sirloin steak. I was extremely impressed with its crusty flour tortilla. The melted cheese simply took this burrito to the next level.\n\nGreen sauce (you'll find them on most tables): Not too memorable and tasted pretty mediocre.\n\n***\n\nOverall a 4.5-star taco restaurant (knocked a half-star down due to hefty prices, chaotic lines, and not enough tables), but you have to make sure to get the dorado style (must request to the staff), the super style, and rice-less Mission-style burrito in order to make your La Taqueria's experience complete. Without considering how much these tacos / burritos cost, La Taqueria is just as good as the best taco shops in Southern California.", "author": "Luke L."}

If you are begging for rice in your burrito or would rather have super processed sub par tex-max you can go somewhere else. It's hard to beat walking up to order and seeing the staff bring out fresh meat to grill and smashing batches of fresh guacamole in bowls as big as your torso while a James Beard Award hangs on the wall above you.\n\nI recommend ordering the chips and salsa or if you are a part of the 1%, the chips with salsa and guac to start. Both are super fresh and worth the extra few bucks. Afterwards, order the super burrito with steak and don't skimp for the regular burrito. If you do and are disappointed it is your own fault. Even if it is more expensive than an $8 burrito that is because it is a lot better than an $8 burrito. When the beans and guacamole mix it is magic. The tacos are also very good as well if you are really in the mood, but the staple for me at La Taqueria will always be the burrito.

I ordered a super veggie burrito, which was $7, and feels like a steal compared to the other super burritos at over $12.

We were lucky enough to find parking fairly close, so I felt this was a good sign.  The line was fairly long and snaked into the restaurant and in front of the counter.  I liked that there were two ladies taking your order, so all you had to do was give that to the cashier and wait again to hear your order number.  As we were almost about to pay, I gazed down to a mound of Carne Asada that the chef was slicing and dicing.  I felt an urge to reach-over the counter and take a sample, but I didn't want to lose a limb.  \n\nWe snagged a table outside, so we waited till our order was called.  As my Carne Asada Dorado burrito lay in front of me, I almost forgot to snap a pic of it.  The meat was really tender and juicy.  My tortilla had a hole in it, so I lost some of my meat, beans and pico de gallo, but have no fear, I scooped it all up and devoured it.  These burrito's don't come with rice, so I did notice the burrito was a bit wetter than others, but that didn't take away from how good it tasted.  After seeing that pile of Carne Asada earlier, I was so happy I didn't choose anything else.  \n\nYes, the wait is a drag, but I thought the line moved fairly well.  Most of the patrons seemed to know the routine and I was with Tiffz, who has been to La Taqeria multiple times.  It wasn't a large burrito, but I could have been hungry, since it was almost 1:30pm by the time we arrived.  I also wanted to save some room for ice cream that was our next stop.  I really enjoyed my Dorado burrito, since it added a nice crunch to the tortilla.  I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nIt's cash only and people do glare at you while you eat.

First off, it's Cash only, but there is an ATM in the building you can use while waiting in line if you never have cash like I do. \n\nI got the beef burrito. It was amazing. Be sure to add the green hot sauce they have on the tables - it makes it. I also had the chips and salsa and they were kinda awful. Unsalted chips with not great salsa. Stick to the main dishes here. \n\nThe cons: this place is widely popular and you as a customer will pay for it. Longgg lines (out the door when I went). Took maybe 15 mins to order. Not terrible. But then the wait for the food. It was about 30 minutes of standing room only as people came in and out to grab their food as their number was called. I had no where to be so I was fine with it, but just allow yourself enough time for this. \n\nThen if you are lucky enough to grab an open spot, you'll have people hovering over and bumping into you while you eat and they wait for their food. Basically I had a crowd watch as I pretty sloppily slammed the delicious burrito. Also they forgot my chips and I had to wait to get those before I left. It needs reorganized but it's one of those community staples that probably will never change because there's really no need for them to Bc people will still come. Gotta respect that. \n\nAnyway, it's great for food. Like really great. Try to go when it's not so packed (I went at 6:30pm on a Sunday), and it would be perfect. \n\nAll in all, this is a super authentic Mexican place with amazing staff.

They wrap around the inside of the venue so that you're hovering over people who are trying to enjoy their meals. I mean, if it feels awkward for me in line, imagine how uncomfortable it must be for those actually sitting there. If anything, you'll have worked up such an appetite by the time you get your food that just about anything will taste good.

The line was very, very, verrryyyyyyy long. But that wasn't enough to scare me away. I stood for a while, and finally, I was where they took your order. When I got my order receipt to turn in and got to the front to pay, I saw a \"CASH ONLY\" sign and was overcome with sadness because I only had card on me...I walked out disappointed, and as I crossed the street, I saw a Chase bank!! I immediately took $10 out and ran back to La Taqueria, turned in my order receipt, and eagerly waited for my food\n\nI ordered a vegetarian super burrito dorado style. The difference between the regular and the super is that the super comes with everything in the regular (meat if you got a meat burrito, beans that are whole refried or pinto, and pico de gallo), as well as sour cream, cheese, and avocado). The regular vegetarian burrito just comes with whole beans, cheese, and fresh salsa\n\nHOLY MOLE. This burrito. Amazing is an understatement. I come from SoCal, where there is pretty good Mexican food, but omg. So much flavor in one floury pillow.

Best burrito I've had in SF. Seating may be difficult to find (they have indoor and outdoor). Don't let the long line scare you.

After discovering amazing food trucks like Tacos Autlense and Tacos Sinoloa in Albany and Oakland that had orgasmic tacos and holy sanctuaries like El Farolitos that had the creme de la creme of quesadillas, the only place left for me to uncover was the absolute best place to go to for a burrito. \n\nIt may have been that I was hooked on El Farolitos and their quesadillas, or that I was too loyal to burritos in San Diego, but I never took the opportunity to go to La Taqueria. And boy did I regret that decision. Immediately after numerous sources pointed to this gem as the world's best burrito shop, I decided to pay this San Francisco taqueria a visit.\n\nFor those of you who are not familiar with the Mission District, this is the LIFE blood of San Francisco - in my opinion. The Mission has all things food, culture, and life in the city. But mind you, it also has horrendous parking. So if you are coming here, I advise walking, or get ready to spend an hour finding parking... as well as another hour for food. But we'll get there.\n\nI guess I came at the worst possible time on the Sunday after Cino De Mayo, but the line was WAYYYY out the door when we got there. If you don't want to wait, I recommend either coming on a weekday or just ordering togo. It pretty much took us an hour and a half to get to the front of the life. Luckily though, they have a nice system going where you order before you pay and once you find a seat (if you do find one), your food will come out pretty quickly. So on a bad day, I'd say you wait an hour and a half to pay, then wait another maybe 10 minutes before food comes out?\n\nIf you think I'm crazy to wait that long. You're right. I'm crazy ABOUT FOOD. Because damn, this burrito WAS AMAZING! I can guarantee that it was magnificent not because we were hella hungry (which we were), but because of several defining features of this burrito.\n\n1. The steak was perfectly cooked. I could tell because, as I was waiting in line, I saw how juicy that meat looked. I wanted it in my tummy and in my tummy it went. I recommend getting carne asada x100. It was crunchy, juicy, and delicious.\n\n2. The portion of ingredients is spectacular. This place does not skip on anything. My burrito had a healthy portion of steak, beans, sauce, guac, and salsa. \n\n3. The green sauce on the side is a must. If you love spicy food you will love their green sauce. In my opinion, it's not hot, but it adds an extra layer of juice that will make an amazing burrito x100 amazing. \n\n4. The best part about this burrito is honestly that it doesn't go beyond what it is: a burrito. There's nothing extra in here that will overpower the taste and the sauces aren't overflowing to the point where your hands get wet. And for most people, it's big enough to satisfy your hunger, but not massive to the point of heart burn. \n\nThe only regrets I had about this glorious burrito was that I didn't get it El Dorado Style (meaning it's extra fried I believe?). And that I didn't eat it slower. To be honest, I don't think I've ever eaten a burrito this fast before- a testament to how good it was. \n\nOverall, I have to say that La Taqueria is definitely one for the record books. Personally, I've had a lot of good burritos in my life, and theirs is clearly one of the best I've had. In terms of carne asada burritos, this was probably THE BEST. The only con was that the size could have been bigger. If you are really hungry, you can probably eat 2 regular sized burritos. And the price is on the higher end for its size ($10 for super, $12 for El Dorado). \n\nBut despite the massive wait time, I will definitely come back. Not just for the food but for how gregarious and awesome the owner was. You may have seen him virtually through Eater's video on La Taqueria (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajcJTpIh44o), but I recommend talking to him. He is so generous and sweet. For example, he will hand out roses to all the ladies (and men ahem). And if you are nice, he might even undercharge you (sometimes). For the burrito and for the friendly culture at La Taqueria, you get an experience of a lifetime. This hype is worth it, for I have to give this place an \"Omg, I'd wait two hours for this,\" BECAUSE I DID. AND IT WAS WORTH.\n\nEat well and prosper friends,", "author": "Bryan W."}

Well I guess by this places standards it wasn't. The line was just slightly out the door instead of down the street. The first thing I noticed was everyone there was probably between 21-35 years old. Very young hipster crowed, which is not always a bad sign but in my experience, when it comes to Mexican food, you want a little more diversity in the customers, otherwise it's likely more hype then substance. \n\nSo we wait...when you get close enough to the register they take orders while you're in line so when you get to the register you just pay for your food. It's a good system. The employees here HUSTLE! They are movin', chopping and wrapping they have a great system. They're just small and the amount of people that come here is insane. Its just a little hole in the wall with maybe 10, two people tables and three larger community tables. If you're vigilant you should be able to snag a seat somewhere either inside or outside. As far as parking...I mean it's the mission so parking is not impossible but you're gunna need a little parking karma to get a spot close by. \n\nNow for the food! Is this the best burrito in the world?????? Nah, but it's good. It's just not wait in line for 35-45 minutes and wait another 20 for your food good. \n\nThe good: The meat is delicious! The burrito is well mixed so you get a bite of all the goodies inside every time. The ingredients taste very fresh even at the end of the night which is a huge win I think. \n\nThe meh: No rice :( \nThe burrito is on the smaller side. Not tiny but for my husband it fell a little short (lol)\nThe tortilla was really soft...like taco bell bean burrito soft. I like my tortilla with a little more of a bite. They do have a grilled burrito option which might help with this. \nFinally the line. The wait is just not worth it.

So this is what I ordered, the super burrito with carne asada /carnitas (steak&pork). So the meat carne asada is good fresh made daily you literally see them cutting chunks of fresh beef and sectioning them into the trays to be provided for your order, same is to say about the chicken. The carne asada was tender, juicy, but for me lacked seasoning(salt) which is ok, just add green sauce for a kick and it is well worth it, the carnitas in my burrito was close to none, maybe one bite and half diced pork was in that bite so I can't comment on how good the pork was. If your looking for flavor and a good mesh of rice, guac, sour cream, pico de gallo, rice and beans this place serves it up quick but again not as good as some other spots\n\nWife tried two super carne asada tacos which came with crunchy tortilla, slice of cheese, meat, pico de gallo and sour cream, she did say taco wife it was good but not I have to go back good haha\n\nMy son ordered the chips and guac, the chips he was happy with but the guac he stated had no taste. He's only 7yrs old so that says allot haha\n\nFor best burrito in the bay, again sadly don't know how they got this rating, quick, fast, good after club or after drinking sure definite place to hit up, but for a meal without inebriation probably not the best you've had\n\nBurrito's *** yep sadly hard 3\nTacos ***.5 good; but not if not in the area not gonna drive out of the way to get\nPrice $$\nService **** very helpful staff\nAmbiance *** narrow seating meant for small groups or just couples, one large table in the back all other tables are small for 2 people or squeeze 4 people", "author": "Clarence A."}

That's way back in the days.  The food was always consistently delicious.  The meats seasoned, cooked, and chopped to perfection.  The tacos and burritos always put together with care.  Customer service was a joy, especially when Don Jara was at the register. He gave out flowers to the pretty girls and greeted everyone with much respect.  In the past few years business has obviously boomed.  It can get super crowded with out-the-door lines.  Unfortunately,  long lines of customers means the taqueros have to move faster and when they move faster meats are not cooked, chopped, or arranged the same.  Sadly, it's lost some of its quality and it's been hit and miss. \n \nI haven't given up on La Taqueria, but porfavor Don Jara, que regrese la calidad y el cuidado con que hacian la comida antes.  \n\nPROS: \nGood food*\nFriendly customer service\nDiandas is next door\nGet to see peoples cute dogs\n\nCONS\n*Food is hit and miss\nCan get really crowded \nParking hard to find\nNot open Monday and Tuesday\nHave to walk around peoples cute dogs", "author": "Manuel C."}

As the native San Diegan that I am, I have exacting standards for what constitutes really good Mexican food. \n\nI went to La Taqueria on a recent, sunny Saturday afternoon--mistake #1. The place was packed to the gills. I understand that it always is, but a nice Saturday in the Mission wasn't doing us any favors in the line department. I ordered a carnitas burrito especial (aka The Works) dorado style (meaning that the tortilla is grilled on the plancha). \n\nThe meat was really tender and flavorful without being overly fatty and greasy as so many carnitas are. The other fillings were forgettable and the tortilla was standard at best. My date ordered a steak burrito, and again the meat was clearly good quality, but everything else about it was kind of whatever. I did order a mango agua fresca, which was the highlight of my meal. \n\nOverall, if you're from somewhere that doesn't have the luxury of good Mexican food, you're going to love La Taqueria and think I'm insane. For those of us who know what truly great American-Mexican food is, though, this place is pretty overhyped.", "author": "Adrienne K."}

If you take really great individual ingredients like a juicy tender steak, fresh yet rich avocado, and great hearty but not overwhelming beans and then mash them all together of course you're going to have a hit on your hands. The burrito was so good I closed my eyes and leaned my head back as I took each bite. The burrito was so good I opened my eyes and I felt like I was in a bad dream when I saw that my burrito experience was over. I got the burrito durado (I think it's spelled like that) style, and it made the outside of the burrito nice and crisp which really added another layer of depth to the experience. I also ordered a small cantaloupe agua Fresca, and I was expecting water with a slight cantaloupe after taste, but when I took a sip I was transported to a new cantaloupe universe. I was on a planet made of cantaloupe floating on a cantaloupe river on a cantaloupe slice gondola. The flavor was so pure and delicious it was the perfect compliment to the ultimate burrito.

It's as if all the glowing reviews are by people that think Jack-in-the-Box tacos and Taco Bell chalupas are the real deal. SMH. \n\nHonestly, all the rave reviews appear to be more often than not by gringos that have never had tacos in East LA or TJ. Zagat dares to even call them \"true original\" and \"traditional\". Whatevs because Zagat suxorz.\n\nSure, my vitriol would have been tamed a bit had La Taqueria not been so \"hella\" overhyped. But a nearly $4 taco with factory-made tortillas that jumps to $6+ when you add sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo is ridiculous. Just the presence of sour cream is the sign of sell-out Mexican food.\n\nBoth the carnitas and carne asada lacked flavor. Even the taco meat at the carniceria section of my local supermercado tastes better. It's as if the meat was deliberately under-seasoned so you would have to pay more for the guac and pico. Also the carnitas was dryer than Chapelle Show's Tyrone Biggums' cotton mouth. Sidenote: Go check out Chapelle on his two-part Netflix special!\n\nAlas, I should've known better when I saw their full-of-themselves neon sign that proclaimed themselves as the best tacos and burritos in the whole world. That's right, whole world. What a [insert profanity] joke.\n\nFrom my experiences, when people or businesses have to tell you that they are the best, they usually are far from it.  \n\nOn top of their high prices, La Taqueria is cash only. Not comfortable carrying so much cash around the Mission since 4 tacos cost me nearly $30...\n\nIn my opinion, La Taqueria is a total Meh-xi-can't restaurant.", "author": "Richard K."}

The carne asada had a nice flavor to it when I could taste it, but I could hardly distinguish it from the blandness of the entire burrito. I had to use the green house sauce with every bite to add some type of flavor to it. Furthermore, the burrito is messy as hell (dripping all over the place) because of the refried bean juices.\n\nI had the side of chips, pico de gallo, and avocado. I liked the chips. They were crispy and tasted like they were made in-house. The pico de gallo and avocado tasted super fresh as well. The avocado especially tasted made-to-order as if someone had just literally scooped out an avocado and mashed it right then and there. Would have been nice if the pico de gallo and avocado had some salt, however.

The burrito doesn't include rice and is actually on the smaller side compared to a lot of jumbo ones you see nowadays, but the flavor is amazing! I honestly think the best part is the Pico de Gallo; the tomatoes taste so good! The tomatoes do turn watery though, so be careful of any drips. Prices are steep (~$9.50 pre-tax for a regular burrito with no add-ons), but what can you do, La Taqueria is in a prime location next to the Bart station and is now a try-before-you-die spot for tourists and locals too.

I don't mean they're at work - I mean they are building dreams with hammers and anvils.\n\nThe food looks so simple, and the process looks so remedial. Pile of chop meat. Mix Pico. Crunchy taco inside flour tortilla. No beans. No bullshit. Hands down the best, most flavorful taco I have ever had. I bought a chicken and a beef; I don't know their names, I just said chicken and beef. I also asked for a cup of their tomatillo verde sauce - mind twice blown. The sauce was like the spicy soul of a tomatillo mixed with the sweet blend of a Jalape\u00f1o - with some magic in between. I nearly would fly back to San Fransisco just to get a few more right now. The meat tastes strongly like meat, no adulterants. The pico was the most powerful garden salsa I've ever had on a taco. And the Verde just finished me off. \n\nThe parking is horrible, so I jumped from the car and my lady drove around the block a few times. We ate like thieves in some parking lot down the street, but it was revolutionary. This is real Mexican food, in every since of that moniker - so be ready for everything that comes with that phrase.

The taste is so boring and nothing special. The taco is $7.50 and it's tiny. Just make your own burrito and tacos.

Get this they don't put rice in the burrito because they believe it's just a filler. Meaning more room for the meat. I think I've tried everything at this place but to let you know my favorites here are the chorizo super burrito, the langua super taco, and the carne asada quesadilla. The chorizo has such a rich greasy taste, the langua melts in your mouth just falls apart because it's so tender, and the carne asada is jam packed with flavor. There's green salsa at every table which I love. It's pretty spicy so if your up for the heat I say try it. If you're in the Mission District of San Francisco you have to try La Taqueria.

The super burrito isn't terribly big, it just has cheese, sour cream, and guacamole. I'm not sure why you'd get the regular, cuz wouldn't that just be meat and beans? Yes this place doesn't put rice in their burritos which would be alarming at first but actually makes it taste much better, as rice doesn't have much taste. It's just a volumizer. So La Taq's burritos are perfectly assembled: thin layer of cheese melted INTO the tortilla, lots of meat (eh, could be more flavorful, i could barely taste it), but the perfect amount of sour cream, beans (I like pinto more than refried), and the GUACAMOLE just made it perfect. Dorado style warms the burrito and toasts the tortilla to be slightly browned and crispy. It's on the secret menu so you have to ask for it! They have spicy green sauce on the tables which is a nice addition. \n\nLa Taq is in the Mission District, just a short walk away from 24th and Mission. The place is really cramped and kind of dirty. We got here at 5:45 and waited in line for 5 min, and found a seat easily. The burrito came in around 10 minutes. However by 6 pm the line just kept growing and it got packed real fast. By 6:30-7 pm the line's out the door. So I suggest just coming a little bit before the dinner rush if you can! No wifi.", "author": "Shannon W."}

Loved the whole ambience of the place; how it seemed like a little hole-in \n-the-wall restaurant but everyone and their mothers' seemed to have heard about it. Note that it's a bit hard to find seating so while you're in line you might want to keep a lookout for open seats and grab them while your friend orders for you. I read the Yelp reviews and got the Carne Asada Super Burrito  El Dorado Style. The El Dorado style (which is hidden from the menu I think) just means the tortilla is fried so it has a nice golden and crispy touch to it. The difference between regular burritos and the super burrito is that the super burrito comes with more toppings - which i highly recommend. Personally, I don't think it's the BEST burrito I've ever had. Maybe I expected more from all the hype? It was good but not sure if it was something so amazingly delicious. All my friends enjoyed the burrito a lot more than I did. They appreciate the absence of rice and liked how it made the burrito a bit more wet. So I guess the title of the \"best burritos\" might be disputed from person to person. One of my friends got the chicken quesadilla, but she didn't like it as much. The chicken came in huge chunks in the quesadilla and she said everything was pretty bland. I also tried the salsa and chips and it was really good- everything tasted homemade and fresh. If you can, I HIGHLY recommend getting the fresh juice drinks. I tried the tamarind, mango, and horchata and all three were so delicious!

If the gods of any religion were still around, you'd likely find them in line waiting on a carne asada burrito and taking selfies. Behind the dense crowd of gringos and tourists you'll find a bustling staff cranking out hundreds (if not thousands) of burritos a day. Don't like lines? There's plenty of other crappy options in every direction. Choose one.\n\nI've given this some careful thought. What makes La Taqueria so special? My answer: its simplicity. Beans, meat and salsa. That's what you're getting and they have truly perfected every ingredient. You can taste the freshness with every bite. Add some of the house salsa and you got yourself a mouth party! \n\nI love my burritos and can easily pick out bland or mediocre flavor. You really pay for what you get. It's definitely a little pricey but well worth it. I walked by this restaurant yesterday after having a big dinner. I almost got in line for second dinner after catching a whiff of grilled meat.

It seems like every year, La Taqueria makes it on every top 10 list for its institution-like following of its burritos and tacos. With its never-ending notoriety, you can expect the lines at La Taqueria to be long; morning, day and night.\n\nThis past Saturday, I decided to brave the crowds and skip my favorite taqueria and give La Taqueria a try - at last. The line wasn't as bad as I anticipated and ended a little before their door and didn't stretch onto Mission Street like I've seen in the past. The combination of the line and the small dining area made this place packed beyond belief. There wasn't one table empty as everyone got down on this warm Saturday afternoon.\n\nAs the line crawled towards the front, the menu became more visible, and is as simple as can be: tacos, burritos, quesadillas, extras, and your choice of beverage, which includes a selection of soft drinks, aqua frescas and beer. I chose to go with my usual order and that's two tacos, one carne asada and one pollo asado. I decided to go with the regular taco, which is simply the protein, beans (refried or pinto) and pico de gallo. If you choose to super your taco, it adds sour cream, cheese and avocado for an additional $2.50\n\nIt didn't take long for our number to get called which is typically standard at most taquerias. Once I set eyes on my tacos, I was impressed with the size, which correlates directly with the higher price point. The tacos were hefty and must of had a good 4 or 5 ounces of protein stuffed inside of them and topped off with pinto beans and pico de gallo.\n\nThe pollo asado was lean and moist and and grilled perfectly. Even with the cilantro, pinto beans, and pico de gallo, it still lacked a little flavor; however the carne asada managed to save the day. The meat was juicy and had the flavor that was missing form the pollo asado. The taqueria does have a house sauce available at all the tables, which was a nice add on but be careful because it does pack plenty of heat. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my tacos but given the higher price, and the crazy lines, I'm not prepared to make this my go to taqueria in the Mission. I do admit that their food is above-average and will satisfy any Mexican cravings, but it does come with a few flaws. I personally love the simplicity of a taco that is nothing but a tortilla, your chosen protein and topped with cilantro and onions. Regardless La Taqueria is a strong contender when it comes to choosing a taqueria when eating in the Mission; you simply can't go wrong.\n\nAmbiance/Decor: 3/5\nFood: 4/5\nService: 4/5\nPrice: $$\nOverall: 4/5\n\nPros:\n+ A Mission District institution \n+ Small and simple menu\n+ Lean and moist pollo tacos\n+ Carne asada tacos are a must try, packing plenty of favor\n+ Higher prices but larger portions\n+ Selection of aqua frescas and beer\n+ Fast and friendly staff\n+ Patio seating \n+ Tacos dorados are a must try if you're from out of town\n\nCons:\n- Limited seating\n- Lines at all times of the day", "author": "Alexander E."}

Your choice of meat, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese & avocado come together to form the perfect balance and plethora of flavors! The carne asada is always charred to perfection, yet the meat maintains a nice soft texture that allows the juices of the meat to seep out with each bite. The beans are pretty average, but the interesting part is that they don't add rice to their burritos, I personally think this is a benefit as you're able to get more meat and you're able to taste the meat a lot more than you would if a ton of rice was stuffed into the burrito. The addition of cheese, avocado and sour cream provide a creamy and rich component to the burrito, they also cut through all of the oils from the meat and refried beans. Finally, because they grill all of their burritos, it's rare for the burrito to fall apart due to all of the juices that usually tend to make burritos fall apart easily. The perfect burrito, seriously. The chicken is good, but can be a little bland at times. I highly recommend on of their other red meat options! If you're not feeling a burrito, the quesadillas are really delicious as well.\n\nPrice: Above average food deserves above average prices!\n\nService: Quick and friendly.\n\nAmbiance: Usually a long line, but it moves pretty fast and is worth waiting for.

Maybe it was because I was a newbie here, but I totally looked like an idiot at the wrong place to get my food.\n\nI got a carne asada burrito, and I found the carne asada to not be as tender as I'd like; in fact, my teeth started to hurt because the meat was kind of tough. The burrito was kind of mushy and got pretty boring after three bites. I didn't have that super satisfying feeling of freshness from cilantro, onions, nicely grilled meat...I only really got a smorgasbord of mixed-up flavors.\n\nMy friends and I also got the chips and salsa. This was pretty big, and I have to say that while the salsa was pretty good at first, it also did get kind of boring after a while simply because it didn't have much kick or depth to it. Some more tanginess and spice would have done wonders.\n\nAll in all, was it a satisfying meal? Well, Mexican food is usually suuuper filling, and this was no exception. However, I wasn't able to finish my burrito not because I didn't have the stomach capacity, but just because I wasn't super crazy about it. \n\nI don't feel like this place is worth the long lines; for much cheaper and even better options, I would even visit your local taco truck instead.\n\n\u00a1Qu\u00e9 l\u00e1stima (What a shame)!", "author": "Tremaine E."}

This time around I made sure to get here earlier (5pm) and the wait was quite short. I went with 2 carne asada tacos with guac and they were quite sizeable. One thing I realized after receiving my tacos was it was a double layer of soft taco! Apparently, \"dorado\" style must be specifically ordered, which is a hard taco inside a soft taco. Did not know this, but they were kind enough to remake the taco dorado style. \n\nReading other reviews, it seems like you can get dorado style burritos, which I will most definitely have to try next time. The first dorado taco I had wasn't quite crispy enough, so it was kind of chewy. The second taco was a bit better and much easier to eat. The carne asada meat wasn't too oily and each taco had plenty of meat.", "author": "Edward W."}

When I ate here it was late night after dance class. Due to that article the line was long. I wanted a carnitas burrito but La Taqueria ran out of it and I ended up having a lengua burrito. Maybe it was because my dinner was late at night or I was waiting for about an hour for the burrito I didn't enjoy my meal. Due to my experience that night I never thought about eating here again. However there were times I thought about eating here again during a time when this place wasn't so packed. My first visit I initially wanted to order the cabeza tacos but La Taqueria was out of cabeza so I never had taco my first time here. \n\nSince today is National Taco Day I decided to come here again for only the tacos. I've read Yelp reviews that you can order a crispy taco. I knew what I wanted. I ordered two tacos - one crispy carnitas taco and one soft cabeza taco. The portion of both tacos is bigger than most tacos I've seen at other taquerias. The crispy and soft tacos provided different textures of the tortilla. The deep fried taco matched well with the carnitas. Surprisingly the carnitas wasn't oily. Also the soft taco matched with the cabeza. Due to the portion these tacos were filling. The two tacos I had were more delicious and tasty than the burrito I ate during my first here. \n\nEven though La Taqueria is known for its burritos I highly recommend ordering the tacos. To delve in your taco experience order one taco crispy and the other soft. Since the portion of the tacos at La Taqueria is huge two tacos are more than enough. I'm definitely glad I came back at La Taqueria for National Taco Day.", "author": "Gerald R."}

Seeing as I hate to wait in line, it took me several weeks to sample a veggie taco at La Taqueria. And, actually, aside from the ever-present line, La Taqueria's steep prices turned me away more than once. \n\nI'm a SF native and live for the kind of food La Taqueria serves up.

It was the smallest and most expensive veggie taco I've ever purchased and chips were not included. [I also went back later to sample a veggie burrito - for $6.31. It was the same size as what other taquerias refer to as a \"baby burrito.\" Great if you're a light eater like me, but why pay top dollar for a half-size burrito?!]. \n\nThe food was good but I refuse to join the ranks of stubborn locals who insist that this is the best of the best or ill-informed out-of-towners, who must read about La Taqueria in their tourist guides, and pay close to twice what I'd pay at any other Mission district taqueria.\n\nIf you're reading this and debating whether or not La Taqueria is worthy of your $$$ and time, I'd suggest you go elsewhere (La Corneta, on Mission near 23rd St. is a good option - with lower prices, shorter lines, and chips and salsa included). \n\nThen again, if you're someone who likes to follow the crowd, equates a long line with reputability, and can handle high prices and small portions, go get in line at La Taqueria!", "author": "Beau W."}

The crispy taco shell wrapped in a soft flour tortilla is genius and adds amazing texture. They serve generous amounts of juicy large chunks of carne asada. Also, don't be cheap add the extra few bucks and make it a super since the guac, cheese, and sour cream marry well with the meat. This is also a huge taco, the biggest one I have ever had. Two tacos filled me up perfectly. Granted as I was eating it, a lot of it was smeared on my face, but hey it was that good!\n\nIn the future, would I come back yes!

Somewhere on Mission Street, there's a glowing logo in bright neon lights that reads: La Taqueria - The Best Tacos & Burrito in the Whole Word.  That's a very bold statement to live by.  But their name consistently makes the lists of top taquerias, even winning ESPN's FiveThirtyEight NCAA-like burrito bracket.  There are no offal selections in their tourney so it really didn't interest me that much.\n\nLa Taqueria has been in our radar ever since our older daughter read about their carnitas burrito being crowned by FiveThirtyEight as America's Best Burrito.  Just like everything that's popular and hyped, line was out the door, wrapping around the tables inside.  When it was finally our turn, we chose the carnitas and carne asada burritos plus the lengua, cabeza, and carne asada tacos.  A mango and watermelon aguas frescas completed our cash-only order.  Prices were on the steeper side, but the burritos and tacos were loaded with lots of meat.  Finding a table was the next challenge.  Luckily, we were able to find a vacant spot in one of the shared tables.  There wasn't much elbow room which was expected.\n\nThe texture and flavor of the carnitas were good, but it was the carne asada that was the true frontrunner here.  I thought it was skirt steak, but it was top sirloin.  It's not marinated; they just add some salt before grilling then brush it with their secret seasoning while on high heat.  Burritos didn't come with rice which they said was typical of traditional burritos, saving my wife the trouble of telling them to exclude it.  We had ours Dorado style, i.e., griddled to a golden brown giving that crispy exterior.  The lengua and cabeza were tender, moist, and tasty.  We were fortunate to have one of those bottled green salsa nearby and I got a bit carried away squeezing it on my tacos.  Good stuff!\n\nIt can't be the best if they don't have tripas, buche, or even al pastor.  However, the carne asada was outstanding which made me round this review up to a four.  Add to that the option to have it Dorado style.  So good!  Also, the quality and freshness of the meat and everything else were very noticeable.  There's too much publicity over the carnitas; if the article featured their chorizo as the winner, then everyone would be raving about it too.  Just get the carne asada - there's no bracket required to proclaim it as the real champion.", "author": "John L."}

Seeing how ESPN's FiveThirtyEight dubbed La Taqueria's burrito as America's best burrito a couple years back, the wait is not a big surprise.\n\nSince seating is limited and hot food is best enjoyed hot, we had to watch tables like a hawk to try and snag one as a group finishes.

Go to \"La Taqueria\". Enough said. As crazy as this sounds, I actually came here for the first time back in the mid-90's when I was still living in the Bay Area (before relocating to Sacramento in 2001). And back then, it was not nearly as busy as it is now. \n\nJump forward to 2016 and you will find an eclectic variety of gentrified hipsters, musicians, techies, tourists, and families that keep the business here alive and kicking. Since it has been over a decade, I remember it being one of my go-to spots for real-deal no frills Mexican food. The menu is basic; tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. And simple is better since the flavor and quality is ridiculously legit.\n\nThe inside of this place is small; especially if there's a line that snakes around the restaurant. Therefore, seating is extremely limited. There are very few seats on the outside so my best recommendation is to take your food to-go. However, even on the most busiest days, you are able to walk up, order your food, and get out within 10 minutes. My lady and I came on a Sunday afternoon around 5pm and since we ate only a few hours prior, one taco each would carry us over. Therefore, we both chose their \"Carne Asada Taco\" (priced at $3.75). The price is a little steep but they give you generous portions + you're in the heart of the tourist trap Mission District.\n\nOur food arrives in less than 5 minutes. However the bag only had our two tacos. So we basically had to go back to the counter and ask for salsa. Not a big deal but we like to spice our tacos up for flavor. Since it was jam packed with people running like chickens with their heads cut off, we luckily found nearby seating outside of a laundromat! And the weather cooperated with us as it was still sunny and mild, even after 5pm.\n\nOne bite of these tacos and I was in absolute heaven. I can't quite pinpoint the seasonings that \"La Taqueria\" provides but my oh my, each succulent bite was bursting with flavor. And I have to say, I've had some killer tacos in my time (especially being born and raised in California my whole life) and \"La Taqueria\" is definitely in my top 5 best taco places I've ever eaten at.\n\nOne surprising thing is that when I ate here years ago, they had VERY late hours; even open past midnight at times. I only remember this because this was my spot after my share of bar and clubhopping back in the 90's. However, they do stay open until 9pm on most nights. Overall, the quality of food paired up with decent prices and quite, attentive customer service gives this place a unanimous five-star rating. So do yourself a favor, go to \"La Taqueria\". It truly is real-deal Mexican food!", "author": "Donovan H."}

This is my favorite burrito in San Francisco because there is no RICE in the way obstructing my flavor experience. Get the burrito super (you NEED the guac) and get it \"el dorado\" style (sizzles on the grill for a bit so it's \"dorado\" = golden). The first time I came here, I was not that impressed, but I did not know the golden secret. Now I crave that glorious first bite, when your teeth sink into the crispy layer of the tortilla, then the chewy, then the flavor-packed meat and fresh avocado. \n\n- I personally always get the chicken super burrito and every friend I've taken here for some reason buys the carne asada super burrito. Both are fabulous. Tacos are solid as well, but I would rather go to a taco specialty place for those. I find the corn tortillas here a little too large (2 tacos feels like too much food, but 1 will not hit the spot) and the ratio of filling:tortilla too small to fulfill its flavor potential.\n\n- Veg warning: I have found the vegetarian taco I ordered here to be bland. The La Taqueria flavor fairy doesn't wave the wand over the beans (if at all) as he/she does over the meat. \n\nPRO TIP: call to order ahead and then skip the line. Do check your bag to see what you receive--I walked out with one carne asada super and one carnitas last time instead of one chicken. \n\nSERVICE: Do be aware this is CASH ONLY. There is a Chase across the way, but if you are coming solo you don't want to be crying tears of frustration as you walk it to the ATM. Friendly cashier who hands out roses to lucky ladies (you should have seen the face of the 4 y/o in front of me light up!).\n\nAMBIANCE: Frenzy of prep cooks calling out orders, all the sounds of excited tourists and locals yelling over it, and mad frying happening in the kitchen. This is not a place for an intimate conversation or to work (HA!). Though it is always packed, if you are diligent you will find seating for your party, but do be friendly enough to share the bigger tables with others :).

I tried to smush it together to get a mix but it ate like a wet soggy burrito.  It needs more texture or something and maybe that's the rice element that's missing, but it isn't even that it's just a lot of decent ingredients but not mixed very well.  The portion is quite small for a $15 burrito and the amount of meat is not too substantial either, and the worst part is one large piece of the pork was entirely gristle.

Its clientele certainly do. Even on non-peak times, this place is pretty packed. On our visits to San Francisco, we usually do a 3-and-out pickup in the Mission before the drive back to South Bay. (1) Some baked goods at Tartine. (2) Some ice cream at Bi-Rite. and (3) A burrito at La Taqueria or El Farolito. It's a triumvirate of epic proportions. And to accomplish the third, it's best to call ahead and get your burrito upon entry.\n\nLet's get this out of the way. La Taqueria's burrito is better than El Farolito's. Yes, it's more expensive. Yes, it's smaller. And yes, it tastes better. And when it comes to Mission-style burritos, quality over quantity is a good mantra to live by. I actually like the smaller burrito size, because it turns singular bites into a better medley of all ingredients. (This is the Chipotle vs. Freebird's corollary.) As such, every bite of La Taqueria's super burrito is fantastic.\n\nIf I could have it my way, I'd actually pick up some of El Farolito's legendarily good green salsa on the way out to pair with the burrito. La Taqueria's salsas (both the verde and the rojo) are good, standard fare, but nothing I'd go out of my way for. El Farolito's green sauce is. But alas, the burrito is the star of the show, and La Taqueria's is hard to beat.

While I must say the food, particularly the meat is some of the best marinated I have ever had at an SF Taqueria, it doesn't make up for the poor use of space in managing the long lines and crowd flow, rice-less burritos which I guess just isn't my style, the fact they are cash only, and their sorry excuse for an horchata. The two times I've been here, I always leave this place bewildered as to why so many folks come here.\n\nI'd say try it once just to say you did and to taste for yourself but there are much better and less crowded alternatives if you are looking for good Tacos, Quesdillas, and Burritos. \n\nA final redeeming tip I will add is that the folks working here sure know how to keep up the hospitality and their cool even when there are 30+ folks in line.

Everyone else (I mean, EVERYONE, as the line was out the door and around the corner) was lured there as well, so try to find this on an off-peak eating time if you're going to do it.  I ordered the carnitas burrito and my partner the carne asada.  Review of the carne was, \"Fine,\" with an eyeroll.  My thoughts on the carnitas were that the tortilla was fridge-cold, and the guac was freezer-cold, leaving my burrito overall kinda room-temp at best.  It was incredibly soggy and the tortilla was ripped when I unwrapped it, so it was a logistical nightmare to eat with individual beans falling out the entire time.  The carnitas meat had a good texture, was moist and soft with crispy edges like you'd hope for, but the only detectable flavor was salt.

It's not everyday that you get the chance to try the supposed best burrito in the country so I had to stop by for lunch.\n\nFirst off, let me start out by saying the service is PHENOMENAL. The man at the register (who I'm assuming is the owner) was incredibly kind. After making some small talk about where we're from, he decided to throw in some freebies for us. He gave us two free ordres of chips and salsa and two free fruit drinks (watermelon and strawberry; both are delicious). He also gave each of my sisters a rose, which was random, but nice. He made us feel incredibly welcome and comfortable.\n\nI tried the carne asada burrito with guac and cheese. The burrito is excellent! I really haven't had meat in a burrito as good as it was here. I wish I had gotten less things in the burrito (i.e. no guac and no beans) so that I could enjoy more of the meat. The guac and beans hold back the burrito in my opinion, but it's still good! I'm just being super critical because it's supposed to be the best. \n\nOverall, I'm definitely a fan of La Taqueria. They make some darn good burritos!", "author": "Naeem B."}

Cash only, no black beans apparently, you have to order chips separately, and a rather small burrito. \n\nDespite all of this, la taq still managed to win me over. I came here well aware of the hype and cannot deny my carne asada burrito was really damn good. I got the carne asada burrito, chips and salsa (should have also asked for guac, but that's my bad) and the tangerine agua fresca. I had never had an agua fresca so good before. I wanted to get more before leaving but didn't bring enough cash. \n\nI've gone to a fair amount of hyped burrito places around the city now, only to leave thinking they were \"meh\" but la taq held up in terms of flavor (not so much in quantity). I will absolutely be back to try other things from their menu such as the tacos and will be getting another carne asada burrito in the near future. (If you want hot sauce, you can ask for it when ordering. I only saw the fine print on the menu after already being seated. \n\nThe moral of the story is if you are looking for a deal in terms more food for your buck, maybe go to the place down the street.

They said it'd take 1.5 hours, so it was time to find some food.  The driver from Pink Ladies Tour Co was raving about La Taqueria after I told him how disappointed I was about Mexican food in the Bay Area, so it was on today.\n\nAfter backtracking a little southbound, we reached La Taqueria with no problem.  We lucked out with parking on this day after Thanksgiving and walked right in.  The line (as expected) was a bit long.  My first gripe about this place was that it was at first difficult to determine who was waiting for food vs waiting to order.  Anyways we were pleased to see that they had the right mix of meat choices.  We both like carnitas (my benchmark meat) and lengua.  In the interest of saving space for Bi-Rite Ice Cream later in the day, we ate somewhat light :)  I ordered a carnitas burrito and the significant other ordered two lengua tacos.  We split an horchata as she's never had one, but always wondered what it tasted like.\n\nI could tell that these tacos are more homestyle/street style than what I've seen in the East Bay.  Though at the same time, they have a bit of the gringo side of it too.  The carnitas burrito I ordered had pinto beans, carnitas, cilantro, and onions.  Her tacos had the cilantro/onions w/ the lengua.\n\nThe quality of my burrito was really good.  Best so far in the Bay area.  I've had better down south, but this will definitely do.  I ate about half of it without the chile verde sauce so I could taste all the ingredients better and with each bite, I appreciated it more.  I had a bite of her lengua tacos, but I was not impressed too much esp the tortillas.  They were a bit stiff and overcooked and had a chalky/limey aftertaste.  \n\nMy biggest gripe was the cost of the tacos.  Welcome to the Bay area, I know.  The burrito was fairly priced.  Oh, not once did I see any staff cleaning the tables.  Big negative.  And lastly, a guy came in and played music and asked for tips.  Not a big fan of that.  Doesn't add to the ambiance and it only seemed to make people shout over him while they were having lunch.\n\nFor me, this was a 4.5 and I do intend to return again if I'm in the area.

As a test, the next time you get a burrito from some other place, ask for a little bit of burrito rice on the side. And prepare to be disappointed. The beans are similar, sometimes worse, sometimes better.\n\nBut that's part of the genius of La Taq. No rice and the beans are really good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-10-24", "description": "I could go the easy way here and give it a solid 4-star review.  I mean, I've given several places that are nothing to be excited about a 4-star review.  And, this IS a place where you probably should at some level be excited about.  I feel obligated to grade this place in the context of what you are seeing and hearing about it.  This place is not all that.  It's good, and based on the quality of the food coupled with the experience, and with a hint of the expectations, I'll say that A-Ok is a fine review.  3-stars is fair, particularly if you really grade it in context.\n\nHey, this place doesn't shy from the mantle of \"Best Burrito in the Country\".  That is pretty high praise.  If I were them, I'd be like... Nah...  We just do our thing and try and stay humble.  They don't take that approach at La Taqueria.  They eat up the accolades.  Fine.  Perfectly fair.  But, if you want to play that game, I am holding you to that standard.  And, by that standard, La Taqueria is incredibly disappointing.  The food is far from spectacular.  The waiting is long and is not done well.  There is even a limited means to sit and eat, because the whole thing is just silly.  It's like they have the greatest thing ever from a ownership standpoint - people will wait forever, pay a ton, wait even longer, and you don't even have to host them.  Then, they thank you for the pleasure.  Because:  \"They ate at the place that has the 'Best Burrito in America'\".  \n\nIt's not.  It's not even close.  It's good, I won't say it isn't.  It is not the best burrito in America.  Here's the deal.  They don't add rice, you get lots of meat (which is good) and pretty solid pinto beans and pico.  Not bad.  Add another $2.50 for Cheese, Sour Cream and (bad) Guac.  Pretty rich.  Of course, it isn't cheap.  You are at about $12 for a dressed burrito, and more if you go no beans.  The tacos are plenty spendy, especially if you get them Super-style.  Super-style is a great thing for the owner.  I'd prefer a better base.   Beans in tacos?  Ehh...  You really think this is the \"Best in America\"?   I also had one of the most mediocre Chicken Quesadilla's of my life for $5.  I think this place is altight, but it's damn expensive.  It should be very good.  Plus, you already came to The Mission, and you are in the freakin' Mission in SF, and you better be getting good Mexican food.  I can definitely name at least four places you should hit in The Mission alone that are better.  And, cheaper.  AND, don't require a 15-20 minute wait once you've already waited 10-15 minutes.  I can probably expanding that list by trying the next 10-12 places at least once.  \n\nLet's go back to the experience for a moment.  They must have a low opinion of their audience here.  What a poor experience.  You wait in line for ages.  It's just packed.  Many people are not regulars so they have no idea what is happening.  Then you order, and you wait in another line to pay.  Then you wait forever for like 10-20 minutes.  They don't move fast.  They don't have a good system - which, hey, would make sense.  Then you finally get your food, and are no longer in the mood and wish you would have just went, well, anywhere.  There isn't a seat.  By then time you figure out where to carve out a niche, your Mexican food is cold and Mexican food is better warm.  If this place truly had a good product, they could take a lot of other approaches.  Here is an absolute kicker for how they could be better - Their one really good burrito is much better when it is grilled, which is called Dorado-style.  You wouldn't know it on the menu, because it is \"secret\".  I knew how to get it, and that added even more to the wait.  I had one without the extra grilling they other day and it was half as good.\n\nI think they are willing to play the game.  They at best deserve a 3-star.  If I didn't know that someone else called it the Best in America, I don't know if I would ever go back.  I doubt I'll be back soon.  I'd be very careful when you are approaching popular places that have celebrity.  Sometimes famous and good are not the same thing.", "author": "Adam S."}

Is it at bargain prices like all other taquerias in the Mission? NOPE. Is it still worth it? YASSS!\n\nDespite its modest, easily overlooked name, La Taqueria is the only place in Norcal I've come across serving Mexican food that would rival SD Mexican food in a blind taste test. It's something to do with the cooking technique and quality of the ingredients that I don't know enough about to be able to pinpoint like real food critics. But I can attest to the fact that La Taqueria's carne asada straight-up tastes like steak, that their al pastor is as succulent as the pork belly in my ramen, that the soft tacos taste like homemade pressed flour, that their crispy tacos have that extra savory fresh-off-the-grill overtone, that the mind-blowing deliciousness altogether makes Taco Bell look inedible. \n\nI ordered one al pastor and one carne asada taco; one was regular and one was super because my limited budget and limited stomach space can only afford me one super taco. The tacos were humongous and stuffed to the brim, with two La Taqueria tacos amounting to a satisfying lunch. You could tell why their food is so good just by watching the food prep--with the high turnover, mounds of carne asada slabs are always piled on the grill and are quickly sliced to meet the demand (makes Mediterranean places look subpar with the mostly untouched shawarma on the rotating spit).\n\nThey conveniently wrap half the tacos in paper for dining convenience. You don't have to choose between eating with hands that will inevitably smell like food, versus eating with a fork layer by layer and sacrificing the taconess. The paper wrap is quite ingenious, but if you are a nonsensical obsessive food porn Yelper like me, you will feel obligated to take off part of the paper for the picture and attempt to put it back on. It doesn't work too well, but it is my own undoing that I prioritize food pictures over practical aspects of eating.\n\nService was efficient thank God, because it's always packed--by 11:30am the line was already so long it had stretched the length of the restaurant and looked like it would have to go into the bathroom. Note that there are two people taking orders; I stood by one of them and was beginning to get frustrated why they had skipped my number, then realized that my tacos were sitting on the other counter ready to be devoured :v\n\nAt over $11 for my one regular and one super taco, they are definitely bouge tacos (minus the square ceramic plate). In SD $11 would get you a king's feast of hearty authentic Mexican food, but at the end of the day there are never regrets when splurging at SF's La Taqueria, quite appropriately named THE Taqueria.", "author": "Edna C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-05-26", "description": "tl;dr - Good, but not worth the wait nor price.\n\nScene:  Weekday lunchtime.  Mostly locals, some tourists, and a sprinkling of \"like, OMG Becky, I totes gotta get this on my Insta\" girls, a few brogrammers, and \"I'm so edgy and urban since I'm in The Mission now and am 'in the know' for this sick burrito joint, but I'm totally not a hipster\" hipsters.  5-10 minute line to order, another 10 minutes or so for food prep.  Open seats a bit scarce, but not horribly so.\n\nFood:  Since it got ranked \"America's Best Burrito\", I'm going to be a bit more judgemental here.  \n\nPresentation - Burritos aren't rolled very tightly, nor is their foil wrapping.  This is the first time I've ever had a burrito where you could cleanly take off the foil and have it still look uncrinkled.  What's wrong with that?  Since the foil's ends aren't closed off well, you get meat juice all over the place, which particularly sucks without rice to soak it up, and especially sucks with orange chorizo oil.  A loose burrito just feels sloppy.  Maybe I've had bad luck of the draw here.\n\nTaste - Being riceless is a nice change of pace.  The meat is well seasoned, tender, and juicy, although the carnitas could've used a little something something...not sure what - it was well salted, but maybe a smidge watery?  The times I've had it, it was missing the crunchier fried bits you get at other places.  The chorizo is more flavorful, but tends to be a bit messy and you can end up with a shiny neon orange burrito (and hands) due to the aforementioned oil leakage.  The off-menu dorado style ~sounds~ like a great option, but it tends to end up more greasy than crispy.  Looks purty though.\n\n\"Value\" - It's on the smaller end of the burrito spectrum.  Still plenty of food for an average meal, but not forearm sized like other places.  Scarfing down two wouldn't be a crazy possibility on a construction worker appetite.  Keep in mind though that it doesn't have rice to bulk it up.  At $11 for a super burrito, it's on the higher end of the spectrum.

I've only recently started eating Mexican food, and I couldn't have been more excited to try out La Taqueria. When I hopped into my Uber, the driver was so excited that I was going to La Taqueria. He said it was the best. \n\nLocated in the heart of the Mission District, La Taqueria definitely exudes its own cultural vibe. I loved the architecture of the restaurant and I really felt I was in the Mission community. On a Wednesday at 2:15 PM, this place still had a small line for their food. I guess one could never get enough tacos or quesadillas or burritos right? Anyway, I wasn't sure what to get so I opted for what was recommended.\n\nCarne Asada Tacos: 5 stars\n\nI really liked the Carne Asada tacos. The meat was perfect. I'm not the biggest fan of beans so I actually picked off what I could, but this taco had plenty of meat & toppings on it. I saved it for last because my friend had told me it was the best out of all the tacos he tried.\n\nCabeza Tacos: 5 stars\n\nI loved the Cabeza tacos as well. It had cilantro and onions on top. It was just the perfect combo together. \n\nCarnitas Tacos: 4 stars\n\nI was really excited for the pork tacos, but they were just ok. They have the same toppings as the Carne Asada I believe, but for some reason it just didn't taste that great. I think it might have been just the texture of the meat since it's a lot more soft with the pork.\n\nCarnitas Burrito (Super): 4 stars\n\nThis burrito was huge. My brother ordered it for his meal, and he was definitely stuffed after eating all of it. This burrito was stuffed with pork, beans, avocado, sour cream, and cheese. It did not disappoint. However, when my brother tasted my tacos, he said he wished he ordered the Carne Asada Burrito instead. Nonetheless, the burrito still tasted really good!\n\nFor around $25 for all of this, this wasn't bad at all. Considering that their tacos and burritos were stuffed and we all left feeling extremely full, we were extremely satisfied!\n\nThe only thing that was hard was finding seats. Although it didn't take too long for a table to clear up, I can definitely imagine that perhaps during lunch time or when it's an extremely busy hour and La Taqueria is extremely packed, it'd be hard to find a seat and be comfortable while eating these hands-on foods.", "author": "Marissa W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-03", "description": "I've only been here once, and rarely do I give an establishment 5 stars on the first pass.  But this place is an outlier in all senses of the word.\n\nAfter being told by a coworker that lives in the Bay Area about the greatness that is La Taqueria, I'll admit was a bit skeptical.  Sure, San Francisco has great food, but when I think of San Francisco, I generally think of the bakeries and dim sum of Chinatown, the seafood of Fisherman's Wharf, and (of course) the wonderful Italian food in North Beach.  Plus, I live in Texas.  As the Bowling for Soup song \"Come Back to Texas\" reminds listeners, \"...the Mexican food sucks North of here anyway.\"  This is generally a mantra that I've lived by.  And it's damn near always true.\n\nSo, the first time I was told about it, I bookmarked it on Yelp, and figured I'd get there someday.  Then, I totally forgot about it.  \n\nFast forward to this week.  I was staying in Oakland and commuting all the way to the SFO airport on the Bart.  When I asked around for a good place to eat, I was reminded by the same coworker that La Taqueria was not far from the 24th Street Mission district BART station.  Having only spent a very little amount of time in the Mission district on a bus tour years ago, I remembered the murals and thought, \"hey, how bad could it be?\" and decided to give it a go.  If nothing else, I could get a good feel for the local culture.\n\nI jumped of at the proper BART station, and headed up the stairs (no operable escalators, bummer...) and got to the surface, and started checking out the surroundings.  Things were colorful and diverse, as one would expect in the Mission.  A short walk down the street found me in front of La Taquiera, where I was greeted with an incredibly long line (At 1:30 in the afternoon!)  I almost thought I may skip it because the line was too long.  Thank goodness I didn't.  \n\nI got in line, and started looking around.  Everything looked marvelous, but my coworker had previously talked me into getting 2 tacos - one chicken, one beef (carne asada), both supreme (with cheese, sour cream, and guacamole.)  I settled on sticking with this plan and waited for about 20 minutes.  I had a bit of a freak-out moment when I saw that they accepted cash only, but I checked and had plenty.\n\nEventually I got to the front of the line, ordered the aforementioned tacos, and ordered a Negra Modelo to go along with it.  After a brief wait, I got my tacos and beer, and wound my way across the restaurant (carrying a briefcase-suitcase, along with it) over to one of the picnic tables, where I fought for a place to sit.  I managed to cram my suitcase under the table between my legs while I chowed down on the tacos. \n\nAnd let me tell you.  What tacos they were.  DELICIOUS.  Especially the chicken taco surprised the crap out of me.  These were fantastic.  They were moist, tasty, and wrapped in a soft tortilla which had a little crunch to it--cooked to perfection.  The \"super\" aspect of the tacos made them very messy (I did manage to get it all over my shirt AND my suitcase), and the napkins on the table didn't provide much effectiveness or solace.  The carne asada taco was great as well, but I just loved the chicken taco so much.  It may well be the best taco I've ever had.  It is without question in the top 5.\n\nI will be back...  this place is incredible.  I can provide a lot of negative feedback from the experience--crowded, long wait, no silver (or plastic) cutlery, cash only, no private tables, and getting the food literally all over myself and the items that I was carrying.  But friends, it was ALL worth it.  I'd go so far to say that for tacos that good, I'd gladly put on my best suit and bathe in a vat of pure, messy taco.\n\nFor first timers, I'd get the same thing that I got.  (Though the quesadillas, nachos, and burritos look equally great.)  The agua frescas looked great also.  I'll probably do one of those next time.  This place is great, and worth a detour.  I'll probably come here each time I take the BART from SFO to downtown San Francisco.", "author": "Joe K."}

Mind you, their burritos are of average size (not like the super size offered at some other Mexican restaurants) and lastly, My order was to go (because the place was packed and there was no where to sit with my family), so we decided to walk down to McDonalds, which was only about a block away to order the kids a Happy Meal and sit down and eat there and by the time we started eating (which was probably no more than 5 mins from the time the order was ready), the burritos and tacos were extremely soggy from all the water from the pico de Gallo and excess fluid from the meat. On top of that, they forgot to give me sauce (even though I asked for it) and no chips is included :( overall, I would say this place is not worth the hype, so unless you live in the Mission area, I would suggest finding another local Mexican restaurant.", "author": "Anwar H."}

Not that the tacos are not good. Some of the best in the city. Mainly because of the meat. No other taqueria (authentic) even comes close the quality of meat that they use here. Overall, this place possibly has some of the best burritos and tacos in the planet but... the burritos are tiny. They cost over $10 and if you go at the wrong time, there is a line out the door at this place. \n\nOverall, I find that there are many other places, nearly as good, if not better in ways (e.g. El Farolito or Las Palmas for tacos) where the portions are bigger and the prices are nearly half. That said, this place has become the superstar of taquerias in SF on a global level. They are doing something right. Though is the hype over rated? It always is.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-20", "description": "After deciding to do a taco crawl in the Mission, my friends and I figured we should start with the most heralded spot, La Taqueria. We arrived fairly early, but found ourselves waiting in line with a very eclectic mix of clientele. It was fine though, because it gave us a good amount of time to make our decisions. The place overall is pretty well-kept, and new and improved TV screens as menus is a pretty modern touch on the place. The cashier was very friendly and gives out roses to all the ladies. Not bad.\n\nI was a little hesitant at first at the prospect of paying $6 for a super taco, but it proved to be worth it. The mix of a flour tortilla with a chewy, yet crispy corn tortilla is effing genius. And to be fair, they definitely pack in the meats, cheeses and avocado. Went with the lengua (tongue) and the carnitas. Definitely a must-order. All the meats were tender and juicy, and even though it was very messy, it was quite satisfying.\n\nOverall, a pretty great experience, and La Taqueria more or less lived up to the hype. I can't say that I would be willing to wait in the long lines for it every time, but for the most part, you know you're getting a good product when you come here, and that's really all you can hope for some times.

Then you stand in a non-line where a Spanish speaking customer repeatedly attempted to cut us by... speaking Spanish. You pay the extra exorbitant fee for a super burrito, cause you're in the city and splurging. Then you shut your eyes and order the chips with salsa and guac because you don't want to know how much it'll cost at this point. Pretty sure the cashier just bumped us to the large horchatas without asking too. So don't forget to mention the size you actually want! $40 for two burritos, chips, and two drinks?! They forgot our chips btw and *threw out* the slip already. Didn't want to give them to us! \n\nDidn't realize that they only use pinto beans beforehand--would've asked for no beans. Also, if you're expecting the El Dorado to deliver on a crispy promise? I've done better at home with microwaveable burritos! The meat was lack luster and I didn't have access to the green sauce that might've made it a little more enjoyable. At that point I was making myself finish this insanely expensive meal.

If I ever come back, I am certain to go with El Dorado, because otherwise there didn't seem like anything super unique.\n\nThe taco was very hefty and filling for what I was expecting. The chicken was really juice with some excellent texture. I enjoyed it very much, and probably would pick the tacos over the burritos, based on my visit today.", "author": "Michael Z."}

However, what a M A J O R disappointment.\n\nLet's get one thing straight. I grew up in the heart of the Central Valley. To be specific, Delano. I grew up with tried and true Mexicanos from Jalisco, Guadalajara, Michoacan, Zacatecas, and so on. I'm not trying to say I'm a Mexican food snob, but...okay. Well. Forget it. I'm a Mexican food snob, okay? Mexican food is my comfort food. \n\nWith the exception of San Diego and Los Angeles, most major cities get Mexican food W R O N G.\n\nLet's get into why La Taqueria wasn't the best and why I left thinking I ate seven tons of food:\n\n1. $6 for a \"super\" taco and almost $4 bucks for a regular taco. Uh, no. Where I come from, a super taco is $1.25 ($0.85 on Tuesdays) and a regular taco is $0.75 ($0.50 on Tuesdays)\n\n2. Why in the world would ANYONE mess up a TACO by adding beans, guac, sour cream, and everything but the kitchen sink?! I was NOT impressed by the super taco, nor was I impressed by the regular taco! I enjoyed the semi-crispy tortilla, but I did not enjoy looking like an ogre while I ate. I had food oozing out from the taco, and it was just a terrible eating experience for me. My coworker was just smiling and so happy, and I was sitting there shaking my head wishing I was in Delano or Earlimart getting me some bomb tacos (like, three, for $5). Just give me an unadulterated street taco!!!!!!!! Two mini tortillas, flavorful asada, cilantro, onions. That's it!\n\n3. Ummmm. The meat wasn't that flavorful, guys. Sorry. My meat needs to be seasoned to perfection. I think they pile all those extra toppings to hide the fact that the meat isn't flavorful.\n\nSorry, not sorry. La Taqueria is just another SF place that's been hyped up, and allllll these people who don't know a true taco or burrito if it hit them in the face congregate here just to say they ate at the #1 Taqueria in the nation. Whatever.\n\nYa'll have been duped! \n\nI'm not that cynical, so I'll leave you with some pros:\n1. Fairly fast\n2.

My friends and I arrived for lunch on a weekend to a line out the door; while there was a bit of a wait, we could tell that the assembly line putting together the tacos/burritos was extremely efficient, and there was even someone who took the orders from people waiting in line and wrote them down on a slip of paper, so that everyone could pay right away without wasting time pondering choices in front of the cashier.\n\nMy friends and I got two regular burritos (carne asada and carnitas) to share as well as one taco of beef head (cabeza). We also got chips and salsa, sour cream, and avocado (guacamole) on the side. The regular burritos came with beans (we got pinto), a generous amount of pico de gallo, and the meat of choice. Interestingly, no rice is included, which for me at least, was not a bad thing (much more focus on the meat and taste of the fresh ingredients). Out of everything we tried, the carnitas was probably my favorite--the flavor was distinctively porky, the meat was fall apart tender and very, very juicy. All the burritos went so well with the avocado and the green salsa verde that came on each table. In general, there's something very home-y about the food in this restaurant--perhaps it has to do with the Mexican grandmother figure dolloping up the avocado and sour cream for us, or the freshly fried crisp-yet-chewy tortilla chips with freshly chopped tomatoes and onions. Overall, this was a very satisfying meal and a perfect representation of the SF Mission-style taqueria.", "author": "David K."}

Dorado means \"golden\" in Spanish, and when you ask for your burrito \"dorado\" at La Taqueria, they'll grill it on the hot plate after it's wrapped up. This puts a good burrito over the edge to definitely in the top two burritos (if not THE best) that I've ever had.\n\nI ordered a super carnitas burrito (dorado, obviously) and watched as they assembled it to glean their secrets. I loved how they laid the strip of cheese on the tortilla before warming it up in the warming oven--this made the cheese an even layer of melted gooiness and is something that far more taquerias need to do. The carnitas were superb, the beans were perfect in seasoning and texture, and THERE IS NO RICE! HALLELUJIAH for a more authentic burrito! Really, it's a great burrito top-to-bottom, and having it dorado really takes it over the top. If I had one complaint, it would be that the guacamole was a little underseasoned for my liking, but they're purposely on the more-avocadoey side of the spectrum.\n\nThe salsa is great. The tacos are huge, from what I saw. I was so tempted to drive to the city the next day just to get another burrito here. It was that good.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

At first glance, it's not very impressive looking, but it's not unclean. The crowds are intense during lunch and dinner hours, but the food definitely speaks for itself. As a Los Angeles resident, I generally look down on Mexican cuisine in Nor Cal, but I can vouch for this place. They have a big menu, but you can't go wrong with their tacos or super burritos. When you order, they make it for you as you go along so you can customize your burrito with different kinds of tortillas, meat, beans and salsa. \n\nOf course, the portions are way to big regardless of what you order. Unless you're really hungry might want to split your order. This place is always crowded, even late at night. But once you order, it's really quick.

More often than not, I agree with my fellow Yelp reviewers and come to the same collective rating for restaurants. However, that wasn't the case this time. \n\nMy long time taqueria go-to spot in San Francisco is El Farolito..and it will always and forever stay that way. I kid you not. There's nothing more satisfying than a Super Shrimp Burrito packed with rice, avocado, sour cream, salsa, and some juicy succulent shrimp. Ok, I'm going to stop right there. I'm not reviewing El Farolito's burritos. \n\nBack to my review on La Taqueria. I GET IT. I understand why most reviewers rate this place so high in the star count. It's pretty good..... The meat is tender, well seasoned, and the menu offers this really cool \"dorado style\" option for burritos. This is pretty unique, i must add. Dorado Style consists of a burrito that has all of its fixings wrapped in and then pressed down to give a nice crunchy and toasted crunch to the tortilla. It tasted great and I love the concept! However, it wasn't something so out of this world that knocked my boots off. \n\nMoving on, I wasn't a fan of the tortilla chips and salsa. I know, it's such a small component of this authentic Mexican meal, but c'mon now.. I think La Taqueria could create a better crunch on their tortilla and flavor to their salsa. \n\nAlso, I found the \"order\" and \"pick up\" layout to be quite odd. I'm not a Feng Shui Master by any means, but I couldn't help but notice the flaw! Why is it that you have to squeeze by fellow patrons just to pick up your order? The pick up location is smacked in the middle of the line. There isn't a flow to the restaurant and it just seemed rather awkward.\n\nAll in all...

Yes, there's a line out of the door pretty much all the time and they have secret things on the menu, but I've just found the meat to be rather tasteless & the burrito a bit dry. I prefer Pancho Villa (16th and Mission) over this place, plus they have a killer salsa bar.\n\nLocation: 25th & Mission - easy to get to via BART or the 14.\nFood: Tacos, burritos ($8.50), quesadillas.  You can get a super burrito ($10.90) which includes sour cream, avocado, and cheese (perhaps this is less dry than the regular one)\nMeat selection: Carne asada, pork (carnitas), beef head (cabeza), beef tongue (lengua), sausage (chorizo), or chicken. The vegetarian option is beans, cheese, and salsa.\n\nBurritos: I've gotten both the carnitas and pollo burrito. They don't put rice in the burritos, so just beware if you like this in your burritos. I find it a bit bland with just the meat, beans, and salsa. Maybe I need to get the \"Super\" burrito, but I find the meat to be lacking in flavor / spices as well, so not sure how much of a better option that is. It's also $11, which is much pricier than other burrito places in the Mission offering something similar. There's no salsa that comes with this if you get it to-go, which is disappointing to me. There's one salsa option on the tables if you dine-in.\n\nSecret Menu: You can get the burritos grilled -- \"Dorado\" style -- just ask for it when you order.\n\nPayment & Seating: Cash only, so be prepared. Wait in line (typically ~10 min, the line moves quickly), then pay for your food and try to snag a table. It gets quite crowded in there, and coming with a group of more than 4 people may be hard to get a table unless you're there really early or late.\n\nOverall, I still come here because it's convenient, but I don't think it's my favorite burrito.

She gives you the order sheet and you take it to the register where you pay.  Then you get a number that they call once your order is ready.  CASH ONLY CASH ONLY CASH ONLY!\n\nFirst and foremost, YELP please change this place to $$ not $.  Don't believe me, take a look at the photo of the menu.  It's not your typical cheap Mexican food joint.  Some lady ended up spending +$54 dollars here for 3 people.  We spent $24 for 3 items.\n\nI had the regular burrito with chorizo and a regular beef taco.  The chorizo is not spicy and very messy - greasy.  It's good, but I've had better.  The burrito is a good size, comes with meat, beans, and pico de gallo.  A super burrito has the regular + sour cream, cheese, and avocado.  The taco meat was also very good - super tender.  Overall, the food NEEDED the hot sauce, because there's not a whole lot going on here.  The food here is very meaty and lack depth to be honest.  Everything here all kind of taste the same.  Hot sauce made things better.\n\nMy gf had the flour quesadilla with carnitas (pork).  The quesadilla was very disappointing, mainly because of the pork.  The pork is really nothing special, it's just cooked.  No special seasoning or sauce with it.  We are used to greasy orange LA pork with loads of flavor and depth.  \n\nOverall, this place is just A-OK 3/5 stars.  The food is pricey, come on guys, it's Mexican food.  We all know Mexican food is not that expensive...  Yeah, I know, it's SF, but I've been to other places where the prices are no where like this.  We would not come back, but are glad to finally find out that the HYPE...is just really... HYPE =).", "author": "Kevin N."}

I imagine this happens because it frequently appears in local and national lists of best Mexican Eats in the country.\n\nI'm afraid I have to come down on the \"hate\" side of things. La Taqueria is definitely on my bottom list of burrito proprietors in San Francisco and with so many tastier options in the city I don't think I'll ever be back.\n\nReally it comes down to two things: the food is really flat on flavors and you usually have to wait a pretty long time to obtain it. \n\nCarne Asada really lives or dies on the marination and here the meat is more comparable to the marginal taste of chains. When you get a San Diego style Carne Asada burrito (yes, I know this is the Mission, just keep reading) where the meat has been prepared just right you don't need a bunch of other ingredients clouding up the mix, and that's why people love those foot-long solid meat torpedoes. Otherwise, you really need to balance out inferior meat with other dynamic ingredients so that the mix brings out the taste and texture of combination rather than just concentrating on the lower quality beef. Here you get flat flavors with boring meat wrapped up in a mushy, uncooked tortilla.\n\nPersonally I think nearby El Farolito and Taqueria Guadalajara both destroy this place.", "author": "Matt M."}

There was a good 20 minute wait to order, but there was a lady taking down the order down the line to make it go by quicker.\n\nI wasn't too hungry, but my friend told me that it would be a crime if I came here and didn't order the burrito. So I ordered the Carne Asada Super Burrito ($10), Mango Agua Fresca ($3.50), and Corn Quesadilla ($3). To start off, the quesadilla was extremely disappointing. It was nothing but a tortilla and some melted cheese that even a toddler can make. Maybe I really need to make it super with the extra guacamole, cheese, and sour cream. On the other hand, the burrito was truly amazing. Be sure to get it Diablo style and Super. I've never had such a stuffed and tasty burrito. The fried outside gave it such a crisp texture and made sure my burrito was warm all around. The flavors of the meat and ingredients was overpowering enough for me to not hate the fact that there were beans inside my burrito (I forgot to ask to leave them out as I don't like beans at all). Finally, their agua fresca was delicious as well. It was full in flavor and you truly taste the mango used to make it.", "author": "Cindy Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-10", "description": "This is THE most overrated and overpriced taqueria in SF. By far. No competition! I specifically ordered my super burrito non-dorado style, because I like to compare apples to apples. If I'm going to compare this place to El Faralito or Vallarta or Cancun (the big 3), I'm going to compare a super burrito to a super burrito, not a dorado-style burrito to a super burrito. \n\nThe result: an oppressively average burrito. Had the feeling of a home-made burrito or one that you put together at a cafeteria from pre-made ingredients. AKA, a lose aggregate of ingredients jumbled together in an uninspired way, without the correct proportions or execution. Did I mention the burrito is small? For $12, I would expect this burrito to at least make for a decent meal, but it sure doesn't. I swear I had to go hunt down a post-burrito slice of pizza - that is not something I've ever thought I'd have to do after eating a BURRITO. \n\nWorst of all, is you get to wait in one of the most disorganized lines I've ever encountered, not just for a taqueria, but any food establishment. The line snakes around tables and gets in the way of people accessing trash bins and employees accessing the tables. The pickup zones are completely erratic and totally mixed up with the order-line, creating a total circus. \n\nDid I mention the food sucks? There is nothing, and I repeat, nothing, special about this burrito. The tortilla is average. The beans are average. The carne-asada is below-average (taste is okay, but it is not thrown on the grill, it is just steamed for hours and thrown on the burrito, cafeteria style). That is not the mark of \"the best taqueria in the US\". There is NO RICE. Which is okay, in principle, but then you have to ask yourself the question: \"does the rest of the burrito make up for lack of rice?\" The answer is an emphatic \"NO\". Unlike well-executed San Diego style burritos (which usually have no rice or beans), there is not copious amounts of ridiculously tasty carne-asada or french fries. There is simply NO RICE, with nothing to make up for it. That is one of the reasons the burritos are so small - rice is used as a filler ingredient and takes up like 25-30% of a normal Mission style burrito. The should rename these burritos to \"rolled-super-tacos\". And change the price to $5. Now that I could understand! \n\nUntil that happens, I suggest you do your schedule and your wallet a BIG favor and go down the street to Taqueria Cancun, Vallarta, or El Faralito!", "author": "Leo G."}

The super is $2.50 more expensive, and you get: guacamole, sour cream, and cheese. I usually prefer the super version, because it is much easier than adding extras one by one to my regular burrito. \n\nI have only tried their carnitas and carne asada. They are both very well seasoned, tender; however, carnitas is my favorite because it is just so flavorful, and it melts in your mouth. \n\nThere is not much to say about this place, as people who are big fan of Mission burrito scene are already familiar with this place. But, my recommendation to you first timers here is: go dorado or go home. With dorado, they grill your burrito at the end, so that the tortilla becomes golden and crispy.\n\nDuring lunch time the place gets super crowded so be aware of that, and also this place is CASH ONLY.", "author": "Ashkan H."}

Seems like so many other options locally that this place will head to the bottom of the list.\n\nChips and salsa was disappointing as the salsa was a bit bland and they dumped it on top of the chips which basically made them soggy - came with some seriously hot grilled peppers too.  Don't make a mistake and eat one of these.  Kids loved the quesadillas, so these are clearly a standout.\n\nPlace is mobbed - probably about 100 people in there on a Saturday afternoon which made sitting a challenge and overall not an enjoyable eating experience.\n\nEl Farolito won Esquire's burrito fan vote.  Will have to try there next.", "author": "Bob K."}

My fiance and I waited in one line for two minutes, then were persuaded by other customers to move to another line, only to be told by the cashiers that our original line was the line to order from. Despite the confusion by us and many other customers, a fairly long wait, and having to walk down the street to find a spot to sit because the place was so packed, I still couldn't be happier with the experience. We ordered one carne asada and one carnitas burrito. The carne asada burrito was the best burrito I've ever had, and the carnitas was second. Seriously, the meats were perfectly cooked; everything was fresh...I have absolutely no complaints. If I lived in San Francisco, I hate to think about how many of these bad boys I would inevitably eat.", "author": "Jared W."}

Quite possibly the best burrito I've ever had, except it's still neck in neck with Anna'a Taqueria in Boston. Anyway, west coast Mexican is definitely a lot better than what we have out east and this seems to be THE place, in MIssion at least. We came around 3pm and yes the line was long but it moves fast and have your partner grab a seat upon arrival.  We both got burritos- I, the pollo and my fiance the carnitas. Both meats were very well braised and tender but I'd argue the pork was a little better just because it was better seasoned. But the tortillas and the way everything came together was awesome- steamed, warm tortillas, awesome rice, sour cream, beans, guac & plenty of it (you have to ask for it \"super\") for the fixings.  Portions are big here.\n\nPerhaps the most underrated but best things were tortilla chips, salsa/guac. They were handmade, thick and super authentic. Their hot sauce is also really good too- the green stuff.\n\nService is quick, fast and prices are cheap.  I got some horchata to wash everything down too and it was really good- sweet and cinamony.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

Should I have come 30 mins later, I would be almost the 30th person lining outside the place - that gives you an idea how much traffic this place gets. \n\nSo here's how it works. You go and get in line, then a waitress will take your order and give you an order slip. Then you stay in line and pay at the cashier. After you pay, just wait for your order. It took me around 30 mins from getting in line to pay, and another 15 mins for the food to come.\n\n-) Pork Burrito Super Size: A. It wasn't like any burrito I have ever tried. So memorable. Reasons:\n1. Juiciness. Lots of juice from the ingredients; super moist.\n2. Crispiness. This is the magical part. Make sure you ask for extra grill time when you order it - it totally worths the wait because it makes the tortilla semi-crispy; and together with the juicy ingredients, you will totally feel that's the perfect match right there. And the extra grill time make the sour cream even better with its cheesiness type of feeling!\n3. The Braised Pork was WOW. Super tender, and it's actually a bit towards the salty side but that was perfectly fine because of sour cream and guacamole balance it out.\n\nDon't worry about the super size, it's not that super but it does fill you up without you knowing it because your brain and mouth will be busy enjoying the great taste of it.\n\nIt totally worth the wait. There are quite a lot of seats actually but no doubt it was fully packed during peak hours. Man, that was very good. I'm gonna try their tacos next time! Can't wait!", "author": "Simon C."}

Then insults me (unwittingly, I assume) by saying, \"In 43 years, this is your first time here?!\" *grabs heart* I don't look a day over 29 (in my dreams) & I was carded just last month! To clarify, he was surprised I'd never eaten there in the 43 years they've been in business, but obviously he struck a chord with me.

The large pieces of chopped-up steak were tender & mostly lean. The other two tacos weren't as praise-worthy with chicken being bland & carnitas being not adequately crispy. Expect big prices to accompany generous portions (we paid $25 for the above), & to pay extra for guac, sour cream, & cheese. \n\nLooking forward to trying their burritos & tacos \"El Dorado\" style (fried & crispy.)

No parking, it's not climate controlled (as there's not really a door), it's crowded, loud, it's hard to find a seat, the seats are just these tiny individual benches, the tables aren't super clean, they don't take credit cards,  $12 for two tacos is absurdly expensive, but the food at this restaurant makes up for its shortcomings.\n\n5 stars for the food, 2 stars for everything else, but I'm feeling good today (due to those great tacos) so this place gets 5-stars anyways.", "author": "Andrew H."}

Our bill was $22; a bit expensive, considering our normal Mexican food bill is less than $15. \n\nGot our food and we couldn't wait.  Carne asada taco with everything was good, but fairly comparable to the tacos I get at my local taqueria.  My carnita taco was too dry and I barely ate half before giving it to my boyfriend.  Both tacos were loaded with meat, but they weren't exceptionally tender or flavorful.  My boyfriend liked the dorado style, but overall, he thought it was just okay.

If you asked someone where is the best burrito served in the city, chances are you would get multiple answers. In any case I finally got here and gave it a shot. First impression for me is that its got to be amazing. They have a long line, they got someone serenading folks while they gorge on tacos, and don't forgot that trademark of CASH ONLY. Just looking around makes you eager for you to get yours. They have a pretty good system here and that system means its organized. They have someone taking your order on a paper and once you get the register you just pay, and they serve your food out pretty quick. \n\nSo I got my burrito to go because I had somewhere to be. I also order chips and salsa on the side too. TBH I felt like i got cheated with the guac and pico because they only gave me one of each in the small sauce containers, while others who dined in got mounds of that stuff. Maybe i ordered the wrong thing? Any who, thats not my I came. So I finally get into my burrito. I ordered a carne asada super burrito. The burrito is a smaller than I anticipated... the meat was good, I can tell the guac was fresh but it was more on the bland side. The burrito was cool, its not bad, but it wasn't memorable. It didn't have spanish rice? The only upside I can think to myself while eating this burrito is that it wasn't greasy and it has a lot of meat. So for me the burrito here gets the job done, but I probably won't order another burrito here.\n\nSo if you're headed here to grab a burrito just consider these things.\nIf you like big burritos, not in here\nIf you shrimp and steak at the same time, not here\nSpanish rice inside, not here.\nNot open late.\n\nThey also don't have a full menu of Mexican food here either.

The crowd is always spilling out the door, and even though there's lots of seating it can be difficult to get a spot.

I went for a super burrito with carne asada (rice, pico, cheese, sour cream, guac). \n\nHere's the part where I analyze a burrito in excruciating detail: excellent tortilla wrapping technique. Any burrito aficionado understands that this is crucial. Ingredients were standard. Guac was on point, obviously fresh avocados and they didn't skimp slathering it on. The steak was really juicy and flavorful, but I had quite a few tough/fatty bites which always sucks. Didn't ruin the otherwise strong burrito for me, though.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-02", "description": "I'm sorry to say it San Diego, but I think that San Francisco makes a far superior burrito.  This has always confused me, because one would think there would be a correlation between distance from the border, and quality of Mexican food.  Perhaps it is because burritos aren't actually Mexican food, or maybe it is because San Francisco tends to do food, in general, better than everyone else.\n\nI am a huge fan of the Mission style burrito.  I have tried several locations, and I think La Taqueria is the best of the bunch.  The ingredients taste a little more quality here than some of the other joints around the Mission, but you still get a good layer of grease to satisfy your late night cravings. \n\nThe super burrito (avocado, cheese, beans, sour cream) is the way to go here.  I'm a big fan of their carnitas.  They manage to make them  juicy and crispy all at the same time.  What makes La Taqueria stand out, is that they have the option to grill your burrito.  This gives it a slightly crispy shell, almost like a chimichanga.  I highly recommend it.\n\nThe prices are high here, but you can't fault the business for neighborhood gentrification.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-24", "description": "Alright, so, let me give you a little background first about my experience when it comes to burritos. I've been on a burrito diet more or less since my college days. Most of the burritos I ate before moving to the San Francisco area were from Fresno or Los Angeles/San Diego. It wasn't until a year ago that I tried my first ever burrito here, in The Mission. Sadly, I was not impressed.\n\nI've only had the super carne asada burrito at La Taqueria (the same type of burrito I order just about anywhere). It's okay. It's not bad, but just not great. Also keep in mind that while I'm not a fan, there were people in my group who still stick to their guns that La Taqueria crafts the finest burrito they've ever had. This isn't a MONSTER burrito like the kind you'll find in San Diego, and that's not a bad thing. A burrito shouldn't rely on being over-sized to achieve greatness. What this burrito really lacks is: \n\n1. flavorful carne asada. You barely notice it while eating the burrito \n2. a stickier tortilla. A great tortilla can really save the day. These are fine, but lack character. Not sticky, not particularly fluffy, not charred in just the right way, just meh\n3. pinto beans are an unwelcome addition to a burrito in my book. They take up prime tortilla real estate and leave a huge dripping mess out the bottom of the burrito (messes are fine for certain things, not pinto beans)\n4. spicy salsa. The salsa they have on hand has zero kick to it. It's a sad day when I feel like I should have brought my own bottle of El Yucateco.\n\nOther Mission style burritos I've tried have been similarly okay. La Taqueria is also a mad house. Every time I've been here there's been a line around the building and a very long wait for tables (usually about 30 minutes). For this long of a wait, in my opinion, the burrito just isn't worth the effort.", "author": "William P."}

However, it's still pretty damn good.\n\nSo I've only tried two things here -- the carne asada burrito, and the carnitas burrito, both done \"dorado style\", which means they griddle the burrito after they wrap it, giving it a nice crispy outside. It's different, and the crispiness of the tortilla means it cracks and leaks out its contents so you may have to fork-and-knife it, but it's absolutely delicious.\n\nIs it the best burrito in the world? I'm not sure about that, especially considering I spent 7+ years down in San Diego (El Cotixan's California burrito is probably my absolute favorite of all time), but for SF, this is pretty damn good.

Survey the menu and figure out what you want (don't worry, you can't go wrong) asap because a waitress may take your order before you reach the front of the line. Remain in the line and pay when you reach the cashier. Try not to ask complicated questions and always tip extravagantly. Credit cards are not accepted but there is an atm at the back of the restaurant on the left hand side. After you pay for your food, take your receipt, note the number and have a seat. Be patient, your number will be called in 5 or 10 minutes. \n\nBecause the owner personally oversees the restaurant (he's the gentleman with the moustache, wrapping your tacos and calling your number), you'll always experience friendly service, fast-moving lines and the fantastic food that makes this THE place to get your Mission-style burritos and tacos. \n\nI usually order chicken tacos with avocado and whole pinto beans. Don't expect deep-fried corn tortillas--they're steamed and soft, not crispy, unless you order crispy tortillas (a special not on the menu). Ask for some pico de gallo (finely-chopped fresh tomato and onion) and douse your tacos (and everything else) with La Taqueria's spicy salsa verde (green sauce), which appears to be tomatillo-based. This dinner is my idea of comfort food heaven. When I really want to go wild, I get the carnitas (shredded pork) tacos, which are savory, salty, porky and addictive. My husband gets the carne asada burrito with black beans and avocado and a melon drink. La Taqueria's burritos are big, but not the gigantic log-like burritos served up in other taquerias because they're pared down to the essentials, not loaded with rice and gloppy sauces. \n\nIf the line is out the door, simply walk to Mission Pie (the Mission's best-kept secret), a few feet away at the corner of Mission and 25th Streets, and have a beer and a very different and delicious lunch or dinner, such as pork with green chile over brown rice, with steamed greens, followed by banana cream pie. Or try Old Jerusalem, a middle eastern restaurant across the street, one block down, between 25th and 26th. You can't go wrong in this part of the hood.", "author": "Julie B."}

Time, the first, we came while visiting during the holidays only to discover the place shuttered with a sign saying they'd given their employees a week-long-or-so Christmas break. \n\nNot deterred our second visit, which involved having to try again later in the day due to a street festival in the morning and no parking for miles, we went ahead and stood in the half-hour-long line to order. It was the Sunday before Memorial Day, and they had signs they would be closed for that as well. We were leaving town Monday, so it was now or never. \n\nHere's some tips about them so far: \n- They are CLOSED during holidays. \n- Plan to take public transit to get here if you have terrible luck finding parking.\n- Lines to get in are fairly long.  \n- CASH ONLY. Be prepared. \n- Do NOT expect to find a seat. If you do manage to snag one, understand that you will have about 200 strange butts hovering around your food and face, as they idle around the room.  \n\nWe each got super-sized burritos, dorados-style. Mr. D got chorizo; I got carnitas. They were actually fairly small (roughly the same girth as a Del Taco epic burrito, if not slightly bigger.) Making your burrito \"super\" just adds sour cream, avocado, and cheese and knocks the price per burrito up over $10. \n\nMaking your burrito \"dorados\" style is something you have to specially request, in which they throw your made burrito onto the griddle to crisp some more, thus warming and liquifying the insides. \n\nEating in the car, to keep warm in the frigid evening, my super carnitas dorado burrito erupted in juices from both ends and the sides, bukkakeing all over the place, unable to contain itself. Oddly, though, I think I'd still have preferred the beans were mashed and not whole, as they were. Flavor-wise, it was OK. \n\nWorth trying, but both Mr. D and I agree we've had better burritos in the Mission, let alone the rest of America.", "author": "Christine A."}

The restaurant is very clean.They have bottles of chile on the tables. \n\nCONS: My tastebuds started with a biased taste from El Farolito, so I automatically compared their burritos with them. With roughly the same price, you can head over there for a bigger burrito. \n\nOverall, I liked the amount of seating and the  cleanliness of the restaurant.

I came here on a Sunday night with a friend who was visiting from our of town. When we arrived there was a line that stretched out the door, but luckily the crew inside worked fairly quickly, so you were able to place your order and wait on the side for your food to be ready.\n\nFinding a seat in this restaurant is hard. You're almost better off ordering the food to go and eating in your car or back at home (if you don't live too far). But the food is amazing. Out of all of the meats on their menu, my favorite by far was their carne asada. It doesn't matter if you order it in the form of a burrito or a taco, the carne asada at this place is cooked to absolute perfection.\n\nMaybe it's the way they smoke the meat or barbecue it, but whatever it is, when you actually bit into it, it gives a distinct smoky taste, while at the same time accentuating the meat flavor from the beef. It is by far the best and most well made taco meat I have had in San Francisco.\n\nCombine that with a Mexican Coke or a Modelo and it makes for one amazing meal.

The service seemed rushed, but let's be honest, you're here for the burritos and the rushed service means the line goes faster. \n\nWe ordered 1 regular carne asada burrito ($7) with extra meat (extra $1.20) and 1 veggie burrito (~$3.50 for a huge burrito!) for roughly $13. Once we ordered, we were handed a ticket and waited in the sitting area. The burrito collection process was a hectic one to say the least. They call out numbers in a seemingly haphazard order. I was number 8 and I heard 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 4, 5, and then finally 8? Note: pay attention to the numbers they call out.\n\nWe were planning on taking the burritos to go, but once we got our food that plan went out the window. It was a massive burrito packed with meat, beans, and pico de gallo in every bite. They also had a green jalepeno sauce of some kind which added a nice kick to the burrito. If I had to list a con, it would probably be that the beans were a bit watery and that made the bottom of the burrito kind of soggy. This was a bigger problem for the veggie burrito since the main ingredient in those are the beans.

They all swear by its amazingness. Even my lead at work, a fellow Mexican, says this place is legit. Yet, I left disappointed after my visit.\n\nWhat happened? I don't know! The flavors just didn't come together properly like I'm used to in Mexico. Everything tasted fine, but none of it reminded me of Mexico, and none of it was worth me coming back for another visit.\n\nI ordered:\n\n- Carnitas taco (regular): definitely the best out of the 3 tacos I got. They add pinto beans to the taco, which actually worked pretty well with the carnitas. The meat was juicy and tender (not fried to hell, like some other places) with good flavor.\n\n- Asada taco (regular): OK, but that's it. The meat tasted like it had no marinade at all. Actually, I tasted the char more than I tasted the meat. But at least the meat wasn't overcooked and chewy.\n\n- Lengua taco (regular): OK. Meat was very tender and juicy, but lacked any flavor. This is the only taco to come out traditionally, with just onion and cilantro. All the other tacos I ordered came with different non-standard fillings (e.g. pinto beans, pico the gallo, etc).\n\nThe salsa verde you find on every table was good and strongly recommended for your tacos. My tacos did not come with lime (an insult), and I did not bother asking for any for fear of losing my table. Also, the tacos are BIG (filling-wise). 3 were enough for me.\n\nNone of the tacos reminded me of my childhood or any of the flavors I grew up experiencing over my summers in Mexico. Were they bad? No. But, did they satisfy my taco craving? No. These tacos just left me reminiscing for Mexico.\n\nA few notes to readers:\n- I spent most of my summers in Mexico City, so I can't speak for regional taco differences (e.g. tacos in Northern Mexico may more closely resemble what's sold here).\n- Everyone ordered a burrito, and everyone else ordered quesadillas. Very few people were eating tacos from what I could see.", "author": "Karl R."}

However, they do have some amazing pinto beans and carne asada.  And I'm not even a fan of pinto beans!  \n\nThe first time we came here, which was a couple of weeks ago, they gave us a sampling of their taco with our order.  He ordered the regular burrito with chicken but he was not happy with the chicken and found it to be boring.  He also had a side of their pinto beans, which he loved.  I had the regular burrito with carne asada and we were both delighted with it.  The carne asada was full of flavor, juicy and addicting.  \n\nLast evening was our second time, and we ordered their tacos--I had two regular and one super (sour cream, avocado & cheese) taco with carne asada.  Their tacos are unique... hard shell inside, and then wrapped with the soft shell outside.   (I did request crispy, just in case.)  And let's just say that I barely got through 1 super taco and 1 regular taco before I gave up and took home the remaining 1 regular taco (which was reheated for lunch today and still delicious!!) \n\nHe ordered the super burrito with whole pinto beans (they offer refried beans) and carne asada with spicy salsa.  He was much happier with the carne asada than the chicken from the first time.  He also had a regular taco with carne asada. \n\nThe green sauce on the tables and throughout the place = spicy.  Delicious but it's got a lot of heat.  \n\nDrinks = fountain sodas, beer, agua frescas, hot tea and milk.  I tried the tamarindo, which was delicious but not as tart as I'd like it.  (Can't help my tastebuds!!)\n\nPrices = moderate.  We ordered 3 regular tacos, 1 super taco, 1 super burrito, 1 large Coke and 1 small/regular tamarindo and the total came out to just under $34.00.   Bring CASH.\n\nTheir burritos don't have rice so it's not as huge as most of us are used to in SF, but it's worth a try.  Their tacos are hearty, so make sure you've got the appetite, or you'll end up with leftovers.\n\nHonestly, it's worth the money, as their carne asada is high quality, full of flavor, has very little gristle/fat, juicy, and great seasoning! (I know they have other meat offerings but we're sticking to what they're great at--carne asada!)\n\nSeating = they have indoor and outdoor seating.  We've only been here around dinner time, so it gets packed but you can find a seat or two. \n\nParking = street parking.  It's in the Mission.  Plenty of bike parking and the buses do stop nearby, and it's about 1 block from 24th Mission BART.  \n\nMy only complaint is the way they organize the line... it's a bit messy when they're busy.

When entering, I found all of the seats taken and a bunch of people standing around either waiting in line or waiting on their order; honestly, it was pretty hard to tell where the end of the line was. It ended up being at the very back of the restaurant, winding its way to the bathrooms.\n\nThe wait in line wasn't actually that long since the restaurant seems to be fairly efficient taking and making orders; they better be with so many customers. I ordered a carne asada super burrito, dorado style (as suggested by many other Yelpers) and to my surprise the cost was nearly $12!!!! Now, for a taqueria, this is pretty expensive in my opinion. I've had plenty of excellent super burritos around the area for $7 or $8, but have not seen the price go into double digits very often...Even in Palo Alto, where everything is much more expensive, $12 for a burrito would be considered a bit much.\n\nConsidering the price and the reputation, I had pretty high expectations for my burrito. Once I picked it up and unwrapped it, I found a deliciously-looking, golden-crusted piece of food that I was ready to devour. Ordering the burrito dorado style was definitely a positive; the extra grilling that they do gives the tortilla a nice crispy texture that works well with the filling. Other than this, though, I found the burrito to be just OK. It wasn't particularly spectacular to me. Everything was quite delicious, but since my expectations were raised by the price and what I had heard, I was a bit underwhelmed in the end.\n\nI definitely recommend trying out the place and ordering your burrito dorado style, but if you're looking for great burritos at a cheaper price (as burritos should be!), look elsewhere.

It is always tasty and hit the spot for me for a solid week back when I was pregnant (if you've never been pregnant that sounds disgusting but if you have been - you get it.   \n\nWe came earlier today for my mom's birthday and it was as good as ever.  My sons and nephew devoured their first ever tacos from La Taqueria (regular carnitas and chicken for them).  My hubs loved his super carnitas burrito as did my mother - she's super health conscious and eats like a bird but she downed this burrito.  I had a pair of super tacos.   The carne asada is always seasoned well, the chicken is always tender, the lengua and cabeza are also tasty.  However, the carnitas at this place are the best I've had ever.   \n\nOrder the tacos dorados otherwise you'll end up with a mess.   The aguas frescas are also really good; strawberry, pineapple, watermelon, mango - you can't go wrong.  I can't speak to the vegetarian options bc well, I'm not a vegetarian.   Oh and the people complaining about no rice in the burritos are nuts - that's just filler and dries out the rest of the burrito.   El Farolito can keep their lettuce and rice, I'll take La Taqueria any day.", "author": "c c."}

It was probably the most delightful pair of Mexican goodness I've ever encountered.

The place was packed, but we were able to find two seats at the counter outside. We each had a super burrito, one carne asada and one chicken. The meat was excellent on each - very luscious and largely sliced, but for a $10 burrito - I wasn't too impressed. The burrito comes with pinto beans, fresh salsa, a bit of gauc, sour cream and no rice. It just felt a little limp and lifeless. Kind of like getting a grande burrito from taco bell, that kind of not-so-dense feeling. It was good, but it wasn't as filling as a super burrito should be. I did like the salsa verde available on each table, and the small fountain soda for $1.50 isn't too bad. \n\nI'd rather try a nearby taqueria next time than come back again.. just yet.\nThis place is also cash only!\n\nAnd, it was my first time here and it was a little confusing on how to order. There's a long line in the front that starts at the register to the back, with a woman who stands on the customer side of the counter to take your oder on a pad, to which you go up and pay. But in between, there's two pick up stations where they call your number that intersects the line.", "author": "Ravo Y."}

That said, i found the burrito a-ok. Nothing special as one may be led to believe based on the ratings. \n\nI had the chorizo regular burrito. I like the mission style (no rice) but besides that the meat was good and the rest of the ingredients are about what you get at every taqueria. The tortilla was fine, i was hoping for the fresh hand rolled tortillas which have a warm fluffiness to them but they tasted nothing like that. The tomatillo based picante salsa was also good but nothing special. \n\nOn the price side, this place is a bit ridiculous for a taqueria. $8.50 for a regular burrito is as expensive as it gets even for SF. \n\nPerhaps i dont have an appreciation for the historical significance of this place (having invented the mission style burrito and all) but i could not help but feel like this place is just overhyped.", "author": "Aditya J."}

Unfortunately i don't like beans, so when you ask for no beans they charge you extra.. because they don't use rice in their burritos. So their logic is well we're putting more meat in there.

At the Mission, we explored Clarion Alley, Balmy Murals, Mission Pie, and of course La Taqueria. We split a veggie burrito (they don't do California burritos here sadface) and it was for a cheap price, but I don't remember exactly how much. We took ours to go, and at them on the way back to our parking spot and through Clarion Alley. \n\nI wouldn't say that this was the best veggie burrito I've ever had...but the tortilla was probably one of the best. Too bad the to-go foil was sticking to my burrito, and I had hella struggles trying to make sure I didn't ingest any. BUT quality-wise, the burrito was golden...but i wasn't my \"TOP 3 MOST OMG BURRITOS\" I've ever had. Maybe veggie isn't the way to go, so I wouldn't say La Taq is my favorite Mexican spot in Mission.\n\nIt's super quick if you want to order and leave. Dining in is kind of awkward, since it's a crowded space, people are always coming in and out, and the food staff just stare at you as they make the food. Service is smiley and str8up 100% Mexican.

Nay. It was insanely packed. One thing to note about this place is that seating is a free-for-all situation. On top of that, the enormously long line winds around the dining area, making for a really cramped eating situation.\n\nThe regular burrito comes with your choice of meat, rice, beans, and pico de gallo. Since the super burrito comes highly recommended, I went ahead and ordered their super carne asada burrito which comes with a hefty price tag hovering somewhere around $10 bucks. The super burrito comes packed with good, charbroiled carne asada, beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, and cheese. I thought the meat was flavorful, but it was a little sinewy with some bites. The thing is, the burrito was good because of all of the extra fixings and to be honest, nothing could possibly taste that bad if its heaped with guacamole, sour cream, and cheese. It was a good burrito, but not what all these reviews rave about. \n\nI waited maybe, 45 minutes to order my food. Add another 20 minutes to get my burrito.

They would be the best in the United States if they\nwould just add rice, yes thats right no rice???\nFor Burrito's i go to La Tapatia  in South San Francisco, CA. they make all the tortilla's for all the restaurants in the bay Area. both are a 5 star places.", "author": "Greg R."}

The food and the drinks were fresh and delicious - cooked to right temperature and mixed well.  The salsa was just the right mixture and texture of onions, chilis, tomatoes, vinegar, and whatever else would be in there.

The staff was smiling and the owner was there entertaining and welcoming all the customers.  He was down-to-earth and loving with people.  He cut roses for two little girls.  He was caring to few elder folks.  He noticed a woman waiting for table clean-up and called in his staff right away to do that.  He laughed with people in line.  What a passionate man!\n\nThe tourists even know about this place.  We met a woman who had been coming here for 30yrs!  The place shows numerous awards - it is also Zagat rated.\n\nIt can get noisy with the crowd and seats hard to find at peak times - so plan on being able to eat by standing or take food to a local park.

Mexican food is one of my favorites, so I was so excited to try this place out. \n\n20 minutes and approx. $10 later (for 2 stinking tacos and a dollop of guac?), we were left with disappointment.  The tacos were just so bland and lacking of flavor.  I appreciate when Mexican food is not over-salted; that's one mistake a lot of places make.  But this place was the other extreme; it just needed something, anything to bring out the flavor.  So alas, we're still on the hunt to find the ultimate \"street food Mexican\" we've were hoping for. (Note: we did think \"maybe we don't get the hype because we tried the tacos vs. burritos\" - but our friends who have tried both have told us that while the hype is around the burritos, the tacos are much better.

The famed \"best burrito in the world.\" And I'm sorry to say, but I left disappointed.\n\nDon't get me wrong- the restaurant was bustling with energy and waiting in line with views of the kitchen wasn't a bad way to spend 10 minutes. Massive bowls of pico de gallo and seasoned carne asada waiting to hit the grill led me to believe the prophecy that yes, this would be the best burrito of my life.\n\nOn top of the sights and smells, the owner is beyond charming. For it being my first visit, I not only received a free order of chips and salsa but also a free chorizo quesadilla and a rose! What a way to start the meal. \n\n10 minutes later when my fateful burrito arrived, my spirits plunged. I had ordered a dorado (grilled) super (add avocado, sour cream, cheese) burrito with chorizo and carne asada and no beans. You know how you sometimes take your first burrito bite to find the ingredients disappointingly stacked in clumps. Well, that's what I thought at first was the case when I noticed there was no avocado, chorizo, pico de gallo, or sour cream. Until I took 3 more bites to realize that no these ingredients weren't hiding, they were completely missing!! Of all 6 ingredients I ordered, they only managed to include 2. Yes, I paid $14 for a burrito that consisted of carne asada, beans, and cheese. \n\nBecause they had been so generous and welcoming, I would have felt like a complete behotch returning my disappointing burrito and so sucked it up, my burrito-loving soul dying a bit with each bland ingredient-missing bite. Yes, yes, I should have spoken up rather than bitch about it on yelp. But for unnecessarily expensive burritos and a 20 minute wait, no one should have to suffer the disappointment of receiving the wrong order.\n\nTaking a step back from my crushed burrito loving soul, I will say the few ingredients I DID receive were well prepared. I didn't LOVE the carne asada, although I could tell it was of high quality, and did not care for the beans, but the grilled dorado tortilla was fantastic. Also the free quesadilla was ridiculously good.\n\nI will definitely give La Taqueria another try, albeit with a little caution and more backbone.

Also for how much they charge they give VERY little, the quantity is small. The chicken taco was a huge disappointment.

Seriously, the place literally had 30 people in line, so my boyfriend and I thought that it *had* to be good! After waiting about 15-20 minutes, we ordered the carne asada super burrito, a carnitas super burrito with a mango agua and it took maybe 10 minutes for our numbers to be called out.

After reading reviews, I now know that they don't add rice in their burritos. The horror! Also, the menu can be quite confusing since they add when you subtract some ingredients.

Maybe an affordable, satisfying heavy carbed and meat filled comfort-food.  A combination of fresh ingredients that mix perfectly together.\n\nWell what La Taqueria serves as a burrito doesn't meet any of the expectations mentioned above but maybe freshness.  In fact I left slightly offended by what they tried to serve me. La Taqueria totally struck out in my book, it's the flipping Jose Canseco of burrito joints.\n\nStrike one: its hella expensive.  And I'm just gonna say it because this is the truth, it's a hipster Taqueria.   I expect to see at least one Latino representative to patronize any Taqueria I go to in the mission, but no, if you look at the clientele you would think the zip code here is 90210.\n\nStrike Two:  El Burrito is hella small. Or should I say \"peque\u00f1o!\"  I finished it in 8 bites.  Thats right ladies and gentleman, I'm not Joey Chestnut but watching me eat this burrito, you guys would have sent me on the next flight to Coney Island next 4th of July.  I left hungry and a little annoyed.  \n\nStrike Three:  the taste was average.  I paid for an over - priced,  small burrito.

In fact, that's the only thing that saved it from getting a one star review. \n\nSee, the problem is that place has gotten so much attention recently that they have huge crowds. I'm talking line all the way around the store and out the building to order. Now that's not inherently a bad thing since you know the food will be fresh. However, they haven't really gotten the hang of dealing with lots of people yet. Specifically dining room management. There are a limited number of tables and seats that is probably JUST enough to handle the amount of customers they can cook for at any given point in time. The problem is, customers don't trust the turn and have someone in their party squat a table as soon as they enter the joint. Which means that customer like me who waited in line with my party have nowhere to sit when our food is actually ready. Seriously? About a 3rd of the tables were taken up by people just sitting there waiting. We ended up having to eat our burritos standing next to the trash can which was quite unpleasant. \n\nThe business needs to recognize this problem and either put up signs to wait for your food before sitting down, and/or train the dining room attendants who are clearing and wiping the tables to make sure customers who already have their food have a place to sit above those who have not even ordered yet. \n\nThere is a burrito joint I go to in NYC all the time that has this policy down to a rhythm and I've always found a table there when my food was ready. This place needs to take a lesson from them. \n\nGotta trust in the turn!", "author": "Mike W."}

It's an additional $1.30 for a measly squirt. \n\nSo, okay, sometimes you just have to bend over and take it, you're already there for goodness sake. But an extra charge for chips and salsa as well?

The autentico atmosphere is furthered by the brick floor and big Mexican mural on the wall. Communal tables with benches abound and there are a few two-tops with stools with braided leather seats. \n\nAs at all real burrito joints, La Taqueria is no-frills, counter service, and cash only. The line can get long at peak hours, but it moves quickly as the cashiers are quite adept at capturing orders, even from late night drunks slurring their words. \n\nA regular burrito ($6.75) allows your choice of meat (carne asada, carnitas, chorizo, pollo, cabeza, and lengua), refried or pinto beans, and fresh salsa. Super ($8.95) adds sour cream, cheese, and avocado. \n\nDecidedly more diminutive than its counterpart at El Farolito, the contents of the carne asada super burrito were a little runny. Drips aside, the burrito was quite flavorful with big chunks of steak. Ingredients were well distributed, providing a good mix in each bite. A large side of chips and salsa ($1.30) is sufficient for at least two people.

I first tried La Taqueria after hearing about the burrito bracket on 538.  If Nate Silver says it's the best burrito in the country, that seems worth a try.\n\nI can't speak to it's supremacy in the entire US, but it is one mean burrito.  Everything is seasoned perfectly and sort of mixes together in the tortilla so you don't get bites of just one thing at a time.\n\nMy current favorite is getting half carne asada, half chorizo, dorado.  You gotta get yours dorado'ed.  Meaning \"golden\" in spanish (I think) they put your assembled burrito on the flat-top and get it all crispy and... wait for it... golden.\n\nThe tortillas are tops, so amazingly delicious for such a simple thing.\n\nThe moment you approach the building you realize just how popular it is.  The line is epic.  They work fast though, so usually you order and pay in short succession.  I wish it were a little more organized in the waiting for food to be ready arena, but it's a small space.\n\nI also wish they had a black bean option.  The pintos are tasty of course, but sometimes a girl needs some black beans.\n\nIt is a glorious day indeed when it's my husband's turn to go pick up burritos for lunch.

Not spectacular, not eye-popping. Just a bunch of mashed stuff mixed into a fairly soggy tortilla. Chicken was pretty decent, though, so that definitely redeemed the rest of the affair. Guacamole is always 10/10 though, and they have this ENORMOUS bowl of guac they just sling like snowballs in Norway. I also had one of those agua frescas, the watermelon one - it was, admittedly, quite good. That being said, I am not likely to get another one. \n\nIf I recall correctly, it was maybe 7 dollars or so for the usual burrito with all the works (except rice, because rice is apparently faux pas) , and they're rather small.

We were told La Taqueria was the best, and we welcomed something different from the restaurants north of Market Street. \n\nTo get to La Taqueria, we used public transit. We started from Union Square, and took the cable car to California Street. Then we transferred to the California cable car to the end of it's line (Van Ness). We then caught the bus (#49) that runs south on Van Ness Avenue to Misson Street. The point of describing our route is the cross-section of the city that we experienced first hand. Within an hour we saw the transitions of neighborhoods from the wealth of Nob Hill, past city hall, through the struggling Tenderloin district, and then the early signs of gentrification in the Mission district. One minute we were riding with tourist and business professionals and the next we were with the working class and even some homeless.

We took our food to go so in and out of there within 20-25 minutes which is totally fine since the line was like a maze. \n\nWe ordered the carne asada super burrito, carnitas super burrito, and a soft and crispy carne asada super taco. Also ordered a melon fresca. I never order burritos so I was a bit skeptical- I'm not a huge fan of tortilla. But I took one bite and I was pretty amazed. The tortilla was really soft and it was like a substitute for rice in my case. The meat itself was very flavorful. And the pico de gallo, guac, and loads of sour cream was just right. Not a fan of carnitas because I guess I've never had any that tasted good but the carnitas they serve here will have me ordering carnitas next time I come by. Taco was great too! Only item that was not very pleasant was the melon fresca- it was too sweet. Way too much sugar in it. I like it more on the natural sweetness flavor. \n\nThis place is expensive though. About 30 bucks for two burritos, a taco, and a drink. Worth it for the flavor.", "author": "Dara S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-29", "description": "Worth the wait. Since having won the 'burrito bracket' at FiveThirtyEight (website of political genius and stats guy, Nate Silver), this place has had a wraparound, 20-60 minute line at peak times like weeknights, lunch, and weekends. But it is worth it.\n\nThe reason is three words:\n\nSKIP. THE. RICE.\n\nThis place's burrito doesn't come with rice. As a result, you can really really taste all the ingredients. The burrito that won the bracket was the Carnitas, so I highly recommend you get that here. It's so good that you should bring people who come to SF and want some \"Mission Mexican\" or some cheaper \"SF food\" to.\n\nBut, I should mention TWO CAVEATS:\n\n1. This is a \"premium taqueria.\" \n\nOne burrito is nowhere near as big as you will be used to getting at most good Bay Area taquerias, which are like 2 pounds. So you probably want a burrito and taco to get that amount of food. As a result, you can think of La Taqueria as 1.5x the price of many taquerias. Or, if a typical burrito is too big for you, maybe this is the perfect diet solution you have been looking for. Because the lack of the white carbs-the rice- does add to the flavor at this establishment.\n\n2. The other meats are not \"breathtaking.\"\n\nThe other meats leave something to be lacking. The chicken and lengua could truly be mind-melting, but at some other establishment. Given this establishment has mind-melting carnitas, it is just easy to define what \"not mind melting\" is by eating the carnitas side-by-side with another meat here. They may be good, but they are not divine. The chicken may be a bit overcooked. The asada may be a tad chewy. The lengua could be seasoned a bit better.\n\nBut these caveats can't dock this amazing experience. it's the type of burrito you drive an hour for and wait an hour for. I do.", "author": "Aakash G."}

I have tried their burritos and tacos and I don't have a favorite because they're all delicioso! I always order my burritos and tacos \"super\" (with sour cream, cheese and avocado) and I would suggest you do the same. What makes their tacos unique is that they do the typical double tortilla, but the inner tortilla is crispy fried to perfection, adding a crunch to every bite. Their burritos aren't filled with rice like other places which means you get more meat!!!

I was STARVING and craving a burrito, but couldn't go to my favorite place because I was picking up my hubby.  I was driving down Mission when it dawned on me that I was near La Taqueria, so I immediately parked and walked over. There was a really long line, but it moved pretty quickly. I immediately noticed the prices were kind of expensive and was rather insulted when I read customers PAY for chips. That's ridiculous and greedy, especially since they are such a busy place. I'm pretty sure they make enough money to throw in a bag of chips. And to make things worse, they don't even have a salsa bar. I'm guessing this is because they feel their burritos are so good they don't need salsa, but they're not that good so get over yourself!!\n\nWhen my turn came I ordered two burritos: a carne asada and chicken. I wanted grilled chicken, but they're too cool to have that as well, which did not make my husband very happy. It took a pretty long time for me to get the burritos, but it was packed so watev. When I finally got back to my car I ripped the carne asada burrito open, took a bite and....was not at all impressed. First of all, the burrito was small, so thank God I ordered more than one because there was no way my husband and I could share. Second, it was super sloppy!! Stuff was dripping everywhere and it was so loosely wrapped that I'm surprised everything didn't fall out!

You know where your loyalties lie.  You irrationally love your team.  And you HATE the other side.  I know it's irrational.  And probably pretty stupid.  And not objective at all.  But you know what?  Whatever!  That's the whole point of sports rivalries! \n\nI am a die-hard fan of El Farolito.  So of course this review is totally unbiased.  \n\nBefore I tried La Taqueria, I used to always say \"El Farolito is the best taqueria in the Mission, in my opinion.\"  \n\nWell, now that I've actually tried La Taqueria, I finally feel justified in saying, \"El Farolito is the best taqueria. THAT IS A FACT.\" \n\nPrice-wise, going to La Taqueria was a MAJOR sticker shock.  $6.75 for the base burrito, with only the meat, some beans, and I think, salsa?  If you want to add stuff like cheese, avocado, or sour cream, you're looking at paying about $10 for a burrito.\n\n$10 for a burrito?  That is bullshit.  \n\nTaste-wise, the chicken burrito I had was also quite bland.  Definitely not as flavorful as the flavor-packed El Farolito super burrito.  Also, it was dripping wet.  No bueno. \n\nSize-wise, it's not as big as the super giant-monster that is the El Farolito super burrito.  So, you're not getting as good of a deal. \n\nI was highly disappointed in all the people who raved about La Taqueria.  I'd heard the hype and was curious, willing to be open-minded about this experience.  Alas, so much disappointment.  Expensive, lack of flavor, relatively small.  \n\nIf you're in the mood for a super burrito (which, for me, is pretty much every day), please walk down the block to 24th and Mission and grab yourself the much cheaper, much more delicious greasebomb glorious creation that is the El Farolito super burrito.  It is the best burrito in the Mission.  \n\nAnd that's completely objective and factual.  The End.", "author": "Vivian C."}

It's on a busy stretch of Mission and the storefront can easily get lost among the larger, more prominent signs and other activity on the street. The interior of the restaurant is simple - a counter where they take orders and prepare food with plenty of accolades above it and an array of short and long tables with bench-style seats and salsa verde and menus on each one.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple and straightforward. I went with the veggie taco and veggie burrito, my manfriend with the carne asada burrito. I can't speak for his meal, but both of my items were good, but not even close to the best in the whole world (or even half of it). My items came with hot sauce on them, but were not hot; I generously applied the excellent salsa verde they make. I was surprised (not disappointed) that they use whole pinto over black beans; at least at home veggie items come with refried or black beans. The inner tortilla on the taco was slightly crunchy like they grilled it extra. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not, but I really liked it.\n\nWhile not the best in the world, this place has some really solid Mexican food.

When we were finished eating, one of us was brave enough to bring up how the experience there was and we both agreed that it was way overpriced, way overhyped, and long lines for an OK burrito.\n\nIf this is the best burrito in the area, I won't be eating anymore burritos here or nearby.

This place is one of the best known burrito joints in a place where there probably 100 burrito places in a square mile. If you type \"Best burrito in America\" into google, thanks to Nate Silver, this place comes up. That's saying something.\n\nThe burritos have a steamed tortilla and are filled with meat, beans, and delicious homemade salsa. If you want cheese or sour cream, ask when you order. Notice the lack of rice, which distinguishes this burrito from most of the other burritos in the Mission. As a result, the burrito is a little bit less gut busting than some of the others, which frankly I appreciate. And the ingredients are simply delicious, perhaps standing out a bit more because of the lack of rice.\n\nThe burrito can get a little juicy in the middle because of the fresh tomatoes in the salsa. I think that's ok, because I don't mind if it gets a little soft. But if you want to make sure I think you can ask to have your burrito grilled as well. Maybe I'll try that next time.\n\nThe down side is that there is a line, and that it can be hard to find a table, but what do you expect?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-09", "description": "La Taqueria is fantastic, and is my favorite place in the SF Mission District as far as taquerias go.  The ingredients are consistently fresh, and all the meats I have tasted are juicy and well-seasoned.  I have had the grilled super burrito (i.e. el dorado style) with both carnitas and carne asada.  The lack of rice makes the burrito's components individually flavorful, while the meal is hearty (like Mexican food should be) but not overly filling.  I also recently tried the super crunchy carne asada taco and regular lengua taco.  The super crunchy taco came with a soft tortilla wrapped around a crunchy tortilla, and was loaded with steak, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa.  The regular lengua taco was served traditionally with onions, cilantro, salsa, and slow cooked beef tongue.  Far more straightforward and simple than the super taco, but high quality and delicious in its own right.  \n\nThere are two potential drawbacks to eating here.  One is the price, which is expensive compared to other Mission taquerias.  In 2016, regular tacos go for about $4.00 each, super tacos are $7.00, and one super burrito will be about $11.00.  This is San Francisco, however, and most everything is expensive nowadays.  The taste and quality, however will make up for the higher price compared to neighboring taquerias.  Secondly, seating is limited and the place is regularly crowded to the point where you will bump into people and may have to share small tables.  Go for the food, and not the dining experience.", "author": "Alan C."}

Any other taquerias are not on my radar, #SorryI'mNotSorry.\n\nI tried La Taq for the first time this weekend, being a hardcore El Farolito fan myself. I heard of the magnificent carnitas (or any proteins for that matter) at La Taq and their elusive \"dorado\" secret menu option. How could I not be enticed out of my El Farolito cave to try this so-called delicacy? I was in.\n\nYes, anticipate long wait times. Yes, stop at the ATM first. Yes, you could wait awhile to find a seat. This is to be expected. I will note that the cleanliness is on-point. More so than others in the area.\n\nOur party of three each got a different burrito. I had to capture the whole spectrum of our visit! We ordered: a vegetarian super burrito, a chicken burrito (w/ avocado and cheese) DORADO style, and a carne asada super burrito. \n\nMy friend w/ the vegetarian burrito said it was good, not great. They only offer pinto or refried beans here. NO BLACK BEANS (sad face) or other veg option. My bf had the carne asada super burrito and said he clearly prefers El Farolito over this one. Not as much flavor and was missing the rice. My chicken burrito missed the mark. I had to nix the pico because of my onion intolerance and I think that having it would have added so much more flavor to the otherwise juicy, but flavorless chicken. The dorado style didn't impress me, as it made my burrito into a greasy mess that left my stomach in a greasy mess yadda yadda. \n\nOverall, a solid choice. Maybe the tacos are better, idk.

Let's put this in perspective - a pescado taco w/ all the fix-ins at Nick's Crispy Tacos is the same price, but it's a larger portion and it's a seafood taco.

I always do their Carne Asada burrito, although I've been told they make a mean taco (fried with cheese), and plan to do that one next.  The Carne Asada is fresh, flavorful, and quality cuts.  The simple ingredients make a big deal--- like the guacamole.  My other favorite spot, Gordo, I sadly forgo the guac because it's cut with sour cream-- and will sometimes opt for fresh avocado (which they reluctantly provide me, as it's off-menu, and they can be dickheads with customer service). Here, the guacamole is 100% pure, 100% fresh, and it makes a huge difference in the burrito.\n\nMy only compaints are that they do not use rice.  I know they claim rice is a filler, and takes away from the flavor, but I like it-- so there.  Second, I suspect it might have lard in it. I know that's authentic and all, but I can really do without the aftertaste of lard.  Gordo gets my vote, as they grill their meats rather than put on a flat grill with grease.  As you get to the end of the burrito, the tortilla is dripping.

A hard shell tortilla with a soft tortilla over it. It's like a taco bell gordita, but you know, actually good.

For that same price, I might as well go the Chipotle and get a meatier and thicker burrito with more ingredients. Tacos here also range from $4-$5, but again, why am I paying such a high price for something that's more expensive than the tacos at Paul Martin's?

Having been a denizen of a state where Mexican food abounds, I was not too keen on the idea of trying to consume a burrito with rice in it (seriously! f'in rice!) and neither did I like it.  But over the many years I have been sold on the tastiness of the components of the food they serve and the fact that you can get burritos and tacos as dressed down as you like.  The carne asada is perfectly cooked with bits of chars enhancing the tasty marinade.  Squeeze of lime, a smattering of cilantro and voila! excellent taco ready to have their delicious salsa's squired on them on the road to the mouth.  The beef tongue is just a prefect cut of meat for a burrito and well complimented by the accompanying beans and guac that i get in it.  I have also come to appreciate the awesomenss of the assembly line in this place.  It is almost worth it to be able to hang in the front and watch the making quesadillas, assembling burritos or throwing together tacos for consumption.  \n\nLines are always long, but don't freak out about the lines. ..they move fast and all it does is give you a chance to exchange notes on other places to eat with people who obviously appreciate well cooked meats.", "author": "Sunay P."}

I added avocado to the mix as I like the smoothness of the texture and the clean taste it brings.

The landscape mimicked the look and feel of Corona and Jackson Heights (minus the 7 train)!  Of course, special and unique in it's own right, Cali's Mission brought to light my experience with Mexican street fare which bore high standards as the food you find in Queens is pretty top-notch.  Especially in a place throbbing with cultural transplants bringing only the best and trustiest of their motherland's traditional staples of tacos, tortas, horchata, and more.  \n\nMy order was simple.  Una taco de pollo, and a horchata to wash it down.  My food was served up quickly and warm, and my ice cold beverage with that delicious nod of cinnamon brought me much joy.  This chicken taco was outstanding.  The meat was tender and juicy, the corn tortilla was magically soft yet crispy both at once, and my salsa, as fresh as day.  It not only rivaled the beloved taco trucks on Roosevelt Ave, but may also have, in my regard, have surpassed them.  I had decided two things at the end of that vibrant meal, a) this was the best thing I'd eaten in San Francisco yet, and b) I admitted to Rachael that La Taqueria would be my very first yelp review upon my return back to New York despite all the yummy places we'd visited.  \n\nSo, here's to keeping my promise.  \n\nThere are many places to grab a taco in the Mission admist all the gorgeous and fun murals and street art lining Balmy and Lucky streets, you may just feel inclined - for convenience sake - to stop into the nearest one you see in your vicinity, but don't make the mistake of skipping out on La Taqeria.

I seen lots of reviews suggestions to add extra sour cream and avocado so I ordered double on both I also ordered a side of jalape\u00f1os. When I got my burrito it was so skinny thus made me sad, but I was like whatever let's taste it. It was good....not epic or anything and I was kinda bitter I paid for extra sour cream and guacamole and they didn't put it. I wasn't gonna wait in the Super long line again I just chopped it up as a loss. I also ordered the chips and salsa, salsa is more of a Pico de Gallo, I suggest ordering it with the guacamole that's how most people ordered it. I'm go back and just order my stuff as it comes seems like that's what I will get anyways. Total bill was $46 2 burritos x2 in sour cream and guacamole 2 Pacifico's and one chip and salsa. Think burrito ended up being almost $15 each it's like $7 worth of burrito tho :-(", "author": "Daisy O."}

Yes, it has the best Caribbean food and Cuchifrito around but, not Mexican.\n\nAfter moving out West, I was delighted to find that most Mexican eateries were on the money when it came to flavor and authenticity.  However, I recently found out that all taquerias are not created equal and that taste is not subjective when it comes to La Taqueria.  It is a foodie's oasis amidst the bustling Mission district.  The outside is a typical unassuming fa\u00e7ade that belies the epicurean pleasure inside.  The lines are long but, the wait is well worth it.\n\nThe best taco is no longer an illusion (for me) and can be ordered by uttering these three words \"Carnitas Tacos Dorado\"...(cue the choir of angels).  I kid you, not!  The carnitas were flawlessly seasoned and agreeably flavorful.  Who knew hard/soft was a savory oxymoron you could bite into without a contradictory thought. The unfussy blend of ingredients: a soft and hard taco, carnitas, beans, salsa and guacamole were the perfect combination that was anything but, simple. Best burrito in America?  I'm not sure.  Best taco in America...Oh, Yeah!", "author": "Schimen S."}

Unfortunately I came away sorely disappointed. The tacos are a good choice for a light meal and on this trip it was carne asada and carnitas for me. \n\nThe carnitas did not taste very fried or have any crunch, while the carne asada was very bland. The tacos are a good size and very filling because they stuff them with beans, but the beans also mask the flavor of the meats. Added, the Salsa they top the taco with is not very spicy and adds little to the flavor dynamic. \n\nThese were some of the most expensive (3.75 each) and blandest tacos I've ever had.

They seem to be pretty popular, because the line was out the door the first time I came here. I'm not a fan of beans, so the fact that they don't have rice throws off my burrito game. I opted for a Carne asada quesadila this time, but it was drenched in oil. The flour tortilla was very crispy and crunchy, not like how other places make it on the grill. I barely noticed any cheese on it, which totally makes it just a dila. My friends both got burritos and they looked pretty small compared to other ones I've seen. \n\nThis place is definitely catered to a different audience, as the burritos are  $10.50 and incomparable to authentic taqueria food. \n\nThey were out of melon, so I got the horchata. It was poured out of a milk jug, and I thought they were going to add something to it right there because it looked like plain milk, but the horchata was already made and put back into the jug I guess. It lacked flavor and it was awkward telling my guests from out of state to try it and then finding out that the horchata here wasn't that great. It just tasted like sweet milk. \n\nNext time I'll take a guest to El farolito down the block or san jose across the street.", "author": "Jessica W."}

And you know what? I HELLA agree! I'm not a very big taco fan but this place just won me over. The special tacos they made had crunchy and soft tortillas with cheese in between them. And they don't skimp on the meat. The carne asada and especially the chorizo where delicious! The green sauce they have at each table is a great combo to the taco. I have yet to taste the burritos but reading the reviews they don't have beans or rice in them... Ummm naw...I'll stick to El Farolito as my burrito choice. \nOk, so the price..it's like WOW!! DAMN!! WHAT!?? I understand the cash only approach but they charging almost $8 PER TACO! ( and don't count on getting full on only one) You almost may just want to go for special occasions. I may be picky but I grew up in the mission paying less that $3/4 for a taco. This place is charging burrito prices for a great tasting taco. \nBut at the end.

Analyzing 538.com and how people might perceive them if they did not meet the general populations fix on a \"mexican\" burrito then their next ranking will be void.

It's taste is safe, it's not greasy, it taste fresh, taste good, AND I can also get the same exact taste from a small mexican restaurant chain around my neighborhood or known n the fast-casual world as Chipotle. \n\nAs an avid mexican food truck, mexican restaurant, mexican everything food lover, I look for very distinct tastes. The taste that no one else can re-engineer. A stamp of authenticity that can only be recognized by its own fellow race and to those that know. But for La taqueria's carnitas burrito, it is simply a political correct statement to cover 538.com's butt.

I had no idea they put beans in their burittos so I had to pick that out.  I didn't see salsa on the menu and was surprised they didn't put it in the buritto.  Just meat and beans?!  Geez.

I had heard about the 538 business, but I didn't bother to look it up until now.\n\nThird disappointment was when i ate it. Really, it didn't taste bad. All the ingredients tasted very clean.

Something that might give you a stomach-ache.\n\nReally, the carnitas wasn't even that good. It just tasted like pork. Some carnitas is really tender and melts in your mouth. Or they make it was a little crunch on the sides. This, really just tasted pork.... not overly tender, but not chewy, not crispy. Just pork.\n\nI was in El Farolito's today, and noticed the clientele are hispanics, hipsters, and rejects and good old plain every day people.

Calling in with large, very specified orders, the lady, on the phone, seemed to be on top of it.  Carpooled with someone and went in during the lunch rush.  What was interesting was, while waiting patiently to pick up my order, I heard a live trio of trumpet, guitar, accordion started playing and while in line for food.  As if the place wasn't small enough, they had to play their music in line.  Hmm...trying not to be one to judge, I will assume that is the norm since no one said or did anything.  \n\nAnyways, their burritos: love it; zero rice makes all the difference.  At other Mexican/Hispanic joints (i.e. El Farolito, El Burrito Express), burritos contain a lot of rice, which makes up a larger percentage of the burrito.  Here at La Taqueria, you get the actual filling: meat, guacamole, cilantro, sala, onions, etc. all without the extra rice filling your stomach.

Case in point, the much-touted carne asada taco at La Taqueria. Huh? I mean, if by juicy meat you mean meat that feels like it's been cooked in stock and is so saturated with liquid that it literally drips off the taco soaking everything in its path, then yeah, I guess this taco sure is juicy. I was under the impression juicy meat referred to the jus encased within a well-cooked piece of meat, not some random savory liquid it seems the meat was used to wipe up like a sponge.\n\nThe agua fresca was even worse. Holy sugar, Batman! There wasn't a single flavor that tasted natural and not overloaded with sugar. I can forgive the horchata, but the fruit flavors should not have been this ridiculously sweet. I remember the great agua fresca I had in Mexico, Peru and NYC's Red Hook neighborhood. None of them tasted like La Taqueria's.\n\nThe 2 stars are for the quick turnover on a Saturday night that allowed us to snag a table immediately upon entering the restaurant.", "author": "Josephine L."}

I was craving mexican food and have not yet tried La Taqueria (she has) so we decided to go there so I could see what the hype was about.\n\nGot super lucky with parking right across the street. We walked in and it was busy but that's pretty much everywhere you go now. She ordered a carne asada burrito and I ordered 3 tacos; 2 carnitas and 1 chicken (just to switch it up). We split the food so I had half her burrito and she had one of my tacos. The carnitas taco was good, not great. The chicken taco was awful. No taste at all. The carne asada burrito was also good but not that great. We also had to pay another $1.50 for chips and salsa. \n\nOverall I would say the food is good. It is more expensive than other places which takes it down a star and charging for chips and salsa. There are other taquerias in the mission that I would say are at least as good for cheaper. Even though I did not pay, I'm a little appalled at the value for the price.", "author": "Eddie K."}

Being a born and raised Los Angelino, this is a definite step away from a true Baja style taqueria, but it is a fantastic taco. For the burrito offerings, definitely request the Doardo style, which gives the tortilla a nice grilling. Otherwise it's a so-so burrito that turns into a mushy, soggy affair. Parking is nightmarish and lines are long, but do move quickly. La Taqueria is the benchmark for SF tacos with a well-deserved rep.

And of course that's an impossible reputation to live up to. So how was it. Good fast service,the line looks long but it moves. Not a lot of room to eat,so you have to work it out. Either get it to go or try and squeeze in one of the tables. The neighborhood of the location is well upper Mission which is no paradise. So how was the food: 5-stars! Note they do not put rice in the burrito. But I must take a 2 stars off,I asked for extra-steak and found it had less steak than a normal burrito elsewhere. A continuous struggle with most burrito establishments:wheres the meat? Yes we had to go back and ask for the chips and drink we ordered,not a big deal but still shows a non-attention to detail. No doubt they just forgot the extra-steak to. But the flavor is off the charts so I definitely recommend. Looking to bump up the rating.", "author": "Jimmy L."}

I don't want you to give me extra crap in my burrito to replace it, I just like burritos without beans! Also, having to pay for chips and salsa is always slightly annoying. Anyways, I stopped here to grab a carnitas burrito with the fixings one day after work. I took it home and started with the chips. Really good chips and salsa! Always a good start. And it heightened by expectation for the burrito.... wrong.\n\nI'm not an aficionado, but I really enjoy Mexican food. The reviews for this place spouted high quality meat spiced perfectly, and I got a wrap full of slop! By the time I reached the third bite of this burrito, it had transformed into a pile of mush and sogginess in the foil. I couldn't pick it up anymore because it was soaked through the tortilla! I used the chips to get at some of the filling, and it still disappointed as nacho topping.

I think what detracted from my meal was the fact that the onions on top completely overpowered my palate, masking any flavor the meat had. But if I had to choose between the two - I would opt for the carnitas.  \n\nThings to pay attention to: you have to pay for all the extra fixings (cheese, sour cream, guac...you even have to pay to have them not put on beans!) which could elevate the price from $3.75 (per taco) to an absurd $6.25 (per taco with everything).

I mean, I haven't been to every mex restaurant in the bay so I can't compare to other places that have been claimed \"the best,\" but to me this place is fucking awesome. There tacos are like, superb (Also heard the burritos are amazing--haven't tried, but I believe it). I showed my ex this place and he showed his friends and his family who showed their friends and now they all love this place. Everybody in my family loves this place, and I always bring visiting relative here.\n\nWhen I go here, I always get the carnitas soft tacos. I don't think it's really necessary to get the whole shebang of sour cream and guac on it because they kinda overload it (not necessarily a bad thing) but if you're first trying it out, just plain with salsa is just delicious. I don't think I've had horchata here but I always get their strawberry agua fresca. It quenches your thirst after eating and it's just so incredibly satisfying. Seriously recommend this place. I come all the way from the other side of the tunnel of the east bay just for this place. It's not far from bart, though if you for some reason decide to drive I've never had trouble finding parking. It gets really crowded there because it's hella popular and at first you might have trouble finding somewhere to sit...that is, if you have a problem sitting next to strangers. There's long tables in there and sometimes I just see like a couple sitting and not wanting to share the rest of the table or something. Don't be greedy, just share the table, it's not a big deal lol. I've always found seating in there quickly, whether with just my boyfriend or with 5 other people.\n\nOne thing that gets me is how it's all cash. I'm a fool and always forget and I don't carry cash because, like I said, i'm a fool. Also, it can get kinda pricey...but I guess you can't reaaaallly complain because 1. you're in the city, 2. this place is seriously poppin so, 3. you get your money's worth. The service isn't too bad, they're not mean, just really busy, so don't take it personally if they seem kinda hurried with the questions.\n\nOverall, this place is the bomb.

The wait was short, the carnitas was flavorful, no complaints there. The food itself was well-contained, substantial and filling--not as greasy nor as \"gut-busting\" as some of the other options nearby, but for me, that's not something to dock a star for. \n\nThough I did dock a star in my review:\n- The place itself is rather small. Seating is limited, and I imagine quite difficult to attain during the more busy hours.\n- No credit cards.

And I know everything is fresh because I once saw a cow's head in the kitchen that was being picked clean. Yes, I am recommending their cabeza tacos, which are rich and moist and delicious. I also love their chorizo; it has the perfect balance of spicy and sweet, and I know of no better cure for a hangover than the chorizo burrito and a quesadilla.

I have been coming here since I could chew my food properly. My family are firm believers of this place and I couldn't agree more. The tacos are out of this world and the burritos will kick your ass in just how tasty they are. Also vegetarian friendly and their basic taco (tortilla, beans, chesse and salsa) will satisfy any craving (as my vegetarian girlfriend describes and agrees) . \n\nOne recommendation I have is to ask them to fry up the taco (dorados) and that will just blow your mind. I'm not sure on how to ask them for this set-up but since I've been coming here for quite some time, they know how I (and my family) likes it, when you ask for \"dorados\", they fry up the outer shell of the taco, stick some cheese in between the hard shell and the soft shell, and then layer on the beans, and salsa (even better with some meat thrown in!) That is all I come here for and just recently I have been asking for their burritos and a whole new world has been opened for me. \n\nTheir real fruit juices (agua frescas) are to die for and compliment the eating experience. I do recommend having the mango or watermelon and are far superior to any soft drink they serve (and of course they serve classic mexican beer for those who want to have the \"adult meal\" experience). \n\nHOWEVER, there are a few faults. There is limited seating and the lines are usually pretty long during lunch and dinner hours (but there is almost always someone going through the lines to ask people what they want to order to get things moving faster). Be prepared to share some tables and benches with strangers but it adds more fun to the dinning experience and don't worry, you guys are, enjoying the best tacos and burritos in the world, there shouldn't be any other care in the world (except for how long your car has been parked at the meter).\n\nSo, bottom line----- you must come here for a taste that is out of this world!!!! But don't expect a sit down type restaurant (where you have  \"chips\" included in your meal. NO. That's extra)  This isn't the place for those kinds of shenanigans.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-16", "description": "As you can see by the amount of reviews and high number of reviews this place is very popular. When it is open around any typical meal time you can expect to have to queue up and wait in line for your food.\n\nIn Sept 2014, FiveThirtyEight website rated La Taqueria as the best burrito out of 67,391 burrito selling places. pretty impressive win for La Taqueria - but is this true? I'll do my assessment of this - is it possible that La Taqueria is the best burrito one can get?  \n  \nThis review is based on a carne asada burrito and a chicken burrito ordered at 20 minutes to closing time. \nOne of the big differences in their burritos is that NO RICE is part of the fillings. In fact, they don't have rice anywhere in the restaurant - so if you love rice your SOL. As for me, no big thing - my fav burritos are basically \"San Diego\" style all meat + a hot sauce/ salsa. However I do like beans, guacamole, cheese, pico de gallo so have no problem if they're in my burrito. So having no rice is not a big deal for me but my wife wasn't crazy about this as it's on her must haves for burritos.\nThe burrito I ordered was a carne asada with salsa, beans and guacamole. I requested jalape\u00f1os to be added to the burrito but they weren't there so I assume you can't get them. So to get to one big issue with the place is - due to the popularity - there is not any variations possible beside the choices on the assembly line of ingredients. Also the place has no salsa bar - which is typical in 99% of the Mexican taquerias I visit. There are ketchup bottles on the tables filled with a green, almost medium heat level sauce, that is a slurry of the ingredients in the sauce.\nSo after all this, I got my burrito and took several good size bites to analyze the taste. I though as I munched on the burrito it is probably the best tasting beef carne asada I've ever had. I was super impressed with the beef. It had a full beef flavor with a excellent taste of a touch of charing brought out  flavors through caramelization and the Maillard reaction. The combination of the beef with the beans, guacamole, and salsa was truly loaded with flavor and an excellent burrito to eat. Although my wife missed her rice, she was pleased with her chicken burrito that was made up of chicken, sour cream and cheese.\n--------------------- bottom line ---------------\nSo if you like burritos, La Taqueria in the Mission is a must stop place. You will not be disappointed and you will get a great meal in SF at an inexpensive price - the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because 1) I love my burritos to be very picante (hot) and La Taqueria could not deliver on this point\n2) Limited options for one's burrito, no salsa bar.\n\nIs La Taqueria the best burrito place in the USA - well no but it is excellent and defiantly worth a visit - I will be back", "author": "Mark H."}

The claim was too outrageous - best tacos/burritos in the world? Who does that?\n\nThat said, I found an operation that I had an insane amount of respect for once I got there. It was the fastest, most precise, organized, and well-run line I've seen in years. Every member of their team, which must have been around a dozen, knew their role exactly. Watching the line is enough reason for anyone who might reckon themselves a \"foodie\" (don't care much for that word) to go here for the experience.\n\nFor people from Southern Ontario/Toronto, or anyone familiar with Muskoka - the only line I've seen run like this at \"Weber's\" up the 400 Highway. [There, you walk into a lineup, and while you're in line you get your order taken, pay, and by the time you get into the place you get your food and walk out - a 30 meter line-up could take under 10 minutes...] This place in SF, is the real deal. In terms of authenticity, imagine Mexico City, and the volumes of tacos that they must pump out daily. \n\nThis, for meat-lovers, should be considered a bucket list item (considering of course, you don't want to go right to Mexico, if you're not concerned about how dangerous its becoming).\n\nI gave this place a 4, because the food is made for volume. It is not as good as it can be. Y'know? The reason it's so good is because it's so fresh. They go through such volume, that nothing sits around for too long. In that sense, it's great, but it's not as good as it can be because of the volume. It's a double-edged sword.

It's been a while since I had a mission burrito so I decided to try La Taqueria. Despite all the awards and accolades this place has had over the years, I had never tried it until today. \n\nLet me start by saying that when I entered, although crowded, most of the people were not Latino. Always a bad sign. I ended up ordering at the cash only counter my default carne asada super burrito and mango Aqua fresca. This place gets points for having 8 different kinds of agua fresca. Most places have 3. My order was ready promptly but I was surprised to find that in terms of size, my super burrito was not at all 'super'. Not a problem, I'll just eat more chips. By the way, they charge $1.30 for chips and salsa. That's strike 2 in the value category. One of the reasons why mission style burritos and California burritos in general are so popular here because most people can make two meals out of one burrito or at least be so stuffed after eating one at say lunch that they aren't even hungry by dinner time. This was not going to be the case here. $9 gets you a regular size burrito that cannot fill up big guy such as myself. After getting past all of these little negative elements, I was ready to enjoy my $9 super (baby) carne asada burrito. The last bad I'll say is that the tortilla was too chewy and moist. I like my tortilla a little on the dryer side with brown marks on it. Maybe this is just me. \n\nThe ingredients inside the burrito were pretty good. A little too much sour cream for my taste and not enough heat but I know that's just personal preference. I'd say I have an above average heat tolerance so if they made every burrito for my tastes, people would complain. All in all, the taste of the burrito and chips and salsa were not bad, but not good enough for me to come back. You can get a much better burrito a block away. \n\nMaybe their tacos are better.", "author": "Rudy G."}

I went there today with some European friends who read about the award, and wanted to try it. Sure, why not? I'm often getting burritos in the Mission, and hadn't tried this one before.\n\nAs I said, mediocre at best. Squishy and bland (homogenous comes to mind), it reminded of a microwave or 7-11-type burrito, where there's no great distinction between ingredients, it's all just one-note pasty in your mouth. Their salsa selection is non-existent, just the pico and some green hot sauce. The agua frescas were 80% ice, other places served chilled and the ice is minimal or absent. There's only one bean choice (pinto), and even the non-mashed are really mushy.\n\nThe burritos weren't cheap, neither were the drinks, and the overall meal wasn't anywhere close to a number of other Mission taquerias, my favorites being Cancun and Pancho Villa. PV is probably my favorite: tasty meat, a choice of beans, TONS of free and different salsas such that you can tailor the chips and the food to your liking. LT offers nothing over PV except an undeserved award.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, the burritos are small. One from PV or any one of a number of other places are two meals for me, in fact I plan on one for lunch and dinner later, but the LT burrito is so small I gulped it all down.\n\nWe had 4 different burritos, and 2 tacos.", "author": "Rob C."}

In fact, I thought it SO impossible that I was actually worried I'd be unable to distinguish between the swarms of Mexican restaurants in SF - an unfounded concern though, as La Taqueria has proven, being the first Mexican restaurant to have ever served up bland dishes to me.\n\nI get a simple cabeza burrito ($6.50), while my roomy orders two of their tacos for $3.50 per. Yet, somehow, I end up with a tacorrito, while he finds himself faced with two burracos. What on earth are these you ask? Well. As we dig in to our food, we realize that La Taqueria's tacos and burritos seem to be faced with an identity crisis. Their tacos, rather than being the small, simple ones you'd normally find, are large handfuls brimming with meat, salsa, and beans. Their burritos, on the other hand, only contain meat, onions, cilantro, and beans, as one would expect of a simple taco. Thus the terms tacorrito and burraco are born - the former, a burrito that is more taco-like than burrito-like, and vice versa.\n\nThis, in itself, would not be a terrible thing, if not compounded by the fact that they were both surprisingly bland, necessitating that I drown my tacorrito in obscene amounts of their spicy green salsa - the highlight of the meal, really. So while yes, you're slightly more accessible, cleaner, and less crowded than El Farolito, I shall opt for the latter's tastier, and cheaper (really? $1.20 to leave the beans out?) meal options next time.", "author": "Johnny W."}

For starters, the line to order food (dinnertime) was extremely long and extended towards the back of the restaurant! However, there is a lady who stands at the front of the line to start taking orders to facilitate the process. There generally are a lot of people seated either eating their meal, or waiting for their take out -- overall noisy but fun. The decor is also pretty standard -- bright white lights, small seating area. One thing I particularly enjoyed were the vases of roses placed along the ledges. My friend told me that generally when the manager is here, he would hand out the roses to the ladies. I have yet to see this, but what a sweet gesture!\n\nThe food itself is scrumptious, despite the higher price. Perfect amount of grease, authentic homemade salsa and guacamole dip! The chips are also wonderfully warm and crunchy. I ordered the carne asada taco, Dorado style (crunchy shell + soft shell combined). Amazing!

Their meats are fresh and have a ton of flavor, as well as their salsa and beans. \n\nOne thing to note about this place is that their burritos do not have rice, which gives it a more authentic taste but may be too drastic of a change for folks used to rice in their burritos.\n\nIt's always busy, which is a sign of how universally appreciated the place is. Workers are friendly, music in the place is good (they have a jukebox you can select songs from). \n\nTwo downsides: parking can be difficult since it IS the Mission and a block down from 24th; the establishment is cash only, but they do have an ATM inside should you forget your cash.\n\nThe bottom line: check this place out!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-18", "description": "I have no idea what the people who say the food here is not amazing are talking about.  I've been eaten tacos & burritos all over the Bay Area (mostly in SF) for over 30 years and there are few places that even come close to being as good as La Taqueria.  Sure you can go to places like Pancho Villa or El Faro & get much larger burritos for a little less but they don't have even half the flavor of La Taqueria.  \n\nFirst La Taqueria burritos have no rice in them which everywhere else uses and is usually bland & causes the burrito to be too dry.  Yes I know I could have other places just not put rice on it, but they don't replace it by putting more of something else on it making their burritos smaller.  Yes La Taqueria's burritos can be a little smaller than other places but it's because of that lack of rice that their burritos are juicier and more flavorful.  It's a case where less is better.\n\nSecond ingredients.  Everything is always super fresh especially the pico de gallo & guacamole.  The meats are all top notch and the sour cream is the best of any please I've ever been.  Some many other places use watered down sour cream, add fillers to guacamole or can/jarred salsas.  To me Mexican food is like Italian... It is at its best when using very few ingredients and making sure what they do use is fresh & the best there is.  That is what La Taqueria does.  \n\nThird their tacos.  The amount of meat they put in their tacos is unreal.  Again just real good ingrediants and tons of them.  A little bit of pinto beans, a ton of meat, a huge scoop of pico de gallo and add some of their salsa verde.  Yes at $3.50 they can be a little pricy but for me two of their tacos for $7 is more filling and tastes way better than a $7.50 burrito somewhere else.\n\nFourth the price.  I won't argue that it is cheap, but for me I'm happy to pay for what I get.  Yes a burrito with everything on it is $9; however most other places are charging $7.50 or $8 for a super burrito which doesn't taste nearly as good.  For me I'd rather spend a little more to get something that to me tastes way better.    \n\nLet's compare prices between La Taqueria and another Mexican place a ton of people swear by, Papalote.  For a burrito with everything at La Taqueria it's $9 & at Papalote it's $10.10 for a fully loaded chicken, steak or pork burrito.  As for tacos at La Taqueria it is $7 for two tacos which is cheaper than $7.95 at Papalote.\n\nJust about everyone is biased to like what they grew up with yes there is some of that in this case.  For me though, La Taqueria always uses freshest ingredients, always has flavorful, juicy, tender meat & gives you more meat than other places & for me has the best salsa verde anywhere.  Also the aguas frescas are the best!  The Fresca (strawberry) is one of the best drinks I've ever had.", "author": "Tim B."}

Carnitas & some pinto beans wrapped in a cold flour tortilla. Taqueria food - basic - not complicated - quickly assembled - south of the border comfort food.   Burrito was smallish compared to American versions which are pregnant with burrito-ness ingredients.   On the other hand (and to some folks a positive), much closer to the renditions found in Mexico. One star for cultural connectedness. Want rice in it...more peso's, want avocado...more peso's, want black beans...outa luck.  Want more than the annointed green hot sauce... bring your own. Want a condiment bar with the pickled jalapenos etc., go somewhere else. Almost as if they have wrenched out every peso out of their cost of food. I am surprised they don't charge to use the restroom.  Ok, maybe I shoulda ordered their \"super\" version or requested the ingredients I wanted ... but didn't know they were not included with the \"base\" model. Maybe the \"super\" upgraded version woulda made me super happy.\n\nWhere I would go with Taqueria pangs (which don't appear very often):\n\nLos Coyotes: http://www.taquerialoscoyotes.com/  which proclaims: \"The best burritos, tacos, nachos in San Francisco, California.\" Which if not completely true, is within a modicum of true, which is sorta a rounding error.  \n\nI kinda felt there was nothing to draw me back to La Taqueria.

For awhile, guacamole and authentic Mexcian food has constantly been crawling in the back of my mind. So when my friend and I were in the mission district, we both insisted on satiating ourselves with some real deal Mexican food. To our luck, La Taqueria was still open and so we quickly took a seat and ordered before the kitchen closed. And HOMG, their food tasted AMAZING. I'm partially torn between whether we were just hungry and cold or if the food was as heavenly as I had imagine...probably a combination of both. \n\nWe ordered the chicken burrito, tacos and chips with salsa and guacamole. Their salsa was ok, there was a little bit of onion overdose, but the guacamole was fresh, chunky and flavorful. And let me tell you, their burritos are no joke. It was just straight up stuffed with freshly stewed and shredded chicken with beans...none of that chipotle stuff (don't get me wrong, I like my chipotle too!). I thought it was awesome that it oozed deliciousness when my friend cut open it. I ordered the vegetarian burrito, because there weren't any fish tacos. However, I was disappointed to find that it only contained beans, cheese and salsa...guess I expected grilled vegetables. I didn't complain because it was still well made. Overall, La Taqueria is a wonderful family own restaurant, filled with authentic, soulful mexican food and a happy hip crowd. Moreover, the owner really cares about his customers, he nearly went by every table to chat and joke with everyone!", "author": "Jenny Z."}

It's my favorite taqueria in the city; tasty, fresh and just so so so good. Been coming here since I was a kid and it definitely lives up to the hype.\n\nTips/words from a native:\n\n1. They don't put rice in their burritos. Why? BECAUSE IT IS WRONG TO PUT RICE IN A BURRITO. Don't ask for rice. They will judge you, rightfully so.\n\n2. It's not cheap, but it's worth it. If you want cheaper mixed contaminated food and some rice with peas in it, walk a couple blocks down and stand in line at La Corneta (This place has the same rating at La Taqueria on Yelp and this is just baffling to me)\n\n3. They charge you to take out beans. This could be because they put more meat or because anyone who doesn't like black beans in a burrito deserves to be charged extra. \n\n4. They have great ice here. Strange to say, but I used to love to eat it when I was a kid. Even the ice here is delicious. \n\nThe most important thing about la taqueria is that the name of the place is \"LA TAQUERIA\".

He was saying he loved it here because they don't have rice in their burritos, so I was thinking it'd be like a SoCal burrito. I enjoy both SoCal & NorCal burritos, I appreciate each take lol. \n\nAnyway, I order a carnitas burrito and chop it up with the cashier. I tell him that I heard a lot of good things about this place, and it's my first time here. He tells me that I need to try their tacos because it's what they're known for, and since I didn't order any, he hooks me up with one for free! HUGE bonus points for awesome service. \n\nI get my burrito, and demolish it. It's a little smaller than the burritos that I'm used to (probably because of the lack of rice) but it was very flavorful and juicy. It definitely wasn't reminiscent of SoCal burritos, but delicious nonetheless. \n\nThe taco was on HIT! Kind of fried, so it was kinda crispy and a little greasy. But omfg, I will order like 300 of those things next time. One of the best tacos I've ever had in SF.

The moist and savory flavor of the carnitas and noticeably distinct smokey flavor of the carne asada are quite good.  I ordered one carnitas taco and one carne asada burrito which came out to nearly $15, much to my surprise.  Cheese and guac on both orders were extra.  With everything you thought your burrito should come standard with as being extra charges, you start to feel like this taqueria took a page out of the airline business model and is just trying to nickel and dime you.\n\nBurritos are pretty small, the tacos on the other hand are pretty stacked (sticking with the tacos only from here on out).  Both, although good tasting, still were a little too mushy for my tastes.  Normally I'll also be somewhat uncomfortably stuffed after scarfing a super burrito from a taqueria.

I'd say the new residents that haven't been living in this town for long of course will jock anything they hear or read.

Its been in the Mission for a long time, and I gotta support that for sure. At least they won't be tearing that down to make some ugly ass high rise loft. Who knows though right? But when I heard that this place was voted the \"best\"  Would I cast my vote as this place being the best Burrito in the World or whatever.. NO.\n\nI'm not gonna critique the taste, quality of this place etc.. All I'm saying is this place is \"ok\". I'd rather you try it yourself and search other Taquerias.

Even South San Fran has some great Burrito joints.

I was surprised how thin it was. When I unwrapped the foil it literally broke in two because it was juicy. I had to carefully eat it to avoid it breaking apart completely. The flavors were all very good. No complaints about the quality or seasoning. The juice on the burrito though was so much that it was constantly dripping down my wrist into my cuff (long sleeve shirt) and required about 20 napkins to control. This is just too much juice in a burrito.\nSince the burrito is smaller than the average Mission burrito I decided to try a taco. I got a regular Carne Asada taco that comes with guac, salsa, meat and jack cheese. This was better than the burrito in my opinion. If Nick Fasanello got his idea here for Nick's Crispy Tacos I can see why - they are both double wrapped in corn tortillas, sfuffed with ingredients layered at the base with jack cheese and wrapped so that they bulge from the front end out of the wrapper. Exactly the same tacos. I'm not sure who came up with the concept first but La Taq's tacos work just as well as Nick's and are a touch more authentic tasting. Other than that though I think they are almost the same thing.\nI think La Taq is worth a visit if the lines aren't too long but better Mexican food can be found in many other places in the Mission.", "author": "Matt H."}

I can honestly say that they have the BEST tacos I have EVER tasted. \n\nThe tacos have a regular tortilla and then a fired tortilla with melted cheese on it. Your choice of meet, avocado and a lot more ingredients which make your taste buds dance. While this place is a little pricey it is beyond worth it. We ordered 3 tacos, three burritos and 2 drinks we spent a little over $50. Yes I know it is pricey and it's not a place where you can go all the time but it is so worth it. My mom and I both had 1 and  1/2 tacos and were really full so you can imagine how big the tacos are. I will definitely be coming back soon!!", "author": "Liz P."}

NO AL PASTOR.\n\nok. \n\nso as i was waiting in line, i witnessed the burrito-making process. one guy unaffectionately throws down a flour tortilla, with a rectangular slice of cheese perfectly in the center. *steam* *steam* -- hands it off to the next guy who places the watery beans and remaining fixins and wraps it up for the consuming public. \n\nthe burrito itself was pretty underwhelming. it tasted like something meant for mass consumption-- not terrible, but also not good. there was an excessive amount of sour cream and guac in it which made the burrito weird creamy texture. i would put it in the category of chipotle-esque burritos. in other words, if there is something better nearby, its worth the extra walk to have that.\n\nAnd thats the thing. There are 10 taquerias within a 3 block radius that are quite a bit better. Taqueria Vallarta, Farrolito, even the establishment right next-door Elsy's (el salva but chya ill take their papusa's intravenously if i could).\n\nBOTTOM LINE: this is just another overhyped, underdelivering SF food establishment with burritos that have been statistically proven to have all the requisite features of the most bestest burrito in the whole wide universe.

Like pretty much the expanse of the Pacific Ocean between the island and the mainland. \n\nThree tacos (2 carne asada, 1 pollo).  Each $3.25.  1 bottle of Pacifico.  Very simple and well done.  I finally got to taste the carne asada skirt steak with the right marinade that I was used to when I was living on the outskirts of Alhambra/El Sereno/Huntington Park.  \n\nI didn't like the beans in the tacos.  They kind of got in the way.  You can get \"sin frijoles\" for $1.20 more.  Yes, more.  I suppose they give you more meat.  Otherwise, I don't get it.  The tortillas were top quality and able to hold the ingredients adequately.  The salsa was good but it was the kind with the bigger diced tomatoes and onions like you see in the pictures.  I would rather have the minced roasted salsa but that's just a preference.  Also, I like my taco shop to have the pickled carrots, onions and radishes for me to top the tacos off.       \n\nThe pollo was pretty good too but nothing special.  The shredded chicken meat was good but can be found in burritos even in Honolulu.  In fact the guy that runs La Tacqueria de Ramiro in downtown Honolulu is part of the family that runs Gordo in S.F (and Berkeley) and does a great job with the pollo burritos.  Can't say the same about the carne.  \n\nIt's all about the carne though.  Four stars for the carne asada tacos.

They don't allow vagrants and crazies, which is an unusual big plus for a taqueria in the Mission.

Eating burritos. \n\nPro tip #1: If your stomach is a black hole like mine, top off your burrito with a slice of banana cream pie from Mission Pie, which is like two doors down. You will not regret it. Actually you might, but it's totally worth it.\n\nPro tip #2: Not a whole lot of seating (and a whole lot of patrons). I personally enjoy taking my burrito-shaped nectar of the gods to nearby Dolores Park so I can camp out and enjoy some people-watching as I gorge.\n\nPro tip #3: You have to request cheese, guac, and sour cream if you want it on your burrito, which you do.

I prefer tacos at their simplest--meat, beans, and fresh pico de gallo on two steamed corn tortillas--and the quality of La Tarqueria's ingredients really come through in that form.  The carne asada and the carnitas are excellent, the former with just the right amount of char grilling, the latter crispy outside, moist and chewy inside, salty all over.  The real sleeper is the quesadilla--flour tortilla fried on one side with melted queso on the other, filled with crispy carnitas and couple of shots of green hot sauce--which is life changing.

On a trip to NYC, I was introduced to the San Loco taco (which made me immediately dismiss all notions of yo quiero taco bell). And then I moved to NYC and totally missed all the Mexican food in Cali. I visited SF last week and had a crispy taco at La Taqueria. One bite of that taco made the trip all worth it. If you think the queso loco taco at San Loco is bliss, sorry you don't know what bliss is. I even made that mistake. And now I know. The glory of the crispy taco at La Taqueria in the Mission in San Francisco.\n\nOf course I went for a chorizo crispy taco while Jess M played it healthy and got the chicken taco. La Taqueria does not skimp on the meat here. My taco was bursting with crispy edged diced chorizo. The fatty juices were running and I sopped up every piece of chorizo that fell out of my taco and into my basket. The saltiness of the sausage was balanced with chopped tomatoes and my crispy taco was blanketed with a flour tortilla. The flour tortilla held it all together. I washed it all down with a melon agua fresca. Refreshing and delicious, one bite and one sip at La Taqueria will leave you wanting more of everything. Jess M held me back. We had more food stops along the way.\n\nI've had the burrito here before but crispy tacos are really the way to go. If you want a traditional plate of rice, beans, and a main dish, you can have that as well but isn't it more fun to eat little things wrapped in foil or edible wrappers? All of the agua frescas here are divine. In the summer, go for the watermelon. If horchata is what you crave, they have that as well.\n\nLa Taqueria is a no fail bargain meal. The food is fresh and the offerings are endless.", "author": "Rachel A."}

He seemed incredibly enthusiastic about the fact that they don't use rice in their burritos. Now, everyone knows that rice is just a cheap filler material that's high in carbs and calories, but I always figured that it was just a part of life. Sure, you could be the guy who asks for your burrito with no rice, but I'm more of the go-with-the-flow type. Like, the guy at the burrito shop (who makes burritos all day. every day. burrito burrito burrito) probably knows a bit more about burritos than I do. So, until I heard about this place, I didn't even know that the riceless burrito exists. I had to try it out.\n\nIt wasn't too long until I had a burrito craving, and then it was time to check this place out. The line wasn't nearly as long as El Farolito - only about two or three people long. I actually got my food surprisingly quickly. And it was a bit on the expensive side ($8-something for what amounted to a super burrito). They even put it in a paper bag when I asked for it \"to go\" (more on that later).\n\nSo, burrito bag in hand, I set off for my three-block journey home. When I was about a block away, the bag gave out, dumping my burrito on the street. Fortunately, the protective foil remained intact, so I figured that the 2 second rule applied (probably not a good idea in The Mission). Although I have to deduct a star or so for the poor bag construction (not really).\n\nAs for the food, it was pretty much a standard burrito, sans rice. Nothing really special or magical. I prefer the carne asada elsewhere - this tasted sort of like hamburger. I might eat here again, but there are about ten taquerias on the same block, so I'm inclined to try those out first.\n\nAlso, I'm a bit disappointed that very few of the taquerias give out free chips any more, although the chips were always pretty low quality anyways.", "author": "Dana L."}

It's loud, there's mariachis playing for tips over the crowd noise, and the line extends out of the door. Once you wait in line for 30 minutes or more, seating is hard to come by. Many people eat standing directly outside of the door. This is all due to the fact that they were recently recognized nationally as the \"best burrito in America.\" As far as the burrito, it was awesome. At $9, it's was a little smaller than I'm accustomed to, but that's because they don't put rice in their burritos. I had a carnitas taco as well, which was amazing. \nObviously this place is very, very, good. For people that dislike crowds and \"hype,\" I'd recommend going down the street. I withstood the crowds and the noise because  I wanted be able to say that I ate here finally. Eat here once, experience the epicness, and then decide for yourself if it's worth going back. If not, there are plenty of other spots close by, that are almost as good, and definitely less of a headache. \n\nVerdict: Best Mexican food around, although not the place to go if you want to sit down, enjoy your meal, or converse with your company.

A friend suggested we eat at La Taqueria.  I really liked it then, but I didn't realize at the time how unique and special it was.  A few years later, I moved to the east bay where I still live.  There are no restaurants in the east bay that I know of that serve tacos and burritos like they are at La Taqueria.  So I now commute to the city on Sunday mornings at 11 am, when they open the doors, to get my weekly \"taco or burrito FIX\" (the wait line is shorter then).  The bridge fare alone is $5, not to mention the cost in gas and time (two hours, round-trip).  It seems I just can't live without them.  But be forewarned!  I think their food is possibly addictive.  A lot has changed since 1974; the railroad no longer exists in San Francisco.  There's a ball park where the railroad used to be; pesky ball park!  But the (food) hits just keep on coming at La Taqueria.  I especially like how they don't fill the burritos predominantly with rice and beans.  Instead, they are very generous with their tasty GRILLED meats and delicious salsas (ok, a few beans).  Leave the rice to the purvue of the Chinese (and other Mexican) restaurants!  I'm clearly a \"meat\" kind of guy!  I hope they never change their food and never close their restaurant.

I have actually never had food like this. The chorizo wasn't chorizo at all. All they did was take carne asada (steak to you SF rice eaters) and put it in chorizo seasoning. The joint wasn't even pork! I don't know if they ran out and were to skirt to tell me or that's just how they do it this far north.. The taco was the most interesting... They deep fry the first tortilla and then put a normal one over it.  I had never had anything like it before. It wasn't bad. The seasoning on the meat was bland.. just salt and pepper it tasted like.. I mean damn..... . add some Adobo or somethin!\nIt wasn't bad food. The service just sucked.

Made a pretty lean mean because all it had was grilled chicken, salsa.  I put that green sauce they had by the table and it tasted even better.  Gotta try this place out one time if you are in the area.  I hope you don't drive in this area because parking is not so good.  But it is in the city, what else is new right?", "author": "Alice T."}

I work in the Mission so taquerias are a big part of my selection when it comes to lunch.  I've been to a few around my office but had always been told I MUST try La Taqueria.\n\nWell, I finally did.  And if you've made it this far you probably know where this is about to go.\n\nService: 1/5\nI walked in and the place was busy.  It was disorganized in that I didn't know where to go to get in line.  Some people were placing orders with the cooks, some were placing orders at the register.  Some were picking up orders and some were just walking up to get some forks and straws.  Very disorganized.  Once I got to a place where someone would take my order they were unpleasant to talk to.  I will credit them for the swiftness of delivering my order but that should have been an indication of how the food was going to turn out which leads me to:\n\nFood: 3/5\nThe fact that it took less than 2 minutes to make my Super Carne Asada Burrito should have been a red flag.  This wasn't speedy service, it was sloppy service.  Each bite was either a mouth full of steak and sour cream or a bite of tortilla and guacamole.  It was as if the cook just slapped the food on each half of the burrito and rolled it up faster than he called my number in Spanish and then in English because I wasn't paying attention.  This doesn't even take into account that half of the burrito had cold ingredients which is just unpleasant.  Also, the whole time I was eating the burrito a pool of grease was building below in my tray..yuck.  I will say though that had the burrito been more carefully prepared it had the potential to taste much better.  One final thing, they DON'T serve bottled coke.  And you call yourself a Taqueria?!\n\nPrice: 2/5\n$11.  That's what I paid for my burrito and a small soda.  $11 would have been acceptable had they included a bottled coke (not a 12 oz. cup).  $11 would also have been acceptable had they included some chips with my order.  But no, neither of these things were the case.\n\nI may give La Taqueria another shot some day because after 700+ reviews at the time of writing this one they've managed to maintain a 4 star average.

My dad took me here when I was young and I have not stopped coming back.\n\nAll the meats are great but I only eat the Carne Asada and if on a good day you come when you get the meat right after the they chop it right in front of you are a \"Winner\".  They use a higher quality of beef here than any other taco/burrito joint in the city.\n\nThey hot sauce and salsa are how can I describe it \"Like Krak\"  Cant get enough.\n\nIts amazing that a place like this is surviving with out having rice, chili verde and for a long time sour cream which I think is a sin to add on because it hides the flavors of the meat, but after the yuppies starting making this place so popular that is the one thing the owner gave into and I don't blame them.\n\nThe only CON that I have the the price.  Reg taco runs about $3.50 (far from the $1.75 years and years ago? once you add the everything on it its jumps to $6 bucks.\n\nRegardless of the price I'd still keep on coming back........", "author": "King L."}

This means that they'll fry up one corn tortilla, melt some cheese on it, and then layer it into another soft corn tortilla.  So, your taco shell is a three-part masterpiece, made up of: (1) an inner layer that is crispy/oily/chip-like; (2)  a middle layer that is melty and cheesy; and (3) an outer layer that is soft and mealy like a traditional corn tortilla.  It's the perfect receptacle for your taco fillings.\n\nI don't like beans in my tacos, nor do I like sour cream.  These are both standard fillings in La Taqueria's tacos.  I usually do two tacos-- always one with carnitas, the other with chicken or carne asada.  \n\nThe guacamole is really good, as is their red salsa, so I usually ask for both in my tacos.  I generally find the salsa to be a bit under-salted, but the meat is usually nice and seasoned so it balances the flavors.  Their salsa verde, which is available in squeeze bottles at each table, is a bit bland.  \n\nThe chips aren't very fresh, and too thick for my liking, but they're nice to graze on between each taco.  There's also a good selection of Mexican beers.  \n\nThis place is usually a madhouse at lunch, so keep your eyes peeled for seating.  I would sometimes walk to Precita Park to eat in peace, but you're not being to be able to preserve the integrity of the freshly-fried taco shell if you have your tacos wrapped up in foil and take them to go.

Also the worst place to eat if you have a weak stomach and are prone to food poisoning. I used to love the veggie burrito because they don't use rice however I kept getting sick the next day, I am guessing it is either because they use so much grease on the grill or because behind the tall counter the kitchen is really filthy. Its probably both.\n\nI ordered a veggie taco today and it cost $4.50 (the same as the veggie burrito? WTF) for one taco with only beans, cheese and avocado! Insane, why didn't I just go somewhere else. Then I got my veggie taco and it had a huge chunk of what looked like dried steak sitting on top of it. Before I took it off the counter, I asked if this was the correct order. The cook said yes, I lifted the nasty looking shred of nasty, dried meat and looked at him as if to say, \"really?\" It was so obvious it was not anywhere near becoming a veggie taco, he had to have noticed the chunk on top! ! He gave me silent attitude and a nasty look, the lady behind the register was offering me a new taco with attitude (but not my money back). Honestly, I would rather not get sick today, thanks for the offer though. One more place I will never visit again, which is really too bad since I live so close.\n\nEat with caution, food poisoning is just not worth it.

Two large flour tortillas with meat and salsa inside, mmm. I don't like my tacos with beans, but they usually include it. Anyways, the meat is JUICY TO THE CORE. Oh my God. Best taco I've ever had, even better than the ones I rave about at my favorite taco place in Santa Cruz. I usually hate carnitas, but this place's carnitas taste like sex in my mouth. Warm, juicy, wet, yummy, delicious, gimme more and gimme it fast sex.\n\nThe burritos, on the other hand, weren't that great, but were still good compared to other places. The tortilla on the burrito didn't taste very cooked (it was like they took it out of the package without toasting it even a little), and the carne asada, although juicy, wasn't my kind of thing. I like carne asada to taste like steak pieces, kind of like Chipotle style, not chewy, almost grounded pieces of meat. Not bad, but I'd get another meat instead next time. Their burritos are also particularly small.\n\nAgua frescas are also awesome. I wouldn't recommend getting chips and salsa - chips were too hard and crispy for me, and the salsa isn't amazing (ours got too wet, so the tortilla chips underneath got soggy). Anyways, next time I'm going to get all the tacos with evvvvvvverything on them! TO DIE FOR TACOS. Maybe I'll give the burrito another chance, too, just for kicks.\n\nThis place has been famous like since I was born, and there's probably a good reason for that. I've been here when I was a child and since my adulthood revisit, I would say its legacy is still legit.

First off the person who took the order looked like she could hardly be bothered. 2nd she lists off a list of burrito choices as if those are actually choices and not extras. \n\nCome to find out. Those are extras inflating the already more expensive than Taqueria CanCun burrito prices to new heights.\n\nI opt out of the extras and still pay $16 for two burritos. \n\nNow I'm at home and the burritos are far smaller than Taqueria CanCun's. Mine is very bland despite ordering it with hot sauce. And wait, where's the fraking rice? The burrito barely holds together because it is underfilled and rolled incorrectly.\n\nNow back to the price. $16 and change for very little food.\n\nLast time I was at Taqueria CanCun I paid $12 and change. I also got a burrito with the choices I want (not extras, and rice), chips with salsa and guacamole, and really great taste.\n\nTo anyone claiming this is the best burrito in town, or to be a burrito aficionado, well there's no debating taste, however I invite you to take a stroll further down Mission, past Cesar Chavez, and just beyond Fair.

The combination of thei special green hot sauce, smoky flavor of  carne asada, fresh salsa, and the cheese between the two tortillas make these tacos so delicious, it's actually making my mouth water right now. \n\nIf you ever plan on visiting San Francisco, you must visit this place! Very easy to get to if you are coming from Downtown Union Square; just take Bart to 24th st and it's a five minute walk from the stop! Otherewise, if you live in SF, be warned, this place becomes habit-forming!", "author": "Joel V."}

Tacos start at $3.50 but that only gives you the meat, salsa and corn tortilla. Cheese, guac and sour cream are all extra so really, a taco is $5+. But that's okay - they're gigantic and truly delicious. 2 tacos do the trick for me.\n\nTry the carnitas and carne asada for sure.

Instead, they declare either La Taqueria or El Faro as their own individual sanctum of burrito eclaircissement.  \n\nForever memorialized , Caesar Chavez, by the State of California, I finished an mid a.m. lifting sess and upon walking out, was hit with the most incredible cosmic rays of 2011.  It was glorious, blinding, and I felt moisture begin to accumulate under my pits.  I surmised Helios had ceased the mourning of Phaeton and has once again taken the helm of his chariot.  In gratitude for Helios bringing out the sun, I would have a cheat day and eat whatever and started looking at my phonebook to see who would join me on this joyous quest.  Alas, nobody gets Caesar Chavez off, so like a loner, howbeit a very happy loner,  I punched thehyperdrive for La Taq's coordinates and was off.  Parking was pretty easy, however, this was a working day and well past noon so take that advice with a grain of salt.  I worked around aimlessly trying to find it, backtracking and zooming in on my iphone gps and nearly walked by it.  I don't know how I did as it does say La Taqueria in very bold letters and was packed, even at 1:30.  Taking off my shades and waiting in line, I got trucked by a big boned woman, resulting in me dropping my shades.  She looked back and nodded apologetically, however, that nod would not magically piece back my sunglasses if they were to break; luckily, they did not.  A worker in line took my order.  I ordered a one carnita taco and one carne asada taco with sour cream and guacamole.  They garbled it back at me, however, did not know whether she got the correct item or not.  When I got to the register, the man told me $17.  I gave him a quick wtf look and told him I only ordered two tacos.  He laughed heartily, scolded the woman who took my order in a humorous fashion and adjusted the price accordingly.  2 tacos = $11.  Geezus christ.  Mexican food is supposed to be cheap...good god.  However, he looked like he was a salacious fellow in his prime as he was quick of tongue.  I can definitely appreciate that characteristic.\n\nThey whipped up my order very quick.  Taking the food to my seat to snap a pic to make A.Hahn jellie, I was taken back.  These were not regular street tacos you get for a buck.  These were huge, about 3 street tacos in one.  It was overflowing with beans and meat with sour cream defying gravity and perched on top.  The carne asada taco was okay.  The meat wasn't that flavorful despite being plentiful.  The spicy sauce was perfect.  It provided an instant kick, however, faded once the tongue developed an immunity to it.  The carnita taco was a lot better; the pork was crispy and had that snap, however did not amaze me.  Don't get me wrong.  It was good but only on par with the carnitas at regular taco trucks.  Taco trucks do not usually put sour cream and guac so you can appreciate the meat.  La Taq puts a load of condiments so its hard to singularly appreciate the meat as there are so many meldings of flavour.  I felt the food was overpriced for what is essentially supposed to be cheap chow.  Maybe they are taking advantage of their fame?  I would recommend this place however want to debunk the whole myth of this being the holy mecca of mexican food people want you to believe.

However, even here, the burritos are not good (I like my burritos plain - meat, rice, beans, and salsa).  This is mainly because of the meat.  I have tried the pollo, the carnitas, and the carne asade, but none tasted good, and I recommend that you, gentle reader, stay away from the tasteless boiled chicken.

With all the variety that the Mission has to offer, I just wasn't impressed with La Taqueria.\n\nFor starters, there are no black bean options. For the Mission, I'm surprised the healthier fare is missing. I like black beans. It's yummy & fills me up without making me sleepy. Pinto and refried beans make me sleepy and bloated... that, among other things.  \n\nSecond, there are no al pastor or shrimp options. What if I'm really hungry and my appetite calls for shrimp AND carne asada in my burrito? What if I want al pastor in my tacos rather then carnitas? I guess I will never know, at least not from this place. Don't get me wrong, the burrito was good. However, it was disappointingly thin & crammed w/ so much sour cream that it overpowered everything else. What happened to the meat? \n\nThird, I paid for chips and salsa. Usually chips and salsa are complimentary, in this case it wasn't. I was hoping it would at least taste good. Instead, the salsa watered down the chips. Because they didn't give the option of putting the salsa to the side, the chips lost their crispy crunch. \n \nFourth, affordability is lacking. It cost us about $25 for a regular-sized burrito, 2 tacos, chips, and a drink. I don't mind paying that price if it was any good. \n\nBottom line: I may be griping, but there are better taquerias out there in the Mission, ones that offer a better bang for your buck. \n\nBesides, I'm female and I like my options. When it all boils down to it, that is what La Taqueria is lacking.  \n\nTips: \n*Taqueria Cancun & Taqueria Guadalajara are always a fave of mine.         \n*If you are following the 7x7, King Bakery and their delicious coconut buns are located right across the street.", "author": "Joy A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-07", "description": "\"If I was on death row, La Taqueria would be my last meal.\" This is how I describe my passion for this food to friends who have not been enlightened. \n\nI'm a San Francisco native and I've been eating here for over 10 years. I've tried all the popular taquerias in the city: La Corneta, Pancho Villa, El Farolito, El Toro, El Metate, Gordo's (I was boyhood friends with the owner's son). And I can say, hands down, that La Taqueria has these places covered. Even today, I try to go back to these places occasionally to remind myself just how good La Taqueria is.\n\nThis is the place that I am always excited to take visiting friends - and then I enjoy reveling in their high praise.\n\nSo what makes this place so good?\n\n1) NO RICE: This is the only place that seems to understand the superfluousness of rice in a burrito. Rice is simply filler that crowds out the more tasty, expensive ingredients.\n2) Tender Meats: All the meats are grilled fresh. My favorites are the carnitas and carne asada. Very juicy. Cooked perfectly.\n3) Salsa Verde: The squeeze bottles allow you to heat up every bite.\n4) Fresh Guacamole: Their guacamole is in fact only avocado, salt, and lime juice. Simplicity is the ultimate in sophistication.\n\nNote: I've been told the horchatas are great but I can't speak from experience. They just aren't my thing.\n\nThe most common objection to this place (and you can verify this by perusing the sub-par yelp reviews)  is the price - a burrito w/ everything and a large fountain drink will run you $11. For some reason, some people are offended by the prospect of paying a price premium for Mexican food.  But in this country, we are not communists. If an entrepreneur produces a superior product, he deserves to be compensated. These naysayers obviously hate freedom and want the communists to win.", "author": "Chris F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-16", "description": "La Taqueria is hands-down the best authentic Mexican joint in San Francisco (and is among the best I've eaten anywhere).  \n\nThere's nothing even remotely upscale about this taqueria, its interior, or indeed, its location (all of which are or appear to be rather questionable).  But the quality of the food they produce is unequaled anywhere within easy driving distance.  At La Taqueria, you won't find a dizzying array of options on the menu (posted on the wall above and behind the cash register).  They focus instead strictly on the basics: burritos, tacos, quesadillas; chicken, pork, etc.  They don't even offer guacamole, but rather straight-up avocado, which is always perfectly ripe.  There's pico de gallo, and a hotter salsa to choose from, and that pretty much covers it.  \n\nThe beauty of La Taqueria's food is not to be found in the novel or complex arrangement of ingredients, but rather in their flawless preparation of simple, fresh ingredients -- which, when combined to form a burrito, taco or quesadilla, result in the most satisfyingly tasty Mexican meal you'll find in San Francisco.  \n\nAs noted, La Taqueria is in a rather shady part of the Mission, so it's best to visit during daylight hours, or as part of a group of friends (and this is definitely not a good place to flash a wallet stuffed with cash, etc.).  And because the dining room is small and always packed, you may want to order your food for take-out, and then bring it home to feast on.", "author": "S. K."}

I'd stay away from the speciality sodas (we tried mango and tamarindo which were thick and syrupy) but that's just my taste.

The burritos are average size- smaller than you would expect for the cost. Tasty but very basic unless you order extras and you should. Cheese, avocado, sour cream, etc. The special thing about these burritos is that there is no rice in it. The most  basic burrito will come with beans and salsa with a meat of your choice. The stewed beans have a very rich bean flavor which adds to the texture as well as to the flavor.  \n\nTacos are about 3.75 and they are fabulous for a light lunch and two for a light dinner. Their nachos usually come with a ton of guacamole and it's a nice cheap side dish. \n\nThe freshness of the ingredients makes everything taste great and even when there's a line, it goes pretty fast since the staff are used to working fast to accomodate to the crowds.

I feel that more lesser known restaurants in the mission make a better taco and definitely better burritos than this place. \n\nI believe you pay this staggering amount of money just to be able to say \"I went to the Taqueria, which serves the best tacos in SF\".

This was the last day on my trip.  I had seen Haight-Ashbury, Castro, Financial District, Chinatown, Sunset, Richmond District.  But once I stepped foot into the Mission, saw the people hanging around the streets and felt the energy there, I thought to myself, this is my kind of neighbourhood.\n\nI was told to definitely eat at one of the taquerias in San Francisco before I leave the city, and La Taqueria was one of the recommended places.  It was early yet in the evening but the restaurant was already packed and the line not short.  Up on the menu the offerings of burritos and tacos were all fairly familiar, except for one: lengua.  Or tongue.  As soon as I saw that I knew I wanted to try the lengua burrito.  I also ordered some chips and salsa, and to wash it all down, a mango drink.  \n\nWhile I was waiting in line, the Mariachi duo that was playing outside decided to go inside the restaurant to play.  Fun times, and at least several people tipped them after they were done with their song.  The pretty lady immediately in front of me in line finally got to the cash register to order.  The man at the cash register must have been either the owner or at least the manager.  He was very nice to the lady and tried to flirt with her, but I think she just tried to be polite.  Once it was my turn to order, he didn't speak more than five words to me.  I guess I just wasn't pretty enough!  But that's ok, brother, I would do the same thing.  Hah!\n\nThe lengua burrito was delicious.  It was served with onions and cilantro.  Normally I don't like onions, but in this case it worked.  The chips and salsa was also better than I've had at most other restaurants, and the mango drink was definitely a nice touch.

Whether or not they were the first doesn't make much a difference because it's the quality not this history that makes them one of (if not the) best taquerias in San Francisco. Unfortunately they're only open to 9pm so dropping by after a night at the bar isn't possible. Set up here is typical, you order your food and drink (they have fruit drinks, beer, and sodas), pay, grab a seat, and wait for your number to be called. The menu is simple, tacos ($3.50) and burritos ($6.50) made with your choice of meat, beans, and other toppings (like onions and cilantro, salsa, or guacamole). Unfortunately they don't have black beans if that's your bean of choice. Unlike nearly every other taqueria they don't have rice here as they believe it detracts too much from the meat. I would tend to agree with them after having been to El Farolito and had a burrito where a number of bites were just tortilla and rice. Meats here include steak, sausage, chicken, pork, beef head, and beef tongue. I tried the steak and the pork, both were amazingly juicy and flavorful, the best I've ever had. The tortillas (for the tacos) were on the thinner side so the tacos came covered with a second tortilla which ended up being a good idea because the inside one for some reason was a bit greasy but they were still two of the best tacos ever.\n \nFYI: La Taqueria was recently featured on a limited series on the Food Network hosted by Alton Brown as being one of the top 10 comfort food destinations in America.", "author": "Matt E."}

I do feel uncomfortable walking in this area alone or with another girl in the evening, because many guys will yell things!\n\nLa Taqueria (yes, the name is definitely not original) is busy at almost any time of the day although you can usually find a place to sit. After standing in the line and giving your order to a lady that will write it down on a piece of paper, you sit and wait for the person at the counter to call out your order (sometimes in Spanish and sometimes in English).\n\nThey have a few small wooden tables with benches and a few long wooden tables with benches (which are sometimes difficult to share). There is a jukebox on the far wall that plays Spanish music. There is also a neon sign that says \"La Taqueria\" in green the red writing. There are always people that look like they are Mexican here, which means that it must be good, right?\n\nThe watermelon agua fresca is AMAZING, you have to order this! The chips with avocado (not guacamole) and pico de gallo are really really good. My favorite thing here are the burritos, they literally feel like they melt in  your mouth and with the delicious green salsa, in the tubes that are on each table, they have mastered the PERFECT burrito! I think the key to their burritos is the tortilla, which taste more fresh than anywhere else I have been. They do not have rice here, but who needs those unnecessary carbs anyway?\n\nI usually order a burrito with beans, cheese and guacamole and every time manage to finish the whole thing, even though I am full after about half!\n\nThe tacos here are really good, the chicken is really juicy and fresh and the carne asada is very good as well. Pretty much anything you order, you will be happy with! \n\nThe only downsides about this place are that 1) they do not take credit cards (cash only), but there is a Washington Mutual right across the street and 2) the location is a hard to get to if you are not already in the mission and sometimes parking can be difficult, but other than those two things, this place is awesome, I do not know anyone that has not loved this place!!!!!!!!!!!!

The avocado was tasty, but it couldn't redeem the overall mediocrity of the tacos. Maybe their burritos are better?

Total price? $20. What?? They must have added it up wrong. Oh....my boyfriend ordered guacamole on the tacos......okay. Not sure how the price was bumped up so much (i'm guessing $1 per taco).

We ordered 1 pollo (chicken) taco and 2 carnitas (pork) tacos with a mango agua fresca. \n\nMy friend taught me to order them \"El Dorado\" style and also with cheese and guacamole. The El Dorado style had a hard shell taco wrapped in a soft corn taco. I loved how they really melted the cheese down and filled these tacos with heapfuls of delicious, tender meat, beans, salsa and guacamole. Melting the cheese makes a HUGE difference (versus just sprinkling some cheese on top). These tacos blew me away. The hard taco shell was so crispy and I loved having that extra crunch. I ate the carnitas taco first, which is also on the 7X7  100 Things to Eat Before You Die list. It's definitely something on the list worth eating. The carnitas taco was so flavorful and tender. I didn't think the chicken would be as good, but it also did not disappoint and was just as flavorful and tender. If I had to choose between the two, I'd probably choose the carnitas taco, but let's be real-I'm just going to order one of both every time I go to La Taqueria. \n\nDon't forget to partake in the agua fresca. I seriously wanted to try every single flavor. We settled on mango and it was like drinking a fresh mango. It was so refreshing that I couldn't resist and had to try the tangerine flavor (one of the seasonal flavors). Tangerine was good, but I wanted it to be a little bit more sour (it was really sweet) so I'd recommend the mango over tangerine.\n\nSee photos on my blog: http://rbjello.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/tuesday-mission-food-crawl/", "author": "Jackie T."}

I don't know the best or the worst yet, but I do know the good.  We came for burritos around 1pm on a Wednesday and there was about a ten minute wait to order and find a seat (obviously a local favorite).  \n\nThe menu is minimal, which is great if you're in the mood for a good, basic burrito or taco.  All four of us ordered carnitas burritos with cheese and avocado.  I must say, it's a pretty legit burrito.  Others have mentioned the lack of rice, which I'm embarrassed to say didn't jump out at me, but reminiscing about that burrito, I realize it was so good because it was chock full of carnitas, and not clouded with \"filler\".  They also did a great job of distributing the extras throughout the entire burrito.  \n\nVery filling, very fresh, very tasty.  A warm tortilla, some green sauce from the table, and a well stuffed burrito = a good lunch that may leave you almost too full for dinner.  \n\nThe only slight disappointment was the chips and salsa.  The chips clearly weren't made fresh there, so they tasted like they were out of a bag.  That's fine, but they weren't the best bagged chips i'd ever eaten.

I ordered the carnitas burrito with cheese, sour cream, guacamole, pinto beans, and pico de gallo (their pico isn't spicy, so need to worry if you're not into spice).  Every bite was as flavorful as the previous one, with a perfect blend of ingredients throughout the entire burrito.  La Taqueria doesn't use rice in their burritos, and some people might find that sacrilegious, but who cares if every second of consuming the burrito is filled with the desire not to actually finish it.  Not because it isn't good, mind you... but because finishing it would mean that there is no more burrito left to eat.  The meat was juicy, the avocado fresh, the pinto beans crisp... I almost can't put into words how incredible the combination of all of these things results in the most amazing burrito I've ever had.

I stole the recipe. Happy?\n\nI had the carnitas taco, which was as magically delicious as I would expect. The green sauce on the table (tomatillo sauce?) really added something special to my taco experience.

The melon fresca was like drinking a melon -- it seemed really natural.\n\nThe owner/manager creeped me out, though. As I came up to the counter, he ignored me in favor of flirting with three English girls who were just about to leave. I guess he was just making sure they had enjoyed their experience.\n\nWhen it was time for me to pay, things got really confused. I gave the dude a $20, and I got $8.25 back. it seemed like too little to me (2x$3.50 + $2.75 = $9.75). I was looking at my money, and he put a heavy hand on my shoulder. \"Everything OK?\" he said. \"I gave you a $20!\", I said. He pointed to the cash register, which was showing $11.25. \"So where's my three dollars, then?\" I said. \"That's the total\", he said.\n\nI figured with tax, it would be possible to approach that sum (I'm not familiar with CA sales tax), and I was too confused and hung over to realize that I shouldn't be getting .25 in change for a total also ending in .25. I figured it was gonna be OK, and I even tipped them a dollar.\n\nI sat there eating, feeling sort of jipped, but the tacos more than made up for the sour feeling.\n\nI'd come back, but be ready to do some quick math.

The cuts of meat are amazing, the cheese, guac, beans, etc are all made and prepared with the highest integrity.  \nI love the pollo taco (not asado) with cheese and guacamole, EXTRA CRISPY (where they fry the tortillas). I have been coming here since 2000 and I send everybody here. This is on my go to list for showing people around in the city. I have had La Taq cravings and my devotion is so gnarly that I will request a La Taq run whenever I am away from the city for extended periods of time. This is the first thing I do when I come back. No question about it. \n\nThey also make fantastic aguas frescas. I highly recomend the pineapple-strawberry combo. The menu is very simple: you have a choice of tacos, burritos, and or quesadillas.

Chips and salsa - fairly large portion for about a buck and a half, a bunch of thick corn chips piled high with pico de gallo, only problem here is that the chips get water logged after a while.\n4. 1 x carnitas burrito - see review for carnitas taco.\n5. 1 x veggie burrito - cheese, beans, guacamole, and pico.  Very tasty, but also watery.\n6. Large mandarina agua fresca - this was ok, it tasted more like fruit punch (bright orange and sugary) than fruit juice, but you could see bits of tangerine pulp, so I guess there is some real fruit mixed in.\n\nWe ate absolutely EVERYTHING and were uncomfortably stuffed to the gills for it.\n\nRandom observations\n1. They charge $1.20 extra for guacamole, so if you are a guac lover like I am, just order it on the side of your chips and salsa, then use it freely on your tacos and burritos, otherwise they charge you $1.20 per item you want it added to.\n2. When picking up your order, be prepared to figure things out yourself because they will just call your number and that's it - no one has any time or bandwidth to answer questions.\n\nI definitely think we'll make it a habit to dine at La Taqueria often...It's a good hearty meal at a good price.", "author": "Burrito M."}

Yes the tacos are on the more expensive side, but what's an extra $1.00 to you Mr. Yuppie? Maybe 1/100th of those out-of-style aviators you own? These tacos really shine because of their skin and ingredients. The skin is thick but not starchy. Unlike inferior places where the skin is just a medium to hold the ingredients to gether, the skin here really contributes significantly in terms fo taste. The meat and salsa here are equally great. I usually get half-steak half-lengau to create a nice combination of flavor, texture, and fattiness. The meats here are well seasoned and are not overdone like the other places.\n\nBest of all La Taqueria wraps your taco in a clever way such that you can eat it like a burrito, keeping your hands on the wrapper instead of the actual taco skin.

I really want to like La Taqueria since the quality of the food is pretty good (once I got over the sticker shock on how much we spend on Mexican food in the Mission).  Their burrito and taco consist of meat (of your choice), bean, and some salsa.  Everything else (guacamole, sour cream, etc) is extra which means you can end up with a $10 burrito very quick.  On top of that, the size of the burrito is pretty skimpy too.  The tacos, however, are pretty big and filled with meat and salsa.  The meats we tried (carne asada, cabeza, carnita, and chorizo) are very inconsistent.  Some meats are tasty, some are bland, while chorizo is overly salty and greasy.  As a matter of fact, I think the grease was dripping out of all our tacos and burritos.  \n\nConsidering the fact that there are so many restaurants within walking distance that offer food of similar quality for either bigger in size/quantity or cheaper in price, I don't see any reason to come back and pay $10 for a small burrito in the Mission.

I'm craving the tacos and burritos just thinking about it. It haunts me to know that 3,000 miles separate me from this establishment. If you haven't been, get the steak tacos with everything. You can ask for the tacos to be \"dorado\", or crispy, which is a nice way to mix it up. The avocado mix and salsa along with the good quality of the steak and the cheese is what makes it all work. You can add sour cream or hot sauce, but if you want to savor the taco, stick with the avo, cheese and salsa.  Burritos are great too, I love them here.

The steak and carnitas look and smell great and you can watch the cooks dicing it up right behind the counter.\n\nHowever, for a vegan like myself, La Taqueria is attractive as well.  Their veggie burrito is simple---just beans, salsa and cheese for $3.50.  Avocado is $1.20. While ordering, I asked the cashier to leave off the cheese and when she asked if I wanted avocado, I said, sure, I'll have avocado instead of cheese. She won major points with me for actually replacing the cheese with avocado price-wise--that is, dropping 50 cents off the price for no cheese, so I only paid $4.20 total.  Yes, I'm also cheap, and it really rubs me the wrong way when I have to pay for stuff like cheese and sour cream that I don't eat just because I want something vegan (I'm looking at you, Taqueria Can Cun).\n\nI also like that La Taqueria doesn't put rice in their burritos. Though this seems to define the \"Mission burrito\" it always seemed like an aberration to me. With just beans, fresh salsa, and added avocado (spiced up with the salsa verde from the squeeze bottle), this good-sized burrito was tasty and plenty filling. Maybe not as flavorful as other places, but it was affordable, fresh-tasting, and the service was fine. All in all, unless I'm in the mood for the novelty of Papalotes, I'll bring my next burrito craving here.", "author": "Tamara F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-31", "description": "La Taqueria is not your average Mission taqueria. \n\nFirst, both the tacos and burritos come with minimal ingredients. If you want anything more than beans, meat, and salsa, you'll be charged for it. I've seen conflicting prices on Yelp, but currently (I ate there tonight), sour cream is .50, cheese is .50, and avocado is $1. Chips and salsa are $1.20.\n\nSecondly, the bill is more expensive at La Taqueria than other taquerias nearby. Since the burritos start at $6.50 and tacos start at $3.50, it's not exactly cheap. A dinner for two (burrito, two tacos, chips & salsa, horchata, and soda) was $27.\n\nThird, the quality at La Taqueria is well above average. I'm an emphatic supporter of El Farolito, but I actually think the carne asada at La Taqueria tastes better. It seems they don't put a lot of stuff in the burritos because they take pride in every ingredient. A predominantly meat burrito at other places would probably be horrible, but it's not here. \n\nFourth, there's no rice. I love rice in burritos, although I know some people don't. I solve this by ordering tacos instead.\n\nAnd finally, the place has loyal fans and numerous accolades. It's almost always busy. Getting a table, giving your order, and paying can range from simple to hectic. Patience is important here.\n\nMy recommendation:\nCarnitas & Carne Asada tacos dorado style, + cheese, + avocado.\n\nI have to admit that the tacos are similar to Nick's Crispy Tacos, which sells cheaper food. I can't decide which I like more, although I think La Taqueria has a slight edge. The flavors are more complex and authentic.", "author": "Amanda C."}

Sad?  Yes.  \n\nI've come a long way since then.

(No refried or black, only pinto.) \n- No seafood.\n- Very good chance they will get your order wrong.\n- Nonsensical and inconvenient layout. \n- The ordering process is unnecessarily time-consuming and complicated because every ingredient that Mexican food places will typically include have to be ordered separately, and then there's the time it takes for the cashier to explain all of the additional charges...\n- The ingredients are too runny (not drained of excess water and juices, causing the tortilla to get soggy) and are unevenly distributed (not blended together well enough inside of the tortilla). \n- Burritos are served too cold. \n- Insanely long lines.

Upon entering this trough i was barraged with a strange smell I have never come across in my entire life. The only comparable smell was probably desert storm. For those of you who have never been in a war zone, the smell of a bosnian outhouse might make a better analogy. After hearing the rave reviews about La Taquerias famous carne asada, I was excited to finally reach this \"mecca\" of Mexican dining. I proceeded to the counter and almost thought I was back at the hometown buffet with my late grandma in Bakersfield. I ordered the carne asada burrito like a good soldier and what I got was a microwaved diaper crammed with diarrhea. The innards could be in a Chunky Soup commercial, except the soup would look like its been eaten and regurgitated and the mother and son would be vultures spitting it into each others mouths.\n\nI sat down at my \"table\" and gently unwrapped what seemed to be jabba the hutt's stunt double. After one lukewarm mouthful I set down the flaccid eight dollar bag of mud to abate my suffering and wash the salt out of my mouth. It seemed to be affected by gravity more so than any other object Ive come across since the war. Maybe it was like the camel curry I tried to contain in stale pita bread in Kuwait. This thing dumped over pathetically. The burrito was rejecting its own contents. The best bites were the ones with only sour cream. Luckily, this was half of the burrito. \n\nAfter finishing the burrito, I felt the urgent need to evacuate myself from both ends. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the bathroom smelled better than my food. i wonder what scent they use. id like to have it in my personal bathroom. \n\nThe salsa bar has four choices of nail polish remover. You could probably lacquer a bench with the pickled jalepeno juice. \n\nI felt crushed that I had to pay for this experience. The food is sloppy, small, unsophisticated and confusing. My sexuality is bigger and more understandable and thats not saying much at all. I wonder how many cows on the I5 have died for this place but they all died in vain. I cant even imagine a worse restaurant. The presence of this place in the mission is audacious and oppressive. I have to pretend that the building is vacant when I walk by it so that my rage doesn't get out of control. They should include a gun with the food. The perfect dessert. except you should first shoot the cooks and then shoot yourself for being so gullible. \n\nFrankly,\nFrank Peralta", "author": "Frank P."}

Only because of them I thought about not rating it on yelp. \n\nMy friend went there TWICE to try the \" Famous\" tacos and both times he said there was nothing better about the food than the usual taqueria food everywhere and his didn't like his tacos.  \n\nSo I did some research, and supposedly they are famous mainly for their \" TACO\"  the one with TWO tortillas, one crispy and one soft. That's new to me too... so I told my friend he needed to ASK for it. \n\nWhen I finally went, there was nothing on the menu about these tacos, ok whatever, I ask the girl with the nicest attitude (so happy to finally eat these tacos!) to tell me the different variety of tacos they had. \n\nShe rudely just mentioned what's on their MENU (and those tacos are NOT there) what a way to sell! Ok, whatever I guess its a secret\nso I ask about them... and she said ahh yes, we have those too.. but you have to ask. \nI said, well what if I'm a new customer and I don't know? she said well then you don't get them and even people who know about them and don't ask, we give them regular tacos. \n\nok, whatever...her attitude was bad, the rest of the food mediocre.. \n\nThe tacos were good (because of the innovative idea of using both crispy and soft tortilla) but that's it.", "author": "Geena T."}

She and all of her family raved about this place and said it was the best taqueria around.  I'm not a huge Mexican food fan and had never had a burrito, but this experience was great!\n\nIt was very crowded when we entered and the line was long, but we didn't spend much time waiting.  One thing I found to be a bit silly was that they charged a pretty hefty amount to REMOVE items.  It cost $42 for four of us to eat... that's a lot of money for a burrito.  However, the burrito that you get is packed with food.  I got chicken and cheese.  The cheese was a bit spicy (expected, but just a warning) but the chunks of meat were big and were very juicy, though I did find a lot of dark meat pieces in there which I wasn't a fan of.  The burrito was piping hot and I could only finish half of it.  It was extremely messy though, so beware!  When you take a bite, juice just comes pouring out of it.  My friend had a pool of juice at the bottom of her basket by the time she was done.\n\nAlso, if you're expecting to get rice in your burrito, you can go somewhere else.  They just don't have it.  My friend, who ordered for us in Spanish, asked the girl TWICE about the rice because she was so bewildered!\n\nAll in all, this is a pretty good place to eat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-01", "description": "A bitter cultural battle has been waged over La Taqueria's burritos. Some think they're the apogee of hand-held food; some think they're undersized, overpriced and oversold; yet others won't even think of them as burritos because they don't have rice. Well, they are fine burritos, and I, personally, tip my hat to their ricelessness -- but they're just a stalking horse. \n\nYou'll find the real heart of the place -- nay, the soul of San Francisco Mexican culture itself -- in La Taqueria's soft-shell tacos. Specifically, the vegetarian soft-shell taco with avocado. It is the single finest manually-operated food item of Mexican origin available anywhere in the United States. I brook no argument on this point.\n\nNowhere else, but nowhere, are soft-shell tacos assembled with anywhere near the structural integrity and complete gustatory synchrony -- of flavors and textures both -- found in these gems. Unlike soft-shells elsewhere, indifferent, unorchestrated assemblages that devolve on contact into a basketful of component parts, La Taqueria's tacos are robust and well thought-out, fireplugs of flavor and soul satisfaction. Two corn tortillas are lightly sizzled on the grill before being overlapped just so, steamed with jack cheese, laden with beans, tomato salsa and chunks of avocado and wrapped deftly in wax paper -- all by the same guy who's been performing the same task, in the same spot, for over 30 years.\n\nIt's the Aston Martin DB9 of fast food.\n\nFuther thoughts on the soft-shells: they don't absolutely have to be veggie, but you'll find their veg tacos' balance of ingredients so finely calibrated you wouldn't want to disturb it with even a chunk of meat. Oh, and don't get 'em with the green tomatillo hot sauce added -- it's so good you'll want to use one of the squeeze bottles at each table to personally slather it on each bite.\n\nTwo of these with a strawberry or mango agua fresca and you're eating the meal of the gods, all for well under ten bucks.\n\nGo now. Get two. Thank me later.", "author": "Douglas G."}

Whenever we go, I make sure not to wear red or blue so we don't get caught in the crossfire of those Norteno and Sureno scumbags.  Or is it cowards...it's probably cowards.  Most times that we go, we grab a quick burrito at Tanqueria Cancun.  Each time we finish our meal, my girlfriend says we should try La Taqueria because it may be her favorite burrito in the city.  On Tuesday night, we found ourselves in the Mission, and my girlfriend suggested we drive down to La Taqueria.  My reply, \"ok, but you know that's Norteno territory right?\"  So, I zipped up my black fleece to cover the shirt I was wearing, but like a moron, I pulled on my Red Sox toque.  Well, that's red AND blue, so those stupid gangbangers won't know what to do.\n\nWhen we walked in, I was little confused by the set-up, and I was not sure were we should place our order.  We soon figured that out because a very nice girl behind the counter by the cash register asked us.  I went for the Veggie Burrito because I am a pansy who does not eat meat.  As we waited for our dinner we looked around.  The place was packed.  I saw a small pack of St. Ignatius kids eating a meal.  What the hell were these kids doing in gang territory at 8:00 on a school night?  Luckily they were wearing red, so the Nortenos would not shoot them up.  \n\nAnyway, our food came and we were off.  When we sat down to eat, I was a little disappointed.  I asked for \"everything\" on my burrito.  This did not include rice or cheese..or anything except beans and runny sour cream.  I guess the definition of \"everything\" is different at La Taqueria.  The bottom of the burrito was soggy by the time I got there...which was about 8 minutes.  One of my pet peeves is soggy bottomed burritos.  A burrito should never have so much liquid in it that it gets soggy.  Another pet peeve?  No chips.  \n\nNot sure why this place gets such rave reviews.", "author": "Chris I."}

I asked for a cup of salsa on the side and was given one, as well as a dirty look. Sorry I wanted my food to go! Jeez.\n\nBut onto the burrito itself. It has already been established that they don't put rice in it. Fine. I order burritos like that sometimes anyway. But without rice, the soupy stewed chicken has nothing to absorb the juices, so they wind up squirting out when you bite into it and dripping all over my hands.

I needed to sober up before hitting the road so I decided to walk it off. BAD IDEA... drunk walking in the Mission with hundreds of cars rushing by is like a blind person playing Frogger. So like when I saw La Taqueria it was like God parting the sea..except I never got to see the burning bush after wards unless you count the dude wearing a weird speedos thing which I'm still trying to forget. \n\nSo I love Mexican food. I'm a total Nachos Grande fan because \n1. When you're drunk you can eat only with you hands. \n2. When you're drunk and drop your food it's only one chip rather than an entire taco. \n3. It's cheap Mexican food..so when you're drunk and throw up you still can afford to go back and get seconds. \n\nSo the Nachos Grande is huge. When I say huge I'm talking about a large plate overshadowed by the towering amounts of lettuce, cheese and guacamole. I seriously think that it came with a gallon of guacamole.. because that's how much ended up on my shirt. It was a pretty solid meal. I still prefer El Balazo but this place is a close second. \n\nAlso since I'm Asian I'm always trying to get my Mexican street cred so I got the Limon drink and flan. The limon drink was excellent! But when I ordered the flan they gave me the look like I was crazy. Maybe it was old or no Mexican really orders flan from there but it was nearly $3 and probably the only time I'll get it. \n\nThis is a fast food Mexican restaurant so there's not much I'm going to expect from decor.  I do love the ladies that work there. They are so nice and make such good food I'd marry them.

Well...I was wrong. My first indication should have been the taco price tag - $3.50. I thought - \"surely that means they do tacos in orders of 2 or something.\" Sorry folks. That's $3.50 for ONE taco. Granted they do give you a lot of meat, and I was full after one taco. I would even let it pass if it was a good taco, which it was not. \n\nSo I was expecting a true street taco, taco truck style taco. While it was in a corn tortilla, that was about the only similarity. I ordered a carne asada taco, and the carne asada was less on the steak side and more on the beef side. It was a like a weird mix between steak and ground beef. No wonder their menu options for meat say \"Carne Asada - Beef\". They're not the same thing but apparently La Taqueria has found a magical way to blend the two. That was strike one. Strike two - to my horror, the taco had PINTO BEANS! When the hell does a true taco have pinto beans?! Not that I'm the expert on tacos but I think this is the first time I've been served pinto beans in a taqueria taco!!! I asked to have them redo the taco without the beans - it was an offense to the taco! Strike three - no cilantro, lime, etc... Instead the taco was topped with some pico de gallo. \n\nSide note - the pico de gallo was actually some of the best I've had. And the green salsa on their tables is pretty kick ass. So basically I'd come back here for the chips and salsa, but that's about it. The tacos here blow. Oh - and I had no problems with the service here, they seemed pretty nice and redid my taco without grumbling about it.", "author": "Humaira M."}

Believe me, it brings great pain to amend my once glowing review of this my once favorite taqueria but all good things must come to an end. I proudly brought my boyfriend here during a visit to San Francisco having talked it up for some time. They were out of lengua so we both ordered carne asada tacos. I was partly in denial for the first half of my taco but then couldn't ignore that the steak was both chewy and tasteless.  I continued to silently eat my taco filled with a sense of defeat akin to finding out Santa Claus doesn't exist and hoping my boyfriend wouldn't notice how inferior these tacos tasted.

Come to think of it, so does the entire area around Mission and 25th.  Every time I find myself in the area, I feel like I am south of the border.\n\nLa Taqueria's burritos may be the best in the City, and the long wait and the crowded dining area are a small price to pay for a quality burrito.  Well, that and $6.50 + fixin's.  Cheese will cost you 50 cents more, sour cream - another 50 cents, and avocado - another $1.\n\nThe lady with a notepad was taking orders before people would get to the register.  She greeted everyone with a hearty \"Hello, Sir\" or \"Hello, Ma'am.\"  I was the only one in line greeted with \"Hola, Senor.\"  I am often mistaken for someone of Hispanic descent - must be my dark Jewish hair, brown eyes, a 3-day stubble, and a Giants hat.  I always smile politely and answer in English.  I wish I spoke Spanish, I really do.\n\nThe chicken and beef are tender and high quality (they only use white meat and flank steak, respectively).  The flour tortillas are soft, fresh and full of flavor.  Salsa verde is relatively hot, so warn them if you are a hot sauce lightweight.  I am not the expert on tongue and cow head burritos, but the traditional ones are unbelievable.  Burritos here come with beans, but no rice.  They're still very, very filling, believe me.\n\n400+ Yelpers can't be wrong.  Try a La Taqueria burrito and you won't be disappointed.  Sure, the wait is long.  Sure, parking in the Mission sucks.  Sure, you can get a cheaper burrito.  But you'd be hard pressed to find a better one.", "author": "Yan G."}

The first is choice/quality of ingredients, followed by quality of chips and salsa, and lastly the service.  Unfortunately, La Taqueria gets a low score in all three of these categories.  \n\nThere are very few choices of ingredients, for example, there was only one choice of bean. Other toppings, such as cheese and avacado, while available, require a significant price upgrade as does removing a topping($1 extra for NO beans!). Strike one. \n\nThe chips were...well...I'm not entirely sure, because they don't come automatically with your order. You have to pay more to upgrade with chips, and I wasn't exactly aching to do so because the chips were obviously not made in-house. Strike two.\n\nLastly, they don't bus your table for you. Call me privileged and selfish if you must, but I've come to expect to be able to stand up and leave directly after finishing my meal. I don't want to navigate my way to the back of the restaurant  with a load of stuff to dump in the garbage.Strike three.\n\nThese things combined with a high price point (for a taqueria in the Mission), and a poorly wrapped burrito ensure that I will probably never return here again. \n\nOn a positive note, however, the burrito I ate was actually okay as was the green salsa.

La Taqueria is unintentionally fresh, due to the high turnover.  The carne asada doesn't have time to shrivel in a steam tray, avocados don't even have time to oxidize, and the guy making your taco or burrito doesn't have time to use a spoon for the meat.  But don't worry about that last one, at least 33% of the flavor is coming off that guy's hand.\n\nRice lovers beware--they don't put rice in the burritos.

A burrito place on sfgate's 100 best restaurants (yes, I know it's not on this year, but I noticed it because it was noted that it just lost its  spot, so that was a good thing - for me, that is). That can't be right. *Checks out yelp* Seems to be a consensus - good to very good. Hm, maybe I'll try it one day. Worst mistake ever made. \n\nCame here after a day at ocean beach with my fearless dog. Pleasantly surprised that there was outdoor ordering and seating, though the register was always busy so I had to tie up the pooch and come in regardless. Came in on Sunday at 2:30-ish, one person in front of me in line and plenty of seating. I order my standard carnitas burrito with avocado, sour cream and cheese, hold the beans and chips and salsa. As I'm putting my change away the guy behind me orders his burrito and says \"crispy please\". \"what's this?\" I think. I ask the cashier and she points to the grill as if some type of explanation. The guy informs me it's extra good and I have to try it. I heard that they did this for the tacos, but for a burrito? Is it a chimichanga? How does that work? \n\nIt works like magic. \n\nThe burrito is fried on the grill (I assume with extra oil) to make the tortilla crispy on the outside. So good. They put the avocado on the side flap thingy (you know what I mean) of the burrito so it doesn't get mixed in with all the other stuff. Carnitas was soft and tasty. They got my funky order down. It was relatively fast. I am normally a eat-half-a-burrito-and-save-the-rest-for-a-wonderful-next-meal kind of person. But this burrito isn't as large as those crazy ones, and it's so good, I'm not sure how you would stop eating it. I'm calling this size, perfect. Give me a smaller better made burrito any day over a processed massive una mas/baja fresh one. \n\nThe atmosphere was better than normal shady looking taquerias, or the taquerias which were obviously once mcdonalds. I'm not sure what they do when it gets cold. I loved the outdoor area for poochie. \n\nOnly con was the chips weren't that great. The salsa was good and that hot sauce really is hot (you never know what you get when it's green). And even for the chips, I'm a flour chevy's style chips lover, so I'm sure to most people these are good chips. \n\nFood: 4\nAtmosphere: 4\nPrice: 5\nParking: 2\n\nOverall 4.5 stars. \n\nExtra credit: Pooch insists I note that it is puppy approved. 5 paws.\n\nI can see parking being a pain here.

I chose a burrito, obviously, and tried a special meat combination that a local recommended half carnitas (special blend) and half steak with everything on it including sour cream and quac....the end result was HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH!

A regular would order a taco from La \"Taqueria.\"  And that's just what I did.  \n\nI had the pollo and carne asada tacos.  Both were extremely juicy (not greasy) and piping hot.  The flavor was on the delicate side, which balanced out perfectly with their green sauce (standard at every table).  My day went just swimmingly after only two tacos and a melon juice.  \n\nLa Taqueria does not accept credit cards; but don't worry, local street vendors will gladly exchange a few bucks for that shiny watch of yours.

I have yet to try the tacos and plan to make an effort to, but ultimately I'm looking at burritos here. In that respect they come up lacking a bit. A standard super burrito runs $8.00: $6 for the burrito and then 50 cents each for cheese and sour cream and another dollar for avocado. While normally this should work in my favor since I dislike sour cream and always order my supers without it I still end up paying more than I would at most of the other taquerias in town.\n\nAs for the burrito itself the tortilla is steamed which, well, sure it's a bit of a preference, but I think the majority of us aficionados will tend to say that grilled is better. Also the burrito comes without rice which made it seem a tad skimpy. The carnitas was slightly crispy, fatty, and delicious. Chips, standard with just about every burrito I've ever bought from a taqueria, are also extra for $1.30.\n\nUltimately the burritos are really good. The problem is that they're more expensive and tad smaller than the competition. I can get a burrito that's just as good, if not a tad better, at Taqueria Can-Cun or Taqueria el Buen Sabor for less.

La Taqueria charges you extra for everything: sour cream, cheese, avocado, etc.  I prefer to be able to grab two chicken tacos for $7-$9 total, which is possible at many of the other places in the Mission.\n\nI'll continue to go back to this place just for the horchata, since I haven't had a better horchata in the city than La Taqueria, and if you order that with one chicken taco without the fixings, maybe one can keep the price to about $5-$6.", "author": "Josh K."}

No crazy cowboy beans, just normal pinto beans and just the right amount.\nI don't think they even use cumin, which is just fine with me. If they do, it's the right way to use it.\nI like that the cheese (if you ask for it) isn't on the top. It's melted in between the tortillas and the meat, quesadilla-izing it.\nIf you order guacamole, you get a little cup of avocado - nothing else but the best California avocados and maybe a little salt. \nThe flavors all seem to balance perfectly. \nI noticed someone said you shouldn't pay 3.50 for a taco (or more, if you get the wildly expensive 50 cent cheese - kidding). Well, these aren't taco bell tacos. No tacos compare. Sorry, I'd pay more. The quality demands it.

First let me say that the food is excellent. The Carne Asada's are huge and delicious. I always order them San Diego style without the beans. (they don't put rice in them either...thank God.) When you order them without beans they put extra meat in and charge you a bit more. The service is excellent too. Often times I will walk in there and find a line of ten or more people. Somehow the food is always ready in 5 to 10 minutes. Here's why 4 instead of 5 stars. Why can't anyone make SAN DIEGO style taco shop food in this area? (see Rojelio's Taco Shop near SDSU or ((still good but not as good)) one of the many Roberto's Taco Shops in SD). Every time I ask someone around here they give me some new place that makes it in the same style...Rice and Beans in a burrito...NO!...putting avocados on and calling it guacamole is like putting a tomato on and calling it spaghetti sauce...where's the green hot sauce?...rolled taco's?...please grill the quesadilla...on and on...\n  Someday someone will figure it out and kick ass in this city with this type of biz.

Why? 1) Two burritos (one chicken, one only vegetarian) with sour cream, cheese and avocado came to over $15.00 (that didn't include the two dollars that I WISH I had not put in the tip jar.) 2) These overpriced burritos had not a single grain of rice in them. So does that mean if I had not PAID extra for sour cream, etc., I would have had only beans and salsa on the veggie? The lack of rice and the extremely runny consistency of the beans made for a real mess, also. 3) I asked for spicy salsa and what I got was certainly not anything resembling spicy. I've had spicier salsa out of a jar from Trader Joe's. Sad. 4) They were f-ing SMALL. I mean, I really don't have a big appetite... I almost never ever finish a burrito in one sitting. I was still hungry after this one. I wouldn't be so irritated with the size of the burritos if I hadn't spent over $15.00 on two of them. I'm not the only one on Yelp who seems to feel this way. \nThe two stars that they did get represents the general good flavor of what I actually got and the speed in which I got in and out. If I had eaten them there, I would have addressed my general unhappiness of the product while there and either gotten a refund or had them re-make them. These burritos pissed me off that much. Since I live across town, it really wan't worth the trouble to return them. The only reason that I was there in the first place was the fact that I had gotten a cake at Dianda's.

Like, really love tacos. Sometimes a little too much. Much like BBQ (yet another of my culinary loves), tacos are inherently a modest and humble food. They don't take well to being dressed up and are best enjoyed with a beer. At the best taquerias, white collar guys in suits rub elbows with construction workers eating the exact same food during their lunch hour. Its a beautiful thing. Quality street food can be the ultimate equilizer.\n\nSo naturally, after moving here and seeing the rave reviews for La Taqueria on yelp, that it was Zagat rated, and even made Michael Bauer's list for the SF Chronicle of the 100 best restaurants in the Bay Area, i had to check it out. The only problem, was that i was unwilling to drive up to the city just to get tacos. The Red Bull soap box derby last weekend looked like a great opportunity, as it was in the Mission district. So after checking out the cars, we walked over to La Taqueria for some tacos before the races got started. \n\nThe place may have been humble, like a regular taqueria at one point, but now it just feels kind of stuffy and full of itself. I honestly didn't think a taqueria could get this way. And the prices reflect that attitude. Tacos start at $3.50, and thats with nothing on them. You want avocado? Add $1.20. Sour cream? Add $1.00. You can work your way north of a $5 taco pretty easily, and where i come from, thats unheard of. \n\nThe GF and i ordred four tacos (2 carnitas, because we really love pork, 1 carne asada, and one cabeza, because i like that kind of stuff). We got all four tacos with avocado and no other extras. Add 2 small fountain drinks, and our total for lunch was $25. We can eat at our default taqueria in RWC for just over half of that. \n\nGranted, the tacos were solid, i'd even say very good. The carnitas lacked that crisp that happens when all the braising liquid evaporates and the meat gets seared, but thats a technicality. I pretty much have to cook them myself to get them to do that. But to spend that much on 4 tacos and 2 drinks, those tacos had better be the best i've ever had. \n\nThats not to say that the place isn't good, it certainly is, and i'm sure that 15 or 20 years ago it was just about perfect. But it seems like all the attention has really gone to their heads a bit. Maybe i was expecting too much, but i was slightly disappointed.", "author": "Travis D."}

Went back last night for the first time in many months and I was not disappointed. Though many bemoan the fact that their burritos lack rice, this is what I love about this place. I'm in good shape and try to eat healthy so rice to me, generally represents empty carbs. I'll make an exception for the warm, soft flour tortillas that La Taqueria uses. Hey, we all have our vices. Yes, they're pricey and yes it does suck that you have to pay extra for items that are standard at most burrito places, but as grandpa always said, \"you get what you pay for.\" I feel that La Taqueria makes exceptional burritos that are totally worth the price.", "author": "Jen S."}

When my mother moved to the city in 1979, this was the first place she ate. The rest, my friends, is history. No joke, my mother brought my sister and me here about 2-3 times a week starting as soon as I could eat semi solids.  I would get in huge trouble for stealing my moms quarters to buy a \"mandatory bouncy ball\" from the toy dispensers in the back of the place. My order matured with time, I believe my original order was a chicken bean and cheese burrito with a fresa. Now my staples are either carne asada tacos or burritos, occasionally one HAS to get a chicken burrito because it is the best chicken ever. There is honestly no way you can go wrong, and it is worth it to try everything.  This is, hands down, no contest THE BEST TAQUERIA IN THE WORLD. Of course I am biased, as every Native San Franciscan should be when considering their favorite Taqueria. I will say, their prices have definitely gone up over the years, but I welcome that change as long as it keeps La Taqueria in business forever. I hope they never get priced out of San Francisco.", "author": "Molly C."}

Not to say that the Burrito's here in SF are any less special or kick ass than the place in SJ, but the Taco's here are something to write about.  Now going through some of the reviews for this place, i noticed that a couple people gave it lower ratings for their taco's and/or meat, but im assuming that it just depends on the given day, and that isn't any different from any other Restaurant in the city.\n\nIf you notice, i gave the La Taqueria in SJ 5 stars, and this one in SF 4 stars, this is mainly for the price hike in the SF spot compared to the SJ spot. I know its SF, and i expect it to be more expensive than SJ, but IMO its definitely still noticeable enough for a ratings drop.  And to be honest, unfortunately probably keeps me from coming here as often as i would like.\n\nA smaller part of the ratings drop can be attributed to the service.  Its not that they aren't nice, or are particularly mean in any way, its just that the staff here seem to be more neutral.  It might just be because the staff in SJ seem to be happier overall and more personable, but either way, i think neutrality warrants a small ratings drop.\n\nI've spent almost my entire life in So-cal where great mexican food is commonplace, so it says alot for me that i can find a good spot for mexican food here in the Bay Area.\n\nMost definitely worth a visit at least once!", "author": "Mark R."}

Throw that into a burrito with some simple mashed avocado, soft, pillowy pintos, and gorgeous homemade salsa, and you've got my favorite burrito in SF.

A taqueria without rice.  I couldn't fathom it.  Mine had meat, salsa, and guac.  It was just a tasteless wet mess.

They cook it just right where the meat doesn't become to dry and harsh like other places do.   Their Aquas Frescas are AMAZING!  Their fresh and tasty =D  Although their prices are a  little bit steep, it's well worth the trip and price to the Mission. Expect to pay extra for sour cream, cheese, and gucamole.  The only things that's are included in the price of the taco or burrito are the salsa, rice, meat ,and beans.  Oh and if you say no beans they charge you more because they put more meat in to make up for the missing beans.  Why they can't just put more rice in... I don't know.", "author": "Bertie Y."}

For years, I would make the trip from the burbs to the Mission just to feast on the burritos and quesadillas.  The last few times I stopped by, however, I thought the food seemed to be going down hill.  Finally, the food not only reached the end of that hill, it rolled into a bottomless pit and continued falling.  \n\nMy last visit was in October 2005.  On that day in October, I stopped by La Taqueria on my way home from picking up a dog I had adopted.  The meal was to be a treat for me.  It turned out to be a treat for my dog.  The quesadilla was so greasy it went straight to the trash bin.  (I didn't want my dog to puke up a greasy glob in the car.)  The burrito was utterly tasteless, but harmless, so I fed it to the dog, rather than waste the calories on crap.

The Chronicle was on the money when they wrote that the meat is the star at this restaurant.  It's true, perfectly seasoned, tender yet slightly charred carne asada.  Does it get better than that?  \n\nThe crispy tacos are made of one crispy taco shell blanketed inside of a soft taco.  This does two things; it creates a non greasy shell and it provides for one of the best textures that I've ever enjoyed when eating a crispy taco.  Guacamole, cheese and sour cream can leave you with a $4-$5 taco.  Not sure where you're from, but I order tacos by the couple... which can lead to a $10-$12 dollar taqueria outing (including drinks).\n\nThe prices are steep, the parking sucks, and the line that forms during busy hours is some what dysfunctional (line does a kind of L shape around the counter, the same place where people pick up their food).

For condiments of luscious sour cream and guac and other such fixings, each taco came to about $5. As filling and as magnificent as they were... $10 plus for two tacos is a serious offense. They were great, but I've had more mind-blowing, equally savory and filling tacos at the dozens of other Mission taquerias and littered taco trucks in the city, and not once did it cost me a cool $10--with that $10 I could have probably bought at least 5 tacos at my favorite truck, El Norteno.\nSo no bueno... I'm even tempted to strip yet another star for this crime but, I have to say, it was indeed very good and the day was saved by La Taqueria, so I will forgive them this one time.

In fact, I don't think I've ever had such a 'flavorless' burrito.  The worse part of the experience was I had to 'pretend' this was as delicious as everyone had hyped it up to be.  How sad...I know, I should of held to my guns and taken a 'firm critics stance' , yet, what can one say when their friends are looking at them with excited anticipation of my response and I then suddenly belt out 'yuck, this sucks'?  I mean, come on, principles before personalities, right?  \nIn any case, I ordered a 'carne asada' which is to me the standard 'getting to know the feel of a place' order.  You can get a sense of who they are by 1) how they wrap the burrito 2) the size of the burrito 3) what they pack inside the burrito 4) how do they season their meat and finally, 5) are the beans whole, refried or black?  In this case, the wrap was traditional (albeit slender) with a fairly tasty tortilla, however, this is where the good stuff stops (cold).  The burrito was on the light-side (as in girth), the contents were runny and not well represented and the most upsetting piece...the meat...carne asada - the staple of the mexican tradition; grilled and flaring with seasons and flavor, was absent.  It tasted like nothing.  I mean it, absolutely nothing...swing and a miss.  It only added to the already building disappointment that the whole beans (the ONLY choice) were runny and made a mockery of the whole 'carne asada mindset'.  \nI was depressed, let down and confused about what all the hub-bub was about.

Then the men behind the counter ridiculed her, laughing and pointing fingers. All while she stood there calmly waiting for our order. Taking the paper bags, she dropped one, but nothing spilt and all was OK. However, there was again, more ridicule in Spanish! When she requested salsa, the attitude continued. \nLots of other places nearby make equally tasty burritos for less money WITHOUT the HOMOPHOBIA. I will NEVER go back there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-04-23", "description": "Quite possibly my favorite of all the wonderful taquerias in the city. DO NOT miss the chicken or the carnitas. In fact, I think the chicken here is one of my favorite items anywhere. Seriously, the tomato-y sauce it's stewed in is not to be believed. So, well, tomato-y. And salty. And buttery even? I will crack this recipe! Mix that with some of the fresh 'n' tasty and avocado - oh my. Oh my oh my oh my.\n\nAlso some of the best carnitas in the city, whatever item it fills. The burritos are sans rice, just how I like them, and the guacamole is actually unadulterated mashed avocado. The only way the burritos could be improved would be if they steamed the tortillas. I also think the beans are just a little less tasty than Gordo's, but still quite excellent. The chicken burrito is so juicy it introduced me to the \"burrito suck\" method of consumption (you burritophiles know what I'm talking about). The method still grosses me out a bit, so I tend to opt for the messier method of just allowing all the juicy goodness pouring out of the burrito with every bite to just stream off my chin. The quesadillas (flat flour or crispy taco-like corn) are wonderful alternatives to the burrito, if you're in the mood for something else, and are arguably the best of their kind in the city (rivals: for flat flour quesadillas, La Palma Mexicatessen - but it's a close call; for crispy corn quesadillas, Gordos is still tough to beat).\n\nDon't forget to order agua fresca (basically pureed fruit juice in a cup). Watermelon (sandia) is my favorite, but the others are equally refreshing. The method of a server walking down the line taking orders and putting them in before you've even made it to the register means you never have to wait long before your salivating mouth is satisfied.", "author": "Veronica L."}

It bugs me that they charge for you to have your burritos without beans, but it's still delicious.  Salsa here is not good...it's very watery. The drinks are a joke in the back - you wish they'd at least have one flavor of fresh agua fresca or horchata (boo on the machine drinks).

It is not plain like El Taco Loco or El Farrolito.\n\nI really like the Cabeza tacos with red sauce.\n\nThe size of their Burritos is smaller than many other Taquerias but that's only because other places stuff their Burritos with a bunch of rice and beans, but very little meat with no flavor to it..  \n\nAt La Taqueria it is about quality over quantity.  If you just want something big to fill you up and not really enjoy it,  then I do suggest you go elsewhere.\n\nIf you want to treat your out of town friends or family to something good, then take them to La Taqueria.\n\nThis place is really bussy for lunch on the weekdays, but the service is fast!!!\n\nThe owner of this place is also really nice.  He is hardly ever there, but when he is, he chats and jokes with everyone.\n\nThe only thing that I do not like about this place is that it is overpriced and they never give you a receipt unless you ask for one.

I moved to Los Angeles area in the mid 1990's and believe me, LA has got some awesome Mexican food places - especially those roach coaches and taco trucks.... YUM... So, I've had my fair share of great Mexican food (not just in LA but in Mexico too!).  However, for all the Mexican places I've been to (note that I said places not restaurant cuz some of these places are literally hole in the wall or just some stand on the corner of the street by Santee Alley or Toy District),  La Taqueria offers the BEST carne asada burritos because the meat is so juicy!!!!  It's never dry like most of the carne asada in the other places.  The salsa is just right, not too chunky and has lots of flavor.  Their hot green salsa is so great that you can add a little or a lot depending on your tolerance for spiciness.  I usually top it off with the Fresa fresca (strawberry fruit drink)... it hits the spot for me!  I recently move back to the Bay Area and one of the place I made sure I introduce my boyfriend to was this place! \nNow, I do agree about the price.  Although the food is as good as I remember it the price sure has sky-rocketed.

Adding the SPICY salsa verde from the ketchup squeeze bottle on the table into the mix made for an endorphin filled lunch that was finished perfectly with a Dos Equis Ambar beer in the bottle.\nMy partner thought there was too much cilantro in his chicken burrito, but on a beautiful, sunny Sunday afternoon...it's one herb or the other and cilantro just wasn't the herb he wanted at the time! Ha!\nOverall, it was very good.  Next time, I think we'll try Taqueria San Jose which was much less crowded, may have been less expensive and looked like it had a wider variety of menu items.

A base burrito is about $5 but if you walk in and say \"I'll have everything\" on that burrito, you're bill quickly add up to $7-8, a little high for the late night drunk crowd.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-20", "description": "Today's dilemma was what to have for lunch.  I had been craving for a lengua (beef tongue) taco, specifically from La Taqueria, for the past week or so.  I compromised on that choice for dinner earlier in the week, instead willingly tagging along for rotisserie chicken.  So, the decision today was easy for me.  I didn't think I could wait another week to satisfy my cravings.  \n\nFortunately, it took us less than 5 minutes to find parking, which is close to a miracle around this neighborhood.   It was packed inside with hungry diners, but the line to order wasn't bad at all.  After about a 5 minute wait for the preparation, our food was ready.  I had a carnitas taco, lengua taco, and a cantaloupe aqua fresca.  For the 2 of us, it was close to $18.  Not a complete bargain, but you won't be disappointed with the tacos.  The lenqua taco is two tortillas, filled with lengua, and dressed simply with chopped onions and fresh cilantro.  Add some of their hot sauce, and you're set.  The carnitas is mixed just with pinto beans, chopped onions, and diced tomatoes.  The avocado, sour cream, and cheese are extra.  No need to add them though, since that would mask the flavors of the meat.  The carnitas isn't dry or overly salty.  The lengua is meltingly soft.  It is so tender and not at all chewy, as some other preparation of it would cause it to be.  \n\nI've had the burritos before,  but they weren't that memorable.  I go here for the tacos.  And the agua fresca, of which they have a nice selection.", "author": "CE Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-18", "description": "This is the best carnitas taco around here. The carne asada is very tasty as well but I prefer the roasted pork--mainly because most Mexican spots use the skirt steak, which is cow's diaphragm and that grosses me out. You won't remember the chicken, and they have tongue which may be tasty but you won't catch me trying it (hey, I'm a bona fide WASP, alright?). As for the hotly disputed extras: I order it with just sour cream and add hot sauce at the table (or order it as a topping for to go orders, and yes the hot sauce is free of charge). The tacos come with meat, a not-spicy tomato salsa, and beans, which to me is just perfect.\n\nThe beans are a nice touch because they are wet, so they add a gravy-likeness to the meat between the two grilled, corn tortillas that all comes wrapped in a wax paper sheath. Another note on the beans, they taste as though from a can, so on a burrito with no rice I just don't get it. There is nothing better than homemade, properly seasoned pinto beans coupled with smoky, buttery, tomato-based Spanish rice. I am so accustomed to the \"Mission-style\" burrito, that this lack of a carb filling, coupled with canned pinto beans on a burrito is simply unacceptable. As is true with most restaurants, I believe you must order certain items and only those items from a given menu, but this is more extreme (okay, to the tenth power) at taco bars. So, IXNEY on the burritos here--they are just plain weird.  \n\nA little word on the chips: while they are not free, they are much better quality than Faralito's one block away. You can tell that they are sliced corn tortillas that have been deep fried and lightly salted, probably on site, whereas Faralito's chips are from the factory (often stale) corn maize mush that has been prepared in a similar manner to Pringles. And the salsa is always fresh, although they are heavy on the cilantro (yuck...tastes like Dawn soap), while light on the salt. Some would appreciate this, although I usually add salt to the salsa and work around the stems and larger pieces of cilantro. And the guacamole is very thick and simple, not the seasoned tomatillo-blended style.\n\nBring cash and go for a carnitas taco, without tons of extras (i.e., pick one), the chips, salsa, and guacamole, and a Modelo or a cantelope drink. I've been doing this once a week or so and am addicted.", "author": "e f."}

Their meat is all from Neiman Ranch, their food is exceptionally fresh, their horchata kicks ass, and nobody in the joint speaks English!  Perfect!  That's what I expect from a real taqueria.\n\nBonus- they have trippy little stools to sit on while you fill your beak with the wafting sensations of your giant $5 tacos...  Well worth the price unless you are one of the rock-throwing yuppie-haters.", "author": "Jason B."}

Seating consists of long tables, benches and,  small tables w/ chairs if you're lucky.  Tables and benches lends to the atmosphere, an elbow on the table, balancing your burrito while reaching for freshly made hot sauce.\nThe Grub: I swear by the flour quesadilla.  A light squirt of oil on the griddle offers a light crispy crust to oozing cheese.  I do my own stuffing of salsa to lessen my chances of soggy a quesadilla.\nThe boyfriend gets the carne asada burrito, which is a staple on every visit.  By far his favorite and best he has ever had.  \nStaff is friendly and fast paced.  Don't be alarmed by the line, just copy the person in front of you that looks like they know what they are doing.\nLa Taqueria is from the days of the old Mission, while new Mission eases the trendiest of souls, this place will feed the masses!", "author": "Becca P."}

Was tired and hungry after a fun-filled day at sundaystreetssf, and wanted to chow down on some authentic Mexican food. My friend suggested we go here since she's been coming here w/her dad since she was a little girl. Had the vegetarian taco (gotta love SF for catering to us veggies!) which hit the spot. The best part were the aguas frescas though (fresh fruit, water, and sugar). As the name suggests the juice was FRESH, just the right amount of sweetness, and it reallly quenched our thirst! The owner gave us a sample of ALL the flavors (strawberry, mango, canteloupe, pina colada, watermelon). I loved all the flavors and got the canteloupe---the only flavor we weren't huge fans of was the pina colada. OH and the manager (se llama Miguel--I asked him en espanol HAHA) is super nice! He gave us roses (taken straight from the vases by the cash register but hey it's the thought that counts LOL)! Will definitely be a returning customer. !!Gracias Miguel!! =D", "author": "Diane G."}

But there I was, sitting outside at La Taqueria, thoroughly enjoying my carnitas tacos, when I witnessed serious nastiness. The grill guy picked up slab after slab of RAW meat and slapped it on the grill. Then he grabbed a dirty ass rag from his apron, rubbed his hands on it, and proceeded to pick up all the tortillas from the grill and put more on the grill. All the while I kept saying to myself, \"Please, just wash your hands; please wash your hands...\" After that, he used said dirty ass rag to WIPE DOWN the area where he was putting the cooked tortillas down. So now the same rag has been used to wipe raw meat juice from his hands and then to wipe down the area where they make the tacos. EW.

So here we go.... Hands down the BEST place in SF for tacos!!!! At least from what I've tried so far...I honestly can't imagine how it could get any better. Now, I've only tried the tacos so I can't really speak for the rest of their menu but I'm guessing if their tacos are that good and they pretty much use the same ingredients in their burritos then those must be the best as well. Be aware that their tacos are NOT those small dinky ones that you can eat a whole bunch of. They are pretty hefty. I usually get 2 but can only finish both of them if I am REALLY hungry. I typically get one chicken and one carne asada both with cheese. Soooooooooo delicious. Chicken is so juicy. The hubby always gets carne asada tacos with cheese and avocado. A bit pricey for tacos....$3.50 for a standard...add $0.50 for cheese and $1.20 for guac! But it is sooo worth it. Can't wait to go back!", "author": "BrElla4eva H."}

That's what I get for having high expectations due to all these reviews.  I'm sorta surprised.  San Fran is a foodie town with a sizeable Mexican population filled with residents having discerning taste buds.  Guess people in the City just don't know really good Mexican food.  Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad.  Fairly decent, bordering on good.  But Taco Bell, while clearly using inferior ingredients, is just as enjoyable.  I've had much better Mexican food in Sacramento, a city not as known for food and where the Yelp reviewers are waaaayyy less discerning IMO.  If you're ever in Sacramento, check out Chando's Tacos.  Similar to La Taqueria in that there's no rice filler, but Chando's doesn't have bean filler either.  It's meat, salsa (spicier with more flavor than here), and quac.  Slightly smaller portions, but cheaper as well.  Value is overall about the same, but Chando's flavor absolutely blow's La Taqueria away.  I don't claim to be some Mexican food expert.  I mean I grew up around it being from LA, but I'm generally easily pleased.  That said, La Taqueria didn't really impress me.  If you're in the area, sure, check it out.  But don't make a special trip out to it like I did.  Not worth the effort even without the parking issue (parking was an incredible PITA).  I tried the tacos and burritos.  Carnitas and carne asada.  I liked the asada better, but just by a bit cuz it had some flavor.  The carnitas were cooked well (hard to do actually so that's impressive) but really lacked flavor so it had the texture but not the flavor.  The asada chunks weren't too impressive looking, but at least they had a decent amount of flavor.  Nothing great mind you, but the carnitas are clearly overrated.", "author": "Richard N."}

We were here for just a quick snack so I was not able to sample a whole lot of their offerings.  The carnitas and vegetarian tacos were both good.  Two things I found somewhat odd was the price and lack of free chips/salsa.  La Taqueria is a little more expensive than other taqueria's.  Not expensive to the point of breaking the bank or anything, but still a little more than your average taqueria.  The second thing is that you have to buy chips/salsa.  Big no-no for me.

Loaded with meat, beans, cheese and salsa, not a single grain of rice in sight, just like I like em!  Even tho the line to order stretches down the way, everything comes out quickly from the grill, and you can watch them work as you wait.  Their grilled carne asada is superb, as well as the quesadillas...incomparable!  Very casual and informal, a good place for a first date.", "author": "Jeff C."}

I thought people give complimentary salsa and chips at most mexican restaurants but not this one. They pour the salsa over your chips in the same box container, thus makes your chips \"soggy\". The burrito was a little \"wet\" with the salsa water running out of it as you bite on it. If you like juicy burritos and wet chips, this is the place!", "author": "godzilla m."}

I know Mexican food in its many variations, from the slop of re-fried beans with greasy melted cheese on top in the worst of Mexican places in the US, to amazing fresh caught Huachinango fish tacos cooked on grills in the sand in small coastal villages, to fancy and superb restaurants in Mexico City.  I will say unequivocally that La Taqueria has the best tacos  I have ever had (make sure you ask for everything on it).  Now these tacos are not exactly \"Authentic Mexican\" tacos because they don't make tacos with so many ingredients on them in Mexico, but they are a perfect blend of authentic Mexican and Mission District Mexican.  What makes them so great is the amazing quality of the ingredients, the fact that they place a secret crunchy tortilla with melted cheese inside the tortilla they wrap it in, their special tomatillo sauce on top, and the fact there is not a grain of rice in the entire building (American restaurants use rice as a filler in burritos that add no flavor, if you ever get a burrito somewhere else besides La Taqueria order without rice).  This is the best place to take out of towners especially New Yorkers who suffer through some of the worst Mexican food of any big multi ethnic city in the states.", "author": "Mark W."}

My brother and his girlfriend were in town and for some reason he insisted we go here, maybe because he went here the last time he visited SF, a couple years ago before he had a sister who knew better.  I figured I might as well keep an open mind... I stepped up to order, a carne asada with no beans. I'm a little peeved that I have to pay to get my beans taken *off*, but I was expecting a comparable increase in meat or something. The lady at the counter did her presumably usual thing of asking if I want any extras, I declined, and she said, \"So, just meat and salsa\".  I replied \"... ... ... and rice... ...\" in a very confused way because I am apparently spoiled by every other taqueria in the world that gives me some more carbs with my meat and salsa. I'm from New England, so I obviously don't know what a real burrito is, but still... I took my tiny foil-wrapped dinner with the prominent \"No Beans\" sticker in orange. I admit that it tasted okay, but there was no flavor in it other than a hint of beef, tomato pulp, and cilantro. No heat or spice whatsoever, and watery juice leaked out the other end. This trip to La Taqueria did not dissuade my brother from the bizarre notion that the best burritos are to be found in Brooklyn(!) Next time we're going to El Farolito.", "author": "Molly C."}
