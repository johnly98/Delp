That's why I can't be considered a regular, but hey, at least I'm consistent. What gets me here is that I get my car serviced at the Toyota service center on the next block and I'm not about to drink the caffeinated swill in their waiting area. What's so special about Cafe Coco that it warrants my repeat business? Nothing in particular when it comes to their coffees and teas. All of that is pretty standard grade. I haven't tried any of their food either, but what does stand out is the service. Yes, I said the service. I don't necessarily expect people to be helpful and friendly at a place like this at such in godly hour.\n\nNow I'm sure the staff has to greet all sorts of characters who come in after they get off a crowded 38, but on a Saturday before 8AM, it's as still as a tomb. The server was a young man who really made a point to ensure my need for morning libation was met in a most positive, unpretentious way. I simply ordered a $2.25 cup of the Mighty Leaf Bombay Chai Tea without any accompanying baked good (a tower of strength I am) or even one of the sandwiches with the clever literary references. The tea was a soothing balm of orange, cinnamon, cardamom, and clove in a potent black tea (photo: http://bit.ly/2xOErZz). Bzzzz. Oh good, it looks like my car is ready. See you in four months.\n\nTEA - 3 stars...nice elixir as you wait for your car\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...relatively spacious when it's empty\nSERVICE - 4 stars...friendly but not unctuous\nTOTAL - 3 stars...not extraordinary but solid for what it is", "author": "Ed U."}

I go into the cafe Friday morning July27th 9:20am and found my sandwich being delayed 2 customers who came in after me got serviced . One with 2 bagels and another with some sort of sandwich. I dont know if the delay was because I tried to tell her she need to know what she talkin about. Or she got thrown off from my cool demeanor when she placed my order.

Speaking of the sandwich - it was mediocre at best. They didn't have all the options available for the vegan sandwich - hummus was included and not even sure it made its way.

This is specifically speaking about the morning crew, they have no sense of urgency when attending to costumers. I often wait for the 44 bus around 7am and each time I make the decision to grab coffee in the morning I end up buying nothing and walking out. This is mostly because it takes the staff several minutes to stop chatting in the back and come to the front to take my order. There's never a greeting when I walk through the door, I honestly don't even know I was in the store to begin with?? \n\nMaybe they should place a bell above the door to signal that there's a new costumer. There has only been 1 person (a young woman who looked like she attended USF?) that has quickly attended to me as I walked in. She even acknowledged that I was waiting for the bus and quickly took my order. It's a shame because I probably would've spent a lot of money here in the morning if I was, at bare minimum, greeted when I walked in. \n\nI also think most of the espresso drinks I've tried from here are weak and need an extra shot.

Today was my first time back. Ordered a coffee and a bagel to eat in while I worked.\n\nWhile furiously trying to connect to their wifi (theirs is down for some reason), I noticed 20 minutes he passed, and I still had my number at my table since they didn't bring my food yet. I look around and realize a lot of ppl are sitting and eating who weren't there when I first ordered.\n\nI walk up to the counter and ask the cashier (young Russian girl, I think) why my food was still not ready after 20 minutes, and then she gives me that, \"What are you talking about?\" look. I show her the number I'm holding and tell her I still don't have my bagel.\n\nShe then tells me to have a seat and it'll be ready in two minutes. She proceeds to bring me TWO poppy seed bagels filled with cream cheese and NONE of the toppings I ordered along with it (I ordered a plain bagel with cream cheese, cucumber, tomato, sprouts), but both plates came with one skinny strip of tomato and cucumber. Sorry, but one little strip is not worth 50 cents.\n\nI bring both back to her and tell her that I paid for each of the toppings I requested, and told her I didn't want that extra bagel. She takes my bagel to the lady in the back and instead of slicing the cucumbers/tomatoes thin, she sliced them thick like what you put in sandwiches. Also, still no sprouts!\n\nI feel pretty ripped off, especially since they nickel and dime you for every little addition to your bagel (they don't have bagel specials for a flat cost). If you're going to charge ppl for extras, then PROVIDE the extras. Geez.\n\nNot once did she apologize for all of this. Had she been more apologetic, I would've been a bit more understanding. I mean, everyone has a case of the Mondays. But her lack of concern was very evident.\n\nYou had ONE job. It's a simple bagel request.\n\nI miss the young half-Filipino girl that worked here.

I once asked for a toasted cinnamon raisin bagel, that's it - it took 10 minutes for them to get my bagel in the toaster, and it wasn't until I had missed my bus that they passed me a plain toasted bagel and mentioned that they ran out of cinnamon raisin.

Snarky?  Rude?  And sometimes just plain dumb.  And in saying that, none of the issues I have, if isolated incidences, would have me yelping.  But when this type of service (or lack there of) is consistent, I feel the need to say something.\n\n+ On numerous occasions (5+) I was charged extra for specific choices (different type of bread for my sandwich or extra avocado etc...) I made to my order that never came with the changes.  One day, after having this happen to me four times, I politely asked to make sure that my order was written down with all of the specialties and changes that I wanted since the last couple of times I had asked for them, and had paid the extra charge but sadly it did not come.  The lady at the counter just cracked a snarl and said \"sux\".  Yes, in fact it does \"sux\"!\n\n+ From what I can tell, prices are fairly arbitrary, and solely based upon who is working the register...\n\n+  One very strange morning, when I was waiting for my bagel the lady in the kitchen, who took agonizingly long, finally came out to meet me at the end of the counter to give me my bagel and said \"here b**ch\".  Then turned and walked away.  Having said not one word to this woman ever in my life and having just smiled at her moments earlier, it came as a shock.  The only excuses my mind could come up with were: maybe I was standing in a b**chy way?  Maybe she said \"here list\"  \"here pitch\" \"here ditch\" and I heard wrong?  Either way... what?\n\n+ And finally this afternoon, when I stopped in before my lunch break was over, I got a large hot coco, and after the lady at the counter wafted back and forth for the price, $4 (I sincerely hope you import that chocolate from Switzerland on the backs of magical unicorns for that price) I was given a luke warm 3/4 filled cup of hot coco.  By the time I realized/noticed, it was too late to go back.  I wish I would've checked inside the cafe so I could've said something there and then but I didn't.  My loss I guess.  That being said, if I am paying a whopping $4 for a cup of hot coco, please ensure that you fill THE DAMN CUP UP!\n\nI waver between believing that the mistakes are due to: laziness?  Idiot-ness?  or just plane loathsomeness for paying customers?  But either way, not acceptable!  Get it together, Cafe Coco, you're running a business!", "author": "Pb J."}

The coffee is not bad (I never tried the food).\n\nBut I will not be coming back.\n\nThis morning when I was drinking my coffee I noticed that a homeless man came into the store and purchased a coffee. He sat down in the corner of the store, towards the back, and was just drinking his coffee (I was one of the customers sitting closest to him and he definitely wasn't bothering me) when one of the staff members asked him to leave. \n\nI understand that a staff member has the right to ask someone to leave if they are being disruptive. This was not a case where the customer was being disruptive. In fact, when the guy was asked to leave, he was really confused and asked why he was being asked to leave. The staff member said it was \"just because\" and she added that she \"didn't want to make a scene -- but he would have to leave.\"\n\nThis is not something that I can respect in a coffee shop. You ask one of your customers to leave for absolutely no reason and are completely rude to him when he was not being disruptive whatsoever. \n\nThe man left the store and crossed the street in order to sit on the sidewalk and drink his coffee there. This is NOT okay. \n\nI won't be returning here and I've already started telling the people in my dorm (literally a block away) that they shouldn't drink coffee here, either. This place should be avoided if you care about other beings' basic rights.\n\n**Edit In response to store owner:\n\nHe should have been refused service to the store if he was not welcome. This would mean telling him upon entry that he was not welcome there, not waiting until after he purchased his coffee and after he sat down (approximately a 5 minute window with no other costumers in line or waiting for drinks). \n\nI disagree with how this situation was handled. The barista should have at least stated why he was being asked to leave instead of saying \"just because.\" That sort of behavior is intolerable.", "author": "Krista K."}

I only walked in to grab a cup of coffee, but the woman with beautiful eyes behind the counter treated me as I ordered a big meal.\nShe switched the TV channel to cartoons for my toddler who otherwise would be bored, and she handed me the key with a nice smile when she realized I was moving the stroller towards the restroom. \nPeople like her can really make our day, can't they?\nThank you for your wonderful coffee COCO!", "author": "Vicky K."}

I ordered a bagel here and it was pretty small for a bagel, it looks like they buy them at a grocery store and not order them from a proper place that makes bagels for example house of bagels. Their sandwiches have exotic names and doesn't taste anything special as the name of their sandwich. I told them that I wanted my sandwich hot and it turned out less than Luke warm. Maybe their oven is broken oh well what a shame", "author": "Lawrence F."}

They have the biggest selection of meal replacement bars (lunabar, lara bar, zone perfect, balance) etc. outside of wholefoods. And tons of random snacks and chocolates/candies to cater any taste bud. The sandwiches look really good and are reasonably priced, but haven't tried them. I am intrigued by the 'balzac'. Cafe coco seems like it's here for the long run despite the lack of yelp reviews. I walk by it several times each day and there's always people in there from open to close. Check it out and keep up the good work coco, i need you for when I'm feeling too lazy to make coffee in the french press and you're the reason my roommate gets out of bed on sunday mornings.

It's never overly crowded like starbucks and their coffee is delicious!

I ordered a coffee and a morning bun. The place is spacious and clean. There are lots of tables and chairs to sit. The coffee was fine and morning bun tasted average. My friend had a sandwich. I don't remember which one, but the cafe seemed to have ran out of the type of bread she wanted. I thought that was strange because I thought they would have been fully stocked since they are new. My friend wanted her sandwich on ciabatta bread, but settled on wheat instead. There were two people working there, and they both seemed nice. The only critique I have is that they don't seem to have anything that makes them stand out from the other cafes. It's probably a great place for people to study.", "author": "Anh W."}

They also have sandwiches and salads for sale that I look forward to trying.  The cafe is large and is a great stop for a quick coffee.

I haven't tried their salads, which I heard were good, but I do like their vegetarian sandwhiches, especially the Proust (I order w/o sprouts and with sauteed onions) and the Caprese sandwich. They also have a good assortment of baked goods and vegan/organic cookies which is nice. Free wifi while you hang out there, too. It's right in front of the 38 bus stop, so sometimes you'll see some flavorful peeps hanging around, but they don't bother you while you're nomming away.", "author": "Marie S."}
