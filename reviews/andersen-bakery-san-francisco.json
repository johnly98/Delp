She dropped them off on Friday, September 14th around 11:45am.\n\nLast time she brought me something from Andersen Bakery, I told her I loved the morning bun with berries. It had a nice bruleed top which made it sticky and crunchy. Very indulgent! She remembered that, so got a few similar sticky buns. Unfortunately it was salted caramel (I don't like sweet and savory together), so I didn't care for this. But it did have the same texture which I liked. My coworker who doesn't ever finish anything liked it so much, she ate the whole thing. We also got a few assorted muffins: blueberry, mango, raspberry which were standard.\n\nToo bad the sticky bun this time wasn't really my flavor. I still have fond memories of the berry morning bun from last time. Hopefully, I'll get to sample it again.", "author": "Elena N."}

If I could describe my visit here in two words, it'd be BAD SERVICE. \n\nI was in the area on a Saturday afternoon and decided to stop by Andersen for a quick afternoon snack. I was looking at the pastries deciding which one to order when an older lady working there interrupted me, yelled at me to hurry up and choose one since there was a \"line\" behind me. I looked behind and there was only one other customer. First of all, the customer behind me seemed like she wasn't ready to order and wasn't in a rush. Secondly, I HATE feeling rushed to order. I was confused when the worker glared at me and gave me a dirty look after she claimed that I was taking too long. I mean, I only stood there for less than a minute. This hasn't happened to me before in the past at other establishments and I found her attitude to be very rude.\n  \nEven after experiencing the bad service, I ended up ordering an almond croissant, which was wayyy too sweet for my liking. I have a sweet tooth and it was surprisingly too sweet for me. The almond filling inside the croissant was the sweetest part so I had to scrape some of it off. Not only was I was upset with the service, but I was also disappointed in the croissant.  \nAnother concern arose when I spotted a few flies flying around the pastries in the open display case. Ew, I don't want any flies or their dirty legs touching my food because that's just gross. If this establishment had their pastries in a display case, it'd be more sanitary since flies wouldn't be able to touch the food.\n\nI've been to other Andersen locations in the past and was never as disappointed as I am now. This Andersen establishment needs to step up their game and retrain their employees to mitigate the bad service. I know I won't be visiting Andersens again in the future.", "author": "Michelle F."}

Usually they ask you if you want the bread to be sliced or toasted. I understand that if it was busy that she didn't have time to ask, but it was just me and this other lady ordering.

She looked at me for a while like o had some stain on my face and seemed quite annoyed but I didn't care lol the food needs to taste fresh at least \u200d so she finally processed my order and slammed my change and receipt on the counter. So now I have to grab all my coins one by one \u200d and she's like you can go over there and I'll call you when it's ready.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-12", "description": "If you're in Japantown, a stop by Andersen Bakery is quite essential - especially if you're a fan of bread and pastries. With all the positive reviews I found on Yelp, I knew that I had to give it a try myself. \n\nAndersen Bakery itself is a small little store inside the West end of Japan Center. There are a few tables and chairs off to one side, but it seems like most people just stop by to pick up some bread before moving on. \n\nThere was a pretty large selection of bread when I came by. All of it was located behind the glass window - and they all looked and smelled heavenly! I'm quite used to the more Asian-styled bakeries where you basically self-serve the bread that you want onto a tray, so I wasn't prepared to tell the worker what I wanted when she saw me hovering over the bread and taking photos. Croissants, Danishes, elephant ears, all sorts of baked breads - I decided to try their popular Creamy French. They're able to help you cut it up into slices, which is nice, and pack it into a waxed bag so the oil doesn't seep out. \n\nI was tempted to try a slice of cake or a dessert item from their refrigerated section, but opted against it. The Creamy French and its many slices was enough to last me until the next day. The baguette is freshly baked and contains a layer of sweet mayonnaise on the inside. I thought it was tasty, but I wasn't expecting the sweetness of the mayonnaise (or whatever was in the middle). I can definitely see why it's popular - the bread is soft on the inside and crackly on the outside. Imagine that scene from Ratatouille when Colette is describing the fresh bread making that crackly sound to let you know its freshness. Yeah, that's pretty much the bread that they have here. \n\nOverall, I thought this was a pretty nice bakery to stop by. It's definitely a change from the bakeries I frequent, and I did enjoy the Creamy French, although I probably wouldn't try it again, just because it was a bit too sweet for my liking. When I eat baguettes, I prefer it to be on the savory side.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

Japan recently, I decided that it's important to have fresh bread. The selection here is always great, and the best part is that you can order loaves and get them cut into slices. For those who are interested in portion control, this is an excellent way to do it.\n\nI purchased half a loaf of multigrain English bread, cut thick. I love how they have this option, because it means I don't have to buy the $6 non-fresh-thick-sliced-bread at Nijiya. Half a loaf is $4.50 here and it's just about right for the two-person household I'm in, especially when I'm the only one eating the bread.\n\nBread, sliced and fresh, tastes amazingly different from the bread that is pre-packaged. I could still taste a bit of the crunch from the crust and the softness of the bread was incredible. I never had this experience with regular wheat bread. Since Japantown is so close to me, there's no reason for me to ever buy non-fresh bread again.", "author": "Robbin A."}

I used to meet my grandmother here often and we used to laugh and talk, before she got really sick.  I miss those days. \n\nThere's an assortment of goodies but I always ordered the fruit tart and coffee.  She would order coffee ice cream and we would share desserts and then sit and people watch; gander at tourists as they excitedly talked about cherry blossoms, or how fascinating Japanese culture was to them.  She grew up during the time when Japanese imperialism reigned over Korea.  Therefore, she had to embrace the Japanese culture by learning the language and by attending a Japanese school.  But, she never saw this experience as negative (as most Koreans would during that time), but alas, as a positive, learning experience.   I marveled her tenacity and strength.  She loved coming to J-town and Anderson's because to her-- it was a second home.  \n\nI passed by Anderson's a couple of weeks ago, while having dinner in that area, and it was bittersweet.  I would do anything to be able to talk to her again.", "author": "Soo Jin K."}

I grew up eating breads and cakes from them.  Asian breads tend to be silky and fluffy, and a simple loaf of sandwich bread would contain more milk/butter/flour/yeast=more calories/fat than a typical sandwich bread you might find at a grocery store here in USA.  But how can we say no to that, it's just too good!  My preference for breads have always been in the order of 1) Japanese breads 2) French breads and artisan bakery breads 3) Make my own 4) American generic breads.\n\nI usually get a half or full loaf of white pullman bread, thick sliced, and a loaf of raisin bread, and store them in my freezer.  They make great toasts, sandwiches, french toasts, and \"honey toast\" (Japanese dessert where you sautee cubes of bread in butter until crispy on all surfaces, then drizzling honey on top).  I also get chocolate croissants for my husband and blueberry pastries for myself.  \n\nI also love that they are a convenient, light snack/brunch dine-in option too.  They serve basic coffee/teas, plus a few bottled drinks, and ready made (but nonetheless quite fresh tasting) sandwiches, cakes, custard flans, eclairs, and recently started offering a couple of kinds of soups too.\n\nMy favorite dine-in option is their soup and sandwich combo.   For $6.50, you get a small cup of your choice of soup (I get their clam chowder), and you get to pick a sandwich from their selections (I love their chicken salad sandwich.  You can usually choose from plain white bread and raisin bread. I prefer the raisin bread, as the sweetness of raisins go well with the chicken salad)   I often get this for a light, quick brunch... portion is not as filling as a typical, heavy American breakfast of eggs, sausage & potatoes with bread, but my stomach usually takes a while to \"wake up\" in the morning so often times this lighter portion suits me better.  It's not going to weigh you down, but it's filling enough to keep you happy for a few hours until lunch or snack time.  \n\nI sometimes get earl grey tea with it too, but because the soup is piping hot, lately I've been just getting self-serve free water that's set up by the sit down area.  \n\nIn a city where there's lots of good food but most of them are pretty pricey, their price point and convenience is a great find!

At first I didn't know that there was custard in the baguette (I just figured that 'creamy' referred to the texture of the bread being very soft) and it took me by surprise at first.  After eating the whole loaf, I decided that it's on my list of favorite things to consume.\n\nI also scarfed down a chocolate European cupcake, which is pretty much like a very almond-y cupcake sans frosting, but with chocolate chips on top.  Light, moist, super delicious as well.\n\nI'm in the process of finishing up my chocolate croissant and raspberry cream cheese strudel, but I can tell you that the 5-star rating still stands.\n\nThis is my new favorite place to go for some guilty breakfast pleasures.

I sometimes make a run over to Jtown specifically to pick up a half loaf.  I'm a crust girl, and so I just love how the crust on this bread is thick but not crunchy-- just the right amount of chewiness and carby goodness.  And the white insides of the bread?  SUPER soft, a little savory, and just perfect for making a great sandwich (or, if you're like me, for chomping on when you have a hankering for filling 200% of your carb quotient of the day :D  I can't help myself-- I love myself some carbs-- esp bread!).  Honestly, a couple slices of avocado and some soy sauce or salt spread generously over a browned slice of this bread?  Good lord, I am salivating now thinking about it . . .  :D\n\nI haven't ordered their other breads and buns specifically, but I've tried the samples, and they're all pretty good, standard Japanese breads (or, at least, the Japanese take on European-style pastries).

That has now expanded here. As a Dane who grew up loving the real flaky pastries with custard on them, the fresh soft french breads and rolls, the poppy seed rolls with a little bit of marcipan inside, on and on, you will leave without buying anything.

It's a well known chain, and I was happy to finally see it come to SF.  If you can't get yourself down to Clement Street and Schubert's Bakery, this is a good alternative.", "author": "Kristina R."}

I like the creme brulee, by far the best creme brulee I've had that wasn't in a fancy sit down restaurant.  You can taste a hint of rum and its rich velvety custard melts in your mouth.  While I like the breads, I'm a fan of the creme brulee.", "author": "Peachie Y."}

They were not open yet but noticed we were waiting outside and let us in early since we were only looking to buy pastries. To top it off the raspberry cream cheese pastry was awesome! I will make it a point to go here again when I visit San Francisco.Also the pesto bread we bough to take home was also delicious.", "author": "Rick H."}

The palmiers are always delicious, as is the pesto cheese bread, both kinds of sandwiches, the anpan, and the cakes. I will usually come here after a meal if I don't have the cash needed for Cafe Hana. Two items will usually come out to just over $5 dollars, which is the minimum amount required to use your debit/credit card. ;)", "author": "M S."}

Truth be told, we went to Sophie's Crepes first, but it was a chaotic zoo, so we wandered across the foot bridge to see if Andersen's was even open (which they were). The prices are really reasonable, but I was a little put off when the counter guy came around to ask us to hurry up and finish because they were closing in ten minutes (we were practically done, anyway), but did not ask the same of any of the other dining room patrons. Also, neither of us was very impressed with our selections -- the Bread Pudding was soggy and had a dollop of some unidentifiable fruit compote in its center, whereas the Dream Cake should be renamed Dry Cake. Maybe their many other offerings are better, but I can't see myself rushing back here for second chances after this lackluster demonstration of quality and service.", "author": "Gregor G."}

My girlfriend suggested this place and raved about how I have to try the Jalapeno Cheese Bread.  She was totally right!  That is the best Jalapeno bread I've ever tasted.  We also tried the Cream Cheese Schnitten (austrian sweet bread with creamcheese filling) that was amazing.  Before my trip back to San Diego, I made the mistake of only purchasing 2 jalapeno breads and one of every flavor of cheese bread.  The pesto ranks 2nd and the international cheese 3rd.  The next time I'm up there, I'll make it a point to stock up on the Jalapeno Bread.  This place is a must see!", "author": "Kay C."}

I had a strawberry croissant which is basically a croissant with a few strawberries nestled in the middle of it, it rocked my socks. This place is fine to go by yourself or with one other person, but don't go with a group since the tables only have two chairs a piece. It isn't expensive at all, so give it a shot. I payed $3 for my strawberry croissant and a carton of milk. Definitely well worth it.", "author": "Clara M."}
