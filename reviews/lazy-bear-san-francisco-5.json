From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted with a lavish setting of open kitchen and coordinated service. Our servers immediately remembered our names from first mention and took us upstairs to observe the final moments of the party before us. We came on a Thursday and participated in the second seating at 8:30pm. \n\n[price] \nOne of my favorite dining experiences from the concept and the food, but the 4/5 rating is with the length of the meal and the first party cutting into ours. I'm not as happy about the price as this whole meal is pretty standard with the SF fine dining scene and Lazy Bear is two Michelin stars. \n\n[dinner] \n\nDinner lasted about three hours and we really started eating at about 9. We got to the restaurant about 8:25 and snacked and sipped for a while before heading downstairs. It's a communal experience, I observed some parties hitting it off with those sitting next to each other, but I went with a group of four so we had no new friends. I highly recommend coming on the weekend or taking a first seating on the weekend as this meal was an extremely long time to be eating on a weekday. I loved the food and experience, but I was so exhausted by the end of the meal that I couldn't enjoy the remaining desserts and wanted to just fall asleep at the table. \n\nFood Highlights: \n- Egg breakfast started served at the bar upstairs \n- tomato first course (I have never eaten tomatoes like this, where every one tasted so unique) \n- Miso Soup / caviar variation medley from the smoked fish hanging in the restaurant (so flavorful I still think about this dish)  \n- lamb\n- raspberry sorbet \n\n[wine pairing]\n\nThis is not necessary as the prix fix comes with two drinks to start you off. However, I really enjoyed the pairing as I splurged for my birthday. It comes out to about four glasses of wine and a stout beer taster at the end. I would consider myself a heavyweight, but given the lateness of the meal and having not eaten anything until that point, I was pretty sleepy and tipsy at the end. \n\nI came for my birthday but the restaurant doesn't do anything excessive to mark your occasion other than all the waiters knowing it's your birthday (if you're looking for a vibrant celebration and a candle this meal might not be for you.)", "author": "Alice Z."}

I loved how the staff all signed the congratulation cards and we were treated to the highest esteem on arrival. Unfortunately, much of the food felt rushed when delivered and the restaurant was booked to full capacity and it just felt weird standing around, shoulder to shoulder, waiting to be served a fancy meal. Once we moved downstairs, I was disappointed that I couldn't sit adjacent to my wife, but was forced to make superficial, but pleasant acquaintances. Overall, the uncomfortable situation disengaged me from this dining experience. Furthermore, despite multiple attempts to ask for a photo with the chefs (with different waiters), I was given confirmatory nods, only having to wait an additional 20 minutes after the dinner concluded, standing awkwardly, just realizing the staffs have completely forgotten about us. \n\nIn terms of the food, they were not avant garde, but certainly quite visually stimulating and mild and subtle with an expert use of the local seasonal ingredients. Despite the more expensive wine pairing option, I was disappointed by how little the dishes 'popped' with the wine.\n\nOverall, the experience felt disappointing, especially when considering how expensive this food endeavor was.

Ugh, anyways...\n\nWe came here last week because it was National Boyfriend Day. Since I'm a horrible cook, I decided to take him to Lazy Bear. I was a little hesitant at first just because I understand that sitting at a community table means socializing. And sometimes I just hate people oh shit did I really type that? \n\nYou start off by chilling on the second floor, where they hook you up with a small drink (which was delicious btw). You then proceed with the first 5 appetizers. Honestly, they were the best few bites out of the entire dinner session. My favorite bite was the raw oyster with tomato foam, least favorite was the fried sweet breads. \n\nMoving onto the main course, we were walked down to the dining area...and this is where I started worrying about having to act all interested in people's lives that I didn't give two fucks about. We were encouraged to introduce ourselves to the people around us, but ya girl ain't about to talk to more people after getting off a customer service job.\n\nMy favorite main dish was probably the squash and lobster, which consisted of silky squash foam, and perfectly cooked lobster. My least favorite dish was the beans with ham soup. I hate beans, and I was hoping maybe this dish would change my mind. But I still hate beans. Also, the ham soup was super salty, which ruined the whole thing for me. One more dish I had to point out was the Miyazaki A5 wagyu. I had high hopes for this but it honestly wasn't as delicious as I've hoped (I've had better elsewhere). The texture just wasn't buttery and tender like it should be.\n\nTheir dessert courses were really pretty though. I prefer savory over sweet, but these were a-okay. They provided some add-on options for drinks at the end and we opted for the cold brew, which was B O M B. Super creamy, super delicious. \n\nI'll probably be back again because the experience was pretty awesome. We got to stand up and talk to the chefs and they encouraged us to take pictures while they worked, which I thought was really cool. But paying over $500 for two people, I wish I got more food.

Totally worth the money and it wholeheartedly deserves the 2 michelin stars. \n\nYou start off in the small area above the main restaurant, kind of like a hunting lodge, where they serve the first 5 appetizers. Now these dishes are hard to explain, but the extraordinary flavors they manage to coerce out of seemingly normal ingredients is what sets Lazy bear apart. \n\nThis is a communal dining experience, so when you get seated in the main hall, you are encouraged to chat with your fellow diners. It is a unique concept and certainly makes the dining experience more memorable. I won't go into the details of all the 18+ courses as that would make this review into an essay! Needless to say, everything was delicious, my personal favorites were the wagyu beef and the king salmon!\n\nHighly recommended even with the steep price, great place to celebrate an occasion.

But for the sake of a decent review, I'll give a short rundown of what I liked and didn't like.\n\nFirst off, the service was top notch and I liked that both the servers and chefs kept things casual cause I'm not into all that unnatural (formal) attitude. \n\nFood wise is where I had to knock a star off... the appetizers (small bites) were all pretty good, highlighted by raw oysters with a tomato foam dressing which were my favorite during our seating. As far as the main dinner courses went, there were 3 dishes that had me slightly disappointed... first there was a dish that consisted of beans and a ham broth... the broth was what saved the dish cause I hate beans with a passion, and I realize now that nothing can make beans taste good. Secondly, there's the squab which had nice flavors but I thought it could be a bit more tender, and finally the Miyazaki A5 ribeye. This dish sounded great on paper, but beef turned out to be not as buttery as other A5s I've had and I've had my share of A5s! So because of these reasons I had to give my experience a 4 Star... \n\nBut since the menu constantly changes, I'll probably be back again in the future because the experience itself was pretty special and unique.", "author": "Marco M."}

I really enjoyed the whimsical nature of some of the decor as well. It made me feel a little more comfortable. \n\nThe only notes were that I was really hoping to get some of the cocktails that were in the pictures online but not sure if that is a specialty seasonal item. I also really enjoyed the family style atmosphere and the fact that you could go up and talk to the chefs. \n\nThe meal was delicious and again an event in itself. One that stood out to me was the oyster, not because it was my favorite but because it took me somewhere. I literally felt like I was taken to the ocean for a moment and it was amazing that you can experience that with some foam and an oyster!

It is an interesting take on the concept, some things I found refreshing and some things I found a bit gimmicky.\n\nThe dinner starts with some small bites and cocktails upstairs, where you can mingle, talk to your friends or watch the diners downstairs. The bites were delicious and this felt like coming into someone's home for a dinner party.\n\nWhen the time comes, you are called to the tables in the main dining hall. The tables are long shared tables. A little too close for my comfort. They give you a little booklet and a pencil to take notes (I thought this was gimmicky). When the dinner services starts, they serve all the diners at once. While this is efficient, I kind of found it impersonal and a bit too much like an assembly line. The courses came very quickly and you don't really get a breather. \n\nWe had the wine pairings, which I found to be a bit boring or a miss.

My aunt knows I'm a foodie, and so she treated me and a friend to Lazy Bear for my graduation! It was so special to spend it with her, and amazing food! Lazy Bear def deserves its 2 Michelin stars..and hopefully a third star for them next year! \n\nLazy Bear has a supper club type of theme, and so there are 2 long tables. There is a 6 PM dinner time, and an 8:30 pm dinner time each night. We went to the 6 PM one, and doors opened at 5:30. We were greeted immediately by an amazing staff, who took our jackets and bags. They escorted us upstairs, where a few of the appetizers and drinks are first served. I think after the fifth course they bring us downstairs to the long tables. Before I continue on with the other courses, I must say, the beginning appetizers are amazing! They served unique drinks like rhubard, which I love! And it had yogurt on top! Another one of my favorite appetizers was a flatbread with eggplant and goat cheese on top of it..yummm! There were also other delicious dishes like soft shelled crab, and egg foam with an oyster.\n\nWhen we went downstairs to the long tables, we were led to our assigned seats, and then were able to talk to the other parties next to us. It was a fun experience to enjoy amazing food with random strangers and hear about their lives and how they came to Lazy Bear :) The main chef also introduced himself and encouraged us to be involved with the chefs. Their kitchen preparation is open for us to see and talk with the chefs. They were all amazing, so kind and helpful in explaining the dishes they were preparing. Thank you amazing staff for such an amazing night!\n\nThe other dishes at the dinner table were just as fantastic. One of my favorite dishes was salmon with roe. The salmon literally melted in my mouth and the roe was cured perfectly. Their bread and cured butter was also amazing! Near the end there was lamb, which was so delicious. But I was so full and wasn't able to eat it all..seriously for fine dining they really provide a lot of food for you to feel full. Oh and the desserts..yumm! One of my favorite dishes was a cherry with cacao chocolate and I think a dried seaweed...somehow the flavors really worked together.\n\nIt was such an amazing experience and I would highly recommend Lazy Bear for anyone who wants to try a fine dining experience.

I dined here with a group of 4 on a Wednesday night.\n\nTHE EXPERIENCE:\nWhen we first arrived we were kindly escorted upstairs to the mezzanine level overlooking the dining room to get checked in. We were promptly shown to a standing table where we would enjoy some small bites, and a complimentary cocktail (which was delish by the way) before our dinner service. We hung here for about an hour, I think...until we were escorted downstairs to the main dining tables. 2 long tables, 42 seats in the room. A community dining experience. SO FUN! As we were shaking hands and meeting our dining neighbors, we were quieted by the executive chef to explain the expectations for the reminder of the evening. We would have courses brought out and someone from the kitchen would interrupt to tell us about the dish! We were encouraged to begin eating while they spoke so that we could enjoy the \"hot foods hot, and cold foods cold, as intended.\" We were also encouraged to chat with our neighbors throughout the evening, as well as to come right up and chat with the chefs at their prep stations in the kitchen! \"Ask questions, come say hi, Each course was beautiful, delicious, unique, and truly a work of art. \n\nTHE SERVICE: \nWe received exceptional service on all fronts. From the GM, Greg, saying hello while we had our snacks, to the various members of the kitchen staff bringing out each dish, our experience was impeccable. Our glasses were never empty, and by the end, our stomachs very full.\n\nTHE FOOD:\nThe 5 small bites, or \"snacks\" as they called them, were each intricately crafted, beautifully presented, and so unique! The first was a whipped scrambled egg, served right inside the egg shell, with a touch of bacon, maple, and hot sauce. The next was an oyster that had a tomato foam on top...very nice. Next was a liver pate served atop a bite of heavenly cornbread. Next, some type of cracker topped with goat cheese and mint ! And, finally, a few bites of what I can best describe as Nashville-hot-chicken-style chicken nuggets served with some house-trained ranch and pickles! Soooo good! \n\nThe dinner service included some fresh rolls and butter, along with 7 courses. The butter they serve is actually house-made and has been filtered to perfection over the last few years. It was very salty, a little sweet, and gave a nice fatty zip to each bite of the dinner roll. \n\nEach entree was amazing and beautiful in it's own way. Here are my favorites in descending order:\n1) Coal roasted beef ribeye with wild peppercorn, smoked potatoes, creamed spinach, and roasted mushroom.\n2) King coast salmon with fennel, peach, dried scallop, and fish eggs! \n3) salmon belly w/ BBQ sauce \n4) grilled summer squash soup with huge chunks of fresh lobster, with saffron, lemon, and basil, all topped with a bit of foam (made from the lobster she'll I think??)\n5) Crispy dry-aged squab (poultry) served with beets, onions, and figs.\n6) Cucumber, tomato, and anchovy with a green sauce, something with doll I think? Omg this was sooooo good! A cucumber salad like no other! And that sauce/puree? I can't remember what it was but man... delicious!\n7) Shelling beans, country ham broth, cranberry miso, and shishito peppers. This was definitely my least favorite thing of the whole experience, but that's just because I'm not a huge fan of the texture of pinto/black beans, which is similar to the texture of these.\n\nDESSERT: \nThere were three waves of sweets to end our evening. \nThe first was a peach dessert...it was kind of like 2 tbsps of the best peach cobbler you've ever had inside of a white chocolate shell, and it was served on top of a graham cracker crust. \nNext was a Raspberry cake with fresh raspberry, raspberry gelato, dark chocolate, and spicy mole sauce. I preferred the peach one but this was still super good! \n\nFinally we were brought a plate with 4 different \"treats\", little bite-sized finishers. My favorites:\n1) White chocolate and cream cheese macaron\n2) Fig and maple donut bite? I can't remember what they called it...it was a much fancier name \n3) Earth bonbon, chocolatey and delicious!\n4) blackberry gummy bear (this was my least favorite, but still a tasty bite).\n\nOVERALL:\nObviously this place isn't cheap..tickets are $250 per person which includes one complimentary cocktail during the snack hour, all of your food, and gratuity. You pay for everything at the time of reservation, except for wine/cocktails/coffee/etc - you will have a separate bill at the end of your meal for any of those items you choose to order, so just be prepared for that. All in all, it truly was an amazing experience and we will definitely be returning.", "author": "Taylor D."}

I finally got the chance this year when my birthday rolled around. My friend and I got tickets for the 6pm seating. They ask that you arrive around 5:30pm so that you can get comfortable and settled in, so we did. The place itself is super inconspicuous and if you're looking for a clear sign with \"Lazy Bear\" written all over, you won't find it. The thing that tipped us off that we had arrived was a very well dressed lady standing in the middle of the sidewalk next to a set of wooden doors. We walked up to her and she asked if we had reservations, to which we said yes, and we were promptly welcomed in. The place itself was beautiful. There were 2 giant tables that seated around 15 people each in the main dining area. But, for appetizers, we were first led upstairs. \n\nThe upstairs area was a lot smaller, but they clearly knew what they were doing because they managed to fit 30 people in the smallest space imaginable. We were led to a small corner table where we were offered a drink menu to look over. Slowly, waiters started bringing us appetizers and drinks. As we were sitting there, more and more people started flooding in as it came closer to 6pm. I would definitely recommend coming half an hour before your reservation time because we noticed that the people that came late had to scarf down their appetizers as they came in by the boatload to ensure time was kept. Whereas, we were served appetizers one at a time every 5-10 minutes or so, each of which was followed by a long description of what was in it. \n\nAfter the appetizers were served, we were all escorted downstairs to the giant communal tables. These tables led to an open view of the prep table where the chefs were all lined up prepping the courses. Before each course was served, we were graced with a long detailed explanation of what ingredients went into the dish and how they were obtained, which, as a foodie, I found really interesting. Guests were encouraged to talk to other people at their tables and make new friends. I personally didn't enjoy this as much. I just wanted to be able to enjoy my meal with my friend and discuss the dishes among ourselves, but maybe that's just me. Everyone was given the option to go up and talk to the chefs/watch as the chefs prepared each of the dishes which I thought was really cool and unique. \n\nAs for the food, my favorite appetizers were the spicy egg foam, the eggplant crostini, and the cornbread with liver mousse. Each one was packed with flavors that worked well together and really left a lasting impression. The entrees that stood out to me were the cold cucumber and anchovy dish (I hate anchovies and I didn't finish the ones on the plate, but even after that, I still think all the other elements on the dish were amazing enough to make it one of my favorites of the night), the lobster and squash dish, the bean soup, and the squab (my favorite of the night). \n\nI waited a couple weeks before writing this review just to mull over the whole experience and the reason for the 3 star rating? Considering the meal cost an upwards of $200 per person, I expected better. I could only say I really enjoyed 1/2 the dishes we were served. The other half were either just mediocre, or I just straight up didn't like the flavor combinations. My favorites by far were the appetizers, but their desserts were super disappointing. I understand wanting to play with different flavors and textures, but some things just didn't go together. Service was impeccable, but it didn't make up for the good number of sub par dishes we were served. All in all, I left this place full, but not satisfied.\n\nCons: \n- Hard to find parking as it's located in the Mission\n- Reservations are difficult to get as they open up ticket sales a month before and they sell out like hotcakes\n- Almost a forced interaction between patrons dining at the same time (which, you can see as either a pro or a con depending on what you like, but I personally didn't enjoy it ... so con for me)\n- Will cost you a pretty penny to dine here, so save up if you so desire\n\nPro:\n- Coming here is really about the experience. It's awesome to be able to watch the chefs prep your dish and listen to them describe what goes in it. They are all such passionate individuals and that really shows when they present their dish. \n- Certain dishes were mindblowingly good. Especially enjoyed most the appetizers and the squab!\n- Interior was beautiful and well thought out", "author": "Diana C."}

You prepay for your non-refundable (but transferable) \"ticket.\" A mandatory 20% service charge comes on top of this, and we haven't even started factoring in any booze yet. You can add a pairing menu to go with your courses, go a la carte, or bring drinks down from the loft. \n\nIndeed, upon arriving for your reservation, you'll be escorted to the loft where you can order drinks and where you'll enjoy the first 2-3 bite-sized courses of your experience. Think oysters, canapes, and other hors d'oeuvres taken to quite the fancy level. It's a cozy, intimate area where you sit with other diners at couches and armchairs, stand at a makeshift counter overlooking the dining room, or sit at small tables for two. The intent is to force people to sit closely together and be more social, but in practice few people actually mingle outside of their own parties.\n\nEven though this continues when everyone is led down to the dining room, which consists of two long, communal tables, it's all about the food anyway. Your courses will get progressively larger, starting with tiny but exceptionally pretty dishes like beets, salmon, or abalone which will punch far above their diminutive weight in terms of flavor, especially as far as savory and umami notes are concerned. Our final dish, the rack of lamb, was absolutely delicious and the \"seal the deal\" moment in what had otherwise been a slightly disappointing meal as far as portion sizes were concerned.\n\nService manages to be both formal in structure (for example, the staff's attire or the professional, methodical manner in which they work the room and place and collect dishes and silverware at each diner's place setting) but also casual and approachable in style. You can roam the kitchen, converse with the chefs, and take as many pictures as you want. In addition to the servers and the chefs explaining each course like an MC at a banquet or a performance, each diner also receives a custom-printed notebook (complete with pencil) which describes and illustrates each course and offers room for notes.\n\nOverall, a most appropriate venue for my 4000th venue and an absolutely exquisite - yet very approachable and unpretentious as you'd expect of the Bay Area - fine-dining experience.", "author": "Vincent L."}

Lazy Bear is expensive, but the experience was worth every penny!\n\nImmediately coming into the restaurant, you already know you're going to have a great dinner. The design of Lazy Bear is one of my favorite places to eat at! They have an open kitchen so diners can walk up and talk with chefs about the food they're cooking. How cool is that?!\n\nThe food was amazing, not sure how to describe it, but every time a new dish was introduced, a chef would come up and explain it.

The meal was excellent from beginning to end. It was a communal dining experience.  I got a ticket for the 6pm service. They encourage you to get there around 5:30 to get settled and relax. By 6pm, the first few bites start and they start getting drink orders.  Since I was driving, I opted for the zero-proof pairing.  It had several interesting drinks - tea, cola, soda and cold brew.  Interesting pairing but could be still improved.  \n\nDinner highlights - Salmon with peas (my favorite of  the night), Oysters with citrus, lamb tartare and the lamb main dish.  Was everything amazing - in general yes. A few things here and there could have been better/more imaginative (eg the duo of asparagus - the prep and taste profile for the white asparagus was much better than the green one making the comparison stark). Still good and will likely go back when I go to San Francisco\n\nService was excellent. Relaxed yet still attentive.  The chefs were approachable and some were funny when explaining the dish.", "author": "Victor J."}

Got the 6:00 seating but if you show up around 5:30 they'll let you sit up upstairs and start serving you.  Is it worth the 230 bucks WITHOUT alcohol? I don't know, that depends if you a rich mf or not.  If you're rich, why the hell not and you should DEFINTELY come here.  For our downstairs dinner plates, the flavors ranged from things I've never tasted before, to nostalgic favorites to basic stuff where you're like WTF 230 FOR THIS?!  Anyways overall it's a really fun food culinary experience if you're into this stuff.  Chefs get up before they serve a plate and talk about them like you're on a netflix show and everyone looks like they could be on chopped or iron chef.  \n\nCan't give this place a 5 star yet since this is the only fancy ass set dinner culinary experience I've ever had BUT, that just means it COULD be a 5 star.", "author": "Vince L."}

Both were for the holiday party of my boyfriend's company, so we've always gone around December time for 2016 and 2017. \n\nThe premise of Lazy Bear is to create a unique tasting menu dining experience with fresh, local foods. I won't go into too much detail on specific dishes since they always change by season. They always have their fresh rye bread and 5-year cultured butter available as a starter and it's a heavenly dish that just melts in your mouth. Gluten free, vegetarian, vegan options are available -- you just need to tell them ahead of time when you fill out your reservation survey. Winter menus tend to have some seafood, mushrooms, and root veggies as components of the dishes. 2016 had a bit more variety in meat (duck, seafood, wagyu beef) whereas 2017 focused more on lighter seafood meats (oysters, scallops) and roasted sqaw was the heaviest meat. I was happy and satisfied with both years' foods!\n\nI'll go into more detail to highlight the service and ambiance so you know what to expect since this is not a traditional restaurant dining experience. Logistically, we did a big group reservation and bought out the entire dining time block for our group so we did not dine with strangers. However, you are totally able to reserve tickets for smaller groups and you will just sit next to other people in a big communal dining table. Try to check about 2 weeks before the following month to get tickets ahead of time (i.e. check Jan. 15 for February dates).\n\nIn 2016 we did the later dining time that started around 8:30PM. They start with a small cocktail and appetizer gathering in the upper level. It was fun to watch the earlier dinner party eat downstairs and guess what food we'd get served later. With 15+ courses, we didn't end until after 11PM. Keep that in mind if you don't want to be out too late! I had to skip last dessert course to catch last BART home.\n\nFor 2017, we opted for the earlier dining time that started at 6PM. Highway 101 traffic made us a bit late coming up from the South Bay but the staff was still accommodating in making sure we didn't feel rushed during the cocktail portion of our evening. They only omitted one appetizer so we could get our dinner started on time. \n\nThe service and presentation at Lazy Bear is what makes it truly unique! I loved hearing from each chef as they did a short presentation of their dish to explain where the food came from and what inspired them. Patrons were encouraged to come to the front to watch the workers plate our food and they were happy to chat as they worked. \n\nI highly recommend Lazy Bear for both group outings or a special occasion with someone. I look forward to returning!", "author": "Bonnie Z."}

It wasn't just the quality and presentation of the food, but also the ambiance, friendly and informative staff, attention to every detail and overall experience.\n\nI'll be honest.  When I first heard of this place I thought it was a bit too precious (I'm being honest!).  I saw the reviews from people who all wanted to sit at the end of a table so they would not have to engaged in small talk with strangers.  This was what I call a \"tweezer\" meal and aside from AQ and Nico, I have not been overly impressed or satisfied from those experiences.\n\nI am so happy to admit was was WRONG and worried for nothing!!\n\nThe meal started off with an escorted walk to the upstairs lounge area where five appetizers and a signature cocktail was served.  The seats are pre-assigned per the size of your party.  When food/beverages are delivered they explain the components of each dish.  It's a feast for the eyes, nose and mouth with creative presentations.\n\nWhen it was time for the main meal to begin, a host came by and escorted each party to their seats, which are also pre-assigned at the two communal tables.  My friend and I ended up with seats at the end of the table, closest to the open kitchen.  Several chefs each took turns to speak before each course and inform us of the dish, its ingredients and their origin.  We were also invited to come up to the kitchen and observe the kitchen staff at work.  The wait staff also spent some time with us to speak about the food, wine and restaurant.\n\nI came to this experience with an open mind and just enjoy myself.  Of course one of the dishes served was something I prefer not to eat but they assured us that the lamb was not gamey at all.  It was prepared a bit more rare than I prefer.  I have to say, it was delicious!   All the dishes were unique in terms of taste, texture, presentation and composition.  They used seasonal ingredients that were very fresh.\n\nEveryone eats the same dishes, unless they have made arrangements with the restaurant ahead of time for allergies and dietary restrictions.  Wine pairings are optional.  A booklet is provided to allow for note taking on each dish.  \n\nThere are two seatings, one at 6 pm and one at 8:30 pm.  Your meal is pre-paid, as they want you to end your experience on a high note without having to deal with the bill.  You are encouraged to come earlier than your reservation time to observe the preparations and relax.  For my visit on a Thursday evening, I was able to find parking nearby without any issue but those traveling my Uber/cab were all delayed due to rush hour traffic.\n\nI have never been to a restaurant like this before and thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience.  The staff have worked really hard to make everyone feel welcome, relaxed and comfortable.  I was impressed and satisfied.", "author": "Melissa L."}

I didn't feel like there was a signature dish which stood out to me as something memorable or exciting... and for the price, I would certainly expect one of those. Having recently visited 3rd Cousin in Bernal Heights for a tasting menu, I must say that I was more satiated, surprised, and delighted by their menu, which is a fraction of the cost of Lazy Bear.

Everyone is extremely kind and polite, and they really know absolutely everything about the food and drinks that they are serving. They will also accommodate every dietary restriction that you have, just be sure to fill up the questionary once you buy the tickets.\nFirst, 3 dishes and pallet cleanser are served upstairs, together with the welcoming drink.\nSoft shell crab- what an amazing dish!! Fantastic looking, and done to perfection! I only wish that you served that dish downstairs! \nEvery dish is extremely unique, presented and executed well! \nWe were really lucky, got seated next to the couple that my husband knew, and the couple on the other side, were in the same kind of business, so it almost felt like we went out with the friends.\nThis is definitely not the romantic place. So if you are planning to have that special evening with your loved one, it's not going to happen.\nYes, you can simply ignore the others and just talk to each other, but the music... That was another big surprise at this place. It was a pretty loud and believe it or not, it was heavy...I am talking about playing AC/DC, Slayer...\nAlso be sure to arrive before 6, if you don't, the upstairs seats will fill up and you will have to drink eat your first few dishes standing.\nEvery single dish that was served downstairs is perfect. Made perfect, looked perfect, tasted incredible.\n15 courses maybe sound too much, but the way it was served, upstairs and then with little break, when everyone is seated downstairs, chef talking and introducing himself and what will happen next, it was the perfect amount of food.\nWe had the wine pairing for additional $145 and it was well worth it.\nAs I said at the beginning, fantastic and very unique experience. Food is out of this world, place looks fantastic and service is exactly how it is supposed to be, at Michelin star restaurant. \nAnother brilliant touch was the card that we got. It was our anniversary, and the card was signed by all of the people that are working in the restaurant!\nSo yes, if you are a foodie, this restaurant has to be on your list of restaurants to visit!", "author": "Bianca G."}

I don't know what i was expecting but this was definitely what everyone keeps on calling a 'dining experience' haha. \n\nMy boyfriend took me here for my bday (yay happy bday to meee~) and we were greeted warmly at the door after parking 2 blocks away at the structure that was suggested when you reserve the seats. Went upstairs where we sat for a bit, was served punched while waiting, and then were brought appetizers. We had the whipped scrambled eggs first and oh man did that set the standards high. I was already starving but that sparked my hunger even more. It was delightfully light and bacon-y and the chives paired reallly well with it. I also liked the preserves board with the chicken liver tart and the gourmet tater tots LOL. \n\nNot particularly a big fan of oysters but for the price you pay- i will eat every single bite. So after we forced that down i washed my palette with the (tempura) mushrooms aha. Then party by party you are brought to the main dining area and that's when the fun begins. The chefs describe each course before serving it and its prepared right in front of your eyes! This was legit Food Network in real life. \n\n2 of my favorite dishes of the night were the bay scallop served raw and with apples in a light frothy broth and then the dungeness crab with persimmons. Everything else was very well balanced and i liked the people sitting next to us haha. You definitely get to know them and have time between courses to talk to them. I also had the grandmas to blame to drink and it was a gin, honey, and lavender drink.

I wish they had a better way of disposing of the snacks. Many people were holding on to empty containers or piled them on the few surfaces available.\n-Whipped scrambled eggs: more of a foam and nicely enhanced by an interesting pairing of maple and hot sauce\n-Trout roe: not my favorite, the roe was rather overpowering, and the cabbage had a weird consistency\n-Chicken liver tart: beautifully presented and nicely accentuated with pear\n-Cape gooseberry soda: like a delicious bougie kombucha\n\nYou are then ushered downstairs and assigned seating at one of two long communal tables.

It was a refreshing experience chatting with people seating next to us who all came for the same thing we did - amazing food and drinks.

The price tag is steep, but I would definitely recommend it and personally would dine here again and again - some things are just worth it! The food is amazing and I will get there in just a minute, but I have to say - thank you to the staff who all acknowledged and congratulated us on our engagement, for the card they all signed which was really the sweetest touch, and for giving us literally the best seats in the house (front nearest the kitchen, and unbeknownst to us, next to the owners of Elizabeth in Chicago - who were the loveliest people and made our experience even greater!). No amount of words could really do this place justice and I'm not sure any other establishment could ever top this one! \n\nThe restaurant is set up for communal dining which is just a fantastic way to meet people and this concept works so well in SF one of the most friendly and progressive cities in the country! Additionally, there is a set menu, which alleviates the need to think/decide what you might want. Everyone enjoys the same food (like a family!) and of course they can accommodate for any food restrictions. We loved all the small bites upstairs before our seating (and the welcome cocktail was seriously addictive, we may have asked for a second..!), and all the dishes after were impeccable. \n\nUpstairs, the grilled foie gras (with blood orange marmalade), and the crab toast were divine and the whipped scrambled eggs was so interesting and delicious! They had this fried mushroom which was really good too (and is actually served at their new bar/restaurant True Laurel). Downstairs, the clam dish had me reeling, and who doesn't enjoy some cultured butter?! The halibut was lovely and the rack of lamb to end it was great too! I was already full by the time dessert came around (altogether they serve about 12-14 dishes). If it's your first time I would recommend a wine pairing! My fiance and I shared one and it was a good amount for us both! You can browse and get up to look at the kitchen, talk to your neighbors, staff etc. that is all encouraged!  \n\nThe idea and planning behind Lazy Bear really makes a visit here not just a place for dinner, but a full experience for all members involved. One lady we met said it was her 3rd time here and she should return again (me too!). Every experience is different, menu items change, and they are constantly improving!

The website simply describes it as \"A modern American dinner party\" and it really delivers on that concept. \n\nThe evening starts in an upstairs lounge area where guests are served with punch, champagne as aperitif and the first five courses of the meal as snacks.  The snacks included:\n\n(1). Whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple and hot sauce (5/5) - very unique and excellent way to start the evening. \n(2).  Shigoku Oyster with preserved winter citrus (4/5) - it's fairly standard fare in SF at the moment. \n(3). Brown rice cracker with peas, carrots, herbs and flowers (5/5) - this was excellent as the fresh ingredients really went well with the crispness of the brown rice cracker\n(4). Grilled Foie Gras with strawberry and fermented jam (4/5) - the bite was good. Wish I had a bigger piece \n(5).  Crab toast with cauliflower, lardo and sourdough (5/5) - more please!!!\n\nThe hosts then take diners to seat at one of two huge communal tables downstairs for the rest of the evening.  The chefs introduce each course in the main dining area and courses served downstairs included:\n\n(1). Spelt and Rye Dinner Roll with house cultured butter (5/5) - the bread was fabulous and the butter was even better.  To me, the bread has become a real important part of the fine dining experience and this is probably the second best bread I've had in SF (the brioche at Atelier Crenn is the first).\n(2).  Geoduck clam with sorrels, watermelon radish and oro blanco (3/5) - decent geoduck dish but I was just at Coi and their geoduck dish was better.\n(3).  White asparagus with Tsar Nicoulai caviar (4/5) - this dish is good but I've had something similar at Quince not so long ago and that was better.\n(4).  Ham and barley broth with fudgy egg yolk, pink lady apple and charred onion (5/5) - this was the perfect intermezzo and special mention to the consistency and creaminess of the egg yolk. \n(5).  Local halibut with artichoke, stinging nettle, ramps and hollandaise (5/5) - Perfection. No other words to describe it. \n(6).  Grilled rack of lamb with broccolini and kumquat (5/5) - this is, by far, the best piece of lamb I've had and I particularly enjoyed the fat. Surprisingly, the veggies were competing well with the lamb in this dish.  \n(7).  Rhubarb compote with coconut cream and sorrel granita (3/5) - I've had a better version of what this is trying to do at Campton Place (using kiwi instead of rhubarb). \n(8).  Honey with banana and walnut (1/5) - this was not good at all. The banana really overpowered this. A nice chocolate mille-feuille or ice cream/sorbet would have been perfect in this spot. \n(9).  Forager's Tisane Tea (5/5) - really happy with this at the end of the savory courses and while eating the desserts. \n(10).  Mignardises include calamansi lime/Fresno Chile gummi bear, dark chocolate brownie, prickly pear macaron and almond/chocolate/pink peppercorn nugget (5/5) - these are the most unique and tasty small bites I've had in SF and kudos for the creativity. \n\nIn terms of what was missing, I wish they somehow incorporated black truffle in the meal.  Service throughout the evening was fantastic - attentive but not fussy. The venue and ambiance is really great as well - it's a lodge/lounge combo.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-25", "description": "As magical as it was back in 2011 when they were still a pop up restaurant.\n\nI have a very fond spot for Lazy Bear: I first found them in 2011 when they were still functioning as a pop up in various venues. When I heard they'd opened a storefront, I cheered on the inside. Then came the first Michelin star. Then the second. Now, 7 years later, I was practically salivating in anticipation of finally visiting them again, but I wasn't sure what to expect. Had they lost the magic and enthusiasm of back when they were a pop up working out of random warehouses?\n\nThe answer is emphatically no. I have had the privilege of dining at several Michelin star restaurants in California (Meadowood, Manresa, The French Laundry, Sushi Yoshizumi...), and they are mostly excellent, fine dining experiences. Lazy Bear is that and more. When my friend and I arrived, we were enthusiastically greeted by the bartender, who escorted us upstairs to their waiting area. We were shown to a cozy nook over the balcony, giving us a birds eye view of the dining that was still going on below. Our server was pleasant and helpful with picking out cocktails, and suggested amazing, unique cocktails unlike anything I've ever had before. This was followed by \"fruit punch,\" which was supposed to be alcoholic but didn't taste like it at all (so dangerous!), and a whole slew of \"snack,\" including whipped scrambled eggs, geoduck clam, crispy big head, crab toast, and crispy hen of the woods. After this very pleasant opener, we were then escorted downstairs where we were served spelt and rye dinner roll (complete with their own housemade butter, with their own culture they are clearly very proud of), Mt. Lassen trout and roe, sunflower (which was sunchoke, sourdough, and caviar), ham & barley broth, San Francisco coast halibut, and aged duck. After that came the dessert course: Meyer lemon (with buttermilk and pine), candy cap (maple and cranberry), and a platter of delightful treats (gummy bear, macaron, banana bread, and peanut butter pebble). We also paired this with their reserve wine pairing. I have only had one other wine pairing (at Manresa), but Lazy Bear's was even better than Manresa's. Each wine was smooth and perfectly matched the course; highlights were their champagne and assyrtiko.\n\nEach course was so well done and delicious, but the standout for me is the whole Lazy Bear experience. The tables are giant communal tables to encourage the \"dinner party\" feel, which is just how their pop up functioned. The kitchen is right there for you to watch all the chefs hard at work, and David Barzelay (rearrange the letters of his last name to get \"Lazy Bear\") himself will announce some of the courses as well as help serve guests. Everyone is friendly and enthusiastic about their work, and guests are encouraged to walk up to the kitchen to observe them at work. They also thoughtfully provided swivel chairs, so you can pivot to hear them announce the courses, as well as chat with your neighbors. And since I was there celebrating my birthday, I was also presented with a birthday card, signed by all the staff.\n\nIn summary, I absolutely loved the entire experience, and I really appreciated how, despite their increased profile (PBS was there filming a special), they have maintained their friendly, approachable, but still extremely fine dining experience. I will be happy to continue supporting Lazy Bear, and here's to hoping for a third well deserved star!", "author": "Christine Y."}

When you first arrive, you usually hang out in the upstairs bar where you can see the chefs prepare the food and have a drink and some appetizers while chatting with the other guests. After, you get seated in long tables like a school cafeteria but much classier and it gives you a chance to socialize with your neighbors if you choose to.\n\nThe bread. Oh my god, the bread. By far the most delicious bread and butter I've ever had in my life - and they offer an unlimited supply. It was mindblowing. I'd honestly consider coming back just for the bread.\n\nThe rest of the meal was amazingly delicious as well. My personal favorite was the duck! The one tiny mistep I think was the desserts.

Upon being escorted upstairs, you're seated (or in our case, placed at a standing table) while awkwardly starring at the people directly next to/across from you. This is immediately when I knew I was in for a rough night of thoughtless conversation. It's a forced meeting that feels like you're a kid in school and aren't allowed to choose your own friends. Here, meet these people. Now be friends.\n\nAfter you say your hellos and create some sort of small talk you are served a drink and small bites. All of which again, feel more about spurring up conversation than the actual taste of the food itself. \"How did you like this bite?\", \"Which was your favorite?\", \"Have you been here before?\" Blah blah blah. I was happy to be escorted back downstairs as the rest of the meal was about to begin.\n\nI spoke too soon. Shortly after we sat down, it was an immediate \"Hello, where ya'll from?\" On my right and \"What did you think of the meal so far?\" From my left. I shrugged it off and remained as polite as possible all while sending the signal that this wasn't my first rodeo. The message wasn't received and as the night continued we were fed beautiful dishes that screamed of show and flare rather than educating our palettes and challenging tastebuds. Every discussion going on around us was about the presentation and flavor and next course. Can we stop analyzing the food for a second and get deep? I mean, it felt like we were being tested on our conversational skills and not enjoying our evening.\n\nThe food was good, almost delicious but unspectacular and more about the show than anything else. The wine pairing helped wash down my thoughts of the evening and people seated around us but the pours were a bit smaller with several missteps throughout - no explanation of a few pours while I believe some might have even been skipped.\n\nWould I give Lazy Bear a second chance?

Now I feel like I have to drop to 4 stars all 5 star restaurant reviews I've written previoulsy on Yelp because there's nothing higher to give Lazy Bear. I've been fortunate enough to eat at other 2, even 3, Michelin star restaurants and now I know why Lazy Bear is on the list amongst them. Plus it was the least \"fussy\" of all of them. I would love to relive and give you the details of every single thing I ate, but, in the interest of TL;DR, I'll say I believe you will love whatever you eat as long as you love delicious food. I.e., Lazy Bear is a place where, if you try something you think you don't like, you discover you like it, when it's sourced and prepared by the chefs there.\n\nAt this dinner party, you make friends with your neighbors at community tables. Part of the fun is hearing from the chefs about the love that went into the ingredients before they even got to the kitchen, and what happened after their arrival, which results in the amazing experience you now get to have when each course is served. If you do the wine pairing, you learn a little about each wine too. DO THE WINE PAIRING if you like wine. I did the reserve pairing. It wasn't cheap but I loved each of those wines and they elevated the already mind-blowing food to whatever the next level is (I think it may be if you die immediately after you don't mind because you are ecstatic). \n\nThe service manages to be both completely out of your way and exquisitely attentive at the same time. It's one of those things where you all of a sudden realize your silverware has been swapped out, your water glass has been filled, and your neighbor's napkin folded when he went to the bathroom, but you never saw anyone do it. I even had an amazing, but not surprising based on their awesomeness, experience with asking a server if she could help me find someone to get my jacket out of coat check because I was chilly. She nodded, disappeared, and within minutes brought my jacket to me. I hadn't given her a description of it, a claim ticket, nor seen her earlier in the night; yet there it was.

It's also fun and spruces up the meal when we first sit in the balcony for cocktails hour and then downstairs for the main courses/dessert.\n\nThe dishes change depending on what's in season and what ingredients they have. Apparently we were super lucky and had only a 1 time shipment of trout roe so we had a cool appetizer dish with that. The food is AMAZING and there wasn't a dish I didn't like... Everyone, including myself, was smiling after every bite! There was so much energy in the air and it's not like any snooty 2-star michelin starred restaurant. I love it.\n\nAnd you know when a restaurant is good when you eat an entire dish made out of ingredients you don't like. I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but I ate that whole thing. They added a bunch of refreshing herbs and butternut squash puree that totally countered the gamey-ness. \n\nI was a little disappointed in the desserts though since they tasted super tart to me. The desserts featured a lot of berries/cherries so those were dishes that I didn't fully finish. however, I did love the small treats like the gummy bears, mini cinnabons, and red velvet cake pop.\n\nService was excellent and so fun and interactive!

I loved the punch bowl cocktail and the snacks that were served during our time in the lounge.  The oyster with gelee and whipped eggs were my faves and made me even more excited about what was to come.\n\nOne by one, our parties were escorted downstairs to the main dining room and seated at the two long tables.  Chef David makes a LOUD announcement about how dinner will be presented and encourages everyone to continue the socializing by meeting tablemates and coming up to the prep stations to talk with the chefs.  From the bread rolls and amazing butter to the peas, to the lamb and pork, each and every dish had a special touch and appeal.  My favorites during the seated dinner were the peas with duck ham and XO sauce, and the artichoke with halibut and cara cara oranges.

Probably not the most fun for introverted couples.\n\nIf I were to visit Lazy Bear again, this is what I'd do differently:\n- Go on a weekend to eliminate worries about drinking too much or staying out too late\n- Go with friends so the experience will naturally be more social\n- Drink more ;)\n\nMy boyfriend and I visited Lazy Bear for the 8:30 pm seating on our anniversary.

The space is flawlessly decorated to be young and playful, yet cozy and sophisticated. However, the 'interactive dinner party' aspect fell flat for me. It definitely did feel like a dinner party, but it felt awkward chatting with others, especially as most guests stuck close to their own groups. We didn't meet anyone until after the 8th course when the woman next to us was a little sauced (granted, we also didn't make an effort to introduce ourselves).\n\nFOOD -  5\nInventive and unique. The chefs are surprisingly young but dedicated to their craft, both in the detailed execution and their bold experimentation. A chef introduces each course as the plates are served, all of which are plated beautifully like a work of art. The food itself definitely pushed my comfort zone; in a single evening, I ate caviar, trout roe, and baby pigeon. All of the savory dishes leaned on the salty side. The entire experience lasted 4 hours and we left completely stuffed.\n\n* Cocktails: Pricey, but excellent. Perfectly balanced. I tried the Peaches and Cream, and it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had.\n\n* Snacks: All served during the mezzanine cocktail hour. Loved the scrambled eggs and mushrooms.\n   - Whipped Scrambled Eggs with maple syrup and housemade hot sauce\n   - Trout Tartare with grilled squash, yolk jam, and preserves\n   - Marin Miyagi Oyster with grape and elderflower\n   - Tempura mushrooms with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche dip\n\n* Main Courses:\n   - Dinner rolls - Housemade butter from a 2+ year culture. Fresh, warm, and complementary second helpings.\n   - Channel Islands Halibut with chicory, pomegranate, and pine nuts - Good. Creative blend of flavors, creamy finish.\n   - Sourdough Dumplings with caviar and seaweed - Excellent. Personally, not a fan of the caviar.\n   - Abalone with little gem, onion, sprouts, and grains - Unfortunately, this was not a hit with us. My boyfriend described it as having \"the look and taste of vomit\". I didn't feel quite so strongly, but it definitely leaned on the acidic side.\n   - Trout with cabbage, buttermilk, and dill - Perfectly paired with the buttermilk cabbage. Beautiful texture and balance. One of the standout dishes of the night.\n   - Corn with pork jowl, kale, and egg yolk fudge - One of my favorites. This was a soup, similar to ramen (but no noodles). Again, a beautiful blend of textures and flavors.\n   - Dry-aged Squab with smoky beets, huckleberry, and pink peppercorn - Also known as baby pigeon. My negative feelings about pigeons made it hard to enjoy this dish, but hey, you only live once.\n\n* Desserts:\n   - Apple with ice cream, hibiscus, and brown sugar - Delicious and refreshing. Not too sweet.\n   - Squash, chocolate, maple, coffee - Excellent, very autumnal. My favorite of the two \"main\" desserts.\n   - Bergamot gummy bears - Very intense flavor, interesting accent with the olive oil.\n   - Lavender Macarons with plum jam - Delicious. Perfect balance of texture and flavor. My favorite of the desserts overall.\n   - Peanut butter pebbles - Just ok.\n\n\nSERVICE - 5\nExcellent service. Every staff member was courteous and helpful. They surprised us with a beautiful card signed by the entire staff for our anniversary. They encourage you to go up to the kitchen and talk to the chefs, but honestly, it felt awkward because it seemed like we were in the way and just being distracting. It's still interesting to watch the chefs from a distance as they hover over the dishes, carefully placing flower petals and other delicate elements with care.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-16", "description": "Yes, yes, yes! There are so many high-end restaurants in the Bay Area and let the record show that Lazy Bear is hands down my favorite. The food is imaginative, fun, and whimsical. What's even more wonderful than the food is the format and ambiance.\n\nLazy Bear is the only \"fancy\" restaurant that I've been to twice and I was blown away both times. The first was two years ago, shortly after they secured this location and before any stars were given. Fast-forward two years, two Michelin stars, and a more expensive menu later, I am still madly in love.\n\nLazy Bear shows that high-end dining can feel like a dinner party. It is very different from the formal (and sometimes stuffy), upscale white-tablecloth service you get at The French Laundry or Quince. There's a place and time for that traditional setting but Lazy Bear's informal mezzanine snack reception, communal table seating that encourages diners to meet each other, open kitchen with friendly cooks who want to share their craft, a \"field guide\" menu that allows you to take notes as you go on your journey, and the incredible creative use of local ingredients puts the experience in a league of its own.\n\nI'm going to refrain from going through a full review of the menu since the dishes change often. I will say that the whipped scrambled eggs is one of their signatures and it's light, fluffy, and yummy. Another standout in the snacks category was the fried maitake mushrooms. I'm not sure what they did here but I would've gladly eaten an entree portion of this dish. The abalone I had this time was the best abalone I've ever tasted. Chinese people love abalone at banquets but they are often big, chewy, and unappetizing. This was not the case at all at Lazy Bear. It was tender, flavorful, and paired with the crunchy texture of greens. Another one of my favorites was the creamsical dessert. It was covered in white chocolate and everyone around me absolutely loved it.\n\nThere are two seatings a night and I would highly recommend the 6pm seating since the meal takes about 3 hours to complete. I can't imagine eating until 11:30pm if you choose the later time. Also, the snacked are served first and the sit-down portion of the meal doesn't start until ~6:45pm so it's not too early. The prices now vary depending on the day of week. I didn't mind going on a Tuesday, which is the most budget-friendly choice.\n\nI've never done the wine pairing and I do think it's a bit pricey relative to the cost of the food. Everyone is provided punch upstairs and you can order glasses of wine or cocktails throughout the meal.\n\nIt was such a fun girls' date and we got to catch up over dinner and make new friends with our neighbors. For a uniquely San Francisco dining experience, nothing can be better than Lazy Bear.", "author": "Yi Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-10", "description": "My first 2 Michelin star experience... and it was perfect!\n\nLazy Bear somehow meshed the homey, comfortable, warm and casual feel into a 2 Michelin star dining experience. I didn't have to concern myself with attire, etiquette or whether or not to use the inside fork or the left or right knife! Just show up, enjoy the food, drinks and company of chefs, staff and guests alike!\n\nMy favorite part was hanging out in the lounge overlooking the dining area/kitchen. The excitement and anticipation quickly grew as the staff brought out each dish, explained them with passion and eloquence. The punch that came out was also fantastic. Make sure to spend this time meeting and greeting other dinner guests because this will be just a preview of the rest of the night!\n\nBeing seated next to the kitchen and seeing the dedication and passion from each chef as they prepare their dishes was probably most enlightening part of the night. The food was excellent, but seeing everything that went into each dish gave you a greater perspective and made each bite taste even better. The chefs explain their dishes while they're served and down the hatch it goes! Although each dish is fairly small, there are A LOT of courses, so COME HUNGRY!!\n\nService was spectacular! The professionalism was second to none, but never do you feel overwhelmed or stuffy. The rate in which your dishes are cleared, your table is wiped cleaned, your drinks are poured and the cadence in which the food was served was next level! Truly made the night feel special. \n\nShout out to William the bartender. Dude was such a cool guy, relaxed and witty. More importantly (in this context), his drinks were out of this world. Even the simplest of cocktails he was able to take to the next level through the mere preparation of the ingredients. By far some of the best cocktails I have ever had! Just wished they would let him name his own drinks (***wink***wink*** if you're reading this William). \n\nOn this note, A TIP: Unless you're a wine lover, I wouldn't recommend the drink pairing with dinner (which ranges from $95-100 something per person). The majority of the pairing was wine, if not all, the night I was there. Instead, indulge in a few cocktails which will run you $12-$18/ drink... \n\nOverall, the best dining experience I have EVER had. Pricey? Sure... but its worth it. I promise you.", "author": "Billy P."}

For the price, I would say this place gets 4 stars for service and 3 stars for food.  \n\nWe had a 830 dinner reservation.  I didn't realize this meant we won't be seated for dinner until 930 (e.g, bread and butter are served then).  We started in the upstairs lounge and had some snacks they serve starting with\n- punch with some kind of alcohol\n- whipped egg with honey and some thing spicy. This was good \n- then it was a trio of snacks.  I like the asparagus the best, then the fried ball.  Didn't like the tiny wrap.  Everything was bite size\n- next was a raw oyster with some kind of jello on top a little weird\n- lastly mushroom tempura - crisp and light.   I liked it\n- lastly some kind of mandarin soda with a long description. Was ok\n\nThis may sound like a lot of food but it wasn't much.  We then was led to our communal seats.  The communal nature of this was fun and we met some cool people however the dining chairs were horribly uncomfortable.  For a sit down dinner for 2+ hours, seemingly plastic white chairs with no cushion seems very out of place.  45 min in I asked for a cushion under my butt as my back was started to feel sore.  They said of course but didn't bring it. I had to get up and ask for it again.  That was kind of odd as the cushion was brought down on the side but not to me for some reason. \n\nDinner started at 935 with bread and butter. This was delicious especially I was quite hungry by this point.  The rest of dinner proceeded to be about 10-12 courses.  My favorites were\n- radish and geoduck salad.  Very refreshing and good mixed of crispy and crunch texture. Loved it\n- sea bass - crispy on outside and tender on the inside. The fried seaweed and soup that came with it was delicious\n- abalone dish was flavorful\n- the \"peaness\" dessert with yogurt. This was a perfect blend of flavors and the presentation by the chef was the most memorable. \n- the fresh mint tea - very fragrant and tasty\n\nWhat I didn't like were\n- order of the food.  Don't seem to have an order that fits my liking.  I like protein and veggie first starch last and from light to rich.  The order seemed more random and swings between rich and light and rich again.  \n- caviar with dumplings.  Dumplings were more like gnocchi and it was too starchy and fishy for my liking\n- sunchoke - goat cheese was too rich and again too starchy\n- lamb. I liked the tenderness of it but as it was the last salty course i was already too filled with starchy food to enjoy this as I normally would.  Wish it was presented much earlier.  The side salad and meat that came with it in a cup was weird\n- some kind of turd looking dessert that tasted pretty bland. Supposed to remind you of coco puffs but didn't really\n\nAs for the experience and service, \n- we liked going up to see how all of our food is prepared\n- we liked there were a lot of servers. \n- While the chef presentation was supposed to be a core part of the experience, it was hard to pay attention too long as most were very detailed but not that entertaining.  If you are very into cooking high end food, it may not be boring but for me it was hard to pay attention very long.  Like I said before the only one I listened to fully was the chef that presented the \"peaness\" dessert. He was very funny. \n\nWe concluded our dinner at 11:55pm. For the price of $250 a person not including drinks, I expected much more from the food.  Therefore, it was worth a try once but I won't be rushing back.", "author": "Lei H."}

Truly a unique experience where you will realize that this place feels much more than a dinner, it is a show! From the moment you step through that front door, the show begins. Without spoiling anything, all the sights and sounds you will be exposed to is all part of a larger plan of getting to know your neighbors, the food itself, and the chefs that prepared them.

It's definitely non-normative, eating with new people you just met, snacking on your courses upstairs in a lounge and having a little book to take notes is a fun and unique experience. The food is stellar, every dish was beautiful and the chefs were a joy. Being so close to the team that's cooking and being able to interact with them was awesome.\n\nThat being said, some cons that were big for me:\n- No air conditioning - What? It was so hot inside upstairs and downstairs it was unconformable for my group and the group next to me. Even taco bell has air conditioning. \n- The wait staff were nice but completely missed their mark. I ordered one drink.... 30 minutes later it never showed and our waiter never came back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-14", "description": "1900th review!\n\nLazy Bear isn't a 2 star Michelin restaurant.\n\nIt's a 2 star Michelin experience.\n\nI had actually heard about Lazy Bear years ago, when it was a pop-up restaurant. Back then, due to the lottery system and limited dates available it didn't seem possible for me to try to get a reservation. When we were back in San Francisco I was happy to hear that Lazy Bear had a permanent location serving dinners throughout the week.\n\nOwner and head chef David Barzelay has created a cohesive, innovative menu and dining adventure. From the moment you arrive you are transported into a fun, eclectic, yet contemporary and chic environment. Elements of nature (Especially of bears) and the outdoors pervade through the decor and food. Even the bathroom is appropriately outdoors/woodland themed (Don't worry it's not an outhouse). \n\nReservations are done online, and you prepay for your meal (Including tax and tip) when you reserve your date and time. After reserving and paying for your meal, you'll receive an e-mailed survey with a few questions to answer. If you are going to the restaurant for any type of celebration or have any allergies/food restrictions you can list them in the survey. \n\nThe prices are tiered due to popularity in booking, so weekend times and times around the holidays will be more expensive.\n \nWe took the bus here. The 49 will drop you off at 18th and Mission and there's a very short walk to the restaurant. We were greeted by a friendly hostess waiting outside the door. Upon entering the restaurant we were escorted to the upstairs lounge area where we had reserved seats on the couch next to some other diners. One cocktail is included with your reservation but you can also purchase additional cocktails the day-of. Our selection for the night was a divine vermouth punch, and if you aren't a drinker the non-alcoholic alternative was a citrus infused soda. We then were served an assortment of delicious bites, one course at a time. \n\nMy favorites of the light bites were the beautiful nuanced flavor of the oyster and the soft shell crab.\n\nWe were then led downstairs to the dining area. The dining space consists of two long tables, the idea being you will be making friends with your neighbors, sharing in your communal gustatory experiences. The kitchen is open and in front of the table, set up kind of like a stage since you have a great view of the prep area and can see each chef working to complete each meal. Talking with and observing the kitchen is encouraged. Chef Barzelay wants to make this an inclusive and as participative experience as possible. At the tables each diner gets a \"Field Guide\" which lists each dish for the night with notes you can take for each item. If you are celebrating a special occasion you will also have a card on your part of the table signed by all the staff. \n\nMy favorite course was the peas, which had a beautiful elegant presentation and fresh, clean flavors. I loved how each chef gave a presentation on the dish, explaining how each element worked together, and how the dish came to fruition. You can really tell they put a lot of heart and soul into each dish, experimenting with different techniques, putting together unique flavors to give you the most thrilling dish they could. The dishes also had an intellectual bend to them. For instance, their butter has been cultured for 5 years (I didn't even know you could culture butter for that long!). It had that sour buttermilk tang to it. I loved the idea of it, like it was the butter version of iconic San Francisco sourdough starters, babied over the years so that it can be used in present and future dishes. Although I didn't totally enjoy the sour taste of it with the dinner roll I felt like I had to eat all of that butter with my bread because it was so preciously kept for years. There were definitely some interesting and unique flavors I had never experienced before at this meal.\n\nDuring dessert service I opted to get the iced cold brew coffee at the end. It was smooth with a whipped, frothy topping on top.\n\nAfter the last dessert is served and any additional charges are settled, you are free to go back upstairs to indulge in cocktails if you wish. We had the first seating at 6 P.M. and we were done after 8:00 and a lot of the diners for the next seating were already upstairs noshing and sipping.\n\nService was impeccable and everything seemed like it was running like a well oiled machine. They certainly deserved their prepaid tips!\n\nI enjoyed my experience thoroughly here due to the innovation and creativity of chef Barzelay in creating not only intricately, intellectually crafted dishes but in putting together an atmosphere which is well thought out and modern, yet fun and whimsical. I'd love to dine here again when I'm back in San Francisco.\n\n4.75/5\n\nP.S. The namesake Lazy Bear is an anagram of the chef's last name.", "author": "Karen W."}

I was debating among a few other Michelin restaurants for my birthday, and I am glad I picked Lazy Bear. I got a birthday card on the table by my seat. It was signed by all the chefs and servers. What a cool surprise! \n\nI was skeptical at the beginning about the communal table sharing. It turns out really awesome experience to share food and stories with people with common interest. It definitely enhanced the enjoyment. It was relaxing with decency. \n\nFood and wines are absolutely wonderful. I took photos for almost everything. Each course is a piece of art work with heart and soul. The photos can only showcase the visual part but the taste, the smell, the feeling have touched my heart. Sometimes I don't just go to eat but feel it.  I think I can get that in Lazy Bear.\n\nWe chose the regular pairing as it's said to be adventurous. I am particularly impressed by one of the white wines, Domaine des accuses, \"Recto/Verso\", Ardeche. It has the plum taste that I never had from white wines before. I tried to look it up online but couldn't find it in the States. It must be Lazy Bear special.  \n\nI love digging deeper to each dish and wine. The incredible service has satisfied the foodies as we love the attention and knowledge. \n\nOur dinner reservation was 8:30pm. We arrived at 8pm in the upstairs lounge and left around 12am.

It was a pleasant experience and the staff were fun to talk to. They pride themselves in sourcing food from around the bay area. Most of the dishes evoke a sense of home and a childhood nostalgia, like the dinner roll you start dinner off with all the way to an olive oil creamsicle mimicking a push pop.\n\nYou start upstairs for 45 minutes with punch and some snacks. If you take the first seating, you're free to return up there after the meal as the second seating go down.\n\nWhipped scrambled eggs (bacon, maple, hot sauce) - this breakfast shot had all of these flavors and it was great.\n\nCrab toast (cauliflower, lardo, pumpernickel) - probably my least favorite. I think I got a bad piece of lardo. It had the consistency of a rough hide that was impossible to chew.\n\nShigoku oyster (winter citrus, chiles)\n\nCrispy maitake mushroom (creme fraiche 'n' allium dip) - their take on the onion dip really does remind you of the one you can pick up from the grocery store in a good way.\n\n---------------------------\n\nNow off to downstairs.

There's a cocktail hour where you mingle with other people and they serve some food. I thought that was cool. We did meet some nice people. The dishes served during cocktail hour was good. However, when we were seated for dinner, it was set up like Harry Potter style dining with a long table. I found the seats to be very uncomfortable since I was recovering from a back injury at that time. I was also sad they did not seat us next to the people we were with during cocktail hour. We were seated between 2 couples that did not really want to socialize, so it was kind of awkward sitting so close them. They didn't even talk to each other. I would have preferred having our own table and better chairs. The courses for dinner were just ok. I think because it was very similar to asian banquet food that night, but of course better presented. I didn't feel the dishes were that special that night. Overall, I thought it was just ok. You can also go to the kitchen and watch the cooks and talk to them if you're interested in how they make their dishes.

The waitresses and waiters are all kind, enthusiastic, and help set the mood for an enjoyable dinner and great time. \n\nThe dinner starts off with everyone gathering upstairs for a complimentary drink as well as the option to order additional wines or cocktails. The atmosphere here was cozy and comfortable. There are some couches and standing tables as well as a love seat spot in the corner. They then serve you a course of various \"snacks\", which are small appetizer dishes that are really pretty tasty. I had gotten the wine pairing so they start you off with your first pairing when they serve the snacks.\n\nAfter about an hour of this, they bring you back down to the 2 communal tables where you sit with the other diners of the night. You're encouraged to meet the people around you and you're also encouraged to go up to the open kitchen to observe or ask questions as the next courses are prepared. The chefs will step up and describe each course to you right before they are served. Throughout the whole night, the dinner atmosphere remains great, classy, and comfortable. \n\nThe food quality is great. Portions, I felt, were just right. You would imagine a 10 course meal to fill you up potentially to a point of discomfort, but at the end of the meal I felt satisfied and comfortably full. Each dish was unique and a wonderful blend of flavors. I recommend getting a wine pairing as it does make a great addition to the meal!\n\nIf somehow, someone doesn't enjoy the food, I think the experience in itself is one worth going through - it becomes quite obvious during the meal that the 2 Michelin stars were not earned from the food alone, but also for the overall experience. \n\nIt's also cool that they change up their menu every so often - for my dinner we actually had a dish that they were serving for the first time!

As said in prior reviews, this is an experience more attuned to a large dinner party where you get the chance to meet your neighbors, engage in pleasant banter both with the guests as well as the chefs (who knew Matt was a collector of Nike shoes), and eat copious amounts of delicious and well-executed small plates.  The evening started upstairs in the loft - casual seating with some in groups, others standing, and some in twos - which overlooks the main dining room with two long wooden communal tables that abet against the plating area where you can interact with the chefs.  The hors d'oeuvres portion was slow and methodical, and it came across at times, as people arrived, as a bit chaotic.  The menu includes a wine pairing, but we chose an excellent red from their extensive wine menu - although I must admit I was disappointed that they were out of the bottle we wanted and which the sommelier raved about (although they probably should have known this fact). The dinner came across without a hitch.  Watch for the choreography of the service which is smooth and well orchestrated.  A feast indeed for the body, mind and spirit.", "author": "Sol B."}

They announce each course as it is being served, which is really awkward because they tell you to eat but it feels impolite to.  So I just sat there staring at the people next to me scarfing down their course as the chef speaks.  I didn't love everything but I was at the minority of our party of 8.  They did do an excellent job on the \"sunflower\" course & the duck which I'm usually not a fan of but devoured every piece of.  \n\nThe only reason for the 4 Star (& I honestly should rate lower them lower because there were other minor mess-ups through the night) is because one of the  chefs humiliated someone in our party by hushing her like a child for whispering something across the table.  The other chef had just begun speaking & half of the people were stuffing their faces.  No one needs to be reprimanded on their night out.  It ruined her whole night out, which sucked because we were celebrating.  \n\nIt was just bad form because this individual was our cheerleader for booking this restaurant.  \n\nI won't come here again but I think if you're a foodie who wants to know where your food is from & how it's prepared before every course, then you'll love it.", "author": "A K."}

I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday, highly recommend for special occasions, it's definitely a treat! Lazy Bear recently received TWO Michelin stars and I honestly can see why. Their theme is like going to a dinner party. 40 people per seating, one at 6:30PM and the other one is at 8:30PM. I recommend the earlier seating because the whole experience does take around 2 hours. People in the first seating can go up to the bar around 9:30PM while they start serving the second seating! And also after 9:30PM, the bar is open to everyone from the outside.\n\nWe arrived around 5:15PM, when the doors opened. The hostess showed us around and brought us upstairs where we would have some drinks and snacks. I ordered the Cold Brew Coffee and my boyfriend got the Continental Breakfast. OMG the best drinks have ever had, like I'm not even joking! My Cold Brew Coffee, usually people order it during dessert time, but I heard so many great things about it, I couldn't help it and ordered it right away :D This drink will BLOW your mind, you MUST order it. It's a secret recipe and coffee master behind it is associated with Blue Bottle Coffee. Around 5:45PM, they start serving their house made Georgia Punch, very refreshing! The appetizers start coming in around 6PM then they move to to downstairs for the main course. When you get to your seating, you have a little note book and pen where it shows all the dishes and you can write your thoughts! If it's a special occasion you are celebrating, they will have a hand written card with everyone's signature! For each dish, someone in the kitchen team will describe what it is, they really want you to eat as they talk, although you can tell everyone looks at each other to see who makes the first bite LOL\n\nHere is what we had in order including appetizers:\nWhipped Scrambled Eggs: Wow, just wow. This shot tasted like a whole breakfast. Mixed with bacon, maple and hot sauce. Mind blowing\nSourdough Dumpling: Very interesting and tasty, caviar on top, mouth watering!\nPreserves: It had oysters, pig's head crepe and ferment greens fritter. Oysters were delicious, it what I really remembered, it has some kind of gelatin and then a small oyster beneath it.\nCrispy Maitake Mushroom: Crispy and delicious come with their home made onion sour cream, just wow.\nRhubarb Soda: Refreshing! Homemade, it was great!\nDinner Roll: Their signature dinner roll, the butter is made and kept for 5 years now, it was so soft and delicious!\nRadish: It had geoduck clam, cucumber and buttermilk, super refreshing, feels like summer is just around the corner\nArtichoke: It had halibut, blood orange and fennel, fish was cooked just right, also a very summer dish\nPeas: It had dried shellfish and dick ham XO sauce mixed into it. These are the freshest peas I have ever tasted. No words. \nMorels: Topped with a egg yolk that DOES NOT break. Amazing! The mushroom was salty and tasted like a meat\nGuinea Hen: This was one of my least favorites, nothing very special, chicken was very tender tho!\nGrilled Lamb: WOWOWOWOWOW so tender, fatty and juicy. You definitely save the best for last. I was SO mind blown and I'm still thinking about the lamb. It was also topped with gorgeous flowers and garnishes. You get a whole lamb champ, pretty good size. \nStrawberry Dessert: I wasn't too much of a fan, it was kind of TOO simple and too sweet for me\nBlueberry Desserts: Same with this one, too sweet for me.\nLast but not least, they had a platter of desserts that included gummy bears, cinnabon, pineapple bon bon and cake pop. I would say my favorite out of those was cinnabon!\n\nOverall, such an amazing experience. I can understand why this place earned their Michelin stars. They make you feel right at home and food is exceptional and creative. Bravo Lazy Bear!", "author": "Natalie L."}

Some of it had to do with my recent taking to Chef's table on Netflix, but this restaurant's tasting menu is amazing. My wife planned this as a surprise for our anniversary and I was blown away as the courses kept coming in.\n\nThe entire experience lasts about 2.5 to 3 hrs. \n\nWhen my wife made the reservations, she specified that we were vegetarians and she didn't have eggs (eggs were ok for me). The staff was really accomodative with the request and as we saw later, none of the dishes were compromised in taste, quality and presentation.\nThe setting is casual and mirrors a picnic theme in the Sierras. Everyone sits together around a picnic table for the main course and are encouraged to chat with each other and the chefs in the kitchen.\n\nBefore the main course, groups \"lounge\" around invidual tables where you are served with drinks and appetizers. We were served with 5 appetizers. I have included pictures of all items for appetizers, main course and desert for your reference.\n- Whipped scrambled eggs 10/10: This was my favorite appetizer and apparently is a \"constant\" for all seasons when you go to lazy bear. For my wife, the eggs were substituted by potatoes. The taste was insane, and the texture frothy. I really wish they could have served more of this.\n- Savory Custard 6/10\n- Grilled celery (smoked) 9/10: I could have never imagined celery can taste this good. \n- Cauliflower + cheese toast on sourdough bread: 8/10\n- Crispy mushroom of the woods with sour cream and Alliums dip 9/10\n\nExcept for the savory custard, all the other appetizers were outstanding.\n\nWe then proceeded to the main hall for the main course:\n- Bread and butter 8/10: The butter is a house made cultured butter that is very savory and tart. It pairs really nicely with the bread and you can ask for as many servings of butter and bread as you desire.\n- Kohlrabi and its roe 6/10: For me, I didn't like the taste of this dish. It felt a bit too bland.\n- Sunflower 9/10: Phenomenal dish. I loved the crunch, the mushroom flavor and the excellent presentation\n- Barley broth with egg yolk 8/10: I really liked this dish, the egg yolk was quite dense and the barley was quite cruncy. The broth was rich and very complex\n- Artichoke chips and black truffle 8.5/10: The artichoke was really creamy and rich and paired well with the hollaindaise sauce.\n- Cheese with barley grain 7.5/10: I rally liked the crispy leaves on this dish. Overall the barley was cheesy, creamy and savory\n- Rhubarb 6/10: This was a cold dish with a sorbet and coconut ice cream. It was sweet and sour.\n- Candy Cap 8/10: This is a special mushroom that was shaped as a donut and is naturally sweet with a maple syrup flavor. Loved it.\n- Treats: These were an assortment of treats at the end. I liked the banana bread with brownbutter jam the most followed by beet flavored gummy bear.", "author": "Venkat K."}

This could be a pro or con depending on who you're seated next to..but when you're seated next to pompously rich Trump-supporting New Yorkers, it's a con. In general, this is not the ambiance for a romantic evening with your spouse. I think Lazy Bear is best enjoyed in a group of friends.\n-Price. Obviously, it's expensive and we all know that. However, when I compare it to our Alinea meal that was only $100 more, I'd choose Alinea any day. Obviously, different cities and both are great choices, but yeah, at this price point I'm going to be a little more critical.

Those are the three things the Lazy Bear team loves to do to food in order to share foods at its peak with their guests. \n\nThe food is absolutely, without a doubt, phenomenal. Everything is thoroughly (and locally) sourced. The attention to detail in the flavors, technique, and plating blows me away. \n\nThe service is the best. The team here does NOT miss a beat. That alone justifies their ticket prices $$$ and the service fee. \n\nI went here in 2015 before they received their Michelin star(s), and came back again last night... almost two years later, and the experience/food has only gotten better. I usually don't revisit restaurants like these because I like the preserve the positive memory, but I have high regard for LB and I wanted to come back. I'm so glad I did!\n\nLazy bear has not only successfully preserved food the way it's meant to be enjoyed, but it has also preserved a spot in my heart.

Worth a try because it's different than what you would imagine a Michelin two.\n\nAmbiance: cute upper deck where you're escorted when you first arrive. Drinks and snacks are served to you as you relax comfortablely on the couch. Plenty of time to settle in before you go downstairs, get seated at the long-communal table, and start your tasting courses. Hint - best seat in the house is next to the kitchen where you can see the actions happen. One of chef Dave or his sous chefs came out and told the tale behind every course before the courses were brought out. I loved hearing about how courses were prepared and why they were prepared certain ways. Guests were encouraged to get up and converse with the sous chefs as they prepare. \n\nFood: unlike many Michelin starred restaurants (looking at you, French Laundry), Lazy Bear didn't rely on expensive ingredients to impress. It wins in taking common ingredients and made delicious meals out of them.\n\n-Snack: overall very well-done and creative. Egg foam with bacon and spicy syrup sauce is their icon and my favorite - Who DOESN'T like any form of eggs and bacon?! I also liked the oyster gel on oyster for creativity. Fried snow crab isn't usually my thing but they pared it well with edible flowers.\n\n-Main course: they really talked up their bread n butter but I didn't think it's anything special. Geoduck with avocado and melon is surprisingly delicious (Geoduck is usually chewy but this one isn't). Salmon with caviar is very fresh. Sweet corn with truffles wasn't a hit; too much truffle it overpowered the corn flavor. The pork ribs were cooked well although can be softer and more flavorful; I didn't care for the crunchy nuts on top of the pork. Lamb chop is definitely a star - roasted, ovened, cooked to perfect tenderness and flavor - it's the best lamb I remember having in the past 10 years.\n\n-Dessert: blueberry tart was good but forgettable. I'm not a fan of the peach ice cream; taste is too creamy and not fruity enough. The peanut butter balls were the highlight of dessert - creative presentation and an explosion of flavors.\n\n-After dessert: one of the best Asian tea list I've seen at a non-Asian restaurant. They even had pu'er!\n\n-Wine pairing: we got the old world pairing and it's so worth it. One of the best pairings I've had. I've rarely liked Chardonnay, and I didn't like the Chardonnay they served alone, but it paired perfectly with my sweetcorn and truffles!\n\nService: quick and friendly. Our somm is a bit rushed when he introduced the paring to us. An inherent flaw of the communal table setup.\n\nChef Dave is my kind of inspiration. From dinner parties in his law school apartment to a Michelin two star establishment, this man is a living proof that you can reinvent yourself and become best in class.", "author": "Heidi B."}

Three years later, it was my birthday, and I returned to find a Michelin-starred restaurant set up like the dinner party I always wanted to host only I didn't know anybody except Jamie W., of course. I have to admit I still giggle at the name and feel a need to explain that it's not a bear-trapping event on the Russian River but a real restaurant with silverware and synchronized servers. There are two seatings at their two long communal tables each evening, 6PM and 8:30PM, and oh yes, you pay in advance, $160 per person plus a 20% service charge.\n\nReservations need to be made in advance, a month in my case, in order to secure spaces, and for heaven's sake, don't be late because the purveyors warn you that if you arrive a half-hour late, you will have missed four courses. Period. Full stop. the door opens at 5:15PM, so I made sure I left work early and also pushed Jamie to skedaddle from his office. We ended up being the first ones there, and we were swept upstairs to the loft on a semi-private couch right below a twenty-year-old photo of Tom Selleck. We were immediately served a couple of Plum-Infused Pomegranate Punches in cut-glass cups like we were at a junior prom circa 1956 (photo: http://bit.ly/2dagfIJ).\n\nI was surprised we didn't get white gloves to pick them up properly. In need of something stiffer, I ordered the smoky and luscious $15 Basil Martini with Basil-Infused Mezcal, Dry Gin, Apple Mint Vermouth, and droplets of Basil Oil (photo: http://bit.ly/2dagEuN). Jamie curbed his enthusiasm by having a $3 bottle of Mexican cola called Jarritos. Thoroughly imbibed, we received our first course, the bottoms-up Whipped Scrambled Eggs served cocktail-style with Bacon, Maple Syrup, and Hot Sauce like a hangover breakfast (photo: http://bit.ly/2dUfF4p). Yummy. Next came a Brown Rice Chip with Channel Islands Halibut, Jimmy Nardello Pepper, and Sudachi decoratively placed on it (photo: http://bit.ly/2daf0ZP).\n\nThis was another lovely bite followed by a Broiled Shigoku Oyster with Nasturtium Gla\u00e7age and Lardo which I slurped with gusto (photo: http://bit.ly/2dHvaJn). The tempura-like Crispy Pole Beans arrived right after with a Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and Allum Dip (photo: http://bit.ly/2dUftCd). This was capped off by a fizzy, fermented Cape Gooseberry Soda replete with a candy-stripe straw (photo:  http://bit.ly/2dlSFpP). This flurry of upstairs activity finally segued to the downstairs where chef David Barzelay explained the concept behind Lazy Bear and had the sous chefs explain each of the courses we were about to dive into (photo: http://bit.ly/2dBCnep).\n\nThe first was simply a fabulous Dinner Roll made of Spelt & Rye with a huge slab of fresh butter (photo: http://bit.ly/2dzp1QW). It so reminded me of the ones I got from Mrs Crabtree in her hairnet at the school cafeteria. This was followed by a regally meltable Beef Tartare with Tomatoes and Seaweed as garnish (photo: http://bit.ly/2dCZd5R). The soup course came next with a creamy Cucumber Vichysoisse with Stugeon, Leek, Potato and bursts of delight from the Caviar (photo: http://bit.ly/2dzqhUd). We started moving into the proteins with the seafaring tastiness of the Monterey Abalone accompanied by Legumes, Arrowhead Cabbage and Mint in a faux-abalone shell (photo: http://bit.ly/2cYuu4U).\n\nThe Aged Squab was as rich as duck as it sat amid Huckleberries, Chanterelle and Sumac (photo: http://bit.ly/2dyPsZp). The high point came unsurprisingly in the rich and tender Wagyu Ribeye straight from Japan with Sunflower, Sunchoke, and Brassicas (photo: http://bit.ly/2dFJkuw). A palate cleanser came with the Cucumber Granita with a tiny cheesecake hidden underneath flavored with Lemon Verbena and Oats (photo: http://bit.ly/2d0dZAA). If there was a near-miss at all, it was the oddly retro Concord Grape Jelly with Madrone Bark and Grape Nuts (yes, the cereal...photo: http://bit.ly/2ecdcS1.\n\nFortunately a trio of treats came to the rescue: Strawberry P\u00e2te de Fruit with Jalape\u00f1o & Lime, Beehive Pavlova with Honey & Cardamom, and a S'More with Bay Leaf Meringue (photo: http://bit.ly/2dTHTHw). Oh and did I mention the $15 Peach Pit 94110 with Reisling, Bourbon, Fino Sherry, and Campari (photo: http://bit.ly/2dRG5zo) as well as the $6 Lazy Bear Cold Brew (photo: http://bit.ly/2e1vhDd)? Yep, the endless series of small plates came to a halt, and believe it or not, we were not overstuffed, just immensely satisfied with the culinary magic that was demonstrated in front of us. Kudos to Barzelay for a concept executed with style and flavor.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...unique culinary creativity with a twist worthy of this palate\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...fells like a high-end lodge in Yosemite\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...synchronized movements between courses and cocktails with unwavering precision\nTOTAL - 5 stars...multiple courses of artisan plates reflect a foodie's wet dream", "author": "Ed U."}

Not only do they encourage everyone to talk to each other, you don't have a choice but to sit next to strangers. I'm not a very social person when it comes to strangers so it wasn't a good experience for me. \n\nWhen I bought the tickets, I made a note asking to be seated at the end of the table. That way I will only have people on one side and not both. When they emailed to confirm the reservations, I mentioned it again. On the day of, we purposely went an hour before our time (we were the first ones to arrive) to tell them again that we wanted to be seated at the end of the table. After making all the attempts, we were told they could not seat us at the end of the table due to several large parties. I asked them if they can just shift the large party down and put us at the end, they said no. However, when they started seating everyone, I saw that they seated a couple at the end of our table and not a large party like they told us. They could have easily seated the two of us at the end instead of the other couple. I was already irritated so I did not ask or bring it up again to them. Everyone was seated already and it's not like they will tell the couple to switch with us. \n\nIf it wasn't for what happened, I think I would have enjoyed the experience. The food was good in general, a few dishes were great. However, what I really liked was the non-alcoholic drink paring option that was offered. Not many restaurants offer it but the ones that do don't put as much effort in it. The housemade cola was the most memorable. We wanted to order another glass but they were already out.\n\nThe other thing they can improve on is the experience in the lounge upstairs. They serve a few bites and drinks before dinner but you have to eat it with your hands. They do have cloth napkins but in this situation, they really need paper napkins when they pass the bites out. A lot of the people are just standing and don't even have a place to put their drink down. \n\nBesides what I mentioned above, the service overall was good. The open kitchen concept and the presentation of how they made each dish was great. If you like talking and eating with strangers this would be a fun experience for you but for someone like me who rather have a private table with my own party, this isn't a the place for you especially they are not accommodating at all with your seating requests.", "author": "Andy W."}

We got a great view at the balcony overlooking the 5:30 dinner crowd finishing up their desserts. Ladies in heels be prepared to bear it if you have a standing table before everyone is seated in the communal dining space.\n+ Courses opened strong with a complimentary cocktail. My boyfriend and I sampled amazing oysters bedded with elderflowers and fried zucchini blossoms stuffed with cheddar cheese. \n+ The bears are in the Valley.

After starters we were seated by our hosts to one of the two long tables by the kitchen. Not sure how we ended in the middle of the table against the wall but I think we lucked out. Being stuck on the end means you are limited to conversing with those next to just one side.\n+ Unpretentious setting. We were free to start as soon the dish landed in front of us. Also approaching the chefs while our next courses were in preparation were welcomed. Complimentary notebooks allowed us to take notes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-03", "description": "The Lazy Bear experience is one that is social, engaging, and bustling. You start off the evening mingling with other guests over snacks in the second floor. Once dinner is ready, everybody descends to the dining hall, where they are seated across 2 long communal tables that fit around 20 each. For my fellow Potterheads out there, think the Great Hall at Hogwarts. Throughout the meal, folks are encouraged to get up, roam around the restaurant, take pictures of the open kitchen, jot down remarks on their notebooks, engage in conversation with their neighbors, and ask the staff any questions they might have. It's a 2-hour ordeal that I guarantee you won't get anywhere else.\n\nMy favorite dishes of the night were the whipped scrambled eggs, dinner roll, red kuri squash, and black twig apple. Surprisingly, the one dish that I thought needed improvement was the wagyu ribeye. Its marbling was unevenly distributed, which caused some bites to taste fattier than others. The beef also lacked the succulent flavor and buttery tenderness that I was expecting.\n\nAnother qualm was that I found it difficult to savor every single bite like I'm accustomed to. In any given fine dining setting, I'm usually the person with the largest appetite but the slowest eating pace. This didn't bode well for me here, since the servers were already handing out subsequent courses as I was still nibbling away. Because of this, the experience felt a little rushed. Everybody else seemed to keep up just fine though, so again, it's probably just me.\n\nSNACKS\n// Whipped Scrambled Eggs - bacon, maple, hot sauce\n// Channel Islands Halibut - Jimmy Nardello pepper, brown rice, sudachi\n// Broiled Shigoku Oyster - redwood, nasturtium, lardo\n// Crispy Pole Beans - cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche 'n' allium dip\n// Grapefruit and Elderflower Soda - fermented, bubbles\n\n// Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll - cultured butter\n// Sturgeon & Caviar - cucumber vichysoisse, leek, potato\n// Abalone - legumes, Brussels sprout, mints\n// Matsutake Broth - apple, nettle, egg yolk fudge\n// Red Kuri Squash - quince, kale, goat's milk\n// Aged Duck - grape, chicories, black olive\n// Wagyu Ribeye - from Miyazaki Prefecture, cabbage, pink peppercorn, brassicas\n// Pomegranate Meringue - kaffir lime, hibiscus\n// Black Twig Apple - whipped yogurt, walnut sabl\u00e9, cider caramel\n\nTREATS\n// Concord Grape Jelly - peanut, cayenne\n// Beehive Pavlova - caramelized honey\n// Pumpkin Spice Latte - coffee cool whip\n\nBEVERAGES\n// Golden Feather Tea - the only tea grown in California\n\nProTip #1: The leather sofas by the wall are by far the comfiest spots to hang out on the second floor. Grab a seat on one of these bad boys if you arrive early.\n\nProTip #2: You can request for an additional dinner roll (without butter), but they do run out eventually.

If it was cheaper, I'd probably go back gladly.\n\n+One star for absolutely excellent service. The wait staff is very attentive and incredibly knowledgeable about the food and the wine or drinks to pair with it. I was quite impressed with the sommelier who came and talked to my party extensively about the different beverage options that they have, where they came from, and what elements of the food each taste would bring out.\n\n+Another star is for an incredible atmosphere. Lazy bear does a great job of modernizing the upscale food environment. The seating is family-style and they encourage you to meet the people around you, and also go out to the kitchen and interact with the chefs. I've never seen that before and that was really fun.\n\nThe reason for my lack of five stars is because the food actually was not that good. Instead of bringing out the fantastic ingredients that they had to work with, they hit them with extra \"stuff \". For example the abalone was chopped up and put with a foamy sauce and a ton of breadcrumbs. It completely had the taste of the abalone, or the experience you can get from having a rare ingredient like that.  I had the same experience with the fish and duck we were served.

Tickets are purchased at the end of the month before, if you sign up for the mailing list they'll email you every month when tickets are available. Otherwise, you can try and get them online by monitoring the waitlist. This experience was very unique, it's different from the usual michelin-rated fine-dining restaurant. It almost felt like a little show where they announced every dish to everyone that's dining at the same time and they plate everything in front. \n\nI recommend the 6:30pm seating if there's availability. On the night we dined (A tuesday night) the first seating took longer than I expected and the 8:30pm seating didn't start until around 9:00. If you do go for the second seating make sure you eat a light snack beforehand and be prepared to stay up late. \n\nI eat a lot but the portions here are pretty big compared to other fancy places so I was pretty full 3-4 courses from the end.

If one were to separate one from the other I feel this place would fall flat.\n\nDo not get me wrong some of the dishes here are sublime: Take the Squab dish. It is so intricate with so many small ingredients and techniques used that it blurs the mind. There were probably 7-10 ingredients used Sumac, Chanterelles, blueberries, branches, and infusions.\n\nThe Monterey Abalone, again, was an incredibly complex dish using the liver with brown butter to make an incredible sauce, legumes, cabbage, and mint. Mint was an out of box idea that really worked. Flavors I have never had before.\n\nThe summer squash puree/soup was also just stunning with wonderful unique flavors ( the mussels infusion is pure genius), and wonderful contrasting textures ( beans, crunchy fried squash, and softer Nasturtium textures)\n\nBut there were many  dishes that were so so: Take the corn grits with Australian truffles. The truffles were just awful ( nothing like their brethren in Italy or France). Furthermore the grits were a very one dimensional dish...just mush.\n\nThe lamb dish was very complex sounding but my piece of meat was um...not meaty and basically fatty. Who can taste all of the techniques when there was nothing to really try.\n\nEven the desserts were hit and miss. Our first dish ( Huckleberry with sour cream and rye crumbles) was not sweet, not really texturally appealing.\n\nThe second dessert, White Chocolates, was fantastic. Tiny in appearance but so many subtle things going on...flavor wise and texturally.\n\nWe opted for the wine pairings and they were rather blah...especially for the price. I didn't really feel that many complemented the food they were paired with.\n\nThe biggest complaint from our friends and my wife were that they constantly felt rushed. You see they have two seating's and they have a strict time table to be kept. My friend had trouble keeping up with her wines...and they kept bringing and bringing....who want's to chug their wines? \n\nLastly while there are many dishes the dishes are bite size for the most part. To put it simply...I left hungry.\n\nWhat everyone liked was the atmosphere and the presentation. Service is Stellar here. The chefs explaining each dish was very nice as well. It was lovely to mingle with new friends in a communal spirit.  \n\nBut playing loud 70s-80s music ( which was awesome)  created an atmosphere of diners having to speak louder and louder to the point where one could not hear themselves speak.\n\nIf you want a very unique dinning experience and money is no object this is a very unique and cool place to check out but for a pure food experience I think there are better options in the Bay Area.", "author": "David G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-29", "description": "Truly a one-of-a-kind dining experience. The set-up of the restaurant is designed to be rustic and homey, with a furnished upper area where snacks are served and you're invited to stay as long as you want after dinner. My friend and I arrived a little bit after doors opened, and when we were escorted to the upper level, the seats were mostly full. We had to share a standing table with a nice man who educated us on how expensive the drinks pairing was. It's okay to arrive after doors open; you'll still get to sample all the snacks! We did have to wait a good amount of time for the waiters to actually start serving us snacks, and we waited even longer to get a drink. Communication could've been better because people started heading downstairs of their own volition, and we didn't know if we were supposed to follow or wait for someone to seat us. \n\nSNACKS. Oh, how I'd love to relive those whipped scrambled eggs and shigoku oysters. The eggs were so light and refreshing, with the slight flare provided by the hot sauce. The oysters tasted like the seat. The crispy pole beans were basically tempura-fried beans with fancy sour cream, but they were delicious. Goat cheese tart was well-paired with the fig. Caviar... I honestly don't remember this dish. My taste buds were probably recovering from their fervor. \n\nI love the set-up and the ability to watch the chefs plate the food. The dexterous way they place things really shows you the effort and thought that goes into the dishes. It's almost emotionally painful to eat them because art shouldn't be consumed, only appreciated. We went up a couple times to watch the chefs work and asked them questions. They didn't really give us actual answers (in answer to where the flowers for the dishes came from, one of the chefs said they drove to Golden Gate Park and picked them), but what do I know? \n\nI noted my experience with each dish because they provide a little booklet with all the courses, so I got to feel like a pretentious food critic: \n\nSpelt & Rye Dinner Roll - Could taste the slight sourness in the butter, and it folded perfectly under my knife. When I touched the bread, my fingers just sunk in like it was a beautiful golden cloud. \n\nBeef Tartare with Tomato and Seaweed - Someone apparently hand dove for that seaweed. The tomatoes were unbelievably sweet - why don't they sell this stuff at Safeway? The meat packs a punch with every bite, and the squid ink crisps were a kind of dark saltiness that brought the whole dish together. \n\nAbalone with Legumes, Arrowhead Cabbage, Mints - The sauce was Cheetos-flavored. The chef said so himself. I love Cheetos, so I can't complain when it's suddenly okay to eat Cheetos in fine dining. There were brief bursts of flavor from the herbs, which were apparently harvested by some hippie man. They punctuated the chewiness of the abalone. \n\nSummer Squash (cold soup with mussels, beans, nasturtium) - Cold soup done right. The sharp bite of mint and coolness of the squash made me feel like I was inhaling a garden. The mussel is the very special center of the dish, and it's packed with flavor from all the sauces that it got dunked in before being placed into the plate. \n\nFresh Corn Grits - This one wasn't too impressive. I couldn't taste the truffles, and the corn was almost overwhelmingly sweet. \n\nAged Squab with Blueberry, Chanterelle, Sumac - Super rustic. It brings out memories of forests and food cooked in the midst of fires. There's a smokiness contained within the meat. Also, there was an edible twig. Where else can you eat branches and have it be called fine dining? \n\nGrilled Lamb - This one was pretty basic, but still delicious. A lamb chop covered in aromatic pine leaves that was so tender. This one broke the pattern because the pine leaves were unfortunately not edible. \n\nHuckleberry - The transition between main courses and dessert, this one was mostly muted flavors punctuated by the taste of huckleberry. \n\nWhite Chocolate with Laurel, Fennel, Honey, Chamomile - This went really well with the white tea I ordered, and it just brimmed with wildflowers. A little too sweet for me, but I loved the floral-scented cream inside and the drizzle of honey. \n\nTreats: Honey beehive... I'll eat honey up no matter what. This one had that great texture where it's crispy and gives beneath your teeth, but then it clumps up and you can suck on it for a bit to get all the flavor. \n\nOverall, I love the humor of this place and the appreciation for nature that comes through in all its dishes. I wish I didn't feel that treatment of us wasn't the same because we didn't fit into the same class as the other diners. Side note: if you order tea/coffee/any drink they offer at the end of dinner, you will be charged. Enjoy your time at this place and take it slow! The people next to me were just charging through their courses, and that's no way to enjoy a $200 meal.", "author": "Sophie W."}

I did some research and it had a very interesting dining experience compare to other tasting menu restaurant. Through ticketing system, we bought two and it was one of the best dining experience I had so far.\n\nFirst thing first, lemonade cocktail to kick off the evening in the lounging area upstairs. Then followed by cocktail menus and small bites. Let's being the breakdown.\n\nUpstairs/Small Bites:\n1. Egg mouse scramble flavored with smoked bacon and hot sauce \n2. Cucumber something - very earthy, don't remember....\n3. Goat Cheese mousse and Beets - OMG SO F**KING GOOD\n4. Fried beans with sour cream ranch sauce\n\nEscorted downstairs.\n\nDownstairs/Small Bites Continue\n5. Puddling with caviar \n6. Bread and Butter \n\nMains:\n7. Beef topped with tomato - OH MAH GOD\n8. Cold squash soup with clams and veges - SO F**KING GOOD\n9. Fresh farm potatoes - LIKE OMFG\n10. Quail with blueberries \n11. Corn grits with truffle - OMFG \n12. Lamb chop - soooooo goooooood\n\nDessert: \n13. Melon, matcha, pistachio, cake - SO GOOD \n14. Apricot ice cream with soy sauce - Yum\n15.

It certainly has that camping feeling, sitting around a communal table in a woodsy cabin setting but with a twist, because everything feels modern and all the guests are dressed to the nines. Food and drink 4/5 stars. Social experience and Atmosphere 5/5 stars. Service 5/5 stars.\n\nArrive at least 30 minutes early because you'll be escorted to the lounge area upstairs where you'll be served punch, and 4 different appetizers which were all very good. I'll go on to review my favs / highlights of the tasting menu.\n\nWhipped Scrambled Eggs (snack) - with bacon, maple, hot sauce served in a tall shot glass. I loved this because it was packed with umph and flavor. Absolutely delightful.\n\nFried Soft Shell Crab (snack) - with green tomato, ramps, and cilantro. Who doesn't like soft shell crab?! One soft shell crab per 2 people and the serving was generous! Crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, can't really screw up on this dish!\n\nDungeness Crab (1st course) - with charred cucumber, sugar snap pea, avocado, and mint. Color and presentation was absolutely beautiful with the bright green colors. Delicious flavors that opened up my taste buds.\n\nHalibut (2nd course) - with crawfish, summer squash, and nasturtium - the halibut is poached sous vide style so it retained a lot of moisture yet flaky and smooth to the tongue. My favorite was the reddish orange crawfish sauce made from the juices of crawfish heads, the flavors were very concentrated. \n\nPorcini (3rd course) - with fudgy yolk, blackberry, and grains - I am a big fan of runny yolk and this yolk, I don't know how they did it, was poached to perfection.\n\nCold Brew Coffee with brown sugar whip - OMG. Just get it. If you're a coffee lover, you will love this one.\n\nI realized I liked most of the seafood because they were all made very well with complex flavors and textures. I wasn't too impressed on the Guinea Hen, Bintje Potato Fondue, Grilled Lamb or any of the desserts. My fianc\u00e9 had the drink pairing and the drinks kept coming for him. I suggest ordering your drinks at the lounge upstairs because if you want to order drinks down at the communal table, its a little harder to flag somebody down. The portions are plentiful, you will leave full.\n\nWe came with another couple for a double date and we also got to meet and  mingle with the guests next to us and it was quite fun getting to know everyone. The entire meal felt almost like a performance with their open concept kitchen. We walked up and took pictures of the chefs and asked questions when appropriate.

They will lead you upstairs where you will sit around, mingle, and enjoy a drink for a bit. This is also where they serve you the first 4 dishes. After that, they will call each group down one at a time and seat you. The Lazy Bear notebook, a pencil, and the next dish will be there. For the rest of the night, they encourage you to talk to your neighbors and visit them in the back where the dishes are prepped.\n\nI don't like lamb nor matcha powder since most lamb dishes have a weird after taste and matcha powder suffocates me and overshadows the rest of the dish. Plus, powder is a weird texture to put on anything. For the oyster dish, they put a healthy juice on it. I have no idea who would approve of that because it was gross. It reminded me of the 3-day juice cleanse I've done before, except this time instead of suppressing my hunger, the juice ruined my oyster. And then there was a goat cheese cheese dish and I don't like goat cheese. So yeah, that's 4 dishes that didn't work for me.\n\nThe rest of the food was OK, but not worth $200.

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I see two Michelin stars and I get excited. The experience wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go back again and it's not a place I would recommend for friends or family. \n\nSome yelpers have said the portions were too small, but to me they were perfect. I started struggling at the end because I was getting so full. Part of my issue was more with the pacing of the meal. Once we sat down for the main meal, everything came out incredibly fast. My two friends had ordered the wine pairing. They received a new pairing with each course and barely had two sips before another pairing was brought out. It would seem appropriate if Lazy Bear staff started chanting \"shot, shot, shot, shot, shot.\" \n\nThey had a very large front of house staff which seemed necessary for the operation. However, there were different people coming up to the table constantly and the lack of continuity in the service started to feel almost jarring. Not only that, but each course is introduced by a different chef and their way of silencing diners was by screaming \"heeey.\" That kind of interjection would seem cool for a frat party, but not a fine dining experience where people are shelling out $300 per person. Try a small gong or chimes. \n\nThe setup of the space can also make it difficult to hear. We were in the first seating at 6 pm. The space is setup with one small dining room on the main floor and a lofted bar area which overlooks the dining room. Once the second seating arrived and were shown to the bar seating, it became even more difficult to hear. \n\nThey also encourage you to get to know your neighbors as it's communal seating. We were seated at the head of the table furthest from the kitchen. When we turned to introduce ourselves to our neighbors, they were busy talking about \"the most epic night ever when they drank two bottles of wine on their trip to Mexico and then like totally ended up in some super sketchy neighborhood. Omg, it was like, so funny.\" Expect to overhear inane conversations by people who fancy themselves interesting. \n\nThe food itself was interesting and most of it delicious. From the servers there was definitely an almost academic way of describing the food which I believe shows their passion, but others might find pretentious. But the day after dining, nothing about the flavors is jumping out as memorable or giving me a reason to rush back. \n\nI'm happy I tried it, but not worth the hype.", "author": "Tebs O."}

Servers all knew what we ordered and who was served in this small mezzanine area. Ideally, I would have liked the mezzanine area to be a bit bigger. I felt quasi-clustaphobic. \n\nSnacks:\n-Whipped scrambled eggs: 3.5/5 a bit salty, but custardy delicious\n-Green Machine oyster: 2.5/5 definitely tasted like a green machine smoothie...the oyster was superb, but the sauce was not\n-Whipped Goat Cheese: 3/5 eh, it was OK\n-Beef Tartare: 5/5 my favorite \"snack of the night\" \n\nApproaching 6:50pm, we were escorted down to the dining area. The staff encouraged us to treat our experience like a \"dinner party.\" We kindly introduced ourselves to our neighbors as we were seat in a communal table. There were two long communal tables. Sitting down, one of the dishes were already in front of us.\n\nSavory dishes:\n-Caviar: 4/5 this was delicious. I am usually not a fan of caviar, but this dish was well prepared. \n- Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll: 2.5/5 I've had better. Honestly, the dinner roll was too salty for my taste. The butter was good though.\n-Asparagus: 4.5/5 Surprisingly delicious and very refreshing\n-Halibut: 3/5 OK, nothing special and a bit salty for my palate\n-Artichoke: 5/5 This was my one of 2 favorite savory dishes! Never knew artichoke could taste so GOOD!\n-Morels: 5/5 YUM!!! My 2 of 2 favorite savory dishes of the night! I am amazed at how they prepared the egg!!!!\n-Grilled Lamb: 4/5 I am not a fan of lamb. When I saw this on the menu, I was a bit disappointed, but I was wrong!!! The lamb was not gamey at all! Delicious lamb dish!\n-Cured Carrots: 3/5 eh, coudl've gone without this, but the bone marrow in this dish made it worth while.\n\nSweet dishes: \n-Rhubarb: 3/5 this was OK--the white chocolate was the only thing good in this dish. The Hibiscus was overpowering for this dish.\n-Cereal Grain: 2.5/5 this was my least favorite sweet dish. The \"cereal grain\" at the bottom was a bit dry. The goat milk \"ice cream\" was pretty tasty, but overall, this dish did not stand out to me.\n-Coconut: 2.5/5 okay, not memorable\n-Cocoa Nib Jelly Roll: 2.5/5 Again, not memorable\n-Honey Meringue: 3.5/5 good and innovative, but again, it was just OK\n\n\nIn conclusion, Lazy Bear has perfected their veggie dishes; the fish was OK and the desserts were a bit disappointing for a fine dining establishment (no WOW factor).  \n\nFinal question: Would I come back again?

There is complimentary punch, which was delicious but pretty light, and we also ordered a couple cocktails. The meal starts up here with four \"snacks\", basically bite-sized appetizers. All were delicious and primed me for the rest of the night. (I won't go into too much detail about the specific courses since the menu changes frequently.) From the upstairs mezzanine, you can actually observe the previous seating finishing up or the waiters setting the table. \n\nWhen it was time to get seated at the communal table downstairs, they remembered our names still! This was a really nice surprise and showed how much thought they put into the whole experience. Because I had the menu customized for my friend's birthday, I knew they had to have remembered who we were in order to lead us to the correct seats with the menu already there. (Sidenote: the little menu booklets are adorable and you get to keep them!!) There's no dress code, but I did notice that people were dressed pretty nicely for the most part.\n\nWith the open kitchen, we were free to walk up and watch them plate every dish meticulously. All of the courses were spectacular! Before each course was served, the chef that prepared it would speak a little about it to the entire room, giving a bit of context for where the ingredients are sourced, etc. They actually forage some of the vegetables themselves! I couldn't complain about any of the main courses, but the desserts are on the unique side and can be hit or miss. I applaud the pastry chef for being bold, and everything was definitely very well-made, but some of the flavors didn't agree with my palate as much.\n\nOne of my favorite cocktails, if it's on the menu, was a twist on the classic old-fashioned, made with Japanese whiskey. It was so smooth and well-balanced. Also, if you have any room left in your stomach at the end of the meal, you have to try their signature iced coffee! It comes in a beaker, and the whipped cream floating on top is absolutely rich and decadent.\n\nYou might think that Lazy Bear has been hyped up too much, but I promise you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Tiffany P."}

I had no idea a simple fish bone broth could outshine the actual sea bass. Each plate is small, but there are a total of 5 snack courses, 6 dinner courses and two dessert courses that you will definitely not leave hungry.\n\nThe service staff was very attentive and the synchronized plating across a long dining table was amusing.

There's plenty of opportunity to mingle with other guests, however you're not forced to.  \n\nWhile this is a fine dining experience, the vibe of the place is still very laid back. The inside of the restaurant is made to look like a (very nicely decorated) cozy cabin and the boy scout/camping type of theme is super cute.

First three courses were served upstairs and I still DREAM and crave the crab rueben, if you will. Each dish is introduced and discussed and once you come downstairs for the sit down portion of the meal  the chef comes out and talks about it and you can go walk up to the kitchen where they are cooking which is very nice. I have all the photos and I will say this I LOVED every course except the small bites desserts. Some were classic flavors elevated and some novel ideas great balance of foreign and familiarity.  The Cheese course blew my mind (cheese is my first love, don't tell my exes) and the fromager came out and went through the process. The bread and butter to start with was mind blowing I have never in my whole life had the desire to eat just BUTTER, what have you done to me lazy bear?!? In case you miss the theme here the butter was basically the taste of a soft cheese. See pics for descriptions.\n\nTwo comments. I would have just not served the last course the small dessert bites no of us liked any of them. End with a cheese course, take advantage of Lisa that woman and her cheese are magic. Or stop at the previous course and the meal would have been amazing and nothing would be missing. Sad to end on a low note. \n\nAnd for those at the ends of the table it is extremely distracting when the guests for the second seating are coming in.

In fact, you actually have to pre-purchase a ticket to dine here.  Being Valentines weekend, the cost of admission came out to nearly $300 per person, and that's without the over the top beverage pairings!

The decor makes the space feel like the most incredible log cabin in the woods and is perfectly sized to feel intimate but not cramped when full of dinner guests.  The amazing view over the dining room is a tease, contributing to the build-up of anticipating that I've been feeling for weeks.\n\nI'm not sure what is normally served, but we started off with a nice dry champagne and special spiked punch blend (which was incredibly complex and refreshing).  To accompany the beverages, Lazy Bear likes to get things started with some amazing appetizers (or snacks as they call them).  Ours mezzanine snacks included:\n\n1) Whipped scrambled eggs - Breakfast in a shot, consisting of a whipped egg foam with bacon fat and an amazing hot sauce that I wish they would bottle.\n\n2) Shigoku oyster - Fresh oyster shooter served with an oyster broth and frozen kiwi sauce.  It had incredibly clean flavors, though the kiwi seeds could be a little overpowering to the delicate flavor of the sweet oyster.\n\n3) Beef tartare - Served on a brown rice cracker with shaved foie gras - incredibly delicate flavors and textures that melt in your mouth.\n\n4) T\u00eate de moine - Celery root mousse with Swiss raw cow's milk cheese, compressed dehydrated Asian pear, and pine tips.  Amazing texture and flavor from the perfect little bite.\n\nI ordered the \"exquisite\" Ruhstaller to cleanse the palette before we were led down to the dining room and our assigned seats.  Waiting for us was a Lazy Bear field guide (a menu booklet for note-taking) and our final snack:\n\n5) Caviar - An homage to San Francisco featuring a sourdough cracker, caviar, and a pur\u00e9e.  Again, amazing sourdough flavors and textures.\n\nChef David Barzelay opened dinner with the protocol for the evening and told the story of their absolutely incredible, mouth-watering spelt & rye dinner roll served with their signature cultured butter.\n\n6) Going on 3 years old, their butter culture produces a product that reminded me of a strong cheese.  The combination was like nothing I've ever had, and I yearned (and continue to yearn) for more.\n\nIf you've never had the privilege of dining at Lazy Bear before, each dish is served with a description from the chef who concocted its creation.  Between dishes, guests are encouraged to meet their neighbors, roam throughout the dining room, visit the bar, or even stop by the kitchen to watch (or in my case to photograph) as the chefs meticulously placed each component of the dishes during plating.  As expected, each dish was incredible thoughtful, and told a story.\n\n7) Bay scallop with geoduck, dill, buttermilk, and bergamot.  The seafood was incredible fresh and tender, with a slight sourness, and I love the bite of the geoduck.  The chef himself foraged the spinach used in the dish.\n\n8) Steelhead trout with a fried stinging nettle, hedgehog mushroom, butterball potatoes, and an amazing smoked salmon roe.  The fish was served with a butterball potato, green garlic, and stinging nettle mash that inherited a nice green color and had just a hint of the subtle garlic flavors.\n\n9) Poussin with lettuce and spring onion.  It's a 21-day old chicken breast that is sous vide to maintain it's incredibly tender texture with subtle, clean flavors.  The chicken was raised on a diet of lacto-fermented grains which was apparent in the meat.\n\n10) Poussin Bouillon - The egg yolk fudge is served with fermented grains and spring onion, and includes a stock made from the chicken itself as a table-side pour over.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the evening because of its richness and the level of technique involved.  It also felt familiar, like a dish I grew up with...  Wonderful.\n\n...\n\nI hit the character limit for this review so please read the rest on Medium: https://medium.com/@epicsaurus/lazy-bear-reviewed-6f415262a8bf.", "author": "Joe M."}

The Lazy Bear dining experience is unlike any other and I'm totally a fan. I don't think it's worth it to review the individual food items because the menu is constantly changing but let it be known that every item was delicious, unique and unlike any other dish you've ever had. \n\nOther good points\n-Try to be in the first 6:00 seating. The second seating is 8:30 but we were definitely still in our seats well after 9:00 and are told we are welcome to linger as long as we'd like so you'll likely maximize your time more with the first seating.\n-The tasting comes with one cocktail and a couple of small bites upstairs to ease you in before you're shown to the table.\n-The table is communal and you are encouraged to chat and make new friends so it's definitely not for those who like their privacy and space. We ended up having some wonderful conversations, mainly about how delicious the food is!\n-The wine tasting is pretty generous so feel free to split one, it's definitely enough and you can supplement with cocktails and wines as you go.\n\nAll in all a great time and I can't wait to be back!

Save your money!\n\nLazy Bear is what I would call a sacred cow, one of the SF pop up underdogs you can't hate on because of the history of how they came about, and the \"local ingredients\" they use. After years as a pop-up in the Mission, they finally secured 20-year long lease in place of Hi-Lo BBQ. People are strangely intrigued by the supposed unique Lazy Bear experience: start with apps, eat in a communal setting, ask chefs questions throughout the meal. Turns out, their head chef is not so laid back, and some of his cooking staff are just as pretentious. How unfortunate But more importantly the food is not bad, but there are so many other restaurants worth going to first.\n\nNow, reservations are still hard but not as bad as before - they release tickets on their website for group seatings (6 and 8:15pm), offering a prix-fixe, pre-paid $180/pp meal after tip/tax (wine pairings $75, can be added when you get there).\n\n*******THE FOOD*******\nI really wanted to like LB but I had to rank this establishment as I usually do, based on 3 main factors: 1) Food Quality/Value, 2) Innovation/Taste, 3) Service/Experience\n\n1) FOOD QUALITY/VALUE - 2 STARS:\nAt $180/pp after tip/tax, Lazy Bear is far inferior in value to similar caliber restaurants - Liholiho, State Bird, The Progress to name a few. Lazy Bear deceives you into feeling you get great value, by serving you \"4 courses\" before dinner begins (which are actually 4 h'ours devours). Dinner is several \"courses\", some of which I could fit into my mouth in a single bite (e.g. the micro slice of squab I received - see pics).\n\n2)  INNOVATION/TASTE - 3.5 STARS:\nWhile MOST dishes were tasty, NONE were especially innovative. I definitely had favorites, and some things I've never had before; innovation/taste were the highest marks Lazy Bear got from me, but the innovation and flavor did not justify the price tag in any way.\n\n3) SERVICE/EXPERIENCE - 2 STARS:\nThe wait staff and sommelier were attentive, knowledgeable yet unintrusive - the perfect balance of wait staff you could ever ask for. However, the head chef and cooking staff encourage patrons to visit the kitchen and ask questions, yet they are rude and pretentious. I hate that people like this corroborate false stereotypes about the Mission, but they do.\n\nI regretfully left Lazy Bear partially hungry, personally insulted, and woefully regretful for the wasted time and money on this dining experience. I'm generally the type to encourage everyone to try everything once, but I encourage you to prioritize other fine dining establishments before this one.", "author": "Jess C."}

The only thing that took off a star was that when the owner chef came out to talk, I was having a conversation with my wife.

Everything was perfect- atmosphere, food, decor, service, everything. I couldn't stop smiling. I was like kinda uncomfortably full in the best way but still totally smiling. \n\nMy favorite part was how different it felt from any other dinners I'd been to. I loved how it was an optional interactive experience. Before each course, a chef would give a talk about what was being served. Food tastes better when you know who created it, the passion and thought that was put into it. Dinner is also served with a little field guide notebook that is the menu. I don't know why I'd need to take notes but it was fun to take notes about each dish. \n\nThe other cool part is the sense of community and dinner party style that is encouraged at the long community tables. It's recommended to introduce yourself and talk to your neighbors at the table. We sat next to two amazing couples which made the dinner so much more fun. Guests were also encouraged to go into the open kitchen and talk with chef's, tell them jokes, ask them questions etc. The entire staff was super cool, happy, and friendly. Quite a show going on there because everyone a the 40 person community tables is served at the same time. Great coordination and thought goes into the service and I appreciate that. No lazy bears on staff. Everyone works hard. I think the only lazy bear is me after the meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-23", "description": "Just discovered my field guide from March 25, 2015 while cleaning up and realized I never reviewed this amazing meal.\n\nFirst off, a solid star for giving me a glass of punch when I walk through the door. Delightful. Another star for confirming the one menu swap request I had put in in advance (no lamb/beef). They totally worked around this for us, which was unexpected. I loved the appetizers served upstairs in the lounge area and appreciated the glass of sparkling wine to kick things off:\n-Whipped Scrambled Eggs (with Bacon, Maple, Hot Sauce)\n-House Kosho Oyster\n-King Salmon (with Pickled Green Strawberry)\n-Foie Gras (with Kumquat, Fennel, Brown Butter Brioche)\n-Artichoke Dip (with Aged Cheddar, Artichoke Chips)\n\nThey were all great but I remember my husband really liking an oyster which is a rare thing. The scrambled eggs served in a shot glass were warm and tasty like a soup, and the scrumptious foie gras seemed to be the crowd fav (they just started to let us eat that again).\n\nOnce downstairs, I enjoyed the open kitchen and the chefs who explain each course with a shocking amount of detail (some people found this excessive but I thought it was adorable in a Portlandia sketch kind of way). \n\nI think the one thing that really set our dinner apart was the wine pairing. We love wine and spend a great deal of time drinking :::ahem::: doing wine research, but we don't often do wine pairings with multi-course meals. I have certainly never had a pairing that changed my experience quite so much. With each course we were directed to taste the wine, then taste with the food. Each time, things changed. Everything went together so perfectly. It really added to the experience for me.\n\nThat said, I will now relay for you the courses along with a smattering of my wine-induced notations:\n-Valentine's Bread: Nikki Notes \"Soft Butter=yum. Lactic Tang. Gluten good.\" I just remember thinking, damn, this bread and butter is amazing.\n\n-Charred Onion Broth with Country ham, Egg yolk, Apple, Scallion\n\n-Sweet Pea Custard with Cured Steelhead Roe, Pea Shell-Mint Sauce, Spring Onion Nikki Notes \"Wild shoots from forraging! Mint tips you guys!\"\n\n-Hailbut with Asparagus, Lettuce, Meyer Lemon, Brown Butter Hollandaise: Nikki Notes \"Bergamot mmmmm...especially with the wine. Totally changes the flavors.\"\n\n-Rabbit with Snails, Stinging Nettles, Green Garlic: No notes on this one, I was in heaven.\n\n-Lamb with Date, Mustards, Farro, Blood Orange, Olive, Garum: I don't eat lamb and we had notified them of this earlier so I had a crazy delicious duck breast while everyone else had lamb. I totally won this round because while the rest of my party was way too full, the duck breast was on the lighter side and I had plenty of room for dessert. ;)\n\n-Rhubarb with Chamomile, Pink Peppercorn, Tarragon: Nikki Notes \"Killer pallet cleanser after the duck/lamb. Why is rhubarb the best?\"\n\n-Oats with lavender, honey, almond\n\n-Treats: Nikki Notes \"I ate all these.\"", "author": "Nikki M."}

I loved both, but have pix  from the second visit, due to user error, a phone, and alcohol.  Also, I went to the first seating, both times. I love that you can go upstairs after, but am far too hungry to eat as late as the 2nd seating.  So, I have no comparison on one seating time vs. the other.\n\nFrom the chef's story, through the fun concept, through communal eating, through the top chef-style \"presentation\" of the food, I love love love the experience here. If you do not enjoy tasting new foods, or new flavors, this is not the right place for you.  For example, not sure what \"freshly foraged nettles\" are, and not interested in trying them? Stay home! If soup-like whipped scrambled eggs, with a touch of hot sauce of some sort at the bottom grosses you out, you will not like your experience.\n\nI'm a sucker for all things passion-based. I could likely enjoy root canal if the dentist was as into his craft as each of the chefs at Lazy Bear was. So, I know I am biased there. But, when you actually want to lick the plate clean on just the bread course, what can be bad?\n\nOn both trips, the desserts really stood out, and not just because of the pastry chef's hilarious personality. I'm not a \"sicky sweet\" woman, so things like an olive oil creamsicle, hit just the right notes for me. Desserts can be fairly one-dimensional elsewhere, but like all the courses at Lazy Bear -- each bite has a multitude of  layers and flavors.\n\nOddly, I'd return again. Why, \"oddly\"? Because I think part of the fun is the \"surprise\" of it all. Yet, I enjoyed the 2nd time as much -- if not more -- and for different reasons, than the 1st visit.

After starting you off on hor d'oeuvres and cocktails upstairs, they sit you down on communal tables (be prepared to socialize with strangers) with an open kitchen.  The staff are quick, accommodating, and more importantly, engaging.  In fact, there is no boundary between the dining room and the kitchen and they encourage people to chat with the chefs as they are plating and ask questions.  One of my friends asked jokingly if he could taste one of the desserts again and they actually whipped up a second serving of that course just for him!  The waitstaff always make sure your water / wine glass/ cocktail glass is full and that the customer is satisfied.  \n\nThe chefs explain the dishes as they are served to the diners and make suggestions on how to eat them when necessary.  They even include a booklet of the menu to allow the diners to take notes on the food as you go along (I won't lie; I ended up getting so excited that my booklet is now heavily annotated).  \nYou can tell that the chefs have put a lot of thought into each dish- from the different textures to add mouth-feel to a dish to adding sour green apples to counter creamy cheese, every dish was well composed and executed.\n\nThey change the menu daily, but the menu we got was the following:\n// (Snack) Whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple, and hot sauce -- Sturgeon toast with caviar and cauliflower on pumpernickel -- Shigoku oyster with winter citrus creme and chili -- Crispy maitake mushroom with creme fraiche 'n' allium dip (their take on Sour Creme and Onion)\n// Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll- they have special cultured butter that tastes more like cheese from age; I ate most of it even though I hate butter.  You can ask for more rolls.\n// Steelhead Trout, roe, hedgehog mushrooms, barley and chicken skin, and greens\n// Scallop with kohlrabi, niitaka pear, walnut\n// Celtuce, almond, nettle, duck confit\n// Sunchoke fondue with Lisa's Cheese, black trumpet mushrooms and green apple\n// 8-10 Day Dry Aged Duck with yams, maple, gremolada, and black kale\n// Wagyu Ribeye with spring onion and brussel sprouts\n// Olive Oil Creamsicle, oro blanco, and preserved citrus\n// Parsnip cream, coffee sable, pate a choux\n// (Treats) White chocolate candy cap bar with salted caramel -- Blood Orange + Ginger Pate de Fruit -- Pumpkin Seed, Almond, and Raisin Nougat\n\nSome tips:\n1) Make sure you note any allergies ahead of time- I had forgotten to ask my guests on allergies and so we showed up and one guest is allergic to seafood (which was 1/3 of the dishes).  Luckily and thankfully, the chefs were able to whip up alternatives but I'd hate to see someone be unlucky\n2) Come with people who are adventurous with food- the whole point is that you try new things and learn to appreciate it; the chef won't made modifications just because you don't like an ingredient (unless it's because of an allergy)\n3) Come when you are in a sociable mood- with the cocktails/ hor d'oeuvres period and communal tables, Lazy Bear recommends that you mingle with the other parties (and even include a section in the booklet to write down contact information for new friends) \n\nIf you are looking for a dinner experience that you've never EVER had in your life, Lazy Bear should be included at top of your wishlist.", "author": "Audrey H."}

Ok, that's out of the way...\n\nHere's what I love dearly about Lazy Bear...the format. I loved being greeted and whisked upstairs to the mezzanine where to my surprise, we would be starting the meal with their \"snacks\". It's a comfy area and fun to wait in anticipation of what's coming next. The earlier seating is just finishing up so, upon entering and seeing the communal tables full of smiles and satisfied diners makes you want to start eating ASAP. \n\nAlongside a pretty solid cocktail program/list we were treated to the following \"snacks\": (I'll highlight a few): Whipped scrambled eggs - served in a shotglass and more like a foam but, the bacon notes were a nice surprise. Caviar with smoked leek custard and seaweed - I mean, it's caviar. Crispy pole beans - had a really nice creme fraiche dip that reminded me of really fancy ranch (which I normally hate with a passion). \n\nOk, onto the second part of the meal... but first, I'll paint the picture of this part of the dining experience. There are 40 seats downstairs and two very long communal tables. It's set \"in the kitchen\" and you're encouraged to hop out of your seat, ask questions and see what's going on with the kitchen staff. Pretty cool if you ask me. \n\n1st Course: Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll with Cultured Butter - that butter was bomb, so lather it on like crazy. Don't be shy. \n2nd Course: Beef Tartare with Tomato and Seaweeds - well executed but, fell a little flat for me.\n3rd Course: Monterey Abalone with Arrowhead Cabbage, Legumes, and Mint - probably my favorite dish of the evening. Done with a light hand and fantastically flavored. \n4th Course: Summer Squash with Shelling Beans, Mussels and Edible Flowers - a wonderful dish for the end of the summer season.\n5th Course: Aged Squab with Huckleberry, Chanterelle Mushrooms and Sumac - Beautiful presentation and the mushrooms...unreal. \n6th Course: Grilled Lamb with Strawberry and Pine Nut - Easily the best piece of lamb I've had in my life. Seriously. \n7th Course: Cucumber with Lemon Verbena and Oats - sweet and fresh.\n8th Course: Concord Grape Dessert with Grape Nuts and Chocolate Shavings - brought me back to my childhood with the grapenut thing. \n\nSide note: I brought 4 bottles of wine with me (there were four of us) to cover all spectrums of the meal. Corkage was a bit pricey but, it was worth having an arsenal of vino by my side. \n\nAll in all, it's a dining experience that shouldn't be taken lightly. Worth the price tag? Maybe not so much but, definitely worth the one star it's received from Michelin. Ok, that's enough for now, see you next time Lazy Bear, I'll be back.", "author": "Benjamin F."}

The communal aspect of the dinner was our favorite part, getting to chat and get to know a fun group of fellow foodies certainly enhanced our experience.

The price is pretty high too, but well worth the cost. Every dish is made with a lot of attention and care. Before the start of each course, the chef who made it will address the entire restaurant and explain what the dish is, how it was made, why it was made a certain way, and the flavors to look out for. You also get a little notebook to record down your \"notes\" for each dish--pretty neat.\n\nThe food quality is, suffice to say, amazing. The raw slice beef was simply heaven. True genius. The desert at the end was also very memorable--the sweetness was just perfect. Each dish seems to give rise to new taste and flavors I've never tasted before. Each dish has a different and special taste. I felt like a kid in a candy store, tasting a bit each and every totally different and new styles of candy.\n\nAlso, be sure to get the wine pairing. You can share it with more than one person. Definitely worth it.\n\nDefinitely go there at least once. That is, if you can get a reservation!", "author": "Henry L."}

We watched as diners finished their meal on the two long communal tables below. As we were waiting, the staff came around with drinks and snacks (goat cheese cheesecake?!). \n\nWhen our seating was ready, we were brought downstairs where they had a little notebook/menu ready with a small pencil. Its like you were in the woods and taking notes! We were encouraged to talk to our neighbors and visit their open kitchen. Service was superb and well worth the 5 stars. You notice how everything is perfectly timed and how they even put the forks down at the same time. \n\nBefore each dish was brought out the chef would stand in the middle to introduce himself, the dish, and where the ingredients were from as well as the inspiration for the dish.

They sell out fast, so I had to literally wait by the second for their tickets to be available one noon time a month prior to my intended dining date. I signed up on their newsletter so I would be kept on the loop about when tickets will be available.\n\nThe dining experience: The first five snacks are served up in a mezzanine where guests can mingle and meet the other guests. As for us, we stayed busy chatting within our own party of trio. They have a full bar and we were happy with our order of cocktails and wine. One of us ordered a pairing of wine for the entire dinner, priced at $85, which is not bad vis-a-vis ordering by the glass, and not to mention they allow sharing of this pairing! \n\nWhile enjoying the snacks, you also get to see the diners downstairs and the chefs preparing each course.  After about 30 minutes, each party will be escorted downstairs and will be seated according to a pre-arranged seatings. \n\nYou will then be encouraged to introduce yourself to the other parties sharing the same long table with you. There are two ten-topper tables within the restaurant so while it is communal, it is pretty intimate. This makes this dinner interesting and special.\n\nWhile each course is served, a chef would walk in front and provide a description of the meal. Diners are also welcome to walk to the chef's tables and converse with them and ask just about anything. It's awesome!\n\nThe food: Each course for me was A-ok but not spectacular. That evening, there were about three courses which are on the higher level of saltiness. What stood out for me as great courses were the (1) duck liver mousse - can't go wrong with the foie gras I guess and the (2) Persimmon.

I'm not one for terrible reviews but I honestly can't believe that everyone else is raving about this place. My BF and I went for our anniversary dinner and it was SO underwhelming and disappointing, even before factoring in that you spend almost $200 per person without drinks (once you think about that, it is just sad). Maybe it's just that people feel cheated if they leave thinking it was less than amazing.\n\nThe service seemed super unpolished to me. I was seated on the far end of the table, with plenty of room between me and the wall, but I had my chair bumped into all night by servers trying to cut the corner, with only one apology. Though most servers were friendly, there was definitely an out-of-place snooty vibe. The ambiance is just weird tbh--it seems like it should be welcoming and homey with the bear/woodsy theme, but then the dinner is treated with this air of exclusivity that just doesn't fit. I just don't get it. \n\nThe upstairs portion where you have drinks and snacks before being seated is way too crowded and uncomfortable for the length of time they expect people to be up there waiting. \n\nThe food just fell flat and definitely was not worth the price paid. It doesn't help that they charge the same for a vegetarian menu as for the regular menu. In place of the lamb lollipop dish, I got three cauliflower florets. Instead of caviar, you get a piece of a leek. Excuse me, but you have some balls to do that! Either charge $20-30 less for the vegetarian experience or provide something that is not worth less than $1 in the real world. Some nice mushrooms maybe or a more unique vegetable ... but cauliflower? I will readily admit that it just really pissed me off. \n\nBesides the value, my other gripe is the aroma of the dishes was way better than the actual taste. You would smell it when it arrived and think it was going to be amazing, only to be let down by the actual taste. The only real inventiveness that I saw in flavor was in the desserts. And for what should be peak summer veggie season, I can't imagine what it'd be like during other seasons.\n\nMy BF was also disappointed. He said the regular version of the dishes were hit-and-miss. He loved the potato and the lamb dishes, but also found himself underwhelmed by the rest of the courses. Some lacked cohesion, others lacked flavor. For an 11 or 12 course meal, that's just kind of sad. It's clear the chefs are passionate about their craft, but I think they need to take a step back. Few people seemed to be really gushing about the food, and were just kind of eating their way through the courses. To me, you want people to be talking about the food, not just eating and moving onto the next course like they are eating something normal. I would say spend your hard-earned money elsewhere; there are so many better options in the city.", "author": "Cara R."}

Here are the reasons:\n\nFirst reason: Mistake on booking\n\n I purchased a dinner package for 2 a few days before 2/14 as my wife and I wanted to celebrate.  However a day after I purchased the dinner packages, and I got a call from Lazy Bear that they have made a mistake on their calendar.  The day I have chosen was not supposed to be open, and lazy bear need to change our days.  After some talking with the reservation lady Ana, she agreed to put us on 2/14 dinners at 8:30pm, and she waived the price difference. A big plus on their side for remedied a problem. \n\nSecond reason: Mistake on execution\n\n Our dinner was supposed to start at 8:30pm; it did not start until 9:15pm.  We have to go by 11pm, as we have a one-year-old baby at home, and it is 40min drive from the restaurant to the house.  At 11pm, we were only half way on our total courses. The chef/owner came out, and apologies to us for all the delay due to scheduling, also promised letting us to come back to finish our meal. \n\nThird reason: Mistake on following-up\n\n I called Lazy Bear on Wednesday to reconfirm everything, and Ana remembers me, I explained to her what the chef has said the night before, and would like to see what do they would like to do.  Ana told me she would have the GM call me back, and arrange everything.  Today is 2/21, 6 days after I spoke with Ana, and No one has called me.\n\nIf Lazy Bear is not a Michelin 2 star restaurant, these kinds of mistakes I might not even waste my time.

First, every single dish was absolutely beautiful to behold. Taste-wise, my favorites were the whipped scrambled eggs, fried mushrooms and delightful allium dip, and the abalone (who knew abalones had livers!?).  Disappointingly, some dishes were extremely salty, particularly the smoked salmon and the squab. Strangely, however, the halibut was flavorless (I think because of the way it was cooked?). I know that restaurants at this level (and price) need to take risks, and sometimes they don't all pan out, but I was a bit surprised by the number of misses. As for drinks, I had a Michael Corleone cocktail (like an old fashioned) that was just fabulous. We ordered a couple wines by the glass and they were okay. A few of our dining neighbors ordered the wine pairing, and seemed to like it enough (note that we apparently ate on a night with a lot of seafood, so most of the pairings were white wine).\n\nAmbiance - 4.5 stars. Warm and quirky. I loved the old timey California decor, the cool twiggy ceiling sculpture and the bathroom artwork. Being able to watch the diners from the first seating from the lounge area was pretty cool too.\n\nService - 5 stars. Really excellent and friendly service. Every single one of the servers was wonderful and I can see that they are what elevates this to a 2 star Michelin experience.\n\nPretentiousness - 12 stars. So, I get it, the food is really complicated to make and everything, but every dish's process and ingredients had to be described down to the smallest detail. Like, I don't think I'm exaggerating to say that an aggregate of 30 minutes of this meal was spent listening to them describe the dishes. After multiple courses of this, I started tuning them out (sorry!). The wines on the wine list were repeatedly described as \"esoteric\" and honestly I think quality of the wines we had was below what I would have expected for that price. Also, the faux-cocktail party during the appetizer course at the start was just bizarre. We were seated back to back on an ottoman with another couple, so it was rather uncomfortable to sit for such a long period of time (45 minutes). I also didn't see anyone actually interact with anyone not in their own group during this time, so it felt like we were acting out roles in a play. Memorable, but not really in a good way (and not something I would choose to pay for again). The communal dining part was fine, as our dining neighbors were all very nice and friendly, but I am an introvert and it was actually tiring for me to sit so long with strangers. \n\nBottom line, for the price, I don't think the food or experience lived up to the hype for me.", "author": "Nora G."}

Tasted like something you'd eat at a superbowl party.  Still delicious nonetheless but really didn't offer much continuity with regards to the other dishes.  \n\nYou are then asked to join in the main dining room for the entrees.\n\nGrilled Seaweed Foccacia with House Made Cultured Butter:  A++\nA simple dish, but incredibly well executed.  At the bottom of it, it was just a piece of bread.  However, the kombu flavors were incredibly apparent and the cultured butter was good enough to eat with a spoon.  Execution was absolutely spot on.   \n\nSweet Pea Custard with Steelhead Roe, Pea Shell Mint Sauce, Spring Onion:  A\nRefreshing way to start the meal.  Enough funk from the steelhead roe.  The greens offered great texture and the sweet pea custard was delicious.  \n\nBroth of Toasted Grains with Egg Yolk Fudge, Porcini, Baby Leaks:  A+++\nThe egg yolk fudge was amazing.  An isolated yolk that was barely cooked.  Covered in a hearty broth, which brought the dish to slightly above room temp.  If you like poached eggs, you'll definitely get a kick out of this dish.  Another highlight of the night.  \n\nHalibut with Lettuce, Asparagus, Brown Butter Hollandaise:  A-\nHalibut was cooked perfectly.  Execution was great, but not as innovative as any of the other courses.  \n\nRabbit with Morels and Favas:  B+\nRabbit was sous-vide style but was overseasoned.\n\nLamb Rack with Date, Mustards, Farro, Blood Orange, Olive, Garum:  A+++\nAnother highlight of the night.  The lamb had an incredible amount of fat, and wasn't particularly gamy.  The blood orange and mustards really helped balance the pungent lamb.  Cooked to a perfet medium rare.  \n\nRhubarb with Chamomile, Pink Peppercorn:  A+\nThis was magic.  I lifted the bowl so I could drink the bottom.  It was that good.  \n\nOats with Lavendar, Honey, Almond:  A++\nPerfect way to end.  Not overly sweet.  Perfect in execution again.\n\nMenu was complex, but I left completely satisfied.  The execution was perfect, and the chef interaction left no questions unanswered and no rocks unturned.  The price was just right considering the precision of the staff and the innovative experience overall.  I'll definitely be back.", "author": "David C."}

I was there in September of 2017 and the only thing I remember particularly was a complimentary drink offered prior to the meal it was exceptional .... some kind of citrus basil mixture but you could not purchase an additional glass ... they made enough for the number of guests scheduled for dinner and that's it.

Such an innovative fun dining experience. \n\nYes, you have the first 4 courses upstairs in the cozy cabin-esque decorated lounge/living room with leather couches and small tables. Yes, you will be amazed by everything they serve you upstairs and then they will escort you to your seat downstairs at one of the two communal tables. \n\nEvery dish was mindblowing and I truly enjoyed every course. So much so that I ate slowly which usually doesn't happen. I took the time to observe and smell what I was eating. Delicious!!!! From start to finish each dish was impressive and loved that each chef would describe a dish and what we were eating, flavors, inspiration etc. all desserts were fabulous - go maya!!\n\nI loved all of the unique qualities of the dining experience but will say that the diners next to us weren't interested in mingling despite my efforts of being friendly. To be honest I don't think I saw many people mingling with their fellow diners outside of their own party. Also, as much as the chef encourages you to go up and talk with the chefs/ask questions and take photos I don't think most people felt welcomed to do so. My friends went up twice and felt resistance from the chefs (granted they were busy cooking for us! But you guys offered!!) and generally felt they were not well received. Not sure if they need to find a better way to support this part of the meal if they truly want it to happen?\n\nFood and experience 5 stars. Just room improvement for them to truly execute the communal feel but that's also something that should be organic. There were a few service hiccups as well but didn't bother me enough to sing them - well deserved 5 stars!!", "author": "Melody T."}

In the Bay Area you have a lot of great best-in-class places to eat - The French Laundry, Benu, Saison, Quince, just to name the obvious comparisons you're familiar with - but none of them offer the unique experience that Lazy Bear does.\n\nPlenty of reviews cover the tickets, upstairs-to-downstairs progression, and communal seating so I won't touch on those other than to say that all of them are crucial components in the dining experience at Lazy Bear feel simultaneously like an event and dinner in some ultra comfy rustic setting; I love being with my friends here and meeting new people in the upstairs lounge.\n\nEvery meal I've had here has been top tier and not one of the dishes wasn't at least pretty good. Some highlights: sweet peas with morel mushrooms and \"fudge-y egg yolk\" is to die for, lamb has always been very flavorful, and the caviar inside of the potato with sour cream is one of my favorite bites ever. Of course one would be remiss if the opening bite of whipped eggs with maple syrup didn't get mentioned at least once during the review - it's like a perfect comfort food breakfast distilled down into a single bite.\n\nIf you're looking to try a contemporary SF fine dining institution, you'd be hard pressed to find a better candidate than Lazy Bear.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-24", "description": "What an experience!!! I recommend Lazy Bear at least once in your lifetime and here's why:\n\nIt is unlike any culinary experience I've ever had - the setting is relaxed and casual, most food is excellent -I say most because not everything will be tailored to your liking and preferences due to a prix fixe menu- and well explained, and you're encouraged to interact with the staff and your fellow attendees as much as you like. \n\nThe bf and I arrived around 8pm, despite our long arduous experience trying to find parking -we ended up parking at the structure on 21st. We were ushered upstairs and there were a couple parties there already. We snagged a cozy little nook right by the glass railing that looked down on the 1st floor. I liked that we had some time up there just to people watch and take in the cabin feel of the second floor. Definitely a conversation starter! Space was a little tight after all the parties arrived. We ordered the Pomegranate Daiquiri and the BF got a stout. Both were pretty strong!   \n\nI won't say too much about the food as it may change slightly every day and the menu will differ every month, but I really enjoyed everything I ate. We tried a multitude of things we would have never thought to order and everything was perfectly cooked. I loved the little booklets that they provide for you to do with as you please. I constantly referenced mine for the ingredients. We looooved the dessert courses. They were all really interesting and definitely not traditional, which we enjoyed. We also really loved their coffee program. I believe they were serving Verve (Santa Cruz) at that time. \n\nThere was a lot of lovely detail that went into the plating of the food and much time, effort and thought on the part of the chefs in choosing the exact ingredients. When they spoke about the dishes you could see the passion they had in what they do. It was also a treat when the owner, David Barzelay, and lawyer turned chef, came out to mingle with us. It was awesome! Highly recommended!", "author": "Dorothy L."}

We have been to a few Michelin star restaurants. I would say this is more like a strong one star restaurant, definitely not two stars. \n\nExperience: The dinner party atmosphere probably work better for younger people, didn't really work my husband and myself. I was sitting on a chair that I shared with several other people behind me while tasting the appetizer upstairs, was not exactly comfortable. At the communal dinning table, we were sitting across from each other, most of the time it was too noisy to have a private conversation, it is easier to talk to the person right next to you. Fortunately the couple sitting next to us are fun to talk to. It is not a place to have a romantic dinner for a special occasion. It is more like a place to go with friends. \n\nFood: I feel the food lack the complexity of a Michelin 2-star restaurant. The scallops and the oysters were great, but they were served raw with a vinaigrette, not exactly a show case of cooking skills. The steelhead trout was memorable. The duck was a little under-cooked, there were part that I could not cut through with a sharp knife. As some reviewers mentioned, some dishes are salty. Desserts were below my expectation for sure. The portion are small, we were in the first seating, finished before 8:30pm. I could eat again by 10pm. \n\nService: During the meal, I was trying to get more bread, had to ask three people before I actually got them. The first person forgot. The second person brought the bread, but forgot who asked for them, gave the bread to a different person as I was waving at her trying to get her attention. The third person finally gave me the bread. The service was otherwise good. \nAgain, not something I expected at a Michelin 2-star restaurant. \n\nOverall: It's only ok for the price and the hype. I remember eating at Manresa and Quince when they had only 2 stars, feeling completely satisfied when I walked out of the restaurants. Not here. It may be ok to experience this once. I don't think I will come back or recommend this place to any one.", "author": "Eva L."}

At the time you can also choose your beverage package. You don't have to as you can add it when you arrive or choose to get individual drinks.\n\nThere are two seatings a night.

From the locally foraged ingredients, to the borderline obsessive preparation of ingredients, LB creates a great experience that just happens to include food. I really appreciated the choices made by David Barzelay - they were all on point. They served delicious yet not overused or trendy proteins such as Abalone, Squab, Geoduck, CA Pacific spotted shrimp, and Lamb. They also make their own butter in-house along with insanely delicious bread rolls.\n\nThe only two minor negatives were that we were left unserved upstairs for long stretches of time during the cocktail/small bites portion of the meal. I would have ordered a few drinks but no one took our order. The room was busy with people arriving and being seated, mingling, and food being rapidly delivered. Someone was bound to pull the short straw in that setup and that unfortunately was us. The other short lived negative was when one of the servers shattered a wine glass on the table near us during dinner service.

Even though I was sad to see the pop up go (and even sadder to see the free corkage go), I knew I had a chance once they opened up their brick and mortar. Finally on Thursday, November 20th, I got to try Lazy Bear!\n\nTickets run $120 per person plus tax and a mandatory 20% tip. I actually don't mind the ticketing system. It's less of a shock when your bill is split into the food and then the drinks later. You just have to commit since tickets are not refundable.\n\nThe evening started upstairs in their loft area with drinks and snacks. I decided to start the night with the Walnut manhattan: whiskey, nardini amaro, house nocino, bitters ($9). A nice dark boozy drink for a cold rainy evening. They were also serving an alcoholic punch upstairs with gin and some other ingredients I can't remember. This cocktail was free and very light.\n\nSnacks:\n*Whipped scrambled eggs: bacon, maple, hot sauce\n*Shigoku oyster: granny smith gelee, dill oil, dashi\n*Duck liver mousse: concord grape, toast, walnut\n*Blue cheese custard: carrot ham\n\nThe snacks were great! I loved all of them. The whipped eggs were light, fluffy and had a nice kick. The oyster went well with the tart apple. The duck liver mousse and blue cheese custard were both creamy and full of flavor. So good!\n\nTasting menu:\n*Dutch crunch pain epi: cultured butter\n*Bay scallops: mandarin yogurt, juniper, chicories\n*Dungeness crab: persimmon, chesnut, brussels sprouts, brown butter\n*Matsutake: douglas fir, scallion, kohlrabi\n*Grilled pork: jowl and loin, frilly red mustard, asian pear, squash, pepitas\n*Duck: cabbages, cracklins, barley, buckwheat, chanterelles, duck jus\n*Avocado: raw and candied citrus, yuzu buttermilk\n*Parsnip: coffee, cocoa, egg yolk\n*Treats\n\nI didn't enjoy the tasting menu as much as the snacks. The bread was an okay first course, but I normally don't eat a lot of bread at dinner. The highlight of the menu were the two seafood courses. I loved the scallops and crab. The scallops were fresh and the mandarins offered a nice contrast. The crab was probably my fav. Tender and sweet. My least favorite dish was the matsutake. It smelled wonderful when it came out, but had too much of an earthy flavor to it. I didn't care for that dish. The rest were good, but nothing really compared to the deliciousness of the snacks.\n\nWine pairing ($65):\n*Loureiro, quinta do ameal, vinho verde, Portugal 2012\n*Chenin blanc, chappellet, napa valley, California 2013\n*Pinot noir, robert sinskey, los carneros, napa valley, California 2011\n*Grenache: miner family, hudson vineyard, napa valley, California 2012\n*Moscato d'asti docg, vignaioli di s stefano, effervescent, 2013\n*Porto, taylor's, 20 year old, tawny\n\nI decided to partake in the wine pairing. All wines went well with the courses. Basically every 1-2 dishes were paired with a different wine. My gf didn't do the wine pairing so she ended up getting the Cabernet sauvignon, neyers, conn valley, napa valley, California 2010 ($20 glass).\n\nI also got a Buttermilk flip: henry mckenna bourbon, house buttermilk, farm egg, maple. Guessing this was an accident, but I can't say no to free booze! To end the meal, I ordered a Double espresso. Not sure if espresso is included, but I wasn't charged for it.\n\nThey give you cute little books stating all the snacks and courses which I loved. Great little souvenir to bring home. I'm honestly not a huge fan of communal seating, but the couples we sat next to were nice and fun. I don't know if the brick and mortar takes away from the pop up feel of Lazy Bear.

After an hour or so or when everyone from the first seating left, they accompanied us down to the communal tables. At the tables we are given booklets and pencils---great idea! to write down notes of what we thought about the dishes. When each dish was served a chef would introduce and describe the dish. Everyone was welcomed to go to the open kitchen and ask questions, take pictures, talk to them, or observe them in action. \n\nOur second time was about a month later and the awe of \"different\" dining experience already happened and we expected everything which ruined some of the experience for us.

The other unique thing about this place was they presented the meals to everyone at all once and let people come up to watch them make it as well. The downside was the price (really expensive) and only about half of the meals were amazing.", "author": "Nick Y."}

Couple things to know about LB, they do not accept traditional reservations, instead you set up an account through their website and you purchase tickets for a specific date and time based on availability. Tickets cost $175 per which includes gratuity. Wine pairing and drinks are extra. Once you have paid for your ticket(s), you cannot change the date. You can sell your tickets but the date is yours!!! Lastly, the dining experience is casual and communal seating for most of the meal.\n\nThey recommend you arrive 20 minutes before your reservation. When you arrive the hostess takes you upstairs to a lounge area. The 'snack' portion of your meal is held upstairs in the cozy yet homey lounge and seating is limited so that's why it's important to get there 20 minutes beforehand. The lounge area overlooks the main dining area.\n\nWhen the snack portion has concluded, a host/hostess will lead you downstairs to the main dining area. The host/hostess will seat you at your assigned seat at the communal dining table. A different chef will explain to the diners each course beforehand. Diners are encouraged to stop by the open kitchen, take pictures and engage with the chefs. \n\nAs for the food, it's a gastronomic experience. Lazy Bear brings farm to table to a new level and they try and source local ingredients. The techniques used is remarkable! Their play on scrambled eggs is mind blowing, how they were able to infuse so much complex flavor?!  I can go on and describe each course but I won't. You have to experience Lazy Bear for yourself. Treat yourself, you won't be disappointed!!\n\nThe service is impeccable, the ambiance casual but yet sophisticated. Lazy Bear deserves their star and I can see why they are so deserving.\n\nI will be back!!!", "author": "Scott L."}

During a game of softball, I hit someone in the balls after batting. No biggie... it was only the pastor's grandson. Same thing happened in a game of dodgeball. Ok, not going to lie, I wouldn't pick me either!\n\nI've been trying to dine at Lazy Bear (formerly an underground pop-up) for nearly 3 years. The lottery system they employed reminded me of grade school P.E. class except I was never picked. When I read they would be opening their brick & mortar and using a ticketing system instead, I said to myself, \"I got this!\" Well, so did thousands of other people which caused 6 servers to crash on their first day of ticket sales. After some perseverance, I finally got tickets for their grand opening day! Getting reservations for French Laundry and 3 reservations for State Bird Provisions was easier than this!\n\nSO was it worth it? We'll get to that later.\n\nLazy Bear took over the short-lived Hi-Lo BBQ. Currently, the tasting menu (changes seasonally) is $120 pp plus tax and 20% mandatory gratuity. Cocktail pairings are $50. There's also an a la carte beverage menu. There are two seatings: 6 pm and 8:15 pm, Thursday - Monday. Tickets are transferable but not refundable. \n\n~  * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\nS N A C K S: http://bit.ly/1vnKL32\n*Whipped Scrambled Eggs w/ bacon, maple, hot sauce\n*Plum Brulee w/ chicken liver mousse\n*Sweet Corn Custard w/ caviar \n*Oyster in Tomato Water Gelee, fennel pollen, tomato\n*Charred Tomatillo w/ beef jerky, cream fraiche\n \nThe snacks were absolutely spectacular, incredibly creative, and well executed. I'm not a breakfast person but I can live off the fluffy whipped eggs for the rest of my life. Sinfully rich chicken liver mousse? I'll take the whole platter please! Sweet corn custard, marry me! I think you get the point by now.\n\nT A S T I N G  M E N U\n(1) Molasses Bread w/ cultured butter, buttermilk: http://bit.ly/1DE42C5\n(2) Grilled Lettuce Soup w/ little gems, fried anchovy: http://bit.ly/1utN7iV\n(3) Delta Crawfsh w/ gold rice grits, shellfish, purslane: http://bit.ly/ZZmkOB\n(4) Guinea Hen w/ lobster mushroom, fines herbes: http://bit.ly/1uNgZmx\n(5) Seared Sungolds w/ smoked beef striploin, amaranth, tomato raisins: http://bit.ly/1uNhGwg\n(6) Plums & Pluots w/ ginger curd, shiso, mint: http://bit.ly/1ph0BaB\n(7) Sourdough w/ scotch, pears, earl grey: http://bit.ly/1DE4OPv\n(8) Mignardise: http://bit.ly/1vm46AH\n\nAfter a strong start, I was slightly disappointed with the tasting menu. Don't get me wrong, it was good but there were some hits & misses. Bread as a course--huh? Loved the take on caesar salad with the grilled lettuce soup. Great combo of flavors and textures. Their fancy take on crawfish & grits would make Brenda (of Brenda's French Soul Food) cry. \n\nSimple is good but after being wow'd with the inventiveness of the snacks, the protein courses were a tad pedestrian. I wasn't keen on the guinea hen and the overwhelmingly salty mushrooms. While I enjoyed the smokiness of the beef loin, my cut was difficult to cut and a bit chewy. \n\nDesserts. Who knew plums and ginger would marry so well? It was a nice palate cleanser to the insanely delicious sourdough croutons (tasted like waffles), caramelized pears, a deliciously creamy ice cream. Texture whore approved. \n\nI didn't care for the mignardise. The pate de fruit, for example gave me duck lips. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nThe staff was welcoming, engaging, and attentive without being intrusive. You can tell how passionate Chef David and his team are. As a course was served, a chef would explain the dish to the entire party of 40. Then, the sexy French sommelier would explain the wine pairing. Totally deserving of the mandatory 20% gratuity. The staff, not the French accent. \n\nThe entire affair took 3 hours but at times, oddly felt rushed. \n\n~ * ~ A M B I AN C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nTruly unique, a Lazy Bear dinner is like a large private dinner...with strangers. Snacks were served in the upper mezzanine area transformed to a cozy, loungey living room. Love: http://bit.ly/1yufHTM\n\nNot a fan of the communal seating (2 tables of 20). For $150+ pp, it's not conducive to having an intimate, fine dining experience with your date. If the acoustics were better, I wouldn't mind so much but my gf and I had to forcefully compete with 20 other on-going conversations. Thankfully, other parties were cool and laidback. The lady next to me dropped the \"M\" bomb towards the end of dinner. Shiet, had I known they were going to be talking about masturbation, I would have told my gf about my recent body woes. Damn you, gravity. My tits are starting to point to my toes. \n\n~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~\nUber hard. Nearest garage is 2 blocks away on 21st and Bartlett. \n\nA one-of-a-kind experience albeit a tad overhyped, Lazy Bear is a must try...just once in your life. That's if you can get tickets. Now would be the time to make googly eyes with that techie across the way. *Wink Wink*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The food was quite good, the wine pairing was a disaster, the service was inconsistent, and the venue was lovely.\n\nThe passed appetizers served in the cozy, inviting upstairs living room were excellent.  We loved the whipped eggs.  The oyster was good, the brioche with duck pate was amazing, and the blue cheese with carrot was decent.  We also enjoyed the alcoholic hot punch - it was flavorful and perfect for a chilly fall evening.\n\nWe enjoyed most of the mains served in the downstairs dining room.  The bread with cultured butter was incredible - their homemade butter is delicious!  The truly standout dishes were the the sea scallops with sunflower parts and brown butter, grilled pork, and duck.  The rice pudding with huckleberry and matcha was another favorite, and the finale of sweet treats was awesome (especially the sesame ball and mini ice cream sandwich - like item).\n\nUnfortunately, we were quite disappointed in the beverage pairings.  First, they were not poured in a timely manner (more than once, I found myself waiting to eat because I was still waiting for the wine pairing...once, they even came by to take my half eaten plate before the wine pairing was even poured)!  Next, there was zero explanation about the wines, why they were chosen, etc.  Finally, the pours were quite small.  We felt we truly wasted $65 on each pairing - I'd suggest skipping it altogether.\n\nThe service was inconsistent - often good, sometimes bad.  We had to tell 3 different people we had ordered the wine pairing before our first pour arrived (and others had already been served).  Also, they offered me a substitute dish for one of the appetizers I couldn't eat, but never offered my fianc\u00e9 a substitute for the dish he couldn't eat (they definitely knew about both allergies).\n\nOverall, Lazy Bear is a good spot. I think they need to work on their process and service.  However, the food itself lived up to the hype, we're glad we got to experience it!", "author": "Barnali D."}

Officially the best dining experience I've ever had! \n\nMy bf and I made reservations here to celebrate his promotion and we somehow snagged the best seats at the end of the table right next to the kitchen! Worked out perfectly since we both aren't fans of communal dining so we only had people to one side of us. \n\nIt was such a warm and fun meal. There was absolutely nothing pretentious or stuffy about this place and everyone was dressed down in plaid shirts for the men and casual dresses for the women. My BF and I ended up loving the two guys who sat next to us. Pretty sure they were super geniuses and they always had funny comments! They had brought a bottle of fancy gin to make martini's with and ended up asking our waitress to make martini's for the whole table with the rest of their gin. WTF! This never happens. \n\nI'm not sure if its still BYOB but my bf had brought a bottle of white wine they kept chilled for us and constantly kept our glasses filled. I ended up getting plastered by the end of the meal with the complimentary welcome cocktail, bottle of white wine, crazy strong gin martini courtesy of our table neighbors AND they left half their bottle of fancy $100 wine so how was I not supposed to drink it?! I never let alcohol go to waste, especially not when its the most expensive wine I'll ever have! I didn't take a look at the drink menu since there was already so much alcohol flowing around but would love to see the cool concoctions they would've come up with.  \n\nIt was so much fun being able to see everything being prepared and everyone knows I love an open kitchen. Chef David is such a friendly and welcoming person. He told me I was the first person to ask for a photo with him at his new space! I'm usually terrified of getting kitchen tours or talking to chefs because god forbid I say or do the wrong thing! Food was solid and rivals Atelier Crenn for being my favorite restaurant of all time.

In order to get a table you have to sign up on their website.  You will be notified by email of when tickets will be on sale on their website.  I will log in 15 mins in advance just in case tickets are released ahead of noon.  I manged to snag a reservation right at 11:54 a.m.  You will need to pay in advance which makes it great because you don't have to worry about the check after being stuffed.  \n\nMy friend and i arrived at Lazy Bear right on time. We were escorted upstairs where they check us in and allowed us to lounge around with other patrons.   I love how it's a log cabin feeling because it makes me more relaxed.   The servers will go to each individuals with their silver platter and introduce you to the \"snacks\".  You can also help yourself to the spiked punch bowl to go along with your snacks. So let me go over the snacks really quick\n\nWhipped scrambled eggs- with bacon, maple and hot sauce- I love eggs, so i might be biased to this.  This is served warm, so you will need to start from the bottom and work your way to the top.  You can taste the smoked bacon mixed in with the lightly fluffed egg and hot sauce. i loved this dish\n\nShigoku oyster- a chilled dish, and you can taste how fresh the oyster was. \n\nDuck liver Mousse on a toast with grapes and walnuts-  when you eat this all your memories of your love for foie gras will come back to you.  It hurts so much for me to be reminded of such a good dish.. \n\nBlue cheese custard- with carrot and ham.  - ok i normally 99.9% of the time i hate blue cheese.  However, i liked how the blue cheese was not too overpowering. I surprisingly liked this \"snack\"\n\nAfter the snacks they will take each party down one by one to be seated.  Once you are seated Chef David will introduce himself to the crowd and you start off with bread and butter and other entrees\n\nDutch Crunch pain Epi- Bread and butter as i would like to call it. This was served with a sourdough bread and the softest lightest better you will ever taste. I'm not huge on sourdough but again, i ended up liking the bread.\n\nBay Scallops- I was surprised by how big the pieces were.  I liked how this was served with a sweet yogurt sauce\n\nSunflower Parts- this was a black cod with persimmons and cooked in brown butter. I never thought brown butter could taste this amazing. This was my favorite dish of the night.  The fish melts in your mouth and the persimmon was pureed .  I loved how fried the petals! I would come back just for this dish. \n\nMatsutake- this soup was on the lighter taste and it had a very strong mushroom taste.  We actually saw them make this soup, they boil it,in what looks like coffee makers. How cool is that?!\n\nGrilled Pork- I was disappointed with this dish. i didn't feel the pork was tender enough\n\nDuck- Another dish i was disappointed in, it was a little more tender than the pork.  I didn't feel this dish was anything too special. I did like the crispy cabbage it came with. \n\nAvocado ice cream with yuzu buttermilk- If you love avocado you will love this!  You can tell they made this, because it was so light!\n\nParsnip- Devil fruit cake. this was a little bit on to burnt side for me.\n\nTreats- earl grey macaron, sesame balls, this jelly thing, ice cream smores, and a pistachio tart.   I have the say the best treat was the earl grey macaron and the ice cream smore.   The sesame ball was very avg and a little bit on the hard side.  The other desserts were pretty avg.  \n\nOn a brighter note, the moscato was very smooth. I loved it\n\nThe service here was great, but parking here is a pain.

I was there with friends i love to talk to. When the chefs chime in to talk about the courses, it's intentionally disruptive. There are about 12 such interjections that stop your conversation.\n2. It was hard to hear my friends. The space would benefit from some noise cancelling system like Comal in Berkeley. \n3. The decor is the same as the previous BBQ place. Gorgeous, but don't expect a face lift. (color expert note: the light grey of the mountain mural is a shade off from the wall color and that drove me nuts).\n4. Extremely seamless service. . . I missed them taking flowers of the table and replacing with candles. I've never experienced that before. \n5. Don't make a joke that you'll only eat the roe if it came from the salmon it's paired with. Because it will be. #Portlandia\n6. I've been mildly nauseous since leaving 20 hours ago. I generally don't have any allergies, but there might be one thing out of the 120+ ingredients I had last night. \n\nMany thanks to my friend who brought my husband I there for an early birthday dinner!

But to say the least, it LIVED up to its hype and is now my favorite restaurant in the Bay Area.\n\nIt's a really interesting experience.  Like what others say, it is a like a big ole dinner party in a \"lodge\" like setting in the Mission, at times whimsical (the food), to kitschy (there's a picture of Tom Selleck in all his mustache glory in the upstairs room), to really warm/comforting (you feel completely welcomed).  I just loved everything about it from the delightful and well thought out menu to the service, to the company, and to the overall vibe.  Big shoutout to the chefs who would speak to each dish served with great insights on the food composition and its storytelling.\n\nHere's what was served.  \n\n* Various snacks (4):  whipped scrambled eggs (bacon, maple, hot sauce), green machine oyster (shiso, sorrel, wheatgrass), goat chese tart (beet, almond, meyer lemon), fried soft shell crab (green tomato, ramps, cilantro), caviar (smoked leek custard, seaweed) - these items were served upstairs while we were waiting for dinner to be set.  All very much delicious but my fave were the crab which was a large portion for two as well as the caviar which was perfect with the leek custard.  The oyster was fresh but I could have passed on the wheatgress...\n\n* The tasting menu (9):  spelt & rye dinner roll (made with a cultured butter that tasted half butter and half cheese, almost gruyere like), beef tartare (tomato, seaweeds), halibut (crawfish suace, summer squash), fresh corn grits (with australian truffle grated on top), guinea hen (fava bean, rice grits), bintje potato fondue (peas, morels and dusted with fines herbs), grilled lamb (cooked with stonefruit from their yard), green melon dessert (hemp seed custard and pistachio), peach cake dessert with milk chocolate.  \n\n* Treats:  dinner was finished off with an assortment of small treats such as coffee macaron, bee sting cake, and frozen PB&J (really tiny like petits fours) but nice ending to a fantastic meal.\n\n* Beverage Pairing:  I usually pass on the beverage pairing but a friend recommended that I add it on the the meal which was such a good idea (and you can share the pairing with another person).  \n\nI can't say enough about Lazy Bear, other than LOVE.  If you are into food and are willing to spend $, Lazy Bear should definitely be on your list.

However, I wish they gave you some carbs with the roe.\n-Concord Grape Soda (Lemon Verbena, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2PD4tmY-Ti3pL5OL4VCJhw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): This wasn't my cup of.. soda.

I also wasn't a fan of the spelt/rye roll, since it wasn't as fluffy as a traditional Parker House Roll.\n-Modorigatsuo (Pomegranate, Beets, Pink Peppercorn, Meyer Lemon, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=N4S2Y_PMhW7HTg9D4Lp0bA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok, not too much flavor.\n-Lamb Tartare (Sunflower and its Seeds, Pear, Sumac, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tzMWs96ibIBdeSEp_9JDxw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Not too gamey but again not too flavorful.

However, the \"cake\" was nice and moist, and the ice cream had a nice nutty flavor.\n\nTreats\n-From L to R: Semifreddo (Vietnamese Coffee), Sticky Toffee Pudding (Fig, Red Walnuts), Earl Grey Macaron (Scotch, Pear, Ginger) [http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4CWR6KjuE43Ipx3dj5kA7w&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg]: The semifreddo was by far the best dessert, and the pairing worked well together. I didn't like the flavors/ingredients in the other two.\n\nYou really have to be a fan of communal style seating to enjoy your experience. We didn't like that the chefs spend a lot of time explaining each dish, so your conversations are continually interrupted. Service is great though, and they have good music. However, I doubt I will be back since I wasn't a fan of the food (although the plating was beautiful), or the communal style dining.", "author": "Amy D."}

We arrived 20 mins late and we received all our amuse bouche back to back.  An aperitif and 4 first courses in 5 minutes is really hard to digest.  \n\nThey were all amazing.  \n\nThe bread and butter were also a tangy treat.  \n\nThe entrees on a whole were overly complicated, having conflicting flavors and the proteins were not executed with the precision expected.  Pastry department: wonderful.  Represented the seasons well, texturally interesting and soul satisfying.  Even the migardises were excellent, particularly the ice cream sandwich, pistachio cake and the macaron.  \n\nWine pairings were on point throughout the evening.  They even managed to sneak in a stout.  \n\nNot sure about the communal dining thing.  Too social for my taste.  But that's coming directly from an introverted only child.  \n\nTix system: fairly easy to navigate through.  Our neighbors purchased tix for face value through Craigslist the night before.  \n\nThere are some kinks to work out in regards to timing and just table service in general, but nothing egregious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-08", "description": "Located off 19th and Mission across the street from Hog & Rocks, this pre dining reservation only restaurant has drawn quite some buzz over the years and I figured it was about time to figure out what the hype was all about. I arrived at 8:05pm for my 8:15pm preset dinner seating and was escorted upstairs to the dimly lit second floor mezzanine cocktail lounge. It was located directly over the large communal dining room below where the first set of diners were finishing off their meal. Surprisingly, the  lounge was already packed to the gills with guests. Did I get the memo? Guess not. That being said, the only area left was a small stand alone circular wobbly bar table I shared with my dining guest. Note to self: come early next time, and I mean very early to nab a seat because you will be relegated to a very uncomfortable area for about 30 minutes or so if you are the unlucky folks that can't even land a bar stand. With that in mind, I got myself settled enough and leaned up against the window to enjoy my complimentary punch provided by the hostess. It was tart and refreshing and cleansed my palate nicely for the highly anticipated culinary journey ahead. The lounge area itself had a kitsch-y yet rustic cigar room feel to it adorned with charming mid century modern furniture set against eclectic art pieces and random collected chachkes. Music ran the gamut here, from 90's rap to ethereal indie music and oldies new wave playing in the background while the crowd of hipster diners chatted away. I must say that the environs upstairs can get a bit stifling once everyone arrives and you'll definitely need a drink or two to loosen up a bit. As the evening progressed, the staff provided us with a selection of bite sized tapas style dishes as we sipped on our cocktails and drinks. The dishes were quite delicious with a whimsical theme about them, which definitely helped to lighten the mood. Given the tight quarters we were set in, we ended up striking up some convo with our neighbors who've dined at lazy bear in the past. Given they were return guests, I had a good feeling about the evening. After a few more small plates, we were slowly escorted downstairs to the main dining area to prepare for our feast.  The dining area was set up with two large communal tables which could hold about 16 people each. At the table included a small notepad with pencils for diners to jot away notes as they took snapshots of their food. With a large vaulted ceiling overhead, the sound of over 30 people talking could get deafening. Luckily, the crowd was silenced for the presentation of the entree dishes, which each individual chef who prepared the dish would present to the diners. Each dish that arrived sequentially as the evening progressed was undoubtedly exquisite and inspiring. The flavor profiles were mouthwatering. Now, I won't get into the details of each dish since it will most certainly change but one thing is for sure, the Miyazaki Ribeye Steak was life changing! Did I mention I had the pleasure of enjoying this impeccable piece of premium beef twice? Oh yes, it was prepared two ways that evening and it was decadence personified. By the end of the evening, I was grinning from ear to ear. I was satiated, I was inspired and my tummy was happy. Despite the awkwardness of the lounge area earlier in the evening, I must admit it was long forgotten by the time I left. Now the real question is, Would I return, and the answer is a resounding yes!  \n\nUntil then...\n\nHappy Eats", "author": "Kent D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-16", "description": "My husband and I wanted to try something new. We heard of Lazy Bear through friends who highly recommended it. Come the day of our reservation, we were pretty much the first ones there. We were taken upstairs to enjoy cocktails and some appetizers. The mixed drinks were phenomenal considering its their own recipe and they use their own aged whiskey. While waiting to be seated on our table, my husband and I were debating whether or not we wanted to go with the wine pairings. We both decided and I must say I do not regret paying extra for it. \n\nSo we were brought to our table, which by the way is assigned seating. My husband sat in front of me and I sat beside new faces. It was pretty awkward at first but as the night unfolded we were socializing with them. We met a couple who were originally from Detroit and a mother-daughter from New York. It was nice to be able to share our foodie experience with them. We talked about the food, the drinks, and even talk about other places to try in the City. \n\nOk so the food, it was delicious. Each course was different and the Chefs were able to bring out all the flavors. My favorite dishes were the caviar, asparagus, oyster, and lamb dish. I really enjoyed the wines that were paired with the course as well. I remember noting 5-6 different wines in our list. \n\nOverall, the experience was truly one-of-a-kind and it was really fun being able to socialize and even make friends with other \"foodies.\" It was also clever to have a \"field guide\" and to be able to take notes and write down our thoughts about the 14 courses. I thought it was also very clever to be able to watch the chefs make our food and to be able to take photos of them and also take pictures with them. It was also nice to have the chef to give a little background about the dish and how it was made. \n\nI highly recommend Lazy Bear.", "author": "Franzene T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-05", "description": "What a dining experience. Truthfully, I knew very little about Lazy Bear before my friend and I made reservations/bought tickets, including how much it cost ($165/person). The price ups the bar on expectations, and the experience of Lazy Bear didn't disappoint. \n\nService was excellent and is what differentiates this restaurant from any other. The staff was unfailingly polite and helpful, and you're never left wanting (for anything) for long. Everything is exquisitely planned. You walk in and are immediately greeted and introduced to the concept of Lazy Bear - snacks upstairs, communal dining downstairs. My friend and I went upstairs and we were immediately offered rum punch - we assumed this was a hover around and wait kind of situation. Not at Lazy Bear, we were guided to a high table where we could enjoy our drink and where servers would pass by with various snacks. They keep a table map at the main hostess stand so they know where every party is standing or sitting and so that there are enough passed snacks - no trying to flag down servers. I could feel that every server knew what s/he was serving and cared a lot about the dining experience.\n\nIt doesn't really matter what dishes I liked because you won't have any choice since it's a prix fixe menu based on what's seasonal. As a general rule of thumb, I think it's best to be open to eating anything since you won't know what you're eating - the people standing by me did not eat uni or soft shell crab and therefore missed a couple of dishes. I'm not sure how they handle food allergies. \n\nMy favorite things to eat were some of the snacks such as the corn custard covered in lots of truffle shavings and the delicious soft shell crab tempura. I'm not a bread person, but this bread and the house-cultured butter was amazing. That butter tastes as close to cheese as you can imagine butter, and it has the most beautiful deep yellow color. My favorite and most interesting dish was the broth of toasted grains with egg yolk fudge. The egg yolk is suspended, almost custardized in the broth which was both light and rich. \n\nI do like that they give you a \"field guide\" with all of the menu items and a place for you to take notes. The kitchen is completely open and they encourage you to walk up, observe and ask questions. Overall, a lovely dining experience.", "author": "Wendy L."}

It was a very social and communal vibe and they encourage you to walk around and talk to the chefs and all your fellow guests. All the food was super nostalgic too, and I feel like they tried to take a lot of childhood memories but make it more upscale. Everyone was also super nice and very helpful.\n\nSo you start off upstairs where they check you in and serve you snacks and punch. \n-Whipped Scrambled Eggs - This was AMAZING - so light and airy but super flavorful!\n-Crab Toast - This was my least favorite - I thought the cheese was a little too strong, but they were very generous with the crab.\n-Shigoku Oyster - This was my fave of the snacks, but then again I'm biased towards oysters. The citrus foam on top went so well with the oyster. I was just sad that we only got to have one.\n-Crispy Maitake Mushroom - This one was also really good! I'm normally not a mushroom fan either, but they tasted so meaty and the dipping sauce reminded me of sour cream and onion.\n\nAfter they take you downstairs and you start with the main courses.They give you a little notebook and pencil so you can take notes and the chefs explain and introduce each dish and everyone eats together, which I loved.\n-Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll - Load up on the butter! You will not regret.\n-Sturgeon & Caviar - As much as I love caviar, this wasn't my fave. The butternut squash and leek sauce was really good though.\n-Abalone - This was kind of a miss for me sadly.\n-Sunchoke Fondue - This dish was the most beautiful one but was sadly my least favorite of the night.I thought there was a little too much cheese, but it did remind me of broccoli and cheddar. My neighbors said it tasted like pizza.\n-Egg yolk fudge with porcini mushroom broth - This was AMAZING and for sure my favorite dish. The egg yolk was almost like a custard and I could seriously drink that broth for days, and I don't really like mushrooms.\n-Aged duck - The sauce reminded me a lot of grape jelly and BBQ sauce.\n-Wagyu Ribeye - This was the most tender piece of beef I've ever had. You could cut it with a spoon and it just melted. \n-Olive oil dessert with olive oil curd, sponge, jam, pate de fruit, and powder\n-Yam - candied yams with marshmallows and ice cream - I do not like yams, but this was really good! Sadly I was stuffed at this point and it was a little too heavy at the time.\n\n\nThen they give you three little treats which I had to take home because I was about to explode, but it did make for the best breakfast.\n-Meyer Lemon Pate de Fruit\n-Applejack macaron - This tasted just like the cereal and brought back so many happy memories!\n-Gingerbread financier", "author": "Heather H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-21", "description": "Lazy bear was this hip new-ish spot when I went in April 2015 (sorry for the delay!). Fortunately, my friend scored tickets just as they were released and I was invited to join in on the fun along with Nina Y.. I think the ~$130/pp we paid seems a bit high but think of it as a dinner party experience and delicious food. We went on a Tuesday night for the first seating. We all work in the city and barted to that direction so it was pretty easy. Might be a challenge looking for parking though. \n\nPRELUDE: Front\n\nCheck in at the door. Give your name. Someone will escort you upstairs (and note: they won't forget your name)\n\nSCENE I: The upstairs gathering\n\nI recommend getting to the event early especially if you're the first seating. You definitely want to get some of the limited seating/table area upstairs if you want to be able to set plates/drinks down or, if you're a yelper like me, to get good lighting to take pictures as it is very dim. We were served five amuse bouches (Whipped Scrambled Eggs, King Salmon, Foie Gras, Firefly Squid Yakitori, Artichoke Dip). They were little interesting bites. I actually liked the whipped scrambled eggs a lot in their simplicity of ingredients but complexity of texture! Also, as I was allergic to cucumber (p.s. they are great about food allergies) they allowed me to substitute the punch of a glass of champagne.\n\nSCENE II: Downstairs\n\nCan my dining room look like this? It's very modern decor (Imagine somewhere Eames chairs would fit but with more warmth and character). Everyone had assigned seating which you don't have to find yourself (they bring you there). Our fellow diners were cheerful and we exchanged hellos (but no obligation here to make new friends). They provide you with a small notebook and pencil allowing you to jot down notes about your dishes as the chef describes it or as you eat it. Also between courses you are encouraged to get up, walk around, observe the chefs cooking/plating (from a distance), and even ask them questions! It's an open kitchen.\n\nList of Dishes (I'll just say everything is amazing and highlight any fun facts):  Valentine's bread, \nSweet Pea Custard (This had salmon roe, I mentally told myself it wouldn't work, but it did. This was a mouthful of Spring), Charred Onion Broth (Egg yolk and pork fat. The depth of flavor was soul warming). Halibut (One of the chefs gave us their brining ratio and preparation method with sous vide). Rabbit (Served with snails that they raised and had been fed only with basil -- how long does that even take? I swear I tasted the basil). Lamb (on the bone with the right amount of fat). Rhubarb (an icy sorbet). Oats financier (yum. It was served with granola that reminded me of campfires and coffee).  Final Treats (5 different classic pastry chef deserts like a macaron and cream puff). \n\nFINI\n\nFood: There's a story behind every dish. David Barzelay (Owner/Head Chef) is fun and not too polished. He also allows every one of his chefs to express their creativity and lead on a course (including providing a brief intro the dish). \n\nService: Very professional. Each one of their seatings is a carefully choreographed party. The servers were very attentive. The chefs and kitchen staff were fun and friendly. We even took a picture at the end (unknowingly with all the folks having a blast behind us -- I guess we were the serious ones?) \n\nOverall: If you can go, do it. I'm not sure if its worth the premium to have it on a weekend night (what are you doing for 2-3 hours on a weekday night anyway?) as they serve the same food throughout. Like I said, it's not just a meal. It's a dinner party, food story, and a memorable experience.", "author": "Tammy T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-02", "description": "I think many people would (and obviously do) love this place. For me, it's a mixed bag:\n\n(+) The concept is great: communal dining, almost like a fancy pop-up. Ambience and setting are excellent.\n(+) The emphases on food are up my alley: focus on local sourcing, vegetable and seafood-heavy, some molecular gastronomy, and Japanese influences.\n\n(-) The implementation is very uneven.\n\nDishes:\n-Daquiri punch: 4 *\n-Whipped scrambled eggs + bacon oil, maple syrup, hot sauce: 3.5 *\n-Aged beef tartare: 4 *\n-Fried squash blossom stuffed with fermented cheese: 4.5 *\n-Grassy bar oyster: 3.5 *\n-Melon soda with buttermilk: 3.5 *\n-Crispy maitake with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche allium dip: 5 * - so good; tastes like sour cream and onion chips, but with mushrooms.\n-Spelt & rye dinner roll + 5 year butter: 3.5 * - good implementation of dinner roll; the butter is good and different than normal butter, but not in an outstanding sense.\n-SF coast halibut + compressed plums and sour plum jam: 4 * - great texture on the halibut; didn't quite dig the compressed plums.\n-Sungold tomato, fresh shelling beans, seaweed vinaigrette and squid: 5 *- perhaps the best dish; flavorful tomatoes with local dehydrated seaweed and fresh beans makes a great, light, vegetably dish.\n-Dehydrated Monterrey abalone with sprouts and grains: 3.5 * - flamb\u00e9ed stir fry, tasting almost Chinese; a bit high on the salt and oil.\n-King salmon + roe and buttermilk cabbage: 2.5 * - the salmon was aged in brown rice koji, resulting in great texture. The roe was marinated in sake + grapefruit, and the cabbage was almost sauerkraut-like in taste. The ruin of this dish was over-emphasis on salt and smoke; the fish by itself would have been better than this dish.\n-Corn + corn and pork stock with pork jowl and kale, green onions + egg yolk: 4 * - Ramen-inspired, without the noodles; the corn was quite sweet, and the stock was flavorful; the pork jowl was just the right texture and amount. Overall a successful dish.\n-Grilled squab with smokey beets, huckleberry and fresh-foraged pink peppercorn: 3.5 * - the squab was serviceable and flavorful. The smokey beets seems to be one of their signature items, and the texture and flavor is nice. Overall, the dish doesn't stand out, though.\n-Blackberry tart: 3 *\n-Nectarine with steamed cheesecake + nasturtium flower, honey, and vinegar + oat crumble: 4* - interesting combination of flavors and textures; not too sweet.\n-Grilled strawberry gummy bear: 3.5 * - decent\n-Cinnamon Toast Crunch macaron: 3.5 * - like the flavor combination\n-Peanut butter mousse cookie + raspberry jam topping: 3 * - artistry is great, but the flavor just didn't work for me.\n\nOverall, service is good and the meal has many interesting components. I would probably go back if some friends wanted to try it out. If you're looking for a different, fancy dining experience (and are willing to pay for it), Lazy Bear is definitely a place to check out.", "author": "M N."}

Since this was a specific request of her's, I must admit there was a little sticker shock at booking time at the nearly $450 for the two of us.  After dining though, you'll get no complaints from me.\n\nJust about every bite/dish we had was amazing. Since I am guessing the menu changes quite frequently, and there are no choices since this is a tasting menu, I won't touch on any specific dishes.  Nonetheless, as long as you keep an open mind, I am sure you'll find a lot to like here.  They may even wow you with things you wouldn't think you'd like.\n\nThe portions are typical of a tasting menu, so don't expect to get stuffed beyond comprehension here.

My sister booked us tickets in advance and after reading up on fellow Yelpers reviews and a little bit of my own research I had a good feeling of what to expect.\n\nThe evening started with with a bit of anticipation and excitement. Once we pulled up, our Luxe driver met us and took my car for valet. We walked in and were warmly greeted and lead upstairs where we were offered the house \"punch\", a tasty concoction of gin spirits and served hor derves or snacks as the staff refers to them. The decor is warm and inviting, a reminiscent of a cabin in the woods, a strong feel of that folk art living. \n\nMy favorite snack served was the caviar potato chip and the \"hot chicken\" sweet breads. I loved being able to watch the kitchen from the balcony as they were preparing the snacks. If you got there early enough, before your seating, you could see them setting up for our service.\n\nOnce we finished the amuse bouche portion of the evening, each party was individually invited downstairs and seated where we soon served a concord grape soda.  At each seat, which I'm sure there are a plethora of pictures showing....a lovely note book with the menu for the evening and a mini pencil for note taking. After everyone was settled, the chef came out to greet the dinners and how the evening would play out. From the kitchen, various chefs would come forward to describe each dish as it was served...because we were at the end of the table it was a little difficult to hear as not all of the chefs projected loud enough across the hall.\n\nI really enjoyed many of the other reviews and definitely agree with those other 5 star ratings.

What made this extra special was that we went on the first night that they were testing out all new dishes which = more dishes + cheaper, it ended up being $100 per person vs the normal $130-150 range. \n\nI loved that you kickstart the meal by hanging out in the upstairs lounge surrounded by a warm cabin atmosphere.

Definitely get there early to secure a space since we were up there for about 30 minutes. \n\nThe restaurant is beautifully set up with 2 communal tables where you'll be ushered to assigned seats. We were seated in the middle of one communal table and our immediate neighbors on both sides had no interest in conversing with us, which was fine (we don't bite, lol). The chefs explain each dish as they are presented. I really appreciated that they provided a small booklet with the name of each dish, allowing you to take notes. I didn't do this since I'm not bougie enough, but it was a great souvenir to take home. \n\nEach dish was phenomenal. I was surprised to have liked every single one (definitely a feat if you ask me!!). We did not opt for the wine pairing because we just can't drink that much or that fast. You do have the option to add it on if you didn't purchase it with the reservation to begin with. \n\nWe will definitely be dining here again. It is one of our new favorite restaurants.", "author": "Lily Z."}

They start you off with cocktails and hors d'oeuvre upstairs in the loft. Predinner: Whipped scrambled eggs, channel islands halibut, broiled shigoku oyster, spicy pole beans, and cape gooseberry soda. \n\nDinner: When we sat down, they brought out some spelt & rye dinner roll with their in house cultured butter. The butter was smooth, soft, and decadently rich. The hard part was finding the balance to have enough butter for the pieces of bread. \n\nWine: The wine ordered was not too big and a bit light in taste. By itself, I wouldn't have liked it but for this meal, it did well as a background player. Coming in when needed but confident and dependable to downplay it's role so the food can shine. \nThe beef tartare with tomato was good and finely displayed. Next was the sturgeon & caviar. Apparently this was topped with a ton of caviar. I have plans to buy a jar and sit in pjs on my birthday with a glass of champagne and watch tv. Last was the monterey abalone. It was lightly salted and the meat was cut up into manageable small bites allowing all the other greens to mix in with the fine meat.\n\nThe aged squab with huckleberry, chanterelle, and sumac was perfectly done. The meat was tender but didn't tear apart during the cut. Mushrooms and berries brought an earthy tartness to the taste- and to bring forth more of that dark forest feel, there was a 'twig' that was prepared and lightly coated with dark chocolate powder reminding me more of earth and dirt. But yummy. \n\nNow the star of the show: the Wagyu Ribeye. How have I lived thus far without consuming more of this divine goodness? The experience was otherworldly. Before even cutting into the perfectly marbled meat, I hear soft gasping exclamations of, \"oh my God!\" down the long table. The Wagyu was from Miyazaki Prefecture, prepared with sunflower, sunchoke, and bradsicas on the side. Of course. I imagine this cow's life full of sunshine and happiness. Living in spoiled relaxations- days full of massages and beer with flowers behind it's ears. I've never seen such beautiful and even marblelizations. From the outside crust to the pink marbled meat, this plate deserves to be loved. This was worth it and this was happiness. I was sad when it was over. More please. \n\nTo clean our palette after that decadent love affair with the Wagyu, we begrudgingly enjoyed a cucumber salad of sort. It was fresh and unassuming- like a reminder for us to slowly get back to earth and continue on. Then first desserts came out w concord grape and buttered icecream. They do amazing things with butter here, folks. Don't be lactose intolerant.\n\nSecond dessert came with treats. Strawberry pate de fruit. Yums pate. Beehive pavlova and s'more. It was a perfect ending to our meal. The little checkered notepad contains everything we've eaten and the pencils provided were for taking notes. Thank you to my two loves for experiencing this with me. You are always great wonderful company and now synonymous with 'good eats'. \n\nWould I come here again? Yes. The menu changes every two weeks depending on what's in season. The atmosphere was warm and classy, the dining staff were all knowledgeable, helpful, professional, and extremely friendly. The food without a doubt is top of the line. The chefs are all top tier and sweet. Overall, the experience was worth every pretty penny. Good job, Lazy Bear. You did fantastic. \n\nLove,\n\nJodie", "author": "Jodie T."}

Loved that they were playing Geographer's albums all night. This is casual-fine dining without all the stuffiness and fru fru.\n\nFOOD:\n\nThe menu is based on seasonal produce so the menu changes month to month. Chef David Barzelay and his team masterfully created playful and delicious dishes. Most of the tasting menus I've had, even at Michelin star restaurants, there's typically 2-3 dishes that really \"wow\" me and the others may be a little more underwhelming. I absolutely loved all the dishes we had at Lazy Bear, minus the white sesame dessert which had a bit too much gel for me. I love everything, but some of my favorites:\n\n- Potato with caviar, sour cream & onion - this was one of the snacks we got which tasted just like a fancy Ruffles sour cream and onion chip. \n- Fresh corn grits - Usually the the flavor of grits are overpowered by flavors of cheese and milk. The chef didn't add any additional ingredients to the corn and just blended it which really brought out the natural corn flavor. The small piece of smoked duck ham was very flavorful giving the dish a salty compliment.\n-A5 Miyazaki Ribeye Cap - OMG seriously melts in your mouth\n- Blue corn ice cream with blue popcorn and blueberries - This dessert was such a fun dish and I love the popcorn which enhanced the corn flavor giving it a nice crisp. \n\nFor proteins we got two courses of A5 Miyazaki Ribeye (*insert emoji with heart eyes*) and pork shoulder. I was in meat heaven. \n\nAlso a must order is the cold brew coffee, it's seriously liquid crack. \n\n\nSERVICE:\n\nThe staff is warm and welcoming and you can tell everyone is passionate about their craft. We got wine pairings and our sommelier was very enthusiastic.. and cute ;). You can go up to the kitchen and talk to the chefs and ask them questions when they aren't busy. \n\nAMBIANCE:\n\nI was a huge fan of the communal seating, but I think your experience varies with who they place you with. My boyfriend and I got the wine pairings and so did the two parties next to us. After a couple glasses of wine and feeling a bit buzzed, we were all chatting about the best meals we've ever had. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed sharing the night with fellow foodies. Come here with an open mind, empty stomach, and be willing to talk to the people next to you.", "author": "Cindy A."}

After reading about it in national magazines, it's clear that Lazy Bear has made a name for itself using the unique experience of going to a fancy dinner party with friends.  In buying the tickets for a 2 person seating a month ahead, I was a little pensive about what to expect.  The tickets aren't cheap, and there's no option to peruse any menu before then, so it requires a lot of upfront commitments. Scary, I know.\n\nAs everyone's already raved about, the appetizers that are served up in the mezzanine area before dinner are on point.  The whipped scrambled eggs are the popular item, but there were some seriously amazing drinkable starters like the cucumber soda. Finding another group to talk to was a little awkward, so most people seem to keep to themselves leading up to being seated at the tables.\n\nUpon seating, you're presented with one more appetizer and then the super handy notebook that serves as your guide throughout dinner.  I took a few notes on each of the dishes the entire evening, and it's been incredibly helpful in reliving the entire evening.  Dishes were provided at a reasonable pace, and what I found a little interesting was how quickly your plates were cleared once you were done eating.  My husband and I got into talking to the couple next to us, and what I find to be absolutely incredible is how Lazy Bear seems to facilitate the coming together of other \"foodies.\" Some of the dishes that really stood out to us were the amazing and high quality cuts of protein we received, and the flavor profiles of both the sweet and savory dishes.  My favorite thing I ate that night was a Tomato Panzanella that had a thinly sliced piece of wagyu on top.  My husband's favorite was the pork shoulder that came garnished with stone fruit and almonds.  For dessert, we absolutely enjoyed the small treats at the end that included a semifreddo with Vietnamese coffee.  Talk about a flavor bomb!\n\nService wise, everyone was extremely accommodating.  The process of explaining each dish before eating it was helpful, as was the explanation that came with each of the drinks covered under the wine pairing. The whole experience felt tailored in a way that was meant for you to enjoy as much as possible with very few concerns along the way. I definitely recommend having a meal with Lazy Bear, especially if you're into something that's a newfangled concept that involves the love of food, delicious fare, and quality service.", "author": "Lisa I."}

And some of the 9-10 small courses are sublime. \nBut flaws abound. The separate arrival area does not have room for all the sit. Plastic chairs at a communal table, all courses served at the same time to all like a banquet-leaving slower eaters gasping,  succulent lamb meat but half fat, opening tidbits over-salted while salmon later on needed salt. Also the loudness of the music is offputting for such a fine restaurant.\nMost egregiously, the premium wine pairing was a disaster--the sommelier tries to show off by serving obscure selections many of which--especially the whites were weak.", "author": "Harvey P."}

It's right up there next to State Birds and The Progress.\n\nThey have an open kitchen where they encourage you to walk around, talk to the chefs, take pictures, and even write down notes on a lazy bear note pad.\n\nI MEAN-!!! It was like a foodie's dream come true. For once in my life, I can take as many food pics as I want: without people thinking \"oh look, there's another Asian girl taking a million food pics, lets STARE at her.\"\n\nAt Lazy Bear, everyone else was doing it, so I actually felt normal for once lol.\n\nThis is an awesome and fun place to enjoy fine dining without the pretentiousness. By design, I met so many cool people before, during, and after dinner. It's so much fun to connect with other foodies and get their take on things!\n\nSo what actually happens during dinner?\n\nOnce you walk in, they greet you at the door and take you up stairs into a comfy cabin-esque decorated lounge/living room with leather couches and small tables. This is also where you begin your round of appetizers, so find a comfy seat next to some cool people!\n\nAfter the appetizers are served, they take you down stairs and you grab a seat at the long communal tables. This is where the real fun begins. They even give you a booklet of their menu items so you can write down all your thoughts/notes!\n\nSo to sum it all up:\n\nUnless you're allergic to fun and good food, then you HAVE to come here! Reservations are hard to get since there are only two seatings a night: 6pm and 830pm. You pay for your tickets in advance to secure a spot and there are no refunds. A ticket will cost around $135 per person and it's totally worth it.\n\nFor more pics and deets, visit: http://cyneats.com/lazy-bear/", "author": "Cynthia L."}

Walking into the restaurant was like walking into someone's cabin in Tahoe. I loved the dark wood and the cozy atmosphere. It's fine dining without the awkward silences. Manners can be somewhat tossed out of the window. I got up multiple times during my meal and wandered about to take pictures of the chefs working in the open layout kitchen. Not only do they allow it, they encourage it. They totally get the modern dining experience - which is that people love sharing what they're eating across their social media channels. They even give you a little notebook with that day's pre-fix menu items so that you can take notes.\n\nTLDR REVIEW BELOW:\n\nAMBIANCE\nFine dining but with a casual spin. Jeans and sneakers are fine. Communal tables, but we didn't really talk to the people next to us. I would try to nab a table close to the kitchen so you can see all the cooking and plating action.\n\nPRICE\n$175 per person. You must buy \"tickets\" beforehand. The four of us shared a bottle of wine and each got a cocktail - turned out to be another $50 per person for the wine and the cocktails on top of our ticket.\n\nFOOD\nFresh and creative.

For instance, for the month of January now, tickets were released Dec 15th. Each ticket is $120 per person and with taxes and gratuity, it comes out to $313.20 for 2 (honestly why I've procrastinated for so long). They have 2 seatings per night at either 6pm or 8:15pm from Tuesday-Saturday. They used to be BYOB but now they have wine pairings for $65 or you an order by the glass/bottle.\n\nThey recently moved their own location in the mission. I love the new location. It has 2 stories. The second floor is where you hang out, have drinks, socialize and have your first few courses which are appetizers for the night. Then they will seat you downstairs at a communal dining table where you will have the rest of your meal. Not too big of a fan of the communal dining, if you're shy, you probably wouldn't be a big fan either. It's like having a large family dinner, but with strangers. It might not be the right setting if you're looking for something very intimate.\n\nEvery night it's a fixed menu of about 11 courses. During our time upstairs, they also served a gin punch before serving appetizers. All the dishes were delicious and tasty. In pictures, they seem like small portions, but halfway through I was getting full already. I won't go into the dishes too much because it changes. But everything was delicious and creative. You can tell a lot of time and work has been put into each dish.\n\nSome of my favorite dishes were the whipped eggs and bacon appetizer, the cold meat plate, the abalone and mushroom soup, and of course that amazinggg bread and butter. Who knew bread and butter could be so damn good. They start strong with amazing appetizers, but the main dishes were average. The dessert kiwi palate cleanser we had was a miss for me. But it made dessert way more appetizing in comparison.\n\nWhat's also nice is that they have an open kitchen were they welcome everyone to watch and ask questions as they are preparing each dish. And as each dish is served, they describe each dish with detail.\n\nService is superb and everyone is genuinely friendly and helpful.\n\nOverall, Lazy Bear was an amazing and unique dining experience. I do recommend everyone to try it at least once. Chef David and as team are amazing and full of awesomeness. \n\nI honestly probably won't be coming back for a while since it put quite the dent in my wallet and for the price of $300+ the dishes amazed me but didn't wow me as much as I expected for the price, probably because I was comparing it to other high end michelin starred restaurants which cost just as much.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

The whole experience was so great: wonderful, innovative, but delicious food, and the whole crew at Lazy Bear was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and had great esprit de corps. They were a happy lot that made diners feel like they were a great big family. I raved about the restaurant to friends and family.\n\nSo, for our son's birthday, we got a reservation for five of us at 8:30 on Thursday, August 18, 2016. We arrived a little early, around 8:15, which was fine.  We were led upstairs to the loft area where diners for the 8:30 seating wait for the previous seating to finish. We were served the standard Prosecco/mix drink everyone gets. Then, as others arrived, they were served the drink, as well as appetizers. We waited. Finally, just before 9:00, we were handed our first appetizer, eventually followed by two more appetizers, the standard process. We waited and waited, and didn't get seated at the dining table until after 9:30.\n\nThis is unacceptable for a dinner that costs more than $1,500 for a party of 5 with only two wine pairings and one reserve wine pairing.\n\nOnce seated, in contrast to the meal we had in April, the courses were very good, good, \"meh,\" or not good at all. We noticed that several of the chefs we saw in April were not there, and perhaps that explained the change. On top of that, the wait staff who we loved in the spring for their commitment to sharing knowledge with the diner, appeared less enthusiastic. \n\nThe wine steward spewed out information on the wines like a fast talking tape recording. When a diner spends an extra $140 on the wine pairing, he doesn't want to hear a torrent of words.\n\nChef/owner, David Barzelay, seems to be a very nice, personable man. I hope his selection as one of the top new chefs this year by Food and Wine Magazine didn't make him and his staff complacent.", "author": "Porky Penguin S."}

Why not, right? \n\nHere is the most reductionist way to explain it, (please excuse my writing style as I'm a political scientist with little creative writing experience) It's essentially a commune style dining experience in which even the kitchen is eventually cleaned by the artists that construct the meals. \n\nThe dishes are all unique. Each dish a fusion of various colors, flavors and textures that will make your taste buds dance! \n\nThe chefs encourage interaction. The underlying idea is to encourage dialogue and to be fully immersed in the dining experience. What this means is that you won't have the dark, quiet table you often have at fine dining restaurant. It's lively and the entire experience appears to be designed in a way that mimics much of the features of a real commune. Skilled chefs, work diligently in front of the crowd to prepare the dishes that are then passed out by staff. \n\nI'll post some pics. My words don't do it justice.

Luckily, we were provided with a field guide to note our thoughts on the food items to reflect at a later time, which is exactly what I'm doing! It was my first time doing this sort of tasting menu and I was fascinated at how everything was run from the upstairs appetizer/drinks area to desserts. \n\nAs snacks, there were whipped scrambled eggs (3), shigoku oyster (2), foie gras (1), cucumber soda (5), an caviar (4). I've added my ranking in parentheses. The foie gras created a strawberry pop as it melted in my mouth; I still remember the taste of it even though I've forgotten the others. The cucumber soda tasted like one of my detox juices and just clashed with everything, especially my drink.\n\nThe dishes came out in the order below:\n-Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll\n-Tomato Panzanella\n-Legumes\n-Celtuce Stem & Leaves\n-Fresh Corn Grits\n-Grilled Berkshire Pork Shoulder\n-Miyazaki Ribeye Cap\n-White Sesame\n-Blue Corn\n\nOnce again, I don't remember the taste of most of these too well but loved the fresh corn grits, which is funny considering I don't even like gritty textured food very much. I believe the chef mentioned that they only used corn and duck ham to go on top. Extremely rich in flavor and delicious. I also put a checkmark for Tomato Panzanella, which probably meant I liked it. :) \n\nAs treats (aka. dessert), there were semifreddo, caramelized apricot, and red velvet chocolate. Absolutely loved them, especially the semifreddo. \n\nThe timing of the food entrances, music playlist, and service could have been a bit better. I think at one point they started playing Trap Queen. Overall, I loved the experience but was confused at people obsessing over every bite; I don't think everything was necessarily *amazing*. (Like the dinner roll and butter, which was quite average.) I'd recommend eating without the assumption that every bite will be glorifying, because it probably won't be.

The SO and I came in February and we really love the place. The food, the culture, the concept of a dinner party, and everyone who worked there were so friendly, it was awesome.\n\nWe came for a 6pm seating. As many of the reviews will tell you -- it's a dinner party. You go upstairs and mingle while being served some appetizers, and then you go downstairs and sit at one of two long tables and are more or less treated to dinner and a bit of a spectacular show. The restaurant itself reminds me of log cabins that were near my college -- rustic and homey. It doesn't feel like dining at a stuffy restaurant -- it feels like coming to your friend's house for a really large dinner. Lazy Bear also does a neat open kitchen concept (though most of what you're seeing is plating, not so much the cooking) where you're encouraged to step up to the front and see what they're working on. \n\nWhen we went, our menu was:\nwhipped scrambled eggs\nshigoku oyster\nbeef tartare\ntete de moine\ncaviar with sourdough\nspelt and rye dinner roll\nbay scallop with geoduck, dill, buttermilk and gergamot\nsteelhead trout with sintging nettle, hedgehog mushroom, smoked roe\npoussin with spring onion, lettuce, fudgy yolk, bouillon\nlamb loin with salsify, apple, cress\ncarrot ham with chicories, bone marrow, bordeloise\ncoconut with citrus, bay\nchocolate with lapsong sauchong, armagnac\ncandy cap mushroom, persimmon, brown butter\nreligieuse peanut butter, jelly\nhoney meringe bee pollen\n\nHonestly, everything was pretty spectacular and well executed. Each dish was extremely thoughtful, and I loved how Chef was the one presenting all our dishes. He talks a lot about the inspiration behind dishes, where the dishes and the produce is from, etc. It's a lot more engaging than a more normal restaurant where you're just getting the ingredient list. Amongst the dishes that we had, the standouts were the steelhead trout (amazing piece of trout, smoked roe is a nice touch) and the fudgy yolk (made by sous vide) in the young chicken broth. \n\nI was impressed with the creativity in each dish, as well as the clean execution. There are a lot of singles out there that still don't execute perfectly, but to do so many dishes right for so many diners at one time is really quite a feat. \n\nLazy Bear is as good as it is I think primarily because it spices up the traditional dining experience one has in San Francisco. I do think the food here is at a higher quality in both creativity and execution than other restaurants in the area, but it's also cool to be a part of this process that is so SF. You're sitting in this strange giant clean log cabin being presented with dinner theater even though it's not a show in the traditional sense.\n\nPro tip: check out the view from the upstairs mingling area when you're done eating -- it's pretty cool to see how well orchestrated everything is.", "author": "Jasmine X."}

From cocktails to wine pairings, and their use of ingredients like ossetra caviar and geoduck the night was just over the top.  We came hungry, and left with the flavor of umami on our lips and good food and wine in our bellies.  I'm not doing this place justice with this review but if you can afford to do it I suggest pulling the trigger.  Cap of your evening with their iced coffee it's the perfect way to end the meal.

If you're a foodie and enjoy food, I would definitely recommend this place. \n\nOnly 2 seatings per night.  We had the earlier time of 6PM.  We were greeted at the door and went upstairs where we got to order a drink and hang out before seating time.  Loved the rustic interior decor and how you can see the communal tables from above.\n\nWe had a few bites upstairs before we were escorted downstairs for a sit-down meal.  They provided note cards with the menu where we were able to jot down our notes on each of the dishes.  That was a great idea and fun to compare notes with others.\n\nI had the wine pairing with my meal.  The presentation of each dish was great.  Definitely photo worthy!  I loved how they announced each dish to everyone at once and how they encouraged us to check out their open kitchen and take photos.  Definitely enjoyed the relaxing setting.  Minus one star for their disappointing desserts. \n\nThe only negative part about dining in the earlier seating is that you need to be done by 8 before the next group comes.  So you might feel a little rushed, but at least they give you the opportunity to go back upstairs to enjoy a drink after.", "author": "Erica S."}

Do I give it a 3 star of 4 star rating? I went with 3 stars because the experience was cool and thinking of how much effort was put into the food. I definitely think it was a cool experience. People should try it once. But once, is enough. It's more the hype and the cool experience that makes Lazy Bear fun to try. Do people ever go twice?\n\nIt's hard to get tickets, and when the tickets get released, we were scrambling on finding the right time to go within the next month so I was really excited to go. They start you off with a rum punch which was tasty, and a few appetizers upstairs. I thought the small bites were good, but underwhelming. The apps were a battered egg, foie gras, trout/salmon, fried artichoke chips, and an oyster. Great variety! I was disappointed the slush on the oyster was overpowering and took away from the oyster taste. \n\nAfter the apps, they take you downstairs to sit down in the communal tables. I love the set up and everything was so photogenic. It was really cool to go up to the open kitchen as well to watch them plate the dishes. Service was also spectacular. \n\nNow the food. The food was just not as great as they were describing. There were a few dishes I liked, but I remember one of the chefs explaining the lamb dish and he said it was the best lamb he's ever tasted. That definitely cannot be true, and if it is, then I would want to take him to some asian places or even Aziza who makes really great lamb. The rabbit was salty, but tender. I really enjoyed the barley soup broth with an egg yolk inside. That and the desserts were probably my favorite. I also really enjoyed the seaweed bread and cultivated butter that they made themselves. I also REALLY liked their pastry chef's desserts. All of the desserts were fantastic with great hints of something unique and memorable. Actually, the desserts for me, probably should have pushed this review from a 3 to a 4 star.\n\nOther than that, the food was underwhelming especially for the price. I thought they didn't use the right flavors for the dishes, and the halibut and rabbit were super salty. It's a hipster place, they tell you what they made, how they made it, and where they source it from. But would it be something I crave and want to go again? No...", "author": "Joanna S."}

The prix fixe menu is always such a treat.  Unlike most fancy restaurants where I leave thinking, \"I could have made that\" and somewhat disappointed to have paid more money to get less food - Lazy Bear is a fantastic deal.  You'll never see any of the dishes ever again, and they would be nearly impossible to reproduce - each has dozens of specially prepared ingredients, combined together in a once-in-a-lifetime medley.  \n\nThe wine parings were fantastic - some of the most unique wines I've had.  Several of them were not even good at first sip, but as soon as I tried it with the food, both shined.  Really impressive matching.

It's a super fun, super intimate, super innovative dining experience. The space is so warm and inviting you'll forgot you're in the Mission District in San Francisco. I love the way everything progressed, you start with some bites and nibbles upstairs and then move down for the full dinner. The food was this amazing blend of modern creativity with childhood nostalgia. Fried mushrooms and sauce that brought up memories of sour cream and onion potato chips, a salsify dessert that if you closed your eyes you might confuse with cocoa pebbles and cereal milk. Every ingredient was bursting with flavor. It's also fun to be able to interact with the staff, chit chat with other diners, and really enjoy your time. For me, the 6pm seating was perfect (I don't know if I would have been able to last through the later seating). A really phenomenal, really special dining experience.", "author": "Stephen S."}

This was my first tasting menu, and I can definitely say I've never had a meal that explored so many different flavor and textures. It was definitely unique and service was beyond excellent. However with the price tag and the notoriety I expected to be blown out of the water with every dish. A few misses brings this down one star.\n\nMy favorites were : \n-Steak Tartar (Best I've had by far. So flavorful I could eat 5 more of these)\n-Potato Fondue (the mushrooms in here were SO GOOD)\n-Pork - the apricots with the pork... You have to eat them together! The apricot's sweetness went so well with the \n-Salmon was perfectly cooked and the cucumber made the salmon really light and refreshing. \n\nNot so winners:\n-The soup: the soup was kind of .. Underwhelming? And the texture of the egg was odd\n-The white sesame dessert: I wasn't into the texture or flavor of this. Really odd soapiness coming from it\n-The last three desserts: the macaroon was really interesting and the only one I liked even though the mint was a little be overpowering. The other two I could definitely do without\n\nTips:\n-Whoever gets in first gets the first choice in seating both upstairs and downstairs. \n-You can share wine pairings with a friend if you can't handle drinking all six 4oz glasses by yourself. \n-Choose your dates and times carefully because the same meal could cost you between 140-200.

The cocktails and the punch up in the loft were both great.  The first five courses that were served up stairs were all rather small and are more of an amuse bouche.  With great anticipation we were shown our seats at one of the two tables and Chef David gave a lovely speech amongst other things encouraging people to visit the kitchen.  The unfortunate part is that the courses were quite rushed and there was only a few minutes to go to the kitchen to take a picture while they were plating the next course.  It seemed that there was not time to really enjoy and appreciate the courses.  \n\nThe service is phenomenal.  Everyone seemed quite nice and attentive and worked together like a wheel oiled machine taking and replacing silverware with each course.  Overall, we had a nice time but we were not blown away, especially for the amount of effort that went into buying tickets.  One of the people in our party had never done a dinner like this and for him it was just about right but for the rest of us this will not stand out as some of the other multicourse prix fixe dinners have.  I would go back for drinks but I won't be rushing back for another dinner.  Amongst our favorites were the bread and butter, the black sesame ice cream, and the Vietnamese coffee semifreddo.

It's actually quite shocking that I love this place so much, as I am admittedly a quite picky eater. Walking into a restaurant and eating whatever is served to me is not exactly something that I am naturally drawn to.  Lazy Bear has completely opened my mind to the concept of the 15 course tasting menu, and knowing that it's okay to relinquish control of my plate.. when there is such a brilliant chef at the helm!\n\nWhat I love about Lazy Bear is that it is so darn thoughtful. Every single piece of food, on every single plate, on every single course is very well thought out and planned. Each plate is a work of art, so beautifully and carefully plated, typically not looking anything like you expected from the menu description. Every serving is a fun surprise! All of the flavor combinations are truly unique and inspired by what is in season.  I have tried foods here that I have never heard of, always paired with foods that I know, to form a brilliant, delicious, and well balanced bite. Don't come here if you want the same old same old. You might get something called a \"crab cake\" on your menu, but I guarantee you that it won't look or taste like anything you have ever eaten before.\n\nTo add to the amazing food journey led by Chef Barzelay, you have the super cool atmosphere of the restaurant. You start with your first 4 or 5 courses upstairs in the lounge, like you are at a happy hour, with the cocktail du jour, or your own beverage choice. Head on down to one of the two long communal tables and walk up to look directly into the open kitchen. They actually invite you to come up to check them out while they are working! Before every course, one of the chefs gives a detailed description of what you are about to eat. Sometimes we waited to hear what was on our plates (because we couldn't tell from looking at it!) and other times we chose to dig in and try to figure it out before we heard the explanation. Whatever method you choose, it's always an adventure!\n\nHIGHLY recommend eating here for your next special event, with friends (or come alone and make some friends!), or if you REALLY want to impress your date with something extraordinary.  Be prepared to spend about 3 hours at dinner. It's worth every minute!\n\nSpecial note: No need to worry about what you are going to wear. Lazy Bear is indeed highly elevated and fancy food, but the environment is laid back, casual and fun!  (p.s. wear stretchy clothes! ha!)\n\nHere is a partial list of the foods that I just do not eat, but I have eaten AND loved at Lazy Bear:  lamb (cooked), lamb(tartare), sweetbreads, mushrooms, hot sauce, soft shell crab, caviar, black olives,coffee. I literally cannot believe I liked these things.  Unfortunately, I still can't eat them elsewhere because they just do not contain the magic that they did at Lazy Bear!\n\np.s. I have read some of the 1-star reviews here out of morbid curiosity. I can't believe anyone is complaining that the parkerhouse roll and cultured butter should not be considered a course! When you have FIFTEEN courses, they are all small.  But not only that.. THIS roll is a special spelt rye roll that comes to you piping hot out of the oven and is served with their jaw-droppingly delicious cultured butter that they have been maintaining for *years*! That, my friends, is what makes that \"dinner roll\" course so special. Like I said above, you might see \"dinner roll\" on the menu, but it's like nothing you have eaten before. :)", "author": "Sherri H."}

Somehow they pull it off.\n\nThe two stages with upstairs then downstairs seating to break up the courses is quite clever logistically as well as just a cool experience.  You start with the first 4-5 courses upstairs in the causal lounge seating while the earlier seating finishes their remaining courses downstairs.  It allows you to warm up to the evening in a very cozy and laidback atmosphere.  The final courses at the long banquet tables downstairs are triumphant. Each course was spectacular and just needs to be experienced, words won't do them much justice. Every course is accompanied by one of their 8 billion chefs providing an essay-style overview (no talking allowed during but nom nom is ok), their literary creativity is also on display.  \n\nPro tips:\n- Be prepared for an epic odyssey.  By the time the final course arrives, you've been there 4 hours.  For realz.\n- Skip the Laundry and come here instead, for a $150 it's a steal.", "author": "Saminda W."}

You can mix and mingle with other patrons, or just keep to yourself. The snack courses start promptly at your ticketed time, so I would get there early to secure a seated spot and enjoy drinks at a leisurely pace. The snacks are served cocktail party style and we pretty much liked all of them: Whipped Scrambled Eggs (great flavor and texture), Shigoku Oyster (melon accompanied it perfectly and did not overwhelm), Foie Gras (this tasted more like dessert to me), Cucumber Soda (well, I love cucumbers so this was a win for me), and Caviar (in a pringle roll...YUM). \n\nAfter the snack portion of the meal you are escorted to your seats to eat the rest of the meal at a communal table. The chef(s) comes out and describe each dish before it is presented. We got to sit right next to the kitchen and were lucky to see all of the action. We had 6 more courses: Tomato Panzanella w/ribeye carpaccio (one of my faves), Legumes (beautiful presentation, bright flavors), Celtuce (savory and pretty hearty for a veg), Corn Grits (pretty rich), Pork Shoulder (this was just ok for me), and Miyazaki Ribeye (melt in your mouth good). Following these dishes we had 3 dessert courses. I usually love dessert, but wasn't a real fan of these unfortunately.\n\nOverall the food is pretty good, with a couple hits and misses for my taste buds. I wasn't completely blown away by anything in particular, but I will still remember what a great experience I had as a whole. I also got the drink pairing menu, but I would have preferred they spaced the drinks out more evenly. In the beginning I felt like my glass was empty for a long time, then at the end they came so fast that I couldn't keep up. You only get one drink during the cocktail party portion of the dinner. I wish a couple of the drinks were had at this time versus more towards the end. As far as service, it was great. Friendly, talkative people.", "author": "Lindsey C."}

Because there were two of us, we were offered a standing table by the railing, even though there were 2 tables for 4 with seats available. We asked if we could sit and the hostess was a bit hesitant given these tables are supposed to be reserved for groups of 4, but she said it was fine.\n\nOverall, the service was above average, but not at the level of a Michelin starred restaurant. The unique experience was fun, especially having the opportunity to watch the chefs prepare and plate each course. However, there was not a single dish that blew me away - a lot of them were pretty good, not amazing, while a couple were just bad. Further, the pastry chef was incredibly rude when she presented both her dishes and her snobbery really ended the meal in poor taste.\n\nMy opinion is that if you are a foodie that likes to try the trendiest new restaurants, go to Lazy Bear and try it for yourself.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-19", "description": "For my dining companion's special birthday, I chose to celebrate at LB because not only was the food rated highly, but the restaurant was noted for its dinner-party-like atmosphere. Not only do I enjoy dinner parties, but it's my preferable way to entertain guests in my home.\n\nWhen I booked the reservation, which was easy to do after I read the page of instructions, I paid $156.60/person with my credit card. At the time of dining, you can decide if you want to add the wine pairing or mixed pairing for $65/person. If you do decide to add the pairing, a 20% tip is added and the total comes out to $84.83 with tax. Now that the shocking finances are out of the way, I can move on to the fun stuff.\n\nAs all the reviews mentioned, you start out upstairs with complimentary low alcohol punch, which tastes herbal and medicinal. Spacing upstairs is limited so the early bird gets the worm (or chair as in this case). Because the atmosphere is supposed to be dinner-party-like, my dining companion and I began talking to the people around us. However, people are shy and we had to dig for common ground. Eventually, we found another couple celebrating a birthday and found commonality with them while being served whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple, hot sauce, shigoku oyster with citrus kosho froth (my photo came out grainy due to the low lighting), a platter of duck liver mousse with marmalade, duck confit hushpuppy, with black lime, duck rillette which is the quince fruit roll-up, and duck Slim Jim with sour cream and herbs. The last of the appetizers was a bowl of bone marrow and cheddar fondue (more like a broth) served with crudit\u00e9s. Out of the appetizers, the scrambled eggs served in a shot glass was my favorite.\n\nWhen it was time to move downstairs, the host seats you in pre-assigned seating. Hoping we would get to sit with the couple we had met upstairs, I was sorely disappointed when we were seated next to a  couple who didn't want to interact with us at all. Luckily, the restaurant welcomes you to move around, so the guests are encouraged to get out of their seats to observe the kitchen, talk with the chefs and staff, take pictures, write notes in the provided booklet so we weren't stuck with the unsociable couple who only wanted to talk between themselves and their phone. Uggh!\n\nCultured butter which tastes like cheese accompanied the brown butter brioche which was served first. Afterwards, the sorrel salad containing garden herbs, spot prawn, geoduck clam, barley, and miner's lettuce arrived and was challenging to eat because it contained 3 snails which our chef announced were fed only basil and then braised for a couple of hours. See photo. Although I've had snails many times before (here and in France), I must be out of practice because they kind of freaked me out seeing them in my salad. Seeing the miner's lettuce reminded me of hiking in the Santa Cruz mountains with my daughter's pre-school class whose teacher would pick up various items along the trail for the class to touch or eat....like miner's lettuce. When the charred onion broth was served with Tennessee Ham, an egg yolk, pea-sized apple balls, and scallion, the chef's description of the egg yolk was fascinating. A raw egg yolk is set in 67\u00b0F oil overnight to \"cure\" it. After hot broth is poured over the yolk, you can cut it in half and it still keeps its shape and has lots of flavor. \n\nAfter the starters the saffron lobster was served with rice grits which was very much like risotto made with lobster broth. Interestingly, the chips that accompanied this dish were made from spot prawn roe that were dehydrated, mixed with rice then dehydrated again, then lightly fried. When the grilled squab arrived, I was not only excited about the squab itself, which I hadn't eaten since I was a little girl in Mexico, but it was served with foie gras which was banned (but recently lifted) in CA for several years much to my dismay. My only complaint is that there wasn't more. Mixing things up a bit, the wagyu ribeye arrived with a Thai coconut green curry sauce. Admittedly, the beef wasn't as melt-in-your-mouth as I had hoped, but still the combo was amazing. \n\nEnding the meal with a variety of sweets is my kind of meal. Creatively served with creme anglaise, cream cheese, sparkling water and fennel was an all carrot plate: pressed dried carrot, carrot granita and carrot boba. Following the vegetable dessert was the sticky toffee pudding with a brown butter sorbet, walnut brittle, and sweetened creme fraiche. Rounding out the desserts was a selection of treats: chili rose macaron topped with togarashi, negroni gelee, toasted s'more, a caramel wrapped in edible rice paper and walnut mousse cake. See photo.\n\nIf you're like me and you want to socialize in a dinner party-like atmosphere with food that is being prepared in new and creative ways, then LB is a worthy splurge.", "author": "Monica S."}

The reason for the four stars and not five is the menu and price. I know they have a new menu monthly, with seasonal ingredients. But I was really sad when the only two dishes that were mainly fish/meat, were my least favorite. The fish was trout, and I was not a fan of the taste. And then there was squab... Not sure if you consider that meat or poultry. I will say it was executed great, but very very salty. At the end of the day, squab is just not my thing.

There are two seatings per night, and you're seated in one of the two long tables along with the rest of the diners (a traditional they preserved from their popup days). Their menu changes every few weeks, so I won't go into detail as to what we had as it most likely have changed. They release their reservation for the month via a \"ticket system\" in the previous month. If you're interested, I would suggest you subscribe to their mailing list, as they email you when the \"tickets\" for next month's reservations go on sale.

The fresh peas were amazing in this dish.\n-Asparagus \"salad\" with hazelnut and Ham: for some reason this reminded me of a Persian grub-like food called salad Olivier, but elevated about a thousand times. I really enjoyed this. I felt like every bite taste slightly different.\n-Caviar and leek custard: Yum.  Not too salty caviar. really enjoyed this.\n\n2 out of the 3 desserts were pretty good but not  \"blow your mind\" awesome.  One of the desserts was just flat out bad . Took one bite and put my spoon down.\n\nThe dinning room itself was beautiful and i really enjoyed the eclectic music choice... I'm pretty sure I heard Danzig at one point in the night. The transition from dish to dish was well timed too, allowing for a very natural flow to dinner.\n\nTHE BAD\nThe drink service was awful.  To the point that we would order multiple drinks just to ensure that our glasses would not go dry for upwards of 30 minutes.  \n\nLett's rewind a little to the beginning of the night. Walk in, check in, and find our way to standing  area overlooking the dinning room. Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait a little more and finally receive the complementary punch and we ask about a drink menu.  And then again we wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait until we finally receive a menu.  About 45 minutes into the night when we order and later finally receive our drinks (appero Normand and a couple glasses of whiskey) and walked straight downstairs to be seated .  We were literally served our drinks after all of our snacks/appetizer dishes were served. \n\nOnce seated we played this whole waiting game all over again.  We tried making the most of the evening and simply started ordering multiple drinks at the same time (had a couple cocktails which were good, and a glass of their kolsh which was bad...like the beer was infected and tasted like corn).  Even our after espresso order was delivered as i took the last bite of the last dessert course.\n\nI will say that we ordered 4 different types of whiskey/scotch and all 4 recommendations were great!  So that's good.\n\nIt basically felt like we were completely ignored because we had not ordered the wine flight.  I'm not a fan of wine flights (specially if the wine flight included champagne...it's just not for me). I'd much rather choose what I am drinking.\n\nWould I go back, possibly. The drink service was so damn disappointing.  It kinda felt like you were a second tier client just because you opt out of the wine flight.", "author": "Roxane P."}

The food itself is obviously great and incredible, and I'll elaborate on that more in a second, but what really makes the experience so unique is how meticulously well thought out it is. Everything from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. \n\nWhen you enter Lazy Bear, you know you're in for an adventure. You're escorted upstairs to the nice \"lounge\" area. You'll be server the punch there (which is a nice pleasant gesture, although I didn't find the punch itself to be that exciting). Which brings me to the two following recommendations: 1. go to the 8:30 seating, 2. get the drink pairings. One of my favorite parts of the experience was sitting upstairs and enjoying drinks and conversation, while looking down, and essentially watching a full on spectacle unfold. What's really unique about Lazy Bear is how open the kitchen is, and how integrated it is with the whole scene.  When you sit upstairs, you get to watch this very well thought out, and planned operation unfold. \n\nEveryone here raves about the food, but I'll actually keep my food commentary short, since I think it's a given that it's great. (Also, even though I took notes in the little notebook that they gave me, I conveniently forgot it there, and the drink pairing did make things a little blurry). Some favorites for me were: the bread and butter, the oysters with the bite of kiwi, the scallop crudo-like dish, and my FAVORITE: the carrots. Who knew?! The carrots stole the show for me. Easily most creative dish I've ever had. The dessert was great too. Dense chocolate truffle cake with lapschong (sp?) flavor that made it really smoky. Again, very creative! You will not leave hungry. The individual portions are small, but after 16 courses of them you will definitely feel satisfied. This is not one of those places where you have to go to a second dinner after to feel full. \n\nI really enjoyed the communal aspect of it. I think it took a lot of the pretense that typically comes with fancy places like this out of it. It's really great how much interaction you get with the kitchen -- they encourage you to come up there, observe, ask questions (although to be honest, the courses come so quickly, you won't really have time to).", "author": "Rita K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-02", "description": "Lazy Bear is an culinary experience. The presentation of the food was superb as well as the taste and service. Although expensive, I definitely think this is something everybody should try at least once. ($300+)\n\nTwo of my awesome bestest foodie friends (Christine, David) who wanted to dine at this restaurant unselfishly purchased a gift certificate for me and my girlfriend. In return I promised to take many photos and write an extensive review on Yelp about my experience, so here it is! \n\nFirst things first, I wanted to note how Lazy Bear does its reservations/seatings. You will have to purchase the tickets via website a month prior to your desired date. They sell out pretty fast. Tickets range from $150-175 per person. It is a set menu and they will accommodate dietary special requests.  If you purchased/received a gift certificate you will have priority and be contacted immediately when tickets go on sale. Parking isn't too difficult to find in this area, and it is also not too far from Bart.\n\nMy dinner reservation for two was at 6PM. Upon arrival, our coats were taken and we were escorted upstairs to the mezzanine area where we sat and ordered alcoholic drinks (not included in the ticket price). You can order pretty much anything as they do have a full bar downstairs. I had requested for a more intimate area for my and my girlfriend as we were celebrating our anniversary. I was seated in sofa fit for two in the corner of the mezzanine and was very pleased they were able give us a secluded intimate area. They served us complimentary refreshments that was very refreshing and flavorful. My girlfriend said it sort of tasted like chinese herbal medicine. It was similar but this was much more refreshing and delicious. Once everybody was settled in the handful of waitresses/waiters started rolling out the appetizers/snacks.\n\n*Note: Lazy Bear serves a different set menu every day (or maybe month?). Below is what I had on 02/05/16. \n\nSNACKS/APPETIZERS (bite sized):\n1) Whipped scrambled eggs - You are eating foam that tastes like bacon and at the bottom of the glass had a spicy sauce that was very delicious.\n2) Shigoku oyster - this was my favorite dish upstairs. It was amazing! They put kiwis in the oysters that I thought really fit well with the oyster. \n3) Beef tartare -  beef on top of a cracker (made out of rice?). The beef just melted in your mouth. It was very flavorful. \n4) Tete de moine - this was a very beautiful dish and there was a flower that tasted like cheese on it. The main component of the dish was some kind of celery mousse. \n\nAfter these dishes we were brought downstairs and seated. In Front of everybody was a warm wet towel, a menu, some caviar, and bread and butter***. The head chef David, welcomed everybody and introduced the dishes in front of us prior to eating. Before each dish is served a different chef would explain each dish. \n\n***I'm going to quote the head chef on the cultured butter they've been working on for 3 years. \"The butter is pretty f***ing delicious\" and yes, the butter was f***ing delicious. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Hands down, best butter I've had. I asked if I can purchase some and she was able to accommodate my requests.\n\nEntres:\n5) Bay scallop with geoduck, dill, buttermilk - I'm not a huge seafood fan, but these were amazing. The scallops were so fresh and tender. It might have been one of my favorite dishes.\n6) Steelhead trout - Again, fresh and tender. It was amazing. \n7) Egg yolk Fudge- Egg yolk fudge, super savory dish. The egg really was fudge like.\n8) Black truffle grits - Most comforting dish. It reminded me of mac and cheese but a lot better. Heavy amounts of black truffle on top.\n9) Squab - Not a big squab fan, but you can tell the meat was incredibly tender and had a nice smokey flavor. It tasted a bit like duck.\n10) Lamb - Very juicy and flavorful. I don't eat lamb regularly, but this was good. \n11) Coconut & Dark Chocolate desserts - The coconut had a very interesting texture. I preferred the dark chocolate. \n12) Small dessert snacks - The snacks were underwhelming. Some had interesting flavors, but the presentation was beautiful. I probably enjoyed the peanut butter & Jelly the most. \n\nLazy Bear was a great experience for me. I really wanted seconds of certain dishes. I think all of them tasted good and all of them had a great deal of thought and consideration in each dish. By presentation alone, you can really appreciate the work they put into making each dish. \nI know you are wondering, \"Will I be full? I'm paying $300+\". Yes, you do get full because they serve you so many dishes.  In addition to that I've tasted and experienced flavors I've never had before. Like I said, it is an culinary experience. There is more to it than just sitting down and eating. \n\nShoutout to the waitress who hooked me up with some of that delicious cultured butter. God damn...It's so good.", "author": "Allen C."}

We like to think of ourselves as \"wannabe foodies\" and this place had been sitting on our must-try list for a while. We're so glad we finally had a chance to try it - reservations are tough to get since they are only released on a monthly basis and tables get scooped up fast.\n\nWe had the 8:30pm dining time so the experience started upstairs in the lounge area where you get a few light appetizers to start, along with a very refreshing cocktail. You're enjoying some light bites while the 6:30 diners are wrapping up. \n\nOnce you move downstairs you feel like a family sitting at the two long tables that span the entire space. Every dish is presented by one of the chefs and then served one-by-one to all of the diners. Chef David invites anyone to come check out the kitchen at any point during the dinner too...it's all open, so you get to watch the chefs in action. Cool idea.\n\nThe dishes were so unique and so delicious. Our favorite dish was the lamb - it was the most tender and juicy lamb we have ever had! There were so many other dishes that were also incredible - I don't think there was a single thing we didn't enjoy.\n\nSome additional highlights: \n-The staff was so nice and accommodating throughout the night. We mentioned how much we loved the bread and butter (so simple, yet light and delicious), so they brought us more!\n-One person in our group of 5 got the wine pairing, and they provided additional pours for anything they liked.\n-We brought our own bottle of wine, but if you purchase a bottle there they waive your corkage for your own wine - we did that which was well worth it.\n-At the end of the night one of the staff members remembered how much we liked the butter, so gave us a couple of containers to take home. YUM! \n\nThis place really is a unique experience and worth trying if you appreciate great food. The only negative (which really isn't a negative except for those of us on a budget), is the price. You get what you pay for though, and you get GREAT FOOD AND GREAT SERVICE here!", "author": "Molly K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-20", "description": "This review was made with the help of my \"research assistant\" Penny, one of my stuffed bears who volunteered herself to dine with me and the No1DP in search of other likeminded critters such as herself. Not wanting to disappoint her with the actual meaning of the restaurant's name (an anagram of the owner/chef's last name Barzelay), I took her along so I could actually enjoy eating as she took notes in our field guide. I present to you a summary of her notes.\n\n---\nLazy Bear is first and foremost a communal dining *experience* that showcases modern American fine dining. Relying on the energies of a packed restaurant, tickets are limited to two seatings of 40 people. E-mails are sent when tickets are available.\n\nACT I: SNACKS\nThe presentation of amuse bouches takes place in the upper level of what looks to be a cabin made for a weekend nature retreat. Various spots of the cabin are designed depending on how communal a party feels comfortable participating. Two couches allow space for larger parties (or groups of small parties) to convene while smaller tables and a small corner couch are designed for parties that want more intimacy (and are prime spots to watch the 6pm dinner unfold if you're scheduled for 8:15).\n\n- Whipped Scrambled Eggs (Bacon, Maple, Hot Sauce): It's the best way to eat eggs and maple bacon as it combines the essences of eggs and bacon without getting full! It's better to actually mix it evenly for full effect.\n- Olio Nuovo (Milk Gelato, Grape, Almond): The olive oil is the main star of this course and the toppings complement it; milk gelato tastes buttery. The dish is served in an ornate glass bowl.\n- Duck Charcuterie: Consisting of duck confit hushpuppies, duck rillette (quince leather) and duck slim jims. The items presented were a cute way to present meat. The slim jim toppings had a cooling effect to the spicy duck. Rillette tasted like a Fruit Roll-Up. Hushpuppies were fancy duck nuggets done right.\n- Abalone Chowder (Potato, Chive): An interesting take on chowder, there is a tease of abalone and the chips have a nice salt-and-pepper crunch.\n\nThere was a house cider that was quite strong. I couldn't finish my drink for fear of not wanting to get too sick from the remaining alcohol that was to be served.\n\nINTERMEZZO: MIXED PAIRING\nWe had the mixed alcohol pairing, which consisted of two white wines, two red wines, a beer and cocktail. These can be bought at time of ticket purchase or tacked on upon arrival. Pairings worked well with their respective dishes. \n\nACT II: MAINS\nThe rest of the meal took place in 2 long communal tables seating 20 people each. Hosts will escort diners to their spots on the table to balance out the parties. Observing that the earlier seating wasn't very communal, we made an effort to make conversation with both sides to us. Having a stuffed bear as a prop certainly helped with breaking the ice.\n\n- Brown Butter Brioche (Cultured Butter): The bread was easy to pull apart with your hands. Crust was crunchy yet the bread was warm and soft. The butter culture has been in use for 2 years and has a cheesy consistency. \n- Bay Scallops (Mandarin, Yogurt, Juniper, Chicories): A \"celebration of citrus\", the small scallops soaked the mandarin oranges and yogurt. \n- Dungeness Crab (Persimmon, Brown Butter, Brussels Sprout): The stock is made from boiling the crab shells and the pincers are used for meat. Persimmon chips are slightly crunchy and tasted good with the crab brine.\n- Matsukake (Douglas Fir, Scallion, Kohlrabi): The mushrooms are only in season in the early winter. They are also grown under pine trees, which gives it a distinct smell. No1DP notes that the bowl and soup broth are made to be enjoyed as a miso and the aroma is more noted if you sip your bowl instead of spooning your soup.\n- Squab (Pomegranate, Salsify, Hazelnut): Squab is domesticated pigeon but the taste and texture was similar to ribeye. The breast meat was used. The salsify and chips absorbed some of the fat. \n- Beef Short Rib (Rice Grits, Carrot, Black Trumpet Mushrooms): The meat was braised to perfection. Rice grits were creamy but not rich. Glaze consisted of carrot juice.\n- Kiwi (Chartreuse, Kaffir Lime, Buttermilk): Lighter of the two main dessert courses used as the palate cleanser. The combination of ingredients are meant to be blended together as a slush.\n- Parsnip (Coffee, Cocoa, Egg Yolk): The heavier of the two desserts and made to be blended together. It's a more unusual way to eat parsnips but the blended mixture was more enjoyed than the individual components. Contrast the parsnip with the toffee made with combination of dark and milk chocolate.\n- Mignardises: Standout was the green tea cake and frozen smores. \n\nIf additional items were ordered the bill for remaining items were tucked into nature-themed paperbacks.\n---\n\nThe Lazy Bear dinner party was a success!

You finally opened a restaurant!\n\nHaving been to the pop-up / underground twice, I was really looking forward to this experience but I guess a few things were sufficiently different and not as good for me that I cannot bring myself to give Lazy Bear the brick & mortar location 5-stars.\n\nFirst, the ticketing system. It's a bit confusing, I guess even after you figure it out it seems mostly obvious that most nights you cannot make reservations for 4 or maybe larger than 4. Big-ger parties are definitely a no go. The location is fine, parking is *ok* but don't expect to have an easy time with that either.\n\nThe tickets were very expensive. Between the processing fees and the dinner and some other fees it was almost $330 for two people. This is a significant jump from the previous $240 or even $260 for two and it was BYOB.\n\nYou will pay another $65 or so for wine pairings, which I heard were ... less than superb but I didn't partake so I can't comment. Had to drive!\n\nThe format is also a little strange. They suggest you show up a little before your seating time which for me was 8:15. I showed up at 7:45 and there was no one there. We didn't end up getting seated until 9:15 or so. So basically you hang out upstairs and get some \"treats\" and maybe buy your own alcohol before you are even able to sit down. The whole time you stare at the party below (you're on the 2nd floor before dinner) ... and you just kind of ... watch them eat and prepare food and it was kind of an interesting experience. \n\nThere weren't as many dishes as before, the menu wasn't as creative I thought as it had been when the chef could have free reign of whatever he wanted to do. I definitely feel like this is a product of the fact that they have to pay for a brick & mortar location and that probably comes with a host of renting costs and other licenses. The portions were also just ok considering they reduced the number of dishes. \n\nIn the end I feel like it's a good experience to say that I have gone, but I preferred the previous format better in many different ways including not staring at other people finishing their meals and being able to start on time.

The bacon / egg / bro sauce shot was unique but the actors were vibrant.  The beet and goat cheese tart were unremarkable.  But the lamb was cooked perfectly.  The pear tart was amazing as well.  There was also an oyster with green vegetable pur\u00e9e which was earthy and good.  I enjoyed the sweet corn with truffle - such a powerful flavor as well.  \n\nComplaints - I took the second seating and we were upstairs for nearly 90 minutes.  And the upstairs chairs are not that comfortable!  the whole experience was 3.5 hours which was a bit long for me. Also, the pacing is very slow upstairs vs fast downstairs. \n\nTips - split the wine pairing!  The wines are great but sharing it was the eighth amount.  My wife and I shared it and it was almost too much wine for two of us.  \n\nOverall, the format is great, I just thought it took too long.

Chef said I need to sneak a criticism in here (I didn't notice at first but he was standing right behind me while I was writing this).

For all the hype (not to mention the price..), I really hoped and believed Lazy Bear would be a 5 star meal and experience. The food however, unfortunately paled in comparison to the experience and expectations.\n\nUpon arriving, you are ushered upstairs to a gallery-like lounge, decorated with old picture frames, bear heads, and an eclectic and trendy array of furniture. It is an upscale hipster's haven. Here you are offered house punch and can also order beers, cocktails, and wine of your liking. At around 6:20, they begin serving your \"snacks.\" Wonderful soft scrambled eggs touched with maple syrup, an oyster, and fantastic duck pate served with berries. Unfortunately, just as you're beginning to get excited, it's downhill from there..\n\nAt around 6:50 or so, everyone is taken group by group down into the dining room and seated across from your date at one of two long dining tables. The tables are thankfully spacious, although the 40 or so dining and talking definitely makes it difficult to have any sort of private, let alone understandable conversation with your date. I of course was seated next to someone sick and so was cascaded with coughs throughout the evening. Not exactly a 5 star experience.\n\nEach course was brought out and introduced by one of the chefs which was definitely a unique touch. Furthermore, the kitchen is open to the dining room so that in between courses, you can get up and observe the chefs preparing the next course.  Without a doubt, a very cool experience. If only the food was better..\n\nThe meal started with homemade bread and butter which was perhaps the highlight of the remaining 8 courses (the snacks upstairs counted as 3 of the 11 courses). Except for the duck which was delicious although still not the best I've ever had, all of the other courses were simply average, except for the soup which was flat out terrible. Besides for the impressive aesthetic presentation, everything was rather bland and lacking depth of flavor. With the conclusion of each course, you figured something was simply off in that dish, and that the next course would be incredible. Unfortunately, that was not the case. It was an evening of  continuous \"meh.\" \n\nIf you have endless money to spend and are really excited about the exclusivity of the place, go ahead. But if you, like me, are a huge foodie (with a budget), don't waste your dollar here. Instead, hit up Acquarello in Nob Hill- just as expensive as Lazy Bear but infinitely more delicious.\n\nIn summary:\nDecor - 5 stars\nService - 4 stars\nSnacks - 4 stars\nMain Courses - 2.5 stars\nDessert - 4 Stars\n\nOverall, a 3 star experience, taking into consideration the high prices.", "author": "Rachel L."}

Come with either a developed palate or the delusion that you can appreciate the subtleties of a piece of asparagus roasted in its own juices.  If an excess of verbiage on the descriptions of food bother you, then you should probably give this a skip.  At times, I legitimately do not know if I am being sold a bunch of bullshit, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt as the bullshit was, at least, very tasty.\n\nThe service was exquisite, though, and I do appreciate the chefs taking the time to explain their food.  The open kitchen is also fun to watch if you're the type to enjoy the finer parts of fine dining, like plating and such. They really make you feel like a VIP.\n\nMy largest complaint is that I found many of the dishes to be overly salty.  Like, whoo, I can feel my blood pressure spiking hard salty.  A part of me also wished that there would be more food (I know, I know), but at least enough for two bites: One to be introduced to the texture and flavor and such, and another to really appreciate based on the expectations.  Having to do all of that in one go made me feel a bit hurried, like I didn't have the opportunity to really appreciate something.

Alas, they have decided to no longer give those options, so we will unfortunately not be back. 5 stars for the food, -1 because it really was less value for your money when you opted for those alternative menus and because I wasn't that crazy about the drink pairings. I'm sure the value thing was part of why they stopped offering, along with just being difficult to manage. BUT it was amazingly delicious and I'm sad we can't go again :(\n\nThe service was impeccable. We were the only two weirdos that night who chose alt menus, so the floor manager greeted us, introduced herself, and was usually the one to bring us our dishes. We also chatted with the chef afterward and he asked us about each of our dishes that differed from the other diners'. For once, we didn't feel like party poopers for skipping out on the cholesterol.\n\nThe ticketing system is definitely odd, but it was actually super nice to not worry about the bill at the end of the meal.

I like how each of the staff members presents the dish.  I also like that you can get close to the kitchen and watch them.  I like how the experience starts at the loft and you have cocktails and dishes (food starts here, so do not miss this!!).  I also like that you don't have to settle the bill there.  It's already settled beforehand.  You just have to settle your drinks.  I love the menu idea and that they give you a printed version BEFORE you eat so you know what you're supposed to be eating.  You can write your thoughts and notes down.  \n\nPresentation of the food is great.\n\nFood, however, was overall less than stellar.  My fiance commented that this felt like their off night.  Like he KNOWS they're capable of so much but the night we went just wasn't a good one.  There were a handful of really good dishes, but there were a lot of bad ones.  My favorite was the scrambled egg, dumpling and caviar, the sea bass, and the rack of lamb.  What makes me bring this rating to a 3 is that I felt that a lot of the stars of the food got lost in the dish cause there were so many frills around it.  I couldn't tell what was what.  What abalone? I couldn't find it.  I think that was the fondue dish.  It felt heavy.

Some of the stand-out items were the following:\n\n-Seaweed Foccacia with Salted Butter - this bread had incredible texture and was perfectly toasted.  The salted butter was flavored perfectly so it was a perfect way to start the meal with the amazing savory flavors \n\n-Chicken Consume with Egg Yolk \"Fudge\"- while I wasn't necessarily a fan of the yolk (because I'm not a yolk fan in general), the consume was really good with the nice flavor of chicken and I loved the very creative idea of the entire dish.  The yolk had such an interesting consistency...almost like fudge.\n\n-Potatoes Fondue- I can't even describe this...cooked potatoes dusted with green herbs with additional vegetables like peas and kale.  This dish arrived super green and it was such an interesting plate that tasted great. \n\n-Pork with Collard Greens - I usually don't eat pork, but this was incredible...grilled with the perfect amount of saltiness and cooked with butter, this was a decadent and tasty dish.\n\n-Plate of desserts: Macarons (Miso Caramel), Ice Cream Chocolate Sandwich, Pate de Fruit (Strawberry), Cream Puffs - these were all very good...they took fairly typical dessert items and added a great twist for something unique that really worked.\n\nAll the wines for the pairing were great!

I enjoyed myself, my table companions, and every course, though I think I was expecting more (hence 4 stars). I also thought continually recommending the overpriced wine pairing (particularly on a Tuesday night) was a little much - adding an additional $200 to the already overpriced menu price shouldn't be pushed on people. Yes, I understand you think that's the \"best way to experience the dishes,\" but I've only once experienced an exceptional wine pairing once and I don't think this was the place. \n\nPerhaps I was underwhelmed with the variety of dishes that were served, which were inspirational, no doubt, but centered mostly around vegetables. The one central meat dish was a lamb, which was cooked to perfection and probably the best piece of lamb I've ever tasted in my life. But it was literally just a piece of lamb. \n\nFor the dinner price, I expected to be served an array (or at least a handful) of heartier dishes. That's not to say each petite course didn't include some stellar work or I didn't walk away satisfied, but I'd like to be served something that both exemplifies the beauty of Bay Area's local flavors with a 5-plus bite dish.

This meal was just that for me this summer. The concept, atmosphere, people, and food were all exceptional. A foodie's dream: I'd take this over French Laundry any day. 5 stars all the way.\n\nFood: 5, Service: 5, Atmosphere: 5\nCost to worth it ratio: 4.5 (~$150 depending on your night and so many courses)\nReturn worthiness: yes! yes! yes!\nEve award: one of my top unique dining experiences\n\nHighlights:\n- Concept: what I enjoued the most was this embraces people who love food instead of distancing them with the formality some other spots have\n- Kitchen access: you can see the kitchen right there and are invited to go up there and take a close look or ask questions. So SO cool.\n- Top Chef-like intros to each dish: you get to hear the personal story, origin of the ingredients, and details of the dish composition. So intimate like you got invited to some VIP event.\n- Format: you're upstairs for appetizers and an included cocktail--or something you'd like to order--and then taken downstairs for the bulk of the meal. Like the variation. \n- Atmosphere: Retro Woodsy cabin style with skin rugs and bright orange fireplace up top and beautiful super long wood tables down below.\n- Little menus to write in: printed tasting menu gone to summer camp provided to each person wass a fun touch. \n- Potato fondue: my fave dish of the night. Delicate potatos on the bottom, a layers of cheese sauce, morel mushrooms, topped with green herbs. SO rich and delicious. 5 stars,\n- Bread: warm roll topped with salt and paired with a decadent butter was one of the best I've had. 5 stars\n- Salmon mint: I'm not a salmon person but this was sou vide and chilled so the flavor was muted and mild. The thin cucumber slice wrapping and cold melon and mint liquid on top was devine for a warmer summer day.4.5 stars.\n- Pork: beautifully glistening and presented on top collard greens with vidalia onion puree and apricot. A great well rounded combo. 4.5 stars\n- Egg in broth: extra fatty fudgey textured egg found on the bottom of the chicken duck broth. So different with simple flavors. 4.5 stars\n- Scrambled eggs shot: one of the starters had blended scrambled eggs, bacon, and a bit of tabasco and honey. Crazy combo and the smooth texture worked well. 4 stars\n- Squab: with coconut jus and fig was a nice tropical mix. Big slice too so no need to hunt for the meat. 4 stars\n- Pairing: have a beverage pairing option for around $70 which includes wine and maybe a cocktail (ours had a lovely bourbon apricot one).\n\nMidlights:\n- Tickets: like the ability to buy ahead of time and have openings however with it being on just one day if you miss it you're out that full month. \n- Seating: unless you bought together you won't know who you are sitting next to or where. We lucked out being right in front and were SO excited but bet we won't get that lucky again.\n- I don't remember much of the dessert except for the liquid nitrogen use though I'm more of a savory person.\n\nLowlights:\n- Not for picky since it's a set menu though you can tell ahead of time if have allergies and they will accomodate them.\n\nYou'll notice my rave is a lot about the experience and not just the food--that's what puts it over the top and makes it so great.

Don't worry, you won't sit uncomfortably close to other diners, and your group will sit together.  If you arrive for the later seating, prepare to stand for a long time... due to some logistical bumps we had to wait in the upstairs lounge for over an hour after our scheduled dinner time before being seated.\n\nThere's not a lot of point in going into the individual courses, because they change them up all the time... but just in case the head chef is reading this, my favorites over two visits were:\n- the signature appetizer whipped scrambled eggs (with bacon, maple, and hot sauce!)\n- the scallops served with charred onion and squid ink sauce.  AND the scallops (on a second visit) served with mandarin, yogurt, juniper, chicories, olive oil and chunky salt.\n- the dungeness crab with persimmon chips and tons of butter\n- the squab with pomegranate, salsify, and hazelnut \n- and the \"cured then sous vide then grilled\" pork jowl.

Looks like they refined their reservation process so its not nearly as impossible to get a reservation as it was before!\nJust make sure you are on their email list so they can alert you when their next batch of reservations are ready.\n\nI was able to score a 6pm reservation for a sat for my bf and I. We got to lazy bear a little before 6pm and were escorted upstairs to their cocktail area. The upstairs was very cozy. A nice wilderness lodge feel with lots of buffalo checkered patterned things as decor. There's a mix of standing bar top tables and sofas with coffee tables scattered throughout the floor. My bf and I didn't see a comfy spot to settle down and we wanted to easily get up and walk to our seats when dinner was ready so we just opted to stand near the stairwell. It was awkward as they served a nice punch and then some cocktail bites but some of the bites weren't fingerfoods. They were served in large ornate bowls and so my bf and I had to take turns holding our drinks so the other one could finish their bar bite. Aside from that the cocktail portion of the meal was fine.\n\nOnto the dinner! The kitchen is open as it was in the old space and they encourage you to go up and look at what the staff is doing but this time there is a line that you must stay behind so you don't get in the staff's way. All the dishes were delicious. For the menu I had, I really enjoyed the sea scallop as the char on it was sooo flavorful! The duck was very tender and flavorful as well.\n\nMy bf and I did go for the wine pairings and this is where I think the service needs improvement. We received wine pours on time with all our dishes but not one server actually told us anything about the wine or even showed us the bottle labels. Sorry but if I paid $60 per person for wine pairing, I think I should get a little bit of info on what I am drinking?\n\nAll in all, lazy bear is a very unique dining experience that I think everyone should experience at least once? Definitely something to do for a special occasion and with no more then 4 people! Their menu is always changing and the chefs there create amazing dishes so go try it out!", "author": "Christine W."}

Chef David Barzelay and his team put together one of the most inviting dining experiences that I've ever encountered, and it's done in a variety of ways. From the moment we were welcomed upstairs for the cocktail hour through the final bite of our dessert courses, the entire experience was unforgettable. Sorry it's taken so long to finish this review, but it's well-earned. Congratulations to the entire team on earning their first Michelin Star!", "author": "Brien B."}

But once we got there last night, everything was absolutely amazing. We were welcomed so warmly and escorted right on upstairs. We were slightly late, we got there at 6:05 but we didn't miss anything, thankfully. They started serving the snacks almost immediately. My favorite snack was the beef tartar, surprisingly. I'm not usually one for tartar and it had foie gras, which I am usually not that big on either. But it was delicious. They served a tequila based punch, it was very good also. Once we were done with snacks and cocktails we were whisked downstairs and sat. We sat next to a group that were bro-I got out, that was a bummer but hey, bros have to eat too. Each course was gorgeous, each chef that created the course spoke about their dish. Their explanations were wonderful and very detailed about where the ingredients came from and why they paired this with that. I think the best part about the dining experience was the their urge to get up and take photos and ask the cuts questions. My favorite course was the steelhead trout with stinging nettle, hedgehog mushroom, smoked roe and perfect little potatoes. It was delicious!!! It was all delicious. I love the little note book and pencil they provided. I totally geeked out and wrote notes. My boyfriend and I shared the wine pairing, I felt it was the perfect amount. I loved it, it was gorgeous in every way and I recommend to get the 1st seating. You can go upstairs afterwards and they welcome you to drink in the lounge afterwards. \nGo, it's worth it!", "author": "Sarah M."}

However, since the menu is seasonal, best to wait a few months to come back since many of the dishes were the same. Absolutely love the space -- really well thought out pacing of having the guests up in the balcony first for the appetizers then moving along to the communal dining space below. The staff is amazingly friendly, courteous and efficient. The communal dining is what you make of it. The first time we made friends with our neighbors and second time, just mingled with our guests. Food is truly wonderful and having everything else come together --- the ambiance and service, truly makes for a magical evening. Oh. And if you have a sweet tooth, try their iced coffee. It's delightful! Get yourself on their mailing list so you know when they release the tickets.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

The courses are creative but very try-hard. It seems like they just wanna put cool sounding ingredients together just to make it sound fancy, but no real ground-breaking flavor.\n\nNow the real upsetting part. We were a large party celebrating a birthday. A few people were making jokes, others were having conversations. It's a joyous occasion. Apparently this was not aligned with the facade of fake classiness this restaurant is trying to keep and they ended up cutting off a couple of our friends. None of us were out of line or did anything that warranted it. However, the cooks, trying to reel from their failed attempts at a world class dining experience were scrambling for any to feel relevant. \n\nI will not patron this establishment again because they were definitely unable to provide good food or service, especially for how pricey and pretentious this place is.", "author": "Firas A."}

The atmosphere of sticking 40 people in the area and having them congregate together was interesting because everyone didn't seem to know what to expect and had little to nothing to talk about. They served us with snacks and punch upstairs, if you don't drink alcohol don't take the punch.\n\nAfter they had cleared the tables around 9:10 or so we slowly came downstairs where they introduced the cooks and explained some things we could do such as taking pictures of the chefs, asking them questions, walking over to watch them prepare and cook, and etc.\n\nWe had multiple small dishes that had rich flavors in each bite, the guy next to me was tempted to lick his plate, which I think he did...and another guy used his finger to wipe some of the sauce off the plate before licking his fingers. Yes that's how good it was.\n\nAt the end they offered coffee and provided us with dessert/treats which were bite sized and unique in their own ways. I swear the macaroon was alcoholic tho...possibly the only thing that I didn't really like, but everything else was great and tasty. OH I also had the flight of beer which I thought tasted great, they bring out 3 small glasses of beer...kinda like samplers for $10 but it was well worth it.\n\nI came here with my girlfriend and she loved every minute of it. They were even able to compensate for her allergy to fin fish and provided her with a different unique plate that she thought tasted great.\n\nAll in all the meals are small, but the you enjoy the meals and slowly digest/get full/content while sitting around waiting for each entree.", "author": "Christopher W."}

This restaurant has become one of my favorite restaurants in the city, and that is saying a lot because I never knew how to answer people when they asked. Lazy Bear not only provided an amazing, intimate experience, but literally all the dishes were AMAZING! Best part is that everything was pre-paid and you didn't have to worry about that after the meal. One sneaky part though, you don't know that the restaurant is there until you walk up close to the door and see the logo. The place is painted black on the outside with a stripe of red and black checkered design - love the sneakiness though :)\n\nArrived at 8pm for the second seating for 2. We were brought upstairs and started off with a Tequila Punch. People there were already taking advantage of the communal experience. My boyfriend and I ordered the Almanac beer (sour) and the Flight of Beer during our wait for our seating. While we waited, we were offered hors d'oeuvres!\n- Whipped Scrambled Eggs: This came in what looks like a double-shot shot glass with foamy egg at the top & a kick of spiciness at the bottom with bacon bits and chives all over. Very tasteful!\n- Albacore: Peanut, grape & black olive under a small piece of albacore - this had an interesting texture when you eat it all in one bite, but surprisingly good altogether.\n- Foie Gras: Usually not a fan of foie gras, but you don't taste that usual gamey taste when it was on top of a strawberry cracker & sorrel! \n- Caviar: The potato chip exterior that wraps the caviar with sour cream was also one of my favorite hors d'oeuvres of the evening!\n- Hot Sweetbreads: A bit too spicy for me (can't really handle spicy) but it was very tasty! I thought it was a piece of chicken but was surprised that it was fried bread with pickled watermelon on top - which helped with the spiciness.\n- Concord Grape Soda: We got this cute grape soda in a tiny chemistry-theme glassware with a tiny water straw when we got seated. Had a hint of gingery taste to it, so I didn't like that, but it wasn't overbearing so not bad.\n\nGot escorted to our assigned seating & waiting was a cute field guide notebook with a pencil! As a designer, this was awesome! It had the date printed on it with all the dishes for us to write notes! Love! We were able to walk up to the kitchen & see the chefs decorate and work. The aesthetics were amazing & so particular. I also did think it was fancy for them to fold up my napkin & tidy up my seat everytime I walked away - talk about amazing service! Main courses:\n- Spelt & Rye Dinner Roll: From the butter to the bread, they made this themselves. Warm & toasty. A bit on the saltier side but I still gobbled it up because it was yummy.\n- Tomato Panzanella: One of the dishes that stood out to me most with a thin carpaccio of Miyazaki Ribeye above a layer of avocado, padron conserva & seaweed focaccia. Cutting each bit with all items in one spoonful had so much texture & taste, that I wanted MORE! \n- Legumes: Summer squash, bell, pepper, fennel, and saffron nage all in one with a buttery foamy sauce around it just made everything mesh so well together. Each legume was sweet on its own & mixed with the buttery sauce just topped it off for me :)\n- Celtuce Stem & Leaves: common Chinese veggie, but the way they made this was different from how I'd eat at home. The took the inside of the celtuce & kept it crunchy without overcooking & topped it with almond and chicken skin bits for extra flavor - I would have been happy with the celtuce stem itself, but the bits they added on top put it on another level!\n- Fresh Corn Grits: OMG CORN! They cooked the flavor of the corn just perfectly because all of the corn taste was just perfectly there! I am a huge fan of corn and I gobbled this up wanting and craving more! They had a bit of what looked like proscuitto on top which tasted good with the corn, but on its own it was salty. Man do I miss this delightful taste!\n- Grilled Berkshire Pork Shoulder: The fatty part of this pork was sweet & yummy. Different that it was cooked with grilled peach, turnip, succulents, & stonefruit tare - but they went  surprisingly good with the savory taste of the juicy pork.\n- Mizyaki Ribeye Cap: Mmm.. how i love wagyu! This was probably why our meal costed so much but I loved every bit of this fatty meat! It was cooked at perfect melt-in-my-mouth-ness and paired with tomatoes, black garlic, and eggplant - boy would I want some more of this right now! \n- White Sesame: This was probably my least favorite of the night, IF i had to choose one. Subtle & not too sweet of a sesame pudding with bits of green melon & sake.\n- Blue Corn: One of my top! Who would of thought kettle corn and, blueberry ice cream & cake would go so well together! Craving for more!\n\nTreats:\n- Semifeddo: Vietnamese coffee ball - not into coffee but interesting\n- Caramelized Apricot: best one of the treats, not too sweet\n- Red Velvet: soft and had a tiny strawberry\n\nTL;DR - LIVES UP TO THE HYPE!", "author": "Amanda C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-10-24", "description": "I didn't know much about Lazy Bear (an anagram of Chef Barzelay) except for a few facts: it was a pop-up in SF, it was highly rated on Yelp with a near-perfect score, and it was extremely hard to get into. I was hooked immediately but was thwarted a few times the past year when trying to get a seat through their lottery system. My most recent failed attempt was for their last dinner in June before they moved operations to their brand new brick and mortar space - the endgame of all pop-ups.\n\nImagine my delight when Anna came through clutch again with a surprise reservation for October 5 at their two-story space with two long communal tables seating a total of 40 guests per service. She was able to pounce on two tickets on their new system that licensed the software of Alinea's system where diners prepay for tickets in full. which cuts down on cancellations. Despite the whole system crashing due to demand and technical glitches, the first two weeks of dinners were sold out within hours. \n\nOur UberX pulled away in a cloud of mist as raindrops lazily pelted us from above. Our eyes nervously darted from door to door for a semblance of signage when the hostess appeared in a doorway and smiled. Our eyes adjusted to the darkness as we stepped into a beautifully decorated dining space with ultra-high ceilings, huge open kitchen with gleaming steel, and gorgeous wood on wood action from the tables to the floor. The space was so new that blank canvases hung on the walls of the dining room as placeholders for some forthcoming art. We were led upstairs to the lounge to relax until the rest of the diners arrived.\n\nThe lounge had an unobstructed vantage point of the dining space and the kitchen below where Chef Barzelay and his staff were calmly prepping and assembling the firs round of amuse bouches.\n\nThe lounge itself made me feel like I was in a pimped out ski chalet with mid-century finishes. Hexagonal coffee tables. Fireplace from the Jetsons' living room. Plush bearskin rugs. And a picture of Tom Selleck with his trademark mustache that just oozed masculinity.\n\nThe comfortable vibe continued when we were offered glasses of complimentary punch: roasted pineapple juice with rye whiskey and basil - refreshing and quite potent.\n\nAt this point, groups of diners started arriving upstairs in waves and began mingling with strangers, which echoed Lazy Bear's motto: \"We think that the best dining experiences are the ones where we're seated around a table sharing food and stories with others.\"\n\nThe first amuse bouche or \"snack\" as they refer to it, was a shooter of whipped scrambled eggs with bacon, maple, and a dot of hot sauce. The sous vide eggs in cream went down smooth and the sweet maple syrup and hot sauce added great contrast. Could have had 4 more of these.\n\nNext up was a cute Damson plum that has been bruleed with chicken liver mousse, brioche cracker, caramelized onion puree with sorrel leaf. Great balance of the savory chicken liver (my favorite kind of liver) with the sweet, juicy plum (my new favorite fruit).\n\nServers were smiling and holding out trays of food for people to Instagram. The excitement for the upcoming dinner was palpable as the small talk between strangers grew louder. \n\nThe most interesting snack in terms of flavor and texture were the charred tomatillos with caramelized onion creme fraiche, beef jerky, radish. I enjoyed both the crunchy radish and fleshy tomatillo as the juice dribbled down my chin. The smoky beef jerky and the subtly sweet caramelized creme fraiche could easily be slathered on anything...like a bagel for instance.\n\nAn onyx bowl of chilled sweet corn custard with American white sturgeon caviar was placed on our plaid tablecloth. I'm a fan of anything sweet corn so this went down the hatch in five seconds. My only gripe is that it was a small portion - I understand that it's an amuse bouche but it was literally one spoonful (look at the picture of the spoon for scale).\n\nAfter serving this last snack, servers began guiding everyone downstairs to take their seats. The host had a clipboard of everyone's name and seating position - curious to find out how they determined the seating. Alphabetical? When the reservation was made? or purely random?\n\nWe sat next to a couple celebrating their first anniversary as well as an old friend and investor of Lazy Bear back when it was pop-up. By trade he worked at IGN and had never invested in a restaurant before but after falling in love with the concept a few years ago, he was more than happy to support Lazy Bear as it transitioned from pop-up to brick and mortar.\n----------------\n\n(Rest of my thoughts here: http://www.scrumphsus.com/blog/2014/10/20/lazy-bear)", "author": "Scrumphsus B."}

When you pay $750 for dinner for two, it's a little hard to admit that the experience was anything less than amazing.  You of course are seated with a great group of folks, but at the price point i would not expect a typical SF crowd.  \nThe first issue is when we were led upstairs and asked to stand next to a table where we will enjoy our \"snacks\".  I didn't realize that we would randomly asked to stand for over an hour with one glass of champagne.  For $95 each for pairing i would expect a little more of a generous pour than one glass for over an hour.  We were the last to be seated so by then i was a little over it.  \nI'm not a foodie so i should have steered clear anyway, but i would have liked to recognize something.  My friend who joined me for dinner was someone candid with his remarks and our dinner companions didn't like that.

So was so happy that my friend scored tickets!! Also a bit nervous that I'll be disappointed because I've been longing to try it and might have set expectations too high. Had dinner here two days ago and I'm still feeling happy about it! \n\nDouble date dinner at 8:15pm on a Thursday night- We arrived ten minutes early and was immediately escorted to the balcony mezzanine area also being told that people finishing up dinner at that time were guests from their first seating- they only do two seatings a night. Not many people were on the balcony so we chose a comfortable corner to sit down and chat. At around 8:15pm, staff starting to serve us 'snacks' which were delicious bites to start of the night alongside with all you can drink punch/gin drink, but you can also order your own cocktail or drink from their drink menu. Even with seats, it was a bit difficult eating the snacks because 2 out of 4 of them required using a spoon so it was challenging to find space to put down your drink. Nevertheless, the balcony mezzanine was a nice space that was decorated to have a cozy cabin like feel. We saw some people who arrived later having to stand, which probably wouldn't have been so fun while eating and managing drinks.\n\nIt was about 8:45pm when we got seated downstairs. We got sooo lucky with scoring front row seats to see all the action! The three counters at where they line up their assembly line to create all guests' dishes at once were just three feet from us. We were told that we could walk up and look, ask questions, take photos, etc at any moment (except when they are ready to serve of course). Wow, what an awesome idea! And I thought it was so brilliant of them to come up with this assembly line to serve so many people at once, and to open it up to guests is very warming. At your seat is a lazy bear passbook that you can refer to for menu items and can take notes on throughout the meal, I thought that was so cute and thoughtful because often times, I'm scrambling to my phone to type up descriptions and notes on things I'm eating and missing ingredients :(\n\nFood- There were a total of 14 dishes including the 4 snacks consumed upstairs. The master chef told us that something on the menu changes daily, so you never come back to the identical full menu. All dishes were delicious and well executed in my opinion. There was only one dish- a blue cheese custard that I didn't like, only tried a teeny tiny bite but it's because I don't like blue cheese. My friend who likes blue cheese had his portion plus his wife's! I later learned that you can request for dairy free menu but have to inform them way in advance (so that's next time for me!!). My favorite dishes of the night were their scallops, Dungeness crab (in chestnut pur\u00e9e/soupy goodness!), duck, and avocado ice cream with candied yuzu and citrus fruit dessert. Their pork loin and Jowl dish was also good- loin was tender/juicy, and Jowl was savory and melts in your mouth (and I am not a fan of face bacon). \n\nDrinks- The punch made with gin, pomegranate/orange juice and Rosemary (i think) was delicious and crept up on me. With dinner, I had a Gruner Veltliner to drink which was highly recommended by the sommelier when I asked for something dry, but I thought it was just okay. I had a sip of fiance's Chardonnay which I liked much more. \n\nService- great! All staff were friendly and patient. I felt bad whenever i stood up to walk a step to take a photo of the chefs at work because a staff would already be behind me to fold my napkin back up only to find that I would return to my seat after they folded up the napkin (at times they weren't even done folding it!) Staff were super attentive, the moment I got up, he asked if I was heading to the restroom and pointed me to it, even though i was already informed of it on my way up the balcony when I arrived. Jowl was actually left out accidentally in my plate and staff was super apologetic when my fianc\u00e9 pointed it out to them. After dinner, the master chef/owner came up to us for a 1:1 question/answer time, which was nice. We also took a photo with him and learned a bit about him, which was so nice I thought.\n\nFor its price, I do think it's a great deal for what you get! The amount of food (which was great, and I felt so full!), level of attention to detail/attentiveness, and total experience, I would highly recommend it. I think they could easily charge more per person and still would be sold out every night.", "author": "Iris H."}

We were promptly greeted and was welcomed with a \"Happy Anniversary,\" which meant they actually read what patrons wrote when asked if they were celebrating any special occasion when purchasing the tickets.  \n\nWe arrived around 5:20 and doors open at 5:15.  I was fortunate to purchase tickets for their 6:00 PM seating.  We were escorted to a nice sitting area where guests can mingle and enjoy each other's company as they prepare for the \"snacks\" to be served to you before the formal communal dining experience.  A special \"adult\" punch was brought to us and they explained the different types of beverage pairings, you have a choice of the $95 pairing, the  $145 reserved pairing or a la carte cocktails and wine selections.  We decided to share the \"reserved\" pairing and it was a great decision.  The selections they chose were amazing!!\n\nThe dining experience promptly started at 6:00.  Guests were brought their beverages selections if they chose the beverage pairings, the Champagne was poured.  The snacks were served and explained.  You will be able to enjoy 5 different \"snacks\" during this time.  I noticed all the patrons received their beverage options and by our 4th snack, we still did not receive our initial Champagne AND I also requested a couple of glasses of water during the second snack service which was not brought to us.  I had to wave down the person who wrote down our beverage order to remind him about our pairing and water.  To me, this is quite disappointing especially from a Michelin starred restaurant.  I expect a near perfect service experience.  I notice how meticulous they were with setting up the place settings at the communal tables below as we were enjoying our snacks.  To have to remind them of a $145 pairing and water is unacceptable IMO.  This isn't Denny's.\n\nI was initially skeptical about sitting at a communal table and felt an obligation to be forced to speak with my neighbors.  This isn't supposed to be a \"forced fun\" work function.  I wanted an intimate dinner with my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The people that sat next to us worked out and we had a good time conversing with each other although I found it odd, they sat 3 Asian couples together.  Whatever, it worked out and it turns out we are all celebrating a wedding anniversary.\n\nThe selections were tasty and it was, for the most part, an enjoyable, different experience.  I liked the open kitchen atmosphere and seeing the chefs work as a team preparing the food.  I have mixed feelings with each chef explaining each dish individually before being served to you.  On the positive side, I hearing what was involved in each dish and with some chefs, you can see the passion they have for the food they prepared.  On the negative side, when I got into an interesting conversation with the people I was forced to sit with, we were interrupted to listen to the chefs, which breaks the flow with someone you just clicked with.\n\nAt the end of the 14-course meal, I probably could have eaten a little more, it was right on the cusp of being barely full.  I joking suggested to my wife, to order a pizza from Delfina which is near by.  \n\nI would have given it a 4 star but because of the forgotten initial beverage pairing and the second request for water drops them down to 3.  If I was allowed to give 3.5, I would have considered that.\n\nOverall, it was just OK and nothing WOW about it except for the price.", "author": "Ernest Y."}

This illustrates how amazing the restaurant is.  From the experience to the food, it was pure joy and awe.  Every bite were full of surprises.  It is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to! If you want to attend the restaurant, you would need to be part of their email subscription so that you know when tickets need to be purchased.  Yes, you need to buy a ticket before you eat. The website will provide you the ticket prices and what dates and times are available. In addition, the menu changes frequently so I will not be going into what I had.  You will not be picking the courses, as it is all planned out for you already.  The place is expensive, but what can you expect from a fine dining restaurant with an exquisite dinning experience?", "author": "Ellen Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-11-19", "description": "We went earlier this month just in time to celebrate Lazy Bear's first Michelin star. Overall the experience is good, although it feels, somehow, not at the level of other restaurants in this league. While the food is excellent, three things gave me pause. Just to make it very clear, the execution and the quality of the food is, truly, elevated-- the 3 stars represent the quality/cost. The experience is very well executed, particularly the reception with the initial 4 appetizers. The number of servers on the floor feels a little bit excessive at times, but they are all extremely professional and ready. \n \nAfter appetizers upstairs, we sat for a meal with 7 courses, 2 desserts, and the treats platter (3 small sweet bites). Overall, I would say that 2 of the main courses blew my mind while the rest happened to be simply very good.\n\nNow, with the things that I didn't particularly like:\n\n- Like some other people mention, the tasting menu feels short. Haute cuisine doesn't need to mean that you finish your meal hungry.\n- Because of the communal style of dining, the meal felt a little rushed. This was more noticeable with the wines of the tasting menu than with the food.\n- Flavors were ultimately way too familiar. This is very personal, but when experiencing a Michelin star restaurant I'm expecting to be a little more challenged and surprised by the dishes.", "author": "Ibai G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-30", "description": "My first Michelin restaurant and it's well worth that celebration in itself, because this place was SO WORTH IT.\n\nFor 2.5 hours, you and your party will be attending a cuisine performance worthy of Cirque Du Soleil. From the beginning to the end, the diners of Lazy Bear are guests, and the waitstaff and chefs are the actors. Enjoy~\n\nYou need to plan at least a month in advance and book tickets to this show online at their website. 6:30 or 8 PM for dinner, my love? This is entirely up to you. 6PM means you can watch the 8;30 party from up above in the lounge where you originally began, but 8:30 PM means you can watch the 6 PM party from up above as well when they're ending. We chose the 6 PM party because I can't eat dinner late, makes me too hangry.\n\nWith cabin-themed decor all around, it's cozy and didn't make me feel out of place. It's not luxurious, it's not bougie, and I didn't feel out of place, despite my age and my work casual attire. \n\n** TIP: Arrive half an hour before your time to get a seat upstairs, otherwise you'll find yours elf standing around these tall tables. **\n\nWaitstaff will come by, show you the beverage pairing menu in case you'd like to add that on to your meal tonight, and also the beverages list as well which includes a small list of cocktails, and an extensive list of wines and spirits. Got our cocktails before the snacks arrived, and they're in this rustic and beautiful glassware that fits so well with the cabin theme.\n\nOnce it's 6 PM, the real fun begins. Waitstaff comes back with 4 appetizers. Seems to be that no matter the season, the snacks are consistently the same, but I won't go into detail. My boyfriend asked the waitstaff how certain things were done for the appetizers, and they were friendly and informative, and didn't seem troubled by all the questions. \n\nAfter your four snacks, my boyfriend and I were conversing when someone came back and asked if he could take us downstairs to our seats. WELL OF COURSE YOU MAY! Having yet another conversation about food and cooking, he brought us to the long communal tables next to another couple, and sat us across from each other. There's the small book everyone's raving about, but I tried my best not to peek at what's to come. \n\nWith each course, the chef behind it will introduce it, explain the thought process behind it, and the ingredients as well. You can begin eating the dish before the chef is done explaining it, as he said you should eat hot food when its hot and cold food when its cold, but I found that as each plate / bowl arrived in front of me, the plate / bowl itself was hot, so that's not bad either.\n\nBecause of the open kitchen right next to the communal tables, you're free to walk up and watch them plate every dish in the small intermissions between your courses. Of course, once you walk up to the open kitchen, you realize they must be doing the prepping and cooking somewhere else, because the open kitchen is really just for plating. After all, can you imagine that the chef wants to talk to you while he's cooking something? No, I imagine it would be difficult. Still, as they were plating, I noticed that it's practically a tag team of 4-5 chefs per prep table, working around and over each other. Another chef came by and said \"everyone, it's 7;40!\" and all the chefs that were prepping at the time chanted \"7;40!\" which goes to show that timing is important for this meal to work.\n\nMost of the dishes featured local vegetables that were in season, and although my boyfriend doesn't like vegetables, he didn't have a problem with this at all. \n\nNOTE: because everyone's tastes are different, it's obviously hard to imagine a meal where you enjoy every dish coming your way. Naturally, it's almost impossible, and though I didn't think I was much of a picky eater, there were a few dishes that I finished but was not as fond of, so please keep an open mind and enjoy your time here.\n\nEach course challenged your impression of the ingredients' taste and texture.These courses were not ingredients that naturally complemented each other, but instead showed thought and finesse as to how to make these ingredients work together. Each dish challenged my impression of the ingredients' taste and texture, with innovative pairings and great contrasting features. \n\nOverall, the performance led on by the Lazy Bear team was brilliant from the decor to the setup to the mood set by them, and we were simply guests enjoying a show.\n\n- great casual experience with rustic cabin themes incorporated in everything from the building to the bathroom walls to the glass stemware.\n- super friendly waitstaff that seemed to be enjoying themselves as well, and answered any questions we had and were seen but not heard. Despite being there and everywhere, they did not hover at all.\n- food that challenged your impression of cuisine to the next level with creative combinations and unique texture that isn't easy to be found.\n\nTLDR: come once, and I'll be coming again.", "author": "Zoe H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-06", "description": "This is easily a 5 star place. It is hands down one of the most incredible and memorable dining experiences I've ever had. Probably up there with French Laundry, but much more affordable. From head to toe: ambiance, service, taste, execution was done perfectly to a T. On arrival, a friendly and non-pretentious host gives you a quick tour of the communal tables and the open cooking space. When you first enter, you think that you're the first one to arrive at the home made dining party. By doing so, it removes all the crowds that line up for restaurants like these. The space by the way, is gorgeous. You are then escorted upstairs to a lofted bar area where drinks flow and you are served the 'snacks'. It's a cozy homey space that makes you feel like you're at a friend's cabin living room. The snacks included: whipped scrambled eggs shot (accompanied with bacon, maple syrup, and hot sauce). Breakfast in a shot glass. How delicious. Get it all in on one bite. Then came albacore with aji amarillo, ricecracker, foie grase, cavier in a potato wrap (to die for!), hot sweetbread with pickled water melo, concord grape soda with lemon verbena in a mini cute beaker glass. The nerd in me loved this! That was just the 'appetizer' portions. \n\nThe Main Course: \nSpelt & Rye Dinner Roll with house cultured butter: incredible butter, creamy and I just ate it off the butter knife sans the roll\nTomato panzanela with  carpaccio of miyazaki ribe eye, avocado, padron conserva, seaweed foccaccia: the marble on that beef glistened like pearls\n\nLegumes with summer squash, bell pepper, fennel and saffron sage: beautiful presentation \nEgg yolk poached with farro verde, onion, spinach: the yolk does not run regardless how you cut into it, it challenges food science\nCorned grits with lomobush: this easily the best dish. something as simple as corn. I licked the bowl clean in a savage way while nobody was looking.\nGrilled berkshire pork shoulder with peach and stone fruit: they somehow made the pork taste like almonds\nMiyazaki ribeye cap w/ tomato, black garlic, eggplant: delicious beef again that just glistened. This time it was the star of the dish rather than a compliment. Whoa that was delicious.\nWhite sesame green melon, sake lees, rose geranium: My gosh this was so refreshing and good. The dofu in this made my mouth so happy! \nVanilla ice cream with chicory, cashew and potato chip: Who would have thought? After having this has made me change the way I eat vanilla ice cream. I now sprinkle all my ice cream with a lays potato chip but its just not same. \n\nThe Treats: The meal ended with a semi-freddo with Vietnamese coffee caramelized apricot with hazelnut and milk chocolate, red velvet macaroons. \n\nThe meal was realistically a 15 meal course of small bites. We were soo stuffed at the end! The service might I add was impeccable and everything well thought out. We had a friend in our group who has a very unique allergy to citrus. They pain painstakingly prepared each dish with a citrus substitution without compromising quality or taste. I thought for them to go out of the way for one person was phenomenal! Lazy Bear, you outdone yourself. Often times, when you dine in San Francisco, it is basically a smorgasbord of delicious and mind altering food. Restaurants in San Francisco has set such a high bar for food that no matter where in the world you go to, you have developed a very discerning taste. Truly lucky to have this access a stones throw away. With that said, Lazy Bear is one of the few that not only is a trip down gastronomy but also presents it in a creative and warm way. Typically, you get the cold empty rehearsed lines but at Lazy Bear you truly feel like you're having a kick ass dinner at a friend's home. People actually warmly, passionately, and proudly describe the best they have to offer you. \n\nI wouldn't hesitate to come back here if only I can get a reservation! Hey Lazy Bear, how about a reservation for my birthday in a couple of months!  Unfortunately, I gotta watch the clock and be at the mercy of when they send emails notifying you tickets are on sale. Word of advice to get a reservation, sign up for the emails and follow them on twitter. They will email the day of when tickets go on sale for the following month and twitter a week before tickets go out. I recommend doing both. The price ranges from $130-$170 (they will include gratuities when you purchase your tickets online). This depends on day of the week and time. There are 2 seatings at 6:30pm and 8:30pm every day.

They offer two seatings a night, at 6pm and 8:15pm.\n\nI wasn't able to get in the first round, but got a table last month, which I was psyched about! The ticket prices were definitely pricier than what I had seen before (I cringed a bit to be spending $330 for two people, especially for an unknown menu), but I trusted Chef Eric and his team. \n\nSuper cool dining experience. The new location is beautiful and brand new, which does make up for part of the difference for the ticket price increase! You'll dine with others around a long tables and it's definitely an experience. It's a pre-fixe dinner so everyone eats the same thing, but you can definitely request specifications if you have any food allergies.\n\nFirst, they'll take you upstairs for cocktail hour, so you don't sit down for dinner until 30-45 minutes later. The appetizers and the complimentary adult beverage were actually extremely delicious. My favorite was something that was made of egg custard and maple syrup in a shot glass. Delicious!\n\nThe meal itself was very, very good but not blow-my-mind-out-of-this-world delicious.The menu changes daily, so you never know what you're going to get. I was quite disappointed at the lack of a beef or lobster dish...but am overall happy with the  meal.

However, when we got there, the majority of people were already there and seated at all the nice seats upstairs. Instead, we were at a high ball table towards the center. While we were sitting there, the waitress moved us a little bit to make room, but there just wasn't enough room. I definitely was a little put out by it. \n\nWe got a delicious punch when we first got up there and also got 5 different dishes up there. (Whipped Scrambled Eggs, King Salmon, Foie Gras, Firefly Squid Yakitori, Artichoke Dip). All of those were delicious. I think my favorite was the scrambled eggs was the most creative (a little bit of spice at the bottom was delicious). The foie gras was probably my favorite overall because I just love foie. \n\nThen we moved downstairs and had: \nMadre's Reviver: OH MY GOD. So delicious of a drink. The bartender was also really cute and he handed me both of them. Squeeee. \nValentine's bread: the butter that came with the bread was delicious - salty and creamy. Everything butter should be. The bread was amazing too. I just wish there was more. \nSweet Pea Custard: So delicious and plated so beautifully. The custard itself was so good and the garnishes added to the dish. We all wanted to pick the plate up and lick it. \nCharred Onion Broth: They told us they also caramelized onions which made the broth so delicious. There was an egg yolk in it already and the broth was a great addition. Favorite part? Drizzled in pork fat. HEART!\nHalibut: They mentioned they did a new method of cooking the fish - sous-viding the fish at a low temperature. honestly, it made the fish so tender and moist. Probably my new favorite way to eat fish! The rest of the garnish were all spring veggies from the area. \nRabbit: Delicious loin and sausage. Definitely was a new way to eat rabbit. It also came with snails - ones that were grown in Napa and all they ate was basil. Totally the best stuff I learned all night. When I ate the rabbit and snails all together, it gave this great taste. \nLamb: Rack of lamb was delicious. The farro was an interesting addition to it. The chefs also suggested that we should pick up the rib and gnaw on the fat. \nRhubarb: Palate cleanser. The foam was interesting, but the sorbet was probably the best part. \nOats: The financier was a great lavender flavor, even though I didnt love the lavender flavor in the ice cream, but the other parts were delicious. The cherries were tart and delicious. The caramelized honey and yogurt were a great combination - makes me think that's what I should do with my greek yogurt from now on. \nTreats: There were 5 different ones. None of them were amazing like the first dessert, but they were all really good. (caramel sesame cream puff, frozen smore, sangria jelly, coconut caramel, and black forest macaron.)\n\nThe overall experience was great. The servers were so attentive and always folded the napkins when we left the table. They always served us together as well. So great!\n\nOverall, such a great experience. Definitely one of those things you could do every so often (like once a season or so). \n\nProtip: get tickets at noon when they open up. Tuesday nights at 5:30 are the cheapest you can get so if you want the full experience but don't want to pay all the money-go then. Eat all the food, and take all the pictures!

The whipped egg, with maple syrup and chili oil (I think) was light and almost like a cloud. Very nice and set the tone for what to expect for the rest of the night. The pumpernickel toast with cauliflower (dungeness crab replacement), Jack cheese and lardo was very memorable. My favorite of the snacks was the maitake tempura served with an creamy, onion + mushroom dip. Mmm'mmm'mmm. No shame, I spooned more of the dip into my mouth even when the maitake was gone.\n\nMy favorite dish was the duck. The lightly crisped skin. The sauce and grape that complimented the dish so well. I craved for more of it! The meat was tender, perfection. Honorable mentions: clarified buttaaaaa + super soft roll, sturgeon+caviar+butternutsquash, WAGYU! and cabbage/Brussels sprout (was suppose to be abalone but allergic) with the fennel. The cheese/sunchoke was great, but cheese flavor was overpowering.\n\nDessert! Apple Jacks macaron, spot on. Enough said.

Sometimes, but only a couple dishes that have all the elements come together.  The rest, interesting at best.\n\nService - friendly as far as the host and servers.

Well, my GF brought is here. Had I known I'd said no for even 100 bones. Go to Spruce if you want a pleasant dining experience for ~200 dollars. Food at this joint was mediocre, atmosphere pathetic.

They even signed a birthday card which was waiting for me as we were seated downstairs - nice touch!\n\nIt's definitely an experience as dinner takes about 3.5 hours.

It was so loud that we couldn't continue conversation during it-- the only choice was to stop and listen to all the notes on what we weren't having while our glasses were empty.\n\nWhile the food and beverages were independently excellent (with a few stunners and a few flops), the pairings were ok but not great-- definitely not what I'd expect at this price point.

The room smells like old firewood and the decor is beautiful.  They were consistent with the mountain/cabin theme and it shows through the entire restaurant.  The space is very cool with the room upstairs as well as in the main dining area.  \n\nPassed Appetizers/cocktail hour - The cocktail/reception area is a little bit small.  We were standing in the middle of the room and it was helpful to have tables throughout but hard to settle in.  Out of the 4 appetizers that they passed, I'd say that I LOVED only 1, one was just okay, and 2 were not that great.  The best passed appetizer was certainly the foie gras cracker.   The whipped scrambled eggs with bacon and maple was okay (a little too weird for my wife to enjoy), I believe the other item was a salmon piece which was forgettable and I can't remember the 4th.\n\nFirst course - Delicious.  This was actually my favorite part of the whole meal.  We were served a foccacia situation, a sweet pea situation, and a soup situation and all were delicious.  I was pretty full after the passed apps and the first course.\n\nMain - This is what knocks my experience from a 5 star to a 4 star.  The main course is supposed to be the best part!  We were served 3 mains: a halibut dish, a rabbit dish, and a lamb dish.  The halibut lacked flavor and the vegetables that were served with it didnt feel like an ideal pairing.  The rabbit was interesting - mostly because I don't know if I've ever eaten it but a little too gamey for my taste.  The lamb - I don't even remember what it was served with.\n\nDessert - 5 stars!  The rhubarb dish was DELICIOUS.  As were the small plates and the oats dish.  Paired with our coffee this was the perfect cap to the meal.\n\nThe bill was confusing b/c we didn't know if we had already tipped.

It's such a fun concept that celebrates the act of dining together and coming together over a beautiful meal. I love that you plan for this dinner like it's a concert by getting tickets. It builds anticipation. And the fact that everything is paid for going in (no fumbling of credit cards or splitting checks at the table) makes the whole night just more relaxed and enjoyable. \n\nI recommend going as a group of 4 - the setup of the night encourages a group setting. The space felt very casual yet refined and elegant at the same time. The service felt luxurious but none of the staff members were intimidating - they were all friendly and I especially loved that the chefs invite you to come talk to them as they're prepping their next courses. \n\nThe food was bright, beautifully plated, and tasty. I won't spend time going into my favorite dishes since everyone receives the same menu and you don't really order anything while you're there (except drinks) - but it was all delicious. \n\nI've recently been having this first world problem of not being excited about any restaurants in SF because we much access to too many great chefs and restaurants, so nothing stood out to me anymore. My feedback for every restaurant I was trying was \"Yea, sure, it was good\" or \"Yea, it was seasonal New American food, it was fine.\" I'm thankful that Lazy Bear was able to get me excited again! Again, it wasn't just the food I loved, it was their whole idea behind the act of dining.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-28", "description": "After months of trying to win the Lazy Bear lottery for the underground dinner, I finally scored a pair of tickets to the permanent brick and mortar location of Lazy Bear on its opening weekend!  The new ticket system (available online https://tickets.lazybearsf.com) enables one to buy tickets without the need for a lottery system.  The general plan will be to release tickets on a Friday for a couple weeks in advance.  Join the mailing list or follow Lazy Bear on twitter to get the latest information.  The restaurant will serve dinner at 6pm or 8:15pm for forty people at each seating.  You buy tickets online for a specific date and time and then dinner/tax/gratuity is completely paid for before you enter the restaurant (unless you order drinks from the menu).  The tickets are non-refundable (but are transferable) so make sure you can definitely attend your specific date before purchasing tickets.  \n\nI have never walked into a restaurant and been so truly impressed, however walking into the door of Lazy Bear immediately brought a smile to my face.  We were greeted by the hostess immediately.  The space is beautiful.  Your eyes are immediately drawn to the open kitchen in the back where David and his team are busy at work creating dinner.  After being \"checked in\" we were given a quick tour of the place and whisked upstairs to the lounge area where the bartender was serving punch to the guests.  The punch was a pineapple/whiskey cocktail, and was quite delicious.  Groups of guests were lounging around, looking out over the restaurant from this bird's eye view of Lazy Bear.  \n\nThe first five courses were served upstairs in this \"cocktail party\" atmosphere which is unlike anything I've ever experienced.  These courses were single bite starters and were all inventive and delicious.  It seemed like each course got better and better.  After the starters were finished, parties were escorted downstairs to their carefully assigned seating around the large communal tables.  Although you will most likely be sitting between two strangers there was plenty of room and it did not feel uncomfortable.\n\nWhen ordering the tickets online I decided to go all out and order the beverage pairing ($50) to go with the meal.  It was a combination of specialty cocktails and wine the really paired amazingly well with the meal.  If you decide to BYOB there is a $30 corkage fee. (That fee is waived if you order the beverage pairing).  \n\nThe service was truly top notch.  The staff was well trained, knowledgable, and seemed truly happy to be working at Lazy Bear.  As was true with the underground iteration, each course was explained by one of the kitchen staff.  \n\nAlthough open only a few days, the entire Lazy Bear experience was polished and nearly flawless.  The organization required to ensure people with dietary restrictions/allergies received the proper food, and that those with the beverage pairing receive their beverages is pretty daunting.  \n\nThe food itself was phenomenal.  Definitely one of the best meals of my life.  The menu changes therefore I will not go into detail about each course, however I can truly say that I enjoyed every course.  Some of the courses were a bit out of my comfort zone, but pushing the boundaries is part of what makes this type of dining experience exciting.  For example, I typically do not like tomatoes (one of the few foods I do not like), however a few of the courses featured tomatoes.  Yet they were incorporated into the dishes in ways that made them not only palatable, but actually delicious.  There aren't too many restaurants that can make an ingredient I generally do not like into an integral part of a dish I enjoyed so much I would want seconds!\n\nThe cost with tax and tip for dinner and beverage pairing was $220.  Expensive, but completely worth the money.  This is hands down a 5/5 dining experience.", "author": "Paul W."}

There was a gussied-up oyster, which was great, a scrambled egg and bacon shot, which was fantastic, and one or two other nice little bites to get us warmed up.\n\nMeanwhile, it was the last night to take the Jeopardy online quiz, so GF and I showed up a bit early and the staff was terribly accommodating and helpful, letting us both log on to their wifi and take up a corner of the room to nerd out on our laptops (a yearly tradition).  Special thanks to Akeel who helped get us set up.\n\nGF and I took notes on all the sit-down courses, in the handy little notebook the staff handed out.  These consisted primarily of giving each course a band name.  They were as follows:\n\n1. The Salty Heart (seaweed focaccia with salted butter)\n2. Fern Gully Revival (sweet pea custard with mint)\n3. Soup Toast Rebellion (toasted grain broth with egg yolk fudge and porcinis)\n4. Asparagus, Asparagus, Asparagus, Fish (warm halibut sashimi with asparagus and hollandaise)\n5. Saddle Rabbit (rabbit with morel mushrooms; alt. title: Morel's Holy F**k!

For the first 30-40 min, you start out upstairs. When you walk in, they give you some mulled wine to warm you up. (*=favorites)\n\nSome of my favorite dishes were from the \"Snacks\" we had upstairs.\n1. *Whipped scrambled eggs: a sous vided egg, whipped so it's light and airy, served in a small tall glass. The bacon made it smoky, and their house hot sauce and the maple syrup at the bottom made it an awesome breakfast like dish.\n2. Kumamoto oyster: with granny smith apple froth and fennel pollen \n3. Caviar: with a smoky sourdough puree and a sourdough crisp. I love caviar\n4. Duck liver mousse: on a graham cracker with cranberries, herbs; I liked the graham cracker\n5. Sea buckthorn soda: They juiced it and made a syrup from the musk, with foam on top. Unique, but I didn't love it \n\nDownstairs: seating at long tables\n1. *Toasted brassica infused broth: the broth was very light and clean, and there were pieces of cauliflower, broccoli, kohlrabi, pickled turnips, fried kale \n2. Spelt and rye dinner roll: their version of a Parker house roll with spelt and rye for nuttiness, topped with brown butter salt. I love salt. Their house cultured butter uses buttermilk with cultures carried forward for 3 years now. It was cheesy and tangy\n3. *Bay scallop: from New England, served raw.  The shell held a satsuma and pine oil citronette that you pour over the dish. It was topped with pine tips, fresh mandarin oranges, partially dehydrated mandarin orders, succulents, buddha's hand, and a meyer lemon zest.  The pine and buttermilk panna cotta underneath was really smooth. I never thought pine could go into a dish, but this one balanced a lot of random ingredients together really well\n4. *Sunchoke: all the parts of a sunflower. There was a sunchoke puree with cheese, sunflower petals, sunflower sprouts, and sunflower seeds. the jus was made of sunchoke and chicken.  The stand out was actually the sweetbreads (sauteed in butter, garlic, lemon juice, fried). The texture and flavor were really good. The egg yolk confit was more like a fudge texture than runny. It was a very creative and interesting dish\n5. *Butterball potatoes: potatoes that were only 2 weeks old, super tender, almost like gnocchi?, super sweet and creamy. It came with green garlic, stinging nettles, chantarelles, crispy seaweed, crispy nettles. On the bottom was a German butterball potato-sea lettuce-nettle puree. I didn't know I could enjoy potatoes so much\n6. Sonoma county duck: a sausage made from the legs and wrapped in collard greens (good flavor), quince roasted in duck fat (with cinnamon, black pepper, ginger), and the duck breast. The breast is aged in house for 7 days, so it ferments and tastes almost like ham.\n7. Pork belly: from Sonoma. Brined for 24 hours, braised for 40 hours to tenderize it, and they did a good job of rendering out the fat.  It came with fresh and smoked beet juice with apple cider and a green apple + onion soubise. Various sorrels (wood, French, red vein) and mustard greens added earthiness. The smoked beets were also really good with the pork belly\n8. Hazelnut: coffee ice cream with candied meyer lemon peel (loved this lemon peel with the hazelnut and coffee). It also had a brown rice pudding cooked in toasted hazelnut milk, cocoa crisps, hazelnut coffee, and a brown butter puree. This was a pretty interesting take on hazelnut (ie not just hazelnut and chocolate)\n9. Persimmon: Hachiya semifreddo (I prefer ice cream), salt roasted fuyu (encased in salt and compressed, pretty salty), pickled persimmon puree. Then there was a malted sponge cake (subtle). The root beer pudding w/malted milk and tempered chocolate tasted like a whopper!\n\nFinal Treats: \n1. *Vietnamese coffee: frozen vietnamese coffee covered in white chocolate and on top of a chocolate cookie \n2. Chocolate bonbon: with pine and yuzu, topped with fleur de sel. I liked the yuzu and how they rounded out the meal with more pine\n3. Macaron: a half macaron with cayenne, cinnamon pear, caramel\n\nOf the wine pairings, the most interesting ones were the blanc de blanc, the Nebbiolo, the pinot, and the sparkling tokaji at the end. Our sommelier told us a lot of interesting stuff behind each of the wines. We also tried some cocktails (they have a full liquor license now.)\n\nI love the open kitchen, and you're allowed to go over and look and talk to the chefs.  They encourage you to talk to the people sitting next to you, but it wasn't as communal as I thought it would be (I don't love communal dining).  The tickets came out to around $230/person (including tax and 20% gratuity), and drinks were extra (beverage pairing for $85), so it can add up, but it's a unique experience that's worth trying.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

I would have liked to give 3.5 stars but am rounding up here\n\n- Ambiance - the upstairs cocktail room is well laid out with little nooks for groups of people to congregate. The tiny, ultra modern tables are a disaster, though, because there is not enough space for drinks and plates. The decor of the main dining space is lovely with nice decor\n\n- Food - I really liked the food. There is a major focus on creativity, flavors and clearly a lot of effort in even the smallest of ingredients. The consomme dish was lacking but the sweet pea custard, halibut, lamb were delicious. \n\nWine - a tad disappointing. Our party, and the parties around us (some who came for the 5th time) generally agree that the wine pairings are not worth the money and folks should stick to cocktails. The first wine was terrible (lacking in flavor and finish - the server was appalled because apparently it was expensive!!), the second couple of wines were creative, the dessert wines were decent as well. But not worth the $75 wine pairing price tag. Stick to cocktails, folks\n\nService - this is where most of the improvement is needed. The appetizers and dinner service felt rushed, wines were poured with no explanation on what they were and why they paired well with the food. Even though there were probably one service staff for every 2 patrons, one several occasions, we had to wait for requests, or for the one wine server to come discuss the wine by which time the other servers were ready to clear our plates. Also, someone in our party had food preferences (which were disclosed ahead of time) but the servers had to be reminded on multiple occasions regd the preferences. \n\nAll in all, the food is the star, the wine is a poor distant cousin and the service needs more polish. Worth one visit but there are too many fine dining options to go back here.", "author": "Rumesha A."}

It seemed too early in the evening and too close to the end of the work day to be an enjoyable start to the meal. Quite to the contrary, this seating was great.\n\nAfter checking in at the entrance, which has beautiful candlelit stone walls, they take you up to a balcony section. The restaurant looks like a large loft apartment, with the seating area upstairs and the completely open kitchen and dining room downstairs. They served four appetizers and drinks before dinner, which gave a nice amount of time to wind down after the day before being seated. Not a huge fan of the communal tables for upscale dining experience. There wasn't much mingling between parties and you either feel like you are bothering the people next to you with your conversation or eaves dropping theirs. \n\nThere were some very nice touches throughout the meal that were a pleasant surprise to see, given the setting is somewhat alternative in nature. When getting up to use the restroom the staff folded and placed the napkin. The restroom was immaculate and had cotton hand towels. The glassware was Luigi Bormioli. Most of the knives were Zwilling, except for one setting which used a knife with an antler handle. The tables had very elegant candle settings that were glass cylinders filled with stones and water with a floating candle. \n\nThe background music was a bit eclectic, ranging from the Postal Service to Pearl Jam. Really enjoyed the cups the coffee serving used, which were apparently designed by the chef in conjunction with a local ceramist. However, given the nature of the ticketing system, it was a little odd to be charged for the coffee. It would have been a nice touch for this to be included.\n\nThe food was also very good.", "author": "Michael S."}

I had heard great things about this inventive chef and his food and having been raised in the restaurant and hotel business - a born n bred foodie from womb to tomb - I was genuinely excited to try for a ringside seat in spite of the unusual lottery process but what the hell, I thought. It seemed democratic, so I joined the throng. Months and months passed and so did every lottery without the reward of seats. Over time,  each request submitted at the appointed was dispatched with eroding enthusiasm. Dashed upon the rocks over and over can have a wearing effect, don't ya think? I began wondering if I would still be excited if I ever did score seats. I never did. \n\nIt was announced that Lazy Bear had finally settled into a permanent space and would be releasing their first round of tickets. Yay, we cheered !  Surely Mr. Barzalay would be dispersing tickets in time release fashion FIRST to the hundreds of Charlie Buckets who had remained faithful to and through the agonizingly disappointing lottery process, some for YEARS, who never, in spite of their dedication to the cause, found their golden tickets. Surely this was the fair thing to do ??  \n\nNO. Well, yeah, it WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FAIR THING TO DO but NO. That's not what happened. Mr. Barzelay elected to release tickets.... concert style... to the general public once again but with zero consideration paid to his now beaten-down band of faithful lottery players - ZERO. To add insult to injury, though theoretically it was concert style, it was all online. You couldn't even line up at the venue or a StubHub for a first come first serve shot at tickets. Nope, you had to start from scratch all over again and this time participate in a to-the-second-and-not-a-second-before- Thunderdome madness of online clubbing that crashed Lazy Bear's site on their first round, presumably from the hundreds or perhaps thousands of bots deployed to increase odds of scoring in this Grand Theft Auto nightmare of trying to get tickets to ...a restaurant.     A restaurant! \n\nAfter an exhausting and fruitless wrestling match with their site, being kicked out,being told to pay even tho no tickets had been granted, etc,  I wrote Lazy Bear an email expressing my grave disappointment over the infuriating 30 minutes I wasted ( not including the hour waiting around counting the seconds before launch to be ready to execute my bid like the early days of eBay). I received a quick email back saying the site had crashed - well no shit - and that they would try again early the following week. They relaunched the ticket clubbing the following Monday with the same three hour notice of ready-set-Go at 12 ! By the time I even saw the announcement I was en route to the airport and could't even get in the game. \n\nBut it's not a game, or it shouldn't be anyway. This is bloodsport and it shouldn't be that either. People are already profiteering on Craigslist, selling the tickets at twice their face value. It's actually kind of screwed up. At this point I don't care how good the food is that I'm not getting to eat for because if I ever were to get tickets, frankly the enjoyment of the meal itself would be so overshadowed and battered by the J.R. Tolkien like odyssey of misery it took to get there,  that I'd probably just want to throw a plate at him, and grab a burger from In n Out as I drive home in the World of Warcraft tank I had to use to mow down my competition to get the tickets to begin with. I hope it fits through the drive thru.\n\nThough it's closed now, if I could I'd take waiting in line for dinner in freezing cold weather at Danny Bowien's Mission Chinese in NYC, over this cold, faceless, voiceless, online gaming bullshit any day : At least at Mission you could enjoy a real-life experience; a beer from the free keg offered when the line got too long or a chat with other dedicated patrons of the queue in anticipation of dining. More importantly, at the end of that wait there was the just and dependable reward of a warm table inside and hot bowl of something delicious. \n\nSorry, Mr. Barzelay. You may be raking it in from the hype of these time release demolition derbys , and you may in fact be the second coming of Thomas Keller, but you've turned down, turned off and beaten up a lot of potential loyal customers in this bid to be different or more efficient or whatever you were going for. Sour grapes? You bet. And frankly, you hurt a lot of  peoples' feelings who were trying to support you by just holding out blind faith in your talent and some hope to eat in this promised land of food.

Of the 12 courses there were some dishes that made my top 5 list for best things I've eaten this year (probably in the past 12 months). One of the recurring dishes is their bread and cultured butter, which is basically a tangy complex butter that's been aging for about 2 years now. Extensive use of the sous vide cooking method shines in the meat courses (fish being the standout) and the lamb you could basically cut with a spoon (the knife they gave for it wasn't serrated, so it was basically a spoon).

Imaginative food, locally sourced, beautifully presented - every course complemented the next well. The only course that, was surprisingly disappointed was the under seasoned rather bland lamb dish that looked like it was going to be a highlight of the meal. Still, it's really difficult to fault Lazy Bear for any aspect of the food. From the pre meal snacks to the original and fun desert dishes - this was one of the best meals I can remember having in recent months. Not quite 2 Mich star fair, but definitely 1.5!\n\nThe only bum note in our whole Lazy Bear experience should be one of the most fun. This won't make much sense but It feels as is they're trying to put SO much emphasis on the food that they end up detracting from the dining experience in the process. Between each course a chef comes out and laboriously explains every detail of the dish - to complete silence from the assembled diners. With a 7 or 8 course menu this meant that conversations barely started before we had to shut up and listen to how a specific foam is made, or how original a particular taste was going to be. Sometimes it's best just to let the food speak for itself and in a set up (communal tables) that is designed to get people 'mingling' the long and frequent interruptions became annoying and a little pretentious after a while. \n\nStill, now Lazy Bear has a home it is getting as much attention as it should - believe the buzz/ hype because this is the best new food in the city since State Bird landed.", "author": "Sam E."}

I just ate here and was a bit torn about my experience. \n\nFirst the good. \n\nI like the spot overall and cool decor cause I'm a camping guy and the whole theme with the decor is a nice attempt at feeling away in a cabin. The format of how they move you through the night is nice also considering its a community style dinner. You're greeted by nice staff who quickly give the low down on how things work. \n\nYou then head upstairs to a loft area where you help yourself to water and they serve a complimentary cocktails and mingle with guest. They also bring out 4 \"courses\" - think amuse-Bouche size - of tasty sampling a to warm you up for dinner.  \n\nThe food was great - highlights were the pork jowl and duck. Desserts were basic but good also. \n\nThe bad. \n\nThey seat you at pre-assigned seats, like camp. Yes I said I like camping, but I hunt and like to set up camp where I want.\n - I'm not 13 and in Boy Scouts anymore. \n\nIf you are a couple you are also forced to sit across from each other. While I love staring at my wife, I also like to be close and put my arm around her. It would be nice to have a choice here.  Especially with volumes here, sitting close would allow better conversation with your honey. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend you do not do the wine pairing. I have never been to any restaurant that pours about 1oz (possibly less) wine pours. There was a point where they served me a Riesling wine for my next course. Then, before I even took a sip, another waiter came by moments later to ask \"are you still working in your white wine\" - I replied that she just poured it and then he said \"oh, wow\" and looked very confused. Case and point. $65 for 4-5 glasses at their pour rate - I recommend bringing your own bottle and paying the $30 corkage. \n\nFinally. This place is hipster heaven.  If you love it or hate it - you've been warned. Not my cup of tea.  Especially considering the conversation you get from the liberal simpletons. \n\nThe concept of this place is great.

We were ushered upstairs to enjoy the first five snack courses and our punch. We got to overlook the seating before us finishing up their meal and observe the chefs at work in the open concept kitchen. The scrambled egg shot was tasty with a hint of bacon and a kick of spice at the bottom. We loved the foie gras torchon on a brioche sliver because how could you not now that it's back! The grilled seaweed focaccia was smoky and the butter was perfectly complemented it was just the right amount of salt. The pea custard was a beautiful dish and surprisingly flavorful. We thought the rabbit sausage and loin with snails (apparently fed a basil based diet) was amazing. The lamb was the standout dish. It was moist, rich, savory and accompanied by farro and dates. It just made you warm from the inside out. The boyfriend had no qualms about gnawing every last piece off the bone. Desserts were great. They didn't overwhelm you but were so different. The refreshing rhubarb ice had a great white chocolate creme and cleansed your palate for the next dessert - a supposed spin on yogurt and granola but so much better than my breakfast. The sweet bites at the end were great! We enjoyed the frozen s'more and coconut caramel most. The space is beautiful, chefs are top of the line and food simply delectable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-30", "description": "UPDATE: David reached out with an explanation - Lazy Bear rarely adds additional seafood for pescatarians. This makes a lot of sense to me; it'd take way too much effort to source additional ingredients to accommodate a single diner. On the night I dined, they had been laser focused on executing some new dishes and hadn't considered the substitutions as thoroughly. That is also a reasonable explanation and makes sense to me. For those considering dining this month, they've remedied this, so maybe don't let my singular experience dissuade you from writing Lazy Bear off.\n\nOn the whole, I do feel like Lazy Bear is still a well-thought dining experience. You can see it in the ambiance, you can feel it in the way they've set up the communal dining, you can hear it when they introduce each dish. And, I feel that they are (usually) thoughtful about the composition of the food. So, I'm keeping this rating and plan to revisit in the future.\n\n---\n3.25 stars. My review in a word - underwhelming. Also, your money is better spent elsewhere if you don't eat meat. \n\nBefore everybody gets thrown in a tizzy, let me just note that dinner was a fantastic experience and I liked the atmosphere a lot. But, the experience just didn't match up with my (perhaps too high?) expectations. Maybe it was the fact that I requested a pescatarian menu, which cramped the chefs' creative license. Maybe it was the fact that pop-ups and communal dining are no longer a novelty, especially in the Bay Area. But, I really think it was the fact that 2 tickets, 2 drinks, and corkage for 1 bottle ($50) put me out nearly $500. That's like, two fancy dinners at Chez Panisse, but you get about 1/2 of the food. I realize that quantity isn't the end goal here, but the economist in me couldn't help but lament at the opportunity cost. \n\nMy main disappointment was the approach to substitutions. I normally don't eat meat, but I indicated to the chefs that using animal fats/broths would be okay. I figured I should be flexitarian to enjoy the full experience. Usually, constraint breeds creativity but I think in this case Lazy Bear just got lazy. Most restaurants will sub some sort of protein if you're not going to have meat. Not the case at Lazy Bear. \n\nA few examples from our 12-course meal... descriptions are followed by nearly verbatim comments from the server (service is attentive but fairly impersonal):\n- Foie gras, brown rice, some veggies // \"Hi Sherry, so you're getting the same dish, without the foie. Yea?\" Ummm... yeah okay, I mean, what choice do I have? \n- Lamb tartare // \"Hi Sherry, so you've got the same garnish, but we're serving you goat cheese instead of the lamb.\" The cheese was pretty tasty and foamed (a new preparation to me), but \n- Duck & duck sausage // \"Here we have a carrot that has been grilled and charred. And you've still got the quince on the side, yea?\" So people got 2 pieces of meat and quince, but I got a single carrot and quince. \n- Wagyu // \"Okay, same deal - you've got the same dish as the others, except you have no meat and more of the garnish, yea?\" Great, my partner has this fantastically marbled piece of meat and I have an extra piece of eggplant and a few extra baby tomatoes. \n\nEven though I didn't feel like I got a lot of value for my ticket, I do recognize that the kitchen staff are exceptionally talented. That carrot was tender yet substantial; how they avoided making it mushy is beyond me. And they coaxed some amazing flavors out of the starter snacks (my favorite was a Kumamoto oyster on a bed of tomato puree, sprinkled with a touch of tomato leaf oil. Sublime, sweet, subtle). The butter is AMAZING - made from 3-year-old bacteria culture, well-salted, super creamy... the rye and spelt roll was just a convenient excuse for me to inhale that rich butter. \n\nListen, Lazy Bear. Substitutions are fine. But at least make it a true substitution rather than just taking ingredients away. Give me a 1 for 1, not a 1 for 0. Everything was delicious, and your kitchen turns out fine dishes. But I feel pretty shorted, yea?", "author": "Sherry W."}

But combined with the social atmosphere, homey decor, innovative dining experience (everyone enjoys cocktails and appetizers in a lounge overlooking the dining room before being invited downstairs to enjoy the feast) and service quality, I wouldn't be surprised if they have one if not two Michelin stars in their future.\n\nAs for specific dishes, my understanding is they change all the time, but here are some highlights from my evening:\n\n- a creamed butter made from a culture they have been keeping alive for more than a year, heightening its flavor profile\n- an oyster suspended in tomato gel\u00e9e\n- cherry tomatoes that melt in your mouth (as they say, an \"explosion of umami\"\n- a Caesar salad interpretation done with creamed lettuce and a fried anchovy for balance\n- a roasted hen stuffed (injected?) with its own fats\n- a pastry spread that will melt your palate\n\nThe only minor wrinkle was I think the beef could have been charred more--wasted opportunity there in my opinion--but the dish still worked due to the pairing with the aforesaid tomatoes. And the hen-mushroom/bean pairing was a bit off, a little too rustic for my taste. But the restaurants only been around for a couple days so can't complain...if anything, it's the risk taking in the dishes that make it so extraordinary overall.\n\nThe other feature unique to Lazy Bear is that the Chef and staff clearly enjoy what they do. By personally introducing their own dishes, they demonstrate not only passion but expertise and dedication to their craft. Not to mention their love of experimentation (shrimp roe butter anyone?)\n\nThe other thing worth mentioning is the price. For a tasting menu at $120 (+$50 I believe for the drink pairings) there isn't a better value anywhere in the city. They could easily charge $250 or more for the 3-hour evening, which I'm sure they'll figure out eventually so get in while you can!\n\nIn short, superb experience, 6/5 stars, will go again.", "author": "Foodie B."}

Of all the dishes, my loves would have to be the foie gras (ate it before I could even snap a pic), the fried-chicken-like sweet bread, the rhubarb dessert, the pistachio/beet/chocolate dessert and the iced latte. Would highly recommend and go there again.", "author": "Jesse M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-04", "description": "To preface what looks like an average rating, I am comparing this to other restaurants where you'e paying $200 a head for food and $100 a head for drinks/wine. \n\nSo we purchased tickets online based on the strong reviews and press for Lazy Bear. We did the late seating and got to the restaurant about 15 minutes ahead of it. This was a good idea, as you can get a seat. I would even suggest 20-30 minutes ahead of time, as it quickly filled up. The room is very nice room as is the ambience. The decor is nice, but almost tries too hard. The first bite of food didn't come until after 9pm and after 3-4 mouse bouche and almost two hours, we were seated at10:30, they apologized, as it was the 2nd night of a new menu and they had a few problems. As for the drinks, we didn't do wine pairings, as my spouse wasn't drinking, so I order a few cocktails and then went for the wines by the glass, the wines by the glass were not great (no old world, just California, despite having a nice list of Old World wines). That was disappointing for me, but I suspect wouldn't be a problem for other Bay Area natives. I would recommend the wine-pairings if you plan to go. With the long wait time to be sat for the main courses and the small amount of food, there were a few comments from the people around us that they should have eaten more before. Not something you want to hear when you're paying $200 a head. When we did sit down the staff describe every dish to the room, including the bread and butter, which may have been the highlight (outside of the beef). With that said, we were into hour 3 now and as we got into course 6-7, we were frankly thinking to ourselves, hurry up and discussing how we make a graceful exit. The main courses were hit and miss, their take on minestrone, a big miss, the lamb crudo was good, but trout dish, which held up the service very ordinary and both desserts were not worth the wait. If you're a vegetarian or even a pescaterian, don't bother. I felt for the person across from us who didn't eat meat, as ricotta was substituted for the lamb crudo. When they described the 9th course, I was thinking \"can we get this hostage taking over with\". I'm all for a nice long dinner, but by the time we left it was ~12:30.\n\nSo I'm sure that many people liked the experience and if you like tasting menus, communal tables, a 3+ hour meal and a unique experience in a nice room, sure give it a go. Unfortunately,  you're paying more for the staff and ambience than the food. For me, the food was good, but not great. there are many other restaurants in the Bay Area, especially for $200 a head and the food is better. To that end, I wouldn't go back or recommend it.", "author": "Seann G."}

Pre-paid.  Dinner with wine pairing was around $300 per person.\nI have a raw onion allergy - they were very accommodating (THANK YOU!).\nWhen you arrive, you start upstairs in a lounge with champagne / light cocktails and \"snacks\".  The snack bites were really unique and delicious.  Luckily we arrived early, so we were able to get seats.  Those who arrived later had standing room only (that would suck for an hour).\nAbout an hour later, you move downstairs to a big, open room with two long tables.  My guess, total seating was for 60 people.  The kitchen is open at one end of the room and guests are invited to get up and watch the food prep.\nAfter the snacks, I feel like the wheels fell off the wagon.\nWe had wine pairing with our dinner.  I was surprised that they only served white wine varietals.  No red.  So we purchased a bottle.  That was disappointing.\nThe items served were (9) courses for dinner and then (3) desert snacks.\nA dinner course included a \"rye roll\" - yes...just a piece of bread.  The items were sorely disappointing, probably the most disappointing was the celtuce stem with chicken skin.  I am a fan of chicken skin, but this was just really \"WTF\"!  I would have enjoyed celery with peanut butter over this item! They served two proteins:  pork and beef.  Very small portions.  Luckily, I had the rye roll to nibble on!\nI have dined at French Laundry, as well as many other Michelin Star \"high profile\" restaurants (Michael Mina, Twist - just to name a few).  I would not put Lazy Bear in that category.  It's a very expensive hipster place (with only linen napkins - no table linens) that will fall out of fashion soon (I could only hope).", "author": "Kelly A."}

Yes i said \"event.\" Its really good concept that breaks up the monotony of traditional dining. \n\nI loved the way before every course the chef who created the it comes out and explains what is going on on the dish in front of you. It shows diners that chefs are real people. I say that because some chefs are naturals at speaking to crowds and the ones that are not are painstakingly exposed. But it takes nothing away from the meal or the night. \n\nI give 4 stars for 2 reasons. First, the dinner is timed because each course is scheduled to come out at a certain time. If your a slow eater that likes to enjoy your food, be prepared to have dishes taken from you before your finished. Lastly the wine pairing are a little hit and miss, with more hits than misses. I might be nit picking here, but there not much to not like at Lazy Bear. I would definitely come back to Lazy Bear and probably keep the chit-chat to a minimum.", "author": "Michael V."}

Everything was delicious and the experience was really fun as well. \n\nYou start with about 7-8 snacks upstairs and a cocktail or two. Be aware that if you have an 8:15 reservation, for instance, you will spend the first hour being served snacks upstairs at the bar and be seated for the mains. There aren't enough seats in the bar upstairs for everyone to sit. So if you don't want to stand for the first hour (ladies in heels) come early to get a seat. \n\nThe snacks were all great. Oysters, whipped egg shooter that tasted like a deviled egg with bacon, duck fritters and whipped liver mousse, and veggies in a delicious bone marrow cheese sauce. \n\nYou start your downstairs meal with THE BEST bread and butter ever created by mankind. We had lobster poached in butter, wagyu beef, Dungeness crab soup, and even foie gras! They had it from NYE so served it special (yes!

Guests are free to go up to the kitchen and watch them orchestrate each course. The staff was great and on top of everything the entire evening, and the music playlist was on point. The remaining 11 courses were served, accompanied with an explanation of what you get to dig into.

They definitely got me full but I could have had more. \n\nDrinks:\n\nHouse Made Punch: Gin Punch that used St George along with peppercorn simple syrup. Pretty tasty to start and was served to us along side the appitizers.\n\nShiso Old Fashioned: Had this during the 2nd part of the dinner and it was just OK.  A bit too sweet and couldn't really taste too much of the Shiso.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n\nWhipped Scrambled Eggs infused with bacon and house made hot sauce - the bacon infusion really stood out and the hot sauce wasn't too powerful, blended the flavors together quite well \n\nOlio Nuovo with milk gelato, sea salt, peach compote - nice refresher after the scrambled eggs, olive oil wasn't too strong, though my girlfriend had a few coughs (means its fresh!) bits of almond had nice flavor \n\n4 part duck plate: -Liver Mousse - Hushpuppy - Slim Jim - Rillette - \n- Mousse was amazing, had great taste with a bit of funky duck after taste, Rillette  was nice but needed more texture, hushpuppy was ok, couldn't taste too much of the aioli on the plate, slim jim had a bit of a kick to it and a bit salty\n\nDashi braised abalone chowder - SOOOOO GOOD, really helped with the spiciness of the slim jim, topped with potato chips and chive oil brought everything together, best part of the appetizers.\n\nMAIN DISHES:\n\nBrown Butter Bread: I suppose this too is an appetizer but was the first dish we tried, cultured butter with brown butter on the side. Cheesy taste, good use of salt.\n\nBay Scallops with mandarin vinaigrette - Scallops were raw, which was a delightful, the vinaigrette was savory and helped with each bite.\n\nKohlrabi Soup - very comforting to have, had some romanesco along with it and honestly could have been better with no toppings.\n\nDungeness Crab with crab broth, persimmon chip, crab butter - very well done so good that I didn't even have enough time to take a picture!\n\nSquab with pomegranate juice, seeds, some salsify and two types of hazelnuts - Squab was cook perfectly, could have been without the hazelnuts int he dish but the salsify puree was on point.\n\nBeef Short Ribs  with rice grits, carrots and black trumpet powder - Typically when i eat short ribs my general feeling is that the dish is too over powering, this dish is balanced well with the carrot and carrot puree to bring some balance along with the dish, a few black trumpet mushrooms and mushroom powder really brought everything together.\n\nDesserts:\n\nKiwi dessert - Had nice taste to the dish and some buttermilk gelato on the side. It wasn't too memorable\n\nParsnip sous vide  with chocolate meringue and bite of devils cake - Personally my least favorite part of the dinner, there were two types of chocolate cake with the dish, devils and another one that was just a very hard piece of cake. It's meant to mash together with everything but it didn't take like anything in particular. \n\nParting Treats:\n\nYuzu PoppySeed Macaron - it was kind of hard to eat, but the yuzu really stood out\n\nSaffron Caramel - very sticky, had good taste to it but couldn't eat the whole bite \n\nNegroni Jelly - great interpretation of the Negroni cocktail. Very delish.\n\nPistachio Cake - Good ender to the entire meal, light and made you wanting more.\n\nAll in all the Meal was quite great.

By that, I mean that I enjoy exceptional, well-thought out food. I am married to a fine dining chef, and (I think) I can distinguish passion and thoughtfulness in a meal. The chefs at Lazy Bear definitely have the former, and the latter shows when they present the 10+ plates served on any given night. Generally, a different chef describes each course and does so with such passion that it's clear that he/she played an important role in developing that dish from inception to creation. The complexity and intrigue shows in every bite and definitely leaves you wanting more. \n\nSecondly, the atmosphere at Lazy Bear is unique and special. I feared that it may be a bit pretentious and overdone, but everything, from the complimentary house-made punch to the decor and seating arrangements made sense and worked really well. That's all I have to say about that. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Lazy Bear has a STAR in the next year (though I hope the chef and staff don't let that get to their heads and stay true to what they're doing-- cooking amazing food)\n\nTldr: lazy bear is a new must in San Francisco.

We were taken upstairs to a seating area, decorated exactly like a hipster consignment shop. Cute, curated items with a slight forest/woodsy theme. While waiting for the real dinner to begin, we were brought a whiskey punch and several amuse bouche. Be warned, you don't start eating the \"real\" food till at least an hour after your seating starts. We were all quite hungry by then. Seating in communal style: there are two tables each seating 20 and you sit next to diners from other parties. \n\nThe 8 courses following the snacks were all delicious, light, and innovative. I could go through everything but then we'd both we here forever. Ingredients included gooseberries, matcha crackers, oysters, etc. Everything was outlined in a small booklet that came with pencils for you to take notes. Instead of opting for the wine pairing, I ordered two drinks a la carte from their drinks menu: a Manhattan and a white wine. The cocktails in general were TINY; for their price I was hoping for more. The wine, however, was standard size however. \n\nDuring the meal, they allowed you to go up to the kitchen/prep area to see the chefs at work assembling these little works of food art.

Guess that was the advantage of buying tickets for Outside Lands weekend.  Anyway, Lazy Bear exceeded expectations and the well-deserved hype that surrounds it.\n\nWe arrived around 8 and were escorted upstairs to the mezzanine area.  We were promptly served some delicious punch. I'm usually not a cocktail person, but this was yum; some sort of lemon-vodka-aloe thing.  We were served several delicious \"snacks\".  We got the beverage pairing, so started with a glass of champagne (don't remember the name since they ran out of the original one, they gave us a bit of an upgrade--yay!).  Was a lot of fun watching the food prep from above, excellent birds-eye view.\n\nSnacks started with whipped scrambled eggs, which is apparently one of their standard items; would definitely make sure you get your spoon all the way to the bottom of the glass to get the delicious hot sauce and maple syrup to mix in with the eggs.  Next snack was albacore marinated in kalamata olives.  Now I'm generally not in favor of eating foie gras due to how it's made, but I made an exception for Lazy Bear.  It was served with strawberry and sorel and was buttery delicious.  Next snack was my favorite, a crispy potato wrapped around creme fraiche and caviar, kind of like a fancy Pringle, yum!  The final snack was fried sweetbreads with pickled watermelon that had some nice spice to it; cannot go wrong with something fried, especially the way they made it.\n\nWhen the snacks were done, each couple or group was escorted one by one down to their seats at one of the two 20-person tables.  We were lucky to get one of the seats up front, so had a decent view of some of the food prep.  We were served a refreshing little \"grape soda\" that was more like a mini smoothie, served as a palate cleanser.  For each course, one of the chefs came out to describe the components and prep.  Sommelier poured the wine for those who got the beverage course.  I found the descriptions to be really interesting and fun, without a bit of pretension.\n\nFirst course was delicious spelt & rye dinner roll with their house cultured butter.  Absolutely delicious.  Next course was one of our favorites of the night:  tomato panzanella with beef carpaccio (wagyu beef) with avocado, padron conserva, and seaweed foccacia.  Melt in your mouth goodness with some crispiness of the focaccia, amazing flavors!  Next was the legumes course, with snap peas, grean beens, wax beens in a butter and bell pepper relish.  The next course included a vegetable that I think most hadn't heard of before:  celtuce stem & leaves, a veggie whose stem was kind of like asparagus, but different flavor and consistency; anyway, was interesting and delicious.  Then came the fresh corn grits topped with duck ham.  It was the wonderful simplicity of corn and butter, and the duck ham kinda tasted like prosciutto.  Next came the grilled Berkshire pork shoulder with peaches, turnips, succulents, and stonefruit; juicy goodness!  The final meat course was some delicious wagyu ribeye cap with tomato, black garlic, and eggplant.\n\nThree dessert courses were served next.  The first was a very interesting and super tasty white sesame tofu, green melon, sake, and rose geranium. Next came a delicious mix of blue corn masa, blueberry ice cream and fresh blueberries, with a whiskey based sauce or pudding.  The evening ended with a trio of treats:  caramelized apricot with hazelnut and milk chocolate, red velvet cake with berries, and semifreddo Vietnamese coffee.  \n\nOverall, this was such a unique experience.  The food and service were top notch.  This could have easily been a snooty place, but it was quite the opposite.  All of the chefs, servers, and sommelier were so nice and seemed to be so genuinely in love with what they do.  While the price to go to Lazy Bear is high, the food quality and overall experience are so excellent, that I think it is somewhat worth it.  Highly recommend Lazy Bear.", "author": "Danielle B."}

I've been collecting wines for most of my adult life and have a pretty good cellar. I know what I like and I am pretty good at pairing wine and food. and I am not a price snob but any measure, but there are times when it's easy to tell a cheap wine from a higher-priced wine. 5 of the 8 wines poured retail for $20 or less and one of them I couldn't find a price for on any of the wine searcher sites. all of them were obscure wines, which doesn't have to be a bad sign, but the problem was they were not good wines, and did not pair well with the food. the pours were very light too, but even between two of us we didn't always finish the wine because it just did not taste good. Lazy Bear has a good wine list (prepare to pay top dollar) and corkage is $50 per bottle, obviously meant to discourage BYOB, but if you know wine, I highly recommend paying the $50 corkage and bringing something you know you like. even with the wide variety in the dishes, you'll be better off (IMHO) with champagne and pinot or red Burgundy, both of which will pair with just about anything. \n\nokay, that's out of the way...\n\noverall, the wine disappointment doesn't take away from the 5-star rating. the food and overall experience are well worth the price. even with all the great restaurants in SF, we're already looking forward to our next visit.", "author": "Bob U."}

They described having to freeze the ripe Hachiya persimmons before slicing them to make into chips. Whatever technique they used was great, because they were awesome. \n\n- Squab: I have a terrifying fear of pigeons, so seeing the illustration of the squab inside the guidebook had actually drawn an internal visceral reaction.

I like to eat and have eaten my fair share of tasting menus.  I estimate that Lazy Bear will become a Michelin 2 star restaurant in the next several years if everything stays at this level.  \n\nAt many cutting edge restaurants, the food is incredibly interesting with unusual flavor combinations, but all too often, taste is sacrificed in the name of culinary creativity.  The past few times, I leave a tasting menu feeling unsatisfied and money wasted.  I'm talking to you Meadowood and Saison.  After one too many disappointments, I became jaded and weary of these tasting menus.\n\nNow, Lazy Bear.  It isn't just a meal, it is an experience.  I would describe it as an exquisite meal and an interactive theater experience with a social component.  The cooking is at a very high level with unusual flavor combination that actually works - smoke trout and black apple anyone?  Yes!  Yumm!  5 small bites and 8 courses for $125 is down right a bargain relative to the two restaurants mentioned above.  Of the 13 dishes sampled, I LOVED 7 but liked ALL of them!  This is shocking to me because that never happens.  Each course is unique and delicious, very intellectual food, promotes great discussion with other diners.  Go with foodies friend(s), it will be a lot more enjoyable.  For the practical diner, you will be full after the meal, not uncomfortably stuffed, but pleasantly satisfied.\n\nFor each seating, you start at the mezzanine level with 5 small bites and house cocktails while socializing with fellow diners.  Next stage, dining room for the 8 course meal at a communal table, each course is explained in great detail by a chef and all guests are invited to go to the open kitchen, observe and ask lots of questions any time.  Everyone from the chefs to the waitstaff to the diners are all passionate and knowledgeable about food, it is truly a celebration and an education of culinary arts.\n\nThe ticketing system is business genius. It takes a little bit of effort to figure out the system, but sooooo worth it.  Run to this restaurant right now, I see Michelin stars and price increases in the near future.\n\nPs.  I personally don't mind the communal table at all, but not sure if the Michelin guide feels the same way.", "author": "Rosalyn C."}

Hubby was surprised (bday dinner), because we never had communal gastronomical dining exp before. I enjoyed the 5 starters bites, oysters jelly shot and fried maitaki mushroom are my favs and the mandarin fennel drink. Why 4 stars? I thought the food and plating were well executed. In terms of flavors, I'm not too crazy about some of the dishes and the theme was towards more French. Everything about 70% of the dishes were 'creamy milky buttery'. I'm not a fan of creamy dishes. I can handle one or two is fine. Cultured butter is butter, then trout dish also with cream, celtuce veggies also with cream, black trumpet is cheesy fondue.... after the fondue, I've had enough of cream. Becoming too heavy and rich. I enjoyed the duck (no cream) and scallops w carrots (more Asian), these two dishes need to be serve hotter. The protein gets into warm temperature quickly, because it's high ceilings (good ventilation) and it's February cold. The space can gets a bit chill after an hour or so and I was wearing sweater. Olive oil ice cream is reallyyyyy nice, it's unique and not overly sweet. Parsnip ice cream is good but super sweet, American taste buds. The caramel is nice also. I think if you put more fusion theme would be better, not just French! Creamy butter stuff makes you full quickly and not that flavorful. It's kinda flat! I love a mixture of Asian, Latin flavor more or Italian etc.... TOO MUCH CREAM and BUTTER. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars!!!! Still I highly rec this place for that special occasion.", "author": "Clemencia S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-19", "description": "We were so excited to try Lazy Bear.  We tried the lottery a few times when they were a pop up and never got in.  But the new ticket system is much easier.  We had read all the blogs and reviews of the restaurant and we knew we were in for a treat!  Maybe our expectations were high, but it was one of the worst experiences we have had in San Francisco.  We have dinned at all the top restaurants in the city, and this was the biggest disappointment.  \n\nThe snacks upstairs were good, and we felt that we were off to a good start.  The communal eating is a bit strange, as upstairs we were sitting with a big group, so they just talked amongst their group, but thats fine.  \n\nWe also did the wine paring, this was the worst part of the whole experience.   All the wines were \"different\"/\"unique\"/\"dislikable\", I had to keep coming up with new reasons as to why I was not finishing my glass.  I am totally open to trying new things and IF the wine pairs well with the food and brings out some hidden flavor, I am all over it.  And this is the fun of doing a paring instead of a bottle.  Another reason we do the pairings is that we enjoy talking to the sommelier, they are the professional, we love hearing them describe the wine, the region, the tasting notes, and how it is supposed to compliment the meal.  A good sommelier is like poet, and their passion just shines through.  NOT HERE... we were told by the sommelier that he was busy and could not take the time with us to describe the wine, yet he was able to take like 10 minutes to talk to the tech-tentious people next to us, and also refill their glasses. (I can say this, since we are both in tech, just not pretentious ;) )  I would have paid more for the wine pairing, for better quality wines, and fuller pours.  This is a party place, the music is pumping and you are sitting close to your neighbors, this would just add to the atmosphere.  Not crazy pours, but something similar to saison (of course that is in a different league).  Unfortunately the taste of the wines (notes of ivory soap, nail polish remover, and orange pledge) as well as the service of the wines overshadowed the actual food, I was so turned off by the whole beverage service.   They spend time describing the food for the whole group, maybe they should also do that for the wine?  I saw most people also did the wine pairing.  OR maybe if they had some printed notes, that told how the wine went with the food, since the sommelier was SOOOO busy and could not be bothered.  Maybe if we wore our normal hoodie and jeans, we would have gotten better service, appears thats the way to go. Also if they are so concerned with fresh ingredients in their food, \"straight from the market\", why is there only one beverage from California?  \n\nEven if the wine service would have just been EH... the food was boring and trying WAY to hard.  We started off downstairs with a corn custard.  It is the height of summer why would you throw fresh corn in a custard?  It should be able to show in all its fresh glory this time of the year, corn custard is what you make when you have some frozen corn left over in the winter.  Then they shaved some truffle on top.  This was like no other truffle I have tasted, it was lackluster and flavorless, there was no melt in your mouth-ness about it. When using black truffles, maybe they need to be heated?  OR at least put on hot food?  My husband has spent some time in Australia and asked where they were grown, the waiter said \"all over\"... i doubt that!  We were also surprised by the inconsistency in the pork shoulder.  My husband had a very dark piece of meat, and it was thick, mine was a very fatty, but flavorful piece, I am not sure how the chef intended it to be.  I assume he did not want it like my husbands, because even though it was sous vide it was DRY!  that is the whole point of sous vide.  One last note, as it seems to be their MO was salt, the chef even mentioned that they love salt, and that sure shows.  Things were salty!  \n\nWe feel like maybe this is the place to come for your FIRST pre fixe, but once you are over 25 and have gone through at least one IPO do yourself a favor and try one of the actual BEST restaurants in SF.", "author": "Jessica G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-04", "description": "This place is pricey, so I have to hold it to a higher standard. \n\nFOOD--The Good\nThe courses were interesting, creative, well-executed, elegant. Some we loved better than others, but that's to be expected. Those are subjective tastes. My personal favorite was the morel dish with the fudge-consistency egg yolk. Cured carrots made my list, too, as did the caviar \"snack\" on mascarpone-leek custard. \n\nFOOD--The Bad\nFor an 11-or-something course meal, I was astounded to really only have one meat dish. Was the meat dish good? Yes, it was a great lamb chop. But I heard from another friend that on his visit, they served some amazing beef that was even higher grade than kobe. I was surprised not to have a beef course at this sort of event, and relieved not to have brought my husband, who would have been livid. I love vegetables, and all the vegetable courses were outstanding, so well conceived and prepared. Each vegetable was the star of its course, and spring was the theme. But I'm serious: only one meat course? No. Just no. \n\nThe other point I want to focus on is desserts. There were two desserts followed by an ending of petit-fours. The two desserts were truly underwhelming. The first, a rhubarb thing, was simply pleasant. The second had dull flavor and terrible texture (the texture was not an accident; the pastry chef explained that she was going for that... it was inspired by her childhood memories). I simply didn't eat it. It can't be easy to be a pastry chef: you have to be inventive, and that very inventiveness often ruins a course that, when you stick closer to classics, can very well speak for itself. I seriously didn't think the desserts were worth the calorie intake.\n\nSERVICE--The Good\nOur service was spot-on, everything arrived promptly (except my espresso at the end, which I'd hoped to enjoy with my sweets, but came after both dessert courses were collected). Everything else was spotless service-wise. I should note that we had the 6pm seating; I can't speak for how smoothly things run later on at night.\n\nSERVICE--The Bad\nWith so many courses, obviously the portions need to be small. However, with so many courses come SO MANY explanations of the courses. I found that the explanations, while interesting at first, lasted longer than the food. You could be done in three bites and they are still listing the 25 ingredients and 15 techniques that composed those three bites. That many courses coupled with explanations disrupts the conversation you're having too much. \n\nI contrast this with The Kitchen in Sacramento (run by the Selland group). They serve closer to 7 courses, and do a similar schpeal about each, but the explanations are more colorful and engaging, and the food outlasts the yapping. They also don't have communal seating, which is something to note if you're not a fan or if you want a deep, intimate convo with your companion. Their quality is also better. I gave this place here 4 stars so I could give The Kitchen 5 stars. I live near SF, but that place is worth the drive to Sac; if you're into this sort of dining, I'd choose The Kitchen.", "author": "S R."}

Once I booked thru their reservation website, I was very thrilled to take him to this awesome place! \n\nIt was an absolutely unique experience! \nFor the very first menu, light snack was served at their mezzanine. I personally liked the fried spring onion, but my husband disliked its left oil on his fingers. (Even they gave us a napkin.) \nAnd the combination of Shigoku oyster & kiwi wasn't that preferred to both of us. \n\nHaving conversation at long dining table, among people who we have never met was very interesting.\nSo far so good...\nOne of my favorite was the trout. Perfectly cooked and the harmony with the other garnishes were amazing. \n\nHmmm, sadly..I think I expected too much from this one star michelin restaurant. \nExcept their main menu, other dishes were not that impressive.\nMy husband requested the vegetarian menu in advance, however they sometimes served non-vegetarian dish. (They kindly apologized to him, and he was asked to have new dish, also they gave us some morning buns for the breakfast.)\nBut, I was so disappointed especially, the two kinds of dessert.(Banana & Koshi Hikari)\nThey had too strong spices, so got my nerves.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-04", "description": "This was our second time dining with Lazy Bear. Our previous experience with their underground dinners was amazing. When we heard they were opening their own space, we had to check it out. \n\nThey greet you at the door then immediately whisk you upstairs into what feels like a living room - comfy couches and chairs, fun throw pillows and blankets. On the way upstairs they point out all the highlights, offer coat check, water and complimentary cocktails. Just a few minutes later they began bringing the appetizer courses. I hope  they include the whipped eggs on every menu as they're delicious! Whipped egg, maple, hot sauce, chives - brilliant! (There might have been bacon in there too)\n\nAfter the appetizers they seat each group downstairs individually. Then, let the courses begin! We opted for the wine pairing. I would definitely try the mixed pairing next time. Our wine arrived before the courses each time with a short intro and a chance to ask a question or two. Once everyone has a plate, the chef responsible for that dish goes over all the components. Each chef has a different quirk which is part of what makes Lazy Bear great. The kitchen is completely open and they encourage you to visit and ask questions throughout the meal. We were lucky enough to have the first two seats at our table! We were super excited! We have also lucked out and had great groups next to us each time. \n\nCourses that left a mark: whipped eggs, dutch crunch and butter, sea scallops, pork jowl, s'mores. Although, it's hard not to list everything as it is all great!\n\nThe final tidbits: If you plan to park, give at least 20-30 minutes extra to get there. They have cotton towels in the restroom - plus 1 star in my book just for this! The price is steep but worth it for an experience beyond just a dinner out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-24", "description": "Probably one of the coolest dining experiences I've done. You'd easily see this kind of food in a stuffy gussied up place. But the experience they've created here, in my mind, is what you'd see if a chef designed a dinner as if he or she was cooking for their colleagues.\n\nThe experience starts by being invited to the mezzanine floor for a \"cocktail hour\". You and your party are free to mingle about and will be served various bites. I believe we were served four different bites. For me, the highlight was the whipped egg with maple syrup and hot sauce, basically breakfast in a glass. Really tasty and innovative. You can also help yourself to some spiked punch, with this particular mix being tequila based. As far as I could tell, you could drink as much as you want (I had about 4 cups).\n\nOnce the cocktail hour is up, the parties are called down to seat at the communal table. Once you've been seated, the head chef introduces the meal and as each dish comes out, a chef introduces it explaining the ingredients and/or inspirations of the dish. One of the cool things is that you are encouraged to get out of your seat and come to the chef's table and get an up close look at the chefs preparing the meal. They even encourage you to ask questions and have conversations with the staff. This no boundaries approach is really interesting and kind of encapsualtes what this place is all about.\n\nOne of the neatest things too is that each guest gets a passport sized notebook that summarizes each dish, with room to write so that you can include your own notes or thoughts about the meal. Really REALLY cool.\n\nWhile the experience itself was really cool, I wasn't really inspired by the food. While it was executed and plated beautifully, it's hard for me to pick anything that really stood out. For me, the real star was the scallop dish as that was perhaps the most well cooked scallop I had ever tried. As for the remaining dishes, they were all impeccably plated and tasted delicious, but to me just a tier below Saison, Coi and Benu.\n\nI can't wait to go back again. I hope next time that their food will be a little more inspiring.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

A rustic styled gem with a beautiful open kitchen.\n\nFood: Above-average, but did not knock my pants off, especially for the price. Chefs put a lot of focus on sourcing of ingredients which was great. The simplest dishes that highlighted a small number of ingredients were the best. Many dishes quickly became overly complicated and a bit of a mess in terms of flavor. Presentation was always excellent.\n\nWine: Very good, but the somm was extremely disappointing. After the master somm encouraged me to go with the reserve pairing, I never heard from him the remainder of the night. They split the diners into 2 large tables, and there were 2 primary assistants that went around pouring. Everybody else with the reserve pairing was at the other table, and I was surrounded by those with the regular pairing. The guests at my table were given great service with excellent descriptions from one of the assistants. I was the lone duck that received the last pour of the reserve pairing almost as an afterthought. The assistant somm barely managed to tell me the varietal and vintage before scurrying off. I had to yell after him to ask what it tasted like and why they selected it as a pairing. I never got good answers. Any time I tried to make eye contact with the master somm, it was avoided, very strange. There was a beautiful 1986 cab that was given almost no special attention. It was good, but I sure would have liked to hear the master somm tell me a bit more about it.\n\nChefs: Quite a mix. Some were incredibly gracious, friendly and seemed happy to have us as guests. I was most impressed by Eddie who served and described the dessert courses, I believe those were my favorite. Unfortunately, others were straight up arrogant. They served a corn dish that was delicious, so I inquired as to the origin of the corn and what made them select it. I specifically asked if it was sweet white corn or not. The only response I got was \"it's the best fucking corn you've ever had is what it is\". In fact, that basically summarizes the description of every ingredient. The \"best fucking\" butter ever, the \"best fucking\" beans ever, etc. I'm not sure if success has bred arrogance or the other way around, but I found it off-putting.", "author": "Chris D."}

I will say that the price is steep for most, but it most certainly is worth it.\n\nThe interior was very warm and inviting. A nice blend of rustic and modern touches to the furniture and general decor. I loved the large installation of brush that hangs over the dining area, gives it a very organic feel. You are seated in Eames DSR style chairs and a large wooden communal table. The plating and cutlery are pretty generic, save for a few complimentary pieces to certain dishes...one of my dishes came accompanied with knives that had antler handles. \n\nNot a single dinner course was remotely disappointing.

The ticket prices vary depending on the night you purchase, and on top of that they add a 20% service charge so we paid around $470 for 3 guests, not including the beverage/cocktail pairing.\n\nDO NOT BE LATE! They start serving food promptly at 6:00 and if you show up late you're going to miss courses. The first snacks are served in the upstairs area - get there early for sitting room but the communal dining experience is kind of awkward. Unfortunately the servers were not always timely in the way they brought out the amuses - granted, it's hard to systematically distribute courses when everyone is just kind of sitting around all over the place, but it's awkward when the people sitting next to us received their second amuse while we had yet to receive the first.\n\nUpstairs we had 7 snacks and a complimentary mead-based punch beverage - the whipped scrambled eggs with bacon/maple/hot sauce, shigoku oyster, a tray of 4 duck treats (duck liver mousse on a toasted brioche, duck confit hush puppy, duck rillette, duck slim jim), and a duck bone marrow/cheddar fondue with vegetable crudites. Of the snacks, the duck liver mousse and the fondue were my favorite. Although they're famous for the whipped scrambled eggs, I wasn't that impressed with what was essentially egg-flavored foam with bacony hot sauce.\n\nAfter you finish up the snacks, they lead you down for the rest of the meal, and a different chef will come out and explain the dish to the entire room.

It's hard to have a conversation and you kind of feel like you're perpetually in small-talk mode or half eavesdropping on the people next to you. They have an open kitchen so you can talk to and watch the chefs arranging each of the dishes.\n\nFirst, they brought out a brown butter brioche with cultured butter - SO GOOD! The brioche was perfectly buttery, with the brown butter adding a nutty tone. The cultured butter was also incredible - its aged for 2 years, adding a really sharp note.\n\nNext we had a dish with four different types of sorrels, basil-fed snails from Napa, near-raw spot prawns, geoduck clams, and barley that had been crisped in oil - solid salad-type entree. Then a charred onion and ham broth soup with a perfectly poached egg yolk, pickled apple, and scallion. Unfortunately my soup didn't come with the pickled apple.\n\nThen the mains - we had a butter-poached lobster cooked with saffron in a lobster reduction sauce  (my favorite dish of the night!) This was followed by squab with foie gras and pear. I was a big fan of the squab as well (probably my second favorite dish), the pairing of pear with the richness of the foie gras worked really well and the crispy skin of the squab was seared perfectly. After the squab was a wagyu ribeye marinated in Vietnamese-style fish sauce with this Thai-style lemongrass sauce - tasty, but I wasn't that impressed.\n\nThen the desserts - honestly these were the biggest disappointment of the evening mostly because they added hot sauce to dishes that I felt didn't need it. First, we had a yummy kiwi-based palate cleanser with buttermilk panna cotta, guava jelly, and meringue. This was followed by a sticky toffee pudding that was tasty if not for the the shock at tasting hot sauce accompanying the creme fraiche, butter sorbet, and toffee/date/walnut-y cake. They then brought out a presentation of small treats - a rose-flavored macaron (once again, dusted with spicy powder), a caramel (my favorite of the desserts), a campari jelly, ice cream sandwich, and mocha cream cake bite. We also ordered an iced coffee to go with dessert and it was incredible - definitely recommend!\n\nDefinitely a spot going to at least once and the perfect gift for foodies!", "author": "Justine L."}

But get there on time/early or you will short change yourself the experience. And hope that you get sat next to interesting people as it's a long affair (3+ hours). Neither of us was a fan of the whipped egg -- it just tasted like unsweetened egg nog to me, without the cardamon/nutmeg, but pretty much all the other 11-ish dishes were very good to sublime. Favorite was the Wagyu beef -- seriously the best beef we've ever had, and our palettes have tried the best (though not real Kobe beef in Japan). 2nd favorites were the oyster and duck. Since the menus change daily, as can the chefs, I imagine that it could be hit or miss, but our weekday night was fab.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-15", "description": "Style over Substance:\n\nI'll get to the food but first let me mention the parking and ticketing: \n\nStreet parking spaces in this area are like unicorns - they simply don't exist - and there is no valet. Took 30 minutes to find a space in a garage 5 blocks away.\n\nTicketing for Lazy Bear is really where the issues begin and go on and on: The difficulty getting tickets due to limited batch at a time, online releases which sell out within an hour is what drives the hype, but the dining experience itself didn't live up to it. This concert ticket release model ( as well the rest of Lazy Bear's concept) is borrowed from Grant Aschatz' celebrated Alinea in Chicago which earns it's continued success, not through the concert ticket hype, but because the food is exquisite in execution and presentation: Aschatz is a gifted and visionary chef with years of experience training both as sous chef under Thomas Keller at his famed French Laundry and as executive chef to Rick Tramonto & Gail Gand's seminal restaurant, Trio;  a restaurant that pioneered most of the presentations seen on the plates at Lazy Bear, though sadly having very little of the same depth, clarity and incredible flavors as those of Trio's, French Laundry's or Alinea's. Unlike David Barzelay whose experience is limited to staging in a few notable San Fran restaurants and who is self taught , Grant Aschatz dedicated years training under luminary chefs and mentors, fine tuning his craft, creativity, knowledge and skill, developing his own culinary voice and paying his dues  until he was ready to strike out on his own. Alinea is a masterwork, and I'll buy tickets all day long at those high prices because you get what you pay for and come away knowing it was worth every penny as you savor the memory of every wondrously surprising delicacy that deceived and then delighted your senses. You will NOT receive anything remotely close to that at Lazy Bear, except the price tag.\n\nI admire Barzelay's entrepreneurial spirit and think he has great potential. But I grow increasingly concerned with this trend of chefs who think it's not necessary to put in the hours that it takes to master their skills and sell style over substance using hype to substitute for experience. I don't care that he's not classically trained but his lack of restaurant experience is on high display in his borrowed theme restaurant in far too many ways both front of the house and back. There were some inspired moments in our Lazy Bear dinner which included the first three amuse bouche ; whipped egg - probably the best of the evening-  fois gras mousse on brioche, and a lovely oyster. It dipped into a valley of just okay through the seated meal segment until desserts and 'treats' were served which at least ended the meal on a high note. In between there was a beautifully cooked scallop but it was done no justice by a bland squid ink sauce among other rather indistinguishable flavors on the plate. The pork was almost great, but dry, sigh..\n  \nThe service is bizarre and unskilled, far more suited to a wedding. In fact, this dining experience is almost exactly like an expensive catered wedding: You sit at two long communal tables mostly with people you don't know and courses are delivered en masse by a stringer of food runners - I refuse to call them servers when  they provide no real service). For 20% 'service charge' forced at time of purchase, you get 10 cents worth of service in house. As for beverages, If you deviate at all from the pre-paid concept as we did by ordering a bottle of wine at the table, it's a disaster : We ordered one wine pairing and a bottle of chablis.The pairing was never poured in sync with the dishes and the bottle took 20 minutes to arrive?. When I told the runner to just open and pour, he had to take it back to a bus station to open it before returning 10 minutes later ! For 2 glasses of wine during hors d'ouvres, an out of sync pairing, a late running bottle and 10 cent service, we were charged $160 with 20% ADDED TO THE BILL. I was livid. For the beverage service ( or lack thereof) at least, I should have been able to leave a tip which reflected the service and been able to do so at MY DISCRETION\n      Bottom line. We'll never go back. When you spend $500 on a meal and are forced to pay a service charge up front ( which they insultingly try to pass off as a courtesy of not having to pay at the end ) you should receive the benefit of excellent professional table service. Or at least the courtesy of a reach around. Barring that, Lazy Bear is lazy indeed: It wants you to believe it's revolutionizing the dining experience when really, all it's doing is stripping away professional dining service and demanding to be paid for it anyway. There's some marginal, some good and sometimes even inspired food being run to the tables, but it's so inconsistent and falls so short everywhere else that in the end , it is SO not worth it.", "author": "Food C."}

They really want you to have the pairing, but if you don't, you get a very limited selection (4 red wines and I think the same number of whites) and not very good ones at that. And one of the reds was $40. BY THE GLASS! And they won't let you have the wines they are pouring for the pairing by the glass. Huh? What's up with that?\n\nSo Lazy Bear, if you are reading this, come on.

Similar to many of the reviews, I applied countless times when they had their lottery system but always failed to get reservations. When they came out with the new ticketing system last month, my friend was able to score us tickets for the opening weekend at their permanent brick and mortar location! YAY!\n \nTIP: Join their mailing list at lazybearsf.com and you will be notified when tickets go on sale. (mine would always end up in my spam inbox so make sure you check that).  My friend was on the ticketing page at 11:57am and bought tickets before 12! This was probably just a glitch but definitely try and maybe you'll get lucky :)\n\nEnough about the frustrating reservation process, let's talk about the experience: \n\nThe experience itself was amazing and unlike any restaurant i've been to. After being greeted by the host, we were escorted upstairs to the lounge area overlooking the communal tables and open kitchen. We were served pineapple/whiskey punch (good, but pretty strong!) and waited for the exciting evening to begin. The crowd consisted of mainly young people either on dates or with groups of friends. We saw people wearing hoodies and jeans to couples more dressed up in cocktail attire (some guys even in suits!). There is no dress code so feel free to wear whatever you want, but I would probably recommend something more casual than fancy. \n\nThe \"Snacks\" were served upstairs in a cocktail party environment where the waiters brought out each starter on a platter. These included: \n\n1.) Whipped Scramble Eggs, Bacon Maple, Hot Sauce\n2.) Damson Plum Brulee, Chicken Liver Mousse, Brioche, Sorrel\n3.) Charred Tomatillo, Beef Jerky, Creme Fraiche, Radish \n4.) Sweet Corn Custard, American White Sturgeon Caviar\n\nAll of these starters were good (mainly bite size), but my favorite would have to be the sweet corn custard. Perfect custard consistency with nice subtle flavors of sweet corn... And who wouldn't like caviar on top of that?\n\nAfter we received all the \"Snacks\", we were slowly escorted downstairs to our assigned seats around the two communal tables. Our tasting menu for September 28, 2014 consisted of: \n\n5.) Bay Laurel and Molasses Bread with Cultured Butter & Buttermilk: the bread was very moist and I liked the tangy buttermilk mixture. \n6.) Chilled Lettuce Soup with Little Gems, Summer Squash, Fried Anchovy, & Parsley: So interesting! Unique interpretation of the classic caesar salad. The flavors of the chilled soup were really good. I didn't really care for the fried anchovy though. \n7.) Delta Crawfish with Carolina Gold Rice Grits, Spot Prawn, Cucumber, & Celery: My favorite main dish of the night! I really enjoyed the crawfish salad wrapped in cucumber and the sweet bbq-like gravy. I'm usually not a fan of grits, but this was good.\n8.) Before the next plate on the menu, they brought out an extra course of crawfish roe butter (using the crawfish in the dish above) and Biscuits: I liked the salty sea flavor in the butter, but thought the biscuit was average. \n9.) Guinea Hen with Butter Bean, Chanterelles, Fines Herbes & Hen Jus: Probably my least favorite dish of the night. While the hen was very moist, I didn't think the sauce was that flavorful and there were too many beans on the plate. \n10.) Seared Sungolds, Smoked Beef Striploin, Basil, Amaranth & Tomato Raisins: I personally was not a fan of the salty smoked flavors of the meat, but I really liked the tomatoes that popped in your mouth, bursting with flavors. \n11.) Pluots, Pluot Consomme Gelee, Myoga, Ginger Curd, Shiso, Mint: Super refreshing (very gingery and minty). A nice palette cleanser before the desserts!\n12.) Sourdough, Scotch, Pears, Earl Grey, Chrysanthemum: My favorite dessert of the night. I loved the pieces of bread combined with the subtle tea flavors, asian pears, and yeast ice cream. So good!!\n13.) Treats-Macarons, sesame ball with chocolate ganache, berry \"jelly\", frozen s'more, sous vide caramelized cookie dough: All pretty good except I wasn't a fan of the sour jelly/gummy-like one. \n\nThere is no doubt that the food is extremely creative and inventive. Definitely some of the most unique combination of ingredients I've ever had. With that said, I was also disappointed with a few of the dishes and wasn't blown away like many of the reviews I've read. There were also some inconsistencies with the plating where my friend's piece of smoked beef was significantly smaller than all of ours (I would say almost half the size.) If we're paying $150+ per person, I would expect the portions to be around the same. \n\nThe menu changes frequently so it really depends on what you get when you go and if you like the ingredients that are used. My food experience can be very different from someone else's tasting menu, so keep that in mind. Overall, the service was great and I loved the unique fine dining experience.

I mean it is not just a couple of dishes that were overly salty, every course except dessert was very salty. The chef likes salt... he said that himself at the introduction about the \"F*** amazing dinner roll\" and the butter which he put in a ton of salt. I believe in salt, but unfortunately, the salt masks a lot of flavor from the fresh ingredients. \n\nWe did not arrive early enough to grab a seat upstairs for appertizers. Not sure I (and my lower back) enjoyed standing for an hour like most of the millennials there. The party seated on our right at dinner was a large party of 6 so they did not talk to us and the party of two to our left was on a romantic birthday celebration, so they did not try to talk to us either. It was just fine. \n\nSome of the other reviewers said they did not like the desserts but for me desserts are the highlight of this meal. The opinion gap is due to what one perceives desserts to be... I believe the pastry chef is of Asian descent and her creations somewhat reflect her heritage. The three courses of desserts are not overly sweet, they were refreshing and really cleared my palate after eating courses and courses of very salty and rich food.  We (all Asians) were all commenting at dinner that most Americans would not like the white sesame dessert because it is not very sweet and the flavor is very subtle.", "author": "Eleanor C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-26", "description": "my husband said it's the best dining experience ever! I've followed this restaurant since it's pop up days and I think it's been enough waiting. I was a bit put off by the ticket buying process and tips were all included. I worked in restaurants before and I'm perfectly ok with earning the tips and I don't have a problem tipping well. but I guess that's the way things are now a day. This place is so good, they can command that stuff. but it was all worth it once you arrive at the restaurant.\n\nservice:\nwe were nicely greeted upon arriving. the people there were more than happy to see us and wait on us to use the bathroom, before walking us up stairs for the first a few courses. when we were leaving, I talked to another person asking about my coat, no problem, he got my name and got my coat. the service through out the dinner was impeccable. \n\ncrowd:\nmy co-worker who has been to the restaurant really recommended the second seating, but I was only able to get the first seating. it actually worked out better for us. there appeared to be two different crowds, the second seating is more of younger people and the first seating were older. it could be just our night. We really enjoyed talking to people who have young kids like us and other people who have had quite a bit of life experience like we did. if you don't want to sit next to some so called yuppie techie (that's what ppl say on yelp, I'm fine with those people, I work in tech, too. I don't know what I am, ex-yuppie techie, now mother of two young kids?), go for the first seating. when you are done eating, it's already 9:30. If you have kids, yeah, time to go home, since mine would be jumping on my bed the next morning at 7:00 am. \n\nfood:\nwe really love the creativity of the food. highlights in order of how tasty it was:\nseaweed bread with fermented butter: first I was like, are you serious? I'm not a carb person, and that is a big chunk of bread and lots of butter. but after they explained the butter has 2 year old bacteria in it and tasting the seaweed bread with it, it became my favorite dish of the night. yes, very strange for me. but I do love seaweed A LOT!\nscrambled egg mousse: this was served up stairs, in a little glass. a bit spicy and savory. \nsquat with porcini mushroom: again, not a squat person, but the meat was super tender and went very well with the mushroom. \nsalmon with cucumber: a good spring refreshing dish.\nsoftshell crab: perfectly breaded and fried.  \npenna cotta: not a great fan of ginger, but the ginger flavored penna cotta was just a right amount of ginger with raspberry flavor. the ginger didn't over-power, which I was afraid of.\nmulberry: there were a couple of mulberries in one of the dishes, I forgot which one, but it was so good and sweet. never had mulberry before.  \nfoie grass dessert: although this wasn't a foie grass dinner, we had some foie grass in the dessert. again I wish I had remember the name of the dish, it was some sort of chocolate ice-cream, mini macaroon thing with foie grass sauce.\noysters: they were cooked, but still very tasty.  \npotato: very creamy. the chef explained most of the potato we eat are harvested months ago, these were harvested two days again. you can definitely tell the difference.  \nthere were probably a long list of other dish I forgot, but it was a great night of amazing food.\n\noverall, it was a really fun night out with my hubby. we enjoyed the social aspect as much as the eating aspect. we are so glad we went. if you are adventurous, this is the place for you. they don't do vegetarian that kind of stuff, so you have to really be willing to eat everything. even for me, I felt like my boundary got pushed a bit with the ginger and the bread, but it all worked out! a lot of restaurants try to do exotic and cool stuff, but it's rarely that a restaurants can get it right and this place does.", "author": "Cicie W."}

I had the beverage pairing and this made the difference between four and five stars for me, especially given the cost. \n\nOf the snacks given upstairs, I enjoyed the caviar with potato the most. Two delicious bites, definitely wanted more! Also, the gin cocktail was really good. A glass of champagne was the first \"beverage pairing\" and was served upstairs. \n\nFor me, there were four stand out dishes served downstairs. First, the bread and butter. Man, this was delicious. If I could have eaten two of anything, this would have been a top contender.  The tomato panzanella, with wagyu carpaccio, was phenomenal. This was four perfect bites. The pork shoulder with grilled peach was outstanding. What was best, though, was the ribeye cap. The meat was perfectly rare, had a rich, fatty taste to it (without being chewy). This was delicious. \n\nThere were other courses, but they weren't as strong as those four. I thought the rabbit was rather bland (admittedly, though, the vegetable in that dish was intended to be the star). The white sesame \"sweet dish\" was really different, but I liked it. The blue corn whiskey ice cream was really good, as were the three small bites to end the meal. \n\nThe beverage pairing consisted of champagne, a rose, three whites, one red (syrah), sake, and red ale. There was a really interesting sauvignon blanc, but I thought the sake and red ale were misses. Also, with some pairings we had an explanation and history of the beverage, but with other pours they just poured and gave a terse statement of what we were drinking. Also, I ordered coffee at the end (when a staff member came around and offered) and it was brought at the same time as my red ale...the timing was off here. If i returned I'd skip the pairing and order a couple of cocktails or wines by the glass. \n\nWe had fun at Lazy Bear and really enjoyed our meal - thanks!", "author": "Brian J."}

The expense of this place is what ruins it.\n\nThere isn't anything particularly bad about the food -- in fact, most dishes were interesting (with the exception of the wagyu beef that was cold and chewy), if not exactly exceptional -- the problem lies in the restaurant's emphasis on style over substance. Each dish is tiny, I mean, really, really small. I realize this is fine dining, but I've eaten at a number of 3 star michelin-rated restaurants, and no one would dare serve such small portions. After paying this much, I shouldn't be craving a cheeseburger to satisfy my hunger after a 3 hour meal. Another example is the fact that for your first 4 courses (or snacks as they call them), you actually spend your time in an upstairs lounge where you're encouraged to \"mingle\" with other guests. The idea of mingling with a bunch of \"foodie\" strangers is absurd and ridiculous enough in itself, but not nearly as ridiculous as the idea of having paid close to $250 per person, only to have confused waiters wandering around unsure of who to offer their bite-sized snacks too (having paid for an $80 drinks pairing, I shouldn't have to remind anyone to...actually bring my drinks by).\n\nOverall, I think the experience was okay, just not justified by the price. If I had the choice to spend close to $250 for a restaurant in San Francisco, I would definitely take my money somewhere else.", "author": "Luis M."}

Rich Table has food that is as good, also for 1/3 the price (or less). SPQR too.  And I couldn't help but feel like I was surrounded by people who were trying too hard.

At the beginning, you wait for dinner as they prepare and they give you Hors d'oeuvres. Similar to a wedding, I suppose. But a lot better than the fingerfood at most weddings. When they seat you down, they pile on a lot of small dishes (but you leave full at the end):\n* Butter and bread: The butter was aged and tasted cheesy. The molasses really moistened the bread. I need to start adding molasses to bread I make. \n* Chilled Lettuce Soup: Very creative! They tried to recreate a caesar salad and they won. I hate anchovies, but I loved the one that was fried in the soup.\n* Delta Crawfish & Grits: Creamy creamy grits. The gravy was light but not overly so. Seafood was fresh. They also made a roe butter of the fish parts afterward that was another perfect snack before the next dish. \n* Guinea Hen: They injected the poor hen with its own fat. As a result, it was juicy and tender. The beans served with the hen also must have absorbed a lot of fat, because they were extremely buttery. \n* Tomato Raisins + Steak: Tomatoes were the actual winner on the dish. They popped in your mouth. I have never heard of tomato raisins but they should make them a staple. Sweet but not like grape raisins. Great texture.\n* Sourdough and Ice Cream: I have no idea how much butter they baked the Sourdough bread of this dessert in and I don't want to know. It was AWESOME. \n\nThe Ambiance: A lot of groups, but a fun atmosphere. You're forced to talk to each other, which can be a lot of fun because most other diners appreciate good food and there is a shared interest there.\n\nThe Experience: Difficult, but worth it.\nMy husband heard they were opening a brick and mortar. Since he was flying out on a business trip on Friday, he had me set an alarm at noon and book tickets for us. I did so... exactly at noon on Friday. The site, of course, CRASHED exactly at noon. Turns out hundreds of people tried to log in at the same time. I tried for the next 40 minutes, frittering away my lunch, until I gave up. On Monday, I loaded the site at noon. I was 2 minutes late and the tickets were almost all in others' carts by the time the page loaded. BUT hey! I got some :).", "author": "Sylvia L."}

Or B) Write it now while I still had it fresh in the memory of my mind and palette. I chose B) because I would have felt it to be disrespectful to Lazy Bear for me to wait. In essence making me a Lazy Bear. The name itself is simply sarcastic to the efforts of Chef David and staff from the moment you step through the door.  \n\nMy first tip of the day if you choose to go to Lazy Bear is if you are voyeuristic in any way choose a later seating.  What Lazy Bear does that was so unique is they have a waiting area that overlooks the communal dining space. This is absolute genius in that like most things voyeuristic it is a tease to what is to come. You can look at the guests in their final courses oohing and ahhing to the dessert bites they are putting in their mouths. As you snack and drink on the bites served to you by hand by the meticulously friendly staff you can watch up to 40 sets of eyes rolling in the back of their heads like end of a greek orgy. Making your mouth immediately water anticipating your turn at the table. \n\nI admit I walked in with all the hype in the world thinking about all the great meals I've had wondering where it would stack and in the end it was one of the best if not the best. Sheerly based on the people around me and working that evening it was amazing.  It's almost they paired the food with the personality of the staff and it's patrons. It is truly fun to sit amongst a table of strangers brought together by food that they had heard about from their friends, internet, or the press. One does not stumble upon Lazy Bear you must buy a ticket like it is a well known Broadway show. \n\nI can sit here and write about dish after dish but odds are you won't try anything I had. I can simply tell you that they truly love food and love serving it to you.  I actually don't want to give away the service details as it's part of the show so I will leave those details.  I will leave you with this.  I have never experienced a marriage of space, food, drinks, comradery, and music done so well. (note the music was a song list from a hostess that had no intent of pairing but it did. They have mentioned that may happen in the future) When you are there make sure you dive right into it all head first.  What I mean by that is be social and interactive it truly makes the experience that much better. I will however apologize now if you sit by some prudes who are anti-social in behavior.  My friend an I were lucky to be surrounded by two great couples that shared in our food orgy and two of which we plan to meet again at another restaurant in the future. \n\nIn short Lazy Bear has mastered communal dining and made it an art like their food and their people. One of the most amazing experiences in a restaurant I have ever had. Period", "author": "Joco F."}

My BF, however, states that he rates Lazy Bear ahead of the French Laundry, so that says something.\n\nTwo seatings: one at sixish and the other at eight thirty.  We had the eight thirty time slot and didn't leave until close to midnight, so be prepared to be there for about three hours.  \n\nYou arrive & get taken upstairs to the mezzanine area where you will be offered cocktails (at cost), complimentary punch (or cocktail of some sort), and champagne if you're doing the beverage pairing.  We also had four one-bite small plates while we were in the upstairs area, which consisted of an egg foam with hot sauce (9.5/10), an oyster with wheatgrass foam (I wasn't a huge fan of the wheatgrass foam, but I get what they were going for), beef tartare (9.8/10), and goat cheese three ways (9.7/10).  I love me some eggs, raw beef, and goat cheese, so I felt really lucky that these were in three of the first four dishes. \n\nAfter we were upstairs for about an hour, we were finally brought downstairs for the main eating experience.  You'll be encouraged to chat with your neighbors and you'll also be encouraged to check out the chefs in the kitchen and ask them questions (as we are both big into cooking, we took advantage of this).  \n\nThe meal itself was absolutely stupendous.  We started with their homemade bread and the world's most amazing butter (this sounds so simple, but it was really fantastic).  We then had the following dishes (and I'm sure I will probably forget one).  We had a morel mushroom dish, which had morels, romaine lettuce, peas, and a perfectly prepared sixty seven degree egg yolk.  We also had the world's most amazing halibut dish (the halibut was poached in smoked butter).  The lamb is truly amazing, but I honestly think my favorite part of the dish was the juice/sauce it came with.  We were treated to an asparagus dish, which somehow managed to surprise me.  I love asparagus, but this was the most amazing texture.  We had a carrot dish, which was basically carrots, bacon, maple, and bourbon tastes (who's going to complain about that).  We had an artichoke dish, which wasn't my favorite, but that was more so because it was a two or three bite portion and we didn't have knives...so I wound up shoving the whole thing in my mouth, because you really needed a knife to cut it.  For dessert, we had two dishes: a rhubarb dish (which I didn't finish, because I really dislike rhubarbs, but that's all on me) and a \"cereal\" dish (which was basically grains/oats that were deliciously prepared with a scoop of ice cream). \n\nService was pretty spot on.  The sommelier was a character, for sure.  To be honest, at first, I thought he was more for show than actually knowing his stuff, but he proved me wrong time and time again.  The pairings were wonderful and when people asked him questions about the wine and/or grapes, he knew the answers.  Really quite impressive.  \n\nAmbiance: casual and friendly, which is different than most michelin rated restaurants.  I absolutely, 100% will go back at some point, but at nearly $700 for two people, it'll definitely be further down the road.", "author": "Shannon B."}

First, the service is super awesome starting the SECOND you walk in.  They offer to take your jacket, let you know where everything is so you're not walking around all confused, have you take a seat wherever in the loft, and it begins. \n\nMy friend and I got our first drinks, cheers and said \"to a dinner that's hopefully worth it....\" with skepticism on our faces. \n\nthey proved us wrong OVER and OVER again, starting with the first appetizer (this whipped egg thing) to the oyster (YUM and i'm usually NOT a fan), to some brioche duck jelly something something whaatttt - definitely requesting that for my last meal. a bunch of other appetizers, and then came dinner. \n\nIt's sort of arranged seating (you sit where they tell you), but you can get at anytime and go to the \"threshold\" of the kitchen to watch the chefs put the final touches on the course that is coming out next.

Like other people have said, it's on a not-great-looking street in the Mission and you won't see it unless you are specifically looking for it. Inside, the decor is fantastic. The ceiling is very high...I would guess around 3 stories? There's two long beautiful wood tables with a live edge and they have classic Eames chairs. It's just stunning inside. All the guests sit at these communal tables and the kitchen is IN THE DINING ROOM so you can watch these master chefs silently, wordlessly, making these intricate beautiful courses for everyone in the room. The food was fun and inventive. Compared to other tasting menus, I would say Lazy Bear allows itself to be more quirky, to dabble in food science on the table (we were supposed to coagulate a ginger tofu dessert at the table, though it didn't end up working! ), and to serve things like a deconstructed caeser salad which was a green soup with crouton floating on top!! The night I was there, each of like the 10 courses was created by a different chef and it was like his or her brain child. They would introduce the chef who would talk about his or her dish. Ok, now I have to mention the beards. All the chefs were like 22-35 and had the slightly demented eyes of a person who is obsessed with one topic and thinks about it all the time and they all the the most ridiculous hipster lumberjack beards. They seemed to be competing to see who could grow the most massive, outsize beard. But the chefs' beards were NOTHING compared to the patrons' beards. Think zz top in skinny jeans with a gender neutral girlfriend with a bowl cut. Anyway, lots of fun.

I, like many others, have been trying to get Lazy Bear reservation for months with no luck, through their old lottery system, before they moved to their new location. After they changed their location and reservation method, I managed to score a reservation on a Saturday night for my husband and I. I have heard so many great things about Lazy Bear before going, so I was all pumped up with high hopes and expectations. Maybe that was one of the reasons why I ended up having a slightly more disappointing experience.  \n\nI think a lot of people love Lazy Bear partly because of the pop up novelties; the open kitchen, the communal tables, the exclusivity, the friendly Chef, etc. But when it comes down to the food alone, I think Lazy Bear is getting there but not there yet. Some dishes tasted great and some were just average. For example, one of the main dishes served the night we went was grilled pork jowl. I was a little surprised to see pork jowl, since it's a bit unconventional to serve pork as a main meat dish of a tasting menu in general, so I was curious to see how it will turn out. When the dish came, I was quite disappointed to find a piece of pork fat/tendon sitting on the plate. I'm not a fatty meat person in general unless the meat is fried crispy, but the piece of fat/tendon served was soft and chewy, so obviously I did not enjoy it very much and would assume most people would feel the same way. I was also a bit disappointed in terms of value for money, since for $150/person, I would think they'll serve better ingredient than pork jowl as one of the main dish. \n\nNevertheless, I enjoyed the meal, the service, and the novelties overall, so I am still glad I went. But would I go again anytime soon? Probably not...not unless the Chef up his game on some of the dishes.", "author": "Sherry Y."}

But with expectations set almost-impossibly high after the whole ticketing situation, it wasn't quite able to measure up. The snacks were excellent, I'm voting for the breakfast shot as the best but my reliably awesome dinner date favored the celery root. \n\nThe actual table-served courses were lovely. Bread as a course though?  It was totally delicious but more of a side to me. Scallops were divine, the pork jowl was truly special. The duck wasn't really rendered as well as it should have been though. \n\nAlso, though the kitchen staff was passionate, fun, and engaging the FOH service was spotty. We had the pairings and 2 of the courses came without the beverages. By the time the bev showed up the food was almost gone. \n\nIt's an experience for sure.  4 stars. But not 5.", "author": "J C."}

We also happened to be seated in the lounge at the table right next to one Steph Curry. So there's that. But let's face it. Even if the Mr MVP wasn't there, the night would've still been nothing shy of perfection. We started upstairs with the \"snacks\" coming out in perfect order. I think there were about 8 of them? I don't recall, but it was a substantial number. A couple missed the mark, but I was thoroughly impressed by the rest. After about an hour, we all moved down to the dining room for the dinner. The two most memorable dishes were a lamb tartare with a number of sunflower components and then a ridiculously tender piece of Miyazaki ribeye. It was unnaturally delicious. (Here is where I will mention that I am a vegetarian on a day-to-day basis. But I could eat this beef all day, every day. It's that good.) So the food was amazing is what I'm getting at. Besides that, the restaurant is beautiful, the kitchen is open to the dining room so the chefs interact with the diners, and the servers are fantastic.

Like many other reviewers state, we started the evening upstairs. We arrived at 8pm although our seating was for 8:15. We still had to stand but this wasn't a big deal as we knew this was a possibility based on other reviews. We really liked all the snacks that were served upstairs. They were creative and delicious!As all the guests arrived, it started to feel cramped. The servers lost track of who that had served and had to come around asking if we got all the courses. \nAfter 5 snacks, we were escorted down to the communal tables. We were seated in he second chair from the front of the table closest to the kitchen. I went to sit down and was really displeased to see that my seat had the table's large metal leg (about 6 inches wide) right in the middle of it. Not a slanted table leg, but a large metal leg. How can I sit there with a dress on for 2 hours? I showed one of the servers this and he said \"yeah, sometimes this happens.\" What?! At almost $400 before alcohol, this should never happen! One time is too many times for this to happen at an establishment like this. There was no where else to sit so the server asked the 4 men next to me to each move down an inch. He then apologized to THEM for asking them to move. No apology to me though and no offer to be more accommodating. So there I sat squished between the metal table leg and the guy next to me.  I enjoy being communal but I don't want to sit on the lap of the guy next to me. We were so close that it was awkward to turn our heads to chat because we were uncomfortably in each other's personal space. \nThe reason this is so annoying is because clearly this is has happened before and there has been no remedy for the situation, although this should be an easy fix for a fine dining establishment. \nBottom line, Lazy Bear either needs to get different tables or sell less tickets. \nIn be mean time, we won't come back and would not recommend this place. It's too expensive for this type of experience.", "author": "CM G."}

I love how its open kitchen as if someone was cooking for you at their house and you're just in the living room. The whole concept it fun and interactive. Staff is very sweet and attentive. Since they offer you a punch but it does contain alcohol, they were nice to give me a non-alcoholic drink instead. Once of my top favorite was the soft shelled crab, beef tartar, the grilled lamb was to die for!!!! And for the dessert I would say the honeydew melon was so good. It does get sorta of awkward at first because the whole point is like a dinner party and you mingle and be a social butterfly. We sat next to this lovely couple and knowing me a can chat up a conversation with anyone it wasn't too bad. But if you're shy and quite don't be because most of the people eating with you are probably foodies so I'm sure you can find something in common. Downfall was I won't get to go as often since I'm for So.Cal so to all you NorCal peeps you're super lucky this is within your fingertips! Enjoy a good a meal and take pictures, we got lucky to get one with the man himself :)", "author": "Serena Y."}

Yes that includes all the Michelin Stars restos I've been to in Europe and Asia. And this place is exactly why those snooty \"stars\" don't matter. I was never a fan of the whole \"white napkin\" service. THIS is what dining is all about- casual atmosphere, great ingredients, great service, meeting great people and INTERACTION. I've never been to a resto like this before, I tried signing up to their underground pop-up restos a few times but I was never successful. Once they opened in the mission, I thought the experience would be different, not as personal, but the Chef made sure he kept the interaction the same. You start off in the \"living room\" area where you meet other foodies, drink cocktails and eat the Amuse Bouche - which by the way was amazing. I didn't expect to see to see the level of technique and ingredients they used. Then they bring you into the \"dining room\" where you sit with other folks and meet you \"neighbors\", the menu is printed out in a notebook format. The best part about this dining experience is being able to walk up to the kitchen, take pics and ask about the food, especially for foodies like me, I'm all about the making and preparation of the food. You appreciate the dish that much more because you know how much work went into preparing and plating one little dish, every ingredient matter. Congrats Chef! Can't wait to come back.", "author": "Ennie L."}

Finally got a chance to book at table at their new brick and mortar establishment in the mission.  The building was familiar, I recalled it was some bbq joint that was terrible...probably why they are gone now.  Anyways, dinner service on the 6pm grouping ran late...which is fine since they served punch in the upstairs reception area...until it ended up being 1 hour and 45 minutes late.  We were served our first 3 courses standing...awesome.  When we finally got seated, we had some good dishes.  None particularly stood out.  It's been a week since I went and I took pics but I didn't memorize the dish names however there was quail and pork belly I believe.  Dessert came out in a sampler platter.  The dishes were nicely presented and ornate like what you would expect.  The bad was the LONG wait, server spilled beer on my friend, their POS system went down, they overcharged our drinks, and @ $157/pp...this just doesn't make the cut for what I consider fine dining.  Won't be back, wouldn't recommend...just didn't live up to the hype.", "author": "Andrew M."}

Sorry to say, this was a very big disappointment.  We had 2 spots for the 8:15 dinner and were warned that we needed to be on time or risk missing some of the action, so we dutifully showed up at 8:12. We were greeted and ushered to the cocktail area upstairs and told we would be seated downstairs at the communal tables in 45 min.The first shift dinner was ongoing at the time and we were able to watch that show. The only beverage available was a mango-beer shandy punch. Not my favorite but, ok we could do taht for 45 min. We were served 3 \"snacks\" a whipped scrambled egg concoction with maple syrup and bacon, which was completely overpowered by smoke flavor, a tiny liver on toast morsel which was tasteless, and a small caviar portion served on sweet corn puree. The caviar was fine but the sweet corn puree seemed to be the theme for the entire dinner, everything was overly sweet.\nI looked at my watch and it was now 9:45 so the 45 min was now 90 min when we finally were seated. One of the other diners asked\"What's your anger level?\".\nWell,  paying $170 per person in a supposedly fine dining establishment and waiting 90 min to be seated? I'd say it was pretty high.\nThe staff were very eager to please and apologetic for the wait, but honestly, at this price point they need to do better.\nOn to dinner, they put on a showbut for me the food was a disappointing.\nWhether it was ocean trout, scallops, pork jowl or guinea hen every dish was one note-sweetness. Molecular gastronomy is great, but it doesn't make up for lack of complex flavors. It just didn't do it for me. The wine pairings were fine, but the two cocktails that were served were just too sweet.\nWe finally finished up at  midnight and walked out feeling that the hype was just that.", "author": "Stu F."}

All I know is that I like really good food and Lazy Bear is the epitome of really good food.  This is a high end dining experience that I think everyone should try at least once if they have the means. Seriously, if you have to eat nothing but Ramen every day for a month to save up the funds for this place, DO IT.  Anyway, our evening started with delicious duck snacks served upstairs while we waited for the first seating to finish.  It's a cozy and relaxed area with comfy seating that looks down on the  main kitchen/dining area.  The snacks were not only brought to you by knowledgeable staff but thoroughly explained so you could enjoy them just a little bit more.  After the snacks were completed, we were moved downstairs for the main event.  I really liked how relaxed everything was.  Not a mad rush for anything; completely enjoyable experience from the very first second.  The main floor hosts two long communal tables and beautiful open kitchen.  It was quite the surprise when the head chef said we were welcome to approach the edge of the kitchen to observe, take pictures and even ask questions.  This just adds to the unique experience you will have here.  Everyone in that kitchen was friendly and took the time to answer questions too; they are loving their work and it really shows.  Moving through the courses of food went smoothly as the staff at Lazy Bear run like a well-oiled machine.  They are attentive without being overbearing and keep a watchful eye on empty glasses and plates.  They offered information about the wine pairings without coming off as snooty or condescending.  I'm not getting into the fine details of each dish we were served since their menu changes often.  I will say that each dish had me savoring every bite and longing for more; favorites included the crab soup and browned butter brioche.  The different flavors came through in every dish and as the dishes were described to us, you could certainly taste specific ingredients and notes. At the end of the meal, the owner/head chef came out to the tables to inquire about his guest's experiences.  As he made his way down the tables, you could certainly tell that he is caring and compassionate about his customers and his craft.  It wasn't a quick \"how was everything\" and then on to the next.  I heard him get into specifics with several patrons.  From the get-go he comes off as down to earth and damn good at what he does yet humble at the same time.  It truly shows in the dining experience at Lazy Bear and I'm glad I was able to experience this.  All said, I hope everyone reading this can try this place.  Go experience this magical gem in San Francisco. Go see the beautiful building and savor every bite that is set in front of you.  Take in the beauty that is some of the best food you can eat.  Enjoy the gorgeous d\u00e9cor.  Fall in love with Lazy Bear; I know I did.  Well done Chef David, well done!", "author": "Jen J."}

The concept works really well, and tends to attract a sociable bunch of folks who enjoy the experience together. The chefs, wait staff and sommelier/s are totally passionate, engaged, and take what they do very seriously while still keeping a sense of playfulness and humor (which is often lacking in other high-end restaurants). The food is excellent and interesting, and I didn't eat anything that wasn't delicious.  It was also very nice, in this era of people gingerly picking their way around menus to avoid anything that cavemen didn't eat, to just eat what was for dinner, as the chef intended, together. I tried a couple of things I wouldn't have ordered and they were great, and that sense of exploring something new with fun new people on either side of us was super fun.   What a great experience!", "author": "Nicole L."}
