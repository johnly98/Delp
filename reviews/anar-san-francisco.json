On a recent trip to San Francisco, I came across this lovely restaurant. It was lunch time on a weekday. There were barely any people in the restaurant, and I was able to get a great spot by the window. \n\nI loved the relaxed ambiance and friendly staff. They seemed totally fine with my hanging out to use the wifi. I am a slow eater, so this was a nice added bonus to be able to get some work done during lunch, especially since not all spots in San Francisco seem to have free WiFi. \n\nI ordered a glass of their house wine, a bowl of lentil soup and the yogurt cucumber dip. This is a typical mean for me at any Persian restaurant. I really wanted to try their dolmas but they were out. The lentil soup was filling, but maybe could have used a little bit more flavor. The wine and dip were both refreshing, and I didn't feel like I overate. \n\nI am curious about those dolmas! They also had some other dishes that I wish I had been hungry enough to try. Next time!", "author": "Jennifer B."}

It was a delivery order by the way.\nFirst of all the food came in really late. I always keep tracking the driver when i order for delivery (and the driver left the restaurant very late). And the most important, that i found haor in the food, not just in one plate, but in both pates i ordered!!! I felt they doing it in purpose.\nWhen i called asking for explanation, the lady on the phone was super rude, and ended up by hanging up on my face!!\nI will never recommend this place to someone!!", "author": "Bilel K."}

I asked her to give me a second, while I made sure I ordered the right thing, and she hung up on me. Twice\nThe first time, I was never told that I wasn't being heard correctly. The call ended. The second time, I asked to be given a bit of time, and the call ended a few seconds later. The host made me feel very rushed. I understand restaurants are busy, and time is money, but I also would have appreciated some patience from them since I wanted my order to be correct, and I feel like asking for a few seconds is not asking for a lot. \nIt also happened to my husband when he called a while later. We were trying to keep an open mind. Again, he had trouble reading a menu item, and had a few seconds of silence to try to rehearse the word, and the call ended. It couldn't have been both my phone and his phone with that problem. We had full WiFi and good connection. All of our other calls came in just fine. It seemed more like a lack of patience than a misunderstanding.\nPerhaps the restaurant's phone is having issues, in which case, I would hope it gets upgraded to a better phone that doesn't hang up on people. For customers that are not walking into your restaurant, the impression they get about the business is through their interaction over the phone.", "author": "Monica M."}

Our group was the majority of their Friday lunch crowd, except for a group of 2 and a solo guy.\n\nSituation: I am allergic to bread/gluten. When the waitress took my order for a Kabob Soltani I specifically asked, \"Does this come on bread? I can't eat bread\". She replied that they could swap the rice for salad, do 50/50 rice/salad, etc. I ordered the kabob w/rice.\n\nSome time later, the Kabob Soltani came out on a bed of lavash bread. I brought this up to the waitress and she claimed that I'd never said anything about my allergy. My coworkers and I were adamant that I had in fact asked for \"no bread\".\n\nTHEIR RESPONSE: Here's the thing - Mistakes happen. As someone with a food allergy, I've been in situations where I have forgotten to mention my intolerance. I've also been in situations like today where the restaurant messed up. It's fine. I'm used to it. What's telling is how the restaurant staff handles the situation. \n\nThe way it was handled by the waitress and manager is that they falsely and repeatedly accused me of not mentioning the bread allergy. Additionally, they said that I could either eat the kabob as-is, or I could pay for a new plate. Why would I eat the kabob that's been laying in bread if I am allergic to bread? Why would I pay for a second plate? In the 7 years that I've been intolerant of bread, this is the first time that a restaurant has asked me to pay to re-make the food -- even counting times where it was my own fault!!\n\nWhat really topped this off was the awful attitude of the staff. From that moment till we left, they were really bitchy towards us. No politeness. No hospitality. No thank you or goodbyes. Just dirty looks and sh|%%y attitude.\n\n\nOther feedback on the food: \n* The tadig appetizer was a \"D\". Not very crispy or crunchy.\n* The khoreshts for the tadig (ghormeh sabzee and ghaymeh) were both so-so.\n* When the Mirza Ghasemi appetizer came out, one of my coworkers joked that it was mostly tomato paste with a touch of eggplant. Subpar.\n\n\nBetween the mediocre food and the awful customer service, I am never going back here and I would not be surprised if this place is closed within a year. Go at your own peril.", "author": "Denzel R."}

Fresh and delicious.   I got it light on the dressing which was perfect.  Loved the combo of broccoli and walnut with the red lettuce \n- ground lamb - omg this was so delicious.  We had to order a second one.   This is probably my favorite kebab of all time. So tender and flavorful but not greasy at all\n- half and Half dessert.  The ice cream and vermicelli in rose water.  It's the last one on the dessert menu.  Omg.  I must come back for that and I am not even a dessert person. \n\nThe other stuff we ordered were just okay.

Although weirded out by the fact that there was not one other customer there on a Friday night, my date and I decided to stay. \n\nWe were greeted and seated by a seemingly friendly woman, given menus and left at our table. We waited about 5 minutes and no one came up to us. At this point there were 3 female employees chatting in the back and a man, presumably one of the workers/owners, on his laptop at a table by the kitchen. We waited several more minutes, looking at the servers, though not attempting to get their attention explicitly, because, as you can tell, it was a weird situation. Another man came out of the kitchen to talk to the others but ignored us as well. \n\nAfter almost 10 mins of not being greeted in a completely EMPTY restaurant with 5 capable staff hanging around, we decided to leave. \n\nWe said \"sorry we're gonna go\" as we walked out the door and although having a slightly concerned look on all their faces, no one said a word to us. Strangest dining experience ever. As a Persian, I was excited to find another Persian restaurant in the city, but what a disappointment... and terrible customer service! No wonder they had no customers on a weekend night.", "author": "Sam K."}

Who would have known this little place was hiding in SoMa.\n\nFirst of all, the interior decor is very elegant and cozy at the same time. The employees were very friendly and helpful. We got the fesenjan and the boneless chicken joojeh with a side of rice and salad (and it came with a roasted Roma/plum tomato--couldn't tell which one). The fesenjan was a very interesting dish--it's chicken in a pomegranate sauce. It was a bit tart while also being savory. Definitely want to eat it atop some rice because the flavor is strong and there isn't much texture (in fact, I think having some texture in/on the dish would make it even better). The chicken joojeh--oh, so good! It was strange how grilled marinated chicken could taste so flavorful and buttery, but it was definitely a crowd favorite. And paired with the roasted tomato on the side--Mmm.\n\nI definitely plan to come back in the near future to try something new here! Worth a try if you want to taste something new!", "author": "Julia N."}

I don't know how to say that in Farsi, but I'm in Sunday's San Francisco Chonicle (http://bit.ly/1pQgJQ8). Based on their suggestion, this is the place where they photographed me for the article because I had a nice dining experience here the week before, and fortunately I was able to get the same high quality of Persian food this time. I first noticed this place when I was taking the MUNI 12-line but really got motivated to try it when a friend of Jamie W.'s and a fellow Yelper, wrote that it was the \"BEST Persian food in SF right now\" (armand d. - here's his helpful review: http://bit.ly/XvIvuz). That was enough of an endorsement for me, so Jamie and I gave it a go last week.\n\nWell, it's not in a great location unless, I assume, you happen to be coming at... I mean coming to Blow Buddies or the End Up. It's on the speedway block of Harrison between 5th and 6th where all the Bay Bridge traffic pours into the city. Once you enter, it's a modestly decorated place, and you are greeted by one or both of the lovely young women who manage the front of the house. Persian cuisine is not well represented in the city, which is a shame since it has a lot in common with Turkish, Greek and Indian food. Most everything sounded tempting on the menu, so we started with the $7 plate of Dolmeh (Leaf), similar to Greek dolmas in the use of ground beef, rice and grape leaves but different in the use of split peas, herbs and a pomegranate seed garnish (photo: http://bit.ly/1shV47d). Delicious mouthfuls. We then shared two entrees.\n\nThe first was the $15 Loobia-Polo, a basmati saffron rice plate with chunks of beef, green beans and all sorts of spices (photo: http://bit.ly/1AMZ2JU). The second was our favorite, the $12 Kabab Koobideh, savory skewers of Persian minced meat kabab made from ground lamb and beef mixed with saffron seasoning, parsley, and chopped onions. It comes with lots of rice which put us on official grain overload (photo: http://bit.ly/1s0ZLB6). The last dish was actually an accident. It was the $12 Dolmeh (Belly Pepper) (photo: http://bit.ly/1pRyLl2) which the server had thought was the other dolmeh dish. When we pointed out that this was the one we wanted, she immediately had the chef make one for us free of charge even though we naively thought the first dolmeh leaves were complimentary. The belly pepper turned out to be a better stuffed vegetable, but by that point, we were completely stuffed.\n\nI was so pleased with the home-style dishes that when the Chronicle asked me to identify a place to be photographed for their story on Yelp Elites, I told them to meet me there the following Wednesday. With my friend Stephanie, we ordered the $6 Naan Panir Sabzi, a cornucopia of pita with fresh scallions, mint and basil leaves and blocks of feta cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/UKxPX6), but the highlight turned out to be the $17 Fesenjan, a chicken stew with ground walnut in a sweet-and-sour pomegranate sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1qT65hV). It was like a Persian version of butter chicken. I even tried a $3 glass of Doogh, a salty yogurt-based drink that I just couldn't warm up to. Service was more variable this time as the restaurant was hopping that night. Hopefully they will find their footing over time.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...satisfying home-style Persian dishes appear authentic and are quite flavorful\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...comfortable space for groups in a 'hood that's rather challenging\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...attentive service on my first visit...though my second visit saw an increasingly busy operation flail a bit more with long stretches of absence\nTOTAL - 4 stars...still a very worthwhile spot to try for authentic Persian food...I think they'll improve their rhythm over time", "author": "Ed U."}

I ordered the grilled chicken with salad and rice. Given the other reviews, I was expecting pretty tender meat. Unfortunately I found it to be a bit dry/overcooked. I actually got tired of chewing at some point. \n\nMy bf ordered the grounded lamb meat (koobideh). His lamb was much easier to chew and more tasty.

So I had to try the restaurant and was even more impressed. This is a great spot to go with a small group to catch up (quiet), share different appetizers and dishes, and be treated with great service. My favorite by far was the eggplant dip - the mint on top makes it even better. Then we shared the hummus (so fresh) and veggie kabobs (big portion, great value). We then shared the yogurt/rice pudding dessert - get that! And ask for the hot sauce. Also, try the sumac on your dishes - I am now obsessed with that spice and cook with it often.\n\nI don't know why people have negative reviews about this place.", "author": "Harmony P."}

It was a bargain and adorable, a mom-and-pop shop whose beautiful daughters worked as waitresses.  As an Iranian vegan, the first question I asked was if they could prepare their stew dishes called \"khoreshts\" which are the fancy guest-serving ornate Iranian dishes that is served atop rice (in contrast to the \"fast food\" being the kabobs) without the meat.  They were able to and we were happy, ordering Fesejaan (walnut sauce in a pomegranate syrup stew - a great introductory dish) and Bademjan (Eggplant stew) - both amazing.  Subsequent trips I have tasted their albaloo pollo - sweet cherry rice - along with and Sabzi-Polo (rice with lima beans and dill and other scrumptious spices) and, coming from an Iranian: SOLID.  And then there is the national Iranian dish: Ghormeh Sabzi, a stew mixture of saut\u00e9ed herbs, consisting mainly of parsley, leeks or onions, coriander, seasoned with the key spice of dried fenugreek leaves - YUM.\nThe food tasted as good IF NOT BETTER than the other reputable Iranian restaurant in the city:  Maykadeh in North Beach along with the other one Alborz on VanNess.  And like the other restaurants, it was white table cloth and had all the accouterments of being a high brow establishment.  Unfortunately, over time, they raised their prices to the same watermark the other two placed did, taking them out of my \"everyday restaurant\" category into my \"on special occasions\" category.  Too bad - I am always hounding for some good Iranian food.\nBut TWO THUMBS UP to this place.  They are such nice people and they even give a small discount for those who order vegan dishes because of the lack of meat.  I have heard they have good kababs here too.", "author": "Khash C."}

The dip has the perfect balance of chunkiness, eggplantiness, mint and onion - along with the hint of yogurt.\n\nThe Koobideh (lamb kebab) was spiced perfectly. I really love the gamey flavor of lamb and they added just the perfect amount of Persian to the ground lamb. I ended up eating it with the magic carpet pitabread and salad.\n\nFesenjan - this was definitely the most interesting dish we had. The sauce was full of pomegranate flavor with undertones of walnut. I've never quite had something like that before with chicken and it was pretty eye-opening. Could possibly one of those love it or hate it kind of dishes.

We finished the first dish relatively quickly since we were hungry and were waiting for the second plate to come out. A waiter comes up to us and says that if we weren't eating then we should leave. We had to tell him that we were waiting for our other dish to come--keep in mind, this wasn't even a busy hour. There was literally one other couple at this place when we went. \n\nIf it wasn't for the service, I'd probably give this place 5 stars.

Meeting up with a friend I haven't seen for a while, we ordered their:\n\n* Kashk-E Bademjan - A pureed (or puree-like) eggplant and yogurt appetizer, similar to the texture of hummus, meant to be eaten with pita bread. Good flavor, and overall, pretty enjoyable.\n\n* Kaba Koobideh - Also fairly tasty, and, while we were both experienced a little sticker shock at first, looking at the menu, we realized that their serving sizes were huge. So, yes, while one of these dishes is around the $20 mark, unless you eat a LOT, one dish should be enough to share. I also understand why someone else said Anar served a slightly healthier version of Persian food: their stuff is not as oily/buttered/salted as the stuff I'm used to, for better or worse.\n\nSo, while everything was pretty solid, I wasn't so wowed that I'd give them a four. A solid 3.5 though. My only real complaint was the same as the previous Persian place I went to: I'm still used to yogurt being served as part of the meal, not a separate side that you have to order, so that still irks me.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A fairly large venue with plenty of accessibility.

Traffic can be a bitch, since it's close to the freeway on ramp. It's a gorgeous space inside...definitely a feminine influence.\nWe started off with some drinks - a pomegranate juice that looked house-made and \"doogh\", the yogurt and mint drink. Both drinks were good. The yogurt drink was thick, slightly tangy, and the amount they give you is a lot. It isn't salty. I couldn't finish my glass! Our shared appetizer was the Kashk e Bademjan, a delicious roasted eggplant meant to be eaten with thin lavash bread. Definitely would order this again. The bread was fresh and they were generous with the amount. We had a ton to take home.\nIt took a while for the food to come out. Good thing we weren't too hungry. DH ordered the Shishlik which is a lamb chop dish served with basmati (?) rice and a grilled tomato. He liked the flavor, but I thought it was too gamey. His quote: \"Lamb that actually tastes like lamb.\" LOL! Also, each chop was really tiny. He felt is wasn't a good value at $26...it was one of the most expensive things on the menu.\nMy dish was the classic lamb/beef Koobideh ground meat kabobs. At $14, this was a better deal. It came with the same rice, a pat of butter, roasted tomato, and raw, sliced onions. Flavor was fine, but I wished the meat was slightly more charred. However, the tomato was a bit too charred.\nThe rice is kind of odd. It's a long-grained variety, but seemed too soggy. Perhaps whomever cooked it used too much water.\nI almost forgot to mention the dessert: saffron ice cream with pistachios. Flavor was awesome, texture was not. However, soggy pistachios and some iciness seems in line with other Persian ice creams I've had. Portion size was generous...I can still recommend it at $6.\nOverall experience was good. Seemed quite authentic and not \"Americanized\". There were real Persians eating here, not just hipsters. :) Really liked the atmosphere. Wait staff was super friendly and helpful. We got all of our utensils and a small container of water.

I'm a transplant from LA and I'm aware of what good Iranian/Persian tastes like, having lived in Westwood and Brentwood. Simply put, Anar can stand up to the best that Los Angeles has to offer. \n\nThe kabobs on the menu are all very good and excellent but the hidden gem in the menu is the Zaershk Polo which is a chicken and rice disk served with a special tomato sauce. The meat simply falls off the bone and the rice with dry fruits mixed in it is simply outstanding. This is by far the best combination of chicken and rice I've had. That's huge because being Indian and having been raised in the Middle East, I've had every possible combination of rice and chicken. \n\nThe appetizers are pretty standard and you can't really go wrong with any of them (yes, I have tried them all). If I was to choose one I'm go with the Badamjaan( eggplant pur\u00e9e). As mentioned earlier the kabobs are excellent, juicy succulent and tender meat. \n\nThe place is run by a Persian family with the mom and dad cooking food back in the kitchen and the daughters running the show. The hospitality, service and response is great and it feels like you are eating at someone's house and not at a fancy restaurant though the ambience is pretty fancy. \n\nInsider tip: Skip the desserts and order the special Persian tea. Great and light way to end a fantastic meal.", "author": "Toufeeq H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-19", "description": "I've been here a few times now and am ready to review it. This is my favorite Iranian restaurant in the Bay Area, and I've been to Shalizaar, Alborz, Lavash, and Maykadeh. The food is as good if not better than any of the others, and it is the most reasonably-priced. The wait staff are also very nice and helpful if you have questions. I think this is a family-run place and it definitely has that feel. Also, the portions are very large. \n\nThe dishes I've had have all been great. They are:\n\n(1) Kabob Soltani. This is one skewer of marinated steak (barg), one skewer of ground beef and lamb (koobideh), and rice. All three were fantastic. I'm typically not a huge fan of koobideh, but they have spiced theirs perfectly. \n\n(2) Joojeh Kabob. This is one skewer of grilled chicken with rice. Again, excellent flavor and texture.\n\n(3) Fesenjan. This is a great dish that many non-Iranians probably don't know about. It is chicken and rice with a sauce made from crushed walnuts and pomegranate syrup. It is a sweeter-tasting dish, and I highly recommend this to people who haven't had it before. \n\nMy only suggestions on improvements would be:\n\n(1) Maybe keep the water bottles in the refrigerator. My table went through two bottles of water and both were room temperature. Or I could've just asked for ice...\n\n(2) Our entrees came out just a few minutes after the appetizer was brought out. I know it's probably difficult to time this properly, but I think there should be a longer gap between appetizer and entree so that the customer doesn't have to choose between finishing the appetizer (and letting the entree get cold) or switching over to the entree (and letting the appetizer get cold). \n\n(3) No complimentary bread. Of course the entree portions are large enough that you will not leave here hungry. But for whatever reason it just seems like if an Iranian restaurant doesn't bring out bread and greens/cheese, something is missing. \n\nBut regardless of these three critiques, this is by far my favorite Iranian place and I will continue to visit and recommend it to my friends.", "author": "John S."}

I ordered a Kashke Bademjan (eggplant dish) and a Kabob Kobideh. I want to start by saying the Kashke Bademjan was the best I have had. Perfect mix of olive oil and consistency with the egglplant. Unbelievable. The Kobdideh was very high quality too. \"Fake\" Persian Restaurants will add too much fat to their Kobideh to save meat, causing the final product to be soggy OR not put enough much fat to their Kobideh, causing it to come out very dry. The Kobideh here was a perfect mix. \n\nI will definitely bring my Persian friends here and be proud to show them what an Asian found!! :)", "author": "Guang H."}

This probably surprises people, but SF is severely lacking in it's Persian food options, with very few options to be had. Maykadeh in North Beach is still a reliable choice but this place is much more accessible and has a cozier, family feel to it. \n\nThe food was great. Within our group of four, we ordered the Joojeh (chicken), Koobideh (ground beef/lamb), Shishlik (lamb chops) and Soltani (a combination of Koobideh and Barg, which is like the Iranian version of filet mignon). We didn't try any of the stews (we usually reserve that for home cooking) but everything we ate was excellent. We ordered the yogurt and eggplant appetizer, which were solid as well. If you are given the choice between rice and bread, pick the rice, as the bread is your standard lavash.\n\nThe focus is on the food, which is good, so don't come expecting belly dancers or anything silly like that (if you're in a persian restaurant with belly dancing, you're in a bad restaurant. It's there to distract you). The servers/waitresses are nice and you definitely get a family feel for the place.

Doesn't matter what the quality, quantity or ambience is like. I will eat there.\n\nAnar definitely surprised me. I lived in the East Bay for the longest and trust me, there's no shortage of good Persian food there. I obviously know my koobideh kebab, my joojeh kebab and my kashk-e-bademjan. And so do the chefs at Anar :)\n\nThere was no wait on the evening we walked in. What struck me was the ambiance, very clean and not over top the Middle Eastern-y, like a lot of places are in order to emphasize the type of cuisine. And yes, no belly dancers and all that jazz. I say, let the food speak for itself.\n\nWe ordered anar juice (pomegranate juice that tasted exceptionally fresh), one doodh (which is basically a salty buttermilk-y beverage), one koodibeh kebab plate with rice, one joojeh kebab plate with rice, one kashk-e-bademjan (eggplant dip with a yogurt base). Like, you cannot go wrong ordering any of these at a Persian restaurant. They also provided us with a bowl of lavash, to compliment the eggplant. The food didn't stand a chance. The koobideh was inhaled. Half the joojeh went home with me for lunch the next day, as the quantities served are substantial. And well, it didn't stand a chance the next day.

The place is beautiful and was certainly a very nice environment to dine in, but that was about it. We had a large party and we tried to be very respectful, quiet, and organized when ordering. That said, this place is definitely not good at handling a lot of people, which is a shame because a lot of their appetizers and dishes are perfect for sharing. \n\nWhile the hostess who took our orders was friendly enough, the servers who brought the food to the table were quite brusque and had no idea what the dishes were and who they belonged to. Service was attentive when it came to refilling carafes, but pretty slow with everything else. We might have asked for the bill three times before it actually showed up. \n\nAs for the food, I think it is severely overpriced. Entrees are mostly rice or bread but average $20 or more. I ordered the lamb chops, which were nearly $30. For that, I got 5 small pieces of meat on a large bed of very strong raw onions and a large piece of flat bread. I did not find it very palatable and was unsure what to do with the very large pile of onions. Other members of our party ordered various forms of kebab and meat + rice dishes, and I just feel like the huge platters are mostly covered in rice and nothing else. The meats I tried were not especially tender nor flavorful. In the end, I did not feel like I was getting my money's worth. I admit I am not too familiar with Persian cuisine, but I've eaten around enough to know this place didn't quite hit the mark with me. \n\nI could see how this could be a good date spot or ideal for an intimate dining experience.

As soon as you step into the place there is a change of scenery. A family owned and operated place with high ceilings, walls painted in rich earth tones and your first taste of Persia when you notice the paintings and calligraphy on the walls and appropriately placed little clay pomegranates (Anars) here and there. \n\nWe arrived there in the afternoon for Persian tea and nibbled on some desserts which I will describe for you. First, was Shole Zard or saffron rice pudding, a heavenly fusion of rice pudding and saffron with an underscoring of butter, rosewater and traces of cinnamon and silvered almonds on top. It was quiet nice with the right color, texture and sweetness. Then we had Shir Berenj which is the less sweet simple version of Persian rice pudding and a much wiser choice for people like me who have to watch their high blood sugar. There was also Baklava that I did not try but looked fresh and fluffy. \n\nWe had those with Persian tea which brewing a perfect one is a labor in itself. Tea was served in visually appealing traditional transparent glass cups called Estekaan which is a Russian word in case you were wondering. Along with the tea you get two pieces of dates and a small branch of fresh mint, a nice touch that adds to the flavor of the tea. Anar's tea isn't exactly what you can taste in a Persian tea-house in Baazaar or your grandma's place but close enough and far superior to the over brewed mediocre hot drink most places sell to you as tea!  \n\nStaff was very nice and friendly and two young girls that checked on us a few times to make sure we have everything and a charming older gentleman who I believe was the owner and personally welcomed us and served our first round of tea. \n\nA glance at the food menu shows choices for the main course are adequate with couple items that invoked pleasant memories of back home. Main courses including Kababs and meat options are very reasonably priced compared to restaurants in the vicinity or the other 3 Persian restaurants in the city. \n\nI look forward to going back to Anar for the full experience and I think the place with its roomy high ceiling can enjoy a far richer and more rustic decor to complement the beautiful paintings and wall calligraphy. Perhaps, the whole place is even more enticing at night than it is in daytime complete with dim light of its exposed filament light bulbs and Persian music playing in the background all inviting you to indulge in rustic and flavorful Persian kababs and stews. \n\nIf you go there, enjoy your time and Nooshe-Jaan.", "author": "Kaveh G."}

I mentioned to the young waitress about the lack of vegetarian main dish options and she reacted as if she had never heard of this being an issue, which is ridiculous since we are in San Francisco. She also did not offer any substitutions for the vegetarian diner.

It was unclear if their menu changes periodically?\n\nI ordered tea, but only given one 1/2 size sugar cube. My dining partner ordered bread, only a very small amount of bread given with one butter.

I got the baghali polo (fava beans, bill and rice) and he got the joojeh kebab (chicken kebab). Both were excellent. The polo was great and my pal's chicken was spot on! The dolma were delicate and beautiful. It was like being back in Shiraz. \n\nSuggestions: I wish that they would add some more traditional khoreshes (stews) and was disappointed that tadig (buttery rice crust) was not on the menu. Please, please add albaloo polo (cherry polo)! And better feta - it was too mild. I would prostrate myself for real sangak. There were some items that rotated on the menu, but the menu didn't note which days that they were served; perhaps have a regular posted daily special, so that folks could come on the day that their favorite food was being cooked.\n\nThis is genuine Persian cooking! The joint is run by a Persian family; mom does all the cooking, dad manages the restaurant, and I believe the daughters are the waitresses. The food came out quickly. The daughters need some practice waitressing. They were pleasant, but absentminded. The music was and atmosphere was soothing. \n\nI am grateful that they opened. will return to Anar and eat my way through the menu!", "author": "Avery C."}

The Dolmeh had a really tangy exterior, which contrasted well with its meaty mixed inside. I was basically ready to cancel my main course and ask for 3 or 4 more orders of it.\n\nMy friend and I shared two dishes - the Kabab Koobideh and the Kabab Shishlik. The Koobideh skewers were huge and cooked to perfection, and the Shishlik (Lamb Chops) had this amazing smoked lamb flavor. They were each served with rice and a huge roasted tomato. \n\nMaybe the best part of the entire meal were the spices and sauce. Anar has some really mild pepper flakes that go well with skewers, and a special \"Spicy Pomegranate infused sauce\" which is kind of like tabasco with fruit.

As many reviewers have said, it tasted homemade which is a refreshing change from most Persian restaurants. We ordered a few different items to share, this is not typical in a Persian restaurant but we wanted to taste a number of things so we ordered family style.\n\nFor starters we ordered the Mirza Ghasemi and the soup - the MG was so good that one member of our party was considering ordering a few more plates and having it as his entree. I didnt have the soup but others said it was great. We then ordered a Koobideh/Joojeh combo, a Fesenjan and the Ghalyee Kadu as our main dishes. All items were delicious. The Koobideh was very well made and had the perfect texture/flavor. The Joojeh was pretty good as well but not as good as the Koobideh. The khoreshts were both pretty good but the other item, often neglected in reviews, that was great was the rice. The grains were large, fluffy, and not too moist/dry.  \n\nAs for the decor and ambiance I'd say it was pretty nice for a neighborhood restaurants.

You will regret it as I did. So sad that I have to write a negative review for a Persian restaurant but I feel like others have to know so they do not get embarrassed in front of their guests. \n\nFirst of all, they do not serve authentic Persian food and it takes them forever to bring it, even if there is not a lot of people there. The problem is that the staff there are very mean. When a family behind us, asked why they are so slow in serving she gave her a 5 minute lecture that a restaurant cannot serve them the food the moment they come in and that they only have one stove. This is so mean, you have to first apologize! and then explain why. I have been to many restaurants and the ones that do not have a fast service at least provide their customers with some appetizer till their food is ready. A popular Persian appetizer is fresh vegetable, with cheese and nan (bread). That costs a restaurant nothing to serve its customers and almost all Persian restaurants that I have been to do it complimentary. That is NOT the case here, it will cost you 8 dollars to order it!! You have to just sip water for thirty minutes till they bring your food.\n\nWe were there for dinner and for the main order you have choices between kabob and stew. They give you an option when you order Kabob (lamb) or Joojeh (chicken). You can either order rice and bread or salad and bread. Ordering Kabob and bread is a popular choice. I was excited about the salad as well, since it is usually made very tasty in Persian restaurants and dressed beautifully. So I ordered that and after waiting for about 30 minutes the food was served. \n\nI could not be more disappointed. The salad was just a bunch of lettuce that was mixed with Balsamic vinegar. No effort was made to make anything look good at all.  What is surprising is that there is no Balsamic vinegar in Persian Cuisine. You can not even find it in Iran. None of my guests liked the salad. It is a real pitty that they do not serve the real persian Salad. I was really disappointed and asked to talk to the manager to give her some suggestion as a good will. I thought maybe they do not know and my suggestion would be helpful. First they said she is busy. Then after 10 minutes someone who introduced herself as floor manager came and asked what is the problem. I explained that the salad is nothing close to being Persian and compared to the price they charge this is not acceptable. Then similar to the way she responded to the other desk, she started to lecture me why everyone likes their salad and they way they do it is the right way. She said foreigners come here as well and they like it this way. I said but you are a Persian restaurant and this is not authentic. And this is not a good excuse to be sloppy and just mix some salad and add some vinaigrette because you do not care. I asked that she should at least tell the customer that this is not authentic persian salad when taking orders, and she unapologetically said that would take a long time for the waiter to write down!!! Very mean and adamant. The least you can do is to thank the customer for their suggestion and do not implement it if you think he is wrong, not to argue and lecture him in front of his guests. I had to end it with a fake smile so that my friends do not think we had an argument.Very bad experience, will not come back.", "author": "Amir G."}

We walked in at 3:30, got seated, with no menus or water. One of us asked for water and it took them 15 mins to bring it. By the time they brought us the menus and we could order we had already been sitting there for 40 mins. After another 20 minutes she tells us they don't have any shiahlik and tells us to change our order to barg, after initially she said At 5:30 we still didn't have our food, when we asked the waitress/owner told us with attitude that half of our food was ready and if we want to wag together we have to wait. After that she started bringing out our food one at a time and she literally threw my plate in front of me and rolled her eyes at me. HELLO! At that point I was going to walk out but everyone said let's just eat and we will never come back here. I wish I had walked out! I got their \"Akbar joojeh\" it was so dry and tasteless. We did not complain. Some people ordered some tea. We were talking about a date I went on at maykadeh, (Persian restaurant in sf), she said we don't have tea, you can have tea at maykadeh! And she started screaming at us and saying we are paid by maykadeh! LoL I still can not believe what happened today, she was so rude, so rude, and she said she doesn't owe us anything.  Your horrible customer service, and your eye rollings and bad attitude is the reason we started praising maykadeh, it's only natural to wonder why we ended up in a place with horrible food and the worst customer service EVER, when we could've gone to a place with good food and service. I think it's cute that they are getting all their relatives to write them\n5 start reviews but I know for a fact 3 tables that were there today were traumatized. Do not go to this place!

In order for you to succeed, good food alone does not make it, you must go above and beyond to please your clients. It is very obvious that this is lacking in your environment. There are other choices in this town.\n\nThe food was very dry, and very mediocre at best, service is lacking or not even there. We drove over 45 minutes to try this restaurant and were completely disappointed.\n\nWe will probably give this place another try in due time, and hopefully they read the negative comments and learn from it just as they praise the 5 star comments.\n\n\nReply:\n\n\nDear Mr. Cyrus M, Thanks for taking the time and requesting details. For one thing, When I order Tah-Dig, I expect it to come with a stew, not plain... and when I asked,  I did not want to hear its a \"Gift\".... Gifts are exchanged between families and friends not at restaurant. It may be complimentary, but I am not there to receive complimentary items. I don't have a problem if you want to charge for it, but you cant tell me that's the only way it comes... Never been to a Persian restaurant where there was no Tah-Dig...\n\nYour staff were very nice and pleasant in most part, but when we wanted to move the table to get some privacy, they almost panicked.. because if the table is moved it makes noises.. Really..!! Well fix the noise, and this is not what I want to hear..\n\nYour Barg was so dry, that it was very chewey, after which another waiter said, oh maybe we should have asked how you would like it... \n\nWe will return in due time, but I do hope you spend some time fixing the small stuff as it makes a huge different in how you are remembered.

Menu: On a Saturday nt, fesenjan was the only khoresh available (which I didn't want, the mahi (fish) dishes - \"sorry we are out.\" .  The waitress said \" We just changed the menu.\"  That sounded  not true.  I ended up with soltani, read meat which I also didn't really want.\n 2.  The food: I rec'd no bread & butter while I waited for my khashe baramjan (sauted eggplant and whey) appetizer.  I liked the dish but it was served with cold but fresh, lavash.   The drizzle of sauted mint on top smelled great but the taste was overwhelmed with oil as was the khask but I love eggplant and I would get this again.       My entree, soltani was a disappointment:  the rice was cooked with too much water but had a generous topping of saffron.  The barg koobideh (spiced ground beef kabob) was delicious, hot, the way I like it.  The barg was tender, but warmer and not hot,  & not juicy like it should had it just came off of the grill.  I was very disappointed about this as it is filet mignon.  I had to ask for onions.  The grilled tomato was also a disappointment:  overcooked on the outside and undercooked on the inside as though it was rushed.  \n3. Service:  The wait staff was interesting:  Two young women who seemed to think that I should just accept that the sparce menu just happened.  Definitely not 5 star. \n4.  Decor:  although the table clothes were a nice touch, the center peice was  a cheap Michale's vase with a small votive candle.  I think they were going for classy but fell short.   The wall hangers, however, were my favorite: 4 caligraphies of the word ANAR in Farsi.  The dot over the \"n\" was an abstract of a pomegrante (anar), in red, with the word anar written over and over again.  I would have bought one if they were on sale. \n\nWould I go again?

I have been there a couple of time and I feel like each time I had a better experience than the time before. Maybe their service is not the best, but there is something about the restaurant that makes me want to go there more often.\n\nWhen it comes to the food itself though, you can compare them with any other Persian/Iranian restaurant in the Bay Area. Their Koobideh is simply the best. Their Barg, Shishlik, and Baghali polo are really good as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-02-27", "description": "It breaks my heart to review this place as such because it has great food.  But the service is terrible. \n\nThe owner who is a nicer older man who is bald he's always sitting outside in his car smoking a cigarette as do the waitresses there.  Now handwashing is an important aspect of any food handling. I have seen the owner walk in from smoking a  cigarette in his car and walk straight into the kitchen and handle bread and put bread inside those bread baskets with his hands without washing them.   Also the waitresses there smoke and I have seen them smoke outside as well and I have not once seen them come back and going to the restroom and wash their hands or go back in the kitchen and wash their hands.  I think even before any of the staff or the owner or people who handle food walk into the kitchen once they come inside the restaurant from smoking a cigarette they should go directly inside the restrooms and wash their hands so people eating there can have a state of mind that their food is being handled by clean hands.  \n\n The two sisters that work there who are related to the owner clearly need to take a lesson in waitressing and proper etiquette's.  They forget orders. U have to repeat things twice to them or sometimes they just forget. I can understand and respect a family business but even as a waitress one needs to be confident in their job.  They handle food poorly.", "author": "Marcus M."}

I've tried Kashk Bademjoon in other Persian restaurants, but this was by far the best. For our main course, we ordered, khobideh kebab ( ground beef)  Soltani Kabab ( ground beef and barbeque beef) Chicken barg kebab and khobideh.  We loved the food, the kebabs were very tender and juicy without so much fat and the basmati rice with saffron was very tasty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-06-01", "description": "By far the WORST service I have EVER experienced.\nTo clarify, I dealt with these people at a wedding where they were hired to cater the food. I have never been to their restaurant. I also work in the service industry as a beverage caterer and I was working the wedding along side of them in the same kitchen. From the start they were extremely rude and unwilling to help my staff or the wedding planner. Throughout the night I would walk back to our bussing station (which was separate from Anar's work area) and I would find their trash in our trash cans, which they were trying to sneak into the cans so they didn't have to take it with them at the end of the night. They would also take our glasses, without asking, and use them for their staff to drink coffee. Then they would just leave the dirty glasses on the table and not even return them to their proper place. Anar's staff would not help the wedding planner with anything that was not \"in the contract.\" The plates and silverware were rented from a third party and for that reason, Anar's staff refused to help bus dirty dishes off the tables. I was only supposed to be dealing with the glassware from our bar, but because of their lack of participation, I had to bus the dirty plates off the tables as well. Not only did I have to do more work because of the unhelpful staff at Anar, but also the wedding planner and a few of the guests at the wedding ended up bussing dirty plates! I have never EVER been to a wedding where the guests had to bus plates because the caterers were refusing to do so.\nThe fact that the caterers were letting guests bus because they were refusing to do so would have been bad enough on its own. Unfortunately that is not all they were doing wrong. \nOne last inconsiderate behavior Anar's staff exhibited that I will mention is that at the end of the night, they had a bunch of food left over and they wanted to leave it behind. This normally wouldn't be an issue but there was so much food that there was nothing to do with it all. The wedding planner gave some of it away to the guests but that wasn't enough. The wedding planner then asked the caterers to take the rest with them because she couldn't do anything with it. At this point, the caterers got in a huge yelling battle with each other and then started yelling at the wedding planner! Something as simple as taking your own trash with you was such a big deal for these people. They ended up leaving the food behind for the wedding planner to deal with. At this point I was in absolute disbelief at how these people do business. I ended up taking Anar's trash home in our company truck and disposing it at our warehouse. \n\nIf you are ever thinking of hiring these people to cater an event for you, DO NOT DO IT! It will cost you way more than it is worth. There are far better caterers out there. There is better food available, and nicer people who will work with you. The only reason I am even giving them a single star is because there isn't an option for zero stars.", "author": "Collin R."}

One of the women actually raised her voice to my lunch companion when he didn't hear her question regarding rice or bread. It took over 30 minutes to be served our lunch. Then when we asked for a box and the check, we had to ask for both 2 more times and waited another half hour. Restaurant owners' should understand how week day lunch business works. Nobody can waste  that much time and we have to get back to work. Sadly, Anar is very close to being taken off the list for lunch places. I will try 1 more time but the service must improve.

The chicken breast was done to perfection and very juicy and not dry at all.  We also ordered Ghormet Sabzi(sauteed herbs, lamb chunks, kidney beans, rehydrate lemons, etc) with Basmati rice for about $18. All very delicious. We each ordered a glass of Cabernet and Zinfandel, not bad, not great either. Our hostess and waiter were extremely polite and gracious. The place had one other table occupied when we arrived and maybe that was due to rain or arriving so late because they usually stop serving around 9:30pm. Suggestions: I think the lighting could be a bit dimmer because we had to change our corner table due to the halogen light spotlight kinda blinding my partner. Maybe more candles at night? And yeah, don't sit at the window unless you'd like to observe the homeless passing by and putting on a show and a show they do. Hmmm, dinner and a show, win win!
