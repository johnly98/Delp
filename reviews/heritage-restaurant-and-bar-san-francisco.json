I found both cocktails we ordered to be on the astringent side. I had the To Kill a Mockingbird cockail. My husband had a mojito, and he thought it was the worst mojito he's had in a bar with way too much lime compared to mint and simple syrup.\n\nFor dessert, my husband had the milk and cookies. He loved the chocolate chip cookies. I tried the oatmeal cranberry cookie, and it was very good. I had the panna cotta, and I loved the grape granata and fresh berries paired with the rich panna cotta.\n\nHowever, as this is a bar, and we didn't love the cocktails, I can't say that I'd recommend the place.", "author": "michelle l."}

However the beautiful bar might bring me back in for a second visit. \n\nWe waited around 30 minutes for our food and I didn't find the food necessarily worth the wait. I did see a couple other reviews mention the meager portion sizes and I agree -- I ordered the salmon and while it was delicious, I thought it was a pretty small portion and only came with a few thin pieces of broccolini. A friend of mine ordered the ribeye and also found her portion on the smaller side. A bit disappointing considering the price.\n\nWe also ordered an appetizer of garlic fries that didn't come out before our entrees, so we had to ask the waiter and ended up eating the fries after our meal.\n\nOverall, I don't think I would return for dinner but the restaurant and especially the bar were beautiful, so I could see myself stopping in for a drink if I were ever in the area again!", "author": "Greg J."}

The food & drinks were beautifully presented and delicious.  Salmon, ribeye, mushroom soup, pasta, garlic fries, panna cotta, salad, crostini.  I would happily eat any of it again.

Last night I finally had the chance to check it out. At first glance from the street, the space looked relatively empty, but once inside, we could see that the bar space and many of the tables at the back of the restaurant were occupied by a congenial crowd. The fireplace in the back of the dining room added a warm, cozy vibe to the updated, streamlined decor and was a welcome sight on a damp and foggy night.\n\nAs for the food, I enjoyed the roasted chicken ($24) with cranberry beans and Brussels sprouts. The chicken was succulent with a crisp skin topped by sprigs of toasted rosemary and the sprouts were nice and fresh.\n\nMy date went with the hamburger - a bit pricy but the high quality warranted the $17 price tag. Speaking of pricy, the wine list was a bit up there, with the cheapest bottle clocking in at $48. I settled for a $13 glass of Lipstick on a Pig, a blend from California. Very nice with a dry finish.\n\nGreat, friendly service from our waiter James, who gave us the skinny on the Happy Hour - 3-6pm Everyday!\n\nDefinitely pleased with this new addition to the neighborhood and will be back for happy hour.", "author": "Carole B."}

I didn't realize that they had a pre fixe menu for valentines until we got there, which was a nice surprise. It was $60 for a set of app, entree, and dessert. Two options each for app and entree and just one dessert option. We each ordered different apps and entrees - there was a chilled beet and coriander soup and a strawberry and guava salad, Thai spiced market fresh snapper and grilled prime beef flat iron steak. Dessert was a chocolate almond cremeaux. \n\nThe apps were both delicious! I didn't think I would like the beet soup but I was really into it. Same with the salad which balanced the various flavors really well. The fish was also pretty good and the Thai green curry it came on was delicious. It also came with just plain white rice which I thought was a tad boring but fine. The steak was pretty good and it came in a pretty large portion. The grilled veggies on that plate were superb. Lastly, I was a huuuuuge fan of the dessert I was happy there was only one option because then we got two of it!! Creamy rich chocolate with almonds and some berries and vanilla ice cream.. omg heaven.

Most of the party ordered salmon, ribeye, chicken, hamburger, garlic fries and homemade pasta. The salmon was less than a 4 oz serving, the ribeye came out lukewarm but was cooked as requested, the chicken was moist, the hamburger ratio to the bread was more bread. I was very disappointed with the homemade pesto pasta - there was no flavor whatsoever. The chef should of use the dressing from the salad as the pesto sauce! Also, the inconsistency of the amount of pasta was different for everyone that ordered it. Some received a small portion, and some received a bigger portion! \n\nWe ordered two desserts - chocolate pudding, and fruit cobbler.

We're always ones to give hot and new restaurants a try. \n\nChris took our reservation for 8 the morning a day before.\n\nOur half of the party arrived 15 minutes early. My parents have mobility issues so I dropped them off with the guest of honor while I went to find street parking. The host who sat my parents and husband gave a little history of the place on how the current owner took over the place from the Clement Tavern and remodeled the fireplace. During the remodeling, the linoleum floors were pulled up to reveal beautiful wood flooring. We were seated in the private room which can hold 16. The place was an ice cream store in the 20's and the original ice cream freezers were kept and add to the decor. The chef who had received awards in Maui (my favorite island) moved from there for his children's schooling.\n\nFor appetizers, the Asian Pear and Burrata Cheese looked most attractive. We liked the slices of Asian Pear with the guava and Thai basil. We ordered 2 fried Brussels sprouts and garlic fries. For the entrees, 3 Scottish Salmons, 2 Pan Roasted Pork Chops, 1 Roasted Free Range Half Chicken, and 2 Heritage Cheeseburgers were ordered. \n\nOur server asked if it would be all right to bring the Fried Brussel Sprouts out with the appetizer and we let her know that was fine. When the appetizers came out, one of the Fried Brussel Sprouts was missing so we asked our server's helper if it would be coming soon. It came shortly. He also delivered another one to us later after the meals were delivered saying that the kitchen had made another one and he was giving it to us so we could enjoy some more the Fried Brussel Sprouts which we had found very unique in that the outside was crispy and the inner Brussel sprout was tender. \n\nThe Salmon was excellent. My brother-in-law commented, \"That's the way that you cook fish.\" You never want to over cook fish. The Fish was ordered medium by all. Our birthday boy enjoyed the entree and the presentation of the salmon fillet on the pea pur\u00e9e with preserved lemon  aioli sauce, arugula pesto, dandelion greens, and beet vinaigrette. \n\nMy father and I had the Pan Roasted Pork Chop. I normally don't like Pork Chops because they can be dry. This dish was done very well. There was not much meat left on the bone by the end of dinner. I liked the sourdough raisin stuffing and wild plum pur\u00e9e. It was a good counter to the seasoning on the pork chops. The chive potatoes were buttery and creamy smooth. Presentation also was nice. \n\nThe Roasted Chicken looked burnt on the outside, but the meat was tender enough for mother.\n\nThe two tweens had the Heritage Cheeseburgers with no cheese or onions. One of the buns was burnt on the edge. They didn't finish their burgers, but enjoyed the \"Milk and Cookies\" for dessert.\n\nThe adults were curious about the Passion Fruit Curd Meringue Pie. It was a deconstructed pie with Yuzu pineapples and a Hawaiian almond nut crunch.\n\nWhat left a bad feeling was that we were charged for the 3rd Fried Brussel Sprout that we had not ordered which the server's helper had given to us complimentary because it had already been made. Our server argued with us that we had ordered the 3rd one on a bill that was already in the triple digits. She did take the charge off though before we paid the bill.", "author": "Belinda L."}

Nobody there was under 50, unless they were there as somebody's son or daughter.  (BTW none of us are under 60...just so you know.)\n\nThe clientele looks to have changed completely. Nobody over 50 except us. Millennials everywhere, chatting glibly and erupting in peals of laughter so loud that it hurt. If you don't know who Maxwell Smart was, do a google images search on \"cone of silence\", and you will get the idea.\n\nThe interior is much the same. The same uneven, barrel-vaulted ceiling sloping down to Radio Shack-style wall sconces. Hard ceiling, walls, and floors, with dark wood tables and chairs. There's a new room divider in the corner.\n\nI went back to look at the washroom area, a weak point in the old restaurant. It has been upgraded with the installation of a white porcelain trough in the hallway, intended for hand washing. The trough didn't look like it was fresh from the plumbing supply store, however, and reminded me of the troughs that you used to see in a certain class of bars south of Market. I sniffed it suspiciously and wondered about its provenance.\n\nThe prices might not raise an eyebrow among our nouveau-arriv\u00e9 throng of youthful techies, but I don't much like the idea of a seventeen-dollar burger and fries. The old place, for all its faults, still had a decent chicken teriyaki fillet and salad for around $12. Most entr\u00e9es now appear to be in the $25-$32 range. \n\nThe burgers arrived on what appeared to be large, glazed dinner rolls. They were pretty, but the contents were pretty small (anyone remember the \"where's the beef\" commercials?)\n\nThe salmon looked to be in the range of 2.5 to 3 ounces. Very pretty on the plate, apparently tasty, but a few ounces shy of a frozen cod fillet. Plan on eating before you get there.\n\nI had the cheapest thing I could find, a $13 salad. (Okay, I could have ordered fries for $6, but that seemed overboard, or perhaps under-board.) Our waiter assured me that it was a plentiful portion. What arrived were three or four flattened leaves of red-and-white lettuce, with a dusting of bacon bits and a teaspoon of creamy dressing. I stanched some of my hunger by eating someone else's garlic fries. They were wholesome but unexceptional.\n\nOur youthful, tattooed waiter thought he had committed our orders to memory, but returned from the kitchen minus one salmon. That diner waited until the others had finished before his meal appeared. He wisely chose to receive it in a take-home bag, and our waiter wisely did not charge him for it.\n\nWe go Dutch to these dinners of ours, and the waiter dutifully separated the checks for us. I tried to give him my credit card while the others were still fumbling for cash, but he told me he wanted to wait for the others; otherwise it would be too inconvenient for him. But he took my card anyway. I waited for it to come back, but he was busy serving drinks to other tables. Finally I went up there to get my card back, and to give him three fives instead. I didn't have the right number of single bills to leave a decent tip, but...well...you might say it was not altogether an awkward outcome.\n\nWe parted company on the sidewalk outside, with the others deciding that perhaps this place should drop a notch or so down in their estimation for future culinary forays. \n\nAs for me, I went home and had dinner.", "author": "Donald J L."}

So after him being rude to her, and ultimately not keeping his cool in front of customers, we actually felt inclined to apologize to the hostess who we felt was being treated unfairly given the 1 person adjustment to our party.\n\nPrices were really high- 3 cocktails and 3 entrees and 2 starters will run you $210+ with tip. They advertised my meal as Tagliatalle, but it was more like linguine... just felt like they were trying to justify the price point with something usually associated as thicker, fresh pasta.\n\nMy mother in law's pork was smothered in a sauce and as she put it, was \"fine\".

We also had the hamachi, the mushroom crostini, and the tagliatelle. All were \"pretty good\" but when the final total came in, my opinion dropped.

One person in our group ordered a side of bacon, which was burnt and dry. I had the Fried egg and ham in a croissant, which was so flavorless I couldn't finish it . Everyone at the table had a issue with their meal. The server said he would mention it to the chef ,but I don't think the chef really cares . The food was like it was pre-made and they just through it together and heated up in a microwave.", "author": "Pat C."}

Food is fantastic (loved the salad, steak, chicken and dessert), the room is more welcoming than it was as Clement Bar and Grill, the staff is very professional and the current limited menu is better than fine.  I was expecting to order a burger, but they haven't quite solved the bun issue yet, so it's not presently on the menu.  Happily, the steak was a terrific alternative.

Each of us ordered a different entree and both the presentation and taste were top notch. We were seated near the fireplace, which added to the ambiance. The staff was inviting and service incredible.  The chef took a few minutes to share how the restaurant came to fruition. I highly recommend this place and we plan to return often and want to try their Saturday brunch next time in the area for the farmers market.", "author": "Tess G."}

We ordered simple steaks and chicken - not bad actually, with two appetizers, burrata and pork shoulder skewer - definitely small portion and not good deal for the price. The waiter didn't bring proper silverware for steak at first and it took a while to get attention while dining area was not that busy. The most annoying thing is they combine SF mandate and tax together in the restaurant copy of the bill.", "author": "Jongan S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-02-12", "description": "As someone that can walk here from where I live I was really hoping that what sounded like a bunch of fake Yelp reviews so far here on Yelp were actually true reviews....but well. 3 stars from me. The ambiance is so close. The 3 TVs above the bar that are the first thing your eyes go to when you walk in because they seem so out of place. Maybe the art is on the way. The \"private room\" fish bowl looks especially uninviting due to the lighting. Food was so incredibly mediocre for the price. Salmon cake was bland. I enjoyed the brussels but they came out room temp. We shared the steak and it also came out room temp, and while the coloring was correct (medium rare) it felt like it might have been sitting for a bit before coming to the table. Which was especially weird because, as it was Sunday evening, there were only a few other couples there. Such a great location, interiors are almost there and the bar is gorgeous. If the food matched the prices in terms of quality/creativity I would go all the time.", "author": "Kelly T."}

I made reservations for 6 of us and went with an open mind.  We were sat in the front of the restaurant which is the least impressive section. I would recommend getting seats near the back by the fire place or by the bar.  We ordered drinks first of course and were wondering why the wine was so expensive (like all the options were pricey).  We asked the waiter if they had a house wine and he said he didn't know.  We said why don't you go ask and he stood there looking at us.  We just ended up ordering some wine and then our food.  My nephew ordered a medium rare burger, my mom a half roasted chicken, I order salmon, my sister the pork dish, niece cabbage salad and sister ordered some veggies.  We ordered one appetizer (meat skewers) luckily my sister is a vegetarian because there were only 5 skewers, super small pieces of meat for the price of the appetizer.  Burger came and instead of being medium rare it was medium well, 1/2 chicken came and was more like 2 small pieces of a game hen?   We ended up leaving after everything and outside noticed the happy hour sign which we never were told about.  WE all looked at each other and the temptation to go back in and get a price adjustment for our drinks was there.  Since we probably will never go back it wasn't worth it.  The time spent with my family was fun regardless, but could have been enhanced by everything else of course.  With all the competition in SF and great restaurants don't waste your time.  Maybe check out the happy hour if you are curious?  I always try new places and keep an open mind but this was lack luster for the price you are going to pay.", "author": "Angel C."}
