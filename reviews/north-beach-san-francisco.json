Like some have mentioned at one time this was actually a beach before the development of San Francisco in the 1800's. The Barbary Coast! Essentially it came down to property value, and land is worth more money than ocean, honey, so humankind of the 19th century rearranged the coast to create what we know today. And we wonder why seals crawl all over the piers! \n\nDespite human intervention the district of North Beach is one of my favorites in the city. Main intersections are Union & Columbus, the southwest corner of Washington Square, Grant Avenue & Vallejo Street. I love the rich history, the cluster of victorian buildings, the Italian Restaurants, pizzerias, gelato shops, bakeries, euro-inspired coffee cafes, and even the sexiness of the Italian Athletic Club that has been there a century before the legendary Italian Stallion (visions of a young Stallone). \n\nThe history is rich with Italian tradition hence the popular \"Little Italy\". I mean you'll see more green, red, white colors here than you'll find in Naples. Back in the day, the DiMaggio brothers would practice playing wiffle ball in the streets, led by baseball legend, Joe DiMaggio. Dominic was the goofy brother, but still good enough to make it to the big leagues. There's even a Christopher Columbus statue in the area, the famous Italian explorer who was actually of Spanish blood, alas my love, Antonio Banderas wouldn't mind. \n\nI adore Little Italy where I can wear my Italian flag proudly while riding my classic Lambretta, Armani snuggly on, bouffant flapping in the wind. I love the Stinking Rose, Roma Coffee, and a Clean Well Lighted Books on the corner are some of my favorites. Ahhh that's amore! \n\n\"don't want a boy\nI've got a man of steel\nDon't come any closer\nI don't wanna feel, OOH!\nYour breathing, your touching\nBut nothing's for free\nI never want this to happen to me\nDon't try to change me you're wasting your time\nNow I've got something much better in mind\n\nRobert De Niro's waiting\nTalking Italian\nRobert De Niro's waiting\nTalking Italian\nRobert De Niro's waiting\nTalking Italian (Talking Italian)\nRobert De Niro's waiting...\"", "author": "Eric R."}

The possibilities are kinda endless here. That is why North Beach will be my \"150th\" review and \"3rd\" milestone review that involves The City of San Francisco or a landmark in or around the city. Plus I'm here every other Sunday if not every Sunday. So that should be a testament of how much I like this place. North Beach is where it's at, and let me brag a little about why....\n\n2 - 28 - 2016\nGetting ready for my usual SF nightlife activities. I had to stop and think to myself....\"why haven't I did a review of a place that I like to visit so much? Well now is better than never right? So as my slogan says \"I took one bart train, and later stopped at a bar and had my two shots\" Sorces say, that after you walk past the Transamerica Building you officially step into \"Little Italy\" or \"The Church of Scientology\" and for the record....they are annoying people trying to get you to take a survey or sorts..moving along. Before you cross the street after the Transamerica building, you would see the first street post at the end of Montgomery where the lamppost is adorned with the signiture \"Italian Flag\" also letting you know that you have made it to the right place. Also where Montgomery turn into my favorite street (aside from Broadway) Columbus Street!\n\nNorth Beach is home to the North Beach towers which sit on Kerney St and aside from the \"Little Italy\" aspect that North Beach is known for, lets not forget that Asian influence and Irish influence here as well, with that being said Chinatown SF and Irish Section (I don't know if that is the proper term) is here as well, and trust me....I've made my mark at those spots respectivly. North Beach is the part of SF that I feel has a lot to offer anyone that happens to come and visit, you have those down home places, and those posh places if that happens to be your thang! (yes I said thang instead of saying thing) \"Everyday is a Weekend Here\" my bartender @ Grant and Green (off Grant and Green Streets) told me. Here you would find aside from the bars and lounges and fantastic little eateries, nice little art studios and trendy clothing shops, coffee and boba joints and old churches and sightseeing galore here oh and if you're really wanting to get a nice view of SF....the Coit Tower is located in North Beach as well.  \n\nLet me break it down to you a little by what you would find on some of the streets here..\n\nKerney St - Here you would find some of those seedy massage parlors and little oriental shops and such that didn't make it in Chinatown, also at the end of the street you would find Larry Flints Hustler Club right before you hit the redlight district which is called....\n\nBroadway Street - Well I have to say, I have two dukedoms here at two places....The Condor and Penthouse SF, and yes they are Gentelmens Clubs. Hey don't judge me, they are fun places! Deja Vu Centerfolds, Garden of Eden and the Hungry Eye are also on this street, yea you have all the fake ballers and wanna be pimps that walk up and down this street, but if you wanna dance and not get a lapdance per say :D You have Hue Nightclub (formerly Atmostphere Ultra Lounge) and Monroe Lounge that would provide you with a night of calorie burning and drunken fun also instagram memes. Let's not forget Noc Noc on Broadway and Bamboo Hut is located here if you want to drink something intresting but if not you also have..\n\nGrant St - Now this is where I think you would find the Bar, Saloon, Pub, or Lounge of your dreams and me of course! this is my go too street when i'm here. When you see the \"Gold or sometimes Silver Chains and Yankees Hat\" you would know that you've spotted me and in that case....don't be afraid to say hello and have a shot with me! anywho, Grant and Green, Tope, Maggie McGarry's, The Saloon Blues Bar, Tupelo and other drinking establishments adorn this street, and you can't sometimes leave this street without being sober, i'm guilty most of the time i'm here, but if you wanna eat then you must visit the main street..\n\nColumbus Street - Here you would find that this street is like the official connection to all the hotspots here in North Beach, The Stinking Rose, Busters Cheesesteak, Taqueria Zorro, Yan's Chinese Kitchen, and Pizzelle di North Beach and let's not forget Molinari Delicatessen all sit on this street, it's like....impossible to walk on this street and not get hungry and that is only half of what's here, I still haven't named everything else but you have to see for yourself.\n\nIn closing, if you come here make sure you have some money to spend (or throw if you hang on broadway) you will need it for the Food, the Drinks, and the Uber or Lyft ride home or BART fair, because here you will indeed eat, drink and have a good time! As always Yelp your own experiences and opinions and Check In! I already have dukedom battles going on here! :D", "author": "Tre S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-19", "description": "North Beach is a neighborhood in San Francisco I've grown familiar with because one of my good friends used to live nearby, specifically, in Telegraph Hill (he's since moved to Russian Hill, so still in the same vicinity). In recent years, every time I visited the Bay Area, I'd always make it out to North Beach and we'd walk around, whether to a park, pier, bookstore, pub, cafe, or gelato shop, and hang out. This, like many other parts of San Francisco, is a cool area.\n\nThe neighborhood is popular with both tourists and locals. The touristy areas are to the north towards Fisherman's Wharf and the piers, along the Embarcadero (with cruises to Alcatraz), in the center where Coit Tower is located, and along the western and southern edges where the neighborhood borders Russian Hill (Lombard Street), Chinatown, and the Financial District (downtown). Even though the neighborhood doesn't touch any water, North Beach got its name because it used to be an actual beach. It's since been filled with landfill.\n\nBecause of all the hills, there are great vistas of the city in all directions. The best places for views and photos are at and around Coit Tower and facing southward down one of the main drags, Columbus Ave, into the Financial District. The higher elevation you are, the better, of course. Filbert St, near Coit Tower, is one of the steepest streets in the city measuring in at 17.5 degrees (31.5% grade). For those not used to the steepness of the streets, they can be terrifying to drive and park on.\n\nThe southeastern part of North Beach around Telegraph Hill sits above the Financial District. Columbus Ave feeds directly into the Transamerica Pyramid, San Francisco's iconic and tallest skyscraper. Speaking of Columbus, there are a lot of things to see and do at Columbus and Broadway. North Beach is known as San Francisco's Little Italy and there are numerous Italian restaurants and pizza joints in the vicinity. Not only that, but the area is known for its nightlife, littered in numerous bars and nightclubs, many with live entertainment. Most notably, at least as has been pointed out to me multiple times by different people, The Condor, which is supposedly the world's first topless and bottomless strip club. Oh yeah.\n\nOff the top of my head, a few good memories of places I've enjoyed and recommend in North Beach include:\n\n* Walking around Washington Square Park (http://www.yelp.com/biz/washington-square-park-san-francisco)\n* Grabbing pizza at North Beach Pizza (http://www.yelp.com/biz/north-beach-pizza-san-francisco-6)\n* Indulging at Gelato Classico Italian (http://www.yelp.com/biz/gelato-classico-italian-san-francisco)\n* Eating garlicky food at The Stinking Rose (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-stinking-rose-a-garlic-restaurant-san-francisco)\n* Checking out the historic City Lights Bookstore (http://www.yelp.com/biz/city-lights-bookstore-san-francisco)\n\nAnd while this place is technically not within North Beach boundaries, I highly recommend checking out Union Street Produce Company (http://www.yelp.com/biz/union-street-produce-company-san-francisco) for fresh produce, juices, and basic grocery store needs. The store is located just one block west of North Beach on Union St at Mason St.\n\nFinally, see if you can spot the wild parrots on the Filbert Steps (http://www.yelp.com/biz/filbert-steps-san-francisco) and check out The Saloon (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-saloon-san-francisco), San Francisco's oldest bar with live music and well-priced drinks.

I'm not an expert in San Francisco far from it. Ever since I graduated from college I have been working in the Financial District of San Francisco. I've never worked full time outside of San Francisco. Throughout the years I visited certain parts of San Francisco. There are several districts in San Francisco that have their own unique flavor. Chinatown is the largest Chinese community of China. The Mission District has Latin influence through its eateries and street food stands. The Financial District, where I work, is the business hub in the city. Of all the districts my favorite is North Beach.\n\nThere's something about North Beach that attracts locals and tourists alike. As you walk in Columbus Avenue and head toward Broadway you see the Beats influence through City Lights Bookstore. Feel naughty? On Broadway you can feel the seedy environment through the strip club and adult entertainment. Want to feel holy? There are two churches are in North Beach. The first is the Saint Francis of Assisi National Shrine. That church isn't a practicing church however the patron saint for of San Francisco is Saint Francis. The second church in North Beach is the Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church that situates on Washington Park and conducts services in several languages. Want a quick bite to eat? Then go to Golden Boy Pizza where locals flock to eat a Sicilian-style pizza with its foccacia bread crust. Ever inspire to be a writer? Have a sip of espresso at Caff\u00e8 Trieste where Francis Ford Coppola wrote the script for \"The Godfather\". \n\nPeople mostly go to North Beach to eat at the Italian restaurants hence why North Beach is referred as \"Little Italy\". These restaurants don't feature just Italian food. What makes these restaurant charming is that each restaurant specializes in their own regional cuisine whether they are Roman, Tuscan, Neapolitan, or Sicilian. (On my profile I created a list titled North Beach Eating - Italian Regional Cuisine Restaurants). The blending of different regional cultures from the same country is another example why San Francisco is considered a melting pot. When I see Italian restaurants struggling on shows such as Kitchen Nightmares or Restaurant Impossible I feel like either the owner or manager of those restaurants should come to North Beach to see how Italian restaurants thrive. It is stated that San Francisco is the most European city in this country. I've been to Europe and when you eat at one of those Italian restaurants along Columbus Avenue it is reminiscent of eating at caf\u00e9s in Europe. \n\nThe food scene at North Beach while maintaining its identity is also evolving. One example is fine dining as Michelin Star restaurants such as Gary Danko, Quince, and Coi are located in North Beach. In fact Coi is located close to a strip club. Where else can you find a fine dining restaurant next adult entertainment? That's why you have to love North Beach.\n\nI heard that North Beach in the 1970s was rough and tough. If you ever saw \"Dirty Harry\" starring Clint Eastwood you get a feel what North Beach was like back then. Throughout the hardened years North Beach has maintained its charm. When Tony Bennett sings his signature song \"I Left My Heart In San Francisco\" I feel part of the character of San Francisco is North Beach. There are a lot of tourist sites to see in San Francisco such as Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, and Alcatraz. If you're tired visiting tourist sites unwind by eating Italian regional cuisine and sipping espresso at North Beach.", "author": "Gerald R."}

Famous for having the oldest Italian restaurant in America and also associated to such popular names like baseball player, Joe DiMaggio; North Beach truly has a rich history. \n\nEven home to Coit Tower and Pier 39, this location is a prime area for tourism and amazing food and sightseeing. \n\nI always have a great time exploring this district.

But this area of town felt a bit like my \"other home\" more than 6k away. Chinatown was already spreading its wings over this barrio, I imagine the only Italian things left now are the usual expensive Italian restaurants.

And when the old Embarcadero Freeway was up (before the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake), the on ramp was just down Broadway and I loved the quiet here as I headed off to work. I also enjoyed the variety of activities available within a few short blocks and the neighbourhood's Peter and Paul anchor with their living room park in front. And then there's the opera singing at Cafe Trieste.... \n\nThe neighborhood is San Francisco's Little Italy and still has the associated restaurants, pastry, and culture, especially along Columbus and Grant Avenues and Washington Square. The beatnik culture (with an assist from City Lights Books) started here and the red light and other nightlife areas are close at hand. So is the young professional and Chinatown expansion that has compacted the Italian flavour.\n\nThe area largely known today as North Beach was an actual beach, filled in with landfill around the late 19th century. Warehouses, fishing wharves, and docks were then built on the newly formed shoreline. Due to the proximity of the docks, the half of the neighborhood south of Broadway was home of the infamous Barbary Coast.\n\nFollowing its reconstruction after the 1906 Earthquake, the proximity of the nearby docks and fishing wharves attracted a large amount of Italian immigrants that would create the Italian character of the neighborhood that exists to this day. And due its past legacy as the Barbary Coast, Broadway east of Columbus, grew to be the home of the city's red light district and striptease clubs.", "author": "Eric B."}

I always find this funny.\n\nI love North Beach almost as much as I love City Lights.  Scratch that.  I love City Lights truly.  I love North Beach because of City Lights.  Or at least that's about 47 percent of the reason I love North Beach.  I always get suckered into coming here on a weekend with out-of-towners, and that bothers me, and then I don't come here for months because of this, and that's a shame.  I should come on a Tuesday night.  I will, in fact, once the spring semester ends.\n\nPeople need to love this city.  Enough people love this neighborhood, but I encourage all of them to love this city.  That's North Beach's problem, really:  Its residents love their neighborhood more than they love their city.  I can understand this.  I think at one point I loved my neighborhood more than I loved San Francisco.  But then I realized my neighborhood was a lie, or that I had been on the wrong side of a poorly argued argument.  Don't get me wrong; I love my neighborhood.  But some of its residents?  Hm.\n\nPeople named Alberto want to live in North Beach.  In another time, as a different person, I would want to live in North Beach.  If you gave me a cheapish rent-controlled apartment with a tomato-sauce can turned into a WiFi antenna--no joke, a North Beach resident I knew did this, and it worked!--I might just take it.  Because there's a cafe culture, if not a coffeehouse culture.\n\nIt's everything the Mission and 9th & Irving and Clement Street want to be but aren't.  It's important in life to be good at being yourself, not at trying to be or lamenting not being other people.  So, North Beach, keep getting on with your bad self.  But remember that there are people who live all over this city who love you.  We really do.  We can abide awkward sibling-birthday-party arguments and good pizza chains that serve mediocre pizza when you export them to other neighborhoods and even Mona Lisa, but we can't put up with self-importance.  You're important, but you're not that important.\n\nHopefully, the Big One will liquefy the Marina and Fisherman's Wharf (with no casualties), and then you'll once again have an honest-to-goodness beach.

Another great positive dining expierence here in SF.", "author": "Carlie R."}

But I do not love the amount of crime.  And I feel it's been getting worse every year.\nShootings at night clubs and gun fire that I hear at night (no, it's not just firecrackers.  those were gun shots.), fights on the streets (sure, drunk out-of-towners having a little too much fun along Broadway), pedestrians getting hit by cars (I've been the victim of a hit-and-run on my bike.  I wasn't hurt, but I don't ride it much anymore.).  \nTheft (my car has been stolen twice.  radio is long gone.  Torn right out of the dash.  Along with most of the dashboard, thanks. why would the second thief break into and steal an old car with no radio?)\nCar windows broken and little cubes of blue glass all over the street curbs.  Lots of broken car windows on the streets and sidewalks.  (Walk down Bay Street over by the water processing plant.)\nAnd the homeless situation is really bad.  Both the people just sitting on the sidewalks asking for change and the scary ones with few teeth and sores on their faces staggering down Columbus in a drug stupor.\nSure, it's city-living, but it's not the charming, beatnik-flavored neighborhood you think it is.  Just being honest.  Our ability to ignore dying people on our city streets is tough to handle.  I think that untreated mental illness is a contributing factor as well and that's something that scares most people from helping too.\nAnd I could do without the vomiting tourists at 3AM outside my window too as they stumble back the wharf hotels.\nOtherwise, the food's great.  Bars are fun.  And parking sucks. \nFinally, housing prices aren't worth what sellers think a creaky old 100 year old building is worth.\nI feel sad that my neighborhood is just not safe anymore.\nPlease watch your surroundings and you'll probably be o.k.", "author": "Kev M."}

North Beach is not what it was three years ago. Now it's a crime ridden scary place to be, with cop cars outnumbering pedestrians. Just ask the cab drivers. If you can find one because even they are staying away! Recently it took me 30 minutes to even find one and when I finally did, I asked the cabbie what was up. His answer? NB is too ghetto. Why just last week a 65 year old man was robbed as he was coming home from a market at 11pm. So beware and plan to wait a good long while for a ride home.", "author": "a p."}

Even amidst countless tourists, you still see the same faces at the coffee shops or at Washington Square park.\n\n-Amazing restaurants\n\n--Adorable, quality caffes\n\n-Touristy places as well as old-world Italian restaurants (gotta love the kitschy mixed with the traditional)\n\n-Friendly folks and their dogs\n\n-I love that in the morning I am greeted by Chinese people doing tai chi in the park as I leave my apartment. I love that at night when I'm coming home to my apartment, the drunken SF youth wander the streets in search of their next bar destination. Seriously, I love that kind of duality in a neighborhood.\n\n-Great nightlife\n\n-It's versatility--pleasant and cheery by day, sometimes sexy and sometimes funky at night. \n\n-Many cute boutiques, funky vintage stores as well\n\n-A mix of residents, but mostly young. I like that my neighbors are both the old Italian woman who runs the bakery down the street as well as the sexy young couple\n\n\n North Beach has this indescribable quality, a feeling you get walking around its sidestreets and steep hills that you're in a true community. The people here know each other, but life is never boring. You're in San Francisco!! \n\nMan, I love North Beach.", "author": "Nicole R."}
