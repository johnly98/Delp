This was one of those times where we relied purely on the Yelp reviews and it everything turned out just fine.  My family of four had the vegetable fried rice, seafood chow mein, and string bean with beef in oyster sauce (mild).  The portions were very generous and the tastes were excellent!  We were pleasantly surprised at how much seafood the chow mein had!  It had scallops, squid, and shrimp.  I've never had string bean beef with oyster sauce but the tastes were reminiscent of beef and broccoli.  The string beans were cooked just right and still had a bit of crunch to them.  This is a dish I would definitely come back for.\n\nGive this place a try because the reviews do this place justice...", "author": "Dan L."}

Specially if you're here for Peking Duck (like we were). We ordered a full Peking duck and it arrived already carved, looking suspiciously smaller than a full duck, and definitely not enough for 4 people. On asking the servers (who were very nice) we were told they serve it almost boneless (which was true) so that's why it looks like it's less. The duck was fine, skin was crispy, but the sauce was just okay and it was served with tortilla instead of pancakes or buns. \nBecause we (4 people) were no where near full,  also ordered sizzling chicken and the tai chin chicken which were also just about okay (I'd go with the Tai Chin chicken- the sauce and chicken were decent). Btw none of this was cheap. \nAll in all, a very meh experience. You can find something much better in SF.", "author": "Sarmishtha S."}

For starters, I'm not a fan of hot water and that was all that we got for about 5 minutes before our drink order was taken. On the drink subject, my water was never refilled but that's not too big of a deal. Pot stickers were absolutely delicious but the soup that you get automatically wasn't my favorite. Extremely sour and the spice grows on you pretty quickly. \n\nTo the main course, my sweet and sour pork was flavorful and super tasty. However I will say that my dish came out something like 10 minutes before my lunch date's. If I'm completely honest, I was starving so I did start early but I would rather they hold my food in the back than bring it out that early?? Just my opinion, but it seemed a bit rude of them. The food wasn't overpriced and like I said, the place was pretty Americanized. Nice place for lunch just a couple hiccups in the service.", "author": "Cara H."}

So I decided to give this place a try.\n\nComing in there was already a wait and I noticed there were lots of tour groups inside dining in. There's only one table chair outside the entrance way, and after a few minutes we went inside their small wait area near the cashier booth. It was a Wednesday night, and it took about 15 minutes to finally get seated. \n\nWe ordered the \"Steamed Chicken\" ($13.45). Its bone-in half chicken. You can't really get much taste out of these boiled pieces of meat, unless they provide a house sauce with it, but unfortunately we didn't get any. Other than its topped with shreds of onions and ginger, your left soy sauce on the table for added seasoning. Its not bad, but we've had better. \"Chicken with Spicy Garlic Sauce\" ($12.45). These deep fried orange chunks of chicken, tasted okay. It was mildly spicy and the glaze on the outside is sweet. The \"Beef Fried Rice\" ($9.95). I would pass up on these. There's not much to say about this fried rice, it's an easy make. It has a decent amount of beef and vegetables in it, but it tasted a little on the bland side. \n\nOverall, service was good and everyone here was friendly. However, the food quality is pretty much basic and average for the high prices. \n\nHunan has good local ratings and its a favorite for tourist.

The atmosphere is very laid back and commonly active as I welcomed there. The concept is much similar and identical than any local Chinese restaurant across the U.S. although inside it's much original and classic for their interior with modest space floor.\n\nThe employees here from serves and cookers are doing a good job for making the customers like me a collective and remarkable service despite the busiest environment. No cons at all.\n\nNow onto the food! Since there is no combination plates on the menu, I ordered my favorite Chinese food, Broccoli Beef with a side of a bowl of steamed Jasmine rice. As I ate it, the broccoli beef tasted alright although it tasted bitter as I thought. Kinda sourly after eating it constantly instead of being too savory of that entree. I wish they need to enhance the broccoli beef more savory and elegant next time without being to bitter. Also, on the other hand, the steamed white Jasmine rice did cooked perfectly! Fluffy and eatable without being too soft. Overall, not a bad meal for lunch.\n\nParking at Hunan Home's can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. You can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nAll in all, Hunan Home's is the finest and closely averaged traditional Chinese restaurant that I've ever visited for the very first time. Hopefully, I'll be back again in the near future to try out their foods if it tasted better. A well visit indeed. My rating: 3 1/4 solid stars", "author": "William L."}

I was super hungry but I really wanted to indulge in some traditional/authentic food. Hunan Home's Restaurant came up in the Yelp search engine with some promising reviews. Therefore, we decided to check it out!\n\nHunan Home's Restaurant is located in the heart of China Town (San Francisco). It is on Jackson Street, between Grant Avenue and Kearny Street. A large sign outside of the restaurant displays its name in English and Chinese. You really can't miss it!\n\nWhen we walked inside, we were greeted and seated right away. It's a lot larger inside than you would think. There are two levels, an upstairs dining room as well as a lower level. Tables are in close proximity to one another to maximize the number of customers that can be seated at any time.\n\nWe had a bit of a language barrier as we attempted to communicate with our waiter. I ended up ordering fried rice with just egg and shrimp. My husband ordered the combination plate. \n\nThey asked us what we'd like to drink and I asked for a Coca Cola product. We sat at our table for a bit and my drink did not make it to our table. Soon after, our food was served but my Coke was still missing. We had to get our waiter's attention and let him know that I had my food but not my drink. I honestly started to eat my rice while we attempted to find the waiter. He was very busy so it was tough getting his attention.\n\nMy rice was ok but the shrimp did not taste that great. It had a strong fishy flavor. The shrimp didn't sit well with me so I focused more on the rice and egg . I just set the shrimp to the side and my husband helped me eat it. The food wasn't bad by any means but I felt that it was just okay. \n\nI love authentic restaurants because the Americanized version of ethnic food never does it any justice. Our experience at Hunan Home's Restaurant was interesting. I liked that their staff was friendly and that their patrons were of different ethnicities. In the end, I had mixed feelings about this place. The food was alright but service was off a bit.", "author": "Michelle T."}

Because of our schedule, we knew we'd only have time for one meal in Chinatown, so we wanted to make it good. Of course, we turned to Yelp to see what sounded like a winner. We happened to be in close proximity to Hunan House and based on the reviews we gave it a try. \n\nI do have to say that this was BY FAR the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. However, the caveat is that we're from Ohio so the selections we have here are not that great (all of the chicken I've ever had from a Chinese restaurant tends to be questionable). AND I'm not the most adventurous, so I only ever get sweet & sour chicken. But I do have to say that this is the best sweet & sour chicken I've ever had and there's no way it could ever be topped. The chicken was excellent quality; all pure white meat with a crisp, flaky coating. Not anything drenched in coating like I've gotten at other places. The sauce was excellent as well. \n\nThe interior is okay. I was actually very surprised at how big it is on the inside! There was a whole other downstairs seating area (which is where we were sat). I was a little disappointed because we were cold (we had just come from Golden Gate bridge and it was in March so kind of chilly) and the downstairs area of the restaurant was freezing! For whatever reason, we got sat right underneath a vent and it was blowing out cold air! Even when we asked to be re-seated, I still had to keep my jacket on the entire time. \n\nAs for the service, it almost seemed we were an inconvenience. Our server did not smile once and I felt like he was very angry/unhappy.

So if you are clusterphobic then godspeed to you :P... now the waiting game to get seated....\n\nLuckily, we managed to be seated no longer than 10 minutes because we're just a party of two. Bizzarely, they asked us if we can be seated to a group since they have two seats available on that area.. yeap we did say yes because of starvation. It is pretty interesting to be seated with some local people and they were friendly. They said that this restaurant is one of the best. I was a little skeptical since the ambiance is not enthicing, but wow I was wrong.\n\nThe food is a killer.. No Panda Express or PF Chang here ladies and gents. They served the real deal Chinese cuisine. Of course, they have menus like orange chicken for tourist that is afraid to venture from their comfort zone, but my girl and I are nothing alike. I ordered their mushu beef, which I can described it as the Chinese food version of a burrito because they gave you rice wraps to blanket their delicious meaty beef. They gave you their sweet oyster sauce to enhanced the flavor as well. So good and unique to my taste.. sign me up! I like this dish. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered their crispy fried chicken and shumai (pork meat dumplings). One of my awesome advise, if you're going to a Chinese restaurant is to order their fried chicken. It is a little salty than your average KFC, but Colonel Sanders will be jealous because if its crispiness and mouth watering flavor. The shumai on the other hand is always a great appetizer to start any Chinese meal.

If your looking for some Chinese food I would recommend this place if you wanna get seated and food in 15 minutes. There wasn't any wait for us. As of the food is waa good just like any average Chinese restaurant. We were craving Dim Sum but the wait across from this restaurant was ridiculous. As of the menu if your looking for dishes with shrimp they call it Prawns compared to Chinese restaurants back home. Cleanliness of the bathroom was good there was only 2 stalls and it was downstairs. Service was average. But I would recommend going here if your craving chinese.

Looked up on yelp and saw that they had a lot of reviews so we decided to try it out to see what the hype was all about.\n\nPros:\n- Wait time wasn't that long, when we came by there there a short long with a few people in front. Got in, in about 10ish minutes\n- They have a downstairs area which is probably more spacious than the one in front. I didn't feel all squish together next to people\n- Food came out fast\n- A lot of food to choose from\n- We got the yang chow fried rice, sweet and sour pork, egg flower soup, shredded jellyfish, and honey walnut prawns. 4 out of 5 was delish. The egg flower soup wasn't that great. The honey walnut prawns was really good, the prawns were large. The fried rice was good. The sweet and sour pork was the winner, it has a torchy taste to it (if you've has a sushi roll that was torched on top, it has that flavor) we both really enjoyed it.\n\nCons:\n- Not sure why our tea was spilling when we were pouring it. It spilled all over the table, but since the workers were so busy, they weren't at the table long enough for us to even get their attention\n- Chairs and tables needs to be updated\n\nOverall,\nI personally think the sweet and sour pork was the main reason for the 4 stars, it was delish :)", "author": "Vonnie T."}

One of the most bothersome things is high ratings on foods that people have no business reviewing, so I can't be a hypocrite and give it a 5. My argument for a 4? \"Yay!

Included soup and put sticker are pottery good too.\n\nI've got a salty palate, so I add just a dash of salt to the Roast pork, but it's super tender and delicately flavored.\n\nThe interior is standard divey cafe, but they're friendly and the Roast pork is legit.\n\nNow, this review is solely based on the Roast pork dish, which means I'll have to come back to try the curry stew, zha jiang mian, and other stuffs later.

Well I'm here to help you my friend! Look no more and stop by this place. The service is amazing, the food is delicious and the prices are up to par.\n\nFour of us stopped by and they seated us right away. I noticed that as soon as people leave they clean their tables and have them ready to go for whoever comes in. In fact the entire time we were there I never noticed anyone waiting longer than five minutes. Pretty impressive for such a small/medium restaurant. They handed us menus and hot tea. We ordered our drinks. The drinks came in soda cans and a cup with ice, different but neat. \n\nThe food: we ordered egg rolls as an appetizer. They came out almost instantly and they were nice and warm and crispy. With a side of sweet sauce it was a great starter. For the main course we ordered orange Kung pao chicken, chicken orange peel, prawns with walnut, combo chow mein and white rice. \n\nThe Kung pao chicken was the best I've had, nice and spicy and the chicken was delicious. Orange peel chicken was crispy and full of flavor. The prawns with walnut, taste like honey walnut shrimp but more scrumptious. The chow mein was also full of flavor and plenty of shrimp, chicken and pork meat. We each filled our plates and they had Chilli paste that was also so delicious. The perfect Chilli to top your rice and chow mein with. All that food was able to feed us not just once, but twice. Yes we all got seconds. We actually finished everything on the table and almost wished we had ordered more. \n\nThe servers checked in on us every now and then and cleared plates we were done with instantly. \n\nTo top it off the bill was the cheapest bill we had seen on our entire trip there. \n\nDefinitely stop by this place if you're ever in Chinatown. You won't regret it.", "author": "Andrea A."}

We were told to expect a 25 minute wait but they were asking people if they were OK with sitting together at the bigger tables and we ended up sitting with a family of 4 so we waited 15 minutes ish only. We ordered decisively and quickly but the food came out SO quickly too, it was incredible (especially because we were starving).\n\nWe got the xiao long bao which are the soup dumplings, and I've had Din Tai Fung, I've had Mama Lu's all in LA/SGV area but this was pretty good. Not as good as Din Tai Fung but similar to Mama Lu's. It was under $7 for 6 of these and it was piping hot. What I didn't like about theirs was that the skin of the dumpling was too thick. We also got a small sizzing rice soup which was great, my preference is always the watery kind not the corn starch thickened and it was again, super quick. The timing was perfect, as soon as we ate the dumplings, the soup came out and just as we finished with our soup, our kung pao deluxe came out. The kung pao deluxe had a nice and spicy kick to it, came with large shrimp, pieces of beef, chicken and bell peppers. The prices were cheap to reasonable and I was impressed by the operations of this place, runs like a well oiled machine. Service was super prompt and we never waited for anything. The only thing that could've made this place better was if they had kimchi as my Korean palette-d husband said.\n\nOh and as we were finishing our meal the other family was getting their food and everything looked incredible. The Mu Shu, the fried dumplings, pan fried noodles all looked amazing, my husband and I should've extended the olive branch first and just shared our food lol.\n\nThis is a no frills straight up Chinese restaurant and I highly recommend this place!!", "author": "Amy K."}

I had searched on Yelp for some good Chinese food around the SF area. I will give my rating in sectiona based on Food and the location/appearance of the restaurant.\n\nThe food was definitely a 5, no arguing. I came with family and we ordered Kung pao chicken, broccoli with beef, beef with baby corn, shrimp and pork fried rice and chicken chow mein. I could say I had a pretty good example of what most people would order if they came here. The menu was large and had a variety of different meats, in different styles. The actual food that I ordered was very tasty, flavorful and just damn delicious. I would like to warn you that the kung pao chicken is a bit spicy so if you can't handle the heat, you could probably tell them to do no spicy. Overall, all the food came out steaming hot.\n\nHunans is located in the heart of Chinatown and is surrounded by the usual hustle and bustle of people walking and many other store fronts. The store itself is quite easy to find but parking on the otherhand is a challenge. Although there is a structure nearby it can fill up easily and usually all the parking in front of the stores are taken depending on the time you visit. The restaurant itself is what you would expect of a store in Chinatown. Its a bit old and small but honestly I didn't care and I don't think it is a good reflection on the overall rating of this restaurant.", "author": "Troy Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-09", "description": "At first I didn't know what to make of Hunan Home's. I've never been here with my family and I can understand why. Most of the customers aren't Asian and it's catered more to non-Chinese because of it's location near North Beach. I was skeptical on whether or not this place had authentic Chinese food or Panda Express style food.\n\nThe decor of this place seems very Chinatown old school style (fish tank in the front, pink table cloths, green seats and decor). The staff here seems like they've worked here for a long time too. It sort of feels like I'm time traveling to back to the early 1900s (they actually opened in 1983). Or maybe even from that Chinese restaurant scene in Rush Hour. \n\nCompared to other Chinese restaurants, Hunan Home's food is more flavorful and they have more \"entertaining foods\" like showing you the sizzling effects of the beef/rice crackers in front of you.\n\n-Peking Duck: Love the duck. The fattiest duck I've ever had. Almost tasted like butter. Seriously amazing.\n-Sizzling Rice Soup: Pretty cool how they place the soup out first and then add the rice crackers, which instantly crackles in the hot soup! Pretty cool.\n-Sizzling Beef: One of the few/only Chinese restaurants in the bay area I've been to that sizzles the beef right in front of you. I guess the sizzling trick is great entertainment for foreigners? haha.\n-Dry-Fried Green Beans with Ground Pork: I thought it would be really spicy with the red chilies, but it's barely spicy. Not bad. \n-Xiao Long Bao: Not the best. Skin was thick, not enough broth, and meat was just okay. \n-Shrimp Fried Rice: Very flavorful and oily. Shrimp is fresh. Would recommend!\n-Salt and Pepper Fish: Very delicious. I'm not really interested in fried foods but this was delicious. Very hot and fresh and crispy.\n\nThis place is very fascinating. I've never seen such a diverse mix of people inside a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown before. It's pretty interesting to just sit and watch everyone, actually. Haha.\n\nI would absolutely come again. Definitely make a reservation because this place is packed. I highly recommend the peking duck, shrimp fried rice, and salt & pepper fish!", "author": "Vicki L."}

My family loves it, but we don't have much choice coming from Santa Barbara. On a recent overnighter to SF, we made it a point to check out some \"more real\" Chinese. Found Hunan Home's Restaurant on Yelp and it did not disappoint! Located towards the north end of Chinatown, there was an understandable 10-15 minute wait for the 5 of us on a Saturday evening at 6:30pm, even after calling ahead (which we were told didn't guarantee a table anyway). The restaurant was cozy/homey and well staffed. Nothing fancy, but relatively clean and comfortable. We had some very basics: egg rolls, orange peel chicken, prawns with broccoli, combination chow mein and pork fried rice. All I can say is that it was like seeing in color after only seeing in B&W.\n\nEgg rolls and filling were so hot and crisp they literally exploded with each bite. Chicken had a nice crunchy exterior and liberal amount of orange zest and spice to it. Prawns were huge and perfectly cooked. Chow Mein had a nice touch of crunchy cabbage mixed in and a wonderful texture to the noodles. Pork fried rice was light and fluffy - I almost didn't recognize it, compared to the heavy, grease-laden stuff I am used to.\n\nMenu appeared quite extensive beyond what we had. Service was attentive and efficient, with perfect pacing of the dishes - portions were standard, and I didn't find the prices unreasonable. I can't make a testament to the more exotic fare, but in the category of basic, solid Chinese in America, Home's has got my vote. Will definitely be returning to explore more of the menu!", "author": "Kim R."}

Hunan Homes have opened up for more than two decades as I know, the restaurant has become a very popular place to eat in San Francisco . The word Hunan comes from a name of a provenience in Southeast China. Hunan food is known for making their food very spicy. This restaurant has a nice size and ambiance, but the important thing about this place is that the food is excellent not just the way the place looks.

Was just okay. Super greasy.\n\nSERVICE\nWe ordered a seafood soup with rice crackers, and when the server brought the soup to the table, he scooped the soup evenly (or he was trying to) into 3 smaller bowls for us.

There is no take a number or put your name on a list, you need to stand in line in the small entrance and make sure no one cuts you. The server's didn't seem to care that they were there , but they were at least efficient.

There are simply too many from which to choose (which is not a complaint).  \n\nI settled on Hunan Home's (sic) perhaps because the wildly creative placement of an apostrophe in \"Home's\" signaled that the kitchen would also turn out equally inspired creations.  In the end though, the kitchen turns out standard Chinese restaurant fare from a heaping big menu served piping hot.  The apostrophe is likely just an amusing error.\n\nTwo of us opted for Egg Rolls ($4.50), Mongolian Beef, Sizzling Platter Bean Curd, and rice.  One beer was ordered and the whole thing, pre-tip, clocked in at just under $40.  This is why we dine in Chinatown, no?  \n\nThe beef in the Mongolian was cut a bit thicker than usual (making it chewier than usual) and the portion size was a bit smaller than other restaurants serve up.  This Mongolian Beef was not my favorite version.  \n\nThe tofu was brought out along with a smoking hot cast iron platter and it did indeed sizzle madly when the waiter emptied pot onto platter.  As with the beef, the tofu was also presented in large chunks.  Someone in the kitchen prefers hunks of things to delicately presented offerings as well as portion sizes a tad smaller than you may find elsewhere.  \n\nI really enjoyed the egg rolls.  \n\nThere's probably a million other places equally pleasing, possibly on the same block, but if someone again suggested Hunan Home's I'd say why not?

The garage is only a few blocks away, so this was a nice start.\n\nEverything else... was just sad. It took about 15 minutes to get seated (despite having open tables... which they could have their own reasons so no harm done here). For Chinese, the food is really expensive ($12 per entree) and it. is. small. Based on average serving sizes at other restaurants, you can easily eat one and probably two entrees per person. This is the first time I've ever left a restaurant still hungry (as well as everyone else in my family.) \n\nOkay, so the portion size is small. But does it taste good? We got the Xiao Long Bao, the hot and sour soup, the mushroom scallops, the Mongolian beef, and the something pork. In short, the XLB was alright, the scallops were pretty good, the pork was pretty good but had a lot of gristle and fat, and the Mongolian beef, in my opinion, was very mediocre. The hot and sour soup was very interesting and actually like-able though, so there is that.\n\nSince it's sometimes easier to understand by comparison, let's just say a typical Panda express 2-entree meal will have double the food (and more meat), taste a bit better, is $5-7 cheaper per person, and doesn't involve a wait.

It was in 1980-something, I think. I met Henry Chung, bought the cookbook, and Henry even signed it. \n\nHenry's gone now but I have been to Hunan-related restaurants since ( I can never tell which ones are Henry-Chung-related and which are copies) and all were good but none matched my memory. Until now. \n\nI don't think this place is Henry-related but no matter -- this visit reminded me of those days. The food was as good as I remembered and I thought, \"why can't there be any Chinese food like this in the South Bay?\" (There used to be but I don't see anything of this caliber anymore.) (But, I digress.)\n\nThe hot and sour soup was classic. Too often H&S soup has the hot, has the sour, but that's it. Without an underlying foundation, it comes up shallow and uninteresting. Not here -- this was meaty and big, complex and rich. I could make a meal of this.\n\nWhere are the onion pancakes I remember from the old Hunan? Missing, unfortunately. \n\nHunan's headliner was always the Harvest Pork, made from slices of ham, smoked on-premise. This did not disappoint and was as I remembered it. Savory and smoky, not too salty and not too spicy (which I have experienced at other Hunan-y places). This was spot-on. \n\nMongolian beef was well made though oddly did not have the classic rice noodles. No matter, it was great and not too spicy. \n\nShrimp with walnuts -- a crowd pleaser and well executed: Crispy, saucy, crunchy. \n\nSeveral other dishes were all equally well prepared. \n\nService was efficient and courteous. \n\nWinner, winner, stir-fried dinner!", "author": "Moe R."}

You won't by any means be disappointed, but you won't be blown away either. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nEven on a weekend evening the abundant seating at Hunan is such that you likely won't be waiting longer than 30 or so minutes, which is a rarity in the city. From there, while the ordering process and food delivery can take a bit of time it's not impossible to be in and out in an hour or so. Dumplings in particular come out quickly, so keep that in mind if you're hungry from the get go. Star Granted.\n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nThe benchmark by which all Xiao Long Bao are and should be compared is without question Din Tai Fung (http://www.yelp.com/biz/din-tai-fung-arcadia-5), which run $1.05 each. At $1.16 each, the XLB here at Hunan are a bit more expensive, but they're a bit larger in portion size as well. The other standard Chinese dishes run just above $10 and maybe a bit closer to $15 once you bring the necessary rice into the mix, which is in line with the market rate. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nMy party of three enjoyed our meal here at Hunan, but nothing really blew us away. The Xiao Long Bao was fine, although lacked a bit in flavor, and my Kung Pao Chicken was a bit weak with nearly twice as many vegetables as chicken. The other two in my party opted for the Chicken Fried Rice, and while I'll credit the hefty portion size neither seemed overly thrilled and didn't end up finishing their dishes. Hunan is a bit of a jack of all trades, and while they don't shatter the competition with any one dish they do everything reasonably well. Single Star Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nThere's simply too much competition in the area for Hunan to really stand out in my opinion, but they're a jack of all trades that will satisfy just about any party.

First of all it's a small restaurant, Service shouldn't be that difficult but it was. You literally had to flag the waiter down to order or get your bill and it took them a long time to pick up payment. Still, I have to say the orange chicken, Kung Pao Beef and the fried rice were really, really good! Wanton's were not the best they were ok. They don't take reservations and if there is a lot of people you will be waiting a long time. As usuall, parking in SF sucks but there is a parking garage down the street. Despite there being a moon festival we didn't have to wait a long time to be seated but 30 min after we arrived it started to get busy and some people left because they did not want to wait.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-11", "description": "One of the items on my San Francisco bucket list was to eat at a restaurant in Chinatown.  \n\nIn my search of authentic Chinese, of course I turned to Yelp.  Hunan's Home had over 800 positive reviews so I thought it had to be a sure thing.  \n\nWe walked there from The Embarcadero so we didn't have to worry about parking. There were meters on the street out front but I didn't see any available spaces.  The interior was what you might find in other Chinese restaurants:  a fish tank near the entrance, zodiac placemats and faux bamboo in the dining room.  It was lunchtime but we didn't have to wait for a table.  \n\nOur server was ready to take our order before I even got a good look at the menu.  I don't think he was trying to rush us.  I think he was used to dealing with people who hurry to get in and out during their lunch hour and he was trying to be efficient.  He used Chinese characters to scribble our orders on a mint green notepad...loved that.\n\nI got Egg Flower Soup and Moo Shu Chicken.  The soup was filled with clots of scrambled egg instead of light ribbons of egg.  It tasted fine but clearly someone in the kitchen didn't stir the soup properly.  It wasn't served with any crispy fried noodles either for some reason. \n \nFor the Moo Shu they brought out two plates--one for the Chinese pancakes and plum sauce, another for the chicken and vegetable filling.  The vegetables were overcooked (with browned edges) and the flavors weren't interesting.  I ate less than half my order.  My dad just picked at his Fried Rice and my son was indifferent about his Chicken Lo Mein.\n\nAfter our meal, the server brought out fortune cookies, orange slices and a pot of jasmine tea.  I didn't think I would like the tea since there wasn't any honey or sweetener to go with it but it had a nice floral flavor.  The oranges were the sweetest I've tasted in a long time.\n\nNone of us thought the food warranted so much acclaim from Yelpers.  Our entr\u00e9es were so mediocre.  One star for helping me check the item off my list, another star for the service and one half star for the food.  2.5 stars.", "author": "Andrea T."}

It was great food, love the steamed rice and the string bean chicken. The wonton soup is the best. Although a few months ago after being away for at least three years has changed. I believe under new ownership, found myself confused when there was a line out the door???? The most waiting would be inside the lobby area with a few ppl, I got a sit quickly during previous Christmas shopping weeks so this was odd. I did not recognize the person managing the front. The food was very bland and which was very odd, the food is usually very flavorful.

I thought they were large enough to share or enough for an individual.  The flavor was very good and the prawns were very large and there were probably about 5 to 6 large prawns mixed in with the chicken. However the chicken bits were all dark meat, I wish I would have known that.  They seemed a bit under done and chewy.  I didn't eat much of the chicken.  The Eggplant was plentiful in large stalks.  \n\nMy Fianc\u00e9 ordered the Hunan chicken.  Good flavor in the sauce.   Lots of colorful vegetables, and crisp not mushy.  Chicken was all dark meat bits as well, good but a bit chewy.  One odd thing was that there were a few pieces of beef in the dish that shouldn't have been in there.  \n\nThis restaurant was recommended by the Hilton where we stayed and very close proximity to the hotel.

They were right, it was delicious, very light and crispy texture.  It was tasty but the portion was kind of small.\n\nI wanted a noodle dish, i was hoping they had chow fun noodles, but they didn't, kind of odd to me, but maybe thats just the cuisine.  When it came out i thought it was kind of disappointing, the portion was small and there was very little seafood.  I liked the crispy noodles, i like when they are crispy then you let all the sauce soak into it all.  The sauce was kind of bland too, you could taste the seafood, but very subtle, i added soy sauce to it for a more bold flavor.  It was okay but i wished i ordered something different maybe the chicken and asparagus with black bean sauce.\n\nThe prices are decent but the portions are on the smaller side, 1 entree per person + rice should be enough.  It wasn't bad, I'd order the orange peel chicken again.", "author": "Ryan M."}

We arrived right before a large tour group having taken the recommendation of fellow yelpers. We waited about five minutes. No reservations and they make you stand in line. We ordered the wonton soup, potstickers and sizzling beef and scallops. The wonton soup was spicy with plenty of wontons. Definitely for two. The potstickers were huge and tasty. Beware of the sizzling beef and scallops. It came with a spicy black bean sauce. We didn't realize that it was spicy and my husband ate a green pepper and turned beet red. He needed a glass of water or two. It was so good we are trying to decide the cheapest way to get back there from our hotel at SFO.", "author": "Jocelyn B."}

OMG.  Ok, so I put that in the back of my mind as I ate, chalking it up to being an old building in Chinatown - I get it.  But it just keeps going.  We all get our food as it comes available, so some people are practically done by the time the last person got served - but that wasn't the last person either - my son's order could not be made because they didn't have jellyfish at the time.  Why did we have to wait until all the food had been served to find this out??  So we ended up just sharing whatever we had left with him.  The service was sub-par - they hardly tended to us at all.  Then I went to the restroom.  Ok, I get that it's an old building but it smelled like mildew and one of the stalls didn't lock so I ended up opening the door on a very surprised lady.  On my way out my sons were looking at the live crab tank and by now I wasn't surprised to see all the gunk and dead shrimp carcasses on the outside of the tank.  At the door I made a point to look around for their Food Facility Inspection grade and couldn't find it anywhere inside or outside.  No surprise there.", "author": "Zazil A."}

This means they no longer impart as much of a smokey flavor to the dish and instead make it a little spicier.

I mistakenly ate what I thought was a green bean- nope it was a green chili that had my eyes tearing and nose running for 5 minutes!\n\nAll in all the food would get a perfect five except for the orange chicken- the bacon flavor was overwhelming and the hard glaze and jerky consistency was not my favorite. Despite the chicken dish the food was high quality and delicious.", "author": "A P."}

I cant believe we sidestepped other restauants that had high ratings and total number of reviews. We didnt have that long a wait to be seated. We went during the week. My friend ordered the kung pao with shrimp and I ordered the wonton soup. His meal came out in less than 5 mins! leaving us to wonder if it was properly cooked. It was unremarkable and bland. The soda we ordered as well as my wonton soup seemed to have been lost. I had to get the waiters attention to inquire of its whereabouts. It wasnt worth the wait. The soup had no taste to it. We were too disappointed in the experience. As we were getting ready to leave the patrons who came and sat next ti us apparently ordered a kung pao and also had shock on their faces of how quickly it came to the table. The female diner had our same perplexed look and said that was under 5 mins. We even planned to stop at another restaurant for dumplings but the experience had us leaving chinatown as quickly as possible.\nWould not recommend!", "author": "Racquel S."}

Here's what I ordered:\n\nYang Chow Fried Rice (with BBQ pork and shrimp) 3/5\nThe flavors were very subtle..maybe too subtle, but the bits of pork were tasty and when I got the perfect bite of rice, pork, and egg it was quite delicious\n\nCombination Chow Mein 3/5\nGood flavor in the chicken, beef and noodles, although the shrimp had hardly any flavor and the dish was pretty oily..noodles kept slipping through my chop sticks :(\n\nSweet and Sour Chicken. 5/5\nThis dish was probably the best Sweet and Sour Chicken I have tried from a Chinese joint. Super juicy and lightly fried chicken in a sauce that balances the sweet and sour just right. The vegetables and pineapple were yummy as well. \n\nOverall the food was A-OK. The flavors were just too delicate for my taste, but the owner/ hostess was super adorable, enthusiastic and very nice and food came out fast.:D I feel like they probably do have some really good dishes, so I'll be sure to stop by and try something else if I find myself in San Francisco again.", "author": "Stephanie G."}

Once I ordered the food, I realized the food quality is actually very, very authentic. The whole place feels like it's being run by cooks who learned the authentic craft, but started adding Americanized items to cater to more customers.\n\nThe juicy pork buns were ok, but were quite large and had a nice presentation. The eggplant in garlic sauce was sizzling when served, and cooked with the right amount of sauce to give it a real \"kick\" of spiciness. The sweet ribs were also cooked very well--you can taste the \"smoky\", \"wok\" flavor in the meat underneath the sweet sauce on the outside.\n\nWe went on Friday night, and a group of 5 tables were there for a group celebration of their friend who just published a book. Different members of the group raised their glasses and gave toasts to the author, and at the end everyone yelled \"mazel tov!\" together. Some even toasted the chefs.

Before even looking at the menu I noticed my plate was dirty. A new one was brought to me, and it too was dirty. \n\nI ordered the King Pao Chicken, and they added an extra ingredient that I had no idea what it was. It wasn't something that was listed on the menu. I couldn't tell what was chicken and what was the mystery ingredient. I had to pick around it and the taste was super weird. The amount of chicken in the dish was lacking, and it was super soft chicken. It kinda freaked me out how soft it was when I ate it. - almost like it was undercooked. Must have been fine because I haven't gotten sick yet. \n\nMy friend ordered Orange Chicken and loved it. Also ordered egg rolls - but they were extremely greasy. Almost dripping grease and overlooked/soggy. \n\nDefinitely would not come back or recommend this place. Gave 2 star because my friends dish was ok.", "author": "Andrea T."}

My little brother is within walking distance of Chinatown so after a very long drive from Southern California, we decided to have some food here. The restaurant wasn't too crowded which made for some quick and efficient service. They refilled our teapot without any questions and made sure our plates were cleared right away. I do believe that they are on the pricier side, but I am under the general idea that everything in the city is a bit overpriced. \n\nBetween the five of us, we ordered a variety of different dishes and steamed rice. We started with the hot and sour soup. I thought that this was way too salty and I actually poured some of my water into it. It did have a nice tang to it though. Honey walnut shrimp was super tasty. I liked how the shrimp they used were large and the walnuts made for a nice texture. We also ordered their Orange Peel Chicken which was just okay. I think I actually prefer the orange chicken from Panda Express. Mongolian Beef was another dish that could have been great but was ruined by too much salt. For our vegetables, we ordered the Hunan String Beans which was so addicting but once again, so overwhelmingly salty. I mean it felt like the restaurant was trying to kill us with a sodium overdose or something. \n\nOverall, the food was fine but I think I was expecting more for the price. Or maybe I'm just spoiled by Chinese food from San Gabriel Valley. One thing for sure, I think that the chef of this restaurant needs to lighten up on the salt because it is preventing some of his dishes from shining. Not the best but it works for a quick and hot meal but I will probably keep walking to another restaurant next time. 3/5", "author": "Michelle L."}

Coming from the east coast, and having pretty good xiao long baos, I had some high expectations coming in here to see how good their xiao long baos were.\n\nI came in hungry, with a huge cravings for xiao long bao. I left still craving them...\nMy experience here wasn't too great. The xiao long bao did come a bit presentable, but the dumpling itself... was... dry.....Expected some sort of delicious broth in there, but no. There was very little, and it came out luke warm. Was highly disappointed that there was very little broth in each dumpling, to the point where you can't even call them soup dumplings.\n\nAlso had an order of orange peel chicken. But had no chicken... it was mostly fried breading, and i really tried hard to find some chicken in these, but i honestly could not. The sauce is decent and has the right amount on them. But please dont call it orange chicken if there is no chicken in there....\n\nNot too good of an experience, and would not recommend going here for xiao long bao.", "author": "Jun W."}

So I understand since we we're not regulars here that the service might be kinda off, which it was, but the food was just alright. \n\nI've been to other Hunan restaurants in LA and one in Rowland Heights. Don't know if its a chain or maybe just different or even if its a socal or norcal thing. It was definitely not the race issue because I got slants too. But definitely if I were to base it off solely on customer service socal Hunan would win, and for food portion and taste socal would win again. \n\nI usually order the Salt & Pepper Calamari, Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, House Special Shrimp, Fried Fish w/ the brown sauce and HK pan-fried noodles with beef and etc... I would say you can clearly see a difference in the portion size and the taste factor is a couple notches under from what I'm used to.

I started coming to Hunan Home's a few years ago when I was in town for work and I have just kept coming back. Chinatown can be overwhelming, and in situations like this I like to find something that works and stick with it. They've always had tables available, but they're also always fairly busy with a wide diversity of customers. You hear a lot of English being spoken at tables, but a lot of Mandarin as well. \n\nThe menu seems to lean a little bit (not entirely) toward \"Americanized\" Chinese (which is fine with me, because I reject the notion that \"authentic is always better.\" Americanized Chinese food is dang tasty. Who cares if it's not what you get when you go to Beijing?). At the same time, their specials do include a number of more authentic offerings like you would find elsewhere in Chinatown. \n\nMy favorite set of dishes at Hunan Home's are the sizzling platters. I've had three of them (chicken, beef, and shrimp) and all were excellent. Highly recommended overall.", "author": "Benjamin G."}

Earlier this week me and my family went to Hunan Homes because of all the hype it has been getting on Yelp. 4 stars and over 1000 reviews? Sounds promising. When we first attempted to come to Hunan Home's (without a reservation) it clearly didn't work. The wait was 40 minutes to 1 hour. A few days later we called and made a reservation. I was so excited to finally try this place!\n\nWalking in, the atmosphere is friendly and kind. The restaurant is pretty loud due to all the customers it gets. The decor is kind of old school but I like it. So far so good... Until we get the food. Everything on the menu seems so good and we ordered our food. We ordered: Sizzling rice soup, Orange chicken, Bread (steamed), sizzling seafood, and the chicken and snow peas. \n\nSIZZLING RICE SOUP: Absoutley disgusting. It tasted like old leftovers dumped into a metallic broth mixed with loads of oil\n\nORANGE CHICKEN: This was ok, but not the best I've had. I didn't like how fried it was. I feel like without the batter it would be horrible\n\nCHINESE BREAD (STEAMED): This was ok too, the bread smelt very strongly of yeast. It was soft and fluffy and came with condensed milk to dip it in (??lol??)\n\nSIZZLING SEAFOOD: Probably the best thing we got. It was mediocre and nothing special at all. Chinese takeout level! \n\nCHICKEN & SNOW PEAS: Looked like actual vomit, would not even order this one. \n\nALL IN ALL, Hunan Home's is seriously nothing special at all. Please do not read these 5 star reviews and think this is the holy grail of Chinese food in SF, because it's far from that. I would not come back.

After eating here, I honestly have no idea how this place has 4 stars...\n\nTo start, we were probably 1 of max 3 tables that were actually Chinese or Asian here...and not to sound racist or whatever you wanna call it, but that's not a great sign for a Chinese restaurant haha\n\nFood-wise, very plain and not that satisfying. For some reason none of our food was that hot, and was more lukewarm, which wasn't very appealing. We got:\n\n1) Pea shoots, which were actually ok and had some good garlic in there\n2) The standard sizzling chicken, which didn't sizzle at all (literally), and the chicken meat texture didn't feel and taste right\n3) Fish sauce shredded pork or sometihng of the sort, again, lukewarm dish, not much substance to the meat, and just not very satisfying\n4) A mediocre bowl of brown rice\n\nAltogether ~$20 a person, so not a huge deal, but overall, pretty disappointed and probably not coming back. Also, I'm not asking for much on the interior of the place, but the booth seating was worn out and uncomfortable, and the inside of the restaurant wasn't very well lit either.

I came here with some friends on a Saturday evening, and we were seated immediately. There was nothing too special about the experience, and I'm not a huge fan of Hunan food so I'll try my best not to be biased. The tea was bland, so I would have asked for a different variety next time (if there is a next time) but anyways this is what we ordered:\n\n* Hot and Sour Soup ($8.50 for medium size) - Served with pork, bean curd, mushroom, bamboo shoots, and eggflower, this hot and sour soup did not satisfy my craving for it. There was something off about the flavor. It tasted very beefy (or porky) and not spicy at all.\n\n* Beef Chow Mein ($7.95) - The beef was a little undercooked in this chow mein, and the noodles were soggier than ideal. It was okay, not too bad.\n\n* Hunan String Beans ($8.95) - These string beans are dry stir-fried with garlic and minced pork. Not a fan of the flavor. They are more on the softer than cruncy side as far as string beans go, as a note in case you have a preference.\n\n* Hunan Spicy Garlic Chicken ($10.75) - Saving the best for last in my review, I actually really enjoyed this dish. The chicken is sauteed with snow peas, baby corn, celery, and mushrooms. You can really taste the spice and Hunan flavors. Goes well with steamed rice. \n\nThese dishes came out to a total of around $44 for four people, and we still had a bit of leftovers. I would probably not opt to come back here again but it was not too expensive, so if you're looking for a basic Hunan restaurant to satisfy some cravings, this may be for you.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

Hunan Home's is one that you'll surprisingly see tables full of both Chinese families as well as white people. They are able to cater to both taste buds and have delicious spicy and non-spicy dishes that are not oily or too salty. My husband says they are the ONLY Chinese restaurant that brings you water the first time you ask and will freely re-fill your glasses throughout dinner. For those of you who eat at \"real\" Chinese restaurants, you know this is not the case nor would we normally order water because we grew up only drinking tea or hot water. Their Xiao Long Baos are not that good which isn't surprising as they aren't a Taiwanese or Mandarin restaurant but they are still tasty. Their dishes are on the smaller side but are hot and fresh. Try their Pot Stickers (juicy and homemade tasting), Hunan Home's Smoked Pork, Peking Duck (served with pancakes vs buns), Mu Shu Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Sizzling Seafood Deluxe, and Shrimp with Gai Lan.

Price wise, it's a bit above average for Chinese food, and I food it a bit unusual that they made one pay for white steamed rice- normally complimentary in Chinese restaurants.  With regards to accessibility, the restaurant is easily accessed from the street, but the bathroom is down a flight of stairs. Odd then that they have a wheelchair accessible bathroom.", "author": "Alexei S."}

As I searched through all the soup dumplings (the highest rated one being closed) I opted for Hunan's, and I am so happy I did! I walked in, ordered TWO orders of xiaolongbao (because that's how much I was craving it), again best decision I ever made. They came out with this sauce made of (my best guess) jalapenos, green onions, rice vinegar, soy sauce, cilantro and garlic. Although I usually eat my xiaolongbao with vinegar, this was even better! The spice and flavors paired well with the xiaolongbao's flavorful broth. The texture of the dumpling was perfectly prepared and the mixture inside was delicious!

It was very flavorful, and I couldn't stop filling my bowl with more!\n\nHowever, service was really lacking.  The people were more interested in watching sports and playing candy crush instead of serving their customers.\n\nThe interior is REALLY cheesy, but they own HUGE real estate.  I was shocked at how large this place was.  You can really hold a wedding or banquet here easily!\n\nThey validate for the Golden Gateway Garage but didn't really seem very happy about give it out. \n\nHot and Sour Soup:\nNot REAL Chinese food, but I still crave for it.  This gave me my fix. A small is more than enough for 3-5 people.  Drinking too much of this will make you throw up, literally!\n\nCashew Shrimp:\nThis is the ONLY dish where I thought it was bang for my money.  Shrimp were fresh and fat and the plate had a bunch of them.  Cashews were roasted and infused with Chinese spices.  LOVED IT!\nThis place is the only place I know that does this dish right.\nMy nephews hate celery, and they ate all of theirs cause the flavors were so well infused.  It hid the sour/bitter taste of it. \n\nOrange Peel Chicken:\nI think Panda Express' is better but they put REAL orange peel in this which is a treat and not cheap when you buy it outside. \n\nBroccoli with Beef:\nBe careful.  There are TWO broccoli with beef dishes.  The \"Chinese\" broccoli they list is \"jie lan\" which is the long green vegetable.   The one we usually eat is considered \"Western broccoli\".  \nThis dish was good, but seriously, paying over 10 bucks for this is SUCH a rip off.\nThis is something you can easily make it off.\n\nRice is $1/person, and they only give you a little bit...\nThey should have offered a free refill considering how many dishes we ordered and how we paid double the prices as compared to any other place.\n\nThe bill for 3 dishes and a soup came out to be about 60 bucks. OUCH! But it's Chinatown SF, I guess...\n\nWould I come back?  Probably not.  Maybe just to order a shrimp dish to go.", "author": "David W."}

We ended up at Hunan Homes based on an earlier Yelp search. Based on its ratings (and its proximity to Golden Gate Bakery which, sadly, we didn't make it to), we decided to eat here.\n\nI was a little worried that this would be a more \"touristy\" kind of Chinese restaurant (a la P.F. Chang's -- especially since, racist as this sounds, there weren't very many Chinese people in the restaurant), but I was pleasantly surprised by the food nonetheless. True, the food was a bit more on the \"gimmicky\" side, but there were a number of more authentic dishes sprinkled throughout the menu.\n\nSeating was immediately available, as was a pot of tea, though over the course of our meal, the restaurant quickly filled up and got very busy. We chose to get the pot stickers, the hot and sour soup, tea smoked duck, black mushroom with tender greens and some white rice for both of us to share.\n\nDon't tell my mom, but I liked Hunan's potstickers more than her homemade ones. There were 6 of them and I was starting to worry that I would get full simply on the potstickers after having 2 of them. I was also pretty impressed by their hot and sour soup. I didn't develop a taste for this dish until I started getting older, but now that I have, I can't get enough. It was very flavorful but not overwhelmingly hot -- but after two bowls, I was starting to sweat just the tiniest bit and my taste buds were tingling a bit. There was enough that both Boyfriend and I managed to have 3 small bowls of soup each.\n\nThe tea smoked duck was REALLY good -- better than any duck I've had anywhere else, actually. It was prepared differently than what I'm normally used to (it being fried instead of, say, steamed or roasted), and the meat was a reddish color (like the skin of char siu) which was also different. But the duck was very succulent and the flavors were full. Some of the pieces were pretty bony, but you can't expect EVERY piece to be chock full of meat. The black mushroom with tender green ('tender green\" meaning bak choy...) was meh. Out of all the dishes we had, that one was the least tasty and I wouldn't order it again.\n\nWe ended up with a lot of food to take home as leftovers (rice included), so I'm pretty pleased. After tip, I paid $40 -- and considering that I'm technically getting TWO meals out of it, I'm not complaining at all.", "author": "Anna W."}

Heck yeah!! \n\nI tried Hunan Homes with my parents and boyfriend for dinner on Christmas day and I was BLOWN AWAY by how awesome it was. Granted there was a long line of hungry customers when we arrived at 4 PM but it was totally worth the wait (30-40 minutes... not that bad!) We were seated in a nice comfy booth and started to check out the menu which was daunting since there were so many options.\n\nHere's what we decided on:\n\nWor Wonton Soup: 4/5 - I love starting off with soup and this one had so many ingredients. Shrimp, mushrooms, meat, bamboo, veggies, it was all there! Add a splash of the spicy chili oil and bam it's delicious.\n\nBBQ Spareribs: 3/5 - these are my dad's favorite but I'm not too fond of them. However, they do have a lot of meat on the bones and were pretty tasty.\n\nEggplant in spicy garlic sauce: 5/5+ - this dish was like crack. Seriously people I had to restrain myself from licking the plate of delicious sauce because it was THAT GOOD. The eggplant was tender and the sauce was an excellent combination of spicy, savor, sweet goodness that I couldn't stop eating this dish even though I was full. This one will blow your mind.\n\nMapo Tofu: 4/5 - a good rendition of mapo tofu but not the best I've had. Still the sauce was yummy and the tofu was cooked well so I'd order it again!\n\nAsparagus Beef: 4/5 - I've never had this dish before but it was yummy! The asparagus was perfectly cooked and the beef was nice and tender, making it a deliciously balanced addition to our feast.\n\nSizzling Oyster: 3/5 - I wasn't super excited for this dish but my dad and boyfriend were! Anyway the whole show of adding the food to the sizzling plate was pretty cool and the oysters were GIANT so we definitely got a good deal on this one.\n\nCombo Chow Mein: 4/5 - the noodles were awesome, not too chewy but perfect! Hunan Homes definitely knows how to make a great noodle dish.\n\nKung Pao Chicken: 5/5 - another must order =) Definitely a bit spicy but it's a good kick, not a lip numbing painful ordeal. The chicken was great and the peanuts add a nice crunch.\n\nIn the end I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK! Our waiter was also really nice and made sure we had everything we needed even though the restaurant was super busy. Can't wait to return!", "author": "Sam F."}

Even the tofu didn't taste that good as well as the shrimps. I feel bad since I'm not really choosy when it comes to Chinese food, but I can't help it.

I tore apart that dish like it as nothing. Just wish I didn't have to sort through the bones, but thats the lazy side of me.

It had awesome crunch covered in a sweet and tangy orange sauce with little pieces of orange skin. Chow mien noodles were very fresh, flavor was on point. Good sized pork and veggie pieces.  Egg rolls were crispy, veggies inside still had their crunch and the sweet and sour tasted home made. We helped these dishes along with some cold as hell Asahi beer which is always a favorite.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-17", "description": "I'm giving them 5 stars for two reasons:\n1. They sat us quickly during the Chinese New Year weekend on a Sunday.\n2. The food was excellent! Nothing to complain from what we ordered.\n\nSo it was Sunday of Chinese New Year weekend. After walking around for a few, we wanted to have lunch at Great Eastern Restaurant because we've eaten here before and the food was really good. We walk up and there's a crowd outside as well as inside. I over hear people outside saying it's 20-30 minutes, but WE go inside & they tell us 1hr - 1 1/2 hr wait. Makes me wonder who they were giving the true time to.\n\nSo we looked around for something else... Yelp comes up with Hunan Homes and it's 4 stars! Plus recent reviews have been very good. Once inside, it looks small, just a small room in front & then you see the kitchen. Several booths line the walls with some tables in the middle for bigger groups.\n\nInside there was only one other group of 4 in front of us. Then comes another group of 4 and a group of 2. Looking inside the restaurant it was all full except for a big table that could seat about 8 - 10 people. We all stood there for about 5-10 min. Then the woman asks us all to follow her. She walks us passed the front room, passed the kitchen & down some stairs. We joked whispering, \"Are we eating in the storage room?\" (HAHAHA) All of a sudden walking passed the kitchen we come to another dining room!!! Well played Hunan with your hidden extra space!\n\nAll of us there felt like it was kind of our own private room. Even though we didn't know each other, we got the vibe from one another that we were in a little more \"intimate\" space. The room was just as big as the front room with just as many tables.\n\nOur waiter, an older man, comes rushing in to give us all menus. He was the only one working with all of us in this back room. I give him credit because he didn't skip a beat! First going table to table giving waters, then tea & cups. Then after a few minutes (enough for us to look at the menu) he comes back out & systematically goes from table to table asking if we're ready to order. A couple of the tables weren't ready but he politely moved to the next table.\n\nTo start we ordered: Xia Long Bao & Potstickers\nMain entrees: Cashew Chicken & Crispy Chicken w/ Hot Chili Sauce\n\nXia Long Bao (Photo): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hunan-homes-restaurant-san-francisco?select=qxP_d4DcSiVBMkii4S77hw#qxP_d4DcSiVBMkii4S77hw\n\nXia Long Bao - I didn't know at first that these were \"broth\" filled dumplings, until the server came out with two large spoons. I know from experience that with \"broth\" filled dumplings you need to eat them in the spoon so that you don't loose any of that delicious broth. Served with a soy, ginger, green onion sauce. I try one with it first. The dumpling was tender and the broth was great. I was surprised at how much broth came out because looking at them you couldn't tell. With the soy it was even better. And of course for me, with a little chili oil it was excellent!\n\nPotstickers (Photo): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hunan-homes-restaurant-san-francisco?select=qxP_d4DcSiVBMkii4S77hw#KyrsXrqLOZcXC-0K925gMg\n\nPotstickers - I've always been told that a good potsticker has that crispy pan fried side with the tender skin on the other & a nice juicy filling. Well these did not disappoint. Take that first bite & it's nice & crisp! The filling was tender, juicy & flavorful.\n\nCashew Chicken (Photo): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hunan-homes-restaurant-san-francisco?select=qxP_d4DcSiVBMkii4S77hw#nBA_Iai_L11ju5ketXLrPQ\n\nCashew Chicken - I thought this had great flavor to it. It wasn't too salty. In other words no \"MSG\" kind of taste to it. The flavors were light, complimenting each other. But once you add just a bit of soy sauce it tasted like it brought out a lot more flavor to the whole dish. I didn't get that \"salty\" after taste like from some bad Chinese fast food chain.\n\nCrispy Chicken w/ Chili Sauce (Photo): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hunan-homes-restaurant-san-francisco?select=qxP_d4DcSiVBMkii4S77hw#RgmGqNPZwto9OxRHvjZdSw\n\nCrispy Chicken - Loved this dish! The chicken was so tender! So you're talking about a \"fried\" chicken that's been topped with a chili sauce. Now I know that crispy skin is eventually going to get soggy, which it was, BUT the saving grace was that I actually bit into quite a few pieces of skin that were nice & crispy! Overall, the flavor was great, the chicken was juicy and I added more chili oil just for the extra spice for me.\n\nIt's great to know that there's a back a plan in case Great Eastern is full again. But I have a feeling we'll be coming back here to Hunan House first before Great Eastern again. And it's right across the street too.\n\nEat it... Love it?... Yelp it!!!", "author": "Joel R."}

The man working the front was super friendly and hilarious.  Maybe he'd adopt me and cook me lots of Hunan food?\n\nThey brought us hot tea but we had to ask (twice) for water.  But the food is the meat of the review (pun intended)...\n\nFor appetizers, we got vegetarian potstickers and succulent bread.  The potstickers were only okay, and were extremely ginger-y.  I really hate ginger, so that was not my thang.  Other people at the table with less of a vendetta against ginger found them only okay as well.  But the succulent bread was FANTASTIC.  You wouldn't expect it, but it was totally can't-miss.  We took home the very little extra that was left, and had it for breakfast the next day with jam.  Like sufganiyot! Amazing.  It's like a really light and barely-sweet donut, but words don't do it justice.\n\nFor entrees, we got the prawns with honey walnuts, eggplant in garlic sauce (but specially prepared without the pork-- props for being accommodating to vegetarians!), squid with spicy salt, and sizzling oysters.  I didn't try the oysters, but my mom hated them.  We really liked everything else!  The squid was salty, true to name, but also had a lot of other complex flavors.  Really light and almost flaky.  The eggplant was good too, very savory and soft... Great even without the pork!\n\nBut the prawns were the real hit... Everyone at the table LOVED those.  The sauce they're in is absolutely wonderful, and all the flavors work together perfectly.  Thanks for the recommendation, yelp!", "author": "Allison M."}

He promptly brought us water and tea, and asked if we were ready to order--I got the sweet and sour chicken (\"oh, how original, Helena\"--you say) and Alex got the beef with broccoli. \n\nIt came very promptly and for the sake of brevity, here, I'll just say it was delicious. I would have liked if the serving was a tiny bit larger, to be honest. The tea was fantastic, and the server was on fleek (not just the eyebrows, all of him).\n\nI would absolutely recommend this place. Small note: maybe it's a family joint, because there were lots of kids around when we popped by. That said, whatever. They're entertaining. One of the children was particularly monstrous and I had the time of my life watching her try to use a fork to eat a piece of chicken. Eventually she gave up on the fork, but used it to wedge the piece of chicken between her tiny teeth, and then used her right hand to shove the whole chunk into her mouth. After chewing perfunctorily for about a minute or so, she seemed to get tired of the whole \"chicken\" taste, so she just regurgitated it all out of her mouth and proceeded to let it drip down her chin--until her poor mother noticed, and wiped it off. \n\nBut I mean, kids, amirite?\n\nLoved this place.

This was an amazing experience. We got in at the right time, when they were not super busy, but I can see why the January 3rd reviewer complained. The place filled up fast after we got there. A friend was in from Chicago and I wanted to show him Chinatown. I asked Siri for a Chinese restaurant near me and this came up on a list and it had great reviews and two \"$\" out of four -- so not too expensive. We had to walk almost a mile but it was more than worth it. The staff is very friendly, the food has a delicate but full flavor, and the food came quickly (something like 8-12 minutes after our order). They even charged my iPhone (which had just died) so that I could take a picture. \n\nThe place is small but clean, and I got a chance to go downstairs a few times and peek around the back a bit (they don't know this yet). It is very clean downstairs and well organized, but packed with fresh vegetables. I *highly recommend* anything on a sizzling skillet. The presentation is far beyond anything I have ever seen. They bring a super-heated iron skillet and place it down and immediately place \"mostly cooked\" food on it (99% cooked) and when the food his the skillet it sizzles and steams (for about 20 seconds) enough to fog your glasses. Everything was good, but I preferred the beef and chicken - both \"softly flavored,\" not overly seasoned, but saturated with flavor, and extremely tender. Best of all it is off of the trolley (cable car) lines, so it is easy to get to. This will be my go to spot whenever I am in SF. I don't think they take reservations.

First, the place is so small that we had to wait on the street while the food was prepared. And maybe it wouldn't have been too bad if it wasn't trash day. Also, they were quite slow at seating people. We were told it would be about 15 min for our food to be ready...no big deal. However, when we went to check if it was ready we had to wait 10 min to get into the restaurant because two parties were waiting to be seated (a total of 5 people).

I wouldn't say the service is \"nice\", but they are very efficient... accommodating your requests in good time despite the place being busy.\n\nIn comparison to other Chinese restaurants, their fare is a little more expensive (usually $2-3 more per entree than you'd find at some other places) but I don't mind this since the food is quality here. \n\nWe were a party of 6 folks and were able to get a good sampling of some of their dishes: Mongolian Beef, Sweet & Sour Fish, Vegetable Fried Rice, Hot & Sour Soup, Orange Peel Beef, and Salt & Pepper Pork Spare Ribs. All were really tasty. The food was prepared well, the veggies tasted fresh, and wasn't overly oily or greasy.\n\nWe even needed some vegetarian accommodations, which they were more than happy to prepare for us. \n\nIt's a pretty extensive menu (natch for a lot of Chinese places in general) so I'm sure if I return I'll probably get to have a meal without ordering anything I've already tried.\n\nIf I'm ever in Chinatown area again, I'll definitely come here for another visit.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

Prior to this, I've tried many Chinese restaurants in Chinatown and in the inner Richmond area (aka. Second Chinatown in San Francisco), but have not been impressed by too many. I've seen people lined up to get into this restaurant but I never had the desire to wait in line when there are so many other options on the same street.  Last weekend, it was pouring outside and we were in Chinatown looking for a place to eat at 5pm.  I was in the mood to have some Taiwanese food, so I searched on Yelp for options. This place popped up with the highest rating, and the photos looked enticing, so we decided to give it a shot. Luckily, at 5pm, there was no line, but still busy- we managed to get the last available table when we arrived. They did not have Taiwan beer (sad...) even though it was on the drink menu, but that was really the only disappointment. The waiter was efficient but not super friendly, probably because they are always busy and wanted to customers in and out quickly. We ordered the hot and sour soup (highly recommend by other Yelpers), and my husband said it was the best H&S soup he has ever had! We also ordered the soup dumplings (aka. Xiao Long Bao), also one of the best I have ever tried outside of Asia. I ordered Tai Chin chicken for my main course, which was delicious with a spicy kick. Overall, it was a five-star dining experience for us!

This place had good reviews on yelp. We have lots of good Chinese food in Los Angeles. In particular we like the dumplings at Din Tai Fung.  We were looking for good dumplings for dinner.  This place did not disappoint.  We had the pork dumplings which were great. We also had their beef chow mein, orange peel chicken, Kung pau shrimp, potstickers and the hot and sour soup.  Everything was fantastic.  Parking is crazy here so you're better off coming by Uber.  The male hostess was also very funny and welcoming.

There was nothing special about these dumplings. The skin was quite thick, and there wasn't that much soup inside. They were also served a bit lukewarm. The only fancy part was that the waiter gave us clean plates specifically for the dumplings and served us the first ones (maybe so inexperienced customers don't break the skin upon picking them up). They take their Shanghai dumplings seriously! \n:: Pan fried noodles - they use a white noodle that's not as flavorful as the yellow egg noodle. Young's Cafe on Kearny and Sacramento as more legit pan fried noodle. Hunan Homes also uses a whiter gravy sauce that's more slimy and not as flavorful. When the dish cools down, it's like eating slime on your food\n:: Chicken and green beans over rice - This was not your traditional dry fried green beans, but instead a spicy garlic sauce sauteed with chicken and green beans.

We chose a combination of pot-stickers and the XLB to accompany an entree of the honey, walnut shrimp to share.  From the very first bite until we finished our meal we couldn't stop talking about how wonderful the food was.  The restaurant is not too small but not at all large.  Since we were there around 4PM you're not sure if the service will be up to their normal meal time standards but it was perfect!\n\nThe next time we're in Chinatown, we'll definitely put this wonderful restaurant on our must visit list.", "author": "John M."}

We started out with an order of the veggie potstickers. They were deliciously fresh and the dipping sauce that accompanied them made the postickers a lot more flavorful. We shared our main dishes which consisted of the veggie chow mein and the family style bean curd. The chow mein was a little bland, and it could have been made better with a little extra hot sauce. The family style bean curd was a good mix of tofu and vegetables with a subtle garlic taste. It was a nice Chinese comfort meal.\n\nThey're usually pretty busy on the weekends and the staff is running around like crazy trying to get everyone seated and served so they don't have the best service that I've seen.

Unfortunately, this time things were different.  Our kids had orange peel chicken and beef chow mein, which they both enjoyed.  My wife and I had the hot and sour soup, which she liked but I found a little bitter (not sour).  We also had mu shu pork and kung pao beef.  The mu shu was okay, but we've had better at home, and it was mostly vegetables.  The kung pao had bell peppers and bamboo chunks (not julienned shoots), which I didn't particularly enjoy.  Personally, I don't think bell peppers belong in this dish, and the large pieces of bamboo tasted overwhelming and unpleasant.  The coup de grace was later that night when my wife got sick.  I'm not sure whether it was the soup or the mu shu, but something was obviously not right with the food.  \n\nThe service was good with one exception - they brought out the mu shu long before the other dishes, and it wasn't very hot to begin with, so my wife had to start eating before the rest of us.  This just shouldn't happen.\n\nNext time, we will try someplace else.", "author": "Kevin O."}

If you're into standing around and watching others eat their food in slow motion, about to pass out from low blood sugar from not having eaten all day and then being completely shunned at the door because they know you aren't tourists, then by all means, come right in and wait around. \n\nYou enjoy being finally seated and then waiting another 10 minutes for a waiter to give a flying-f about you. We were literally sitting right where the waiters bar was and we could see/hear them passing us around like no one wanted to serve us. So, again, if you like being outcasted and denied quality service by second rate servers, by all means, come here to eat, or not eat, because that's what we did. \n\nYou enjoy asking for waters from a skew of different waiters and instead of getting too many waters, receiving ZERO. We were there only half an hour and on multiple occasions, one of the lazy waiters could have passed us a dirty glass of water at any time, since you know, the sink and cups and waiters doing nothing were situated literally an arm's length away from us. \n\nAND LASTLY, unless you enjoy being swindled from by the restaurant you're already paying good money to to get the worse possible service, please please come here. We asked for the check, when it came, I knew better than to trust them. I checked my orders and recalculated everything, which seemed to match up. So, I paid for my $35 meal with a $100 bill. I received less than $50. I then politely asked for the waiter to come double check and even asked if tip was already included. He said no. So I asked why they already decided I'd want to even tip them over $10 for the piece of crap service I got. He called over the supervisor who seemed to be pissed at me that his people messed up my bill and tried to steal my money. They're lucky I even bothered tipping after all those heinous ordeals. \n\nOn a last note, about the food, it wasn't anything spectacular or noteworthy. I ordered three dishes, a meat dish, a seafood dish, and a vegetable dish. Pretty basic stuff, but it wasn't memorable.

Part of the problem was that is was so hyped by a friend of mine that when I finally made it to the location I was simply overwhelmed by its mediocrity and general suckiness.  \n\nThere is simply nothing special or remarkable about it, only that the service is detached and seemingly uninterested in being friendly or helpful (but that is excusable if the food is amaze balls!)  Instead, it was just boring poorly cooked overly sweet and tangy Americanized Chinese food all served on beds of vinegary cabbage. \n\nPart of the reason it is so over hyped is partially because no nothing tourists from far away lands, have no idea what good or even authentic Chinese food should taste like.  Considering that the concentration and sheer number of choices for absolutely fantastic and hardy Chinese food in Chinatown and the Bay Area surpasses pretty much anywhere in the United States, this is a poor representative of what SF has to offer for Chinese cuisine.\n\nIf you want better Chinese food, just close your eyes and randomly place your finger somewhere on a map of Chinatown and go to the nearest restaurant.  Guaranteed probably to be better use of your money.", "author": "Joshua H."}

So we showed up at around 7 pm and put our name down and was told it will be a 20-30 minute wait.\nThere were 4 of us, and after we put our name down, 3 of us decided to walk around the corner to \"Golden Gate Bakery\" to swoop up some egg tarts. The line was pretty long and we in line for maybe 5 mins or so. Anyways...we get a call from the other person at Hunan and he said they just called our name. \n\nAwesome! They said 20-30 minutes and we get called maybe 5-10 minutes later!!\n\nThe service was pretty good, they have this guy working who has a sense of humor but you can't tell by his facial expressions. 2 of us asked for forks because we don't know how to use chopsticks(....I'm sorry! Give me a break....) And the guy tells us he has to go down the street to get forks because they don't have any there and that it will be a $5 add on to the bill. Which I thought was pretty funny. \n\nWhen the food was ready they brought one, and once that was done...the next one came out and so on and so on. The thing I liked the most was, we ordered the mu shu chicken and when that was ready the waitress brought that out and set up our plates and put the little pancakes on each plate and put the chicken in each pancake...then what got me was she rolled it up for us!! I was like, \"awesome service!\" Usually I just put the chicken on the pancake and eat it like a soft taco of sorts.\n\nPot stickers are good, mu shu chicken was good, the spare ribs were amazing, and then we ordered duck! The duck was bomb.com! It's on the greasy side but it's really good! The skin is crispy and is the best part. There is also a lot of fat on it that I didn't really care for much but the meat and the skin are off the chain!\n\nThe food was really good, and the service was pretty good as well!\n\nI highly recommend coming here!", "author": "Jason D."}

I was getting anxious because people ordered things I usually don't like (xiao long bao and hot and sour soup), and then the mind-blowing happened.  The xia long bao were perfect: thin, delicate skin, but hefty enough not to break when picked up.  The vinegar that came with it was just right -- no weird medicinal aftertaste like I'd had before.  And I have no idea what they did to the hot and sour soup or how I miraculously inhaled my portion of it, but damn it was good.  It wasn't thick and goopy with cornstarch and didn't skew sour like so many do.  \n\nThe Hunan scallops were crazy good, too.  Cooked really nicely -- not chewy or stringy at all -- and just spicy enough.  From this, I deduce anything that has the word \"Hunan\" in the title is going to be delicious.  \n\nService was speedy -- no gratuitous niceties, they just handled it!  Everything was just right.

The choices can be overwhelming but turned to Yelp and found this place. I was definitely not disappointed with the choice.\n\nTo me, it's a typical Chinese restaurant in back. We went there for an early dinner, greeted quickly but the front area was packed and thought we would have to wait. However, we were quickly taken to the large back dining area downstairs and seated immediately.\n\nWife and I ordered the lemon chicken and the beef with orange peel and both were amazing. The lemon chicken was all white meat pieces cooked to perfection. It was not your usual heavy breaded, hard as a rock chicken you normally see. Very tender and juicy with just the right amount of breading. The sauce was light, tangy and added just the right amount of flavor. It wasn't your typical yellow lemon ketchup product you would see at other places. Thick enough to stick to the chicken but not enough to overpower the flavors.\n\nThe beef with orange peel was lightly fried and tender. The orange flavor was subtle but enough to compliment the beef. I still can't believe how amazingly tender and flavorful the beef was. It literally would melt in your mouth.\n\nPrices were on par with other Chinese restaurants. I will absolutely visit this place again on my next visit and would recommend to anyone.

I've tried it a couple times to give it the benefit of the doubt, but it's a no-go in my book.\n\nI feel as though it's a factory for non-Chinese ppl - come in, order from a picture menu, eat, open a fortune cookie, leave.\n\nWe had a few apps (soup/rolls/dumplings) and kung pao chicken for the entr\u00e9e. The rolls were manageable, but everything else was tasteless. Kung pao had no flavor, and the chicken was rubbery.

It has a safe-for-the-non-Chinese diner atmosphere and the waiters are friendly and willing to take the time to explain the ingredients in the dishes if you inquire.\n\nSince I'm Chinese, they don't pay attention to me. \n\nThe food is mostly classic American Chinese food (sweet & sour ____, mu shu____, pot stickers, chow mein, etc....). It's not the best or the worst; it just is. Either way, you won't get much value here since it mainly caters to out of town dollars of tourists. Ordering a la carte will prove fatal to your wallet ($13 pea shoots). If you want to splurge, there are better options in the area (R&G or Great Eastern). After trying the dinner once, now I stick to the lunch menu. It's a perfectly fine place for a rice plate (about $10 out the door). Service is fast if you're just ordering that and nothing else.\n\nBathrooms in the basement are decently maintained. They are unisex so you have a choice of the left one or the right one. \n\nOverall, a great place for tourists. I've seen many of them enjoy their experience there. But if you're a native San Franciscan and this is your go-to place for Chinese food, then we need to have a nice long talk.", "author": "Stevey K."}

And then I see it out of the corner of my eye; Hunan Homes. I had heard such wonderful recommendations about this outstanding, authentic yet understated little bee bop. One would assume a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown is a guaranteed go, but there is also the double edged sword to highly rated business - sometimes the pressure is too much and the biz can't keep up to the standards.

Absofruitely not!\n\nI was seated (alone, tear) and was immediately greeted with a complimentary piping pot of Green Tea I happily sipped while waiting for my Mongolian beef. The ratio of green onions, peppers, broccoli, and beef is so perfect. The flavor was one of those situations you can't describe. Kind of like goose bumps - you can't describe it but you know it when you feel it. I usually siss out after I ravenously inhale good Chinese food after three bites, but I just kept on going on.

It had some black beans in it, which added extra flavor (like the Chinese black bean paste type, not actual beans per se).\n- Mapo tofu: medium spice, good over rice, generous portion\n\nAll the dishes are well seasoned, but I didn't walk away with an msg coma or snugging. Prices are reasonable, and service is friendly. I also like that their food is less greasy than most places, and I like the different spin they put on common dishes (like the black beans in the prawn with lobster sauce).\n\nOf course dinner ends with fortune cookies and orange slices.\n\nIt's not as glamorous as R+G lounge, and they don't have fancy cocktails, but they do have beer and wine.

So, if you're planning on having great Chinese food in San Francisco wait until it's in the evening on a busy night if you're planning on going to Hunan Home's Restaurant.", "author": "Christoph F."}

We were fairly early (about 5:30) so there wasn't a wait. This was lucky since the place fills up fast and is very popular for dinner.\n\nI was really impressed with this place mainly because of the stellar service and the price (we got out of there for $44 + tip!).\n\nCome to find out, this is one of my brother-in-law's favorite places in Chinatown (he's a long-time SF resident) and he took us here when my father-in-law (his/my wife's dad) came to town. He wanted to impress is father with the stellar chinese cuisine in his city.\n\nUnfortunately, this time Hunan Homes fell short of the mark...\n\nWe had a reservation for 7:30 on July 4th. We showed up on-time and were promptly seated. It took a while for the waiter to come and greet us. We ordered drinks but he left without taking the kids' orders! When he came back with the adult's drinks we got him to take the kids' order. They didn't have what my kids wanted so we said they'd just drink water. We ordered soup, several appetizers, and several entrees. \n\nThe soup came out quickly (but not the waters, we asked about that). \n\nThe appetizers followed shortly after we finished our soup, but, again, not the waters. We asked again and were told that the busboy brings the water; \"Ok, so get the busboy to bring the water, please.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes we received the mu shu pork, but, again, not the waters! We asked again and he promised he'd get them out asap. The mu shu was excellent, BTW.\n\nNow we waited. We had ordered 5 entrees total but all we'd received so far was the mu shu. The one ray of sunshine was that my children finally got their waters!\n\nMy father-in-law got up to speak to the manager. The manager came over and told us that they have a \"process\" and what we have to understand is that they hold back the entrees when we ordered appetizers. Well, that didn't really hold water since it had been 30 minutes since we finished up our mu shu.\n\nThe entrees came out immediately.\n\nI think if the manager had simply apologized and got us our food we would have had a great time.\n\nBased on the food and our first experience here I'd give this place 5 stars but the poor service we experienced on our last visit knocks them down by two.", "author": "Donley P."}

The egg rolls were fresh and had an almost cinnamon-like taste to them that was quite addicting.  The hot and sour, however, was the star of the show.  I order hot and sour soup at every Chinese restaurant I go to as its one of my favorite dishes, but it often is not spicy enough or has enough flavor.  This hot and sour soup was the best I've ever had.\n\nThe orange peel chicken was fantastic, and the owner even stopped by our table to suggest we suck (not chew!) on the peppers to get an even greater depth of flavor.  I asked him if the peppers were preroasted, and he explained to me exactly how that dish was cooked.  Its always nice to hear that your dish is made to order, which explains the length of time between dishes, but also confirms why everything was so tasty.\n\nWe left full, totally satisfied and didn't break the bank.

The dumplings were pretty standard; I liked them but unfortunately some of them ripped before getting to our table so they were missing the yummy soup filling. The hot and sour soup was delicious!! The flavors were very complex and it had just the right amount of heat! I definitely recommend it!\n\nAll three main dishes were really tasty; definitely a great combination of flavors! The chicken had a nice crunch to it, was seasoned well, and had this yummy garlic sauce on it. The squid was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and also was well-seasoned. The mapo tofu was really good. I was a little surprised at how firm the tofu was compared to other places I've had it; however, the flavors were well-balanced and the sauce was scrumptious! \n\nOh, and as an unexpected surprise, they brought out fresh ice-cold orange slices with the bill. At first, my party was reluctant to try one since we were so full; however, soon it was a free-for-all as they were some of the sweetest and juiciest oranges any of us had ever had.

OK, I really hate the teal carpet, and there is a heavy Caucasian predominance among the diners. But trust me, this place is very good by Chinatown standards.\n\nAmong the many choices on the menu, I like - brace yourself - the $10.95 plate of Steamed Chicken pieces covered in ginger and scallions (see my photo). I know the sight of raw-looking chicken skin makes many stomachs turn, but I just like the freshness of the taste without the burden of an unrecognizable brown sauce. I do get the occasional random piece of bone, but I am usually able to maneuver it before it reaches my gullet. Am I getting too graphic? Anyway, you can probably guess this is not a commonly served dish, but I get it here because they do it very well.\n\nOtherwise, the rest of the menu is perfectly fine.

Let's start with explaining why I only gave it 1 star.\n\nI'm an ABC who considers myself very experienced in eating Chinese food, having eaten at hundreds of Chinese restaurants in my lifetime in the Bay Area and during my stays in 10 different cities in China and Taiwan. I travel to China or Taiwan about once a year.\n\nI came here during lunchtime on Friday with my family, because we were in Chinatown and I wanted something good. I pulled out my phone and found this place rated as 4 stars.\n\nMy ratings:\nCleanliness: 4/5, better than the average Chinese restaurant, I'll give you that.\nService: 3/5, the waiter seemed impatient because we were asking him all these questions about what was good to order, because the menu was practically completely in English, and I'm not familiar with the names of dishes if they're in English, because a dish that everyone knows as 4-5 Chinese characters becomes an incomprehensible English sentence describing the dish.\nFood: 0/5, don't even bother.\n\nBoy, was I disappointed. As soon as we stepped in, I looked around and saw that most of the restaurant patrons were Caucasian. First surprise. After we were seated, I pulled out my phone again, and actually READ the reviews for this restaurant instead of just trusting the star ratings blindly. Profile pictures of several more Caucasians. Second surprise. By that time, the waiter had already poured the tea for us, so we felt bad about leaving, hoping to wait out the initial bad impression and for the star ratings to be proven right.\n\nSaying this place is authentic Chinese food is like saying Panda Express or P.F. Changs is authentic Chinese food. What they created here at Hunan Homes Restaurant is a Chinese restaurant for Americans. Don't come here if you want real authentic Chinese food--I can recommend you a couple other places around Chinatown that don't appear as clean but are actually delicious--you know, the greasy Chinese restaurants where they do a haphazard job of wiping down the table with a dirty rag and you don't want to rest your elbows on the table.\n\nI don't remember if there was any Chinese in the menu--the words were completely in English. So we ordered 3 lunch specials and sauteed string beans, because nothing else looked appetizing.\n\nThe fish, shrimp, and seafood lunch specials all came out with exactly the same sauce, and overly salty at that. My dad took three bites of it and stopped eating--that's how bad it was! My wife (who grew up in China) had 70% left on her plate and I had about 10% left on my plate when we were done. I was raised to not waste any food, so we packed up the leftovers. The next day, I made fried rice in the wok at home by adding three cups of rice and three scrambled eggs to the leftovers--the resulting creation was much better than the original.", "author": "Jonathan T."}

We got dumplings which I could tell they were frozen and fried (too much... their bottoms were all black!) meaning they were certainly factory products not restaurant-made, honey walnut shrimps (way too much sauce, less than ten shrimps), and crispy spicy (Not spicy at all; I needed to add a lot of chili oil) chicken. Overall, foods were in such a low quality. Rather go to panda express. Later we realized that a Chinese restaurant right across the street received Michelin award and was visited by Obama.

Delish. My fiance had the garlic green beans lunch special. Also very yummy. The place doesn't have much ambiance nor the most polite service, but good enough and the food is what was quite good.

Five of us ordered 6 dishes to share. All of the dishes were quite satisfying. Not everything we ordered was the most authentic, but everything was tasty. It is definitely not the cheapest Chinese restaurant in town (most main dishes costing ~$12), but the food was worth it and the service was great.\n\nThe Mongolian beef was great. I do not usually order this dish, but it is probably the best version of the dish I have tried at a restaurant. The meat was tender and just spicy enough.  \n\nAnother good dish was the deluxe seafood sizzling platter. It was impressively served at the table on a really hot plate to great effect. It was loaded with pretty sizable scallops and also had some shrimp and squid. I definitely recommend you order at least one of the sizzling plates. \n\nWe also tried the honey walnut prawns (which for some reason are a staple at every Bay Area Chinese restaurant), the orange chicken, some egg rolls, and the string beans. All of the dishes were good, my least favorite being the egg rolls. Some of the members of my party expressed disappointment at the orange chicken. I thought it was fine. It is hard to know what good orange chicken is because it is not the most authentic dish and thus varies a lot based on the place you order it. \n\nOverall the food was enjoyable and filling. We ordered drinks which brought the price per person to about $23. Definitely not the cheapest, but the food was worth it and the service friendly and professional. All of the food was freshly made, served hot in a timely manner. They take reservations and the restaurant is spacious and appropriately decorated. I would say Hunan is a very 'tourist friendly' restaurant.\n\nIf you are in the city with a group of friends and/or family definitely check it out!", "author": "Augusto T."}

Our perseverance paid off!  \n\nOnce inside, we were seated quickly and they didn't even check our reservation.   We quickly noticed that almost all of the other tables were full, but only one of the groups was Asian.  So, using the measure that if the number of ethnic customers reflects how good the ethnic food is, this restaurant loses.  \n\nThe menu offers a variety of dishes and is in Chinese and English.  We ordered the sizzling prawns in chili sauce, Hunan beef with veggies, and fried rice with shrimp and pork.  They tasted fine.  Portion sizes were reasonable and served family-style.  The 3 entrees were ordered were perfect to fill the 3 of us up.  Service wasn't too bad either.  Everyone greeted us and they were quite speedy and attentive.

It was a beautiful day and we saw that Yelp gave this place a good review.\n\nIt isn't really a flashy facade, but inside I liked the atmosphere. It was quaint, but I went to the restroom, and there is a whole other room downstairs for parties I think.\n\nMy only complaint about the place is that our waiter didn't really seem to want to be there, but the food more than made up for it.\n\nI had the Squid Kung Pao. There were lots of pieces of squid and the sauce was wonderful. Tangy yet with the added hot chili oil I added, it was super flavorful and just fantastic.\n\nThey also give you free tea when you walk in, which was a nice touch. Plus they refilled our pot when it ran out.\n\nMy wife ordered a side of brown and white rice. Very delicate, I loved the brown rice with chili paste added to it with some soy sauce. Just perfect!\n\nIf you go to Chinatown, you must try this place. I think the owners were there and their kid was helping out I think. So good!\n\nThe prices were pretty reasonable too. I think my squid was 12 bucks.", "author": "Jason K."}

We (my two teen kids and I) for lunch a couple days after Christmas 2012. I chose it based on Yelp review. Have been a Californian all my life but have never eaten a meal in San Francisco's Chinatown. We were killing time while Dad had a business meeting nearby.\n\nThe food was simply blah and far inferior to a place we, thankfully, found near our Sacramento home that has the most fresh and flavorful Chinese food we've ever had without all that starchy thick sauce all over it. I kept silent wondering if it was just me then halfway through our meal, I had to know so I asked my kids very lightly (so as to not tip my hand and get a really honest opinion) what they thought. They both were not impressed. All three of us thought is was somewhat tasteless and too \"saucy\" in that generic Chinese restaurant way. Our place at home has super fresh dishes without any of that cloudy saucy look to it. The beef two of us had was overcooked and flavorless. All three of us were so disappointed.\n\nNone of us finished our meal and, this is a first, none of us asked for it be boxed up.\n\nThat was only paralleled by how indifferent the staff were to us. I felt we were invisible. We were the first patrons in at lunch time. No warm hello. More of a wave to a table and a \"sit there\". No one came by to say \"how is your lunch?\" The ONLY smile I got was (no surprise here) when the hostess came to give me the check. Smiling for the first time when bringing the check is a huge turnoff to me. That says \"I am now hoping the tip will be good and I'll pretend to be friendly even though no one in here has given you any attention whatsoever\"\n\nMy daughter had some sort of 3-seafood dish. My son and I both had Mongolian Beef. All, in all honestly, terrible.\n\nI don't review restaurants on Yelp often.

We originally were going for another place not far away but arrived to find it was only open for dinner on Saturdays and it was 2 in the afternoon. So we used Yelp and found Hunan Home's. My daughters and I had the xiao long bao, pot stickers, sweet/sour pork, chicken w/ orange peel and TWO dishes of chicken fried rice. They hadn't eaten breakfast since they knew we were headed to Chinatown, which means EAT. And HH did not disappoint. There was no wait, the staff was friendly and quick and like I said, the food was great. That's all we need to know.\n\nWe will definitely be back.", "author": "Jerry M."}

I have heard of R&G's but wanted an alternative to the $40 salt and pepper crab and maybe something more like a local favorite and right away noticed the reviews for Hunan Homes. I was sold.. I already knew I wanted Sizzling rice soup and orange peel chicken days before we even left on our trip. I also found a restaurant.com coupon for it so it was obviously the perfect choice. \n\nThe restaurant was only a short walk from our hotel which was again, perfect. So far this was working our great. The food did not disappoint once we got there and were sat, with no wait. The sizzling rice soup was very good, but not amazing. The pot stickers and orange peel chicken, awesome... some of the best I have ever had. We also got the Mongolian beef which had a lot of great flavor but was just a little bit on the spicy side for me. The Yang Chow fried rice, good, but not impressed. \n\nThe service was ok, not overly friendly but got the job done. Then something happened that I'll never forget. I took out the restaurant.com coupon and laid it on the table for our server to have as he prepared our bill. A few seconds later a different server came over and placed the bill on the table and seeming somewhat annoyed said that he had included our coupon. He did in fact, and we paid and even left a few extra dollars tip on top of the 18% included gratuity. Then we waited a minute or so. Our bill got picked up and we waited another minute. Are you kidding me, am I not getting a fortune cookie and little orange slices like every other table in this Restaurant?! Apparently our restaurant.com coupon was so grievous that they saw fit to rob me of my fortune. Deduct one star! \n\nThey are pretty lucky the food is delicious and i was about to walk through Chinatown and buy myself a whole bag of little fortune cookies!", "author": "Sarah S."}

The interior is rather standard Chinese restaurant fare, so nothing special there.  The service was prompt and attentive.  We particularly enjoyed the banter with one of the waiters/manager, who seemed to wonder the restaurant to make sure everyone was well attended to. He prepared our dipping sauce for the pot stickers (very nice as we were hosting guests from Florida and this was all a bit new to the dipping sauce thing!).  \n\nThe food was very good.  We had wonton soup, pot stickers, sizzling oysters (different and yummy), shrimp with honey walnuts, and chicken with snow peas (a bit boring, but it was tasty).  Everything was good to great.  I particularly enjoyed the sizzling oysters -- very large oysters with ginger and lightly sauted sweet onions.  The shrimp with honey walnuts was also great; the large juicy shrimp were covered with a light sweet sauce and served over a bed of cabbage with glazed walnuts.\n\nThe price was also quite reasonable.

After more than 4 years in the Bay Area (once having been a resident of Nob Hill) I am surprised that this is the first time I'd ever dined at a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown!\n\nTo keep the story short (since I'm not really in a mood to write long winded essays currently), I'd like to emphatically state that this place serves really awesome food at a great price. I am told it's Hunan Cuisine as more than hinted at by the name of the establishment, as well as by the numerous reviews on here, so Hunan it must be.\n\nOver the two visits, I've had some great chicken momos (or \"potstickers\"). The tea roast duck wasn't to any of our liking as we were partially put off by the pink color of the meat. \n\nThe orange chicken was great; I am usually not a fan of the dishes that lean more towards sweet than savoury but this one was definitely up my alley, and not because it was any less sweet but simply because of it's flavours.\n\nThe chicken and string beans was great with the black-beans sauce; I like my savoury entrees spicy and this one did the trick for me -- just about enough heat and spicy flavours. A discovery (for me) was the chicken-shrimps-and-eggplant dish; I thought it was simply fabulous !!! All these entrees would have been a perfect foil for steamed rice (we ordered fried rice instead) \n\nI enjoyed the \"chicken in garlic sauce\" but my friend disagreed. The \ngenerous portions of soup is good for 3-4 people. They were really tasty and served to whet up the appetite unless you overdo it. \n\nThe chicken Mui-Shu too was really good. The fried rice and chowmein were pretty decent if a little greasy. I think I will go with the steamed rice instead on my next visit. A veritable feast of no less than 5~6 dishes shared amongst the three of us came to barely hit the $60 mark. \n\nThis place is definitely on the money!", "author": "Umesh T."}

We all could not say enough about the Hot and Sour soup. A perfect balance of flavors and heat.  Next up was Chicken with Orange peel (a nice, light batter that retained texture under the sauce) and, the Shrimp with Honey Walnut (the shrimp were perfectly cooked with a wonderfully light sauce)\nWe also had a (good) vegtable fried rice and, stir-fried vegtables (while good. Not the best I've had).\nOf course, chinese beer through out the meal and a finisher of crisp fortune cookies and an exceptional green tea.\n\nThe readon for only 4 stars?\nThe service was pretty pretty dreadful. I almost wanted to apologize to the older man waiting on us for taking up his time. When the food was served, I asked for steamed rice, as neither meat dishes came with it. The look he gave me was pretty amazing. I'm surprised that I didn't get a stern NO with it.\nThe plates were taken throughout the meal, wether they needed to reach over you eating to get to anothers just finished plate or not. \nThe check and fortune cookies came IMMEDIATELY after the last bit of the last person was taken. We waived a young man over, who got our waiter as a couple of us wanted tea. When I asked him, he was not happy and turned to yell the length of the restaurant to the young man to bring tea.\nDefinitely felt like we got the bums rush throughout.\n\nHOWEVER...REALLY good food always trumps mediocre service and this was really good food!

Food made fresh to order, and piping hot when delivered to the table.  A little bothersome they charge for rice, but that's kind of a California thing it seems.  The food was excellent, and I'll certainly be back.  This restaurant is near the top of my list for fast-casual Chinese food in the Bay.", "author": "Zach S."}

I asked if they could make prawns in black bean sauce and the waiter matter-of-factly said \"no.\"  No explanation, nothing.  I found this interesting because there were several dishes on the menu with prawns and black bean sauce, just not combined.\n\nMy 12-year-old son then politely asked if they could leave out one ingredient in a dish that he was interested in.

It's not as down and dirty as some of the other places in Chinatown, yet not uptight or expensive either.\n\nI started with the hot and sour soup which comes with the lunch combo. It was very flavorful and relatively spicy, as hot and sour soup should be. For our entrees, my dad and I shared the Hunan Spicy Garlic Chicken and the Chicken with Orange Peel. The garlic chicken was flavorful and quite garlicy, the way I like it. The chicken with orange peel was deep fried and didn't have much orange taste, except for a couple pieces of orange rind that were visibly indistinguishable from the highly sauced and battered chicken.

And as cute as it sounds, don't risk putting yourself in my position. \n\nCame in just before 5pm since my boyfriend and I wanted to grab some dinner before the Macy's Tree Lighting event at Union Square. We parked at Portsmouth Sq, so it was a short walk, and the yelp reviews were the main selling point of this place. Chinatown usually \"closes\" around this time, so places that cater more to the locals are getting ready to shut down for the night. \n\nThis place was extremely understaffed, and as a server myself, I empathized. Plus, growing up in CT, customer service isn't much of an expectation. Probably why this place is full of tourists... I digress. \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small. Typical \"oriental\" decor and some cutesy Christmas lights. \n\nWe ordered the green onion beef, chicken with asparagus in garlic sauce, Chinese broccoli (gai lan) with oyster sauce, plus rice ($1/person). THE FOOD LITERALLY CAME OUT 2 MINUTES AFTER ORDERING--I should have been skeptical, rather, I was amazed. Green onion beef was good. It came out piping hot and the meat was tender. The chicken with asparagus dish was as well. Tasty, but one of the asparagus that I had was sour and not clean, so...shit (no pun intended). However, the Chinese broccoli was not worth it. It's a bundle of $.50 choy from Stockton St. right up the hill with enough oyster sauce for a few leaves. Note: we found mini white specs of tofu residue on our Chinese broccoli, so I assume they'd been using that same pot of water for who knows how long and for who knows what.  \n\nConstantly had to flag down a server (as if there were multiple servers...HA); at this point, I just wanted to get out of there and go on with my evening. You get a couple slices of orange and fortune cookies along with your bill. \n\nI left this place extremely dissatisfied.

The pork had a really great smoky flavor, the string beans were crispy and delicious. \n\nI had never had mu shu before, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I definitely did not expect the waiter to fill the pancakes for us at our table using two large spoons as his only tools! It was awesome! (also quite tasty).\n\nI will definitely go back.

We asked the waiter for recommendations and he told us about the string beans (contains minced pork) and the Orange peel chicken in addition to several other items. Both were comforting. The string beans were slightly on the salty side, but the orange peel chicken had dried and caramelized peels. Very interesting. We also tried the Wontons in Hot Sauce. Those we're amazing and decently spicy. We actually ended up keeping the bowl sauce on the table for the duration of the meal to eat with rice.", "author": "Suhaila S."}

I picked this place to have a special dinner with a family friend who wanted to have Chinese food in Chinatown. Plus she needed it to be wheelchair accessible. Thank god for Yelp for having that as a feature!  \nThe good: service (5-star), hot and sour soup (SOUR!), chicken with cashews \nThe bad: honey prawns, bathrooms not accessible for a person in a wheelchair, fried wontons (no filling, just fried skins), and the price of what we paid for what we received. \nPerhaps we ordered to conservatively. Other reviews call-out some things that sound really delicious... but what we received was just not cutting it.

(Blame fantasy football: Cecil Shorts' shoulder injury may have cost them a star.)\nHunan Homes was recommended to me by my Chinese landlord, so I expected great things. The interior was Boring Chinese Restaurant Standard, and everything looked pretty clean. Sadly, the plate I was given for my appetizers wasn't clean, so I asked for another one. With the new plate the waiter also brought me somebody else's soda, putting the idea into my brain that they were just phoning it in. The restaurant had a fairly standard menu, loaded with basic generic Chinese dishes - it lacked the ducks' ears, pigs' knickers, cow's foreheads and so forth that I have come to love seeing on a Chinese menu. (Possibly they had a different menu for their Chinese customers, and I got the safe one, but if so, that's a mistake: I often like ordering the weird stuff.)\nI ordered the potstickers as recommended here on Yelp, and they were kinda meh. I found them a tad greasy, and I didn't get any of that tasty dippin' sauce I was promised, unless it was the orange-red liquid stuff in the bottle, which was okay, but not all that tasty.\nFor the main course I had the kung pao squid, which also was a mixed bag. There was plenty of squid, but the squid pieces were quite large -- perhaps a bit too large -- and therefore a bit stringy. There was also too much green and red bell pepper for my taste -- I believe that a proper kung pao should contain meat, peanuts, and perhaps a few bashful vegetables hiding in the brown goop along with the dried hot peppers. I have no proof that this is the correct recipe, mind you, but that's how I like it. Given all of that, the dish had a subtle, smoky heat that was quite enjoyable. It felt like I disliked all of the ingredients, but the whole thing wasn't too bad. \nIn summary, it's possible that I caught them on a bad day, or they caught me on a bad day. However given all of the other restaurants in this city that I haven't tried yet, I doubt I'll come back here until Cecil Shorts' shoulder fully heals.", "author": "Paul M."}

(do asian people even sweat? the waiter sparked an argument between my brother and i on the subject). back to the part about him saving my life...i accidentally inhaled and choked on an entire piece of chicken because i failed to use my chopping sticks properly (i am white). as i was aspirating, the waiter (still with 29 other tables), dropped all the food he was carrying to another table and ran to assist me. in one swift movement, he pulled out a chair and threw me over the back of it, forcing the lodged piece of chicken out of my throat and back onto my plate. now that's what i call economical. after the mishap i went to the ladies room to freshen up. to my surprise, there was an entire plate of steaming hot general tso's on the back of the toilet. just sitting there waiting for me! i sampled a piece because i figured nobody would notice, as i did not order it so it was not for my eating. but really, who can resist general tso's? suddenly, and without any warning, i lashed out and ate the entire plate. i don't know what came onto me but that general tso's sure was delicious. peculiar though because they don't sell general tso's at this restaurant. i checked the menu. on my way back to my table, i discovered the room where they store all the rice. the door was opened and marked \"men's.\" i don't speak chinese but i'm assuming that's the chinese word for rice. .bags and bags of rice were among fancy looking porcelain rice washers attached to the walls. let me just say, this place is extremely fancy. porcelain rice washers!!! have you ever seen such a thing? i helped myself to some of the rice already in the washer. was also delicious (no surprise there). anyway, 10/10 would eat here again. i gave the waiter an $80 tip even though our bill was $40. how do you properly thank a man for saving your life?", "author": "Terry M."}

Way better than that swill that is often thrown in delivery combos.\n\nXiao Long Bao: Sad.  These Shanghai dumplings can be such a treat when done well.  This barely had any soup inside and I think the soup was chicken based instead of pork.  The sauce was more like a standard potsticker sauce rather than the glowing red sauce used for Shanghai dumplings. \n\nHome's Succulent Bread: This was pretty cool.  Bread, like the kind in a pork bun, all soft and gooey inside but deep fried on the outside.  Like a Chinese fried dough.  Loved the condensed milk to dip in.  Way tasty, but probably horrible nutritional value given the carbs, the oil and sugar.\n\nSizzling Prawns: Shrimp with a gooey corn starchy sauce poured over an extremely hot metal platter.  Fun presentation to hear all the sauce bubbling.  Didn't notice much texture difference though as no portions got seared.

We came here last April during the week and it was packed.  We were led to their back dining hall, and on the way there, I saw a bucket of mushrooms on the floor, waiting to be used in the kitchen.  Like, already washed and sliced, ready to go.  Ugh.  The items we ordered were typical -- fried rice, Kung pao chicken, some dim sum.  The entire time eating it, all I noticed was that everything was very greasy, and the chicken was like mystery meat.  Service was decent, the servers really hustle and work hard.  It's not the cleanest place, I wouldn't recommend it.

To celebrate, I rented a car and drove up here. Toward the end of my first day I was zig-zagging the streets of Chinatown on foot, peering in windows and examining menus, trying to decide how to bust my restaurant cherry, when I found Hunan Homes. I ordered the beef with orange peel to go and headed back to my hotel room. By the time I settled in the food was cold, but I was starving so I dug in. HEAVEN. It was sweet and savory and chewy and beefy, laced with chile peppers and strips of orange peel and served with shredded carrot and daikon in a vinegary marinade that perfectly offset the sweetness of the beef's glaze.\n\nI returned to L.A. and tried many restaurants over the ensuing year, searching in vain for that same perfect flavor. In 1992, I came back for my second visit to San Francisco with Hunan Homes at the top of my to-go-to list.\n\nIn 1993 I was in the midst of planning my third visit up north when everything got turned topsy-turvy and instead of planning a vacation to San Francisco I was planning a move here.\n\nSo, since 1993, Hunan Homes has been right in my backyard. Over the last decade and a half I have taken many friends and my entire family there and every single person has been as smitten as I am. Many of us remember when \"the old man\" was still alive...the family patriarch who oversaw the dining room with his never-empty glass of wine, stopping at each table to charm his customers.\n\nThe restaurant is now overseen by his son, James, and has retained its family-run feeling. When my parents come to visit twice a year, Hunan Homes is at the top of their list of must-go places as well, not only because of the food but because they appreciate the way that James and the staff make them feel so welcome.\n\nBut back to the food. I've been all over that menu and there hasn't been a single dish I didn't like. Today, among other things, we had the hot spice crispy chicken, a half-bird fried until the skin is crispy and even the bones are crunchy, then chopped up and slathered with a delectable sauce perfect for sopping up with rice or their \"succulent bread\". The sizzling sliced fish...how do they get so much flavor into a simple white fish? The house special crispy seafood chow mein is a nest of thin, crispy noodles topped with squid, fish, scallops, mushrooms and an assortment of vegetables.\n\nI could go on and on but I won't.

We ordered mu-shu chicken, chicken chow mein, sizzling rice soup, Mongolian beef, Hunan chicken, beef and broccoli and steamed rice for five adults. The soup was bland and the entrees were small and nothing special. They were fine, but not like \"the best beef and broccoli I have ever had.\" The only dish that was outstanding was the mu shu chicken, perhaps because the waitress wrapped each pancake for us so thee wasn't the usual dripping of chicken and veggies and plum sauce all over the place.\n\nThe plates are very small so order at least one or two more than you regularly would for your group size.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-05-03", "description": "I was visiting San Francisco for the first time in my adult life over the weekend and was turned on to this place by Yelp. 4-stars, with 300+ reviews? It felt like a \"can't miss\" type of place.\n\nI ordered all the Yelp favorites: hot & sour soup, potstickers, and orange peel chicken.\n\nHere's my breakdown of each dish:\n\nHot & Sour soup: This soup was more sour than anything else. I didn't get that hot/sour balance that makes hot and sour great. Although, the ingredients were good and plentiful and gave the soup a nice consistency, but again, it just tasted like a sour soup. Maybe this was just a bad batch?\n\nPotstickers: These were my favorite of the entire meal. They had pretty good flavor, and I liked how they were prepared. A nice seared crust on one side, with the rest of the potsticker being steamed. It gave a nice balance of texture throughout the dish. Although this was a good dish, it did have one MAJOR ISSUE. When I cut some of the potstickers in half, some of them had the pork mixture completely raw in the middle. This is unacceptable for any restaurant, and I had to knock them a star for this. If you are going to order this dish, please cut them in half to make sure they are cooked all the way through so you don't end up with food poisoning.\n\nOrange Peel Chicken: This was a slightly above average rendition of orange chicken. It had a nice flavor, but I still tasted the \"starchiness\" of the batter which took away from it. This dish was served family style, but the portion was very small and couldn't even satisfy two people with average appetites.\n\nAs alluded to my many previous Yelpers, I found that this place did not have any Chinese people eating inside. Probably most of the people inside were tourists, and the rest fellow Yelpers like myself being led astray. I could overhear some conversations about what people heard about on Yelp.\n\nI think this is the first time I've probably been outright disappointed with a place that had at least 4 stars and this many reviews. I expected a lot more than this, especially this being Chinatown in San Francisco. I've had way better Chinese food where I live in a suburb of So. Cal, where no Chinese people live at all. Next time, I'll just follow the trail of Chinese people to another restaurant.", "author": "Angelo P."}

We took forever to order because my parents are super picky, but we ended up ordering the same things we ALWAYS order...so typical.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n1. Mapo Tofu - very bland and not very spicy at all.\n2. Hunan Beef - was a bit cold and very mushy.\n3. Sweet and Sour pork - There wasn't much pork at all but rather a plate full of green/red bell peppers.\n4. Hunan Shrimp - Like the Hunan Beef, it was a bit cold and mushy.\n\nThe food in general is below par for Chinese food and the servings are super small.

We've been here a couple of times and twice... we saw a furry fat bald tailed rat running around late last year. Of course all the kids were screaming \"RAT RAT RAT!!\" and the waitress kept insisting that they had no vermin... Until Mr. Rat scurried across her feet since a neighboring table also started screaming. \n\nFood is actually good here (4 stars)... but sanitation is VERY VERY bad.... Unless... you have a thing for rats. The show was very entertaining I have to admit...\n\nSo the owner of the restaurant contacted me about the sanitation issues... and said that there are some \"rat-proofing\" methods done around the kitchen area. I don't know how that changes things in terms of keeping the furry friends out of the kitchen... or out of the dining area. (Yes it is Chinatown... and I would never trust the sanitation at ANY restaurant here... but this is the first restaurant where I've actually seen a live rat running around.) But still... vermin is vermin. He also requested that the time frame of my visit.  SO YELP READERS... This review is from 4 months ago! (If that makes any difference.... since we know that rats live a lot longer than 4 months... and can breed exponentially in tha time!) \n\nTo the restaurant's credit, the salt and pepper crab and lobster are done VERY well here. And if you are fond of little oinky-innards, they have this dish that boils pork blood cubes with pork intestines with tofu that's served over this flambe thing. That is very well flavored... I avoid the intestines and blood and go for the tofu.", "author": "Vicky L."}

I had the opportunity to Yelp it before I tried it with Boyfriend and his coworkers.\n\nCheap: Actually this place isn't as cheap as other Chinese restaurants, but it's not by any means expensive.  Lunch for 5 of us came to $46.  My two dishes (yes I'm a fatty) came out to be $16 JUST for myself, so if you're not like me, lunch will definitely only run you sub $10.\n\nQuick: All of our dishes came within 10 minutes of us ordering.  This place is all about efficiency, and our bill was on the table, fortune cookies included, before we were even done eating.\n\nDelicious: I love sizzling rice soup, and this is the best I've had.  Flavorful broth, tender pieces of shrimp and chicken, and duh, sizzling rice.  They only come in a medium bowl, which could theoretically serve 2-3 people, but what they didn't understand was that I wanted it all for myself, so them pre-splitting it into smaller bowls was counterproductive, and it also prompted Boyfriend to take one of the bowls.  Not that I'm not about sharing, but this is all mine.  I also ordered the string beans a la carte (didn't come with rice, nor was it really considered a lunch dish), and they were deliciously spicy and yummy.  I would totally give Hunan homes 5 stars had their green beans been better than the ones at Betelnut.

Upon entering, I noticed none of the tables were Chinese. We ordered fried tofu as appetizer which was decent. But the two main courses were total westernized rubbish that shouldn't exists at the heart of Chinatown: the first course used tomato sauce for starch, authentic Hunan food never use starch in the first place, let alone tomato sauce in starch. The second one was Hunan Smoked Pork: it's NOT even Hunan style smoked pork. It's obviously Cantonese style: red, grilled, sweet instead of black, smoked, spicy and full of flavor. Hunan food is also normally famous for its spiciness, oily over high fire, both of our main dishes taste bland and sour. I understand why it is getting four star overall reviews despite our experience. It is perfectly westernized Cantonese food with a random Hunan branding, the dining area is also tidier and cleaner than regular Chinese restaurants, catering to its western customers. The server were all dressed up giving you this upscale vibe (the service though is no better than regular Chinese restaurant, we were basically invisible to them after ordering, and it took a long time for the to notice that we are ready for the check, when wife stands up and starts leaving our table, but we don't care and we still tip). But make no mistake, this is no Hunan food, not even good Chinese food. There is no shame in catering to its specific market segment. It might very well be a more profitable market. There is also no shame starting from westernized Chinese food if you really do enjoy its food, kudos for trying something different. The shame is in the restaurant's use of the word \"Hunan\" and reference of Hunan food on its menu. And this is especially for the foodies who are looking for  authentic Chinese food and also as a note to myself: observe the makeup of a restaurant's customers before trusting Yelp's overview ratings.", "author": "Francis Z."}

Cooked just right so that those components that should be crispy (such as snow peas and carrots) were, and the meats were perfectly tender and not overcooked. The waiters were serious as can be, great job. There was even a guy who would come around and clean up the mess we were making with a hot towel.

Waiters are personable and joke a lot with the regulars. The hot and sour soup is the best I've ever had here. The main dishes are a little skimpy on meat, though, so I don't normally go here too much any more, but it still is very good. It's a good safe place for a group outing.

Both are very simple and hard to mess up. \n\nWe ordered chicken in garlic sauce and kung pao beef for our entrees. They were both very good. The meat was prepared well, and we were particularly intrigued by the chicken dish. There was no breading on the chicken, (which normally I don't like because it's so fattening) and it was all white meat. Usually you can really tell what your eating when you order meat at a Chinese restaurant, but we were definitely eating chicken!\n\nThe restaurant is also very clean which I have had a difficult time finding a clean Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. \n\nAll around, it was a good experience and I would return.", "author": "Aubrey Y."}

I'll describe them here.\n\nPrawns in walnut sauce were not at all what I expected, but very tasty.  The walnuts were sweet with some sort of honey glaze.  I couldn't really put my finger on what the sauce was made of, but it kind of reminded me of a mayo-based sauce you might get with tempura shrimp.  The prawns were very fresh and fried really lightly, which was a good complement to the sauce.  They were served atop shredded lettuce, which was also a nice complement to the dish.  I added chili oil and a little soy, which I thought made it even better.\n\nBlack mushrooms with delicate greens was really black mushrooms with bok choy.  I love both of these ingredients, but I have had this dish done better.  In fact, I've made this dish better myself at home.  There was very little sauce, but lots of garlic.  It was definitely good, but nothing memorable I'll be trying to replicate at home.  \n\nAll of the staff were extremely friendly.  And they bring orange slices for dessert, which always makes me happy.  I'd give an extra .5 if I could just for that.", "author": "Melinda I."}

It was great to find a place where the owner knows all of his customers, the servers were extremely friendly and accommodating, and the food tasted as good as it looks.\n\nWe had our rehearsal dinner here. It was sixty people, we had the room downstairs, James (the owner) helped us choose a menu based on our favorite items and made \"milder\" modifications for our older guests (at a very reasonable price), and we had EXCELLENT service throughout the night.\n\nEveryone commented how great the food was - the orange chicken was the favorite.  They also have this great whole fish (which James included in our price) with soy and tofu and veggies that looks gorgeous on the table and tastes even better.\n\nThe other great advantage of this restaurant is they validate parking at the Portsmouth Garage and the HIlton on Kearney.\n\nMmmm, orange chicken!", "author": "Christine O."}

We yelped looking for a good Chinese restaurant and stumbled across this one.  Boy were we happy we did,  everything we ordered here was OUTSTANDING!!!! I wish we could of ate here for every meal. To start we ordered sizzling soup, my sons were fighting to see who was going to lick the bowl LOL. I fell in love with there pot stickers, they were tender and there ginger sauce was something that should be sold in a jar so everyone can partake in something that taste this good. Next came the main course, I can't go into as much detail as I would like,  because there is to much good stuff to put into detail. The only thing I can say is try the sizzling beef, your taste buds will think you for it. My kids were asking the whole trip to go back more orange chicken(and to see the puffer fish that was smiling at them). Another thing that I liked was the owner went to every table to see if you needed anything and ask how the food was. It was nice to know that he care about his guest.

When you think Chinatown restaurant, you get the image of a small cramped place that's sorta dirty and crumby... this place was the opposite. It looked clean, felt clean, and was very spacious. Not cramped at all. Overall it was great. Dishes and utensils.\n \nService: Awesome. Everyone was attentive and nice. Plenty of service at tables and constant attention that wasn't too intrusive. Loved it.\n\nFood: We ordered the chicken hot and sour soup, tofu, and chicken with blackbean curd. All was GREAT! Very filling, portion was big, and wasn't filled with MSG... no crash after. LOL! It was very good. The hot and sour soup was great for a cold night. Got our nose's running and that's always a good sign. It wasn't too spicy at all, but just enough to satisfy the spicy soup craving. The tofu was cut thick, perfect. The provided a sauce with green onion in it that complimented it very well. The chicken and black bean curd was very good as well. Very tasty, not overwhelming on the pallet, and was a perfect marriage with a side of rice. \n\nOverall, I'd DEFINITELY come back. A great diamond in the rough among some of the dank and dark restaurants within the heart of Chinatown. Come and experience it yourself and you'll see.", "author": "Jay V."}

But, it was mostly families so it made sense. Since it was just the two of us, they were able to seat us right away. When we walked through the main dining area up front, all the tables were full. They took us to the second dining room downstairs, which almost made us feel special, like we were part of an elite club of people. The downstairs area was pretty empty, so it was kind of weird that there were so many groups outside, in the rain, but it quickly filled up.\n\nWe are big Chinese food fans, normally eating it twice a month or so. And, I don't want to sound racist or anything, but you can generally tell a good Chinese food place by the people who are eating there, if you know what I am getting at. \n\nNow to the food. We ordered a bowl of Wonton Soup, Eggrolls, Vegetable Chow Mein, and Spicy Chicken in Garlic Sauce. They were all very good. I have said mostly really good things about this place and you might be asking yourself, \"self, why only 4 stars?\" Let me tell you. It is mainly just for the portion size. I feel like often times, when you go to a Chinese restaurant you get a little cheated on the portion size. That was certainly the case here. Between two people, we were able to polish all of this off with a bowl of rice and still go home slightly hungry. To give context, I am a 6 ft 170 lb guy and my girlfriend is 5'8\" and 120lbs. That is the main reason for the 4 star, not 5 star review. Other than that, I would highly recommend this place.", "author": "Michael C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-30", "description": "My SO and I were in town for a night out on the town and since she is a big fan of Chinese food I wanted to wow her with a place that I knew would be good.  After perusing Yelp for about 30 minutes I came across Hunan Home's.  I read review after review trying to get the best possible idea of what our encounter would be like.  The more reviews I read, the more my confidence grew that this would be the place that we would have to try!\n\nLet's get to the actual experience though....\nWe walked in on a Monday evening and the place was absolutely packed!  There was one free table in the restaurant, and we just happened to get it since it only accommodated two.  We sat down and were immediately greeted by our server who took our drink order.  The server was very quick and attentive.  We ended up doing a family style combination order for the two of us which included the following:\nSizzling Rice Soup\nEgg Roll\nFried Prawn\nPot Sticker\nOrange Peel Chicken - Substituted to the Hunan Chicken\nSizzling Beef\n\nWe substituted out the white rice for the pork fried rice and then ordered some chicken chow mein as we wanted to try as much variety as we could.  \n\nOur soup came very quickly and was delicious.  It had chunks of chicken, shrimp & veggies in it and was a great start to the meal.  Shortly after that, our appetizers came.  My first taste was of the fried prawn.  This prawn was the best prawn I had ever had.  It was extremely crispy.  From that moment on, I was hooked!  The pot sticker was great, the egg roll was pretty good also.  You could tell that everything was made fresh and I liked the fact that I felt I was getting quality food for a decent price.  \n\nOur entrees came and they were also delicious.  My only negative would have to go with the sizzling beef.  The presentation of the dish was great as they let it sizzle right at the table (kind of like fajitas), but we kept getting struck by hot oil on our arms because of the small table and that was rather annoying.  The taste of the dish itself though....great!  The Hunan Chicken was also very good.  It had a little bit of a kick, but not too much.  The chicken was very succulent and the accompanying veggies were tasty with the sauce that came on the dish.  The fried rice had large chunks of pork and the rice was very fluffy.   Probably the best fried rice I've ever had.  The chow mein was also great.\n\nOverall, I was extremely impressed and pleased with Hunan Home's Restaurant.  I would definitely recommend this place to a friend/co-worker/family/etc. and would not think twice about going back again.  While the prices are a little high compared to a lot of Chinese places, the quality is top notch and the service is great.  I don't mind paying a little extra when the overall experience is wonderful, and in this case it really was.  \n\nHunan Home's is now officially the greatest Chinese food restaurant I've ever had.", "author": "Craig C."}

My friends from Japan were here again and were craving a duck, so off to Hunan Homes we go.\n\nThe duck here is tasty. A little too much meat left on the skin for me, but still good. Crispy savory skin, not too greasy. My only complaint would be that the waitress put a little too much sauce on the pancake for me, so that the taste of the duck was overwhelmed. No biggie though. \n\nThe Xiaolongbao were excellent, that's a must try if you've never had them, and the Mapo doufo was molten lava hot, as it should be. Steamed chicken with ginger was subtle and tender, and the asparagus was very fresh tasting.\n\nWe don't come here for the typical stuff, so I couldn't tell you how the sweey and sour pork is, but I've had better chow mein at other places. huey dewey louie's  (New Woey Loey Goey) across the street has better noodles.\n\nThe waitress is a kick, she was trying to correct our atrocious Cantonese pronunciation, and is always a lot of fun to flirt with.

Hunan is the exception I make.  \n\nNow, why in the world would I drive all the way into Chinatown just for Chinese food????   Hunan is the real deal.  They have a wide range of dishes for everyone.  Not only have they captured  the tourist crowds, they have a steady and strong  local following.\n\nI've been going to Hunan for over 20 years.  I'm glad to report my taste buds have evolved from Chicken Chow Mein (seems like a simple dish, but no one makes it as well as them) and Beef Satay.  I still like those dishes, but now I really enjoy their other dishes such as the Salt & Pepper Crab.  It's very meaty and flavorful.  Not overly breaded or fried.   I'm so addicted to this dish! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the crab.  Give me that and nothing else and I'll be more than happy.\n\nThe ginger and scallion variation is also very good if you don't like fried seafood.  The veggie dishes I like to order are the green beans and egg plant.  They both have the right amount of heat and sauce.  The honey walnut prawns are delicious.  They aren't over fried or over glazed with the sweet mayo sauce.  My friends like ordering the pig's blood medley, the catch of the day and Peking duck.  No dinner is complete until the succulent bread is ordered.  It tastes magically delicious when you dip it into the condensed milk that is served on the side.\n\nIt's really best to go with a group of friends so you can try as many dishes as possible.\n  \nSometimes, there is a wait when the place is crowded.  Walk around or enjoy the fish tank and see how many of them you can identify from \"Finding Nemo.\"\n\nLastly, the staff.  James, the owner  and Dong Dong, the hostess are very nice and have a great sense of humor.  They create a very warm atmosphere along with their attentive wait staff.

The prices and layout is more like a tourist attraction, but at least it stays relatively clean.  The service is decent, although they tend to be a little rushy when there is a line, not a huge problem though. The food itself is quite delicious. I like stronger flavored-food, so this place fits my taste buds. My favorite is definitely the hot and sour soup. Just thinking about it makes me salivate. It has the perfect level and mix of spiciness and sourness to keep me drinking until the very last drop. I'm not over exaggerating, but I would really lick the bowl clean if people were not around. \n\nAnother favorite is the eggplant with chicken and prawns. The eggplants are always cooked so that it melts in your mouth, and the chicken is tender and juicy. They could probably add a few more prawns to the plate, but the flavor makes up for that. The mu shu pork is also delightful. The wrap is soft and chewy, which makes it easy to hold the ingredients in. It does harden within minutes though, so eat it up quick! They always end the meal with a fortune cookie and slices of oranges, so that's always a treat.

The restaurant is pleasant enough, but I totally agree with James B.'s review: the prices are above average for smallish portions and less than flavorful food.\n\n1. We asked for pot stickers fried (not steamed).  They were small and mushier than I would've expected for fried dumplings.\n2. The eggrolls were the size of small Vietnamese spring rolls, not the thicker kind we were used to from Chinese places back in Chicago.\n3. The beef with broccoli was just that: beef with broccoli and a little bit of gravy/sauce.  We ordered a dinner-sized entree, and it was small.  Maybe you get more if you order carryout, but we paid $10.50 and thought it was paltry, even for lunch.\n4. The shrimp fried rice was a total rip: we ordered a large portion and got what we thought was a small plate.\n5. Like 98% of the other two hundred Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, Hunan Home's gives out cans of soda, and you'll pay something like $2.25 for every can.\n6. When we order Chinese food back home, entrees usually come with at least a small steamed rice; not here.  Even though we ordered an additional shrimp fried rice for around $8, they charged us an extra $6 after we asked for steamed rice...why?\n\nWe thought our $59 bill for two appetizers, two entrees, an extra thing of fried rice, a can of Coke and steamed rice was expensive for just the three of us.  The service was decent overall, and we were seated right away.  We're used to Chinese waiters being less than gracious and friendly, and Hunan Home's didn't disappoint in that regard.", "author": "Robert S."}

Hunan Taste in San Jose uses black bean sauce, fresh garlic and string beans that are fried dry leaving them very crispy.

The hot n. sour soup could've been a little more sour, but the vinegar on the table took care of that.  I had the tofu with asparagus in black bean sauce, which was great.  So often that dish can be overwhelmingly salty, but not here.  The tofu was also really soft and sliced into these irregular chunks, which I really liked for some reason. \n\nOther entrees were basil chicken (HOT HOT HOT) and the oft-reviewed orange peel chicken, which looks kind of nasty, but tasted good in  that bad-for-you-deep fried-chinese-food- kind of way.\n\nPrompt, attentive service.

It was served traditionally with green and white onions and hot peppers.  Unlike most Chinese/Hunan places in the area, they managed to make this sloppy dish of goodness presentable, as opposed to the colorless pile of overcooked stuff in a spicy gravy.  While still cooked and piping hot, the onions held their intended texture and color.  Most impressively, the beef was very good.  It was cut and cooked just right so that it melted in your mouth.  \n\nWhen dining in, the hot and sour soup and hot tea is complimentary.  I'm not one for most Asian soups but I thought their hot and sour was very well balanced.  Not too sweet, not too sour, not too spicy.  It was also dense with substance (not just tofu and peas floating in broth).\n\nService was very good.  Never had to ask for my water to be refilled.

The hostess was not friendly and down right rude, not so much to us but to others as they come in - she doesn't even look at them and just shout out the time they'll need to wait.  This kind of behavior is just not acceptable anywhere, doesn't matter how good or popular you are.  Anyway, she took on some calls while we were waiting - we can tell at least one call was from a regular because she looked out to the dining room and said something into the receiver.  Next thing you know, she walked to the dining room and then took a Reserved sign on a table that was being cleaned for US!  The nerve!

Medium sized tables cover the floor, while several rows of artificial bamboo eaves protrude garishly from the ceiling where their emerald green color forms a gruesome clash a with walls painted in donut-box pink.  There's two dining areas....a bustling one in front that's blessed with a small amount of natural light and a back area that handles larger crowds and lunchtime overflow.\n\nLightening fast service reflects a desire to maximize table turnover though the waitstaff is polite and never fails to greet, chat up, and briefly joke with anyone they recognize as a regular.\n\nThe lunch plates I've ordered don't give you the same bang-for-your-buck that you'll get in Daly City or the Outer Sunset, though they're quality and value are better than most you'd expect to find in these higher-rent surroundings. Service is fast, efficient, and businesslike....the waitstaff fills your water glass before it gets empty, and a check hits your table seconds after you request it.  While I've never eaten anything other than lunch here, the noontime vibe is definitely one of eat-and-exit rather than sit-and-socialize.\n\nIt's a great spot if you're looking for an affordable sit-down Chinese place, and especially so if you're on lunch-hour time constraints.  Furthermore, table-and-waiter service in combination with steam-tray deli pricing makes for a great lunch value.  My downtown client eats Chinese all the time in this area....it's her favorite, and one of mine too.  Mike says check it....", "author": "Mike W."}

There was a 15 minute wait and as we were waiting outside for our table I noticed a dead fly and a live fruit fly inside the restaurants front window. As we were waiting there also seemed to be large tourist groups that were showing up w a guide and going inside for dinner. I didn't take any of this to be a good sign. Once we sat down we were promptly given menus and warm weak tea. Then we waited for approximately ten minutes for someone to come by and take our order. I would normally flag someone down but that wasn't possible here, anyone who walked by was paying us no mind and in a v big hurry. If you would like anything to drink other than weak yea you need to ask for it, you won't even be offered water. Our check never came. That also took forever and we ended up walking up to the hostess stand to pay so that we could finally leave. The food itself was pretty ok. I don't know enough about Chinese food to determine how authentic it was but it was tasty and to me that's all I care about. Overall it was an ok experience", "author": "lydia d."}

Thank goodness, it didn't take an hour to get to us.\n\nUnfortunately, the food DID NOT make up for the wait. The orange chicken was okay, the vegetable chow mein barely had any vegetables, and the rice was rice. \n\nI think we could have walked out without paying and no one would have noticed. Maybe we SHOULD have.\n\nBased on reviews on Yelp and other places, this was the China Town restaurant that we decided to try.

What can I say?  Delicious, delicious, delicious. We started with potstickers, since they're my favorite.  They were the best.  A lot of people on this site mentioned the honey walnut prawns. Holy crap, they were mouth-wateringly good.  We also had the double mushroom with prawns and scallops.  Also delicious and such a creamy sauce they were in!  There were so many tempting things on the menu, but I know when I go back (most likely  next week), I'll order the honey walnut prawns.\n\nWhat else I liked: the serving sizes were normal. Usually when you go to a restaurant they give you a ridiculously large amount of food.  These were regular portion sizes and I appreciated that. I hate getting three portions on one plate.\n\nAs a former waitress, my standards are pretty high as far as service goes, and the staff here more than surpassed it.  I couldn't believe how attentive the service was. Right before our potstickers came out, the server mixed a little sauce of hot oil, vinegar, and soy at our table, and when the stickers came out, they actually served us the first ones.  Our drinks were kept filled at all times (and letting my water get low is my biggest peeve in a restaurant).\n\nCaveat: this place crawls with hick tourists.  One man kept trying to tell his server about \"how they do \"egg drop soup\" in Florida.\"  Oy vey, what a knob.  But it was worth it for the delicious food and wonderful service.

However, every single plate I try/order is so good that it keeps me curious about what else this place has to offer. Some of my favorites include the duck wrap, honey walnut prawns, and their sizzling platers(please excuse my if-fy descriptions of their food!). On top of the superb quality of the food, I absolutely love the cleanliness of the restaurant! Honestly, I've been to many Chinese restaurants which are \"icky\" - with my standards, I consider them filthy. But Hunan Homes is so well-kept that I feel perfectly comfortable with dining there. \n\nTheir prices are very reasonable and it is a great place for tourists, groups, and kids! I also think that the services are fantastic. To sum things up, I would definitely recommend Hunan Homes because of the delicious food, welcoming atmosphere, and the owners are so awesome!", "author": "Kelly Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-24", "description": "Having a restaurant come highly recommended is a blessing and a curse.  It can often lead you to a location you would have otherwise missed, but more often than not, it has also heightened my expectations of the establishment to a point that I am disappointed by a \"good\" meal.  So, at my sisters suggestion, 8 of us went to eat in Chinatown last night at Hunan Homes.  \n     We had no reservation, but were immediately seated to a nice round table towards the back.  Even though there were only 3 of us there when they sat, the friendly staff never pressured us to get started.  By the time we had all settled in, I was so ready to order it was painful.  I had been looking over their extensive menu for 20 minutes, and by that time, each minute felt like an hour.  We were unsure how much to order, so each person around the table suggested a dish.  I added a few, needless to say, to the raised eyebrows around the table.  The order was:\nPrawns with Honey Walnut, Kung Pao Chicken, Beef Fried Rice, steamed white rice, Combination Chow Mein, Sizzling Beef Platter, Mongolian Beef, Hot Sour Soup, Eggplant with Spicy Garlic Sauce, and Xiao Long bao.  \n   The hot and sour soup came out first, quickly followed by a succession of dishes.  The entire order had been served in about 10 minutes, which was just perfect.  it gave us each time to take a serving off of each new plate before new ones arrived.  Let me just cut to the chase and say, it was FANTASTIC!  \n     I had read about the Prawns w/ walnuts and the sizzling beef platter on Yelp, and the other dishes were some of the usual standards I order at Chinese restaurants.  Here were some of my thoughts about the individual dishes.  \n     The hot and sour soup was good.  Perfectly spiced, good consistency, and perfect temperature.  At first i thought there was something lacking, something missing, but reflecting back on the meal, it did exactly what it was supposed to. It awakened my pallet and got me ready for more.\n     The combination chow mein was one of the best i have ever had.  Perfect consistency, not too greasy, AMAZING flavor.  I could have eaten it all to myself, but was grumpy to only taste a small serving before it was gone (I would go back for this alone).\n     The prawns w/ honey walnut were good, but I was a bit disapointed.  I might have preferred the walnuts crushed and tossed with the prawns in the honey sauce before served.  Still, the prawns were perfectly cooked and had a nice, sweet flavor.  I seemed to be the only one at the table not blown away by the dish, so dont take it personally. :)\n     The sizzling beef platter has an amazing presentation.  A hot cast iron plate sits with a few sizzling onions on a wooden plate, before the beef and vegtables were dropped onto it at the table.  GREAT flavors! Very crisp vegtables, tender beef... love it.\n     The Mongolian beef was also one of the best i have ever had.  A perfect combination of scallions, hot peppers, a small amount of those crispy rice noodles that sometimes overwhelm the dish.   \n     The kungpao chicken was perfectly executed... nice cuts of chicken with fresh vegetables.  I dont know if i will order it again.  It feels like a comfort food for me now, and im looking for new flavors over old favorites.  Still, very tasty.\n     The real winner was the Eggplant with Spicy Garlic Sauce and minced pork.  If you go there, you HAVE to order this dish if none other.  I was skeptical at first when we ordered it, ive had it before at a few places and was never impressed.  So glad to be surprised.  I scooped the extra sauce over the Xiao Long Bao dumplings to perfection.  Wow.  This is getting painful to write.  \n     In summary, it was incredibly consistent.  Each dish had a unique flavor (so rare in common Chinese restaurants), was perfectly cooked, and excellent presentation.  The staff were patient, funny and always attentive and available.  The bill with tip came to $164 (20% tip).  per person, it was $20.50.  I cant remember the last time I feasted at a restaurant and only spent $20.  that included three Tsingtsao's and 3 glasses of wine.  Without that, it would have been closer to $15 per person.  If you haven't eaten here, please check them out.  I hear they have free parking validation with a $20 purchase.  I will certainly be back and am very grateful for the recommendation.  I cant remember the last time a meal lived up to such a good buildup.   \n\nAs an afterthought, I saw an order of the Sizzling Prawns go out as we were leaving... they looked and smelled so good i almost ordered it togo.  Next time.  Very very good.", "author": "Beau S."}

The wait was about 25 minutes, and maintained a line the entire time we were there. I'm fairly certain it's always crowded since there were a lot of regulars coming in. Good service--always had water in my glass, and were friendly.\n\nI think the restaurant is probably as good as people have said, we just didn't order the \"right' things. We started with Potstickers--delicious, moist pork in a tender dough that was wonderfully browned on the bottom side. Very yummy, and about $6.\n\nWe then split three main dishes: Kung Pao Chicken, Chicken with String Beans, and the FIsh with Spicy Salt. The fish was interesting: basically deep-fried in a Fish-&-Chips-style, but the seasoning was really good. Salty, but spicy...There wasn't any visible spices on the surface of the fish either--it was all cooked into the batter. \n\nThe Kung Pao was forgettable. It actually looked & tasted quite a bit like the chicken with string beans (though, chicken is chicken...so what did I expect)/ But they were cooked the same way, diced, and in a similar sauce. The beans were good--double fried so that they dry out and form a blistered skin. \n\nTotal came to $47. It was good, but I don't think I would order either chicken dish again...I would go back, but for some of their sizzling plates, other seafood, and mu shu.", "author": "Sarah H."}

The chicken was well cooked (all white meat) and the sauce had subtle spice and a strong delicious garlic flavor.  The squid was surprisingly tender and the spicy salt a little addicting.  The Hunan pork was tender and good with lots of smoky flavor.  The string beans....it is very odd for me to like a vegetable over a meat, but this dish was great, great flavor and very spicy.

My choices were reduced to this place and Eastern Garden, the later which was so packed and out-the-door that we decided to go across the street. Also the florescent factor isn't a factor at Hunan Homes. If you want to go somewhere where you'll look good, it's Hunan Homes. They have little chandeliers and the place is painted a calming mauve - lending an air of charm and peace.\n\nIt's actually pretty busy though - most tables were taken and there was a farily large team of waiters working. \n\nThe service is very good here. We were never for want of anything and also never felt rushed. If we finished something, we were offered more. Water and tea were refilled quickly and everyone always had a smile. \n\nWe started with the Xiao Long Bao, thin skinned pork dumplings with broth inside. I finally found out the proper way to eat a dumpling here! Put the dumpling in a big soup spoon, add the dark dipping sauce, and guzzle all. Delicious.\n\nThen we had dried scallop soup. It looked exactly like hot and sour, but the strands of egg and bits of mushroom were interspersed with flakey chunks of dried scallop which was tender but smokey tasting and the soup had an overall sweetness of shellfish. I found it a little thick but overall it was delicate and interesting.\n\nOur last three items were snow pea leaves with garlic, walnut prawns, and salt n' pepper spare ribs - a bit more generic. I think I want to go on a general salt n' pepper spare ribs hunt to find my favorites. The ribs here were not greasy, and not all ribs had bone in them. I didn't find them too fatty and the spices in the coating were just right. Also, the pork had a nice porky flavor - not overcooked or dry, and meaty. Now that I've ordered walnut prawns in several places, I'm pretty much over them. Usually when I order them from Thai Chi they send them with the mayo on the side so you can add it after you receive them. Tonight they already had the mayo on them of course, and although that is specifically how the dish is always served, that to me is overkill - I prefer to dip them myself. But walnut prawns are always fun.A table next to us ordered an amazing looking whole fish. I think tapping into the seafood offerings here is probably the way to go.\n\nWe ate it all and enjoyed it. We also had a large beer and the price came to $72 with tip. This restaurant was a $$ so I pretty much expected this. Still, I want to tap into yelp's favorite \"$\" level places. We looked at a few of them, which my friend had been to, and made our decision. But plainly Chinatown has a lot of hidden treasures in these little hole in the wall places. I appreciated how friendly and inviting they were, and the manager was also very nice. Thanks Hunan Homes!", "author": "Roxmarie M."}

I went first when I was 6 (and I'm not going to tell you how long ago that was!).  Then when we lived in the bay area we went many times, often with our then young children.  Now, after a 16 year absence from SF we were back.  It didn't disappoint.  The city guide in my hotel had an interview with Frances Ford Coppola and he listed it twice as his favorite restaurant in SF.  Met friends there, after 16 years we were a little worried that it would still live up to our memories and that our friends would enjoy it.  Boy, did it ever. The dumplings are delicate.  The won-tons in the won-ton soup are hand made at the restaurant and the broth rich and flavorable.  Love, love the eggplant in spicy garlic.  Now living over 1000 miles away I am going to have to figure out how to make it at home.  Enough garlic to keep the vampires away and just the right amount of spice to clear the sinuses but not enough to warrant ordering a glass of milk with dinner.\n The meal is finished as it always was with tasty fortune cookies (with real Chinese fortunes) and slices of sweet oranges.

I ordered the kung pao chicken because it is one of my all time favorites and It was yummy but the next time I went I ordered their spicy orange peel chicken to try something new and it was the BEST ORANGE CHICKEN i have tried to date. You can order your meals extra spicy if you like spicy food like me and they also offer brown rice instead of white.", "author": "Shirley E."}

The hot and sour soup is consistently delicious.  Once, I strayed from my usual lunch plate and ordered the mongolian beef and didn't care for it much.  You can pay extra for brown rice w/ the lunch plates, which is nice, but I've always stuck w/ white rice.  Service is fast and the owners are very welcoming.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-02-23", "description": "I went to this restaurant becasue it was highlighted on Eye On The Bay this past weekend.  So when my husband (who is a very busy man) invited me to lunch yesterday, I quickly suggested the \"Hunan Homes\".  Well, I used to work in the city and frequented quite a few of the restaurants that feature asian cuisine. I remembered trying this restaurant many years ago and not ranking them very high on the list. But because they gave it such high profile, I thought I would try it again. Unfortunately, it is exactly as I remembered it. We had the hot and sour soup, the combo rice, the mongolian beef and the spicy chicken and garlic dishes.  The first 3 dishes were bland at best. Then after we were just about done with the other 3 items, they brought the chicken dish out (at least I think it was chicken). YUCK!  So, I pushed it aside and continued to finish the rest of the food we were given. Well, when it was time to pay the bill, the waiter came over and asked were we done? We said yes. He gestured toward the chicken dish as if to ask what about it?  My husband very quietly said - \"she did not like it\". He then asks - if we want to take it home? Are you kidding me? So we still very quietly said - NO. The waiters response was to hunch his shoulders up, take the plate away and dump it! No, \"I'm sorry you did not enjoy your dish, can I get you something else?\" \"Can I get the manager?\" Nothing at all to acknowledge my experience.  \n\nThe food and service that I experienced yesterday did not deserve the glowing highlight that it was given this past weekend. As a matter of fact, there should be a disclaimer encouraging people to go there at their own risk.  On the other hand, the \"Great Hunan\" right down the street on Columbus has been there for many years. The food is terrific and fresh. It is a hole in the wall, but I have not been disappointed.  By the way, I have absolutely no connection to the \"Great Hunan\".  Just offering up and alternative.   :-)", "author": "Annie W."}

Their mushu pork is great! They wrap your first one with 2 spoons in front of you to show you how it's done, I love watching the precision! The string beans with minced pork and steamed rice, is just a great combo! The hot and sour soup is fantastic and just warms you right up!

After all the reviews we've read, we figured it should be pretty good. We walked in on a Friday night with no reservations at about 6 and were promptly seated. Hot and sour soup was very good. We ordered the curry chicken and hunan prawns. Downed them in no time flat. We were stil hungry so the waitress suggested we try the beef sizzling plate. Great dish! Overall, very good food and friendly service. But what's the deal with the tour bus groups? We sat there for almost 2 hours and we must've seen at least 3 groups of tourists with cameras swinging from their necks numbering anywhere from 12 to about 25 folks each. They all had this dumbfounded look on their face like they had never had chinese food before. They must have some huge cave in the back where they cater to groups as the front dining area isn't that big and it was consistently full all evening. Overall, a good night out for chinese, but with so many other options available, we'll chalk this up as good place to go, but we'll try other places next time. Don't want to get stuck in a rut.", "author": "Tom B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-20", "description": "Excellent Hunan cuisine.!  Being a Cantonese lover, I I love to try other things and broaden my horizons; after seeing and hearing about Hunan Homes for years, I finally tried them yesterday.  The pot stickers are crispy golden with a wonderfully seasoned ground pork, ginger, and cabbage filling.  The Hunan Homes bread, which should technically be a dessert, is crispy and greasless with an icing like dipping sauce that is sweet and creamy.  The chicken with orange peal is crispy and greasless, some pieces more tender than others, but still good with not too much badder in a light orange flavored sauce with slices of orange peal.  the steamed rice is firm not soggy.  The service is very friendly and attentive.  I just wished I would have asked about northern style dim sum as they may or may not still serve that on weekends.  So, for excellent Hunan cuisine at reasonable prices with friendly service in a casual atmosphere, Hunan Homes cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-14", "description": "I will begin by digressing into one of those moments of life where you sense a connection beyond tangible reality.  The year, 1996 and there was a charming elderly man who seemed to manage this restaurant (or at least the floor).  He often was at the door to great customers and he seemed to take particular joy out of the fact that I often poured gobs of their wonderful chili sauce onto the food on my plate.  One day, after eating, I got up to use the restroom before leaving.  Just as I was going down the stairs to the restroom, that man came over and said \"follow me.\"  So, he lead me on a tour of the upstairs rear banquet room and was proudly describing it to me and finally to a small toilet tucked away in some corner.  He waited and then lead me back to my table after I finished.  Since this was a regular lunch spot for me, I noticed for the next several weeks I didn't see the old man.  Finally, I asked a staff person what happened.  They said he had been diagnosed with late stage lung cancer and had quickly died (he used to smoke outside the restaurant).  I was immediately touched that I had been given a special farewell from that man and of course Hunan Home always has a special place in my heart ever since.\n\nOver the years, I have perceived changes in the food and ambience here and there, sometimes for the better sometimes not.  But overall, this is still one of the best choices in Chinatown and at this price level still worthy of five stars.\n\nEternal thanks to my little old friend for making Hunan Home a special place to me (now I need tissue to wipe away the tears).", "author": "Richard P."}

I just went there today for lunch since it's been four or five months that I went there.  Believe me I had tried many dishes before, but I felt like chow mein this time.  I ordered the combination chow mein which includes chicken, pork and shrimp.  First, I don't know if it's me or the plate of noodles seemed less than a year ago.  It was priced at about $6.95.  That's pretty expensive considering that I could've gotten a whole lot more at another restaurant for $5.00.  Then I could not find any shrimp in my chow mein.  I even showed the waiter and he said that he could take my dish back.  No way am I letting my dish out of sight.  When I was done and we received our check.  There was no deduction whatsoever on it.  I had to tell them that I shouldn't pay full price when I didn't have shrimp in it.  I usually don't complain but it's the principle of it.  So, they just deducted 50 cents off of it.  Oh come on, that noodles dish has to be cheap to make since it did not have very much meat in it.  I don't think I'll be back for a while.  It used to be so much friendlier too.  \n\nI still say that their hot and sour soup is the best in SF and their oranges are usually so sweet.  Their kungpao dishes are yummy and smoked pork too.", "author": "Lisa W."}

The restaurant had a nice cute mom and pop feel with pink table cloths and little crystal chandelliers. We were seated immediately, the service was very prompt and the wonton soup was DELISH! I was very pleased. When our moo shoo pork came, however, my husband was unpleasantly surprised by a one inch copper staple in his food... Luckily he didn't bite down on it too hard. We quietly pointed it out to one of the servers and they ended up taking it off of our bill in the end. Things like that can happen at any restaurant, and they handled the situation  well. The food (especially the soup) was very good, but honestly the flukey staple kinda dampered  the experience. I'm sure other visitors will love it though provided they font have a staple in their food, which I'm sure they won't. For the good food with good service at a good price, not considering the staple, I'm giving it 3 stars.", "author": "Tiffany O."}

In my opinion the quality of food and service is top notch especially when compared to the many other places I've been to in China Town. The location can be a slight problem if you cummute via public transportation but if you drive its actually conveniently close to an underground parking structure. The interior had been redone a few times since I first started going there but it has a nice big fish tank at the entrance with salt water fish and the tables are well placed with only the bathroom being a bit inconveniently placed downstairs opposite the kitchen. I highly recommend this place.", "author": "Richard N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-21", "description": "Based on Yelp we decided to try Hunan Homes.  We were not disappointed! We tried 3 dishes that many here at Yelp thought were outstanding. The hot/sour soup, moo-shu pork and the spicy, garlic eggplant.  All three were delicious! The hot/sour soup is exactly that.  What makes it different than other variations is that the soup is very hot (spicy) and very sour.  It may take a few tastes before you can appreciate/adjust to this significant difference with other reciepes.  The moo-shu was much better than most others. Not in the least bit greasy and discernable, dfferent flavors.  The eggplant was stupendous.  Perfectly cooked and again not greasy. Many times this dish is loaded with oil; not this one.  A couple of notes about customer service.  We had a reservation and arrived 10 minutes early but we were seated right away.  Also, the waitress forgot to add the two glasses of wine we had. I didn't pay any attention and paid the bill. She then told us we did have to pay which is of course, only fair. However, a gentleman that I took to be the owner said we didn't have to pay because it was their error.  How often does THAT happen!  I can't say enough good things about Hunan Homes.  We live in Marin and I only wish this restaurant was here because we don't get into the city too often.  Eat here without hesitation!", "author": "brian s."}

I was searching for a fri night (02/26/10) chinese restaurant in anticipation of our trip to SF for Chinese New Year... I knew we DIDN'T want to try to eat in chinatown on sat night, so we planned on fri instead... found a restaurants.com cert and then checked against the yelp reviews... I was uncertain based on some of the yelpers, but went ahead and booked... made reservations for 8.30 on fri... here's the weird thing: when we walked in, I realized it was the same place that we'd wandered into three years past - now if I'd TRIED, there's no way I could have known that... and if I'd needed to remember the place, it wouldn't have happened... fortunately, we'd very much enjoyed the meal previously and so I was confident we'd like it again...\n\nhere's what we ordered:\n- peking duck - very good!  crispy skin, moist meat, nice presentation\n- mu shu pork - nothing special\n- savory / succulent bread - we got the steamed and the fried... GOOD STUFF, but go for the fried!!! - but isn't that always the way??? fried is ALWAYS better :-)\n- spring rolls - decent, not the best ever... personally, I prefer the Vietnamese method of frying versus the Chinese - crispier and less greasy IMO\n- pot stickers - very tasty - nicely done\n- hot and sour soup - great sour flavor, not spicy enough\n- beef with green onion - good, but Ma's in Fullerton is better... tender beef w/ a good gravy.\n- orange chicken (I know, I know, how honky can we get??? but the 'rents INSIST on getting typical honky-chinese rather than enjoying something off the beaten path like chicken feet... what can I do?) which was not spectacular, but not bad either - just very safe...\n- spicy garlic chicken - again, we're white, so their 'spicy' is relative - I would have liked it spicier...\n- Eggplant w/ spicy garlic sauce w/ brown rice - great spicing, very tender\n- Prawns w/ honey walnut - NOT GOOD!!!! much too much mayo... again, Ma's in Fullerton is much better\n\nthis place did not disappoint and considering we were pleasantly surprised to have found a place we'd previously enjoyed... and with the $50 off cert, it was only $170 for seven people with a HUGE amount of food and multiple drinks (beers and wine).  Service was good once it got rolling, but it did take almost 20 minutes for our waters / tea to come out and for us to see a waiter to put our food order in.\n\nVERY glad I'd had the presence of mind to call in around noon-ish for a reservation as they were PACKED when we got there at 8.30!\n\nWe'd definitely come back next time we're in SF, which will be next May :-)", "author": "FOXWOOD F."}
