Firehouse uses cheapest ingredients plain and simple which is not hard to see. Crappy gas station-grade cheese which is anything but mozzarella that I requested and paid for. I've never seen rectangular-shaped slices of ham outside Food Bank and ... well my $30 pizza. I have no comments about the taste of dough or tomato paste because the base had no taste. Copious amounts of stuff that you don't really want in large quantities like olives or onions. Classic case of when you can't give them substance, dazzle them with bullshit. They manage to deliver cold pizza within 10 blocks. A dyslexic gent on the phone who wrote down both the order and the address wrong. Or delivery guy was knocking on a neighbor's door and had to return to the base. When he finally came back more than one hour after I placed the order, he managed to drop one of the pizzas at my feet. The remaining one was ice cold and had wrong ingredients and Firehouse makes it a point to cut a large pie into at least 20 pieces, making each slice barely an inch wide. This is just retarded. Who sells or eats pizza this way? Showering us with apologies, they offered to remake both pizzas. Another 45 minutes later, we got nasty yellow-colored circle masquerading as mozzarella cheese pizza AND the other in wrong size with the wrong ingredients once again.

The crust is paper thin and thickly coated with cornmeal.\n\nOther good things to note that had no effect on my rating: no indoor seating, a few cratchety small tables out front, long wait while they cook your pizza, priced similarly to chain pizza joints.\n\nNo pizza went to waste, hence the A-OK rating, but I will never return.", "author": "Brooke R."}

I was surprised and sad when I saw the shared surfaces and utensils...the pizza shouldn't be presented as gluten-free because it is no longer gluten-free once it hits that oven.

Tonight I ordered 2 pizzas online and I messed up the toppings, so I called them to fix my mistake. A nice gentleman answered the phone right away and made sure my pizzas were made to spec. He quoted a 45 minute wait, but they showed up early 30-some minutes later -- woohoo! The delivery man was polite and efficient. Now for the pizzas: They were YUM. My husband and I shared a gluten-free with pesto, sausage, and bell peppers....the crust was flavorful and crisp with a touch of chewiness, just the way I like. Our teen kids shared a regular sausage pizza and they finished it off within minutes - they described it as \"super tasty.\" I deducted one star only because both pizzas had a little too much cheese, and I find that whenever that happens the cheese layer turns into a solid mass that slides off the crust. But this is a common issue with delivered pizza, so no biggie. Overall, we had a lovely experience and will order from Firehouse again!", "author": "SfMom O."}

And it was quite a disappointment. Not enough of anything besides lettuce - hardly tasted the feta or olives and TOO much vinegar in their dressing. It overwhelmed the flavor I would have gotten from the miniscule amount of cheese in my salad. Thankfully I convinced someone to share the salad with me so that I could eat some of the pizza and get the vinegar taste out of my mouth. \n\nThe pizza - I snagged a piece from my freinds' large supreme pizza.

Although the crust is slightly burnt on the edges at times, the usually accompanying ashy overtone is minimal and not a noticeable detriment to taste.\n\nThe BBQ Chicken is highlighted by its carefully sweet and tangy sauce that does not grow wearisome with each passing bite. BBQ flavored pizzas elsewhere tend to gradually overwhelm the palate, clouding all other flavors. Firehouse's BBQ is consistently desirable, from whole pie to last bite.\n\nThe All Meat's star among plentiful candidates is the globular meatball that generously dots the pie landscape. Its meaty, firm texture provides distinction, whereas veggie-less pies elsewhere typically feature chunks of undifferentiable chunks of salty meat.\n\nThe largest pizza is only $23, but do note that it is smaller than XLs at other pizzerias. \n\nUnless you are willing to brave the chilling reign of Karl the Fog, be sure to order for pickup or delivery. There is only a four person counter inside and exposed, unlit seating around a few metal tables outside. If you have no other option, sit at the table closest to the heated vent, which will give temporary but likely, polluted relief from the San Francisco night.\n\nThere are also no drinks at Firehouse, but a convenient grocer neighbor should provide for your thirst.", "author": "Andrew M."}

Finally a solid good pizzeria has arrived: Firehouse has been opened for about 4wks now and are located on 22nd ave connected to the California market on the corner.

The pizza was delicious (even a day later, cold, still pretty good).  I'd also ordered a salad which was good except for the dressing.   There were a couple of warning signs -- I tried to order in-store for take out and was told it would be over an hour, even though they didn't appear to be busy (sure enough, I called from home a few minutes later and they said it would be 15 minutes!)  Secondly, when I called in an order for a Cobb salad, they insisted that it was not on the menu, even though it is literally the first thing on the chalk board menu in the store.  The food was good, though, so I decided to come back again.\n\nSecond order, not so good.  The salad was terrible - wilted romaine lettuce, smashed grape tomatoes.  They forgot a couple of the toppings that were to be included in the mixed salad.  I tried a different dressing this time, and it was horrible too.   The pizza was also not good this time; in fact it was terrible, and I ended up throwing most of it away.  Crust did not seem like it was freshly made, weird taste and texture.  Sauce was really bland.  Toppings were not fresh.  My second order was placed at lunch time, 30 minutes after they opened for the day, so it was really disappointing that everything... tasted not fresh, like it had been sitting around all day.\n\nNot sure I will be back again.", "author": "Heidi M."}

Well, they like the side of the transaction where they receive your money. Providing their side of the deal - not so much... Or they are simply so inept that they shouldn't have an \"open for business\" sign. Or worse, they simply don't care. With Firehouse, I lean towards the latter. They simply don't appear to care. They don't care about quality, service, their reputation, anything. We like to support local businesses, so we've given this place chance after chance after chance. And they've repeatedly slapped us in the face with terrible delivery times (exceeding 90 minutes), burnt crusts, missing toppings (including tomato sauce - seriously), under-cooked product, and destroyed deliveries (the pizza folded into a ball of mush all in one corner of the box - and they had the audacity to try pass it over to us). There is no respect here, and for the price it's insulting. I'd like to say, \"It's not you, it's us,\" but it is YOU.", "author": "Billy B."}

Jon W. and I were craving something quick and delicious after hitting the gym, so we decided to try out this new place.\n\nThe restaurant looks like it's connected to the Market on the corner and there was only 1 long table to eat at, and not much space left over if you wanted to eat there.  We were greeted by Luke, who was very nice and welcoming.  He gave us the lowdown what their focus is, which was to bring Connecticut style pizza with Chicago amounts of toppings.  Jon W. and I agreed on getting a Spicy bacon cheeseburger, which had Bacon (which makes everything better), jalapenos, ground beef, and cheddar, and a salad, and not long after we placed our order, Joe (or was it Luke?) informed us that they ran out of Salad, as well as a topping or two and asked us if it was ok to substitute the missing pizza topping for something else.  We ended up ordering breadsticks, and they offered garlic knots on the house, as well as 2 vouchers for a free Salad on our next visit.\n\nThey felt really bad that they couldn't fulfill our order, and I felt they made up for it, and then some.  Now, onto the good stuff: FOOD.  The pizza was amazing, and so were their garlic knots.  As with most foods, it was best enjoyed white hot, as the garlic buttery flavors explode with each bite, and the pizza was simply delicious.  The first thing that hit me after the initial bite was the cheese.  I swear, it tasted like they just broke open the packaging of it just for our pizza: it was so fresh and yummy.  The rest of the toppings were cooked well, seasoned well, and were abundant.  The crust was crisp and wasn't too airy or dense, and the pizza overall wasn't too greasy, as with the bread sticks and the garlic knots.\n\nHaving it located near my elementary school, which is also close to my work makes it ideal for a quick and convenient spot if I ever crave pizza or yummy garlic snacks.  Luke and Joe were both awesome and really earned my stamp of approval, which doesn't really exist, but if I could design one, it'd be like the ones Chinese artists use to finalize each piece of work, using an ivory stone dipped in red ink, with my chinese name and a big thumbs up carved into it.", "author": "Hube N."}

We were ready to pack up and leave the Outer Richmond due to it's lack of good pizza. Worst yet, the best of delivery options were terrified to drive into the fog.\n\nI noticed this unassuming little place the last time I bought groceries at 6001 Market (the place they share real estate with). I thought these guys are ballsy opening a pizza place a block away from the gourmet favorite Pizzetta! As for me, I like Pizzetta but I was looking for that pizza that you can have with beer and re-heat later.\n\nFirehouse delivered! We ordered the supreme and it was evenly layered with amounts of pepperoni and delicious sausage. The vegetables were still crunchy and not over cooked. We did the wax paper (the sheet under the pizza) test and were astonished that it was bone dry! At first bite the crunch of the crust reverberated through our apartment...perfect! As for the sauce, it was sweet and tangy in equal amounts with excellent body. It complimented everything rather than detracted like most pizzeria sauces.\n\nAs a special side note to this review I NEED to give a shout out to Firehouse's wedge salad. Sabrina is always ruining a great pizza night with the addition of a salad and I thought this night was to be no different. I was completely wrong! the wedge salad was excellent and I felt good about getting my veggies.\n\nLastly, the customer service was some of the best we've experienced in a while from phone call to pick up.

It was...okay. I want this place to succeed so I'm going to write review containing \"constructive criticism\" as opposed to my usual \"don't waste your time\" rant. I hope the owner reads these...they should.\n\nThe good stuff first. \n1. Great customer service - the kids working there are very courteous and nice. Rare really.\n2. Close to my place - big points\n3. It's attached to one of my favorite little neighborhood markets. Grab some good affordable wine while you wait for your pizza. \n3. Garlic knots were awesome! Very salty, garlicky, and delightfully crusty on the outside but doughy and soft on the inside. Perfect with some ranch dressing. These were so good in fact that I ate the left overs for breakfast this morning. \n4. Now for the pizza.. Nice thin crust (not too heavy) and crisp, great size options, great prices, and a really nice selection of sauces and toppings. \n\nNow the reason I only gave 3 stars. There really aren't a lot of things wrong, just one main thing that will keep me from going back. Drum roll please.... The Marinara Sauce. No bueno. Bland and flavorless. I found myself sprinkling salt on my pizza and I've never, ever had to do that. And that didn't even help, so I didn't eat any more of it. 2 slices was all I could manage and I got a small so the slices are tiny. The sauce is the base of the entire pizza, if it's bland and flavorless...so is the pizza. \n\nSo my recommendation is for the owner or pizza maker is to work on the sauce and I will consider coming back for another try. A little salt goes a long way people.. Oh one other thing, I ordered garlic on my pizza and didn't taste it all. Possibly they just forgot to put it on, but if that's not the case, they need to up the portion b/c I got nothin...", "author": "Brenna S."}

It's kind of sad though that my BF and I are just discovering this tiny place when we might be moving out of the area.  No doubt though, we'll be coming back for more each visit to the city.\n\nI definitely recommend the garlic knots!!!  They're out of this world and made with REAL fresh garlic.  They better be since they're in the back of a grocery store.  And their spicy hamburger pizza is fantastic!!  Everything is fresh and the guys cooking and ordering in the back are real nice!  However, I would only recommend take out or quick bite eatery.  The place is small and only seats about 4, but I like enjoying my pizza at home on the couch anyway!", "author": "Holly L."}

Tiny little spot, but they are attached to the store on the corner, so they can apparently bring you drinks and booze and what not if you order that. Unfortunately, the store closes around 8, so don't expect beverages with your order after that. Cool crew who delivers and makes the pizza fast, but the quality of the pizza itself was probably a 6/10 for me. That being said, I'd highly recommend the garlic knots! Overall, pretty solid.

I've been gawking at various restaurants on Yelp as I'm currently on a staycation and wanted to try some local eats. Fireside Pizzeria was one of those places. I finally got there the moment they opened and placed my order of a 12\" Supreme pizza. I patiently waited for 30 minutes and killed time by scrolling through the hunger-inducing pizza pics. After what seemed like an eternity, I peeled myself off my car seat and sprinted the 20 meters to the pizza place, the young man behind the counter was courteous and was slicing my pizza as I rolled right in. It looked delicious enough for me to devour right then and there. The pizza, that is, not the young man. Anyhoo, I paid for my $19 pizza, and sat my a** down at their outside seating area and dug right in. The appeal factor, well, it wasn't. It looked nowhere as gorgeous as the pics y'all been putting up and it was made with RED bell peppers, not the GREEN ones! Yet, I was hungry and my stomach was about to digest itself if I didn't shove  a slice of pizza down my throat. The first bite, tasted rotton, like  a moldy piece of bread drenched in detergent. I didn't think much of it at first as I was ravenous. The second slice tasted moldy-detergent as well. Then I tried a third slice: DITTO moldy-detergent taste! What gives?! I theorized I got a moldy pizza dough that got rolled with the young man's freshly laundered hands. Sigh, maybe, I shouldn't have been the first customer to order. Maybe the young man should've rinsed his hands more thouroghly and used fresh dough. Maybe, I should've just read the bad reviews. Maybe, I should stop looking at these damn pizza pics...", "author": "Anna D."}

The only con about the spicy bacon cheeseburger was that the spiceyness kinda numbed my mouth when I ate it so I couldn't experience all the flavors the entire time /: However, I did alternate with the veggie supreme so I got some relief while eating that! To be honest, I think I liked the veggie side more than the spicy cheeseburger! There was an abundance of veggies and the tomato sauce was delicious. The crust wasn't soggy and it was a little crunchy too! The only reason this review is 4 stars is because of the price and phone service.

We always create our own so I can't speak to the standard pizzas on their menu, but the overall quality is great. An extra large pizza (16\") is about 2 or 3 meals worth for 2 people, but could probably last longer if we didn't want to eat so much of it at once because it's so delicious! \n\nAs far as pizza style is concerned, they have a thin crust (something I usually avoid, but actually really like here) that's mostly chewy with some crunchy parts right around the edges. They have a thin to medium layer of cheese (unless you ask for extra) followed by a hefty serving of toppings. Their pizzas are definitely full to the brim and usually more with the meats and veggies than sauce or cheese. \n\nIf you're looking for recommendations on what to order, this is what we usually get (it's complicated and sounds a bit ridiculous, but it's really, really good): \n\n1/2 buffalo sauce with grilled chicken and smoked bacon\n1/2 tomato (or sometimes BBQ) sauce with sausage, pepperoni and salami\nand spinach, mushrooms, red onions, red peppers, and avocado on the whole thing.\n\nIt's usually around $30-$32 for an extra large (16\") including tax.  \n\nDefinitely worth trying and there's free delivery nearby on orders over $15.", "author": "Jamila B."}

We didn't eat the pizza and that rarely happens. Not sure what's going on??? I hope this crust is not here to stay.", "author": "Ashley F."}

Called to order pizza at noon - was told to call back in 10 minutes as the pizza maker was out on a delivery.  Called again at 12.15 and was told to call back in 10 more minutes as they were still out on a delivery.  Called again at 12.25 and was told \"sorry, we don't deliver\".  Asked to speak with the manager, a guy named Zack said \"i'm the only one working and its like raining outside\".  Are you serious?", "author": "Kevin F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-01-19", "description": "i've had firehouse twice. first time, pretty good. second time, not so good. i'll try one more time and make my final decision. but as it stands today 3/5. whiat i like is that the crust is like a round table crust; thin and buttery, and they mix 2 cheeses, chedder adn mozzarella- which i love. i asked for a garlic cheese pizza on this last order, the garlic was buried under the cheese and didn't cook, so each time i took a bite it was like taking a bite of little garlic nuggets, if it was on the top, it would have tasted more roasted and creamy. we also ordered the garlic knots which were delish, but they came with a side of COLD marinara sauce, which if you eat warm buttery garlic knots, you want to dip them in a warm marinara sauce, not marinara out of the fridge. with all that said, this place still deserves another chance.", "author": "SF Native M."}

By far the best pizza I've had in the city, and reasonably priced. Perfect addition to this part of the Richmond.

I mentioned to them that I had been put Xmas shopping all day and was very tired.  They handed me a take out menu and that they delivered.  Perfect is what I thought to myself!  I called in and ordered the Margherita pizza.  You simply can't go wrong with fresh basil, red sauce, mozzarella, cherry tomatoes and garlic.  Yum!  The garlic knots are really flavorful and tasty too.  I am so happy to have found this place and I wish them much success!", "author": "Rebecca S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-05-09", "description": "Had to change my review from a five star, great neighborhood pizza joint. It's gone downhill: they definitely use lower quality cheese than before and there's a lot of oil or something in crust to make it crispy. Plus, prices have gone up. Now, no better than average.", "author": "jeff w."}

I really liked the sauce and there were plenty of toppings.  After walking halfway home, it donned on me that I should have picked up some beer too since a grocery store is attached. Next time. The employees were really nice and I will definitely go back.  I can't imagine eating there though because the space is tiny and I'm not a fan of eating while sitting on a stool.  They deliver for orders over $15, which is a pretty reasonable price.", "author": "k h."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-30", "description": "A solid pizza joint...not trying to be any of those artisnal pizzas that have been sprouting everywhere, but more like a family style pizza that you'd expect from fast-food chains.  Reminds me of a better Round Table (and no, this is not a negative comment at all).   My only drawback would probably be its price, but it costs as much as Round Table without a coupon, so it still somewhat works out.  I would definitely come back when I am in the need for non-fancy pizza.", "author": "A W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-19", "description": "After having the gluten free pizza I was simi impressed... then I thought I would go out to try other pizza places. My conclusion, they have all sucked thus far. I am now very impressed by Firehouse! The crust is thin, and crunchy, the sauce is yummy and the cheese is always well balanced. Cons, its in high demand, making delivery take a while. I can't blame them though; the gluten free pizza is great! P.s. if you are dairy intolerant or allergic I hear they also have dairy free cheese. I am allergic to gluten, sad face, but I refuse to give up the small things in life. I need pizza and chocolate, among some other things... But this isn't the place for that. Did I mention that there is a mimi mart attached to this fine establishment? A.k.A you can pick up some wine or beer to go along with your dinner. Minimum delivery order is $15 so if you only get once gluten free pizza you may want to order a salad, heck why not order 2 pizzas? Bon app\u00e9tit!", "author": "Star Z."}
