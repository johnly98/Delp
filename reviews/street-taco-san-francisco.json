The street view of Street Taco is attractive, enticing even. It wears the promise of a really satisfying taco. \n\nThe interior is post-industrial faux-urban warehouse meets real taqueria (a self-consciously slightly grungified version of a Chipotle, if you will).  \n\nThe menu is brief, which I always appreciate, and straightforward.  The cashier was friendly and warm. The cooks in the cramped and too-close open kitchen were loud and somewhat surly, as if they were not aware they could be seen and heard by customers. \n\nWe ordered 4 tacos -- 3 carnitas and one al pastor -- along with a Street \"Caesar\" Salad (quotations are mine). \n\nNow I have lived in San Francisco more than 35 years. I love taquerias.  I love tacos.  I love San Francisco tacos. I have eaten hundreds -- probably thousands -- of tacos at taquerias in and around San Francisco as well as up and down the West Coast and throughout Mexico, New Mexico and Texas. \n\nI can without hesitation say that the tacos we had at at Street Taco were the worst I have ever had. The nice-looking homemade style corn tortillas were soggy, the texture of very wet cardboard.  The grayish meat had a similar texture. (The word \"mushy\" comes to mind.)  Topped with a paltry dollop of not super fresh Pico de Gallo, the flavors melded to create a taste that was vaguely reminiscent of... well, of nothing.  To say the taste was bland would be inaccurate because \"bland\" indicates the presence of at least some flavor, some taste.  These tacos were bizarrely virtually tasteless.  I mean I had to put salt on the tacos (on carnitas no less!) to sense any flavor.   \n\nNow the Street \"Caesar\" Salad-- well I'll admit the mistake was mine in ordering it.  Did I really expect a Caesar Salad? No. Did I expect something that at least attempted to mimic the basics of said salad?  Yes, I did.  And I was sorely disappointed.   But I'm tired of writing this review so suffice it to say it did not resemble the classic salad in any way and no part of it tasted really fresh. \n\nDid I mention the deeply malodorous street guy who came in, sat down at a recently vacated table and began to consume leftovers on said table?  Staff did nothing despite the fact that his presence -- more specifically it was the stench emanating from him, which caused eyes to water --caused everyone at each table around him to move or leave within  minutes of him sitting down. \n\nOh.

No grilled onions or limes, but the three salsas they have are incredible. Full disclosure: the salsa verde almost made me cry. it was even better than I thought possible. Be careful though, the salsas weren't labeled when I went, so if you don't like spice...go with a seasoned vet. The chunkier salsa to the left of the verde was pretty high on the spicy side. The chips are thick corn, very lightly salted-my ideal tortilla chip.

Very friendly bunch and it's a bustling business indeed.\nI mostly go when I get the coupon in the mail box for 2 tacos for $2.00 off. They are The Best Deal in town and prepared fresh. Tons of meat in each and you usually need a fork when it's all over and oh yeh, a few extra napkins.  The salsas on the side bar are all worth a dip as well.\n\nI have not tried anything else, as I can't get past the Tacos.\n\nA couple issues with this gem is the music (Spanish) is Way Too Loud and Not Necessary !  Sometimes the noise is almost unbearable. This even when the place is slow or packed, too much music !!!!\n\nThe clearing of tables is very, very slow and one often has to eat at a dirty table, covered in old used plates.  My suggestion, put some dish tray somewhere, where folks can dump their own plates. Too often I see \"many staff\" and \"managers\" just hanging back, watching the crowd when clearly \"someone\" can see the tables need to be bussed.", "author": "Marla B."}

It's a few blocks away from Milk Bar, with a conservative amount of seating inside. The room configuration is a little strange too. Standing in line and waiting for food can feel a bit cramped if you have a larger group, so grab seats right away if you plan to stay. Seems like it fills up very quickly. Fortunately, we got our food to-go and ate at Milk Bar.\n\nAltogether, our group ordered a variety of different things, though I settled for a carne asada street bowl. The menu is very straightforward, between the meat options and the way your tortilla wraps (or doesn't wrap) around the meat. The street bowl is served in a flour tostada bowl and it's surprisingly filling! I like the quality of the tostada bowl. Coming here is very cost-efficient as well for Mexican food.\n\nThough the food was quite tasty, I wouldn't go out of my way to come to the Haight and eat here, but if I was in the neighborhood and craving Mexican, Street Taco is the obvious choice.

That's a lot inside right? It is a really big portion, so the value is there for sure. In fact, I couldn't even finish it. Sad times.

Enter Street Taco, who slapped me right back down to earth some of the best authentic tacos I've had. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nI'll admit I was a bit skeptical when I walked through the doors of Street Taco. While the interior was nothing unlike what I commonly encounter back in Dallas, it all felt a bit strange strolling into an authentic Mexican taqueria in the midst of most groovy neighborhood in San Francisco. My hesitation was quickly washed away upon seeing the giant spinning spit full of pork and the other various meats being freshly prepared behind the counter. The process was simple: place your order at the counter, have a brief sit, and wait for your glorious meal to be procured at the counter. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\n\"$3.50 for a single taco? That seems a bit muc... Oh... oh my\"\n\nThis was pretty much my exact thought process as I watched the patrons in front of me get their order. Make no mistake - these tacos are absolutely massive. See that picture at the bottom of this review? Two tacos, although there may as well be four there. Considering the portion size and the menu breadth Street Tacos prices are nothing short of extraordinary given that this is San Francisco we're talking about, and value like that should be shouted from the mountain tops. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nOh yeah. I hinted as much in the beginning of this review, but these were some of the better authentic tacos I've had. Period. \n\nI opted for a steak taco and an al pastor taco, and my only regret was that I wasn't able to sample even more of the wonderful meats available at Street Taco. These were some of the freshest ingredients in the game, and they were served in generous quantities bundles together in freshly made tortillas. I'm usually not one for large quantities of salsa or cilantro, but both made the meats work all the more, and the aggregate flavor was excellent if I haven't already made that clear. Marvelous.

A lot of people order quesadillas too so gotta try that next time. \n\nThe place is a very casual and chill place to hangout with friends, family or your significant other.

After spending a morning walking around the eclectic shops on Haight St. I went into this taco shop for lunch. At first everything seemed a bit pricey ($7 for 2 tacos?!) but I soon found out why.\n\nThe place itself is pretty small so I could see how it can easily get overcrowded during lunch time, but they are pretty efficient in taking and getting your order to you. They offer tacos, burritos, and taco salads with tons of meat options (veggie options available too!). I ended up ordering a carne asada and al pastor taco. When I got my food I realized why it cost $7 and actually felt like it was a steal. This place does not skimp on the meat. I probably easily had 4-5 oz of meat on EACH taco! It was insane and it was a joke trying to actually fold the tortilla to eat them like a taco. \n\nOnto the taste. The carne asada was pretty good, but not the most flavorful I've had. The al pastor, on the other hand, was incredible. Extremely juicy and flavorful!\n\nI would definitely go back the next time I'm in that neighborhood!", "author": "Jimmy C."}

I've tried all the uber-hyped places in the Mission and I honestly prefer this place.  \n\nI'm taking away one star though because HOLY SHIT does the line here move slow. This place is a logistical clusterfuck. There is only one cash register, and I swear to god they are using some credit card processing system from the 1980s. It takes freaking forever to order, swipe your credit card, wait for it to process, sign it, and then return it. I've abandoned this place so many times because of the line. I swear their business would at least double if they invested in Square or some other processing system.\n\nAlso, you pick up the food at the register, so you have to constantly cut in and annoy everyone in line to get your food. \n\nFinally, I've literally been coming here 3-4 times per week for 2 years now (don't judge :P), and they still never say hi or acknowledge me.

My boyfriend, who has apparently been here before (good food without me?? D: ), recommended for me to try it. \n\nAs it is a relatively small restaurant, there are only ~7 choices, all pretty standard (tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc.). I decided on the Carnitas Super Burrito because I wanted to treat myself hehe. \n\nThe food itself is great, and the portions--amazing. I personally am not a fan of burritos because of the tortilla, but the ratio of insides to tortilla was soooo massive that I totally forgot about it. In addition, can we talk about the beautiful wrapping of this burrito??? The foil is so perfect I'm so in awe like what brand of foil does this place use?? I'm still baffled. \n\nIn another sense, the service was great. The service here at Street Taco is the kind that isn't super in your face (constantly asking questions and whatnot), but it isn't detached and indifferent. It's a nice happy middle that makes you feel like you were treated nicely, but not bothered. It was a refreshing change. \n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place to anybody.

I ordered a carnitas quesadilla the first time I came here. normally if I get Mexican food, I don't get quesadillas because that seems like a more conventional and boring option. But the carnitas quesadilla was phenomenal and totally something to rave about. Since then, I've also had their burritos and tacos and it's always excellent. It's true that the best Mexican food in SF is in the Mission, but this place is definitely worth a trip to the Haight!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-28", "description": "TL;DR: excellent tacos, boring burritos.  Eat tacos here.\n\nStreet Taco has had a sign up and paper in the windows for months now.  We all thought it was going to be a nonstarter.  But now it's finally open, and we got to try it out.  You could tell it was new; the staff were having trouble coordinating.  The owner and his father (or uncle) took our orders, which means they gave us free aquas frescas.\n\nNow, when the menu first went up I had to admit to some disappointment; it looked like every other darned taqueria in the city, including burritos and quesdillas and other San Francisco food. There were a lot of different tacos on the menu though.  Two for $7 or $9 if they're seafood, which people have complained about as expensive, but they're really not, especially considering what rents are like on Haight Street.\n\nSo we ordered six: one nopales, one fish, one shrimp, one grilled vegetables, and two carnitas.  First tip: each order is two tacos, but they can be two different ones.  Mix-and-match!\n\nWhen the tacos showed up, we realized that we'd ordered too much: these are huge.  My fish taco was an entire small tilapia fillet. The tortillas are the nice handmade-style ones, thick, scortched in places, and capable of standing up to the tacos' enormous payloads.  Each taco was simple, with only a few ingredients and some salsa, but well done.  Ratings per taco:\n\n* Fish: excellent\n* Shrimp: great\n* Roasted veggies: eh\n* Nopales: very good\n* Carnitas: OK\n\nSo, given the big menu of great tacos, why do they even serve burritos?  I'm not sure.  I guess the owner was worried that people would walk out if they couldn't get a burrito.  But you don't want the burritos;  they're the same steam-table stuffed tortillas served across the street.  Get tacos.\n\nAnyway, I'm really happy they're finally open and Street Taco adds a valuable new option to the Haight. They're like the cheaper, more accessible version of Padrecito a few blocks away.  They should have beer soon, which will make them even more fun.\n\nOh, and if the owner is reading this: please do a 3 for $10 taco plate (or $12 for seafood).  Two isn't quite enough and four is too many.   I'm stuffed.", "author": "Josh B."}

Street Taco has all the taqueria basics covered at a super reasonable price point ($7 for two tacos, $9 super burritos) with significantly higher quality ingredients and a more modern vibe than your average taco place.\n\nI've only been here once (this review was written on their second day of business).  I got two tacos: one carne asada and the other al pastor.  Both were super tasty and flavorful if a bit under-salted (I'll give them a pass on this since they were clearly still figuring some things out and they at least had salt and pepper on the tables).  The service was impressively fast for being as busy as they were, especially considering how new they are.\n\nAll-in-all this is a welcome addition to the hood.

I'm vegan so I ordered the regular burrito with grilled veggies and added guac. After waiting in line for 25 minutes to order and another 30 for our food I finally went up to the counter and checked on the status of our order. Apparently they called it out once and put it to the side because no one came (the restaurant was very loud). All of this was not that big of a deal but what got me was biting into my veggie burrito and finding myself chewing on a piece of chicken. It was only one piece but still it was there. I'm pretty upset that they could make such a mistake. They also left out the salsa that is suppose to come on the burrito and the guac (that I was charged for). The vegetables were overcooked and flavorless. Will not be coming back.

The Campenchana is where things get interesting. It's a mix of the carne asada and chorizo sausage. The slight hint of cinnamon makes this a special thing of beauty and my go to every time.

When I reached the front of the line to place my order, the cashier Maria seemed extremely annoyed by my special requests; no cheese, sour cream, or meat and extra beans, which doesn't seem too complicated to me. She even told me, \"don't you see we are busy, I don't have time for this!\" Mind you, there were about 6 people waiting in line. Since I live in the neighborhood and I like to spend my money at the local businesses, it blew my mind that she didn't have time for my business or money. She also looked extremely miserable as I encouraged her to smile a little. It saddens me to say but, I will not be returning to this establishment for any of my future burrito cravings.", "author": "Gianna B."}

There were 3 or 4 people in front of me in line, which moved quickly. You can see the open grill as you wait, so that kept me entertained.\n\nI soon received my burrito, which came with some tortilla chips, and headed over to eat in the park. I don't do any sort of fancy taste testing of ingredients, just chow down into the burrito and go from there. That's the point of it being wrapped up, I think. Anyways, this was excellent! The steak was perfectly seasoned for my tastes (and nice and tender), the guac tasted fresh, and the pinto beans were in the proper \"bean zone\" between mushy and firm. \n\nWhat really made it stand out was that the salsa actually had a decent spice to it, and there was just enough sour cream to complement that spice. Maybe it's because I'm a gringo or something but I usually finish most burritos wishing it had a bit more spice to it. This one hit the spot! \n\nFor $8, this is a solid lunch or dinner.

It's the Haight, how possibly could this be even considered authentic?  With a restaurant named Great Indian Food a block away, I couldn't help but be skeptical.  Plus there was cash only Zona Rosa, the surprisingly hated (but delicious) El Faro, and the hipster (overpriced) Padrecito on Cole and Carl-  the Mexican food scene has become crowded on upper Haight.  Couldn't they open up a decent burger joint, or maybe a sushi or Chinese restuarant?\n\nI came here on a whim to have a \"snack\" with my cousin to catch up.  Home made corn tortillas for the tacos at 7 bucks for two.  Crispy carnitas (GET CARNITAS) delicious yet not outrageously oily like other taquerias.  Carne Asada tacos and Nachos were massive.  Salsas served in small ramekins, friendly service, clean new spot.\n\nBrand new tables, service with a smile, big screen TV and homemade good-good.\n\nNot bad.  Now please, Haight street.

If I had to be more specific our rating would be somewhere between 3 and 4 but closer to 3. \n\nThe prices were a little high but considering the amount of meat you get it makes sense. They charge$7 for two tacos.\n\nCarnitas taco (5) - perfect. Delicious. Flavorful. An ample amount of meet. Actually all the tacos had plenty of meat in them.  For taste, this was my favorite. \n\nAl Pastor taco (3) - not bad. The meat was prepared in the traditional style on a verticle spit with a pineapple on top. The meet was sliced properly and achieved the perfect amount of carmelization. The only issue was flavor. Something was lacking in the spices. It was too bland. Having eaten these tacos in Merida, Yucatan and at an incredible taco truck in LA, this was nothing close to either of those locations. These are actually my favorite tacos on earth when done right. I was a little disappointed here. They weren't actually bad, just not great.  \n\nCarne Asada Tacos (3) - these were decent. Nothing spectacular but still good.\n\nMeatless Nachos (3) - these were pretty good but got soggy super fast. They said they use sour cream.  Not sure if that was just because they are used to people not knowing the difference between that and Mexican crema. The cheese was not the traditional one but also not that horrible yellow orange 'nacho cheese' sauce. The beans were great.  They give you three options on beans. My favorite will always be black. The girls prefer pinto/refried. \n\nHorchata (3.5)  - pretty good.\n\nCostilla taco (0) - we ordered this but it was missing from our order so we never got to try it. \n\nOverall if I am visiting San Francisco again I would not come here to eat. I would rather try another new place or a favorite location. If I lived here I might come back for the carnitas tacos.", "author": "Maureen T."}

I was never a fan of the other shops on the street, although Zona Rosa's quesadillas are alright. I was cautiously optimistic about this place, but now that I have been there five times in the last couple weeks, I can say this place has what it is I've been waiting for.\n\nThe tacos are $7 for 2 ($9 seafood), but they are quite large. I am a large man, so I still need 3 for dinner, but 2 is enough for lunch. I have tried most of the varieties, but I would recommend the Al Pastor, Pollo, and especially the Campechano (beef & chorizo). My lady and I usually go for one Al Pastor, one Campechano, then sometimes split a chicken quesadilla (excellent).\n\nBurritos are quite good, and I usually prefer burritos, but I actually prefer the tacos, quesadillas, and nachos. The tortillas and chips are super fresh and made in-store (I believe). The salsa bar is slightly lacking, but seeing as they actually put enough salsa on the food, you don't really need much outside of a bit for your chips.\n\nAs long as they can keep close to the current standard, I will be a loyal regular customer.", "author": "Nate P."}

Taqueria Cancun, El Burrito Express, Pancho Villa)   I've been to Street Taco a handful of times and have had various burritos with different meat options.\n\nThey don't make my favorite burrito in town but it's hard to complain about anything food-wise.  It's definitely a couple steps up from Zona Rosa, which is down the street, which I don't think is terrible but isn't anything better than average at best.  I think a lot of the mediocre places have decent options depending on what your preferences are.\n\nMy biggest complaint with Street Taco is the layout of the place.  The layout is a bit goofy.   The soda cooler makes it a little crowded and awkward to stand in line. Everyone seems to be in each other's way.\n\nThe prices aren't cheap either but I realize that the landlord probably creates a pretty good overhead on the place.", "author": "Chris S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-12", "description": "tl;dr: Try it. Seriously.\n\nThe place and ambiance: Went there on a quiet sunday night. The place was well lit. There's a counter adorned with cheerful colors, some pretty newspapery letters and clich\u00e9 - but none the less particularly appropriate - SF phrases. On top of this little waist high fort, there's a plastic pane that let's the cooks' cheerful but quiet interaction shine through. One of the cooks and the guy on the register were having same the kind of conversation I would have with a friend of mine and wouldn't be able to post here. One slight smile of mine suspends into their conversation, blatantly pointing out they have been understood unwillingly. The cashier draws an awkward smile, and beckons my order with a nod. \"Street bowl with chicken allambra\". \"Spicy?\" While I wobble my indecisive gnarl, he friendly encourages me to make it so. I feared a bit that the spiciness would show me what's proper mexican, and to keep out of other people's conversation. I mindlessly pay and turn around to find seating. There's a lot of open tables, clearly resting from earlier bustlier hours. I pick the closest one and proceed to appreciate even more appropriate but clich\u00e9 decorations. 10 languid minutes go by as I, yet again, get lost in their entertained conversations.\n\nThe food: The bowl is edible! :D Light and fluffy fried dough, reminiscent of filo. Very well composed and plentiful filling. Very much on the same league as El Farolito (the sober one, at least). I wished I had been man enough to go for a burrito.\n\nAfter match: I did not poop fire. I think I'm yet to learn my lessons. Will listen to more conversations.
