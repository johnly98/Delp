They gave us paneer tikka masala instead of butter chicken, then told us they would redo it, and asked if chicken tikka masala was okay.  I said I wanted butter chicken, the guy straight up lied to my face and told me butter chicken (makhani) and tikka masala were the same thing.  I know they aren't, I go to your restaurant twice a week.  I know what the hell butter chicken is, and it's not tikka masala.\n\nAlso, our 5 garlic naans were all missing garlic.\n\nPlease do better next time.

The kabob was also bland but I fixed that by dousing it with chimichurri that green sauce. As for the naan it's was fluffy and soft.

I thought it was quite tasty. Great taste and lots of sauce in this dish. \nCHICKEN ACHAR: this has always been my go to dish whenever I come here. Has a perfect amount of spicyness to it which I absolutely love. Had peppers and chilis inside too. If you like spicy, I recommend this hands down!!\nGARLIC NAN: This is a definite must when you come here. Pairs with the chicken perfectly and has great taste! \nBASMATI RICE: Huge serving of rice enough for 2-3 people. Perfectly cooked. I also recommend getting the green sauce in the fridge. It's pretty tasty and has a little spice to it as well. \n\nSERVICE:\nService was super easy. It is pretty much self serve for water and sauce. It's always busy during night time so I recommend getting there a little earlier. The guys at the register were pretty nice as well. They do have a TV but they only play YouTube videos from it.

Business must be popping!\n\nMost people coming to Pakwan seem to be regulars who know what they want. They just went up the cashier and ordered, or they had called in for take-away. Instead, I grabbed a menu from the counter and my eyes quickly scanned for any sign of a lamb curry. Ah, yes. Achar Gosht is what I was looking for.\n\nMy friend and I took our \"buzzers\" and found seats in the back of the restaurant. Eventually we were summoned to pick up our food.

It was also nice that the restaurant was spaced out enough between tables that the noise level wasn't outrageously loud. The smell of spices while sitting inside the restaurant really did whet the appetite.\n\nI'm sure the restaurant makes fairly authentic Pakistani/Indian dishes, but I found the naan and chicken tikka masala to be a bit too dry to my liking (or maybe I'm used to a more Americanized version of both?). I liked the smoky flavor that was in the tikka masala, I had never had a tikka masala flavored quite like that and wonder if it's the Pakistani take on the traditionally Indian dish. The garlic naan was nice and subtly flavored, as I'm not a huge fan of strong garlic flavors.

On the way back to my table I notice a station with my missing necessities, including some mostly clean glasses positioned lip down on a wood shelf.

The staff was super rude and shoved a menu at us. When we decided to order and fork up our money, that was the only time I saw a tiny smile... After you order, you basically serve yourself - get your own food, utensils, plates, etc. \n\nPrice: 1/5 - In my opinion, this place is expensive compared to Indian food in Los Angeles. It probably has to do with the high cost of rent, I hope. BUT, if I'm going to serve myself, it's basically considered fast food, so why is it so expensive?? :( \n\nFood - 1/5 - The flavors just taste off. I'm not sure how to explain it, but it doesn't taste the same as your typical Indian food. We ordered: \n1. Chicken Tikka Masala - 1/5 - How can you mess up on this at an Indian Restaurant? Chicken was kind of dry and the flavor was weird. That ain't good. \n2. Rice - Typical rice. I'm shocked that we had to pay extra for rice. Why doesn't it come with the Tikka Masala?? That doesn't seem right to me. \n3. Bengan Bhartha - 1/5 - I didn't expect it to be like a soup consistency. I thought there would be some chunks of eggplant in there. This dish was way too oily and spicy for me. Probably should give it a 0/5, but it has some flavor, so that's the 1/5. \n\nPortions look small but they are deceiving.

This review is only for the food I picked up- The chicken was just okay. It did not seem like the chicken was marinated for long enough as the flavors did not seep in to the chicken. I will have to try other dishes to see if my opinion about the food changes.\n\nAppending my latest review to the old one-\nCame back to eat in. Ordered goat curry, garlic naan, tandoori leg and spinach daal. Everything was pretty good. Changing my rating to 4 stars. The food was flavorful, it had raw spices which were distinct for each dish, so every dish did not taste the same. Naan was pretty damn good.

I really wish I had liked it more as it's so convenient but I probably won't eat here again as my favourite Indian dishes weren't the best here. \n\nI ordered the butter chicken, saag paneer, naan, raita and the rice. Butter chicken - really doesn't taste anything like butter chicken so I do not recommend anyone order this - maybe go with the Chicken Tikka instead. Saag paneer - this was actually good and I'd eat it again but be warned, it's much oilier than normal Saag Paneer. The naan and the rice were good (bit hard to mess those up) and the raita was on the sweet side but still good. I am Indian so I have eaten a lot of Indian food, my standards are quite high so if you're looking for mediocre & quick Indian food, eat here but if you want awesome Indian food, go somewhere else.", "author": "Mira B."}

The chicken tikka masala came with white meat chicken, which came out somewhat dry, and the curry wasn't particularly heavily spiced. The tandoori chicken leg and goat biryani were nice, but perhaps nothing to write home about. We also had garlic naan and the naan stuffed with ground beef on the side, but both of them seemed a little bit dry and not all too fresh.

Instead we were thrown a menu as the man at the counter was clearly impatient waiting for us to decide. He was standing there with a scowling face, fiddling with a pile of receipts as if he was playing with a deck of cards. We ended up ordering the chicken tikka masala, bengan bhartha, and 2 servings of rice. The total should have come to roughly $18 after tax, but we were charged $24 and weren't even handed a receipt. SCAMMERS!!!! I didn't think about the total till it was too late...\n\nFood -\nAt the time, it wasn't that bad but after discovering that I was over charged for some unknown reason I rather have drank sewage water from the street. At least I know what to expect. The curry's spices were complicated. I wasn't sure what I was eating. The chicken was very tough and dry and the bengan bhartha, which claimed to contain eggplant, didn't have any eggplant at all. What in the f were we paying for!?!?!? On top of that, we were responsible to grab our own drinks, utensils, and plates.\n\nOverall - \nHate is a pretty strong word so I'm gonna use \"despise\" instead, because hate is not expressive enough to describe how much this place infuriates me.

They were both terrible. The gravy was clearly frozen and reheated from an old batch and had no flavor whatsoever. The chicken and paneer were both overcooked and dry, again, frozen.\n\nDaal: Tasted ok but was undercooked\n\nNaans: Plain and Garlic naans were all undercooked and too fluffy. They lacked those slight crisp burnt bits that bring out the tandoori flavor. The Onion naan on the over hand was burnt completely black.\n\nVeg/Lamb Biryani: Ordered both. They were very greasy but tasted ok. There was a generous portion of lamb(you guessed it, frozen) and veggies in the respective biryanis and they held the flavor from the whole spices pretty well.\n\nOverall the food was barely average, the service was extremely slow and the ambiance is not one you would want to frequent.

There was no table service, but everyone we interacted with was friendly and competent.\n\nWe had dinner family style, ordering a nice spread that set us back something like $11 a person (though I spent a little extra to split a $3 mango lassi for dessert). The food was great. I loved the goat curry, which came with fall-off-the-bone tender goat meat in a flavorful, stewy, tomato-tinged curry. The butter chicken was lovely, with a thick, velvety sauce that was took well to a garlic nan sop. Everything else was vegetarian, and all quite good. The vegetable curry was loaded with a nice mix of vegetables--cauliflower, potato, green beans, carrots--cooked to just the right texture. The saag paneer was a decent version of the standard, and I liked the fluffy vegetable biryani. The only thing I was kind of meh on was the channa masala. I found it vaguely bland and mushy. The mango lassi was delicious, not too sweet and definitely made with some fresh, wonderful mango.\n\nI wouldn't say Pakwan is the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to or anything, but it's pretty great and its convenience and BYOB policy make it even better.

You don't go here for the ambience or decor, only for the kicking ass food. The prices seriously could not get any lower--how do they even make a profit? Did I mention their tandoori stuff? The chicken is making me salivate--super moist and tender, flavored well. Could not love this place more than  I do.", "author": "Ranjan P."}

Where have you been all my life, Pakwan??!!! You're magic. Everything from the curry, biryani and kabobs to BYOB liquor rule. You simply rock!!\n\nCame to this buzzy busy crowded place on a Saturday night after a full day of wine tasting/ drinking. My stomach was screaming for carbs & spice!! Every single table was filled. My gf and I waited/scouted for about 10 minutes for a table and jumped at the first one. Did I mention this place is self-serve?? It is kind of overwhelming walking in but getting the table first was a much smarter move. Let me explain.\n\nAmbiance- \nSelf-serve place with massive kitchen, cooks busting out dishes left and right. They call your number, you go get your food. So you definitely need to have a table especially if you want to order many dishes like me. It is a chill yet a super crowded  with lots of hipsters and few older people in between. The menus are at the counter- it's cash only! And you get to bring whatever liquor you want to drink. How cool is this???!!\n\nFood-\nLet's move on to the food. Hmmm Mmmm.There may or may not have been a vegetarian section on the menu but seriously? Who'd look at it when you have so many amazing meat choices. \nThey have kebobs, chicken /beef/lamb curries, biryanis (chicken, mutton) and $1 chai!! Zomg. So many to choose. It is also a mixture of North Indian and South Indian food. Talk about the best of both world. Luckily, I came with indian peeps! And we all have similar taste. We got\n1. Seekh Kabobs\n2. Nihari with lamb\n3. Spicy chicken curry ( forgot the name)\n4. Mutton biryani\n5. Lamb biryani\n6. Naans , chai and loads of peppers on the side!\n\nAnd we patiently waited for our food for a whole 7 minutes?? We went and got ourselves plates, silverware and water.And the our food was ready. Let the feast begin...Zomg zomg!\n\n1. Biryani - it was so well spiced! So tasty and spicy!! Two non indians including me tolerated that spice really well, if not loved it. So gooooood!\n\n2. Kabobs- nicely spiced. Tasty with loads of fresh onions and jalapenos.\n3. Chicken curry  - with jalapenos and fresh ginger slices on top. This was probably the spiciest dish we had on the table.\n4. Nihari with lamb shank- yummmm! This one came with a huge lamb shank. Again, so well spiced that curry is. Nice, thick, tasty with a kick. \n\nThe four of us happily devoured our food! Various spices in their food opened our sinuses, taste buds and it hit about 6 if not all 7 taste profile. Turns out, 5 dishes were way too much for us. The portions were nice and big. And the best part- they were all around $9-$11 per entree. Did I mention how tasty each one of those dishes were??  I mean, wow! I'd probably skip the super spicy chicken next time. Or try a dish chicken dish but the rest were totally point on and mind blowing. That biryani man...Mmmm. Totally soaked up my countless glasses of wine consumption!\n\nDid I mention that they give you a pile of peppers with every dish? It's like an added bonus heat to already nicely spiced dishes. Yes, SF has so many Indian restaurants and yes, you can find amazing biryani else where.  But this place offers a combination of dishes you wouldn't normally find in one place. The ambiance was totally relax and fun. Food was fantastic. What else can you ask for? Well except for more food!!  I wish they would fed-ex me some right now.

I spent years going to Naan n Curry or other barely decent Indian food restaurants just looking for the best kinds of Indian food. Luckily i found it in Pakwan on Guerrero street. Pakwan has the best versions of Indian foods that I've had. All the flavors combine well with the spices (which very depending on how you like it) and all the different ingredients pack a punch. \n\nWhen you walk-in you're always greeted with a pleasant hello from the staff working the register, and that's also where you order you're food from. They finally added the ability to pay with debit/ credit card which makes things so much easier because it used to be a cash only establishment. After ordering, you're utensils, dishes and water are all self serve and are located by the soda machine. The portions are always plentiful so you will never leave hungry. \n\nSome of my favorite choices here are the: chicken tikka Masala, biryanies rices, kebabs and desserts. \n\nFirst, the chicken tikka masala it has the perfect balance of creamy sauce and tender chicken.\n\nThe chicken or lamb Biryanies (you can't go wrong) served with basmati rice and tons of other ingredients that would take to long to remember. But it's oh so good.\n\nThe tandoori BBQ kebabs come in beef or chicken varieties. Generally great just cooked right (might find some burnt ends so be aware) but very addicting. \n\nFinally the Mango lassi is another. All I can say is simply try it and you'll love it. Might be a bit sweet for some but that's where sharing is caring comes to mind.\n\nYou honestly can't go wrong with anything off the menu from the varieties of Nan and biryanies to the tasty desert options. Even writing this review makes me wanna go there right now and grab a bite. With this good food you can't go wrong.", "author": "Donald W."}

I ordered the chicken biryani and the aloo palak. The plate of chicken biryani was a mountain of rice, enough to properly feed one hungry person.

This should be everyone's staple for fast casual Indian food. You order at the register and then find yourself a table. The silverware, plates, and water are self serve. If you pay for the Chai tea it has free refills (just as naan n curry does). I like that the portions match the price. This is no buffet, but you will be happily full. I mean, sometimes you want to eat garlic naan until you are sweating garlic, but sometimes you just want satisfying Indian food. Pakwan fulfills the latter. \n\nA few of the dishes I've tried:\nChicken tikka masala-- my go to dish. Lived up to my tikka masala taste buds. I love the balance of buttery creaminess and acid and spice in a good tikka masala that is different to other curries. \n\nSpicy goat special-- Spice warning! This was one of those dishes you keep eating and then keep complaining your mouth is on fire. Goat was cooked just right. Next time I'll ask if they can knock the spice level down a touch. \n\nBengan Bhartha (eggplant)-- this dish wasn't my favorite. The texture was a bit mushy and the flavors lost. Not for my taste. \n\nGarlic naan--I want one all to myself. Why is naan so good? Obviously essential for dipping into your main dishes.\n\nChai tea-- For $1, worth it. This is not that starbucks chai stuff, this is the good stuff.\n\nMango lassi-- I'm not a big mango lassi fan because I think it is served too sweet and the same holds true here. But the bf liked it. \n\nYes, parking sucks because it is in the mission. As for a wait, both times I came for lunch and there were plenty of tables open. I can't speak to the dinner rush.

I'm surprised at the thousand odd reviews that still find considerable merit in the restaurant's food, but expect that the low price points, generous servings, BYOB, and the hipster central Mission location, have a lot to do with that. \n\nIf the major problem diners have is with the confusing, token based ordering system (and more importantly when to pick up your food), then the restaurant can continue to rake in money. Is it too much to expect from the \"aspiring artists\" to complain about tables not getting cleaned between seatings? Or, does that not even register in their stream of consciousness???\n\nFans of Pakistani food can do better by making their way instead to Tenderloin and dining at the reliably consistent Shalimar, though it too follows the same ancient, Indus valley civilization era model for roadside dining: cheap food, generous servings - service, ambiance, and cleanliness be damned!!!", "author": "Atif I."}

Ah I love the smoky charcoal taste it gives off when you first bite into a piece of this delicious chicken. The lemon that accompanies it is so refreshing and gives the Chicken Boti a little bit of a tangy kick. I highly recommend this dish!\n\nGarlic Nan - The Garlic Nan is always piping hot! There's a very subtle garlic flavor, so don't expect garlic breath after you eat this meal. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala - I love chicken tikka masala and Pakwan has one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala's I've ever had! Again, it's goes perfectly with the Garlic Nan and is very flavorful.\n\nMango Lassi - I wish they had bigger cups! The mango lassi I had was sweet, creamy, and very good. My only gripe is that the mango lassi was not cold enough.\n\nBoth of the times I've been here, the total exceeded more than $20 which is honestly not that bad.

Good thing its a BYOB, and its cheap. The Naan bread was fluffy and tasty. Too bad we didnt get aloo peas also :)\n\nThe fact is also that we got turned off by the place. The washrooms were awful, but when I say awful, I mean it. Not worse than an old gas station in the middle of nowhere. The difference being, people are eat to eat, so attention should be drawn to this ASAP. I even saw the pregnant lady sitting next to us going to the bathroom and returning with a ghostly face, telling her husband they had to leave NOW. so they take their order and left.\n\nAlso, you need to know there is no service. You call out the order at the counter, you pay (cash only), you have to take your own dishes to your table, grab glasses and utensils  (I guess bringing beer would be better since you get to drink wine in water glasses, not too fancy.) and you got to run after the openers. Once your order is ready, they call out your number and you gotta go to the counter and bring back the dishes to your table. Attention, we went on a tuesday and it was SO full and SO loud, we couldnt even hear ourselves. So if you like tranquillity, it is not a place for you. \n\nI guess in that case, since the food was good, id simply order a take out.", "author": "Sarah M."}

All the dishes were delicious and we were stuffed to a point where we could barely breathe. It was so good that even though we were full we still wanted to eat more! lol.

After hearing my NorCal friend rave about this place, I had to try it for myself and I'm glad it met and surpassed my expectations. It was the first on my SF food destination list and I made sure it would hold its spot. My sister and I ordered the garlic naan, lamb biryani, and chicken tikka. I wish the naan had more flavor but as far as texture goes, it was super fluffy, dense and warm. It paired greatly with the chicken tikka which was an explosion of delicious flavor. The chicken could've been a bit more tender but the dish was still good overall. The lamb biryani came out on a huge plate and could've served 4-5 people. The lamb was super tender and flavorful. Gotta love crazy big portions for reasonable prices! I love that Pakwan is a casual, seat-yourself get-yourself type of place. It definitely makes the place more home-y, in my opinion.

Sure there are better, newer, more expensive clothes available for you to buy; but every so often you want to go back and enjoy that old, familiar comfort.\n\nFood - good\nI grew up in Asia, albeit not in the sub-continent, but appreciate strong spices.  The food at Pakwan is nicely spiced, always consistent, and in general tasty.  We like the saag, the chicken tikka and the yellow lentils.  I would rate their food as one of the 'best in their price category'.\n\nService - very good\nThis is a minimum service restaurant.  You order and pick up your food at the counter.  Water pitchers are available for customers in their fridge.  The two things I like about their service are (1) food comes out quickly, and in reasonable time even during dinner rush hours; and (2) you can bring your own beer.  There's a liquor shop across the street and typically we just go over there to get a six pack.\nAlso, if you come here after the dinner rush hour they will let you hang out and stay as long as you want.  The restaurant is cash only, but that shouldn't be a big issue as there are ATM's along 16th st.\n\nPrice - very good\nAverage entree costs about $8-$9.  Definitely a great value for your money.\n\nAtmosphere - casual\nIt's too casual to say bring in clients to impress them, but since it's at the heart of the mission it's actually pretty lively and hip.\n\nOverall - this is a good restaurant.

I was well on my way to starring in The Hangover 3, complete with monkey, face tattoo & uncomfortable male nudity. I needed something the soak up the booze and rescue me from a weekend of pain. Enter Pakwan. I am always on the lookout for good Indian food. In my experience in Chicago, however, that can only be found in one part of town I don't frequent (shame on me). So, remembering that SF opened my eyes to delicious South Indian food, it made perfect sense that I should get a double dose of Pakistani/Indian excellence.\n\nI did.\n\nFirst off, the place was crazy packed. My suggestion, find a table and start either hovering or leering. I may have been drooling as well. I don't know. I'm telling you, evil liquor was ravaging my system. After scaring away a table of hipsters, my crew sat down (dirty dishes and all) and began a plan on attack. I told my friend what I requested for foodstuff and continued to tell him even as he was in line for our food. I may have been screaming. Again, blame it on the alcohol. \n\nHe paid and then the magic screen flashed our order. Magic! Two biryanies, 4 samosas, 1 saag paneer, a few naans (garlic for me; thanks to the bellow), basmati rice, cholay, & achar later, I started feeling as though I was going to make it after all. My slumped over posture resumed its usual bent over Mr. Burns hump. My cross-eyes resumed beadiness and my slurred speech resumed its acidity. Back to normal, I demanded sweet treats. Luckily, we were in The Mission and Bi-Rite was just down the way. \n\nEven better, across the street is a liquor store to keep the party going AND it's stocked with coconut water which helped save me from that aforementioned hangover.

And Pakwan just went down from the usual 5 stars in my book to 2. And, this review is based on 2 recent visits, so it cannot be blamed on just a \"one night off\" kinda event. The awesome soft perfectly cooked naans were overcooked, cold and brittle - you'd be better off picking up frozen naans from trader joes. The lamb chops were dry and rubbery, looks like this weeks Australian lamb was flown in without any refrigeration. The daal lacked consistency and was watery. The Bihari boti had lost it's awesome seasoning, and there were no onions on the side. \n\nLastly, I would give it 1 star, but their biryani was still passable.

Their mango lassi goes so well with the spicy food.

They're really fast, no waiter service so no tip needed. Just go up to the cashier, tell them your order, pay, and wait for them to call your number.  Your number will also show up on the tv's they have up in the restaurant.  \n\nWhat else?\nThey have fridges full of carafes of water, salsa and mango lassi and you help yourself (you have to pay for the lassi).  The cups, utensils, plates and napkins are all above the water so you just help yourself to that as well.  That's why the prices are so cheap.  \n\nParking?\nYou can find street parking here if you come early.  Otherwise, bart to the mission or cab here.\n\n I cannot reiterate how good the food is here.

I was eating tikka masala there one day, when I bit into something that had an odd texture and a really odd taste. It was so odd that I took it out of my mouth and put it on my plate for further inspection. Looking at it was a mistake.  Prodding it with my knife was an even bigger one. I grew up in FL, home to large beetles and palmetto bugs. That's relevant to the story.\n\nI was pretty sure I just chewed on a big bug and I was starting to freak out. I was dining with the Captain who was trying to convince me that it wasn't a bug, but he's saying it in the same tone that he uses to tell me that I'm just hearing things and that there's no one outside the window at night.  He's not really sure that there isn't, but he's sure enough and he's positive that he doesn't want to go outside and look.  He says that it's just something that got stuck to the bottom of the pot and burned. I'm not convinced. This goes back and forth for awhile and I've stopped eating my lunch.  That's when he reached over, picked it up from my plate and ate it. \"Mmmm...good...see, it's not a bug.\"  If we were in Uganda, he'd be eating grasshoppers with the natives. But we're not. I continue to weigh the situation.  \n\nMy first conclusion is \"Aww, he loves me so much, that he doesn't want me to be traumatized by the possibility of having just eaten a bug.\" My final conclusion is \"He loves Pakwan so much that, even if it were a bug, he wants to hedge against future objections to eating at Pakwan.\"  If I'd written this when it happened a year ago I would have said, \"Pakwan is so great that even if there's a bug in my food every once in awhile, I'd still go back.\"  That's love! Pakwan, however, might not have agreed and I still wanted to go back, so I didn't write it.\n\nA few weeks ago I learned about a large spice called cardamom which has tough, thick skin and is shaped kind of like a large pod.  It's used in tikka masala and, when roasted until it's black, can look kind of like... a big bug. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, Pakwan.", "author": "P J."}

The Chicken Tikka Massala tasted less creamy/spicy and more tomato-y (hope that makes sense). The Beef Kabab was my favorite, for it was very tender and tasty.

Anyway, take note.\n\nAlso, I have no idea why...the place was incredibly smoky (not like cigarettes, but like fire) when we first entered.  It cleared up by the time we left.", "author": "cyndi t."}

The food is always great.\n\nFavorite Dishes: Paneer Makahni; Vegetable Biryani; Garlic Naan; Vegetable Pakora \n\nTip: there is a very big difference between very very very spicy and \"Indian\" spicy. If you aren't Indian and you really want to that oh-so-good-burn of your insides, ask for Indian Spicy and tell the man you are serious (with a smile of course) and make sure he looks you in the eye and acknowledges your masochistic request AND assure him you won't send it back.  Once you have both agreed on these terms, enjoy a fiery dish of exploding flavor and spice. Raita, mango lassi, or beer helps.\n\nPros: Indian Spicy is still totally edible. You can bring outside beers (there is a liquor store across the street. goes well with the meal). Price is good.\n\nCons: no delivery, cash only (ATM is right next door)", "author": "Anna H."}

I drove all the way up from MV because I was craving Nihari, and this place kind of does the job. But, they were all out. So, I had a whole sample set to replace it. Well ....  The chicken Haleem was tasteless, a pur\u00e9e of unappetizing lentils. I ordered a chicken tikka, but was given chicken tikka masala instead; your average sweetened up pseudo Indian curry, not impressed. I peered over at other folks with their chicken tikkas, and realized I wasn't missing much: plain red chicken legs, no BBQ scorch marks, no dripping succulence, no orange spices. The seekh kabab was not acceptable: over salted and under spiced. Which finally brings me to the tikka boti, beef. Was it simply amazing?  Did it like totally save the day?  Was my journey up 280N totally so worth it?  No. I felt like puking. Average, average, below average, what the hell is this, how drunk are people when they eat here...?  I wanted to give it one star, but the cashier was nice so, here you go, two stars. Begrudgingly. Because I am way too generous. If you are curious about good Pakistani food, I would suggest you venture all the way down to Santa Clara to a place with the initials K&C. No, not kfc... It's the best Pakistani restaurant in the entire Bay Area, by far, with the typical menu set.

This came out to roughly 21 dollars - a huge round up for two girls and 20 bucks i'd say.\n\nSamosas - I ordered this because I've had a pretty good experience in the past with samosas and she's never tried it. it was good but it wasn't out of the world/didn't impress her much\n\nNaan - the garlic naan was not as fluffy and as enjoyable as other garlic naans that I've tried before. But let's be honest, naan is naan is carb is delicious. So not much complaints here.\n\nVeggie Curry - This I thought was one of the better dishes despite being a bit spicy. There were carrots and potatoes and what nots that were cooked perfectly!\n\nChicken Tiki Marsala - This was not as good as I had hoped for. Everyone on yelp talked about it but the chicken was dry!

The Saag Paneer (my fave) was delicious and we also had butter chicken, yum!  Chai tea was very good as well and only $1 w/ free refills.  It did get crowded after about 7 pm so get there early.

Seemed to be a lot of chefs in the kitchen, and not many customers, but gave it a go anyway - dining options in SF get pretty limited after 9.  \n\nOn the advice of the cashier, we ordered the goat curry, which had a good, distinct  goaty flavor but far too spicy for me; and the chicken tikki masala - perfect chunks of chicken in creamy masala sauce = delicious.  The naan was quite fresh, straight out of the oven.  I would come back just for the masala; though, I might try the tandoori chicken as well -- I could smell those tandoori spices from across the room.  Not much for waiter service here; we had to fetch our own water from the beverage fridge.  But I didn't mind, as I knew I'd need a lot of cold water to quench the spiciness.

The tikka masala was okay, nothing special, more tomatoey than spicey, the chicken way WAAAAAAY overcooked, the place felt way more fast food than what I was expecting but maybe that's my fault. The naan was pretty tasty, so was the lassi. Service surprised me - my boyfriend and I were mortified to discover we were a couple bucks short when we ordered but the guy told us to pay him when we could, so we had time to scrounge through our bags and find the errant dollars we needed. A little above and beyond the call of duty there. The last star is mostly for that guy and his general super friendliness. But the food was pretty disappointing.", "author": "Jessica W."}

The masala was quite good though, with rich spices and a good creamy balance, so helped mask the meat.\n\nTandoori Lamb Chops: Too tough.  Seemed more like old mutton rather than young lamb.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-10", "description": "The number one reason for coming to Pakwan is the food.\n\nThat sounds a bit of a foregone conclusion but there really aren't any gimmicks here.  Just plain awesome food that will have you wolfing it down and stopping only when it's too late.  And by too late I mean you're full to the brim and ready for a Thanksgiving style food coma.\n\nFor starters, pick your time wisely and make sure you've got cash.  This place can get nutty and I'm sure there is a point where people in line have to request their orders to go since there literally aren't any available tables.  A dinner for two can come in between $20-$40 so be sure you have enough green on you.  If having a dining buddy save a table leaves you scrambling for your order, it's tough to go wrong here.  My \"usual\" order involves the chicken cholay or the saag ghost.  Though it may sound like a sacrilege to order here, get the chicken.  The tandoori chicken breast is so tasty, you'll find yourself eating the onions that come with it as ravenously as you did the chicken.  Wrap it all up in some of their big fluffy Naan and you'll not only be stuffed but may find yourself with hangover food for the next day.\n\nHangover food?  Yes another one of Pakwan's claims to fame is being one of the few (the only?) restaurants in SF with BYOB service.  So after you've ordered, nothing helps pass the time like some quick booze shopping.  Hit up K&H directly across the way  (good selection but cash only) or the liquor store by The Roxie (average selection but they take credit).  I'll admit a restaurant experience is definitely enhanced when your preference of booze is satisfied.\n\nDefinitely a favorite.  Who needs a server anyway?", "author": "Steven R."}

The spinach and lentils, lamb curry, and salmon is good here too. It's BYOB so it's really popular here, and you have to scout out a table while you order, and hope that someone leaves soon. \nAlso side note, when I was here on 2/10/12, Dave Chappelle was hanging out here!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-27", "description": "Let me preface this review by saying I probably know the most about curry out of everyone I know, and I know a lot of people, so I consider myself a bit of an expert when it comes to Pakistani/Indian establishments. I also used to live in Istanbul (which is in Turkey), the undisputed epicenter of Chicken Tikka Masala and curry in general.\n\nI first discovered Pakwan in 1998 and have been dining there ever since. It reminded me so much of the curry I had back in Istanbul that now I can't eat anywhere else. The one thing that's terrible is that they don't offer Chicken Daal, which is bizarre because pretty much every place in London and Turkey sells this by the vat. But their Chicken Masala is pefectly seasoned and tastes exactly like the version I had at Raoul's, my favorite joint in Istanbul.\n\nBut the best part of Pakwan is their generous BYOB policy. Back in Istanbul, I used to grab a 12 pack of Tecate and hit up Raoul's with my roommate Darcy and the fact that I can replicate the experience in SF really keeps me coming back. Why people bring liquor store red wine here is a mystery to me. Mondavi was Italian. He didn't make wine to be had with Indian food. I also know for a fact that Robert Mondavi has NEVER been to India or even Afghanistan so why would you drink his wines with Indian food? It makes no sense. Drink beer with Indian food, or sparkling wine if you really need to be a snob. \n\nThe other day I was arguing with my roommate over whether we should go to Pakwan or get burritos. Now I don't mean to brag, but I spent 6 years living in Brazil, so I know a thing or two about authentic burritos. In fact, I probably know the most about Mexican food out of everyone I've ever met in my life (even in passing, which is pretty impressive if you ask me.) He was trying to say that we should get burritos that night and then Pakwan the next, which is hogwash because everyone knows you can't eat curry if you have even minute traces of burrito left in your system, but it works the other way around (curry typically enters and exits your system so quickly that even a one day turnaround shouldn't be an issue.) So there you go: Pakwan is the clear winner in that grand debate.\n\nThe one problem I had with Pakwan was how their TV-based food alert broadcast system with satellites and GPS would constantly ping for every single order. Pakwan is usually a pretty busy place at night (unless you go for lunch but why the fuck would you do that?) so hearing constant chimes announcing that my order was ready really grates on the nerves after a few minutes. Luckily they've updated it to ping far less frequently, so I've raised my previous review of one star up to five, which I think is an accurate and fair score. \n\nFACE YOUR FEARS.

I've come to adore the little table by the window, even on a dark night.\n\nTake food out from here and maybe check out the remodel some other Yelpers are mentioning.

It's definitely a great place that offers YUMMY Indian food at great bargain prices. If you like true Indian food, you'll be hard-pressed to find something you don't like here. It's all yummy.\n\nCONS: \n1) It's always super-busy. This was the case when I was regular when I lived in the City 10 years ago (and around when they first opened). But it's gotten progressively more packed... I guess the word's been out about how awesome the food is. \n\n2) The self-serv style is all-encompassing... you go to the counter and order your own food, you buss a recently-vacated table yourself (if you want a place to sit sooner than later), you get your own water/lassi/chai/etc.\n\n3) The service of food was quite discombobulated. They called my number and the order wasn't compete. We had to have our samosa appetizers after the meal. \n\n4) In all the frantic crowded-ness, the young man who took the order was snippy and impatient. Now, I sympathize w/ the stress but there's no such thing as a slow night for them... three previous attempts to dine at Pakwan on a weeknight fell thru because I couldn't bear the wait. Shouldn't their Front of the House person know how to handle it and still offer great service?\n\nIn any case, it's a place with great Indian food. It's really worthy of all the hype and the crowds. Just might enjoy your meal more to go... and maybe picnic at Dolores Park?", "author": "Len B."}

But it's only because their lamb could be better... and it's not bad... it's just that it is not tender in the way I treasure my lamb to be. I used to get my indian at Indian Oven in the haight and Aslam Rosoi's in the mission.  Then after a few years my budget changed, and I was cast out of those societies. I was honestly forlorn (I am not being melodramatic either).  Every other indian place I went to or ordered from disappointed, left me embittered... longing for indian food of the days when cash came easy. And then, like lightening striking down from the sky, God created Pakwan.  Actually what happened was that my friend invited me there (about 5 years ago) and I have never turned back. I eat there at least twice a month, and if they were a block away instead of six I would be eating there once a week I am sure. Favorite dishes are the butter chicken and the vegetable byrani. Butter chicken is the perfect blend of succulent chicken, smokey roasted flavor, tangy and creamy. Byrani is by far the best byrani I have ever had.  The carmelized onions, perfectly cooked cauliflower, and the tartness combine to make a very gobble-iscous rice dish. Portions are perfect in all cases, but in the case of the byrani the portions are HUGE.  The lamb vindaloo has amazing flavor, but, like I said the lamb does not meet my standards in the tender department. I am forever grateful that Pakwan exists.  The prices are better than reasonable... they border on cheap! The atmosphere here is very casual, but somehow festive even though they obviously don't try to be.  I think the feeling of elation in the air there can be attributed to really happy customers who are terribly excited to be getting a delicious, cheap meal. One very odd-ball thing about Pakwan is their airport announcer style of order system on the loudspeakers.  It never annoyed me, but it does tickle my funny bone. \nLastly, I went back to both Indian Oven and Aslam Rosoi's within the past two years... and I realized that Pakwan is better.", "author": "Amphianda B."}

Along with the place being so loud I could barely hear even my next door neighbor at our table, I found my food to be exceptionally mediocre, as well as the food I tried of one of the other people in my dining group. The chicken was tough, the goat was rubbery and hard to eat, and none of the food was well-spiced. I wasn't expecting exceptional brilliance for the low prices, but man, it didn't have to be *this* bad. I ended up taking 2/3rds of my food \"to-go\" - not because I wasn't hungry but because I couldn't force it down. I ended up buying a lassi, which was pretty good, and downing that to calm my hungry stomach instead of eating any more food. Thank god for high protein desserts!", "author": "Denise B."}

My friend told me this place was good for cheap Indian eats but how good would the food be?  After ordering veggie samosas, the chicken kebab, and the mango lassi, I was hooked.  The mango juice was fresh and not canned, the samosas had a spicy kick to it, and the kebab was cooked with onions and not overcooked to the point of dryness.  All that together was $14 and not including a bunch of naan(I tried regular, potato, and ground beef naan) that was not only cheap but fresh tasting and steaming hot when it comes to you.  The food takes a little while to come out but it's definitely worth the wait.  Sometimes, they don't call out your number when your food is ready but one of the workers will come by to remind if you are a slacker.\n\nIf I'm ever in the Mission again and if I have to wait 30 mins in line for a taqueria or a tapas place, then I'd definitely come here as a reliable backup.

I am always on the side of service being able to make or break the restaurant experience and determine whether I return.  \n\nBut Pakwan is interesting because there is no expectation of service.  If you're lucky, someone will bus the dirty table you leaped over a million people to snag, if you're luckier, they'll do it before your food is ready.  You wait in line and order, then you go pick it up yourself when the giant tv that sounds like Muni calls your number.  You get your own water, tea, plates, napkins, silverware, dishes...\n\nI guess this does not bother me because you go into it knowing what you're getting in to, and you're not paying for service via inflated food prices.

As always, my favorites are the chicken tikka masala and the general vegetarian dishes (channa masala, saag paneer, etc.)., and I also really like the tandoori chicken and lamb chops.

Went here for an early dinner (approx 6pm) on a Sunday evening.  The parking in this area (Mission District) is very difficult.  When we got in there were plenty of seating, but they did not have a lot of the popular dishes available (No Haleem, No Nihari and No Chicken Kofta).  So we just got some Tandoori Chicken, Seekh Kebabs and Daal along with some Naans.  Food was good.  Self-service like most Pakistani places, but this location did seem a little nicer in terms of decor and cleanliness.  Downside: they let people bring in their own wine/beer, and the prices are a bit higher than other locations, but I guess because it's in a hip & trendy location of SF, they can get away with it. Complimentary tea was strong, but perhaps that was the dish soap that we could still smell in the cups!

Maybe I should've asked if the option was open for me to come back for refills every 15 minutes considering I was staying literally across the street. Haha. I took one sip and knew I had to fill my cup to the brim because it was SO good. I trekked back to the apartment walking gently as to not spill any of my chai, with one hand covering the cup so no rainwater could get in. Yes, I walked VERY slow in the rain so I could lose as little chai as possible. Haha! By the time we actually got back to the apartment, there was about 90% of my drink left, the other 10% was spilled over onto my hand and sleeve.

I mean that literally, for the wonderfully low prices are no harbinger of post-yogic stomach aches.  They are fast and there's outdoor seating and plenty of room for your posse.\n\nI highly recommend daal, in either of its two possible forms, and the chicken tikka masala.  Their naan is light and fluffy just out of the oven, and the samosas/vegetable things are delicious, though they tend to run out of them early on weeknights.  Eat family style with friends so you can try some of everything.  The food is also lighter on the cream than many Indian places.

You order at the cash register before sitting down and then you pick up the food yourself also (therefore saving money by not having to tip a waiter or waitress).

The bill came to $30.18 - the guy took my $40 and gave me back a $10. This was just awesome in my book! Not because of the 18 cent savings, but because no one wants to carry around a handful of jingling change in their pockets... especially in my hospital scrub pants with all of ONE pocket!\n\nUpon getting the food home, I noticed how nicely everything was packed in the bag. The Masala was in a plastic 'spill resistant' container... there wasn't a bunch of grease and sauce thrown around inside the bag.

I didn't eat there, and probably won't any time soon, but the dining area looked neat, clean and welcoming.\n\nFurthermore, after those cartons were opened, a feast commenced!

To start, our order took 25-30 minutes to prepare. When I checked on the status, I was met with sarcasm and a very dismissive answer. Whatever, I can handle slow and rude service if the food makes up for it.\nWe ordered garlic naan, rice, chicken makhani (butter chicken), chicken tandoori and aloo gobi (which was one of their daily specials). The naan and rice were served at room temperature, the butter chicken lacked the right flavor (tasted more like a really boring chicken curry), the aloo gobi was tangy and had several half-cooked potatoes and tough cauliflower (which you wouldn't expect if this was a special and they ostensibly had it marinating all day like good restaurants do) and the tandoori chicken was the worst I've ever had; tough, tasteless and didn't have the tenderness you'd expect from the tandoor and the flavor was basically limited to the seasoning on the outside of the chicken. I'm not sure what happened as this place used to be pretty good, but if you've had good Indian food before you are likely to walk away extremely disappointed in Pakwan.", "author": "Austin B."}

Well, it would be understandable for people to presume my rating is inflated due to hunger pains.  No.  This is not the case.  This place was delicious, and I place it within the contextual sphere of where I live, San Diego.\n\nSan Diego does not have cheap, delicious Indian/Pakistani food like this in the city.  Yes, it has some good Indian restaurants.  But my brother and I ordered the chicken akbar; a vegetarian dish made with garbanzo beans ( I forget the name); rice; and two order of naan for under twenty dollars.  That's unheard of in SD for this type of food.  I would have paid twice as much in my city.  And the food was absolutely perfect.  The chicken was moist, plentiful, and spicy, but not overly so.  The peppers were a great addition, and I loved soaking up the curry with the naan.  Even the chickpea dish was amazing.\n\nI also liked how they had carafes of water chillin' in the fridge by the door that any customer could just get up and bring back to the table.  And the wait for food was trivial.  And a homeless dude came in, filled up a big jug with soda and walked out without any worker saying a word.

Dollar for dollar, Pakwan is some of the best Indian in the bay area.\n\nMy favorites are the chicken tikka masala (big chunks of chicken in a creamy, slightly spicy tomato-based sauce) & the saag dal (a thick spinach-and-lentil soup).  I used to get the sabzi (stewed or boiled vegetables in some kind of sauce, I think?), but it started getting more and more greasy, so after I while I stopped getting it.  It's clear that the tikka masala & saag dal still come with a fair amount of clarified butter, but we usually manage to drain most of it off.  The rice is tasty, and the naan is better than some I've had at much pricier Indian places.  We usually get two entrees, rice for two, and two naan, which tends to run ~$17.  Given how tasty it is, you really can't ask for more than that.\n\nOther important points:\n\n- Open late.\n- You can eat in or take out.\n- Cash only, but there's an ATM next door.\n- They don't serve booze.\n- No table service; you order & pay at the counter & get a number, then get your own plates, silverware, napkin, glasses, water, etc., grab a table, & wait for your number to be called.

I didn't want to get the garlic naan because I've had too many bad experiences with charred garlic, but my friend's looked really good.\n\nSaag Paneer was tasty and the right consistency, not watery like other places. Achar Gosht (lamb curry with roasted pepper, extra spicy) was good as well. The lamb was only slightly gamey and like the menu says, it's on the spicy side. It's also a bit oily, so be careful of your clothes. The mint sauce helps with the spiciness.\n\nWhenever I see fish on the menu at Indian restaurants (in this case a Pakistani Indian restaurant) I order it. It's not that common, and even though they only had tandoori fish I wanted to try it. On the menu it's simply \"Fish\". Fillet of sole, very lightly spiced (they mean it), marinated & cooked on skewers in our clay tandoori oven. I liked it a lot (mm, fish!), but I wished there was a fish curry so I could have some with my naan.\n\nHere's how the place works: Order at the register, grab utensils (CHECK your silverware before eating 'cause some of it was still dirty), drinks, plates, and your number and bring them to your table. They'll call out your number when your food is ready to be picked up at the counter. I like places like this because you get to enjoy your company and food without being bothered. If you need anything, just go up to the counter and the people there are responsive. It's also affordable. Don't forget that Indian food is really filling.\n\nThis place falls at 3.5 for me.

Health food it ain't, but health food isn't why you're here, is it?\nIf a dish has chicken, unless it explicitly says \"boneless\" it'll have bones in it.

After taking a seat, we quickly realized that we should be in line ordering. I guess the ordering system is more obvious when there are a lot of people in line, but we came in right before the dinner rush so the small line looked like people paying their tab at the end of the meal. It was no big deal, but it did cost us ordering our food after others who arrived after us so it was mildly annoying. A simple sign saying \"order here\" would have gone a long way to make us feel more welcome.\n\nBut the deal breaker came when I went to order. After getting done ordering a big meal for my six friends who were sitting at the table, I handed the cashier a debit card. He quickly rolled his eyes, visably annoyed for me wasting his time, and said, \"cash only\" without making any eye contact. At this point there were atleast 15 people in line behind me, so I was pretty embarrased for not seeing a cash-only sign because I didn't have cash with me. Luckily, one of my friends (who I wanted to treat to dinner) was carrying cash, so I paid the guy. While he was getting my change, I looked around and saw no cash-only signs at all. At this point I was pissed for how he handled the situation, but I calmly asked him why they didn't have a cash-only sign up. He coldly replied \"We've been cash-only since the day we've opened\", as if he was the f*#@ing Soup Nazi! Had I not just paid and had my friends not been super hungry, I would have walked out of there. Instead I waited for our food in the chaotic dining room that was filled with hipsters who apparently feel right at home with Pakwan's pretentious ordering system.\n\nSo how was the food?...it was ok. I definitely enjoyed the cheaper prices and the fresh naan. My girlfriend and friends with me, who are all Indian, seemed to like it ok.

Basic naan lacked the light doughy texture I long from the most spartan of Indian/Pakis place. \n\nThe vegetarian biryani was well cooked.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-25", "description": "Chutney (511 Jones/Ofarrell) is the wife and my favorite Pakistani/Indian restaurant.  Every \"Naan\" place we go to gets compared against Chutney, and we usually end up never going to the compared place again.  So since we always compare every Paki/Indian place to Chutney, I will do so here in this review!\n\nOur order is almost always the same:  Chicken Tikki Masala, Aloo Ghobi (cauliflower/potatoes), Naan, Rice, Mango Lassi.  Aloo Ghobi is not offered at Pakwan, so we ordered Bengan Bhartha (eggplant/onions) instead.\n\n\nPakwan vs. Chutney:\n\nPrice:  Advantage- no one\n* same, just under $20.  \n\nService:  Advantage- Chutney\n* moments after ordering and sitting at a table at Chutney, 1-2 employees will come over with a carafe of water, plates, forks, and a FREE lettuce/tomato/onion salad.  Pakwan does not offer the salad, nor do they have anyone bring anything to your table.  Get your own plates/water/forks and even get your own food! (they just call your number)\n\nChai Tea:  Advantage- Chutney\n* free at Chutney, $1.00 at Pakwan.\n\nMango Lassi:  Advantage- Chutney\n* wife drinks it, not me, and she says Chutney is better.  Also, Pakwan pre-fills quite a few cups of ML and leaves it in the fridge.  Chutney pours ML fresh into a glass.  How long was our ML sitting there before we bought it?!  \n\nNaan:  Advantage- no one\n* always light and fluffy.  Can't really mess up this one, and any restaurant that does should not be in business!  Same price at each ($1.00).\n\nRice:  Advantage- Pakwan\n* rice is tasty at both places, but plate size is larger at Pakwan, so we get more rice.  Same price at each ($1.00).\n\nChicken Tikki Masala:  Slight Advantage- Pakwan\n* at Chutney, the tikki masala is always orangy and creamy and oh so good to dip naan into.  at Pakwan, the tikki masala had more texture and was less creamy, but still good to dip naan into.  I would call this even as each tikki masala is great on their own merit, but the slight advantage goes to Pakwan because Chutney gives only 6 pieces of meat, and Pakwan delivers with double the amount of chicken... at least!\n\nBengan Bhartha / Aloo Ghobi:  to be determined\n* we have not tried this yet at Chutney, and cannot compare Aloo Ghobi because Pakwan does not serve this dish.\n\n\nI cannot give Pakwan a 5-star rating because of the lack of service.  \n\nI normally don't care if I have to pick up my food at the counter, but with Paki/Indian food, we can easily have 4-6 plates, which means multiple trips back to the counter.  Pakwan will definitely be revisited and we are not giving up on Chutney, but have finally found a formidable alternative to our favorite Pakistani/Indian restaurant.\n\n(Pakwan's TL location at 501 Ofarrell is a stone's throw from Chutney, so we plan to check that out, as well as try Bengan Bhartha at Chutney)", "author": "Alan R."}

Rumor has it the restroom has gone through rehab, though I have never dared go in there myself.\nBest of all, the food is still dang-fabulous. Prices went up about a buck, I guess to pay for the new glassware and dishes and maybe even some hot water to wash them.\n\nORIGINAL 2006 REVIEW:\nLove the Pakwan food.  We eat here up to 1x per week. LOVE the lamb with spinach (saag gosht) in particular, and anything with lentils. The naan is superb in my opinion, although I see that it gets uneven scores with other reviewers. Cheap, cheap prices, too.\n\nAs I said, love the food, BUT this place is dirty! You have to select your own plates, utensils, and glasses and it is always a matter of choosing the ones with the least amount of dried food on them. (I thought hot water dishwashing was a health requirement.) Otherwise there would be more stars in my rating. Where are the health inspectors?  Blech. Takeout is probably the better bet, as you won't miss anything about  the atmosphere either.", "author": "Sandra M."}

You can't go wrong with either the Bhuna Ghosht or the Achar Ghosht. \n\nThe curry for the Nihari was excellent but the beef left a lot to be desired. This was painful since Pakwan is one of the few places that actually has Nihari on the menu. The naan at Pakwan has never been that great and that proved to be true this time around. \n\nStill, you get all this for $20.

Sadly, the quality of the food has declined markedly over the past year.  \n\nThey have doubled the amount of oil in their dishes.  It was always a little oily, but that's what one expects from a low-priced fast curry place.  But this is ridiculous. The food is swimming in oil now.  you can pour off a good deal of it if you get take out, but that doesn't make it more appetizing.\n\nThey use way too much pepper now.  I have developed a higher tolerance than many for spicy Indian food, but there are times lately I can't even eat what I get from Pakwan.  \n\nFinally, the flavors are lacking.  Not just for the above reasons, but the basic flavor is off.  Its as if the old chef has moved on, and a new chef is using the old recipes.

A Pakistani joint just 3 blocks away from my apartment? What could be better? I made myself known to the owners the very day it opened. Back then, no one else really knew it existed, for everyone was still enthralled with Indian Oven (conjurers of my ire). \n\nThe Pakwan owners, two men in their 40s, were really nice and always gave me great service whenever I went in there. Back in those times, it would still be fairly empty so I was able to eat and have a conversation with them for much of the time. Impressed with the place, I went on a mission to de-Indian Oven-ize my non-Pakistani work colleagues and roommates. They were all hooked at first bite,  and eventually word got out about the prices of this little Mission eaterie and Pakwan became the place to eat at.\n\nThe food was always decent, although their paltry portions of chicken in either their chicken boti or chicken tikka masala/makhanwala never escaped my attention. Drowning 3 cuboids of chicken in radioactive orange sauce may fool some people, but not me. But over the years I've had every single item on the menu and for the most part, they've all atleast tasted pretty good.\n\nHowever, the owners soon moved on in order to open more Pakwans elsewhere, leaving a younger guy at the register in his place. Royal jackass, this new guy was. Friendly to white people, and an asshole to his own. Yeah, it doesn't work that way, buddy. \n\nBeing a big stickler for service, I started taking my business elsewhere. Sure, I was missing great naan just down the street from where I lived, but I'm not going to have a rude punk treat me like shit just for walking up to the counter. \n\nIt's too bad. The Pakwan owners definitely won the game in bringing Pakistani to the Mission and creating an ambiance which matches what the crowd is looking for, something the nice guys who own Al-Hamra (and then Taj Mahal which closed up shop soon after it opened) are still struggling with. Maybe Fawaz or whatever his name is isn't working there anymore. Then perhaps I'd head on back.\n\nAs for the sanitary thing, Pakistani restaurants and sanitation are not synonymous (atleast in San Francisco) which is still ok, apart from my friends spotting a rat scurrying past their table one time.

It almost lived up to the hype. I gotta say, it was pretty loud and pretty scuzzy inside and I didn't expect that. The walls and floor (and tables?) seems to have a film on them. Is it the effects of the air pollution or did they forget to clean the place last year? Certainly, this is not a first date spot. But ambiance aside, it's a fantastic eatery.\n\nThe food was tasty, especially for the price, and the service was fast. I love the Indian restaurant get-your-own-plates-bitch! style of service. Quick & easy, yet by no means \"fast food.\" There was lots of flavor and a surprising lack of the normally present ghee pools, like I find at my other quickie Indian favorites. I was also pleasantly surprised and pleased by the firmness of the paneer. Best of all, you can bring your own booze, and for that reason alone I will ignore the dirty walls and yucky clouds of meat smoke and return for more scrumptious Pakwan eats.", "author": "Stumbalina b."}

Their business model is a lot like Naan n' Curry, but not as tasty. \n\nFirst of all, the food was not very spicy. Is that so wrong to ask for spicy Indian food? The only time I've had non-spicy Indian food (other than when I visited Pakwan) was in France. We spoke to the owner at the restaurant in Bordeaux and he said that was because the French don't like spicy food. Understandable. But, San Francisco is in the United States. We like our food spicy, dammit! \n\nThe samosas were crap. It seems like they took all the ingredients and put them in a blender in order to produce a tasteless mash. I love to bite into samosas and see chunks of potatoes and tons of peas. Plus, the crust was not crispy. In fact, it was a bit soggy. \n\nThe only saving grace was that the Sag Paneer had a lot of paneer in it. Otherwise, it was disappointing. They also need to wash their spinach better because it was grainy. How hard is it to wash spinach? Talk about lazy.\n\nIf you want good Indian food, just walk down the street to Alhamra. The food is exponentially better there.

Add the tandoori chicken, beef skewers, and naan for a terrific low-priced meal.\n\nAnd to get the full palate of the curry, stop by the Korean liquor store across the street for your favorite forty.  Bring in as much booze as you want actually.  Neither Pakistani Tony Danza nor the number-bellowing man with the mic will care.\n\nIt's 'git-it-yo-damn-self' service which means you're gonna have to set your table, but that also means unlimited access to the much-coveted 'purple stuff' and 'green stuff'.  These magical liquids will enhance your already tasty meal guaranteed and at no extra cost.", "author": "Neej M."}

My meat eater friends swear that this is some of the best Chicken Tikka Masala in the Bay, and as a vegetarian I know their Chana Masala and Saag Paneer are basically pretty much awesome.  It's amazingly  cheap -- we're talking maybe $5 a portion, here -- and since there's no table service, there's no tip necessary.\n\nThe place is a *little* divey, but it's not nearly as bad as most dive-like places in the area, but, see.. there's this one little detail.  I've gone to Pakwan multiple times, and each time I have to pull a hair from my food.  Sometimes two.  And they ain't mine.  And they ain't my dates.  So it kinda makes you wonder.\n\nNow, before that turns you off from the whole experience, you have to remember -- this food's *really good*.  And it's *REALLY* cheap.  And, come on, let's be honest; with all the sexy and willing hipsters at bars going au naturale in mute rebellion toward our SoCal porn-star neighbours, it's probably not the first time you got some stranger's hair in your mouth.

The portions here are far better than the portions at Shalimar-- no longer do me and my friends have to battle over pieces of meat, because there is an ample supply.\n\n3.) 16th and Valencia is a cool neighborhood--- no more dodging the crack bums and dope fiends that inhabit Shalimar.\n\n4.)

What else matters for $6.50?  \n\nWell, ambiance certainly isn't one of the things Khalid and Shabaz spent a lot time on when they drew up their business plan.  Clean bathrooms was another omission in the strategic planning.  It's awfully hard to pee when the floors are this slippery, guys.

I've passed by this place a thousand times and despite my love for Indian food, the fact that this place is always crowded and the positive Yelp reviews I have never been inside. Just did not look appetizing.\n\nSo when the craving for some Chicken Tikka Masala became overwhelming the other night I took it as a sign that I was meant to try Pakwan out. Apparently I am not so good at reading signs.\n\nMy first problem is that Pakwan is actually not that cheap. Why pay 7-8 bucks there when you can pay $10 and get a good entree at a real Indian restaurant? So the Naan is only $2 instead of $2.50? Maybe that's because it barely resembles Naan. Plus if you like rice you have to pay for it negating any money this place might save you.\n\nSecondly, Indian food is all about the spices which is why it is usually so expensive. My Tikka Masala had none of the tastes I have come to expect from the dish- at first it tasted kind of bland and then... Well it was still bland. The white meat chicken was tasteless and made me wish I had ordered a vegetarian option.\n\nThe Seekh Kabab was probably the best thing I had there and I've had better elsewhere.

It was not curry but spiced and cooked down until I couldn't see the shape of eggplant nor tomato and ate like curry with rice.\nEven though the Chicken was a bit dry (like I already said 300 times by now), the flavor of Birani was quite good.

I've had Pakwan bookmarked to try forever, and I finally ate there last weekend. It was some of the most mediocre Indian/Pakistani food I've had in a very long time or perhaps EVER. I guess nothing draws a crowd like a crowd. Yeah, Pakwan is cheap food in the City, but it's CHEAP in every sense of the word. Gamey lamb shank and dried out chicken biryani. They also had no lamb dishes (other than the lamb shank special) on a busy Saturday night. They also ran out of chai, and it took forever for them to make more. I was almost finished with my meal before a fresh container was brought out. Plus the tables were not clean and the floors were filthy. Pakwan is not even worth giving a second chance. I'm being generous with two stars. Simply overrated.", "author": "Anastasia B."}

It's a bit chaotic and it feels more like a cafe than a restaurant but you can bring your own beer and make as much noise as you want. The tikka masala is great and the lamb chops if they still do them are out of this world. Plus the old geezer who sits around on a stool and must own the place is perfectly charming. It's like a bit of Main Bazar New Delhi dropped in the Mission. Plus they deliver and it's often lightening fast. They just put up that horrid TV screen that calls out the numbers but it only makes it more like India.\n\nI changed my review of this from 5 stars to 3 because I went out the back once and saw they keep food out there where it's real dark and dirty.

When I once went in my mom and dad had intially ordered 3 dishes for lunch but the waiter repeated what we ordered and turns out he wrote 2 extra dishes we didn't want and so he gave us attitude and we took the food togo as we refused to give them tip and also refused to eat a poorly serviced establishment.

It is definitely some of the heavier indian/pakistani food that I have had.  The greasiness floats to the top, BUT, even though the food has this quality it doesn't detract at all from the experience.  There are definitely those places where the fattiness of the food can ruin it (I remember an Indian place in Berkeley I ate at years ago), but not Pakwan.\n\nI have eaten almost everything on the menu and each has its own delicious quality.

I showed just after Noon and ordered veg. samosas, naan (bread), chana masala (chickpeas in spices), saag daal (lentils with spinach), and chawal (rice) for me, my boyfriend, and my unborn baby.  All that food for under $20!  It was perfect...\n\nThe cashier was very nice... smiled a lot, and I could see the containers of fresh spices right near the griddle.  The food smelled great cooking.  I could see that those who ate in had to bus their own tables, and there was a big refrigerator for customers to grab their manga lassi, as well as any additional sauces they might want ...but they seemed to rotate them regularly, so as not to spoil them.  I appreciated that.\n\nMy food was ready very quickly, neatly in one to-go back.  It made my mouth water all the way home.\n\nWe had to eat it slowly because of how spicy it was - but spicy's what it's about! (I can't eat as much spicy these days because of the pregnancy).  We both had tummy aches later - but it was from the spiceness rather than staleness.  In other words, the food was FRESH and not stale at all, plus it was still piping hot.\n\nBoth the chana masala and the saag daal were delicious.  You could pop the cumin seeds between your teeth when you ate the saag daal.  I'd been worried that something with spinach would be bland - hah, it was rich and yummy!!  I'd get both of them again.  The RICE was FABULOUS!!!  Perfectly and flavorfully seasoned, with occasional orange grains.  The naan was perfect for dipping - light and fluffy and absorbed all the flavors.\n\nThe samosas were NUMMY.  Too bad I had to share. :-(\n\nThe only drawback was the thick layer of ghee that accumulated on the top of the chana masala - but as far as I'm concerned, it made it taste even better!\n\nAnd the whole thing made a perfect leftovers meal later. :-)\n\n\nWhy one star short of five?  Probably because for some reason, I wish I'd gotten something with more veggies.  The samosas had yummy peas and potatoes, but I always crave lots of veggies with a meal...

I sort of want to tell these people to get a life, grow up, etc. Actually, I am telling them to. If you are going to be a meat-eater, you need to get over the fact that something has to do die in a probobly gruesome manner to put that meat on your plate for a price that you are willing to pay. I realize that as Americans we are sheltered and for most of us the rarest meat we ever have to encounter comes saran-wrapped in nicely portioned colorful containers at our local grocer. Meat comes from a living thing, and it is not pretty when it is butchered for your consumption. If you have a problem with that, become a vegetarian, don't tarnish the reputation of an enthnic resteraunt whose owners come from countriers where these carcasses would usually be sold on the side of the street. I highly doubt it was unsanitary to carry it through the front door. I love Pakwan because it has none of the annoying hipster fake ethnic/I'm so cool qualities that permeate most places in the Mission. It is just a really awesome place with solid food.\n\nThat said, I love this place for the prices, (dinner for two for less than $15!), speedy service, super-nice owner (we are constantly forgetting cash, and he always lets us pay next time), BYOB, fluffy n'aan, and the kick-ass chicken tikki masala.

The food is flavorful, when I asked for really spicy, they gave me pretty spicy (which is more than most places), and everything tasted rather fresh. The amount of ghee in their dishes is astounding. I found myself draining out the oil, it was so oily. Leftovers still taste great reheated in the oven, and for the price, it's hard to beat. The variety wasn't as bountiful as I had hoped, but I must say that the Tikka Masala, Sabzi, and Bengan Bhartha with an order of Jasmine rice were all a satisfying meal with tons of leftovers, split between two people (the bill was something like $22, and it served 6+ filling meals). I have a ways to go in my hunt for best Indian in San Francisco, but Pakwan is a great place to stop for a bite along the journey.", "author": "Shannon F."}

You place your order at the counter, take a number, and they announce over the PA system and flatscreen tv that your order is up.  Pick up your order from the open kitchen counter, and enjoy hot fluffy pieces of garlic or potato naan, hot samosas, lamb biryani (my fave), chicken tikka masala (a group fave), raita, and squeeze the yummy sweet (tamarind?) and green spicy (cilantro?) dips.  umm umm umm!  All the yumminess in that order was $30, and fed 4-5 of us.  Everyone ordered for themselves, paid they're own way, but our whole order was ready at the same time.  Genius.

My expectations have since stabilized to a reasonable level but Pakwan has totally screwed with my mind. My first visit to Pakwan left me pleasantly surprised, and is probably the reason why this isn't a 2 star review. They happen to have Nihari on the menu, which is a dish rarely served by other Indo-Paki restaurants and it happened to be delicious!\n\nThe second time I went in, I asked for Ghosht Daal (Daal w/ Lamb), and they said they couldn't make it with meat. I could either have Veg Daal or some kind of meat, not both. It really ticked me off. What I really wanted was the Nihari, but I decided to try something new since the food had been good so far. I ended up ordering the chicken korma instead. It sucked. I was really baked the first time around so now I can't even be sure if the Nihari really tasted that good. \n\nVerdict: Not going back, but if I need some Nihari, I'll make sure to wait for the munchies.", "author": "Miq V."}

After hanging out for awhile, it became apparent that although we could sit, no food would be forthcoming. So we went back up and ordered. Except that I ordered rice pudding, and when I went to pick it up, there was none. He tried to sell me on gulab jamun (sp?). I said no. He tried again. I said no again. Finally I got my two dollars back. I'd still return the next time I'm in sf, but it was odd.", "author": "Kimberley D."}

It's HUGE, I thought only to pay for this chunk of lamb would cost more than the price of the curry...  \nBut still the flavor with mixture of spices does not beat the Chicken Curry at Shalimar in Tenderloin.  It's a bit less greasier than lamb curries served at Naan'n'Curry and better than N'n'C as well.\n\nSheekh Kebab - hm, very cheap but nothing really special, I would give 3.5 stars but still I have not found a restaurant that makes this Pakistani/Indian kebab really well in the city.  It's not that hard to make ones.  (I am not talking about Arabic/Greek Kebab here...) \n\nNaan: 2.5 - it's not bad, but it does not taste like how naan is supposed to taste.  Still naan or Onion Kulcha at Shalimar in Tenderloin is way better.  Their naan tastes like \"whatever flat bread\", like pita from Safeway or something.  \n\nBut overall, it's a great restaurant and I will definitely come back.

The prospect of cheap Na'an and a loose BYOB policy attracted us, and after spending 6 hours looking for parking, we grabbed a liquor store bottle of screw top Chardonnay and got in line. At Pakwan, one's forced to fight for a menu, pushing your way though a line of hipsters and finally ordering at a counter as a impatient moustached gentleman in food stained clothing angrily asks, \"You like spicy?!?!\"\n\"Uh, yeah. Do we like spicy? I don't know. Do you want spicy? Me? I like spicy. You? Okay, okay, we want spicy. Jeez.\"\nWe found a table covered in filth, grabbed two opaque glasses from the shelf, unscrewed our wine and settled in. The place was hopping, as it usually is, filled with a mix of dreadlocked hippies, Mission hipsters and the dreaded Free-Tibet yuppies. You know these people. They're the kind of people that drive new Volkswagons and pat themselves on the back every time they recycle. These are the people that think they're doing the world a favor by going to Peet's instead of Starbucks. These are the kind of people who go to artsy political movies just so they can mention it at cocktail parties and make the rest of us that went to The Breakup feel like assholes. I hate these people and I assure you, they do not belong in Pakwan.\nWe sat there, forcing down our wine/brake fluid, anticipating our dollar na'an and fried lentils. All of a sudden, what can only be described as What About Bob comes over to our table. Spotting no empty spots in the tiny restaurant, he asks if we'll be using the \"whole table.\"\n\"Oh, uh, no. Oh, uh, god. No, sure. Yeah. Sit with us. Uh, yeah. No problem. Really.\"\nMikey and I look at each other across the table as Bob Wiley settles in, slamming down a carafe of water and arranging his 47 napkins in some sort of scientific order. Over a microphone, stained shirt man calls our number. \nPakwan is actually great, because for surprisingly little money, you get a ton of food and help yourself to plates and forks and spoons and mysterious sauces in ketchup squeeze bottles. It's kind of like Camp Calcutta.\nForced to fit all 11 plates onto our now tiny table space, we ate in virtual silence, as every word we spoke was clearly and openly providing entertainment for the literature-less Bob. It became so awkward and uncomfortable, we were no longer able to stifle giggles. Bob was oblivious, forcing cauliflower down his gullet with forkfuls of rice. Picking at our food and waiting for some privacy, we watched Bob finish and sit, proudly looking over his plates, breathing heavily. Suddenly, he began to cough. Now, when I say he was coughing, I don't mean he was clearing his throat. I mean, he spent a good 10 minutes sitting there staring into space hacking up a lung like a scene from Outbreak. Michael actually leaned back and uttered, \"Oh my god...\"\nBob was able to pass whatever object blocked his windpipe and moved on, babystepping out of Pakiwan and onto the streets of San Francisco to no doubt infringe on someone else's space and disperse bacteria onto their Tikka Masala. We exhaled and leaned back into our chairs as he departed, marveling at the perfectly empty and available table behind ours. \nWe spoke freely for the rest of our meal and marveled at Bob's brazen behavior.

Oh, well, they have great food, right.\n\nWell, the onion naan wasn't ready until several minutes after the food was, so by the time I got the naan (which they were nice enough to bring to my table) the two dishes I was going to be eating them with were noticeably cooling down. Then it was soft on the inside, as if the cooking had been rushed (because of it not being synched with the rest of the food). So it loses the rest of the points there.\n\nAs for the dishes, the Saag Daal (lentils and spinach) it was very tasty but I didn't notice any spinach, only lentils. Still it was, as I said, tasty. So I good my taste needs met but not my balanced meal needs.\n\nThe mirch salan (whole chili peppers in a thick red sauce) was probably authentic but not to my liking. My scalp sweats even as I think of it. The pepper was way too hot for me. Even cutting the pepper into pieces and having small pieces with the sauce barely helped. I'm not faulting their rating on this, as I got what was advertised, and it is a pepper's destiny to be spicy, but I was unable to finish it and would not order this dish again. The sauce was very good and went well with the naan.\n\nAnd it wasn't even burn-the-mouth spicy, it was that flavor note that some hot peppers had which rendered it unpleasant for me.\n\nAll in all, I would not be inclined to come back until they (1) get better ventilation and (2) it is not a busy time, so the synchronization problem is less likely to occur.\n\nThis review applies only to this specific location.\n\nEdit: As of the next day, my jacket smells of smoke.", "author": "Charles B."}

Their best dishes has ruined my palate for most other Indian places in the US, because they're so tasty.

I've found the chicken tikka masala and saag gosht to be quite good, and much better than some other dishes, like the paneer tikka masala, which is inexplicably less flavorful than the chicken version. The biryani isn't as flavorful as I'd like to be either, but maybe that's because I just came back from a trip to India where I had super-fantastic, incredibly tasty biryani.

It's hearty, satisfying, and all for a great price. On a particular evening we wanted to introduce Pakwan goodness to our friend who was to join us for dinner, so we picked up some rice, chicken boti, tikka masala, and lentils.  all excellent by the way.  my ravenous bf couldn't wait for our friend to arrive and began shoveling food down his throat.  the next thing i saw, he was holding what looked to be an Indian spice (or so we thought). After a close inspection he was convinced this was a baby cockroach with its antennas, almond shaped body and small feet. Yuck! \n\nI called Pakwan's, as we had ordered out and explained that my bf found a freakin' roach in his rice!! The man who had taken my order originally over the phone went on about how this was a spice...HA, yeah right buddy! But he agreed to give me my money back, so I packed up the 'roach and headed back to Pakwans for the dreadful confrontation. \n\nI couldn't believe they did us like that, after all of our customer loyalty! I was so embarrassed to hype them up to my friend and now here I was:  at the scene of the crime giving the Pakwan guy back his cooked 'roach when he replies, \"WAIT! I KNOW WHAT THIS IS!\" and runs to get something in the back. On his return he opens his palm and states, \"This is an Indian spice called CARDAMOM!\" He continues to show me a few almond shaped pieces and compares these to the alleged cooked 'roach. YES, the Cardamom had two antenna looking strands coming out of the tip and when you break the spice in the middle it has seeds which resemble the inner body of a 'roach. After further inspection I thought, \"Why the hell does a cooked cardamom look like a freakin' cockroach?!\". I know... I wanted to believe it was a 'roach because I didn't want to feel stupid but here is the truth; we were wrong and Pakwan's is still a legit place to eat. \n\nThank you Mr. Pakwan person for helping to educate me on what cardamom is and how it is used to flavor many indian dishes! \n\nLESSON LEARNED!

We had chicken tikki masala, 2 kinds of naan bread (regular and garlic), beef skewers, and a chicken curry dish.  Nothing really stood out to me....actually I was disappointed in the food.  Everything was just meh.  I also ordered a mango lassi - was looking forward to one all day and again was disappointed.  It was a bit sour - too much yogurt.  Service was average - you walk up to the counter to order your food, pay and wait for your number to be called.  Food came out quick...5-7 minutes and we were eating.  Since the food didnt do it for me, I won't be coming back here.", "author": "Amy T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-23", "description": "In response to a prior review, I don't know if everyone here is nuts, because I haven't tasted any nuts in the dishes at Pakwan. Bahahaha, I slay me...\n\nIn any case, personally I love this place. I come her regularly with a friend, and this is a wonderful place to catch an affordable meal and have some downtime/catch-up time. In general, I like eating Indian food because of all the vegetarian options, and Pakwan doesn't fail. The pakora makes for a hearty appetizer, and all the different kinds of naan are awesome, though with cheese naan and garlic naan available, I recommend holding off on plain naan for the places that only offer plain. There's an eggplant dish that I really like, but the posted specials are usually experiments that end in success for me. The atmosphere is also wonderful, too --- kind of like a cafeteria, but more animated and lively. I'm also very impressed with the restroom, which used to be a dump, according to my friend who's eaten there for years. I never saw the restroom in its prior incarnation, but currently it's very well maintained.\n\nSelf-service is the name of the game here. You place your order at the counter, take a number, and wait to pick up your food at the other end of the counter. Water and other beverages are accessible from a side refrigerator, as well as all your utensils. Service attitude varies, but they're generally quite friendly. One guy at the register took pity on me when I was short a few cents. I insisted on going back to my table and getting the required amount from my backpack, but he waved away my effort. That certainly earned him a well-deserved tip in all those carafe tip jars that you see lined up next to the register.", "author": "Joseph R."}
