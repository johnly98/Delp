They grill the tortilla with cheese and meat to get the outside slightly crisp and melt the cheese, its the best way to do it. Super had fresh bright green avocado, beans, sour cream, and not too much rice. Meat was rich and moist, unlike the bland and chewy chicken you are often stuck with in inferior establishments.\n\nMy buddy got a vegetarian burrito. All the same stuff with no meat for $8.99.\n\nThe green salsa from the hot sauce bar was dope. Nice and spicy. Bar also has chips, jalapenos, spicy pickles, and red salsa.\n\nIts a no-frills place that is low-key awesome.

If that weren't the case, it would have gotten a solid 3. The quesadilla (or is it pastor?) comes on the VERY GREASY side, so this thing was literally dripping oil as I attempted to eat it. Not a really good experience when I'm eating a quesadilla, or anything for that matter lmao.\n\nSo yeah this rating is based almost entirely on my experience with the food here. Other things about the establishment including service, friendliness, cleanliness, condiment bar are pretty much on par with other Mission taquer\u00edas, at least as far as I'm concerned. Price point is also pretty similar - the quesadilla I got was $11-12. The regular burrito is about $9-10. \n\nWouldn't come back.

The tacos were definitely good, but there was nothing special about the meat, tortillas, or the sauce. To be honest, I liked other things about the place more:\n- vertigo vibe, with a TV in the corner playing spanish-language news at full volume, which is competing with giant speakers in the middle of the room blaring boleros. kinda loved it.\n- the free chips & salsas (plural) station in the corner, near the counter.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-03", "description": "We came into the Mission last week for one thing, and one thing only: an Al Pastor Burrito from El Castillito. Reading an old copy of Bon Appetit, El Castillito was praised as having \"the best burrito\" ever eaten by the author, Gustavo Arellano (who you should get to know if you haven't) and David Chang (?!). I'd never even heard of this place! \n\nAs a Bay Area native, I've frequented El Faro, El Farolito, La Taqueria, etc. my entire life, and realized that I've never crowned any specific taqueria with \"Best Burrito.\" As far as burritos go, I'm a simpleton - I came into adulthood eating $2 BCR's (bean, cheese, rice) from Cinco de Mayo in Concord. I reserve judgments for rellenos and enchiladas. Burritos are almost always two thumbs up.\n\nEither way, curiosity got the best of me, and we braved the post-apocalyptic hell that is the 16th St. BART station to get to this place. El Castillito is your classic hole in the wall - bright yellow walls, a couple guys running the place that are laid back and casual, insane piles of carnitas and asada being grilled on the flattop in back. Folks wheeling their bikes in and hanging out...the usual.\n\nWe ordered just one Al Pastor (pork) Super Burrito ($10) - rice, pinto beans, cheese, meat, chunky guac, a bit of sour cream. Just your classic burrito, with free chips (unfortunately not freshly fried) and salsa bar (2 salsas - tomatillo and tomato-based, both pretty mild). \n\nBigger than your average forearm, the size, filling distribution, and overall quality of the burrito is indeed 5 stars. It's a great burrito, and you'd be a fool for passing it up if you're in the area. I hope that's the only convincing you need. \n\nGeneral cleanliness, ambiance, and overall vibe leaves a bit to be desired, but the burritos are definitely top notch. Definitely not a date night spot, but worth a stop if you're on a bar crawl or your own burrito quest. Godspeed!", "author": "Laura B."}

To me, this is a good thing, especially when a Mexican joint has Hispanic/Mexican customers + locals. They take card - so we ordered and didn't wait very long at all. I got the bean and rice burrito, my friend ended up getting the two tacos plate with beef tacos or something and eventually getting a shrimp taco. \nFor two - we did not wait long AT ALL. It was great! The cashier was being super patient with me because I was trying to overcomplicate my order and he was trying to help me out.\nFor three - the food was so good. It was just so good.

It is close to a BART stop which is nice, but in a more dingy area of the Mission. Try not to sit too close to the door or someone may come in and ask you for money. It was not a scary area, but maybe a tourist who is not used to homeless people may be alarmed by it. There are so many other taquerias in the area, that there would be  no need for me to visit it again. Same prices as Chipotle.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-07-02", "description": "Food is good so the two stars are for that. \n\nWhere they lose major points is the purposefully vague way they handle their menu. This was the third occasion I paid almost $10 for what should have been $4-$5. \n\nAllow me to explain: \n\nThey offer a \"regular\" nachos and a \"super\" nachos. They're only $1 different in price, but the super has just about everything on it, including choice of meat. You might ask \"who would opt for the cheaper one, when the super is practically the same price?\" Well, usually I just want something lighter, so it's what I lean toward. The first time I got that, while making it, the guy behind the counter asked what meat I wanted. I clarified, \"oh, it comes with meat? I thought it was just beans, cheese and jalape\u00f1os..\" He said \"yeah, meat if you want it\". Awesome. That kinda makes sense, since it's almost as expensive as the super. I add chicken. Then, am summarily charged for the super. \"I asked for the regular nachos\", I begin to say. \"Oh, no, you added chicken, that's the super\". Allow me to ponder, then, why the hell I asked them that question 45 seconds prior. \n\nTime after that, similar instance, but now that I'm savvy to the system, I want the regular nachos, and almost ask if I can add avocado - assuming I'll be charged an extra dollar or two - quickly realizing, it's probably cheaper to order the super, minus everything but avocado. Aha! Genius! So I plainly say that I want what's on the regular, plus avocado, so to please make an order of the super, no meat, no other extras. The cashier asks \"oh.. do you want the regular?\" I explain my rationale, saying it appears cheaper to do this, versus an add-on of avocado. She clarifies, \"so, just beans, cheese, jalape\u00f1os and avavado?\" Precisely! Oh but wait.. I'm still charged for the regular + add-on avavado. Apparently her clarification was actually an attempt at upselling. \n\nNow, you're probably thinking.. Who cares? It's take out food, not a mission to Mars. True. Very true. But there's something just so irritating about stopping by for a late night nosh, specifying what you want, double checking it with the cashier, and getting charged extra. \n\nAnd just tonight, a mere moment ago, I ordered the \"flour tortilla and cheese\" quesadilla. She keys in the order, I add \"oh, uh, may I add a side of rice?\" reading from the board marked \"Extras\". She asks if I want rice added into the quesadilla, or on the side, and I just say \"on the side is fine\". I hand her a $10, for the $3.99 quesadilla and $1.50 side of rice and get handed back to $1 bills. \n\nA moment passes and I think \"did I do it again, did I fuck up this ultra simple order? Am I back in this Bermuda Triangle of add-ons?\" \n\nI ask the cashier \"pardon me, how much was the total?\" She looks down at the keys of the register to jog her memory and says \"quesadilla was $4, rice on the side is $4\".\n\n\"I thought it's $1.50\", pointing, \"on the 'Extras' menu?\" She begins to ask \"did you want rice *in* the quesadilla or *next to* the quesadilla? \n\nI pause... what the hell is the difference? \n\n\"Umm.. On the side? I just wanted what's on the menu for $1.50\" \n\n\"Yes but you want a side of rice, that's extra. Those items (on the Extras menu) are for extras added to it, like if you were adding rice to a burrito it's $1.50 but if you want rice next to it that's different\" \n\n\"Alright..\" becoming hopeful that she hears herself and realizes how dumb this all sounds, and offers to give me back the difference, \"I asked for a side of rice, which is on the menu for $1.50, (now really annoyed) where on the menu does it even say that rice is also available for $4?\" \n\nShe smiled sheepishly, repeating her explanation about how the geographical location of the rice dictates a near $3 differential in price. \n\nPart of me wanted to cancel the order, ask for my money back, and leave on my apparently misguided principle that when someone orders off the menu, they're charged the goddamn menu price. But that would have meant I paused House of Cards and put on pants all in vein. \n\nI waited for my $8 box of tortilla, cheese and rice, pondering that eternal question: do I feel petty enough to leave a poor Yelp review? \n\nYes, I say now, proudly. And even though my quesadilla is cold I feel slightly better about myself. And that's worth at least $4.", "author": "Scott R."}

I told him I needed to use the bathroom and he informed me, with words and gestures, that he was not going to leave because he was planning on smoking in there.\n\nI don't know if he meant weed or tobacco or crack, but clearly he did not want to leave. I told him several times that I needed to use the toilet and he demonstrated to me that he did not plan to exit the bathroom to give me privacy.

What happened after that I know only because my native Spanish speaking boyfriend relayed it to me.\n\nApparently this guy was friends with the staff, and when he was told to leave the bathroom he started spouting all kinds of profanity about me.

The staff was super friendly and the cook accommodated my \"no cheese or sour cream\" request for my vegetarian taco. It came piled high with rice, beans, lettuce, avocado & a huge slice of tomato. Chips and salsa bar are complimentary and the prices to begin with are some of the least expensive I've seen on my trip. When we were eating, the majority of the restaurant was filled with people I'm assuming are locals so it must be a favorite stop.

I like it better than Taqueria Cancun which is the most popular (and overrated) between 16th and 18t.  LA Oaxican once sold me a crunchy blue corn tortilla which was terrible and the vibe seems weird to me. \n\nI love the simple regular burrito or a dinner plate.  Good prices, CONSISTENT.  I can always cut my burrito in half and save the rest.  That alone earned the 5th star.  They also used to be in the Castro at 18th.  Solid.  If you are looking for flare try Los Coyotes taqueria.  More expensive and you won't get two meals our of the burrito.  \n\nThe staff is friendly and also pretty consistent.  I've been going for 5 years.", "author": "Jonathan B."}

While I know that these are sad sights, I must admit: on some level they are so incredible, that you have to shake your head and laugh.  \r\n\r\nIn short, the quality of the food here *may* be a little worse than the Castillito on Church (and many other taqueria), and the customers are - for sure - a little worse for wear (ok, some ALOT worse for wear), but that's part of the charm, I suppose.  I've seen some pretty mundane things, some sad things, some uncomfortable things, and - most importantly - some funny things (at least in a cosmic sense) while eating meal at this other Castillito.

Drawback:  Lotsa small-time crack and smack dealers and disgusting disease-infested whores just outside this place at night can ruin your appetite.", "author": "David M."}
