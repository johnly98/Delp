Underwhelming especially considering the price, the chicken was pretty good it pink near the bone, and the pasta was overly oily. My Buddha bowl tofu wasn't as crispy as it should've been, but the Thai green curry sauce that came with it was pretty good. The cheescake has no hint of goat cheese at all and the blueberry ice cream that came without had a very very weak blueberry taste. The bread pudding was very good, however, and reminded me of molten lava chocolate cake, especially with the custard sauce you can pour into it.

The ambience is on point, the service is phenomenal, and we really enjoyed our meal. He made a reservation on Open Table, and apparently being an \"early bird\" in the evening meant that we'd get two complimentary glasses of ros\u00e9. It was delicious and a perfect level of sweetness.\n\nTitus roll - this wasn't bad, but also not great. I felt that there wasn't enough flavor in the roll itself, although the ingredients tasted fresh (especially the spicy tuna). This isn't something I'd order again because I could get a great sushi roll elsewhere and at a lower price. My fiance wanted to try the Local Motion roll that he saw on Yelp, but the chef was not willing to make it because it wasn't on the current menu. We understood though, and were happy to choose an alternative.\nThe Rock - we mainly ordered this for the \"cool\" factor of cooking our meat on a hot rock. It seemed quite gimmicky and we assumed we would only be given a few slices of meat, but we went for it anyway and I'm so glad we did! The dish came with a good amount of thinly sliced wagyu beef, and it was soft, tender, and had a great flavor all on its own. Plus, it was fun :P This comes with a trio of sauces - spicy korean sauce (similar to gojuchang), kizami carrot sauce, and cilantro puree (my favorite one). \nMisoyaki black cod - absolutely delicious. The fish was cooked perfectly and was very soft and moist. The truffle dashi broth was awesome and we drank all of it at the end. The pumpkin gnocchi had a good bounce to it, and the braised daikon radish absorbed the broth's flavor so well. We both thoroughly enjoyed this.\nTruffle mushroom risotto - this was a side order to supplement our meal. It smelled strongly of truffle, but the actual truffle flavor was lighter. The rice wasn't as soft as usual risotto, but my fiance actually preferred this texture. Finally, there were lots of mushrooms, just the way we like it.\n\nWe ordered the perfect amount of food and were completely satisfied. What made the meal amazing and worthy of that fifth star, however, is the service. Our waiter Acen was extremely nice right from the beginning, always had a smile on his face, and was so attentive to us throughout the meal. When he found out it was our anniversary, he let us choose a dessert item and came out with two glasses of dessert wine. The salted caramel pot de creme was delicious and Acen even wrote out \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate with chocolate sauce and little crispies. This was a perfect cap to our dinner. David was also wonderful and we really appreciated his great service! He was quick to get us whatever we needed, and he definitely made our meal a fun one with lots of laughter! We loved asking about hobbies shown on everyone's name tags - what a great idea to include that. The hostess in the front greeted us so warmly, and a manager stopped by our table to check in on us. Anzu's staff is top notch and we were very impressed.\n\nMy fiance and I had such a great night, and it is one of the best dining experiences I have had in a while. We will be sharing this place with others and look forward to coming back!", "author": "Nicole M."}

I just wasn't loving my drink or the environment so I figured why not go back to my hotel bar/restaurant?  So glad I did.  They had just opened and there were maybe 4 or so people at the bar.

I'm already planning my next trip back!\n\nFood:\n1. Unfortunately, the Restaurant Week menu was disappointing. For $40 you received a Bean Salad starter , Crusted Tuna Entree and a Fondue dessert. The bean salad looked fresh, but uninteresting, and while the crusted tuna entree was very generous, the tuna was under seasoned and tough. In short, I would not recommend coming to Anzu for Restaurant Week. \n\nTheir ala carte menu on the other hand, was very good. I started with \"The Rock\", a stone heated to 400F on which you could cook thin slices of Wagyu beef. It was fun, entertaining and delicious. We also tried the Ceviche sampler which was light and refreshing. \n\nFor the main, the waitress recommended the cod which was DELICIOUS. The cod was tender and cooked to perfection in a light dashi broth. I loved my dish and thought it was well worth $26 considering the quality and quantity served. \n\nThe highlight of the night, however was the chocolate fondue. It was a revelation. I have never experienced such deliciousness EVER. The chocolate fondue was nutty, creamy and yet surprisingly light. We polished off almost the entire pot and still wanted more and were extremely perplexed by how light, fluffy and addictive the fondue was. If I was on my own I'd have licked the pot clean :D I would definitely come back just to have their fondue again.\n\nIn short, I had a fabulous experience at Anzu and will definitely be back.

You can also get sandwiches for fairly reasonable prices ($14-$17). Another great option is the vegan udon served with a large brick of fried tofu. \n\n\"The Fog\" dessert is similar to a flourless chocolate cake shaped into a cone, with banana cream garnish and a tiny potato chip at the top. They bring it out on a bed of dry ice, which creates a fog that spills over the edges of the dish and swallows the table with graceful billows of, hence the name, fog. :)\n\nThe ambiance is fairly upscale, but it is in a hotel, so that's to be expected. But the walk through the building to the restaurant is breathtaking, high ceilings, water fountains flowing along the edges of the steps, Japanese fans and art work displayed, and open lounge space with couches and tables. \n\nEvenings can get pretty dressy and the bar is usually bustling.

The Wasabi mashed potatoes were also bland.\nThe amount of veggies provided was quite minimal.  It was an underwhelming restaurant\nexperience particularly (as noted above) for the prices paid.

There were several tables of Japanese business men no doubt celebrating a contract for the next UHDTV, SUHDVD or Walkman :)\n\nOur server, Liz, was a spunky girl from Erie, PA.  She verbally played with us throughout the meal and was well deserving of the 20+% tip we gave her.  Her favorite thing on the menu is the miso black cod.  I am not a FoC (fan of cod), plus we were there for sushi.\n\nThe menu is quite diverse: there is a four course fixe-prix menu ($41) or $65 with wine.  There are \"japanese staples\" like sushi and waygu beef.  We elected to start with \"The Rock\", which was sliced beef that we cooked on a 400 degree rock.  There were a trio of dipping sauces, but it was nothing to write home about.\n\nThe sushi was okay - not great and I hesitate to say it was good enough to order again here.  There were a number of other entrees that I could try.  It wasn't bad, but for a japanese restaurant, I expect better.\n\nThe best part was dessert.  I had the bread pudding, which was more like a pecan pie.  Two guys in our party had the sorbet, which was nicely presented.\n\nWe had good service - not great.  The sushi took a long time to come out, as did the dessert.  I fear that dining patrons later on in the evening were overwhelming the kitchen.

The pork belly was alright. I thought the crispy duck was too hard to chew. I was worried that we would be too full because we had previously eaten a late lunch, but turned out to not get too full off dinner. \n\nOverall this is a nice place with elegant food presentation and a slightly pricy menu.

I think 3.5 stars is the accurate rating for this restaurant. \n\nTo start, we ordered a half dozen oysters and the rock (wagyu beef cooked on a hot rock). The oysters were solid - nothing really special but still good oysters. The rock was really cool to see and fun to cook at the table, but I thought as a dish it was pretty lacking in flavor. \n\nWe also ordered the 15pc sashimi platter. I think this was definitely one of the better dishes of the night. They give you a lot of variety and the fish is pretty good.\n\nWe also ordered the ANZU roll, which they forgot to give to us so we ended up eating it after all our entrees which was not a big deal, but not ideal either. The roll itself was okay - I had high expectation for it but I was a bit disappointed. \n\nAs for our entrees, we got the black cod, the risotto, and the beef strip loin. The black cod had good flavor and came in a nice broth with a bunch of vegetables, but it was really small. And all of us left the restaurant not really full, and I think that's mostly because of how small the cod was (we all shared). The risotto was great, definitely one of the better dishes. They don't use rice - it's something with more of a wheat texture, which actually made it really interesting. The beef strip loin was good. Some bites I thought were great and some were just okay. Although I do feel it came out kinda lukewarm. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the pot de creme, pavlova, and bread pudding. My personal favorite was the bread pudding, but a lot of us also really liked the pot de creme. Pavlova was pretty good as well. \n\nNone of the dishes were bad, but the fact that all 5 of us left not really full (some still wanted to eat afterward) was the biggest thing, especially since we ordered so much (4 courses). \n\nThe ambiance and the service, however, are really nice - so it's definitely worth a visit.", "author": "Andy H."}

The lobby of the hotel and the restaurant itself are modern and beautiful and I couldn't wait to taste the food. I expected small portions and I knew for the $25 lunch pre-fixe meal offered during SF Restaurant week, I wouldn't be getting much in terms of portions and I was ok with that. Originally I planned on ordering items a la carte but their brunch menu isn't particularly interesting so I stuck with the pre-fixe.\n\nThe atmosphere and service are both above average. The service wasn't overly friendly but they were attentive and professional and I appreciated that they gave me and my friend enough time to make conversation even though we stayed almost to closing.\n\nThe $25 lunch pre-fixe basically gets you 3 lettuce wraps and a piece of chicken. I picked the restaurant due to the location and I was looking forward to seeing how the restaurant would elevate simple items but I was disappointed.\n\nOur starter was the Duck Confit Lettuce Wraps. First thing I noticed was the lettuce. I could not figure out why they wouldn't use butter lettuce. I went home and took another look at the menu and apparently they're supposed to use butter lettuce so not sure what happened there. It seems like a small thing, but having the duck served on a piece of iceberg/romaine type of lettuce takes the dish from restaurant quality to cafeteria quality especially since the filling itself was so subpar. The duck confit I've had before is tender and succulent, this was closer to the chicken from a salad place. The fried shallots were a good addition but the main highlight was the jalape\u00f1o lime dipping sauce which was the saving grace of this dish. (2.5/5)\n\nOur main dish was the tea-spiced smoked chicken breast over the \"risotto\" (basically sauce with vegetables). The \"risotto\" and the sauce were both good. The potatoes, brussels sprouts, etc. all retained a nice texture and the sauce was good though not quite spectacular enough to make up for the chicken which was a big disappointment. The skin was barely crispy and the chicken itself was dry. The smoke and tea flavor were noticeable but not enough so to make the dish particularly memorable. Overall not a bad dish but considering how interesting their regular menu sounds, I don't think I'd get it again. (3/5)\n\nOverall, rather disappointed with my visit here. I would love to give it another try for their regular dinner menu but the SF Restaurant Week lunch meal is a thumbs down for me. Maybe if I ever found myself staying at the hotel I'd give this place another shot.", "author": "Vivian C."}

I am Chinese and grew up eating the congee especially after Thanksgiving.  One can throw the turkey bones into making the jook as well as adding ham for more flavor.

Poor execution; regret; warning to others.\n\nThe Rock - where one self-cooks thin slices of Wagyu beef on a hot rock the shape and size of a bsked potato. The rock wasn't hot enough to caramelize the meat, and cooled from there, so it was more warning meat than cooking. (In contrast,  recently in the UK, we had a hot rock caramelize a steak & continue to cook it.) The beef, cut to the size of a postage stamp, was strangely tasteless. The three simple, lackluster sauces made a bad situation worse.\n\nKampachi Carpaccio - has jalape\u00f1o & lemon, but rather than spicy the mouth feel is unappealingly bitter.\n\n72-Hour Beef Cheek - billed as \"like pot roast\" it had a texture of tongue, with the additional charm of gristle.

I don't think my water was every less than half-filled for more than a few minutes.  There's a pre-fix menu where you receive appetizer, soup, entree and dessert so of course I had to indulge. \n\n4 Course Dinner:\n-The cute savory cone filled with spicy ahi tuna topped with tobiko...I wish they would have given me 5 and not just one.  It was sooooo good! \n-They move you on to the soup de jour, which was a white bean and veggie soup.  Be careful - it's hot!  Paired well with the soft, fresh, warm bread and butter.\n-The entree comes as you finish your soup...macadamia encrusted king salmon.  The fish is moist and fresh and sits on top of black rice and a poached egg. I forgot what kind of egg it is, but the yolk is rich and creamy and lends a great flavor to the rice.  The entire dish is pulled together by the wasabi beurre blanc sauce.\n- Just when you feel like you can't eat anymore, they gently place the Sweet Ginger Panna Cotta on the table.  And of course, you have to oblige.  The thing is so damn pretty!  Candied ginger pieces are sprinkled on top of the creamy and refreshing panna cotta.  There's a smear of tart raspberry sauce which balances the dessert and cuts through the slight richness of the panna cotta.\n\nDoesn't this sound so good?  But WAIT.... I saved the best for last.  You have to try the misoyaki black cod....OMG.  The perfectly cooked and seasoned cod sits on top of edamame wontons, shitake mushrooms, shaved leeks and carrots in a ginger dashi.

Oh, and one bottle of sake, a round of cocktails, decent food, and mediocre service. Yup, $350. WHAT?!?!?!?$?! \n\nThe appetizers: well, they were certainly small enough to whet the appetite, but way way way too small. Amongst the ceviche there was literally a single shaved slice of radish. One. Slice. Who does that? \n\nThe sushi: It was certainly decent as San Francisco sushi goes. Nothing blew my mind (for reference, my personal fave in town is Sushi Bistro), but everything was nice and fresh. Can't remember the particular rolls we had, but they were the two the waiter picked as the house specialties.\n\nThe mains: No, just no. The cod was very tasty, and the rest of the mains were utterly uninteresting, as if they appeared out of nowhere from some other restaurants' menu. I'm not sure why the pseudo-Italian dishes are here, other than to appease tourists who found the Japanese dishes too daring? Seriously, it made no sense, and nothing even got us curious. And did I mention they were *quite* pricey? No thanks.\n\nThe drinks: Again, too weird a menu for my tastes. I couldn't tell if I was in a bizarro hipster bar all of a sudden. Not a *bad* list, but it just didn't make any sense in context to the food. And too expensive - I get that they are in a hotel, but it's no excuse.\n\nThe service: I'll chalk it up to \"they were having a bad night\" but let me tell you, we had a bad night. The restaurant was no better than half-full, yet we waited at every step. First drink, first order, food, etc - nothing was zippy. We spilled a glass of water, nobody rushed to our table - which at $350/four-top is something I'd expect.

The menu was extensive and offered a variety for the various dietary restrictions my family has.\n\nI tried most of the dishes, and they were okay.  The dim sum and sushi rolls were decent.  Some entrees were hits, like the fish with couscous that had a citrus zing.  Others were misses, like the potatoes that were kind of cold.  And you can't go wrong with the chocolate fountain.  Other desserts like cakes and mousse were available too.  They also had chicken nuggets and fries for kids.\n\nService was fantastic.  The mimosas were bottomless, and the wait staff were very welcoming and helpful.\n\nSo 5 stars for the service, 2 stars for the food.

The service was exemplary at every meal. They have highly trained staff who are both friendly and efficient. I could not have asked for better service. \nSadly the menu did not live up to the wonderful service. Breakfast was a very acceptable Buffet served starting at 6:30 in the morning which is excellent for business customers. Lunch includes the option of an Express lunch with several very small courses all served at once in a Bento type setting which is efficient, quick and was generally fairly tasty. There were some sad exceptions and dinner unfortunately was unremarkable. \nDo not order the Ahi tuna tartare. This dish consists of mushed up tuna spread in an incredibly thin layer over flavorless mashed potatoes whose only claim to fame is that the potatoes are apparently Peruvian in origin. This does not equate to flavor, however, and to someone from Hawaii who is used to flavorful ahi, this dish was a strategic disappointment and should be removed from the menu.\n Other items that I had on the small plate menu included an appetizer duck confit with a frisee salad. The amount of duck was probably about a tablespoon of flavorless duck pieces. People who order duck confit are used to larger portions. As an appetizer this did not need to be a full meal of duck but still needed to be a lot more than what was offered. The fois gras torchon was delicately flavored but again served in such a minuscule portion that you had to look twice or you would miss it. The beet salad had perhaps four small hunks of beet in the entire salad. Generally I approve of small portions but Anzu took this to a very sad level and therefore did not provide me with any food that I found remarkable. \nGiven the remarkably wonderful service, I feel the chef needs to be invited to either seriously step up the game or step out of the restaurant and let someone else take his or her place.", "author": "Elise F."}

The restaurant had a 5 course meal set up for $85. Sounds good right? WRONG! None of the items on the Valentine's menu were anything the restaurant normally has, you know like sushi, salmon, or anything most Japanese restaurants have. Instead it was filled with confusing items and things that sounded like they were thrown together just to sound fancy. Being confused by the menu, we asked our waitress about some of the items and she was very blunt and rude. It was obvious we were struggling with the menu, so a little customer service could have gone a long way. \n\nUpon getting the first 3 courses, we were shocked to see how small they were. My girlfriend's \"tuna\" was a little slab of what looked like a slimy tomato with a few tiny pieces of tuna sprinkled on top. By that point I had enough and requested to speak to a manager. He was just as rude and explained to me that this is how they handle holiday meals. The 4th course would be \"much bigger\" he said. I asked how big it is, and he said 6oz. I understand 5 course meals are multiple small portions but I've never been to a place with portions this small, especially for $85.

The menu has some nice options, but pricing and execution make you realize that the restaurant feels like a hotel establishment....not a fine dining option you'd choose if you weren't staying here or going to a show here.  \n\nI appreciate that they have only a few sushi roll offerings....I'm a huge proponent of \"do 4-6 rolls....but do them well.\" Unfortunately the Nichi roll was not done as well as I would have expected. The end pieces were crumbling apart, and some of the hamachi slices on the outside were tough and chewy. The flavors were okay....but not spectacular. Again, for this price and the fact that they only do a small number of rolls, there's no reason for them to not be spectacular.\n\nMy friend ordered a fennel appetizer (it may have been a special - not sure) and liked it a lot.\n\nHad the Portobello Mushroom Mignon for my entree. There were many vegetables in small arrangements dispersed throughout the plate and they were very flavorful. The mushroom stack itself was just okay. I would have happily replaced it with double the amount of all the other items that were on the plate. My friend had the Seabass and I have to say that it seemed to be the \"bargain\" on the menu. If you saw the quantity of food on his plate, vs. mine, and you realized that there was only a $3 difference, you'd likely make an adjustment. A. Give him less; B. Give me more; C. Adjust the price of the Mushroom plate downward; or D. Adjust the price of the Seabass plate upward. I'd vote for B or C.\n\nService was polite and friendly.

I would have liked my Truffle Mac and Cheese more if I hadn't also ordered a $5 Mac and Cheese off the kid's menu and received the SAME. EXACT. DISH.\n\nMy husband pointed out that it made my dessert $12.95. When they arrived the server confirmed that the mac and cheeses were the same. Hubby speculated that they probably just made a bigger batch, and that maybe the regular mac and cheese (this was with large shells) was different. Alls I know is one was a good deal, the other not so much.\n\nMy babies preferred the cold mac and cheese (made from a Trader Joe's box) that I brought along. But still my babies have tried truffle oil. How soon caviar?\n\nIt should be noted that some friends of mine pointed out basically I was upset that the restaurant was nice to my kids. And I have to say, I was really impressed with their kids' menu - there were lots of options for only $4 and $5. Anzu was surprisingly baby friendly: they gave us a coloring book (with pictures of San Francisco) and crayons, plus the bathroom has a changing table (which the hotel lobby does not.) The babies loved the big glass artwork filled with bubbles that changed colors. It's a little quiet for babies so bring yours at your own risk. Luckily, ours did great.\n\nThat said, the presentation of the entrees wasn't so baby friendly. The macaronis and cheese (something I've never had to pluralize before) came in giant avant garde dishes with a bowl indentation in the center for pasta and a huge 9 inch rim from the bowl to the edge of the plate. It was not at all appropriate for two year olds who couldn't reach the pasta so I had to request other dinnerware.\n\nAnyway, back to the food. My husband had the prix fixe as well and started with the seabass sandwich. He liked it but I thought it was a little bland. It came with four olives and a small salad with tasty cherry tomatoes.\n\nWe enjoyed our house bread. There was both a nutty multi-grain wheat-y sort of bread and a sourdough. They were also big hits with the babies.\n\nMy dessert was the pumpkin creme brulee. It wasn't creme brulee-y at all, and the flavor was kind of a blah pumpkin custard. Some spices would have been nice. My husband's ice cream sundae was pretty great and included chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry ice cream along with almonds and bananas, and of course hot fudge sauce.\n\nSarah the hostess was super friendly on the phone and in person, and had our table with high chairs ready for us. Our server wasn't particularly warm. Also, there were times when we had clearly finished lots of our plates and he didn't take any away.\n\nThere is always an express lunch available here with three courses for $18.95.

I'm glad we did. \n\nWe arrived a bit early and were warmly welcomed, quickly seated, and given our menus and an overview of the evening's specials. We proceeded to order a couple of refreshingly original yet familiar cocktails while we contemplated our options. \n\nFor starters, we ordered the \"rock\" appetizer (paper thin slices of wagyu beef that you cook yourself on a searingly hot rock accompanied by some tantalizing sauces to dip it in) and the crab/avocado salad. Beautifully presented and perfectly proportioned, they were both packed with fresh and obviously high quality ingredients and exactly what we needed to whet the appetite for what was to come...\n\nFor the mains, I had the slowly braised short ribs while my partner had the seafood \"stew\". The short ribs were exquisite.  As the plate was placed in front of me, the glaring heat from my stare was all that was necessary to start them melting. They literally, and I kid you not, fell apart at the slightest touch of my fork. No knife required.  The \"prime\" grade beef ensured that every bite was abundantly moist. Paired with the truffle \"foam\", this was definitely a dish for those of you who appreciate slowly cooked fine cuts of beef. They were so amazing, in fact, that the gentleman sitting at the table next to us, who had been enjoying his meal and his wife's company and had not said a word to us up to this point, had to lean over and say \"Those short ribs look absolutely amazing!\"  I assured him they were...\n\nMy partner's fish stew, a lighter take on the San Francisco tradition of cioppino, was equally delightful. In this rendition, the fresh seafood flavors came shining through. No overbearing garlic or tomato. Just an assortment of beautifully cooked fresh and tasty seafood in a light and refreshing broth. Fortunately, without even asking for it, some additional bread was delivered to the table to soak up all the remaining broth. Not a drop was left behind...\n\nWe finished the meal with a cheese plate and an order of the chocolate bread pudding.  While the cheese plate contained a trio of wonderful cheeses (and accoutrements), the bread pudding was a tad bit lackluster. Perhaps it was the serving temperature. Not quite hot enough to really bring out all the flavors and decadence of the chocolate.  With that said, we still managed to finish both plates with no serious complaints...\n\nI would have liked to rate Anzu higher than 4 stars but it just wasn't quite at the same caliber as some of the \"over the top\" 5 star dining establishments we've been to recently. But I'd definitely give it 4.5 if that were an option and would not hesitate at all in recommending it if you're in the area and want a beautifully prepared meal accompanied by very attentive and pleasant service. We will definitely be back the next time we're in this neck of the woods.", "author": "Mike M."}

It was on the second floor of Hotel Nikko, and quite honestly, I was annoyed that no one from the hotel asked if we needed help. Not the restaurants fault, but still very confusing.\n\nWe were seated very promptly, and the hostess knew immediately that we were celebrating our anniversary.\n\nFor an appetizer, I ordered the wagyu beef. It was very interesting that they served it with a hot rock, and we prepared it ourselves. Loved the delicacy of the meats, and the promptness of the service to our table.\n\nFor our entree courses, I ordered a roll on the side to share with my girlfriend, and we ordered the Black Cod for myself, and the Duck Breast for her.\n\nFlavor profile was very good on my Black Cod, but for her Duck Breast, it was quite dry (which was expected being white meat).\n\nFor dessert they sent us over a really nice trio of cupcakes that we were able to take home.\n\nWhat gave me such a bad impression in this restaurant was the servers. The way they spoke to us really didn't match the way the restaurant looked. I expected a more sophisticated vocabulary, especially since they had such a great wine list. You could also tell that the servers were inexperienced as one of them even destroyed a complete set of wine glasses all over a turned seat.\n\nIn all though, if I am ever in San Francisco again, the food was okay enough to have me pay another visit.", "author": "Stanley M."}

The hot rock beef was fun, but the rock cools down fast, so don't dawdle on that one.  Dining area ambiance was kind of meh.\n\nComing from Manhattan, I tend to avoid Asian restaurants that don't have Asians in the dining area, but I had a coupon from restaurants.com that I won at a breast cancer cure fundraiser.   It was the first time I tried to use such a coupon and I had two of them, only to be informed that I could only use one of them -- within 30 days!  Not impressed.  I didn't ask for a manager because I didn't want to be a buzzkill for my date, but the server could have offered that I could speak to his manager instead of me having to ask.  \n\nSo I still have a coupon that I can't use anywhere else and apparently I have to go back here to use it since restaurants.com is not responsive to let me use it somewhere else.

We eliminated the list of restaurants based on location since we were planning to check out CB2. This place was actually within walking distance & it had a nice menu, so we decided to come to ANZU for lunch. I made an online reservation the day before because I thought the place might be packed, but when we arrived, there were only 1 or 2 other tables beside us.\n\nThe service was great and speedy - we were seated immediately and they served us our drinks with menu. They also served bread with butter - grain bread (couldn't tell what kind of grain it was) & sourdough. They were both good, and their butter was soft for spreading, which I loved!\n\nFor Done About Town, you get 2 courses at Anzu...\nFirst course, you had 3 choices:  roasted chicken cobb salad, seared sea bass sandwich, or truffle mac 'n cheese\nSecond course (dessert):  pumpkin creme brulee tart, or silver moon ice-cream sundae\n\nWe ended up getting:\n1. Seared sea bass sandwich - Grilled Zucchini, Caramelized Maui Onions, Arugula And Smoked Tomatoes Vinaigrette\n...all the guys ordered this (it's not available right now according to the newest menu for February 2012) with salad/fries. The sandwich was so-so, not really something that blew my mind & it was not that warm by the time I bit into the fish. The salad & fries were great though.\n2. Truffle mac 'n cheese - (elbow pasta) Cooked In A Creamy Truffle Cheese Sauce\n...I didn't want to sucuumb to peer pressure & decided to get the mac 'n cheese for a change. This dish was SUPER delicious & I'm SO glad I didn't get the sandwich like everyone else did! I could NOT wait to get to the bottom of my plate!!!!! I barely let the guys touch any of my pasta when they asked to try my dish, LOL.\n\nAs for dessert:\n1. Pumpkin creme brulee tart - Minced Meat, Blood Orange Coulis\n...again, all the guys ordered the creme brulee & I didn't like it one bit because I dislike pumpkin very much! I've yet to find a pumpkin dessert that I liked (except this one pumpkin bread that my classmate used to make!), so I'm glad I didn't get this dish.\n2. Silver moon ice-cream sundae - Chocolate, Vanilla And Strawberry Ice Cream Cr\u00e8me Chantilly, Almonds And Banana, Griottes, Chocolate & Caramel Sauce \n...this was my dessert & again, I completely loved it! Very standard sundae dessert and it surpasses the creme brulee so much that I think I may be over-exaggerating about just how good this dessert was.\n\nOverall, I completely enjoyed my selection of both courses, while the guys all got the short end of the stick. Not sure if we will come back anytime soon just because we try to stay away from the city (because of traffic/parking, etc.), but I would definitely try this place again for their other food selections (main menu & sushi bar) if I'm ever in the area in the future!", "author": "Cathy W."}

More sushi, Tortellini pasta, Duck, Chive Crusted Filet of Beef, Misoyaki Black Cod.  Everything was cooked to perfection!  The cod literally melted in my mouth.

However, the experience was underwhelming.\n\nWe arrived at 8pm for dinner on a Sunday night. The first thing I noticed was the odd seating arrangement. Our server directed us to a table right next to a couple yelling their conversation aloud, even though other guests were more spaciously seated from each other. We could have simply asked to be moved so the fault is on us here, too.\n\nI ordered the four course dinner, listed as $41. I carefully picked my selection for the appetizer and entree, and then our server recited it back.\n\nWhen the first dish arrived, which was a poke, I saw a miniature cone with poke and tomato bits that resembled a miniature Lego set. Expected, I suppose, for high end dining like this. But, maybe not.\n\nThen, the server brought a champagne to the table and placed it in front of me. He said it came with the meal and asked me to enjoy it. I thought, oh, it must be free champagne. But right before I sipped it, I vaguely remembered a $60something version of the four course menu. We clearly stated at the beginning of the dinner that we wouldn't be having alcohol tonight as well. I told the server this politely and he looked nervous, then took the champagne away.\n\nAnyways, after this, the food came out in a timely manner. I had the pistachio dusted salmon. The dusted bit was really salty. On the side, there was a sticky black rice drizzled in a milky white, salty sauce. It was a strange flavor but I liked the texture.\n\nI think I would have liked another entree. Their ingredients are fresh and clean but my choices probably weren't the best they had there, so that's partly my own selection error. I think the food deserves a four-star rating.\n\nI also ran into a server who dampened my impression with his sneaky service, which resulted in my three star rating.", "author": "Sandy D."}

They also seated my bf and me in the corner which is definitely a plus. It gave us a sense of privacy and intimacy that you normally won't get at a restaurant.\n\nI got the 4-course meal for $45. It included an amuse-bouche, soup or salad, main entree, and dessert. For the amuse-bouche, I got a nice piece of hamachi. It almost reminded me of the hamachi shots from Alexander's Steakhouse. I also got the French Onion soup, which was quite good. I was very surprised considering the fact that I normally don't like to eat onions whether they're cooked or not. As for the main entree, i opted for the 38 duck breast. The duck breast was actually bigger and meatier than I thought. As for the dessert, it was this coffee cake with a chocolate macaroon. Oh. Because we were celebrating my birthday, they gave me their special lava cake with dry ice as a complimentary dessert. The boyfriend got the filet mignon and the ANZU Special Roll. \n\nThe food was delicious, but I must say, their service definitely exceeded my expectation. The place is also very modern and sleek looking. I was very satisfied and pleased with the whole dining experience. \n\nI am definitely coming back!!", "author": "Victoria H."}

The service was great and the food was good, but it lacked creativity in some respects.  It's also quite pricey for what it is and compared to a lot of places in the city.\n\nWe had the crudo, scallops and lamb.  The crudo was good, light, fresh but lacked some flavor.  The scallops were forgettable, not the best preparation at all.  The lamb was on the fatty side but well cooked.  The mac and cheese we ordered as a side, came after all the food, after they even cleared our dishes, that was a major fail and they didn't seem to think anything of it.  \n\nThere are much better places in SF.", "author": "Inga W."}

They should have used edamame instead of peas as a garnish though.\n- attentive service\n- the cupcake at the end is a really nice touch\n\ncons:\n- unless you are in coming in for a promotion, the prices are quite expensive for what you get (which actually isn't a surprise for a hotel in downtown SF after all)\n- the bread service was a nice touch, but didn't add much to the meal since it wasn't that good; if an upscale restaurant wants to serve bread, it should be freshly baked\n- the menu can be misleading...I ordered the \"Yosonabe\" which typically would have an Asian broth (miso / soy sauce), but it was really much more like a cioppino,  This is probably because of the restaurant's schizophrenia of supposedly not being a Japanese restaurant (they are \"Californian\") and yet having heavy Japanese influences (the sushi bar fooled me).  The dish was ok (I wouldn't get it again), but it was not what I was expecting, and it wasn't a pleasant surprise.\n\neven with the cons, I'm still a fan of the nice atmosphere and attentive service, so I'd come back if I were in the neighborhood.", "author": "Jimmy W."}

When we arrived, we were greeted and seated. The staff were very polite and nice. \n\nBeing underage we couldn't order any alcoholic drinks so we stuck with water. The water service was amazing! We never had to say a word, the staff filled it up when ever it was low. \n\nAfter a few minutes, we finally decided on the grasshopper roll for starters. I ordered the free range chicken and my boyfriend ordered the Kobe steak. \n\nWhile we waited for our food, we were given sourdough rolls. The bread was yummy. We sat there waiting and waiting but nothing came yet. Not even our roll came yet. We were disappointed because people who ordered AFTER us, got their food before us. I suspect that they weren't taking us seriously because we were just two kids in an expensive restaurant. \n\nAnyways, after a longgggg time, we finally got the roll. It wasn't as good as I expected it to be, there was barely any avocado or unagi in the roll. I was SERIOUSLY inspecting the roll, only to find small pieces of unagi hiding above the tempura...And  the rice had wayyyyy too much vingear in it so it was gross...\n\nThe entrees came and my boyfriend's steak was amazing but my chicken was rather bland. The kobe steak was delicious and the fries were seasoned just right. My chicken tasted like nothing...and the potatoes, asparagus and mushroom were bland as well. \n\nAll in all, I doubt we'd come back, but if we do, it would be for the steak.", "author": "Kelly L."}

Our first visit, some years ago, was enough for us to look forward to returning.\n\nIt can't quite step away from being a hotel restaurant in the theater district.  Given that, it's really quite good.\n\nThey've been running a five course prix fixe menu in celebration of their 25th year of operation, and it's pretty popular.  Mostly smaller versions of things that are available elsewhere on the menu.\n\nThe amuse - the ahi blossom - a tuna/scallop preparation in a spoon - was nicely flavored with a surprisingly spicy kick.  Brentwood Corn and Lobster Chowder was again well balanced, with strong lobster presence, though none of the advertised shrimp relish and barely detectable mushroom components.  The roasted root vegetable salad was a light intermezzo - we had ordered the dressing on the side, but saw at other tables that it is really not overdressed - flavor of the parsnips and beets is quite mild.  The Misoyaki Smoked Black Cod was just excellent.  \"The Fog\" dessert turned out mildly heavy, but with a cool dry ice effect that allows forgiveness.\n\nA wine pairing is available with the menu - mostly lower end stuff, with the exception of a Willamette Valley Pinot or higher-end Cab offered with the main course.  Unfortunately, we were poured a significantly lesser pinot noir without any explanation.\n\nOf course, we just got one tasting menu, ordering from the main menu for the rest of the courses.  The Watermelon Tian is beautiful and light, and the flavors really work well together.  The Octopus Soppressata was artfully plated and not threatening at all ( we do like our cephalopods ).  Lobster Raviolo came with really well prepared sweetbreads.  We also got a roll - El Mondragon - not quite up to the standard as far as flavor goes, but unobjectionable.\n\nDespite a couple lapses as far as menu description fidelity goes, the food is prepared to a high standard, and the service is friendly and accommodating.

There are a lot of choices near Union Square and I decided on ANZU because I had a Restaurant gift certificate for $50 off $100 and I got 1,000 points for reserving on OpenTable. I also looked at their menus online and they looked both imaginative and familiar. I made a good choice! The atmosphere was modern with several lighted panels of bubbling water. We ordered the four-course dinner with wine pairings because we thought it was a good value at $65 per person. However, the first course was an amuse so it was really a three-course dinner. All of the food was attractively presented, flavorful, and fresh. The wine selections were nicely paired with each course. I especially enjoyed the Hahn Pinot Noir. I would have given ANZU five stars, but there were a couple of service issues: we waited a little too long to place our order; we did not receive our wine pairings with our entr\u00e9es until about five minutes later; and our server did not check back on each course to make sure everything was okay.

For $16, it didn't stand out and looked like a sushi roll you can get at the supermarket. For entree, I ordered the salmon which was very ordinary however the vegetables on the side were pretty good. The portions overall seemed to be a tad too small for me. For dessert, I ordered the white chocolate because I read wasabi green apple sorbet.

The location is a huge benefit because the Hotel Nikko is an elegant hotel so if you are trying to impress someone the walk through the hotel lobby area to the restaurant makes a great first impression.  We visited Anzu twice in the last six days and I have decided to break my review into two parts: (1) Service and (2) food.\n\nService\n\nIt is clear that from the top down an emphasis on service is reinforced daily.  Our first server was Chris who was a real pro. He explains a menu as if he wrote it and freely offers suggestions throughout the meal. He was personable yet professional and his attention to detail was especially noteworthy. His helper (for lack of a better term) was David. If James Brown was the hardest working man in show business, David is the hardest working man at Anzu. Our second server was Stina. Stina has a warm smile, a great accent and a personality to match. Her right-hand man was Kay, a real cheerful man from Macau. There is no way you will go without water or Anzu's great bread if Kay is around.  I also noticed that everyone helps. The employees here are not territorial at all. If something needs to be done the first available person gets to it.\n\nThe Food\n\nChef Laurent Berthon really understands how to present food so bring your camera. For starters you absolutely will not go wrong with the kampachi carpaccio, the ebi, or the hamachi crudo. Do not, I repeat, do not leave this restaurant without trying the baked cherry stone clams. If I were a girl I would say \"they were to die for,\" since I am not I will simply say the presentation was excellent and they were \"off the hook!\"\n\nTo my mind, the choice of a main course starts and ends with the wagyu beef onglet (pronounced \"on lay\"). This dish is akin to Japan's Kobe Beef and it was some of the most succulent beef I have ever smacked my lips on. The presentation is awesome and I would suggest that you get it rare.  The side dishes were served family style. I would get the truffle mac 'n' cheese and the garlic noodles. The menu advertises the spinach as spicy. I thought it was good but it clearly was not spicy. I would try the roasted marble potatoes and although the label \"blue lake green beans\" sounds exotic, I would probably shy away from them because mine were bland.  Finally, take my advice and forgo the dessert menu. You will not need it. Just order \"the fog\" a wonderful chocolate dessert presented with dry ice that will make the heads at the surrounding tables turn.\n\nI had a terrific time at Anzu and this is a great place to eat prior to going to the Rrazz Room.", "author": "Chocoolate I."}

Unfortunately, the bar can't keep up with the kitchen, and our cocktails arrived after our truffle/hamachi starter and paired wine tasting!  We mentioned this to the waiter who apologized because he was from New York (what does that have to do with anything?).  I can tell you that a martini following cruda with sparkling wine is not as interesting as the other way around.  Timing continued to be bad, in the case of the wine with the main course of duck breast, it arrived some 15 minutes after our food.  My husband ordered the four course prix fixe, so the kitchen staff should have known timing.  Our dessert took an additional 30 minutes, although we ordered it at the same time as our cocktails.   There is something wrong with this, and yet there are abundant staff running around looking very busy.  Four people at restaurant reception alone, and at least three bartenders.  Perhaps they just need a more efficient bartender?  The food was good, but not San Francisco great.  The sushi was largely uninspired, but the other proteins were good quality.  The space was very, very noisy, and it was difficult to hear my husband sitting next to me.   I can see why this has been a 1000 point Open Table spot for years.", "author": "Shelly D."}

Everyone- absolutely - everyone loved the food, the hospitality, the light and relaxing atmosphere. The guests didn't have to worry about a thing. It started the wedding festivities on a great foot. The Miso Cod was absolutely to die for. The sushi, the sashimi, the soup, the appetizer \"the rock\". All fantastic. The decor was stunning, the entrance grand, the casual lobby chairs that are an elegant white leather. All of it was absolutely amazing. Anzu alone would deserve 5 stars, but what set's Anzu above and beyond the rest is its staff. \n\nThe absolute star of Anzu though- Marcia Striffeler, who is the event planner and whose husband is the executive chef. We first met Marcia as we were considering Hotel Nikko for a hotel block for the wedding. We then had lunch at Anzu and ended up choosing Anzu (over Cityhouse, Farallon, Yank Sing, and a number of other locations) for the prewedding event. Marcia always made us feel welcome and loved. I wish I could go on about her- We loved her so much, we were considering inviting her to our wedding. \n\nShe helped set us up with a honeymoon room in the hotel, gave us signed copies of Anzu's chef book, set up a food tasting for four, was there personally to supervise the event, calmed us when we freaked out, arranged the tables so everyone was together, advised us on things to do and order, what food will work, and how it will work. She emailed us afterwards, sent us a holiday card, and took care of us each time we returned to Anzu for another meal. We would go to any restaurant where she worked.

I'm not big on knowing famous or great chefs... but I took the yelpers' word for it =P  Regardless of your certificate, you're bound to pay like an extra $70 out of pocket.  The restaurant is in Hotel Nikko, which is in Union Sq.  It's a really nice hotel, and thus, a really nice restaurant, small but nice.  When you walk in, there's a sushi/oyster bar just past the hostess station and in the lounge area.\n\nWe got the appetizer called \"the ROCK\".  It's a pretty cool concept!  They heat up this black rock to a reallllllly high temperature, so high that you can see the steam coming off of it when it comes out.  You cook strips of sirloin on the rock and dip it into 3 different kinds of sauces.  The rock only stays hot for about 6 minutes, and begins to cool down.  I wish they gave you more meat... but nonetheless, it was really good.... and cost an arm and a leg ($18 for the appetizer)!\n\nFor our entrees, we got the miso black cod with risotto in broth.  THIS WAS O-M-F-G  DELICIOUS!!!!!  I really enjoyed this dish.  The fish was cooked perfectly, and had lots of flavor.  To be exact, it is:\nSMOKED BLACK COD \nsmoked misoyaki black cod fillet, kabocha pumpkin and sage risotto, \nhonshimeji mushrooms, edamame, truffle dashi / 27 \n\nWe also got the filet mignon with sweet potatoes, which was ok...  The meat was a little dry, and I would have liked for it to be a little more tender.\n\nThe food was really good overall, and the service was excellent.  I would love to come here again if I had more money =P  With the Restaurant.com gift certificate, I still paid $70 for 1 appetizer and 2 entrees for 2 people.  \n\nParking can be difficult, but you can park about 1-2 blocks away towards the TL and just walk over.

So we made reservations the week before. \n\nWe got all dressed up looking forward to going to place that has been described as The Place To Be. \n\nWe got there on-time, walked inside the restaurant and the sitting area near was very nice, very clean, but cramped. Then there was the back area which was actually nicer due to the window area. We were seated kind of close to the KBLX (102.9 FM) table. But then here came the problems: \n\n* (CRAMPED) In a continued flow of people were walking back and forth behind my husband, which angered him, so the hostess moved use to another area, it was a little better. \n\n* (BUFFET AREA) For the extremely high price ($50 a piece not including tip, toll and parking garage) there wasn't a good selection of food. When I think of brunch, I think of breakfast (scrambled eggs, waffles, grits, bacon, sausage, etc) and lunch (crab legs, prawns, shrimp salad, tossed salad, fruit salad, chicken, lamb, crab cakes, salmon, pork chops, rice, etc) There wasn't hardly anything I saw eye-catching! My husband got the duck which he said was\"ok!\" I got prawns and the tuna and that was \"OK!\" \n\n* (WAITERS) At first the champagne was flowing, but after being there for about 45 minutes, it started to slow down. I don't know but I think after some time the waiters are told to slow down at certain tables so people can leave; flow of traffic. \n\n* (RADIO PERSONALITY) We thought by the way Nikki Thomas would speak about the people, the food and entire atmosphere she was walking and talking to the crowd. She was just sitting in here radio area for the entire time we were there,. \n\nSUGGESTIONS: For the high cost, have more room for folks to sit and be more comfortable. \n\nHave a large variety of food, including the desserts like plain NY style cheesecake, pound cake, cobblers, etc. Since it was Valentine's Day Sunday there should have been fresh strawberry shortcake with whip cream. \n\nAllow people to enjoy the food and such since the cost is SO HIGH! Be just a attentive towards the end as you were in the beginning with the champagne. \n\nMs. Thomas, please walk around and talk to the people at the tables. I know, some folks don't like being disturbed while eating, but most want to meet you and tell others listening to KABUL that they're at the ANZU. \n\nA good place to look to is Hs Lordships in Berkeley, Ca.

It was ex-actly like eating in one of those run of the mill buffet joints- the only difference is, there's better variety at one of those cheapo places and the organization is better. \n\nSome other gripes include, but are not limited to; every time we got up to do anything the staff was trying to shuffle us out the door, the art hanging on the wall was very off putting (yes, I said off putting...) the decor is like a Pier 1 threw up, looks classy, but cold and boring.\n\nMe and The Girl flew all the way to San Francisco to spend Christmas alone and this didn't ruin our trip in the least- but it will be a footnote to trips in the future... \n\nThe Girl: \"Remember that time we went to that crappy buffet in San Francisco that you picked out?\" \n\nMe: \"Yes, Honey.

It was spicy tuna, avacado, I had to take the sliver of jalapeno off on a couple of the pieces b/c it was so spicy. \nI had the Creamy Basil Risotto, which was very good. It was topped with roasted salsify (it's a root vegeable - i had to google it) and sauteed swiss chard. The risotti was cooked perfect. The salsify was chewy, but I don't know if that's just how it is or b/c of the how it was cooked.  My mom raved about her Pork Belly Pot Roast in pinot noir sauce and she is not an easy one to please. I haven't eaten pork in about 15 years, but she made it sound so good, i had to give it a try.

You can't order any of the specials available to the sushi bar and omakase (chef's choice) is also only available at the sushi bar. The selections are your standard nigiris like maguro, sake, hamachi, ebi, and unagi. The only interesting choice was snow crab. \n\nAll that said, the sushi we had was quite delicious and our waiter slipped us some fresh wasabi because I think we looked so sad!

The stark, bright lighting feels more like a cheap cafeteria than a nice place to spend Christmas dinner with my family. The waitstaff was inattentive and oblivious. They did do a good job clearing plates when you step out to get more food, but beyond that the service was very lackluster.\n\nThe food: The buffet was located in the hallway, so to get your food you are constantly exiting the restaurant then waiting behind people checking in for dinner to get back in. The food itself was average at best; all things I can make better at home. And, for $65 a piece...such a disappointment.\n\nI will not be returning and am frankly surprised how Anzu is still in business in a place like San Francisco with such awful food.

Purple right down the middle.  I ordered Medium Rare and I ate two pieces and then asked for a box.  The wait staff who started collecting plates asked if i wanted to box it myself or have him box it.  I said it doesn't matter and he waited for two seconds before giving me a look of indifference and leaving with the plate.  At this point the bar downstairs started cranking out music which made it sound like there was a lowrider cruising by with blown out subwoofers.  Madness.\n\nFifteen minutes later we had to ask for our dessert and the wait staff said that its coming.  Five seconds later it pops up to our table.  Coincidence?

We were able to walk from our hotel so it was nice not to have to worry about parking.  The tables in the restaurant are pretty close together so I had to talk louder than I like for my boyfriend to hear me since the people right next to us were pretty loud as well.  We started off with a bottle (yes, bottle- apparently this was a very special dinner) with Merlot.  When they brought the wine, they let me taste it to make sure it was what I wanted which I appreciated.  Bread was given out before meals, but it took a long time for someone to notice we weren't served bread yet and we got the bread minutes before our meal.  Both of us ordered the filet mignon for dinner.  I got truffle mac n' cheese with mine and he got mashed potatoes with his.  I have no complaints about the food.  Both steaks were cooked how we wanted them.  One thing they could have done though was have us check our meat right when we got our plate to make sure it was how we wanted it just in case it wasn't what we ordered.  Luckily, we did not have that problem.   With our entrees, we were also given a complimentary vegetarian sushi roll piece.  It had asparagus and sweet potato in it for sure and I enjoyed it.  My boyfriend did not try his as he was pretty full.  For dessert, I got \"The Fog.\"  It was described as dark chocolate cake, banana creme and butterscotch.  What I got was chocolate mouse wrapped in a very thin layer of cake with banana creme on the plate and barely a drop of butterscotch on top of the cake.  It was good, but I probably would not have ordered it if I had known it had mousse.  My boyfriend got the lemon raspberry trifle which he really enjoyed.

The veal cheeks were flavorful, but a little one note, as the sauce really was the strongest flavor.\n\nEntrees were American Waygu Onglet (with an asked for substitution of the truffled scalloped potatoes) and Pork Belly Pot Roast.

To be honest the server did remind us that it had bacon in it, but we didn't really expect it to be so savory.  Mixed with the icecream and whipped cream, it was OK, but not really my taste.  Partially a bad dessert and partially a bad selection on my part, I'll split the difference with them.\n\nWe brought wine and the corkage was $30, a bit high, even for SF, but not the worst I've seen.\n\nWe also didn't try any of the sushi, which looked good and was ordered by quite a few people around us.\n\nOh yeah, one more thing.  The have a dish call \"The Rock\" which is a very hot, very large, river stone on which diners place pieces of thinly sliced beef.  It is a little strange, and actually sounds like sizzling fajitas and makes a bit of an oily smoke on the restaurant.

So for her birthday, we took her to Anzu for Sunday brunch. \n\nWhat a disappointment! The $58 per person plus tax & tips buffet brunch was not worth it at all. For the kind of money for the 4 of us, we would have been better off buying a $39 air ticket on Virgin America and flying to Las Vegas and have brunch at the Bellagio Hotel and come back on the same day. \n\nThe buffet spread was so badly lacking in varieties that it was almost like an after thought. When we were there, the 5 feet buffet tables consisted of:\n\n1. Typical breakfast items: scramble eggs, bacons, sausage, French toasts, breakfast potatoes and bagels.  Nothing you can't make at home for less money.\n\n2. Cold cuts: skinny shrimps cocktails, smoked salmons, a mini salad stations. Nothing fancy there. \n\n3. Sushi: 2 kinds of sashimis sliced so thinly that we can see thru the fish, a huge vegetable futomaki roll and some tuna maki. I had high expectation for Japanese food especially when the restaurant is in the Nikko Hotel. \n\n4. Hot items: halibut pan seared and served over white cream sauce. The fish was overcooked and they were tough after being in the heated platter.  \n\n5. Desserts: fruits and about 5 kinds including cheesecake, carrot cakes, lemon cake, banana cream pie and sweet potatoes pies that all tasted like they bought it from a bakery distributor. Boring choices and nothing to write home about. \n\nThere was no meat carving stations, omelet or crepe stations made to order. \n\nThe Jazz was a snore. They setup a broadcasting station right in the dining room where the DJ broadcasted live Jazz thru the KBLX channel. My aunt was under the impression that it was a LIVE Jazz performance. In my opinion, there was something distasteful about watching the DJ does her show and seeing her fake expression when she was on air and as soon as the microphone is off, she immediately switch-off her \"radio face.\"  Throughout the broadcast, the DJ bragged about the food at Anzu particularly the buffet as if she had never tasted better food in her life, but I didn't see any sincerity coming from her. \n\nAlthough my aunt was not impressed with the brunch, but she got her desire fulfilled for that afternoon even though we left the Nikko Hotel disappointed and our stomachs dissatisfied.

After all, it is the Quiet Storm. Located on the Nikko Hotel's mezzanine level, we walked to the podium and the hostess quickly seated us in the main dining room. The buffet arrangement is a bit odd as the food stations are located along the walkway outside of the restaurant. Being a pretty narrow path, we were lucky that the restaurant was only moderately full. Maneuvering from the breakfast foods, hot lunch foods, salads, seafood bar, and dessert table, I found the selection to be just okay. There was sushi, but no crab. There were decent sized prawns with cocktail sauce and the standard lox and bagels. The hot foods were not memorable, save the prime rib at the carving station and omelet station. Can't complain about the price as my friend used a gift certificate and covered the rest of the bill for our party of four. The waiter was diligent in refilling our juice and water glasses as well as removing finished plates. The only minor flub was when the waiter mistook the gift certificate's issue date for an expiration date. He checked with the manager and the problem was resolved.

My boyfriend made the reservations on open table, requested a private table and they placed us in the corner of the restaurant. We had privacy, excellent meal, exceptional service, I can't express enough how wonderful our experience was. Also, the decor is amazing!

The food was good, but it's one of those pretentious places that thinks throwing food on a fancy plate is going to make it worth $10 more than it really is.  We had a poke/chip appetizer, oysters on the half shell, rack of lamb with quinoa, and I forget what else.  The good thing was none of the food was smelly no fishy or gamey smell, presentation was nice I would give it 3 stars, but.... \n\nthe second time we went was on a Sunday evening it was not busy at all, our server was very dimwitted quiet speaking caucasian male. He served another table their food that got there after we did. It took a long time to get our second course after finishing our first which was the Rock cooked meat on a hot rock, which was a nice presentation, the meat wasn't great they could have used tri-tip instead of kobe steak and I wouldn't have known the difference, the second course was sushi. 6 cuts of fish and a roll which should have taken no time at all. He forgot the miso soup that came with the platter, and when the bill came he charged us for food and cupcakes that we did not order. It must have been from the family that got their food before us even though they came later. On top of that he overcharged us for our sushi items. \n\nHe said the prices changed that day, but the menu did not reflect it. I made him change it anyway because he didn't say and the menu didn't say either. The sushi was already overpriced for basic tuna, salmon, hamachi, unagi, shrimp, whitefish at 28$ they wanted to charge 32$ for that plate! The other was a roll they wanted to charge $16 instead of $14 for. Not only did he want to charge for food we didn't order, he forgot the miso soup that came with the platter, and wanted to overcharge for food as well. Needless to say I paid him in an even dollar amount leaving him 14 cents tip. The last thing he said because he saw my girlfriend writing a long critique on the back of the receipt was, \"At least let me give you a discount,\" AFTER I already put my money down.\n\nOn a slow night there's no excuse to give such poor service especially in an upscale restaurant. Had he said he was new there that may have changed my opinion, but he didn't so this restaurant is a FAIL! The only way a restaurant can get away with bad service is if their food is worth the money they charge for it, but this place was not.", "author": "may n."}

We were initially seated at some fold out tables in the middle of the restaurant despited the fact that there was plenty of regular seating available. They gladly moved us upon request but come on people the place is nearly empty (12:30 res).\n\nThe food is average at best... definitely not worth the price.  I've gotten the same quality breakfast/brunch buffet at Hyatt Suites on business trips (and that food is complimentary).  The pancakes, omelets, sausage and bacon were tasty.  As you know, all of these items can be found at your local breakfast spot. None of the food was particularly bad but certainly wasn't impressive.  The bottomless mimosas are made w/ $7 champagne; they fill your glass w/ juice and add a dash of champagne (I only use juice for color in my mimosas LOL). Let me be clear-I have no issue spending $50 on a meal but I left feeling gipped.\n\nThey tried but sorely missed the mark. \n\nOn another note... this is a buffet so all the work the \"servers\" do is bring you drinks and help the bus staff clear the table yet they automatically add 18% tip on all tabs.

Surprise number 2, it's nestled away in a quiet corner of the hotel, which made the dining experience more relaxing. Surprise number 3, the menu is not just sushi, but also a blend of Japanese, American and I'm not sure what you call cooking Kobe beef on a rock at the table style. We started with the house special rolls, (the Anzu YUM). My husband was intrigued by the rock cooking, so he ordered that item. A black oval rock is delivered to your table at a zillion degrees. You are advised not to touch it. You place surgically slice pieces of raw Kobe beef onto the sizzling rock and turn them to your liking. Then you dip them in one of three sauces. It was fun and as my husband said, right up my alley because I do all the grilling in the family. The next course I had salmon encrusted with pistachios and black rice with an egg I had to look up (Jidori, a very special chicken) and kizami wasabe beurre blanc sauce with a sprinkling of vegies. Divine. My husband raved about his cod in black truffle sauce and said it was like butter fish. Wine was reasonably priced, service attentive and with good humor.

Only about a third of the tables were filled and the bar was completely empty. There were many employees walking around but none acknowledged us. Finally the woman in front of me asked for some assistance and a woman (girl actually probably around 17) came over. She sat the couple down and again ignored me.

I told him I had only ordered one and he said \"Oh, I guess you get an extra one free then.\" I thought that was nice, but moments later a middle aged woman swooped in (she had obviously been watching the event transpire) and grabbed the soup out from in front of me and took it to the back without even looking at me, let alone  apologizing!

The quantity of food and large array of choices is stellar but I won't go as far as to say the food itself is stellar by any means.  You can grub on deep fried oysters, so-so sushi, omelets galore, waffles, potatoes, etc.  For buffet food, edible and didn't taste like cardboard, which is saying alot.\n\nYou do get unlimited all you can drink mimosas as well.  Lovely mimosas.  I spent a good four hours here, making sure I drank every possible drop of champagne for my $45, cause the food sure as hell wasn't worth my scrilla.  \n\nI avoid buffets and everytime I get suckered into going to one, I feel disappointed and ripped off.  Just like when I go to music festivals and the two bands (out of 15 bands) that I wanted to see only play 5 songs each and then I have to subject my precious ears to crap loads of music that makes me wish I could slit my wrists.  Not worth it.\n\nBut if you are a person who can eat like a fat kid and guzzle booze like a homeless man, then Anzu should be your destination one of these Sundays.  \n\nI will stick to Lime for all you can drink mimosas.", "author": "Christina S."}

Upon arrival,we wondered where the employees were and thought we should seat ourselves. As soon as we moved towards a table,out comes the little greeter(obviously returning from a trip to the restroom) and she seats us.\nWell,first thing I noticed was this place was not very busy considering the KBLX schmoozing,and like another reviewer mentioned,you can say a quick \"Hello\" to Nikki,but that's about it.She doesn't mingle with the customers and my only thought is that's because on live radio,you run the risk of people telling you just what's on their mind.Imagine being in a restaurant you're supposed to be promoting and someone blurts out,\"This ain't no better than Hometown Buffet!Pffft!\"\nAnd they wouldn't be grandiose in their opinion,because that's exactly how I felt as far as the food goes. I did enjoy the potatoes,lamb,and sausage...but as others have stated,for the prices,you expect way more choices. Where was the chicken?Eggs Benedict,anyone?How about a ham or turkey to go with the prime rib,since you're carving meats?\nI realize it's a Japanese hotel/restaurant,so I suppose the brunch menu is limited..I'm giving 3 stars based on our server,who kept the champagne comin'..he saw how heated I was about the traffic when we got there,and WOO!!Suddenly,I don't recall how bad the traffic was,imagine that!And seriously,how could I complain when we had our brunch courtesy of KBLX?Oh and before you judge,I slipped the waiter a nice tip,even though the certificate included it,I appreciated him and the champagne that much!", "author": "Delance J."}

I happen to like the colors and furnishings (good textiles throughout the hotel), although I wouldn't say it's romantic in any way.  The lobby of the hotel is sleek and sterile, so it does feel warm in comparison to that, but I would not say cozy.\n\nService:  OK, not great.  There were a few misses like forgetting hot water for my friend's tea a couple of times, and confusion as to which person got what.  Also, there is a dessert on the menu that takes 30 minutes to prepare, and you should not find that out upon receiving the dessert menu - it should be at the start of the meal or at least 30 minutes before you might want to eat it.  This is a pretty expensive restaurant, so my expectation for the service is moderately high.\n\nFood - Overall very, very good - I had the corn/dungeness crab soup to start, which I had heard was delicious.  It was good, although a bit bland.  And the shallow bowl caused it to cool down much too quickly - I had bites that were nearly cold. The crab itself was tender and flavorful.  Our friends shared the poke appetizer (poke 3 ways) which was wonderful - I would get this next time.  My husband had the bean/sausage soup which was spicy and good.  \n\nFor my entree, I had the stuffed halibut which was excellent.  It had such a mix of flavors going on - halibut, shrimp, crab, citrus, melted brie, mashed potatoes - odd choices, but somehow it all worked together beautifully.  I tasted my husband's steak with the Bearnaise sauce that he had raved about to me, and it was well-cooked and very tender with great flavor, especially the sauce.\n\nWe split the Chocolate Chip Banana Bread Pudding for dessert - just OK.  I really wanted that hot chocolate dessert, but no one including me wanted to hang around for an additional 30 minutes longer.\n\nOverall, 3.5 stars.  The food was good enough to go back for, but the limited menu choices and the service left me feeling slightly underwhelmed.  I'll go back for the brunch.", "author": "Liz S."}

I had one of those restaurant.com vouchers where you get a $25 credit toward food if you spend at least $40.  I browsed virtually all the restaurant.com listings, actively seeking a place not too far from my work where I could go for lunch.  Most all restaurants other than taco shops clearly stated in the \"Add To Cart\" window: \"Valid for dinner ONLY.\"  The Anzu listing did not (and still does not) say that, so I bought their voucher and scheduled a lunch.  When I got seated at the restaurant with a friend, however, I noticed that the voucher said \"Minimum purchase $40 and 2 dinner entrees.\"  Our menu was a lunch menu, and the waitress said dinner entrees were unavailable.  Uh oh.  (It sort of reminded me of that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Ratner takes Stacy on a first date to the German restaurant with the huge chairs, and realizes he's forgotten his wallet.  But I digress.)  So I whipped out the voucher and explained that I'd purchased it thinking it could be used at lunch.  The waitress said she'd talk to the manager and left.  I waited, all geared up for an ugly confrontation over how the voucher's terms and conditions were ambiguous and misleading, they needed to honor it for lunch, etc., cause I sometimes can't help being an asshole that way.  But the manager walks out and says \"no problem, we'll honor it.\"  So, that's a long-winded way of saying: Big points for customer service! \n\n2.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.\n\n3.  The food was excellent.  I had a real good salmon, and my friend had sort of a bento box with seared ahi and a variety of other things.  Great flavors and great presentation.\n\n4.  The hotel lobby that we walked through was festive (a live piano player; cute holiday displays) and the restaurant itself was very nice inside.\n\nThe bad: a bit pricey for lunch (the voucher sure helped, as the salmon and bento box were each twenty bucks, with drinks, etc. being extra; sandwiches on the menu averaged about fifteen), and I ordered an Irish Coffee at the end that was pretty bad (but maybe that's bad on me for ordering that drink in a Japanese fusion restaurant??).  Overall though, I would definitely recommend this place as a fine lunch or dinner option if you're in the area.  Heck, it's probably even worth a special trip.", "author": "Chuck P."}

When we arrived, they asked if they could move us from a 5-top to a 4-top. I asked whether it would fit a highchair and they assured us that it would. Well, they seated us at a TINY square table WAY in the back. I was annoyed because a toddler in a highchair takes up the place of a WHOLE PERSON and who in their right mind would seat 5 people at a square table??? In addition, you can't put a toddler in a highchair on a corner of a table (Hello, sharp corners!), so I ended up sitting on the corner with the leg of the table in my way, spending the whole time in crisis-management mode since EVERYTHING was in my son's reach at such a tiny table.\n\nI was already annoyed when they came back and asked if they could move us to ANOTHER 4-top table.

We had heard so much about ANZU via KBLX that we were looking forward to trying it out.\n\nFirstly, the dining room had been over packed with tables and the large screen TV was on.  Apparently, no one had noticed this little detail when they flipped the room for dinner.  We exited the dining room to the lobby mezzanine where the buffet was set up.  We had read the menu in advance and looked forward to trying the salads before having dinner.  We walked all the way around the mezzanine to the end of the long line to get our plates.  We were immediately face to face with gravy followed by the mashed potatoes and roasted turkey with stuffing.  Puzzling, as gravy typically goes over these items and you had to reverse to get to the gravy after you'd already gotten your turkey, stuffing and potatoes.  After stepping over everyone behind us to get our gravy, we proceeded down the line to the fish, osso bucco, cauliflower, etc.  Where were the salads?  I set my plate down at our little table and then did a tour around the dining room on a search for the salads.  My search was fruitless.\n\nIn the meantime, the very inexperienced server had repeatedly asked us why we weren't drinking alcohol.  Was it really any of his business?  Surely, if we wanted to drink we would have made that clear to him.  It's not like he was actively selling a special holiday cocktail.\n\nAfter visiting the buffet line again, I noticed that the salads had been conveniently located between the Sushi and main courses in the middle of the buffet line.  Mind you the sushi and Dim Sum were right next to the desserts and  chocolate fountain. \n\nThe food was absolutely sub par.  The entrees were cold at best.  The Osso Bucco dry and tough. There were no sauce dishes for the sushi or dim sum.  The desserts were stale.\n\nThe mezzanine buffet line area is way to small for this large a crowd.  On more than one occasion we were involved in full on crashes complete with splashed sauces.  The order of the foods was not correct and required diners to change their paths and rudely cut in line to get what they wanted.  Wouldn't it make sense that Sushi, Salads and DIm Sum would be ahead of main courses.\n\nWhy would you place desserts next to Dim Sum?  Better yet, why would you create an island with a chocolate fountain where it would be most likely to create a traffic jam for those either coming or returning from the buffet line?\n\nTo add insult to injury, the servers were so concerned about packing people into the dining room and squeezing in another table, that they didn't even notice that they had backed into me and spilled soy sauce on my new cashmere sweater.\n\nAll in all, this was an embarrassing moment  for a hotel of such standing.  Regardless of the cost of the meal, this experience demonstrated that ANZU is not worth our patronage.\n\n\nSuch a shame...", "author": "Perry V."}

Not that I've been around or anything, but me and sushi have always held a dear relationship that Anzu served only to strengthen. Apparently they fly their fish in from Boston/Japan? Craziness. \n\nDinner:\n\n- Starter: Misoyaki Prawns (essentially to die for)\n- Rolls: temura rolls, tekka maki, crab (tekka melts in your mouth)\n- Sashimi: Sake (OMG like butter - best sashimi I have ever had next to  this place in Chicago)\n- Meat: Kobe Steak - (This was just amazing. Perfectly cooked/scrumptious sauce).\n\nDrinks:\n\n- The cucumber martinis were yummy - they are essentially cucumber gin gimlets (my drink of choice)\n-You MUST try the raspberry ginger ail. It is essentially made with at least 1/3 raspberry pulp. It's to die for. On a side note: why is there a 'p' in raspberry?! \n\nBrunch:\n\n-Egh. We had coupons given to us for staying in the imperial club room. Worth about 20 bucks. It was yummy but not fabulous. Random samples from the buffet include: lox, bagels, eggs (pretty sub-par no better than I could make at home), french-toast with bread pudding (looked good but I didn't eat any) potatoes (those were yummy but you can't really f' up potatoes unless you spit on them) fruit, bacon...\n\nAtmosphere:\n\nThis and the brunch are what make me take off a star. It's done up nicely but certainly not aligned with the price... I still felt like I was eating in a sub-par hotel restaurant. I think the atmosphere needs a revamp somehow - maybe fix up the ceiling and incorporate Japanese screens. Put in some booths.\n\nService:\n\nGood. Attentive. No complaints. :) \n\nPrice: \n\nBill was like, $150ish if I recall correctly - for two.

A good friend told me Anzu serves the best steak in town and my mom loves steak so I thought it might be a good place. I, myself, don't eat beef and the selections on the menu other than filet magnon didn't look appetizing at all, so I went with the Veggie Risotto dish. Thinking back, it probably was the cheapest dish on the men that's why I chose it. I do have a thing for risotto tho.. Anyway, turned out... I could not finish even half of my dish it was so bad.\n\nMy mom thought her filet magnon was good but she said that if you get a good cut and good quality beef, it should be good however you prepare it and whoever prepares it. I don't know how true this is. My mom doesn't cook, neither do I. So don't bet on us. \n\nI still did not learn my lesson and ordered dessert hoping it would make my meal a little better. We had the creme brulee which, to me, was edible. However, my mother, who is particular about her desserts(see where I get my genes?) was extremely disappointed. I don't remember why she didn't like it. But, oh well,...basically Anzu didn't win us. I probably won't come back here again because there's nothing in the menu for me.

He just hunched his shoulders. \n\nWe walked up to the hostess stand and I gave my name and told them I had a reservation. The hostess says something about me being a little late and walked away in a hurry. She came back shortly and said follow me. The hostess walked so damn fast I thought she was practicing for a speed walking race or something, \n\nWe were seated and immediately offered beer, champagne, juice or a mimosa. My husband quickly became excited when the waiter told him that they had Sapporo on tap. Needless to say he got a Sapporo but I ordered a mimosa. The mimosa was very good and was a good balance of champagne and orange juice. \n\nNow for the buffet. I wanted to start with a taste of available breakfast options and I must say there weren't many options. \n\nThere were home style potatoes, sausage, bacon, pancakes, bagels, an omelet station and fruit. \n\nI tried the potatoes which had onions and bell peppers but they were still bland. I don't eat pork and there was no sign letting us know the type of sausage so I passed. There was a soup ladle to use for the maple syrup to top the pancakes which I didn't but thought was interesting. Also the cream cheese for the bagels was kept in block form and sat on a wood cutting board........ \n\nSo much for presentation. \n\nSince there weren't many breakfast options I thought I would try an omelet.....well that didn't work out. The line was soooooo long because there was only one person making omelets because there only one burner. REALLY????? So no I did not get an omelet. \n\nThis restaurant advertises its brunch on KBLX and they have a full restaurant and one person making omelets. Not good! \n\nAfter finishing my bland potatoes and fruit we both got up to explore the other options. Before we went back I told my husband that I would sit at the table until he got back because we had drinks on the table and I don't like leaving drinks unattended. I also told him that I don't want the wait staff to think we were gone. My husband quickly said the wait staff should know we did not leave because we hadn't paid the bill. \n\nI reluctantly went with my husband to through the buffet again and when we returned to our table.....yes the table had been cleared because the wait staff did think we were gone. \n\nWe sat down and when the wait staff returned with clean place settings they looked very confused. I blurted out that we weren't finished. they apologized and quickly brought out new drinks. \n\nThe other options were dim sum, a few sushi options, prime rib, lamb, greek salad, cold shrimp, blue point oysters on the half shell, teriyaki chicken, salmon, risotto with snap peas, couscous with chicken, tabbouleh with tuna, greek salad, caesar salad and various desserts. \n\nWe both thought that the chicken was exceptional and my husband liked the oysters, everything else was just ok. \n\nIt took a long time to tast the prime rib and lamb because the carving station was combined with the omelet station. Yes the same damn chef was responsible for carving meat and making omelets and the line was hella long.......so irritating! \n\nThe prime rib was just okay too and definitely not worth waiting in that damn line. \n\nThere were a ton of dessert options and I think I took a taste of all of them. The pecan pie was good and they had this japanese cake (I think that's what its called) and that was good too but everything else was just okay or way too rich for my taste. \n\nUninspired to indulge any further was flagged down the waiter and asked for our check. \n\nThis restaurant looks like it is really a bar/lounge and they put more tables in the space on Sunday for the brunch and It definitely was not worth the $60 per person that was paid for the father's day brunch. \n\nWe originally were going to give this place 2 stars but my husband wanted to give them one more because they had Sapporo on tap.\n\nBy the way.....you can't here the KBLX braodcast in the restaurant.", "author": "Nikki W."}

No salt, nothing to really make that raw fish pop. 2nd was a soup like butter nut squash with ginger or something, That was okay. Then came the quail.

I made the reservations via OpenTable, with a secret delivery of flowers via OpenTable partner FlowerPetals.com. As per instructions, I called ANZU to arrange the precise time, manner and delivery to our table. The hostess was not only polite, but also graciously interested herself in helping prepare a memorable evening, preparing the best table, letting her manager know that the flowers should be delivered with the first drinks. Not only did everything proceed like clockwork, but the staff went beyond 'bending over backwards' to ensure our comfort and executing my instructions to-the-letter. And although we did not order desert, ANZU sent us a special 'gratis' plate of chocolate fondu, laden with strawberries, home-made marshmallow, coconut balls, and mini-cakes for dipping in the rich hot melted chocolate... as if we had room for more after a very, very good and amply portioned dinner.\n\nThe Food: 4 stars.\n\nWe both ordered:\n\n(1) Drinks\nDon Julio A\u00f1ejo Tequila $15\nThis was the ONLY A\u00f1ejo they offered... and not my favorite, but it is a decent tequila, and a generous shot was provided.\n\nSapporo Draft (on tap) beer\nYummy, cold, refreshing. Like Sapporo, most Japanese beers delivered to the US are brewed in Canada these days. Check the label on your next bottle. Nonetheless, a fantastic beer.\n\nWe love sake, and would have ordered, but the prices were prohibitively expensive. Two glasses of cold sake (reishu/ ) were about the price of an entire bottle, so we declined.\n\n\n(2) Entr\u00e9\nKOBE-STYLE ONGLET STEAK (grilled Wagyu hanger steak, pommes frites, sauce \u00e0 l'\u00e9chalotte / $28) with a one side order of MARCONA ALMOND-MISO GREEN BEANS / $6.\nFor the uninitiated, Kobe (Japan area where made famous) beef is finely marbled, extremely tender, and tasty to boot. Kobe-style would imply a similar level of care put into raising the cow that produced this fine meat. Although the beef was indeed tasty at ANZU, it was far from precision-marbled, and not quite as tender as a true Kobe beef from Japan. And therefore, downgraded to four stars. The accompanying Water Cress salad  with a delicate Yuuzu/Ponzu drssing was a perfect complement. The Pommes Frites (French Fries) seemed like an odd choice to include in the dinner... lacking a little imagination as a side... however, nicely seasoned, prepared, finely cut, and probably the best damn fries we ever had.\n\nPresentation: 3.5 stars.\n\nThe food presentation was nice... not extremely imaginative... but nice. Not fusion. Not French. Not Japanese. Not exotic. A very American-style basic presentation on very basic hotel-ware.

From our initial contact with the Hotel Nikko valet to our Hostess and Waiter's excellent service, we had an enjoyable meal and memorable event.

The entrees and dessert tables were packed with so many delectables that we only sampled one-tenth of everything. For dessert lovers, the Key Lime pie was heavenly, ethereal and gossamer, and nearby I had to pull myself away from the chocolate dipping station.

Overall, I think the overhaul was successful.  We ordered 3 different appetizers: The Rock (thin slices of beef that you cook on a hot rock, served with 3 dipping sauces), hamachi crudo, and seafood kaiyaki, and all 3 were delicious!  If you go, you MUST order The Rock; it's an experience on its own, and it's good!  The seafood kaiyaki is also an excellent choice. We should have ordered more of these when we went.\n\nFor entrees, I decided to go with the grilled lamb, and my friends ordered the black cod, seafood risotto, and grilled salmon.  I absolutely loved the lamb; it was cooked perfectly and the accompanying sauce was very tasty.  However, my friend did not like her cod, which was served in a broth.  I didn't try it so I can't pass judgment on it, but everyone else seemed to like their dish.\n\nThe one part of the menu that needs to be improved is the dessert menu.  There weren't many choices, and being a chocoholic, I always assumed that any dessert menu would have something chocolate-y for me.  Well, the only chocolate-y thing this menu had was a chocolate fondue, which came with marshmallows, macaroons, strawberries, sliced bananas, and something else I can't remember.  The chocolate was good, but I can make fondue at home; I certainly don't need to come to a posh restaurant to get it.  My friends tried the cream puffs, but nobody liked them.

She had the Sorrano ham and cantaloupe salad and i had sushi and prime rib galore.  plus the salmon and couscous, the fried rice, the crazy desserts, the dim sum, the fresh-squeezed orange juice (at $2.50 a flute, i had probably at least $15 worth).\n\nThe place is very classy, and the jazz music really made it chill.  For a moment we, in our fancy clothes, just felt so affluent!  \n\nI'm not a big fan of food that comes in small portions served on big plates with nothing but decorations.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-06", "description": "I won a raffle at my work with a 2-night stay at Hotel Nikko and daily breakfast.  Since I otherwise would have spent almost no money at the hotel, I decided to overlook the 3-star Yelp average for Anzu and made a dinner reservation.  They gladly pushed my reservation back as it took me longer than anticipated to arrive on my journey to the city.\n\nThe decor is relatively modern and there is a nice bar to the left when you walk in.  The restaurant seating is past the bar; not too many tables and only about half of them were filled at 830PM on a Friday evening.  The sushi station next to the bar looked appealing and my hunger was churning.  \n\nThe worker to guest ratio was about 1/2 : 1 it seemed.  Taking this into consideration, our service was terrible.  I really feel bad for the chefs at this restaurant because their menu and food was excellent.  Our server seemed to be lost and was rather unattentive.  He did not mess up our order, but lacked giving us the attention we needed during crucial times of our dinner.\n\nI started out with:\nCUCUMBER SAKE MARTINI  \nDistillery No. 209 gin\u00ae, sake, simple syrup  \ncucumber, fresh lime juice\nIt was pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  Refreshing and satisfying.\n\nSince it was my first drink of the night, I put it back rather quickly.  I was all ready for another drink of sorts, so I tried making eye contact with him unsuccessfully.  One of the server attendants stopped by to offer us some bread served with a side dish of olive oil / balsamic and another of olive tapanade.  I told him I wanted a drink and he said he'd tell the server.  We enjoyed our bread with an empty glass.  About 5 minutes passes and our food comes.  Was dropped off by the expo, so again, no server.  A quarter way through the meal, our server stops by and I tell him I need some wine.  He must have been 'too busy' or just didn't give a shit because it wasn't until we were nearing the last of our meal before we started to get pissed.  I grabbed him and he finally gets a glass of wine.  It literally took him about 30 seconds to walk to the bar, pour the wine and give it to me.  What a joke.  These shenanigans just cost them 1.5-2 stars, hence the 3-star review.  I'd probably have given them 4.5 stars if it wasn't for this bozo.\n\nWell onto the good part, the food:\nWe ordered a variety of small dishes to share family style.\n\nRED SNAPPER SASHIMI / 12   \npomegranate soy glaze, spicy persimmon chutney \nOne of the best dishes on the table.  The fish was nicely sliced and quite fresh.  The chutney sauce was very good and added a nice welcomed Indian flavor to the meal.  Good stuff.\n\nSASHIMI TRIO / 21 \nHamachi with fresh jalapenos, Asian pear yuzu sauce, micro cilantro/ \nSalmon with a sake-soy glaze/ Kobe beef with shiso pesto/ Oyster with lemongrass mignonette\nFor the price, I thought the portions could have been a little larger.  It was 1 oyster and two pieces each of sashimi.  Never had beef sashimi before; it was very good.  Again, fresh and working with some pretty good flavor combinations.\n\nZINFANDEL BRAISED VEAL CHEEKS /12 \nroasted bell pepper, goat cheese bread salad, aged \nbalsamic vinegar & extra virgin oil\nOne of the better tasting meats on the planet and this one was prepared nicely and hit the spot.\n\nLOCAL OYSTER  1/2 doz /18         \nlemongrass mignonette\nThe oysters were pretty meaty and not bad.  One tasted a little fishy and one had not been properly detached.  The sauce was not that great; I would have been happier with squeezed lemon and horseradish.\n\nWILD ARUGULA SALAD / 10 \ntruffle poached egg, marcona almonds, shaved vella \njack, sherry vinaigrette\nThis and the red snapper were the highlights.  Good mild dressing, shaved cheese, fresh arugula and a nice poached egg made for one of the better salads I've had to date.\n\nAfter eating all of this, I was satisfied, but could easily have eaten more.  I finished my glass of wine and looked over the dessert menu.  Went with some Yamakazi 12 Year Single malt and the lady had some tawny port.  The tawny was damn fine I must say.  The booze I drank was pretty standard; not a bad choice for the price.  We paired this with some dessert:\nBEIGNETS \nespresso frappe, bailey's irish cream, tcho chocolate anglais\nNever saw beignets like this; long and slender, like a breadstick almost.  Three in quantity served with the espresso and chocolate, each in their own ramekin.  The espresso was so damn full of flavor and good.  A great way to cap off a fine meal.\n\nThey just need to bring in some experienced wait staff and they could turn this right around.", "author": "Benjamin P."}

How cool is that?\nI had a yummy ginger-tini. It was very reminiscent of a lemon drop, but the slight variation worked for me. The drinks were  a bit pricey, but very good.\nThe nigiri i had was amazing! Probably the best I've ever had!\nI had hamachi, which melted in my mouth, and  kani, sweet sno crab. Both had truly incredible flavor. (I could have eaten quite a few more.)\nFor my entree, i had salmon. It was on a bed of sushi rice, with crab and avocado in between. I requested the yuzu mayo, and wasabi on the side.\nThis dish was absolutely fantastic! It was cooked perfectly, and had remarkable flavors.\nFor dessert we shared marble bundt cake, with vanilla gelato, and brandied cherries. I enjoyed this as well.\nThe kitchen seemed a bit slow for the amount of people seated. Although, our server was great. He was very knowledgeable, and let us in on the situation with the chefs, and the kitchen that I had read about. He also gave me a a little freebie. Don't remember how we got onto the subject.....But, we were discussing natto, (they serve it as part of the Japanese breakfast in the hotel.) and I mentioned i had never had it, but had heard a lot about tit. He brought me out a little cup of it, (with sauces, and lid.)

Started with a bowl of \"cream of asparagus\" soup that didn't taste anything like asparagus, as far as I could tell.  But I will admit that it was still tasty, whatever it was.  However, there were still clumps of randomness in there, kind of like those that you get from canned soup and you haven't beaten all the clumps out yet.  Yeah.  Classy.\n\nOur main entree was a halibut steamed in paper boxes.  The presentation was nice, and the flavors would have been AWESOME, except the fish was way overcooked.  All four of them.  Really?  $33 for overcooked fish?\n\nI think the best part was the dessert, the ginger creme brulee.  Although it essentially tasted just like creme brulee.  I'm beginning to think that these Japanese flavors are just too subtle for me, but given that I normally love Japanese food, I am hesitant to believe that all of the issues with this dinner were with me.\n\nWe did have a sushi roll that was very good, and it sounds like their steak is probably the way to go.

What's important to me is I know what I'm getting into and the price point and quality match, or at least the former does not exceed the latter.\n\nSo my assessment of Anzu is it's a disappointment. Let me be clear. It isn't bad. If I were seeing a show in the neighborhood or meeting friends, I'd consider it, and it's a cut above the tourist trap joints. It just isn't as good as I'd expect from a Nikko. The selection is so-so. I had chirashi as a special order; I went and asked the chef. The didn't have any of the usual mushrooms and other items, the non fish items, that a top-quality Japanese restaurant will scatter onto the chirashi.

The waitress constantly refilled our water and was very nice to us.\n\nI ordered the Seared King Salmon ($21) and my friend ordered the 12oz Niman Ranch Prime Beef Ribeye($33).  My dish was made up of lemon-salt broiled salmon, tossed sushi rice with Dungeness crab, avocado, and mayonnaise and wasabi sauce on the side.  The fish was good, but it wasn't spectacular.  Parts of it were soft and cooked just right, but there were also other parts that were dry and a bit hard.  It wasn't much better than salmon I've had in my salmon burger that I get from Holy Grill.  The dungeness crab was a nice touch and there was a generous amount of it tucked between the salmon and the rice, but it was lacking much crab flavor.  I got to try a piece of my friend's steak and I didn't think that it was anything special either.  I thought it was comparable to Outback and definitely not anywhere near Cattlemen's.  Maybe it's because he ordered it medium, but it wasn't as tender or flavorful as I'd like.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that the service was 5 stars and the food was 3 stars.  However, the quality of the food did not match the high price, so the overall rating is somewhere between 2-3 stars.  Even after using a $25 gift certificate, the meal ended up being $42 after tax and tip.

It was earlyish on a Sunday night, and the dining room was pretty empty.  Hubby ordered the Salmon, which was nicely presented and fairly good.  The menu description reads \"WILD KING SALMON lemon-salt broiled salmon, tossed sushi rice with Dungeness crab, avocado, yuzu mayonnaise, kizami wasabi\" - if there was any crab at all in the sticky rice, it must have been a single shred.  The yuku mayonnaise and kizami wasabi were a nice touch (it could have used more wasabi), and the salmon tasted like salmon, which was good.  The dish could have used something crisp for contrast (flash-fried vegetable shreds, maybe) but wasn't bad.\n\nMy short ribs, however, were tasteless.  Tender, yes, but with no identifiable flavor at all; not beef, not even salt.  The portions were large, but so what?  If it has no flavor, why would you want to eat a lot of it?  The bed of soft polenta under the beef was more successful; slightly loose but flavorful, and the geeens were nicely done and added a good contrast to the polenta.  \n\nThe warm sourdough rolls that were delivered at the start of the meal were disppointingly ordinary.  San Francisco has fantastic bread, but it didn't show up on our table.\n\nAll in all, NOT a hit, not even \"good\", and certainly not worth the $50.00 pricetag (before tax and tip).   Heck, we had a $25 gift certificate, and still didn't feel the meal was worth the $36.89 total (with tax and mandatory 18% tip).\n\nOn a positive note: the staff are friendly, and the waitstaff do great, classy carries.  Very professional.  The atmosphere is kind of jazzy Asian fusion, nicely appointed, good table linen and tableware.\n\nPerhaps Anzu does well in other areas, but the entrees we had were certainly not up to San Francisco standards.", "author": "Kathe W."}

He wanted sushi and I could only think of Anzu in the SF area off the top of my head. I had kumamoto oysters before that tasted pretty good so I thought why not. I take him there thinking he'll be impressed but no, the waiter was an idiot who didn't understand any questions I asked. I asked about sushi specials and he said he would get back to me about it. Did he? No. forgot parts of the order and tried to overcharge me at the end of the meal. Let's not forget that a family of five was served before us even though they arrived AFTER. I don't understand why the service was so slow when there were only 4 other tables with people AND he wasn't the only server. I don't understand why when it was brought to his attention that the amount on the tab was incorrect he had a problem understanding that we did indeed, not order as much as he wanted to charge me for. For a restaurant that has a 3 dollar sign by it's name I expect a certain amount of class and customer service. He didn't offer any sort of compensation until after the bill was paid and I was ready to leave and never come back.\n\nIn summary, customer service: FAIL\nfood: don't even remember anymore because he was an idiot and ruined my night so FAIL\n\nand, for a Japanese restaurant, would it be weird to assume that sapporo or asahi would be on tap and not cost 6 dollars?", "author": "Christina L."}

At 10 am I was on the computer looking for Sunday brunch places. Naturally I thought of Anzu since its featured on KBLX. I looked the menu over that was provided online: and what I saw was\n\nChef made omelet bar - Didnt get this\nHam - didn't try this\nSausages - didn't try this\nPancakes - looked fluffy\nMixed asian vegetables with bok choy, baby corn, bell peppers, onions, pea pods\nFettuccine with mixed veggies in a light better and vegetable sauce.- this was so delicious but a tad too buttery.\nSkirt steak with a pan gravy and vegetables with risotto - tender melt in your mouth steak with a delicious gravy and peppers - YUM\nMahi Mahi with a cream sauce - A little tad over cooked, but delicious sauce\nfish nuggets - crispy and tasty\nonion strings or fries - didn't try this\nOrrechete pasta salad - tasty\nchinese chicken salad - delicious tender chicken\ncaesar salad - didn't try it\nShrimp chowder - HUSBAND said it was soo good with tender shrimp\nCold open shell mussells and cold shrimp on shell with cocktail sauce - looked fresh, but didn't try it.\nSushi - california roll - average \nDim Sum- I am a huge dim sum fan. They had shrimp dumplings, mini pork buns, pork dumplings, pork and shark fin purses, potstickers, vegge and pork dumplings. They had huge steam trays with beautifully and freshly prepared and delicious dim sum that rivaled anything in Chinatown. The potstickers were delicious and juicy. I went back twice for these.\nDesserts included a huge chocolate fountain with assorted fresh fruits, rice crispies, marshmallows\nChocolate mouse\nVanilla custard\nprincess cake - green almond cake with custard and raspberry filling\ncheese cake, tiramisu, strawberry mousse shortcake.\n\nThe service was ok, although he didn't refill my husbands coffee. But he did refill the orange juice. Also they didn't replace the forks with new ones. It was very busy though.  \n\nWe both dressed up since it was Easter. And we were among the finely dressed among the bunch. Suit for him, red dress for me with red heels. He and i were really enjoying ourselves and enjoying each others company and the ambience and the live music and felt very much comfortable and at peace. Thats what Easter should be like all the time.\n\nValet parking is a must. And it only cost us 5.00 which is a steal. VALIDATION is required by the restaurant to obtain that price. \n\n$60.00 a person plus tip.", "author": "Charlene C."}

They had all the goodies, natto, sake (the fish, not the drink), gohan, miso shiru, suimono, and yummy condiments.  We were also pleasantly surprised that they served fresh orange juice.  I would give the place 4 stars for the food, but... \r\n\r\nWhen I called, they told me that the buffet was until 11:30, so we arrived at about 10, ready to get our fill (at $20 a person for breakfast).  When we got there, it wasn't until about 10:15 that they told us the buffet was to be taken down at 10:30.  No big deal, they told us to take what we wanted.  Our servers played musical tables and one of them was a bit rude to us, telling us that it wasn't her fault that they had told us the wrong thing...  I got the feeling that management and employee satisfaction were pretty low. \r\n\r\nAnother issue for us was the validated parking.  One person told us we were validated for 4 hours, another for just 1.  After we finished our meal, they told us they didn't validate at all for breakfast.  When we talked to the manager, we got a stamp and a signed paper saying 'customer complaint'.  We thought it would have been more tactful had they said 'manager error'.  Or something like that, since we hadn't complained, we just had been told something else.  \r\n\r\nWhen we got our car, we set off, and after driving a half hour, realized that they had set the parking break on our automatic transmission without telling us.  The smoking breaks were an olfactory reminder of the whole service experience. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I would have loved to give this place a higher rating, but the feeling I left with was that this is a place where communication among management is low, service is poor and begrudging, and the ideal customer is the quiet tourist who keeps their mouth shut.", "author": "senna c."}

It was our anniversary, and to catch a concert after dinner, we made a very early reservation.  5:30 pm was the time the restaurant open for dinner.  We were the first one there, and yes, it was really quiet.  We felt a little odd at first, felt like we booked the whole restaurant.  Anyhow, the hosts welcome us warmly and even said \" Happy Anniversary\" when she was walking us to our table.  The waitress and waiter are totally nice, and very attentive.  \nRegarding the food--I really felt like I was eating in heaven.  Thanks Yelpers for the dish recommendation.  It was awesome!  We ordered the ROCK for appetizer, although it was a little pricy, it was totally worth a try.  It was a fun experience to cook your slices of beef on a sizzling rock.  One recommendation, you got to save the Trio dipping sauce for later, if you were going to order any steak.  The spicy miso and wasabi mustard were the best to combine with your steak entr\u00e9e. So, hubby ordered the Filet Mignon with Shiitake Mushroom Bordelaise sauce and Roasted Japanese Sweet Potatoes.  Ordered Medium, however, it felt like a medium well to us.  Dipping with sauce we saved from the appetizer, it was still a 4.5 out of 5 stars dish.  Then, my order of Smoke Black Cod really deserved 5 stars.  It was very refresh and the taste was just right.  I finish the whole bowl (consider I usually have half of my dish to go) in no time.  The fish was silky smooth.  The risotto, mushroom and edamame were such a wonderful combination.  Even hubby wants to steal my dish!!!  \nToward the end, they send out a complimentary desert for our anniversary.  What a surprise!  It was also very good, not something you can order from the menu.  Simple, but special.   \nToward the end, there were about 4 tables in the entire restaurant (around 7:00pm).  It was a little sad to see not many tables in a nice restaurant on Friday night.", "author": "Mimi W."}

We had dinner and breakfast at Anzu since they throw breakfast in for free when you stay in the top three floors.\n\nAt dinner we asked for a sushi menu at the tables and ordered some hotate nigiri, a benchmark of ours for most sushi joints. Sebo and Koo prepare far, far better sushi. The sushi menu itself looks like the first half of every sushi menu in the city. Very basic nigiri fare, a few rolls, that's it.\n\nWe ended up ordering most of our food off the regular menu. While I have a taste for salty food my smoked cod was too salty to an extreme. I can't remember what my date had but it was mediocre. \n\nThe wine list was ok but overpriced. I was happy to see nobody wearing a spoon around their neck because I wouldn't have trusted them anyways. Read the wine list for yourself, don't waste words with the staff about it.\n\nThe dessert was great. Brandied cherrys and chocolate, yum.\n\nDinner for two with a cheap (at Trader Joes, not here) bottle of pinot noir from Monterrey county: $142 + tip.\n\nBreakfast was a simple buffet. Lox and capers on white bread rolls, Dennys style food in steam warmers. Soggy french toast. Eww. The drip coffee was ok, certainly no blue bottle. The OJ was enjoyable. The breakfast miso was too salty but there were pained-looking Japanese visitors putting it back. No doubt they missed home, badly.\n\nIf you're going to come here at all I suggest getting an imperial suite and hitting anzu for the free breakfast. I can't think of any other reason to bother.", "author": "Willy D."}

We ordered \"The Rock\", a Wagyu sirloin that was cooked at the table on a sizzling rock. Good dips and wasabe made this a great first choice. We then had a very generous Farmer's Market salad that we could have shared. Great transition from the appetizer. Sushi was fresh and tasty.

One waiter was waiting all tables, but did have assistance with water glasses and bread. Service was good, but slow.\n\nWe ordered appetizers: California rolls, wasabi prawns, and a beet salad. The California roll was sent back because the rice was very salty. The wasabi prawns were nothing more than walnut prawns with some wasabi added to the mayo paste. The prawns were too heavily covered in wasabi mayo to truly enjoy. The salad also got a vote of being \"too salty\".\n\nFor the main course, our selections included Lamb chops, the Kobi-style Onglet steak, and sushi combo plates. I did not hear a comment from the person on the lamb chops. Myself and another person had the Kobi-style Onglet steak and were not impressed. While it was tender, it had very little flavor. The two that had the sushi combos said the California rolls on their combo plate was also very salty.\n\nWhen we informed our waitier about the California roll appetizer being very salty he snapped back \"well they don't put salt on sushi.\" It left the embarrased guest trying to send it back even more embarrassed and all he could say was \"you are welcome to taste it for yourself\". In the end, the waiter removed the California rolls from the bill and also told us his manager had given us an additional 10% discount. \n\nI don't expect any of the 5 that dined here will return to Anzu.", "author": "Robert S."}

Service and atmosphere was fine. The staff was very attentive and was always there to fill our water glasses when it was even just 1/3 empty. \n\nNow onto the meal. For an appetizer we had the ahi tuna tartare. Soooo good! I could have eaten that all night!! (ahi tuna wasn't on the dine about town menu.. we ordered that seperately). Dine about town menu.. the salad was soo skimpy and underdressed. And by skimpy I mean I could have picked up the entire salad in one fist and shoved the whole thing in my mouth. Skimpy. The greens and pears also didn't look or taste fresh either. Soup was missing something... flavor! A few of my friends ordered the Potato Leek soup and expected at least some small chunks of potatoes, but everything was blended.\n\nMain Dishes: Chicken was very very very good! Perfectly cooked, moist and full of flavor! Tried my friend's seafood risotto and that tasted really good also. One complaint, maybe 2 tiny pieces of seafood in the entire dish.\n\nDesserts: Apricot creme brulee was very good.. especially with the ginger cookie yum :) The sundae was just a sundae. Vanilla gelato, chocolate sauce and caramel? Good, but I could've just made that myself with some expensive chocolate sauces.\n \nMaybe it was because of the whole Dine About Town thing and they didn't care to make everything that great, or maybe that's just how Anzu is. I don't know. If you really want to try the food at Anzu, I'd wait till Dine About Town starts up again. Only about $40+tip for 3 courses and you get a little taste of... whatever they put on the menu :P", "author": "Haim C."}

There was miso soup, rice porridge, rice, natto, fish cake (2 types), pickles (4 types), and grilled salmon (small portions), and nori.  It's a buffet, so you can have as much or as little as you want.  It's a little pricey, but it's a really nice break from bacon and eggs plus you don't feel sluggish and bloated when you're done.  The Western style breakfast buffet looked really good too, but I had to try the Japanese one.", "author": "Teresa H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-08-23", "description": "*Review pertains to sushi bar only*\r\n\r\nGoing to the sushi bar at Anzu and experiencing the skill and cuisine of master sushi chef Kazuhito Takahashi has been on my list of things to do since before I moved to the city. There are supposedly only 10 master sushi chefs in the country and I wanted to see if this experience lived up to the hype. \r\n\r\nWe asked if it would be ok to split one tasting menu ($50) and to order some items a la carte. Takahashi-san was a little wary of this, but then decided it would be ok. I was really surprised at how much food we got in the single tasting menu. I was afraid that we would leave hungry but we were more then sated at the end of our sushi surfeit. We started with a trio of appetizers, chilled spinach with bonito flakes, an assortment of mushrooms, and thinly sliced gobo. Next up came the sashimi plate with chu-toro (from the belly), striped bass, salmon, hamachi, scallop, and a few more. We agreed that the striped bass was our favorite, pristine and very fresh tasting. The salmon was our least favorite on the plate; the flesh was the lighter orange color common in farmed and Atlantic salmon and it seemed to be lacking the super buttery mouthfeel that amazing salmon can have. The scallop was the best that I have had, very clean, sweet, and without a trace of any sort of sliminess. Manfriend was quite taken by the toro, but to be honest, I didn't think it was good enough to warrant the price one pays if they order it a la carte. It was rich, but not as much as I expected.\r\n\r\nWe weren't sure how much more we were going to get after this, but we enjoyed our Sauvignon Blanc and made a friendly wager on what was up next. It turned out to be hamachi kama (cheeks!). I've only had this dish grilled before, a preparation that takes nicely to the oil-intense region of the fish, but this time it was rewarmed and almost seemed baked or poached in a light yakatori type sauce. It was nice to have something warm to snack on, but it wasn't my favorite of the evening.\r\n\r\nWhat followed was a very generous nigiri assortment. At this point we wondered if he had misunderstood our request to only split one tasting menu b/c it seemed like we were getting a large quantity of fish. The nigri plate had fresh aji, snow crab, 2 types of scallops, striped bass, tai, sea trout, unagi, maguro, and ikura (fresh salmon roe). There might have been a hamachi nigri on there too, but I can't recall. All of the nigiri were delicious and tasted very fresh, I especially enjoyed the scallops. The aji was superior to other aji that I've had. \r\n\r\nWe decided that dessert would be hamachi sashimi and striped bass nigiri b/c one can never have too much sushi. At this point Takahashi-san had warmed up to us a little bit and seemed amused by our dessert choices. I had expected the prices to be much steeper for fish flown in that day from Japan and I also expected the portions to be smaller. We both agreed that it would have been our regular sushi bar if only we had discovered it sooner! It's really a shame that Takahashi is leaving at the end of the month, but at least we can say that we have had the pleasure of experiencing the work of a master sushi chef at least once. It should be noted that the Hotel Nikko and Anzu offer 4 free hours of validated parking when you dine there, which is pretty sweet. The ambiance at the sushi bar is fine b/c watching Takahashi's knife skills are entertainment enough, but I can't say that the stereotypical hotel restaurant ambiance for the rest of the place really wowed me. 4.5 stars.", "author": "Candice L."}

Went for Dine about Town (appetizer, main course, dessert) and had a cocktail at the bar.  The Soba Noodles and Edamame salad appetizer was great - light, cold soba noodles with edamame and hints of hijiki.  My main course - a steamed halibut with shiitake mushrooms, served a potato wedges topped with tobiko... all very simple but tasty.  Portion sizes are a little on the small side, but you're not left hungry afterward.  I had a ginger creme brulee for dessert, which was a regular creme brulee with just the slightest hint of ginger flavor that you could barely taste.  The restaurant was fairly empty for a Friday night, which was surprising given how great the food was.  The cucumber martini was also very tasty and, like the food, very light yet flavorful.  I will definitely come back here.", "author": "M P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-09-21", "description": "We were more than a little disappointed. This was our first anniversary dinner. Both of us had heard this was a great restaurant & hotel. After looking over the reviews on yelp I was a little unsure if we should eat here or head out to one of the other delicious places in town. \n\nWe made reservations, which I highly suggest. It was a full house the entire time we were there. From 7:30 until nearly 10. Somehow we got the short end of the stick when it comes to servers. We sat for a good 15 minutes before we were addressed by here. Then another 20 for our drinks. The drinks were great - raspberry ginger and mojitos. Yummy. \n\nMy husband had the Cesar salad which he enjoyed. I had the market salad with avocado, pears, baby spinach, goat cheese and the most awful dressing I've ever experienced. First taste was wonderful, but it had a horrible bitter after taste. \n\nWe were starved by the time our plates arrived for the main course. They looked delicious. A+ for presentation. We immediately realized we had no forks. I tried to get the managers attention (who had dropped off the plates). But he had jetted from the table ignoring my call to him. We then proceeded to sit looking at our wonderful meal for 10 + minutes. Can you believe it? Our server never came by to see how we were doing. Finally I was able to get the attention of the gentlemen who was delivering the bread. Only to get an annoyed smirk from him when we asked for forks. I watched as he walked towards the back and stood there conversing with the buser for a few minutes. Then awhile later returning with forks for us. No apologies. My food was now warm and not hot. I had the roasted chicken with baby vegetables and a creamy tarragon sauce. It really was good, I can't complain. My husband had the fillet mignon. It looked great. He ordered it medium well. Not what he got. After slicing into in, it was completely undercooked. More of a rare to medium rare. Eeks! We like our meat cooked. If our server had ever returned we would have told her, but she didn't. \n\nAnother funny thing happened while we sat in wait for our food. The table next to us was seated. They ordered, had drinks delivered, got up to head to the restroom to wash up before dinner (and even told their server). As soon as they got up the manager and a server came over and moved their table together with another. So they could seat a party of 4. The couple came back as they were just finishing up. The lady said, oh we were actually sitting here. The managers response - oh, well we have a party of 4 to sit. Give us a few minutes and we'll get you another table. Really? I can't imagine that happening at any other nice place. The couple just left. \n\nWith so many other nice restaurants to eat at, why go someplace that is hit and miss! Go somewhere else!", "author": "Jacqulyn E."}

When we did get the check , they made a mistake by giving us some one else's credit card and our bill was charged to that person, I don't mind getting a free meal but it took 30 minutes to settle.

Being that it was a San Francisco restaurant, we expected a bit more and were not overly impressed. The atmosphere is more of a business traveler type environment, versus fine dining. There was a table of twenty something year olds, making so much noise, I felt like I was at Denny's for a moment.\n\nWe orderered sushi (hamachi and salmon nigiri), romaine hearts with caesar dressing, Kurobuta pork osso bucco, shiso garlic-crusted rack of lamb and Japanese eggplant.  The hamachi was a bit grisly and the rice was dry and didn't taste very fresh.  the salad was excellent with anchovies.  Osso Bucco was tender, but nothing extraordinary.  The rack of lamb was tasty, but could have been served a little more rare.  Eggplant tasted like Chinese take out.  \n\nFinal bill for two people without drinks was $82.

We were not impressed, particularly since each entree was in the $30 range - I'm big on bang for the buck, so I always expect the flavor and quality of the meal to match what I'm paying.  This place did not meet my expectations.\n\nAmbiance: Clean, upscale, and modern.  Everything you'd expect in a pricey hotel restaurant.  \n\nService: Unimpressive.  The waitstaff weren't attentive at all. \n\nFood: We started with the pork belly (tender and flavorful) and shashimi sampler which was ok (I've definitely had better).  I had the cod with risotto, which was very bland.  The cod itself was fresh and had a nice texture to it, but it was also slightly burned around the edges.  My friends ordered the roast chicken (VERY dry), lamb porterhouse (the best dish - cooked very well with good flavor) and steak (an average steak).

The service was excellent, everything we requested came in a timely fashion.  Our plates were bussed imediately upon finishing our foods.  The menu was extensive and delicious, my favs were the Skirt Steak, Mahi Mahi, carved Prime Rib, Dim Sum and fresh fruits.  The Dim Sum was better than many Chinese restaurants.  Especially the Easter Bunny Ha Gow.  The regular Ha Gow was bigger than a golf ball and all shrimp.  The Oysters on the half shell were deliciously creamy and smoove, we must have had over 40+ shells.  The tomato/fennel/shrimp soup was also very tasty.  The many desserts, cakes (Princess) & pies (Cherry) and chocolate dipping station were yummy too.  The dipping Chocolate was rich & cremy and the strawberries were sweet and juicy.  At the Omelet Station I asked for a Prime Rib/ cheese, onion, jalapeno omelet.  I never had a Prime Rib omelet so decided to try one.  There was so much on the menu I think I better stop here.

While the sushi was masterfully done, the service was outright obnoxious! \n\nMy friend and I have a standing sushi date night once a month and had recently selected Anzu as this months location. Upon making my reservation on Open Table I specifically requested seating at the Sushi bar as we were not interested in the full dinner menu. Once we arrived, the hostess informed us the Sushi Bar was full and we could either wait or be seated in their main dining area. While disappointed we opted for the main dining area where we were then informed by the waiter  they did not serve the full sushi menu in the dining room and only offered a small selection of items. So we called the hostess over and informed her of the problem. She then confirmed the full menu was not available. When I questioned her as to why she would seat us in the main dining area when I specifically requested the Sushi Bar she lied straight to my face telling me a never made the request for the bar and only informed them I was having sushi and cocktails. She then proceeded to seat us in their lounge area where she claimed we could order off the full sushi menu. WRONG. The bar tender informed us that the lounge area didn't serve the full menu. At this point the manager was brought out. When I explained to him (in a very professional tone) the issue we were having he gave us a song and dance about how there is a specific area on Open Table for booking the sushi bar. Um. okay. have you told Open Table about this? I double checked later that evening to confirm, and Open Table only has 1 listing for Anzu there is NO additional listing for just the sushi bar. End of a long story, he ended up comping our first round of drinks while we waited, but instead simply telling the bartender to comp the drinks he made us do some song-and-dance about saying we \"saw it on twitter.\" Really? You f'up on reservation, make us wait, call us liars, and then make us spout some ridiculous line to comp our drinks. WE'RE NEVER GOING BACK.\n\nThe only saving grace was the delicious sushi.", "author": "Erin K."}

I'm a pretty forgiving diner so this is serious.  First of all, we had to wait about 20 minutes before someone came by to say \"hello\" to take a drink order.  After the drink order, it took another 20 minutes to have our food order taken.  Their bread comes warm and would probably be the only thing I REALLY enjoyed that night.  We ordered the pork belly, which had a good flavor combination but the pork itself was just \"ok\".  Next was the hamachi crudo, which had very little flavor, could have just been a sashimi dish, and the jalepeno and grapefruit slices were boring.  Our entree was the miso-buttered lobster, which was basically lots of gnocchi and three small pieces of lobster.  The flavor was good but my tongue got tired of the over-powering sauce that was too salty.  The last part, which I hoped would redeem the meal was the key lime tartlet.  I've had desserts that came from the freezer section at Safeway that were better than this and the presentation was very 80's.  Sorry, Anzu.  I will not be returning.", "author": "Nina L."}

The traditional American meal was well covered with all the basics you'd expect (plus suprises like bourbon sweet potatoes), including a carving station with very tasty ham and prime rib. Great  salads-especially the beet/frisee--really fresh and flavorful.  Lovely presentation for those who care about that. There were several upscale versions of salad as well including ingredients like seared thinly sliced beef, duck, etc. The asian offerings were a really nice treat--a good selection of sushi and dim sum, etc. The dessert selection was off the hook--way more than any one person could sample. They even had the chocolate fountain which is a kick. Wait staff were all super nice and efficient even though the place was packed.

One of my top 5 sushi experiences ever....it's so fresh, it's like a party in my mouth! :) We started with a nice bubbly bottle of Domaine Chandon, a grasshopper roll of tempura shrimp, umi, avocado, and spicy mayo, as well as the crudo with tuna over grapefruit and topped with a serrano chile and hint of sea salt (both left me wanting more). Then, onto the main meals. Nw the thing I love about my family is we share a love for wine, food, ambiance, and SHARING! :) One thing we need at every dining experience is a lazy susan because we share everything...the standard m.o. is: take a bit, savor & enjoy, pass to the left, and repeat. So many great meals- short braised beef ribs over kale and a pumpkin polenta (again, I don't eat beef but I'm a big fan of pumpkin and polenta so these 2 p's worked well together for my tastebuds). The pan-roasted chicekn in artichokes, mushrooms, and carrots was flavorful but I can't say I'm a huge fan of tarragon so it kind of detracted from my enjoyment of the dish. My salmon with caviar, avocado, and dungeness crab was light and refreshing. I always seem to order the \"light\" fish and then indulge when I try everyone else's plate. My sister, Alexa, was the winner of the night ordering the black cod cooked in a black truffle oil over a sage pumpkin mushroom risotto...buttery comfort food! Our wine was so so- a full bodied Spanish red- Mencia and the label was more colorful than the wine itself. The true surprise of the night was the dessert wine, a Hungarian wine with a name I can't remember or spell because it lacked many vowels as do many Czech and Hungarian wines do. It was a golden harvest smooth wine with the spices of cinnamon and nutmeg overshadowing the syrupy sugar element that seems to weigh down most dessert wines.

I got the butter lettuce salad, the pumpkin ravioli, and the chocolate caramel bread pudding.  Of those three, only dessert did not disappoint.  The salad was too heavy on the lettuce and dressing and too light on the rest of the ingredients. The \"sauce\" on the pumpkin ravioli was poorly conceived-- it was thick and sweet and had the consistency of Elmer's glue.  Not a good contrast to the sweet pumpkin filling.  Plus, the menu claimed that the ravioli came with broccoli rabe; it was actually broccolini.  This may seem like a small detail, but I love broccoli rabe.  And I am skeptical when a restaurant is unclear on the difference between the two.  Broccoli rabe would have set off the sweet dish much better.  The bread pudding was good.  I sampled some other people's desserts and would not recommend them-- the chocolate mint creme brulee was very average, and the chocolate cake was dry.\n\nOverall, I would not eat here again.

My medium rare filet mignon was closer to medium well. I asked the waiter to explain the different marinates to me, he basically read off the menu.
