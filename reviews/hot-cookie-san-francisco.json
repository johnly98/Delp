Hot Cookie is a small, touristy, cookie bakery in the heart of the Castro District. All the classic cookies are available here, as well as amazing new crazy cookie concoctions they have. From the \"Basic Becky\" that is chocolate chip, and your Granny oatmeal raisin cookie (my fave) to modern favorites like matcha maker and coconut macaroons cookie (yes I named the cookies). If you're also looking to get kinky, they have coconut macaroon penis. It comes in dark chocolate or white. I prefer dark to be honest....both in cookies and in real life. TMI...\n\nAnyways, Hot Cookie is a very cool place. The location, though small, is pretty great. Outlooking the amazingly rainbow scenery of Castro District. If the pictures of different customer's on the wall, hot cookie underwear, to the penis shaped macaroons doesn't interest you? I dont know what will. Not only that but prices are pretty cheap. Cookies are all under $5. To be honest, they got me at penis macaroons! There's certain places that you really don't need to explain. People just need to see it for themselves to see why it's popular. If you're ever in town and want to visit the Castro District, this place is a must on the bucket list!", "author": "Oliver B."}

The answer: absolutely. \n\nThe basic bitch is just a down to earth, excellent cookie. Crispy around the edges and soft and buttery in the middle, despite not being hot out of the oven.\n\nI was too excited and also got a Mac Daddy (white chocolate macadamia nut) which I didn't have time to eat that day - the next day it still had that beautiful crispy edge with a soft middle.\n\nThey sell the cookies by weight and they're really reasonably priced.

We all know it's the reason you're stopping in... for the penis. (No shame.)\n\nWhat you must know about the penis cookie, is that it is NOT an actual cookie. It's a coconut macaroon, aka chocolate-covered shredded coconut treat, which to me is basically candy. You can get it in dark chocolate or white chocolate, and even add whipped cream for a fee, but it's not a cookie.\n\nIs shredded coconut and sugar your thing? Then you might like a giant $8 penis. Me? I happen to not enjoy coconut macaroons, so I was pretty disappointed with my dark chocolate penis with sprinkles. \n\nThe actual cookies behind the glass all look slightly over-baked and/or were flattened out. I'm probably very picky about cookies because it's one of my hobbies (baking, not being picky), but this is San Francisco. High standards!\n\nI want to say we ordered a chocolate chip or a peanut butter or something else simple, and I recall being disappointed. \n\nI came back another time and ordered a toffee milk chocolate cookie.... now that one was pretty good! Cookie flatness be damned, the flavor was great. \n\nAll in all, Hot Cookie is a fun place to visit and snap photos with, but there are much better cookie options in San Francisco. This is a novelty place for sure.\n\nTip: Buy a pair of their Hot Cookie underwear and post a picture on social media. You'll get a free cookie!", "author": "Melissa B."}

Definitely some richer dark chocolate here, and the quality of the coconut macaroon cookies were really good and delicious. They also have the option of having whipped cream and sprinkles on them, which I passed out on.

If I had to come back I'd definitely snag a Miss Venus.\n\nWhite Chocolate Macadamia Cookie ($1 for a day old!)- Super good! Though it was a day old it was still super delicious and still a good, moist cookie.

The inside also features tons of photos of happy customers and drag queens, and they also have their iconic 'Hot Cookie' sign out front. Honestly my biggest highlight here was finding out how many phallic things I could say about their iconic cookies.\n\nI mean Hot Cookie is most arguably a definite spot to go to spot in the Castro, especially if you're visiting the Castro for the first time. I'd put Hot Cookie at a pretty moderate 4, as the only reason why for me it wouldn't hit a 5 is because of how pricey the iconic coconut macaroon cookies were, however the quality of their cookies were pretty good.

The price is based on the weight so they weigh the cookie to determine the price. Mine came out to a little less than $3. I asked for it heated cuz who doesn't like a warm cookie?

Their regular cookies are large at 3 to 4 ounces, and the regular price is about $3.5 and up. Toffee Milk Chocolate is a must, White Chocolate Macadamia was good and what I expected, and Fudge Packer Cookie was chocolate rich.

I got three cookies to try - the toffee chocolate chip, the basic bish/b*tch, which is chocolate chip, and the mac daddy, which is a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie. I think the toffee chocolate was my favorite. It's a little different and in the best way. The regular choc chip is pretty basic and I would say the macadamia nut one is my second favorite of the three. The cookie s are also a good mix of hard and chewy - slightly harder on the edges but softer and chewier in the middle. Really good.

Don't you wish you had one now?", "author": "Tim P."}

Did you even visit The Castro if you didn't take a scandalous selfie of you nibbling away at a penis cookie from Hot Cookie??????? Semen has 5-7 calories per teaspoon (?), while this cookie has tens/hundreds of times that...but to each their own\n\nWow...that thaaang was HUGEEE. And boy, was it hard...and WOW it lasted wayyy longer than I'd expected ;) (because it was too much to finish in one sitting HAHAHA plz get your mind out of the gutter...you nastyyy, child!!). The ever so famous penis cookie ($8) is a cocoNUT macaroon coated in dark or white chocolate. I've seen pictures of it with coconut shavings, but today's had rainbow sprinkles. I've also seen it topped with whipped cream, and I wasn't going to get any on mine, but the worker didn't ask if I wanted any :( if you don't have a massive sweet tooth, this may be a little overwhelming...nonetheless, delicious!! While it is a little hard to bite into at first, the coconut macaroon works really well with the chocolate coating!! Worth trying at least once!!\n\nIt's a pretty small store. I've walked by a few times and seen a line go out the door, but luckily, today there was no line!! There's a neon light sign outside, and when you step inside, you'll see that the walls are decorated in pictures of people wearing the red Hot Cookie underwear...so very SF. I LOVE IT HAHAHA. They also have a bunch of other cookies and treats (like rice krispies and brownies)!! Price is determined by weight\n\nBottom line: Whether you have a genitalia-shaped food fetish, or you're lookin' for your cookie fix, or you really don't like sweet stuff at all and are just #eatingfortheinsta, Hot Cookie is sure to have something for you. I think I'll be back!! Not sure if I'd get the penis cookie again (kinda really pricy for what it is), but I'd like to try some of the other stuff like the regular cookies--they have super interesting combos!! I think there were some made using cayenne??", "author": "Kithumini J."}

Though we weren't brave enough to try the \"Penis and Venus\" treats, they were definitely entertaining.", "author": "Julianna W."}

It was long, straight, and standing at attention! \n\nI'm talking about the line to get into Hot Cookie guys! But in all seriousness, being in the Castro and walking toward this storefront all lit up in red from the neon, I couldn't stop from thinking \"Hot Cookie\" MUST be some sort of dirty, raunchy, nasty and downright perverted sexual euphemism. And despite asking some friends \"in the know\" the question, I was assured it was just referring to the decadent and delicious baked goods this shop was selling.\n\nFudge Packers (chocolate cookies with chocolate chunks), Boy Scouts (chocolate chip cookies topped with melted marshmallow, graham, and chocolate sauce), and also the garden variety chocolate chip can all be found in the case. And while they're all delicious and reason enough to visit, the real fun in this place is in letting your friends know that you've gotten them a Fudge Packer or Boy Scout to enjoy at home! \n\nIf that's not enough, there are penises in the case that you can put in your mouth. Selfies are encouraged. If you've never tried one before (I know I hadn't), you might be pleasantly surprised by the coco\"nutty\" flavor found beneath the white or dark exterior! MMMMM! \n\nI'm talking about penis cakes yo! Get your mind out of the gutter... Or stay there if that's your thing! \n\nIf you're feeling frisky (which you really should be coming here), the real secret is in the skimpy red undies with the shops name adorned across the crotch. Purchasing a pair of these and modeling them for the camera will earn you both a spot on their wall of smutty shame AND... wait for it... A FREE COOKIE! \n\nAfter all the fun we had here, I couldn't stop thinking about the name. As soon as I got home I checked Urban Dictionary. What I found may surprise you! It's not overtly sexual, but if you use your imagination, it can lead you down some paths you may or may not want to be on! (http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hot%20Cookie) \n\nI'll leave that decision up to you, but suggest you make a B Line to the Hot Cookie if you've got a craving for something big, hot, moist and delicious!", "author": "Michael T."}

I'd always figured that the penis cookies were pretty overrated and touristy, but the other day, I brought some friends from abroad around the Castro and we stopped by Hot Cookie.  Since I was trying to show off the Bay Area and San Francisco, I figured I'd better order one.  It was pretty fun.  I love macaroons, but the one that made this penis cookie was a little dry.  Coconut macaroons are my favorite thing to bake, so maybe I'm just partial to my own, but it definitely could have been  more moist.  Oh well though, I don't regret it!\n\nPros: Delicious cookies, quick moving line, and, with regards to the penis cookie: it's a whole lot of fun!\n\ncons: kind of pricey, especially for the penis cookie.

Ms. Cookie has class, sass, style and she is one smart, tough cookie.)\n\nHot Cookie is a small cookie shop with an assortment of cookies (oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip, white chocolate macadamia, snickerdoodke, pokies, etc.) and some naughty, naughty cookies. I had to compose myself from giggling and/or laughing at the tray of chocolate covered penis cookies. The cookie looked about 5\" long and I kinda wondered why they were chocolate covered instead of vanilla or lemon covered cookie? It's gotta be the flava of chocolate...lol. The bottom of the cookie was decorated with shredded coconut. Ooh boy...is it getting hot in here or what? It's 70\u00b0 outside and it was probably more than 70\u00b0 inside this small cookie store. I must've been hot and bothered eyeing the naughty cookie (wink, wink). Well, to the side of the cookie counter was a self-serve refrigerated case filled with cool beverages. I decided to forego the soda and juices. \n\nI kept it clean and bought three cookies (oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip and a pokie, which is an M&M cookie). I enjoyed the cookies that I bought, which cost $8.50. Darn it; they were out of my favorite cookie, the snickerdoodle.

It's pretty much a big macaroon that was shaped into a huge black penis. So, if you like macaroons, you'll like the taste of the huge black penis. My guess is most people don't love the taste of macaroons and only buy this for the novelty. Nothing wrong with that, but if your experience mirrors mine, you're going to buy the penis, take a few pictures, bite it a couple times, then get rid of it somehow. I don't think mine was \"fresh\" but I don't think they can come fresh since the chocolate needs to harden. But dang, how much better is any baked good that's warm?\n\nAn important thing is that everything else (other than huge black penis) looked really tasty/fresh. Retrospectively I wish I also got one of their non-penis cookies because they looked so good. Since I had just came from brunch (and I'm preparing for a Hawaii beach body), I wasn't really in the mood for a cookie.\n\nThey sell lots of Hot Cookie underwear here and on the wall are many pictures of people wearing the underwear in different places. I think you can take pictures of yourself wearing the underwear and post it on their wall. Castro loves sophisticated underwear.\n\nSo reiterating the first paragraph I typed up, the huge black cock cookie is really just a cool novelty, especially for visitors to SF's Castro street.

Did they mold it by hand or did some guy offer up his junk as a molding shape? If it's the latter then good for him.\n\nThe Cookie itself was surprisingly good, I went with low expectations thinking that it was more for the novelty factor than anything but I admit that I was wrong. Soft chewy Coconut dipped in a decent amount of Chocolate to form a thick shell and it wasn't the really nasty, really cheap stuff either.\nThe Almond Butter Cookie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hot-cookie-san-francisco?select=LDfxY_tnqiH6q1COVIReQA#_Av3Pf-HwA2OobA7odCheA) was also very good - crumbly with a very strong Almond flavor and lot's of Almonds baked on top.\n\nThe shop itself is very small, just a counter with enough standing room for about 5-6 people.

They're full of ginger flavor, which I love, and they even have bits of ginger in them. But I'm not too fond of the texture.

It not only is empowered to quell a sugar and chocolate yearning, but it also is capable of tapping into one's naughty side. Indeed, if you're feeling frisky, Hot Cookie may be able to help out...but only so far. Yes, penis-shaped cookies are in abundance. For me, however, my only mission was to obtain my Butch Bar. And I did.\n\nAt around 1pm or so, Hot Cookie was dead. At our arrival, the case was being staffed by an extremely pretentious twink who was showcasing a nasty case of 'tude. Asking to purchase two Butch Bars was clearly an inconvenience for this individual, evidenced by his unattractive, sour demeanor. In addition, he seemed bowled over at the fact that I wanted to buy TWO Butch Bars. To myself, I was like, \"Yes, bitch, I want TWO! You have a problem with that?\" For a few seconds, I could feel my inner bitch rising up to make an appearance. Luckily, I managed to pay for my spoils and walk out the door before she presented her ugly self.  \n\nThe Butch Bars were less of a cookie and more like candy. Notwithstanding, anything with chocolate and peanut butter is near perfect in my book. I enjoyed nursing on those bars in the hotel over a 2-day period. \n\nAside from that lovely employee that was unpleasant, Hot Cookie offers some delicious baked goodies, in all \"shapes and sizes,\" that are sure to put a smile on your face.

I distinctly remember baby-gay Bryan, taking Caltrain + Muni to not only the big city, but the CASTRO, all by himself. This was a time where the Icon condos were a hole in the ground, Beaux was a nightclub called JET and the neighborhood wasn't overrun by coffee shops. It was a rite of passage to cruise the Castro as a teenager-- window shopping for underwear or laughing at all strange toys in the sex shops, where the workers just let underage-me into the store with a wink.\n\nHot Cookie was one of those places I remember going into then as a visitor and enjoy patronizing today as a resident-- it's still the same experience. The bright red \"Hot Cookie\" briefs in the window and plenty of photos of shirtless men, locals and tourists, who became unofficial models. Of course I loved it then, and I love it now. \n\nThere are plenty of options-- including the popular chocolate covered penis/venus macaroons. I stick to the cookies usually-- the M&M Pokie or the Toffee Chocolate Chip are favorites. The Cocoa-Cayenne was the first time I had some sort of cookie with a slow burning heat (I've tried replicating it at home-- they do it better!) \n\nHot Cookie is a gay Castro institution, in my eyes. That first day I set foot in there, I observed a bar named after me, the Sexy Bryan Bar!

Its a coconut macaroon, which makes sence because they are easy to shape and mold into shapes, and its dipped in chocolate. Its a rather large cookie and I usually cut it into pieces and keep it in the freezer for a late night snack.\n\nAll the cookies are reall good and I recommend trying them all. Dont just jump right for the penis cookies, try all the little ones they have to offer. You wont be disappointed. \n\nA little side note: They do sell Hot Cookie Boy Briefs that are really cute and comfy to ware.", "author": "Lizzie D."}

I've also tried some of the other flavors and they are also pretty good. My favorites are:\n\nPeanut Butter Chocolate Chip - My all time favorite. It has the right amount of peanut butter and chocolate chip. I love that there are chocolate chips in every bite! \n\nChocolate Chip- You can never go wrong with the classic Chocolate chip! The chocolate chips are chunky and again you get chocolate in every bite. \n\nCoco Cayenne- My husband actually wanted to try this because they were out of the peanut butter cookie. And to our surprise it's actually very tasty!!! I know it sounds crazy to have cayenne in a cookie, but you won't be disappointed.  The cayenne pepper really kicks in as an after taste and is very subtle. If you're up to trying something new, this is the one to try. \n\nChocolate fudge - I don't love this one, but my husband and all our friends love this! It's very fudgy with huge chunks of chocolate. It kind of reminds me of a fudge brownie.  Don't get me wrong, it tastes good; I just prefer more a classic cookie! !\n\n**insider tip** They tend to run out of the peanut butter chocolate chip at times, so if you really want to try it, give them a call to see if they have it! \n\nBe aware that there are a lot of pictures throughout the shops of people wearing the \"hot cookie\" bright red briefs.  If a little nudity scares you, get past it. The cookies are totally worth it!! :-)***", "author": "Megha P."}

If you look beyond the barrage of NSFW photos tacked up on the walls of this extremely tiny shop, you'll be treated to a solid variety of sweets. The toffee chocolate cookie was the size of a baby's head, and it was perfectly soft and not overwhelmingly sweet. I could eat a couple of these at a time without feeling like a total fatass. The butch bar is the polar opposite of that cookie, a mammoth chunk of peanut butter and chocolate fudge, with graham cracker thrown in for good measure. Take more than a few bites and you'll get the sugar shakes for the rest of the day - so give it a good chop with a knife and eat it in several sittings. \n\nGood prices, solid service, long lines, all in a district that's friendly and outgoing.

We went twice on Friday :-)\n\nMy three favorite cookies are the white chocolate macadamia nut, toffee milk chocolate and peanut butter.  The location itself is pretty tiny, but there is enough queuing space for about 6-7 people to squeeze in there. They were steadily busy all three times that we went in, but everyone was pretty respectful and were served in order.  The same girl helped us all three times and was very friendly. They have one of those rules about not using credit cards below a certain amount, but they weren't sticklers to the rule. I didn't eat any of my cookies right away, because let's face it, it's much more relaxing to stuff your face while wearing jammies in the privacy of a hotel room.

They have TONS of picture on the walls of people wearing the hot cookie panties. It was funny and fun to look at while u wait. Unfortunately the shop is really really small so only one or two ppl can be inside at once but there is never a huge line so it's not to bad. The service was also great! The people behind the counter were all super nice and willing to strike up small conversations (almost never happens in so cal). \n\nNow on to the cookies! \n\nThe penis cookie:\nI think I was least impressed by this cookie. First off I'm not really a fan of coconut, so a coconut macaroon probably wasn't the smartest idea. However I figured if u come to Castro u have to try this cookie and surprisingly it wasn't too coconuty and definitely didn't have that sucky fake coconut flavor. The only reason I didn't like it was because it was just too sweet for me. They coat it with A LOT of chocolate which would be good, but the cookie is really sweet as well. I would love to see another flavor cookie so I could try it again! \n\nToffee cookie: \nThe cookie was nice as not to sweet. It was soft and full of toffee. However I would say that it wasn't better then a store bought cookie, just kind of the same. \n\nGinger snap cookie:\nThis is a soft ginger snap cookie which is awesome. It was very soft and moist. It doesn't have a very traditional ginger flavor so that can be good or bad depending on your taste. My boyfriend didn't like this cookie but I thought it was good. \n\nOverall I would say that Hot Cookie is defiantly worth trying. There were at least 10 other cookie options so there is probably a cookie for everyone. Even the penis cookie is worth trying, just be prepared for the stares and funny comments. Also the cookies are a bit expensive so make sure u have some cash!", "author": "Toral S."}

No, not the sexually kind of threesome...u dirty-minded peeps! Threesome as in the penis cookie, me, and a partner to eat it with! \n\nI was in the area for dinner and was searching around yelp for desserts and Hot Cookie popped up, its business photo of a penis cookie was what made this visit a MUST. The cookie shop was really small. You can only fit about three ppl at the most at once in there. No doubt it was a true bakery, you can smell the aroma of the baked goods a couple stores away. Since the shop was so small, I didn't want to take too much time in there and made others behind me wait, so I quickly ordered what I came for. Penis cookie's official name is \"Penis & Venus\". \n\nMe: \"Can I pls get one Penis & Venus?\"\nGirl: \"Would you like whip cream with that?\"\nMe: \"Eh...no thanks...\"\n\nUh...a second of awkward silence passed and we both burst out laughing! She actually asked it too quickly by accident thinking it was a cup of mocha and at the same time I was caught off-guard by the question and didn't really respond smartly. It was too funny. That made it a memorable moment for me. They were really friendly and customer service was awesome. \n\nMan, this thing must've weighed at least a pound or more! No wonder it cost $5.75! It's girth was really thick too, but length wasn't as impressive...maybe just about five inches from the tip of it to the bottom of the balls....hahaha. Dude, this thing is like a monster on a stick! It was completely dipped in dark chocolate on the outside and the interior was filled with coconut macaroon. Sounds like a great combo. It was , but I must admit that the dark chocolate was a bit too overwhelming for me, but the shredded coconut inside was delicious. I really just wanted to eat the inside only, so I ended up having to dissect the penis cookie with a knife and fork. Sorry, Penis.\n\nIt's a really cute thought of making cookies into different body part shapes. I wished there were actually more selection for me to choose from when I was there, but it didn't. Still, I was satisfied, I got what I went for. Mission accomplished. I give them a 3 stars only, not b/c of anything on their part, but more so b/c I'm not a big cookie fan and it really takes A LOT for me to be a fan, which was what 4-star rating meant.

It does seem paradoxical that being nearly 6 feet in height, yet just 127 pounds in weight, that I could just eat just about anything I want to whenever I want to. And yet, I don't. I steer clear of cookies, pies,  as well as ice cream, and all the other yummy things I could be enjoying, in order to keep my weight abnormally low in order to maintain my (precious) running pace and the ability to fit into my boys' size 28 jeans. No, I'm not anorexic. Just hooked on the addictive endorphins of running.\n\nAll of this (sometime silly) self-discipline and self-denial thankfully gets thrown out the window when I'm in the vicinity of Hot Cookie. I'm a sucker for the aroma of a fresh-baked cookie and completely unable to resist its siren song begging me to eat it. I'm always at its mercy.\n\nI allow myself to occasionally enjoy one of Hot Cookie's bigger, premium-sized cookies when I'm walking out in front of their Castro Street location. Now I know Hot Cookie has a vast variety of delectable cookies, but to date, I've ignored them all, other than the straight-up semi-sweet chocolate chip cookies or the ones with the candy-coated chocolate (like M&Ms) pieces. I tend to stick obstinately with the things I truly enjoy, and I've found all the cookie bliss I desire from just these two varieties. \n\nI have to say that Hot Cookie will provide me with some great inspiration to do well in the upcoming San Francisco Marathon.

I've definitely bought my fair share of penises for friends since moving into the neighborhood. \n\nBut when I'm not buying the penis cookies, I am gobbling up the DELISH oatmeal white chocolate cranberry cookie. YUM! I love this cookie. It's one of my fave cookies in the city asides from Anthony's Cookies. I think the sweetness of the white chocolate is well-balanced with the oatmeal. I also really like the Double Chocolate cookie when I'm in a chocolatey mood. Super tasty, but it definitely helps to have a small glass of milk. The bf and I have also tried the toffee chocolate chip (can't really taste the toffee that much), regular chocolate chip, and M&M cookies. Those cookies are all decent (3 stars), but I much prefer Anthony's chocolate and toffee chip cookies. \n\nAs for the penis cookie, I can't say that I've ever had one for myself. I've taken a bite of others' though... it's pretty large so there's enough junk to go around. Chocolate covered, cakey cookie on the inside, and coconut shavings for pubes. Hahh... doesn't taste bad, but it isn't anything too special. I definitely think this cookie is more for the novelty than the actual taste.\n\nI love/hate that this place opens late... because that means that I can mostly satisfy my cookie cravings (but this is not always a good thing when I'm trying to have self-control...).

Alas, the cookies are not really good. This review won't be either. \n\nFirst, THE COOKIES AREN'T HOT.\nBut then, they aren't called 'hot cookie' because of a perceived cookie temperature. It's sexual. They ONLY hire cute twinks that the owner wants to have sex with, and the odd female thrown in just to attract more young men that the owner is attracted to. It's as simple as that. It was never in their business plan to sell cookies that are warm.\n\nThe PRICES ARE OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH.\nPrices are not posted, except on day olds, which are .85 each or 3/$2.50. Otherwise, all cookies are some mysterious by the pound price. Which is SUCH A SCAM. That way, you can never know the price of the cookie you pick, until it's time to pay.\n\nDON'T BUY THE UNDERWEAR.\nUnless you have a small cock. Or a vagina. The underwear are somewhat unisex in nature. Of course, they won't TELL you that. I'm telling you. \n\nAs far as the cookies themselves, they are ok. Just ok. Not bad, just ok. Very sweet. Very fatty tasting. I seriously suggest that IF you're gonna buy a cookie, you only buy the day olds. They taste just as good as the fresh ones. But for about 1/3 the price.

Not intense in the turn your face red sense, but definitely an unusual flavor you don't encounter often. \n\nI also liked the toffee, walnut with chocolate, white chocolate macadamia, and snickerdoodle.

I normally would be too embarrassed to try such a creation, but I was caught in a very rare uninhibited drunken form.. I WAS SHOCKED!!! I had low expectations thinking it was popular only for its novelty item appeal! It was literally one of the best macaroons I've ever had!!! Sooo freaking good! I ate the whole thing!!!!! LOL... but really I still can't get over that it actually tasted that great! I'm sure the female form versions are just as tasty as well ;) \n\nI normally would think phallic shaped objects at bachelor/bachelorette parties are tacky but these are soo flipping tasty I'm definitely ordering several dozen of these bad boys when I or any friends have a bachelorette party!", "author": "Angela K."}

I ordered two of the cranberry-white chocolate-walnut-cookies, my friend bought the pecan encrusted chocolate chip cookie, and I bought two more oatmeal chocolate chip for the trip back.  They have a variety of brownies and enormous chocolate and white chocolate dipped rice krispie treats.  I would have selected one of those, but thought better, than having to sit in a theater making loud crunching sounds.\n\nThe cookies here are huge, heavy, and filling. They cost by the pound, though, so keep an eye on the number of cookies bought.  But for the perfect snack during a German film, the munching kept me occupied, as did the characters on the screen.  They were also quite reflective when we stopped back for some quarters for Bart.  He smiled and gave us change, \"see you next time....\"", "author": "Miika M."}

The chocolate cayenne didn't do much for me; you could feel the heat after swallowing, but it might have been nice to have some cinnamon or something with a little bite while chewing.

Most of the people are semi-nude and laying on top of counters or outside of the store.  I must commend them on their bravery since I don't believe I could ever model my underwear in public, but I was definitely caught off guard by the naked people staring at me as I tried to decide what cookie to order.  \n\nFurthermore, the penis shaped cookies, looked awesome! Unfortunately, nobody I went with wanted to share one with me, so I decided to just order a Chocolate Chip cookie.  The cookie itself was okay.  It was soft on the inside and had a fair amount of chocolate chips, but flavor wise, I've definitely had better.\n\nMy recommendations: if you're going to go to this place for a cookie, don't go for the cookies themselves, but rather for the experience of the shop and of Castro Street.

He told me that they had \"rather interesting shaped cookies\" and always wondered what he was talking about.. until today!\n\nMy boyfriend and I went to Hot Cookie after eating at Super Duper. Parking wasn't difficult since we parked on Market St. and walked less than 5 minutes to the Castro. This place is tiny! You could fit 2-3 people comfortably (my boyfriend had to stay outside while I ordered lol) The workers are very friendly and knowledgeable about their products. Since I have a peanut allergy, I asked them which cookies had peanuts in them and which ones didn't. They told me which ones did and which ones didn't and informed me that all their cookies are baked on the same tray. \n\nI ended up getting three toffee chocolate chip cookies, one white chocolate macadamia, and one chocolate chip cookie. My boyfriend asked me if I wanted the penis cookie and I told him that I don't really like macaroons so I'd pass. The worker rang me up and my total came out to be $12 and some change. Then I thought to myself, \"I can't go into Hot Cookie and NOT get a penis shaped cookie\" so I told the worker that I wanted a penis cookie and my total came out to be $19 and some change. Kind of pricy, but whatevs! The cookies are huge btw!\n\nMy boyfriend and I went back to the car and enjoyed our cookies, after taking numerous pictures of the penis cookie of course. The cookies are crispy on the edges, buttery, and oh so good! The toffee one reminds me of Anthony's Cookies. If you're allergic to peanuts, you might want to skip on these cookies. Both my boyfriend and I are allergic to peanuts and we could definitely taste the traces of peanut butter cookies from the pan in our cookies.\n\nI probably won't come back for the cookies since most of their products are all cooked on one pan, but I might be back for the ooey gooey rice krispy treats!

A couple minutes later, white paper bag in hand, bf hops back in laughing like a giddy little school girl.

No big deal, as he's totally secure with his basically equal sized manhood (so he claims) and goes with it.  The rest of that day was a reckless adventure as Russ's fianc\u00e9, the macaroon, and I witnessed two grown 30-something men, regressing back to their high school years.

(I'm an equal opportunity guy, what can I say?) I've found myself in flagrante delicto with their cocoa/cayenne cookies. To top this off, the staff are cheerful and upbeat. This has to be my favourite bakery in SF, just for the quirkiness. And being me, I like quirky. So, yeah. Approved, 100%. \n\n...now that I'm writing this, I want a cocoa/cayenne cookie.

A friend's sudden hankerin' for cookies proved to be contagious so we all wanted to try it out.\n\nThe selection of cookies was pretty impressive, featuring varieties that I rarely see like coconut macadamia nut and pecan chip. After much consideration, I opted for the coconut macadamia nut cookie ($2.64). It was pretty delicious, highlighted by a sweet coconut taste and nice soft texture. I was a bit disappointed that these cookies were not warm, quite contradictory to this place's namesake. Considering that it was around 11pm and the texture of the cookie was chewy enough as is, it was still a very good cookie. My friend, swept up by the festive atmosphere of being in the Castro, decided to try out the famed penis cookie. Indeed, this monstrosity of a confection was shaped proportionately as a giant schlong, a coconut macaroon with a chocolate coating, with coconut pubes to top off the scrotal area. The actual cookie was pretty solid, but the novelty of suggestively putting that thing in your mouth in front of your friends made it more than worth it.\n\nIf you're in the Castro and need a quick and sweet snack, Hot Cookie should satiate that craving of yours.", "author": "Greg L."}

I spent about $9 for all the treats - not bad for the quality.\n\nSo good!

My bf's brownie was very decadent - the chocolate frosting on the top was so creamy and the brownie itself was so moist.

In San Francisco there are plenty of unique and really good places to eat it, this is one of the funniest and cool little shops. The parking nearby is limited and can be quite scarce depending on what time of day you go, or when during the week you go, but if you like penis shaped cookies or just cookies in general it will be worth your while. I didn't get a penis shaped cookie however, I got boobs, both the penis and venus cookies are coconut macaroons, it wasn't quite my cup of tea however. I guess they were good if you like a lot of chocolate or coconut. I also tried their M&M, Oatmeal Raisin (my personal favorite), Chocolate Chip, and Snickerdoodle and all were very good. The cookies are pretty good size and are not too badly priced, if you don't like cookies they also have rice crispy treats which looked pretty good and other sweets available. This is a definitely a cool little place to check out, so if you're in San Francisco or The Castro make a trip here. \n\nPros: \nReally good cookies\nFun concept\nWide variety of cookies\nCool pictures on the wall\n\nCons: \nOnly accepts cash\nStreet parking only\nHard to find parking\nSmall place, with no seating", "author": "Tony R."}

We drove around a few times but could not find parking. My guy asked an older gentleman on the street who was dressed in bicycle shorts if the place was worth it. His response was classic. He responded with a playful grin 'Well... do you like cookies?\" \n\nThis made me smurk and say \"What the hell, let's give it a shot.\" Since we were virgins, we first decided on the basic chocolate chip. They were your basic chocolate chip cookie. They were good, but not exciting. Since our cherry had been popped, we decided on the chocolate macadamia and the cocoa cayenne cookies.  \n\nMy cocoa cayenne cookie was slightly crispy on the outside, yet soft and chewy on the inside. It was everything a cookie should be. The cayenne  hits your lips and tongue a moment after and is a nice surprise. I would not recommend this cookie to anyone who does not appreciate spicy foods because it might throw you off. The cayenne is intense, but only for a moment.  If you are looking for novelty items, you can pick up a  chocolate penis cookie that you can enjoy while checking out all of the pics of boys in their red chones that say \"Hot Cookie\".

After the first bite, I knew I had to just try another one!  I got the snickerdoodle and it was also high delicious, although not as amazing as my pecan chocolate chip---must say though I am biased because I do love my pecans in baked items\n\nMy friend got a Chocolate Cayenne and the Toffee Chocolate chip.

It was good. Maybe they use special raisins? special oats? special bakers? Don't know, don't care. The cookie was good, not great, and certainly not worth $2.50. I'll stick with my Mrs. Fields.

The cookies are tender on the inside and crisp on the outside, and really fresh - although not always hot, they don't sell old goods since they bake small batches and have a quick turnover. Also try their macaroons - good quality of flaked coconut and delicious chocolate dipping.\n\nThe downsides of this place is the small size - can accomodate only tree or so bodies at a time inside the shop; it's really hot - no bueno in the fall time - kind of expensive - around $2.50 per cookie when weighed, and inconsistency in the baking from time to time.\n\nBy the way way, the brownie they sell in this joint comes on a stick, dipped in chocolate.

No, not because the double sized sandwich wasn't enough. Hell, half of it is still in the fridge as I am typing this review out. I just needed a little something sweet to finish the huge behemoth of a half sandwich. So what better way to kill the sugar craving but with a cookie from Hot Cookie? Conveniently located near the Metro Station so I could just buy and walk to my train.\n\n\nSo I got a Semi-Sweet fresh off the new pan, a toffee chocolate and a peanut butter. Three cookies, three different kinds of sweetness. Semi Sweet will always be my favorite because of old school Mrs. Field's when it was still made with love and not half way processed like it is now. Hand made cookies are always the best and the only way to go if you want a cookie. And I must say, semi sweet is awesome! Not too sweet and the gooey-ness and chewy soft cookie from being fresh off the new pan is awesomeness in itself. The peanut butter, for some reason, didn't wow me. Maybe because it wasn't as soft as I hoped and maybe because the outer ridge was encroaching into the sweet chewy center of the cookie. And the toffee chocolate chip...If you like it sweet, this is the one for you. I should have known this would be the sweetest one of the three. Toffee? Chocolate chips? Yeah, I had a duh moment right there. \n\n\nThe have brownies that I haven't tried yet. And the penis and venus cookies look like a novelty item based on the pics around the shop of people doing naughty things with them. But that is left for another time.

I usually get the simple semi-sweet or milk chocolate chip cookies, which are divine.  They also offer a broad array of other delectable options, including some rather risqu\u00e9, don't-give-one-to-the-kids, \"you're definitely in the Castro\" shapes.  \n\nThey also offer silver-dollar sized mini-cookies, which are a great way to sample the fare.  And don't neglect the \"day old\" selection for a steep discount, which can be a nice way to try recipes you wouldn't otherwise bother with.\n\nAnother plus is Hot Cookie's hours; they're open much later than other joints in SF, to 1 or 2am, I believe, perfect for a late-night treat.

The true appeal (if this sort of stuff appeals to you) are the Penis and Venus cookies proudly on display.

Look at all the cookies! It smells soooo good!\n\nCG: You want to try one?\n\nRH: Yipee! I'll try a chocolate chip.\n\nCG: Here you go!\n\nRH: (mouth full of cookie) mmmmmm! Are those Snickerdoodles! Oh my god I love those!\n\nCG: Want to try them too?\n\nRH: Sure!\n\nCG: Have a whole one, they are really good.\n\nRH: (mouth full of cookies) I didn't even notice you have White Chocolate Macadamia Nut. Wowzer! That's my favorite.\n\nCG: You have to try those. People love them.\n\netc...\n\nWhen I finally left that store, I looked like I was pregnant with Hot Cookie's gooey, delicious and somewhat undercooked baby. Since the guy behind the counter was gay, we can only attribute his generosity to his recognition that I am a die hard cookie loving fiend. \n\nAnd he sure did create a loyal customer.

The reason for that has nothing to do with the cookies but for this story.\n\nBefore I moved to SF, I came here frequently on business trips and would occasionally stay an extra day or two for fun.  On one such extended stay, a walk through the Castro led me to discover Hot Cookie.  \n\nOne night, on a subsequent trip, I had dinner with my friend Michele who had relocated here from New Jersey.  Our post-dinner conversation in her Jeep turned to cookies.  It went like this:\n\nMichele:  You know . . .  I really love white chocolate chip cookies.\n\nMe:  Me too.  But, most places insist on putting macadamia nuts in the cookie.  And, I don't like macadamias.\n\nMichele:  Neither do I.  That really pisses me off!!!!   (I already told you that she was a Jersey Girl and knowing Michele she was likely stoned at this point.)\n\nMe:  Well, actually, when I was here a few months ago, I found a place in the Castro that sells white chocolate chip cookies without nuts.  \n\nMichele:  Shut the f*ck up!  Really?!?!?!?!?!  Call them and see if they're still open.\n\nI got their number and called hoping that they were open late.\n\nHot Cookie Employee:  [answers with a sultry female voice] Hot Cookie.  We serve youuuuuu allllllll niiiight loooong.\n\nMe:  Oh, good.  You guys are open 24 hours?\n\nHot Cookie Employee:  Oh, no dude, sorry.  [Sultry, turned to manly] I thought you were going to be one of my friends.  We close at 11.\n\nMichele and I laughed from non-stop from Union Square to the Castro.\n\nWe arrive.\n\nHot Cookie Employee:  May I help you?\n\nMe:  Are you the guy who is going to serve me all night long?\n\nHot Cookie Employee:  Oh my god!\n\nSo, in summary, the have miniature white chocolate chip cookies here sans nuts.", "author": "Jeff P."}

I really like that the cookies they bake here are all really soft, approaching raw at the center.  That can definitely weird some people out, but I've yet to buy a cookie here that wasn't cooked all the way through.  Call it the steakhouse effect - these folks know the difference between a medium rare (BOO!) and a medium (YAY!) cookie.\n\nThey also have a selection of marshmallow rice squares and either fudge or brownies, none of which I've tried, not being a fan of brownies or fudge and come on... how can you really improve or screw up marshmallow rice squares?  Also, obviously, must note the more scandalously shaped baked goods they sell here.  Definitely pretty unique, definitely something fun to show and buy for visitors out-of-town, but they're kinda pricey and to be fair, they're not that good (if taste is still a criteria when it comes to novelty baked goods.).

I haven't been in a while so I think their staff has changed based on the not so warm reception I received today. I went on Thursday while I was in the neighborhood to place an order for macaroons for a bachelorette party I was hosting on Saturday. The guy working that day said it was no problem and that I should just come in on Saturday to get them and that I didn't need to order them now. I added that I would need around 12 to 15 of them, again he responded it shouldn't be a problem. Now, fast forward to Saturday, I make the trip back in to the city to retrieve my macaroons and was not impressed by the customer service. A different guy was working this day. I walked in and he basically ignored me. I chimed up and said hello. He just looked at me an continued making cookies. Then I said I need to get some macaroons for a bachelorette party. He responds \"like how many.\" I say  \"I would like 15 if you have them.\" Then he starts giving me a speal about how I should have called first. I told him about my direct visit to the shop, and he responds \"I'm sorry you were misinformed.\" So I just blow it off, then he says you know you have to pay in cash and it's going to cost you $93.75 for that many macaroons. I just smiled and said sure. He gave me a nasty stare and says \"boxes or bags.\" I had him pack them up in boxes and he was talking to himself about how it was going to be okay, that is why he was there to help the customer, etc. I was feeling a little angry but I thought just grin and bear it. Once all the cookies were packed up, he repeated the total to me and I handed him a $100.00 to pay. He looks at my money and goes \"Jesus Christ,\" storms off to the back room to get change. Does every one this guy encounters have correct change? Probably not! You work in a cookie store dude, get over it! I really hope the owners of this place read my review, because if I owned this place I would be furious that an employee of mine treated someone like that.", "author": "Sara H."}

By far the heftiest macaroon I have ever laid eyes (and mouth) on, no lie the size of a baseball. Best part was it was freaking delicious. It's a meal in itself though, so beware or share! Peanut butter chocolate - another solid offering, soft like the others and chock full of chunky goodness. Finally the Chocolate cayenne - yowza.

Why do you think they have the pictures of people in underwear plastered all over the closet-sized bakery?  If you're expecting warm fresh baked cookies, then bake them yourself at home (we all know nothing beats grandma's homemade cookies).  If you're like me, you don't have time to bake cookies from the Pillsbury premade dough package, let alone from scratch, nor do you have a grandma that can bake them for you (RIP Grams!).  That's where Hot Cookie comes in.  I stop here almost every time I drive or walk by, which coincidently happens quite often.  \n \nTheir cookies are the perfect texture- slightly crisp on the outside, and soft, melt in your mouth on the inside.  Unlike other reviewers, I've always thought the staff was very friendly- just sometimes a little distracted/aloof/stoned?  One guy that served me kept dropping my cookies on the ground- but of course, he replaced them with new ones.\n\nThe only drawback is I feel like I need to run 10 miles after I eat one of these cookies.  Instead, I trick myself into thinking if you take small bites, they're fat free.  (These cookies are also a great meal replacement)", "author": "Kristi M."}

We stumbled upon this purely by chance and it was proof that good things can happen in uneasy circumstances.  This place is ground zero for the \"alternative lifestyle\" to be politically correct and we had no idea until we got there but I have to admit that we would probably go back there just for some more cookies.  We got the Cocoa Cayenne, Pecan something and White Chocolate Macadamia.  All were great but the Cocoa Cayenne was just about perfect.  Chewy chocolatey on the inside, crunchy on the outside with an ever so slight evil bite after you've already decided you love this cookie.  It just sort of sneaks up on you.  Anyway, you can't be modest here or you just have to close your eyes, grab your cookies and run back to union square.  The cookies are expensive but I'd rather have one Cocoa Cayenne cookie than a bag full of Oreos.", "author": "Jonathan L."}
