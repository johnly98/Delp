I've been going there since they opened, and while there may have been better burritos to be had in San Francisco's Mission District (from where Chipotle seems to have stolen their original food concept), I always liked their build-to-order preparation, prices, and fresh high-quality ingredients. So why the two stars? It's the tortilla, silly, the fundamental building block of any burrito.  Look, I'm no chef, but all I know is the tortillas have gone severely downhill from when this Chipotle first opened. At my last couple of visits, instead of a warm, flour-y tortilla that I could easily bite into, my burritos came wrapped in what I can only describe as a thick, rubbery, cold, and tasteless cover (I ate on the premises).  Why would you do this?\n  \nSeriously, I couldn't even chew through some of it, and when I bit into it, the texture was more similar to a pencil eraser than an actual tortilla.  Listen Chipotle management, please take my advice and plan a quick trip to literally any established burrito joint in the Mission, or even head over to Taqueria Los Mayas on Clement Street (one of my new favorites), and go order a burrito. Any burrito. Unwrap it, take a bite, and pay attention to the texture and flavor of the tortilla. Then go back to Chipotle and do the same thing. See the difference? FIX THIS before you go out of business! I'm on your side, and this problem is SERIOUS.\n\nBTW, I've never had a problem with the staff or the service - people were always friendly and cooperative when I was there.", "author": "Richard A."}

I didn't see much on the menu other than \"Burrito 8.75 and something like \"Burrito bowl\" Can't remember the price and maybe tacos, I wasn't really paying that much attention but the variety of items seemed very limited. \n\nI asked the first girl to identify which meat is which and asked which is the carnitas, she pointed out the carnitas in the middle which oddly to me was shredded meat while the chicken and steak were cubed pieces. I guess there's different ways to prepare it but I'm used to carnitas (in Mexico) being cubed pieces and chicken and beef usually being shredded, \n\nAnyway, I say I want a carnitas burrito with pinto beans, brown rice and sour cream. She sends me down the line where another girl was preparing the rest of the burrito after the beans and rice and she asks \"salsa? medium, hot or mild\" to which I answer \"medium but I just want 'very little' salsa\" she takes this big spoon and scoops a whole big ladle of salsa on it really fast as if she didn't understand what I just said, then just looks at me and asks \"anything else\" and I say \"sour cream\" I'm a big fan of sour cream but again I didn't want as much as she put on my burrito! she takes another BIG scoop of sour cream and plops in on the burrito, she seemed very rude, and with a demeanor that said she doesn't want to be there and was pissed off about it. I didn't even see any cheese or remember to ask about it. \n\nThen I get to the register and the guy says \"1 burrito, 9.50\" and I'm thinking \"wow that's a lot\" I was expecting maybe 7.50 considering I didn't even order a drink and I can tell the burrito was very small. I sat down opened it up and realized just how small it is but I'm starving and had a hankering for a burrito; any burrito! I bit into it and the first thing I noticed is that the meat of all things was ice cold! no exaggeration. the beans and rice were warm, the salsa and cream were room temperature but who could tell about that, but the meat in the middle and there was very little of it, was really cold. Sorry but there is absolutely no excuse for that and especially if you have the nerve to charge 9.50 for one of the smallest burritos with the least meat in it that I have ever seen. The flavor was bland as well. \n\nThe only other times I ever had Chipotle burritos before is when we were taking my niece to Gymboree on Sloat which was next to Chipotle and that was when she was 2 to 3 years old which was 3 to 4 years ago and I remember a burrito there was around 6.75 or around 7.50 with tax and I thought that was a ripoff! These tiny, tasteless burritos aint worth no 9.50! \n\nMy final conclusion is that Chipotle sucks and is just a gimmick and I will never even consider eating there ever again.", "author": "David A."}

They did ask me if I wanted corn, I said sure. I was surprised they put that into the burrito. \n\nThe size of the burrito was smaller than the other burrito places I've eaten at. Actually, about 25% smaller. Compared to another restaurant in San Francisco like Gordos and Poncho Villa. \n\nTo me, a burrito is a burrito. Should kind of taste the same as all other places. But at the first few bites, I've noticed that the burrito was somewhat cold. Perhaps it's the corn that made it cold. I like eating my burrito warm or hot. But this was partial Luke warm and a bunch of cold. It was weird. That's why the three stars.

They may not be authentic...or inexpensive...and they might charge ridiculous amounts for a dollop of guac...but there's just something about them that  keeps me coming back. I was super excited when I heard this chain was opening up at Stonestown last year. They seemed like a beacon of hope after that dreaded Chevy's closed. While the food tastes the same as any other Chipotle, the service and portions were a bit disappointing. \n\nI've ordered my share of burrito bowls and my experience here was just strange. First, the girl didn't say hi when I went up to the counter, and then when I asked for a burrito bowl she proceeded to fill it with brown rice, skimpy amounts of steak, beans, and sauce and pretty much called it a day. She started to go for the lid to close it and I was thinking to myself \"uhhh hello there are other ingredients over there!\" I'm used to the servers saying \"everything on it? or trying to upsell that deliciously overpriced green gold to me, but not here. I had to specifically ask for lettuce, tomatoes, corn, cheese, and sour cream, and although all of those ingredients aren't standard, half of those typically are. And she made every additional ingredient I requested seem like a burden. Most Chipotles are pretty efficient with their service and get through their lines, but not here. They're typically understaffed and clearly haven't been trained well. \n\nOn a better note, this particular location, being new and all, is clean, bright, and modern inside with both bar stools and table seating.

The other space is reserved for a sushi restaurant that is due to open in the next few weeks.  Chipotle redecorated to a modernistic look, but the atmosphere seems cold.  The chairs are hard and uncomfortable and the poorly designed painted concrete floor was easily scuffed by the chairs.  The annoyingly loud music distracted from any dining pleasure.\n\nWe arrived today a little after 1 PM and it was still pretty busy.  Most of the patrons looked like students with their big big packs.  We ordered a steak burrito and a burrito in a bowl for about $7 apiece.  My steak burrito was tasteless and even the provided hot sauce did not give it much flavor.  The food is much better tasting and value at Burrito Express or Gordo's.  The Burrito Eater would probably give this place a 5 or 6 mustache.\n\nFor being a new place, the restaurant is rather dirty.  The floors are unswept, the tables are dirty, and even the adjacent walls are splattered with grease like substance.  Maybe the staff ought to get off their haunches and do a little maintenance.\n\nBeen here, done that, unlikely to eat here again.", "author": "Robert J."}

This one is comparable to the rest in terms of quality but portions here are SO tiny! Most Chipotles give 1.5-2 scoops of rice by default but this one gives one little baby scoop unless I ask them for more, which I always have to do. But I also suspect that when I ask for more of one thing they give a smaller portion of something else just to keep my overall bowl smaller. I've been here a bunch of times just because it's at a convenient location and it's always the same. Consistently smaller than any other Chipotle.\n\nSo I went here again earlier today and it was the final straw when they skimped on my corn for the last time. Seriously, everyone knows I love my corn at Chipotle and always get extra. The girl gives me a tiny 1/3 scoop of corn. I ask for extra. She gives me another baby 1/3 scoop and passes it. I look at her with my mouth open in dismay. How are you going to give me less than a default scoop when I ask for extra? Then the next girl gives me 5 strands of lettuce. Seriously? Y'all can go f yourselves. \n\nBut on a serious note, it's probably not their fault since their portions are always consistently small. It's most likely management since they dictate what amount to give. So management, y'all can go f yourselves.", "author": "Kari G."}

But let me tell you, out of all the Chipotles I have been to in the Bay Area, I have to say that this one is the best one. I might be a bit biased because I know some people who work here/have worked here in the past, but this location especially takes its time to make sure all the ingredients are fresh and prepared for the day and evening. And you see that right as they're making your orders right in front of you. Not only that, but the workers definitely know how to pack a bowl til the point where you're so full, you feel like you're in a food coma. All the other locations I've been to? Yeah, they'll give you what you ask for, but you're never completely satisfied. This place definitely takes the cake, and I'm really mad at myself for not coming here sooner because I know that I'm definitely going to get what I paid for.\n\nAnd on a side note, the restaurant itself looks gorgeous on the inside.

The container that had the steak was very low already. Instead of scooping out the rest (which wouldn't equal a spoonful), the server scooped out half of what was already a sorry amount.

So nice for the college kids to have another option other than McD's or food court 'cuisine'. \nMy one and only main complaint of this store are the portions they serve depending on who's doing the packing. I've been to many Chipotles in the city and throughout the bay area and I always order the chicken bowl. LOVE it! So far, the tenderness and the flavor of the chicken is no different anywhere else....thank goodness!\nThe norm has been the filled to the top portions with lots of lettuce and other goodies. \nThe other day, I had my mom pick me up a bowl. Since her English is limited, I wrote down everything I wanted. Always the same with brown rice, black beans, chicken, mild salsa, double corn salsa and lettuce.  Of course, she was just the courier so watching the gal pack it in, my mom has no idea what to expect. \nWhen she brought it home, I was starving by then. I carefully opened up the foil lid, expecting the lettuce to come falling out but nothing. The entire portion was so scarce! I was shocked! Thought I forgot to put something in there but when I checked, nothing seemed to be missing. Just very scarce with the rice and other ingredients. Wow. Did not think they could differ so much! \nIn hindsight, it was probably better for me to have the smaller portion....and who knows, maybe this gal was packing thinking it was for my mom who is a teeny, tiny thing!! Regardless, they should have a standard portion consistency in ALL Chipotles. But this does not deter me from my chicken bowl whatsoever!!", "author": "Naomi N."}

The tortilla on my burrito ripped and they didn't rewrap it or arp another tortilla around it. I don't know it was sort of a bad experience.", "author": "Conner M."}

Chipotles in general have raised their prices, something I don't exactly like, but if you want something fresh and quick - you're just gonna have to fork over your $.", "author": "LovesToEat S."}

I've been meaning to write this review, but I was hoping I could just forget about that terrible, disgusting, horrific experience, but I can't and I never will. I was eating a veggie burrito bowl and I felt something hard and sharp stuck between my teeth. I pulled it out and closely examined it hoping it wasn't what it looked and felt like, but it was definitely a fingernail, someone bit or pulled their nail off while they were cooking and dropped it in the food and it ended up in my mouth. I can only imagine what else has landed on the food I've eaten there. So gross. I felt like I had fingernails stuck in my throat all day after that. Shame on whomever did that. I will never ever eat chipotle again in my life. I found a piece of plastic at another location and decided not to go back to that specific one but now I know they're all sick. I hope the health department shuts them down. Don't eat there.", "author": "Cedra A."}

Yes, it has replaced Chevys but who can really complain? They dont have a liquor license to sell margaritas yet, but its coming! Haha I'm going to frequent this place more often just because it's close to work and school. Service is friendly, and there's always a line at any chipotle I go to, but it's worth the wait! Happy eating!", "author": "Ci- Ci H."}

Girl on tortillas portioning was awful, the three people in front of me, including myself and my boyfriend, had to order double meat. She only put sour cream and cheese on one side of my burrito so when the female manager with glasses took over my order, I asked her to add some to the other side. She proceeded to roll her eyes and dump a whole spoon of sour cream and a whole portion of cheese into my burrito;that was not what I wanted and the attitude was unnecessary. For my boyfriend's burrito, she forgot to add cheese so as she proceeded to roll it, I reminded her. She rolled her eyes again. The rolling of the eyes was rude, her actual burrito rolling skills make me wonder how she even became manager. Cashier was nice and I appreciate that. By the end, I wanted to take my leftover sour cream burrito and throw it at the horrible manager. I've worked at at chipotle so I know what is expected of a manager, definitely not getting Restauranteur anytime soon.", "author": "Jacky H."}

It's not my favorite place, I think the food is bland.  We looked at the tables outside and inside and they were all dirty.  Didn't eat there and left.  Went to Olive Garden, but that's another review on their site.", "author": "M. K."}

This  new location however, they really need to get it together! Where the heck is the manager? I cant believe even after a month, they still don't have it down. The line i was in would take 5 mins max at a normal Chipotle but i was in line for over 25 minutes!!!! Insane. The employees were either super slow or they just didnt give a damn. I think its a combination of both. That just too bad. If you come here anytime soon, plan to wait.", "author": "Ravenous T."}
