I wasn't a huge fan of German food because I always thought it was too hearty and fattening, but this place  changed my mind.\n\nWith me being half German, I wanted to give my German side some real authentic German food. My friends took me here for my birthday. It was The Best birthday dinner ever. The service was great and the owner is so friendly! \n\nI had the Schnitzel Vom Schwein- breaded pork loin with mashed potatoes and seasoned vegetables. It was so good I ate All of it. My friends ordered the Rinderroulade- tri-tip stuffed with bacon, pickles and mustard, spatzles and red cabbage. They shared some of it with me and I have to say it was amazing! I love the spatzles. And of course we had to have some German bier to go with the amazing food. \n\nI definitely recommend this place if you like home style cooking. I can't wait to come back for more.

Everything about the ambiance is right and really kind of a unique experience in the SF dining landscape of hipster-esque wood + Edison bulbs and American food with a fusion-y twist. \nThe food is authentic and very good. Note: the vegetarian schnitzel is actually schnitzel-type breading of vegetables, I kind of expected that they would be a side. Spaetzle were delicious and not too heavy. (You don't feel gross like you just ate a bowl of Mac n Cheese). I was delighted to see Apfelschorle on the menu. Beers + everything were excellent and servers polite. Next time I want to try the potato pancakes and Rote Grutze. \n\nThank you, Christiane Schmidt!", "author": "Teresa M."}

I was so shocked when I realized this had been here ~two decades and I am only now finding out about it.\n\nFrom the food to the atmosphere, I just loved my dinner here.  I really enjoy German food but am so tired of the beer hall shtick and was relieved to see something *different*  Despite the fact that it's a German restaurant, there was something about the decor that made me think Cold War era and the show, The Americans....though, on further reflection, maybe it reminded me of the movie, Atomic Blonde (which is the right country, at least).  Either way, it was something kind of fun and kitschy without being over-the-top.\n\nAll the food we ate was excellent and hearty - and perhaps more than we needed.  Two of us shared the potato soup with sausage, the tomato soup with salami, the house cured salmon on fitness bread, some kind of mixed sausage platter, and then the bratwurst entree with mashed potatoes.  I liked everything quite a lot, with the exception of the (1) tomato soup (which was good but not really my style) and (2) the mashed potatoes (which needed more salt and/or gravy of some sort).  I'd like to return and try the schnitzel and the kalter hund dessert :)\n\nService was friendly and efficient.\n\nI'd definitely return.", "author": "Tay H."}

The food was spectacular! Potato salad may be some of the best I've ever had, with just the right amount of pickles and onions to compliment the perfectly prepared potatoes. I went 'American tourist' and had the schweinschnitzel for my main course: tender pork, and they did not overdo the breading. More importantly, it was fried in fresh cooking oil--so tasty. Mashed potatoes had a wonderful flavor and consistency. We all had several 1/2 liters of Andechs, which was fresh and so damn good.

There's no designated parking lot, so we parked a few blocks away. The restaurant itself is quaint, charming, and totally German-themed with signs, memorabilia, and glass cases of mini-alcohol bottles . It was busy at the time (8:30pm), with only the bars being the open spot to be seated at. There are two bars, with two seats per bar. My friend and I sat down and the waitress brought us some German fitness bread starters. We ordered cheese spatzel to start and a bratwurst plate for the each of us.\n\nThe cheese spatzle plate was decent and huge. It came with some cabbage, carrots, and sliced green apples.

Usually it's too meaty for me I don't like sausages and I don't like the flavors used. However, this place is actually different and I really loved it!!! I highly recommend this spot and would want to come back. It's amazing I promise!\n\nPlease please get the grapefruit beer if you love fruity beers or ciders. It's this beer that tastes like grapefruit juice with a hint of alcohol I think I can drink 5 of these lol! I took a picture because I wanted to find it when I drink now. It tastes pretty similar to the grapefruit sculpin but much sweeter and definitely less alcohol percentage. I got this while waiting for my food and it is so good!\n\nFor a starter they give you an open faced sandwich. I didn't really care for it because the bread is not like American soft bread. It's hard dry bread- not my thing. But what can I say? It was free. \n\nI decided to order the cheese spatzle because it was one of the highlights on yelp. It's kind of like a less cheesy version of Mac and cheese. I didn't know what spatzle was before ordering this but now I can tell you it's something like gnocchi or pasta. I loved my dish but I loved my friends dishes more! They ordered the jager dish(?) which is breaded pork with the spatzle. The fried pork really reminds me of chicken katsu or tonkatsu (the Japanese dishes) but it has a mushroom gravy sauce all over it and spatzle underneath. You probably won't be able to finish anything because the portion sizes are huge here. I ordered the spatzle and my box to take home was extremely full of pasta. \n\nNext time I plan to get the breaded chicken with the spatzle underneath with my grapefruit beer and have this for two meals. My total was about $25 for 1 dish and a drink-not bad considering I can get two meals out of it.\n\nI think this might be the only German place I love and actually want to come back to. I would highly recommend it especially if supenkuche is crowded because the food is way better and there is no 45 minute wait. \n\nCan't wait to come back!!", "author": "Kelley Y."}

After downing a cold Franziskaner, settle in and notice your surroundings. It feels very ... industrial doesn't it? with Marx, Engels and Lenin staring back at you, you'll probably feel out of place and maybe a bit uncomfortable. \n\nGood. Because, when you travel outside of the comforts of your (foodie) home, you should feel like that. In fact, having a dinner at Walzwerk feels like you've traveled back in time to East Germany and that's what owner Christiane is hoping for. \n\nMy Berlin born fiance attests to the authenticity of this place. It is as East German as you can get. We took his dad here who was visiting from Berlin and we went full throttle on ordering several dishes: the uber crispy kartoffelpuffer with chive sour cream and applesauce, schnitzel vom schwein (breaded porkloin with mashed potatoes and veggies), grilled pork and veal bratwurst and the rinderroulade.  Both men had their eyes rolling at the back of their heads while making MMM!! sounds. They took spoonful after spoonful of creamy mash potatoes and stuffed it into their mouths. The MMMeats were all traditionally and expertly prepared. \n\nI felt proud ordering the Rinderroulade :) My fiance's grandma would make this rich dish in the height of the summer when I visit and it's seriously, the best combination of flavors you'll put in your mouth. The melt in your mouth tri-tip is stuffed with bacon, the delightful crunch of the pickles and tangyness of the mustard. It is soft, crunchy, savory and overall, a wonderful concoction that'll make your belly very happy. Try it. \n\nI'm so fortunate to have Walzwerk in SF.

The bier was excellent, and the food was well-executed.  Service was friendly without being obsequious.  \n\nI chose Sauerbraten and it was excellent- Sometimes it's a dish that somehow manages to be dry despite the sauce, and in this case it was perfectly done and the flavors were spot on.  The bread dumplings were firm but not stodgy, and the red cabbage was well seasoned and had just the right amount of tooth.  My colleagues had similarly excellent experiences with the Schnitzel dishes.  While the food is hearty, and the portions exceedingly generous.

My friend's 14 year old son has been to Germany, has a German language tutor and loves German food. His 19 year old sister got her wish to go to a vegan restaurant in the Mission, so her brother got his wish to have German food. Fortunately I have known about Walzwerk for many years and bicyle past often so it is in the front of my mind. \nBecause we were coming  on foot from the  vegan place, we arrived at 9:05 pm.  Restaurant had at least 3 free tables, although as I recall two were rather small. The host in a somewhat brusque manner informed us that they were expecting  some parties and there was no way they could serve us. \nThere was no \"Let me see if someone is leaving\", \"Let me see what  we can do\", \"Would you be willing to share a table\", \"Can you wait a few  minutes\".  Could it be that he was just an employee who preferred  to not have the arduous task of serving dinner to a group of four and was trying to make sure he got out for his hot date as soon as possible after closing time? (which I see from the website is 10 pm) \nI already decided I would never go back, and was chagrined to see tonight from the online menu that I will miss some delicious sounding veggie dishes and the  Radlberger lager, which is one  of my favorites.   \nAs for our dinner, we were not to be denied, we jumped in my Audi to go to the  new wurst restaurant in downtown  San Mateo, which fortunately is open until midnight. It was great, and friend's 14 year old son was \"sehr zufrieden.\" Wirklich.", "author": "Roy G."}

I found that part to be quite charming & welcoming. \nThey only accept reservations for parties of 4 or larger.  We were only a party if 2, but the wait was VERY short!  What I really appreciated was although there was a table for 4 available, and a party of 3 behind us, they didn't skip our place in line to seat the larger party. Instead offering us the larger table. It was VERY much appreciated!!\nBOTH of the servers were fantastic!!!  VERY friendly & SUPER accommodating!!  I had asked to swap my 2 sides for 1 different side.  The waiter didn't even bat an eye. \nWhen the order came, only one of the sides had been swapped out.  It wasn't an issue at all. They simply brought me a side bowl of the correct item. \nI ordered the pork schnitzel & asked to replace the mashed potatoes & veggies for sp\u00e4tzle.  I've traveled to Germany more times than I can count, and this is always my go to dish. It was delicious, and very filling!!\nBoth of the servers had smiles on their faces & seemed to really enjoy their job. \nIt IS a bit loud in there, so be prepared to repeat yourself to whomever you're dining with. \nParking was surprisingly very easy.

Both of our servers were great at explaining the dishes and making everyone feel welcome at this starkly appointed replica of the former East Germany.\nFrom the unadorned light bulbs overhead, to the chipped enamel tables set against dimly painted yellow walls, we felt as if we walked into a time warp of the former Soviet-era.\n\nBoth the mood and tone were quite inviting and relaxed.  It's as if you walked into someone's home and sat down for a realistic, home cooked German meal.  I don't think there were 10 tables in the small dining room.\n\nThe beer selection is pretty cool and exciting.  We were steered to the bottled Gaffel K\u00f6lsch and the draft Weltenburg Helles.  They were delicious!!  German beer---love it!\n\nA small appetizer was immediately brought to the table.  It was made up of thinly sliced, small square bread bottoms with cucumber, sliced radish, sour cream, cheese and a little piece of bratwurst on top.  I was expecting more flavor but didn't get it.\n\nThe kartoffelpuffer came next.  We shared these potato pancakes served with a side of sour cream and applesauce.  They were dense and plain tasting--the applesauce was the better choice to kick up the flavor.\n\nI ordered the schnitzel vom schwein and was served a large portion of a breaded, pork cutlet.\nThe accompanying mashed potatoes were creamy and tasty.  The pork was very good too.\nThe side vegetables were a fresh mix of squash, carrots and brussel sprouts.\n\nMy partner had the h\u00fchnerbrust gef\u00fcllt mit \u00e4pfeln und speck.  This rolled chicken breast was stuffed with bacon, apples and raisins and covered in a white gravy.  What looked like it should offer a-- \"wow\"--- in flavor,  just didn't bring that much taste.  The accompanying sides were the same as above.  Again, outstanding mashed potatoes.\n\nI'm sorry, but the apfelstrudel dissapointed.  The dough was heavy and rubbery.  I had a hard time getting through it with my fork.  Apple strudels that I have had in the past were crisp, crunchy and full of flavor.  This was not.\n\nWe may have played it safe with the dishes we ordered.  Next time we visit, I'd like to experiment with their cabbage and sausage dishes and search for more flavor.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice experience and we are so lucky to have all of these choices in SF.", "author": "Thomas D."}

Seems like everybody and their mama is getting engaged, married, and/or knocked up on FB...except us. We're over here like, \"Heeeeeey, look at my furbaby in his OOTD\".  *le sigh*\n\nI hate organizing group dinners because finding a reasonably priced restaurant in SF that can accommodate a large group AND have easy street parking is like finding a unicorn. Then, with some restaurants you have to deal with stupid penalty charges if you have flaky friends who don't even bother texting that they can't make it. \n\nWalzwerk is that unicorn.\n\nThe East German menu is carniwhore friendly with large portions at very affordable prices. They have a private room in the back that can accommodate up to 20 people, and finding street parking in this area of the Mission is not impossible. If you have a group of 10+, there's a set dinner: sampling of all the apps and 3 shared entrees for $28 pp which is dirt cheap for SF. Beer and wine only. Reservations accepted for parties 4 or more.\n\nWe had less than 10 people so we ordered a bunch of apps, our own entrees, and shared several desserts:\n\nA P P S\n*Kartoffelpuffer: Potato pancakes w/ chive sour cream, applesauce ($7): http://bit.ly/1JsqBh4\n*Matjes Herring w/ sour cream, apples, onions, pickles, pumpernickel bread ($9): http://bit.ly/1D8XQ7L\n*Gebeizter Lachs: House cured salmon, horseradish cream, marinated beets, fitness bread ($9): http://bit.ly/1Ipa1tm\n\nThe group favorite was the potato pancakes. Sure, they were just glorified hash browns but they were delicious with the creamy sour cream and nicely tart applesauce. The herring and house cured salmon were standard. We enjoyed the accompanying marinated beets which were slightly pickle-y. Not a fan of German bread because of that grainy texture. \n\nE N T R E E S\n*J\u00e4gerschnitzel: Unbreaded porkloin w/ sp\u00e4tzle, creamy mushroom sauce ($16): http://bit.ly/1HYQGSP\n*Kassler: Smoked pork chop w/ mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts ($18): http://bit.ly/1ScwCUT\n\nThe entrees are the star of Walzwerk's menu. Everybody loved their entr\u00e9e. They're huge, hearty, and comforting. My J\u00e4gerschnitzel (unbreaded) was tender and showered in this sinfully delicious creamy mushroom sauce (great depth of flavor). The sp\u00e4tzle absorbed this yummy sauce which made it even more delightful to enjoy these tiny dumplings. Highly recommended! \n\nI had a bite of the Kassler which would satisfy any pork chop lover. The thick cut pork shop was surprisingly very tender and moist with a pronounced smokiness. \n\nD E S S E R T S\n*Apfelstrudel: Filo dough filled w/ apples, raisins, nuts & brandy, vanilla ice cream, whipped cream ($7): http://bit.ly/1SL4zH0\n*Weekly Special: Bread Pudding w/ caramel sauce, whipped cream ($7): http://bit.ly/1gju9qZ\n\nDesserts were disappointing which is why I'm rounding down my rating. The Apfelstrudel tasted like an undercooked apple pie. Didn't taste any flaky layers from the supposed filo dough and the apples were still hard.\n\nThe bread pudding was better than the Apfelstrudel but just ok. We also ordered the Rote Gr\u00fctze Berry Pudding  (sorry, no pic) which I wouldn't recommend. The \"pudding\" was watery and very tart. \n\nIt was packed on a Saturday night and there were only two waitresses who rocked it. They were knowledgeable and quick on their feet. They also have their sh*t together in the kitchen as we got all our dishes very timely. \n\nI've been to Walzwerk before my Yelp days and it's just as good as I remembered it. Next time, I'm going to bring an ACME baguette to sop up all that mushroom gravy deliciousness from the J\u00e4gerschnitzel. Shhhh.....", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We got seats at the front, by the windows. Welcoming staff (owners, right?). Great decor, nice DDR touches.\n\nNice complimentary bites to start with. We had the great grapefruit beer everyone has been raving about in their Yelp reviews - yep, it is pretty good!\n\nFor entrees, we had:\n\n- Jagerschnitzel (unbreaded pork loin with spaetzle, and mushroom sauce). My entrree. Wow, so good. The spaetzle had a nice crust/crunch on them, so they had a nice firmness along with the soft. Mushrooms and sauce were very tasty, as was the pork.\n- Schnitzel vom schwein (breaded pork loin with mashed potatoes and vegetables, including Brussels sprouts). Daughter reported the mashed potatoes were very tasty, and the pork looked really good too (to me!). \n- Kassler (smoked pork chop with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts). The pork chop was very tender and perfectly cooked. Husband also liked the potatoes very much.\n\nWe had for dessert:\n\n- Kalter Hund (\"cold dog\" - great name) - layered cake with butter cookies, chocolate and rum, served with a little sauce on the side. This was delicious. These types of cakes can be dry, which is why I usually stay away from these, but this was very good, not at all dry.\n- Rote Gruze - this was a red berry pudding with raspberries, strawberries and blueberries, made with cream of wheat (!) and vanilla sauce. I was a bit worried with a dessert made with Cream of Wheat, but it was actually very good. Wasn't sure what to think of the texture (a bit grainy), but we enjoyed it very much.\n\nDefinitely a good choice for dinner tonight, and will be back!", "author": "June W."}

I'd never had German food before coming to Walzwerk, so I really had no idea what to expect before walking in. I wound up going with a friend on a Thursday evening for dinner, and surprisingly, it was super full. I would say, make a reservation if you know for sure that you want to come. But even if you're just walking in, the line won't be too long if you're there on a weekday.\n\nService is great. All the servers are super friendly, patient, and helpful, which is great because the menu has some pretty foreign terms. Wait was somewhat long (15-20min to get our main courses), but our server checked up on us during that time to make sure we had enough water/drinks/etc. Location is pretty sketchy, but if you are with someone else, it shouldn't be a problem walking around.\n\nThe food itself is definitely unique but very, very good. My friend and I shared an appetizer and an entree. The matjes herring (basically a potato salad-esque dish with fish instead of potatoes) appetizer was the most interesting of the night. I still can't tell if I liked it or not, but it did present me with such a unique flavor composition that I have never experienced before. I'd say that the flavors of the sauce are really similar to your typical potato salad. The texture of the fish, however, was the most unfamiliar to me. Upon first bite, my friend and I both didn't know if we had actually eaten the fish or if it was something else. We had to try a few more pieces before confirming that it was indeed the fish. Chewy, cold, and didn't remind me of fish meat at all. Not my favorite dish of the night, but still worth a try if you're want to experience new flavors.\n\nI absolutely adored the entree that we ordered - the vegetarische krautroulade, stuffed cabbage with lentils, root veggies, and lots of other good stuff, smothered in a fragrant tomato sauce. The cabbage was infused with the filling and the tomato sauce, so it was really delicious. The stuffing was combined in sort of a mash consistency, and it was just bursting with delicious flavor! All of the many ingredients used complemented each other very well, especially when mixed with the tomato sauce. The serving size is also super large and well worth the $15 that I paid for the dish. I still have half of the dish sitting in my fridge for dinner tonight!\n\nOverall, I was very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant, especially because I had no idea what German food was! I've heard the beers here are superb, so if I do come back, I'll definitely try the drinks and more of the hot foods... and maybe pass on some of the bizarre cold appetizers.", "author": "Sheila D."}

Haven't been here in about 3 or 4 years and it's still Fabulous.  Our server, Yahni (sp?) was delightful and she was super busy, taking orders, bussing tables, getting drinks, making change and she NEVER lost her zeal and provided impeccable service. As busy as she was she never faltered on attention to detail and giving us the time we needed to understand a few items on the menu.\n\nDrinks -  3 highly recommended dark, but light beers.\n\nAppetizer - A Special - Saut\u00e9ed onion on a puff pastry with Sour Cream and a nicely dressed salad.\n\nEntree #1 - was actually 2 appetizers, small potato pancakes with chive sour cream and applesauce, 3 fluffy and not greasy pancakes and house cured salmon with horseradish cream, marinated beets and fitness bread, nicely plated and extremely fresh. My guest was supremely pleased.\n\nEntree #2 - Also a special, which was a Pork Shoulder stuffed with apples and possibly apricots and cheese (can't remember the type of cheese), it may have been ricotta, but not sure with a light gravy on top, served with roasted potatoes and really fresh and crispy green beans. After my 1st bite, I was in Heaven.  Everything was superbly cooked to perfection.\n\nEntree #3 - Sauerbraten marinated beef, mushroom bread dumplings and red cabbage.  Again, superbly cooked and plated.  Mushroom bread dumplings were fluffy and light and the red cabbage had the right amount of \"pickling\", also a winner with another guest.\n\nService was very attentive but not overbearing.\n\nNext up... yes... we still had a little room... Dessert.  The gal had overheard it was my Birthday so when she presented me with \"another special\" of the night a Rhubarb Tart, it came with a Well Wish Birthday Candle.  So sweet of her to remember.  Other party had the filo dough filled with apples, raisins, nuts & brandy, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  It didn't appear to be made with Filo dough as it was a lot thicker and not as flaky as I have remembered in the past, but it was still very good.  We all ordered our Ice Cream on the side, which was delicious and honestly seemed homemade.\n\nThe whole experience was exceptional, right down to the low key ambience.

Overall though, the pancakes were a little plain, and the apple sauce (which tasted like Motts) didn't enhance it for us. \n\nNow the tri-tip... . it sounded absolutely delicious, which made the disappointment much worse. The tri-tip itself was wonderfully tender (tasted slow-cooked), but the meat itself didn't have much flavor and relied heavily on an unmemorable sauce on top. The pickle was a soggy cucumber lacking acidic bite and crunch. The bacon-oh woe-didn't add anything but pork fat to the concoction. The spatzle... well, I like spatzle so it was okay. In general though, execution was just lacking. \n\nOverall loved the concept, but the flavors, unfortunately, just weren't there for me.", "author": "Daffodil L."}

The mashed potatoes are perfect for soaking up sauce, and the spaetzle and sauerbraten taste just like my dad's. I'm not such a fan of dumplings ( never have been) but friends who like dumplings seem to like these. Pickled herring? Yum. House cured salmon? More yum.\n\nAnd then there's beer.

It doesnt stand up to the meal and will leave you feeling let down. I am waiting for them to fix the dessert situation and then five stars.

Dimly lit, it was homely and perfect for the Thanksgiving spirit.  You can't go wrong with mashed potatoes and their beer.  Maybe their sausages too - I didn't try that the first time around, but I will do when I return to Walzwerk.\n\nThey have this small dining area in the front and back area that reminded me of a living room with communal tables as well as tables meant for two.\n\nDaring to be adventurous on food, we decided to go with the starter of the Matjes Herring In Sour Cream rather than the Potato Pancakes.  It was significantly different.  The sourness with the tossed up slices of apples and pickles, is something I have never had together - especially when adding fish to the whole sha-bang.  It was a hit or miss.  For me, I liked it, but too much of it, may be overwhelming to the palate. \n\nTheir Schnitzel, breaded pork loin, should have been more flavored and left a lot more to be desired.  It was on the bland side and their broccoli served up as vegetables, were on the mushy side.  The only ingredient that was good, was the mashed potatoes.  Hence, just good.  No sauce at all.  It was a flop on this dish. \n\nNext up, the Beef Roulade.  The tri-tip beef was wrapped up with bacon and stuffed with mustard, pickles and onion.  Spatzle and red cabbage were served up on the side.  This entree was sauced up, indeed.  Their Spatzle reminded me of a more textured form of Mac 'n' Cheese.  It was different.  I liked the briniess to the stuffing of the beef.  It was a decent dish.\n\nI had a lovely time here and would be back for a special occasion.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

It's good, but I was expecting amazingness, and the three or four times I've tried it, I've experienced solidness.  The potato pancakes are really good, especially when das Gegenteil of nackt, so dip them or souse them up.\n\nIt smells in here.  That's not a bad thing, but you might feel like it is if you focus too much on it.  If anything, it reminds me of the smell of my high-school chemistry lab.  I think it's just the offgassing of particular plastics and/or laminates that are used in the chairs or tables or other various pieces of old, depressing furniture.  This smell is strongest in the late afternoon near the picture window, but the picture window is also the best place to sit in the late afternoon, and like I always imagine I tell my imaginary children, \"Life is all about balancing risks and rewards, kids.\"\n\nIt's not enough to know this is a German restaurant.  That might get you somewhere with the food, but it won't help you put up with the weird furniture and decor, so I'll reiterate what should be obvious to anyone who pays the slightest attention in life:  It is an East German restaurant.  No, East Germany doesn't exist anymore, and no, that's not a bad thing, but in order really to get what's being got at through the placards and posters and menu items and general run-down industrial chic of Walzwerk, you need to know a little something about the history of East Germany, its fall, the alienation of its former citizens even when it was once again a part of Germany, and geography.  I won't bore you with all that, but please don't complain about this place being uncomfortable inside, because that's kind of part of what it's trying to do for authenticity's sake.\n\nI really need to come more often, so I think I'll re-add it to my Taste of the Mission Week rotation this year even though there are still (and always will be) new places to try when the hipsters are frolicking in the Nevada desert.\n\nThe owner is cool, in both senses of the word.

I am glad San Francisco has German food -- I remember when it was a rare thing.  Now San Francisco has great options.  Just coming back from Berlin I had a hankering for German food and I know that Walzwerk specialises in East German cuisine --I was simply overdue for a visit.  There are all the familiar dishes and I was in the mood for the Schnitzel vom Huhn--most people might expect a large pizza sized Schnitzel.  I like the nice golden brown exterior and moist chicken.  The Schnitzel is served with moist rosemary potatoes and nicely vinegary uber thin cucumber slices.  The meal was completely satisfying and I like the East German approach a style different than say a Bavarian cuisine style.  I love the East German style-- very homey and absolutely delicious.  \n\nI absolutely love the interior design--all DDR inspired--I was seating below Marx, Engels and Lenin and above the door is a picture of Erich Honecker the omni present General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in his well known 1976 headshot.   Even the salt and pepper shakers are from the DDR period and I took photos of everything on the wall--most cool!  \n\nThe service was attentive and I liked the menu offering, the beer selection is everything I needed to get my fix of Berlin and East German beers.

Nevertheless, it was all delicious.  DH cleaned his plate, and his only complaint was 1 bratwurst was too small of a portion, especially for $17.  I enjoyed the potato salad and was surprised the pancakes were light and fluffy, not like a typical latke made with shredded potatoes.  The wienerwurst was not notable- tasted like a hot dog.

It sounds weird (or Danish), but if you like cold fish (I'm looking at you, sushi fans who ended up at a German restaurant), it's a delicious way to start off your meal. \n\nSome other dishes you have to do a little reading to 'translate' the equivalent-- One time a fried fish special (effectively fish & chips) was written in a way that didn't make the fried part obvious. \n\nMy favorite entree is the non-breaded pork cutlet with mushrooms. It's a whole plate of just mushrooms, a thinly sliced piece of pork, drenched in a gravy-like sauce. It's probably not healthy by any means, but it's one of the few entrees that doesn't have me discreetly unbuttoning my jeans toward the end of the meal. \n\nFinally, the East German theme is mostly decorative, with some steelcase tables and chairs and photos of previous benevolent leaders. I wouldn't worry about it too much; the beer and food are all over the German map. \n\nMain room is a bit on the small side with about 6 tables of varying size, but usually not too busy; there's also a back room but I'm not sure how large it is.", "author": "Krista L."}

There are lots of kitchy little touches to make the place feel homey -- little doilies, mismatched forks, glass on top of the table clothes, all very cute.\n\nWe waited around 10 minutes before we were seated and they gladly took our Gilt City voucher. We shared the cold cut plate, the schnitzel, the beef roulade and finished off with the apple strudel. The cold cut plate was delicious, especially the different pickles -- red cabbage, regular cabbage, pickle slices and carrots. The meats were really good, too.\n\nFor our entrees, I had the roulade and my fiance the schnitzel. The roulade was too salty for my taste and the meat wasn't very tender. I didn't like it very much. The sauce was good on the spatzel, though. The schnitzel is veal and absolutely divine. It was tender and not over seasoned so you could actually taste the meat. It wasn't drenched in sauce either, so it's still crispy and didn't taste oily. A must order!\n\nMy favorite part of the night was the apple strudel. They used a heavier crust instead of the filo dough, which I like more. The pastry was flaky and tender and the vanilla ice cream just seals the deal for me.", "author": "Alice W."}

In fact, it has arguably the best German/Austrian food I've ever had..? And a variety of imported beer from Europe.\n\nI can here on a Monday night with a group of 6 friends. While there were a couple of smaller tables in the front, they were able to seat us in the back (bigger room for larger parties). The place is quite small, and filled to capacity could probably only seat 30-40 people (if that). Which is nice--it's not so loud or impersonal.\n\nI got to try a few different items, and, again, while I thought it was all very good, I would highly recommend the breaded j\u00e4ger schnitzel (make sure to ask for it breaded, or double-breaded!).

I told my dad and grandfather about this place since they lived in Austria for a time and often went in to Germany as well. I'll be taking them here soon!\n\nThe chicken schnitzel was perfectly cooked. The potatoes that came with it...okay, let me just say that potatoes are usually just the filler and they're easy to just glaze over. These potatoes, though, were amazing. I was in such awe that I actually forced myself to slow down because the food was so good and I just didn't want it to end. Seriously, try the rosemary potatoes. My boyfriend doesn't even like rosemary, but these were seasoned and cooked to perfection that we were quietly fighting over who got more.\n\nNext time, I plan on getting the spaetzle, because spaetzle is delicious.

I've never had tomato soup that included a slice of lemon. But it really melded the flavors together. \n\nFor an entree, I had rinderroulade (tri-tip stuffed with bacon, pickles and mustard, sp\u00e4tzle and red cabbage). The meat was tinder and served in a red gravy. The sp\u00e4tzle was a perfect side, more interesting and flavorful than potatoes. And the cabbage provided just enough vinegary pizzazz to keep the dish interesting. \n\nThe rote gr\u00fctze (red berry pudding - raspberries, strawberries & blueberries made with cream of wheat and vanilla sauce) was a fitting finale. The berry flavor was strong and refreshing. \n\nThe woman with the German accent who was serving us was very helpful and accommodating. She was obviously very proud of the food, and rightfully so.

As a German I am very critical about German food, but I will say that this place has my endorsement. The place is definitely unique. At the entrance door you are greeted by an original sign from the time when Germany was divided by the Berlin wall saying that you are leaving the american sector. There is a picture of Honecker and figures like Marx, Engels and I believe Lenin have huge portraits on the wall. The atmosphere as well as the ambience is definitely east german. You will find minimalistic furniture and table decor. When it comes to the service and the food the place is really amazing. I had Beef Roulade with Sp\u00e4tzle (traditional german noodles) and Rotkohl (red cabbage). It was really delicious. They also have very original german drinks like Schorle (sparkling juice) and Malzbier.

It's in this weird location in upper Mission not near anything else so it never came up as a place to go with friends. Finally on v-day some friends suggested dinner here before the power ballads at Roxie. Probably a good idea because no one thinks eastern european when they think romantic and it was no problem to get a reservation for 5.\n\nWe ordered the small potato pancakes ($7) and thuringer salad ($8) as shared starters. I didn't try the starters but had some potato pancakes. For the main course I got the j\u00e4ger schnitzel ($16). All the food was satisfactory but that was about it. I think both Suppenkuche and Leopolds have much better food. I would say that maybe Walzwerk is more like what you might eat at home if you were to visit a german family - nothing fancy. Though that said I think the sp\u00e4tzle I make at home is much better than what I had here. It was kinda overcooked and mushy. Also I prefer smaller sp\u00e4tzle noodles.\n\nOf course Walzwerk has an advantage in not being as crowded or as loud, so you can have a nice conversation over german food.

I didn't think I would be able to try German food because most of what I have seen were not vegetarian friendly but this restaurant has a few vegetarian options.\n\nThe crispy potato pancakes are sprinkled with chives and comes in a set of three with apple sauce and sour cream. I have tried the vegetarian schnitzel and krautroulade. The portions are big and comes in a pool of delicious sauce. I ended up mixing the mashed potatoes with the sauce. The mashed potatoes had a creamy texture. I am not a fan of beets but the beet schnitzel made a believer out of me. \n\nI have brought three friends on different occasions to the restaurant. Two of them are total carnivores and said the vegetables were cooked perfectly and complimented the meat. One of them said he actually preferred the vegetables and could have eaten a plate full of it as a meal. He had the breaded pork loin with seasonal vegetables. \n\nMy friend (#2), who lived most of his life in New York, said it was the best restaurant meal he had in the ten years he has lived in California. He had the platter with the assorted meats, cheese, pickles, and cabbage with pumpernickel bread, the pork chops with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. He said the pork was cooked perfectly, not overcooked or under cooked. The brussel sprouts were delightful sweet and tender. \n\nHe asked for a recommendation on a beer and enjoyed the one the waitress suggested to him. For dessert, he had the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream. He said it was warm and flakey and the ice cream went well with it. He told me he definitely would like to come back and was happy I took him here for his birthday. \n\nThe last friend had the vegetarian schnitzel. He appreciated the restaurant having vegetarian options and thought the meal was delicious. This was the first time I had the cabbage with rice and lentils. It was very hearty and filling. \n\nThe desserts are memorable, so even I will find some room in my stomach for them. I have gotten the cold dog, red berry pudding, and the special chocolate pudding with vanilla sauce. The chocolate pudding was my favorite. It sounds simple but they made it so rich and decadent.\n\nThe restaurant has their standard menu items plus a list of specials which are regularly rotated. Back when I was on a mostly vegetarian, occasional pescetarian diet, I had one of their fish specials. I don't remember the exact type of fish but it came with a lemony sauce and capers with veggies and a starch (either rice or potatoes) on the side. The fish had a semi strong scent but the flavor complimented the sauce and capers. It was really good.\n\nThe people who work there, talk to each other (and when German speaking customers show up) in German, which adds to the experience. The walls have pictures and music is playing in the background. Most tables have silver metal chairs except the seats near the window. I don't remember if the stools at the bar are metal. After you are seated, the waitress (a friendly brunette) will bring you water and a complimentary sample of two squares of pumpernickel bread, one veggie option, the other meat. The drink menu is on the table. \n\nThey have a single stall bathroom. One wall has a decor case hanging with German products inside. Oh just a head ups, the bathroom doesn't have seat liners and I haven't seen any since the seven times I have been there. There was always soap and toilet paper, so you don't have to worry about that. Be careful and remember to watch your step coming in and out of the main front door because the steps are steep. There are signs alerting you posted on the door. If you are coming with a group of people, I would recommend calling to reserve a spot because seats can fill up quickly around certain times of the night. For people traveling via Bart, it is only a ten minute walk away (about 15 minute walk for those with chronic pain issues). \n\nI plan on continuing to come here whenever I am in need of celebrating. I continue to recommend this gem of a place to anyone I know.", "author": "S A."}

Hilariously more unique with its East German/Soviet era decorations, 2. Much quieter and down to earth allowing for quality conversation unlike like Suppenkuche's deafening madness, and 3. Has heartier German food that is more flavorful and has much better tasting sauerkraut (*when* the dish has it offered). \n\nThe selection of German beers are superb and extremely tasty (you can never go wrong with the heffeweisens ;-) ).\n\nBecause of its calmer, more personable (but eccentric) atmosphere and it's great food, when I want German food Walzwerk is my first pick. \n\nThe only two things they need to do is offer more dishes with sauerkraut and add in beer boots.", "author": "Art W."}

Came here on a Friday night, drove by, and didn't see a line so I didn't bother waiting inside until my friend came. Bad idea! The waiting room is in the middle of the place, so if the doorway is clear... don't be fooled! We ended up waiting 40 minutes. In the meantime, order a beer or something while you're waiting!\n\nOnce we were seated, we were starving! Shared the small potato pancakes with chive sour cream and applesauce. It was tasty, not sure if it was because I was starving... but it was the best damn potato ever! No really, had a nice crisp on the outside and the inside was like eating a mash potato. YUMMY! Then I got the Jager Schnitzel.... DROOOOL. It's like sauce overload, but my plate was sauce-free when I was done with it! Very tasty and juicy. The mushrooms gave it a nice taste too. My friend got the bratwurst and I tried a little of it... don't remember much about it, but I remember it being tasty.\n\nFood overall was pretty good. I would definitely come back. Service was okay, they didn't really check on us though... not sure if it was a Friday night or because... they just don't check on people.

We were asked to take a seat in a dark area in the back and wait 5 minutes. After about 10-15 minutes a group of 3 elderly people came in. We offered them the bench but they declined. The waiter then came by and rudely asked the men at the 2 top of a bar if they would move so the old folks could sit down. This seemed peculiar to me, First, there wasn't enough space. Second, the area they were in wasn't really a waiting area and they were enjoying beverages there. I am all for offering up your seat to the elderly but this was a bit off.\n\nAnother 5 minutes passes and the older folks that came in 10 minutes after us are being sat. Ok. Starting to feel annoyed now. A couple minutes later we are guided to a table. Right next to the one we saw when we walked in which is still open after 20 minutes of waiting to be sat. The table we are sat at is one that is SHOVED into a corner, sitting under a hanging plant that caresses me with my every move, so close to a table of 8 that I am literally touching 2 of them. WHY? I had to use the restroom but didn't want to make the awkward journey out of my confined corner to do so, worried that I would disturb the other table. I finally gave in, stood up, that dumb plant made love to my face and then I knocked over my water. Really embarrassing but I feel like I wasn't exactly set up for success. My water was never refilled. I ate my meal never being offered a water refill or another beverage. \n\nI can understand if a table is reserved but making people wait for a table that sits empty for over an hour and shoving them into the very worst spot while being made to look at the empty table is bad service. I have worked in hospitality for many years and this blew my mind. To boot, the food wasn't anywhere near good enough to make this worthwhile. My chicken was ok, the vegetables were actually great. My boyfriends saurbraten was borderline gross. \n\nWe would advise anyone to take a hard pass. People of SF need to stop paying $20 a plate for this kind of experience.", "author": "Disco B."}

Don't hate it, but I certainly don't love it, which is strange because I'm very much a meat 'n potatoes kinda person. But with that information in mind, you should also know that I think Suppenk\u00fcche in Hayes Valley is much better than Walzwerk if you are looking for German cuisine.\n\nBut of course, this is a review of Walzwerk, so onto the positives and the negatives! The beverages are good. Nice German beers and ciders. Nothing to complain about there. The portions are large, but you're definitely paying for it; prices are not cheap. But large portions also meant that I had more food that I wasn't a big fan of. The beet soup (which is, of course, just Borsht) is decent; not super flavorful but it was good enough. I got the Beef Roulade for my main course and it was no better than something I could make at home in a crock pot. Plus it was supposed to be stuffed with bacon (yummmmm) but I couldn't distinguish any bacon anywhere on the plate. And the side of sp\u00e4tzle was flavorless and just bleh. To make a long story short, there was so much food leftover that I took it home with me, but I pawned it off on the boyfriend when it came time to consume said leftovers.\n\nThe service was pretty terrible also. We waited a solid twenty-five minutes for a server to even acknowledge us and even then she only came over once we flagged her down.\n\nBut because I don't like to be a Negative Nancy, I will end on a positive note: the d\u00e9cor there is awesome! The place truly feels like you just plopped down right in the middle of Germany and I think that's fantastic. I definitely think the place is worth a visit, even if I don't think the food is anything to write home about.", "author": "Stephenie S."}

There was 1 (big table) ahead of us.  They waited forever!  We also waited forever but were eventually seated. The ladies were nice about it, we sat at the counter for 2.  The (in charge) lady said things like \"food was coming out slow that night b/c they have large tables\", I don't really understand the logic, but whatever. we waited to order, we WAITED for our food, we waited for our check.  \n\nAnd ya know what? the food was good, BUT every single thing we got was barely room temp.  The kitchen is literally 4 feet from where were were sitting, and I saw the gals doing lots of chores, I went to the bathroom twice between courses, (yeah it was taking THAT long)  and every time I looked into the kitchen there was barely any food \"up\" and ready to be delivered.  So it was just kinda baffling to me.  I would say the chicken in the cherry sauce was slightly better than the jagerschnitzel, but what looked delish going by (that we didn't order) was just the regular fried cutlet.\n\nAnyway if the food had been hot after all the waiting I might have gone 4 stars, but didn't seem like there was any excuse to cold food, serving the food from the kitchen to the table is the fastest part--it is taking the order, answering questions, getting the drinks and all that crap that takes the time (and YES I used to waitress so I know what it is like!)", "author": "Amy W."}

I have yet to visit Germany but coming from a Hungarian family, I've got quite an inclination towards this part hearty/ part acidic palette. I've got nothing but good things to say about this place so here are my favorite meals: \n\nJager Schnitzel - Can't go wrong. It's so simple and delicious. Also, its HUGE so unless you want leftovers, feel free to split with someone else and be fully satisfied. They'll even bring the food on separate plates and its still a lot. \n\nBeef Roulade - The beef is perfectly tender and amazing with the flavors of the mustard, pickles and onions. Spaetzle is heaven as always. \n\nChicken Breast stuffed with Apple - I don't know what made this dish so exceptionally good to me, but I was loving it so much more than anticipated. Great blend of rich cream sauce and the subtle, sweet tang of the apple.  Also, the mashed potatoes were the biz! Ate. Every. Bite. \n\nRosehip Tea - Simply said, a refreshing drink when you don't feel like having beer. I love this tea because it doesn't have a weird aftertaste.

And, she had never had German dark lager before, so yes, I told them we still wanted everything.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, our salad arrives.  The waitress offers to bring out a couple of clean small plates for us to share the salad, cool...aaaaand no plates ever appear.  At this point, we've just decided to dig into the salad and share the bowl.  \n\nAnother 20 minutes go by, we're almost done with our entrees, and the potato pancakes arrive.  Again, she asks if we want small clean plates to share this, and I just say no b/c what's the point now, right?\n\nFinally, I ask if our beers are ever going to come, and the waitress again reacts with surprise because she's forgotten all about them...again.  So we get our beers really as a digestive b/c we're pretty much done eating at this point.   Oh well, I figure they would comp the beers or an app or something because the whole thing was pretty egregious, even though they were nice about it.  But nope!  They charged us for everything!  Even though we could only drink 1/2 of our beers because we were so full.  \n\nThe only reason it's not a 1 star review was because the food was tasty, very tasty in fact, my jager schnitzel was delicious.  But given the completely unrepentant attitude of the service here, even if they say \"sorry\" with a smile, I don't think I would return when I can just go to Suppenkuche or Leopold's instead, both of which are closer to me and have never messed up this badly.  (In fact, once at Leopolds, the wait was so long that the owner felt bad, even though it wasn't his fault, he gave us a free charcuterie platter with our meal...now that's customer service!)", "author": "Jennifer F."}

Other than being a little more sparsely decorated and having some plain tables it wasn't bad.\n\nWe placed our drink order and looked over the menus.  They have a decent beer selection, with some difficult to find here choices.  Our beers came first and the others came later.  We ordered a pretty good assortment of appetizers and the Sauerbraten and Jagerschnitzel as mains.  I had the tomato cabbage soup and thought it was pretty good and something different.  The Sauerbraten was good and the beef was pretty tender.  It came with some good potato dumplings and some red cabbage.  The Jagerschnitzel was also pretty good and came with Spatzle and cabbage.\n\nWalzwerk wasn't exactly cheap even with the restaurant.com certificate, but I think it wasn't unreasonable given the food.

And place was cozy and casual. \n\nWent with party of 10 and surprise, they take reservations and have small private room in the back. I think that's really good for dinner parties. \n\nSchnitzel (Breaded Porkloin) with Mashed Potatoes & Seasonal Vegetables: Not bad. Pork breaded well and pork was tender. However, it was a little dry towards the end even with the lemon. I am not going to complain too much about it since it was a big piece and it was fried. So overall, this dish was good.\n\nJ\u00e4ger Schnitzel (Porkloin) with Sp\u00e4tzle and Creamy Mushrooom Sauce: Very saucy and tasty. Definitely, if you are not looking for something fried, order this. I was very impressed how soft their pork loin came out to be.\n\nGrilled Th\u00fcringer Bratwurst served with Mashed Potatoes & Sauerkraut: I think I was expecting a bigger piece of Bratwurst, but what came out was a longer version of the American Breakfast Sausage. I am willing to re-try, but it wouldn't be on top of my list.\n\nGarlic Roast Pork with Potatoes and Vegetables: Conflicting! My husband's and other party attendee's pork dish was tender and done perfectly. However, other dinner party attendee said his pork was dry. And from what I could see. It was truly rock hard dry. So chances are 33% totally dry and 66% chance of moist pork. I guess if it is a bit dry, you might want to tell the waitress. It is suppose to be tender and moist. What happen? Too long off the stove?\n\nSauerbraten (Marinated Beef) with Potato Dumplings and Braised Red Cabbage: Pretty tasty, Beef tenderized and moist. I defintely would like to go and try a full dish of this.\n\nOverall, this place has a nice family casual dining feel. People are super nice there and the whole feel of the place just works for it.

I brought two friends here tonight who were visiting from out of town. One was craving German, and my first choice place with a funner, noisier atmosphere was an hour wait so we went here. I walked in to put my name on the list while they were looking for parking. I told the server I had three people but she rolled her eyes at me when my party wasn't all here yet. The main room was full so when they arrived, we were seated in the back where we were ignored most of the meal. After already putting in our order, I later wanted to add the potato pancakes, but the server didn't come by to check up on us or refill our water. The wait for our food took a long time, and our schnitzel arrived black/burnt, hard, and very dry. There was a lot of breading and not much pork - quite disappointing compared to my first visit. When we got the bill, we found out they charged us $1 extra for substituting one of the mashed potatoes with spatzle (a minimal charge but I wasn't charged this during my first visit when I had the same dish). \n\nMy first visit was 9p on a Friday night. I called to check on availability, and the person who answered said it's a slow night. My boyfriend and I arrived and found that it was pretty busy. They did have two seats at the bar or a small table available in the back room which was occupied by a large party, so we decided to wait for a table in the main dining room. We had a different server that night who was nice and to let us first sit at the bar to order food while we waited. The bar counter had fun East German memorabilia to look at. We got the potato pancakes with sourcream and apple sauce which were the best I've had (granted I was very hungry). It was a bit of a wait for a table to open up, but that was fine since our friend was stuck in traffic. We ended up getting a cozy window table. The atmosphere was nice with the candlelight in our own little corner nook. We shared the roast pork with roasted potatoes, chicken breast stuffed with apples and bacon that came with mashed potatoes, and the schnitzel with spatzle (substituting the mashed potatoes). I liked the schnitzel (adding lemon), the roasted potatoes, and the roast pork. The chicken apple was dry and bland. We bumped into a friend who was seated in the backroom and said she wasn't too impressed with the place because her schnitzel was dry.

So the staff don't chomp at the bit to welcome you into the restaurant or ask you how many are in your party, but I feel like that is part of the Walzwerk experience, just as much as learning to cut in \"line\" and demand \"service\" at a bakery in Chinatown.  After reading many reviews regarding the friendliness of the servers, I was expecting to be spat on and given mad dog faces, but they exhibited German efficiency with smiles on their faces.\n\nI'd say their food is well-executed comfort basics: meat, carb, veggie.  The marinated beef had nice flavor but was a little tough.  I mean, I guess that's what I get for not sticking with their wursts and schnitzels.  The braised red cabbage was really good though and the potato dumpling was perfect to mop up the juice/sauce left on the plate.\n\nThe cold dog really is exactly as they describe it - rum and butter cookies layered in fudgy/ganoche-y chocolate in the appearance of cake.  It's a little dense and dry to gobble up on its own, but it came with a raspberry (?) drizzle to break up the richness, which was again, mopped up completely.\n\nI like that it's casual enough that you feel like you're going to a distant relative's house, where they'll feed you but not dote on you or ask you a million invasive questions about your life, but it's nice enough that the lighting is warm, the noise level is moderate, and you don't order at the counter and bring a number back to your table.", "author": "Jenn C."}

This place has a smaller selection of draft beers (I believe 5?) than other places I've but they are all good!\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is parking- this should just be a known in SF but you will have to find street parking and it may be difficult at times so just account extra time for that.

The flavors were there but the portions were just like, really?!\n\nThe place is small, dark and a bit dingy with little nats flying around the bar areas. - first yuck.\n\nThe servers are nice but they looked a bit greasy and dirty- like they needed a clean scrubbin or something or needed to wash their hands. Ya know, the type that looks like they just got back from a week at burning man or something?? Yuck #2.\n\nonto the food-\n\nI got the highly recommended bratwurst plate- it was literally a ginormous plate of mashed potatoes with another huge ginormous heaping of saurekraut + a teeny tiny probably 4 inch bratwurst. For $16 I'd assume they would at least double down on the  sausage and i found myself having to ration my eeny weeny sausage to eat with my extra large heaping of potatoes and sauerkraut. + the sausage wasnt even that great, I think a home grilled aidele's sausage would have been more satisfying!! At the end of my meal I had about 75% of my mashed potatoes left and 35% of sauerkraut left on my plate. I dont like wasting food but theres only so much potatoes you can eat in one sitting. The potatoes just tasted like regular home made potatoes and the sauerkraut had a good kick to it but there was just WAY too much compared to the sausage on the plate. \n\nThe hubby had the roasted pork dish, again the flavors were on point, but the roasted pork was this small piece of meat with sauce on top, again piled with another humungo dish of --yep you bet, more potatoes! but this time in roasted form and a side of bland veggies.\n\nWe finished off with their berry smoothie ish like yogurt dessert. Yuck #3. It was like a semi melted yogurt smoothie thing with berries that I made at home and left sitting out. Nothing worth the $8 price tag. In fact I'd pay $8 not to eat it again!\n\nUpon leaving, the hubby turned to me and said \"If i had to eat this crap everyday to be with Heidi Klum, I'd have to dump her right away\".

My friend described it well as having a \"cottage\" feel. Relaxing, cozy, unassuming. Random German trinkets, posters, and photos from the window.....to the wall! (Sorry, I had to say it). Also, I was diggin' the strange black and white photographs of Marx and other old German men with beards. \n\n1 star for good service. Our waitress was extremely friendly, helpful, and understanding of our lack of German beer and cuisine knowledge. \n\n1 star for good food, and *bonus points for VEGETARIAN OPTIONS! The potato pancakes were good, but my friend prefers the ones at Suppenkuche (I'd have to try Suppenkuche again to compare). Their MASHED POTATOS were HELLA good. Tried both the vegetarian schnitzel and vegetarian roulade. The schnieztel was breaded vegetables (turnip, YAMS, and beets), kind of like a \"German tempura.\" The roulade was a cabbage roll filled with rice and vegetables. I equally liked both, depends on what kind of dish you're in the mood for. \n \nOverall, I really enjoyed our time here. The decision between Walzwerk and Suppenkuche really depends on the ambiance you're going for---if you're looking for a fun, lively, younger and perhaps trendier location, then go with Suppenkuche (also better for larger groups as there is a LOT more seating and larger tables). If you're looking for a quieter, quainter location, then definitely go for Walzwerk. =)", "author": "Diane G."}

AND IT'S DELICIOUS MINUS THE PLANE RIDE! \n\nThanks to the lack of communication by Schmidt's closure for private event on Sunday evening, we came to Walzwerk instead and had a great German dinner. By far, the best German food I had in SF.\n\nWe walked in with no reservation and the place was packed on a Sunday night at 8pm. We got lucky as a table just opened up and we got seated immediately. There were 3 of us so we decided to order everythign to share family style. We ordered:\n\n1. SMALL POTATO PANCAKES WITH CHIVE SOUR CREAM AND APPLESAUCE. \n\nWOW! Best potato pancakes I've ever had. The outter layer is crispy, but in the inside is creamy and fluffy. The chive sour cream is a great match and it really brings out the flavor of the potatoes. \n\n2. SOLJANKA (TOMATO - CABAGE SOUP WITH SALAMI, BACON & \nPICKLES)\n\nI ordered this because I love soup. This is a little too sour for my taste bud, but friends and family know that I can't really take anything too sour. But the broth is very hearty, very flavorful. It has a strong tomatoes flavors and the salami and bacons are salty, which makes the soup so appetizing. \n\nWe ordered 3 entrees and shared them family style:\n\n3. GRILLED TH\u00dcRINGER BRATWURST SERVED WITH MASHED POTATOES & SAUERKRAUT\n\nWow! I love Bratwurst and this one is dynamite. The sausage casing is seared to crispy and so flavorful. The meat mixture is great. Mashed potatoes are so creamy and the sauerkraut is nicely marinated, but still retained a good slightly crunchy texture of the cabbage. If you haven't have fresh sauerkraut (no, not the bottled stuff you get from the supermarket for your BBQ dogs), you have to try these sauerkraut. You will never eat the bottled stuff ever again. \n\n4. SAUERBRATEN (MARINATED BEEF) WITH POTATO DUMPLINGS AND BRAISED RED CABBAGE\n\nI thought this dish was only ok for me mainly because it was a little sour, but the beef slices were very tender and you can cut it with a folk. It has great flavors and the sauce is very hearty. The potato dumplings (German's version of the Italian's gnocchi) were so fluffy and covered in creamy sauce. \n\n5. SCHNITZEL (BREADED PORKLOIN) WITH MASHED POTATOES & \nSTEWED GREEN BEANS\n\nThe Schnitzel (German version of the Japanese tontatsu or pork cutlet) has a very thin breading on the outside layer, but fried to perfect golden brown and crispy and the meat is still moist on the inside. The green beans were heavenly. \n\n6. APPLE STRUDEL WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM\n\nGreat puff pastry and the stuffing was apples, some nuts and I think raisins? It was all good and came out nice and hot.\n\nTotal bill $120 for the 3 of us including tax and tips for all the food above, 3 beers and 2 apple scholes (really delicious apple juice). Not bad at all and more importantly we all had a great meal and our half German friend really enjoyed his dinner. Everything was well made, very authentic (yes, we speak from experience of dining in Germany) and our server, Francis was super nice and very helpful when it comes to helping us decide on which beer to order from their very extensive all German beer menu. \n\nThe moral of my story is -- sometimes a backup plan can turn out to be better than the original plan. \n\nYes, we'll be back definitely.

First of all, everything about this place screams \"East Germany\" from the moment you enter the restaurant even to the very last moment where you shut the door behind you; the instant you set foot into the restaurant you'll be surrounded by rustic post-war propaganda posters from around the DDR, and also by your standard hof-style wooden \"picnic\" tables and homey seatings... \n\nOn to the food and brew: as usual I was the first to arrive, so while waiting for my fellow diners to arrive, I decided to start the night off right with an erdinger kristallweizen. The erdinger was a perfect match with my sauerbraten which, as other yelpers have pointed out, wasn't so sauer, but was still a rare treat for a germanophile such as myself. The highlight of my dish wasn't the braten itself but the potato dumplings--I wish I could order a whole bucket of these and swim in a bathtub full of them. \n\nMy second pair-up of the evening was the draft radeberger (the only other place I've seen that has this outside of Germany was this awesome German Pub in the Chaoyang district in Beijing and Suppenk\u00fcche) and a piece of J\u00e4gerschnitzel I stole from the fellow diner to the right--the creamy mushroom sauce and the radeberger literally coagulated into some yummy fluid  sensation in my mouth, which put me into a 5-minute mini food coma.\n\nThis restaurant really deserves five stars, but the nature of Eastern German cuisine sorta takes away that last star; even though the food (and beer) at Walzwerk is awesome, you're basically paying top-dollar for really good comfort food.", "author": "Scott S."}

I lived in West Berlin during that time -- it was like a time warp for me to come into this restaurant -- Absolutely loved it -- although I can see why others might think its a bit quirky.\n\nThe only reason that I didn't give them 5 stars is that I went here through a Groupon offering.  There were just two of us.  I paid with the voucher -- and was ready to pay the amount over the voucher -- when I noticed they had added in the tip already (even though we weren't a party of 6 or more) -- plus on the credit card receipt, they had added the line for an additional tip.  \n\nI own a small business in the City -- and understand that some customers screw you over by not leaving a tip on the full amount.

The opportunity never came. It's specifically hard to define German good to someone who hasn't had it when I haven't been to Germany myself. But for me it's the beer and the flavors that make you feel full though not bloated. Oh, and I always thought German was one of the most romantic languages (I hate the sound of French) so if I have the chance to hear people speaking German next to me, I will take it.\n\nSo, we arrived here and sat by the window. I liked that little altar and the beer menu at all times framed. They were out of K\u00f6stritzer, so I got Radeberger and my dinner companion got Weltenburg Helles. I would normally get Franziskaner as it is my favorite beer but not this time.\n\nWe got our drinks fast.  For starters, we got the potatoe pancakes and a sausage with more potatoes (?) Anyway, Those potatoe pancakes were mathematically perfectly round, and the sausage was also great. We were tasting each other's drink's, food. This is a place where you definitely want to share.\n\nWe talked and talked and talked. Again, keep in mind \"You are leaving the American Sector.\" This isn't Starbucks where your waiter smiles like an idiot and asks about your day. This isn't a place where you take priority. This is European style. You either like it, or not. They don't care. If you want to be spoiled, go to Burger King or grow up! In fact, I wish more places were real and not fake about their \"customer service.\"\n\nHowever; when you have a beer, and you're in a nice place, well, it's worth the wait. I think they must have been backed up in the kitchen as neither tables had any food. Not a single person seemed to be really concerned with this. I know I wasn't. I ordered the \"Breast of Chicken stuffed with Apples & Bacon (with Sundried Cherry Sauce), Mashed Potatoes, and Seasonal Vegetables.\"  He got something with red cabbage. I forget what exactly.\n\n//Beware: Almost all entrees are pork. Probably not vegetarian options but check first. Menu at the window or online. \n\nBy the time we got our dinner. I wasn't even really hungry anymore! Don't you hate it when that happens? I got a to go box and had lunch and dinner for the next day!\n\nBut, yes, the bill was rather steep. We paid almost $100. I'm not saying the food wasn't worth it, or the beers. In fact, if there's a place where I'd spend $100 for dinner, it would have to be German or one of my favorite spots in the city. \n\nThe bathroom has this weird gallery full of German hygiene trinkets. Interesting. Also, portraits of Marx....no....La Vey! Tell me that is NOT La Vey's face on the wall, dare you to!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-28", "description": "I have to admit, when I first think of German food, images of bratwursts and sauerkraut with generous pints/boots of beer come to mind (or at least, that's what they have at Oktoberfest).  Suffice to say, I was glad to see so much more was to be had.  But first and foremost,  I have to say, the Potato Pancake is AWESOME.  Since we had such a large group, we got multiple orders of it, and these babies were flying off the table.  Granted, these are just glorified hash browns, but I LOVE hash browns!\n\nAs for our entrees, we obviously got ourselves an order of Bratwurst with Mashed Potatoes and Saurkra and it was a mighty hefty serving.  The potatoes were rather bland though (that's what garlic mashed will do to you), but I loved the bratwursts.  You imagine bratwursts tasting almost the same everywhere, but I certainly liked this one more than anything I've had before.  \n\nWe also ordered a plate of the Chicken stuffed with Apple and Bacon as well as the Jager Schnitzel (Porkloin with Cream of Mushroom sauce).  They were both just okay, but I thought the Schnitzel was the better of the two for me, even if a couple of my friends didn't really care much for it.  It loosely reminds me of a dish I had as I was growing up, so maybe that's why I liked it better than them.  As for the Chicken, it was a bit of a miss for me.  The dish sounded so good on the menu, but it was a little meh for me, which is disappointing because it seemed like it would be so good!   The Cheese Spatzle was not bad, and it went well with the chicken and pork entrees (it's almost like rice!), but eating too much of it starts to get kind of gross. \n\nOne knock on the place is that while they can accommodate groups, you may want to keep it below a group of 15 or so.  Our group was about that size (probably larger) and we were seated in a room at the back of the restaurant.  It was a smaller sized room, and so we really had to work to squeeze in at one long table.  We got it done, but it wasn't the most comfortable fit.  The service was friendly and attentive though (helped being in the back since we were right by the kitchen), and they rotated around to help our table instead of just one person managing all of us.  In any case, I'd want to come back to get more hash browns!", "author": "Mike L."}

So I decided to try this place as a potential spot to bring them because the menu looked great. I was REALLY hoping to like this place and had been waiting all week to go. Not only was I unimpressed, I was very disappointed. \n\nFrom the moment we walked in things went down hill. \n\nThis place does not take reservations for less than 8 people, which is fine. When we got there the server told us the wait would be an hour for two people. This place is VERY small (only about 8 or 9 tables total) with only four seats at the bar (which were all full), so we went and got a drink and came back 45 minutes later. When we got there we were told that our table had been given away 20 minutes ago, and we would have to wait another hour. We were shocked. After deciding to go somewhere else, the gave us a table. We were really exciting and sat down and looking forward to the awesome food!\n\nThe same server came to take our drink order, I started by saying I wanted water and she turned and walked away. We asked her to wait because we also wanted to order other drinks. At this moment it became clear, this place is like that soup restaurant on Seinfeld (which sucks for a sit down place): You must know exactly what you want and bark it out very quickly--you do not ask questions about the menu or ask for suggestions. The server acted like you are more of a nuisance than a customer.  My boyfriend barely got the words out \"I would like an amber...\" and she was gone again. \n\n\nWhen she came back we quickly gave our orders without asking any questions or for any suggestions.\n\nWhen the food finally arrived it looked great but was cold. Not just \"not hot\", it was cold--like it had been sitting out for 15 minutes (although, the center of my mashed potatoes were warm and that part tasted great).  By this point, we gave up trying to take pleasure in this experience and just wanted to leave.  It was not enjoyable to be there. No one ever came back to ask how our food was or if we needed anything and, honestly, with such a rude server I did not want to chance grabbing her attention and sending my food back to be warmed, anyway. I ended up putting my whole meal in a to-go box to take home and heat up. I end-up finally eating my meal at home at 11pm. \n\nThe service was really bad and the food just was not worth it.

Which was a mistake - the back had three tables, one with LOUD, drunk tourists (how did they find this place?) and another with a baby.  As in, the baby was on top of the table.  Interesting.\n\nAnother problem I'm blaming on the back room is the service - it was just not there.  Every time a waitress wandered into the back room we flagged her down, but it almost seemed like they forgot people were in the back room at all.\n\nContrasting with the stark decor, everything on the menu seemed a few dollars too expensive for what it actually was.  We ordered the potato pancake that Yelp is so fond of - $7 for three glorified hash browns.  For my main dish I had the beef roulade which had a great, tasty description but the taste left something to be desired.  I think what really threw me off was the warm, melty pickles in the roulade.  Now I know - pickles are have to be crunchy!  The red cabbage and spaetzle were good, but they're supposed to be sides, not the main event.\n\nFor dessert we went with the apple strudel - so classic.  This was definitely the high point of the meal.  It was just a normal, classic strudel, but it helped wash down the strange roulade aftertaste.", "author": "Cathy Y."}

It's funky and cool with posters, unique chairs, etc. The dining area is full when we arrived (6.30 pm), so my friend and I decided to sit at the bar. \n\nOnce seated, we're greeted by the server who brought us amuse bouche (bread with gruyere or salami). Our server is so nice and friendly that she let me try a few beers before ordering. My pick was schwarzbier which is a German dark lager beer. \n\nI got the trout special which comes with green beans, brussels sprout and mashed potatoes (which I substituted with spatzle for $2 extra). The trout is topped with sliced almonds. My friend's jager schnitzel with creamy mushroom sauce was so delicious.

The industrial decor and drunk servers threw me back to the Cold War. Well, except for the Hispanic cooks who occasionally entered the tiny, loud, and crowded dining area to serve food while the drunk German waitress mingled with guests and dropped plates on the ground as she stumbled about. \n\nEssentially, no one who works here gives a fuck. And you shouldn't either. You get seated when it's time to get seated. You get waited on when they think it's time for you to get waited on. The food is rich, simple, unique. Out of this world danktastic? Hardly. The herring appetizer was my favorite dish, by far. Sure, there were moments when we witnessed disgruntled guests stand and leave after waiting several minutes for one of the two waitresses, most likely a sober one, to acknowledge them. Clearly understaffed, yes, but I believe this is all part of the experience. I'll give this place another try soon.", "author": "Scott G."}

Spaetzle that is too much to deal with. Even pickled herring in what looks like tartar sauce? Okay Walzwerk, I'll eat it. Wash it down with a beer mixed with Coke? Why not? By the time they've charmed the pants off of you to fit more food into your ever expanding stomach, you start to wonder how you ever got into this predicament. \n\nIf there is ever a place to lose your mind and go hog wild, this is it.

I would say the food is a solid 3.5, but the service is so friendly and the ambiance so interesting, I have to boost my rating up to a 4. It's a small space, but it was just my friend and me, so we were able to sit at the bar (which actually enhanced my experience because we were able to chat with the servers, who I found to be lovely people). In summary:\n\n1) We started with the house cured salmon--I would say that the salmon was pretty good, though the bread it came on (\"fitness bread\") tasted like it came straight from East Germany...in the 80s. I would probably pass on this if I had the opportunity to come back. \n\n2) Upon the recommendation of our waitress, I had the jager schnitzel (porkloin with THE MOST DELICIOUS PASTA and mushroom sauce). The sauce looked really heavy when the dish arrived, but the whole dish was extremely flavorful and I ended up eating far more of it than I would have expected. If I was rating solely on this dish and the service, I would have given this place 5 stars, easily. I would absolutely come back just to eat this again.\n\n3) Upon the recommendation of our waitress, my friend had the chicken stuffed with bacon, in cherry sauce. I had some, and I have to say this was really good, but not a show stopper like the jager schnitzel. The mashed potatoes were especially good, however.\n\n4) For dessert, we ordered the apple strudel. We devoured that as well, despite being totally full. There's something about the classic apple pie and vanilla ice cream combo that gets me every time. In this rendition, I really appreciated how the \"crust\" of strudel was thin and light and the apples weren't totally soggy.

It's a bit dark though and they have simple table decor. The atmosphere is intimate. There were only two waitresses but at least the turn around time was better than a previous dinner outing with my husband.\n\nFor our deal, we got one appetizer, two entrees and one dessert.

My friend got the herring in sour cream with apples, onions, pickles, served with pumpernickel bread. Both we interesting dishes.\n\nFor entrees, we each had different dishes but I think it would have been better if the couples shared the food. The entrees were big so I had to eat half in order to make room for dessert. I had the garlic roast pork with vegetables and potatoes.

It was similar to a Guiness with smokey coffee notes and slight bitterness but waaaay more flavorful and more effervescent and crisp than a Guiness. So great. We ordered the stuffed chicken breast and the schnitzel and asked for spaetzle instead of mashed potatoes on one of the plates. Both plates also came with a side of mixed veggies. Everything was outstanding. The schnitzel is light and crispy tender, the spaetzle was so flavorful, I wish I knew how they prepare it. The mashed potatoes were decadent and smooth. The chicken was moist and flavorful in itself but filled with bacon and dried cherries and onions and covered in this delicious, slightly sweet and creamy sauce.

We arrived at 9:15, had drinks in our hand by 9:45, then a table by 10, which is, according to Yelp, closing time for them. Despite that, the restaurant was extremely busy, people were still enjoying each others company and hardly any bills were given (which explains why it took us so long to find a darn table). So this place, understandably, is quite the Popular Patty! \n\nMy God, make reservations. Don't do what we did and think, \"Oh, it'll have died down by 9 on a Friday night.\" BZZZ. WRONG. FAIL. END OF THE LINE FOR YOU, MISS. We stood there like assholes for the majority of the time we were there because everyone else (probably) called in ahead.\n\nMy boyfriend drank the Franziskaner Hefeweizen ($6) all night, and I the infamous Diesel ($4) - a funky concoction of beer and Coke. The only beer I really drink is during Oktoberfest, so take my opinion with a grain of salt but.. the Diesel was ridiculously good. I mean, it's effing hilarious how my mind was blown taking that first sip. Try the Diesel. \n\nEventually we got our food. It did not disappoint. The boyfriend ordered the Bratwurst ($15) and I tried the fish special they had going on ($19). Was it worth the wait? Heck yes. By 10 PM, we were ravenous and heavy German food is just the answer. We both got mashed potatoes, which were so good. It was just the right amount of creamy and soft. His bratwurst, I'm told, was delicious as well as the sauerkraut that came with it. Mine, the fish, was super good too! It was a perfect combination of crispy and tender at all the right places. Might have been a tad too salty but the lemon sauce that was drizzled all over it and the green bean vegetables were soo good. If you're reading this review while they still have that fish special (that I cannot spell/pronounce or even fathom to attempt), please try it.\n\nThe building itself is tiny. Sooo small. I wish it were bigger. But it's pretty awesomely decorated with a picture of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and some guy who looks like Rutherford B. Hayes. (Who is he!) ETA: I am told he is Freddy Engels, Karl's buddy.\n\nThere were only two waitresses at the time we were there. Both were extremely friendly and helpful. One took pity on us lowly newbies and offered to serve us drinks. (THANK YOU.) Later, the other asked a couple patrons if they would give up their table for us while they sat in the couch. (DOUBLE THANKS.) They were super kind, super generous. I feel like an ass coming back to the restaurant to question my itemized bill, when everything was actually on the straight and narrow. \n\nThis review is getting almost TL;DR so I'll stop now. Walzwerk is awesome. This is going to be my new favorite German restaurant that I'll use and abuse every time I'm in SF.

My butcher pointed out that this place is specifically an East German restaurant, and the stuff that I was used to eating was going to be slightly different here. Indeed it was.\n\nThe decor is eclectic with cool East German referential art. We were sat in the front room near the bar without hesitation. I got the trip tip roulade with bacon and  pickles, with red cabbage. They happily substituted the cheese spaetzle special from another dish for me from the normal spaetzle. So awesome. Cabbage has a bit of clove in it and nice sweetness. The roulade was super tasty and had a nice sauce to round everything out.

With apple sauce and sour cream on the side, it was almost like having my Bubbe's** cooking. \n\nI was about to order the bratwurst, but changed my mind at the last minute and ordered the meat special of the day: a pork and beef meatloaf.

It fills up quickly, so making a reservation might be a smart idea.

Perfectly grilled, rich and moist, with a rich, creamy and tangy (from lemon) caper sauce. The boiled potatoes were fully cooked, but with a firm texture (might be a German variety). The asparagus were just right.\n\nI also like their Schnitzel ($15), better than Schroeder's version. They have a vegetarian \"Schnitzel\", but we've not tried that yet. In general, the food is rich and portions are generous, so expect to feel satisfied with fewer dishes. It's comfort food, don't expect a fancy plate presentation.\n\nBeverages available include: Radeberger Pilsner (popular), Hefeweizen, Weltenburg Amber & Helles.

Forget about the hefeweizen, I handled about 1/8 of it before my friend finished it off for me. \n\nWe bypassed dessert, since I felt like I had just consumed a gut bomb......I would be able to retreat in hibernation, and emerge hungry a month later.\n\nService is prompt, but rather lacking in creating a friendly ambiance, but we were not expecting that anyways (friends have been to Germany, so they've warned me beforehand) and the food was thick, heavy, robust, and uninventive.  But I'm not disappointed.

Personally I didn't start expanding my palette until recently so when I lived in Germany, I can count on one hand the number of times I had a schntizel or any other authentic German food. I was the kind of person who was excited when we finally found a McDonalds. But that's besides the point.\n\nFirst overall impression: this place is SMALL. Went there early on a Thursday evening at 6PM so we didn't have to wait at all but I can see this place getting packed really quickly on the weekends.\n\nThe atmosphere is quaint and very...East German-like for lack of a better adjective. It made the whole experience very authentic so I didn't mind.  It was pretty quiet in there and every time I laughed, I felt everyone's eyes on me.\n\nThe food.  OMG the food.  It was AWESOME.  So awesome that I want to go back in time and slap my 16-year-old self for never taking advantage of the German food that was right in front of me for years.  We had the following:\n\nBeer: Roomie had the Radeberger Pilsner and I had the Franziskaner Hefeweizen. My hef was hoppier than regular hef but it was good and tasty.  \n\nPotato pancakes: it was like a hashbrown on steroids but sooo good.  Didn't really like it with the apple sauce since it was cold but I did like it by itself.  I't was crispy on the outside and super hot and fluffy on the inside.  \n\nSchnitzel (Breaded Porkloin) with Mashed Potatoes & Seasonal Vegetables: This was my entree and it was very good.  Squeezed the whole lemon wedge on it for that extra zing and it enhanced the taste tremendously.\n\nJ\u00e4ger Schnitzel (Porkloin) with Sp\u00e4tzle and Creamy Mushrooom Sauce: This was my roomie's entree.  Good thing I waited until I was halfway through my own schnitzel before having a bite of her's. The creamy mushroom sauce was PERFECT with the pork.  It was sooooo good.  We ended up trading halfway through our entrees because I loved the sauce so much and she could swish the breaded porkloin with the sauce that came with the spatzle.\n\nHow I know that the food was GREAT: I ate it all (with some mashed potatoes left over) and I didn't notice that we didn't get water because I didn't need it to wash anything down.\n\nEven if its a bit more expensive than what I personally prefer, I would come back here if the occasion fit.  Or if I find another deal online.   Ended up paying a total of $40 out of pocket.  THANK YOU TRUBATES FOR THE $20 FOR $40 WORTH OF FOOD/DRINKS DEAL :)\n\nRandom other notes: street parking isn't bad on that side of the Mission.

The Spatzle (pasta) was excellent and the red cabbage lent a healthy side to the otherwise meaty dish)\n\nBecause of the long wait, we got some breaded appetizer and red berry pudding dessert on house!

The gooseberries, meh, a bit funky, but personally I don't like them very much to begin with. The cake more than made up for it. It's not too sweet, just hit the right spot, like how European sweets are supposed to be, and it's served with a *non-sweetened* whipped cream! Nice! If you have the American kind of sweet tooth (i.e. you like loads of sugar), the desserts here might not be for you.\n\nOf course, they have German beer there, and they serve it by the half litre like they do in Europe :)\n\nThis is definitely a gem in a otherwise sketchy neighbourhood.", "author": "Alice C."}

My friend and I went there (he was originally from Hamburg) and I was expecting to be fed heaping portions of glutonous-pork/potato-based hauptgang and washed down with some Dresden Radeberger Pilsner. My expectations were correct, but it was flavorful-- but bring a sleeping bag to have a nap in after such a big meal. \n\nI started with the small tasty potato pancakes because I was hungry. Wrong move with the Raderberger, because now I'm starting to get filled. After more Pilsners and I decided to stay with generic-German food by ordering Sauerbraten with potato dumplings and braised red cabbage. If you're a vegan, go home. This marinated beef was spicier than what I expected from Erich Hanocker's Deutsche Demokratische Republik, or GDR or East Germany. Potato dumpling and red cabbage squirted their juices well (with flavorful combination) in my mouth. I'm not versed enough to compare tasty squirts of this Sauerbraten against say, the Rhineland or Swabbian versions, but who cares? Hefeweizen bitte!! \n\nOh yeah, did I mention GDR? Yes, the place does look like a stoic cafeteria fit for your finest people's machinists. I have to admit that after a few rounds of Hefeweizen, Wallenburg and more Radeberger, the wall portraits of Marx, Engles and other protectors of workers' paradise started to talk to this capitalist.

We ordered two huge, creamy Franziskaner hefs (my current favorite beer) and a meat and cheese plate to start off, which was super good and hearty. The rye bread, cold cuts and cheese I loved. Then we shared a giant plate of the chicken breast stuffed with apples and bacon, sundried cherry sauce, mashed potatoes and veggies. The chicken was luscious and not overpowered by the bacon. The apples and sundried cherries added the perfect combination of tartness and sweetness, while the mashed potatoes, absorbing all the chicken and cherry juices made a nice bed for the rest of the food and beer in my belly. \n\nWe walked all the way back to my house on 30th and Mission to digest but couldn't help but feel like all that comfort food kept me warm on the way home.

Everything from the small flower vases to the plastic butter dishes and even the bathroom soap dispenser (Florena!) was so authentic and real I thought I would cry. To me it was clear that every single item of Walzwerk's interior decoration had been consciously and lovingly placed to replicate eastern Germany's ongoing reminiscence of those pre-unification days of the DDR, and to proudly display the region's renowned honest and no-nonsense work ethic.\n\nAnd the food! Everything was just as delicious, hearty and filling as I remembered. My host mother's clucking and second (and often fourth) servings of her wunderbar old fashioned home cooked meals made me gain upwards of 10 pounds in my first month in Saxony alone (ach du Scheisse!), and by the way I was salivating over Walzwerk's simple menu I thought it might be possible to beat that record in one night.\n\nI went to Walzwerk with my family, who is not well versed in the cuisine of this area and consequently found some of the listed dishes a bit odd. Kloesse (boiled dumplings made of shredded potatoes), for example, are a favorite of mine because they bring back memories of my Erzgebergische Weihnachten (traditional Erzgeberg Christmas).

Interesting way to serve potatoes. Taste: eh, ok. Next time I'll try  the mashed potatoes. \n\n  My friend had the bratwurst and said it was good : only one bratwurst is served. If you are a big eater, you might ask for two. It also came with mashed potatos. The quality of the food is 4 stars, however, the cheap tables are too faux E. Germany.\nDinner for two was $38 , it's kinda spendy for what you get. \n\n  Decor: low rent, blah;  cool minimalist music, low key place; not rowdy like the other German/Austrian place on 9th/Folsom.\n\n Location: sketchy during the day.

I was told this is one of their best dishes. It was good, but after it arrived (and my first few tastes...maybe it needed a dash of salt or pepper) I was secretly looking over at the schnitzel. Of course, I tasted that as well....which was fine as well. Hope you can sense my ambivalence... \n\nFor me, I would come back, but you are going to see me visiting their sister restaurant, Schmidt's more often...its at 20th and Folsom (little nicer part of town) and a little more upscale...which is perfect for a snob like me - and I have always had a great time there.", "author": "Jason P."}

The food was decent enough. And for somebody who grew up in Germany and knows that in comparison to the US, most restaurants in Germany really lack any service attitude, I thought it is actually not possible for me to write a bad review about a restaurant, only based on the bad service. That was, until I visited this place with friends. The waitresses were rude to a point I was seriously embarrassed in front of my American friends and was trying to defuse the situation with jokes. Some friends didn't even dare to order another beer as they feared they would just be sneered at. \n\nThe highlight of the evening was that two people came 30 minutes later to our dinner. We were a party of 5 before, were all in the middle of the dinner and one of us left, so basically they would just have had to accomodate one person more. When they arrived the waitresses seemed upset insisting that \"you cannot add more and more people to the dinner as the evening goes on\". After I assured here that this was the only change of the evening, the two new arrivals tried to order food, only to be told \"no you cannot order something, since we now need your table\".

Instead, you might feel like you've time warped back to East Germany as you walk into a comparatively-quiet, dimly lit, small space with era and culture appropriate historical art, trinkets, and decorations. \n\nThe restaurant is small - maybe 6 tables out front and three in the back with a long narrow hallway connecting the front and back.  Next to the hallway, there's a mini seating area where you can wait for a table and also their tiny bar which I think had two stools.  Like Suppenkuche and Leopolds, Walzwerk also does communal seating.\n\nFood: \n1) House salad - uses butter lettuce and a vinegar dressing = soo good and perfect size for two to share as an appetizer\n2) Bratwurst - There were heaping mounds of creamy, buttery mashed potatoes and a lot of really good sauerkraut, but it comes with only one sausage.  It wasn't proportional and the quantity wasn't worth the price.  I feel like you need at least two sausages if it's going to be served as an entree.  That said, it tasted good - so I guess if the price doesn't bother you and one bratwurst is enough for you, then this dish could be great.\n3) Beef roulade - it was good to try once especially if you're down for something heavy.  The beef is stuffed with bacon, pickles, onions, and mustard; it comes with red cabbage and spaetzle.  \n4) For dessert we shared the strawberry raspberry pudding - really disappointing. It's frozen berries with some sort of vanilla sauce on top  - not impressive. \n\nIf you want German food and a mellow evening, this place could be better than Leopolds and Suppenkuche.  It provides a more intimate space than the other two and the decor/atmosphere make you feel like you are eating out of an East Berlin kitchen.  But for me, Walzwerk's food does not compare to it's competitors.  If I'm in the area and the mood is right, maybe I'll give it another shot - but I can't see myself returning in the near future.", "author": "Kimya P."}

It's quite small inside but they may have an extra dining area in the back (not sure). The decor is somewhat minimal but quaint. \nThe food was excellent and definitely one of those places where you can go for comfort food. Friendly service and a menu that is quite diverse. So if you like meat, they've got a chicken dish (excellent) and pork dish (comfort food indeed). But if you're looking for something more vegetarian, they also have that for your own choosing.\n\nNow, when it comes to wine and beer. All you beer enthusiasts out there will definitely like this place because of their wide array of beer selection.\n\nAdditionally, parking wasn't that bad on a Saturday night despite having only street parking as an option. We found parking not too far from the restaurant.\n\nSo on a cold evening, if you're craving for some nice German comfort food. This is the place to go.", "author": "Chad B."}

After hearing the raves for so long I really thought it would be something special.\nMeh.\nIt wasn't. I got chicken --dry, though the sauce was good and pretty much saved the dish--and subbed in spaetzle, because I love spaetzle. This spaetzle tasted like it had been set on the back of the stove overnight. Rubbery, dessicated, and without seasoning. Isn't this a German restaurant? What's up with serving spaetzle not fit for prisoners?\n\nThen we asked for a recommendation for dessert. Our waiter, who was very eager to please and commodious, highly recommended the special: black forest cake. So we got it. Blech! It clearly had been frozen and defrosted, and not in a good way. It was dry and stale on the edges and wasn't worth the calories. \n\nBasically, I would've been embarrassed to serve food like this. It's probably a 2 star but because of the hype, we were especially disappointed and I'm downgrading.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

The halibut was good, but nothing super exciting.\n\nAnother person ordered the Schnitzel (Breaded Porkloin) with Mashed Potatoes & Seasonal Vegetables ($15) which I was a fan of because I like pork.

From the street (cold, windy, industrial, even a touch desolate), Walzwerk offers a glimpse through its windows of muted light, frothy amber beers and abundant plates.  Inside, the 6 or 7 tables were full so we sat at the tiny bar to wait with a brew, peruse the bilingual menu and take in the decor - mostly kitsch.  The European staff are casual and relaxed - sometimes a little inattentive, but very friendly and I was so charmed by the ambience I didn't mind waiting.  There is nothing pretentious or even hip about Walzwerk.  It didn't even feel much like San Francisco - and certainly not the Mission.\n\nThe food was solid, both in quality and in nature.  The potato pancakes were delicious, the beet soup a touch salty for my taste, the sauerbraten and schnitzel were both good.  The ice tea is rosehip, not black, and was very tasty.

He text messaged me in a craze about the authentically surly staff, the great food and huge portions, and the cool place it was in. Being that I was never one to deprive myself of being looked down upon by ornery Germans, I knew I had to go see for myself what it was all about. \n\nWalzwerk is all about East Germany, or the former East Germany, I guess. The menu offers very homey country-style German dishes that fall more on the side of comfort food than exotic, but that's totally great. Schnitzels, wursts and other delights of the German kind come out of their kitchen and it's all wonderful. I had the stuffed chicken breast which came out covered in this homestyle gravy with dried cherries on top, offered with wonderful fresh asparagus and mashed potatoes on the side. I should clarify that I did not actually live in East Germany, but I can safely say that this is as authentic as it gets in San Francisco. Another delight was that they have Franziskaner on draft, along with an impressive list of other beers. \n\nThe restaurant itself is outfitted in a very efficient, communist-type style with simple tables and chairs, plants with East German flags hanging out of them and some kitschy art on the walls. The wait staff is efficient, friendly, but short, and that seemed pretty authentic to me too (the waitress was neither impressed, nor concerned with my friend who tried to speak German with her). The prices are super reasonable and portions are enormous, so go with an appetite. This is a new discovery in San Francisco that I will look forward to returning to.", "author": "Justin S."}

Beet soup highlighted the naturally sweet taste of beets with a very light hand towards seasoning; unfussy, simple, refreshing, and delicious, it was the most enjoyable aspect of my meal that evening.  Vegetarian roulade was hearty, but not heavy - it featured sweet cabbage surrounding what looked like black lentils with a well-rounded tomato sauce accompanied by a mound of rich, creamy mashed potatoes (not so healthy).  Only mediocre aspect were the potato pancakes - they were a little thick and bland, could have been seared more.\n\nAs some others have mentioned, service is not the hallmark of this dining institution.

Me being German I was curious and had to check this place out, especially after reading the positive reviews. And I did not get  disappointed. \n\nI've been to quite few so-called German restaurants outside Germany and they usually serve horrible food that hasn't got anything to do with the real stuff, the focus tends to be on selling beer. Walzwerk is different. The Jaegerschnitzel was the best I'd had in a long time, very decent indeed. The sauce was excellent and a nice contrast to the usual 'out of a bucket sauce'. \n\nAnother, very pleasant, difference to your usual German place is the decor. While normally it's all about the Lederhosen and Bavarian theme Walzwerk is full of East German socialist memorabilia which gives it a slightly quirky and stylish touch...stark contrast to the usual Oooompapa ambiente.

Next time we'll plan on going early, which will then give us enough time to enjoy the food even more.", "author": "Mickey A."}

There are no kitten heels or cosmos in sight.  The decor is a delightful hodgepodge of all things German, from propoganda posters to kitchy accessories.  Tables are mix and match, just like the eclectic clientele who loyally keep the restaurant busy every night.\n\nFirst, start with one of their many delicious beers - my husband likes the Optimator, while I prefer the amber.  You can't go wrong with a Weisse beer on a summer day - I can't think of anything more refreshing.\n\nFor appetizers, the potato pancakes are wonderful - thick and hearty, with sour cream and applesauce on the side.  Big enough to share, if you're feeling generous.  \n\nThe house-cured salmon is also lovely, with triangles of brown bread and a big bowl of beets on the side.\n\nThe soljanka soup is a real treat - a mix of pickled vegetables in a nice broth with bits of sausage thrown in - warms you up instantly and has a sour/savory flavor that is unique and very tasty.\n\nFor dinner, be sure to check the specials menu, because you can't go wrong with one of the fresh fish or pork selections.\n\nFavorites from the regular menu include:  Jaeger Schnitzel with Creamy Mushroom Sauce, Sauerbraten (Marinated Beef), Breast of Chicken stuffed with Apples & Bacon, Roast Pork.    If sausages are your thing, of course there is a great selection of those as well.\n\n**Vegetarians please note:  the Vegitarian Schnitzel is really good - a must-try!**\n\nDesserts:  Love the Cold Dog - layers and layers of cake & chocolate - almost a cross between a cake & a cookie, and the Apple Strudel is very good, too.  Again, there are usually specials such as cheesecake and chocolate pudding - all excellent.\n\nEven if you don't think you like German food, give Walzwerk a try.  In its very straightforward approach to both its service and its cuisine, it is sure to charm you.", "author": "Liz S."}

Walzwerk is your place. \n\nDining here was a milestone in my history of dining out for these reasons: \n1. I have never been so full after a meal, and\n2. They serve the best mashed potatoes I have ever tasted.\n\nThe food is hearty and heavy and surprisingly vegetarian-friendly. The vegetables in my vegetarian schnitzel were a little tough, but they were bathed in a creamy, delicious pea sauce and accompanied by the anything-but-dull mashed potatoes. They were complex, with hints of lemon and butter and garlic and some kind of sweetness. Add a melt-in-your-mouth consistency and there you have it---potato perfection. \n\nThe decor is folksy East German kitchen, which fits, because the place is barely bigger than a kitchen.  The Massive Attack album that played throughout dinner? Didn't fit so much. The service was efficient but not overly friendly. Great selection of beer served in big steins (mine was chipped, but I guess it made it seem more like someone's mom's kitchen.)\n\nA hidden benefit of eating here?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-03-09", "description": "Came here last Friday for dinner with a couple of my college pals.  We were looking for a warm, cozy place with good, filling food and drinks (a la Suppenkuche, but with better parking options) to do a little catch up session.  Walzwerk partly delivered, but in other aspects, we were a bit disappointed.  \n\nLet's start with the environs.  Not as cute and cozy as Suppenkuche (I love the little back room/nook area at Suppenkuche!), but not terrible either.  This is a East German restaurant, and given the rather non-descript block on S. Van Ness where it's located, the slightly industrial decor fit in quite nicely, actually.  3 stars.\n\nNext, the food.  We shared the matjes herring appetizer (pickled herring in sour cream w/ apples, onions, pickles, and served w/ pumpernickel bread) - very good and tasted surprisingly un-fishy.  The garlic roast pork w/ potatoes & vegetables entree - also quite tasty.  4 stars.\n\nThe BEST thing about this place is the beer.  For those who like a medium-bodied beer, get the Kostritzer Schwarzbier.  It looks heavy like a stout, but tastes like an amber.  The Franziskaner Hefeweizen is a good choice, too, if you're looking for something refreshing.  4 stars.\n\nThe WORST thing about this place is the service.  I realize it was a Friday night and they have limited seating.  However, please try not to make it too-too obvious that you're trying to kick us out.  Restaurants hoping to have returning clients let their clients take their time eating, even when there are other people waiting for a table.  Stopping by every 15 mins to ask to clear our plates is annoying, but not exceedingly rude.  Stopping by to say: \"You're welcome to stay if you order dessert, otherwise I'm going to have to kick you out\" is discourteous and highly offensive.  Following up with: \"I know I'll get a bad tip, but I don't care\" just adds further insult.  1 star.\n\nAverage total for Walzwerk: 3 stars", "author": "Annie W."}

Even so, we could only get one for 8:00, so I was mighty hungry already, and while we were seated fairly quickly, I think there was a mix-up because they didn't take our order for like 20 minutes.  Or maybe the kitchen was backed up?  Even so, they should have taken our drink orders, that at least would have helped me from going into a low-blood-sugar coma.\n\nBut all was forgiven when the food finally came.  This is comfort cuisine of the highest order, and is quite reminiscent of classic Americana dishes.  Like spaetzle, probably the best incarnation ever of mac & cheese.  Or the mushroom-gravy goodness of the jager schnitzel.  Or the stuffed chicken with cherries and the most mouth-watering mashed potatoes.\n\nEqually mind-blowing are the drinks.  I tried the Diesel (half beer half coke), and, considering it sounds like it'd be gross, it's amazingly good.  I think I'll have to start offering it at cocktail parties.  Unfortunately, the slow service didn't leave us with time for dessert, which is too bad because I was really curious about the \"cold dog\".\n\nSo Walwerk may not be the most convenient place to eat in town, but with German your options are pretty limited, and the food here is easily worth it.  And at least it's easier to get a table here than at Suppenkuche (where you need 6 to get a reservation and multi-hour waits are the norm on weekends).", "author": "Wes M."}

My sister and her family have since moved far away and I don't get to come over to their German meals anymore, so this made me think of them.\n\nI ordered the jager schnitzel.  The boyfriend ordered the sauerbraten.  The BIL has made both dishes multiple times, in fact every Christmas we have sauerbraten as our Christmas meal.  That's right every year for the past 11 years for Christmas my Viet family would gather around a table and eat sauerbraten.  Anyhow, our dishes came out and mine was fantastic, but there wasn't that much.  I gobbled that thing up quickly.  I rarely finish my meal.  I'm also never the first person to finish my meal.  I not only finished my meal first but I ate it all.  There's something off here.  The saurebraten didn't really taste like the BIL (or his mom's, who came over from Germany one year for Xmas and cooked it for us).  It was a bit more tomatoey than what I'm used to.  I'm not sure what's \"more authentic\" but since both the BIL has the thickest German accent that after 11 years I still sometimes have trouble understanding him, and his mother who still lives in Germany's didn't quite taste like this I'm going to go with them.  That's fine though, it was still fine tasting, although the dish could have used more kartoffelkloesse (potato dumplings, see, I know what I'm talking about here!)  They only gave the boyfriend 2, which is definitely not enough starch for this beef dish.\n\nWhile the food was pretty good (although again, portions were woefully small) what makes me not want to come back here was the service.

Before I went there, the only German restaurant I had been to was Suppenkuche and no doubt it was good but expensive...but after having dined at Walzwerk...I'm now an official Walzwerk fan!\n\nMy experience was all positive! Not too long of a wait (unlike Suppenkuche) got seated in about 10-15 minutes on a Friday night without reservation...totally cool!\n\nWhen my buddy and I got seated...we got the best seat in the house...sitting at the bar, eating, drinking and watching all the behind the scene waitstaff action and conversation which provided us with hours of fun and delight.\n\nBack to the food...AMAZING! I'm always a sucker for grilled pork chops and that was on the today's specials menu and naturally I ordered it. The pork chops were cooked to perfection...tender, juicy, and packed with wonderful flavors topped with some homemade apple-cherry (I think) sauce. The dish also came with steamed green beans and potatoes. Every bite I took was just orgasmic...I think I may have freaked my buddy out a little when I made those oohs and aahs noises while I was enjoying my food. \n\nOh before the main course, we ordered an appetizer and some delicious beer. We had the Herring in Sour Cream with all the goodies and served with Pumpernickel Bread. We didn't know what to expect as neither of us had it before but WOW...it was GOOD! Creamy and yummy!\n\nAs far as the beer is concerned...I am usually a lightweight but as the saying goes...when in Rome do as the Romans do...similarly when in a German restaurant do as the Germans do...I ordered myself a beer...a tall glass of Radeberger Pilsner. It was almost as tall as my torso and it was 0.5 liter. Low and behold, this lightweight (i.e. me) downed it completely...though it took me a couple of hours to do so.\n\nLast but not least, the service was excellent! The waitstaff was attentive, friendly and fun!

Yelpers seem to like the jager schnitzel and the chicken breast, so we got those. I see on the menu that the schnitzel is supposed to come with a mushroom sauce, but there wasn't any, which struck us as odd at the time because it was a very dry meal (there were mashed potatoes on the side, also sauceless, still delicious but evidently they could have been more delicious). It tasted fine, but I'm taking off a star for this pretty egregious omission. I loved the chicken though, which did come with sauce.\n\nFinished off the meal with the red berry pudding, which struck the right balance between fruit-ily tart and sweet.

Breaded, seasoned, crispy, delicious. But wait, it gets better...paired with a mushroom cream sauce and SPAEZTLE. Little dumplings of fluffy joy. And the best part? Some of the spaeztle had been fried in butter prior to being added to the cream sauce. So they were crispy fluffy joy buttons. Yes, it's a heart attack waiting to happen.

Plus, when again in my lifetime am I going to get to fully enjoy the delights of this kind of food? don't hate. \n\nMike gets the sauerbraten-of which all is quite good, but i cannot stop taking little nibbles of his sweet braised cabbage-which seems to have cinnamon spice and possibly apples or onions added to it.

The collection of glasses in which the drinks came alone was worth getting a round. The German sparkling wine was nice.\n\nWe ordered some appies and they were fantastic. She even gave us some extra since there were so many of us. The salmon was delish.\n\nOn to the main course. The main thing that stood out to me, and what I was also told by my aunt, were the portions. You get a lot of food - something that I find is sometimes hard to find for \"cool\" mission restaurants in this price range. The food was great, too. I haven't had much German food, but I was pleased - and so was everyone else. And the vegetarian schnitzel won over my veggie friend.\n\nDinner was done, more drinks, and lots of conversation later, the waitress then brought out a special birthday surprise. The German equivalent of apple pie a la mode with a lovely little candle. It was dandy! I loved it also because the same woman called me the \"queen\" earlier when I decided that \"I should stick with the bubbly\" out-loud.\n\nAnyway, I also appreciated that there was no rush to get us out the door. We were the last ones out but never felt hurried or unwelcome. While the place may be fashioned after East Germany, it had a definite euro-trash feel. Any restaurant that allows you to enjoy food and the company of your friends is a-OK in my book. And if the food's good and the beer and wine selection decent, even better!", "author": "Greg Z."}

Walzwerk screwed up my boyfriend's birthday reservation, blamed me for it,  and promised to call back to see what they can do but never did, forcing our party of 8 to make last-minute changes to our birthday plans on a Saturday night!  \n\nHere's the story: A week before my boyfriend's birthday, I left a message with Walzwerk to reserve a table of 8 for 7:30 pm on a Saturday.  The next day, \"Hilda\" (Hilga?) of Walzwerk called me back, leaving me a voicemail, to confirm with the same exact details.  I saved the voicemail.\n\nAt 6:35 pm of the Saturday night of my boyfriend's birthday dinner at Walzwerk, an irate female employee (sounded like Hilda/Hilga), said, \"[My name], why aren't you here?\"  She claimed that we were supposed to be there at 6 pm.  Given the voicemail confirmation, the mix-up was clearly on their end, which she refused to acknowledge.  Instead, she said, \"Well, what do you expect me to do?  I can't hold it!\"  I asked, \"What do you expect me to do... it's a birthday party in less than an hour!\"  Said she would call me back to see what she could do.  And, did she?  No, of course not!\n\nI get it.  Mix-ups happen, but to not admit to your mistakes and shift the blame, with or without the attitude she gave me, is simply insulting, disrespectful and unethical. And, then to not call me back after \"seeing what she could do,\" just doubles the lie.  Suppenkuche was more than happy to accommodate us despite of a busy Saturday night for them.

Not exactly my cup of tea, but well done. Mine had salami and some other toppings on it, but there was a vegetarian one as well.\n\nI ordered the dumplings with Schnitzel. The dumplings were quite tasty, and the sauerkraut was also pretty tasty. The schnitzel was very good. As I mentioned before, it was foreign to my taste buds, but I can recognize the inherent quality of the food.

I ordered the stuffed chicken entree and a non alcoholic maltz beverage called Kaiserdom( I was curious about this drink but after 2 sips,I realized that I didn't like it).  We were served our beverages first and it took awhile for the food to arrive because the place was busy. The waitresses were very kind and apologetic about the wait.  One of the waitresses even noticed that I didn't drink my beverage and asked me if I liked it or not.  I was honest and told her that I really found the drink to be way to sweet for my taste and I didn't care for the flavor either. She also admitted that she did not like it and offered to replace it with another drink. I thought that was very nice of her but I declined and said that I would stick with the water. Eventually, the food arrived and everything was delicious.\nI had even ordered an entree to go for my husband and this is where they lose the 2 other stars....\nI had requested the pork schnitzel entree as a \"to go\" item when we ordered our entrees and it was given to us at the same time our food had arrived.  Since the schnitzel was all boxed up and wrapped, I didn't even give it a second thought to look at the product since the food on our plates looked great.  Well, when i arrived home and opened up the box, I was very surprised and disappointed to see that they had \"overcooked\" the schnitzel because the breading looked very charred! My husband was surprised that they would even serve something that looked like it had been burnt.  I felt so bad that I offered to remove the breading and salvage the meat and put it in a sandwich but he was already hungry and tried to eat some of the schnitzel .  The mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables were fine but the cook probably was too busy to pay attention to frying the pork schnitzel.

The restaurant itself is basically a bottom floor, SF flat. We were there on one of those rare, warm SF days. Definitely ask for the back room on days like that; it's cooler and you get to look out on the backyard instead of S. Van Ness. \nThe food is rich, hearty, and you get plenty of it. I think I was able to finish less than half of my entree of bacon, onion, mustard, and pickle, stuffed tri tip, spatzle, and braised cabbage. I boxed it up and it kept perfectly. My date got the fish special with mashed potatoes and he literally licked the plate clean. \nWhile the food was good, my favorite part was the music. They were playing old skool MJ, and Miss Janet, some George Michael, and Queen. It added this quirky, fun ambiance to the place. Mind you, this is an authentically German joint. So the Germans who are waiting on you will be \"very German,\" as my companion mentioned when the waiter didn't want to engage him in banter. They are frank, curt, and efficient, but also courteous and prompt. They were kind and replaced my sparkling wine without any eye rolling when I said it was flat. And they didn't bat an eye when we started dancing in the back room. I mean, we were slow dancing to George Michael, because we're nerds.

This moment of clarity arrived in the middle of dinner at Walzwerk. Previously, I had thought that it was a particularly localized affliction, a North Beach thing. I am horribly mistaken.\n\nI like German food, my father loves German food. So the old man was in town and I took him here for dinner. The imported waitress who looked old enough to know better, spent most of her time ignoring the customers, the service bell and anything except for some schmoe at the bar with whom she would make out with like a highschooler on a prom date - in full view of the front of the house. WtF? Getting a beverage, butter for the bread, water, the FOOD that's sitting in the order window, I might as well have done it myself, fer chrissakes. Not to mention when I finally got my entree, it was not what I ordered and much discussion ensued before I got my correct order fired. That said, I should mention another waitress came on duty as we were finishing dinner and took over our table and was very friendly. I hope she's working when I go back.\n\n  The food was hit and miss. The soljanka soup was absolutely delicious and is quite possibly the one thing that will bring me back. The beef roulade was tougher than leather, bone dry and completely flavorless (not to mention ice cold in the middle), though the spatzel and red cabbage that accompanied it were very good. I tried a bit of the bratwurst and mashed potatoes and both were outstanding. I make some mean mashed potatoes myself so I never get excited about eating them in restaurants, but these were really good.\n\n  The portions are ginormous and I'm certainly not one of those waifish metro types, but I couldn't come close to knocking out my plate.\n\n  Overall, I'll give it another shot. It seems to be one of those places where you have to know what's good. If you get the right things, you'll have a great meal, if you get a clunker, you get stuck in a big way.

I have eaten schnitzel for every meal in Berlin, Budapest, and Vienna, and also at Schnitzelhaus and Suppenkuche here in the city, so I know what I'm talking about.  While it was good, it was not as good as the one at Schnitzelhaus (/whine).  Also, you have to make a choice between spaetzle and rottkraut, which I think is total BS.  You're already paying a high premium for this food, the least they could do is give you a little cheap pasta or cabbage for free.\n\nI felt the beer list was lacking.  For this area, it should not be difficult whatsoever to expand their beer list drastically.  They could even buy it directly from City Beer Store a few blocks away on Folsom.\n\nGreat food, but I felt it was too expensive and not enough.  I was hoping this place would fill the hole that Schnitzelhaus left behind, but it doesn't quite cut it.  Schnitzelhaus was tiny and expensive like this place, except their beer list was tremendous and the food and helpings were much better.  Also, the staff was much friendlier and the owner would regularly engage you in conversation and drink a beer with you.\n\nIf you want German food and you're in this area, Walzwerk won't let you down, but be prepared to spend a lot.

I wouldn't feel great walking home alone from there late at night. No star.\n\nAmbience: cheerful, authentic, not fancy but not shabby. A little loud towards the end of the evening -- probably not a great date venue, but then, sausages and beer aren't exactly ideal date food either. 1 star.\n\nFood: hearty, high-quality, and tasty as all get out. It's big on meat and potatoes, but done exceptionally well. I advise skipping lunch, because portions are big. 1 star.\n\nPrices: you get good food, and lots of it, and great beer, and lots of that, and then the bill comes and you're like: \"oh, well, that's more than I was expecting, but that was totally worth it\". 1 star.\n\nService: fast, friendly and polite. We went in a big group and spent a lot of time on our meal, and towards the end the waiter very politely said that another table had been waiting for 35 minutes, so could we possibly give up our table?

Since it has been ably reviewed by at least 224 Yelpers before me, I'll just add a lesson in contemporary German pop-culture:\n\nThe restaurant's East German theme constitutes a fine example of 'Ostalgie' -- a German word that conveys a certain affection for the old East Germany ... not to mention a certain 'forgetting' of how bad things in the communist DDR really were. The word comes from a combination of the German words for 'East' (Ost) and 'Nostalgia' (Nostalgie). Other examples of this phenomenon are the film \"Goodbye Lenin!\" (along with the lesser known, but arguably better \"Sonnenallee\"), renewed interest in the Trabant (or 'Trabi', a VERY cheap, 2-cylinder car created by the regime), as well as a veritable love affair with the Ampelmaennchen, which I can't really describe but you can probably find a picture of them if you google it. \n\nOh, and the Weltenburg beer (I had the Helles ('light')) was REALLY good!", "author": "Ethan H."}

Lou had a tasty bratwurst with mashed potatos that were absolutely rich.  I had marinated beef with potato dumpling and red cabbage...the beef was tender and melty, and the potato dumpling was spiced and flavorful.   We also had a yummy yummy \"cold dog\" (i'm picky with desserts)- it's a layer cake dessert.  It kind of had a tiramisu taste and it was laying on a bed of light cream/berry sauce.\"\n\n\nAlso just to add -- I loved the interior.  It had a German/Eastern Europe feeling.  The servers, decor, ambiance made you very much feel in a  peaceful home.  The posters and art were culturally enticing; in the restroom, the wall was lined with old German record covers.

Before now I had eaten German food at Suppenkuche (wasn't impressed), Pfeifer House (in Tahoe City) and a place in Oakland (can't remember name), but I was never all that thrilled about the food. Walzwerk is the shit, man.\n\nI went with a couple of friends and had a great time drinking German beer and eating. To start we had the herring and potato pancakes. The potato pancakes (with sour cream and apple sauce) were really great and the herring (in dilled sour cream with green apples and brown bread) was also very good. For my entree I ordered a special on the menu, stuffed roasted pork roast with spaetzle and red cabbage (very yummy!!) My friends had the grilled bratwurst (with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes) and the jagerschnitzel (with spaetzle and mushroom gravy). All dishes were excellent and I would have been happy to eat any of them. I spied the entrees arriving to others in the dining room and they looked great too.\n\nThe only down-side was the desserts. I had read on Yelp that some people said to order the cold dog and the apple strudel. I thought the cold dog was boring and had a weird texture. The apple strudel was pretty good, but not my cup of tea. \n\nWe all drank at least 2 beers each. I fell in love with the first beer I tried, a lager called (I think) Weltenburger Helles. A very satisfying beer on all levels. It was recommended by one of the waitresses.\n\nI loved sitting in the back room which was filled with utiliterian furniture and had the vibe of a labor meeting hall. Very cold formica covered tables, etc, but with a sense of humor. \n\nThe service was fine, and we were eventually brought some kind of after dinner herbal drink in tiny bottles (45% alcohol!) that were carried in a wooden truck. That stuff tasted like medicine and one would have to develop a taste for it. Pretty gross if you ask me.\n\nI am definitely going back to eat at Walzwerk. Dunka.", "author": "Yvette K."}

I used to live in Germany so I have a fairly decent basis for comparison - I went with the Schnitzel with mashed potatos and veggies and a fat stein o' beir...

For $14 an entree, it was right at the high end of what I was willing to pay for it, but the portion made up for the price, and the quality was good (although not excellent). The schnitzel itself was slightly on the thin side and breading a tad undercooked, but overall it was still worth it. \n\nDecor is ultra simple: momentos from East Germany now long past. Don't trip on the portraits of Marx, Engels and Lenin in the front dining room - nobody's trying to convert you.

Our cousin-in-law is a transplant from Germany (with the obvious German accent) and he made reservations for our party of 6.  According to my cousin, the food is very authentic East German -- like something Axel's grandma would make when they went to her house for dinner -- from the cooking to the mismatched dinnerware to the old-school china that after dinner coffee was served in!\n\nWe started with potato pancakes and herring as our appetizers.  Entrees ordered were Salmon in caper sauce, Bratwurst, Jager Schnitzel (mushroom cream sauce) and Chicken Cordon Bleu (apparently commonly served in Germany.)  \n\nFor dessert we all had the apple streudel.  Perfectly diced apples with a sprinkling of raisins and spices wrapped in a thin pastry with a light coat of powdered sugar.  Yummy.\n\nThe decor was something out of East Germany, although I have never been there.  Maybe I have visions of what it would be like based on some Pink Floyd videos.  The dining tables were old, heavy steel desks that looked older than the ones I recall seeing in grade school in the late 70's.  Ditto for the chairs.  \n\nMusic: They played some kind of 80s techno (at a reasonable volume).  \n\nGood food, reasonable prices.  Our dinner for 4 (4 adults and 2 kids) came out to $120 including tax and tip.", "author": "Spicy T."}

The salmon was flabby and super greasy...thumbs down for salmon.\n\nI had the Jaeger Shnitzel with creamy mushroom sauce and spatzle...OMG that is a gut buster!

However it may pain me to give this place a single star I think its important to air this grievance as its bugged me for several years now. \n\nI brought my mother and grandmothers here a few years ago along with my father. I had been here several times before and had wonderful experiences each and every single time. The herring salad kept bringing me back, that and the wonderful \"brot\". \n\nIt was a lovely afternoon and we had a delightful meal of dishes that we all knew in one form or another, as we're all byproducts of the soviet regime. My mother insisted on paying the bill (there's just no arguing with a text-book classic Russian Jewish mother) so I let her. As we walked out of the restaurant a tall blond waitress chased us out and asked my mother \"was there something wrong with the service?\" My mother was completely taken aback, she said, no, not at all. The waitress went on to say \"we live off our tips, yours was so small, we thought something was wrong.\" I went pale at this moment and I think my mother was just as pale if not sporting a more authentic countenance of death. She quickly dug into her purse and pulled out a twenty and handed it to the waitress just to end the uncomfortable scene. \n\nPerhaps my mother's arithmetic was off, maybe she did leave too little, maybe she felt that the food and service were substandard and as she was paying she has the right to tip to the level of the service. If you ever want someone to return you don't chase them out of the restaurant and demand a greater gratuity. \n\nWhatever the reason she left how much she left; we were a party of five and were not subject to the automatic x% for parties of 6/7 or more that are standard fare in restaurants. Whatever the case or the reason the waitress turned what was a fantastic day with our progenitors into something of a nightmare. For this reason I've never gone back and as such feel inclined to leave this single star in response to this woman ruining our afternoon and making my mother and grandmothers, to whom we had to translate the uncomfortable scene to, feel incredibly awkward. There really was no call for that, my mother is generally a good tipper, and whatever her reasons were to tip less than what this woman felt she deserved, were her own.

It really is one of those hole in the walls other than it having a little overhang out front.  The inside was small, but it was pretty crowded too.\n\nWe ordered some drinks and it came up we were celebrating a birthday when they carded us.  So, they brought the drinks with some little tiny bottles of something called \"Underberg.\"  It wasn't a drink, but an after-meal bitter that happens to be 44% alcohol by vol, lol.  They introduced us to this custom of toasting each other while looking them dead straight in the eyes and then downing it like a shot.  It tastes and smells like root beer along with a bunch of other spices.  It goes down smooth and not too bad of an aftertaste.  It made my girlfriend's ears feel warm.\n\nWe ordered the roast garlic pork, schnitzel (breaded porkloin), and the sauerbraten (marinated beef).  \n\nThe beef was the best in my opinion.  It was very tender like veal and the sauce tasted kind of like a wine reduction.  This dish also came with potato dumplings that were delicious and red cabbage, also good.\n\nI liked the breaded pork loin next.  It was what you would expect from a breaded pork loin, although more tender.  The garlic pork had a wonderful sauce but the pork was a tiny bit overcooked, but still great with the sauce.\n\nDesert was a terrific apple strudel and ice cream. The strudel has small, diced apples, raisins, and nuts, and is NOT filled with all that gooey junk from store bought strudels.\n\nService was excellent and authentically German (hard to understand accents sometimes).  And we definitely appreciated the birthday toast.  Food was great considering none of us knew what to expect from German food.   Perhaps a little pricey for the amount you get and somewhat out of the way.", "author": "Aaron F."}

I had a good time, but I'm not itching to go back.  \n\nThe pros:\nReservations for big groups - Whereas it's pretty tough to get a relatively last minute reservation for a group at Suppenkuche, this place could accommodate.\nParking - Super easy to park!  A rarity in this fine city of ours....\nThe name - It's just good fun to say Walzwerk in an overly accented German accent - \"Vahlzverk...Let's go to Vahlzverk!\" (Am I too easily amused?  Don't answer that!)\n\nOnly so-so:\nAmbiance:  I liked the decor - very old regime, but the space was pretty small and felt a little cramped.  People are drinking large amounts of beer and eating way too much sausage, i.e., everyone is here to have a good time, but the space didn't really allow for collective rabblerousing.\nFood:  I really enjoyed the potato pancakes and also had the stuffed chicken, which was actually quite good.  But the mashed potatoes definitely came out of a box, and the peas/carrots were definitely some frozen veggies.  Also, I didn't think their non-wurst options were as extensive (or maybe just as tasty) as Suppenkuche.\nService:  If you want water, you have to ask for it specifically (including refills).  But we did get an authentic German waitress for part of the time, so points for that!\n\nAgain, a good time was had by all!

They seated us in the back room then promptly forgot about us.  The Beau had to get up and grab menus for us (not from a waitress, just from a pile of menus at the bar).  The waitress came over 10 minutes later and actually said \"Oh I'm so sorry, I forgot you!\" but she had a charming German accent so we forgave her.\n2.  Someone came over to bring us silverware after we had ordered apps and I asked her for another round of beers for the table.  \"I'm NOT your waitress.  I'll get her to come over.\"  10 minutes later, still no waitress.  And no beer.\n3.  The same woman brought out our appetizers.  We ordered the beer/onion/cheese soup, and she didn't have spoons with her.  Not wanted to be abandoned for another 10 minutes while our soup got cold, I asked for spoons \"when you get a chance.\"  Her response?  \"I KNOW.  I only have TWO hands.\" \n4.  Still no beers.\n5.  The Beau gets his beer.  Still none for moi.  Not for another 5 minute or so.\n6.  The food was average, I'd give them 3 stars for the food alone.  \n7.  Not Our Waitress Woman seemed more like a waitress than our actual server.  She brought out all our food and handled the bill at the end of the meal.  The only thing she DIDN'T do was take our orders.  That kind of attitude is really unacceptable.  We just wanted some more booze, folks.  I would think Germans could understand that.\n\nPotato pancakes were too thick for us; we were all used to thinner ones.  But they did taste good.  \nSoup was nothing special.  \nThe Beau got the schnitzel and I got the jager schintzel.  Both were desperately under-seasoned.  The Vegetarian ordered the vegarian schnitzel and was really disappointed to find that they were really just deep-fried breaded vegetables.  They weren't even cooked all the way through - the potatoes were still crunchy.  Gross.\n\nSorry for the long review, but I'm still fuming.

When the waitress heard this, she berated us for making the reservation for so many people if not all would be on time and eating, and said she'd need to decrease the size of the table since she had customers waiting. Fine - point taken - but isn't there a nice way to say this? She literally made us feel like we were in fourth grade and being scolded by the teacher. Plus, after moving the tables around, she made a point to come back and say, \"Well, the party that was waiting just LEFT...\" Our fault? What part of that is our problem?

I have to admit, that I'm rather ambivalent when it comes to expressing the two experiences I've had on paper and in black & white for that matter. Therefore, what I'll do is start with the good aspects of this restaurant. First of all, they have some of the best German beer specimens this side of the Prime Meridian. In this respect, they are incomparable. Secondly, the food is hearty German fare, I've honestly learned to like the Teutonic tidbits featured on the Bauhuasesque menu. Why, even the lack of decor adds an almost stark nostalgia, that hearkens back to a Grimm Brothers fairy-tale. What, with the crocheted doily's and the Hansel & Gretel tulips and shit. \nNow for the bad. The service (or lack of) was something to be desired. Now, I've been in the \"customer service\" industry for years and granted, I know how it feels to get slammed. But come on...to be completely ignored on a \"relatively\" busy night is simply rude. And when you go up to say, order a beer (because you have been waiting for oh, about 20 minutes in the \"lounge\", for a table) and then have that shaved , sassy Wookie of a waiter, (literally) clap in your face to urge you to hurry up with your drink order, (like he has been waiting on you or something) is nothing short of an invitation to WAR! It only sours the whole dining experience. Due to this action alone, I will not be going back for a long while, maybe never. When I finally told it what I wanted to drink, (s)he then rolled her lidless eye and commented to another patron (who asked what it was pouring) \"that he did not like it\" and dismissed it, like (s)he only served it because it was it's job. Thanks for nothing Adolf. Not only did he commit a disservice to the other patron (discouraging a future order, perhaps) but disregarded my selection as well and with such disdain. I'm quite aware that we all have our own opinions but I was not there to hear him voice his. Perhaps this is the German way, but guess what? We are not in Germany. This is why I'm truly undecided in regards to my feelings about this place.

It was the rainiest day I have ever experienced in San Francisco, the entire city seemed to be a puddle and a cab was no-where to be found.  I BARTED to Mission and we decided to walk from there ( it is very walkable, maybe 3 blocks) .  When we arrived at the restaurant it felt so homey it was comforting and exciting all at once.  For such a rainy day when no one in their right mind would be out it seemed crowded, no open tables and no where to sit and wait, but they served us drinks none the less and spoke German to my friend which was neat to hear. Although I do not remember what the  beer I drank was called, it was really good, and was not served too warm and was not served too cold - just right for a freezing and soaking wet southern Californian.  All of the deco is done East German pre-fall-of -the-wall style. My friend went around to all of the walls and was wide eyed (almost teary -but in a manly way) as he explained what all of the brands/ pictures meant and once were when he was a child. At last we were seated and ate, he had a Beef Stoganoff ( I think) and what I ate I have no idea what it was called, but I will describe : thin beef rolled around mustard and pickles served with snitzle ? and this cabbage stuff.. I know it sounds gross but everything except for the cabbage was good, and the cabbage was probably good, but I just don't like cabbage.

When my friends arrived ~10 minutes later, we were rudely informed that we'd have to wait 20 minutes more. On inquiring whether we'd have enough time to order before the kitchen closed at 10pm (- the alternative would have been to look over the menus as we were waiting for our table -), the hostess very condescendingly replied that we would & that she wouldn't bother seating us otherwise. At that point, I'd had enough of their ridiculous attitude and we left.\nI was disappointed since I'd been looking forward to trying German cuisine, and shocked that they would provide such unacceptable service.", "author": "Kavya J."}

I'm pretty sure all the staff here speak German and I use that as an opportunity to practice my awful German. The restaurant is cozy, and there is a small waiting area in the back but a reservation is recommended.  The prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are MASSIVE! I can't remember the exact name of the dish I always order, but it's some kind of schnitzel with spaetzle and a yummy creamy mushroom sauce. I've also had the short ribs before too, but I think they are too heavy to eat alone and are a better dish shared between two people with a soup or salad. I really recommend this restaurant for anyone who likes East German cuisine and who has a very hearty appetite. Good for small groups of 4 or less.", "author": "Jade L."}

Another reviewer below mentioned loss of chef in September (last time I was there before Thanksgiving weekend would have been before that), so maybe this is what happened.  \n\nI've also been rather forgiving of the pictures of communists on the wall (and, how sad that a reviewer that pointed this out thinks the middle picture is Stalin?!)(it's Engels).

There's not much in the way of good eats in that corridor, so we made many trips to the 16th and Mission area. And then, one fateful evening in 1999, my roommate and I strolled by a newly opened restaurant with a black awning, we decided to duck in for a beer, and the rest is history... Walzwerk has changed out lives forever. If you haven't been by, you're doing yourself a great disservice. Christiane and Isabel (the founders) are two of the most funky and friendly East Germans I've ever met, and their food definitely reflects their European beauty and charm. \r\n\r\nEven when vegetarian friends come to town, we love taking them to Walzwerk (ever heard of veggie schnitzel? I hadn't.) Decidedly different than Suppenkuche (and in my opinion, so much better), the menu features a nice array of traditional German dishes from Thuringer Bratwurst (my personal favorite) to Marinated Beef (the close #2 to the Brat) to apple stuffed chicken, to nice fish (get Salmon!) and pork plates. For appetizers, don't miss the pickled herring plate in sour cream sauce and the potato pancakes... a must if you're revving up the night with a hearty stein of beer. And the beer... oh the beer... I'm wrapped up in a self-proclaimed love affair with the Walzwerk bar. They feature imported kegs of Dunkles Heffeweizen, Weltenburg Helles, Kostritzer Swarzbier, and so many more. Always perfectly chilled, always appearing in the proper labeled glassware, and always served with a disclaimer and smile, I love to catch a taxi to Walzwerk to just go wild sampling all the draughts. \r\n\r\nFor dessert, don't miss the 'Cold Dog'---not at all what it sounds like, anyone will enjoy this layered pastry dipped in chocolate. And around the holidays, if you've never had a German-style duck plate, you better get your reservations in early. Hands down, Walzwerk is not only the best East German food in the city, it's, straight-up, the best German food in all of Northern California. Period.\r\n\r\nAnd I can't forget the totally wild ambiance that Walzwerk pulls off... it's something like a mix of standing next to the Berlin Wall crossed with a 1950's German miscellanea museum, crossed with an SF family's Victorian home sitting room. Even the cutlery and plates are all mismatched, as if you turned over an old chest in some forgotten attic and had yourself a tea party--truly a unique and inspiring local experience.", "author": "Ankarino L."}

And it went a little something like this:\nI raced out of work to meet my BFF for a 5:30 movie at the Lumiere. We're both obsessed with anything Indian, and will gladly sit through the most ridiculous Bollywood musical just so we can plan our outfits for our Bollywood party, in a constant state of planning. I arrived late, finding her out front holding my ticket and a mysterious paper bag filled with \"treats.\"\nWe grabbed two fabulous indie theater seats, threw down our bags and as the credits rolled, I realized once again why Zoe is my BFF. \nMy girl pulled out 4 cans of Sofia minis. \nWe watched The Namesake. We laughed. We cried. We drank champagne out of a can. \nBy 8 o'clock I had kissed Zoe goodbye, called Mikey and offered, \"I can pick up food, we can order food or we can go out.\"\n\"I feel like going out.\"\n\"Oh thank god. Me too.\"\nWe drove around our hood looking for parking when I remembered. Walzwerk! That German joint. We should go there. After all, I was having dinner with the Aryan prince, a literal poster boy for SS recruiters. And parking at 14th and South Van Ness is a lot easier than 17th and Mission. \nWe walked inside, found the perfect table by the window and ordered our respective wine and beer. (Note to my fellow wine drinkers, they have like 3 choices and all by the glass. I had the Chard. It was fine.)\nThe place was packed with loud hipstard types, the staff was all Euro-laid back and we had glittery, warm candles at our table. Dipping our spectacular potato pancakes in sour cream and chives, we settled in and perused our menu. Aryan prince wanted the special of the day, a mixed grill with sausage, salmon and beef, with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. I had bites of all (except the salmon. I don't do salmon) and it was good. Not great. But good. \nI couldn't decide between the jaegersnitzel or the sauerbraten and our adorable server wisely suggested the sauerbraten, but with a side of spatzle instead of potato dumplings. It was great, especially the spatzle and red cabbage, but incredibly filling. I ordered more wine as we began our third round of Anne Frank jokes. \nAryan prince leaned in. \"I bet they're wondering what the hell I'm doing with a brown haired, brown eyed girl. Don't worry. You're Italian. Technically, we're on the same side.\" \n\"Check out these portraits on the wall. Who the hell is that? Heinrich Himmler?\"\n\"Hey, Ava Braun. Volume.\"\n\"What? Too soon?\"\nIt's not a fun dinner unless it's a wildly inappropriate dinner. Any reference to my being a happy \"camper\" was taken beyond the realms of decency. It was fabulous. \nBut after three drinks and enough food to stock the Fuhrerbunker, it was time to go home. Getting the check, however, proved to be impossible. That adorable server had settled in at a table, engrossed in conversation with the cast of Sprockets. And the only other staff member was scrambling to deal with everyone else, including a table of A-Ha fans playing cards nearby. It probably took 30 minutes from the time we wanted to leave to our actually pushing open the door. \nIt pissed the Aryan prince off more than it did me. After all, I got canned champagne and a movie with the BFF, a cute, worldly, out-of-the-ordinary dinner with the Gestapo's dream candidate and a cache of appalling, send-you-straight-to-hell jokes that'll last me till my next plate of spatzle...", "author": "Beth S."}

The German draft beer was good (Spaten Amber ... mmm!) , but everything else was below expectation.  I ordered the Sauerbraten (tough, thick slices without much flavor)  with Potato Dumplings (dry and bland) and Braised Red Cabbage (the only food item that could really be classified as excellent).  My wife had one of the night's specials, Goulash (better than mine, but still only ok) with Spatzle (should have been lighter).  Also tried the Tomato - Cabage Soup and Thuringer Salad, of which neither were particularly appealing.  Service was lacking and the noise level was very high.

You walk in and immediately notice that this is not your usual Bavarian style German place.  Not that Bavarian is bad, but it gets a bit old and stereotypical after a while.  This place is East German.  There was a group of four of us.  We couldn't get reservations when we called ahead, so we showed up and decided to wait for a table.  I am so glad that we did.  We walked in and immediately noticed the decor, with pictures of Lenin and Marx hung on the walls.  The bathroom is even a homage to East German products (behind glass cases though).  We also quickly understood why we couldn't get a reservation.  The place is really small, it feels like you are in someone's living room.  The staff was incredibly cool and gracious. There was a blond German waitress with tattoos up her arm and a tall bald German waiter.  Both were great.  We were able to wait in a comfortable couch area by the bar and drink some awesome beer. I have to really recommend the Schwarzbier, really yummy!  We didn't have to wait too long for a table by the window to open up.\r\nThe food was great, the pitchers of beer kept coming and a good time was had by all.  Two of us had the Schnitzel, which was great.  My husband had the beer marinated pork special, really great.  One of us had the stuffed chicken breast, really incredible. We also all split the potato pancakes as an appetizer, highly recommended with sour cream and applesauce as toppings.  Meals run at about $13-15, but you get a large quantity of really good food, funky decor and fun wait staff.  I have a good friend who lives in the Midwest who is East German.  She keeps going to \"German\" festivals and restaurants only to be disappointed because they are all Bavarian.  Next time she visits out here, I will be taking her to Walzwerk, she won't be disappointed, and neither will anyone who gives this place a chance.  I think it may have to become my new hangout.", "author": "Kate B."}

My friend and I shared our entrees, beef remoulade and jager schnitzel, both were done to perfection.

The BF and I were fortunate enough to be invited out for dinner and since I've been on a self imposed healthy food, lots of veggies, small portions diet I was looking forward to a splurge of pork products and buttery potatoes. \nWe arrived about 30 min after the rest of the group, just in time for the potato cakes! I smothered mine in sour cream and applesauce and it was FANTASTIC! When it came time to order, I was pretty much decided on the schnitzel and decided to change to the bratwurst at the last minute. I had been craving bratwurst since my recent trip to Rosemunde but I was afraid that I would be wasting valuable plate space with the saurkraut. When the food arrived all my worries went out the window. The saurkraut was by far the best I've ever had and was perfect when mixed with the potatoes and a piece of sausage. The portions are huge and we managed to leave with enough leftovers for lunch the next day!

I have never been disappointed with anything.\n\nThe mashed potatoes are the best I've ever had. The spatzle is always right and surprisingly it must be easy to mess this up.\n\nTypical of a German reataurant, the beer comes right away and the food and the check take time. That's the way I like it.\n\nThank God they don't play the ompa pa pa music. In Muenchen, they play all sorts of music at different restaurants, but every one of them does not play tuba music. At Walzwerk, they tend toward jazz and not too loud. It's at that volume which affords some privacy without making the place into a bomb.\n\nI tend to come at 5:30 without a reservation and choose one of the window seats which gives additional privacy. By 5:45, the place is packed.\n\nOnly the German place in Reno at 6th and Valley has better entries, but they play the ompa pa pa music there. I guess that's the way it goes. \"ompa pa pa\" music at German places and the \"diddil le dee\" music at Irish", "author": "Frank W."}

I liked Walzwerk much better than Suppenkuche (I think SK is a bit more salt-crazed. I remember being super dehydrated after that meal.) The other aspect that sealed the deal for me is the ambience--its identity is neither overly hip nor culturally kitschy, but is eccentric enough to make you feel like you're having a unique experience.

It has that homey, comforty, I want to eat this on a cold foggy day feel to it. Especially the stuffed chicken breast, good enough to make me rat out my own brother to the Stasi. I also dig the industrial/DDR vibe inside. Good enough for 4 stars, right? It was my last visit, however, that earned Walzwerk the elusive fifth star.\n\nHop on the N down to Van Ness and walk the couple blocks down with the idea of having a couple (TWO) beers. Walk in and there is the woman I saw working  last time. Tall, Teutonic and gorgeous. Order beer in my non-existent German (go international playa!) and talk to her a bit. Mira (aforementioned hot thing) sits at the counter next to me to eat dinner before the rush and we talk about travel, how she's going back to Germany in a month and the Bundesliga. Bear in mind it's beer 4 or 5 now. More small talk and now she's running around with Marcel (other employee and all around cool mofo) handling orders. El Foxer (thats me, email if you want details on that handle) asks Mira if she 'd like to go out before she goes home. \"No, boyfriend in Deutschland.\" to which I reply \"That's horrible\" (with a smile). FREEZE. At this time my ex-girlfriend, who had called earlier to see what I was up to and also loves this place, drops into the stool next to me. Mira then looks at me and says, \"Don't pout.\" Ex then calls me out as being wasted so I classily glide/stumble to the bathroom. Now I'm sure she had a conversation with M.,  most likely on why we're exes (it's not me Jason, it IS you), and I re-emerge almost incoherent. To the best of my knowledge I tell Marcel he's the man, go jerk-mode on Mira and let X tell me that she's driving me home as she doesn't think I can walk to the train. X is forced to fill out the bill and help me sign my name as well as start running damage control for me. The last thing I remember saying on the way out was that I was going to have all the employees fired. All through this, I got great service and (too much) great beer.

We also didn't want to blow a ton of money, but we wanted decent food and have been wanting to try this place for a while. We both wondered what East German food was going to be like since most German places serve Bavarian cuisine. We arrived hungry and pretty much already knew what we wanted even before we got there. So, Marc & I both had the Schnitzel (breaded and fried pork loin) with the delicious mushroom cream sauce except I had mine with the Spatzle (a type of homemade egg drop-noodle) and the boy had his with mashed potatoes. While the sauce and noodles were really good, the meat itself could have been more tender. The dark lager was decent but their beer selection definitely was nowhere near as big as Suppenkuche's. The organic Elderberry soda was quite refreshing though. The waiters & waitresses were nice and made substitutions without a problem. The decor was pretty interesting -- they really tried to make it look like a mid 20th C Eastern German place complete with framed posters of various Communist leaders & ads from that period. Being German, Marc was interested and took a walk around after dinner to check everything out. The dishes and flatware were also an eclectic mix of anything from homey looking stoneware and plain flatware to some random nicer pieces. The tables were eclectic too, and only the beer & soda glasses were consistent. It was a nice evening and we were served quickly by nice people. Basically, it was a good experience but no replacement for the Walter-run Schnizelhaus -- we really miss that place.", "author": "Samantha H."}

Tucked away on the edge of the Mission (about a block away from 16th Str Bart) the decor very much reminded me of the film \"Goodbye Lenin\" (which I loved btw). It's not so big, and people do make reservations, also not so good for large parties (max of 6 people really).\n\nGood selection of German beer on tap, some bottle selections as well. I had the Franziskaner (hef), surprisingly our server told me \"I thought you might like that one\" to which I replied yes and laughed. Not sure if I give off a \"I want Franziskaner\" aura or something. We started with the kartoffelpuffer (potato pancakes) which were quite good, with applesauce and sour cream. Haven't had that much since I was in Germany 4 years ago, so I was quite happy if you can imagine. Dishes, I ordered the kaesespaetzle, which was much better than the ones at other German restaurants in the area. Honestly felt like this was quite authentic, with German servers and German people as part of the restaurants patrons. This is a place I would probably recommend to my German relatives, I think they would feel at home, sort of. To top off dessert was the rote gruetze, which I have never seen at any other German restaurant (also introduced to me in Germany of course... many many years ago). I don't quite remember the taste of it from Germany but I thought it was not so bad at the restaurant.\n\nOverall service was not so bad as some people say, there were basically 2 servers and one lady who brought out some food and took away plates and cleaned tables but didn't take your order (she was the American).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-04", "description": "Absolutely superb fare and service. REAL German cuisine. Excellent service.  Located on S. Van Ness (a nothing neighborhood according to our cab driver). We brought a party of 15 for a party and the owners suggested they serve us family style from a selection of their appetizers and entrees. I am very glad we took them up on their suggestion!\n\nThe decor is a homage to the old DDR (East Germany pre 1989). There is a definite nostalgia for the old days by many ex east Germans. The walls are hung with posters and memorabilia from the DDR era including photos of Karl Marx and Lenin along with East German rock and roll LP's. \n\nThe space is small but not claustrophobic and the tables and chairs are simple, wooden and proletarian. Unpretentious to a fault.\n\nWe started with Small Potato Pancakes with Chive Sour Cream and Applesauce. They were perfectly seasoned with a brown crust outside, light and creamy inside. Next, Matjes Herring in Sour Cream with Apples, Onions and Pickles, served with Pumpernickel Bread. I love pickled herring and this version is a winner. (in fact, I overdid it on the herring!). This was followed by their House cured Salmon with Horseradish Cream & Marinated Beets. I am always suspicious of cured salmon served in restaurants since most times, it tastes like it came right from a package but this dish was the real deal and obviously prepared in house. Finally, we had the Thuringer Salad (White Cabbage, Red Cabbage & Carrot Salad) and Walzwerk's\nHouse Green Salad (Butter Lettuce with a Light Oil & Vinegar Dressing). The cabbages and carrots were dressed like slaw but very lightly. Delicious! The salad was ok. Not spectacular. But definitely fresh and good.\n\nNext the entrees, served heaped on huge platters. The J\u00e4ger Schnitzel (Porkloin) with Sp\u00e4tzle and Creamy Mushrooom Sauce was not like the J\u00e4ger Schnitzel I have had in Berlin which was always served breaded and doused in a heavy brown sauce. Walzwerk's version is served unbreaded and thinly sliced in a very light brown wild mushroom cream sauce and was superb. \n\nThe second entree (all were served together); Garlic Roast Pork with Potatoes and Vegetables. The roast pork was cooked perfectly (I could cut it with a fork!) and not overpowered by the garlic. \n\nThe third entry was my favorite (as well as with most of the table): Breast of Chicken stuffed with Apples & Bacon (with Sundried Cherry Sauce), Mashed Potatoes, and Seasonal Vegetables. I have never had anything quite like this. As with all stuffed chicken breast dishes, the danger is in overcooking the chicken so that it is tough and dry. Not at Walzwerks. The breast was succulent and juicy. The stuffing just the right amount of sweet and savory. The mashed potatoes were  as light as whipped cream and served with a big bowl of green peas which, though I love, were definitely of the frozen variety. Didn't matter. They were a perfect compliment to the meal.\n\nDessert? Nearly everyone got the Strudel, a few the Cold Dog and one person , the berry pudding. I didn't sample the pudding but I had the Strudel and it was the best strudel I have ever eaten, and that includes my own which is not bad. The Cold Dog was just ok, not bad. Reminded me of a mini ice box cake from the 50's.\n\nOverall, it was a great meal for a great party. Generous servings of real comfort food prepared with care and skill. I will definitely go back to try the rest of the menu. Don't miss this out on this little gem of an eatery.", "author": "Jim G."}

Got there around 7:30 on a Saturday and told there was a 30 min wait. They don't accept reservations for parties of less than 4. We sat in the small waiting area and had drinks. The 7up/beer sounded good, but not sure so they gave me 2 VERY generous samples, one w/ pilsner other with wheat beer. Wheat was tasty. Also sampled the sparkling wine. That was really good. Would like more of that. \nWhen seated for dinner, I had several questions. Server was nice enough but a bit terse. Understandable though, as It was busy and there were only 2 servers. \nThe soljanka soup sounded oddly good. Cabbage/tomato soup with pickles, salami and bacon? Love it. I love pickles and I love salami (nothing silly intended), so this soup was my kinda thing. Not that much cabbage. Lots of small cubes of salami. Would love a meal size version of this. \nFor entree got the roasted garlic pork. Really wanted to try either the spaetzle or the potato dumplings but roast pork came w/potatoes. Was able to sub the spaetzle. Friend got the schnitzel. \nThey ended up giving me potatoes and spaetzle. Server apologized and said they forgot, so gave me a side of spaetzle in separate bowl. I was told they wouldn't charge for two things, but spaetzle is extra. My pork was presented as two pinwheel type rounds with loads of garlic rolled inside. Alot of meat. Alot of food! The seasonal veggie was slices of cooked carrots. One pork wheel was a bit tough. The other was more tender but most of the outside of the round was a rind of fat. All needed salt. The spaetzle was lukewarm. I love chewy pasta-type foods, but wasn't so excited about the spaetzle. Not much flavor and no discernible sauce or seasoning. Probably better hot. \nMy friend's schnitzel was tasty and tender. What's not to like about pounded thin pork that's been breaded and pan fried?! He liked my dish better. I liked his better. \nMost unusual, I was unable to finish my meal. That almost never happens unless I'm ill. I think it was the heaviness and meatiness that did me in. And boy, was there a lot of garlic! I was belching garlic fire all night. Kinda gross, really. \nIn the end I'd say I LOVE the soup, but could pass on the rest. It was okay, not great. The service was nice, relatively friendly and i wasn't charged for the spaetzle nor one of my 7up/beer drinks. \nThe samples they gave me of the drinks were large and also not charged. I left full, satisfied, but not ecstatic. \nI have been searching for a good Soljanka recipe today, though. Anyone have Walzwerk's? Do they sell that by the vat?", "author": "Allucaneat G."}

I had the Jger Schnitzel with Sptzle and Creamy Mushrooom Sauce and it was very good. \n\nIf you want to check out German food, this is the place to go", "author": "vernice l."}

And the wait can be infuriating, especially if you're a party of 2 and there are plenty of larger tables open. \nBut. You can't really beat the atmosphere. It feels like an (admittedly somewhat trendy) Ossi bar in Berlin (or Dresden or Jena, etc.), right down to the unassuming little plastic salt and pepper shakers and the unmistakable home-cooked taste of the food. All you need is a view of some ugly pre-fab housing and some sad old chainsmoking retirees and you'd be on Leipzigerstrasse. \nOne gripe I do have is that a lot of the food is a bit too sweet, but I complain about the food in the way that you'd complain about your mom's food. It just tastes satisfyingly homey, and any misgivings can be washed away with a healthy dose of beer. \nI do wish they kept bar hours, did group-seating ala Suppenkueche and had Augustiner (granted, not an East German beer, but then, neither is Weltenburger, Franziskaner or a number of others they also serve), but whatever. They've got killer sauerbraten, bratwurst and potato dumplings. Those potato dumplings are awesome. Granted, I've never seen how they actually make them, but they taste just like authentic Thuringian potato dumplings made from grated raw potato (as opposed to cooked, mashed potatoes), which give them a unique texture and taste you'd be hard-pressed to find even in Germany.", "author": "Kei H."}

We decided to head to San Francisco on a spontaneous evening and really wanted to find a good German restaurant to eat. We stumbled across some reviews for Walzwerk and decided to do it. We made reservations and were immediately greater by a friendly young lady and seated in a great dining room full of ambiance. We felt like we were eating at our grandmas house. It was busy and smelled delicious. We started with great beer and potato pancakes with sour cream and applesauce. They were delicious and crispy and had wonderful flavor. While it took awhile to get our meal, we very much enjoyed savoring the atmosphere and experience. Our kids loved it too! Once the food arrived let me tell you it was worth the wait. Authentic German Food just like my husbands family makes. He had the beef roulade with Sp\u00e4tzle and red cabbage. It was so tender and flavorful and the gravy was sooooooo good! I had the j\u00e4ger schnitzel! So delicious. We have tried a handful of German restaurants and this was fantastic and blew the others away!!

I am the only one in the bunch from Berlin; there are folks from Bavaria, from the Rheinland, and from the Ruhrpott, but we all agree that have dinner at Walzwerk is a bit like coming home to home-cooked meal.  It's, as we say in Germany, \"wie bei Muttern\"  (like at mom's).  \n\nI must admit that back in Germany the \"Ostalgia,\" a somewhat delusional infatuation with the lost days of the GDR, truly get on my nerves.  Though I grew up in West Berlin during the days of the wall, I still don't feel any desire for the good old days of East German \"charme.\"  But I do get nostalgic for the Berlin of the 70s and have my regular bouts of homesickness.  And Walzwerk is a good way to celebrate both.  \n\nChristiane, the owner and heart and mind behind the entire operation, is absolutely fantastic.  She is funny, warm and kind.  I fear that some of the folks who felt intimidated by her ways were probably misreading her suggestions for demands.  \n\nIf you are in the mood for good and AUTHENTIC German food in a really nice place, go to Walzwerk, have a beer, enjoy the Schnitzel or Sptzle or the Bratwurst and hang for a few hours.

To get there, I had to change 25 West German Deutschmarks for 25 East German ones, which at first didn't bother me, but at the time, people were pretty excited about some wall coming down or something and East Berlin was basically a ghost town as all the East Germans were over in West Berlin buying Japanese electronics at inflated prices, drinking coca-cola and reveling a bit too much in the joys of capitalism.  The only place in East Berlin I could find to spend my East German Deutschmarks was a little ice-cream parlor that doled out cold war-sized wafer cones of strict ice milk in an assortment that was pedestrian at best.  Even with my Middle American appetite, I can't down 25 East German Deutschmarks worth of Gorbachev-era ice-milk, and on that day, with all the excitement of chipping away at the wall and meeting Checkpoint Charlie MP's from Port Washington, WI, I only managed to get rid of about 4 of East German Deutschmarks.  So now, somewhere in my vast collection of crap, probably in a bag next to the pieces of the wall that I chipped off using a hammer I stole from a little kid from Baden-Baden, I have 21 rather austere looking, completely obsolete East German Deutschmarks.\n\nOk, yeah, so Walzwerk...\n35 stars for the spinach salmon spaetzle!  Sadly, I'll have to dock them 22 stars for not having it on the menu every day.  Actually, come to think of it, I'm going to dock them another 6 stars for not delivering to me personally a spinach salmon spaetzle dinner 5 out of 7 nights of the week.  Ok, where does that leave us...7 stars?  That sounds about right.\n\nI love this place.  As you've probably gathered, I love the Spaetzle, with or without salmon and spinach.  In fact, at times it's hard for me to order anything else due to this mildly unhealthy infatuation.  But I have persevered in the face of such noodle-y adversity and have tried many other Teutonic treats as well.  The beet soup is good and comes in a really cool square red \"bowl\".  The Sauerbraten is great, not too sweet, not too sauer, sorry...sour and perfectly tender.  The Jagerschnitzle, also great, bratwurst great, potato pancakes, great, Thuringer salad great, red cabbage...see the trend?  The big potato dumplings could use a little extra something, as could the red berry pudding desert, but all is forgiven in light of the sauerkraut which can only be described as magnificent.  They have a great German beer selection, many on tap, as well as a pair of interesting beer and soda concoctions which are actually pretty refreshing.  They also have a perfect dessert called cold dog, which is cold but not canine in any way I can see.  I wish I could remember the name of the little bottles of aquavit-esque liquor they have on hand as a post-spaetzle digestif...kind of an acquired taste but an apt way to top off the meal.\n\nThe service is good, too.  They're working hard there, and can be, on occasion, a little gruff, but always good natured and quick to laugh.  It does always seem to be busy, so either make a reservation or be prepared to squeeze into the small waiting area and drink excellent beer until your number's up.

Very unassuming from the outside, but decidedly welcoming and charming on the inside. On a Friday night we arrived around 7 without a reservation- no problem as they invited us to sit down on a couch near the bar and order drinks. The waitress was extremely nice and allowed me to sample the Reisling- the sample size was an entire glass! Needless to say, the time passed quite quickly waiting for the table, and before we knew it we were seated at a slightly kitchy table decorated with fake flowers. I unintentionally knocked my glass of reisling over but the waitress was kind enough to refill the glass again. We shared the potato pancakes with sour cream, chives, and apple sauce for an appetizer. The pancakes were very thick- crispy on the outside yet soft and mushy on the inside. For dinner I had the vegetarian schnitzel which consisted of breaded and fried vegetables (carrots, beets, cauliflower) over a mountain of mashed potatoes and drizzled with a creamy tomato sauce. A very rich meal indeed, not to mention the portions are enormous. My meal would easily have fed three people. I also tried the mushroom spatzle, which was creamy and delicious.  I recommend this restaurant for anyone craving German food but unwilling to put up with trendy over hyped places- Walzwerk is definitely a down to earth satisfying experience and you will not leave hungry.", "author": "Kate A."}

My excitement was quelched by the lousy food and rotten service. At first I chalked up the serivce to part of the East German ambience, later I realized it was just sheer attitude. Worst German meal ever!!! The potato dumpling was like eating a warm, wet, sponge - absolutely no flavor. My buddy had the spaetzle; weirdest I've ever seen. His chicken was good (roast chicken...go figure) but my sauerbraten was over-cooked and full of grissle. If the bad food and bad service were part of the East German theme I could laugh it off, but it clearly isn't.

Avoid the beef roulade as under cooked (it needed to be braised for much longer) so did not have that melt in your mouth moment.  The cold dog was great and the apple strudel was disappointing.

In a kinda random location (i.e., not on the main Mission drag), it is definitely worth seeking out.  The first words out a the waitresses' mouth were, \"So we want beers, ya?\"  This came as no surprise as the seven of us were decked out in full douche bag, frat-bro, Marina gear (striped, collared shirts; I know don't hate me too much, I do own a few).  Still, looking as tooly as we may have, it was great to have some authentic German beers to start (I think they have Spaten, Franziskaner, and the usuals on tap, but some good dunkels and Aventinus on bottle!)  The food is amazing, stuffed chicken breast was delicious and the mashed potatoes are some of the best I've ever had.  The decor is old East German propaganda and posters of Lenin and Marx, which is a little unnerving, but adds to the experience.  A small and somewhat rowdy spot, not good for a quiet first date, but great for groups or a date that's down for a good time.

However, I feel it worked out to my advantage because I've never quite had a restaurant experience that's been so hard for me to pin down.  Thus, I'll need to return.  Here's what I know.  I had a really nice time with some friends in the back room and feel I just ordered the wrong dish (wasn't too impressed w/ the stuffed red peppers: very 7-11 microwavey).  I also think I prefer the front of the restaurant, which has a cuter, and slightly more civilized, vibe.  Now the strange part of the whole thing is that I really think I am going to love this place.  I love the yard sale sort of vibe w/ regard to the design (tables, utensils ect).  Very cute.  Also, it seemed really warm.  That is, the vibe between the owners/staff and what appeared to be a regular clientele.  Plus, any restaurant that serves mashed potatoes with practically every dish has it going on.  So, there you have it.

The food was perfect: very German, very hearty, and very delicious.  They had a vegetarian option that was very nice.  But the dining experience was disappointing.  We walked in and the restaurant was almost filled, and we had to stand there in the middle of the room wondering who we should talk to to get our name on a list or whatever.  It was extremely awkward.  We had two servers who were wonderful and friendly, but we were neglected badly.  After the meal they dropped off a menu for dessert and let us sit almost 15 minutes, and at the end another 15-minute wait for our check.  My two friends and I wanted to share a dessert because the dinner had been so filling, but the servers were reluctant to bring three plates so we could share cleanly.  We got this red berry thing in a glass with three spoons, and I didn't wish to eat my friends' saliva so I had to dump some of the dessert into my water glass so I could have my own portion.  The back room was very Spartan and noisy, and a crying infant made conversation impossible at our table. The bill was on the steep side, too, around $85 (including tip) for three people.  But the food was good. My suggestion is to go at an off-peak time when it's not crowded, try to sit in the front room, and bring your own plates if you want to share dessert.  Or just put up with everything and soak up what life in East Germany must have been like.", "author": "Daniel L."}
