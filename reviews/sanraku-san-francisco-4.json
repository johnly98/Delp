The one on sutter is good too, but if you dont want to get venture out, this one will do the trick. I have been coming here for more than a decade and still love it, they have renovated it a few years ago and it looks much better now.\n\nThey have a frequent dining card, a $10.00 (max) worth of discount towards your final check, you have to accumulate a total of 10 points total to receive it, meaning if your final bill is $40.00, you will get a 4 points total added to your sanraku card until you reach 10 pts or a $10.00 gift cert/card will be sent to you and so on. The prices are reasonable for what you get, compared it to others in the same area.\n\nThe food here is always fresh, the staff are welcoming and are intune with customer's need and wants, and from time to time, will add new recipe on the menu. The former chef here, I think his name is shinji, competed once on that TV show iron chef america, and i think he won and now works for nobu in nyc. TIP -- be friends with the chef, they will make you a secret cuisine ( not on the menu) but just for you, enjoy !", "author": "YelpIsExtortion N S."}

I arrived towards the end of the dinner shift and was seated at the sushi counter.  I had a OpenTable reservation for standard seating, but I didn't complain because the single tables were either not open or not cleared.\n\nThe staff, while friendly, really couldn't offer much opinion on the daily special menu (which was rather extensive).  I ordered the Sashimi Deluxe from regular menu and an Uni Shooter and Special Squid Sashimi from the daily menu.\n\nThe Uni Shooter was well balanced, but light on the uni.  I'm pretty sure they just gave me standard squid (and seemed to be confirmed once I got the bill).  The deluxe was nice and included rice and miso, however, 15 pieces would probably be more likely considered 12 in terms of size elsewhere.", "author": "Michael F."}

You can easily access it from Yerba Beuna Gardens as well as the entrance on 4th Street.\n\nWhile the other restaurants there make you wait in line to order and then find a table to sit at, Sanraku has a waitstaff, takes reservations and does the seating for you.\n\nOur food came out very quickly and we ordered a lot...   They have their service down to a science as most people are there to also see a movie after dinner and need to finish sooner than normal.  We sat down at 6:35pm and had our bill by 7:02pm.\n\nThe miso soup was my favorite out of everything that we ordered.  \nI did love the texture and consistency to the California Rolls too but, I wished they were more flavorful.\nThe chicken teriyaki consisted of an all- white meat and good quality chicken pieces that were covered in quite the tasty sauce.\nTheir gyoza were smaller than what I'm used to and shaped like a traditional pot sticker.  The dipping sauce was good too.\nI didn't care for the salad dressing as it was a bit too sweet for me.\n\nService was good.

The restaurant wasn't too busy at the time and my coworker and I sat at the bar. While the nigiri/sashimi we got was really good, the service was absolutely terrible. We first ordered a variety of sashimi and nigiri to start but the server never came back to us again. We wanted to order more food but it was nearly impossible to flag anyone down. It's like they don't even look up on purpose! They never came back to fill up our drinks or check up on us. Sitting at the bar, you would think the chefs would also check up on us or see if we wanted anything else....but not even a slight acknowledgement that we were there.\n\nIt's really too bad because the sushi was really fresh and kept us wanting more. The only time we got any attention was when they finally came to clear our plates and asked if we wanted our check, which was a fair amount of time after we had already finished. \n\nCheck out this place at your own risk!

Reasonable prices, convenient location, and sushi that does the trick. I've never actually dined in, just ordered takeout on Eat24, so my experience is based on the food.\n\nThe restaurant is attached to the Metreon building in Soma, right around a bunch of shops, restaurants, and a movie theater. I usually order a Philadelphia roll, a shrimp tempura, and spicy tuna roll, each for about $8/$9, which is affordable for San Francisco. Not the best sushi I've ever had, but after 6 hours of traveling from New York to San Francisco, it really does the trick. Especially on Sundays when NOTHING is open and I cannot bring myself to eat McDonalds.

Taste wise I think she thought her soba was fine.  We also shared an order of gyoza which was standard.  I got the sashimi salad (another friend raved about this to me).  They were very generous with the fish, and unfortunately wouldn't take any requests to omit certain fishes and give more of tuna or salmon as I asked.  The dressing was aight citrus dressing.  I loved the salmon and tuna but didn't care for the mackerel or hamachi.  I've only had hamachi at Alexander's before and loved those little shooters.  The fish seemed fresh, I have to warn you that I am just very picky with fish.  \n\nI've heard that the original Sutter location is better so if you are a fish aficionado, you may want to head to that location instead.

It was movie night for my wife and I and since Jurassic World started at 7pm, we made reservations for 5:30pm on a Saturday.\n\nSo upon arrival the restaurant was semi-empty. Not really busy but 5:30 is an early dinner time. We were handed menus and asked what drinks we would like. It's all the typical Japanese/sushi type items you'd expect. They actually have a nigiri list of fish imported from Japan, New Zealand, and Europe as well. However we stuck to the regular menu:\n\nSushi Platter: this consists of California roll and 8 pieces of nigiri (chefs choice)\n\nDragon and rainbow rolls.\n\nI thought the sushi was average. The cuts of fish are on the small side, not generous by any means. The quality was fine. Presentation-wise it was decent. Nothing really stood out, but at the same time I didn't have anything glaringly bad from what I ordered.\n\nThe service was ok, however I did have to look for the waitress a couple times during the meal.

The one on Sutter has been there a number of years, but I've never tried that location either even though the reviews are better. I just figured how good could it be if they decided to open one at the Metreon with a front entrance smack in the middle of the food court (photo: http://bit.ly/1a9STyS). Surely it can't be any better than Sorabol Korean or Coriander Thai. Well, I was wrong. I admit it. I'm not sure why Jamie W. and I ended up here for dinner on a Sunday, but I had it my head that I should try it at least once. We were taken into the inner recesses of the restaurant in the far right corner, but it didn't appear to affect the speed of their service.\n\nThe menu is quite comprehensive spanning all the expected Japanese dishes including quite a sushi selection. We started with our usual, a $4 bowl of Edamame lightly seasoned with sea salt (photo: http://bit.ly/1xrJEEd). Good start. Jamie ordered the $16 Sesame Chicken, quite a pile of chicken breast pieces marinated with a sweet sauce so that the sesame seeds had something to hold onto. It came with steamed vegetables and a tiny scoop of potato salad (photo: http://bit.ly/19mIpuJ). The poultry was surprisingly moist with the seeds providing a nice crunch. Because he ordered a full dinner, he also got the bowl of salad with miso dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/1CBEvtB) and the cup of miso soup (photo: http://bit.ly/19mIz5k), both done primarily by the numbers but both satisfying nonetheless.\n\nI decided to try the $15 Sashimi Salad, which was quite an extravaganza of fresh sashimi - in particular, tuna, yellowtail, shrimp and squid - with organic mixed greens and sliced cherry tomatoes and topped with salmon roe (photo: http://bit.ly/1xOamaq). It was genuinely delicious, a most fortunate and refreshing surprise that was certainly hearty enough as an entree. As a chaser, I ordered the $8 Chawanmushi just because I hadn't had any in a long time. It's a savory steamed egg custard filled with seafood, spinach and mushrooms (photo: http://bit.ly/19mIgre). It was one of the best ones I've had in a long time as it managed the precarious balance between pudding-like and firm. Even though Sanraku was borne out of the Marriott Corporation and not a Ginza-originated chain, I still say give this Sanraku a try.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...unexpectedly solid Japanese fare here with an exceptional sashimi salad\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...outside it's the Metreon, inside you might as well be in the basement of the Matsuya Ginza department store\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...quick and responsive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...don't judge a Metreon operation by its cover... or its neighbors", "author": "Ed U."}

The location of this place is a bit meh -\u00a0it's attached to a shopping centre but it has a separate restaurant space so once you're inside, it's fine. We had a short wait for a table while they arranged us a table of 6 and then we were ready to order. \n\nThey have a bento of the day which is on display at the counter - I always love a bento so decided to go for that. We also got some dumplings and sushi for the table -\u00a0the dumplings here are excellent, I'd definitely recommend those. The bento box ordered arrived a bit after everyone else's food and they were packed with a selection of dishes as well as as separate portion of rice. Nothing in the box blew my mind -\u00a0it was all nice and tasty and fresh. There was a weird fried shumai which I didn't really like the texture of but apart from that I was pretty impressed with this place.", "author": "Briony C."}

I'm sold. My only qualm with Sanraku is the pricing. The sushi is a bit pricy given the location and the portions. \n\nBut DAMN, if it isn't delicious.\nI haven't tried everything on the menu, but anytime they mention 'specials,' I'll probably get it. They have monkfish liver here, which is something that seems offputting but GOD, it's so good. I haven't tried the uni here, but I've tried a lot of their other specials and each one of them has tasted fresh and delicious. Like I said, I'm not too sure why Sanraku has average reviews when their specials are pretty good and not ordinary. You wouldn't be able to get monkfish liver at just any ol' sushi joint. They take pride in their sushi and it shows. If you're going to follow the standard menu, you may be disappointed. The menu is average, and not the best Japanese food I've had, but it's doable in a pinch. I can see why people are not happy with the regular menu, but those people should just be adventurous and try everything on the specials menu :)\n\nThis would be a great place to have a quick date night before watching a movie at the Metreon.

I'm not a fan of waiting too long for food, especially when I'm starving (I admit, I have the case of the 'hangry'), so I was very happy at how fast our food came.\n\nThe food was tasty and flavorful, especially the sesame chicken. The dinner entree can be a bit big that my boyfriend even took half of his order home for lunch the next day. My katsu-don was enough. A lot of rice, but I can't complain because I love that they offer brown rice. \n\nOverall, I probably won't come back often.

It didn't smell fishy but texture and color spoke for itself. I ate some baby squids that came with our sashimi lunch. Had sourness and a little sweetness to the sauce that coated it - it tasted good. The Dragon Roll is my least favorite in this place. It's been a while since I ordered dragon but it's one of my fave rolls. As far as I remember it always have shrimp tempura in it. So they didn't have that in it. \n\nWe didn't have a permanent server and it seemed like it applied for everyone there. It can get little chaotic when some other servers come to ask you same questions that the other servers already did because they didn't know that someone already took care of you.", "author": "Lora M."}

Seems crazy, considering that mediocre raw fish could have painful consequences, so I guess that makes me a risk taker. Or just too lazy to walk to a 4-star joint.\n\nSanraku is tucked within the Metreon building, with a nice view of Yerba Buena garden. Like most sushi joints, the ambience is nothing to marvel at - it's simple, clean, and gets the job done. So, let's talk sushi...\n\nThe menu is totally standard, with some bento box lunch specials and your run-of-the-mill rolls. I always have to have my seaweed salad, so I was lured by the special Sanraku seaweed salad, claiming to have 3 different types of seaweed on a bed of greens. For $10, I had high hopes. Yes, it came with 3 types of seaweed, but in measly little portions; the majority of this pricey salad being lettuce, not seaweed. The dressing was more acidic than flavorful, and I couldn't wait for my sushi to arrive...this salad was just not cuttin' it. \n\nWe shared a few of the fancy rolls; you know, the ones that Americans order (with spicy mayo sauce and tempura fried this and that). They were mostly delicious, and definitely filled the sushi void. Service was sporadic (who exactly was our server? We weren't sure), and during the lunch rush that became a problem when we needed to jet back to the office for a meeting. Next time we'll tell them we're on a tight schedule, maybe that'll help.\n\nPricey sushi, considering the location.

The box also had some seaweed salad, pickled vegetables, a well assembled California roll,  and some chicken teriyaki.

Despite note being a local, they trusted me to find a place  (and I really wanted to make sure we could get a reservation because there was six of us).  Combining Open Table and Yelp I was able to find this spot and got a table at 7:15pm.  According to my SF friends, finding a reservation the same day in downtown SF on a Saturday is virtually impossible, so I was pleased I was able to accomplish this.  \n\nI am a lover of sushi and have had everything from low grade to high class sushi.  It always amuses me when people expect $$$$ quality sushi and only pay $$.  I felt this restaurant had a nice balance of good quality and good price.  \n\nWhen we were initially seated I pointed to the bottle of \"Cherry Blossom\" sake and told the waiter I would like to order a bottle.  He hesitated and told me \"the price on the menu is just for one glass.\"  I nodded and stated \"I am aware.\"  He then hesitated again and said \"the price for a bottle is a lot more,\" to which I responded \"I am certainly expecting that.\"  For the size of the bottle we got (and trust me it was HUGE..more than enough for all six of us to have 3-4 rounds) I expected to pay $150-$200 for the bottle.  Turns out to *only* be $130.  Very nice.  I guess the server is not used to people buying a whole bottle because no sooner did I order it we had a different server.  Oh well, his loss and her gain.\n\nOne of my friends and I ordered and shared the Fisherman's Miso.  Think miso soup meets chunks of fish meat and muscles.  Very tasty, but not for someone who doesn't like fish, because the broth was extremely fishy.  The fish still had bones inside, too so be careful when you eat it.\n\nThe rolls were delicious.  I personally ordered the Tiger roll, Spider roll, the 101 roll, and the San Francisco roll.  Everyone at the table ordered different things and everyone had nothing but positive things to say about what they ordered.  The use of perilla in the rolls made for a delicious change in what I am used to when I order standard rolls such as Tiger.  \n\nIf you are coming here with a party larger than five I highly recommend getting a reservation so they can be ready for you.

The menu is quite large, with a greatest hits parade of standard Japanese fare --\u00a0soba, udon, tonkatsu, all the well-known appetizers, nigiri, rolls, two kinds of kama (hamachi and salmon), and an extensive menu of fish specials. You would have to dine here about ten times, with friends, before you had the run of the menu. So far, everything in this year's visits has been hearty and satisfying --\u00a0the soup broth made of shrimp shells, nicely cooked (non-homemade) soba noodles, perfectly-done tempura with high quality shrimp and broccoli, that scourge of American tempura.\n\nPrice-wise, the sushi is more expensive than average ($26 or $32 for chirashi deluxe, I forget which), but everything else is a good value. Fortunately, the non-sushi dishes are all well made, so you can have a modest priced large meal here, and splurge with a few special sushi items if you wish.\n\nWith the City's most popular movie theater upstairs, it is a real treat to be able to have good sushi before or after your movie, and now that the park outside has such a fantastic free music and performance program, it makes it into a one-building date.", "author": "Gil S."}

I know that one must be prepared to shell out some extra dollars when one harbors a sushi obsession, but I feel like Sanraku squeezes that notion just a little bit too much. \n\nOn two occasions, myself and a coworker did not receive our orders until our other table mates were finished with their meals. I understand the lunch time rush more than most, but waiting for your meal (for approximately 15 minutes) while your table mates are chowing down is a little painful. Our server was aware of the wait, and I appreciate the attentiveness and the apologies, but when the server has to apologize multiple times.....cringing ensues. \n\nThe food is decent and fresh, the menu has a good selection, the environment is more than comfortable and convenient, but due to my previous service experiences, the seemingly heightened prices, and the lack of \"umph\" in the dishes, 3 stars I feel is fair. I'll come back, Sanraku, but probably when someone else is footing the bill.", "author": "Chelsea B."}

You never get attitude, you never get bait and switch deals like you do at other more recent Asian food establishments on Folsom and Third streets. Only solid service and a kind demeanor.\nWhile lunch is consistently able to serve the non adventurous and the adventurous, the happy hour delights have scaled back just a wee bit.

It was a busy Friday night so my food ended up sitting in the bag for 10 minutes before somebody had time to give it to me.\n\nThe sushi roll was rather tiny for $12 and full of mayo (yuck!) which the menu claims is \"miso sauce.\"  The chicken breast was more plentiful but quite dry and overcooked.  Highlights: the sparse veggies on the side (three pieces of carrot and a broccoli) were fairly moist and warm, and the bowl of brown rice was fresh, moist, and much better than what they put in the sushi.\n\nPerhaps I caught them at a bad time and/or made bad choices, but even if the food was prepared properly, it would be a pretty poor show for $30.  I saw some of their fancier sushi rolls at the tables and most were covered in mayonnaise.  Perhaps they have decent cuts of sashimi? Don't go here for teriyaki or maki rolls.\n\nI really hate to write a bad review, but there are just SOOO many better options nearby, and I really wish I had gone somewhere else.  For much cheaper and better (but still not great) maki rolls, try Tokyo Express across the street, or Sushi Boat a couple blocks north.  I've also had better (and cheaper) teriyaki at the fast-casual Mr Hana in the Westfield Mall across the street.

Therefore, this most recent visit affords me the opportunity to whip one up immediately.\n\nThis may make me sound odd, but I like the fact that when I walk into a sushi/Izakaya establishment, that the wait staff as well as the sushi chefs are speaking Nihongo.  Not to mention the place was packed with attendees from the conference, most still with their badges/lanyards slung around their necks.\n\nThe menu here is pretty standard, with typical entrees such as Tonkatsu and Udon, but we elected on several appetizers in addition to rolls:\n\nPoppo Yaki (grilled squid)\nGindara (Butter fish marinated in sakemiso marinade)\nKarage\nGyoza\nNegihama\nSpider Roll\nSF Roll\n\nThe Squid Yaki was so so......just a charred piece of rubber tire rounds.\n\nThe Gindara was amazing and natsukashii, as they state in Nihongo.  Remember that scene from Ratatouille where Anton Ego is whisked away to early childhood experience??  My grandmother use to grill this fish for me during my visits to Japan.....she would marinade the butter fish (so aptly named for it's flakey yet buttery texture....a bit more firm than salmon) in a mix of sake kasu and miso.\n\nThe Karage was mediocre as was the gyoza.  The negihama, I personally am not into plain plain rolls unless it was a nigiri.  But the Salmon/Avo roll was good.  The salmon was extremely fresh.\n\nWhen we rose to go, the sushi chefs spoke Nihongo to our party, although I think they felt the inclination to do so because of K.

This resto can be super crazy busy especially during convention time.  \n\nFavorite\nYou must try their Beef Teriyaki. Ask for extra BBQ sauce on the side to pour on the beef and let them sit, while you poked the beef with your chopsticks (it's okay to play with your food once a while). That's how I eat my teriyaki beef. That way, the meat will soak more sauce. I know, it's weird, but I just like it like that. I also love their steam carrots! Yum! maybe I'll make those tonight myself. \nTheir sake (salmon) sushi, salmon skin, CA roll were also tasty, sesame chicken - good, seaweed salad - good (tho I think the 3 different seaweed salad kinda overly priced for the tiny portion), and I missed their miso glazed mackerel/cod/sea bass (was in bento box), tonkatsu - good, Nabeyaki Udon - very good for the cold SF night (dinner menu, but you can asked for lunch too), yakizakana (super fresh!), \nThey don't give you soup for your bento if you order it to go. \n\nDislike\nmiso glazed salmon, salmon burger (gross!)\n\nIf you order their market price sushi, I always find they gave me generous portion. Love them for that! They also have Happy Hour. I forgot what I had last time, but I thought they were okay. I still prefer Beef Teriyaki tho. If you order combo like Beef Teriyaki and Tempura, you get less beef, but more variety (tempura and beef teriyaki). If you order just Beef Teriyaki, you get more beef. Their tempura is good too, but I'm just not a fan of fried stuff. \n\nAlways asked for what's in bento box for lunch.

It's not the cheapest place to get decent sushi but it is very yummy. I will be back in the future", "author": "Candice J."}

This was my go to place for lunch whenever I was at the Metreon checking out the no-it-is-history Sony store.  I would have the sushi and sushi rolls.  \n\nToday was the first Tuesday of the Month at many of the SF museums, including SF MOMA and the Contemporary Jewish Museum.  A new-found BFF and I finally had our get together to check out the Rineke Dijkstra and Mark Bradford exhibitions.  Both were very impressive.  We plan on coming back next month for a revisit.\n\nLunch was BFF's treat.  My BFF wanted to have lunch and was open to any suggestions I had.  We decided to go for inexpensive Japanese.  We were walked to see if Sanraku was still in business and Voila!  We had about a 10-15 minute wait.  It did not seem that long, we were almost seated immediately.  BFF had ordered the salmon teriyaki filet and I had the tempura lunch.  Both were worth the price and so delicious.  BFF offered part of her salmon filet and I let her take whatever she wanted of my tempura.  The tempura was quite delicious, four prawns and mixed veggie served with steamed rice.  I was quite impressed with the salmon teriyaki filet.  BFF also shared her salad with me, which was quite nice. I must have been really hungry, I ended up eating her rice too.  She did not want it.  And for dessert, we each had a scoop of green tea ice cream.  I was impressed with the color, it was green tea macha.  \n\nThe service was good, yet busy.  We came in-between the lunch rush, so it took a little while, not too long, to place our order.   The Computer Game Development Conference was taking place at the Moscone Center.  Our server and a manager checked in to see how we were doing.  Most of all, they kept my water glass filled.\n\nSanraku was still as good as I remembered in terms of food quality.  Still delightfully good and flavorful, great quality.  BFF was very happy with the choice that she wanted a business card on the way out to the Contemporary Jewish Museum.  She raved about the food to our server which was nice, she said that we would be back.  \n\nWe will be back, Sanraku.  It is so nice to be back at the Sanraku.  Kampai!", "author": "Chiara A."}

I ordered miso soup with clams (typical powdered dashi base type) and a horrible 3 seaweed salad which I believe they should take off their menu. Basically, its a regular salad with 3 dollops of plain unseasoned seaweed served with an oily, tasteless vinaigrette type dressing.\n\nI was disappointed Sanraku did not serve real wasabi with their sushi. I ordered the two spicy deep fried rolls (whose names I cannot recall) and those were delicious and I highly recommend them. \n\nI was waiting for the waitress to come by so I could order some green tea ice cream but either she went off shift or stopped serving me for other reasons. But a different waitress come by and dropped off my check with a small dish of fresh fruit. I gave her a dirty look until she figured out I wanted to order dessert. After getting my green tea ice cream, I waited around some more waiting for my check again. I was sitting directly behind the hostess desk and the place had 10 people max in it but still no one came.

I'll get into that in a mo) of raw fish, but in all seriousness, given San Francisco prices, Sanraku surprised the hell out of me in a really good way.\n\nThere were four places in the SOMA that made it onto our list of 'graced more than once' establishments during our stay in SF, just because they were so darn good. One was The Grove, another was Sentinel, thirdly there was Samovar and finally Sanraku. You just don't get sushi like this over the Atlantic. And about those prices, you really can get some great stuff for what seems like a bargain - particularly the combo dishes which include a selection of sushi and a main meal like salmon teriyaki alongside the ever faithful miso soup, which I must say is delicious.\n\nThe tuna just melts in the mouth, the colours are exceptional and I will take it as a personal offense if you don't order the spider roll when you're here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-12-23", "description": "First of all, I'd like to give some context to this situation. I am not the type of person to write a review, let alone critique any restaurant I go to, but I feel obligated to share such an unpleasant experience with fellow members of this community. I would also like to point out that this occurred while on a double date with one of my very close friends, celebrating her 20th birthday. \n\n*****\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the combination dinners (sashimi/salmon teriyaki, sashimi/chicken teriyaki), my friend's boyfriend ordered the sesame chicken, and my friend, the birthday girl (BG), had the most trouble ordering her meal. \n\nBG tried to order the sashimi deluxe and change all the fish into salmon, but the waitress said it couldn't be done since it was the chef's choice of fish (which was specified on the menu). My boyfriend then offered to ask the waitress to change his sashimi to all salmon for BG, but the waitress said, again, that the sashimi in the dinner combination is chef's choice as well. At this point, BG was unhappy, so she requested to talk with the manager.\n\nWhen the manager appeared, BG stated her issues with exchanging the sashimi for salmon under the dinner combination, which had no discretion to whether it was chef's choice or not. The manager also said that the sashimi is chef's choice and that it changes every night, so there was nothing they could do about it. She said that tonight's sashimi would be red tuna and white tuna, and that there could be no option in changing it to salmon. By now, BG was really frustrated, so we all decided to buy her three salmon sashimi platters just so we could appease her frustration.\n\nAfter 15-20 minutes, my boyfriend's and my sashimi come out and it turns out to be SALMON and white tuna. BG's salmon sashimi appears to be not fresh (probably frozen, then thawed), and we begin to believe that this was done on purpose after our multiple complaints. We request to speak with the manager yet again about the sashimi. \n\nThe manager arrives and we voice our problems and frustrations. She seems to misunderstand why we are upset and give us excuses, such as \"it's been a really busy night\" and \"there has been some miscommunication between us.\" The manager appeared to believe that we were upset about not being able to switch the sashimi from the dinner combination to all salmon, but in fact, we were upset because the waitress and manager had been so adamant about chef's choice being red/white tuna, and not being able to change it, but turned out to be salmon and white tuna (which seems like salmon could have been interchangeable with tuna). At the end of our conversation, she offered us a discount for the sashimi platters, but at that point, we had no regard for any discounts. Instead, we were quite appalled by the terrible service and management at this restaurant. I decided to tell her that this miscommunication wasn't between us and herself, but instead between her staff and herself.\n\nBoth the waitress and manager tried to appease our frustration by sending a fruit platter and ice cream for BG, but it failed since BG was deathly allergic to the fruit on the fruit platter (not the restaurant's fault, but this didn't help BG's frustration at all). In the end, we left less than a $5 tip for a meal that cost over $70 and BG left crying in frustration with how terrible the service and management was. \n\nHonestly, I can go on and on about this... but the main point is that customers are ALWAYS correct, and if you've ever worked at this type of business, you will understand that as an employee at a restaurant, you have to swallow your pride and just admit you are wrong, even if you believe the customer is wrong. \n\n*****\n\nIn summary, reasons why this was one of the most unpleasant experiences I've ever had eating out:\n\n1. Waitress/Manager were being extremely difficult about changing tuna into salmon sashimi for dinner combination (They were convinced, and wrong, that the sashimi was chef's choice, red/white tuna, and that it could not be changed)\n2. Service was FAR below par - failed to bring out salads/soups in a timely manner, didn't refill empty water cups AFTER refilling other cups, brought out saucers for half the table instead of everyone, etc.\n3. Management has internal problems - miscommunication with the waitress/manager and chef, manager could not satisfy customer (birthday girl) after speaking with manager multiple times, manager chose to NOT say good-bye to us after watching us leave the restaurant, etc.\n\nIn short, DO NOT COME TO THIS SANRAKU if you do not want to deal with this BS!!!

Fresh Yellowtail with thinly-sliced cucumber and crunchy sweet red onion with shiso leaf and yuzu soy.  So light on the palette, it's like enjoying a spring salad.\n\nTheir huge amaebi morsels are succulent and sweet.  Then you're served with its nice contrast when those shrimp heads are deep fried in a light batter to perfection.  You eat it all.  All of it in about two bites.  Believe me; it's pretty yummy.\n\nThe toro literally melts in your mouth.  Order it.  Market price.  So good; so fresh.  I literally feel it nourishing and energizing my brain cells soon after I put it in my mouth.\n\nThe prices border on the high end, but I wouldn't pay any much less for raw sashimi served well.  The ambience is clean, spacious, and quiet enough for good casual conversation.  Sushi portions are good; combination portions are huge.\n\nOne might be turned off by the fact that it's located inside the SF Metreon mall, but one wouldn't even know it once you're inside.  Service staff is very attentive, but the focus is on the amazing food.  I'd bring out-of-towners to enjoy good Japanese fare here.", "author": "Frankie D."}

I love sushi with a fiery passion and hadn't eaten it in awhile. \n\nFirst, we got sorta lost looking for the place. After going up a few floors in the Metreon, then going outside, and passing the door, we found it. The door is a bit inconspicuous and doesn't quite look like the entrance to anything. And the restaurant is oddly shaped, as other Yelpers have mentioned; it's long and skinny. \n\nAs soon as we got there and greeted the group, rounds of hot sake were ordered and promptly downed. And after a few cups, I realized the BF and I hadn't eaten anything! We finished off the rest of the appetizers (gyoza and some random rolls), then we all ordered our dinners. \n\nThe BF and I shared the sashimi salad deluxe (such delicious fresh fish with a great ginger vinaigrette), the rock 'n roll (eel & avocado roll, which was good, but the brown eel sauce covered up the eel), and some miso soup (decent, but not very hot). And he ordered some nigiri, which was good, even though I can't recall what fish it was. \n\nThe rest of the group ordered the dinner specials, which included teriyaki of some type (salmon, beef, etc) with rice and steamed veggies, sushi (sashimi or CA roll), and miso soup. I heard no complaints from them, and they cleaned off their plates, so I assume it was good!\n\nAnd the hot sake. We managed to finished off 13 rounds of hot sake between 4 of us (2 of the girls stopped at 1 cup, which is less than half a round). And we tried some nigori (unfiltered) sake, which I prefer, and the boys have sake bombs. \n\nOur waiter, Jin, looked a bit bored. Or lifeless, but he took care of us and our wild sake-downing mess. And I managed to crack a smile out of him when I asked him for water refills. Cuz our sake-loving friends surely needed some more water ;)\n\nOH, and it was HAPPY HOUR before 7, so that's why the guys ordered hot sake like crazy people! Needless to say, our pre-gaming dinner was a blast.", "author": "Christine G."}

Right when we were seated, however, we were told immediately that any sushi orders would take extra long tonight. I found this odd, since the restaurant seemed fairly busy, but not over capacity. \n\nWe ordered the gyoza, which was good; I had the chirashi bowl with a side of uni nigiri, my friend ordered the sesame chicken/shrimp tempura dinner combo. I will say that the portions were fairly large for the price (especially the dinner combo), so this seemed like a good deal at first. However, I was very disappointed in the consistency of the fish quality. The chirashi bowl is essentially a bowl of sushi rice covered with various sashimi pieces, and most pieces were fairly fresh. \n\nThe uni had a skunky, sour taste to it. Just terrible; I was pretty bummed since I had ordered the extra side of uni nigiri (for $12, no less) based upon other reviews saying this place had legitimate fresh fish. This was certainly not the case for the uni. Most other pieces were fairly good (salmon, tuna) but there were a couple of other pieces in my chirashi that were also not so fresh. \n\nService was at best just OK throughout dinner, but as we were finishing up the last of our drinks the waitress came by and said we needed to leave because they needed our table. We looked around, and there were THREE other tables that were completely open. Really? We left quite annoyed. \n\nA truly mediocre and inconsistent dining experience.", "author": "Natalie N."}

First of all, 6 pieces of a California rolls in a \"deluxe platter\" should already tell you that this is not going to be worth $29. The fish was tender, but some had two pieces (e.g., sashimi), others had one (e.g., unagi). It just looked like a very average and random assortment. The wasabi is also not that potent.

Accessible bathrooms located in the Metreon. \n\nSanraku has other locations, but this one is closest to me. While the Metreon is more than a bit dismal these days, Sanraku is a bright and pleasant spot despite it all, hidden from most of the mall and facing Yerba Buena's gardens. It's too small for groups, but there's usually seating at both the sushi bar and tables. \n\nA real standout is their happy hour; 3-7 M-F (and maybe weekends) for drink specials, a wide variety of sake, and little plates of food, tapas-size. These include salads and tofu, half-size rolls, and a good variety of nibbly bits you can easily make a meal out of for quite cheap. My partner hits their happy hour regularly enough to keep us in constant coupons - they have a frequent-diner program that keeps him in maintenance sushi. Equally important, the service is always great, cheerful attentive waitstaff and consistently tasty food. The full dinner menu is also tasty, with enough options to feed vegetarians and people who won't eat that weird raw fish stuff, as well as lots of the usual rolls and entrees. \n\nAllergy note: if you're one of the other three people who (like me) are allergic to seaweed, this Sanraku sometimes has soy paper available and will make you custom rolls that won't make you choke. I am shy and only ask for this once in a while when they aren't busy, but it's very nice to have that option. \n\nIf you need food on either side of a movie, a happy hour meetup after work, or are looking for a place to take a bunch of conference-goers that won't break your budget or your spirit, Sanraku is a great choice. I hope they stick around as Target moves in upstairs and heaven knows what else happens to the Metreon; they've survived a lot of changes, and they deserve to stick around.", "author": "Anne K."}

In fact, I think just yesterday that I enjoyed perhaps my best meal yet at their restaurant.  \n\nA quick note about my sushi tastes- I prefer nigiri- and usually don't order any rolls, or even look on the menu for them.  I am more interested in trying new and different types (species) of fish than I am in trying different types of creative rolls.  So my user reviews will reflect that.  Anyways, after a movie at the Metreon, we sat at the sushi bar and pummeled about 35+ pieces of nigiri.  Chu-toro- excellent.  Zuke-maguro- excellent. Hamachi belly- excellent. Anago- excellent.  Kanpachi- excellent.  Katsuo- excellent.  We did order the spicy tuna roll and that was tasty as well.  Everything was excellent, tasted very fresh, and was reasonably priced to my expectations- though not cheap- three of us splurged for a $160 bill before tip (no alcohol).  But such are the terms I am accustomed to with my sushi habit.... I enjoyed the great variety of fish they had- perhaps 20+ different options, and they have a fairly extensive non-sushi menu as well for those interested in different options.\n\nPlease note that they have a new 'main' entrance from the exterior of the Metreon building due to the renovation currently going on.  I am used to entering from the interior, however that has been cut-off, and now you must enter from the exterior by the Yerba Buena Gardens.  I was a bit confused about how to find my way in at first, and I hope this has not injured their business.  \n\nAnyways, this place is super convenient and provides sushi of excellent quality.  While I wouldn't classify it as a 'destination' sushi restaurant that I would specifically go to for a dinner/lunch etc, I will consistently patronize them if I am in the area shopping, for a movie, etc. Compares favorably to places such as Ten Ichi on Fillmore or Sushi Bistro.", "author": "Andy S."}

They had their daily lunch special on display (a bento box with tempura, vegetables, gyoza, rice, cold seaweed salad, california roll, miso soup, and rice) so we both ordered it.\n\nThe tempura was fine: nice and crispy. The California roll was warm, so that was a bit off-putting, and it ended up tasting pretty bland. The gyozas didn't really stand out either, in terms of flavor. The cold seaweed salad was the lone stand out of this dish, and even then, the portion was so small it really didn't compensate for everything else. \n\nI'm sure if we tried the actual sushi rolls instead of the bento box, we'd have a different experience, but stay away from the lunch special.", "author": "Joveth G."}

The Salad has interesting additions to it that I picked out and ate, but ended up sacrificing the rest of it to save room for all that Sushi!

Try Tokyo Express across the street (believe it or not, for a fast food sushi place -- better service, better food -- compare the Yelp reviews side by side, you will see that Tokyo Express has far fewer negative reviews).  \n\nI had the same experience as a bunch of other Yelp reviewers here.  I have eaten at tens of sushi restaurants in SF, and this has got to be the worst in terms of service with only so so food.  \n\nFirst, the service.  The service is simply impolite, even if you're somewhat a regular.  The front desk manager treats you as if she were doing a favor to seat you or to talk to you about anything.  She is not the GM of the place, but the GM should probably consider replacing her.  Her attitude is distasteful.  Apparently I'm not the other one to notice it (See Daniel Y's review).  The string of negative reviews about this place is telling. \n\nThe food is just so so.  Not great, not really terrible.  \n\nBut why would you subject yourself to this?  Go eat elsewhere.\n\np.s. Hiro, it looks like you read the reviews here.  Haven't you read enough of the complaints about your staff to know that they need to be re-trained, and some of them need to be replaced?

So really, you know it's probably going to be a good experience by comparison.  But it really is such a solid place that I'm very happy to have it in my lunchtime restaurant repertoire.\n\nThe layout of the restaurant is a bit odd - very thin and long, even more so than most others in San Francisco, the land of long, thin restaurants.  It can feel a little cramped because of this, but there's some pretty good seating in back.  We can usually squish in a party of 8 or so, and once the unpleasant business of rearranging the chairs and getting ourselves into our seats is done, it actually doesn't feel that squished!\n\nIt has been said before, but I'll say it again.  Even though it's tacked onto the Metreon and the decor is kind of standardly, facelessly Japanese, the food is really quite good.  The fish is fresh, the miso is warm and salty, and neither I nor my coworkers have ever had a bad dish, to the best of my knowledge.  The menu isn't that inventive, but it has all your favorites - soba, tempura, California roll and all - prepared very nicely.  They get a bit more creative with their special rolls, of course, and I even ordered the chef's pick sushi lunch last time and got something that (I think) contained squid, tobiko, and a hot sauce, that was surprising and tasty.  No, not surprisingly tasty, I was pretty sure I would like it.\n\nIn San Francisco, which is also the land of a billion sushi restaurants, you might not feel compelled to go out of your way to eat at Sanraku.  But if you happen to be in the area and are looking for a sizeable, reasonably-priced lunch comprised of standard Japanese fare, by golly, Sanraku might just be your place!", "author": "Becca S."}

Ordered the American Dream roll for $20, 5 pieces came out with assorted tobiko on top, tamago which I despise, and gold leaf.  I mean really, is it really necessary to have gold leaf on a sushi roll?  The roll had a little too much off every ingredient: salmon, yellow tail, shrimp, asparagus, avocado, chives, soy paper, and seaweed.  Very little flavor, and certainly not worth the price tag.  Service was not accommodating: water was not refilled, and would not let us substitute tuna sashimi for salmon.  Also ordered the spicy tofu dish, which I could have put together at home, 4 cubes of uncooked silken tofu, a few raw broccoli florets, green beans, mung bean sprouts, and carrots drenched in Chinese chili paste oil.  Terrible.  My only solace was that the ingredients were fresh.", "author": "Cynthia C."}

This place was a reasonable walking distance from my downtown hotel, so I decided to try it out.  Plus, it was during happy hour.  Always a win, right?\n\nAnyhow, sat down at the sushi bar, which was manned by actual Japanese sushi chefs (always a good sign).  Was given the HH menu, and ordered the Eskimo Roll, Philly Roll, and Spicy Tuna.  Of course, their HH menu rolls only come in pieces of 3, so you had to order 2.  Most HH rolls were $3.50 each.  Okay.  Reasonable.  Couple that with $3 Sapporo and I'm good.\n\nThen I took a look at the regular menu and compared it to the HH menu.  The regular menu has their rolls (same ones, mind you) of 6 pieces, for $6.50.  Hmmmmmm.  2 HH rolls for $7.00 or 1 regular menu roll for $6.50?  Shady?\n\nI brought this to the attention of the server whose response was, \"We get that a lot.\"\n\nSomething tells me if I had not said anything, I would have gotten the $0.50 shaft.\n\nAnyway.

It is by SOMA in the Metreon and Sanraku did not disappoint! Wonderful Unagi and had a Tempura Udon. The broth was amazing. I only wish I had a larger stomach as I would have ordered a bunch of goodies. \nDownside, I did notice they do not offer a large varied selection of fish. They offer a bunch of sushi rolls, etc. But for someone who eats Sashimi, I want to see White Tuna and some other delectables on there. However, they did offer the roasted/grilled collar of Hamachi that I now wish I had ordered to go to eat later while waiting for my flight home.", "author": "LisaLisa F."}

I blame it on my pro-Paul Rudd bias.\n\nThe sushi I had here was fine.  Not bad, but not anything special.  Quality-wise I'd compare it to a place like Kobeya in San Mateo: The quality is decent and the food has a home-cooked yet well-executed vibe.\n\nThe problem?  Waaaaaay overpriced.  For three small lunches my table paid $24/person after tax and tip.  That's what you get for getting sushi this close to Market and Union.\n\nTo sum up, Sanraku falls under the growing list of restaurants that I would never visit on my own but would not strongly object to visiting if friends took me there.

ON THE TABLE. HIDING UNDER MY BOWL. WAVING IT'S ANTENNAE AT ME. \"HELLO, JEN!\"\n\nOkay. Rewind a few weeks. I'm visiting Leslie in the city, and we're going to see (500) Days of Summer at the Metreon and want to grab a bite to eat beforehand; I've been craving sashimi for days and days, so despite misgivings about Sanraku (the only previous time I'd been, someone stole my sister's purse. That's right, woman with the red purse who \"stumbled\" into my sister's chair and walked off with her bag - we remember! *shakes fist* you suck!), that's where we opt to go. We go in and are promptly seated against the window and greeted by a frankly sullen server. Fast-forward 20 or so minutes, and sullenness aside, we're enjoying our fairly tasty if standard Japanese mall-food, when I catch a glimpse of too many legs out of the corner of my eye.\n\nI just barely see a couple legs disappearing below the table, so I scoot my chair back a bit, saying \"Bug? I think I saw a bug? Or I'm hallucinating?\" and stick my head down (SPOILER ALERT: in  the alternate ending, this is where I get my head crunched off in a frenzy of blood, screaming, and maniacally waving feelers) but I can't see it anywhere, so I crane forward just a little more... Which is when Leslie's chair screeches backwards and she jumps up and says \"Jen, Jen, it's on the table!\" ON THE TABLE NEXT TO MY FACE. So I jump up, and by this time, our diffident server and some other guy have come up and are making \"Hmm.\" faces at us.. The cockroach skitters around on the table for a few minutes and then decides to hide under my bowl, antennae waving furiously. Leslie and I back away from the table, and our server steps gingerly forward with a napkin, picks up the cockroach...and promptly drops it. It skitters to the wall, thinks for a second, and hies itself back to the dark corner from whence it came...under somebody else's table. (Where, to my knowledge, it rests to this very day, as the people at that table were enjoying a rather large sake and very tiny food and subsequently didn't notice any of our \"Oh my god bug!\" exclamations.)\n\nAt this point, Leslie and I have no further interest in eating, and we ask for a discount on our meal, at which point, after much server-hostess conferring and calling of the manager (who says, in response to the hostess' \"What should we do?\": \"Nothing!\"), we are given a whopping 10% off. We pay, shuddering and clutching at each other all the while, and flee. We confer in the lobby of the Metreon for a few minutes and decide that we shouldn't have paid at all, and return to the hostess' desk, whereupon she says \"Oh good, I was thinking you should probably get a little bit more off..\" So she gives us another 30% off, takes down Leslie's phone number, and promises that the company will call her tomorrow. WHICH THEY NEVER DO. Then we go upstairs to wait for the movie, call everyone we have ever met, and are comforted by the sweet sweater-vest stylings of one Mr. Joseph Gordon-Levitt.\n\nFIN.\n\nI generally am pretty easygoing when it comes to food; I've done my time in food service and am about to return to it; I recognize that bugs are usually all over the damn place and when I go out to eat I just pretend I don't know that. But it is one thing to know that there's probably cockroaches and a couple mice in the kitchen, and another for those (HUGE, SO HUGE) cockroaches to be so comfortable around people that THEY CRAWL UP ON YOUR TABLE TO SAY HI AND COMPLETELY SPOIL YOUR MAGURO SASHIMI. I really wish I'd had the presence of mind to yank out my camera and take a picture, because I'm not kidding when I say that it was 3 inches long, NOT COUNTING THE ANTENNAE. ugh.\n\nMoral of the story: Whatever, bugs happen, but for God's sake, the management should have comped our meal and fallen all over themselves apologizing (or at least apologized once! Just once!). It was gross - and if you watch too many Sci-Fi Movies of the Week, like I do - downright terrifying!\n\n(I really want to watch Mimic now, though. Hmm.)", "author": "Jennifer R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-28", "description": "I've eaten at Sanraku nearly half a dozen times, but for only one reason: it's near where I needed to be at the time.  The movie theater upstairs, the convention center next door.  But because I never seek out Sanraku, I can't recommend it for more than two stars.  I'll comment specifically on the sushi bar; I've never eaten from their kitchen.\n\nI guess if you like a lot of rolls smeared with overwhelming sauces, you won't notice that the fish is meh.  It's like the good sushi joints got all the best fish, and Sanraku settled for the rest.  The kanpachi, hamachi toro, uni, ikura, and tai were all unremarkable, but still good enough to eat.  The fish tasted as if it had been refrigerating for about three days -- perfectly safe, but the tissue was not at its prime.  The chu-toro stood out as the only thing that was delicious.\n\nUnfortunately, they give you only two pieces of fish when you order it as sashimi, compared to most other places, which price their sashimi differently and give you 4 to 6 slices!  Because of this odd choice, fish, when presented on a plate, feel anemic, like afterthoughts instead of bursts of fleshy color suggestive of the satisfying mouthfuls to follow.  If you appreciate good knife skills, Sanraku's friendly if unengaging sushi chefs don't.  All 8 of my dinky sashimi pieces looked as if they'd been cut by half as many different chefs.\n\nService, when it's busy, can be slow.  Like Blowfish, the wait staff are more in the way than useful (remember, you're at a sushi BAR -- what do you need a waiter for?), particularly if you've been spoiled elsewhere by a personable, chatty itamae with whom you have direct and constant contact.\n\nOverall, it's just slightly better than mall sushi.", "author": "Andrew L."}

Man, though, four bucks for a half cup of Costco lookin' seaweed salad?  Come on!  Not only that, but one of the \"specials\" consists of 6 nigiri and 6 California rolls.... for $18.  What was I thinking??  Oh yeah, it was actually *cheaper* that way.  Whiskey tango foxtrot!\n\nTo add insult to injury, the raw fish nigiri had wasabi spread underneath the pieces of fish (when was the last time that was an acceptable norm??),  the yellowtail was all pulled apart and ugly, the salmon looked a bit off-color on the corners, and the California rolls looked like they came from Safeway.  The vegetarian \"special\" platter was halfway decent, at least, and I must say the eggplant nigiri was rather heavenly.  That was the only thing that impressed me.  Period.\n\nThis is not as I remembered my last trip here!  That was back when I was naive and silly and preferred hot sake to the cold unfiltered...  tisk tisk tisk.  At least the gyoza were somewhat decent.  I came here for sushi, though, dammit, not glorified greasy dumplings.\n\nThe waiter was probably sufficiently embarrassed, and that somehow translated to some dire inattentiveness, I think: he sheepishly realized that he didn't replace our napkins that were used in the cleanup effort for the spilled water, and once our water needed refilling, he had to be flagged down.  He was good about it thereafter, I'll give him that.  This was on top of neglecting to take our order when we were obviously ready (remember, menus closed), however, and he all but disappeared when the time for the check came and went-- I had to go to the counter to request it and after it was brought to our table, I had to take it back to the counter to pay it.  I know you're ashamed, sweetie, but come on, we still exist!  Maybe he was just overworked.  Who knows...  I feel for the poor soul, yet my dissatisfaction unfortunately reigned supreme over my compassion.  That's just the bare truth.\n\nThe last time I was here, I don't remember it being this overpriced (including the unfiltered sake-- $18 for a lackluster bottle!!) or this bad-- and I could have handled the expense if it weren't for the lack of quality.  Next time, I'll pack my dinner or dine elsewhere when I go to the Metreon for my IMAX experience.\n\nAt least THAT (300) was freaking awesome.  My bootlegged Sparks helped.  Maybe I'm snobbier than I used to be, but damn, this just was not a good experience.\n\nThank you.", "author": "Melanee N."}

Located in the Metreon, the atmosphere is nothing special, but I thought the food, all in all, was pretty good, if a little on the pricey side. They do have an excellent list of top quality sakes, which is always nice, served cold, and generously so, in a masu (a traditional wooden box-shaped cup) in a saucer. They overpour the masu until the saucer is about half-filled; when you've drunk enough to make room in the masu, you can pour what's in the saucer in there.\n\nThe first evening, I had the sunomono, a salad, and nabeyaki soba, which was pleasant enough, but not as good as what you can get at Seto in Sunnyvale, for instance. The sunomono was good, the salad's nothing special, I'd give it a miss. The Akitabare sake was excellent.\n\nThe second evening, a friend who was after Japanese food and I went back and sat at the sushi bar. I had clam misoshiru, tuna zake (maguro marinated in jalapeno-laced sauce, with diced jalapeno bits on it), hotate (Hokkaido scallops), negihamachimaki (yellowtail and scallions roll), and hirame (halibut). These were all excellent, although the maguro gets lost in the jalapeno with the tuna zake. My friend had a set meal with misoshiru, assorted sashimi, and tempura, and reported it to be very good. We both had the Onogoroshi sake--they were sadly out of the Onogoroshi Ginjyo.\n\nService was fine and friendly, I chatted with the itamae in Japanese, I'd go back.", "author": "David S."}

Just a tad bit pricy for Lunch that didnt come with salad.  \n\nYesterday, we happened to stumble in after shop'n at the Sony Playstation store because we were both hungry.  We looked around & saw this restaurant.  The menu was posted outside the entrance so we peeked in to see if it was crowded, but it wasn't.  As soon as we got in, we were seated.  Few minutes later, the waiter asked if we wanted something to drink before we ordered.  Of course, My Xo & I usually have to order the tea.  When the waiter came back, we were expecting a kettle of tea.  Instead, we got 1 cup each.  Anyhow, we ordered the spicy hamachi & the philly for appetizers, I ordered the vegetable tempura (alot of veggies) & my Xo ordered the chicken donburi (didn't come with egg, just grilled veggies).  Our orders came with the miso soup.  During the middle of eating, our tea kept running out, so we had to flag the waiter.  He came out with a kettle of tea to which we thought he was going to leave the kettle so he wouldnt have to go back & forth to serve us the tea.  Obviously NOT!  Everytime we finished our tea, we had to flag him down.  The host kept checking up on us & served us more of the tea than our waiter.  Maybe our waiter got tired of pouring tea for us??  *shrugs*", "author": "XoXo X."}

It is so good -- chock full of raw fish, you name it, maguro, hamachi, uni, LOTS of salmon roe and tobiko over spring green mix.  I don't like to fill up on rice so this meal is perfect.  I've been to Sanraku a couple of times and my favorite is still the sashimi salad.  Their fish is sooo fresh and excellent quality -- melts in your mouth, really.   I recommend this place.  The only drawback is it's not the best atmosphere (located in the Metreon complex) -- it is a bit noisy and very bright lights and a pretty small space.

I also enjoyed the tekka maki roll (my favorite roll to order). Bigger and fresher than some I've tasted, meaning: I usually get ones that are pretty small and the tuna inside looks less than the dark shade it's supposed to be. All this at the Metreon ...

He ordered the teriyaki beef, and I ordered the garlic butter beef. He even tried the sashimi. The beef were so tenderly done and tasty, and the sashimi definitely were definitely fresh. Surprisingly the garlic butter beef did not have the greasy feel to it despite its name! We went back again for lunch the next day, and tried other sashimi/sushi and teriyaki salmon. The salmon is crispy outside and tender inside. Very tasty and well cooked. The best thing was - my father had no stomach upsets after both meals!
