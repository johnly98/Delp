I ordered the mixed grill vegetable burrito with guacamole. The burrito says $8.65 on the menu and .75 for the guacamole. They charged me $12 claiming that I got the super burrito and their reasoning was because I got \"extra\" salsa and lettuce which is an extra charge. I'm never coming back to this bogus taqueria again. This establishment is scamming people. If you go to this place, CHECK YOUR RECEIPT.\n\n*update* \nI went back 10 min later and asked to speak to the owner which was Christina. Christina was the person that rung up my order initially and I asked her to explain the extra charges. She had some trouble explaining it and gave me $2 cash back. I initially refused the $2 and told her that's not the reason I came back. I explained that she is scamming people for extra charges and it's unacceptable.

There is not much difference in size for a regular burrito as opposed to a super burrito.  Sure, they give you more ingredients in the super but you seemingly get less of each ingredient so the burrito comes out to be the same size yet you are paying more.\n\nI order the same things with each visit.  My usual is a regular burrito with the tomatillo chicken which I just refer to as \"green chicken\", black beans and spicy salsa.  I like the green chicken.  It's all chicken breast meat and often in huge chunks but it has good flavor in it and it's fairly moist.  For a change of pace I'll order the prawn burrito, but that just means having to wait longer as the prawns are cooked to order.\n\nTheir carnitas are decent, but I've never taken a liking to any of their preparations of beef as I've found their beef to be too dry, too bland, too grisly or a combination of all of that.\n\nThe staff is very nice too.

Given the somewhat isolated area; Design District, they're the go-to place for Mexican as there aren't competitors for blocks (even miles) around.  As with any ethnic restaurant, the farther out in the City you drift, the higher the prices.  A regular burrito here costs upwards to $8+.  Add a drink and say goodbye to $10+.\n\nOne time, I came in here to order my usual: veggie burrito.  On the wall menu itself, the ingredients are etched plainly and simply in black text.  I tell the line cook I want \"...everything except sour cream.\"  \"Everything\" includes lettuce and other standard burrito items.  Dumb line cook kept bickering with me, insisting that lettuce is extra and  I had to pay for it.  Short of any changes on their menu and having been there just last week, I don't see how this could be.  I eventually pointed to the menu itself.  Her response \"Oh!  Ok.\"  REALLY?!?!?!  She then adds on, \"Next time, just tell me.\"  WTF?!?! Is this your first day?!?!\n\nI moved along the line to the register and told the Cashier (maybe manager) about the gripe I was subjected to.  She snarls the same: \"Next time just tell them!\"  WHAT THE HELL IS SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT \"Everything except sour cream\" ?!?!?!  Do they need reminders about their own products and the composition thereof?!?!?!  I wasn't having this.  I politely said 'No thanks.' when it came time to pay and walked out.", "author": "Honest J."}

(not when a great taco is available right down the street at the best buy taco truck for less than $2). So I settled on a regular (verde) chicken burrito. Still expensive for what you get though. \n\nAs I sat down at the park and bit into my burrito, I was happy. It tasted pretty good. The rice, whole beans, fresh salsa and chicken had a good blend of flavor. Not too heavy but still flavorful. The chicken was a tad overcooked (a little dry) but still ok. Both my son and wife keep coming over to steal bites from my burrito, so I guess it passed our family's taste test. \n\nOverall a decent place and will be back if I don't feel like driving to the mission.

The tacos were served on mini soft corn tortillas and packed with your choice of several chicken, beef and pork preparations, all of which looked yummy.   We chose Pastor, Steak, & green pollo.

Think... Ninja Turtles Green.  It even smelled like plastic but tasted like a regular tortilla.  I honestly think all they did was add food coloring to the dough.\n\n- Their baby burrito was so dry.  Their menu described their baby burritos as a super burrito, just smaller, but there was hardly anything \"super\" about it.  Skimpy on everything except the rice hence the dryness.\n\n- Veggie nachos was super disappointing.  A lot of guac, a lot of sour cream, although they were not layered on top of each other but in separate sections of the container.  Meaning, I had a bunch of chips doused in just sour cream, a bunch doused in guac, a bunch doused in just refried beans--you get what I mean.  It was not pretty nor did it taste like anything I was craving.\n\n- I ordered over the phone so that I could skip the long line.  I ended up still having to stand in the long line just to get into the place since they have no system setup for easy \"to-go-pick-up\" orders.  Once I got in, the lady at the counter was no help what so ever.  She left me standng there looking like an idiot until I spoke up and said, \"Hi, I ordered over the phone.\"  And I don't know why but the customers that were there are some of the rudest people ever!  I know that it's lunch time and you're hungry but you don't have to act like a bunch of a55es.  They just kept mugging at me as if I was \"cutting\" them but what the hell is the point of ordering over the phone if I can't just come in and pay for my already prepped food which was sitting on the counter and getting cold and just get out of there already?  And as we were leaving, they refused to part out of the way until we squeezed through--R-U-D-E!!!\n\nThe only plus side to this experience is that I found out gourmet food trucks make regular rounds right in font of the Gift Center next door so the next time I even step close to Dos Amigos is because I'm stuck standing in a food truck line that's worth waiting for!", "author": "Ivy Z."}

The prawns are...delicious.\n\nWhile Dos Amigos is not stellar, neither are they sub-par. Don't fear to tread into this hole-in-the-lengthy-wall because you will not be disappointed.\n\n*I recommend the refried beans, the tomatillo sauce, Carnitas (burrito, Taco Salad), Chili Verde (burrito) and Prawns (Quesadilla).", "author": "Rey T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-08-02", "description": "The past month marked the grand opening of Dos Amigos Taqueria just around the corner from my building.  This was a heavily anticipated opening, as tacos are right in my lunchtime wheelhouse, and the bare rudeness of my current options leads me to fantasize over any newcomers to the scene.\n\nUnfortunately, Dos Amigos underwhelmed in nearly every regard.  Let's start with pricing:\n\nAt $2.85 per taco, this is the most expensive taco option within my lunch radius and perhaps within all of San Francisco proper.  The pricing scheme leaves the consumer in stuck between two less-than-ideal lunching nodes:  Do I go for a reasonably-priced yet less-than-fulfilling deuce-taco combo?  Or do I buy the third, ensuring fullness (likely even stuffedness), but launching the lunch price tag into the $9 range pre-drink?  Neither option is a catastrophe, yet neither is anywhere near ideal.\n\nTortillas:  Plus points for white corn, minus points for steaming instead of quick frying.  A steamed taco tortilla is a recipe for a mess -- the tortilla must act as a meat hammock of sorts, and steaming lends to the burstability of this support system.  Steam my flour tortillas for my burritos, but do NOT steam my tacotillas.\n\nMeat contents: The options were standard (Carne Asada, Chicken, and Al Pastor) -- but the meats were sitting in BINS getting COLD.  Taco meat should come straight off the frying surface and into the taco without passing GO or collecting $200.\n\nCheese:  I had to shout in order to keep cheese off of my taco.  They were forcibly placing cheese on tacos.  This is an offense against all tacos everywhere.\n\nSalsas: Lacked punch AND pizazz.  Did not lack water.  Soaked through the tortillas almost instantaneously.  The resulting meal was more like a taco salad that I would NEVER have ordered in the first place.\n\nI thought I was about to make Dos new Amigos.   What a bummer.", "author": "Ben A."}

Just finished up my super carne asada burrito and though I'm about to go into a food coma, I find myself wishing I would've gone to Dos Pinas instead, or better yet, Luna. The reason I even bother giving it a chance is due to the convenience of the location. What's not to like? Alright, let's get started.\n\nThe service is piss poor. Somebody please teach these ladies how to smile. A lesson in paying attention would also help. On both occasions I've been here, they've screwed up our order. This should be pretty elementary stuff, really. I mean, I'm there the whole time, picking out beans as they are making my food. But as you're getting excited about that sour cream and guac getting thrown into the mix, your super burrito is suddenly demoted to a regular and rolled up without the crucial aforementioned ingredients. After correcting an order, whomever screwed up will look at you and infallibly go \"Oh, you didn't order that.\"\n\nService aside, let's talk about the food, which is mediocre at best. As someone already mentioned, this is a lazy taqueria where everything is in bins from which you make your picks, rather than freshly cooked up on the stove. This doesn't necessarily have to be so bad, but the least you could expect is that the binned meats are of good quality. Let's just say I had to pick out two pieces of unchewable fat out of today's carne asada burrito. What's worse, the super nachos were carelessly thrown together and shoved into a microwave to be transformed into a nasty, soggy mess.

I had a bit of the diced chicken which they allowed me to try before choosing my meat for my super burrito. It was tasty and tender!
