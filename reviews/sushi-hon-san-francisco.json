I had an amazing omakase experience here.\n\nHad a reservation at 7:00PM, greeted my the entire staff when we walked in and seated immediately. \n1. Omakase $79/person was good! \n-Our starter was cooked octopus with bbq seasoning (tasted like chai siu but on octopus). \n-My favorite piece was the fish skin mixed nigiri piece because it was very unique and flavorful. 2nd favorite was the crab nigiri, extremely fresh! \n-Fried uni tempura was a bit different, didn't taste like uni anymore, felt like eating batter with a hint of mint, a bit disappointed with this dish \n\n2. Supplement: $39/person was definitely worth getting!\n-Monk fish liver, this was sooo good! So soft and savory. \n-additional 4 piece nigiri: 1. medium fatty toro tuna (i usually do not like the super fatty) 2. Uni (YES much better than the fried uni). 3. Salmon roe 4. Scallop (soo tender with a hint of sweetness) \n\n3. Wagyu beef- too fatty and chewy\n\n4. Sake pairing $45/person must get if you plan to drink sake anyways. Comes with 5 generously poured tastings. Champagne, 3 sakes, and a dinner sake that went very well with the match pudding dessert. \n\nOverall, 5 stars because of the extraordinary service.

The rest of the omakase was very good, but not as memorable. For example, tempura uni in a shiso leaf; when you fry such a delicate flavor, all you taste is tempura. It looks cool, but it's kind of a waste, and doesn't do anything to highlight the uni.\n\nOverall, I will absolutely return for the chef's choice nigiri, many times over.", "author": "Ryan W."}

Service is polite and friendly but with a reserved Japanese feel.\n\nWe went for the exclusive omakase and they kindly asked if there were any foods we would prefer not to eat. The food came out at a good pace, and it was fun to sit at the bar and watch the chef make our food. Everything was really delicious and fresh. The fish was very clean with great texture.\n\nWe also had the sake pairings.

He didn't keep his words for long... \n\nThe restaurant itself is not very big, sits about 40-45 people max? There are two separate sections, the bar seating and the regular dining seats. I can't remember exactly how many are there on the bar (maybe around 8-10 people?) and the rest is dining table. There are two chefs serving the bar area, and the one that served us that night was Chef Jason. \n\nThere are two options for omakases, we opted for the Exclusive omakase (go big or go home, right?!). The price is surprisingly reasonable, $108 for 14 pieces of nigiri plus 5 other sides?!?! No f-ing way... I'm used to seeing $150+ in New York so this was a good sight for me. \n\nEverything on the menu was pretty impressive, a few items I can do without but in general, very satisfying. There was a piece of mackerel that was extremely fishy to me and I told Chef Jason, he immediately switched to something else after the next round. Also want to mentioned how nice the fish and rice ratio is, the fish perfectly covers the rice and the texture of the rice is nicely vinegar. \n\nAfter talking to Chef Jason a bit more, we learned that he is actually from New York!! Omg... no wonder!!! My boyfriend and I went on and on about which Japanese restaurants we been to in New York and he would tell us whether he liked it or not and how he also worked there before or not. Lastly, Sushi Hon was definitely a nice surprised to me. The food was fresh and the quality was on par.

My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place searching through Yelp on a Saturday night and surprisingly we were able to make reservations for a few hours later! I requested bar seating and they were very nice to call me to let me know that the sushi bar is not available at the time we reserved and asked if another time would work. Thumbs up for actually looking at the notes/special requests and being accommodating!! Some restaurants don't do that... When we got there, a carnival was going on so we had to park kinda far and walk through it (probably why there were so many open reservations) and it's also in a bad area. When we arrived, we did have to wait for people to leave and waited quite long actually... but they were so nice and offered complimentary sake!\n\nOn to the omakase! Their omakases are decently priced. $79 for the regular one is a steal! That's the one we ordered, along with the supplement. The supplement was very worth it!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-22", "description": "Located in the Mission, Sushi Hon is a hidden gem--unsuspecting exterior with a sleek & cozy interior--waiting to delight you with their impressive Omakase options. We came here on a Wednesday evening with reservations and were seated at the bar, where there were 2 sushi chefs preparing the goods. \n\nThere are two options available for the Omakase, either the Tasting Menu Omakase ($79) or the Exclusive Omakase ($108). Adding a supplement for either one is $39. We went for the Tasting Menu Omakase and was in for a real treat! \n\nFor starters, we were presented with a chef's special \"seasonal\", which was tako tonight. Tako is notoriously difficult to prepare and our chef told us he massaged the tako himself prior to preparing it in order to ensure tenderness. It sure did the job because the tako was absolutely tender when we bit into it--very enjoyable and tasty! After the starters, we had 4 different types of nigiri.\n\nMadai (red snapper from Japan) - the red snapper had a hint of citrus which really elevated the flavor of the fish. Botan ebi (spot prawn from Japan) - a sweet shrimp with a a softer texture. Kanpachi (amberjack from Japan) - firm texture with a flavor that holds its own, didn't need any garnishes. Sake (wild king salmon from New Zealand) - this one was my absolute favorite! The salmon was so rich and buttery, had a hint of soy sauce and completely melted in my mouth! \n\nAfter having those 4 nigiri, we were served some Deep Fried Uni with Shiso Leaf. I've never had uni deep fried before so this was a unique experience. The shiso leaf was the most memorable part of the dish, with its distinct flavor that perfectly complemented the uni. I noticed that uni isn't as flavorful cooked as it is raw but it was still delicious. The deep fried uni was then followed by a second round of nigiri, once again with 4 more different types.\n\nMuki hotate (shucked scallop from Japan) - delicious sweet and soft scallop with a hint of citrus that melted in my mouth. Kinmedai (golden eye snapper from Japan) - our chef seared this with a torch and oh my goodness, it made me want to believe that maybe if I seared everything I cooked with a torch, all of it would magically taste amazing! There's a very unique taste when fish is seared and I love it! Akami (wild bluefin tuna from Boston) - this is a very red fatty tuna with a great texture and smooth taste. Shima aji (striped jack from Japan) - beautifully presented, the striped jack tasted very fresh and meaty.\n\nAfter these 4 nigiri, we had a little break and were treated with a dish that included Hokkaido Scallops, Foie Gras, and plum wine gel. Whoever came up with the idea of putting all of these ingredients together was genius! The flavors complement each other so well, despite how uncommonly they're seen together. Loved this dish! After this, we had one more round of nigiri, this time with 3 different kinds. \n\nKurodai (black snapper from Japan) - our chef brought out the torch once again to sear this one and boy was I excited about it! Chu toro (medium fatty tuna from Boston) - I love love love toro in general, this is no secret, so it was no surprise when I closed my eyes and hummed with joy as this toro melted in my mouth. After this last round of nigiri, we opted to add on the A5 Wagyu Beef nigiri and I'm so glad we did because it was amazing! The wagyu is seared with the torch and radish is added on top to balance out the flavors. So good! After that, we were served Shiro Dashi, a soup with shiitake mushrooms and scallions. Very simple and very light way to bring the meal to a close.\n\nLast but not least, we had dessert! The house made daily special was match panna cotta and oh my gosh, it was the best panna cotta I've ever had in my entire life! I am a dessert fiend and this is definitely one of my favorite desserts of all time. Can't say enough good things about it!", "author": "Bellina C."}

The BFF apparently made ressies at Omakase, but was told morning of, that bar seating was out. I meannn what's the pt of going if you can't get bar seating, amirite?! So a SUPER day-of, last min omakase scramble led her to finding available bar seating ressies at Sushi Hon. The best part? Bar seating isn't a traditional two seating times like other omakase spots are (ie 5:30 and 8:30)...this spot works for you and has bar seating ressies for every 15mins available! Idk if it'll stay that way, but I'm all about this now. \n\nService was good overall. The waitstaff was a bit more distracted and inattentive than I would've liked (had to wave them down for hot tea at least three times), but nothing to get upset over. \n\nIf you're doing bar seating, there's two omakase options available - $118 and $79. The higher priced one had 3 additional nigiris than the lower priced option. That's the only diff I noticed. And then you have an additional $39 supplemental option of adding 5 pieces of nigiri to your meal. One additional caveat is that your entire party has to choose the same omakase meal. Calculating it out, the BFF and I opted for the $79 option + $39 supplemental. \n\nThe nigiri was superb (minus this one mushy fish scallion nigiri situation - see pic for reference). I was impressed. The craftsmanship for each piece served was impressive. What I was less impressed by was the cooked foods. There were four non-nigiri dishes, and I didn't like any of them. The squid starter was bitter and cold. The miso soup was extremely bland. The squash blossom was only okay. And the scallop uni caviar dish was goodish, but served with a side spoon and not explained on how to consume. Reviewing yelp photos later, noticed that it was a deconstructed dish and weren't told we needed to reconstruct it and eat in one bite. \n\nOverall, a very good last min option. The BFF also mentioned in the ressie that we were celebrating a bday and they provided an extra dessert! BUT wish the non-nigiri dishes were better. And the tea was hotter and more flavorful. For now, 4 stars!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Ok, ok, I've only been to two restaurants really, but this was the first one my boyfriend and I tried and we loved it so much we had to come back again! The first time we went we just did the regular Omakase menu which was $79/person, and we added the supplemental which I believe is an additional four pieces for an extra $39/person. The second time we went, we went for the Exclusive Menu, at $108/person and added the supplemental too. Seriously though, SO WORTH IT.\n\nI'm horrible at remembering the kinds of pieces we ate, but there wasn't anything that I didn't like. Every piece was so good, flavorful, and just melted in my mouth. It makes all the other sushi restaurants/buffets I've been to just whatevaaaa. The chefs we had were great! The last time we went we had Jason, and he went above and beyond!

After we were seated, it took more than 15 minutes for someone to come by to welcome us and take our drink orders. When we were finally served food, we were really underwhelmed. Most courses were flavorless, and we can get better nigiri at our neighborhood sushi spot for less than half the price.

We decided on omakase dinner priced at $79 per person and added on the supplement for $39/person. The omakase dinner alone was enough to satisfy, but we were feeling gluttonous. Every piece of nigiri was a feast for the eyes and the belly! \n\nOur sushi chef was super nice. We sat at the bar and got to watch our chef make piece after piece of nigiri and learn a little bit about sushi and himself! What an intimate experience! I especially liked how our sushi chef was very attentive. He made my nigiri pieces ever so slightly smaller than my boyfriend's and would only start making the next piece of sushi after I finished my current bite. \n\nFish quality itself was great. It felt like the theme of the night was mackerel because we had a handful of different types of mackerel that night. But that's definitely not a complaint because it was all delicious! I didn't know there could be so many different types of mackerel! Highlight definitely was the Spanish mackerel. Super fresh and melt in your mouth type of feel. Oily without being overtly fishy tasting. \n\nUni was also a big highlight of the night. Chef called it ice cream of the sea! And it really did kinda taste like ice cream. Really creamy and cool on the palate. \n\nThe star of the show was surprisingly the waygu nigiri. I don't usually think of beef when I think of sushi but this experience left me dumbfounded (in a good way)! The waygu beef nigiri was melt in your mouth, slap me silly type of delicious. One small bite offered a powerful punch of meaty, buttery deliciousness. \n\nAnd the rice quality--oh man, the rice quality. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked. You can feel the grains of rice in your mouth without it being dry or tasting too strong of vinegar. The rice tasted like it had really light hints of soy sauce in it. \n\nMan, I could keep going on and on about how amazing this dinner was but I'll stop here.

Where does Sushi Hon fit into the mix?  \n\nLocated in the Mission, this restaurant had its soft opening in 2016.  Overall I'm a fan and it's definitely worth visiting more than once.\n\nEase of finding a table: Plenty of open seating on weekends and weekdays.  Simply make an online reservation and they should have no problem accommodating you.  Not sure if that's a good thing for the restaurant, but it's great for customers who don't want to wait.\n\nAmbience: dark, moderately nice, but not high end.  The sushi bar is about average, however I was seated at a corner next to another patron and we were nearly bumping elbows throughout the dinner.  A simple oversight but one that can make a difference for a customer who is there for an intimate experience.  Everything was quite clean as would be expected.\n\nService: Our service was good but not great.  Both the server and the bar chef mistakenly presented us with dishes that we requested not be included.  We had to ask that they be returned and another dish was promptly brought to us.\n\nFood Quality: Very good!  Some standouts include a very tender and delicious octopus and nicely flavored fatty tuna.  There is a minimalist approach here with subtle use of flavor enhancement for the fish (citrus juice, soy sauce, wasabi)  This is standard practice at the high end omakase restaurants in the area and here is no exception.  Anago did have some bones which detracted a bit from that nigiri.  Also, the rice tended to fall apart with many of the nigiri.\n\nValue: This is where things are outstanding.  The price to quality ratio is simply the best you can find in the city.  Doesn't quite get the restaurant to a 5 star level in my book, but pretty close!\n\nOverall if you take into consideration the value and ease of getting a table this place is quite good.  Will definitely be coming back.", "author": "Better F."}

For example, wife asked for no skin on all her fish served.  Past omakase experiences would simply oblige but not Jason.  He stood ground explaining that beneath the skin has a layer of fat which makes the fish as a whole more tasty.  He was absolutely right.  \n\nExecutive omakase is a better deal for a total of 14 pieces of nigirl.  Why?  Because it already includes chutoro (otoro too fatty, no taste) and Hokkaido uni.  If you were to order the regular omakase then the supplement, you would be paying more.  14 pieces along with a few cooked dishes is just right where as regular omakase with supplement is a little much.  Also executive omakase serves different variety of fish compared to the regular omakase.\n\nAfter the meal, you can always request to your heart's content such as engawa or santa barbara uni.  1 minor gripe was that we didn't get any on the house nigiri since it was my wife's birthday.  We even shared our sake with Jason! and also he forgot 1 of the 14 nigiri!  It was hard and akward reminding him but we felt we had to.  The missing nigiri was quail egg with caviar and gold flakes!!!!!", "author": "Jacky K C."}

For those who are new to Omakase, are very impressed. \n For those who are familiar and have dined at a generous amount of Japanese restaurants, especially Japanese owned sushi restaurants, we are not so impressed.  Yelp Reviewer Doris K from 9/2017 said it best in her second paragraph.  This is a wonderfully decorated and serviced Japanese restaurant, but is trying to be something it is actually not.  \n\nAfter being seated, you immediately recognize that the entire service staff is Korean concluding that the establishment is Korean owned as well.  Kitchen staff and sushi bar didn't appear to be Japanese.  I was prepared to have a formula omakase, without the flare and purity from a Japanese chef.  In some sense, I was wrong.  The presentation, the style, seemed to have a French touch.  As I read the reviews here, one mentioned the kitchen chef has a French background which would explain my experience.  The Uni tempura was served in a large bowl with a small cavity, tempura cut on a bias and propped up.  A Japanese chef might have simply served this Uni on a piece of crisp tempura paper - purity.  I WAS impressed by the Anago - deliciously prepared.  \n\nWhile the food was excellent for what it was, I think many of us more experienced foodies feel as though the experience was a bit artificial.  It was about how many times they could turn the dining room by the end of the night vs truly impressing guest with new experiences.", "author": "Lawrence L."}

Delicious and fresh fish, modern ambiance, and excellent service. \n\nThe interior is modern. There are a few tables for people ordering entrees or a la carte, and a bar for those who opt to do the omakase menu. I have only gone for the omakase, but I would come again to try the main entrees! \n\nThe omakase is $78/person, with 11 pieces. You can add a supplement (additional $36/person, 5 pieces) and sake pairing (additional $40/person). The standard omakase alone was enough to fill us. They gave us a menu to track the progression of our meal, which listed some highlights like the scallop with foie gras, the wagyu tempura, and dessert. The supplement includes more higher quality ingredients (e.g. ootoro, uni, wagyu, etc.) However, the standard omakase is more than enough, and it might be better to order a la carte especially if you can't finish 5 more pieces. We decided to try the ootoro ($9) and it was so worth it! \n\nOverall, I highly recommend Sushi Hon.

We made an appointment at 7 to sit at the bar but two patrons took way longer to leave so we waited at the bar for 30 minutes before we were seated. The host was apologetic, wish they would comp us for at least one drink while we waited at the bar but alas, no dice. Oh well. \n\nAfter we were seated, we decided on the premium omakase and my husband got the sake paring. The pairing doesn't come with every course but they were full pours. My husband actually couldn't finish the drinks because of the big pours.\n\nI don't remember the names of all the nigiri pieces but the majority of them were really good. It wasn't the run of the mill type of fishes and everything tasted so fresh. They also used little garnishes like lemon zest to punch up the flavor of the fish a bit or blow torch the fish a bit for textural contrast. The pieces of the fish that I remember were yellowtail, Spanish mackerel, flounder, firefly squid, uni/scallop, tuna and salmon. \n\nWe also had two cooked courses, foie gras with scallop and beef. The foie gras was overcooked a bit and the flavor of it overwhelmed the scallop but it was a tasty bite. The beef was super delicious, melt in your mouth beef and a crispy wrapper to give it some texture. There was also a salad with a lot of fruit, a miso soup and the panna cotta. \n\nAll in all, I thought we had a great experience at the restaurant. It was a pricy meal but it was well worth it. Many times, you pay $100/head or more and the food was just meh. Definitely worth the splurge.", "author": "Alice W."}

We just had an amazing omakase here today for a super reasonable price! All of the sushi was super fresh and the seasoning was amazingly well balanced... a little ginger here and dab of salt there. The dishes were delicately smoked, marinade, or just left alone. There was nothing that overpowered the fish or felt like it was masking the flavor. Also, all of the fishes in the omakase menu were very unoffensive... not overly fishy at all. Boyfriend was absolutely blown away. Also the scallop was one of the sweetest I have ever had. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have eaten our way though every Michelin Star sushi restaurant (and many of the non star restaurants) and my boyfriend thought this place was better than the majority of them.  I have to agree that this one really left a great impression with me as well. Chef Jason really was thoughtful in creating great flavor profiles... plus the value can NOT be beat! The regular omakase is around $79, which is a huge steal. If you orders the regular omakase you would be pretty full and have had an absolutely wonderful experience. The fishes included in the regular omakase were great (especially the kurodai, the sea perch, the scallop, and the Chu toro.) The cooked dishes were SO GOOD! Excellently prepared. THEN if you top that off with the supplement, you are getting the absolute most decadent uni and wagyu sushi. We even got tuna fish CHEEK sushi... whatttt???? The cheek of the fish is often considered the most rare and decadent... and this was the first time I have ever seen it in a sushi restaurant like that (rather than just giving us regular otoro.) \n\nIf you get the omakase and the supplement, you are paying like $118 for 16 pieces of sushi plus amazing side dishes. That is WAY cheaper than at a lot of these high end restaurants (where you only get like 12 pieces and no cooked dishes.)\n\nService was great and you could tell this place had a lot of regulars. On both sides of us, the group of people wanted to chit chat with us about the sushi and stated they had been there multiple times. The chefs were super friendly too.

We swung by on a Wednesday night 6-6:30 p.m., and the place was empty -- I wasn't sure if that was a good or bad thing, given that it *was* Wednesday night. On the outside, Sushi Hon is very unassuming -- you wouldn't know that Sushi Hon was there anymore than you would've guessed it was a sushi spot. \n\nOn walking in, I got the vibe of a restaurant trying hard to be something that it maybe wasn't. I don't think Sushi Hon bills itself as a \"upscale\" omakase spot like Kusakabe or ju-ni, but I think it might be trying to be? I'm not sure, but it's definitely a casual dinner spot. And if this matters to anyone, Sushi Hon seems to be Korean-owned and none of the chef were Japanese as far as I could tell. I don't think you need to be Japanese or from Japan to make good sushi, but just saying. \n\nWe were a bit early for our reservation, so we hung out at their little bar area and I ordered a drink (ros\u00e9, I think?). Once the chef was ready, they seated us at the bar (they have a sushi bar and then long, communal tables) and we pretty much had Chef Minh to ourselves our entire meal. He was very easy going and fun to talk to, which always makes it a better experience. It's nice to be able to talk to the chef, hear about their journey, learn about the fish and all that jazz. Overall, service was attentive and everyone was nice. They gave us a slice of cake since we were celebrating our anniversary, which I thought was sweet. \n\nAt $78 per person, Sushi Hon's omakase is very affordable and I think worth the price/experience for those who are new to omakase. The fish that night was very basic -- generic even -- but of good quality and well prepared. I think the mostIf I didn't look back at my pictures and notes (yes, I take notes...), I really wouldn't remember much. It wasn't a bad meal by any means, it just wasn't all that memorable. \n\nHighlights:\n- Squash blossom tempura: SO GOOD. If you like kabocha, you will love how sweet and crispy this is. \n- Muke hotate: I watched as Chef Minh cut a slice off the scallop and it was HUGE. Well, the scallop itself was huge to being with. But I was skeptical because giant pieces of neta are bleh. But the scallop was SO sweet and not overly mushy that I was glad it was a big piece :P\n- Wild King Salmon: I'm usually okay on salmon, but this was super buttery\n\nI didn't care too much for the salad appetizer or the Hokkaido scallop with foie. They weren't bad, but again it had that feeling of trying to be something more? Same with the desserts. \n\nFor anyone who considers themselves an omakase aficionado, I would say pass on Sushi Hon. For those who are new to omakase, looking for a more affordable option or like a more basic fish selection, check it out.", "author": "Doris K."}

Each topping of sauce, squeeze of lemon juice or different salt topping is added to accentuate the flavor of the fish.

As expected, many restaurant jack up the price for New Year's Eve with special prix fixe menus. I made a reservation online at Sushi Hon 2 weeks in advance for 8pm on New Year's Eve and then immediately called to ask if they would be serving anything different for New Year's. They said they would be serving the regular menu at the regular price. I was relieved.\n\nThen two days before the reservation, I received a call asking me to move the reservation to 8:30pm. I said no that wouldn't work since my friend's party started at 9pm and I didn't want to be too late. The person on the phone also asked me if I preferred a table or the sushi bar and that only omakase is served at the sushi bar. I said I'd like to sit at the sushi bar.\n\nOne day before the reservation, I got a text telling me that there are only 3 seatings for dinner and it was 5:30pm, 7:00pm, and 8:30pm. I had to choose one and went with 8:30pm but felt that it's rather last minute to force these fixed seating times on people when I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance.\n\n8:30pm on 12/31/17 comes and we walk in about 5 minutes after our reservation time. They were very sweet and gave each of us a glass of sparkling sake on the house to celebrate (and wait). We waited another 30 minutes before we were seated. At this point, it's past 9pm and I was getting anxious about our schedule.\n\nWe were presented a lovely menu that showed a price of $108, which was more than the $78 I was expecting. I asked the server why there is a price discrepancy and was told that there is a regular omakase menu and an executive omakase menu and for New Year's, the sushi bar was only serving the executive omakase (but usually they serve both there). They said they had told me over the phone; I don't recall anyone distinguishing two versions of omakase for me but whatever, I let it go.\n\nWe took the menu and tried to follow along as courses came out. However, it was wrong and the meal was almost over before the correct menu was finally brought out. From the two versions, it appeared that what we got were served not as extensive as the \"wrong\" version. It makes me wonder if the \"wrong\" version is what they serve on other days but the \"right\" version is the marked-up New Year's version even though I was told over the phone that there would be no special New Year's menu. \n\nI realize this review is long and I haven't even mentioned the food and that's because these service/booking issues really hurt our experience. I had to ask them to rush our meal service because we were now running an hour behind our original schedule. The sushi was, after all, fantastic. I really enjoyed the artistry of the chef.

But the restaurant itself is small, intimate and clean.\n\nWe opted for the pre fixe menu which comes with seven courses and dessert. All of the non-sushi dishes, although relatively small, were intricate and beautifully crafted. My personal favorite was the zensai (Hokkaido scallop, Hudson valley foie gras and corn pudding). As part of the pre fixe we also got to try 3 plates (4-5 pieces of sushi at a time) of sushi from all around the world. Everything was fresh and delicious. If you're not a fan of wasabi (which comes with each piece of sushi), I recommend you ask the chef to use less...a lot of my coworkers were struggling with the amount of wasabi being used. If it's in your budget, I highly recommend the supplement which includes uni and wagyu beef. It was definitely my favorite of the night.\n\nService, overall, was great. All of the servers were very attentive and intent on ensuring we had a great experience.\n\nI'll definitely be back!", "author": "Claudia C."}

We ended up here because we were unable to grab some last minute reservations for Hinata. They are both similarly priced with the Omakase starting at $78 pp and an optional supplement for $36. ($2 more expensive than Hinata)\n\nWe all opted for the Omakase AND the supplement. We had the bar seating but we were actually really disappointed with the way that the bar was designed. We were unable to see anything that the chef was preparing and we felt really short sitting at the bar. For all of my past Omakase restaurant experiences, I was able to witness the chef in action, but at Sushi Hon, I was not. :( So that took away from some of the experience for all of us. \n\nFood: I enjoyed majority of the sushi pieces from the Omakase selection but a good 1/3 of them did not \"wow\" me. A few pieces were meh. And only 1 of them impressed all of us (Hokkaido scallop + foie gras was the winner). \n\nService was really good and attentive. All the staff were really nice and did a swell job attending to us throughout our entire dinner. Dinner costed $160 pp including tip for the omakase + supplement + a bottle of wine...all in all, Sushi Hon was decent but not a restaurant I would care to visit again.", "author": "Sunia L."}

Came on a Tuesday, so it wasn't too busy. We were each welcomed with a complimentary glass of bubbly while we waited for our seats to be ready. \n\nThe staff helpfully explained all the little things we were wondering but hadn't gotten a chance to ask-- such as whether to use the chopsticks or our fingers (like we saw others do) for the sushi, what the towels were for, and how the sake pairing worked (three full glasses, not one small one per course). \n\nIt seemed like they either hadn't updated the December 2017 menu or were out of some of the items-- we still received the same number of courses but several dishes were different. \n\nThe only thing that gave me pause about choosing omakase at this restaurant in the future was the extremely dusty glass shelf directly overhead this area, with what appeared to be some bug carcasses. For how pristine everything else looked, I wondered if this was one of the reasons their health score isn't perfect.", "author": "Krista L."}

We did the omasake and while the fish was fresh, it didn't amaze me. I love salmon, but even the salmon didn't amaze me as much as I thought it would. The salad was super small, but refreshing. I'd say one of my favorite dishes was the Hokkaido scallop with foie gras. Now this one really blew me away!! The flavors paired SO well with each other. We were all pretty disappointed with the A5 wagyu roll because it tasted like just a regular fried beef egg roll...Also, the last plate of sushi they brought out was super disappointing. There were 2 types of mackerel and another fish, but literally none of us liked the last plate. The panna cotta dessert was bomb though and it was a perfect ending. \n\nService was great because they kept coming back to make sure our waters were full. We ended up paying about $135 per person because we ordered sake and Sapporo, but we all agreed that the meal wasn't worth it overall oops.", "author": "Selina H."}

After doing a lot of digging into the most worth it omakase restaurants for my budget, I decided on Sushi Hon, and couldn't have asked for a better experience.\n\nFirstly, the food was incredible.  Being my third omakase experience, I had an idea of what to expect, but was blown away by the creativity and elegance of the tasting menu.  My boyfriend and I both decided to do the regular tasting menu (11 pieces plus three small plates and a dessert for $79) and added on the supplemental menu, which was four more pieces for $39 a person.  I enjoyed the variety of fish and presentations they had; one of our pieces was barracuda, which I'd never seen at another sushi restaurant before.  Each of the pieces were unique, flavorful, and a delight when the sushi chef presented it to us.  While the tasting menu had some delicious pieces, I recommend adding the additional four pieces, which included uni, scallop, and wagyu beef, some of the more premier pieces.  \n\nAs amazing as the food was, I was blown away by the service.  The staff was incredibly attentive throughout the meal, and would promptly bring each course without feeling like they were breathing down our necks the entire time.  I mentioned that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and they surprised him (and me) with a slice of green tea cheesecake at the end of the meal, which I didn't even need to ask them to do.  Overall very friendly and warm vibe from the staff in addition to the intimate setting of the restaurant.\n\nOverall, we had an amazing experience.  Although many places say that Sushi Hon is one of the more affordable omakase restaurants in SF, with the supplement, drinks, and tax and tip, the final bill was around $160 a person.  It's definitely a lot, but the experience was definitely worth it for special occasions!", "author": "Kelsey P."}

We made a reservation ahead of time because it was a special occasion and we wanted to make sure we'd have a table. However, turned out that we didn't really need a reservation because the tables were relatively available. The place was low key with a relaxed and elegant ambiance.\n\nOnce we were seated, they asked us which menu we wanted - either the Omakase or the A La Carte. The Omakase is a set menu with courses selected by the chef, and the A La Carte is a regular menu from which guests can choose dishes for themselves. However, note that the two menus are not mutually exclusive - we ended up having the Omakase set courses and ordering a couple items from the A La Carte menu. \n\nThe Omakase ($78/person) included 11 courses. My favorite from the Omakase was the scallop with foie gras. The supplement (an extra $36/person) was an additional course with 5 pieces of sushi. My favorites from the Omakase supplement were the uni nigiri and the wagyu beef nigiri. When each course was served, our server explained to us what it was, how it was made, etc. The quality of the food was definitely top notch - phenomenal taste and distinctly fresh. I'd say it's one of the very best sushi I've ever had, and I LOVE sushi :)", "author": "Queris A."}

I give this place three stars because it was an average experience, there were some goods and bads, but nothing spectacular. \n\nLet's talk about location and ambience - location is in the middle of the neighborhoods and a bit sketchy, we drove here and was able to find parking almost immediately, but I wouldn't want to walk too far to this place in fancy clothes. Ambience was very nice, the decor and style of the restaurant is very stylish and sleek. Three of us ordered the omakase and one person ordered 6 piece nigiri + sashimi platter. We all shared a nice bottle of sake that was $100 - it was really clean and light, can't remember the name, but it was in a blue bottle with white label.\n\nPros:\nSashimi platter for $40 was the best deal in the house - we ordered another platter after seeing the great selection and large portion\nSalmon nigiri from New Zealand: probably the best thing from our meal, it was so buttery and light\nToro sashimi - always amazing, this was another highlight of our meal\nUni - I'm usually indifferent about uni, but this one had a ton of flavor and very silky\nAnago - this was an interesting piece, it was all white and lightly seared and puffed up, first time i've had anago prepared this way - but it was also pricey at $9/piece\nMatcha cheesecake - so decadent, so moist and smooth\n\nCons:\nAnkimo appetizer was just meh.\nOmakase - they switched out a few items from the original menu so I was a little annoyed at that. Instead of waygu beef they gave us duck breast and instead of the house cheesecake they gave us panna cotta. Other than the switch outs - the first two platters were not very buttery fishes, we were pretty surprised to keep getting chewier fishes like amberjack (i forget the name of the rest). \nWe didn't get any toro and only one type of salmon. In hindsight, we would've gotten a sashimi platter each and few select nigiri instead. Our total bill was $640 for the four of us - minus birthday boy.", "author": "Anh Thu P."}

Came here on a Wednesday date night with a reservation at the sushi counter.  \n\nVenue / Service: the restaurant was a little dark inside with the exception of the bar area and the sushi counter, which were very bright.  More of a modern vibe inside the restaurant with metal and stone accents (vs. traditional Japanese wood accents).  Luckily, it wasn't too busy when we came so service was pretty quick, especially since we sat at the sushi counter.  They move quickly but keep watch on pacing to make sure dishes don't come out too quickly.\n\nFood: being at the sushi. counter, we went with the omakaze ($78 per person), which consisted of a November salad, 4 pieces of sushi chosen by the chef, tempura in a dashi broth, zensai (hokkaido scallop, foie gras, hachiya persimmon, rose wine gel), 3 more pieces of sushi, owan spicy shiro miso (duck, which beach mushroom, scallion), and dessert (house made cheese cake w/ raspberries, pinapple mint).  There is also a supplement ($39 extra) of 5 sushi of the chef's choice or you can order pieces a la carte after.\nMy favorite nigiri pieces were the Kurodai (black sea bream; lighter fish with an interesting texture), Kamasu (barracuda; firm fish with a strong meaty flavor), and Saba (wild Japanese mackeral).  Of the prepared dishes, our favorites were the zensai and the dessert.  The Zensai had one of the most interesting surf-turf combos I've ever seen (scallop and foie gras), which worked with the persimmon so that the dish wasn't heavy overall.  We both were surprised with how light and fluffy the cheesecake was- reminded you more of something between a panna cota and a mousse.  The miso was also a highlight- it had an amazing earthy aroma and rich flavor for a miso (plus soup on a cold day always makes you feel better)!\n\nConsidering the quality of the fish and the number of dishes provided, I'd say this is a decent bang-for-your-buck place sushi-wise if you don't want to spend all of the $$$$ on sushi.  Won't be as fancy as your ju-ni / other Michelin restaurants, but you won't be super unsatisfied with Sushi Hon.", "author": "Audrey H."}

This regular omakase comes with: starter-4 nigiri- tempura- 4nigiri- zensai- 3 nigiri-dashi-dessert in this order in the span of ~1.5hrs (total of 11 nigiri of chef choice; premium is 14nigiri $109pp).

Chef recommends eating with our fingers instead of chapstick, no need to dip in soy sauce either, it was fun experience. Because I am a big fan of fatty parts, we ordered ottoro ($9.5) and chef gave us chutoro on the house, which was a plus. I recommend reserving seats at the counter near the chef. It's just fun watching how each nigiri is made so delicately and chef's explanation while serving. Service is generally excellent- they serve sake in a small wine glass. Good collection of beers, wines, and sake to go well with sushi. Cozy, modern, chill vibes in the restaurant. Since chef's choice changes every season and with ingredients at the time, I would definitely want to go back some other time and try more variety.

I leave this place 100% satisfied with every cent that I paid. It may lack obvious gimmicks, and it won't be fawned over by status-obsessed name droppers on Eater, but every piece of fish was A+, and the light but creative treatment -- especially the yuzu zest on their internationally sourced white fish -- made me feel like I was in assured, authentic professional hands. Honestly I feel like places like Akiko's Sushi and Pabu *wished* they were so unassumingly good.\n\nOther pluses: I could score same-day reservations with extreme ease, and the service was prompt, warm, and attentive. The dishes came out at an efficient but unhurried speed. The non-sushi dishes (duck miso soup, butter squash tempura, foie gras bite, cheesecake mousse) were also exceedingly good.\n\nBe forewarned that the omakase in August was extremely fish-centric, with only scallop as a non-fish crudo dish.

I can finally say that I've found my favorite sushi restaurant in San Francisco. The quality is well worth the price. I've ordered both their omakase and a combination of their small dishes, and I've never been disappointed. You can make a reservation online and it usually doesn't get extremely crowded (at least, not yet), so I can usually make a day-of or day-before reservation. Best of all, everyone who works at Sushi Hon is friendly, kind, and generally wonderful. It's a great dining experience every time I come!\n\nTip #1: The omakase is delicious. It comes with a combination of about 11 nigiri and 4 small dishes. The nigiri pieces seems to be a little wasabi-heavy, so if you aren't a fan of wasabi let them know in advance. The omakase is ~$80, and you can add a nigiri supplement for $37 or a sake pairing (I don't remember the exact price). \n\nTip #2: You can usually find street parking in the area, but you might have to go out a few blocks. There are also a smattering of bars within a few blocks, so if you do happen to drop by without a reservation and there's a wait, you can grab some drinks while you wait (I recommend Asiento). \n\nOverall, I can't say enough good things about Sushi Hon!

I especially love the appetizers/side courses from kitchen chef Jang... she is super talented and my personal favorite is the foie gras with scallop dish. The flavors and seasonal ingredients she uses work so perfectly well together. \n\nChef Min went above and beyond with his superb knife skills and presentation. I told him that my favorite fish is saba but he did not have fresh saba that day so he declined to even serve it to me. Instead he served me another piece of fish on the house!!! To TOP IT OFF... the second time I went, he remembers that I love saba and he saved the best piece for me! I do not call that customer service...but instead customer connection. I can not appreciate Sushi Hon's staff enough. From the front of the house to the back.... Sushi Hon exceeds all of my expectations. \n\nI will be back a third time... but hopefully this time... I dont end up leaving too drunk! LOL.", "author": "Hubert H."}

The moment we stepped foot into the restaurant, they were so inviting, friendly & so attentive.

The staff was so friendly and attentive. We went with the omakase for my boyfriend's birthday & it was soooo good and worth it. We also had some of their alcoholic drinks, & those were amazing. My boyfriend tried various sake drinks, while I had the dessert plum wine & I HIGHLY recommend getting that drink for those who love sweet things. It was soooo good that I had 3 full glasses of it! They were so knowledgeable and I appreciated that they explained each dish and piece of sushi.

Now their omakase offers a wide comprehensive tasting spectrum that the restaurant serve, besides good and fresh sashimi slices(one particular nigiri was soooo creamy, I die), we were served food such as scallop topped with foie gras though I did think that the foie gras was a little overcooked(rubbery texture compared to melting one), cute tamago that had tasted like creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, great delicious pomegranate-raspberries jam paired with romaine lettuce(?) and their special dressing, ending the omakase with a spicy duck miso soup! I love my duck and this was so pretty good! The place does the omakase accordingly to our own taste bud, eg if we want our nigiri to be better seasoned with soy sauce or rice quantity of it. I think the omakase menu is yummy and will defo recommend it but I doubt I'll do a solid 3rd round of it! \n\nThe dessert was BOMB, it was their homemade cheesecake with strawberry pur\u00e9e something. The cheesecake tasted like as though it was hand-whipped to softness then had that added sweetness of honey(perhaps?) with tangy strawberry pur\u00e9e. \n\nI would want to come back and try their ala carte menu!

I had the regular Omakase and didn't opt for the more expensive seasonal one though I feel like I doubt it would have made that much of a difference. The fish was good but there was nothing amazing that was added on top of the fish to enhance the flavor. Because of that I think I would have been more satisfied choosing my own pieces then what the chef had chosen as a set. The only item that was the best was the foie gras on top of the scallop but I'm not sure if I really want to go to a high end sushi place just to eat foie gras. I'm giving this place 4 stars because the fish is good quality, the servers seemed attentive, and I enjoyed the sake.\n\nIf you end up going here maybe go for the more expensive one and it might make a difference, else just order which nigiri you enjoy and just treat it like you're paying for good quality fish. I probably will move on to another Omakase restaurant where I hope the chef will really wow me.", "author": "Wesley C."}

Maybe my expectation was too high?\n\nI've been to quite a bit of omakase styled restaurants. I think they are reading too much into the yelp reviews to the point where they go to the extreme. One review had mentioned that there was not enough \"sauce\" for flavoring. Guess what? EVERY SINGLE piece I had was drizzled with, what I assume, unagi sauce. Honestly? Every single piece? Another yelper had stated, \"too much wasbi,\" so at one point in the night, our chef asked, \"Too much wasbi?\" Do what you think is best for that piece? You're the chef.\n\nMy favorite dish from last night was their Japanese eggplant with mushroom and truffle sauce. That was unique! The flavoring was there. \n\nAlso, the fire squid dish was amazing! The blend of the seaweed, asparagus and the fire squid was tasty. Not sure if I liked the daisy on top. \n\nOverall, I think it was over priced for an omakase.

I was disappointed to learn Sushi Hon had raised its prices since the last time I went, but would still recommend this place to any sushi lover looking for an underrated restaurant for a reasonably priced experience.\n\n[Omakase]\nI had the Omakase here. For the price at around ~70, I felt that the amount of nigiri I received in the meal was worth the price. Most Omakase's in SF will set you back around 100 dollars and leave you wanting to order more, but Sushi Hon gives you the right amount. I do feel that the chef could go lighter on the wasabi as that sometimes did overpower the taste of the fish. The fish was great quality. However, if you order a-la-carte, the prices can get pretty expensive. \n\n[Service]\nOur server explained each piece of nigiri and the flow of the course extremely well! Super friendly guys. \n\n[Decor]\nThe restaurant is still not that well known, but I liked that they played the Jiro Dreams of Sushi documentary when I was there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-02", "description": "I stumbled upon this place since it was one of the few options by my house that was actually open on January 1st. I did the $80 omakase menu with the $40 sake/wine pairing. The first dish was a microscopic winter salad that was composed of some greens, a slice of Cara Cara orange, a slice of mango, and a touch of dressing. Even simply doubling or tripling the size of this salad would've set a better tone to the overall meal without affecting the costs of the restaurant.\n\nThe tempura A5 wagyu roll was perhaps the main reason I decided to try the tasting menu. It was a small portion however, and could've been offset with another vegetable roll. \n\nThere were 3 courses of nigiri with 11 pieces in total which were flavored by the chefs. These were all quite good. Lots of different fish from around the world, and the plating was beautiful. \n\nThe scallop with foie gras was a bit of a miss since everything tasted great on its own merits; however, there wasn't quite anything pulling all the flavors together. \n\nThe sake pairing featured: \nSolid sparkling Pinot Noir rose\nA good junmai sake\nA spectacular Black rice sake(perhaps my favorite part of the meal actually)\nAn amazing unfiltered sake\n\nThe dessert was a house made cheesecake which was somehow the size I wish a few of the previous dishes had been. \n\nI recognize my tone is not necessarily that of a good review, but I think my criticism towards continued refinement in balance you'd be able to execute a better experience at each stage without really adding more cost. I think you could tack on an extra $10 and make the meal slightly more substantial while adding nuance of flavor. You could also add a glass of plum wine to pair with dessert. \n\nI will probably try this place again in the future, so I hope they can tighten up the experience, which could turn them into a Michelin contender.", "author": "Zachary T."}

Like when Elite Daily suggested women to wear a strap-on for a week to feel liberated. The sadist in me was intrigued but my then boyfriend wasn't having it. \n\nPrude.\n\nI'm kidding - why pay $100 for a strap-on when I can feel liberated for free: slinging off my bra at the end of a long work day. BEST feeling ever.  \n\nA yelp friend gave me a heads up about Sushi Hon's opening but I was apprehensive about going (sister restaurant to Tamashisoul in The Marina: https://www.yelp.com/biz/tamashisoul-sushi-bar-san-francisco). Mediocre Japanese restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area are a dime a dozen. However, Sushi Hon was featured in a Eater and Hoodline article. They advertised offering an affordable \"premium\" omakase since the owner owns the building and doesn't pay astronomical rent. In the article, they name dropped high-end sushi bars like j\u016b-ni and Kusakabe which I hope they weren't trying to compare Sushi Hon to because it's not. \n\nMy friend and I visited over the weekend for their omakase at the sushi bar. Reservations are highly recommended (but they didn't seem to have mine on file). \n\nNo printed food menu (only drink menu). There's a blackboard menu in the dining area: http://bit.ly/2abXlQs so the ordering process was confusing since this wasn't communicated and you couldn't see the menu from the sushi bar. We opted for the Omakase for $65 which we were told includes miso soup, edamame, several small plates, and 7 pieces of nigiri. \n\nO M A K A S E (\"11 courses\")\n(1) Hamachi Ceviche: http://bit.ly/29V3C4l\nTwo slices of semi-fresh hamachi sashimi with orange segments. The dish was too sweet and desperately needed acid. \n\n(2) Rainbow Trout: http://bit.ly/2a0IEgy\nThis was oddly a shared dish for two but the tiny piece of trout was cooked well and tender.\n\n(3) Geso Karaage: http://bit.ly/2a63FeX\nAnother shared dish, the squid tentacles were chewy.\n\n(4) Black Cod & Japanese Sticky: http://bit.ly/2ae1HYe\nOne of the better dishes of the night, the black cod was light, flaky, and tender but again...not sure why this is served as a shared dish. \n\n(5-11) Nigiri - Bluefin Tuna, Aji, Hirame, Madai, Shima Aji, Saba, Chutoro: http://bit.ly/2ae2k4a\nNigiri is only good as the shari (sushi rice) and these ones were seriously lacking the proper seasoning. Like other omakase focused restaurants, they don't offer soy or wasabi as they sauce and garnish each piece. \n\nHowever, most of the nigiri weren't properly sauced and garnished. I'm not into saucy sushi but several of the pieces were completely flavorless and dry. The fish was also not the greatest quality. The chutoro, for example was oddly dry when it should melt in your mouth. The madai was the best of the bunch (rich and buttery) but the hirame had intact sinew that I had to spit out. Also, ordered anago a la carte which was fishy and chewy. \n\nThe staff were all very friendly and hospitable. Since it's a soft opening, kinks are expected with service and I'm usually very understanding about that. However, food service was unreasonably and frustratingly slow. It took 20 minutes to receive the first pre-course: miso soup. A couple arrived one hour AFTER us and they received their third course the same time as us. Expect large time gaps between courses. \n\nTo make matters worse, they only have 1 sushi chef for the entire restaurant that seats 49 (I counted 35 customers when we were at dinner). Usually sushi bars have 2-4 sushi chefs so that really puts an undue burden for their one lone sushi chef to deliver volume versus quality pieces. He was so overwhelmed so I felt badly for him. \n\nThe ambiance is contemporary and trendy. There's 12 seats at the sushi bar, three communal tables, and sake bar seating. No two or four top tables. \n\nBoth my friend were able to find street parking separately within minutes so it's not a huge issue if you dine early at 6 pmish. \n\nI appreciate what Sushi Hon is trying to offer: affordable \"premium\" omakase but the articles were misleading. Yes, it's a fraction of the cost but the quality is not \"premium\" and is similar to your run-of-the-mill sushi bars in The Sunset, SoMa, Noe Valley, Castro, etc. You're better off spending an extra $30 bucks to dine at the sushi bars they mentioned like j\u016b-ni or Kusakabe where you get more nigiri, the quality is infinitely better, and you're getting a real omakase experience with refined service. \n\nIn the end, I felt like we were overpaying for mediocrity: $100 pp omakase, one drink, tax and tip. \n\n*Le sigh*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I've always really liked it here and believed that the quality and technical ability of the chefs were great. \n\nLast night we got a table instead for 5 people and had the omakase there. We raved about this place to our friends who came for the first time. 3 of us got regular omakase and the other 2 got the supplement on top. \n\nIt was a relatively busy night and we were seated at around 8:30 and ordered by 8:45. We left the restaurant at 11:30 because that's how long it took for the food to come out. It was painfully, painfully slow. The fish was not as fresh (some pieces were bland and fishy), and the rice was falling all over the place. It wasn't the same as I was used to - good sushi always means rice cooked to perfection- not too soft, not too hard, and consistent amount of rice between each piece. Last night this was not the case and for a $150 meal I would have expected way more in both fish and rice quality. We also waited for a looooong in between servings; all of us were craning our necks looking at the kitchen. \n\nWhat bothered me as well was I felt 0 sense of urgency from the servers and chefs. We could see them cleaning up in the kitchen, wiping items down, all the while a bunch of the tables were waiting for food. Even after the 3 of us finished the regular omakase, we waited another 10 minutes to get the supplement. \n\nAt the end of the meal, the bill came with a 20% tip already included. This wasn't written on the menu anywhere, so we pointed this out to the server. She said that was their restaurant policy, but talked to her manager and they took it off. For a night with slow food and low quality items I was surprised they would do that. \n\nAll in all I felt embarrassed for raving about this place to my friends who left disliking the spot.

If we're willing to pay the additional supplement, wow us with another expensive choice/cut, so I know it was a saving and worth adding; just saying....SMH \n\nI was disappointed with their hard sushi rice and two of their fish selections: Aji horse mackerel -  Thankfully, I had ordered a delish sake to cleanse that typical super fishy mackerel taste.  This fish was meant to be grilled, fried, and/or pan-fried please!\n\nThe second disappointing fish was, uhmm...I forgot the name, but it came out in the 3rd sushi selection with this tart thin strip on top.  The tart thin strip was an interesting flavor which we both enjoyed, but too bad it could not hide that funkiness of the fish, so again had to discreetly spit it out into a napkin. \n\nThey had this 'Duck Roll' on their printed menu, instead they served fried zucchini blossom stuffed with butternut squash puree with this broth poured into it; not bad.   They didn't 'volunteered' to tell you the menu had changed until I asked.\n\n10 pieces Sashimi - Fresh, but not worth the price when some regular cheap fish was added to the selection.  \n\n2 Stars - Great service especially the Japanese lady that had  'ASKED', 'OFFERED', and 'did NOT' charged the additional $2.50 fresh and much needed wasabi!!!\n\n1 Star - OMG, the SAKE bottle we had ordered!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-13", "description": "We were looking for a new omakase place to add to our rotation and tried Sushi Hon based on a recommendation from a friend.  We were cautiously optimistic as the friend who recommended has been to multiple high-end omakase restaurants (e.g. Kusakabe, Harshiri, etc.).  I say cautiously optimistic since there has been a boom of new sushi restaurants offering omakase and I'd say 75% are subpar.  \n\nWe made a reservation and promptly arrived 5 minutes prior.  Upon arriving we were told the previous group had not finished and would be a few minutes.  The meal got off to a ominous start when we were seated about 20 minutes later.  However, all was cured once the omakase started.  Each course was interesting and the fish was fresh and well made.  Additionally, we ordered 1 sake pairing to be split between my girlfriend and I.  Our waiter Jeff \"apologized\" for his poor counting skills and poured us 2 portions every course.  That was an amazing touch.  If I had anything to nitpick it'd be that I prefer the rice for nigiri to be slightly on the vinegary side to balance out the fish.  \n\nOverall, this is a great omakase option for a really reasonable cost.  Factoring in price ($78 for omakase + $36 supplement which gets you toro, uni, and a few more pieces), it's a pretty good value.", "author": "Alex M."}

It's the other courses that show some creativity. \n\nService was a little uneven. They made some rather awkward jokes and did forget a good aversion in the party but was nice enough to add another nigiri after they realized their mistake.\n\nIt was on the quieter side of restaurants which isn't bad for Japanese but because it is so dimly lit it feels like it should be more bustling and trendy.\n\nOverall it's worth trying if you want quality omakase in the city but for a reasonable price for high end Japanese.", "author": "Victor W."}

The staff was super polite about what technically was my fault, and quickly accommodated us to seats at the chef's table, with a gentle reminder that I have 1 hour until the next round of reservations.\n\nThe prices seemed to have increased slightly: $79 (11-course standard omakase), $109 (14-choose exclusive omakase) and option of $39 for 5 supplements. We both opted for the standard, with me adding supplements (chu toro, snow crab leg, uni, A5 wagyu, tamago). Each course was paced well, and we appreciated a good mix of cooked food in between. The only thing I was taken aback about was there were 3 kind of mackerel nigiris which seemed like an overkill, but each of them tasted uniquely different from one another. I've had better sushi elsewhere, but I've also paid a lot more for what I was served here. We enjoyed the overall quality, the order the fish was served and the dimensions each paired garnish provided.\n\nContrary to some reviews, the service we received was impeccable.

I got all excited when I read articles online touting that this was of the same caliber as Kusakabe and Ju-ni, but at a much lower price point but to me, it was like comparing apples and oranges. I'd rather spend the extra $30-50 for a true omakase, Michelin-star experience at Kusakabe, instead of the $65 for the omakase here. Maybe your results will vary. You can do just a $65 tasting at the sushi bar of just nigiri or a slightly more expensive option (I think $73-75) for a mixture of hot food from the kitchen and some sashimi. \n\nI came here with my boyfriend to celebrate our an anniversary, and maybe it was gamble to come somewhere that had just opened, but we were both underwhelmed and it left me wishing I had picked somewhere tried & true.\n\nIf you want to make a reservation, you can do it on the phone or OpenTable. I was able to make one for Sunday evening just a few hours prior. When we showed up at 7:45 to eat at the sushi bar, we had to wait 20-25 min to be seated. At least they gave us some deep fried squid to make up for the delay, which was nice. When we finally got seated at the sushi bar, we basically had to wait another 10-15 to get our first course. At one point I was wondering if I was just going to sit there and watch the sushi chef make food, or if I was going to be able to eat. Maybe I was just a bit hangry or impatient.\n\nWhen the food finally started to come out, I wasn't particularly impressed with the fish. It was good but nothing mind-blowing and the proportion of wasabi was too much for the sushi. Several times we had wasabi brain freeze which was painful and overshadowed any taste of the fish. They may need to hire another sushi chef to make the nigiri faster - I don't need it one after the other but I felt like we spent a good portion of our dinner just waiting. I felt like a seal sitting there just waiting for another piece of fish to be placed in front of me.\n\nWe ended up getting an extra piece of Hokkaido uni which was not cheap ($10 per person), so when all was said and done, we each ended up paying around $100 per person. To be honest, I would have preferred to have a much nicer and better timed experience at Kusakabe or one of the fancier places. If you're looking for something nice but not as expensive, try Tsubasa sushi (Hayes) or Delage (Oakland). You'll get a much better bang for your buck.", "author": "Christina L."}

I made the reservation a few weeks in advance because we wanted a better sushi experience without too much concern about cost.  I was contacted by the restaurant just once, on the day of the meal, to confirm whether we were coming (we were) and if we wanted the omakase option.\n\nWe arrived at 6pm and were greeted very warmly by several Sushi Hon employees.  I liked that they were expecting us, but they weren't overwhelming.  The restaurant has a typically minimalist, clean, calm appearance.  The person who waited on us was polite and explained the menu in detail.  We all opted for the omakase option.  There were a few small substitutions that they easily accommodated.\n\nThe fish here is spectacular.  No qualifications are needed.  I've eaten at many excellent sushi restaurants, including Yoshizumi in San Mateo, and Sushi Hon holds up to all of them.  The food here is a bargain, in my opinion.  I'd tell you how good the barracuda is, but unless you taste it, I don't have adequate words.\n\nA few of us splurged on the sake flights and supplemental dishes.  The sakes were terrific.  If you're here, don't skimp, I'd say.\n\nGreat food and service and a very memorable meal.

We were the only ones for a solid hour so we got a really personalized taste of the sushi, where the food was lovingly prepared and explained to us. The sushi chef hails from Gintei in San Mateo and he knows what he's doing with the fish. The sashimi is flown in from Tsukiji Market in Tokyo and the rice is perfectly cooked with the perfect temperature (so important).\n\nWe opted for the 12 course omakase for $85, although there's a very affordable 10 course for $65, and I believe 6-8 course omakase for $45. There's also some vegetable and minor courses before the fish, although I would say that's rather forgettable. \n\nFrankly I thought the sushi was delicious, and even though the chef doesn't \"experiment\" or expand the boundaries of sushi, it's simple, traditional, and more importantly, high in quality. I would recommend Sushi Hon over some of the more innovative edomae sushi places that have been popping up in SF lately. \n\nThe restaurant is fairly big, and they have a full wine, beer, and cocktail list.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-23", "description": "Came during their soft opening. The \"11 course tasting\" means each piece of shashimi is 1 course. That was a little disappointing and wasn't explained clearly. They have a large menu on the wall of things on their pre fixe but fail to indicate not everything on the wall will be brought out-- it's chefs choice. And as it was explained at the end, \"two items per category would come out,\" not everything written on the wall. So 2 from appetizers, 2 from hot plates (all very small), and 7 pieces of shashimi give you 11 \"courses\". \n\nSo for $65 I felt the price wasn't worth it. Shashimi is about $4 a piece, and the apps we got were one portion split for two. We came here on recommendation by SF Eater that called this an \"affordable omakase\" but for a $80 meal (after tip and tax) there are much better options throughout the city. \n\nDuring their soft opening, service was painfully slow. Their kitchen and wait staff did not communicate; at one point it was 30 minutes between our miso soup opener and the appetizer course. The overall experience was 2 hrs with a lot of waiting in between--I realize some tasting menus take 2 hrs but they are always giving you food. \n\nOverall, there is potential but a lot of kinks to work out; the menu needs to be more clear and service really needs to be fixed. I don't think I'm going to come back based on other options that have better, attentive, service and more food for the price or slightly more. I realize it's soft opening; food was great not amazing so all things considered, I think 3 stars is fair. \n\nSome tips:\n-Check your check. The draft is $4 on the menu and $5 on check---they were kind enough to comp it. \n-don't come hungry. Small portions and the slow service made it painful for me to sit for \n-bring a jacket.

We asked him to do less & unfortunately it took 4 pieces of sushi for him to understand that we really did not want our fish to be overpowered. After that, the sushi was great! We ended with uni which my husband loves & I usually don't like at all but it my husband & I agreed, it was really good, it came in from Japan!\nWe ended our meal with a grilled fish which was out of this world!

It was SOOOO GOOOOOOOD.... a lot of very fresh tuna layered between an equal amount of avocado, topped with mint, caviar and a quail egg yolk and served with homemade chips... I am blanking on the name of the root vegetable they were made from but they were perfect spoons for the tuna goodness. \n\nI also tried the miso glazed salmon which was so tender, it almost seemed like it was smoked, the poached egg with sesame paste and an unagi nigiri. All very good as well. \n\nThe service was great - quick, attentive and really accommodating to the gluten free among our group. They do need bigger water glasses - our waiter and I had a running joke about how many times he refilled my water (we ended at 16). \n\nI will definitely be back here for dinner and/or 5 servings of the tuna tartare.", "author": "Camille E."}

Somehow this place had almost the entire night open on OpenTable, with an omakase menu if you request the bar. $65 is super reasonable, I was sold!\n\nSake menu wasn't too shabby. I'm not the best judge, but the two wine glasses we got were pretty good. As for the course itself, it was 12 pieces for $68.\n\nI've been to some of the most hyped omakase joints in the Bay, so my bar's pretty high. I think for the price, I was definitely satisfied and enjoyed my meal. Somehow tuna from Boston isn't completely terrible compared to what I was expecting. I was surprised they didn't end on maguro, which was okay, but the uni they did use from Hokkaido was solid - not the best I've had, but very good. \n\nMy favorite piece was the sanma/pacific saury/pike mackerel. Definitely had that super rich, fatty texture I love at the end but came closer to the second third. And as one of the cheapest pieces a la carte ($5), I totally got a second one afterwards!\n\nWith a glass of sake at $18 and the extra piece, the bill came out to about $100 before tip. Note that while both this omakase and their prix fixe menus are nice, they're by no means necessary. You can get all the nigiri and a decent selection of apps/entrees a la carte to save some dimes.\n\nI'm not sure I'd come back to do the full on course, but I'd definitely be game to return for my favorites.", "author": "Dave N."}

I wanted to stop the service after the first bite of the sushi in an Omakase course.\n\nIt's unbelievable how positive the reviews for this place are. This was one of the worst omakase experience I had in the recent time.\n\nThey didn't cook the rice right. It was undercooked (al dente for sushi rice? what?), and waaaaay under seasoned. The rice couldn't stick together, and fell apart when I picked up the sushi (even with hand!) I couldn't taste any vinegar at all. Most of the fish seemed to be high quality (except a few at the end, where it was way too mushy for that type of fish I wanted to spit it out but didn't to be polite), but they didn't do a good job at curing the fish at all. All the flavor came from the sauce (like i said, they didn't season their rice).\n\nI never looked forwards to the last bite of an omakase meal like this before. After the first piece of sushi they served, I already knew i wouldn't enjoy the rest of the course. Because they messed up the rice so badly, and this rice was going to accompany all the fish of the entire course.\n\nWe didn't ask them to end the meal right there out of politeness. We sat at the sushi bar, right in front of the chef, and the restaurant was NOT busy at all. I did make some faces, and paused every time my sushi rice fell apart. Yet, the chef never cared to make a conversation or asked how everything was going. He just explained what the fish was. What's the seasoning he used, and that's it. I wouldn't recommend anyone going even if the meal was 1/5 of the price.", "author": "Pantry B."}

For example, 1 single king salmon nigiri is priced at $5, whereas in other fine sushi places you can get 2 nigiri same quality at the same price or slightly more. The hand roll was priced at $9 on the menu, but we weren't told that the price depends on what sashimi you're requesting until we saw the receipt. Service was horrible: we requested a missing nigiri for 3 times without wasabi while it came with it, and our server never checked on us. In the end, they made a mistake to charge extra on the receipt, and the waitress claimed it was correct until I explained slowly to another waiter.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-09", "description": "We had a great second experience at Sushi Hon. I ordered the omakase but my boyfriend chose dishes from the a la carte menu (which, by the way, has an amazing assortment and range of options). Typically their policy is that only omakase diners may sit at the sushi bar, but because it was a quiet evening, and only one of us was ordering from the a la carte menu, they made an exception for us. We were able to enjoy the company of Chef Lee, who was friendly and knowledgable about each fish we were served. He even managed to coordinate our two orders so we finished at about the same time. Omakase is not inexpensive anywhere, but I think the price at Sushi Hon is very reasonable. I'm seeing other Yelp reviews that are complaining about \"sauce\" on their nigiri. First of all, if there is a sauce on the nigiri, it's typical just gently brushed on. It's not slathered by any means. Secondly, none of the sauces are flavored strongly enough that you don't taste the fish. They're mostly only put on the \"fishier\" fish like mackerel (ex. wild Japanese mackerel with white sea kelp infused vinegar - as you can imagine, the acidity of the vinegar was beautiful with the oiliness of the mackerel). Each ingredient or preparation method (sometimes the fish skin is lightly toasted with a torch) is meant to elevate the fish. Keep in mind that preparing the pieces this way is in lieu of dunking that beautiful fish in soy sauce. That being said, if you're looking for completely naked, untouched nigiri, that's not typically what you will find here. \n\nThe full omakase also includes a few cooked dishes, which were all phenomenal. One, for example, was wagyu beef, accompanied by two stuffed morel mushrooms; one stuffed with potato and cod, and the other with Grade A5 Wagyu. What I absolutely love about Sushi Hon's food, is that all of it is incredibly well thought-out. Every ingredient in each dish had a reason for being there, which is a beautiful thing. \n\nI might also add that our waiter was attentive and knowledgable as well. He took care to describe each of the cooked dishes to us, and he was on the ball refilling our sake glasses from our bottle when he noticed them getting low.", "author": "Amanda R."}

Everything was so fresh and tasty and the Japanese wine selection was great. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the price and the portion sizes. We sadly walked a couple of blocks and got tacos after we spent $120 here. We left hungry so definitely come here with a large budget to spend. \n\nAdvice to the manager: \n\nI think the prices are a little too high for the area. Since there isn't a lot of foot traffic people are going to have to go out of their way to visit the restaurant. I think you'll do fine on a Friday or Saturday night but I think it's going to be difficult for you during the week. The place was empty on a Wednesday night and the staff looked bored. I'd suggest offering lower price menu options or at least a happy hour during the week to get my husband and I to come in more often as we only live a few blocks away. Right now it's going to be a special \"treat restaurant\" for us because of that.

The experience is a huge part of why I choose to dine out so often. The service here was phenomenal, especially considering it was their first night testing everything out. Very attentive, friendly, and quick to help with any requests our group had.\n\nAs for the food, we had the great fortune of trying a wide variety of different dishes. Some were more sushi focused, and some had more of the French influence their chef brings to the table. My favorite of the night was the miso butter poached black cod. It melted in your mouth and was cooked to perfection.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try the full omokase experience in the next week or two!", "author": "Jaron E."}

The fish was plentiful and delicious, carefully prepared to all around perfection. The rice was well done, every piece of sushi, a distinct and wonderful flavor. The small plates that came between every few pieces of fish were nothing short of jaw dropping and full of delightful flavors. Nothing could have made this meal more delectable, other than a nice sake...oh wait, it just got better! I asked the manager for a recommendation to go with the nights preparation and he hit the nail on the head. All in all, fantastic experience all around. I would have, and unfortunately have paid double, even triple for less quantites, quality, and flavored food. My new favorite sushi spot in sf. Thank you chef aiden and chef sunny!", "author": "Tommy C."}

It's in a strange location adjacent to a public elementary school a bit isolated for a restaurant. \n\nI ordered the set menu for $75 a person and received three sushi plates for a total of 11 nigiri interspersed with three special taste plates, the first was a two or three pieces of sashimi served ceviche style, the second was rice porridge and the last was a potato croquet. Final item was dessert which was a homemade panna cotta.\n\nOverall I thought it was a good value. Nigiri was of excellent quality. Croquet was wonderful. My main complaint was that the rice porridge was served lukewarm at best. I would prefer it hot. It also took quite a while for the first plate to arrive. Otherwise it was fairly well spaced with dinner completed in about an hour and the service was attentive. I'd go back for sure.", "author": "Jolene Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-31", "description": "I came to Sushi Hon a week after their opening for my dad's birthday. I recently heard of Sushi Hon from an SF Eater article and thought $65 was an incredibly affordable price for 11 courses of omakase if the quality was really as good as they said it was. And to clarify, 6 of the 11 courses were individual pieces of nigiri, so that could be misleading. Turned out to be about $80+ after tax and tip with no add-ons.\n\nHard to complain about the small dishes - Edamame, asparagus and green beans in sesame paste, lightly fried hamachi, and bonito sashimi. All were delicious and refined.\n\nThe nigiri was also pretty impressive, with the chu toro and snapper being the highlights. The waitress also didn't know which pieces of nigiri were being served and I had to ask a couple times for clarification before she had to confirm with a supervisor. I recognize it was one week in, but memorizing 6 pieces of fish is highly important for the experience.\n\nHowever, the second critique we experienced was the following 6-piece maki course, which was labeled as \"chef's choice.\" Thinking we would get some type of fish, it was disappointing to be presented with cucumber instead. Upon asking and explaining our confusion, the waiters responded that the chefs wanted something lighter and refreshing to contrast with the oilier, fattier fish. Understandable explanation, but seems like all the other reviewers also had pretty fatty fish. If the maki was going to be cucumber all along, it was deceiving to title it \"chef's choice\" - just name it as it is.\n\nLastly, before we started our meal, I told the waiters it was my dad's birthday and asked if they did something special. They confirmed they would, but didn't actually do anything by the time we paid.\n\nThough these could be viewed as less significant criticisms, they were detractors from an experience that was intended to be a refined, high quality meal. Based on the quality and selection throughout SF, I likely wouldn't come back unless some changes were made and kinks were smoothed out.", "author": "Ashlie C."}

Each nigiri was like a new taste experience and the whole meal was like an adventure. The other side dishes and dessert were delicious especially the scallops and foie gras (one of the best scallop experiences I have had). The atmosphere was great except the music skipped a few times... but not enough for me to be bothered, just something I noticed.

We didn't have trouble making reservations on Friday for Friday evening (lots of open spots). They had a solid selection of wine, beer, and sake and generous pours. We got the Omakase and everything was excellent and fresh; standouts for me included the Amberjack, Otoro w/ grated radish, and the ultra-fresh uni. Each piece of nigiri was meticulously hand crafted and had it's own unique combinations of sauces and garnishes. The experience also felt authentic and intimate, all sushi was eaten with the hands and the chefs at the counter were really personable and took time to explain the dishes and have 1:1 talks with all the diners. at $79pp the price is definitely on the low-end for a well-crafted well-sourced Omakase in San Francisco, but the dining experience was on par with any other high-end sushi restaurant in the city.

Bon Nene has opened on 21st and the old American Grilled Cheese place is going to be serving up Edomae sushi, apparently. Wow! But, regarding Sushi Hon, we thought it was pretty good overall. We dropped a fair amount of money on the sushi omakase plus a pair of otoro on top and two beers. Nice quality fish and options you don't see all the time.

This place is new and has some rough edges, but the food itself is just absolutely incredible.  Omakase is 70 per person, which while fairly pricey, actually was better than almost any other that I've had that was more expensive. All their dishes are AMAZING, and their nigiri is just like butter - honestly some of the best I've had. What I loved was that they really took some risks with some clearly experimental dishes (mixed in some korean fusion) but they turned out just fantastic and delicious - every single one delivered, which is so rare. Though this place needs to improve a little bit more around ambiance (they had a broken set of lights that were distracting) and service (took a while for us to get seated and there was a used napkin on my seat), the food alone easily justifies the 5 stars.
