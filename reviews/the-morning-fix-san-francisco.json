That should tell you how good this breakfast spot is. \n\nHundreds of breakfast spots in San Francisco, and I chose the same one on this short vacation. The sandwich bagels are soft and filled with amazingly tasteful ingredients.\n\nI ordered the good ol bacon egg and cheese on a cheese bagel with cream cheese added(a must for cheese lovers like myself) ... Nothing like any other breakfast sandwich I've ever had. My finance had the San Francisco sandwich on cheese bagel and the look on her face was enough for me to see she was in breakfast heaven(if such a thing exists).\n\nTo accompany our sandwiches we ordered the blended ice Green Tea and Vanilla lattes. These drinks put all other Cafe's to shame. The perfect blend of flavor and ingredients to create the ideal consistency for a blended drink. \n\nThe place is very clean, the staff is very nice and accommodating of any requests for omissions and substitutions.\n\nYou would be crazy to stop in San Francisco and not eat at The Morning Fix!!", "author": "Jose M."}

Yelling around my place, I found this joint and boy did the pictures help! Best thing of all, it's a block away!\n\nWalking up to this joint, I noticed a bunch of folks sitting outside conversing. What a cool neighborhood joint. Walking inside, it was a bit busy. Electronics that didn't seem to work: an hour of order ATM, a couple of computers a big fan. Aside from that, there are tables and window bar seating, a coffee station, drink station and refrigerated counters filled with pastries. I think the owner just tried packing as much into this small hole in the wall as possible. \n\nFor my breakfast, I got a hot Tea for $2.00. They have 10 different flavors to choose from. I also got the Breakfast croissant for $4.75. You can choose from bacon, sausage or ham. I chose the ham, also came with cheese and egg. Overall it was a good sandwich. Buttery, flavorful. Nothing to jump out of your seat about but I love how quick it was. \n\nThis place offers so much! All your morning staples including bagels, pastries, eggs and more. They do offer lunch items but breakfast seems to be their sweet spot. One thing I liked about this place were the friendly people. It's like everyone knew everyone.

Pretty good reviews, but I'm instantly put off by grab and go, especially at breakfast. I also have dietary restrictions that were impossible to please during my stay in San Francisco. This is not the fault of The Morning Fix, rather the epiphany I had while \"dining\" here. I ordered a sausage egg and cheese on an English muffin. It was fairly bland so I piled on the hot sauce to make it palatable. Not bad, but I found this basic place more expensive than it needed to be. Also, the menu is a complete disaster. It's mostly pictures, which is fine, but much of it is blocked off by other pictures of what they offer. On top of that, there were printed out pages randomly taped to the menu.

I was in need of some much needed quality breakfast food and this place was the golden ticket.  Got some English Breakfast tea with a Salmon Lox Bagel Sandwich and it was perfection!  Last night was exhausting and I needed high quality food to energize me for a Napa Excursion that morning.  I patiently waited in a short line and then chilled outside for a bit to people watch on the streets.\n\nThe salmon was so good and fresh it seemed.  The cream cheese or whatever they used was also on point.  The quick brunch was also reasonably priced, it seems like a very well run mom and pops like joint.  There are plenty of other options for bagel breakfast or brunch sandwiches.  Will be back if I'm in the area again for sure!  I love how they are so many great places in this neighborhood within walking distance.  \n\nThere was quite a line and they get relatively busy with many other young people stopping by for a bite or to hang out.  There are some old computers here you can use to get on the internet... I guess it's for travelers.  Can't imagine that they actually charge for use of it, haha.

It was a good portion. It looked small compared to burritos I've had like from El Farlito but I guess it's the perfect size for breakfast. There was definitely no skimping in this burrito! I love it! Maybe a tad bit too much cheese but that's because I'm not one to go nuts over cheese. I wish i was able to have this be delivered to me every day!

It was a last minute decision based slowly on who had power on in the city and was serving breakfast! I had the Italian bagel which was awesome and my boyfriend had a ham and cheese sandwich which he seemed to enjoy.

I had their soy chai latte and it was yummy.  I always support mom-n-pop places (or rather, mom-n-mom places in this case), even though the Cash Only policy bugs me a little.
