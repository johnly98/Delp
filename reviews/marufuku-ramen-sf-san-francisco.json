Probably the BEST ramen place in SF (I guess l haven't tried all of it but I've tried most of the really popular places and hands down marufuku is the winner) \n\nThe line is always long but that's why the yelp waitlist exists (you're on yelp rn! Get on it after this review!) and there's a bunch of cute stores nearby to check out while you wait. \n\nThe service is prompt and attentive. Sometimes they combine your party with other parties if both groups are small so you might even make new friends. Or sit in close proximity and ignore each other as you get fully absorbed in the greatness that is marufuku.\n\nThe Hakata deluxe is great; meat was tender, broth was creamy, and egg was cooked to that perfect golden (not light yellow but GOLD). Your stomach will be full, your heart will be happy, and you will be about $20 short (tax and tip included) of your money-- but you'll remember the taste and that's priceless.", "author": "Carmel M."}

All I know is this place's ramen is top class and was well worth the waitlist.\n\nWhere do I begin? You're not looking for a dining experience here. You're not looking for excellent service. What are you looking for? Possibly one of the best dang Japanese ramen spots that you can go to. But there's a reason for the ridiculously long wait time. Heads up San Francisco, join the waitlist so you don't have to wait forever to actually grab a table. \n\nI waited about 1-1 1/2 hrs on the waitlist on a Friday night. You need to be within a 3 mile radius to be on it. After waiting, I ended up sharing a table with another couple. If your party is 2 or lower, you're going to be doing this so don't freak out or anything. \n\nThis places atmosphere was pretty nice- dim lights, Japanese decor, etc. The service was good enough for how busy it was. I was quickly provided their cucumber/mint water and was asked what I wanted to order.\n\nWhat did I get? The Hakata Tonkotsu medium. The couple next to me kept on saying that the mild broth wasn't nearly as good as the medium. So take that with a bowl of noodles, I mean grain of sand. I would recommend going this route because having too spicy of a broth is going to kill the experience.\n\nJust wow. The broth was rich, had a beautiful pork flavor, was perfectly seasoned, and was well balanced. The noodles were cooked to perfection- they still had a nice bite to them and were a perfect vessel for carrying more of that broth onto my tastebuds. The toppings accompanied the bowl perfectly. The chashu was fantastic and the soft-boiled egg was nice and runny- this is one of the few times where not having a typical soy-sauce, soft-boiled egg was okay. \n\nWith this in mind, I ended up devouring my bowl. I rarely drink most of my broth, but I finished over half of it this time. For anyone reading, I would highly recommend getting extra noodles if you tend to eat a lot! That's pretty much my only gripe, but then again the portion size is perfect for most people that don't enjoy eating themselves into a food coma.... *looks in the mirror*\n\nSo in summary, this is probably the best ramen place I've ever been to, and I don't use the word \"best\" lightly. I'll be back at this place Terminator 2 style. Until then, everyone should check this place out!", "author": "Nick Y."}

Prior to this, I did not understand why my gf had developed an obsession with ramen after her trip to Japan. Now I completely get it, and I'm sold on it!\n\nWe began with some bao pork buns, which were fresh and tasty. My gf and her daughter both had hakata tonkosu pork ramens, spicy and mild, respectively. Their ramens were delicious. Fresh, flavorful, and not greasy. I had spicy chicken paitan ramen, which was equally excellent, the combination of flavor and textures was just wonderful. \n\nI'm not an expert on Japanese cuisine, but my gf is, and we both agree that this was a food highlight of our trip.\n\nIf you are not from SF like me, I recommend that you bring your patience. We had to wait nearly 2 hours to get a table. Fortunately, the place is located in a plaza with lots of other stores to see and they have an organized waitlist system.

Parking is street or structure. Most likely you will have to pay for parking so there is no avoiding it unfortunately (this is SF after all). We arrived about 30 minutes before opening and were second in line. By the time the restaurant was about to open, there was already a long line that formed behind us. Also, your party is only 2, be prepared to share your table with another group if that table is large enough to fit more people.\n\nIf you are not lucky enough to make it in with the first wave, the restaurant uses Yelp as a waiting list. Last time my gf wanted to try this place out but the wait list was over 100 people? INSANE! \n\nHere is what we ordered: \n\nMARUFUKU BITES 6.50 - Japanese Steamed Buns Filled with Homemade Pork Chasu \nCHICKEN KARAAGE 6.50 - Japanese Style Fried Chicken\nHAKATA DELUXE 16.99 - Hakata Style Ramen with Rich Pork Broth Buta Kakuni (Braised Thick Pork Belly), Chashu Pork (Simmered Pork Belly), Seasoned Soft Boiled Egg, Green Onions, Kikurage Mushrooms, Bean Sprouts, Sweet Corn, and Nori Seaweed.\n\nThe ramen was the highlight here obviously especially the broth. The richness of the pork broth was very apparent with the first sip. You soon enter pork heaven and with each taste of the broth you realize that your bowl is almost empty. \n\nOverall it was what I expected in ramen. It was quite delicious but the real question is if I would wait potentially 2+ hours for it, well due to the fact that you can just sign up on the waitlist and shop around the area without actually waiting at the restaurant then I would say that this spot is a place not to miss next time you are in the SF area and craving some ramen!", "author": "Charlton C."}

The pickled ginger added an interesting depth and the molten egg was perfect. I'm glad I ordered an extra egg! \n\nThe chashu rice bowl ($6.50 that included sweet corn and a molten egg) was less impressive: I had a small taste and the ground pork tasted mealy. My little boy said he liked it but his tone lacked enthusiasm.\n\nThe unpleasant surprise was the bottle of Hitachino White beer that cost $11.50 for a single bottle (gulp). \n\nNote to self: Don't order from a splashy photo on the menu.\n\nAnother less-than-pleasing note was the staff began sweeping up the dining room floor as we were in the midst of our meal. \n\nWhile we were dining past their 3pm close, it was an unsanitary step, especially since the restaurant was still about 40% full. \n\nGiven the overall experience, I'm a little mystified why Marufuku Ramen generates 2 hour waits given the plethora of good ramen spots all around the city and in Japantown. \n\nMarufuku is good and I'd probably return but between the wait and the other small issues, they're on the list but not yet at the top.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

I've tasted my fair share of ramen in the Bay Area, but Marufuku Ramen takes the title of best ramen I've had by far.\n\nMarufuku Ramen is located in the heart of Japantown inside Japan Center on the 2nd level. Japantown is a pretty touristy area altogether so this place is always packed! Make sure to sign your name and phone number on their computer located by the entrance, so you can be placed on the waitlist. The queue is always very full so be patient. We came here pretty early just before lunch time and the wait was already 1 hour. Though it does help that it's located inside Japan Center so you can go into the shops to pass the time. \n\nOnce we were seated the first thing you notice is how amazing the ambiance and atmosphere of this place is. The design is somewhat vintage Japanese with a modern twist. Just right by the back of the wall, you'll notice the kitchen staff hard at work on the meal that you're about to eat. The place is lightly dimmed, which gives it more of a cozy feel. The decor was pretty stylish as well. Once we got inside the wait staff were quick to acknowledge us and get us going with our meal.\n\nNow onto the food. We ordered the Fried Calamari for appetizer which cost us $8. We thought it was ok. Pretty basic and portion was pretty tiny. Not for the main course and what we came for, the ramen! My friend and I ordered the opposing ramens. Hers, the ever so popular pork belly ramen. As for me, since I've always gone to ramen shops and ordered pork, I decided to give the chicken ramen a try. I've always been very skeptical of chicken in any soup form since they're very quick to dry out the chicken. Each order of the chicken ramen comes with a side of sizzling grilled chicken, all for $18. It was a bargain for the amount of chicken you get! You also get a quarter chicken in the ramen itself.  The grilled chicken was the most finger licking, softest juicest chicken there ever was in my belly! The flavor was amazing and each bite blesses your palette with greatness. The ramen was amazing as well. The chicken broth was out of this world flavorful, and rich. I usually have trouble slurping down all the broth, but this was one was so good, I just couldn't think of leaving any behind! The boiled egg on the other hand, was a little too solid for my liking, but it good enough. \n\nMarufuku Ramen is a place I will definitely keep coming back to. The prices are great for the quality you are getting. The portions are generous, the taste of the food is absolutely top notch, the ambiance/atmosphere beautiful, and the to top it all off, they have great customer service. If you're ever in town in search of a great ramen place, or simply craving to taste a great bowl of tasty food, stop by and you will not be disappointed.

I ordered my tonkotsu in spicy and it was AMAZING! Something about their spice is so smooth and mixes well in the ramen. At other places they sort of just dollop the spice on top and it's usually the kind of spicy that hits the back of your throat.

They asked us if we would be okay sharing a table with another party of 2. We agreed until we were taken to a booth with a couple sitting on the opposite sides on it. Sharing a table meant sitting at the same booth as a different party. It seemed odd and awkward they would place two different parties together on one booth. It showed they weren't really interested in good customer experience but rather getting people in and out as fast as possible. I wasn't really in the mood to sit side by side with a stranger or have my side uncomfortably touch the other's bag on the booth seat... We said no and waited for a table that wasn't shared. \n\n3. The food is... overhyped. The ramen was okay. We got the pork ramen but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I did have high expectations since the wait was so long though. BUT - The pork buns are delicious though. Definitely get these. If anything, get multiple pork buns and no ramen.\n\n4. The price is reasonable. $12.99 for the basic and $15.99 for the deluxe ramen.\n\n5. The interior is nice.

The restaurant isn't very big, so I understand why the wait time is so long, but I wish the waitlist system was more accurate.  \n\nOur party of two ended up sharing a two-top with another couple, which they asked us about and we were fine with, but I was slightly annoyed that we were sat about 5 minutes before the other party, yet the staff took their orders and brought out their food first, even though we were ready pretty quickly.\n\nWe ordered the chicken karaage and Hakata deluxe, which has the thick pork belly and chasu pork.  The karaage was not worth ordering.  Being fried chicken, it tasted good, but the batter was oily and overall not as good as other places.  The ramen itself was delicious, but my main critique is that the soft-boiled egg wasn't extremely plain.  Most ramen restaurants marinate their eggs in a sauce to give it flavor, but Marafuku's egg was very bland and didn't impart much to the dish.\n\nOverall, the ramen was good, although if you want the deluxe ramen, it'll set you back $17 a bowl, I wouldn't consider Marafuku worth the hype and the extremely long wait during popular times.  If there wasn't such a long wait, I'd consider coming back here, but there are other ramen restaurants that I'd go to first.", "author": "Kelsey P."}

At Marufuku I guess 120 minutes isn't quite too long of a wait....partially b/c of their wonderful e-check-in and queue alert system and of course, their ramen!\n\nWhen arriving there is a little kiosk stand at the entrance which allows for electronic sign-in onto their list. You are then alerted via smartphone text how many others are ahead of you. You are now free to leave and roam un-tethered. When your place in the invisible e-line nears, you will be alerted to return back. Wonderful concept. Without this system in place, I would never have waited this long. I am sure that I wouldn't be alone either with that fact.\n\nThe wait time is obvi the longest during weekends. That's when I had no choice in going b/c of out of town guests in tow. Holiday weekend to boot. Ugh! Oh well. Been there before so I knew what I was getting myself into. My guests weren't so sure....only until after they had finished their meal here too.\n\nWhen our turn arrived we were promptly seated and ordered. Two pitchers of ice cold adult beverages later, the pain of the 2-hour wait had subsided. Our table all ordered their Hakata DX with medium spice. The service and delivery of goods to our table was fast and efficient. \n\nThe bowl of ramen is the best I have had. Ever. No doubt about it. It's not even close.\n\nThe broth in any ramen is the key. The 1985 film Tampopo definitely comes to mind when savoring the other-worldly broth of Marufuku. Flavors so deep with multiple layers of subtle deliciousness. Very, very difficult to put into words. Really! Kinda like trying to describe what you saw if you ever 'Saw God'. \n\nNo, I don't purport to seeing any deity while imbibing in Marufuku's broth, but it was close. \n\nDefinitely willing to go thru their wait time gauntlet in order to experience their ramen again in the future. Best to go during the week before or after the lunch time crush. Maybe 15 minutes before they open even.\n\nDefinitely!", "author": "william s."}

But, guess what?  It ain't as bad as it looks if you do your homework.\n\nI actually tried to come about a month before dining here but the line was long and I had a medical appointment.  As a result, I was more organized and able to enjoy my lunch within minutes of arriving on my next attempt.\n\nAfter a short wait, I was seated at a two seat table near the entrance and promptly given a menu.  It isn't particularly large and, after doing an internal debate, I decided to try their Hakata deluxe ramen (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1ndoOYZIJDvDtcSIJ35wtA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  The ingredients were all there and the flavors were good and meshed very well together.  It is deceiving as you need to flip the noodles and mix the ingredients to fully appreciate your bowl of ramen.  The meat was tender and soft and the other ingredients (egg, corn, seaweed, etc) brought a variety of textures and flavors as a nice change.\n\nWanting to try more things, I ordered a Kakuni bowl (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JfS5FBCNzDUnM6cBsGCh3A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) for home.  Not wanting to change the texture of the ingredients by reheating, I ate this for dinner that evening.  It did not disappoint as, cold or hot, the integrity of the rice and flavors kept well.\n\nSome friends complained about the MSG level in the broth but I had no such problem.  Service was prompt and efficient as they clearly want to flip the tables for the waiting patrons.  It kind of reminded me of Japan in the order, eat, pay, and go concept.  Now, the trick in cutting that waiting time.  Use your Yelp app and lock in on a time estimate and time your check in on your phone as you are coming.  Trust me, this will save you a lot of anxiety as well as time.", "author": "Mike C."}

After exploring town all day, my then-fianc\u00e9 and I found ourselves in Japan town during dinner time. With high ratings and with almost 1,500 reviews, we had to see what's up. This place was true a 4.5 Stars for me like what the Yelp average rating is. The best time to come here is right when they open as there is no wait time. Otherwise, you can use the Yelp app to put yourself on the Waitlist, which I highly recommend. I put myself on the list as we were about an hour away and we got there just on time to check in. Now, that's winning big on time for us, impatient New Yorkers! \n\nMy now-hubby and I got the Karaage Fried Chicken to start with and the two deluxe ramen bowls: Hataka and Chicken Paitan. Karaage Fried Chicken was nicely fried and crispy and the squeeze of lemon juice was just perfect. Hataka is the braised pork belly ramen bowl. It was super hearty and the broth was so flavorful. Ramen noodles' texture was perfect as well. Poached egg was perfectly gooey! The garnish green onions added a nice aroma to it. This bowl was porky delicious! Chicken Paitan was also really good! The menu says that there are only limited 15 servings each day. To my surprise, we made it! Grilled Chicken Leg was grilled with soy sauce flavor and it was really good! Chicken Paitan is much cleaner in taste. Either bowl, you're making the right choice! \n\nAwesome ramen bowl!!!", "author": "Cynthia D."}

However, I think that if I came back, I would order the regular hakata and just order more of the sliced meat instead of the thick pork belly that came with the deluxe.

I've tried to wait but my hanger gets the best of me and my poor poor husband having to tolerate my darkest hanger moments. The first three times we tried to dine in Marufuku we ended up going to neighboring restaurants in the japan center.\n\nThe fourth time I got smarter! I went during lunch on a weekday with some coworkers! YATA! the wait was only 30-40mins, what a score!  practically all of my coworkers ordered the Hakata deluxe and wow it was amazing. For the price per bowl (~$17) there were a lot of meat in the ramen. With that said the meat was really well cooked. It was so tender that it would almost fall apart when I pick it up with the chopstick. It was so well seasoned that I can taste the distinct flavor of the pork versus the broth. The noodle was very will cooked, it wasn't soft nor was it under cooked. Note: at first I thought I didn't get an egg, but it at the bottom of the bowl. Since I didn't discover the egg when the ramen was first served it was a little bit more cooked than I liked. \n\nOverall I definitely would like to dine here again for the food but.... the wait....

However, if you can brave the line then what awaits is a mouthwatering bowl of ramen.\n\nMarufuku offers mainly two different types of ramen; one based on pork broth and one based on chicken. I've only had their pork broth so the review will be based on those. Marufuku has two different options, deluxe and regular. The only difference between the two is that the deluxe option comes with a fat slice of pork with a good sear on one side leaving it soft and melty on the other and in the middle and a $4 increase (maybe $5 I don't remember). Either way the real star of their ramen is their mouthwatering tonkatsu broth. I've had a good amount of tasty ramen (mostly from LA) and this stuff bests most of them. Something about the creaminess and the fact that their spicy is the perfect amount for my taste buds make this ramen so freaking good. The ramen is priced much more reasonably than Ippudo IMO so I'll definitely choose Marufuku anyday.\n\nParking around here is fairly easy, just park in the parking structure close by and it's less than a 5 minute walk to the restaurant. The only issue is their wait, but you can join the virtual waitlist if it's open so keep your eyes out for that to minimize your actual wait time at the store. \n\nP.S. their bowls are aesthetic af so there's that if you're a person really looking for a good IG photo.", "author": "Matthew L."}

There's amazing food all around us and soooo many hole in the wall restaurants that are truly authentic. \n\nFirst of all, the price is ridiculous. I understand it's good food but they're totally taking advantage of their hype. I can buy 2 ramens for the price of this one anywhere else.\n\nSecond of all, the broth was my favorite part! It was very unique, different than any other broth I've tried before. It was savory and had some unique flavors. The noodles, on the other hand, I liked but didn't prefer. It was still cooked REALLY GOOD and chewy just how I like them, not soft at all. My personal opinion is that I prefer the traditional ramen noodles with a kink in them as opposed to the straight spaghetti style noodles, that's all.\n\nThirdly, not sure if this is just me but I thought the bowl was kind of small compared to other ramens that I've had! It wasn't tiny, but I found it to be average sized while other ramens I've had before are quite large. \n\nMy other favorite locations add roasted garlic cloves and black garlic oil for a more affordable cost and larger portion, was still tasting FREAKING DELICIOUS!

With all the reviews, I had to give Marufuku a shot. \n\nAs a party of 2, we came at 4:55 pm on a Sunday afternoon. Not surprised by he long line wrapping around the lower floor staircase, we waited our turn up till around 5:20 or so to put our name down on the waiting list. Yelp has a great feature called Waitlist which allows you to see how many people are in front of you, all with the convenience of an app. \n\nFirst impression: the restaurant is very small. The place probably seats 45-50 customers. The lighting isn't great. There are big booths for the larger party which seemed more comfortable than the two person table we were seated at- wooden seats with a firm cushion. The menu is simple with offerings of appetizers, 3 types of ramen, and some sake locally sourced out of San Francisco. \n\nTakoyaki: 4/5 Just your basic takoyaki-tastes like the frozen takoyaki thrown into a fryer. Crisp exterior with soft gooey dough on the inside and some pieces of octopus and ginger. \nRamen: 5/5 Ouch, $17 for a bowl of ramen? I'm not gonna lie. I felt a bit cheated but the serving size was really big. But man, take one sip of that broth and you're won over. The broth is creamy and rich- perfect balance of savory flavors from the pork bones. The noodles are cooked perfectly. I didn't care for the pork belly, it was dry and nothing special about it. However, the chasu pork was extremely tender, fatty, and flavorful. Hands down, the best chasu pork I've tasted in my life. It had a rich smoky flavor to it. I highly appreciate that a full soft boiled egg was included in our ramen- unlike other ramen places that only serve half an egg. \n\nThe prices here are a little discouraging. $17 for a bowl of ramen seems steep.

The chicken breast meat wasn't anything special. Almost a bit tough to eat. The broth tho was very good. \n\nRamen - looked like wonton noodles/angel hair noodles.

I got the ultra spicy and for me it wasn't that spicy. So your call to try! Just remember food should taste good ! Not spicy where you can't even eat it anymore!\n\nTakoyaki - it's good . The octopus inside wasn't tough like most other places \n\nChicken Karaage - my friend said it's too salty . I thought it was fine. It seems like the meat was marinated so there's a nice flavor. It wasn't juicy or soft . Cooked a bit too long maybe \n\nNever know or believe till you try it yourself .  #jessteatit", "author": "Myron L."}

Everything tastes fresh and is cooked to the perfect amount of doneness.\n\nI've also eaten at Marufuku's sister location in Oakland and it was the same quality of food. The decor also gets a plus from me - understated and simple, but it's a good atmosphere and the place doesn't feel too crowded.\n\nI didn't get a chance to try the Chicken Paitan, but I did have some of the appetizers (edamame and the chicken karaage) and they were excellent additions to my meal.\n\nThe servers and waitstaff were very attentive and I had a great experience - we never felt like we were being rushed out of our seats and they came by frequently to fill our water and check if there was anything they could do to improve our dining experience and meal.\n\nI'm taking a star because of two things: the wait, and the parking. Parking in Japantown can be challenging, and this is especially true if you are coming here on a weekend or during an event.  It is possible to find street parking, but it's a bit of a nightmare, you have to get lucky, you have to be good at parallel parking, and otherwise it is paid parking that to my knowledge cannot be validated.\n\nThe wait is a whole other story. They do have an automated system with Yelp, but my friend and I arrived on a Sunday before opening and not including the wait before the restaurant opened, we still ended up waiting about 45-60 minutes before we got a table. I've heard the wait can be 2-3 hours if you're unlucky or if you don't plan around the meal. That said, there is a lot to do around Japan Center SF and in the surrounding areas, so if you plan to eat here, just time things correctly so you don't end up wasting a couple hours of your time.", "author": "Yvonne L."}

I've been on the hunt for a good ramen place in SF, and I can finally say mission accomplished.    \n\nI normally prefer my ramen noodles thicker, especially if it's in a thick Tonkatsu broth, but this place serves delicate, thin ramen noodles, so I went in with very low expectations.  However, I can say that I am now completely converted and I'm on that thin ramen noodle train (who said thicker was better??).   What converted me was the combination of the bouncy, springy noodles with the flavorful broth.  The broth left me speechless; it was rich, mouthwatering, savory, distinctive, spicy....the list goes on.  It was a religious experience. \n\nWe ordered both the chicken and pork broth options, and I'm conflicted as to which one is better. They were both singular and delicious in their own ways, and equally jam-packed with flavor.  The best surprise was the soft-boiled egg hidden beneath all that glorious ramen noodles.  Normally at ramen restaurants, you have to order your own soft-boiled egg at an additional cost, but this place was complimentary.  We also ordered the Takoyaki as an appetizer, but to be honest, it was overshadowed by the amazing ramen.\n\nWe arrived at 12pm on a Friday, and put ourselves on the waitlist in front of the restaurant.  There were about 30 parties ahead of us, but we only waited about an hour.  This is because service is very very quick.  We ordered our food and received our ramen within 5 minutes.

This ramen shop is known for two items -  Hakata-style tonkotsu ramen (broth cooked for over 20 hours) and chicken paitan ramen (both ramen are always available). One of items on the menu (Chicken Paitan Deluxe - basically chicken paitan ramen with an extra grilled chicken leg side dish) is limited to 15 servings (the menu did not specify whether the limitation is per day or per lunch / dinner meal). When our group got here at 4:30 PM, the line had already started and it eventually went all the way back to Izumiya 15 minutes later (about 25+ people waiting). The door opened at 5 PM on Sunday and my friend was able to order Chicken Paitan Deluxe without any issues. You can choose spicy level for your ramen.\n\n***\n\nHakata Tonkotsu (Chashu Pork [Simmered Pork Belly], Seasoned Soft Boiled Egg, Green Onions, Kikurage Mushrooms, and Bean Sprouts - medium spicy, $12.99): Since I was still full from my previous lunch (tacos and a half burrito from La Taqueria), I didn't get chicken paitan deluxe and only ordered a bowl of ramen. Pork belly was well marinated and it was really flavorful with melt-in-your-mouth texture. Broth was also extremely flavorful with medium spicy level gave a nice tingling sensation (personally spicy level was just right). I really liked their thin noodle and noodle texture was great. Overall this bowl of ramen was well-balanced and rich flavors.\n\n***\n\nI tried a lot of ramen places in Southern California and I am really impressed with Marufuku.

This ramen spot is notorious for having super long waits, and after trying it out for myself, the lines are definitely very long. We came at around 5:10pm on a Sunday night, and there was already a long line formed outside the door to check in on the waitlist at the front. Luckily, there's a lot of stores around the restaurant, so walking around Japantown really helps kill some time. In total, we waited around 1.5 hours to get a seat, and we ended up being seated at a combined table where we shared a bench table with another two people party. This ramen spot is definitely not conducive for large parties, and I would recommend coming with either one or two other people, or else the wait could be even longer.\n \nTheir menu is very simple, with choices of either a tonkatsu or chicken based ramen. I went for the Hakata tonkatsu ramen, and it was the perfect amount of food for me. To my surprise, the ramen was very good! I am usually not a fan of hakata style, thin-noodle ramen, but the one at Marufuku was perfectly cooked and rich in flavor. The broth was the perfect, milky-creamy flavor, and the added kick from the spicy oil made it even more delicious.

An hour minimum is likely, but thankfully you can check in on the Yelp app or tablet they have up front. I don't think this is the fault of the restaurant though, as it's actually quite spacious... which means the reason it takes so long is because people take forever to finish their ramen.\n\nLet me just say that ramen is supposed to be THE antisocial food. You get it, you eat it in ten minutes or less, and you leave. Unfortunately, it seems that everyone has friends and they all like to \"socialize\" while eating... heathens. The line would move quicker if barriers were put up between seats.\n\nI'm kidding, but for real, eat your ramen fast otherwise it stops tasting good.\n\nOnto the food...\n\nI ordered the Hakata-style tonkotsu, and the first thing I did was taste the broth. Such a bold, clean flavour without being too salty. The noodles had a firm, al dente bite to them, and they did a really great job holding onto the flavour of that pork broth. I started tearing up a little bit as I was eating; I'm not too sure if it was because of the steam from the hot broth, or because I was so happy I finally managed to find a good bowl of ramen in SF, but I'll accept both answers. It's just a really nice and balanced tasting bowl of ramen, and you feel like you can keep on eating forever because it's not heavy at all, despite being a tonkotsu broth.\n\nBonus points to the shape of the bowl too. As a user experience designer, I was pretty delighted by the spout on the side of the bowl that made it easy to drink the broth when you were done with the noodles.\n\nI also ordered the mentaiko rice bowl, which... was lacking in comparison to the ramen. The rice was a bit mushy and it didn't really taste like much. I'll forgive this one though because it's a ramen restaurant, not a rice bowl restaurant.\n\nService was fast and attentive, as I never had to ask for water refills, or wait too long for my bill when I was finished. I was really surprised at the speed they brought my food; it was something like two minutes from the time I ordered, which is insane considering how busy they were. \n\nAfter weeks of trying different ramen around the city and being disappointed every time, it was Marufuku that ended up delivering.

Karaage brought out first and the Ramen came out shortly after, was served with a small (children's) bowl, but was quickly swapped out for a normal bowl. I thought this small attention to detail was commendable. I was in no way offended and liked the kid's bowl, but love that kind of consideration on their part.\n\nKaraage - Really impressed by the karaage here, perfectly crisp batter, but not heavy or greasy at all. The chicken was cooked perfectly, was juicy and the appetizer came out piping hot served with a lime wedge. Definitely, one of the best karaage's I've had in a long, long time. Great texture, simply delicious. It's incredible to think people can get fried chicken wrong, but they do ... Marufuku knows how to do it right!\n\nTonkotsu Ramen - Super creamy Tonkotsu broth, lovely and fatty. Tbh, I was skeptical because of the straight noodles, but I must say ... I may have been converted. With an aversion to straight ramen noodles in the past due to it reminding me of angel hair pasta or not being cooked well I feel that Marafuku has changed my ways.

At this point, I was still wiling to give this place 5-stars, even 6-stars, if the ramen was sugoiiiii. However, this was no so :(. Lemme break it down:\n\n- Noodles: perhaps the most important component of the ramen. Thin noodles, not too soft, not too firm, good flavor, but didn't taste super fresh. When I asked them where they get the noodles from, the waitress responded that they were \"home-made\". I immediately, follow-up with \"do you make them here?\" To which she replied, \"No, we make them in a factory.\" Not sure how that's homemade, but maybe the space is just small and they don't have the room. When I asked how often they transport the noodles from the factory to the restaurant, she did not know. Another waiter was listening to our convo and budged in and said \"every day.\" I'll let you, the reader, decided this for yourself, but I was unconvinced.\n\n- Broth: by far, the best part of the ramen. The broth is rich with flavor, however it does tend to be relatively thin. I prefer thicker broth, but that is just a preference, no harm done here. If you get the spicy broth, make sure you mix it well, since all the spices tend to fall towards the bottom.\n\n- Pork: I was unimpressed with the pork. Too salty, too thin in my opinion. I does have good flavor though.. I haven't tried other options, but there's a reason most people order Hakata Tonkatsu. \n\nOverall, I can only give 5 stars to ramen shops I've been to in Japan, and I can only give 4 stars to two ramen shops in the Bay Area: Iza and Mensho. To everyone out there that showed up at Marafuku at 9pm only to find out the waitlist was 50 people they had no room to serve you... don't be so sad, being a Marafuku reject isn't the worst thing in the world ;)", "author": "Vasiliy M."}

So good that we go every weekend and all the workers know us by now :D We've tried the Marufuku in Oakland to compare (slightly less wait, prices are slightly lower which makes up for the bridge fare) which is similar but somehow the broth is just better at the original SF location.\n\nThe wait is a beast on the weekends. We recommend either getting to Marufuku 20-25 minutes before opening to wait in line (with about a 75% chance of getting first seating on the weekends with this method) or waiting until about 12PM when they open up the yelp waitlist and putting your name down and planning to arrive 1-2 hours after. Street parking is free on Sundays and plentiful in the late morning/early afternoon unless there is a festival or special event nearby. \n\nHakata Tonkatsu HANDS DOWN! The broth is where the $$$ is at! It is really the best broth I have ever had, and as a ramen fan who has lived in Tokyo, New York, LA, and SF, I can safely tell you this is the BEST. The noodles are thin and vermicelli like which can be a disappointment for those who like thick al dente ramen noodles, but I think the thinness of the noodles soaks up the flavor of the amazing broth. The egg was initially inconsistent but for the last 4-5 visits has been consistently soft boiled with a runny yolk :) The pork is usually melt-in-your-mouth good, although once in a while it can be a bit chewy (I would say the consistency of the meat is about 50%). Since they opened over a year ago the consistency has gotten much better and recently we have had consistently perfect bowls of ramen (good broth, good meat, good egg).\n\nThe buta kakuni bowl and chicken katsu are also delish. The chicken paitan dx comes with a glazed grilled chicken quarter that is extremely moist and tasty - I don't know how they do that!

I think they prioritize everyone already there waiting.\n\nFor the order- I got the Hakata Tonkatsu (spicy). The Hakata DX is just with a bigger chunk of meat & corn. They also have an ultra spicy, and I would totally be down to opt in for that next time. It kinda reminds me of the spicy in the ramen in Japan. SO GOOD. The noodles were thin, a little more firm that I usually like, but still good. The egg was beautiful and cooked to perfection. The pork was a bit salty, soy based. The pickled ginger is ehhh.

Since my boyfriend is not really a ramen person, I was not intending to go here but we were wandering around Japan town and saw the line before it was open and decided to hop in. We were probably close to the 20th person in line and managed to be the last people sat down for the first round. We had to share the big table with another couple who had been seated right before us but that was no big deal.\n\nSince I was not planning on eating here, I had to do my research pretty quickly on what people liked most and what to order. I think it was because I had not eaten before this that I decided to order the Chicken Karrage on top of the ramen. The Chicken Karrage was juicy and flavorful. If you are a fan of this dish normally, it is something I would consider ordering but probably not something I would order again unless craving fried chicken.\n\nFor the main dishes, we ordered the HAKATA DX and the CHICKEN PAITAN DX. I feel like when something on the menu says limited servings, obviously your eyes wander there. The grilled chicken on the side came out first and it smelled and looked super good. It was on a sizzling plate so that made it look even more delicious. The meat just fell off the bone, was super flavorful and had so much flavor. I would recommend ordering that dish just for the chicken on the side.\n\nThe broth from the CHICKEN PAITAN DX was our favorite out of the two ramen dishes. It was exactly like described on the menu, rich and full of flavor. It was creamy and smooth and I literally could go back for this probably every week. The HAKATA DX had the pork broth which was also good but it was definitely more rich and more salty. The noodles were a mix between firm and soft, more on the soft side. If you like firmer noodles, you may want to see if they can cook them a little less.\n\nThis place is worth the hype; especially if you are a ramen lover.

I will also note that when you're on the wait list you'll get a call telling you to check in and that your table is ready and the Yelp app will indicate that there is nobody else ahead of you, but be prepared to wait another 15-30 min.", "author": "Sara P."}

This is a MUST VISIT when in SFO...come visit Japantown! It is so quaint & the food is astounding. How can ramen be so good? It has FRESH broth, almost miso but tasty like chicken broth. They add scallions & these deliciously thin mushrooms. And you let them know how spicy. Finally, they top it off with FRESHLY GRILLED chicken breast cut into trips. The flavor combinations are perfect!! Well worth the 30 minute walk from Union Sq.  Hint: Their online waiting system on Yelp is weird. It almost always takes longer than posted.

Our party arrived 30 minutes before opening for dinner and fortunately were the first ones in line on that weekend! :D We waited just a quick (honestly... 30 is short compared to what other ppl have to go through) wait, we were promptly seated and handed the menu. Then came the second hardest part of the Marufuku experience... deciding what to get.\n\nMarufuku really offers you just two choices for ramen (+ a XL version of each). I don't know what it is about small menus like these, but decisions are just SO hard to make because you don't want to regret having one over the other... but you also know for sure that BOTH are going to be good. Of the pork belly or chicken ramen, I got the chicken ramen.. XL version of course.\n\nMy foodcame with the standard chicken ramen as well as a chicken leg on a sizzling plate. \n\nFirst off, the egg was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. It was seasoned SOSOSO well and was the PERFECT runniness. Not a hint of \"hard-boiled\"ness which was actually crazy, considering the egg was served whole (therefore making it prone to being uncontrollably cooked in the ramen too). I would come back and just order a bunch of extra eggs in my ramen if cholesterol wasn't a problem... honest!\n\nThe broth was also very nice. Not too salty and very flavourful. The noodles were a nice level of firmness and size. My only complaint would be the chicken leg. I didn't think the XL was really worth because I found the chicken leg to be noticeable overcooked and lacking flavour. The subtle hints of barbecue flavour that was coating the chicken didn't really compliment the savoriness of the broth.\n\nOverall, very happy with my experience here! No wonder it's so popular :) Can't imagine what it would be like to wait longer than we did though.", "author": "Monica X."}

I chose Medium spicy which is more like mild, so will probably get Spicy next time. The thin noodles are perfectly firm and had a great texture. When eaten with a spoonful of the bean sprouts, kikurage mushroom, braised pork belly and pork broth, you get a mouthful of flavors and textures that will leave you satisfied. The pork belly was great and they did not skimp out on the size of it. I do wish there were more noodles than bean sprouts. Overall the bowl is large and very filling. Don't forget there is a soft boiled egg in there which is on the bottom of the bowl. The egg was good as expected. I dare say their ramen is up to par to the likes of Ippudo if not a little better.\n\nThe structure in the center of the restaurant is strange and doesn't seem to make good use of space. Can probably fit more tables without the structure in the way. I was quite uncomfortable sitting there as there is no back rest and I had to climb over the seating in order to sit down. I can imagine if someone was wearing a dress/skirt it'd be an issue. \n\nThere is a deceiving waitlist option on their yelp page however you actually can't place yourself on the waitlist through the app. You have to physically go to the restaurant to put your name and phone number down via their yelp kiosk that is located in front. The nice thing is you can walk away and shop while monitoring your place in line from the yelp app so you know when you should start heading back. Once you receive a text that you're next make sure to check in with the host within 5 mins or you'll lose your place in line. I waited about an hour with 24 parties ahead of me after joining the waitlist a few mins after 11:30am on Saturday.", "author": "Donna M."}

The broths were excellent. Rich without feeling too heavy; complex and flavorful without being too salty. The noodles are thin but were still perfectly cooked with just the right amount of chewiness.\n\nThe problem is that there's just too much going on in the way of additions. It's a perfect example of how the Americanization of other cultures can turn a beautiful thing into a chaotic mess. Somehow we've gotten to think that you can always make something better just by adding more things to it. It's really my own fault for ordering the \"deluxe\" versions of each dish. The pure ramen itself is great, but in the menu's current form, you end up instead with a cacophony of corn, multiple flavors of meat, way too many vegetables, and nothing to really focus on.

Nearby we couldn't help but notice the growing line at Marafuku Ramen... this was 15 minutes before the place actually opened up!  Our curiosity led to a quick Yelp check resulting in us our decision to get in line as well.\n\nSoon Marafuku opened and as we neared the front, suddenly the line stopped.  The restaurant was at capacity and we ended up using their electronic device (with the Yelp reservation app) to get on the wait list.  The device synched us with Yelp and it continually updated us with our position in the queue.  With the app we were able to enter the bookstore to kill a little time.  We eventually made our way back to the restaurant when we were #2 in the queue.\n\nThe overall wait time was probably 30 minutes.  We were seated, handed menus and served water.  The menu is small, so it took very little time for us to decide what we were going to order.  After seeing that there was a limited serving of (15) Chicken Paitan DX with grilled chicken on the side, we knew that was our choice!  The wifey was content sharing the ramen with me and we ended up getting 2 orders of takoyaki to complete our order.  We had visited B  patisserie that morning, so we weren't super hungry.\n\nThe Chicken Paitan DX had a rich white \"paitan\" broth, chicken chashu, corn, green onions, kikurage mushroom, bean sprouts, a boiled egg and they serve a delicious side of grilled chicken on top of that.  The broth had a milky white color (I believe that's what \"paitan\" means) and really nice depth of flavor... rich, creamy, meaty, very satsifying!\n\nIt was my first time having paitan broth and it was extremely good!  The chicken chashu melted in my mouth and had very nice flavor.  The ramen tasted fresh and was perfectly cooked.  Each bite was a heavenly mixture of textures and flavors and every ingredient complimented the others.  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, you take a bite of that grilled chicken that's super tender, has that nice charred grilled flavor and boom, you're on another level!  Hands down the best ramen I've ever had.\n\nThe takoyaki while good wasn't as good as what we've had here in San Diego.  The restaurant was nice and clean with a nice modern design.  Service was very great (very friendly), our waitress and another checked on us several times.  So the price was high compared to San Diego (I think it was $15.99 or $16.99 for that bowl)... but it seems the price of food in general is a little higher here in San Francisco.\n\nThe ramen was worth the wait!

They also give you a lot of al-dente, thin ramen noodles that grabbed the broth perfectly.\n\nNext off, the braised pork belly. THIS WAS THE BEST PIECE OF PORK BELLY THAT I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Literally falling apart as I was trying to pick it up with my chopsticks, there were so many flavors packed into the many layers of fat and lean meat. The extra $5 for the braised pork belly vs simmered pork belly is definitely worth it.\n\nNext time you're in Japantown, you have to give this place a shot! It'll blow your socks off!", "author": "Cassie Z."}

There's often a long wait during lunch time. There's a reason why this place is hyped. \n\nWhen you arrive, you can sign up on an electronic wait list. You will be served pretty quickly once you are seated and have ordered. The restaurant inside feels clean and has pretty simple decor. The restaurant is not large, so you will be sitting at arm's length (a comfortable arm's length) to the people next to you. The Tonkotsu ramen is the signature dish - you can't go wrong with it. Prices are very reasonable for high quality ramen. \n\nI've only been to Marufuku during lunchtime, although I'm sure they're just as busy in the evenings. Use the Yelp app 30-45 minutes before you arrive to cut down on your wait time. This is critical. 30 seconds of forethought can save you 30-45 minutes of wait time within that same hour.", "author": "Chris W."}

Even better though, it wasn't the exact same bowlful.  The ramen at Marufuku is simply delicious with none of that one-note taste I got at the other place.  \n\nLocated across from Japantown's Kinokuniya, Marufuku has an efficient check-in policy and a menu that's both simple and direct:  2 types of ramen, each with a deluxe version costing a few dollars more.  Two of us opted for the non-deluxe versions of Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen ($11.99) and Chicken Paitan Ramen ($11.99) and shared an order of Takoyaki ($6.50), my favorite Japanese junk food.  \n\nMarufuku's web site says that customers are welcome to customize their ramen orders by choosing broth thickness, noodle firmness, and even the option of extra noodles.  I found none of this necessary.  In fact, the only thing we specified for each bowlful was \"spicy\" as the server asks specifically about this.  \n\nThat broth.  \n\nAlthough I opted for the Chicken Paitan Ramen I must admit that I favored the Hakata Tonkotsu.  The rich, milky broth cooks for over 20 hours and you pretty much understand that with each spoonful.  \n\nMy son had never before tried Takoyaki and bit into his first ball nodding his head, \"I get what you mean by 'the best junk food ever'\" he said.  Dancing with bonita flakes, this is a perfect shareable treat if you absolutely can't wait until your ramen arrives.  \n\nI understand that a wait here is standard practice but on a weekday not long before their lunchtime service was ending, my wait was a reasonable 20 minutes.  I'd waited at least that long at that other place for a pricier, far less satisfying meal.  \n\nMarufuku and I will meet again very soon, I am certain.

It is located at the Japan Center on the 2nd floor across the bookstore. (We almost made the mistake of trying a different place because we couldn't find it from the street and on the first floor). Because of its popularity they pretty much always have a line outside. To make it easier, they have a touch pad at the entrance to add your name and phone number to hold your spot in line. The restaurant will text you a link to follow your place in line and will notify you when your table is ready. While waiting to be seated we were able to explore the 1st and 2nd floors of the center.\n\nLooking into the restaurant itself, it only occupies a small area and there are only about 14 separate tables parties can be seated at (probably why it gets so crowded). The atmosphere is nice with relaxing music and some more modern Japanese seating. \n\nAfter being seated, we were nicely greeted by the friendly wait staff and given menus with some refreshing cucumber and lemon water. One thing to note is the extremely small menu with only 4 different choices of ramen. Of course there are other starter appetizers like chicken karaage, edamame, takoyaki, etc. but we decided to just get ramen. My girlfriend and I both ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen, mine with extra noodles. We were given the option to choose our spiciness from 1-5 (1-No Spicy, 2-Mild, 3-Medium, 4-Spicy, 5-Ultra Spicy). I chose the 3 and she chose the 1. \n\nUnfortunately I think they forgot about our table, but quickly noticed and recovered by providing a free chicken karaage bowl (which was so good!) and our ramen. Although upset at first, everything was made extremely fast, fresh and delicious! Like classic Tonkotsu broth, it was creamy, flavorful and delicious.

There was already a long line when my sis and I arrived right at opening trine: 11:30am.  We were the last to get seated right away without needing to be on the waitlist!\n\nSTAFF:\nNice and efficient--no complaints in service here!\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThis small restaurant is quite nice and felt kinda fancy.  We were asked if we can share our booth seating with the 2 strangers behind, and we said sure! The booth seating was quite deep!\n\nATE:\n\nHAKATA TONKOTSU - $11.99\nHakata style ramen w/rich pork broth, simmered pork belly, soft boiled egg, green onions, kikurage, mushroom and bean sprouts. \nDon't let the tiny bowl fool you because it's actually quite deep. Not a fan of that because I will make a mess, and I don't see much of my food! I had to really dig in there to find the egg. The egg was okay--it was more hard than soft.  The pork was very tender--thinly sliced. I didn't care for the picketer ginger but that's more of a personal taste.  The broth was quite rich and delicious I must say.\n\nHAKATA DX - $15.99\nIt's pretty much the same as the HAKATA TONKOTSU, but with a thick slab of braised pork belly.  So for $4 more, you get that, and it was not impressive.  My sis ordered this and I had some. The braised pork belly was chewy and dry.  Unfortunately her slices of simmered pork belly wasn't as good as mine--it was dry. So yeah I don't recommend getting this.\n\nOverall I had I liked it here and had a good time!", "author": "Tu-Anh N."}

We ordered the chicken karaage and takoyaki to start. Our dishes came out SUPER fast! I bet they already had these already prepared, considering how busy they were. The karaage was just ok, nothing spectacular. I really liked the takoyaki, it was flavorful and wasn't fishy at all. Probably one of the best takoyaki I've had. \n\nI ordered the hakata tonkotsu with medium spice. If you enjoy spicy, I think it would be safe to opt for spicy or ultra spicy as I didn't find medium to be hot at all. I ended up sprinkling a lotttt extra spice into the broth. The broth was very rich and pretty addicting, I found myself still drinking it even after being super full.

The noodles were a bit thinner than I was used to but a good texture nevertheless. The portion was also a pretty decent size. The grilled chicken that came with the Chicken Paitan DX was literally fall-off-the-bone good. The Geso Fry was the perfect amount of crunch without the squid being too chewy, although the portion was super small, and the large sake was enough for us all to have 3 shots each.

You have to put down your name and party size on an iPad, which sends you a text and links to your Yelp account. Pretty neat, in my opinion.\n\nWhen we went, it was unfortunately closer to 1:00 PM. There was a line out the door, and the staff members had removed the iPad because the remaining patrons would take them to closing time. Darn. We went to another ramen restaurant nearby instead.\n\nA few days later, we took our lesson learned and took another crack at eating at Marufuku. We successfully put our name on the list and waited for about 20 minutes. Even though there's not a place to wait and sit, there's the Kinokuniya Bookstore nearby. Super convenient.\n\nWhen we were seated, we stared in awe at the beautiful decor and interior design of the restaurant. It was small, but they were able to accommodate a good number of seats. We ordered shishito peppers and the Hakata Tonkatsu.\n\nThe shishito peppers were disappointing. Flavorless, even with the sauce. The Hakata Tonkatsu, on the other hand, was amazing. The broth was the best part, and my roommate claimed it's the best ramen he's ever had.

Every waiter and waitress was checking on me. I was in and out of there within 30 minutes. My bowl of ramen was $15 and they didn't even charge me for the tea.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-15", "description": "Out of all the reasons why I love my girlfriend, there is one that I'll always cherish more than most: She got me HELLA OBSESSED with ramen. And by ramen I don't mean cup noodles; I'm talking about a steaming bowl of pork broth that's been cooking for 10+ hours.\n\nEver since we started dating, we've been traveling around the Bay Area in hopes of discovering the best ramen shop. She's been faithfully loyal to Santouka (https://www.yelp.com/biz/hokkaido-ramen-santouka-san-jose), whereas I am hooked on Izakaya Sozai (https://www.yelp.com/biz/izakaya-sozai-san-francisco). Recently, we checked out a new place that EASILY slipped into our top five: Marufuku Ramen!\n\nAs a ramen shop, Marufuku can't get any simpler. This restaurant has only 4 ramen bowls: 1. Hakata Tonkotsu (simmered pork belly with mushroom, egg, scallions, and bean sprouts), 2. Hakata DX (like the normal one but with braised pork belly and corn), 3. Paitan Ramen (chicken-based broth with chicken chasu instead of pork), and 4. Paitan DX (they give you corn and grilled chicken on the side too). They say they only serve 15 bowls of their Paitan DX a day but I saw a lot of people getting it - so not sure how much of a restriction there is. If you're looking to complement your meal, this place also has a few appetizers as well as small rice bowls. In terms of pricing, normal bowls cost $11.99 and the DX is $15.99. As for small bites, they go for ~$4-$8. We ended up getting two Hakata Tonkotsu bowls and one order of Karaage. Here's what we thought of our experience:\n\n-- KICKA$$ KARAAGE --\nExcuse me for my language, but the Karaage here was SPECTACULAR. When I had Karaage at Oakland's Geta (https://www.yelp.com/biz/geta-oakland), I thought I would never experience such amazing fried chicken at another restaurant. Besides the smaller portion size, Marufuku's Karaage was every bit as comparable as Geta's. The breading was crispy, meat was tender yet SO JUICY, and the sauce + lemon combo = bomb.com. Please do yourself a favor and check out their Karaage.\n\n-- CREAMY AND ORGASMIC TONKOTSU RAMEN --\nMarufuku definitely had one of the best pork ramen I have ever had in my short life. The broth was close to perfection: It was super rich (like you couldn't see through it at all kind of rich) and tasted very flavorful. As for the ingredients, they cooked the egg well and the veggies came out fresh. Also, having thin noodles was a very nice change. But the pork slices truly took the cake, as every piece MELTED in our mouths! The only con about the Hakata Tonkotsu was that they could have given us less ginger, although it didn't overpower the broth. \n\n-- VIBRANT ATMOSPHERE --\nThough the restaurant was small, it compensated by having a bright and intimate ambiance. The modern decor, dim lighting, as well as the comfortable seating - they all made Marufuku a welcoming place to dine at. When coming here, try to get placed in the middle area, where the seats are actually lit up! SO COOL.\n\n-- POLITE, BUT SERVICE TOO EFFICIENT??? -- \nOverall, we found the employees to be friendly and responsive. They made sure we had everything we needed and they also asked us whether we were enjoying our meal. Plus, since we were kind of in a rush, I appreciated that they brought out our food less than 5 minutes after ordering. Efficiency = amazing, but this might turn off a lot of people because I honestly thought that they were just trying to get customers in and out as fast as possible. So consider that if you are coming here for a long dinner.\n\n-- HORRENDOUS WAIT --\nDespite what their hours might say, you NEED to come early - especially during dinnertime. For example, since they open at 5pm on Saturday/Sunday for the evening, arrive by 430pm or else you'll have to wait an hour+. We got there at 5:05pm (JUST OPENED!) and there were already 18 people ahead of us on the waiting list! Now that's a testament to how good Marufuku is. Fortunately, there are plenty of shops to keep you busy and they will text you when your table is \"ready.\" I say \"ready\" because I think they notify you when a table has gotten a check - NOT when someone actually leaves. \n\n-- DECENT LOCATION WITH AFFORDABLE PARKING --\nMarufuku is found inside the Japan Center, at the heart of San Francisco's Japantown. This isn't a bad spot for a restaurant since there's a lot of culture and life around you. Finding free parking on the street might be a disaster, and so I strongly encourage you to find a spot inside the Annex Garage. It was only $2.5/hour for us! \n\nI debated back and forth about whether Marufuku Ramen was worth waiting more than an hour for, and I think I've finally decided. Despite the traffic this place gets, Marufuku truly lives up to all of the hype. The food here is ungodly and the environment is as rich as the ramen. Furthermore, price point is fairly inexpensive too! For those reasons, I have to give Marufuku Ramen an \"Omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this\" rating! Arigatogozaimasu!\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

Noodles on the thin side though.\n\nHad the chance to try this spot a couple of Saturdays ago for lunch. My friends and I all wanted to try the limited chicken paitan DX (only 15 servings a day), so we met up at 11, 30 minutes before the restaurant opens for lunch. When we arrived, I was surprised that there were already a couple groups in front of us waiting. \n\nJust in case you don't know where it is, Marufuku is in the same area as the Kinokuniya and the cute crepe spot, on the second floor.\n\nAs we were waiting, I saw the line get progressively longer behind us, so this is definitely still a very popular spot even though it's been open for a while. We got seated pretty soon right after they opened at 11:30, and since we knew exactly what we wanted, we were anxious to flag down a server and be one of the first groups to place our order. However, it was surprisingly hard to grab someone, as they were all running around the place and taking other table's orders.\n\nWe all ordered the Chicken Paitan XD ($15.99), which is chicken ramen with paitan broth, chicken chashu, a soft boiled egg, and various veggies. It also comes with a piece of grilled chicken on the side. Once we placed our orders, our food came out fairly quickly. The grilled chicken arrived first, and we all started digging in.\n\nThe grilled chicken was juicy and tender with a sweet teriyaki marinade. It's a joint leg and thigh piece, so paired with a bowl of ramen, it's quite filling. All of my friends were able to finish both items, but I ended up taking half my chicken home.\n\nThe ramen came a couple minutes after the chicken. I enjoyed everything about the ramen except for the chicken chashu and the noodles, which are Hakata style i.e. the noodles are extra thin. I don't think I've ever had such thin ramen noodles before, and I realized from this meal that I'm not exactly a fan. The chicken chashu tasted like dry-ish breast meat and wasn't the melt-in-your-mouth chashu experience I look for. The soft boiled egg was amazing though. I wish I had added another one to my ramen.\n\nService was pretty fast; everyone works quickly here as they're cognizant of the long line of people waiting outside.\n\nI don't think I'd come back again, but that's because I'm not a huge fan of the hakata style thin ramen noodles. I'm glad I tried it once though.\n\nThere's usually residential parking to be found within a couple blocks of Japantown.

I hate it when there's too much to choose from! Oh the power of choice right....\n\nThe lady came to the front and I asked what time they were closing. They said 9pm but if we wanted to eat they would accommodate us. My +1 and I said f*ck yes! Let's do it! Since there was almost 5 stars on Yelp I figured this place would usually have a line so I better be strategic and eat while there's no line. \n\nI'm all about serendipity folks. I'm not a huge ramen connoisseur and rarely go searching for this stuff on Yelp but boy am I glad for randomly experiencing this joy of a place. \n\nThe decor was quite nice inside with the wooden accents and the restaurant appeared clean and well maintained. I ordered the hakata tonkotsu mild and my +1 ordered the same but without any level of spice for comparison. To be honest, the broths both tasted very similar and you can hardly taste any of the spice in the mild version. It's not really a toss up between the two in my opinion because they both taste the same.\n\nThe ramen itself was bangin'!! Everything was cooked to perfection. The ramen noodles were like no other I've ever had. They were thin, whiter in color, and chewy with a nice bite to them. The broth (which had apparently been simmered for 20 hours) was rich and flavorful with the right amount of fat content and wasn't overly seasoned or salty. The simmered pork itself was perfectly seasoned and just melts in your mouth. The garnishes were also perfect. I love me some crunchy mushroom and bean sprouts!\n\nWould definitely give this place another visit to try their other ramen flavors and offerings as I know the ramen selection around town is quite overwhelming and just as competitive.", "author": "Connie M."}

Pretty light, so definitely not extremely rich. There was still a strong pork flavor. I asked for spicy and it was okay. I should probably go to the spiciest level. \n\nNoodles: Was okay, but again, I like the thicker ramen. No fault of the restaurant though.\n\nToppings: There's not a ton of toppings, just a bit of the black mushrooms, sliced pickled ginger, and an egg on the bottom. Yeah, the bottom of the bowl. I assume they have eggs pre-cooked, and they put the egg on the bottom to warm it through. It was a little odd, but that means when you seek your egg, use your spoon to fish it out. Otherwise, you'll break the egg and yolk everywhere. The egg is the great runny one though. If it was warmed through it would be better (and it took me a good 10 minutes to even find the thing, so it should have warmed through).\n\nEnvironment was cool. My friend and I were seated in the center, which is really awkward to get into. Ladies take note - don't wear a dress or skirt here, in case they stick you in the middle.

Mine had the pork chashu, soft boiled egg, wood ear mushrooms, bean sprouts, green onions, and a little bit of the red ginger. The DX had braised pork belly instead of the chashu, corn and a piece of seaweed. I also tried some of the mild broth and you can definitely taste the spiciness. I'll stick with my non-spicy broth - still had plenty of flavor. Noodles were just ok, maybe slightly overcooked. I like when it has more of a snap or al dente-ness to them. Portions or the bowls looked really small. But I was actually pretty satisfied by the end of it. The price is a bit on the pricier side for such a small bowl though. The pork and soft boiled egg were the standouts. Pork had good amount of fat, flavor and was fall apart tender. The egg was cooked perfectly - yolk still runny.

Marufuku! \n\nThe broth is exactly how tonkatsu broth should taste, bones, porky, thick, and fatty. Even without pieces of fat floating in the broth. Sounds gross? Well, then you've never had real ramen! Trust me, pieces of fat = authentic ramen. \n\nThe only un-Japanese about this place is that they have different level of spiciness. Something that is uncommon in a ramen bar in Japan. Oh, and the egg. It's cheap, not organic, and not seasoned. \n\nMarufuku's long queue and wait time is justified.

At lunchtime on a (holiday) weekday, the wait was 45 minutes (with 35 parties ahead of us). Pretty awesome to be able to monitor where we were in line based on the Yelp app.\n\nThe decor is has a modern Japanese feel, with a lot of wood accents. The service was friendly, but clearly somewhat sparing. They only came when they had to.\n\nFood: \n- Chicken Karaage: The texture was really good - crispy on the outer layer, but the flavor of the chicken overall wasn't particularly notable. The aioli that came with it really tied the flavor together. \n\n- Hakata Tonkotsu: The broth was SO creamy. It almost tasted like it had cream in it. It also wasn't super salty the way some other ramens are. The pork belly was SO good. It had a garlicky and sweet tasted and was so tender. The noodles were cooked really well. Came with a full egg (!), but mine was slightly overcooked. The portion didn't seem large, but I already started feeling full part way through, maybe because of how rich the soup was. \n\nOverall good experience and maybe the best ramen I have had in SF.", "author": "Amanda C."}

Street parking wasn't terrible, there is a mall parking as well but it will cost you $2- $3.5 per hour depending on the time of the day. \nWe went into mall through the Post St and Filmore St entrance and it is just up the stairs in the corner.  There was no line when we got there and we were like OH it's our lucky day... but it's not.\n\nTIP: Marufuku Ramen use the Yelp Waitlist system so make sure you get on the waitlist before heading over to the restaurant to avoid the long wait.  Since we didn't get on the waitlist beforehand, we waited for an hour- but it's okay since there's plenty to see in the mall.\n\nThe interior felt modern and clean with wooden tables and d\u00e9cor.  It's pretty standard and what you expect from a Japanese restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the Chicken Karaage appetizer, one Hakata Tonkotsu and one Hakata Tonkotsu Deluxe. \n\nThe Hakata Tonkotsu Deluxe was truly amazing- coming from someone who's been to Japan and loves a good bowl of ramen.  Once the bowl arrived, I quickly took one sip of the broth, burnt my tongue and then took another sip. It's just so flavorful and creamy that makes you question how long has the broth been cooking? It looked very rich milky and immediately made me question if I'll need to take a lactaid pill before I continue.  The noodle came al-dente with some chewiness (guess that's their default, you can also customize the richness of the broth and firmness of noodle), here they use the thin straight noodles, I was hoping they would use the wavy or thicker noodles so it could soak up the broth a little better but either way it was excellent!  The chashu pork was sliced thinly but had good flavor and balance of fat and meat. With that said, I am not a fan of the braised thick pork belly, although it had good flavor, it was not tender and quite hard to chew. The soft boiled egg deserves a major compliment, not only did it have good flavor but it was cooked perfectly- when the yolk looks liquidy (is this a word?) but was just cooked enough to be held together, just perfect! \nThe portion was good and filling but since I had extra broth left over, I ordered extra noodle. The main different between the deluxe and the regular was the addition of the braised thick pork belly, sweet corn and nori seaweed.  Personally if I could order again, I would have went for the regular bowl and add extra chashu.\n\nService- Good! Our waitress was attentive and came to check on us and refill our water regularly even though the restaurant was quite busy.\n\nPrice- Good! The Hakata Tonkotsu Deluxe will run you around $17 (at time of writing), with drinks and appetizer, you are look at around $25 per person.  \n\nOverall- 4.5 stars (I'll round it up to 5).  Definitely one of the best bowl of ramen that I've ever eaten in the States, it is worth the wait and price.  A fair warning-  It's a rich bowl of ramen so if you are not used to heavy/rich food, prepare yourself or be ready to take some Tums.", "author": "Felix S."}

Besides that, the broth was delicious, the noodles were perfectly chewy, and the egg was just the right amount of yolky (it's at the bottom of each bowl)!

If you want to eat dinner here, make sure to reserve a spot on the app/website an hour or two in advance.\n\nWait times aside, the food here is on the upper end of ramen in SF. It is reasonably priced, being a few dollars cheaper than the other ramen spots in Japantown (Yamadaya, Hinodeya, Waraku, etc.) The ramen is broth is light and delicious, and I especially love the noodles here, although they don't let you customize firmness like Ippudo. \n\nI've been here countless times and can recommend:\n- Hakata Tonkotsu ramen (I like the Tonkotsu broth better than the Chicken one)\n- Chicken Paitan DX ramen (Get extra corn!)\n- Karaage (Huge portions)\n- Marufuku bites (Steamed buns with shredded pork) (Love this!)\n- Calpico (try this Japanese soda if you've never had one)\n\nOne downside of eating here is that the wait staff will subtly rush you to order and eat quickly since there are such long lines.

This place was almost perfect for me. \n\nTo start, my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place by accident. We were walking around Japan town and saw that there was this huge crowd outside of their doors. We looked up the name on Yelp to see what the fuss was all about and saw the impressive reviews this restaurant was getting. Unfortunately at that moment, my boyfriend and I had an event to attend to, so we said if it was still opened when we came back, we would try it out...thankfully, it was opened!\n\nWe ended up getting to the restaurant about half an hour before it was closing. Thankfully, there was a short line and they ended seating us. When you enter the restaurant, it gives this mixture of modern/traditional Japanese vibe. Service was great, giving us water right away and was able to give us suggestions on what to order. Both my boyfriend and i ordered their Hakata Tonkotsu since thats what Yelp was raving all about and that was what this restaurant was known for, and boy, were we not disappointed.\n\nThe broth was jammed packed with flavor. The pork slices were so good! I remember when I bit in it for the first time, i literally dropped my chopsticks. I have never tasted something so delicious! Every time after that, I had to pause and slowly chew the pork because I was just enjoying it that much. \n\nNow, the reason why this place was near perfect was because I was not a huge fan of the noodles. I felt like the texture wasn't where I would have liked it, but this is me comparing to another ramen place I have been to. Also, even though the service was great when we entered, when we were trying to receive our check, they were a little slower than we would have liked.\n\nOverall, I really liked this experience.

To make it clear, I much prefer the hakata style ramens (which is what they serve here). It's from Fukuoka, and has a thinner noodle that isn't curly and just really rich flavorful broth. I prefer these noodles because you get a better noodle-to-soup ratio (in my opinion). \n\nI think the chicken leg is really good, but don't despair if you don't get it (they have limited pieces each day). The chicken leg is similar to the one you can get at nojo ramen tavern, but the star of the show here is definitely the ramen (though at nojo i'd say the star is the chicken... clearly not as big a fan of nojo). \n\nOverall, the noodles are cooked well, but the broth is truly amazing. Flavorful, creamy, and yet somehow not too heavy. Some ramen broths straight up make me feel ill because they're so greasy, but despite being creamy, somehow marufuku manages to keep it light. I recommend coming on the weekdays at lunch and still coming 15 min early to guarantee getting in when they open.

This place's flagship ramen, the Hakata Tonkotsu, did not disappoint in the least.\n\nHACK - GET this dish, the Hakata Tonkotsu, with the braised pork belly as an additional topping for only $3.50, and you basically get the the Hakata DX (which is $14.99) for only $14.49, WITH the simmered pork belly that comes with the regular Hakata Tonkotsu. I'm not sure why the Hakata DX is a full $4 more in cost with respect to the Hakata Tonkotsu. Either they aren't good at math (unlikely as all Asians are remarkably good at math) or they WANT you to do this.\n\nHakata Tonkotsu with Braised Pork Belly - SO good. The braised pork belly is a MUST here. GET THIS AT ALL COSTS. The pork belly was so tender and each bite quite simply just melts and falls apart in your mouth. Your teeth basically sink into the flesh like it was nothing more than some butter on a warm day. ALL the other toppings fit quite well with the rest of the ramen to form an incredibly cohesive ensemble of flavors. I found myself enjoying all the toppings in each and every bite. HOLY CRAP this is so good!! The broth is amazing as well - rich and robust with flavor, it is so soothing and unbelievably welcoming. I don't know how they were able to infuse so much flavor into it and they must have simmered those pork marrow bones for an eternity. I basically felt like I was drinking essence of marrow. \n\nMentaiko Bowl - I enjoyed this very much but this dish definitely played second fiddle to the incredible bowl of ramen and I wasn't able to finish it all. I've never had this dish before  and my friend mentioned to me that usually the dish is served with intact cod roes, instead of the macerated ones that came with this one. He didn't seem to like that, but I enjoyed it a lot! I can imagine though that having those little unharmed pearls pop in your mouth would be a refreshing feeling. Good appetizer regardless!\n\nOverall I am SO happy that I waited in line for probably about an hour to try this place out.

The broth is so milky and savorous that gives you the authentic umami flavor you expect to find in a Tonkotsu ramen plate. Literally, this plate went me back 6 years ago when I was in Fukuoka, Japan tasting a local Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen dish! It was like Deja Vu, like living the same moments again. All of a sudden all those flavors residing in my memory for all those years began to come alive again! The katsu (pork) was also very similar to the one I had at that time, in big bite-size chunks as it should be. Also, the egg as jammy as I would expect to be.\n\nThere are no other words to describe this plate. I will visit this place again and again and I will let other people know about this gem!\n\nThe only pros I could find is that the bowls could be a bit wider so that the noodles would be more sparsed letting you enjoy the ramen better, since there is a big portion of noodles there.", "author": "Thanos P."}

I got the Hakata Tonkotsu with braised pork belly in the side. I would definitely recommend getting this instead of the Hakata DX, since it's basically the same but with more meat. The braised pork is huge and delicious, and the noodles are plentiful and perfectly cooked.\n\nI think I do prefer Ippudo in Berkeley. Marufuku's broth is saltier (especially if you get any spice), and the simmered pork belly is somewhat tough. However, Marufuku is still very solid.

I hate to say it, but I think this place is overhyped.  \n\nMy party of 8 was able to get to the restaurant 20 minutes before opening and was 3rd in line.  We made it into the first seating and the food came out quickly.\n\nI ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu DX.  While the pork belly was high quality and tasty, I wasn't impressed by the broth at all.  The broth was fatty and creamy like Tonkotsu should be, but it was lacking the depth of flavor that I typically expect with a Tonkotsu broth.  I much prefer when Tonkotsu is at least a little bit garlilcky- without the garlic, the broth felt overly heavy on my palette.  The noodles were also thinner than I prefer, but had a nice consistency.  The soft boiled egg was my favorite part of the dish.  It was perfectly cooked with a soft, yolky middle (make sure you dig it out of the bottom of your bowl before it gets overcooked).\n\nOverall, my party enjoyed their meals, but I would definitely not wait in line for this place in the future.", "author": "Michelle M."}

It was 1 pm on a weekday and I was hoping that the wait would not be too long.  I signed in and was told 22 people were ahead of me.  Let's not panic, I told myself.  Within 5 minutes, the line was shortened by 6 parties.  In another 5 minutes, another 5 spots opened up.  In total, I waited approximately 30 minutes before my table was ready.  \n\nAfter a quick review of the limited menu I chose the Hakata DX, which is the Hakata Tonkotsu ramen with additional braised pork belly and corn.  Note that the portions are not huge and remind me more of the portion sizes in Japan. I inquired about the spice levels and was encouraged to go with the Medium spicy option with the recommendation to add additional hot pepper seasoning if it wasn't spicy enough.  I'm glad I went with this option because Medium spicy wasn't that spicy (just a hint of spiciness) but the additional pepper seasoning that they provide to you had a kick!\n\nThe ramen arrive hot and steaming approximately 5 minutes after ordering.  The broth was thick, rich and creamy from the many hours of cooking bones to make the pork stock.  The noodles were slightly chewy and the generous portion of pork belly was fatty, meaty and very tender.   The egg was soft boiled and had a creamy, runny yolk.  This bowl of ramen was perfection and so very delicious.  While appearing to be small, the portion was the perfect amount of noodles, broth, meat and vegetables.  I was satisfied, but not stuffed.\n\nTables turn over fairly quickly as most people seemed to leave soon after they finished eating.  While the staff did not urge anyone to leave, they don't do anything to encourage folks to hang around either.  Checks arrive soon after you are finished eating but not in such a way that you feel you are being rushed.  They are friendly and kind while also being very efficient at preparing new tables for the next customer.  They know how to handle long lines and crowds here.  Some single parties were asked if they minded sharing their table with other solo diners.\n\nOne of the best features is using Yelp to handle their waiting list.  It's so easy to see where you are on the list and to better anticipate how much longer you have before returning to the restaurant entrance.

The chicken leg that comes with the set has some sort of soy sauce based marinade. Yes, think of it like soy sauce chicken on flavor steroids. It was well worth getting there early and paying the extra price. The chicken ramen itself was surprisingly delicious. It comes with thin, lean, juicy slices of chicken.

When I first arrived at 5 there wasn't a line. Come back 10 minutes later and there's already 5 parties waiting. At opening, the line was already stretched to the crepe shop on the other side. Absolutely dumbfounding. \n\nWhen you first sit down, you're immediately given a grand high end impression. The aesthetic was pleasing and the music and atmosphere made it feel classy. As soon as guest are let in, you can see the kitchen ready to go and servers with no hesitation. \n\nNow here is why Marufuku to me, is 4 star and not a 5. For dinner I ordered Chicken Karaage ($6.50) and Hakata Deluxe ($16.99). In total at the end with tip and tax, I was spending almost $30 on one dinner for just myself. I'm not criticizing the pricing model. I'm criticizing how dull it was to pay $7 for 5 small pieces of Karaage. How for $17, the portion size for a deluxe bowl was comparable to standard bowls at other shops. If the pricing was in the taste that would be fine. And that's not to say that my meal wasn't delicious, it definitely was. But there wasn't an X factor that justified the pricing and the hype. There wasn't a reason why if you wanted soul lifting ramen, you would come here over other nearby stores. It made me really consider what it would of been like to have ordered one of their standard bowls. \n\nOverall, Marufuku is a fancy joint with delicious ramen. It's expensive and you could get the same tasting experience at any other store with no line. My main point for Marufukus is that there's nothing to justify the pricing and long line. I didn't find it in the service, the waitresses were pressured to get people in and out. And the \"deluxe\" broth and noodles were unbiasedly comparable to other shops. But all this is just due to high standards. Don't let my critiques downplay how much their ramen will hit the spot.", "author": "Tony N."}

The Geso fry (squid legs) is really nice, crunchy & again not greasy.\n\nWe ordered the Hakata DX Ramen which did not disappoint. The broth was rich, deep, & very flavorful. The ramen is the thinner type which is usually not my favorite. However, this ramen seems really special. It has great texture & mouth feel. I describe it as \"bouncy\"! Every ingredient in the Hakata DX complemented it, except for the braised pork belly. It was kind of dry on the non-fatty parts.\n\nWe tried some special beer called DaiDai & Red Rice, unfortunately both disappointed. The DaiDai was bitter & medicinal while the Red Rice was just nothing special.\n\nOne suggestion to the business, please have your servers wash their hands prior to handling any food after touching their cell phones, which we observed happened often. Did you know that cell phones are reservoirs for all things germy? Yuck!\n\nFortunately your ramen is well above average, so we'll be back!

The one drawback is the wait time, but I took that opportunity to explore Fillmore Street and Japantown by checking in through my phone. It was a two hour wait, but well worth it. In fact, once you get inside, the service is whiplash fast--since I ate here alone, they sat me with a stranger who had a flight at 10:25. We were seated at 8:55, and he was out the door by 9:15.

I'm all for that!  \nI didn't regret it because the turnaround was really fast.  The ramen came in about 7 minutes and we ate for about 15 because we scarfed it down.  Both of us went down to the last bit of broth.  Best ramen I've had, hands down.  When I commend ramen, I'm really pointing out the broth and the proportions that come with it.  The broth marrying the sufficient amount of pork belly, corn, seaweed, and the broth are so perfect in the Hakata DX (medium spicy).  Get the medium spicy.  It makes a difference in taste compared to the mild.  It's a little more change to spend for ramen but it's worth it!  The dark meat of the pork is my favorite.  We ordered the karaage as well.  Karaage is karaage, but the creamy sauce sums it up. \nI also didn't regret coming here because they had a good timekeeping system for customers they use through Yelp.  You can track to see how many parties are before you and watch the number quickly go down.  You get a call 5 minutes to about your turn, so just wait on the right side in front of the entrance in line.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-24", "description": "Venue: Located kitty corner from Kinokuniya on the 2nd floor of Kintetsu mall in Japantown. \n\nTime: 4.55 pm on a Wednesday and we were the first in line; Crowd grew steadily to 15 by 5.15pm and it swelled to at least 30 by 5.30 pm when Marufuku opened. Crowd was mostly millennials in their early 30s and everyone was promptly seated. Another line started to form.\n\nRamen along with curry rice are treasured in Japan far more than sushi and miso. I'm not talking about instant ramen, the sustenance of a poor college student but the Marufuku kind, which is the culmination of hours of labor of love and soulful rituals. That's what Marafuku mean by 'real artisan flavor' where everything in Marafuku is painstakingly hand made and made from scratch.  This is indeed a breath of fresh air for Japantown as ramen in the Mall has hitherto been mostly underwhelming.\n \nThe long and short of Marufuku's menu boils down to either Chicken Paitan ramen or Hakata style tonkotsu ramen. In either case, the key is their full-bodied broth and firm ramen texture. The creamy white broth was made from long hours of cooking chicken or pork bones, the holy grail of ramen bases. The broth in some other ramen-ya can be overly chicken-y or porky but not here. Long hours of slow boiling in Marufuku paid off with good balance of flavors, good depths without being overly fatty or salty. Hakata style implied thin noodles were used and they were definitely al dente and slurpable.\n\nThe toppings in each were pretty standard like corn, kikurage (cloud ear mushroom), nori, beni shoga (pickled ginger) etc but deserving special mention was the hanjuku tamago (soft boiled egg) buried under the noodles. The ramen egg is soft boiled where the white is cooked through but the yolk remains runny so you can twirl the yolk around and mix with the broth. The egg I had was a tad too well done and the yolk not as runny as I had hoped. The simmered pork belly had a little fat, which I ignored coz it was so tender that it just melted in my mouth.\n\nSo it was a no brainer that we picked one from each style, Hakata Tonkotsu  ($11.99) and Chicken Paitan DX ($15.99) to share.  The Chicken Paitan came with an added bonus..... A sizzling plate of a good-sized soy braised chicken leg nestled on top of a bed of bean sprouts. It was delicious and tender but quickly lost its scrumptiousness when the chicken started to cool off.\n\nThe interior was elegantly appointed in contemporary style with generous usage of natural wood carpentry throughout the smallish dining room.  Service was non-existent albeit lightning fast. It took only 10 minutes tops for food to be served.  In this sense, ramen eating may be regarded as fast food as the proper etiquette is to slurp both the broth (sans spoon) and noodles as fast as you can from the bowl and create as much racket as you wish in the process! \n\nGochisosama deshita (Thanks for the meal)", "author": "Geoff G."}

The restaurant is modern with seating for about 50 patrons with mainly tables, but there are three large booths. \n\nAfter reading fellow Yelper reviews, we had our minds set as to what we were going to order.  When the waiter brought our water, we were ready and placed our orders.  You can order broth with no spice, mild, medium, spicy or ultra spicy.\n\nHakata DX - It's similar to Hakata Tonkatsu with its Hakata style ramen with rich pork broth, soft boiled egg, corn, green onions, kikurage mushrooms and bean sprouts.  The difference? It has braised pork belly instead of simmered pork belly.  The pork was tender.  Now I have to try the simmered pork belly on the Hakata Tonkatsu. \n\nChicken Paitan DX - a chicken ramen with rich white Paitan broth, chicken chashu, soft boiled egg, corn, green onions, kikurage mushrooms and bean sprouts.  A grilled chicken thigh and leg comes on the side. The menu states that this dish is limited to 15 servings.  So it's pretty much a dish that will be available for the first two sittings. The chicken come out in a sizzling hot plate. While we were there, at least 10 patrons ordered it.  The broth was delicious and full of flavor. The chicken was moist and flavorful. \n\nThe bowls might look small, but they are deceiving deep.  So the portion is a good size. The broths on both were the highlights, so rich and tasty.

Marufuku Ramen is a Hakata style ramen shop, serving excellent quality ramen with super thin noodles and rich pork broth cooked over 20 hours. They are located inside the Japantown Mall, on the second floor, diagonally across from the popular Kinokuniya bookstore. My first tip is to get here early because even before the doors open at 11:30am, there is a line forming. We came early on a Saturday before opening, but not early enough, as we didn't make it into the first round of seating. We had to wait about 30 minutes for the next seating. The restaurant is clean and modern, but if you need to use the restroom, you have to go out to the mall. \n\nThe Hakata DX ($15.99) is the way to go! Delicious braised pork belly, rich pork broth, thin noodles, soft boiled egg, corn, green onions. kikurage mushrooms, and bean spouts...the best on the menu! There is a good amount of pork belly (thank God!) and the broth was very tasty. If you don't see the egg at first, don't worry. It is usually hiding at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nTakoyaki ($6.50) for 5 pieces. These were not bad. There were just small pieces of chewy octopus inside of the soft fried ball. There isn't a lot of octopus, but it still tasted ok. \n\nMarufuku is one of the better \"artisan\" ramen shops in San Francisco. All of their dishes are handmade with quality. It's definitely a very worthwhile destination if you are looking for great ramen.", "author": "Jean S."}

The Chicken Paitan Deluxe is a large meal consisting of a sizzling iron platter of a quarter chicken served on a bed of bean sprouts and a very large bowl of Ramen.\n\nThe ramen is served with the typical garnishes: fresh corn, nori, noodles ( yes they are thin and not thick), chashu,  scallions, kikurage and the best part ( and you must hunt for it) the soft poached egg at the bottom of the bowl....explode that sucker and release the yolk.\n\nThis broth will really make you happy btw!!!\n\nYou have the option of choosing 5 levels of spice.

I loved the thin noodles, which is different than some of the other ramen places.  They give you so much meat.  The chashu is amazing.  It's so tender, juicy, and flavorful.  They give you a thick piece along with a few thinner pieces.  The broth is amazing as well.  They ooze of the fat from the meat, which gives it so much flavor.  All the different topping add to the bowl as well.  They don't clash at all.  I love the soft boiled egg that's cooked with the right texture.  \n\nMarufuku offers 5 levels of spiciness.  I ordered #3 (medium), but I should've gone with a #4 (spicy).  Medium adds a little bit of kick, but it's not that spicy.  It was $15.99, a bit higher priced that other bowls of ramen, but considering how much meat and toppings they give, it's worth it.\n\nI also tried tried their small salad.  It was ok.  Didn't care for the dressing.  It was sweet and sour, but a bit too sweet for my taste.  \n\nI'll definitely come back to try some of the other stuff.

My boyfriend and I weren't fond of the type of noodles that they serve, but the ramen at Marafuku was the only place that seemed to compare to Hawaii's ramen joints we frequented.\n\nThis time, instead of going with a party of 2, we had 3. This heavily affected our wait time. Last time, when it was just my boyfriend and I we waited about 20 minutes. You will see a similar trend that parities with 2 move faster in the list. The establishment is very small so parties larger than 2 take more time since people are sitting longer. We waited about 1hour~1hour 15 minutes. I was contemplating if the wait was worth it but I wasn't willing to try anything around the area.\n\nWhen we entered, we were given water. The water seemed to taste and smell weird.. I thought that it was just my cup, but my boyfriend and his mom's cup also smelled fishy. We decided to not drink the water. It wasn't a deal breaker tho! My boyfriend and I got the Hakata DX while his mom got the Tonkatsu ramen. It was exactly what I remembered except.. It wasn't spicy at all! I love to have my ramen spicy so that was just one part that disappointed me. I was going to ask for them to make it spicier but I remembered I didn't have any water to aid me with the spiciness.. \n\nThe bowl looks very deceiving! It looks tiny but when you dig in.. you'll find a bunch of things like a boiled egg, corn, beans sprouts, etc. It'll fill your stomach so don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach!\n\nTIP: If you like your egg soft boiled, take out the egg as soon as you can..

I'm not usually a chicken person when eating out but the chicken broth was very soothing. Though if I had to pick just one, I would get the tonkotsu.

I just never craved it anymore, and all the ramen places just started tasting the same to me with slight differences. However, Marufuku has resurrected that love for me! Wow, it feels like ramen done right. \n\nWe each got the Hakata DX ($16), and the only difference from the regular Hakata is that the DX is with braised pork belly vs simmered pork belly. The website menu is a dollar less, but I'm almost sure that it's a dollar more in the restaurant, because I remember thinking \"whoaaa this is pricey!\"It was our first time, and I deeply appreciate a delicious pork belly, so I thought I would go for it. \n\nI'm glad I did, because I really did enjoy my meal. The broth was creamy and not overwhelming, and went really well with the thin noodles. I've never had thin noodles in my ramen like this but I enjoy quite a lot, because you get more of the soup's flavor with the thin noodles. As for the meat, the braised pork belly was an excellent choice! You get plenty of slices, and the meat itself is juicy and tender. Thick cuts with layers of yumminess. I got the medium spicy, and it wasn't as spicy as I expected, but it was still good. There's the spicy seasoning that you can add to your ramen for that extra spiciness. \n\nThey have a huge selection of appetizers. Some like those of your typical ramen places; takoyaki, chicken karaage, gyoza, edamame, etc. What caught my eye was the \"Marufuku bits.\" It seemed like a specialty here since the name of the restaurant was in here. I thought it would be bite-size due to the name, but I was wrong. It's kind of like the peking duck and the bao bun, but without the duck. They used beef instead. There's a drizzle of mayo and you get a lot of it if you just bite into it, but according to the bf, you should eat this like a taco to get a even amount of all the flavors. It's pretty flavorful as all the juices from the meat is soaked into the bao. We also got the mentaiko rice bowl, and I thought it was just typical. It's good, but it's not out of the ordinary. \n\nThis place also has a bunch imported beers from Japan. There's two that caught our attention that we decided to try. Both were not to our liking. We tried the Wasabi one, and the flavor is very light. We also tried the strawberry one (like how could I say no to strawberry?), and I must say, I was very disappointed. It tasted just like cough syrup, and I couldn't even finish it. \n\nOverall, skip the imported beers. The ramen here is very delicious, and I would say it's a nice treat yourself meal.

Waiting for food in SF is often a very painful experience: flagging a staffer to jot down your name, standing around for an hour outside, and having to keep an ear out for your name. Marufuku uses the Yelp Reservation system. You just go up to the tablet and write down your contact phone number and number of people in your party. You'll get a text confirming your place in the waitlist and another when your reservation is ready. Given the location in a fun shopping mall in Japantown, you can shop around or grab a drink/snack.\n\nThe actual ramen was warm and hearty. I think the broth wasn't as intensely flavorful as some other places I've been, but it was still good. What I really liked was that the basic ramen was $11, which is just a much more reasonable price than many other places in SF.\n\nWith the not-too-difficult parking in Japantown, not-too-painful wait experience, fun location in Japantown that I would like to shop in anyways, and yummy and affordable ramen, I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Jennifer C."}

Here's what I think after I tried.\n1. To skip the line, you either join the waitlist long before you show up and meanwhile just find something else to do or go there before they open for lunch/dinner and line up so you can be the first group of customers for seating. This is what I did after waiting for 2.5 hrs the first time and went to Ramen Ramadaya across the street because I got too hungry.\n2. If you have not tried this place, you gotta try at least once. There is a lot that goes into that broth and the ramen is great. \n3. They have a limit of 15 on that sizzling plate chicken leg dish with ramen. I think the chicken leg is okay so if you can't get it, a bowl of ramen is good too.\n4. If this place did not have such a long wait every time, I'd go more often. But is it worth the wait for every ramen craving I have. No. I think the nearby Ramen Hinodeya and Ramadaya and the Ippudo in the financial district are all very good! The Ippudo also has a wait and is pricier and smaller portion, but their tonkotsu broth is more flavorful. This place has just ramen and if you want takoyaki, curry, etc you get more selections at Ramen Ramadaya across the street and their ramen is also amazing.", "author": "Sharon H."}

Spicy levels are your choice; I chose medium just to add some kick to their rich, creamy, pork broth. My boyfriend ordered the Hakata DX.

Kind of look like thin spaghetti noodles, which initially threw me off, but hey, this is the way Marufuku does it. \n\nOnto the accompaniments: the bean sprouts, thinly cut wood ear mushroom, and pink ginger ribbons give the soup a good crunch. The chicken pieces themselves were a bit rougher than I would have liked, but they do soak in the broth and pick up the broth's flavor. The egg (they give you a whole egg!) was basically perfection-- a mostly gelatinous but slightly runny middle. Salty sweet perfection. The medium spicy was a true Asian medium spicy. The ceramic bowls the ramen came in were very pretty-- I want these someday!\n\nFinally, let's get to the broth: the broth is just the right amount of saltiness as you're eating your food from it. The chicken broth really captured the essence of chicken (and the tonkotsu one captured the pork essence). It wasn't the taste you get on your tastebuds as much as the smell you get upon inhaling the broth. Both were creamy and perfect for a cool day. The tonkotsu one even had little bits of congealed pork fat that made it extra tasty. \n\nWe came on Saturday around 8 and there were ~80 people ahead of us on the waiting list.

I wouldn't even wait two minutes for this ramen. \n\nPaitan ramen is a total disappointment. Nojo in SF has way better Paitan ramen than this place. Hinodeya's paitan is also much better. Marufuku's paitan tasted diluted like they added too much water to their broth. And chicken breast? Chicken breast is the cheapest parts of chicken in Japan because nobody wants to eat it there. \n\nTonkotsu was OK. I'd give four stars but still places like Yamada has it better.  Chashu was quite good and meaty I admit. But nothing special besides the Chashu.

I usually can't eat ramen at most places because I don't eat pork and most ramen broth is made with that, but Marufuku has a chicken alternative, which is awesome and also tastes AMAZING! \n\nI ordered the chicken paitan, which is chicken ramen with rich white paitan broth, chicken chashu, soft boiled egg, green onions, kikurage mushrooms & bean sprouts, and I added some sweet corn to it for $1. You can also adjust the spice level of the ramen to suit your tolerance, and spicy was perfect for me! The ramen was packed with flavor, the portion was decently generous (I couldn't finish it all and I went in hungry), and the price was extremely affordable! With my sweet corn add on, the ramen came out to $12.99. \n\nMarufuku is known to always have a long line outside but we went on a Friday at noon and only waited about 5 minutes. \n\nI would've given Marufuku 5 stars had it not been for the service, which could've been better. The restaurant was almost full when we went but service was lacking. It took 10 minutes to get water after we sat down, and the waiters weren't organized in terms of who's waiting which tables. After someone finally came by and asked if we wanted something to drink, another came and asked the same thing not too long after. The ramen came out decently quickly after we ordered it, but no one stopped by to ask if we needed anything else, etc. It's somewhat understandable because it always seems to be busy in there but it still would've rounded out the whole experience if they attended to us more.\n\nI will definitely be back next time I'm in SF, though, and if you're on the fence about this place, JUST GO! Enjoy some yummy ramen that won't break the bank... you'll thank me later!", "author": "Nikki R."}

It's a deceivingly simple dish with lots of flavors. The cod roe is a bit spicy, salty, crunchy from the sesame seeds, and bursting with cod roe goodness. All together, the bowl is extremely light and refreshing. \n\nHakata Tonkotsu - Not a huge fan. The flavor of the broth is not very strong/deep - it tastes a bit watered down. You're only given two/three thin slices of pork and the pork is not very tender or flavorful. I feel the addition of the bean sprouts and mushrooms did not compliment the ramen very well. However, the thin noodles were cooked well and probably the best part of the dish. \n\n\nHaving never tried a Hakata style ramen, I was eager to give Marafuku Ramen a try. Tucked away in the corner of the Japantown mall, it's easy to spot Marafuku Ramen as there is usually a large crowd of people hovering around the entrance. The wait is about 30-45 minutes, however,  it's not so bad as there is a lot of shops around to kill the time.\n\nMarafuku Ramen is a sleek and stylish ramen joint. The space is definitely hip with a grey scale tone which accents the interesting uses of darks woods. There is an interesting O shaped communal bench seating in the center of the restaurant, with back lit glass as the seats. There's a lot of elements going on in such a small place but it's never too distracting. \n\nHakata style is not my preference when it comes ramen. It's hard to justify the long wait when the ramen just isn't that good. However, I would come back to Marafuku Ramen just for the Mentaiko.", "author": "Julian L."}

However, I'd be lying if I said I shed a tear when I learned about Sapporo-Ya's closure.  And now that Marufuku Ramen has opened in their place, I can't help but revel in the irony that my least favorite spot for ramen in SF has now been replaced by one of my new favorite spots for ramen in the city!\n\nCompletely renovated and modernized (the space used to look really outdated), Marufuku is so much more than just one of the trendier ramen spots in SF.  The menu is narrow (just five types of ramen to choose from, with five different spice levels), but it's super legit.  At least, based on the two I've tried.  As for the rest of the menu, it's pretty solid, offering a decent selection of starters, as well as small rice bowls with toppings like kakuni, chashu, mentaiko, and karaage.\n\n-- CHICKEN KARAAGE - Japanese-style Fried Chicken...$5.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marufuku-ramen-san-francisco?select=DHBVBY7Gwly8iEgsIBvthw)\nIt was a little dark the first time we had this (old oil, perhaps?), but it looked much better every time since then.  Regardless, this was delicious each time we've had it.  The batter has just the right crispiness, the portion is pretty generous (six or so large pieces), I loved how moist and juicy each piece is (hooray for dark meat!).\n\n--  GESO FRY - Fried Squid Legs...$6.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marufuku-ramen-san-francisco?select=3fwyYwTQDHQjRKeLYiPRXA)\nMuch like with the Chicken Karaage, the squid were cooked really well!  The pieces were very crispy, but the tentacles weren't burnt or overcooked at all.  What's more, you could actually taste the squid, which isn't always the case at other places where it can tastes more like oil.\n\n-- HAKATA DX - Hakata-style Ramen with Rich Pork Broth, Braised Pork Belly, Soft Boiled Egg, Corn, Green Onions, Kikurage Mushrooms, and Bean Sprouts...$14.99\nRamen: (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marufuku-ramen-san-francisco?select=5EuJ_vLqCGgqcZqeqN1gVw)\nEgg (it deserved its own shot!): (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marufuku-ramen-san-francisco?select=qch_GdD86QSiGCQYrNTIYA)\nDELICIOUS!  The bowl looked a bit modest, but the portion is actually deceptively large.  The pork belly was great (flavorful, not overly fatty), and I liked how chewy the noodles were (despite their thinness), but the egg really stood out (cooked PERFECTLY).  As for the broth, it was terrific - rich and creamy, but not very heavy.\n\n-- CHICKEN PAITAN DX - Chicken Ramen with Rich White \"Paitan\" Broth, Chicken Chashu, Soft Boiled Egg, Corn, Green Onions, Kikurage Mushrooms, Bean Sprouts, and Grilled Chicken on the side...$14.99\nRamen: (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marufuku-ramen-san-francisco?select=zYr6980y6RHiI2A5l6ss_g)\nChicken: (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marufuku-ramen-san-francisco?select=7J8J-PZj8SULQGPjkjOR_Q)\nAlthough the Hakata DX was definitely better, this wasn't too shabby at all!  The noodles and egg were just as good, the chicken \"chashu\" was decently tender, and, while not quite as rich in comparison, the broth was still milky and tasty.  As for the grilled chicken, it was larger than I expected and tasted great, but I'm not sure it's a must get for the $3 upgrade.\n\nNOTE: Whether it's been the Hakata DX or the Chicken Paitan DX, the \"medium\" level of spice for their broth has been the best for me.  It's not super intense, but it adds just the right amount of kick.  However, if you like some heat to your broth, my friend (who LOVES spicy food) goes with their spiciest level and says it hits the spot, for what it's worth.\n\nAlthough there can definitely be an extended wait for a table on weekends, the line isn't crazy on weeknights (the times I've been, we've waited about 20-30 mins?).  Even then, it's still a lot shorter than Mensho and only slightly longer than nearby Hinodeya (the third hyped up ramen joint to open).  Yet, compared to both, Marufuku is better than both.\n\nMaybe not a clear cut five, but definitely close enough for me!", "author": "Mike L."}

My recommendation would be to share it with someone else. \n\nUnfortunately, if you do want to come here, be prepared to wait. The yelp wait list helps some, but don't bother getting to the restaurant before Yelp tells you to because even after that time, you'll have to wait.

Overall, their ramen is alright, but the noodles and the taste of all the Pork belly fat could be a major turn off. \n\nWe also tried the fried squid and chicken Karaage, which were weak. The batter was boringly thin, so there was hardly any delightful crunch in either of these. Skip the apps from here. \n\nAgain, if you're from the peninsula area, with choices like Ramen Parlor and Ramen Dojo, the ramen and appetizers from here don't warrant the long wait and drive up to the city.

We put our name down for a party of 4 and were on the beginning of the second page and waited about 30 minutes. I would recommend staying in close proximity to the restaurant, since the hostess/server was somewhat soft spoken when calling out names on the list.\n\nWe ordered the edamame and takoyaki (comes in 4) to start. Both were basic (how can you mess up edamame though?!) and nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered the Hakada Tonkatsu (I chose \"spicy\" as my spice level). The toppings were generous and the noodles were cooked al dente, but the broth was kind of bland and didn't have an \"umami\" taste as advertised... I put red pepper flakes into it and it was still \"meh\". My husband, whose a ramen snob, ordered the Hakada DX and he was unimpressed and didn't think it was worth the wait. However, the other 2 in our party ordered the paitan (chicken broth) ramen and they thought it was delish! So maybe we both just ordered the incorrect broths... boo.\n\nThey have several appetizers to choose from (salad, fried squid legs, kara age, etc.) in addition to small rice bowls. They also serve a few Japanese beers and sakes (both hot and cold). Service was efficient and even though there was still a wait, we didn't feel rushed during our meal.", "author": "Annie P."}

The wait time may be long here even though Marufuku Ramen opened a few months ago. The restaurant itself is very small with very limited seatings.. so if you don't want to wait, come right when they open! There's a lot of great shops to walk around while you wait. However, if it's almost your time, make sure you wait by the restaurant because they call your name out and will cross your name off if you don't respond immediately. \n\nI got the hakata tonkotsu with a corn. The ramen comes with a soft boiled egg, and believe me, their eggs are perfect. I would get an extra seasoned boiled eggs if you're a fan of soft boiled eggs! The pork was very tender, a little on the fattier side which slightly too fatty for me, but some people like it that way. The ramen was made perfectly and the broth was amazing. You can choose no spicy, mild, moderate, spicy and ultra spicy. I got medium spicy, and it had a nice kick to it! \n\nThe total of my meal was $12 not including tax, which is considered very cheap for SF! The ramen was very authentic. My friend that recently went to Japan was very satisfied and said it was comparable to the ramen she had.", "author": "Shelly S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-04", "description": "We arrived at Marafuku Ramen at around 7 PM on a Thursday evening. There were about 8-9 parties ahead of us, so we decided to walk around the mall. It's nice that the ramen place is located in a bustling commercial space! There was plenty to see: we walked around the bookstore, Sophie's crepes, and saw lots of people blowing \"dragon's breaths\" at each other from the liquid nitrogen ice cream balls. There were also a lot of people walking around with the ever-popular ice-cream in fish-shaped dessert. \n\nAfter about 30 minutes, we wandered back to Marafuku Ramen. Still about 4 parties ahead of us, so we stuck around. TIP: make sure you stand around the door when they call out names, because they don't say your names very loudly and often times they mispronounce it! (There was a group of 3 for Ketan, but the hostess said, \"Katherine! Kathleen!\" so the group missed it. The restaurant is, however, very accommodating if you come back and they've already called your name; they will still seat you as soon as they can.) \n\nWhile waiting, we could peer through the glass walls at what other people ordered... so when we finally got our seats an hour later (~8 PM), we knew what we wanted. \n\nI ended up getting the chicken deluxe with the extra chicken thigh on the side ($15.99). They only have a limited 15 servings a day, and there were 4 left when we got there, which was surprising to me. For the extra $4 (the regular is $11.99), I think it's worth it -- especially because I brought some of it home for lunch the next day. The pork deluxe doesn't seem that worth it to me for an extra $4... it seems like it just has extra corn...? \n\nAnyway, the chicken was all right. It was a little dry. As for the broth, I liked the subtle spiciness (I got medium). My friend got spicy, and it was just a bit spicier than mine. The soft boiled egg was delicious - very juicy and tender yolk inside! The ramen was thin and slightly chewy... pretty good overall. \n\nI'd like to try to the pork broth next time. I think the pork fat would make the broth more flavorful, and the pork pieces would be less dry. Would probably not get the grilled chicken again.", "author": "Julianna K."}

We both ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu and were so satisfied and full after. The noodles are thin with a harder texture, which I love, and the egg (hidden at the bottom) is perfectly cooked and slightly sweet. The broth is not too heavy but creamy, with bits of pork fat floating around.

A little confused (as the man typically doesn't like soupy things), I was hesitant, yet agreed. Not sure what got into him, but we all know ramen is one of my fave foods and I wasn't about to turn that opportunity down.\n\nOff we went to Japantown. On a mission. For ramen.\n\nFirst, I should mention there's quite the hefty line. During peak dinner hours, expect at least an hour wait, if not longer. Nevertheless, as hungry as we were, we decided to stick it out (who knows when I would be able to get the mister to try new things again???).\n\nAs mentioned before, I decided on the fancy pork option (aka Hakata DX). The main difference between the regular and DX variety is that the DX comes with a little extra meat, corn, and an egg. Boyfriend chose the Chicken Paitan DX... and I won't front like I wasn't a little envious; I was. For the same price as the Hakata DX (about $15), he got the chicken based ramen with chicken charsiu AND A WHOLE CHICKEN LEG ON THE SIDE. It was glorious. Good thing he shared with me this time, or I might've had to throw 'bows (Excision reference, if you weren't aware).\n\nMost importantly, though, I think he likes ramen, now. Another reason for the bumpity bump on the rating. YEEEEY!!!\n\nFinal thoughts? Have I had better ramen? Yes. Was this place still good? Yes. Was the wait worth it? I'm not entirely sure, but I'd happily come back at a less busy hour. Service was just okay, though. No one really checked on us. Which always tends to bum me out a little.", "author": "Vi T."}

We waited an hour and a half to get a table inside! Prepare for a wait, especially for a big group. Small groups are usually a bit quicker. \n\nI love that it's a small and simple menu with only 4 types of Ramen. The broth is a rich pork bone broth that is rich but not too salty. You can order the broth hot or mild as you want depending on your mood. It can get hot though! First and foremost, the broth is truly the star of the show!!!\n\nIn my opinion, it's worth paying the extra $5 for getting the deluxe ramen. I absolutely loved the Hakata DX, but if I came again I would prefer the Chicken Paitan DX. It comes with a side of grilled chicken that is fall of the bone goodness! \n\nThe only thing I didn't like is that the egg wasn't cut in half but just a whole soft boiled egg in the soup. I love that it's a whole egg, but wish it were cut in half. I also thought the ramen was good and fresh but honestly have had better.

We decided to give it a try, and was pretty shocked to show up to a significant wait. I arrived at approximately 5:40 on a Tuesday evening, and the restaurant was already filled and I was the 15th party in line. They use a handy system involving texts and Yelp, which helps to monitor my place in line. After another 40-ish minute wait, we were finally seated.\n\nChicken Karaage: For about $5, this comes with 5 pieces of fried chicken. The batter is excellent, and the chicken is juicy and tender. \nHakata Tonkotsu: The soup broth is decent, not quite as rich as I usually like. The noodles are well cooked, the soft-boiled egg was done quite well and rich in flavor. The meat was mediocre, but overall the portion was fair considering the price and location in Japantown.\nChicken Paitan: The chicken broth was quite special - I had not previously enjoyed chicken broth ramen, and was quite impressed. While I personally still prefer the flavors of tonkotsu broth, there definitely is a more unique flavor in the chicken broth.\n\nI think one of the most difficult parts of the meal was how excruciatingly hot the restaurant was. It was probably 15-20 degrees warmer in the restaurant than outside, if not more. Particularly when everyone is enjoying hot noodle soup, it made for a relatively sweaty and stuffy experience. The smoke that came from the kitchen area didn't help either. Of the SF ramen shops, this is well priced and in a decent location as well.

First, the positives: Marufuku serves up great bowls of Hakata-style ramen - characterized by thinner, non-curly noodles and rich, creamy tonkotsu broths. I tried the tonkotsu and chicken paitan broths and both were excellent; rich and flavorful without being over-the-top fatty or salty. I generally prefer thicker noodles, but thought their noodles had a perfect bite. The service staff was excellent: despite the constant bustle and noise, they remained calm, friendly, and on top of everything! They accommodated our bulky stroller and were very sweet and careful around our baby. :)\n\nWe tried all the appetizers and thought them solid but forgettable. I also had the karaage bowl; the chicken was nicely moist and fried but like the appetizers, thought them solid but forgettable. I would rather spend the money (and stomach space) on their ramen, the clear star of this show!\n\nWhile Marufuku might be one of if not the best Hakata-style ramen shops in the Bay Area, I would say it's on par with the better Hakata-style ramen-ya in SoCal (e.g., Shin-Sen-Gumi) which don't have nearly the same crazy lines!

The service is very fast; the waitress got our food out quickly. I ordered the Hakata DX. Even though the bowl appeared small, it was stuffed with meat, noodles, and toppings! Very filling.\n\nBroth: delicious! Definitely the best ramen broth I've had. It didn't not feel too heavy or creamy and was well flavored.\n\nNoodles: thin noodles that go well with the broth.\n\nToppings: corn, green onion, kikurage mushroom, bean sprouts, and nori seaweed were all good. The soft boiled egg was a little over done and was not very flavorful compared to ajitama eggs I've had in other ramen restaurants. \n\nBraised pork belly (buta kakuni): well flavored but could be more tender. Since pork belly is a fatty cut of meat, I had expected it to be very tender.\n\nSimmered Pork belly (chashu): In contrast to the braised pork belly, the simmered pork belly is plain but very tender. The chashu was a bit bland compared to ones I've had at other ramen restaurants.\n\nProps to you if you made it this far through my review, I know it was long. Overall, I think eating here was a great experience, worth the wait, and well priced!", "author": "Jeannette X."}

They have a very efficient system of you putting your name and party number with your phone number into an iPad. It tells you where in line you are via text and the Yelp app. It was very convenient although long wait so don't get here hungry. \n\nThe experience was very nice and also very efficient. once you get the text/call you have five minutes to get back to the restaurant. They will check you in and will be seated once the table clears. \n\nThe food came out really fast! We ordered the chicken karaage (5 pieces) which was pretty good except they can give more of the aioli. The ramen broth was very flavorful, fresh, and overall didn't feel super fatty. It didn't taste like they used a lot of msg. The noodles were the thin kind. It soaked up the flavors of the broth well and was the right chewiness. The egg was cooked well long with the pork. All four of us really LOVED the ramen and would want to come back. They also had a Chinese New Year deal (free extra noodles). You have to show that you finished your ramen first before they offer extra noodles. \n\nTips: Will definitely take transportation here as parking in the garage is expensive. Come early with the expectation of having to wait. Would not be a place for a large party.", "author": "Sarah C."}

We made it a mission to eat at Marufuku weeks in advance and I was so happy when the day finally came. We were so serious that we made sure to line up around 4:30 for their 5pm dinner round. \n\nBecause we were one of the earlier tables, my friend got to try the Chicken Paitan DX (limited to 15 servings). It came with an entire chicken leg on a sizzling grill. So if you are a chicken fan, I suggest you get that. \n\nAt first, I was having an internal debate as to whether to have the Hakata DX or not, but that extra $4 is totally worth it.  \n\nSome highlights:\n\n-I was really impressed with the braised pork belly. It was so tender and full of flavor that I wished there was more. Although not every cut is the same- my friend's cut was a bit tough. \n\n-At one point, I forgot I had a soft boiled egg at the bottom of my bowl and wow- so good and infused with a slight sweetness. \n\n-The best part of my ramen was the broth- so rich and deep with flavor, my friend described it as \"profound\" LOL\n\nOne thing to point out is that they use thin noodles here. While I generally preferred chewier and thicker noodles, I still enjoyed my ramen. \n\nI was really close to giving them 5 stars, until I found myself hella thirsty post meal. Still a solid ramen place to check out if you are in Japantown though.", "author": "Eva L."}

This place is popular, and it looks like there's no good way to avoid the wait. Fortunately, they'll take your number and send you a text when your table is ready so you're not stuck just milling around in front of the restaurant. Japantown is also full of interesting stores to check out to pass the time. We ended up getting a table for two about 30 minutes later. The waitlist was 24 parties deep when we came back for our table around 6pm.\n\nThe restaurant itself looks quite sleek and classy for a casual dining type of place. I got the Hakata Tonkatsu and my husband got the deluxe version. The only difference we could see between the two is that his came with braised marinated pork, corn, and nori. The bowl isn't too big, but they really pack it with food. Both of our bowls came topped with mushroom, bean sprouts, green onion, simmered pork, a soft boiled egg, and ginger. I knew we were in for something good because I could see the fat floating in my broth before I dug in. I judge my ramen by the the broth, and this one is solid. It was rich and fatty, and had the creamy white color that a proper tonkatsu ought to have. Flavor wise, this is a pretty good bowl of ramen. I personally prefer the thicker style of noodle over the super thin ones they have here, but that's just a personal preference. The soup was a tad salty, but packed some strong flavor. It's a good bowl of ramen. I probably won't be making regular treks up to Japantown for it, but worth trying if you're in the area and don't mind a wait.

We came on a Sunday night and had to wait about an hour for an available table, talk about popular! The restaurant is a small space in the corner of the mall. The interior is modern, a clear difference from the mall's older look. Japanese inspired designs decorate the small space.  \n\nWe got the Takoyaki ($6.50) and it was nicely made. The batter was consistent and the diced octopus inside the five balls was fresh. I ordered the Chicken Paitan Ramen ($10.99) with medium spicy level. Don't be afraid of going for higher spice levels, this ramen restaurant isn't as hot as others. My friend got the ultra spicy and it was perfectly bearable. The ramen was delicious and generously portioned. The broth was flavorful and soupy. There is also a soft-boiled egg hidden inside the bowl, I didn't know about until halfway through my ramen! \n\nOverall, a pretty good spot if you're looking for ramen in San Francisco. They are currently quite popular, so expect the wait to range from twenty minutes to an hour. Since it's located inside the mall, the waiting area is spacious and there are many seats available for sitting throughout the mall level.", "author": "Vincent P."}

If they did I would give this place probably a 2 1/5 star. \n\nI don't really know what the craze is about for this ramen place. Sometimes I feel like people just flock to restaurants because there's a long line. It's like a placebo effect where the longer you wait the better the food will be. But TBH the food probably tastes good because you get so hungry from the wait. \n\nService: \nI give them kudos for having a texting system for letting their customers know where they are in line. Given that it's located in Japantown, there are definitely places you can roam while you wait. \n\nBUT it is a flawed system. We decided to go sit in another restaurant for some drinks  because they said the wait would be an hour. Mid-way through we got a call saying our table is ready. So naturally we panicked, downed our alcohol and rushed the waiter to give us the check. We walked knees to chest to the restaurant to find out our table wasn't ready and it'll be another 15-20 mins wait. We waited for 20 mins while some of us got a head rush from drinking our alcohol so quickly. \n\nOur waiter was really nice though and took our orders and brought out or food pretty fast. \n\nHakata Tonkotsu - This ramen was too salty for my liking. But it had a nice rich pork flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I like that they give you a whole entire egg since you don't get that often. I just wished my insides didn't feel like they were getting preserved with the salts. \n\nOverall: I don't think waiting 1+ hour is ever worth it for food unless it's like the only ramen place in the city.

I like the wavy, thicker noodles that has more texture. These noodles just isn't springy enough. The broth was flavorful but oh so salty.

We got a table.  No suspicious wait list.  No issue.  \nAnd I saw small parties sat at larger tables.

Most of the tables are 4-top, and if you are a party of 1 or 2, they still give you the whole table bc there aren't enough smaller table (I saw one person sitting entirely by himself at a table for 4 bc they don't ask ppl to share tables).

With so many places in San Francisco claiming to have the best ramen, it is difficult to try say which is the best.  I am no professional food critic, but the ramen here at Marufuku Ramen was very, very good that it could be a contender for best ramen in SF.  \n\nThe ramen here has a pure, naturalistic quality in that Marufuku isn't trying to be overly creative by adding items that shouldn't be added to ramen.  So many restaurants have to be inventive with their food, but I prefer for ramen to be somewhat simplistic, not to say that it can't have it's own kick.  Marufuku Ramen definitely balances creativity with tradition in serving it's ramen, and the end result?  Perfection.\n\nI ordered the Hakata DX Ramen, and it was nothing short of delicious.  The broth was perfect, the noodles were again perfect...and there were a lot of them!  The ingredients?  You guessed it, perfect.  The one bowl of ramen was monstrous and therefore was great for splitting between myself and my fiance.  Had we had more of an appetite we also would have gotten some of that karage chicken which smelled wonderful, but that's something to yearn for in our next visit to SF.\n\nI'd gladly come back to Marufuku Ramen as it seemed to be have a very authentic feel.  It was small and some of the seating somewhat resembled traditional seating in Japan - all this made for a comfortable experience.  Beware, because this restaurant is smaller, there tends to be a wait.  If you find this to be true, simply write your name on the waitlist and it'll be called out once your table is ready.

My boyfriend and I decided to give this spot a try after seeing the long line outside. We figured, hey if there's a line, the food must be amazing. Boy, we were not disappointed at all. The wait was about 30 minutes, which was definitely worth it! Now for the food:\n\nHakata DX- The soup broth was excellent. It comes with a generous portion of pork and the braised pork belly is heavenly! I especially like having corn in my ramen.\nChicken Paitan- The chicken leg was first off HUGE! And secondly, it was delicious! I prefer the soup brown of the Hakata DX to the Paitain broth, but both were yummy.\nMarufuku Salad- The soy sauce dressing was delicious as were the vegetables.\n\nMy experience here was great! I would definitely suggest giving this spot a try. I would even go as far to say that you should make a special trip just for the ramen. There are a lot of Japanese shops around the area like Daiso and Kinokuniya, so you'll have plenty to explore before or after your meal.\n\nThe only con is, there is a list by the door where you put your name. I noticed that some customers (including my party) made the mistake of not putting their name down because there is no sign indicating that such a list exists and the crowd waiting in front blocks the doorway. The restaurant should probably put a sign by the door letting everyone know to put their names down on the wait list prior to waiting.", "author": "Qi G."}

I saw a line, and, you know, lines are usually a good sign. When a restaurant has a line before it even opens, it's probably pretty good. \n\nAs you may have read in other reviews, there's a physical line and a Yelp waitlist. I believe they let everyone physically in line into the restaurant, and if you don't make the cut then you get placed into the waitlist first. Then they open up the waitlist to the public (aka within a 3 mile radius or so other reviews say). I got here around 10:45am on a Sunday and got in on the first wave.\n\nService is super quick. They seat you quickly, take your order promptly, and bring the food out pretty fast. They also top your water which is a nice touch.\n\nI got the Hakata Deluxe. The broth has excellent flavor and isn't too salty. It's probably the best part of this dish. The noodles are cooked well, definitely not over cooked. I also thought the Chashu was super tender and delicious. That's three main components that they nailed, but they did fall short in some aspects. I was pretty disappointed in the Buta Kukini (braised pork belly). It was a little tough, you'd expect it to be melt in your mouth tender. Maybe I had a bad piece in a bad batch, but I probably wouldn't get it again. Nor was the egg anything to write home about. It was cooked to a perfect doneness, but it was pretty flavorless. I'm used to marinated ramen eggs, but this one tasted pretty bland. \n\nOverall, I thought this place was pretty solid. You can't really expect every single component to be perfect. As a reference point, this place could definitely compete with ramen joints in LA (Sawtelle/Little Tokyo). Next time, I'd definitely want to try their Chicken Paitan Deluxe.", "author": "Brandon L."}

The yelp app suggests a time for you to return to check in but that time is completely inaccurate and the server also mentioned that it is inaccurate as well.\n\nThe difference between hakata tonkotsu and hakata dx is the hakata dx includes a thick piece of braised pork belly and it also includes corn and a piece of nori seaweed. If you don't care for the piece of seaweed and corn then you could save 50 cents by ordering the regular hakata tonkotsu and adding a side of braised pork belly.  The braised pork belly was about 50% fat so i wouldn't order the DX the next time I visit.  Plus the meat was really salty, not sure if it was because we didn't get seated until 8pm.

We didn't have to wait at all to get a table, but we did have to share a long table with a family which was no problem at all.\n\nWe both ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu ramen (medium spicy). I thought the medium spicy would make the broth orange/red, but the broth stayed the same color of clear with fatty droplets.

You'd think it'd be so easy to draw crowds with the cold foggy weather. Even as we're nearing June, it was pretty cold and windy this weekend. I made plans to meet a friend for lunch and we planned to get here around opening time. I arrived at 11:28 and there was already a wait before the store opened!\n\nWe didn't make the first cut but luckily we also didn't mind and were able to sit outside and catch up! After maybe a 30-40 min wait for the first round to eat and clear out (we were about 5th on the waiting list), we got seated. It's definitely not the smallest ramen joint I've seen and the decor is quite clean and contemporary with Einstein bulbs for lighting and a center island-like dining table that made seating for 3 actually quite convenient. However we noticed they weren't always efficient in seating people in this area since parties of one would sometimes occupy a setting for 3.\n\nWe started with takoyaki ($6.5) and a chicken karage bowl ($3.50) since we were going to get the Chicken Paitan DX, which came with a grilled half chicken. The takoyaki was actually pretty good.  I'm pretty picky about good takoyaki since Japan has forever ruined me. It has to be crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. This takoyaki certainly had a crispy shell but almost slightly too thin (like a crepe br\u00fbl\u00e9e sugar layer on top the cracks open). Nonetheless I think many places don't execute the crispness at all and so I give them props! Chicken karage was decent but not the most spectacular I've had. It was a little on the dry side. \n\nI chose to order the Hakata Tonkatsu ($10.99) since it was classic and simple and I like my chasu simmered. It came with bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, and a full soft boiled egg. I also thought there was quite a decent amount of ramen. The DX version is about $4 more and has corn and braised pork belly but I just ordered extra corn on the side and I didn't exactly care to have braised pork belly. For the price of the bowl, I was quite impressed because this would have been probably more expensive elsewhere for the portion size, the full soft boiled egg, etc. And the broth was delicious!\n\nMy friend had the chicken paitan DX ($15.99) and I have to say I don't think I've had chicken ramen before. I am now a fan. The broth was very soothing and delicious..less fatty than the tonkatsu broth and I would get it next time. I could taste the chicken flavors and it was cleaner than my broth with a different complexity. The grilled Half chicken came on the side and was quite delicious! We split this and we're SUPER full by the time we finished. Only 15 orders of this a day so snag it early if you want it!\n\nStaff was super friendly and nice. Food didn't take too long to come.

The bowl of ramen is seriously beautiful, with a bit of oil glistening on top.

Great location for a busy ramen shop.\n\nNow back to the food-- I was very pleased with quality of their ramen. At first I was a little apprehensive at the simplicity of their menu. Seriously it only seemed as if there were pork or chicken available plus a slightly fancier variation of each. However, do not be fooled! Think quality over quantity. Their meat is tender and roasted to perfection-- none of that tough stuff you find in instant ramen packs! A full-bodied broth envelops an admirable portion of chewy noodles and tender vegetables. To finish it all off, at the bottom of every bowl there is a soft-boiled egg that is sort of like a hidden treasure for the unsuspecting meal-goer. Ugh.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-26", "description": "First off, you're probably here because this is the number one ramen place on Yelp in the Japantown area, or you saw the crazy line. If it's the former, and you don't know about the lines yet... let me tell you: you need to show up here 30 minutes before opening and stand in line, otherwise you'll surely be waiting much much longer than the 30 minutes you waited for it to open. Folks line up and it gets unbelievably long, to the point where it seems like a grand opening (but it's actually a normal day). If you don't make it before the line gets crazy, you'll end up putting your name into an iPad, which means you can walk around and explore Japantown while you wait. \n\nNow, the ramen. They have regular option and deluxe option. Basically the deluxe option adds a higher quality chunk of meat to your \"regular\" meat that's included in the regular option. I opted for the deluxe with pork to see what all the hype was about, and it was definitely worth it. The meat was so tender and flavorful, and definitely beat out the regular pork. It also made the portion significantly larger since they basically just increase the meat level from the regular dish. The broth was incredibly flavorful, on both the pork and the chicken options. \n\nOne thing that was odd was my entire family agreed that we had a terrible taste in our mouths (literally, not figuratively) after eating there, even including those of us who got different broth types. We did get a pork bun type of appetizer as well (which I wasn't a fan of), so we can't exactly pinpoint what it was that caused the unpleasant aftertaste...but it lasted for like a whole 24 hours later. \n\nOverall I might go there again just to show someone that there's this ramen place that is so popular that the line gets that long, and it's actually very good, but I think I would be just as satisfied with any ol' ramen place that had less of a wait and hopefully doesn't leave a bad taste in my mouth. Additionally, the level of constant business that they have seems to make the wait staff less attentive and friendly, which isn't a good excuse when you're waiting that long for what should be a superb experience. 4 stars sustained because the food is very good.", "author": "Elena S."}

There was already a line but I was able to get seated pretty quickly once they opened. I was sat at the bench seating area in the middle of the restaurant which was so spacious (I was able to put my backpack next to me) but a little hard to get in and out of especially in a dress. The waitress came right away to get my order. The wait for food was also short. I ordered a spicy HAKATA TONKOTSU.  When my ramen arrived, it was a glorious sight to behold. The pork bone stock that they say has been cooking for over 20 hours glistened and called out to me. I took a spoonful of the broth and let the richness of the soup sweep over my tongue. It was delicious but really spicy! I was a little startled at how spicy it was. I probably should've gotten medium or mild. My spice tolerance has been ever dwindling since I left home. \n\nThe pork was a little bit firm but not too hard to chew. The fresh and crisp bean sprouts and chewy, thin noodles went so well together and delivered textural bliss. I had forgotten about the stewed soft-boiled egg so it came as a pleasant surprise once uncovered. The yolk was perfectly runny and so yummy. I usually don't care for whole eggs but this beauty was such a wonder for the senses with its soft, liquid-y center and flavorful caramel exterior. The waiters were quite attentive. My cup of water was constantly being filled. When the waiter came with the check, he made sure to tell me to please take my time as I was finishing my last bites and sips. I'm glad he saved me the trouble of flagging someone down. I'm definitely coming back here to try the Hakata DX! When I left around 6:30pm, there was a crowd of people waiting outside. Better to come early next time too!", "author": "Lauren H."}

To start, the chicken karaage was slightly dry and overfried, but still quite tasty, especially when dipped in what appeared to be an aioli-like sauce on the side.\n\nThe real star, though, was the hakata DX ramen bowl, which is the same thing as the hakata tonkotsu, just with more of everything. Indeed, given the price of the DX bowl, I'd say you're getting good value for your money - a generous helping of pork belly and other ingredients like corn, bean sprouts, and mushrooms, with the added bonus of a soft boiled egg sitting underneath. The broth wasn't too rich but wasn't bland either - just the right level in between.\n\nA dependable venue for ramen in Japantown.

The doors were open when I got to the place already, and there was a sign-in sheet at the table, so I put my name down (there were 4 people on top of my name already) and started walking around the mall. Then when I went back 20 mins later, there was a line formed, I was thinking if there's a sign-in sheet why would people line-up? It turned out the sign-in sheet didn't really mean anything, I guess it's for later use but at its opening it would be a first-come-first-serve.

But we were there and hungry and had hunted it down after a snafu with google maps, so we were committed. They let you enter your name on an iPad via NoWait and then text you when your table is ready, and you can also see real time updates via Yelp! \n\nAfter shopping around JapanCenter for about an hour we came back for our table and got a 4 top to ourselves which was nice, as it was slowing down since they were getting ready to close soon before reopening at 5 for dinner. I geek out over Japanese pottery, and theirs is gorgeous and irregular and perfect. We split a Shensho spicy beer, shishito peppers, chashu pork buns, and I got the tonkatsu dx ramen and she got the chicken paitan. They had a chicken paitan dx but only make 15 servings a day!

After we got seated our orders were taken almost right away, good thing we had so much time in line to think about what we were going to have. My friend and I decided on a Hakata Tonkotsu - Medium spicy and Karaage Bowl. \n\nThe Karaage Bowl came first, it was a small portion of rice with 3 pieces of fried chicken. I was hoping for more chicken, as the rice to chicken portion was very off. I ended up adding some of the ramen broth into my rice to add flavor. The chicken was juicy and tender, but did not have a crispy outer layer. I was slightly disappointed with this dish. \n\nThe Hakata Tonkotsu however, was well worth our wait. The broth was creamy, but on the saltier side. It seemed they added a lot of ginger, as it wasn't too spicy but had a kick in the end. What made the dish come together was the thin chewy noodles, I loved them. The kikurage mushrooms were a nice addition as well, the texture blended well with the noodles. \n\nAlthough the food was memorable, the service was not. It was very rushed, and the moment my friend put his chopsticks down, staff came over to ask if he was finished and took his bowl away. But, this practice is common in Japan. \n\nTheir ramen really stands out, and the long line of customers can prove it.

Service was attentive, though it took longer than expected to get the rice bowl.\n\nUnfortunately, given the high expectations I had based on what I read bout the restaurant, I was disappointed by my meal.  I think I'm realizing that I'm not a big fan of the hakata ramen style with it's thin, straight noodles, and my ramen noodles came in unwieldy clumps that made it difficult to enjoy.  I appreciated the spiciness of the broth but felt that it was relatively one-note in terms of depth.  The karaage bowl was sizable, though I thought the chicken was under-seasoned.  This was not a bad meal by any means, but I just did not get the hype.", "author": "Keith H."}

We probably waited at least an hour but it's nice that they have a texting system to let you know when your table is almost ready. I ordered the hakata Tonkotsu and my fiance ordered the hakata DX (deluxe). The difference was that he had a braised pork belly piece, corn, and nori. Worth the extra $4? For me, no but he liked the braised pork belly. I thought it was too flossy. The simmered pork belly that comes in both bowls was delicious. It was melt-in-your-mouth soft and very flavorful. I ordered medium and my fiance ordered spicy. Medium was already pretty spicy. The noodles here are very thin, which I didn't mind. The bowls look small but they don't skimp on the amount of noodles. You get three slices of simmered pork belly and some sprouts, ginger, and scallions. You also get a whole egg. Mine was almost half not soft boiled but my fiance's was all soft boiled. The soup was a bit too rich for me (I like to drink my ramen soup). All in all, they serve a satisfying bowl of ramen.", "author": "Christine L."}

It's a giant piece but has a dry, overcooked texture.  If you're set on getting the tonkatsu I would suggest just getting the regular.\n- it does get busy so if you don't plan ahead there can be a significant wait, especially with groups\n\nSummary:  one of the solid 3 legit Ramen places on my east-bay list (with Ippudo in Berkeley and Yuzu in Emeryville), notable for their Chicken broth.

Marufuku's ramen isn't your typical \"basic\" ramen. A few things set Marufuku apart from the rest of the pack. 1) Unlike other ramen places, Marufuku uses a skinny noodle - I suppose that's part of the \"Hakata style\". 2) The broth was thicker than most other places and it had a good garlic-y pork flavor. 3) Supposedly everything was hand made (the noodles?).\n\nLowlights:\nThe only lowlight here is there's normally a very long wait because it's a small space.

The atmosphere is very laid back and active as I welcomed there. The concept is much similar to Shoki Ramen House in Sacramento (i.e. 21st Street location) with soft amber smooth jazz music, modern Japanese decors and dimmed lights across the whole compact room.\n\nThe employees from hosts, servers and cookers are doing an awesome job for accommodating the customers like me a spectacular service despite the busiest environment on both lunch and dinner peak times. No cons at all!\n\nNow onto the experience! I ordered both items on the menu: the Hakata Tonkotsu in mild spiciness and Karaage (aka Japanese style fried chicken). As I ate these two, it tasted marvelous and delicious after my orders did arrived in less than 5 minutes! The Hakata ramen cooked perfectly and eatable to bite which I did feel the fresh authentic Ramen noodles in ease! The Tonkotsu broth also tasted wonderful and spell-binding which I did feel the pork flavors of that broth thanks to the combination of simmered pork belly, soft-boiled egg, green onions, kikurage mushrooms and bean sprouts. On the other hand, the Chicken Karaage is da bomb goodness! I can feel the batter flavors of that fried chicken as well as the seasonings of wedge lemon and a special fresh mustard with powdered paprika combined. Delish dinner meal after waited 30 minutes on the waitlist clipboard after it opened its business hours at 5 pm. Not bad!\n\nParking at Marufuku Ramen can be quite challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street nor the parking garage if it's available. You can also alternatively ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmick.\n\nIn the end, Marufuku Ramen is the most unbelievable local Japanese Ramen restaurant that I've ever visited for the first time!

Typical ramen shops lacks protein, but this one comes with the gigantic chicken thigh+legs so it was a must get for me :D (being the salubrious protein lover I am). In addition to the chicken, there was also meat AND a whole egg in ramen. Flavor wise, brother was a tad too oily for my liking, but flavors were delicious nonetheless. \n+ HAKATA DX $15: main bae of this shop.

My friend and I both ordered the Hakata Tonkatsu as we prefer tonkatsu broth over chicken, and made one bowl spicy - Japanese spicy is honestly very mild though, and I actually enjoyed the original more because the pork flavor was so fragrant. The thin noodles were a nice chewy consistency, there were THREE pieces of tender pork belly, and the soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor. I wish there had been slightly more toppings (bean sprouts and wood ear mushroom slices) but other than that it was a delicious bowl of ramen. \n\nWhen I first saw my friend's pictures of Marufuku, I was wary of the portion size because the bowl looked so small, but I guess you can fit more thin noodles into a bowl than regular noodles LOL.

Maybe even a 5, though I usually reserve that for Ippudo. \n\nService is a 4. My first server was lovely: nice big smile, friendly, thoughtful, and explained the menu. My second server was not bad but didn't smile as much or box my meal- hence the 4 instead of 5. \n\nBut what honestly killed it for me was the heat. No, not the spiciness of the ramen, but the fact that Marufuku's AC was broken (granted it's in the middle of winter here). So eating here is like eating in Dante's Inferno. Or for short, like hell. \n\nAnd you know what? Each time I passed this place and attempted to put my name down on the waitlist before, it was always too warm. So I don't think they'll be fixing their heat problem anytime soon if they haven't already for months.\n\nBut I did see 2 very smart girls who got ramen togo and ate right inside the mall on a bench - away from the inferno inside the restaurant, which kills your appetite and ability to enjoy the food since your eating ramen in like 90 degrees.\n\nSo I would say if you want a nice sit down ramen place, pass on Marafuku and go to Hinodeya across the block (unless it's Tuesday, which in that case Hinodeya is closed). \n\nPlus Hinodeya doesn't try to gyp you when it comes to how they calculate tips. It's perhaps a small thing for others, but I find it somewhat questionable of Marafuku to pre-calculate tip off of both the subtotal, tax, and SF health mandate. I've got no problem paying the tax and health mandate since I like our city to be funded and employees with health insurance. I'm all for it. But tip is given based quality of the food and service you received. Given food and customer service were things I received but I wasn't given health insurance from Marufuku, I find it unsettling that they inflate their pre-calculated tip amounts on the receipt with the heath mandate. Again Hinodeya - the reputable ramen place next door - doesn't do that, and the room temperature is fine there.\n\nBut if you're cool with togo ramen and to avoid getting gypped with inflated tipping, order togo here. For context, I've been to Hokkaido's ramen shop - the one graced by Anthony Bourdain's presence (+ photograph and autos graph), the first shop in Sapporo's Ramen Alley, and I will say the chicken/tori paitan broth here is indeed GOOD. So I wouldn't write off Marafuku's craftsman ship - just how they run their business.\n\nP.S. just read my former classmate's review (who is a die hard foodie not to mention consecutive yelp elite for the past 4 Years) and I want to post an addendum: the soft boiled egg here is. Indeed. FABULOUS. Daresay perhaps the best I ever had with ramen. The consistency, softness , temperature is just right. (Problem is its so HOT in the restaurant, it's really hard to focus and enjoy the food when it's done right because you're burning up. O and I saw a couple of other patrons sitting by the door fanning themselves. So yes, I am upset - upset that I couldn't properly enjoy their fabulous ramen coz they couldn't fix their AC.)", "author": "Elena C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-11", "description": "I've eaten here several times with my family.\n\nOne of the best ramens I've ever had.\n\nI usually get the tonkatsu ramen. I once got the deluxe version but found that there wasn't really any difference (maybe the soup base was a little better). The ramen soup base itself is very rich and isn't too salty. I would recommend not getting any spiciness in it. I feel like it gets in the way of the rich broth. The pork belly is very tender and soft which makes it a delight to bite into. It has the perfect balance of sweetness and richness. Also, there are other things like corn, seedweed, etc. which give another great aspect of flavor \n\nAlso, you should definitely order the extra noodles for $2.5 (used to be $2) which is a really good deal in my book. Since there is plenty of the soup base left, might as well spend a couple of bucks to consume basically another meal with rich flavor.\n\nI've also gotten the chicken karaage and the fried octopus which was really good. I think they raised the price by a couple of dollars but definitely worth a try. It's a pretty simplistic batter but the quality of the chicken and octopus really shines in it's flavor. Also, they provide Japanese Mayo on the side which has the perfect unami/saltiness combo.\n\nOverall, inside the restaurant, the environment is very beautiful. In the middle, there are two light up benches which are really pretty. On the outskirts, there are booths and tables. Regardless of where you sit, you'll enjoy the ample space and comfort.\n\nIn terms of service, I found the waiters and waitresses to be really busy most of the time which is understandable. So, you do have to make an extra effort to get more water, etc.\n\nOverall, the price is very fair and comparable to other ramen places. But, the quality of the food, enviornmemt, and service puts Marafuku miles ahead of other ramen places.", "author": "Ethan C."}

The restaurant is kind of small which explains why the wait for it is pretty long if you don't get here early.

The broth had such a impactful burst of flavor, and the braised pork belly itself had SO SO much flavorful umami. Their Hakata DX Ramen bowls are $15.99 but it's definitely worth the price. The meat was so tender and flavorful that it worked in harmony if you ate it together with the soup. The richness of the broth really enhances the flavors of every component in the ramen, and the portion size is actually good enough to fill you up, despite how small the bowl may look!\n\nI also ordered their chicken karaage and it was pretty good! The skin was lightly crispy, and the chicken was actually pretty big! Normally chicken karaage would be small bite sizes, but the chicken was a lot bigger than that! But I wouldn't say that it particularly stood out, but their yuzu mayo dip really complemented the karaage and it made it taste so much better. \n\nI would most definitely recommend this place because it is bomb.com!

We stalked the place 30 minutes before opening. Nobody in sight. T minus 15 minutes and people started hovering around.  A line formed 3 minutes before opening. If you arrive 10 minutes before on a weekday, you should be golden. The restaurant filled to capacity within a few minutes.  When we left, there was a line.\n\nOrdered the chicken karrage. The chicken arrived hot and crispy. The meat was tender and juicy. Pretty good.\n\nI ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu DX. My companion ordered the Chicken Paitan DX. Each ramen bowl includes green onions, kikurage mushroom and bean sprouts. \n\nThe Hakata Tonkotsu DX upgrade gives you braised pork belly and corn.  The Hakata style noodles are thinner and were not optimal for me but were not deal breakers either. They are freshly made. The pork broth was rich and delicious. The braised pork had a sweet flavor. The meat was not tofu soft but was tender enough. Had the right amount of fat. I enjoyed it. The soft boiled egg was nicely done and submerged in the broth. You could miss it. The bowl is not wide but it is deep. Some of your toppings will sink.\n\nThe Chicken Paitan DX upgrade provides you with corn and grilled chicken on the side. The chicken arrived sizzling and was delicious and tender.  Chicken broth was lighter than the pork. Slightly saltier. You will get more protein for your dollar with the Chicken Paitan DX but there's only a 15 servings limit for this dish.  Augment with chicken karrage. \n\nIf you want the leanest meal, then the chicken ramen is your ticket.  But if you are not worried about a little fat for more flavor enjoyment; pork is the way to go. They have a scale for how much spice you want in your ramen. Mild spice is the lowest on the hotness scale and it is barely noticeable.  Medium spicy is probably the way to go for some heat without decimating your tongue. If you like drinking molten lava, then go ultra spicy. \n\nThe remodeled Japanese interior is hip and modern. Nice space to eat and be seen.\n\nService was friendly and very efficient. They need to maximize their margins by increasing table turnover with the waiting horde outside.\n\nThis place is very convenient to go to being in Japantown.

You can't get away with soft-boiled eggs, pork belly, and tonkotsu--it'd better be tori paitan or *top-notch* tonkotsu, boast a unique signature ramen style, and arrive presented in a beautiful ceramic bowl that looks like it could have been in a museum collection. Oh, and there must be at least a 15-minute wait and, of course, no less than 4 stars on Yelp.\n\nDespite these skyrocketing standards, Marufuku exceeded my expectations. I actually like it more than Hinodeya, another newly opened bouge ramen shop nearby specializing in dashi broth; however, Hinodeya seems a tad bit more pretentious, the prices are higher, and the quantities are smaller. \n\nMarufuku has a rather basic menu with starters, small rice bowls, and two main types of ramen: the tonkotsu and the paitan, both available regular for $15 or DX for $11. While the tonkotsu DX comes with braised pork belly (vs simmered for the regular), the paitan DX features a whopping plate of grilled chicken on the side. The bowls are whimsically asymmetrical and although it looks a bit small, it is filled with a decent portion of noodles and makes satisfying meal. \n\nThe CHICKEN PAITAN was outstanding. If you squint,, you can almost detect what tastes like ginseng. It seems to combine the techniques of Chinese chicken soup with tori paitan for a grainy texture, robust chicken flavors, and an aromatic complex finish. The chicken chashu was unique as well, tender like pork chashu but with a umami, brined taste.\n\nThe HAKATA TONKOTSU was excellent as well, with a tonkotsu broth on point and not too salty. The simmered pork belly was melty and delicious, a bit roasty and with its share of fat almost reminiscent of porchetta :3 \n\nAs indicated by the hakata style labeling, the noodles are the thin white kind, rather than the springy curly yellow ones. The plain noodles do accentuate the rich broths but al dente die-hards may not be fans of the different ramen style.\n\nComplimentary toppings were standard, though as several reviewers have pointed out the egg is serious business. It's on the runnier side that is more liquid than semi-solid soft-boiled eggs, so be sure to eat it off the spoon.\n\nThe interior is bright, i.e. good lighting to take pictures of your photogenic ramen!) The decor is a mix of traditional Japanese (with tatamis) and modern (the edison bulbs are like a subliminal sign of hipster subculture).\n\nTips:\n*You can choose no spicy, mild, spicy, and ultra spicy. I chose spicy and it turned out moderately spicy. (The paitan is already a bit spicy from the ginger)\n*There's a sign-in list and usually a group of people waiting outside, but the \n*One order of the regular ramen per person is good if you want to save space for dessert in Japantown afterwards P:", "author": "Edna C."}

Its in the japantown center mall and relatively small in size but the ramen they make is worth it. Word to the wise, like most popular places in the city, if you come during busy times like the weekend or dinner time expect a wait. The best time to come is during the week around the afternoon. FYI if there is a wait up front, go to the door and put your name on their seating list, it can be hidden if there is a big crowd of people in front but if there is a line just go right to the door and put your name down. They are pretty good at turning over tables so long as people don't linger. Understand that traditionally when you go to a ramen shop, you order, eat, pay and leave, thats it. Save the talking for after your meal else where, This is something I think a lot of folks in the states don't understand which adds to stupid long wait times. \nOn my visit got the takoyaki and chicken karrage. The takoyaki was average nothing special. The chicken on the other hand was well cooked, crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. For my ramen I got the Hakata DX ramen, pretty much this is their pork/tonkotsu ramen with everything in it and man it is sooo damn good. First off the broth is so rich and fatty and flavorful, you can taste the pork in it instead of just salt like some places. The condiments were all pretty standard corn, mushrooms, green onion, bean sprouts, and a piece of nori. The soft boiled egg here was excellent, actually cooked perfectly with the yolk still runny, I know its not much to most people but I've found that a lot of other ramen places can't get this right and its the attention to detail which makes me like this place even more. The ramen I got came with the braised and simmered pork and wow was it amazing. The pork just falls apart and has a rich meaty flavor. Not over seasoned or dry it really elevates the ramen with the broth. I got the ramen in the mild flavor and you do have the option of adding spice/heat to you ramen when you order, my friend got their ramen with added heat and thought it was good. \nThis is now my go to spot for tonkotsu/pork ramen in the city and I definitely think its worth a try if you like ramen as much as I do.", "author": "Peter P."}

The egg was pretty cool too, a whole egg that's soft boiled and oozing with yolk when you bite into it.  Noodles were decent, chewy and fresh.  The ultra spicy wasn't that spicy; I feel like Nongshim is spicier.", "author": "Adam B."}

And hello... that ramen was just the best thing I've eaten in a while. The paitan broth flavor was just sooooo effing good that I can't even articulate the deliciousness! I also want to mention that along with the ramen noodles, it had ALL my fave toppings: lots of green onion, corn, and a boiled egg. The grilled chicken was served on a sizzling platter and had this sweet tangy delectable glaze that made me want to keep stuffing my face (we were getting pretty full sharing the ramen and  2 small rice bowls which we ended up taking to go).

They proceeded to fill up the entire restaurant to capacity. There was still a small line remaining outside the door. Then i watched as the tables next to us received water, their appetizers and ramen before us. We flagged them down majority of the time, twice having to ask where our order was. They were very apologetic. Our food came staggered still. The Chicken Kaarage went room temperature while we waited for plates and more water.\n\nThe ramen was very good though. I was happy to have some hakata style ramen. The deluxe is worth the extra money. The Chicken Paitan broth here was delicious and my favorite over Mensho and Hinodeya. The Deluxe included a sizzling side of chicken leg in a sweet teriyaki like sauce. Egg was wonderfully soft boiled. The bowls looked deceivingly small. I could not eat another bite at the end!\n\nThey're new and they have service kinks to work through.

I actually had Hinodeya (also a new ramen place in Japantown) a few weeks ago, and prefer Hinodeya to Marufuku. But everyone who loves ramen should go to both and decide. They're unique in their own ways (Hinodeya is thick noodles w/ dashi (clear) broth, and Marafuku is thin noodles with rich, creamy broth). \n\nThe menu was small, which I appreciated. However, we didn't really get to choose the ramen because there were only two types of ramen options left for the evening - chicken (Paitan) and pork (Hakata) - we ordered both. What I loved about the ramen was not the noodles or soup base, rather the corn, mushrooms, soft boiled egg, nori, green onions, and bean sprouts. You also personalize how spicey you'd want your soup. I picked medium spicey and that wasn't spicey at all. \n\nPaitan (chicken) DX came with a HUGE piece of grilled chicken leg on the side. It was super sized and flavorful (tho too sweet for my taste). The ramen itself came with thin noodles that were overly cooked (they were soft, and usually I like my ramen noodles hard so they can finish cooking in the broth as I eat). The broth was rich, but too rich for me, and a bit too salty. I did enjoy the first few bites, but soon enough the noodles were too soft and soup was too salty so I couldn't finish. \n\nHakata DX  came with a fat piece and three slices of pork belly, which was fat, sweet and tender. The ramen noodles were also too soft for me, and soup base was rich & salty. I guess the upside to a salty soup base = more water for me. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the first few bites to everything we ordered, but found myself wanting to eat less and less with each bite because it was too rich (soup base), too salty (soup base), or too fatty (pork). Price is fair (~$11 for a regular bowl of ramen, $15 for a deluxe bowl of ramen), there is also the SF health mandate tax.", "author": "Dana Z."}

Here at Marufuku you get a flavorful pork broth (tastes like actual pork and isn't extra creamy) with thin noodles whose hardness you can control. You can also control the spiciness level and add on toppings for a few extra bucks (no substitutes though). \n\nMy OG hakata tonkotsu came with few small slices of chashu (the pork wasn't dry or tough for once), bean sprouts, ginger, sesame seeds, green onions, and mushroom. Everything tasted incredibly fresh so I really enjoyed it. \n\nThe best part was forgetting that the ramen came with an egg and discovering it halfway through the meal and then biting into the egg to discover that its insides were still runny--a true ajitama.

I've actually never been to Sapporo-Ya, but it looks like they've totally remodeled the space for the better.  The decor is bright and cozy much similar to Hinodeya across the street.\n\nThe menu that they had when I went there said 'temporary' (http://bit.ly/2mj2FbJ), so I'm going to assume they're still in soft opening mode and that it might be tweaked here and there after it's initial phase.  I'm glad to see that they specialize in Hakata style ramen which I haven't had since Kagura in San Mateo had closed down.\n\nAlthough I had a hard time deciding between their Hakata or Paitan ramen, ultimately I was in the mood for their Hakata ramen with their braised pork belly.  And also I ordered their gyoza to start.\n\nHakata DX -- http://bit.ly/2miZjoZ\nHakata style ramen, pork broth, braised pork belly, kikurage mushrooms, soft boiled egg, corn, green onion, nori, bean sprouts\nI wouldn't say it's better than Kagura's Hakata style ramen, but it's pretty good nonetheless.  The noodles were thin, the broth was rich, and the soft boiled egg was nice and runny.  What got my attention the most though was their pork belly.  It was a huge tender brick of pork goodness!  I would definitely order this again.\n\nGyoza -- http://bit.ly/2mj0JzZ\nStandard gyoza here.  I would've liked it to have been a little more fried up to give it a crispy texture, but it was still good.\n\nWhile the food was good, service needs some work.  The place wasn't too busy when I was there and when I arrived, the customers that were there were already eating.  So I knew that my order would arrive right away.  My gyoza arrived first with no issues.  \n\nAnother customer came in and sat at the table next to me and then placed his order.  Then as I could see my Hakata DX bowl coming out from the kitchen, the server gave it to customer sitting beside me.  From what I overheard, he ordered a Hakata regular bowl spicy.  So when he was eating it, he asked the server if his ramen was spicy and then server looked confused.  I told him that I think they served him my Hakata DX bowl.  Then he went back to the kitchen and served me the Hakata regular bowl spicy that the other customer had ordered.  Huh?! So another server came by and told him he mixed up our orders.  \n\nI'll give him a pass because they just opened, but it does scratch my head how the server would mess that up.  So they gave customer next to me his bowl that was served to me while I had to wait a little bit longer for another Hakata DX bowl, which came out pretty quickly, so kudos to them for the comeback.  What did bother me a little bit was how the customer next to me was apologized to and was checked on a lot.  While for me it seemed like I was being ignored since they gave me my correct bowl.  Not once did any server come back to check on me.  So that rubbed off on me the wrong way.\n\nOverall, the ramen at Marufuku was good enough for me to warrant another visit.  I do want to try their Paitan ramen and other appetizers.  I just hope that service has been improved by then.", "author": "Rodney H."}

One Saturday evening, when my curiosity has gotten the better of me, I placed my name on the sign-in sheet and walked around the mall for twenty minutes. I got back just in time to hear my name being called. I was promptly seated and when I look at the menu, there are five levels of spiciness for the ramen. After much deliberation between the Chicken Paitan and the Hakata Tonkotsu, I chose the Chicken Paitan, with a level of ultra-spicy to go with it naturally. \n\nWhen my dish arrived, I sampled the broth and remember that it's not really spicy, in my opinion maybe it's just a slight notch above sriracha in terms of spiciness. However, they heaped a generous helping of kikurage mushrooms and a big slab of chicken on top of my ramen. The chicken went very well with the broth, and I think they couldn't have made the broth any spicier since it might overpower the chicken's natural flavor. Overall, it was a great meal, since I finished the broth and remember feeling satisfied.  \n\nWith the ramen priced at $11, I think that this place has a strong offering for ramen enthusiasts at a very good price point since most ramen places charge anywhere from $10-15 for their ramen in SF. I left the meal wondering if I should have shelled out an extra four dollars for the Chicken Paitan DX instead (it comes with a big slab of grilled chicken leg as a side in addition to the Chicken Paitan ramen).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-18", "description": "Mmmm. Apparently rated the best ramen in Seattle & the Bay Area- Marufuku had some high hopes to fill- and they definitely are well worth the long wait time & hype. A definite recommend if you're looking for some bomb ramen! \n\nI came here with 2 of my younger siblings here and waited here for about 20-25 minutes at around 12 before we were seated. The waiters here were very kind. Extremely prompt service despite how crowded it was.\n\nKaarage Bowl ($4)- Very generously portioned, it came with green onions and very finely sliced seaweed bits on top of their Japanese Chicken & rice. Their Japanese chicken was cooked very nicely and was crisped nicely with flavor. I was surprised at how much the bowl really filled me up and how pleasantly surprised I was by their chicken. I'd order this again, but I think to be fair I also paired it with their really flavorful broth from my Tonkatsu.\n\nTonkatsu Ramen ($15)- For me while I thoroughly enjoyed it- my critique of it so far like everyone else's was-\n\n1) The pork broth was REALLY potent in flavor. So rich and flavorful, I really enjoyed and LOVED their broth here. It wasn't too salty, and it packed a huge favor punch. Completely solid broth- I loved it so much, and pairing it with my rice from my Kaarage bowl added so much flavor back into the bottom of the bowl of rice.\n2) Chasew was cooked nicely, but I think I prefer Hinodeya Ramen Bar's chasew a lot more, something about the way they cook theirs really was magical to me. Still, it was cooked very well- super soft and flavorful, and no real complaints here. Their egg is also perfectly soft boiled and delicious.\n3) Their noodles, while amazing were also probably not my favorite style of them- I prefer a noodle that's a little thicker, as the noodles here are on the thinner side. However, they were soft and enjoyable to consume. My siblings had taken a few bites of my Ramen and enjoyed it so much they devoured most of my bowl.\n\nThe servers- also seeing I was accompanied by young kids also brought out really cute froggy bowls for them to eat out of- which was really sweet and then much later needed when my siblings discovered how much they loved their ramen here. Shout out to the servers for being so attentive and for also checking up often to see if we needed anything.\n\nMy review may be slightly biased, since I had taken my younger siblings here and they absolutely fell in love with Marufuku. They told me coming to Japantown that the food here was probably the best ramen they've ever eaten- and while I do love it as well- I'd have to rate them a 4.75 leaning to a 5, my only reason why it's not quite hitting a 5 is solely bc there are minor bits and pieces that don't match my own personal preferences. HOWEVER, it's definitely probably one of the best ramen places I've ever had. I highly doubt if you came here you'd be disappointed. Definite recommend especially for some bomb ramen in Japantown!", "author": "Allison O."}

Definitely quite popular and busy - the wait was about 1.5 hours for a table for one, but so worth it.  For starters, Marufuku with the help of Yelp reservations, does a good job with making sure the online reservation portion is streamlined.  It is quite simple and was not that difficult to do at all.  I was immediately seated once my table was ready, and the wait staff promptly brought me my water and utensils.  I ordered the spicy hakata tonkotsu ramen and was blown away.  It's been since May 2018 when I was last there, but I still remember EVERY taste and minute of my experience.  The spicy was not as spicy as I thought, and if I ever go back, I would try their ultra spicy since I like my ramen with a kick!  Although each ingredient contributed to my fantastic ingredient, I have to emphasize how pure the broth was.  The pork broth that was probably simmered for several hours was so thin, but also rich.  It wasn't overly salty at all and I usually never drink the whole broth in ramen, but at Marufuku, I had to.  It was just absolutely so pleasant and their time and attention to their ramen was very evident.  The pork belly was ample and very tender, and the soft boiled egg was perfect!  It wasn't too runny and just so perfect with the whole dish.  I will never forget Marufuku and unfortunately, they've ruined it for me for all the Japanese ramen places on the East coast.  My journey to attempt to find a place similar here in New York City begins now.", "author": "Hannah L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-17", "description": "Rarely do I go against the grain on Yelp when it comes to ramen, but I simply cannot agree with the 4.5 stars that Marufuku currently has as of the time I am writing this or the claim that is the \"best ramen in SF.\"\n\nI got the Hakata DX with extra chashu. Solid bowl, but I really did expect better. As usual I primarily rate my ramen on three things: (1) broth, (2) pork, and (3) noodles.\n\n1. The tonkotsu broth is excellent and about on par with the best places I've had. Very rich with flavor as a proper tonkotsu broth shoud be. Medium spicy really isn't that spicy...it provides a little kick, nothing more than that. No complaints on the broth.\n2. The pork is very tender (both the chashu and thicker pork belly), but I greatly disagree with the direction they take on giving the pork a sweet flavor. It provides a serious clash of flavors that really doesn't work IMO. Honestly, the pork being sweet ruined the consistency of the bowl for me.\n3. To be fair, I'm not really a huge fan of Hakata-style ramen noodles because in most situations, the noodles don't carry the flavor of the broth very well. That's what I thought here. Cooking the noodles a little bit harder made it difficult for them to absorb the broth's flavor. Definitely felt there were a few bites where the noodles felt almost flavorless.\n\nThe egg is cooked the way I prefer (soft-boiled), but it also carried some sweet tendencies as well. Again, not a fan of that.\n\nStaff here is really friendly, I have zero complaints about the service here.\n\nAs with any popular ramen spot, you gotta come about 15-30 minutes before it opens or else you will definitely be stuck behind the first wave of people. Personally, that's probably as long as I would wait for here. Wouldn't wait longer than that.\n\nIMO if this restaurant was in L.A., there's no way the rating is as high as it is. Just goes to show that SF is shockingly lacking in elite ramen options.", "author": "Alexander Y."}

The mister and I both ordered their Tonkotsu ramen; I got spicy and he got non-spicy. We also ordered their octopus leg as an appetizer. Everything came together at once, which wasn't a big deal. Soup base was good, as it had a lot of flavor. Their noodles were also on point and cooked perfectly. The cha-siu was a bit too fatty for me so I came him all three of my pieces. The spice level was pretty weak for my taste, but it was a good compliment. Their soft boiled egg was also perfect. I usually judge a ramen place by their egg and the texture of their noodles.

Let's dive into the details of the ramen, shall we? \n\nThe soup. Yes, dear lord, probably one of the best broths in ramen I've ever had. And the noodles were cooked to perfection!! I am a fan of snappy thin ramen noodles, not the thicker kind, so I'm a little biased. However, those were the only two elements of the ramen that I truly enjoyed. The meat was very sweet, and I felt like it clashed with the savory umami flavor of the soup. The quality of the meat was very, very good though. And the egg was also weirdly sweet, which I also did not like. It is also important to note that I do not care to mix salty and sweet flavors, so if you do like that kind of thing you will probably like the meat and egg. \n\nHowever, I was bummed since those two things are crucial to ramen, and I didn't like either of them.

Make sure to place your name on the waiting list, then you can walk around the cute Japantown plaza to kill some time.\n\nThey serve Hakata style ramen here (aka tonkotsu + thin ramen noodles, just the type of noodles I like, I love them!). Their thin noodles are similar kind to Ichiran and Ippudo. \n\nI've tried a good portion of their menu: Hakata Tonkotsu, Hakata DX, Chicken Paitan DX, Chicken Karrage, Takoyaki, and Geso Fry. \n\nTheir soup base is so on point. They have a range from no spicy all the way to ultra spicy so there's definitely one that'll suite your taste buds best. Personally, I always get the ultra spicy, it just hits me at the right spot. I find it rare for Japanese ramen restaurants to actually follow through with their spicy level since usually their hottest options are just an illusion after you taste it (of course, aside from Ramen Yamadaya's hell and death ramen, I don't mess). \n\nMain difference between Hakata's Tonkotsu (default go-to) and their DX is their pork belly vs. the braised pork. Just in the preference of meat. Don't let the bowl deceive you. It's actually a bowl of bottomless noodles. Had a friend where he got deceived by the eyes and ordered extra noodles (the Kaedama- Hakata style), he suffered after, so order at your own risk!

Standard. \n\nTakoyaki.. fresh, HOT, and of course, an octopus filled center. One of the better Takoyaki's I've had. \n\nAndddd lastly, the Geso Fry... aka the fried squid legs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-23", "description": "During college I couldn't imagine standing in line for and paying more than a few bucks for ramen.  I mean, top ramen with an egg dropped into it on the stovetop, or drained of the liquid and topped with oyster sauce; that was the cheap and satisfying meal of my late teens to early early 20s!  \n\nI've had Marufuku Ramen on my list since they opened and finally got to try them out last month.  Little did we know that the Fillmore Street Festival was going on, but after a few times of circling around we found a parking spot about two blocks up.  We entered the Plaza and saw the long line already, despite them opening up just about 7-10 minutes prior.  We put our name on the list and after about 5 minutes was able to ask someone how long the wait was, she told us maybe about 20 minutes or so.  We weren't hungry yet and nothing else tickled our fancy, so we waited.  We were seated about 30 minutes afterwards.  The space is fairly small, with mainly seating for two, and I only saw like two four seaters.  \n\nI already knew I was going to get the Paitan DX ramen ($14.99) if it was still available (menu states limited to 15 servings) and he got the Hakata Tonkatsu ($10.99).  I clearly specified no bean sprouts since they are raw and pregnant ladies are advised not to eat raw sprouts.  I totally think that the 15 maximum of the Hakata DX made during a lunch or dinner seating is a bunch of bologna, because I saw a lot of tables with it and again, I wasn't seated until about 40 minutes after opening.  So there was no way that 15 people didn't order it by the time I got seated in this small ish restaurant (by the time all were seated we were like 10 or 11 down the list).\n\nThe chicken leg on the sizzling platter was served within a few minutes of ordering.  And of course came on a bed of bean sprouts.  I can understand this though, since they premake the chicken to serve it out to the masses.  It smelled wonderful and I couldn't wait to indulge in it.  About 7 minutes later or so, our bowls of ramen came out.  Mine was filled with braised pork belly, a soft boiled egg (which I gave hubs), ginger slivers, kikurage mushrooms, green onions, corn, chicken cha su.  His was filled with green onions, a soft boiled egg, kikurage mushrooms, green onions and simmered pork belly.  Hakata style is rich and creamy broth and served with thinner noodles.  So people should definitely take that into consideration before dining here since I don't think that's fair that some slam Marufuku because of that.  \n\nLet's start with the chicken leg.  It was a huge hunk of moist seasoned meat.  Some of the flavors from the bean sprouts does infuse into the meat, so be forewarned.  Now on to my ramen, so I'm loving the rich paitan broth, the noodles and the doneness of the mushrooms.  The pork belly was super tender and flavorful too.  But then I'm getting more into my bowl and I see a crap load of bean sprouts despite the waitress repeating back our order to us, and stating no bean sprouts back to me.  This was very disappointing, again, because these are uncooked bean sprouts, and it's not like the broth is hot enough like shabu broth to cook the sprouts.  Not sure if she didn't write it down or the cooks just didn't pay attention or didn't care.  But I know that they wouldn't pre-make the bowls of ramen like they did for the chicken.  Since the noodles are thin too, the bean sprouts easily got intertwined with noodles, which made it difficult to take out all of the bean sprouts and put them aside.  I tried his broth as well, which was different (aside from being pork based) than other tonkatsu broths we've had; while not bad, it wasn't as strong as mine, and I preferred mine, which I think he did as well.  The eggs which he enjoyed were oozing out the runny yolk when eaten, even though he ate it towards the end.  The ramen wasn't a total salt bomb either.  So all in all, I think it may just be the best ramen in the city, so I can see why people would wait for it.  They know how to do ramen right and are prepped to make as quick of a turn around as needed.  \n\nSo pluses - The ramen!  They give you a lot of items in your bowl too for the money.  $15 for the huge chicken leg side and a full bowl of ramen (with braised pork belly) is a good deal.  Nice decor, and it's clean.  You can choose your spicy level and at no extra charge.  \n\nMinuses - I guess they don't listen when you ask for what seems to be a simple modification, especially when you say you can't eat something.  What if I had been deathly allergic?  Also,  the wait!  I would definitely come back but not wait more than about 30 minutes to dine here.  I mean, Japantown has a ton of great other places too, so why would you want to wait an hour plus for a bowl of ramen?", "author": "Cat C."}

My friend and I shared the Hakata Tonkotsu and the Chicken Paitan Dx. Their broth is thick, but not too creamy and it is very very flavorful! You can really taste the sultriness of the broth! And their ramen is packed with toppings that you would usually get as extras at another ramen place. I highly suggest coming early so you can try the Dx version (they only have 15 for every dinner service) because they give you a whole chicken piece in addition to the protein you already have in your ramen. And don't even get me started about their egg! The egg is also perfectly cooked. The only thing that i was indifferent towards was their noodles. The noodles are good, but wish they were thicker and had more substance to it. \n\nLike many hot restaurants in SF especially restaurants in Japantown, there is always a line here, but it is definitely worth it. The servers are also really down to earth and don't rush you like other places.

It's in the second floor in the same area as Konikuya bookstore (sorry I can't spell at the moment). If you have to eat here, you'll need to learn how to endure a heavy long wait. First come, first serve. It took about 1-2 hours to finally get seated especially on a weekend and due to its rising popularity. If you get early enough, maybe the wait can be shorter. So what happens is you sign your name on the name list for the worker to call out your name and your number of party. If you miss out, the worker will put an astrik star next to your name on the list and be sure to see them if you see that star, so you can still get your spot and they will still take you in. If you don't like waiting hours straight for a spot, you can feel free to shop around nearby to kill time before it's your turn to get an eating spot at the restaurant. Luckily, they have a menu outside on the clear door for customers to look at while waiting or deciding to eat there. It already helped me decide what to order in an instant. Finally, they seated me in. Inside was quite beautiful. Like an modern Japanese style. It's so cute! I'm screaming with joy and happy hunger! :D \n\nFor the food I ordered, I ordered the Hakata DX Ramen. You have the choice for any of the ramens about how spicy you want for your ramen. No mild, mild, med spicy, really spicy, etc. I went with mild. I also ordered the Calpico as my drink. It was quite tasty. It didn't take them too long to get the ramen out. Which is good, because boy, am I sooo hungry! It was beautifully presented with a seaweed sticking out of the ramen. One bite and you will be sent to ramen heaven. This was pure bliss. The braised pork belly was super delicious that I couldn't stop nibbling on it. Soft, full of flavor, and done nicely. It was the star of the dish. Besides that, everything else seem to go along very well. The broth was really good as well. It even got me sipping on it haha. Omg. It was one of the best ramens I tasted in SF. It was totally worth the long wait!!!", "author": "Lynh N."}

My husband's chicken ramen was good but flavor was not as rich compared to the pork. He got a huge side of chicken leg (thigh and drumstick) which came on a sizzling pan on top of bean sprouts.

Maybe you've encountered better experience or maybe it's because I've been waiting in line my whole life for anything nowadays...Regardless, it was a positive experience.\n\nEven BEFORE you get to the restaurant, you can wait-list yourself on Yelp and know how many parties are ahead of you. When it's closer to your turn, they'll give you a call to let you know your table is ready; that way, you can just come in and not waste the whole day waiting. \n\nNow....to the food part. I think their thin noodles really reminds me of Ippudo and I loved it. Nevertheless, I think their broth was way too salty for my taste! Darn! When I first took a sip of the broth and noodles, it was soooo amazing only to find myself already drinking a whole cup of water after a few bites. Not only that, it gets really intense as you keep on eating and I never can really finish my bowl because it was just too salty. I ordered the Hakata Tonkatsu both times I was here. The one piece Tonkatsu they give is quite small and the egg that was in it became overcooked since it was buried all the way on the bottom so technically you're just eating a hard boiled egg. I'm not sure if that was the purpose or if they are trying to go for the runny egg experience because the yolks were not that runny. I also got a Chashu Bowl, which in my opinion is OKAY.

Really wanted to try this paiton DX but was disappointed.\nFirstly, great service and atmosphere in an attractive ramen shop. Food arrived very quickly and was piping hot. Awesome so far!\nTore into that beautiful roasted chicken and bam. There was a very familiar funky flavor that takes me back to those Chinese bbq flavors from the typical buffet bar. Wow, so disappointed. Nicely roasted chicken yet? A simple salt and pepper roasted chicken would have been much tastier. Moving on to the Chicken paiton ramen. Never had it before and it was definitely different. Very beautiful bowl of ramen for sure. Well done. My only gripes were at medium spice, it was hot. Not hot enough to make the top of my head sweat but hot enough to make me have to suck down water several times to put out the heat. Again the service just kept filling that water glass. Awesome! The sliced chicken was not very good either. Cool and dry when it arrived so I buried it into the hot broth for help. Noodles were delicious and plentiful.\nTo conclude, I cannot recommend this ramen if one has to stand in a line that reaches the other side of the mall.

The noodles had the perfect amount of bite. Not too chewy and not too soft. Just right. The noodles reminded me of the egg noodles in Wonton Soup. The rich, creamy both married all the ingredients in the bowl together in complete harmony. The broth also helped cut the intense flavor of the pork belly. This was a delicious bowl of ramen. \n\nTakoyaki: I felt that there could have been more octopus pieces in this delectable appetizer. I prefer the outer layer to be a bit more crispy. Still a tasty treat.\n\nService: Good friendly service. Food arrived in a timely manner, although the grilled chicken which comes with the Chicken Paitan DX came before the appetizers and the ramen.", "author": "D V."}

The place opens at 11:30 and we got there at 11 which was good because by 11:30 there was a line all the way to the other side of the building. We were the third party in line, seated promptly and immediately served water and asked if we knew what we wanted to order. Being our first time here, we didn't know what we wanted to order. However, by the time they say the party next to us, we ordered. We both got the Hakata Tonkatsu, my boyfriend got the spicy and I got the medium with added corn. We also got the Chicken Karaage appetizer. By the time we ordered, they had seated every table in the restaurant in less than 10 minutes. The chicken karaage came out in minutes... the service is super fast. It was good but the pieces were really big. I rather have more little pieces than less big pieces. Also there was barely any mayo for dressing. The ramen came out a few minutes later and it was very delicious. The broth was very flavorful but not very spicy so I added a little more chili powder. The powder didn't change the flavor of the broth, but added a back of your throat spicy kick. The noodles are skinny noodles, which I don't really like.. I prefer fat noodles but it was still delicious. They give you a whole egg, though I wish my egg could have been more soft boiled and runny. But the meat- oh my god- the simmered pork belly was delicious!!! The meat was super soft and and tore apart easily. It literally melted in my mouth and was super delicious. Would come back just for the pork belly. They placed our check on our table before we were done. They were really cranking people out of there!

The first Time I went there, I was with an elder Black woman with a walker. I let them know that I wasn't sure if she would be able to stand for very long, as the wait at that point was 30 minutes. They found her a chair she could sit in while we waited, and then worked some magic so that our wait only ended up being about five minutes, before they were able to put us at a table with enough space around it to accommodate her walker staying with her. I will always have a warm place in my heart for the staff for treating us with the respect that I would wish every restaurant would have for an elder, especially a disabled elder. \n\nBeyond that, the food is just incredible. The menu is simple and I have been ecstatic about my meal every time. I have dined in 3 times and ordered takeout twice. \n\nThe only changes I would like to see are that they include a vegetarian option so I could bring my veg friends, and that they would use gluten-free tamari instead of traditional soy sauce. My partner and I are both GF and so we replace the noodles with rice and seem to do ok with the regular soy sauce but I know this is not necessarily true for people who are more sensitive than we are.\n\nStill, if I could give this place more than five stars, I would.", "author": "Amanda C."}

With everyone out traveling about, the waits at popular brunch/lunch spots halves, if not more! So, cue the recent Memorial Day weekend: showed up with a friend around 1pm and waited 15-20 minutes. Amazing.\n\nAs for the food itself? Like many other ramen joints, they offer an assortment of appetizers and rice bowls, as well as the obvious ramen itself, for which they offer both tonkotsu and toripaitan, in regular and DX (deluxe?) versions, that have more meaty options. The noodles themselves are hakata style thin noodles, so eater beware if that's not your jam.\n\nTheir tonkotsu broth is fantastic and definitely worth getting, while their toripaitan is much richer and more flavorful than Nojo's and Hinodeya's, but not as much as Mensho's (which is still my personal favorite in this category), so take that as you will when ordering. The DX version of the toripaitan, limited to 15 servings a day, comes with a side of grilled chicken thigh: almost like a Japanese take on the five spice chicken pho ga that some Vietnamese places do.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A decently sized venue with a variety of seating, including both accessible pull-out seating, and less accessible bench seating.

I came here around 12 on a Saturday and there was a wait - to be expected for any good restaurants nowadays.  The good news is that the wait actually isn't that long.  The lines moves because the food comes out fast and waitresses are very efficient in clearing out tables.  There are benches right outside the restaurant and plus, a Japanese bookstore nearby to kill time while you wait.  We waited for about 20-25 minutes for a table of 3, smack in the middle of weekend lunch rush. Not bad! \n\nWe both ordered the Hakata and the Hakata DX version (more expensive) to understand what's the difference.  The 2 bowls are almost identical except that the DX has 2-3 chunks of braised pork belly, in addition to the sliced pork belly.  The braised pork belly chunks are super tender!  They literally melt in your mouth.  I would highly recommend it.  Their soup broth is serious business!!!  It's one of the best I've tasted -even better than Dojo Ramen in San Mateo, in my opinion.  The soft egg was done to perfection.  Their noodles are the thin, not the springy kind you normally see.  I prefer the springy kind personally but the thin noodles tasted great nonetheless.  \n\nBefore we ordered, we saw other tables with their bowls coming out - and the bowls look small. So we ordered the Chicken karage as appetizer.  The Chicken karage was served with a spicy mayo dip and was also done very well.  We let the small bowls fooled us in terms of size.  The bowls may look small but they really give you a lot of noodles and ingredients and the bowl filled me up!

Both soup base are actually not oily to us, which I was pretty surprised. \n\nThere are two slices of meat on top of the soup, they are perfect tenderness for both the chicken ramen and DX pork ramen. \n\nThe whole boiled egg was hidden under the ramen. They cooked perfectly so the egg yolk stay liquid but the egg white was fully cooked and marinated fully with the soup base. \n\nThe thin noodle is our favorite! Originally the thin noodle ramen comes from Tokyo for serving quick lunch ramen to business man. The noodle created to be thinner to give easy digest for business man rushes to eat their meal. The thin noodle actually taste much more sophisticated to me compare to the thicker noodle,  because it's harder to control the thin noodle hardness when cooking and this place won't let you down!\n\nThe portion of the ramen was just right. We didn't waste any part of it. The whole egg definitely adds the fullness. \n\nThe waiting time was 30 minutes. We went on Friday night at 8:50pm right before their closing time.

Service was great, they took our orders quickly and our food came out quickly. I ordered an edamame for $4 and a Hakata Tonkotsu no spicy for $11.99. My friends ordered mild and medium Hakata Tonkotsu. Edamame not worth $4 in my opinion. The portion size for Hakata Tonkotsu was good (I wasn't too full or still hungry after the edamame and ramen). They add ginger in the ramen which I've personally never had. I didn't like it but I could probably ask them to make the ramen without ginger if I come again. My friends said the mild and medium Hakata Tonkotsu was not spicy, so if you're looking for spicy ramen, maybe go for spicy or ultra spicy?

For the price and easy accessibility, it was great! \n\nThe green onions, the broth, the ramen noodles, and mushrooms were all on point. And don't forget a large soft-boiled egg buried deep- probably hidden beneath the noodles! There was a decent amount of pork belly. Also, I have a thing about TOO much pork fat but it was actually the perfect amount for me. The chicken karaage rice bowl was also a nice appetizer, but you honestly don't need it because you will be stuffed by the seemingly small, but rather filling bowl of ramen! \n\nlocation: since it's in the middle of the Japantown plaza, parking is either metered or the nearby parking structure.

My friends had gotten there earlier than me, so they added themselves to the queue (started out as #25). They had a nice system through the Yelp app. It allowed us to check our places in line. \n\nWe got our table a little over an hour later. We almost got seated in the traditonal-looking middle area with the light up seats, but we had three people, so we weren't able to sit there, so we sat at a regular table to the side. Restaurant was bright, clean and modern. \n\nService was good and efficient. They're pretty quick about serving and refillling water whenever we were low. And our food came out pretty quickly. \n\nDecided to go with the Hakata Tonkatsu and the Hakata DX, as well as a side of Chicken Karage. Went with mild, although I didn't really taste any spiciness. So, I would probably go up another spice level if I were to come back. The ramen broth here was meatier, and the chashu sweeter than other ramen places I've had. I liked that the noodles were nice and thin with the right amount of firmness for thin noodles. The soft boiled egg was nice, better than Ippudo in Berkeley which literally gave me a regular boiled egg, that I had to get as an add-on too! But, it couldn't beat the smoky soft boiled egg at Waraku, the ramen place outside the Japantown mall area. The ramen also came with a good amount of bean sprouts! The Hakata DX came with corn, seaweed, and braised pork, on top of what was already in the Tokatsu. The braised pork was really tender. Seaweed was nice and crisp. Corn wasn't sweet enough, maybe because they're no longer in season. The chicken karage was surprisingly good. I was expecting the typical chicken karage, but the flavour was different in a good way. It was lighter, and went really well with the mayo dip that came with it. The chicken was tender. \n\nGood overall, but maybe I'm not a huge fan of the Hakata styled ramen. It's not my favorite ramen place in the bay area, especially with the wait.", "author": "Christine L."}

I ordered the pork broth tonkatsu - spicy level. The broth is made of the most rich & flavorful Wonders that the world of noodles has to offer. The pork meat melts in your mouth, as it should. The noodle is on the thin side but I didn't even care because the rest of the Ramen was so good. The bowl only comes in one size @ $11.99 but it's one of those deep Bowls so it's not too bad; enough for one person. \nWe came about half an hour before they opened & the line was already forming. I would suggest come 45 minutes to an hour before the restaurant opens to line-up to make sure that you get in with the first group that is served. We were literally the first of the second group but Fortunately, the wait wasn't too long - about 20 min wait. Also, the ramen came up pretty quick too so that was definitely a bonus. \nThe inside is definitely small & cramped, so do not come with a very big party unless you don't mind getting split up. I think the max table that I saw held about four to six people. Service was good & they did their job; nothing to complain about there. \nOverall, I would definitely recommend if you like Ramen or looking to try Ramen for the first time.

After waiting nearly an hour for a table I expected a good bowl of ramen, especially since this place has stellar reviews. But what I got (the hakata tonkotsu) was wonton noodles with some ramen ingredients. The noodles were thin, the type used in Chinese wonton noodle soup. There was no real texture or chewiness to the ramen. I can't even tell if it's al dente which is what I look for in ramen due to the thin noodles. The ramen had no seaweed but had some ginger slices on it, blah! I removed them. And my \"soft-boiled egg\" was a hard-boiled egg. It was an entire egg which is great, but the inside was nearly fully cooked and had no runniness at all.  The good things about the ramen was the rich tasty broth and nice thin slices of braised pork belly. And the portion was pretty filling due to the full-sized egg.\n\nOverall, edible but not memorable.\n\nOh, and we ran out of water and they never came by to refill it.\n\nTo top it off, the suggested tips on the receipt is deceptive.

I've tried the HAKATA TONKOTSU which comes with simmered pork belly, soft boiled egg, green onion, kikurage mushroom and bean sprouts. for $4 more you can get BRAISED pork belly (that's really the only difference). The hakata is delicious, the bowl is a modest portion but don't be fooled it's very filling. The pork belly is tender and has great flavor, the noodles were the perfect chewy texture. I have also tried the CHICKEN KARAAGE which I thought was pretty good, but not the best karaage I've ever had.

This one, she said, had upwards to a two hour wait but because it's in a mall you could line up indoors instead of out on the street like several other hyped ramen joints.\n\nI decided to give it a shot and went there for dinner tonight. Arriving around 4:25 and seeing no line, I made the mistake of ducking into the bookstore next door for a bit. When I came out around 4:35, the line was already down to the other end of the building. There must have been at least 50 people ahead of me. Instead of getting seated in the first wave, I had to wait until the second and ended up waiting a total of about an hour.\n\nThe wait was very definitely worth it. I managed to get one of the 15 Chicken Paitan Deluxe they serve per day. The combination of the grilled chicken in that sweet sauce and the ramen in that broth with just the right weight managed to hit every single comfort food desire that I had. It felt like eating an entire church potluck at the same time, but without any of the guilt.\n\nAnd a side note: I very much appreciate the pace of the experience. I am in the shove ramen in your face as quickly as possible school of ramen eating, which I suppose many people, especially those with children, aren't. This place has that. Everything's quick but without rush, and the servers move with polite urgency. It is not a place to hang out and chat forever, and some people probably won't like that but to me it's what a ramen shop should be.\n\nI have to admit that I was very skeptical at first, but it was worth the wait. Of course, I only had a one hour wait and more than half of it was spent inside the tea store and stationary store next door. If I had to stand in line for over an hour?

We came before the rush and was seated in about 5 minutes at 6:30pm. For a starter, we tried the Geso Fry ($6.50) per recommendation by the server. The geso fry (fried squid legs) were crunchy and chewy. It went great with the mayonnaise, but they definitely could've provided a lot more for dipping; it was literally just a squeeze.\n\nFor my ramen, I opted for the Chicken Paitan DX (I realized DX meant Deluxe) ($14.99). If you're going for deluxe, get the chicken one. Otherwise, I'd probably go for the Hakata Tonkotsu next time because it didn't seem as worth to get the deluxe for the tonkotsu, which my friend ordered. They only serve 15 servings of the Chicken Paitan DX, so be sure to get there early enough for it! This order came with the ramen along with a huge piece of chicken leg cooked in soy sauce on a bed of beansprouts. The chicken was flavorful and plentiful, so definitely made this meal worth it. As for the ramen, my favorite part was the option to make the ramen as spicy as you wanted from none, mild, medium, spicy, and even ultra spicy! Another thing I loved about their ramen here is the soft-boiled egg that they have hidden inside the bowl. Mine came out perfectly and I always love a perfect soft-boiled egg.\n\nHere's a new yummy ramen spot in town. Everything came out quickly and tasted great with a simple menu.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

It was in the afternoon around 3-4pm and the wait was about 30 minutes for a table of 4. You put your phone number down so you can walk around instead of standing there and waiting for your name to be called which is super efficient! \n\nIt was a special menu with just ramen selections due to the cherry blossom festival so I ordered the hakata tonkotsu. My bf wasn't that hungry because we bought some snacks at the cherry blossom festival and we saw this grilled chicken plate on yelp so he asked for that. It was $6.50 which is pretty worth it I'd say. The chicken was pretty flavorful and it's pretty cool that it comes out on a sizzling plate. My friends ordered the hakata dx (which I learned stands for deluxe). I'm not sure if there is a huge difference in the two, but my friends thought their broth was in between OK-pretty good. I added corn in mines and it really made a great difference! The overall hakata tonkotsu broth is pretty good but not superr amazing. The noodles texture is thin and a little different from other ramen places. I would like to come back and try the chicken paitan next time. You don't usually see chicken ramen on the menu at other places.\n\nThe service was pretty good as well. Even during the cherry blossom festival, we were greeted promptly at our table and were asked what we wanted to drink right away.

Came here on a Sunday night after seeing this place just opened and got great reviews. As usual, there was a wait, but because it's ramen, the line went by quickly.\n\nThe menu isn't that diverse, but that's okay. All you need is great broth, noodles, and toppings! I got the regular hakata tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend got the DX (deluxe) version. We were really really surprised by the broth - it's one of the best broths we've had in SF. It's creamy, rich, and so flavorful. Noodles are very very thin (which I happen to like), but I will say that it was slightly stuck to each other so it was hard to eat. \n\nThe difference between the regular and deluxe version is just the toppings and meat. The DX has braised pork in addition to simmered pork (chashu), corn, and seaweed. Everything else is the same as the regular tonkatsu version. The waitress told us something different and we thought the deluxe version had all the toppings they listed as additional (on the right side of the menu)...which would make sense as it's labeled \"deluxe\". So heads up - if you want all the toppings that they have, you'll have to pay. But good news - they give you a lot. I ordered extra bamboo shoots and they gave me a full little plate. \n\nWe also had the karrage appetizer and it was...okay. I wouldn't recommend this. Just come here for the ramen.

But, it's got a deep, wideness at the bottom so portion was plentiful!  Got the Pork deluxe ramen.  I found the mild level of spice to be spicier than I anticipated.  I'll be going for non-spicy next time.  Broth with corn, noodle, sprouts and corn were deeply satisfying.  I preferred the chasu to the braised pork.  Braised pork was.... a little dryer?  tougher? than I would have wanted braised pork to be.  It was not bad, just not as delicious as the Chasu.  Next time, I'll get the regular pork ramen and add corn to it :).\n\nThe Chicken karaage was ok.  Felt like there was too much powdery breading on it.

Considering the fact that there isn't a lot of good ramen places in the city, this place is one of the better ones. To me the broth tasted similar to Santouka's but maybe a little less rich. Their noodles come in thin strands which I'm not a big fan of but it was still okay. Pork belly was flavorful unlike some ramen places where the pork belly isn't seasoned. Its also really tender so it kind of melts in your mouth. The percentage of fat to meat is probably 60:40 so if you're not a big fan of pork fat you wouldn't be thrilled. The mild has a little kick to it so if you're not a big fan of spicy food get the non-spicy (and if you need to you could always add chili pepper later on) \n\nI would definitely come back here for a ramen fix but I would not wait in line for more than an hour for this. \n\nP.S.

This may change after our upcoming trip to Japan, but I'll come back and edit.) I was in the area hunting for a Mother's Day gift when I decided to give in to my (fairly frequent) craving for ramen. A quick check of Yelp told me that I happened to be near one of the most popular ramen joints in the city, so I headed into the Japan Center. After wandering in circles and getting sidetracked looking at adorable sets for serving sake, I had to ask a UPS guy where it is inside (pro tip: UPS guys know where everything is at.) It was just before noon on a Wednesday so they'd been open for less than 30 minutes, but there was quite a crowd gathered outside. I added my name to the electronic waitlist, a painless process, and then spent half an hour trying not to buy everything at K-Pop Asian beauty store. I finally got my text and zoomed over! \n\nThe whole experience took less time than the wait itself. The instant I sat down a server asked for my order. I picked the Hakata Tonkotsu, spicy, after debating whether I wanted to spend $4 more for the deluxe version (corn + braised instead of simmered pork belly). I experienced instant FOMO for not going for the deluxe as soon as she walked away, but my worry was needless. The ramen that came out literally sixty seconds later was excellent.  Very balanced broth, nice and creamy with a little kick but not so spicy that I couldn't taste all the flavors. The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth. I couldn't find the egg at first (I know, right? That's how full the bowl was) so by the time I cut into it it was pretty fully cooked. My bad. I still had about 1/4 of my food left when the check appeared at my table, and it was back with my card in like another minute. It's a little disorienting to be so hurried but I guess it's better for everyone else who wants to get in here! I will return to try the other ramen offerings. \n\nPS: The cucumber water was a really nice touch. It was like being at a ramen spa.", "author": "Hannah M."}

The restaurant sports a very modern look and feel with some sort of classy coolness to it. The service is very friendly here as well.\n\nBeing that I ate here during the cherry blossom festival when they need a quick turnaround to keep up with business, their menu was shortened to not include appetizers and the food came out extremely quickly. I decided to get their Hakata Tonkatsu Ramen with an added side order of kakuni (braised pork belly) to get the best of both worlds. I ordered it on a medium spicy level which I personally would consider a mild so if you like spicy, I'd recommend going for their spicy or ultra spicy levels. The noodles in the ramen are very thin yet resilient as is characteristic of Hakata style ramen. They weren't bad, but I didn't find them to be a highlight of the dish as they were a bit too hard for my liking. However, the broth and meat were straight up amazing!\n\nThe broth is sooooooo rich! It is bursting in umami flavors and creaminess. The pork based broth is seeming with collagen which is essential for a good broth. I didn't let any broth go to waste. Even more outstanding than the broth was the meat. The chashu and kakuni were like a dream. The braised pork belly came in nice large chunk with a good amount of meat and fattiness. The meat part of the pork belly was surprisingly firm yet tender, making it easy to bite through for a perfect texture. The chashu really took me for a surprise though. I typically don't expect the chashu in a ramen to be outstanding, but this one really was a notch above the rest. It had a good amount of fattiness to it and the meat simply melted in the mouth. I don't usually find pork to have this sort of quality, and this chashu is the thing that will bring me back for sure!", "author": "Joshua M."}

Fortunately, it seemed that most of those ahead of us had already left due to being so discouraged in regards to how long the wait was so we got seated quicker than anticipated. Once I saw the menu, I ordered a Hakata DX which is essentially the maxed out version & added a couple fixings to my liking. Now, as to how the food ended up being? Quite bomb. The ramen itself was pretty darn good. Great broth that was spicy the way I like it & I was indeed surprised that the spicy here was actually quite legitimately spicy (impressed). The simmered pork was most interesting and having it the first time, I was surprised how sweet it came out to be in taste in mouth. Though it was good, I still prefer the braised pork belly pieces over the simmered pork. Noodles were great consistency & went nicely with the broth & other fixings as included & added.

The sizzling chicken plate came out first, and the flavor was great with the skin but the meat itself was a tad dry.

They quickly came by to put a napkin on it but that's all.\n\nI tried the chicken paitan soup first since it was new to me, and I enjoyed the rich chicken-flavored ramen broth. However, the rest of the bowl was a disappointment. The noodles were overcooked - definitely not chewy as ramen noodles should be; they reminded me of Cantonese egg noodles in something like wonton noodle soup. The chicken in the ramen tasted very similar to the chicken on the sizzling plate - sweet and dry. After a while everything just tasted sweet. My mom's hakata ramen was the same way - good soup but everything else was meh. It could be because of the corn added in the DX. \n\nAfter we finished, it took them a while to get us the check and even longer to process my card.

By the time I arrived, I only had to wait about 20 more minutes. When you go alone and depending on availability, you may end up being seated with a stranger who is also eating alone. It did not change my experience at all. The broth was creamy and delicious. The pork was so deliciously seasoned. I was, however, not a fan of the whole egg business. I'm used to the egg being cut in half. It made it much harder to eat. The karrage/fried chicken came with a great dipping sauce, but the chicken wasn't crispy enough.", "author": "Kim X."}

I signed on the kiosk and was able to check how many people were ahead of me and I received a text when my table was ready. I love that concept. The extra time I had to wait I spent lingering around the shopping center. There are a lot of cute shops that you can browse while waiting. \n\nAfter waiting about 20 minutes on a Friday at around 12 noon, I was seated. I already knew what I wanted so I ordered right away. I get the Hakkata ultra spicy. It was perfect! I love the thin noodles and velvety broth which was not too thick or salty. They give you a whole egg with a slightly runny enter that was so creamy and soft. The slices of pork were thin sliced and not overwhelming. I am not into meats so the serving size was just right. If you want more meat I would say to get the DX. Although I ordered the spiciest option, it was not spicy at all. I do however have a high tolerance for spice so it varies for everyone. \n\nAll in all, I would definitely comeback. This ramen joint reminds me of Ippudo in New York. Yummy!

The service was fast and friendly, and the food really good.  I ordered the Chicken Karaage to start and was happy with the fried chicken bits (not too greasy with good flavor, and very large portion).  \n\nA few minutes later the Hakata Tonkatsu ramen arrived.  Served in handmade ceramic bowls, it was served hot and was very flavorful.  The noodles had a great consistency, and the broth not too salty or fatty, but had a rich flavor.  Honestly, I must say it took me by surprise.  The presentation was great, but the first bite left me slightly underwhelmed.  The turnaround was in each successive bite.  There were so many different flavors in the bowl... the charsu pork and the porkbelly, the corn and the seaweed, the perfectly cooked egg.  Each bite was a little different.  \n\nI might order this with extra noodles next time as they were quite good.

Therefore, a friend and I came to try it out last night. We both ordered their basic tonkatsu ramen (I forgot the name they call it) and both of us enjoyed it very much. We both ordered the spicy soup level (there was also a very spicy option but we decided not to be that brace). The soup was very tasty and the pork slices were very good as well. The noodle is of the very thin variety and was very good too (for those familiar with Yamadaya located nearby, the noodle to similar to theirs).\n\nWe also ordered a pitcher of Sapporo beer. Unfortunately the beer was flat, don't know if we got the end of their supply or what.\n\nAlso other things of note after we got the bill:\n\n1.  They do charge for the health tax.\n2.  Beware of following their 15 percent tip suggestion amount. We noted the number came out higher than it should have been, even if you were to base it on the after-tax total (which I normally don't). Our bill after the sales and health tax was around $52.70, and usually g the calculator 15% of that should have been just under $8. The bill showed the suggested amount at 15% to be $8.50.  It wasn't good for them to show a miscalculated amount like that, especially with it coming out on the high side. Hopefully it was just an error on their part and they fix it.\n\nItem number 2 above is the reason I can't give them five stars for now.

But then you look at the shopping directory and it's not listed. So you figure it's real Address is suite 235 so it is on second floor. Then it's on the back corner and if course there's already people waiting in line right as it opens.  Don't forget to sign your name in the sheet to queue up. Congratulations you made it. Because this place is so trendy I felt bad for the people  who had the window seat as they were in a fish bowl of people staring at them. Once seated, the food is served quickly and it goes without saying that the ramen is on point. Two bowls of ramen and a coke ran $30. Not a bad deal if you can stand the wait.", "author": "kelly m."}

We put our name down on the waitlist at around 6PM and got seated around 7:30PM on a Sunday night.\n\nI may be biased because I grew up in Japan so I've had my fair share of ramen, but it was WAY too salty for my taste (we had both the Chicken Paitan and Tonkotsu ramen, the chicken was much saltier but the Tonkotsu was still much saltier than average). Also some of the reviews mentioned that the broth is piping hot, which may be a good thing for some. For me personally, I eat quite slow (takes me about 15-20 mins to finish a bowl of ramen) and by the 10 minute mark the remaining noodles lost all of its texture, which is so crucial to the overall ramen experience.\n\nVerdict - forgo the line, not worth the wait.\n\nP.S. Service is actually not bad for how busy it is, but the host seem quite overwhelmed and the lady who spoke out names out spoke so quietly everyone had to huddle around her to listen to make sure their names were called.", "author": "Cheri R."}

The broth was rice and creamy and very flavorful.   I ordered mine medium spicy and it had the perfect kick.   Little bits of the occasional lemongrass really brightened up the dish as well and balanced out the umami.   The noodles were thin, but tasted fresh and had a good amount of chew to them.   The pork belly was perfectly cooked.   The egg was perfect.   I really have no complaints.\n\nWe got there right when they opened so we were seated right away.   Never saw a line of people forming, so I am guessing this is a bit of a hidden gem.   Prices are pretty good too....the basic tonkatsu was $10.95, which is pretty good by san francisco standards.\n\nRecommended.", "author": "Christian C."}

They've replaced an older ramen joint in the Japantown shopping center, and boy am I glad they're there.  Most places in the plaza are extremely lackluster, but not this place!\n\nNot only does the new trendy interior draw you in, but the food and service is what makes you take a seat and stay. \n\nNow, to be honest, when I came here with friends, we only had the appetizers and drinks, but those appetizers were damn good. \n\nThe Geso Fry (Squid Legs) and Chicken Karaage were nicely fried, with a enough crunch to keep me satisfied.  And that karaage was so moist on the inside.  Drool. The Buta Kakuni (Braised Pork Belly) was the real winner though.  Holy smokes, like my friend said to me, 'It's so buttery'.  Talk about amazing.  PLUS, we were able to try out the Paitan Chicken!  Which was actually the grilled chicken that they served with ramen, delicious. Washed it all down with Sapporo, Nigori and my new favorite, Sansho Ale and everything was golden.  Everyone, I truly recommend the Sansho Ale when eating here.  I truly do.  \n\nOr if you're adventurous.  Get the WASABI Beer.  Heh.\n\nCustomer service was great.  They were all so sweet and accommodating.  And they checked in on us often to make sure everything was good.\n\nI am definitely coming back because I need to try their Hakata Style ramen.  My favorite type of ramen!  It's so hard to find a place that serves them.  \n\nOh my god, the craving while writing this review is so real right now.  I wish I lived closer.", "author": "Michele C."}

The restaurant had a strange interior design. Aside from the regular tables on the sides, in the center, there is a rectangular frame with three tables inside. The frame is supposed to be the seats. We were very \"lucky\" and were seated at one of these three tables. It was very awkward to climb and crawl over the frame to get to our table. I was also wearing a skirt so you can imagine how ridiculous looking that was.... Also, the servers themselves had to climb over it to give you the food and clean the table, etc. Simply inconvenient for everyone.\n\nFor food, we ordered the Hakata Tonkatsu ($10.99), the Chicken Paitan ($10.99), Takoyaki ($6.50), and the Karaage Bowl ($3.50). We chose not to order the deluxe version since it is four dollars more just for braised pork belly. Instead we ordered a small rice bowl which is also around four dollars. I didn't really like the noodle for the ramen because it just reminded me of regular Chinese egg noodles that I eat at home. The soup wasn't very heavy which I liked. The most surprising thing to me was how each bowl of ramen had an entire soft-boiled egg and it was done perfectly.", "author": "Ida L."}

We ordered the Hakata Tonkatsu and the Hakata DX, which were pretty similar. The broth is boiled for over 20 hours so it's very flavorful and creamy and pork is very tender. Hiding under all the noodles is an egg which holds a creamy delicious golden center. Noodles aren't the typical ramen. They are similar to soba noodles, narrow and white; it was alright, but I prefer the traditional ramen noodles. The dish was surprisingly filling. If your have left over broth, bring it home and boil fresh ramen with it- it taste so good! Around $15 per bowl of ramen. Restaurant is pretty clean and modern compared to all the other restaurants in Japantown. Service was good and efficient. Glad to see a quality restaurant here.

They only have two types of ramen; their Hakata Tonkotsu or their chicken paitan, both in a regular and \"Dx\" size which is larger and comes with a hunk of meat. I prefer their chicken paitan over the tonkotsu; something about the chicken ramen here calms the soul with a ton of flavor. I'm usually more of a tonkotsu girl but the chicken hits the spot for sure. I get the regular size portions because for 11.99, your bowl comes with green onion, kikurage mushrooms, bean sprouts and a soft boiled egg which is already a TON of food for my stomach. You also get to choose which spice level you want from none-very spicy, but I usually prefer mild as they have chili flakes on the table to use at your leisure. This restaurant is also one of the only places I know that serve the white thin noodles versus the thick, yellow style noodle that is most commonly seen at restaurants. As for appetizers, I've tried their takoyaki and it is good! Some of my friends like getting their small rice bowls to get their stomach going for the main dish.\n\nI feel this is one of the must-try's ramen spots in SF since this place opened.

But by the time we left, there was a pretty long crowd of people waiting outside the entrance. \n\nI ordered the hakata tonkotsu and added corn. I ordered with mild spicy and my boyfriend got the same without corn but with medium spicy, but I think they mixed ours up because mine was spicier than his. Either way though it was super tasty, delicious broth, sweet corn, nice thin noodles, perfectly soft boiled egg. \n\nWe asked the waiter and apparently the difference between what we got and the dx version was that it had an extra type of pork and a few more toppings (corn and seaweed), but it's $4 more. \n\nWe also got the Japanese fried chicken with rice- a bit under seasoned chicken but juicy inside with a crunchy exterior, and nice sticky rice with some seaweed strips for flavor. Definitely great for the price of 3.50!\n\nAlso, the chicken dx ramen looks like it comes with a pretty heaping plate of sizzling chicken with crispy skin, which isn't obvious from the menu since it subtly says a side of grilled chicken. We saw some folks next to us get it so will definitely try it next time! Also saw another table with people who didn't seem to comprehend the chicken came with the ramen, so they actually turned it down after two waiters tried to explain it to them! I wanted to raise my hand and offer to have the dish but my bf stopped me...\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars was that their service was pretty slow. When we first got seated, we got menus, then a waiter took our orders and menus away. Then 5 minutes later a different waiter came and dropped menus on our table and thanked us for waiting! And we were like, no we already ordered! They also were kinda slow on water refills, and super slow on getting us our bill and then taking our credit cards. We had to flag the waiter down when he came close by for each of these tasks, my boyfriend felt like they were making it so hard for us to pay them!

We were so excited to try out this place since they have so many good reviews and there were a long line before us.\nAfter 30 minutes waiting, we finally got in. 1st impression: TOO HOT. The ceiling is already low enough and there is no ventilation whatsoever. The place is just extremely hot.\nWe've got the first option of the ramen with extra spicy option. The ramen was just meh. First of all, the soup was decent but lack in the boney, savory taste you got from cooking the bone in long enough (well that's what you guys claim but it just does not taste that way). Maybe the soup is just my jurisdiction, but here's the thing, the meat portion for the price I've paid was just disappointing. Only a FEW SUPER THIN slices. I mean I can literally see through the chashu, it was that thin. I feel like they gave my the trash part of the chashu when they cut it so I couldn't \"feel\" it at all. Egg was perfectly done so thumbs up on that.\nBut the place was just TOO HOT to enjoy our food. Not only it was crowded but the lack of ventilation killed our experience here at Marafuku.\nOverall, the food is not that special as well as the lack of ventilation in the restaurant will deny me from coming back in the near future.", "author": "Huy N."}

As far as I can tell, the line is completely unnecessary. But if so, then why are there stanchions in front of the restaurant that encourage people to line up?\n\nOK, that's a little weird. But whatever. Minor logistical quibbles do not a two-star review make.\n\nThe other main thing I don't understand is how the ramen is so mediocre. I'm afraid that accusation probably comes across as harsher than intended. I'm just ... genuinely baffled. It's clear that the folks at Marufuku care about the food they make; if the menu is to be believed, the chefs put a great deal of care and thought into their craft. Indeed, the place has all the accoutrements of a super-legit ramen place. In short, I don't think they're faking their enthusiasm or commitment. But the ramen simply does not deliver on the promise of the mass of people waiting outside.\n\nI'm not a great ramen connoisseur. Most of the ramen I've had in my life has been in San Francisco, and I've had it at five or six places here. Of those places, there are roughly three tiers of quality; Marufuku is in the third tier.\n\nOh, and my lunchmate claims there was mold on one of her salad tomatoes.

The food came out in minutes and the broth they used for  the ramen was rich in flavor. They didn't waste any ingredients either so one bowl is definitely enough to fill you up.  The texture of the noodles was soft and left me wanting more. The Karaage Bowl was good too, though you could easily find other Japanese spots that offer the same quality. \n\nThe setting was really cool. It was very much reminiscent of the higher end ramen shops I did go to in Japan. \n\n4/5 stars for the good food and clean, atmospheric setting.

As the name implies the main entree is ramen with different flavorings. We arrived on a Friday afternoon about 1 PM and there was a fairly long line.  We put our name on the list and were seated about 30 minutes later.  It is very clean and has limited seating.  Our servers were friendly and knew their product.  We both ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu ramen (medium spiciness) (@$11.99).  This consisted of Hakata style ramen with pork broth (simmered for hours) , simmered pork belly, soft boiled egg, green onions, kikurage mushroom and bean sprouts.  It was a bit too spicy for us and next time, we'll have the mild spice.  However, it was very flavorful and more than enough for the average person. We started off and shared a small \u200bMarufuku salad which had Mizuna green and assorted vegetables with a nice plum flavor dressing ($5).  Additionally we ordered the Takoyaki ($6.50) which is octopus made into a ball and battered.  It was a beautiful presentation.

The broth was rich in pork flavor and was very creamy. It was delicious.  The noodles were not what I expected. It was like eating noodle soup at a Chinese restaurant with the long stringy white noodles. I'm no ramen expert, but I expected long chewy curly noodles that I withhold the flavors of the soup. The meat was way too fatty but at least it was tender. Nothing I would rave too much about.

I waffled between 4 and 3 stars, but I think 4 is still fair for here.\n\nThey don't accept reservations though I believe you can put your name in the queue online. Come anytime near peak hours and expect to wait a long, long, time - it's not uncommon to have at least 30 other parties ahead of you at peak hours. Fortunately, it's right across from the bookstore, so you can browse while you wait.\n\nWe pretty much always get the standard Hakata Tonkotsu ramen, which has pork belly, soft-boiled egg, and bean sprouts. The broth is the standout here. It's very rich and satisfying.\n\nWe also frequently get the chicken kara-age bowl (fried chicken over rice) and occasionally get the takoyaki (saut\u00e9ed octopus balls) when we're hungry. Over the past few months, the kara-age quality in particular has plummeted. They're probably pre-frying and leaving the stuff under a heat lamp now.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-03", "description": "THE BEST RAMEN IN SF!!!! \n\nI have been to this ramen joint for more than my one hand can count so I feel inclined to write a review on how and why this place always has me coming back for more. \n\nFirst off, the line can be daunting to look at from afar so I advise y'all to come in at least 30 minutes before opening to avoid the line (it's so worth, trust me). Or you can wait an hour like I did on a Friday night.. Worth it though! They now have an online system so make sure you put your name down and your phone number. They will contact you as soon as your table is ready which is great b/c you don't have to physically wait in line and have a chance to check out Japantown. \n\nI normally get the chicken karaage as a starter. Honestly, it's nothing special, but the chicken is crunchy outside and so juicy inside and goes well with the japanese mayo. \n\nThe ramen here is amazing! I normally go for the safe route and do a tonkatsu ramen, medium spicy (which is amazing here!), but after I tried the chicken paitan, medium spicy... I swear my life took a 180. Although they only give you two pieces of chicken, the chicken is so moist and you can def taste the chicken in the broth. Plus, you came here for ramen right? Not chicken? The spice level was perfect. Not to the point where your taste buds are compromised from the spice, but to the point where you still get that slight spice kick and maybe a few sniffles here and there. The egg is located underneath all the goodness (don't trip like I once did thinking they forgot my egg) and make sure to fish it out to the surface before the yolk completely cooks. Anyways, the ramen here is thin and the broth is hearty. I swear you'll be seeing the bottom of your bowl in no time. It's a reasonable amount to fill up your stomach, but if you have a bigger appetite, don't fret, you can purchase extra noodles! \n\nPros:\n- food comes out super quick!\n- 10/10 on the flavor and creaminess of the broth\n- noodles are cooked perfectly. Not too soft and still has that crunch factor for texture lovers like me\n- ambiance was cute and intimate. Lighting was dim and perfect in noise level\n- parking isn't too hard to find. You might have to circle around Japantown for a bit if you want street parking, however there is a public parking lot nearby\n\nCon:\n- the line can get and will get ridiculously long if you don't show up before opening... \n- small space which contributes to the long wait. There are only about 15 or so tables. However, this is made up by their speedy customer service once you're seated!\n\nOverall, this ramen joint truly lives up to the hype!

We all ordered Hakata Dx, mild (some spice but not spicy at all), medium (some what spicy), and spicy (spicy with a hint of sweetness). The broth itself is very rich from the pork bone. But what set it apart from other broth is the nice blend melted pork belly fat, sesame oil, creamy potato (?), and spicy pepper. The noodles are straight and chewy. There was wood mushrooms, corn, seaweed, and soft-boiled egg in soy sauce in the Hakata Dx. They also gave us 2 big pieces of pork belly to eat with our ramen.

Sat down and ordered the hakata tonkotsu mild spicy and it was ready in just 5 minutes.  Guess because it's hakata noodle, thinner and quicker to cook.  The shop doesn't offer choice of firmness but the portion scale up.  Noodle was good and the soup was tasty.  Happy to see hakata noodle gains popularity in Bay Area, although I still miss the inaniwa noodle from now-closed Maki that was next door before. \n\nJust as usual, after ramen, felt very thirsty and drank a lot of water, tea and soda. Wish it could be less salty.", "author": "Ile F."}

I went to the Japanese market for my first time and saw multiple ramen spots and they all had lines but Marafuku had the best reviews so I waited for an hour to see what it was about. I ordered the tonktotsu with egg , seaweed cashew pork. The soup was really really good the broth was flavorful and the cashew pork was the best I've ever had. The noodles were a little thin for my taste but the ramen was over the top. In Vegas we have just as good if not better Ramen.

Chicken Paitan came with a side of big grilled chicken leg, we got this one medium. Spicy had a good flavor, but the condiments to soup ratio was too high in both ramen. I prefer my ramen with more soup than noodles and condiments in it.

Though disclaimer I've only been here once. They take your order as soon as you sit down and are very good about getting you water which is already a five star for me. The ramen was decent pricing, $12 for regular bowl and $16 for deluxe. The main difference for the deluxe was additional corn, more meat, and some other stuff. I would probably just go for the regular bowl next time. It does come with some brown looking ginger which I didn't like but that's just me (would probably tell them to not add next time). I would definitely recommend to get the \"spicy\" version because then the broth in my opinion taste too rich. The spiciness helps make you want to eat more without getting overloaded with the richness of the broth. Solid ramen, was full after eating it.", "author": "Johnny V."}

The noodles are freshly made in house and I think that's pretty rare for restaurants in the U.S. The noodles tasted great in that broth and the consistency was perfectly al dente. The soft boiled egg was food porn as expected. The chashu was the best I've ever had at a ramen place. It had that sweet, salty flavor to it and it was super tender! It just fell apart in your mouth. I definitely want to go back for more, and I'm super happy I got to try it! I got extra noodles and they literally give you another equal portion of noodles on the side for $2.

There was a good combination of fattiness and creaminess, and the soft boiled egg added a nice contrast to the flavor of the broth. For someone who thinks hot cheetos are spicy, I highly suggest getting your ramen at a medium spice level. The mild didn't provide enough kick to the flavor of the soup. My favorite part of the ramen was the super tender pork and the seaweed. Other than that, the hour wait is not worth waiting for in my humble opinion.

We decided to just sit on the bench and wait. We ended up waiting for 30 mins only! Wait wasn't bad at all!! While we were waiting we checked out their menu and knew exactly what we wanted. We ordered right away and the noodle came out in 5-10 min. I got the hakata tonkatsu (mild) and my boyfriend got the hakata DX with no spice. The DX was pricier because it have more ingredients.

From the whole egg to the pork belly to the noodles to the soup every aspect of the Hakata DX was perfect.  Most ramen places serve you only half an egg, but in every ramen served here you get a perfectly cooked egg that pairs up to their soft tender cuts of pork belly. With it you will be served thin homemade chewy noodles submerged in a umami broth that is rich and bold. I couldn't resist drinking almost all of the broth. I would recommend an extra order of noodles with it if you come in with an appetite like I did. The levels of spiciness is accurate where spicy had just the right kick to it so I could taste the flavor of the broth and not just plain fire in my mouth.  I also got the takoyaki which is a must.

The ramen portion was very small and the broth was average. Inside the ramen bowl lies 2 pieces of thinly sliced chicken breast meat (honestly it just looks like a very sad bowl). The marinated sizzling chicken leg/thigh was very sweet and salty and nothing really special (can be easily made at home with shoyu and sugar). Overall, my feeling of the restaurant was neutral for the food did not leave a strong impression on me. One thing that made me  leave the shop with a little disappointment was that the waiter gave me my bill in the middle of my meal (it feels like they are trying to indirectly ask me to hurry up in finishing my food). Overall, I would not recommend. But if this is just one of the restaurants/ramen places that's on your list (like in my case), it's probably still worth a visit just for the sake of checking it off on your list.", "author": "Joseph C."}

My boyfriend ordered the exact same thing as me. The food came out pretty fast and the broth was bomb. The only thing I did not like about my ramen was the noodles were thin and straight.

The only difference we noticed was a single small piece of braised pork in the DX alongside the simmered pork. (The regular only has simmered pork. It's also not supposed to have corn, but I think it had some?) Everything was delicious, but I couldn't understand how one little piece of pork and some corn justifies a 36% price difference. If I had to justify it, I guess the braised pork takes more ingredient and time to make, but the size/quantity really throws you off. Of course, I could just be an amateur revealing the size of my wallet among a sea of SF foodies.\n\nThe broths were not too salty, but rich and creamy. The egg was pretty good with a soft yolk. I liked the uniquely Hakata style thin noodles. The DX's braised pork was tender and flavorful, while the simmered pork was kind of typical (thin, pallid). Overall, tasty.\n\nKaraage was good. I believe karaage is supposed to have a rather light coating, but I would've liked a little more crisp on this one.\n\nTakoyaki was super soft and tasted good, but each ball only had one small piece of octopus inside.

Might even changed names not sure because j never remember the name but I do remember that it's in Japan town mall in the corner upstairs lol.\n\nFOOD:First off, I've never had a bad experience with the taste here. Everything has always been delicious. The funny part is when the bowl comes out, you're sitting there thinking.. that's it? But I will assure it that the bowl is definitely enough. It is small in diameter but deep and filled with goodies. I hate when I go to a ramen shops and you have to add all the extra, which here, for the most part you do not. Though if you do feel the need, the extras are very well priced. The meat is always so flavorful and tender, almost melt in your mouth. That is always a deal breaker for me and they have never disappointed\n\nSERVICE: I enjoy the service here. Servers are quick and food comes out asap. The only part I ever have problems with is having my bowl removed before I am done with it. I am the type of person to eat the food and drink the soup. Some of the servers will ask if you are done but there are a select few who will just take your bowl if your taking a break but look to be done. Almost gave 4 stars because of the but I just love the food.\n\nPLACE: This place is very well kept. Like I said before they update the restaurant and it is a great atmosphere. You can see a range of business people to high school kids.\n\nTIP: just like most really good ramen shops, this place is slightly small so expect a wait. Like really expect a wait. The greatest part is if they say about 30 + minutes you can always go and walk around the shopping mall and buy a couple things. It is worth the wait though so walk. Also If they call your name and you do not instantly appear they will put a check or star next to it. This is to show that you have been passed but are still on the list so when the next available table frees up they will sit you down. \n\nIf you have not already tried the place out, I recommend you should.", "author": "Jackie B."}

So, she called 3 more parties and when they didn't show, she allowed us in. They prioritize 4 seat tables for bigger parties and will push the parties of 2 like us back even though we waited longer.

We ordered the karaage rice bowl, braised pork rice bowl, hakata DX ramen, chicken paitan DX ramen, and takoyaki. We were the first to order so we were surprised when a table was delivered takoyaki before us. The waitress realized that she had given it to the wrong table. This happened again with the chicken ramen. The mixup is understandable I guess, it was really busy.\n\nThe food was delicious. I'm not crazy about ramen so I wouldn't rave about it, it was good. I would definitely come back for the rice bowls; really filling for a really low price. \n\nOh yeah, my little sister FOUND A WIRE IN HER RAMEN. One of those wires they use to wrap up bags of bread. Yeah, shocked, we asked where she found it and she replied with, \"In my mouth.\" We called a waitress right away and she was very apologetic and offered to replace the ramen. We were already so full so we declined the offer. They removed it from the bill.\n\nSo why the four stars after that experience? The delicious food and kind staff.

The excess corn also may have made the soup a bit too sweet.

It was creamier and the pork flavor was on point.  I like how I could taste the ginger when making the broth.  It definitely lightens the pork flavor.  Noodles: the noodles were nice and thin.  It works well with the broth where it doesn't soak up too much pork flavor and we can taste the freshness of the noodle.  Pork: I like the variety of the pork belly.  I had charshu pork belly and regular pork belly (not soaked in soy sauce marinade).  I really like the regular one.  It was soft and not too salty.  I think the charshu pork belly was cooked a little too long.\nToppings: the topping were great.  I felt as though they added to the dish.\n\nI highly recommend the takoyaki!  It is sweet, savory and has the right amount of salty.  On top of that I also like the bonito flakes.  MUST ORDER!\n\nOther sides I have tried: rice bowl (don't remember the name, but it had cod roe and seaweed) and fried ika.  These dishes were pretty good too.  They aren't that different from other places.\n\nService was great and quick, but I felt that they could have asked if I wanted dessert.  Who doesn't want dessert after a good meal?

Both my girlfriend and I got the Hakata Tonkotsu. At $10.99 I thought it was very worth it since a lot of other ramen places charge more nowadays. I was impressed with the tasty, yet non-overbearing flavor of the broth. The simmered pork also had a lot of flavor with a good amount of pieces in the ramen. The egg was your delicious runny yolk style. I got extra noodles for $2.\n\nThe service was also friendly and efficient. Luckily my girlfriend and I came in a bit after 5PM for dinner, because the list of people waiting filled up quickly soon after. It's nice that there's plenty of shops to explore if you know you've got some time before your name is called. Be sure to check where you are on the list though, because there's no automated waiting system. The waiter/waitress just calls your name out.\n\nThe chicken karage was also crunchy and paired really well the squeeze of lime and side of mustard mayo. \n\nNew ramen spot that's closer than Ramen Parlor for me and my girlfriend.

Like, caked in grease kind of slippery. \n\nI ordered the Hakata (tonkotsu) DX:  The broth is proper!  Full bodied and rich.  Great pork flavor with nice color.  Definitely the highlight of the meal.  It came with cha-siu which was fine and fatty porkbelly which was tender and juicy. It has a sweet aftertaste from the seasoning and the natural fats!  Noodles are thin but have a decent bounce to the bite.  My nitpick here was that my egg yolk spilled out of the egg and fully cooked in the broth (sad panda).\n\nMy wife ordered the Paiten DX. There's only 15 per day so we jumped at the chance to try it.  Again the broth superb. A bit of light chicken flavor and the same thin noodles.  Came with a sizzling grilled chicken leg.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-27", "description": "I've been to Marufuku twice since they opened and I'm still disappointed. \n\nThe first time we came here, we tried the Chicken Paitan DX and popcorn chicken. The ramen wasn't very flavorful and I think the chicken side was a little bit too excessive. For those new to Marufuku, the Chicken Paitan DX comes with a giant chicken leg on a stone plate on the side. I wasn't able to finish both the ramen and the giant chicken leg. The popcorn chicken was also very dry and too salty and it wasn't very good. I think you can find better popcorn chicken at any run-of-the-mill boba shop.\n\nThe second time I came here, I tried the Hakata Tonkatsu DX. The menu lists the Hakata Tonkatsu DX as having \"braised pork belly, soft boiled egg, green onions, kikurage mushroom and bean sprouts.\" What the menu doesn't tell you is that the ramen also contains ginger, and you get 1 piece of pork belly and 3 pieces of chashu as the default Hakata Tonkatsu DX option. I opted to get the Buta Kakuni add-on ($2.5 for 2pcs of braised pork belly) with my ramen.\n\nHowever, when I received my Tonkatsu DX, I had only received two pieces of pork belly instead of three, so I asked my waiter what was up with that since I had gotten the add-on. She looked like a deer in headlights and explained that the Buta Kakuni add on means you get 2 pieces total, not 2 extra pieces. In other words, I paid an additional $2.5 for one extra piece of pork belly - so not worth it! The tonkatsu ramen broth is super creamy, fatty and salty, but that's typical of tonkatsu broths.\n\nAll in all, I think Marufuku is a little overpriced and I probably would go to Jinya or Santouka instead of driving to the city for ramen.", "author": "Cathy W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-12", "description": "tl;dr: this is a great Hakata-style ramen shop. For any non-ramen-nerds, Hakata-style ramen is different from the typical Tokyo or fusion-style ramen you'll find in most places in the states. The defining features of Hakata ramen are the thin, hard noodles and rich pork-bone broth -- Marufuku delivers on these two fronts as well as any other place I've had in the states. For any cross-country ramen connoisseurs, the closest analogue to Marufuku that I've had would be Shinsengumi in SoCal.\n\nThe noodles at Marufuku are quintessentially Hakata -- long, thin, and as hard as you'd like. Their menu does not feature the hardness levels of their noodles, but given that its a Hakata-style shop, its implied you can customize. On my initial order I went with their default medium-level of firmness, which was consistent with other ramen shops. When ordering my kaedama, there seemed to be some confusion with the waitress as I simply asked \"can I change the hardness?\" to which she said yes and then left without telling me what firmness levels they had available (since many places, even in Japan, do not serve harigane or beyond). Somehow my second-serving came out relatively quickly and seemed to be consistent with barikata-level noodles, so things worked out anyway, heh.\n\nThe soup for Marufuku's Hakata bowl is rich and creamy, and is typical of what you might find at other decent ramen shops in the bay area (e.g. Orenchi). They don't serve the extra-rich Hakata-style broth that you'll find in most shops in Japan, where the pork bones are left to cook for so long the soup begins to stink and take on a rich (almost putrid) odor to match its strong taste, but thats to be expected as it would likely turn off many visitors who are not accustomed to the region's unique flair. I've actually never encountered that style in the states, so this isn't so much a knock on Marufuku as it is an open question for whether there is a market for it outside of Japan.\n\nI don't care much for toppings or pork meat, but their soft-boiled egg stood out to me as it is was extremely runny, and very pleasant. Their chashu is made with pork belly and was also a bit more pleasant than your typical ramen place's tougher pork loin chashu.\n\nThere wasn't a line on the Thursday evening that I came, and so my group was seated fairly quickly. Generally service was good, but the wait time between ordering and receiving our food seemed longer than expected given how few other parties were ordering.\n\nOverall great spot, and I look forward to trying their chicken ramen next!!", "author": "Omar M."}

Came about 30 minutes before opening time to wait in line.  Unfortunately, I did not make the first round of patrons to be seated, so another half hour later, finally heard my name called.  I found it really annoying that as soon as I sat down, the waitress came by to take my order without me even having a second to glance at it.  Luckily, there were only a few ramen options to choose from so I was able to quickly settle on the chicken paitan dx and hakata dx.  Both soups were creamy and flavorful, although the hakata broth did seem heavy on the palette as I tried to finish it. The braised pork belly was delicious, but the other slices of pork were too fatty and nauseating.  The chicken leg that comes with the paitan dx was super tasty though and a highlight of the meal.  Now, I know that this place gets packed, but I found it extremely rude that the hostess handed me the bill as I was still eating, not bothering to ask if there was anything else I wanted to order.  As soon as I took my last bite, she swooped in to take away everything, then asked if I was done yet.  No mention of whether I needed more water, etc. even though I was clearly out.  They are like a machine there pumping patrons in and out.  I give credit to the rest of the staff inside that look like they are working their butts off...but seriously, after waiting an hour to eat there, you would think a japanese establishment that has such high ratings would attempt to work on their customer service.  The hostess girl who doubles as a server seriously needs to work on her stank face and awful customer service. Her attitude sucks and leaves a bad taste in your mouth to what would otherwise be a decent dining experience.", "author": "Phan .."}

I used to love their Hakata ramen and there was nowhere else in the Bay Area that served it. Hakata ramen usually uses thin ramen noodles instead of the traditional thick ones and their pork-based broth is simply amazing. It is not as heavy as tonkotsu broth, although tonkotsu is also made of pork bones. Here at Marafuku, their Hakata ramen is comparable to the one as Kagura. \n\nI ordered the Hakata deluxe in spicy, which came with 1 piece of kakuni, a slice of chasu, corn, 1 delicious runny egg, bean sprouts, kikurage mushrooms, a piece of nori, and green onions (14.99). I don't like kikurage mushrooms and I was able to sub it for bamboo shoots! The ramen was so delicious and it was definitely nostalgic as I was reminded of Kagura. The price is a bit expensive, but it is understandable being in Japantown. I would definitely come back to order this again because it's just that good! The broth was so good that I almost finished all of it. But be careful, there's obviously a lot of msg in it! \n\nThe geso fry was also cooked to perfection and they serve it with Japanese mayo and a slice of lemon. Kagura also used to serve this and it's soooo good! \n\nThe service was very friendly and attentive. Different servers checked up on us multiple times and always made sure we were accommodated for. The decor is very very nice and modern. You just have to see it for yourself. \n\nI'm not sure but I think this place is owned by the same owner of Kagura since everything is soooo comparable to it.

Fantastic pork broth, very rich and somewhat creamy, lots of veggies, whole egg (not half), and LOTS of ramen noodles. The noodles are a little thinner than what I've had in the past, but they were cooked perfectly.\n\nLimited menu. I think there were 4 or 5 types of Ramen. Some good appetizers. We had the chicken Karage, which was hot out of the fryer. Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Served with a bit of Kewpie, but it didn't really need it.\n\nBe patient, this place is new, so wait staff doesn't have it quite together yet, but are very polite and seem conscientious. It was worth the wait. The restaurant seats maybe 50 - 55 people.\n\nI've had Ramen all over the bay area, and this has to be the top for ME. Some will probably disagree. Wish it was closer to the East Bay. I think it's going to be packed in the future. It was packed when we left and we got there right at 5 pm.", "author": "Cynthia S."}

The noodles are not traditional chewy noodles but a softer thin noodle. What really cost the 2 stars is the way they do business. The Wait is a killer. I was already waiting for an hour for a party of two. But they let party of 4 and then party of 7 go in before us. Turn out its not who have been waiting but how many is in your party. So if there are no 2 seater table available they will let people who just put down their name go in first if they have the \"right\" party number. I really felt that they should call by the order of the list rather than how many is in your party.  If two people have been waiting for an hr and a table for 4 opened up you should just let them sit and let the party of 4 that just showed up wait instead.  Truly.

The food here is greeeaaatt, and the lines forming before opening speak for it. We got there 10 minutes before opening, got in line, and ended up having to put our names on their iPad waitlist, which apparently works through Yelp (though you don't need an account). First time I've used this system, but it's very convenient! You can wander the mall and when your table is almost ready, you get texted. Would have liked to have more clear signage or instructions on what to do afterwards, because it states to see a staff member within 5 minutes or your table might be forfeited. It was a little confusing when we showed up after receiving the text because there is usually a line in front of the ipad, and it was unclear if there was a second line for people who also got texted and were waiting to be seated. There was no staff member up front at the time either, so we were not sure if we were supposed to wait outside with everyone else or go into the restaurant to flag someone down. \n\nAnyways, onto the food!\nWe started with Japanese fried chicken and pork buns. The fried chicken was good, but would probably skip next time. The pork buns were great! The buns were fluffy, and the pork was soft and flavorful. Would order that one again! \nWe both got the Hakata DX. The broth is flavorful and definitely one of my favorites. Not as thick and salty as other places, which was actually a good thing as other places oversalt their broth and therefore appear more flavorful as a result, despite the actual broth itself being meh. So this broth was goood. The noodles were also good as well--great texture and bite.

Went around 12 on a weekday, and still had to wait about 45 mins to get in (although they were pretty quick considering how many people were waiting). Got the fried squid legs, which were a great start! they were delicious, I would suggest ordering another side of mayo for it as they do not give you nearly enough. Then ordered the Hakata Deluxe with Spicy broth. Took my first sip and choked on the harshness of the spice, but while it was spicy, they broth was still quite bland. There was nothing special about the noodles. The braised pork was very tender, yet overly sweet in my opinion, and although the egg was perfectly soft-boiled, it was quite bland as well. I expected this place to compare to the many ramen places I love in New York, but it fell short of my expectations. For San Francisco though, this place may be one of the only places to go for \"quality\" ramen.", "author": "Yeji S."}

Tonkatsu broth is a bit too salty ( I heard the guy next to me say that as well, even his friend said this is best ramen I tried at the beginning, then halfway I heard \"aww..too salty and kept asking to refill water ) , 2. karaage chicken is a bit oily and over cooked but chicken itself is very good, squid leg is very good and fresh but again is a bit oily as well.

The portion is definitely American size, a big bowl of noodle with all fixings plus a big grilled chicken quarter, needless to say my teenager was smiley and satisfied.\n\nThe noodle is Hakata style thin noodle, it's a bit thinner than regular ramen. To me, I feel it captures the flavor of broth better than thicker noodle, but apparently my Japanese friends all want to alert me it's different type. They do offer in spicy broth, which is not too spicy to my family's taste,  we really enjoy it.\n\nAlways a line waiting outside, don't let it discourage you.

Not only is the soup rich and creamy and savory, but it doesn't leave a mouthful of fat and sticky umami in your mouth, like Tsujita does. All it leaves it deliciousness and a craving for more. I've read that service here isn't great, but it was super speedy and efficient for us. We arrived around 8pm on a Wednesday, and even with 13 parties ahead of us, a table for 2 was ready in about 40-45 minutes. Our waitress came by almost immediately, and we started with the squid legs and karaage. Both were fried perfectly and extremely succulent. The squid legs had the perfect texture of being springy and chewy without being overly cooked. The karaage was tops, as the batter was perfect, and the pieces were huge for an appetizer. The ramen itself though...what a delight. For an extra $5, you get corn and both the braised and the simmered pork. I prefer just the simmered, but the braised reminded me of home cooking. Don't forget to dig for your soft boiled egg as you're slurping up the thin noodles. Best ramen place in the city. Easily.

There are couple of booths that look to seat 6, but I saw parties of 2 seated. Moreover, the day I was there, the gal calling out the names had such a weak voice it was extremely difficult to hear her, let alone understanding her.

Came with a group of four on a Thursday lunch and we only had to wait about 5-10 minutes. We all ordered the tonkotsu hakata because we're pretty basic. The noodles were thin and chewy and I thought it was good but the highlight of the ramen was definitely the broth! Hearty and tasty and just the right amount of seasoning. \nThe service was excellent! The waiters and waitresses made sure we got water when needed and checked on us often enough for us not to wave them down. That's awesome in my book. The pricing was fair for any typical ramen place ranging $11-15 a bowl depending on what you get. Probably the best ramen restaurant in Japantown hands down!\nOh and Ramen Dojo is my #1 but their service is not as good compared to Marufuku but their ramen is worth dealing with subpar customer service!", "author": "Anh P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-12", "description": "I tried the takoyaki and Hakata DX ramen and added a bamboo shoots to go. Their service was extremely fast. I think within 5 min my order was ready. \n\nTo-go wise, the takoyaki was pretty good, especially since I ate it when it was still hot. It had a slight crunch on the outside and was soft inside. Proportion of octopus to dough was not bad, though there could always be a bit more octopus!\n\nRamen was not exactly what I was hoping for, which could be a result of several reasons. \n1) I know I ordered to go which may make a difference. However, what disappointed me most were the noodles. When they pack to go, they separate the noodles and meat from the soup. But within the short duration from picking up my order to eating it (maybe 10 min), the noodles were already extremely stuck together and none of the meat or other additions were hot. Even the hot soup could not loosen them entirely, resulting in huge chunks of noodle stuck together. This leads me to think that the to go orders are not quite made to order. Rather, they pre-prepare the noodles, meat, and other additions and just scoop up a container of soup when you order to go. \n2) the soft egg! Could be because I've tried many different ramen places but I definitely was thinking of something different. The egg they have is cold and it's not really RUNNY. It is soft, but it just wasn't quite what I was hoping for.\n\nReviewing the pork... I actually liked the Chasu pork better than the braised pork belly, only reason being that half the pieces of pork belly I got in my order the tougher leaner pieces of pork belly and not the tender fatty pieces. However, the tender pieces were definitely good! Just a matter of getting the right pieces. \n\nOverall, this was okay to me as to go. Could be because I had different hopes and expectations for ramen that this was not amazing to me. But, if you want something fast and to avoid the line, I would recommend at least trying this place as to go. \n\nHowever, one day I do hope to try this again, actually waiting the full duration in line, to see if there will be a huge difference.

If you must try it, try it. You can be the jugde but dont trust yelp reviews too much. We may consider if we are desperate and have zero wait time but I think we still rather go to izumiya or eat something else.", "author": "Victor T."}

Both their chicken and pork are extremely tender and flavorful and pair well with the different broths. The noodles have a great consistency and leave you satisfied. Additionally, they get your ramen to your table quickly, which helps you get into the restaurant when there's a long wait and ensures you aren't waiting very long to eat.", "author": "Reilly C."}

I'm willing to bet that the people leaving bad reviews where expecting a different type of ramen, and dispite their \"knowlage\" of ramen never had this particular type. It's always a big let down when you don't get what you expect, especially If you aren't open to releasing expectations in the first place. Also we all have different tastes and it's fair to say some people just don't like this style, and I suppose if you don't like it you have no choice but to right a bad review if you choose to write one. \nI thought the ramen was exceptional. I stumbled in there by accident and the experience was nice all around. The staff was friendly, but not too bothersome, the ambiance was nice as well. Even the serving bowls added a nice touch to the experience. I didn't even have to wait in line because of good timing, so I'm sure that helped as well.

I would probably give it a 3.5. We got the Hakata Tonkotsu (simmered pork belly), Hakata DX (braised pork belly), and chicken karage.\nKarage had big chunks of juicy meat and was pretty good. For both ramen, we ordered the spicy level and agreed that the broth was deep, rich, and full of flavor. It was one of the best broths I've had! I liked how it was rich, but not too oily. Our main complaint was the the noodles. They were thin like angel hair pasta and not at all like the traditional chewy ramen.

Don't get me wrong, there were plenty of places I came for my first time in the city (and I'm from LA), but there was definitely an impression left by this small humble ramen shop that I won't forget. \n\nThe place, first off, is typical of a lot of ramen places I've been to. Very clean and professional workers, we were greeted promptly and sat down after waiting. I would say dinner is an awesome time to go because of the cooler weather, and you get to drink with it which is great for warming up as well. \n\nI ordered the chicken ramen Dx with a side of chicken karaage bowl. I have to say, this is one of the most unique bowls of ramen I've had, as I'm use to and love hakata style ramen. It comes with a big fat chicken leg and the broth is delicious. The egg is soft boiled to perfection and all the ingredients gave better flavor to the rich and not too robust flavor of the chicken broth. I would definitely recommend this option if you like heartier broths, but don't want to get the typical pork one. My friend ordered the hakata ramen and it was just as good as the chicken one. Pork was perfectly cooked and the slices were generous. Quality of the broth was excellent as well. I would say this ramen pars as one of the best I've had and ranks number 1 in my opinion, when it comes to chicken base. The karaage chicken was very good too, but it was a little dry because it's chicken breast.

Both the braised and simmered pork was tough and dry, as if cooked hot and fast, thus not allowing the fat and connective tissue to render slowly and remain in the meat.  The best part of the Ramen was the broth, but like most types of food that uses a lot of salt, the subtleties of flavors are often hidden.  Overall, this a decent for San Francisco, but isn't as good as the ramen from Orenchi and Halu in Santa Clara.", "author": "Jimmy P."}

It is located on the second floor of the mall and don't let that fool you. I had a type of chicken ramen from the lunch menu. I can't say nor spell the name as well as some Japanese Fried Chicken as an appetizer which I can't say or spell either. The food was brought out pretty quickly. I would have liked the appetizer before the main dish so it was a true appetizer. The ramen is out of this world delicious. It's not like anything I have ever had. The noodles were firm and flavorful and they were more straight than curly. They make the spiciness to your preference and it was perfect for the level. The wait can be rough if you are starving and I mean the wait I so worth it! I sat next to a women who said she had been to Japan 4 times and this place was better than anything she had in Japan so I hope that helps you choose this little slice of deliciousness.", "author": "Nikki G."}

Noodles are thinner than I'm used to and I'm still not sure how I feel about that.\nRamen portions = huge. We were a little confused between their ramen options. Regular vs DX so in case you were wondering, DX has more meat, corn and some other ingredients added in. I got the Hakata Tonkotsu which did not disappoint! Will have to try their chicken based ramen next time. \nThey take their spiciness seriously. I believe they have mild, medium, spicy and ultra spicy. I normally eat pretty spicy, and judging by experience, most restaurants in america have their spiciness scale off, so I ordered spicy thinking it would taste most like a medium. But was actually pleasantly surprised by the spiciness of it.  Another friend got ultra spicy and that was a bit too much to be enjoyable for me \nI loved the spicy cod roe rice bowl, well priced and SPICY \nLastly: be prepared for long waits. Came here on a Saturday night, shortly after 5pm. Wait time was an hour for 3 people.", "author": "B S."}

The interior is dimly lit, and their organization of the booths and middle arrangement were quite neat. There was especially a lot of room at the booths, which was surprising for a ramen place. Their choice of music was awesome; jazzy music which was calming. Service was also really nice :). I was apprehensive about this place since they didn't have miso ramen, but I got the Hakata Tonkatsu with No Spicy, and I can say that I was impressed. Everything was flavorful, and I really liked the meat; it was actually kind of sweet. I was AMAZED by their egg, though. The egg white was soft, and the middle was incredibly soft with some of the yolk oozing out. I think it was the best egg I've tasted from a ramen shop. I was also surprised I liked their thin noodles since I usually like the thick and chewy ramen noodles instead. I basically enjoyed everything except for the pink ginger, I presume it to be LOL. Needless to say, this place is awesome!!!", "author": "Kristine T."}

One Taller gentlemen waitperson  staff recommended the $9.50 beer saying that it was 'beautiful' and had a sweet aftertaste.  He could not describe it Further. I asked him if it were a light lager like Stella Artois but he cannot say except for it is has a sweet finishing taste. the staff needs a lot of education,  and refinements.  The Beer did not need my expectations especially a $9. 50 12 ounce beer. The beer it's in the IPA category by the way. \n\n3 to 4 people came up to my table with their suggestions on what I should order!   I wasn't seeking that many suggestions it's a ramen shop not coi.  In the  end I ordered a basic spicy basic ramen with the pork belly spicy. \n\nhard to mixup that , unfortunately they gave me someone else's order and I took a bite or two thinking  this is not spicy.   They brought me out another bowl of Ramen which turned out to be my next table Who seem irritated at me.. It was an awkward encounter.  Two awkward encounters already. My spicy Ramen eventually came.   the noodles are thinner than I've come to expect. The broth was edible however 3 to 4 service people came to check on me during that time. Seriously just bring me my food check on me once or twice and that's enough you don't have to check in before five times while I am eating and I have to stop and answer you again and again. The restaurant was fairly empty a quarter full and I think the staff needed to be educated or refined are there cooking and their menu..  I suggest the owner have a sit down session with his new hirees every day for an 15 min explaining the concept of his restaurant.    \n\nAll in all I spent 20 min in the restaurant. And spent 30 plus dollars on a not so great meal with unrefined service on a beer. Came out of there not knowing if I will go back", "author": "Stefan N."}

My bf just came back from Japan so he wasn't expecting much (he's lived there too). He said it was good and this is the standard in Japan. I, too be honest, do not like ramen because I don't like creamy foods and ramen is very heavy and fatty for me. However, the broth here was not too heavy or fatty. It was not overly salty as well unlike most ramen places in the bay. The noodles were the right stiffness and the soup was excellent. Especially the chicken ramen.
