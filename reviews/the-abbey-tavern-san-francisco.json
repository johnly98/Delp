Pretty empty and spacious bar with a lower level and a slightly higher level with a pool table, two dart boards and a broken fooseball. Normally I love going to these types of bars with activities like pool and dart boards but the bartender really needs some changing. My boyfriend exchanged 3 dollar bills for quarters but when we walked to the pool table, he realized that the bartender only gave him $2 worth of quarters so he went back to the bar to let her know. She gave attitude and proceeded to open the cash register, ruffled the dollar bills and said she was pretty sure he only gave 2 dollars. Although she ended up giving that dollar worth of quarters back, the attitude was unnecessary. Service does mean a lot.. especially at such an empty bar like that on a Saturday night. I probably will not be coming back.\n\nI can see so much potential at this bar, but unfortunately we didn't have such a great experience here. \n\nPS This bar should also consider getting more darts since there's only enough darts for one of the two dart boards at the bar.", "author": "Amy L."}

I especially like Thursday night! They have a great DJ playing some music from the 90s~. Yes!! Everything gets a plus one when they have good music playing. It sucks it's only on Thursday night... I think I went on a Saturday night and they had a local band. It's great they support their locals!\n\nSpeaking of which. They hang a lot of sports banners. Mostly bay area, you know. Represent. It's actually pretty cool to look at all the ones they have. Plus they always play the games on their TVs. So great place to grab a drink and watch a game. \n\nMake sure you have your ID ready as you walk in the door. They always have someone checking as you walk in. They have I think a $15 minimum for cards. So make sure you have some cash unless you're gonna spend more than that. Their drinks are pretty reasonable price. And they got weekly/monthly specials on certain beers. So check it out. \n\nThey have two pool tables and booths as you walk further back.

If you are a fight fan, this is the place to catch the next Mayweather, Manny , Canelo Alvarez, GGG, Kovalev, Abner Mares and many more HBO (regular and PPV) and Showtime PPV fights. They show all the fights on several TVs in the bar and also project it on a HUGE screen in the front.\n\nWhereas at other Bars (Jillians, Rumors) you will likely meet the casual fan who thinks that only Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather box and also get giddy matching up a lightweight with a light-heavyweight fantasy fight, most partrons of this Bar on Fight Night are very knowledgeable about Boxing, and you will get called out if you don't have your facts straight! This makes for fun conversations and a fun night watching boxing, where you learn something new about the sport (if you can even call it that) everytime you go there.\n\nCover is usually 20$ on Fight nights, and people complaining about this charge need to realize that PPV Broadcast Networks charge Commercial establishments like this upwards of $2000 minimum to telivise the fights. So the Bar isn't making any money on the cover, because it would require like 100 partrons to show up just to break even.\n\nThe Bar is a little \"dive-y\" and the don't have food, but they let you bring your own, which really works out if you have food allergies or like to watch games or fights munching on your favorite snack or food.

You pull out a little and then you suck a line of cocaine into your cigarette by inhaling hard into the cigarette as you run the tip of the cigarette across the line.  He called it a \"coke smoke.\"  Sometimes after a few coke smokes we would go do graffiti around SF...sometimes in the MUNI tunnels.\n\nAnyways, good ol' Irish George loved Abbey Tavern.  I was more into dance clubs...not Irish bars at the time...I was through my Irish bar phase, lol.  I had already been there one time but I didn't really like it much and didn't go back until Irish George made it sound so great.  So they had different theme nights, I forget what the theme of the night was...but everyone was in their early 20s..  There was an Irish female bartender there I enjoyed talking to.  \n\nGeorge and I and a couple other friends would go there and flirt with people and go outside get stoned and then come back in.  It was really fun.  Excellent beer selection.  I could talk to people about Beamish and if it was better than Guinness or not.  \n\nLast time I saw old Irish George it was in the East Bay and he shocked me by injecting heroin into his arm while his friend did the same thing in front of me in George's car without any warning.  \n\nGeorge had moved up from opium tea to injecting heroin.  He was always such a hippie potsmoker so I was pretty shocked.  George and his friend wanted some more heroin or some crack and so we went to Oakland and I went along for the exciting ride.

You can grab a good beer or strong/cheap drink, mingle with the guys who's asses may very well be planted to the bar stools. There's one crappy pool table with walls a little too tight to make a great shot and random games in the back. Bathrooms are fairly clean, place smells like an Irish pub should (old stale beer). Sometimes there's food, but I recommend getting pizza nearby if you're hungry for something edible. \n\nNIGHTTIME - This place is a whole different scene when the sun goes down. The regulars stumble off their stools and either pass out so they wake up at 6am to do it again the next day or move to another pub (like Fizzee's) where they won't be bombarded by 18 year old drunkards. \n\nDancing is always fantastic here. My bouncer always knows he's gonna get a great show as soon as I walk in. I was a regular on the dance floor for many years until the 18 year olds started annoying me too much. Now and then I still travel back for a great workout. I absolutely LOVE to dance and am usually 'that girl' who's dancing by herself and singing along to every song that comes on. If you see me here, I will challenge you to a dance off and I will win. My friends have started limiting my time here because I don't they can keep up. Dancing here is definitely on my happy list.\n\nDJs are either extremely nice or extremely rude. They DO take requests even if they sometimes tell you they don't. \n\nJaegger-Bombs are my drink of choice from this bar. Their drinks are always strong and pretty cheap. \n\nThings to watch out for:\n-Fake Irish Accent Boys (they do it to get chicks, don't be one of the stupid ones who falls for it)\n-The crazy of the night. Don't get stuck in a convo/ dance-off with them.

I'm not too into boxing but I went to tag along with one of my friends who would be stuck watching the fight alone.  I arrived at 6:45 pm on a Saturday and it was pretty empty.  It was very dark and most of the televisions were set for the fight.  There were a few others that were on a soccer game (probably because the owner was Irish).  \n\nLet's discuss the venue.  Parking is quite difficult but I was lucky and parked down a neighboring street.  The location is decent . . . in the heart of the Richmond District.  The bar is on a corner and shares the block among a variety of good restaurants.  The Abbey Tavern is very dim inside and it is somewhat clean.  I guess you shouldn't expect cleanliness in a bar, right?  There are two levels.  The first level (main level) has a big screen television (projection on a wall) and a few other smaller televisions on a wall above the bar.  The second level has a pool table, the restrooms and a pin ball machine.  We were lucky enough to have the cubby seating on the second level and play pool while we watched the fights.  \n\nI was pleased to discover that they have IPA on tap.  YUM!  The bar manager/owner is very nice and was kind enough to turn the television up (the only one they had upstairs) when we couldn't hear the fight too well due to the background noise.  He also kept filling up our snack bowl with Chex Mix to complement our ice cold IPA beer.  I ran into two Irish patrons and they were extremely nice and very talkative.  I'm sure they were drunk given they were slurring their words but it's always nice to talk to kind drunk folks.  \n\nI would definitely come here again.  I think more people should patron this bar as I feel it's a hidden gem in the Richmond.  Most bars in the Richmond and Sunset are run down and have bad service.  The owner/manager of Abbey Tavern is very nice and is very welcoming.  I had a great experience here and will not hesitate to stop by the Abbey Tavern for a beer . . .

I was starving and had asked him how much the pizza cost him and instead of telling me he proceeds to share half of his! That pretty much sums up my experience here.

So, I transplanted myself over to this joint, and was happy to find like-minded NY fans (a couple of whom I used to see at O'Shea's) rooting on the old hometown teams. Always great to have like-minded people to celebrate (or commiserate) with.\n\nDepending on my mood (and whether I had anything to do that day), I could either consume some of their good, strong coffee, or (even better) a Bloody Mary or 2 while cheering/jeering my teams and opponents. There was usually a solid representation of fans from other cities, and the bar has a series of TV's tuned in to every game, so I/we could see how other teams in our divisions were faring. I even brought my roomie Fernando over there when he moved in a little over a year ago, and we'd use the pool table in back while catching games on the Tube.\n\nHowever, up until this past weekend, I hadn't been in to the bar, since nearly every week, I'd been able to catch my NY teams on regular TV (including the Jets-Giants matchup a couple weeks back, which is very rare on national TV). \n\nSo, I struggled in after another late-nite at Mezzanine to see the Jets/Eagles game last week, and found the place nearly empty. There were a few scattered people at the bar (including some Eagles fans, ugh) and maybe another 1/2 dozen types sprinkled in. Another small group was catching European Soccer on a screen in the curtained-off lounge area upstairs, but that was it.\n\nI was a bit disappointed/perplexed, but I grabbed a chair nonetheless, and had myself a couple seriously good Bloodies, while watching my Jets struggle to score. The owner recognized me and noted I hadn't been in recently, which was kinda cool. The Jets lost, however. \n\nIt would seem that digital cable, satellite and even NFL.com (games to the desktop PC) have stolen people away from the bar, which is too bad. It's way more fun to see a game with a group in general, I think.\n\nOh well, at least those Bloodies still rock, and they missed me, so I'll be going back on Sundays as time permits...\n\n[Update]\n\nBeen catching games sporadically, since my hometown NY JETS and NY GIANTS have both been on national TV quite a bit. However, when I do go, I still get some of the best Bloody Marys in SF, and I have a few expatriate NYer's to either celebrate or commiserate with. The lovely lass behind the bar each Sunday takes good care of me, and the owners are 2 really nice guys who always say hi to me and spend time chatting. \n\nIn fact, they invited me to DJ there on New Year's Day 2011! I'm extremely pleased and honored to make my debut there, so come get a little \"hair of the dog\" with me and kick off 2011 in true Rock 'n' roll fashion!!!", "author": "ACE A."}

We feel that it would deserve 5 stars if only it was a bit more crowded. Seriously, it can be sadly deserted, and I don't understand why. The Saturday night DJ spins great music, and I *would* be out there dancing, except that I would also be alone on the dance floor, and I don't have enough confidence or talent for that.\n\nWe started our night a couple blocks away on Geary, at the Buckshot Bar. It was packed (the 38 stops right outside the front door, and the bus seems to empty directly into the bar) -- I had to weave through about 30 drunk guys dressed as Santa. The frat boy atmosphere combined with the what-is-he-thinking-DJ drove us out of the Buckshot Bar. That's when we discovered the Abbey Tavern.\n\nGenuine Irish bartenders; nice flat screen TVs; good margaritas (and lemon drops! Sorry -- I am fond of girly drinks); a talented DJ who is a Cal fan; a pool table; all this is well and good. But the 4th star is earned by the clean and spacious women's bathroom! My girlfriends and I decided that we would like to live in the bathroom. However, that may have been because we were fairly tipsy at the time. Good times at the Abbey Tavern!\n\nI would be dangerously close to making this my neighborhood bar if only I lived a bit closer. As it is, I will have to rely on the 38. I will still support it faithfully and I hope you do the same, particularly if you are male, single, straight, smart, cute, etc. Or, at a minimum, if you will help a girl out on the dance floor every now and again, even if all you know how to do is the lawnmower.", "author": "S R."}

Kevin loves this place because the pool table is in a remote section of the pub.

I've never had to pay for more than 1 of my 9 -10 drinks when I'm there, so that's always a plus because I'm cheap.  \n\nTook one star off because I haven't been there for awhile, and because I've only been there friday nights.

The bartender didn't understand what I was saying and gave it to us in a shot glass. Whatever; my friend and I sipped on it for awhile. About half way through, the owner comes over out of nowhere and says that he saw us drink it all and since the glass wasn't empty he accused us of reaching OVER the bar and stealing another shot. It was absolutely ludicrous. After that, he wouldn't serve us! Now, if he had seen us do it... ok. If the people next to us had seen us do it, ok.

All in all I only bought 2 beers that night, everything else was free(as in my new friends were generous). The free food buffet they offered consisted of burgers, chicken drumsticks, and chili, not the best, but you can't complain about free really.  After the game they had a guy playing guitar, who was actually pretty decent, played songs everyone knows.  In terms of the crowd, it might have been because it was the supper bowl, but a lot of Irish guys(not uncommon at an Irish bar) and a fair amount of good looking girl groups.

When I started to walk down Geary I did not have a particular bar in mind but I wanted to find someplace I had never been to before; I have been to Ireland 32 (liked it) and a few places on Clement. I looked inside Abbey and became a little hesitant; there were about 10 guys inside and one girl. Now, I like going to bars but sometimes it is boring going alone. I decided to go in anyway; they had about 10 TVs on so there was no way I could get bored while waiting for my friend. I ordered a Stella, grabbed a table and watched the Wisconsin vs. Seattle game on the big screen; I am not super into football but it was entertaining. The Stella tasted a little flat so I decided to make my next one a Guinness. There was a very nice Irish lad at the bar that made me feel right at home with a little pleasant conversation and harmless flirting. It was when I was chatting him up that I noticed soccer on the TV I could not see from my seat; there had been a pole in the way all that time. So, long story short, I sat on the other side of my table and was able to watch soccer, hockey, football and poker all at once; It just does not get any better then that. \n\nThe last wonderful surprise of the evening came on my 3rd trip to the bar, my new friend informs me that they have food for the Monday night football crowd. I thought it would be chips or hot dogs, it was not.

I don't know exactly what went down, but I know my friend is not a shit starter. I see him get sucker punched. Me, along with the 20 or so people we were with, were dumbfounded. The owner and bouncer come forward to put down any potential scuffle, and because the guy was the owner's friend, and \"he didn't see anything happen,\" the guy didn't get kicked out, nor did he left the bouncer throw the guy out. Great way to run your business!", "author": "Rod M."}

However, I will always remember the Abbey as the place I met one of my true loves..(.xo GG!)", "author": "Serena A."}

Sometimes I miss the days where I can go to a place filled with young people, drink $5 pitchers of Bud and dance until 2am.  I stopped going here on a weekly basis by the time I was 22 and I felt like I was on the higher end of the age spectrum.  If you want a place where everyone is beyond drunk and having a good time.... you've found it.\n\nThese days I'd be more likely to take in a fight or a sporting event at The Abbey but I will always remember (maybe not so vividly) my Thursday nights in college that I used to spend at this place. I've been wanting to head back to be a spectator moreso than a participant but I haven't done so yet. Cheers Abbey, thanks for making this a great college party spot!", "author": "Adam C."}

One time I was here on a Friday and it had a pretty good crowd and a DJ spinning some old school and top 40 with everyone getting down. Another Friday I walked in and it was completely empty with some guy that looked like his name could be Cletus performing with his hillbilly band. So if you plan to come here be prepared to have a plan B just in case.", "author": "Joseph T."}

Great mixed crowd with attentive bartenders.  If you're short, 5'2\", like I am the boys at the bar are always willing to place your order for you.

We took up the little nook near the dart board, and had fun. So then they decided to go through a remodel...great...\nThey closed down for a month, and my friends and I were waiting for them to open. Well, opening night, it was crowded, bright, and very unwelcoming. They also no longer have that nook, and whereas before you had some privacy, now there's none. But okay, we gave it another shot yesterday --  a week later -- and were EXTREMELY disappointed. First off, the bouncer is cool, he's a great guy. But that's where the politeness stops. Going up to the bar, I see they have a new guy. I order an AMF for my bf, and instead of going \"i don't know what that is\" he goes and asks 4 times (and i answer 4 times) \"I can't hear you!\" So I finally had to tell him what the AMF stand for -- dude got b#!!hurt, and then goes and asks for my ID. I got pissed off at that point and it doesn't help when some stranger is next to me saying I'm underage. Just because I look 18 doesn't mean I am. And the bouncer already checked my ID when we came in. So then I ask for the girl to make my drink (after showing my ID). So he comes up to her, and whispers something in her ear, and then she gets an attitude (which isn't the first time with her). And she won't serve me the drink. She refuses to acknowledge me. \nAnd you know what, the owner was there and he was rude to our party too. This was horrible. The good bartenders don't work there anymore (one quit and the other doesn't work fridays anymore), and the place just sucks now. From now on, it's Bitter End and Blarney Stone. Abbey is not seeing another penny from me or my group of friends. \nAnd I don't recommend it because their prices went up quite a bit, and the service sucks at the bar.", "author": "Katia T."}

It probably mostly has to do with the fact I met my fiance here but its still cool. I have spent many a nights here, drinking and dancing the night away although I do have to say that the crowd is just not the way it was 2-3 years ago. The past few times we have been here on weekends there has been nobody here....it was kinda weird. I also miss the old \"pool/smoking\" area even though I am not a smoker. Word is some girl complained and they got fined and had to shut it down or something. Not sure if that is true though.", "author": "Ashley M."}

I can understand having hot looking chick bartenders with half a clue, but decent looking bartenders with no clue...unexceptable. The service was the absolute worst and the price for a beverage was just ok.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-13", "description": "okay so i'm giving this 4 stars because of all the memories and ridiculousness that happened at the abbey tavern when i was a student at usf. in all honesty, this place is a meat market of nastiness on the busy days (thurs-sat.). total irish spot. if you like drunk, illegal irish men working in construction, this is THE place to find them. you will get hit on and/or groped and quite possibly offered drugs. I'm pretty sure if you like drunk college girls from USF you'll probably find a few there. Trust me, i know, i've been there (amen for that pedro arrupe shuttle) don't be surprised if you walk into the back room where the pool table is and you see a naked stripper. (true story). And don't be surprised if you witness a bar fight or two, three etc. Just make sure you get out of there if you're holding something illegal. The cops love to wait outside the Abbey sometimes. Also, if you like cheesy eurotrash, the weekends give you plenty of that. And hey, if you pretend to be a drunk lesbian you might score a pack of rolos (true story, again)\n\ncome here for the football matches, but leave if you're not into the hot sweaty euro trashy scene on the weekends.", "author": "monica p."}

Sucks for me because I'm not Irish. Those who show up just to hang out, drink and have no interest in watching the fights are screaming over the tv volume making it impossible to hear what I just paid $15 to hear. Some of the smaller tv's have a good/decent picture but are very small. The larger screen in the front has seen better days, and the screen in the back is trash. Brunette bartender is nice, blonde bartender is not so nice. Both are super slow. My buddies and I spend considerable amounts of cash each time we go, and never one drink on the house and not even a good pour. I guess tap beer might be the way to go at this place. Lot's of very drunk people. Some are cool, but others seem to have the run of the place including starting fights and are allowed to stay because they are regulars. Not much personality going on here including from the staff. I'll definitely be looking for a new UFC hangout.", "author": "Brian C."}
