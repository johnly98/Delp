From the first moment I walked in, I was greeted by such a friendly energy from both the bartender and regulars that it felt like I had known them my whole life. I quickly made friends that I still have to this day (4 years later) and some of the greatest experiences of my adult life have transpired there.\n\nOne of the best things about Lush is that it takes on a whole new feel after about 8:30pm. The day shift feels like a neighborhood bar with chill music, nice regulars, and friendly bartender. While I spent most of my time there between 3 and 730pm, I occasionaly popped in at 10 or 11pm to find the place bumping with great music and plenty of young singles having a great time. \n\nIf you are looking for a fun place to either wind down or crank it up, Lush is for you!", "author": "Travelling G."}

Warm, hipster, and casual environment.  Music in the background,but at the perfect volume so that you can still talk and hear each other.  Drinks are surprisingly affordable for San Francisco....beers available as low as $6 and wells drinks as low as $8.  Not the most exciting place to be on a Saturday night, but you won't be disappointed either.  Probably a great spot for your first Tinder date on a week night.", "author": "Chun P."}

Also usually the very first bar I go to because of their affordable drinks, good vibes, and chill environment. I remember the first time I came here with 5 other people on a Friday night and it wasn't too crowded nor was it too empty. We ordered 6 tequila shots and I think it was about $5 a shot! Pretty decent place to start your night  with that kind of price! We also got a free cocktails/mixed drinks which were pretty unique and good too! Didn't pay a cover fee and there were restrooms conveniently in the back. One of the cocktails I had was the mojito. Didn't taste like it had too much alcohol in it and a tad bit diluted with too much ice but a good drink to sip on while chilling with friends. \n\nThey have quite a few seats upstairs and and open area on the bottom floor to just chill/possibly dance. \n\nOverall great place and I will always recommend this place for a person starting their night at Polk street!", "author": "Amy L."}

I've been a patron at the place for years now and, once every blue moon, you'll have some entitled folk stagger in inebriated and harsh everyone's mellow.\n\nThis was the case this past Sunday, 3/4, when a gaggle of twenty-somethings decided to imbibe more alcohol than their fragile little bodies could tolerate. I knew things were going left when this group started shattering more glasses than a couple at a Jewish wedding and one of the blokes in the group kept nodding off like a heroin addicted jazz musician. Lyndsay kindly asked them to leave as they'd had their fill of \"potent potables\", a request the group verbally protested with unsavory language. Ultimately, the group called the police because one of the members allegedly misplaced her identification and accused Lyndsay, the bartender, of holding it hostage. The knackered clique phoned the police, who showed up a few hours later and didn't give the kids the resolution they'd expected.\n\nLush Lounge is a great spot if you're looking for a good cocktail and a place to meet friendly people.

I am a 27 year resident of this city, have spent my fair share of time on Polk Street, but had never been here. It was very hot inside due to the heat, and I was drinking a ginger-ale that I had purchased at the bar. I stepped outside on to Polk Street for some fresh air and was leaning into the large open window talking to my friends when one of your bartenders aggressively surprised me and grabbed my glass. In a ridiculously harsh manner, she directed me back into the bar telling me that no drinking or smoking was allowed on the street in front of that window. Her tone was unnecessarily tough and escalated, and she was combative and ready for an argument. I was really surprised by how aggressive she came at me. For my part, I am always very happy to be told when there are rules, and when politely told, I'll do my best to abide by them. But, the right way to do this is to say \"Excuse me sir, not sure if you're aware, but there's a rule here... can you please take your drink inside...\" This is NOT what happened. Flustered, I went up to the bar to try and explain to her why her behavior towards a paying customer was wrong and inappropriate. She clearly had some fantasy about how she had handled the interaction, insisting to me that she had used words like \"please\" and \"excuse me.\" She verbally mocked me multiple times, bordered on homophobic when mimicking my mannerisms, and then quickly realized that I was extremely angry at this and then became a cold face automaton as her way of dealing with the situation. Some one needs to train this particular bartender on how to deal with diverse customers, and some one needs to explain to her that there are hundreds of places where we can spend our money in SF. Yes, Polk Street is a challenging street. Yes, we're in a heatwave. But, those of us who choose be consumers in San Francisco and participate in public life should not be subjected to thoughtless, aggressive people like the one I encountered yesterday evening working at this establishment. I have rarely had such a rude, unwelcoming experience in this usually very warm and friendly city. I left your establishment very upset, and I will not return.", "author": "Marc S."}

Oh wait, maybe I was the old lush, but I can be the new lush, too, right? It was Happy Hour, and we were already late since it starts at 3PM. The Lemon Drop wasn't on the list, but other temptations compensated. Jamie went for the tantalizing $6 Don Q Mojito evoking Havana nights he's never had (photo: http://bit.ly/1c2wmxL).

I was legitimately scared for my safety around the security guards and left the first chance I had. \n\nI've never been to a bar where I felt so uncomfortable and in danger. Security guards are meant to keep the building capacity at the correct number and escort unruly people out.

There's an upstairs which is sometime used for private events but when it's opened up it allows for a lot more room at Lush. The only bar is downstairs so you'll still have to go to up and down the stairs but long as you keep a sharp mind, the stairs will be no threat.\n\nThe bar is long so you probably won't have an issue getting to the front. There's usually only three or four bartenders serving the entire bar though so you'll be waiting awhile. They have a $20 minimum on credit cards and since drinks are pretty cheap you'll have to drink quite a bit to reach the minimum. Personally I think that's a blessing in disguise. \n\nLush is both a good place to start and end the night. There's no cover fee and it's a convenient place to meet up. It's purely a bar but there are dance clubs like Playland, Mayes, and Vertigo very close by. My recommendation? Stop by Lush first to get your drink fix and then head out to some dance clubs. End up at Lush again at the end of the night to share stories and keep drinking.", "author": "Philip W."}

First off, the bouncer took a look at my Ohio driver's license (because I'm originally from Ohio, surprise surprise) and said it looked fake. No scanner. No questions to see if the ID really was mine (and I memorized my driver's license number). Instead, my friends filed in while I had to search for a photo of my passport on my phone -- which I have because I was in the middle of a job search and sent a scanned copy to my new employer. Thus, I stood in the rain searching on my phone while 2 bouncers stood there holding my ID and letting everyone else pass. I am 24. I did not need this, and I can't believe he was so rude. Finally, I showed him my passport image and he let me in. When my friends and I complained to the bartender and tried to let him know so that others may not run into the same issue, the bartender shrugged it off. The incident definitely dampened my mood and the music and alcohol the rest of the night did not make the situation any better. This place is definitely not worth returning, especially not for all of the inconveniences it caused me.", "author": "Jane T."}

It wasn't at all though. The inside of the bar is kind of rustic with barrels as tables and game plants having from the ceiling. \n\nWe went during happy hour, so drinks were very reasonable. We got a gimlet, which was smooth and sweet; a dark and stormy, my favorite; and a sweet tea, which was served in a mason jar. Oh, and of course the $3 bud light. After happy hour, it gets more expensive, so I would probably only come before 7pm. \nThe bar wasn't crowded when we went, so we had no problem finding a barrel to talk around.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-07-14", "description": "I don't drink alcohol, so I can't comment on the drinks.  A friend rented the second floor for his birthday party, so I went and was pleasantly surprised.  \n\nFirst, everyone was friendly from start to finish.  When I told the ID checker I was here for a birthday party, he asked for my friend's last name so he could more easily direct others arriving after me.  On the way out, I asked the security guard for bus directions.  He saved my night by telling me exactly where to go.  Had I not asked him, I would have ended up on the wrong side of the street and missed the last Caltrain at 12:01AM.  \n\nSecond, the bartenders didn't dally after I made eye contact.  I usually tip a dollar a drink, and they seemed fine with that.  (I was buying drinks for my friends.)  They also smiled when my friend made a joke: \"The strawberry fizz [a girly drink] is for him,\" she said.  \n\nThird, the location is convenient.  There's a bus stop right outside the bar, and plenty more on Van Ness, which is one block up.  As of July 2013, the #47 on Van Ness goes to the Caltrain station on 4th and King, and if you're heading back, you want to make sure you cross the street on Van Ness.  \n\nTwo final points: 1) I arrived at 9:45PM on a Saturday night, and the bar wasn't busy.  It seems like more people started showing up at around 10:10PM.  By 11:20PM, the place was packed; 2) in case you're wondering, this is not a bar where people dance (at least not when I was there).  There is music--I heard Michael Jackson's ABC and recognized a few other songs--but the place gets so busy at night, people don't have space to dance.", "author": "Matt R."}

It is not this at all.  \n\nLush starts off the evening with a nice vibe, mature and comfy, with a casual ambiance to meet up with friends to imbibe a few and catch up with friends and their latest drama or gossip. It isn't crowded early, and the drinks are reasonable, like $8 call and $7 well. \n\nThe long single bar is to the left, there is a large picture window in front which is open on nice days to the street, with tables and chairs there and around the edges of the room. There is an upstairs mezzanine section for the overflow or private function crowd, but there isn't any table service that I could see. It is step up to the bar and order. \n\nThere are plenty of helpful bartenders, so the wait is never long. They offer a blackboard of specialty concoctions like most hip bars in SF do nowadays, but they aren't bogging down the bartenders with 5 minute prep time drinks with crushed fruits, shaken and never stirred girlie combos, mortar and pestle veggies, and a dab of bitters. \n\nLush Lounge is part of the Polk Street corridor of nightlife spots, where on weekends, particularly after 11 PM, the streets fill up with young revelers looking for a good party time. After 11pm here, the vibe changes from comfy and friendly to young hotties, single ready to mingle, and a line forms almost exactly at the strike of 11. \n\nIt isn't like the dance clubs in the TenderNob, since there is no dance floor here, and you can easily talk over the music, unlike most clubs, or even some bars like Rickhouse on Kearny. If you don't like the vibe (or change in vibe) here, you can just walk down the street to another spot on the Polk corridor. \n\nDecades ago, Polk Street used to be famously Gay, before it was castrated by the Castro. You'll still see the occasional cross dresser and trannies in the lower Polk, which is an area that used to also have male prostitutes. But up here on the upper Polk area, it is Hetero, with the young Marina crowd migrating up as the evening wears on, and they tire of Buffy and Bif (or should I say Mitt?) named lawyers in the Marina spots. \n\nDuring fleet week, there were groups of the Few, the Proud, the first in battle, roaming the bars in uniform, prowling for friend, not enemy. We applauded them and befriended them, thanking them for their service. I think they were looking for girls, but since the repeal of don't ask, don't tell, anything is game on Polk Street.

One of the downsides is that their restrooms are single stalls, so there can be a line especially during those busy weekend nights.

Granted, I can't recall ever going to the old digs (hence the lush name-calling), but with cool decor, a fireplace, an upstairs, and good friends, I was pleasantly surprised by this place.\n\nGreat happy hour prices, interesting happy hour drinks, and happy times with friends?  Me happy.  \n\nOne suggestion?  I got the happy hour fruit bubbly drink, and it always wasn't consistent.  At one point very sweet, at one point very champagne.  I'm a fan of both, but these were dramatically different.    Consistency is easier to recommend.\n\nI've also heard that it (specifically the music) can get incredibly loud on the weekends past a certain time.  As someone who is fast approaching my geriatric years, I like my places to have a chill vibe.  The frat sounds should remain in the marina.", "author": "Pam S."}

Roomy and spacious, this bar was the bar of choice on NYE. $15 cover wasn't bad and the bar wasn't that overcrowded when we arrived. We found a little spot in the corner of the bar to hang out. Drinks weren't that difficult to get. I had a few of the cucumber ones and they were pretty tasty. My date bought us a bottle of champagne they were offering for $30 for the midnight toast. Good call on his part. Music was a mixed bag which was great. Something for everyone. One thing that sucked was the line for the bathrooms. There was only 1 bathroom each for men and women and it was horrible. \n\nI had an awesome night at Lush regardless and had one of the best NYEs ever.

Around midnight, we wanted to find a spot to have some drinks and kick it...well Lush Lounge delivered.  The first thing that caught my fancy was this: when we stood at the bar to order drinks, the bartender looked us in the eyes and he DIDN'T IGNORE US.  Say what now?!  He won my heart.  And he made the best darn Strawberry Bourbon.  The drink was outstanding, reasonably priced, and packed a punch.  So much so, I ordered 2.  Lush also has an upper seating area, which was qqqquuuute.  Unfortunately It was roped off, but we sat near the window and had a great time.\n\nLemme tell you....Polk street is much more entertaining than any reality show on the market!!!\n\nThe downside: the bar only accepts cash.  But, in this day and age of bank gouging, I understand!  The upside: there is an ATM inside the bar, so you don't have to walk outside.\n\nI heard some folks making negative comments about the area and the homeless people hanging outside of the bar.  Here's the thing: its Polk street, its Fillmore, its San Francisco...it's the world we live in.

The place has an upstairs complete with a banister that allows you to look down at the crowd and plot targets like a an electromyography exercise, in other words, you can spot the cute guy or girl and make your way down the stairs and move in for the kill. The place is modeled to resemble an old parlor and the crowd is about as electric as hipster district Valencia and won't fail to disappoint, whether you're trying to get laid or not lol.\n\nExpect it to be crowded and expect problems trying to move through the crowd as blaring music will muffle any propriety such as \"excuse me\" or even in worst case scenario, they hear you and refuse to move anyway.\n\nThe drinks are reasonably priced, and by reasonably I mean reasonable for a place that doesn't list the prices at all on the overhanging menu.\n\nThe bartenders have a variable knowledge of pour mans friends and also showcased strong shots for $3 in lemonade dispensers.

But I never really have to wait to get inside and, once inside, I never really have to wait long to get a drink.\n\nA bar is only as good as its staff, and, like my other local favorite bar, Koko Cocktails, Lush Lounge's expert drink crew are professional and friendly.

There was no pre-story or history to his behavior / no personal issues whatsoever. That is why I think the owner should know about the following behavior of him.\n\nHe pushed people (not only us 10) out of the way before cleaning the table and did not even excuse himself. It was so sad to see him being even extremely rude AFTER being clumsy. He touched and literally cussed people out and said that this behavior was normal in a public bar. He even told the security to remove the barrel table in front of us 10 people and made up poor excuses that they \"need\" the table outside of the bar where 2 other barrel tables were already uselessly standing around. No apologies, not even a try to talk things out. All that seemed normal for him and \"customer oriented\".\nWell, we didn't think so. And so did the other guests around us...

The superior lounge was the best purveyor of superior cocktails on the hill. It was not a regular stop for me as it had two primary problems, the space was very small and the clientele was a bit FIDI and low brow. \n\n  The new LUSH location has remedied both of these problems. First the location is just up the street but the size has been increased by 500%. I am quite taken with the new space. Beginning with the citadel strength doors that bar the entry portal to the two story open main room, a loft level located towards the back, a fireplace directly across from the bar. A perfect ambient level of light, dark but not so dark. The size of the room does a good job at mitigating the din. \n\n  The clientele now is a lovely mix of local color. A comfortable and welcoming balance of every gender, orientation, creed and profession. I believe the Gulch has finally found the all encompassing social hall. I fear that it will be short lived as it will no doubt be invaded by the unsavory Marina sorts, hipsters and their ilk, so I advise to enjoy while it lasts.\n\n  The cocktails remain superior, mandating fresh squeezed juices and the cocktails be hand made with craftsmanship. Considering the quality the prices are most reasonable. It pains me to write a review as I hate to put it on the map, but seeing that I no longer reside in the neighborhood and am infrequently in the hood( regrettably) I shall hope this recommendation will find its way to the eyes and ears of the sophisticated and happy socializers.

I'm sure there's a menu on the way, but it was a letdown for the group I had persuaded to come try the most creative and delicous drinks in town.\n\nOn the plus side, the new space is beyond gorgeous with a fireplace to boot, the best bartenders from the old location are back in town and serving up the works (unfortunately just not for said experience)\n\nAll in all, still one of the best bars on Polk- I anticipate this becoming a new hotspot once word gets out it's re-opened.", "author": "Gabrielle J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-28", "description": "I love LUSH! I moved to the area just before Lush opened and figured McTeague's would be my local watering hole.  I was soooo wrong.  Lush is everything you could want and more.  \n\nFirst and foremost, the drinks are delicious.  I had the lemon drop $5 happy hour drink.  Perfect mix of lemon sour and sugary sweet.  Next, I asked the bartender for a suggestion.  He made me a cucumber gimlet.  The most amazing delicious fabulous heavenly gimlet in the world.  It's actually my favorite drink.  But so many bartenders butcher it, I rarely order it.  The only place (prior to Lush) that I would even consider ordering one was at Le Colonial.  Well, now that's all I will ever drink again.   All the drinks are handmade, shaken, stirred and scrumptious.  My friend had a Manhattan and she said it was excellent.  They use fresh fruit, real cucumbers, etc.  It's swanky without the snobby.  Oh, the happy hour specials vary.  One day it's blueberry martinis, the next lemon drops.  So, you can easily find a reason to go, you haven't tried the new happy hour drink yet!\n\nSecond, the bartenders.  Not only are they nice to look at, but they are also ridiculously approachable and friendly.  I didn't feel rushed to figure out what I wanted next and they happily recommended drinks based on my tastes.  They are great at what they do.  We actually went through three bartenders (no judgment, it was a rough week).  All three were equally nice and good at their job, making good solid strong drinks.\n\nThird, the atmosphere/crowd.  My biggest issue with McTeague's are the pseudo wannabe ex-frat hipster folks.  I knew I was in trouble when a Britney song came on and the high pitched excited screams were not from a group of gay men.  Plus, really people, let the leggings and 'stache go.  It's sooo 2008.  Lush is the perfect mix and represents every reason I moved back to San Francisco.  You have hipsters, Irish dudes (cute ones too), lesbians, gays, straights, the random weird couple making out in the corner, and every other label I can't think of right now.  Everyone is friendly (except the weird couple, but eh, what can you do).  Each time I've gone, I've met people at the bar.  Just a good bar that draws a good group of people.\n\nFourth, the decor.  It's just light enough to see your friend or what's in your purse without holding it up to your face like your trying to eat something out of it.  But not so light to keep you from making a mistake by going home with someone that in the daylight, you might wonder what you were thinking.  The tables are set far apart and there's lot of options.  Tall tables, short small tables, tables for 6, a long table for 12 (or more), a nice long bar and a large upstairs for more private personal settings.  The jukebox plays good music and it's at a level where you can hear it, but you can also hear yourself think.  Plus, the have a FIREPLACE.  It's fabulous.  I warmed my hands and toosh and then headed out home.  \n\nFifth, the owner.  He's local (yay local small business owners) and I think I might have heard he also owns that great shop Leftovers (just down the street at Bush and Polk and then a large one on Sutter just down from Van Ness).  He was so nice and genuine, plus he said I have a great figure and his friends said I had porcelain skin.  Really, they had me at hello.  Compliments aside, he cares about this place and wants it to be successful.  It was refreshing to hear.  He's got my happy hour business for sure.\n\nOverall, this is a great bar for happy hour, first stop of the night or somewhere towards the end of your night.  They have a jukebox with great music, everything from Morrissey to Snow Patrol to Lou Reed.  The drinks are very well made and don't take 20 minutes like other places (orbit, bourbon, I'm talking to you).  The crowd is eclectic and friendly.  The decor is fun and cozy.  The owner is nice.  Really, would even want anything else in a bar?  I think not.\n\nNote: this place is cash only, but they have an atm machine in the bar.  The fee is $2 which isn't that bad since one of the convenient stores down the street charge like 3.25 or something ridic.", "author": "Emily G."}

One tranny in the entire bar, and I gave her a sympathy wink and smile.  A handful of aging queens, and the rest of the patrons were a bit too Marina for my taste.\n\nBut the cocktails still reign supreme.  And they are generous with the booze.  Shit wine (come on, step it up!) and some mediocre Australian faux champagne (come on, get something better!)   A few of the bar tenders were attitudinal and I'm not impressed (she says longing for the old queens from the old location)  The guy at the door was cool, yakked with him a bit, he's the apex of diplomacy which is so vital for a job like that.\n\nI wish the owner's presence & vibe could have been felt more.

We passed it the first time, assuming it wouldn't be so great judging from the dark, run-down feel of the outside. However, we noticed there was a constant flow of people wanting to go in, so we decided to give it a try. I think it was a bit early in the evening -- around 10? -- so there was ample seating upstairs. We scored the corner booth seat and grabbed a couple beers (mediocre variety to choose from) from downstairs. The music isn't so loud that we would have to yell to be able to hear each other yet just loud enough to give it the divey feel to mark it a good night. As the night progressed and each time we went downstairs to get more drinks from the bar, it was getting increasingly more (very much more) crowded.

The space is much bigger, with a second-floor loft, but the bar still retains some of the old location's wall kitsch, which is very good.

Instead of the old black and white films playing on the flatscreen, they were instead playing \"Saw.\"  This is definitely not your father's Lush Lounge.\n\nThe drink I ordered, a Bellini, was in a smaller glass instead of the tall champagne glass of old.

But the crowd isn't too obnoxious, which can't be said of some of the surrounding establishments.  \n\nWhile at Lush, You might see the owner's dog hanging around below the seats.   Cosmo's his name and he's a cutie!! \n\nIf you're in need of a good drink and  a venue with fun vibe, head on over Lush!  They just might make you blush with their drinks!!", "author": "Ka C."}

My friend ordered a mojito and I had a Grey Goose and tonic. Turns out that the vodka drink had little vodka and the mojito was sickeningly sweet and they had used coconut rum (apparently, their mojitos are their unique specialty).  My friend was really repulsed by the drink and went back up to the bar and politely asked if she could exchange the mojito for something else as it was too syrupy and the following unfolded:\r\n\r\nbartender: \"well, I can 'soda' it down for you\r\nfriend: I guess we could try that, but I'd really just like something else instead if possible.\r\nbartender: well, these are our specialty and I already made this one and put it in the computer.\r\nfriend: ok, can I just get a bailey's on the rocks then?\r\nbartender: ok, I will have to charge you full price for another drink though. Just throw me 4 dollars, they are usually 8.\"\r\n\r\nTo me, it seemed a bit petty for the bartender to have engaged in this whole exchange over a lousy drink.

Hence, when I saw Jill's invitation to lounge at Lush post movie, I decided to trek couple of blocks from Franklin and land up at Lush.\n\nOur experiences not only widen our capacity for forming mental associations, but also \"assimilates\" into our neural networks and deepen our intelligence.

So, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I immediately felt at home in their cozy, 'lush', comfortable atmosphere, and then after ordering a drink from the sweetie pie bartender, who was not only hot, but very nice (he let me change my mind 3 times after seeing him make other cocktails), humble and helpful, I had the distinct feeling that I had found a new favorite watering hole.  \r\n\r\nThey have a great list of specialty drinks, and you can even ask them to tweak them to your liking.  I don't like really sweet drinks,  and like to taste the tequilla in my Margaritas more than the sugar, so the bartender happily made my watermelon marg exactly how I wanted it....and it was REALLY good.  I moved on to my favorite drink, a basic Bombay Sapphire Martini, slightly dirty, and he made those perfectly as well.  I don't get that very often, so I was really pleased. \r\n\r\nWhat happened next could have turned a wonderful evening into a nightmare....my date returned from the bar to find his wallet missing.  Granted we were sitting at a table right next to the window in the TenderNob area and he left his wallet on the table (dumb), but we all have a lapse in judgment, and even moreso after 4 really stiff drinks.  \r\n\r\nEveryone around us, and I mean EVERYONE rallied together to try to find it...even ventured outside and did laps around the block hoping the thief had just taken the money and discarded the rest of the wallet in an alley.  But no luck...UNTIL the bartender overheard what was going on and said a neighboring bar had called and said if anyone was looking for a wallet, they had it.  How wonderful is that??!?!?!\r\n\r\n4 stars to excellent service, excellent drinks, and a really climactic end to an evening!!!  \r\n\r\nI would give 5 starts, but my incredibly hot date got more attention than I did as it seems to be more of a gay bar.

This Lush Lounge is no doubt someone's special place, but while it's a unique space on mid-Polk's bar scene, it lacks the intimacy and campy elegance of the old space.\n\nThis is sad for a lot of reasons, especially given its new, west-side of Polk orientation which protects it from the sun which used to turn the old place into a sauna.\n\nI have nothing negative to say about this place, it's just that it doesn't carry forward the magical, mystical place I used to love across the street.  Oh well. Maybe there will be some other special place, but it better hurry up or I'll be taking my gin through tubes and needles.", "author": "Paul T."}

Absinthe is about the only place I've had a good Sazerac.\n\nWell, they got it pretty correct here.  Decent Rye whiskey (Rittenhouse?).  A touch of anis liqueur.  Peychaud bitters (critical - as the hint of anis is very important to the flavor profile and develops further with the addition of Peychaud).  Touch of sugar.    Lemon twist (oils into the glass and rub the rim).\n\nOur bartender also made sure to stir (and not shake), which is also important.\n\nThen ... the only mistake in my mind.  A martini glass was used.  It needs to be a tumbler glass.  But all was forgiven as the drink turned out fine.\n\nRecommended.  Good atmosphere.  Spacious.  Low key crowd.  Fireplace.

I think it's a prerequisite for bars in the city to play the weirdest movies. Lush is no exception. While we were waiting for our friends to arrive, they were playing some pornographic foreign films with some added violence for good measure. Needless to say, it provided material for some interesting conversation. We didn't try any of the drinks but they did look good and they seemed reasonably priced. If you're a single guy, this would be a good place for you. We noticed the ratio of male to female was pretty unbalanced. They play decent music here too which is always a plus. Parking in the area is pretty tricky but it's definitely not a bad place to meet a few friends and enjoy some conversation.

A close second is some Chocotini which they shave a Hersheys bar to garnish the top. This place actually makes these drinks taste as good as they try to make them look. Because of them 2 years ago, I can now appreciate \"bitch drinks\".\n\nBUT you must get the right bartender, or they WILL taste like crap!

There was a black and white movie (starring Marilyn Monroe) playing at the time, and interesting 80's music in the background, with a tiny disco ball shining towards the restroom.

I'm not of that tribe, but I like bars that are frequented by gay and straight alike. It tends to keep away the macho jerks with environment-killing transport/\"high-class\" hoochies in search of said jerks. It's very mixed in all senses--hipsters (which I might be mistaken for sometimes), people in definite dress-down mode, fashionistas, etc.\n\n3) The Cable Car. I'm talking about the drink, folks. It was invented in San Francisco and is a little sweeter than drinks I usually go for but it's awesome.\n\n4) Nice bartenders. Always friendly, always good pours. \n\n5) There's good music but this is also a nice place to chat, sit at the window and people watch, whatever.

It's just a fun place!  \nHowever, and this is a fair warning to ya'll: if you see me slipping off my chair because I'm so drunk, and I start hitting on you, just tell me to piss off.

It resulted in this fabulous cantalope, pear, lime, amazingness. We were going to name it. But it didn't really happen. But he said anytime I or anyone else wants it, just ask for the Cantalope Martini with Pear Vodka. So there you go.

Dear Kinski, please don't rely on the vocals to carry any of your tunes. The charm of Kinski is not the front man. I know that statement makes me somewhat of an asshole, but what makes Kinski's music special is the strength of the music (Edge Set, Wives of Artie Shaw, The Party Which You Know Will Be Heavy, etc.) Really, take the lyrics out of Newport and there's absolutely NO degradation there. Alpine Static remains the standard bearer.\n\nLush seems to suffer the other extreme. The lynch pin here is the bartender(s). Lush has the ability to be a cool place to have a drink or two (or four). However, a poor bartender here (and I realize that \"poor\" is subjective in this biz) sucks all the joy out of stopping here, especially since this is a mixed club (homo/trans/hetero).

The key lime martini was super sweet and syrupy, not tart at all like I was hoping for. The blueberry martini was better but didn't really taste like blueberries... I should remember this each time I go in and order beer instead, but the martini menu is just so alluring. I bet I'll find a good one sooner or later... I do want to try to jalapeno-infused tequila.\n\nThe crowd seems to change a lot. I've seen everything from uber-drunken women in their 30s draping themselves all over men at the bar to bikers chillin' with buddies to \"normal\" peole just hanging out.\n\nI like the vibe in there... reddish lighting, dark wood, and old-fashioned bar decorations. One of these old-fashioned decorations is a cigarette ad with a woman that looks a lot like my mom... even more so after a few drinks. Weird.\n\nIt's definitely an added plus that you can order dinner or snacks from Hank's across the street and eat them at the bar. They even make it easy by having menus all over the place.

Kind of small but its usually not hard to get seats when people leave. ATM inside. Two bathrooms, one of which is Mens only. \n\nOnly real bummer is the excessive amount of bums that bother you when you go out to smoke. Personally I find an enjoyment of interacting with bums after a bunch of drinks, but one time some crazy tried to rob me and my friends...with some nail scissors. Too bad he didn't realize there was a cop standing 5 ft. away, who batted the scissors out of his hand and frisked him and told him to get lost. \n\nBut the corner of Post & Polk offers a variety of interesting characters, namely the trannies. Last time i was at the Lush I witnessed a great fight between the bartender and a tranny, who claimed that she was ripped off by the bartender. Not so much a fight as he just did his best to take the punches while pushing her out and locking her out until the cops got there. But hey, its the Tenderloin!

Of all the bars on the strip, Lush caught our eyes with its funky outside decor and frozen martini signs. Lush is small, but cozy and comfy. The decorating is excellent - black and white photos adorn the walls, and a silent film plays on the screen at top. The music was pretty nice, too -a little retro but definitley refreshing amidst the ever popular \"club beatz\" down the street. \n\nIt was pretty dead inside. A few regular- types, and an old man that talked our ears off about his gambling addiction and close ties with Madonna, Jack Nicholson, etc. (I'm still wondering how much of that was BS). He was eventually what got us out of the place, but we probably would have stayed. The drinks were good. Not amazing, but good. We ordered some cosmos and then some sort of vodka/lemon shot. As the bartender explained, it literally was lemons soaking in vodka. Next time, I'd like to try some of their specialty drinks. \n\nThe best part about this place was its non-threatening atmosphere. The two waiters - Chris and Jake (yes we got their names!)  - were so friendly and sweet. After we went to this bar down the street and a chick fight broke out (broken beer bottles, blood), we came back to Lush for some end-of-night comfort after the chaos. The bartenders were sweet and offered us water.\n\nI give this place an A- for its friendly and warm atmosphere.", "author": "Claudia C."}

It's your average Polk St. bar, if larger and with a more memorable restroom arrangement (the sinks are pretty cool, though I wish they had more wc's being such a large place). For whatever reason, it always ends up being the last place I go to during a (unexpected or otherwise) crawl, so my memory of it may be somewhat impaired, but in general I think it's just one of those places that always seems sufficiently crowded to get you (or keep you...) in the party mood, yet roomy enough that it's not suffocating. It's a tad exhausting though, which may be why it's always the last stop. Eh, I have mixed feelings.

The old lush lounge was one of my favorite bars in the city: it was cozy, had great, unique decor and the drinks were amazing. Best of all, you never knew who would walk through the door next: some queers from the Tendernob, some sketchy characters from the TL, some trans gals hopping over from Divas, or chill Russian Hill residents looking for a change of pace.\n\nThe new Lush Lounge is bigger, and the decor is nice, I'll give it that. but it's also completely faceless - no personality, nothing worth noting. Where once offbeat movies and weird pornos played on the screens, now you find sports games. The eccentric characters have been replaced by Marina clones and faux-hipsters.

They didn't have a cover on new years and it was a pretty good place to be. There are plenty of places to stand around and rest your drink...and some good lighting.

We sat at the bar and ordered the evening's drink special...the tangerine cosmopolitan...for $5...can you say cheap AND YUMMY?...the drink, that is...not my date...he is anything but cheap : )  We shared one lemon drop shot...$3...I'm a lightweight, so I could only tolerate one sip...I'm relatively certain that it killed any and all bacteria in my mouth, and possibly took one layer of tissue off the lining of my esophagus when I swallowed...my face contorting.  My crush is a drinker, and even he thought it was strong.  I would recommend ordering one if you...say...had something offensive for dinner...it's sort of like Listerine on steroids.\n\nThe bartender had the sort of personality that every bartender should have...gregarious and effortlessly charming...quick with a witty and poignant observation...attentive to our needs but never intrusive.\n\nIf you are so inclined, a hetero couple could use one bathroom at the same time, as they are unisex...each with a urinal and toilet.  I see this as a time saving device on a busier, crowded night.  They were also clean, which is a MAJOR bonus in my book.  \n\nI honestly can't remember one song that was playing last night.  Whatever it was, it never annoyed me.  I was too busy gazing into my crush's beautiful, sexy blue eyes and hanging on his every word.  The music was at a level where we could easily talk and listen to one another, which is nice.  Never once did either of us have to ask the other to repeat what was said.  This makes Lush Lounge a nice place to hang out and converse...and canoodle...and drink.\n\nAs we were leaving, the bartender thanked us for coming in and invited us back.  I would definitely go back again~", "author": "s r."}

It's such a nice and cozy lounge serving great cocktails with reasonable price and great service always... though... I've experienced a few uncomfortable mishaps recently here. First one was about an apprentice bartender.  Every time when he took order that evening, he just couldn't find where the booze bottles were. Contrary to the customer's extreme patience, his excuse was like \"Oh, come on. This is my first day. Give me a break!\"  Ugh...ouch. I know he shouldn't have been there alone in the first place, but his attitude evidently lacks grace to work for my beloved classy martini bar. Second was about music. One day my folks and I went there for a couple of pre-dinner cocktails. As soon as we opened the gate, a loud noise struck our ears. This bartender was playing his kind of music all the time when he's on duty. I assume he thinks it's his privilege to play his favorites. I endure this ear-deafning music only when the bar becomes like a meat market on the late-night weekend, but not on weekdays especially after a long, long day.  Anyways, a bartender as a soothing ambiance creator should thoughtfully select tunes to allow us to relax, get a good buzz on and enjoy conversation. Then again, this bartender is one of the rookies. I hope those newcomers soon become able to carry on tradition of THE LUSH LOUNGE. Then, I'll be happy to give five stars.", "author": "Kaulike Y."}

If you are an utter nutter like me, you get lemon drops on the house and they remember you so that you can cash in on free drinks the next time.  Some call this place a \"chick bar,\" but those guys are just mad jealous by the musculature on the bartenders.  True, they also are good at making so-called \"chick drinks,\" like blueberry martinis, cosmos, strawberry daiquiris, etc.  But, come on, almost anything with blueberry--feminine or not--is tasty.  I have had the lemon drops, and delicate name, notwithstanding, those little suckers can pack a wallop.  They treat me well here, so I am a little bit torn on the rating, but the place just does not have the draw for me that it used to.

I guess you can say I'm a regular (anyone who can walk into a bar and be told \"oh no here comes trouble\" while they hastily make a drink for you is a regular). The bartenders are fabulous in every sense of the word. Last  time I went there on a crappy date (we're talking a HORRIBLE date but I do digress) one of the bartenders conspired with me and he sweetly asked said date to leave. As soon as tacky boy left I got a sympathy drink on the house. Love it! Another great story involves my friend Kat. She and I were there getting our drink on one busy Saturday night when she had to use the bathroom. She went and came running back out. She called to Rami (the bartender on duty) and explained there was no TP. He stopped what he was doing to dash downstairs and bring her a fresh roll apologizing for the inconvience. How do you not love it when your bartender cares? The bloody Mary is tomato juice with the produce aisle attached to it. Anything out of their little \"black book\" of drinks is usually reasonably priced and tasty! It's a place with no pretenses; you can usually have a bar buddy within a few minutes of coming in (even if you came by yourself) and have at least one satisfying conversation. People watching here is great! The movies and music playing are usually stuff you like anyway (and fun to zone out to). All in all if you find yourself near Post and Polk do go.", "author": "Veronica G."}

This is my neighborhood bar, but I am not giving it 5 stars for convenience or even the strong drinks.... Bartenders are not only extremely talented at mixing drinks, but incredibly friendly, professional, funny, and attentive- oh and tolerant. This is the only bar I order mixed drinks at, typically I'm a bourbon on the rocks kind of girl- however like I mentioned earlier they are that dang good. They are also great at maintaining a non-riffraffyrowdy bar. The only negative thing is that since they are so damn good, I find myself here on a nearly daily basis. BTW their happy hour starts earlier than any other bar on the block- 3PM! Steve the owner is a amazing host and adds a personal touch and has amazing taste in bartenders. Svetlana (butchered your name- sorry) works on Monday and Friday Happy Hours, and Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings is skilled, quick, makes delish delish concoctions and is quick &amp; witty. Jack is the latest addition to the Lush family and recently declared the favorite aside from Svetlana works Happy Hours on Saturday, Sunday and evenings on Friday and Monday. He is an uber-amazing-mixologist. But honestly anytime you decide to go you will be served by a very attentive and professional staff.", "author": "Gracie A."}

Located at the edge of the TL, LL provides a slight haven from the sketchiness that surrounds it. Small, dark, and extremely crowded, LL seems to be a happening spot filled with Marinaites and fresh out of college type kids. After reading yelp reviews, I had higher expectations for the drinks. Yes, the portions were enormous and decently priced, but quantity does not always equal quality. The selection was okay, pretty standard in my opinion but nothing very unique or exciting (not to mention the bartender was not particularly helpful or knowledgable about mixed drinks). I went for the most creative concoction on the menu, which turned out to be a ginormous margerita laced with cactus berry liqueur and garnished with blueberries, marachino cherries, and citrus wedges. The drink was served in a large rimmed sugar coated glass and was the object of everyone's attention for the first few minutes. As I struggled to make my way across the bar with my drink to catch my friends, about three girls stopped me and asked what kind of drink I had- apparently people were envious. Apparently no one was brave enough to venture out from their lemon drop bubble to sample something a bit more unique (seriously folks, how crazy is cactus flower syrup) as most people there seem to stick to the very basic cocktails. And the drink itself? Not bad, pretty sweet, pretty strong, but nothing to write home about with the exception that about a third of it made me pretty damn drunk and I had to give away the rest to my eager friends.", "author": "Kate A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-02-02", "description": "Never had probs here simply because I am straight, as other reviewers have mentioned...? This is the bar I always end up at after racking my brain trying to think of a new bar to try...simply because I think it is good to try new places. Well, I guess with an old standby like the Lush Lounge I don't have to try the newest or hippest places. This place is kind of a throwback, a mish-mash of eras in one space and there is always 80s music playing. The cocktails are froofy and fun, so who cares if they are not super sophisticated? They always seem to have a drink special. Last time I was there there were Lemon Drops all night for $5. I like the Cactus Berry Margarita becasue they give you this big honkin fruit stick thing with it. Yum. The crowd is a mix, which I like, and is always pretty laid-back and friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-29", "description": "Quite simply these are the best mixed drinks in town and at the best prices.  The martinis are simply to die for and come in over 1000 varieties (French is always a good one).  The bartenders are tons of fun and very friendly.  The decor is festive and unique.  It would be great if they served food (something to cushion all the booze instead of just popcorn).  For some reason you can never go into Lush Lounge for just a drink or two or three - somehow it always ends up being 7 or 8 or so.  They're the sorts of drinks that are super smooth and you don't really notice the alcohol...until it knocks you on your ass an hour or so later.  I would also love the bar more if there was more than one (unisex) bathroom.  It's a small bar with a decent crowd so it generally isn't good for more than 4 people although it's best for 2 people.
