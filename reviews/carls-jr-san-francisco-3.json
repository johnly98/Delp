I can understand maybe a movie theater charging prices if something like this was inside the theater but it was a regular area and can't help to think it takes advantage of tourists in the area looking for a quick affordable bite to eat.\n\nThe place also looks suspect and there were security guards there, saw many sketchy people hang out there. Just does not feel safe to be honest. But the guard that worked there and the person who took my order were nice at least. But I think I'll eat something at home before searching for options like Carl's Jr in this area again.", "author": "Jason C."}

I mean sub standard service is to be expected of a fast food restaurant but, basic human respect should never be compromised. The security guard at this location HUMILIATED ME in front of the entire restaurant. After paying for and eating my meal, I asked to be \"buzzed in\" to the restroom which is for customers only. After eating burgers and fries it is normal to have to relieve yourself. While I was in the restroom I was bombarded with unnecessary banging on the door from who I recognized to be the voice of the security guard. She the proceeded to ask me what I was doing to which I responded \"using the restroom.\" She told me I needed to be out so that others could use it. Mind you, this is the only co-ed stall in an open floor plan restaurant! I told her I would be out when I was finished. She then preceded to tell other guest just outside the restroom that I was \"doing something I didn't have any business\" insinuating that I was doing drugs or some type of illegal or inappropriate activity. After arguing with me through the door for several moments, to which I just continually repeated I will be out when I am finished. Once I exited the restroom I was met with a handful of stares from all the guests who had witnessed this embarrassing experience. I went to the counter to demand to speak with the manger. At first the manager on duty lied and said she wasn't the manger, then I said \"I work in restaurants I know there is a manger in duty\" which caused her to be truthful and take some ownership. After I asked her to speak with the guard I exited the building to find the guard on the phone with the police trying to get me arrested for using the bathroom too long! When she saw me exit she disconnected the call and went back in to further humiliate me by talking about the incident with other guests! I know because the door was slightly ajar and I could HEAR HER. I went back into the restaurant to ask the for the general managers name, the cashier didn't even bother to turn around and speak to me he spoke with his back to me. He told me the guards name was Tanisha and the managers name was Molly. As I asked for this information the guard mocked and taunted me saying thugs like \"you want the 800 number\" showing zero remorse or respect. She kept saying \"I love my job.\" This is the customer service industry in San Francisco! I pay too much in rent to be treated like trash at a place where I come to eat! Tanisha should be fired and the staff should be re trained. Even as a manger in the customer service industry, not even m worst employees have ever treated any of my guests with such arrogance. The entire altercation could be heard by all the guests. I was made to look like I had done something wrong for no reason what so ever. I will be contacting corporate.", "author": "Que A."}

In the city, fast food finds reservation for the bummy and slightly smelly. It's the sad perpetuation of a vicious cycle - with so much relatively cheap, good food in SF, why would the rational man, with the extra dollar, suffer fast food? And so the quality goes down the crapper (along with the rest of your night's intake), and Carl's Jr. succeeds in doing what Christian Bale may or may not have done: slowly kill hobos.\n\nSo, I go for a run, and I notice the Clay plans on playing that same film tonight at midnight.

Plus I always get harrassed by the homeless on my (short) walk over- not that is Carl Junior's fault but it still irks me.", "author": "Jessica R."}

I had donated earlier for the troops at one of their other locations so I had some coupons which were valid. The supervisor name \"PIA\" a phillipeno girl was very rude. She did not bothered to even look at the coupon and she said \"this coupon is not valid\" I told her this is valid unto the end of next month please see that. Then she said only one coupon at a time. I said where it is written. She don't even showed me and told rudely to be on side. She gave me that discrematory look. when I asked her to talk to her manager, she said I have to talk to her only. I can't believe Carls Jr. Can keep such kind of supervisor, this shows there hiring system.", "author": "Nick F."}

During the day, this Carl's Jr caters to the wage slaves in the Civic Center plaza. Once 5 o'clock rolls around, you can't help but notice the influx of homeless people around the restaurant. Every once in a while, someone will come in to try to buy a 99 cent Big Burger and use the restroom. Depending on who has night manager duty, people might come in with empty plastic cups to fill up at the beverage bar. They usually have a security guard there at night, and for good reason. Some of the patrons can get aggressive with the counter staff and other diners.\n\nSo why go there at night? Well, those spicy chicken sandwiches can be addictive, and the place is open 24/7. When I went to Hastings nearby, I'd grab a bite to eat while studying and tell myself that if I didn't do well, I'd wind up being the night manager here. Yes, sometimes negative reinforcement works.", "author": "Timothy O."}

We go out and about to search for some food and come across Carl Jr's...ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS FOOD! OMG if you go with a group of people have everyone get a different burger and just try each other's. We got the Guacamole Burger, Teriyaki Burger, Mushroom Burger, and Chili Cheese Fries. So Amazing every single Burger and Fries.

Heading towards BART Carl's Jr. sounded pretty good.  The four of us girls got in line, two of us headed to the bathroom door which displayed a typed 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper that implied that bathrooms are only Coustomers only.  OMG.  The unnecessary \"O\" was scribbled out.  Man, I forgot to take a photo of that.  When the two girls stood outside the bathroom the security guard in a sweatshirt and jeans, playing random songs on his cell phone so everyone can hear said you have to buy something before using the bathroom.  O------Kaaaayyyyy.  Sure.  The girls got back in line with us.  We bought our Fried Zucchini and Criss Cut Fries and were allowed to finally-finally use the bathroom.  AND!  I needed more 'house dressing'. I stood at the counter waiting for the cashier around the corner.  He did, but was in the middle of blowing his nose.  He finished, wiped the rest of the wetness with his hands roughly and quickly and I was utterly disgusted.  \n\nNote to self - no more visits to fast food joints that have security.  \n\nNote #2 to self - Never come here again.\n\nAwe, man!

I've never really had any issues with the food quality as it seems fine and pretty much consistent with other Carls Jrs I visit. Yes, the ambience is not the greatest but considering that it is right on the edge of the Tenderloin, what can you expect? Vagrants and users abound here and I can imagine that this would not make for ideal working conditions, but I really gotta say that the level of service provided by the employees really SUCKS ass. One girl in particular named Cristobel is hands down one of the rudest people I've ever seen working in the service industry. You come in and greet her and all she does is stand there giving you a dirty look!! The employees must be so used to having to deal with troublemakers that they just automatically treat everyone the same. Total disrespect!!", "author": "Lou E."}

Succumbing to Carl's Jr.'s incessant marketing of their portobello mushroom burger during Giants broadcasts, I went in today and got one with an order of fries.  I must say it was quite tasty indeed.  The lettuce and tomato inside the burg were fresh, the portobello slices were plentiful, the fries were done just right, and it all even held up well after a 15 minute drive home.  And the counter service was fast.  Maybe it's just that the street people outside don't bother me like other reviewers, or that I got my food to go instead of watching the neighborhood go by, but it was sure A-OK by me.", "author": "moosedog i."}

I also love their Six Dollar Burgers are huge burgers fit for a king. It's also great when I have my meal sitting at the windows so I can watch the world go by as interesting people go about their shopping. Their maybe a few panhandlers outside of the store, but they usually don't cause much trouble. Not only does this place take Credit Cards and is open 24 Hours, the beautiful actress Audrina Patridge in her golden bikini lying on the beach eating a Carl's Jr burger promotes this place--you may even catch a glimpse of her Carls Jr t.v. commercial on the television screens they have in the store.", "author": "Robert T."}
