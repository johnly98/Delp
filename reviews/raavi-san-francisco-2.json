This isn't really that filling. I would order one the kebabs, and plain rice to get filled up. \n\nIf you're not eating by yourself, just add a curry for each additional person. I usually order a Chicken Tikka Kebab, Chicken Daal(Lentil), or any of the vindaloos(spicy oil). Potato(Alu) flat bread is the most filling choice to accompany curry and rice always filled bellies. \n\nIf you're a masochist that just like suffering from scoville burns, make sure to say \"very spicy please\"(add another very for an additional level) when ordering.\n\nI usually get food to go but when I do eat there, it *feels* like India(like, they played Tunak Tunak Tun-type songs).\n\nI've been coming here for more than two years and they've been pestering me for a review on yelp so here it is.

Raavi is one of the few Indian places within the area and I haven't had biryani for a long time, so I was tempted to go for that. I looked through the biryanis, and decided to get the lamb biryani, although I was also drawn to the vegetable biryani as well.\n\nThis place is pretty close to a self-serve establishment, and you're expected to get your own utensils and water in the back. A couple minutes after I ordered, my lamb biryani came, and I dug in. The lamb biryani was pretty wet, and the spices were overpowering in a good way. I took my time, savoring every bite, taking in the spices. At the end, I was feeling pretty full, and very satiated.\n\nRaavi left a very positive impression on me, and I would definitely come back here again to sample the other biryani dishes. Definitely the veggie biryani for sure, and then some. Solid four star place and highly recommended to others who are craving Indian.", "author": "Nelson X."}

Overall, a solid, no-frills sort of spot.\n\nThe lamb korma was a thinner sort of curry, with very solid pieces of lamb if that's your thing (I'm into more of the chewy lamb / goat, but that's just preference). Not quite as spiced as some other spots. The rice portion was pretty generous.\n\nThe butter chicken was tender and creamy. The naan (carbs come separate) was pretty fresh, though a bit oily.\n\nTheir mango lassi was pretty standard, and they also have free chai. I saw their rose lassi after I ordered-- gonna check that out next time!\n\n--\n\nEdit: I came back for the fish curry and potato naan. There was a decent amount of fish in the curry, and it had been left intact so you could cut it up into pieces, or keep it whole depending on what you prefer. The consistency was a thinner sort of curry, like the lamb korma I had. Heat-wise, it didn't feel super spicy upon first bite, but left your mouth hot during the meal. \n\nThe potato naan was a bit thin on the potato filling, but overall large portion size.

Our delivery order arrived via Caviar a little past 11:30am.\n\n*Samosa: Two pieces, Deep fried pastry shells, stuffed with potatoes and peas ($4)\n*Tikka Masala: Chicken cooked in a tomato based curry ($9)\n*Stuffed Naan ($2 each): Onion Naan, Garlic Naan (+$0.50)\n\nAt work, we have a $20 limit for lunch. Price wise, Raavi was great as I was able to place my usual delivery order. (It's over $20 most of the time.) I noted the curry should be extra spicy and they listened. It had a nice heat. Both naan were soft with a nice chew. Though I did think both could have used more garlic and onion. The samosas were crispy and the filling soft. I did wish the mint chutney was more flavorful to add a contrast. It wasn't very minty. Also, there wasn't much of it.\n\nDefinitely a comforting meal. And all for $17.50.

With so many (cheaper) options close by, not sure if i'll come back.\n\nHeard great reviews by friends who came for lunch so decided to try it for dinner.  A bit pricey for the quality.  Everything is good, not great, and some dishes are a bit too salty.  For similar pricing, Shalimar is much much better. \n\nSome of the ingredients are not the freshest... and easily disguised by the curry and spices.  \n\nFor example, We had a party of 3 and ordered the following;\n- Chicken Tikka Masala.  just ok.  not too flavorful and chicken pieces were not tender as I had hoped.  Usage of spices were ok.  There were flavors but mainly tasted salty and lacked the fragrant of the masala sauce.  Typically this is my favorite dish so i was a bit disappointed.\n-  Lamb Saag.  The lamb saag were too salty, but not unbearable heart attack salty so we stuck with the dish.  Lamb pieces were either over cooked and dry or just old and reheated; again - chewy.\n- Okra Curry -  okras were old and stringy.  We couldn't chew it through.  I wouldn't recommend this dish.\n- Tandoor chicken leg.  This is a typical dish to me and a safe dish.  This one does not disappoint and turns out to be the best dish of the evening.  \n- Basmati rice plain.  Just ok.  How can rice be ok you may ask?  Well, the rice is dry and just dry to the bone.  Which could indicate its old.  Fresh quality basmati rice has a dry texture and a slight chew and fragrant to it.  Their rice lacks the fragrant of a freshly cooked rice nor the slight moisture in rice pieces.  This indicates =\nold, reheated rice.  \n- Mango Lassi.  At $3.50 a pop, this is ok.  A tad too sweet for my taste but i'm sure it's fine for others.  Flavorful mango lassi.  \n\n\nFood is 2-3 stars.  Service is quick and friendly.  Overall 3 stars for me.", "author": "Winnie W."}

We typically prefer Indian buffets but Raavi did not have that option. When we first walked into this self service restaurant, we noticed that the room was a bit stuffy. At first, I found that it was a little hard to breathe, although I eventually got used to it. This place did look like a hole in the wall. The lighting was a little dim. Not all of the lights were turned on. In terms of cleanliness, the place was not too clean or dirty. \n\nWe ended up splitting the Butter Chicken ($10.50), Aloo Palak ($8), and two sides of Plain Basmati Rice ($2 each). The portion sizes were decent for its price. In fact, we could barely finish the whole thing! However, both meals tasted a little artificial. \n\nButter Chicken: I have bought canned Butter Chicken (Maya Kaimal Indian Simmer Sauce, Butter Masala) from the grocery store. I found that the restaurant sauce reminded me of this canned sauce in terms of taste. It was not very moist. \n\nAloo Palak: This dish was super hot (temperature wise)! The spinach part of the dish tasted differently from what I imagined. It was thicker than I expected. The sauce was not very liquidy. I did like the potatoes though! They were not too soft. \n\nPlain Basmati: The rice was a little bit dry, but we got huge portions! \n\nIt was nice to see the pictures of some of the meals on the wall. The Butter Chicken that we ordered looked different from the image on the wall; our dish was much lighter and looked nicer, :p. \n\nThe employees placed the food on the table, but we were expected to pick up our own utensils. There were water cups near the side of the cashier register. At first, I thought that there was no ice since I just saw a large container of water. When I poured water into the cup, I was surprised to find the water to be cold!\n\nThe place smelled strong and our clothes smelled like Indian food after we left.

Unfortunately I had just walked in when 8 diners had left and the staffing is so minimal, it was a big messy table in the middle of the tiny eatery. In fact we almost didn't eat there. After a little internet research we learned people really had enjoyed the food. It is simply bare bones self service which allows you a great price. So if you enjoy Indian Food, it's worth your investigation. They don't moderate the heat levels for delicate palates-so if spicy hot isn't something you can manage- grab a side of raita. Great food at a Great price. Try it out.", "author": "Paul Andrew C."}

The Chicken Vindaloo was worth the hike through the sketchy Stockton bridge and the busy, colorful streets of Chinatown. Just the right amount of spiciness was cut down by basmati rice and simple naan bread. By the end of the meal, the heat of the Vindaloo sauce did not scald my mouth but, instead, lingered pleasantly on my lips :) \n\nThe chai - if you order some - is hot, unsweetened spiced tea and only costs $1, although they claim it's \"complimentary\" before telling you the price which I found oddly endearing. It's self-serve so, that's nice as you can have as much as you'd like for the $1 you paid. Also self-serve is the water which is convenient if you can't handle your spice!\n\nSpeaking of self-serving, this is a no-nonsense place regarding service. You order and pay at the counter, get your own place setting and drinks and the servers simply bring your order to your chosen table when it's ready. For my part, I love hole-in-the-wall joints like this. No hovering servers but you never feel neglected either. When I needed a to-go container for my leftovers, the guys working the place were more than happy to oblige. If you're looking for a full-service restaurant, Raavi isn't for you but, if you're more independent, it'll do you just fine. \n\nIf you're up for a stimulating walk through Chinatown or the down Kearny from the Financial District and in the mood for Indian food, I recommend stopping for lunch at Raavi. You won't be disappointed but, if you are, maybe try not to be so picky in life, hmm? Laugh, live, lunch!", "author": "Summer D."}

Hmmmm.\n\nI entered and walked to the back of the restaurant where I approached the cashier (who I believe was also the owner) standing under a \"SELF SERVICE\" sign. I said, \"This is my first time here.\" He assumed I meant it was my first time eating Indian food (not even close), and pointed to the Chicken Tikka Masala. Explaining what it was, followed by, \"It's a popular dish, and yummy.\" So, one order of \"yummy\" it was.\n\nOne thing I found slightly disconcerting is that the food got to my table before I did. Am I the only one who finds that to be scary? I mean...was it originally meant for someone else? Probably... it was pretty cold. I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Plain Naan Bread, and Basmati Rice. My total was $10.88 after tax and before tip (Note: A minimum purchase of $10 is required if you wish to use a credit/debit card).\n\nBased on the previous indications, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, so it stands to reason that Raavi \"met\" my expectations. The Masala sauce was the right consistency, but a bit too citrus-y. I expected more of a tomato, curry and spice flavor. It was seriously lacking in curry and spice. It tasted more like blended tomatoes, yogurt and lemon juice. The food was only warm, not hot. I like my Chicken Tikka Masala to be steaming hot. The chicken cubes were tender and not over-cooked like I was expecting in a stew-syle dish, which was the one and only pleasant surprise in my experience. The food was obviously made in bulk and not kept warm enough. The Naan was light, fluffy and soft like one would expect. The Basmati Rice was cooked perfectly, but again - cold. \n\nHowever, the place was pretty busy for lunch and there were no free tables, which leads me to believe that 1) People don't mind fighting a door for DIY lunch; and 2) There are actually no real spectacular Indian restaurants near the SF Financial District. This place and the two Indian food trucks that roam California St & Bush St are about as good as it gets? *Sigh* \n\nAside from my food and experience being just ok, the guy across from me kept blowing his nose like he was in a foghorn imitation contest. (You win, Jackass, now take your no-manners-having-faux-hawk-topped melon somewhere else and blow whatever you want.) Gross. Some people are so uncouth. I lost my appetite and left before I finished my food, but by that point, it was practically ice-cold anyway. Even though the owner was very friendly, and the food wasn't horrible, I probably won't be back.", "author": "Heather A."}

It was very difficult giving this place a 3 because the food is out of this world, but they didn't take my Groupon without an explanation. They also seemed to take awhile to open and set up the restaurant, causing us to wait outside for awhile. \n\nMy friends and I had an amazing family style meal for lunch. We got samosas, mango lassi, garlic naan, fish karahi, chicken and lamb biriyani, bindi gosht, saag paneer, and tea. Every item was delicious. My favorite dish though was the fish karahi, which was very flavorful, juicy, and spicy, and the naan, which was also flavorful, warm, and soft. The 6 of us ate very, very well and had some leftovers. I was so full, I didn't eat anything for the rest of the day. \n\nYou get tea with your meal, and it is a nice thing to finish your meal off with. The place is clean, simple, and casual. You are responsible for setting your own table with dishes, water, etc. As other reviewers have mentioned, this place isn't fancy but is just another casual Desi place. I am glad I got to try this place it is very popular among a lot of my friends, especially those who work nearby. \n\nI'll eventually get over my Groupon heartbreak, but I still am very disappointed in them for not sticking to their commitments. Another note, some of the workers don't get the tips you leave. I have friends who have been going for awhile, and they recommend leaving some of the tip on the table because the owners/management take the tips and won't give it to some of the other wait staff.

But don't let the looks of this place fool you: the decor is hole-in-wall, but the food is absolutely luxuriously flavored. The fish melted in my mouth, served with crisp fresh tomatoes and onions on the side that wafted in a complex dance into my nostrils. The Chicken ghobi (with cauliflower), and a side of yellow lentil rich in interplay of raw, roasted and simmered spices that  stood on their own. And the heaping plate of vegetable biryani, enough to feed a family of 5, worked so well you'd think the rice and vegetables grew up together and immigrated to America just to open a restaurant. It gave the meal a foundation that built on the best of indian and Pakistani kitchens. Eat here if you're serious about great, honest south Asian food.", "author": "David F."}

I stopped eating immediately, pretended I was full, and just hoped my guests didn't notice the cockroach climbing up the wall behind them. To no avail however, one of them did notice and was keeping it quiet just like I was. I couldn't sleep just thinking about how the food I ate over dinner was likely infested with cockroach feces and lord knows what else. The bathroom, which is down a flight of stairs, is unlike any other. Horrifying gross. And the smell is unlike any other. If anyone here on yelp has ever been to a refuge camp in the middle east, the bathroom at Raavi is exactly the same... which is pretty crazy to see here in U.S...but maybe my shock could be attributed to the fact that I'm not a native city dweller.\n\nAnyway, never coming back here due to the roach and the bathroom.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-05", "description": "We were craving Indian last night and this popped up on our search for the area and since it had a decent star rating we figured we'd check it out. The entrance is a bit hard to locate initially, it's kind of squashed between other businesses around it and the front is pretty nondescript and the restaurant inside is small, but it's worth looking for if you're leaning in the Indian direction and are around Little Italy.\n\nThere's two seating areas, one in the front and one in the back that's a little more secluded. We chose to sit in the back area since there were a few families up front and a lot of noise and we wanted a bit of quiet. You order and pay at the cashier in the back and they'll bring your food out. You have to serve yourself your own water from the fridge where they keep the pop and other drinks, but they brought my mango lassi out to me within a minute of us ordering and sitting down.\n\nThat's one big thing going with for here... the service is *fast*. We ordered a paneer and chicken tikka masala, a rice and a garlic naan, plus my mango lassi. I think we had all our food out within 5 minutes of sitting down. It was hot and fresh.\n\nPortion sizes are a bit on the small side, in my opinion. Then again, I did eat everything in front of me and wasn't hungry in the least. The price is also quite excellent ($21.00 for the two of us). \n\nWe both enjoyed our tikka masalas and the mango lassi is probably the second best I've had in the city, but the garlic naan was mind-blowing. Hot and covered in large chunks of garlic, it came out as an uncut slab and was very much the winner of the evening. I went through that far faster than rice with my curry. I would have been completely happy ordering two naans instead of one and a rice.\n\nDefinitely a good Indian food option if you're looking for fast and well priced.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

I go here at least once per week if not more and seriously get the same exact order every single time: Paneer Tikka Masala, side order of rice, and naan.  Some of their food is a bit spicy but they can usually make it not spicy.\n\nMy reasons for dinging it are that it isn't particularly nice (the restaurant); in fact, it is a bit grungey.  The cashier(owner?) is nice though and they seem to have a very hard working staff.

The chicken biryani, achaar, and vindaloo are all delicious. The food is always quick enough, tasty, and the free chai makes dining in a joy (though I usually go after the busy lunch hour).\n\nThe caveat:\nThere are also several dishes on the menu which are clearly designed for tourists that would think a pepperoni is too spicy, and the tikka masala is one of them. I guess ordering that dish here is like ordering lemon chicken at a Chinese place and then wondering why it doesn't taste like a traditional guangzhou dish.\n\nThe bad:\nI think the decor really needs a lot more work. I kind of wish they kept the murals that were up before. I suppose it's a bit dirty, but its also an old building in SF and isn't above or below anything else similarly priced in the neighborhood.  Maybe to spruce it up, they should showcase some revolving artists like every other cafe in SF.  At least that kind of decoration is free!\n\nOverall I take away one star because I wish more of the menu was a bit more intensely flavored, and the ambiance could do with some improvement.

The rice is always perfect and the naan is delicious. I am in love with the vegi tikka masala especially because it's real tikka masala and not korma like other places give you. The spices are always just right and you can really feel the love in the food. I can't say enough good things about this place. $10 gets you a full meal and I never finish it all so I usually have lunch for the next day. Do yourself a favor and try this place.", "author": "Maya L."}

I guess the chef that made it is no longer there.  Very sad.   And the rice isn't the same either, it used to have a little orange color but no more.  Not sure if the other dishes taste the same.", "author": "Sasa L."}

Take out/delivery only though since it is not the cleanest place. Room for improvement there otherwise it is a 5 star joint ...", "author": "A B."}

The prices are reasonable. The food is freshly made and delicious. The staff are friendly.  No frills but very satisfying Indian food that wont break the bank!", "author": "Joe B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-27", "description": "I love Indian food and there is a dearth of Indian restaurants in downtown SF, so I really wanted to like this place, but the best I can give it is two stars.  The food is decent, but there is one important drawback -- everything is a la carte, there are no combinations.  So if you order chana masala, which I did, you get a large container of chana masala -- you have to order rice, naan, everything else separately.  This makes it very difficult for one person to get lunch.  Even two people would have difficulty ordering a variety of foods in reasonable portions.  The food itself was not bad -- tandoori chicken came with onion and tomato slices and lemon (breaking the a la carte rule) and was good -- spicy, moist and flavorful.  The chana masala (chickpeas in a sauce) came with a lot of sauce and few chickpeas, but I would still rate it pretty good, if not for the a la carte problem.", "author": "Morgan G."}

I was never really that into Indian food but Raavi has changed me forever. The food is always hot and ready when picked up. I recommend Raavi to everyone looking for an affordable meal in San Francisco.", "author": "Jordan W."}
