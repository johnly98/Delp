{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-19", "description": "Philz on wheels seems like such a good idea, doesn't it? The irony of its frequent placement on Sansome between Pine and Bush is that there are other Philz within spitting distance, and if you don't spit, walking distance of each other. Ah, but there's also a big Blue Bottle just up the block, so the war to lure overcaffeinated office workers in the FiDi is in full assault. Game on, Blue Bottle. All they need is a truck, and we could have a Mad Max-meets-Fast & the Furious showdown race after midnight. Only Starbucks would probably sponsor the event and dilute all the coffee to maximize their profits. What an ugly coffee lover nightmare. The reality is that the one-cup preparation at Philz doesn't really lend itself to a mobile truck setting.\n\nDespite the friendly instructions on the mini-chalkboard, the routine was a bit awkward for me to order and then step back and wait on as busy a block as Sansome is during the work day. Dodging youthful spitfires at full speed on the sidewalk, especially when they head to and from the Equinox with their headphones on completely focused on their smartphones... well, it became sport much like being the goalie on the Real Madrid team. But the payoff is that my $4.50 Mint Mojito is truly as satisfying as any I get at one of their brick-and-mortar locations (photo: http://bit.ly/2vNTPGF).

It's fitting then that I write a review of this truck. There's so many different types of food trucks such as taco trucks and Asian fusion. You can add coffee as another type of truck. The term hipster can have a negative connotation. I know because I use that term in that manner because there are certain things I like to keep nostalgic such as a dive bar or a hole in the wall eatery. However history has shown that the youth movement has made significant contributions because it's not set in its ways as the older generation. Whether it was the \"British Wave\" in the 1960s that changed rock n' roll music, or a young Harvard dropout named Bill Gates that founded Microsoft, or a young Steve Jobs who created Apple Computers in his garage the youth movement has helped things move forward instead of back.\n\nMarketing plays a key in a vision. \"One cup at a time\" is a great advertising tool for Philz Coffee to promote its own brand of coffee. You can see the process at this truck when you order your coffee. This process of using freshly ground coffee for each cup seems painstakingly expensive, but from what I heard the cost of making coffee is about 5 cents a cup. In terms of flavor you can tell the coffee isn't diluted because of  new freshly ground coffee that is used for each cup of coffee. The taste of Philz Coffee has an earthy texture. The brand of coffee is unique. You can't find this at Starbucks or Peet's Coffee. The type of coffee I like to order is anything with mint in it such as Tantalizing Turk, Philharmonic, and Iced Mint Mojito. The mint offsets the earthy taste of the coffee, but exhibits a tea texture because the mint leaves are brewing in the coffee. In a sense the mint leaves make the coffee taste refreshing. \n\nThe \"one cup at a time\" motto by Philz Coffee is a great \"hip\" idea.", "author": "Gerald R."}

So, I ordered a Greater Alarm, not the usual Mint Mojito or Tesora that most order. I clearly told the Barista how I wanted it taken and she says ok. I specifically said, medium sugar, creamy. Well, then a family of European customers lined behind me and ordered 2 coffees and 3 hot chocolates from the same barista.. I walked away, stood near the barista and waited patiently like I normally do at Philz.  After about 7-8 minutes, I heard the Barista (white brunette- you will get why I mentioned that in a minute) call out Tesora and the European girl behind me came and got her drink. I kind of raised my eyebrow but figured my drink was next. Well, she called out for another drink, and another European girl got her drink. By this time, I moved closer and stood directly in front of the barista. She then carried 3 hot chocolates and called it out. So, by now, I thought, umm what happened to my drink? I looked at the barista and asked her what happened to my drink, and she was like, \"are you sure you ordered from me or someone else may have taken your drink.\" My response, \"umm, no, I ordered from you right before the European family.\" She then says, sorry I must've forgot. Forgot?!?? Seriously, but you remembered all 5 of their drinks? Well, thanks for wasting 20-25 mins of my time to tell me you forgot! I like Philz coffee, but if I'm going to be subjected to this type of subconscious racism, never again! As a barista how about making sure you start the first customer's order before distracting yourself with others. In this case, I definitely felt the white customers behind me received priority! Well, she even forgot that I ordered from her completely, what the hell is that? I asked for a refund and made sure they knew I was not happy with this crap! I told the cashier how I felt, and his response was sorry, we aren't robots, we forget. Well, but the barista didn't forget the 5 orders behind me did she? I never thought I'd say this, but today, I felt even in San Francisco, you get better service for being white. Smh!", "author": "Mark N."}

I knew it would be terrible (line-wise). I mean. 1 truck can only have 3 people doing the coffee...given they make each cup special, and the propensity of people to order for the whole office, I was conservatively guessing a 30 minute wait. It was pretty accurate. \n\nThe line typically curves to the intersection...to which I ask...why don't people curve around? I was damn near in the crosswalk when I first approached! Overall is a good coffee, and they make 'Philz Way' less sweet than the other Philz locations. However...star off for not accepting gift cards yet. Boo to you! It took me way too long to find my darn cash.\n\nOh, and this might not be a good place for the vertically challenged. The bar to pick up your coffee is about 6 feet above ground level, and they do NOT provide a step stool for you.

At the same time, I'm definitely glad I got around to seeing their truck; it's been on my to-do list ever since it came out!

Instead, I was greeted with a lukewarm beverage with some ice cubes and a mint twig on top. While the coffee itself didn't taste bad, it was quite disappointing. It was a hot day and i wanted something REFRESHING, not lukewarm. To top it off, the mint twig was not fresh; it appeared noticeably wilted. For the price, i expected to at least deserve fresh, quality ingredients. I believe $5.50 is a pretty steep price for a sub-par, mediocre drink. \n\nMy 2nd visit: I decided to give the place another chance and got an iced chai. Well, i couldn't believe it but i actually would've preferred that 1st drink i originated got! This \"chai\" tasted as if they just poured plain almond milk into a cup (all i could taste was a nutty-tasting milk), placed a mint twig on top and called it a day. Wow, seriously? I think they're trying to impressive me with a mint twig so maybe I'll ignore the fact that the drink tasted nothing like what I ordered. \n\nI've already paid enough for these mediocre drinks at Philz. I seriously would've preferred just getting coffee at McDonald's; at least McDonald's coffee is fairly priced and actually tastes much better. It's safee to say I'm never giving Philz Coffee another penny! I've notified all my friends and now they refuse to give Philz Coffee any money either. So many better options out there.

The menu is quite big but the line is     usually long so you have time.\n2)  Once you get to the front of the line, a barista will welcome you to his or her window and ask what you want. These baristas are very cool and know how to make drinks. Trust me, I watch drinks / cocktails get made often.\n3)  Once you've ordered your Iced Mint Mojito, medium sweet with almond milk, extra mint, light ice and a nice smile, go down to the nice cashier at the far window and pay for your beverage (CASH AND CREDIT).\n4)  Patiently wait for your drink. Taste it before you walk away because they'll remake it if you're not satisfied. \n5)  Come back tomorrow and repeat.", "author": "Chris W."}

I've passed the Philz Coffee truck multiple times but am always booking it to work and can't wait in the line. I had some time a few Fridays ago after a workout class to wait and was so glad I did. You can't go wrong with any of the coffee options, I got the tesora with a splash of cream and it was delicious. I seriously feel like it's so much more caffeinated than normal coffee, I was wired all day! The line also moves quicker than I anticipated, probably only waited for about 10 minutes.", "author": "Lizzy U."}

It would be a good change of pace since a tall Blonde Roast is my religion and the Starbucks across the St. from my office is my church. So there I am in a 20 minute line to get my coffee, trying to decide what I should order. All around me people are excited and buzzing like they were waiting for Prince to show up and give everyone autographed pictures of himself....which are all good signs. I see a guy spilling some of his prized coffee onto the floor and he stands there staring at it. For a minute I wonder if he is going to get on his hands and knees and start to lick up this amazing coffee that he just spent 30 minutes aquiring on his 15 minute break. He stares at the ground sadly and moves on. At this point I KNOW I'm in store for somethign amazing. Not just amazing, but life changing. I expect that with my first sip I am going to discover the meaning of my life, quit my job, and join an Ashram in India, never ever being the same person ever again. Again upon the recommendation of my co-worker, I order the Hot-ito, which is the hot version of the iced coffee mojito. the line is starting to swell, and the crowd is starting to swarm, like killer bees all starting to go crazy for the sweet  promise of nectar from Philz Coffee Truck, parked in the middle of SF's financial district. Everything is building up to a mass crescendo of excitement, and a little fear. My brow glistens and my tastebuds are screaming in anticipation. Then out of nowhere, I hear the man with the giant moustache call out my order. My legs are barely working, I don't even remember walking forward and raching up to grasp the cup. I look down and dont just see a sprig of mint in a cup of coffee. I see the past, present, and future. I know who shot JFK, and what the government keeps at area 51. I am literally having an out of body experience. I close my eyes....place the cup to my mouth, and take a sip. My eyes open, and I blurt out....THIS TASTES LIKE SHI*! My co-workers are taking sips of their own coffees and looking lost. Their minds are trying to convince their mouths that the coffee has to be good. Why else would there be such long lines to get it? How is this possible? Is there really a GOD?  So in closing, I wanted to love this coffee. I wanted it to be everything the Starbucks and Peets could never be. What I got was something that tasted like cemetery dirt. It's gross. The End.\n\n---------------------\u00adUPDATE----WENT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY--------------------\n\nLet me start off by saying I think everyone deserves a second chance. Sometimes things go horribly worng due to a combination of things which can include: planetary mis-alignment, witch curses, and general bad luck. Therefore I started the day pumped up to give Philz Coffee Truck another chance. As my trusty co-worker and I started off on our expedition 3 blocks deep into the heart of SF's financial district, the wind was howling and the sun was hidden by skyscrapers. On any other regular day we would have took these thing as ominous omens, foretelling of bad things to come. However thins was no ordinary day. Our cause was a noble one, to fight our way through throngs of SF natives and procure what other consider the holy grail of coffee. We took our place in at the end of the line, some 15 people deep, and began to think once again what we would order, all the while pushing aside the memories of the horrors we had endured the previous day. This was it, the most important decision, of perhaps our lives that we would make and we needed full mental clarity. My co-worker had placed her order and there was now nothing between me and the lady wearing the Technics t-shirt taking orders. The distance appeared impossibly huge. For 5 minutes I stood in line wondering what was next. The lady taking orders was shuffling paper bags and starring off into the distance. After 5 uncomfortable minutes I  moved over to the her window, wondering if wherever she had gone in her mind it was warm and sunny and she was enjoying herself. I had everything that I was going to say, prepared in my mind. When I got to the counter, everything went horribly wrong. My mind sent signals to my mouth to say, Hi, I'lll have an iced Mint Mojito please, however what came out sounded like a zombie trying to take an order at an Italian restaurant. I uhhh..rrrrra...mmmuu. That lady in the gray Tecnics tshirt snapped my out of my stupor and said, WE ONLY HAVE SMALL AND LARGE! I managed to say, \"small\" and I handed over my credit card which she snatched away with a look of annoyance. I took my card back and stood along the sidewalk, waiting for my drink. My co-worker got her drink in about 7 minutes. Then we waited....and waited....in fact we waited so long that a baby had been born at a nearby hospital, taken home, and had learned to walk. They forgot my order, took more time to make it, and it was OK.", "author": "N C."}

There was a lot of hype about their mint mojito iced coffee.  I know there's a Philz in Los Angeles but I'm glad I was able to try it in San Francisco.  It was DELICIOUS and REFRESHING!

The smell of coffee always brightens my mornings. When I stop by, I always get the Philharmonic, and it never disappoints. They have an uncanny knack for knowing what \"just a little cream\" means, and they always hit the mark! The only downside is the line...which is always long. That keeps me away from the truck on my walk to work most of the time. Despite the line, they get your coffee to you pretty quickly which is impressive.", "author": "Grace M."}

It was a rainy day in SF, but there were still people waiting in line with their hoods and umbrellas. The coffee was great. I had a Tesora (one of their most popular drinks). In my experience, the service was excellent, as it is in every Philz location I've been to. Everyone was smiling and very friendly, even though they were really busy.  Once I got my drink, they had me give it a taste to make sure I didn't want to add anything. I hope I come across their truck again next time I'm in San Francisco! It was super convenient and put me in a great mood, despite the weather!", "author": "Raizel G."}

She takes my order. I wait 10 minutes during which time everyone else who ordered got their drinks. 5 more minutes roll by and I notice that she is taking additional orders. I ask her if mine has been made. She says no, then says yes (pointing to one of the urns). I wait 5 more minutes and those customers who ordered long after I did get their drinks (btw, the urn she pointed at was for another customer). I had already paid for my drink, but I could not afford to wait for another 5 minutes and left (and she saw me leave and said nothing). This is the second time I have had a bad Philz experience (the first being the old Castro location about 2 months ago) and for the same reasons I have described here. I think my relationship with Philz is done. There are plenty of other coffee places in SF that have better customer service.", "author": "John R."}

I've been to their 24th St. location and I admire the devotion and great attitude their baristas bring to the counter, but overall I don't find their coffee to be better than many of the other \"take coffee seriously\" types of places here in the FiDi.  I've learned to appreciate black coffee, and though I admit Philz's is better than the bicycle trade coffee that's available at so many places around the city, to me it doesn't taste better than Illy, or the clove coffee from Starbucks (where available).  Still a bit too bitter whereas other places tend to have a smoother black coffee experience; just my two cents.  Furthermore, the devotion of many other Philz's fan is a bit of a detractor for me because I don't want to wait in a long line for something I'm not all that jazzed about. Yet, the allegiance of so many of my work neighbors perplexes me, so I'm sure I'll give it another go and update.", "author": "Jesse G."}

I only drink black coffee and unless you want to indulge in getting the cream, any of their coffees is delicious. However, their cups are the worst.
