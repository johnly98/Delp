But first let me make it clear that this is not (all) about the food but 90% about the service that we experienced. \n\nI recommended this restaurant to my best friend and we decided to come here to celebrate her birthday. We ordered mussels and shrimp to start along with Dungeness crab crostini. The mussels and shrimp were fantastic, like I remembered, and it was a seemingly great start to our dinner. I ordered the filet mignon with a half crab for my main course and the filet mignon was cooked perfectly. However, the crab was very roasted which made it super dry. Of course, it was my friend's birthday so we were chatting while enjoying our meal and taking our time. I noticed our waiter would constantly come by to stare at whether we finished our food or not and even asked twice if we were finished (we were not, obviously, there was still uneaten crab legs and some meat on our plates). We began to feel rushed and obligated to finish our food quicker. I then remembered that our waiter literally stood in front of our table asking who was going to have the last pieces of shrimp and mussels so he could take away the appetizers. Awkward... \n\nAfter we finished, our plates were taken almost right away and we then ordered the mango panna cotta for dessert, which was delicious. But as we were finishing up, our waiter comes by AGAIN to comment on how there's only a little bit left. At this point I was sure they were just trying to get us to leave. We felt extremely rushed and it definitely made our meal and my friend's birthday dinner not as enjoyable as it should have been, since the food was delicious. My friend said they thought they were rushing us because they were closing soon, but as we left we saw several other tables in the other room still dining. Unfortunately I can no longer say that Bobo's is my favorite restaurant because the service put a damper on my best friend's birthday dinner. Don't expect this to be a 5 star dining experience because they want you in and out of there as soon as possible.", "author": "Cecille W."}

He answered all of our questions with the most helpful suggestions and really helped us pick out a wine to match our dishes.\n\nThe steak was just awful, I will include that I am extremely picky with my steak as I am from Texas.  I did not enjoy the quality of meat, especially for the prices at Bobo's. I was expecting much more, I really wanted to like this restaurant though and am disappointed it was not a better experiece.\n\nDefinitely go to Harrahs if you want a quiality steak in the beighnorhood.", "author": "Ellie J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-22", "description": "This is an EXPENSIVE A LA CARTE restaurant. Everything is single item with a cost that runs your bill up quick. Order a $65 steak & two side orders of potatoes and spinach at $9 each and now your dinner is $85, add a glass of wine your bill is now $97 for ONE PERSON. That is how it works here.\nFood is good but way way way overpriced. Restaurant is small and tight table space, and staff not very friendly at all from the bored looking hostesses at door to the waiters who act all business in a rushed manner & not very friendly. Again, the food is very good, but not at the price they demand. Just imagine going somewhere for a steak dinner for 2 & all you get for $130 is 2 pieces of steak and that is IT, no salad, no potatoes, no anything else. Oops I forgot, they do give you good garlic french bread at table before dinner but believe me, in the end you pay for it. Our dinner for 2 here was $190.00, wow but they have free valet parking.\nNo return here, I'd rather go somewhere else and eat 3 times for this price. The last rub was having a fee of $7.40 added to bill for SF good & welfare program even though SF already spends over $271 million a year on homeless mess. Cya BoBo.", "author": "Larry H."}

The kitchen mixed up parts of our order (wrong steak / wrong doneness) and was unwilling to exchange it to the right piece. Alright, I'm more than happy to forgive mistakes but if I'm being charged $$$ prices I'd expect better customer service. Moreover, really EVERYONE who worked here seemed stressed. No smiles and a rather grumpy attitude. We were seated upstairs next to the patio door and that one waiter came by every 10 minutes or so to air out the room, without asking if it's okay to leave the door open. I ended up sitting there with my jacket. I didn't expect SF's winter in July to follow me into the restaurant.\n\nPoor service and poor customer care. Nah.", "author": "Sebastian F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-11", "description": "Overall, I felt like Bobo's is a bit too expensive for the quality of food that it offers. I've never had a cold steak until I went there. And, no, it wasn't a steak tartar. I ordered a Double Turf n' Surf (a New York Steak with Filet Mignon along with a side order of crab legs) and for some reason, everything felt a bit cold when I ate them. It was almost as if the chef had left them sitting for too long before they got to my table. In any case, I enjoyed my rare filet mignon since it was very tender and tasty. If only it was a bit warmer in the center, I probably would've loved it more. The New York Steak, on the other hand, was quite chewy and full of tough fat parts. I regretted that my side steak wasn't another filet mignon from this experience. As for the crab legs, holy sh*t did I learn my lesson to never order a crustacean when I'm at a steak place. I felt as if my poor crab didn't have enough to eat before it was freshly netted out from the ocean and dumped onto my plate since it was so scrawny and cold. If I ever go back to Bobo's, I will make sure to stick to the filet mignon and forget anything else on the menu. \n\nSince this place is in the City, the free valet parking is awesome. The ambience there was quite lovely (our group of 4 got seated on one of the higher floors) and worthy of an anniversary celebration. Service is superb and well worth the heavy price tag.", "author": "Joy H."}

It's a fun theme well implemented. \n\nWe shared their famous bone-in filet mignon, a half crab, a twice baked potato and a wedge Caesar salad they nicely split for us. \n\nThe salad was very tasty, above average for sure. The steal was honestly one of the best I've ever had the bone added serious flavor. The half crab was a little overcooked but still quite tasty and they include some steak sauce and bread with butter and olive on it. FInally the twice baked potato was incredibly tasty and we destroyed it.\n\nWe shared some Strawerry cheesecake for dessert. Will return.", "author": "Jordan C."}

We had to keep asking over and over again for our drinks cause we wouldn't get them, our appetizers were good, but the bread was the hardest and driest bread I've ever tried at a restaurant. We kept breathing and being patient longing for our steaks to arrive since they were supposed be awesome (according to the price and word of mouth I've head), what a tremendous deception when our steaks arrived raw when many from our table have ordered medium well and specifically requested them not bloody-red, 3 of us decided we just couldn't eat them that way and sent them to the kitchen to get them a little more cooked (other's in our table just decided to eat it that way but weren't happy about it), it took forever for the steaks to get back to us, and this time they were completely chard (literally black) on the outside but still red in the inside, the photo I'm posting doesn't even do justice to how chard it actually was.... Horrible experience, and it was so hot in there since it's a tiny place with no air circulation, wouldn't recommend this place at all! And it's So not worth the price!

The stars could be broken up into two categories: food & service. 2 stars for the service which was pretty good. The waiters made sure my water glass was full-- I drink a lot, they filled it every time it was empty so that says a lot. Our waitress was nice and not pushy, gave us time to decide and made sure everything was all good. Only complaint is that they sat us where the extra dishes/utensils were, so every time they had to get extras it was a bit noisy. Onto the food.\n\nOrdered the New York Strip ~18-20oz [$49.95] I enjoyed my steak. It was cooked to my liking (Med) instead of their suggested temp which was Med Rare. The meat was tender and juicy all throughout. Filet Mignon Bone In [$51.95] didn't really taste like a filet... I think they overcooked some parts to where the meat was tough but as we got through the middle it started tasting more like a filet. The \"bone-in\" part wasn't anything special, just something to attract the customers cause it tasted the same. The sides we chose were the Modern Mac & Cheese [$9.95] and the Mushroom [$9.95] which are both big enough to share. Loooved the portabello mushrooms! It was well prepared in a great tasting sauce. The Modern Mac took a back seat to the mushrooms, but it was still a great side dish. It was creamy and cheesy, but not cheesy enough to overcome the shrooms. \n\nBobo's is a good establishment. The steaks were great & the service was good, but honestly, I've had better steak. Nothing really blew me away except maybe the mushrooms. It was a great experience. The quirkiness of the restaurant shows in every room, but I wish it was a little more brighter for patrons to see the decor. Also, it smelled a little funky in the room we sat in (first room to the right upon entering the building). I think maybe cause it's an old joint.

The steak (Filet) was one of the best ones I have had. I ordered medium rare and it came out much closer to rare but it was so good that I did not mind The twice baked potato was also very good. Wife had the crab and loved it. Not sure exactly their secret for cooking it but very successful. The Mango Panna cotta is also very good.\n\nService - In general was very good however he did not seem to be very knowledgeable on wine. Specifically was not sure of the difference between a sweet wine (which my wife likes) and a dry wine.\n\nPrice - Expensive.

We were definitely early as the restaurant was empty when we arrived. We got a great table on the top floor overlooking the street with the entire floor to ourselves. We started with cocktails, I had the basil cocktail and daughter had the blood orange margarita. Good drinks, but nothing to write home about. We followed up the cocktails with some wine by the glass. For dinner we ordered the crab bisque, Cesar salad, full crab, 9 oz filet, mac & cheese, and chard. Salad was real good, bisque was good and full of crab. Filet was the highlight of the meal (according to my daughter) - she quickly finished it. Chard and Mac & cheese were tasty. Crab was a little dry, but still good. As we ate, our dining room filled with other patrons and the restaurant was completely full when we finished. \n\nService was top notch. They were very professional, not pushy, and great with wine recommendations.

They have this really good crispy kettle bread for starters and amazing Dungeness crab crostinis with smoked salmon, avocado, olive oil and burratta. Definitely a must-try. We got the bone-in filet for dinner at medium rare and it came out perfectly, with the twice baked potatoes and creamed spinach family style.

Steak came out completely raw at first (it was ice cold in the middle!) and then came out burnt on both sides when we sent it back. For a steakhouse that prides themselves on the bone-in filet, it's not a good look when you can't even properly cook a medium rare steak!\n\nOverall ambiance was fun and quirky but a little dated.

Was prepared to look for parking but was pleasantly surprised by the complimentary valet parking right out front! Was quickly seated and the waiter was on point. The ambiance was ok - it was dark like most steakhouses are so it's difficult to get good pictures, but obviously, that's not the priority of us being there. \n\nThere was only three of us and you won't believe how much we ate. We ordered 2 full-sized crabs, double serving of shrimp, 16 oz bone-in filet mignon, 2 orders of crab cakes (4 total), order of lobster crostini, a side of brussel sprouts, a side of mushrooms, 2 desserts and 3 drinks. The waiter thought we were crazy but it was so good, we ate most of it (we purposely skipped lunch and came hungry lol)\n\nBy 8:30pm, we were finishing up our dessert when the hostess came up to us and said something along the lines of \"I have 4 people here for their 8:30 reservation so we'll need you to wrap up\". We were so shocked we didn't even respond before she turned around and walked away. The waiter heard and he apologized and said we could stay but by then, my friend was so turned off, she said she wanted to leave and she will be writing a Yelp review and my other friend and I wanted to stay even longer just to spite the hostess. There's no sign like at Korean hot-pot places that say our reservation is only 2 hours. What if we were still eating and hadn't paid yet? We just felt so disrespected. Instead of passive-aggressively complaining, I went up to the hostess and gave her a piece of my mind. I asked her what her name is (it's Nancy) and I told her what she did and how she treated us was incredibly rude. We literally just spent $400 between 3 people and expect to be treated better. It is not our fault you as a hostess overbooked the restaurant and there's no sign we had to leave at 2 hours exactly. We were having a wonderful night until she came up to our table demanding us to leave. She responded with \"do you want to talk to the manager?\" I said \"No, did I say I wanted to talk to the manager? I just want to talk to you and tell you what you did is not right\".

When the waiter came back for our order he \"splashed\" hubby's water all over the table, his app plate, silverware. He was pretty nonchalant about it and rather than apologize said \"at least it's just water\". I didn't find that appropriate, but we just nervous giggled and moved past it because the table was literally smaller than my pillow at home. Very small, very cramped in the bar area. I was bumped in to at least 6 times in the duration of our meal. \n\nI was torn between crab and shrimp, but \"settled\" for crab  Hubby got the bone-in filet mignon.  We let the waiter know we were sharing and he stated they would split the food for us. Pretty cool. I like when restaurants do that, or bring the extra plat so we can do it ourselves. \n\nThey started us off with sourdough topped with olives and drizzled with olive oil. I didn't eat the topping but hubby enjoyed it! The bread was SO good! Light, fluffy, and the crust was crispy. It was perfect! Food came out soon after and was cooked well. They do goop the garlic butter all over the crab which makes cracking a challenge (especially with the \"fancy\" stupid cloth napkins). They do not bring a shell bowl, but that's probably because there's literally no room one on the table. Our glasses ended up in the windowsill so we had room for our plates. The steak was great! Cooked well and not too fatty or gristle-y. The crab was good, but I am a Dungeness LOVE-ERRRRR! Once again, we had a ton of people ask if we were done eating while we were still mid-bite (or one while I was chewing). It must be an \"SF\" thing to not get to sit and enjoy your food because they were so crowded and busy it was obvious they wanted our table. Even the hostess came over to try to clear our food, before we ever even got the bill. Hubby was so annoyed at that that he went and paid the bill directly to the waiter while I stood in the doorway.

Presentation was beautiful.\n\nBut you're not here for salad are you?\n\nOn to the steak...\n\nMy goodness, prices have spiked since I was last here. Yet, I cannot pass you up, oh bone-in filet. The steak was cooked to order, medium-rare in this case, and tasted phenomenal, eliciting \"wows\" and audible moans of pleasure. Presentation, again, could be improved here, and there were bits of this cut that were chewier than I'd prefer in a $52 filet, but all-in-all, this is one great steak. As good as my last time here? No, but it didn't fall short by much.\n\nTotal for two - two cocktails, salad, shrimp app, chard, steak: $170 all-in.\n\nCome here for cocktails and steak.

It does come with a price tag but it's not bad if you're looking at other $$$ steakhouses plus I bet their seafood is better ;) \n\nI recommend reserving to avoid a wait. It easy and you can use opentable so no excuses! The restaurant is hard to miss with its vibrant color and of course the jester logo. They also have complimentary valet or you can chance it with street parking.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple. They have a seafood, salad, and steak section plus some other stuff. You are a fool if you don't get one seafood dish. If you're thinking about getting a steak to share and adding a crab to it and maybe the mussel and shrimp platter as an appetizer... Do it but definitely go with the double shrimp, mussel, and full crab platter and a steak. You get more food at a better price! And yes, that is a lot of food for two people but soooo good :) \n\nShrimp, mussel, and crab platter: I'm not 100% sure platter is the correct dish name but it was served on a platter that was sizzling so I'm using it. They're all cooked in the same sauce and served as one dish. Garlic, butter, and seafood is a match made by the gods because very few things can beat it. The dish was delicious and that crab was cooked perfectly. The double platter is definitely meant to be shared by 4 people and way too much for 2 people but I wasn't complaining. Though I loved the crab, the shrimp was my favorite. \n\nSide note: you also get this amazing crisp bread rubbed with garlic and this was low key my favorite dish. \n\nBone-in dry aged New York: my new rule in life is to always get dry aged steak. This wasn't as dry aged as I would like it but it was a solid steak. They only cook their steak one way and that's medium rare. I found my steak to be more on the rare side so it was a little chewier than I would like but the flavor was simple and tasty. \n\nI also got the mushrooms, twice baked potato, and lobster bisque. The twice baked potatoes was good but not worth it for me. I didn't like the lobster bisque because it was really a lobster curry soup with a few pieces of lobster so unless curry is your thing, I would pass. I did however, enjoy the mushrooms immensely. It was intensely juicy and flavorful. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my experience here and would definitely come back for more seafood! The service here was great. The staff was friendly and attentive. Definitely worth trying if you want great seafood with some good steak to go with it!", "author": "Jennifer H."}

It sucks when the seafood is better than the actual steak. The most redeeming quality of Bobo's is the ambiance and service. \n\nFor our table, we ordered the super bone in filet mignon and the ribeye because everyone on yelp was raving about this. First of all, I love my steaks medium rare and this filet mignon was a freaking sampler of every level of doneness. The first few slices were well done followed by a briefly medium rare portion and everything between the middle to the bone was rare. Not to mention, the center was cold and the outsides were way too over done. If I was blind folded I could've sworn these steaks were straight outa Outback Steakhouse. And that's just depressing... I wish it was a better experience because I've heard such great things, but this was one of the worst I've ever had. \n\nOverall Bobo's is a No no.", "author": "Eric Joseph D."}

I had reservations booked in advance so I was really looking forward to trying this place.\n\nFor dinner we had the following:\n1. Mussels and shrimp - we had this as an appetizer. I typically love mussels the way the French do it but these mussels weren't that good.  The shrimp was far better. I've had better mussels at most other French restaurants. They were over cooked and the flavor wasn't there. If I ever go back, I wouldn't get the mussels.  I'd go for the shrimp instead.\n\n2. Baby blue salad - delicious. The proportions were just right. \n\n3. Filet mignon - this was absolutely delicious. I ordered it medium rare but it came out as a medium. Regardless, it was delicious. \n\n4. Brussel Sprouts - these were amazing. I was truly surprised how delicious these were. \n\n5. Dunce cap cones  - these were good. The mousse was delicious. The cones were good. Not as good and buttery as the ici ice cream cones in Rerkeley nor the butter waffle cookies at trader joe's. \n\n6. Mango panna cotta - good. I wouldn't say it was amazing. \n\nThe place looks small from the outside but it is huge on the inside like a maze with many little rooms. The ambiance is romantic with dim lighting. There's a nice bar area for you to wait to be seated. The service was alright. I think the waiter was really busy that day. Valet was a nice plus. \n\nTL/DR:  The shrimp was good; the mussel's were a big disappointment. I would come again.

I don't normally like bone-in steaks either but I decided to try it and boy was I glad I went with their signature dish. Super tender but also super flavorful.  I actually preferred the bone-in filet to the bone-in ribeye.  I think the filet actually had just as much or more flavor and was way more tender.  It was like flavorful butter.\n\nThe tomato salad was also really great; I don't know why they don't mention it but it's tomatoes avocados and super soft and tasty burrata!\n\nThe bread is super tasty but comes out full of oil and capers.  If you want plain bread they will bring you out a hot loaf of plain bread also.\n\nDesserts were an absolute disappointment, but I'm not taking off a star because that bone-in filet was SO GOOD.  The wild strawberry italian cheesecake tasted like just cream and it had RASPBERRY on it (I don't like raspberries) and they didn't list it at all.  At least I wasn't allergic.

We arrived a little early for our 6pm reservation on Father's Day and were pleasantly surprised to find that they had complimentary valet parking. The hostess was very nice and said she was happy we were early, but the person she directed to seat us seemed confused and aloof. There had been cancellations so they were shuffling plans and out of high chairs. Both are understandable. After a minute or so, we were seated upstairs at a table for 5 when there were just 2.5 of us. We were seated against the window and I immediately noticed the layer of dust on the blinds that was next to the table. They decided to separate and turn the tables around since we didn't need such a large table which was fine but we found it odd they didn't do it before seating us. Our server wasn't very friendly or personable. She was just blah and she didn't come around to refill my water or ask if we needed another bottle of sparkling or check on us in general. The rest of the staff was all very pleasant and personable when bringing the food and clearing dishes. As for our food, the Combo Shrimp, Mussels, and Half Crab were good but not great. The Mussels were really fresh and bursted with flavor but the shrimp were boring and the crab didn't impress us by any means. I do think the combo was a decent size and it's a nice starter to share. Both the Filet Mignon and New York Steak were cooked to the right temp of medium rare but something was missing in the seasoning. The Swiss Chard side and the Mac & Cheese were both tasty and we really enjoyed the Portobello Mushroom side. It was probably the best of the dishes we had. The meal was underwhelming and the place seemed run down with the dusty blinds, a scratched up black banister showing white paint, and faded, dirty carpet. For the high price and being known for both Steak and Crab, the quality just did not meet expectations.", "author": "Jen L."}

And i must say, it was the worst rotten, smelly, mussels we've ever tasted that left a terrible taste in our mouths. Unfortunately, quality does not match price ($250 bill!).

So, when I was in SF, I knew that I had to try this place.  I made sure to make reservations since I was going on a Saturday night.  I took an Uber here so I did not have to worry about parking.  Once I got there, it was packed!!! It was packed in the restaurant, packed at the bar, packed in the waiting area.  I checked in with the hostess and wandered to the outside area.  There is no waiting area, so everyone who was waiting was sort of awkwardly facing each other.  My reservation was for 9, but she still quoted me a 20 minute wait.  I get it, it was crowded on Saturday night.  But, once the 20 minute mark passed, I started getting a little antsy especially since parties that were there after me started getting seated.  I checked in with the host at the 25 minute mark and she told me another 10 minutes, but to make sure to check in with her.  Then, when I did, she quoted me another a few minutes.  SIGH! I think the problem is they allocate a table to each party and the table I was allocated to was not leaving.  However, since the hostess knew I was waiting, I guess she decided to jump the line a little and gave us these amazing seats on the top floor.  It was a private booth.  I loved it so I guess it was worth the wait.  (Especially since I saw that a lot of the 2 seater were very close to each other). \n\nOnce I got seated, I was ready for some good food.  I got some complimentary garlic bread.  DELICIOUS!!! I looked over the menu and decided on the filet and baked potato to share.

Pretty tasty appetizers, including the iron skillet seafood.  Sides were just ok, but who goes to a steakhouse for sides?\n\nMussels & Shrimp: They look very impressive with everything sizzling on an iron skillet  Absolutely loved the shrimp which was bursting with flavor; the shell was cooked enough that you just ate it whole for a slight crunch.  The mussels were kind of meh though, felt a little dry from the preparation (compared to when mussels are steamed in a nice broth).\n\nYellowtail Carpaccio: Way more exciting than sashimi because of all the nice ingredients on top.\n\nDungeness Crab Crostini: The smoked salmon felt a bit unnecessary (but still tasted good).  I really liked the pairing of crab with cheese & avocado for extra creaminess.\n\nHeirloom Toy Box Tomatoes: Less going on here so you can really focus on the cheese and some pretty little tomatoes.\n\nBone-In Filet Mignon: This is why you come to Bobo's.  I had it the house default of medium-rare and it was just perfect.  Absolutely loved the high-temperature sear on the outside while the inside maintained a full color gradient from char-to-pink as you moved towards the center.  I asked about steak sauces (e.g. b\u00e9arnaise, au poivre) but they only offered A1 so I passed.  So much flavor, it was fine without anything on top.\n\nTwice-Baked Potato: This looked cool, but I wasn't too impressed by the taste.  It seemed like it had cubes of zucchini mixed in.  Also, the twice-baked filling wasn't that smooth.\n\nBermuda Onion Rings: Seemed a bit batter heavy.\n\nMod Mac w/ Lobster: So anything mac & cheese and anything lobster will be good, that's just a fact.  Despite the winning combination, this dish didn't graduate from the good to great.  The crust on top was just few breadcrumbs; I prefer a nice thick layer of crusted cheese.  The noodles seems a bit small and limp (as opposed to al dente).

While the aesthetic was nice, the dining area where we were sat had a distinct and putrid smell.  The wait staff was pretty rude as well.  When we asked for one steaks to be prepared Medium, this seemed to cause heartache for the waitress.  She offered them prepared 'Medium Rare' and when I asked if there would be a problem preparing them at Medium, she said there wouldn't be.  The steaks were served Medium Rare.   \n\nAdditionally,  the gentleman bussing the tables just came in and grabbed plates/glasses from us.  No questions, just took them and left.  \n\nGiven the price of this experience, the service we received and the quality of how the food was prepared the only word that I can use to describe Bobo's is 'disappointing'.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-14", "description": "I'll preface this review by stating that we came on New Year's Eve, so I think our experience with the food is different than on a regular night. Our group of four had early dinner reservations for 5:45 pm. When we arrived the restaurant only had a handful of other tables and we were seated upstairs. It was pretty hot and stuffy up there, but luckily someone cracked the door open about halfway through our meal. Our waitress was extremely kind and attentive throughout our dinner service. \n\nIn casual conversation our waitress let us know that they had about 300 more seatings after our early dinner seating. They were prepared by having a ton of staff, but perhaps a bit too prepared with having the food already prepared prior to people ordering it. I say this because we received our food fast, like fast food drive-thru fast. We put in our order, received our bread and as we are taking bites of our bread our entrees were being put down in front of us. We received our entrees in about 7 minutes or less. Our waitress even made a comment saying that she's never seen the food come out that quick. This indicated to me that it was all prepared beforehand because there was no way our food was fired when the order was put in. We ordered our steak medium and it came to us medium rare. No biggie, we aren't that picky and ate it the way it came to us, but it was lukewarm. While some people prefer steak to be fully rested to room temperature, I like it when it's served with a bit more heat so the fat melts in my mouth.  We also ordered the half crab and it was so dry we had to drench it in the dipping sauce. This was the biggest disappointment. We ended our meal with a couple of desserts which were satisfying.\n\nI'm sure this place is good on a regular night, but the food we received was prepared too far in advance and got to us at lightning speed, which is not something we want at a nice sit down restaurant. The food was really 2 stars, but I gave it 3 due to the great service.", "author": "Sara P."}

However, for the price, the steak was a bit small. Also, my mom's steak was a bit burnt (but she did ask for a medium well so maybe that's just how it was supposed to be for that cook) \nThe sides were okay. the mushrooms were huge chunks of portobello that seemed to be just coated in butter. nothing too special. the brussel sprouts were pretty good- lots of good bacon flavor. the twice baked potato was okay- not as amazing as everyone made it seem like it was in their reviews- just tasted like a plain baked potato to me. \nMy dad ordered the mussel/shrimp/crab mix- crab was extremely small in size with very little meat. mussels were pretty good but I could tell they weren't too fresh. shrimp was fine, just coated in tons of butter. \nActually everything was extremely buttery and greasy...definitely do not come here if you are trying to avoid all that. I ended up with a bit of a stomach ache after the meal just because it was SO much butter in everything...\nThe service was fine..nothing extraordinary...no one came by our table asking if we wanted more bread, if everything was okay, if we wanted anything else to drink... \nFor a $270 check, food was decent but I would probably not come back.", "author": "Jinhee K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-22", "description": "Bobo's is such a unique restaurant with Venetian d\u00e9cor and its dim light makes it a perfect date night spot. It is famous for their steak among all things and I was here with my clients so we were able to order a huge selection of food to try. There are some things I absolutely love here and unfortunately, there are things that I think could be better.\n\nWhat I really like from their appetizers are their Iron skillet roasted mussels, free garlic bread, yellowtail Carpaccio and Filet el Crudo. The mussels are a bit fried so be aware but the sauce is delicious. The yellowtail carpaccio is a bit spicy but very fresh and tender. I like their Filet too but that is overshadowed by the yellowtail. \n\nFor entr\u00e9e, I opted for their medium rare bone-in Filet Mignon 20 oz and the gentlemen at the table all got the bone-in rib eye. I should have got that as well. My filet came but it honestly wasn't cooked perfectly. The outer layer of the steak seems rather medium and I don't see the reddish part till I am about center close to the bone. The steak is aged but the flavor did not seem to reach the majority of the meat. My guess is that the filet is very thick and therefore, hard to cook it evenly throughout. On the contrary, the rib eye is juicy, fatty and full of flavor. On the sides, we tried lobster mac and cheese, mod mac, Brussel sprouts and cauliflower and lobster mac is definitely the clear winner. \n\nWe ended the night with 3 different types of desserts. My favorite is their raspberry cheese cake. It is somewhat rich yet light and not too sweet. Their chocolate bomb is also amazing as well as their Panna Cotta.  \n\nOverall, it was a great meal with lots of solid dishes. However, if you are a serious steak lover, go for the rib eye and skip the filet mignon. I have had better, tender and juicier pieces.", "author": "Athena C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-10", "description": "The 1 and 2 star reviews are right on the money sad to say.  We had our holiday party here and I was very disappointing. After some of our staff driving 2+ hours to the restaurant from their locations (we cover the entire Bay Area), the only good thing were the \"Sidecars\" that the bartender made me. Other than that, everything was not good.\n\nAll the food came out in horribly long intervals (we had 28 people, all in the burger restarant of Bobo's, not the Steakhouse side, so it was just us with a fixed menu that was all set up before the evening.   \n\nThe appetizers were the mussels and crab in which the mussels were chalk dry and completely overcooked. Not a bit of moisture in them, and mussels are one of my favorites. The crab was ok, but it just missed the mark completely for me. \n\nWater, Water Water, where is the water. Finally after 30 minutes of asking at least 6 times by several different people we received our water, long after we started eating.\n\nSteaks: I had ordered the bone in NY and was very disappointing. The meat came out not extremely hot.  I had to wait 15 minutes to eat because they brought out 3-4 steaks at a time (seemed like every 5 minutes) and then we had to wait for more to come out until our table received all the main courses. The steak was a bone in NY, 16oz but mine had a lot of hard fat around the edges. I love fat, that's the flavor, but it should be crispy fat that is soft and tender, not grizzle like.  The steak was not very thick, and although med rare, the temperature was way down when it came and nearly cool by the time I could eat it.  Otherwise I would looked like a starving caveman eating steak while my co-workers watched.\n\nThen after we started on the main dish, the side dishes sporadically started coming out for another 10-15 minute strung out service for those.  The final side dish of the three came out a good 20 minutes after I received my steak. Just horrible timing from a crew that seemed completely overwhelmed with a group.  They were very nice, but the service was very poorly coordinated and executed.\n\nThe sauteed mushrooms were ok, and the brussel sprouts were good (I did like the brussel sprouts).  The baked potatoes came out and they put a few in front of six of us and we just figured they were to share. After cutting them in 1/3's, suddenly more of them show up. Very disorganized and again horrible timing.\n\nFor the hype I heard about this place, the steak was definitely no where near the quality I have had elsewhere, and the service was extremely poor.  I really was surprised how the evening went considering this was all planned out in advance with the restaurant.\n\n2 stars, definitely much better steakhouses than this in SF and the greater bay area.\n\nThe song of the review is by The Flock of Seagulls, \"I ran\", unfortunately it's away.", "author": "Jay G."}

It was quiet and intimate.  The mussels and shrimp came on a sizzling platter and it was amazing!!  It comes w/a caper, lemon butter sauce and super yummy!  The prime rib was soooo huge that I had more than enough to have steak and eggs the next day.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare and good.  The sides were all pretty good but came al carte so it was a little pricey ($9.99/side).

So we booked a table for last night at 7:00.\n\nAfter a schedule change, we showed up 45 minutes early figuring it would either be packed and we could have drinks at the bar while we waited, or it would be early enough to snare an empty table.\n\nGot there and the bar area was full, but the two main dining rooms had a single table occupied in each room. The hostess wanted us to sit at a table literally 6 inches from the other couple in a completely empty room of tables. When we asked if we could have a more private seat, the hostess said \"not till 7:00.\"\n\nWe tried a few times to point out other options but she refused until our reservation time of 7:00PM, so we walked out. Her response in a snarky tone: \"I take it that's a no?\" We said \"correct.\" and she just said happily \"well, good by.\"\n\nThe hostess then listed us as a no-show on Open Table, so I just came here to correct that and add - we are big tippers, usually order cocktails and an expensive bottle of wine with dinner, enjoy great steaks, and sides, and with a baby sitter in Marin - would not have hogged the earlier table and probably opened up one more cover for them in the process.

There was sadly a mistake so they brought out only the mussels the first time and when I mentioned it to the server asking where our shrimp was, he apologized and brought out shrimp, but it was only like 4 pieces :( my guess is that they gave us full size of mussels and reduced the amount of shrimp. Anyway, mussels were delicious. Imagine a very soft mussels soaked in the buttery garlicky dipping sauce melting in your mouth. Mmmmm~ however, although I'm a huge fan of seafood so I love all kinds but shrimps unfortunately didn't meet up to my expectations. There wasn't anything special to it. And it was very salty. \n\nSome of the other things we ordered were:\n-CRAB CAKES: decent. Skip next time. \n-FILET MIGNON: ordered a medium rare but received medium well--it ended up being a little more chewy and cooked than I wanted it to, but it was still very delicious and juicy.\n-BONE-IN FILET MIGNON w/ HALF CRAB: ordered medium well but received medium rare. Juiced, and very tender. Half a crab had lots of meat attached.\n\n\nOverall, I enjoyed everything. Our waiter was very kind but he unfortunately messed up on a lot of the items we ordered and it was sometimes difficult to grab his attention. \n\nIf I were to ever come back, I think I'll go all for seafood next time.", "author": "Elaine C."}

The restaurant was extremely quiet and the tables seemed like it was all packed tightly together. I actually had a very hard time getting inside my seat because the table was placed way too close to the wall. There was a weird curtain right against our table to separate us from the next table. Nonetheless, I felt as if it was way too packed together. I could literally hear the whole conversation of the table right next to us since it was just a curtain dividing us. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the surf and turf, which consisted of bone in filet minon and half a crab. I got the bone in filet mignon with a side of mod mac and the twice baked potato. Overall I wasn't too impressed with the filet mignon. I didn't think there was anything special about the flavor or piece of meat at all. The mod mac wasn't great either. I felt like there was something off about it. It wasn't super cheesy and didn't taste like much other than maybe peppers. The only thing I really enjoyed about the meal with the twice baked potato. That was probably the best thing I ate all night. It was cheesy and had a lot of flavor considering the way it was made. For dessert we had the mango panna cotta and that was also good.", "author": "Annie H."}

First, when walking in, it has a cool harlequin theme with dark red velvet booths and random mannequins as decorations. I knew exactly what I wanted coming in and we didn't waste any time in ordering. We got the bone in filet minon (medium), half crab, mac and cheese, brussel sprouts, and twice baked potato. The filet minon was cooked perfectly. It was super tender, seared on the outside and had light seasoning so it totally highlighted the flavor of the steak. I like the medium pieces and the BF likes it a little more rare which is what you get closer to the bone. This was definitely a winning choice. The crab was really good as well. It was fresh, plump, juicy and whatever dipping sauce it came with was so addicting. Definitely another win. Sadly, all the sides were just okay though. The mac and cheese was just mac and cheese, the brussel sprouts was just brussel sprouts and the potato tasted like a potato with a few things on top. I wasn't super impressed by any of it.\n\nOverall though, it was a great meal and I was super satisfied with what I came for. The service was great as well and they also do free valet parking!

Yes this place is definitely quirky from the location on busy Lombard to the loud front sign.  The front entrance is a bit awkward with the bar right at the door but the greeter was friendly and led us to a quiet well lit room 2 floors up.   The 'booth' for the 2 of us felt a bit cramped and the hard wood seats (at 90 degrees) was not the most comfortable for a long dinner.   The server was extremely friendly and attentive but she shredded our cork opening the wine and then spilled some of the wine on the white tablecloth while straining out pieces of cork into a decanter and we dined the rest of the evening with large red splotches.\nWe started with the mussels and they were perfectly done with generous portions and I was a big fan!    The crab bisque soup was pretty good but if a tad salty.   I ordered the bone in filet medium rare and they came shaped round and very thick looking impressive.   However this is where the biggest disappointment happens.   The filet had little flavor and the center was a bit cold (temperature).   It looked like it was cooked medium rare so maybe it was sitting for awhile waiting for us to finish our other courses.   I'm not sure.   Whatever the cause was I did not enjoy the steak.    In retrospect I should have asked the steak to be reheated but then it could have become almost medium.   I recently had a bone in filet at a different steakhouse in the city and it was perfectly done and flavored leaving me craving more.  Unfortunately this was not the case this time.   I wanted to like this place despite the quirks but enjoying the steak is the most important aspect of going to a steakhouse.", "author": "John P."}

The time wait mixed with the cheesy atmosphere dropped this place to a 3.5. There were pictures of clowns in foyer!\n\nWe put in our order and looked at the steaks at the coupe beside us. Beautiful but small. That's why I went with the super in-bone fillet minion, 20oz ($66).  The lady had the 9 oz and we had the Brussels sprouts and twice baked potatoe with a bottle of merlot.\n\nThe food came out and looked amazing. This place isn't well lit (a good thing) which means that pictures don't do this place justice. I doubted that bobo could cook a 20!oz steak to perfection but maybe that's why he's a jester.

When asked about portion sizes and whether or not they would be appropriate for our group he stated, \"Well, I wouldn't know. I don't know how much you can eat.\" with a grin on his face. He continued on after we asked him more about it and refused to give us any sort of indication about portion size. He couldn't dare give any sort of advice to first time diners at this restaurant. Just tell us in your best opinion whether or not it will work for us. Make a guess. Take a stab at it. \n\nWe continue with our order and move on to entrees. On the menu, it clearly suggests that the steaks should be cooked medium rare. Robert asks us for the cook of our steaks, \"how would you like that cooked, medium rare?\" Sounds great to us, we will all have ours that way. However, one of the ladies in our group decides that she doesn't want the steak that rare and would like it medium. We get his attention and she asks for the steak medium. \"That's already what I wrote down? 3 medium filet mignons and one medium rare bone-in New York.\" Nope. That's not what we ordered and we all knew it. Yet again, he absolutely insisted that he wrote it down and heard it correctly, yet again with a smug smart ass tone in his voice. \n\nBy the way, Robert, my New York came out medium to medium well. Hardly any pink on the inside, but I didn't dare mention it to you in fear of you coming up with some \"holier-than-thou\" response from you about how it's cooked perfectly.\n\nRobert, if it were up to me, you would have been lucky to receive even a penny for gratuity from me but luckily our gracious hosts had decided otherwise. Even the best tasting steak in the world could not have compensated for the smart-alec tone you had in your voice all night.

Then after- TOO soon after, our steaks came out. How do I know too soon? Because I have been in the service industry for 6 years and know how courses are timed. So not only were THE SAME steaks brought out from previously, but our server lied and gave no apology. Our server was hardly able to be found even though we were sat at a horrible table right In front of the service station/computer. It was almost appalling how he figured out so many ways to ignore us in such a small setting. He had 3 other tables. It was not busy.

A few years after that, it was still excellent, but not quite as amazing as I remembered. But is anything ever as wonderful as the first time? It was still a very delicious steak. So good that I chose to eat here the night before I had my wisdom teeth pulled. It is always a good idea to have steak if you're told you may experience reduced ability to eat solid foods. \n\nI was running late for our reservation, but thank goodness for complimentary valet. That saved us a few minutes. Positioned on a sloping hill, Bobo's looks like a traditional steakhouse from the outside. Inside is pretty funky. Apparently...\nBoboquivari: venetian court jester of comedy, embodied in a popular Italian marionette\nHmm... but what does that have to do with steak? I could appreciate the unique theme they've got going on. But, on my way to the restroom, I turned my head and my eyes unexpectedly landed on one of the stern-faced jester paintings and freaked myself out a little. Yet, the masks and the tilted picture frames are intriguing. Plus, the curtained booths were definitely a nice touch.\n\nBread - delicious, fluffy, pull-apart loaf, lightly toasted, drizzled with olive oil, golden brown on top\n\nFilet Mignon - Like I mentioned, the steak was juicy and delicious. My knife slid through it almost like spreadable butter. It was springy and buoyant as I pressed against it with my fork. The outside was nicely seared to a brown crust, pink on the inside, with meat juices still flowing. \nThe price points are pretty reasonable. A petite filet is about $40 for 8 ounces, a little more than the typical 6 ounces. The bone-in options are great for people who are partial to the flavor of meat on the bone.\n\nCombo Mussels, Shrimp & 1/2 Crab ($49.95) -\nSince I had their steak before, I wanted to try their sea animals. I believe it comes with clarified butter and lemon garlic sauce. \nMy eyes were bigger than my stomach, because this hot skillet was clearly meant to be shared. The crab and mussels were very sweet and tender. The shrimp was tasting a little oily and the shells were soft and translucent. It was great, but probably better to stick to their steaks.\n\nTwice-Baked Potato (~$9) stuffed with zucchini, chives, fontina cheese -\nCreamy and cheesy, not chalky like a lot of baked potatoes. Twice-baked is the way to go as the skin on the outside was nice and crisp. It was drizzled with sour cream on top that added a mildly creamy tart flavor. I couldn't really taste the zucchini embedded in the potato, but I appreciate that it's in there.\n\nI'd still come back for another awesome steak, maybe ribeye next time.", "author": "Joy W."}

I really did. \n\nI was so excited to hear that my boyfriend made dinner reservations at Bobo's for my birthday this year. To make sure there weren't any issues, my boyfriend and I called them a few days before our dinner to make sure our reservations were in their system. The lady who answered was kind and helpful and told us our reservations were indeed there for Sunday night. \n\nHowever, when we arrived on Sunday, the hostess told us that they didn't have our reservations and asked us to wait so they can see if there were any tables to seat us. Not necessarily sure what happened between that, but we weren't upset and it gave us the opportunity to sit at the bar while we waited. The bar is quite small but had a decent selection of cocktail drinks, wines, and liquor. \n\nAfter being seated, my boyfriend asked for a bottle of sparkling water and I ordered a drink at the bar which still didn't arrive by the time we got seated. The place wasn't packed, but there were a few tables occupied in our section of the restaurant. Our waitress didn't seem that all excited to serve us and we only saw her during the time we ordered our food and when we asked for the dessert menu. The plates were cleared and waters were filled up by another person to all the tables in our section.\n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to go for the Mussels & Shrimp combo to start. Boy, let me tell you , it was delicious! It was probably the only thing that made me want to consider coming back to Bobo's again. I had the Bone-in Filet and my boyfriend had the Bone-in NY Steak. We also ordered brussel sprouts and the twice baked potatoes as our sides.\n\nOur food arrived at a reasonable time, but for the quality in the price you pay for the steak and sides, I was a bit disappointed. The brussel sprouts had no flavor or seasoning whatsoever and I took a bite of the bread and opt out because it was so hard to chew. The steaks were just...okay. It wasn't anything spectacular, and not to downgrade my (awesome) boyfriend's cooking whatsoever, but even HE can cook a meaner steak at home than what we had. With the steaks claiming to be dry-aged for 4-6 weeks, I would imagine a better tasting steak. The variety of steaks offered here aren't as much as other steakhouses which is also a bummer. \n\nFor what the meal cost, I would rather go to the many steakhouses SF has to offer before coming to this one.", "author": "Victoria K."}

This was back in May. She made the reservations and I'm glad she did!\n\nWe got to the restaurant about fifth-teen minutes early. The bar area was where we patiently waited until our scheduled reservation time. We were seated promptly by the hostess and given our menus. A bread basket was given for us to nibble on. We started off by ordering our drinks. A bottle of the 2012 Stuhlmuller vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon was our beverage of choice. \n\nOut of the many appetizer choices, the steak tare tare caught our eyes. We never had it and wanted to try it. The appetizer was something different. I don't usually eat raw meat, but this was pretty tasty. Mixed with raw quail egg and cured with salt and seasonings. Accompanied with toast bread chips, this was a great tasting appetizer.  \n\nFor my main course, I got an order of the Porterhouse. The Porterhouse includes a two pieces of meat: New York steak and petit filet mignon. Both were cooked a medium rare, as I requested. The meats were very juicy and tender. As I cut through them, it just melts like butter. We did order a side of mod mac and cheese. It did compliment our entrees well. \n\nI know that this is a very late review, but I did really enjoy my birthday experience here.", "author": "Jay G."}

Ordered the same seafood combo  and bone in filet. We were first served the seafood combo and when that was done we were given our steaks. However, this time our medium rare steaks looked crispy on the edges and over cooked. Sure enough, my edges were crispy and slightly more cooked than I prefer. My bf received a medium/well steak. Looks like our steaks were sitting as we were eating our apps. I now remember that last time we had our seafood combo and when the steaks were done the waiter brought it right out. I think this the waitress waited until we were done with the seafood then brought our steaks that were prob reheated. They were nice enough to cook my bf a new steak, but it came rare. Like bloody red in the middle ugh it's just very disappointing how a steak can be amazing then horribly cooked at the same place! So inconsistent. And for a steak place, how can you not cook a proper medium rare filet? Not sure if my bf ever wants to come back again...\n\n\n\nInitial visit:\n I'm not a huge meat eater so I don't eat steak often. I do appreciate a nice prime rib from HOPR though. However I'm very hesitant in trying steak houses. Time and time again I encounter steak houses that can not cook a steak and ruin it for me...but my friend were in town for the SF Giants opening day and they wanted to try a new restaurant so we went to Bobo's. I knew I wanted to try the smaller cuts so was going to go with the filet mignon but opted for the bone-in filet mignon because I thought it would have more flavor.\n\nMy friend's girl got the regular filet...when our entrees arrived, hers didn't look as shiny and juicy as mine...when I tasted mine, it was a little salty but super flavorful and tender. There was one bite that was so rich in flavor it almost tasted like the richness you get from eating bone marrow or foies gras! It was absolutely delicious. My buddy tasted a piece of mine and he really enjoyed it, too much to the point that he couldn't eat his NY steak he ordered lol. \n\nWe also got the combo mussels/shrimp/crab. It it was a little underwhelming and very salty!! Crab didn't have much meat and the shrimp was very small. I would expect them to give bigger and more plump shrimp. Mussels were nice and plump though. \n\nThey also serve Mexican Coca Cola (made with real sugar).\n\nBeing that the next day I was wanting more of that bone-in filet mignon, I will def be back for it (but not much else). I just hope I can get the same tasting cut next time!", "author": "Linda L."}

Perhaps it was off day or something - It happens, anyway - Came with four friends and was disappointed with service, and food was OK.  Appetizer was good, and the waiter recommended his last bottle of don't remember exactly what the wine was, but he said we were lucky we got that bottle.  We paid around $150 for the bottle I think and then we looked it up online and it was available for $25 at BevMo.  OK, so I'm not a wine connoisseur, but don't over embellish what you're recommending by that much.   The steak: OK.  We were still eating our appetizers and waiter got frustrated when he brought our steaks and we were still eating appetizers.  When ordering, we asked him to bring the steaks AFTER we finished our appetizers because we were going to be there a while.  That didn't happen and he got upset when we reminded him to bring them after we finished appetizers.  We also walked outside the door on the second floor to check it out since it was open and waiter said we couldn't go out there even though the door was wide open and next to our table.  To sum up, it's how you talk to people and if you get what you pay for right?  Not here.  Brush up on simple courtesy, intonation of your voice, and be real about what your serving and what people are getting for choosing your restaurant.  Oh yeah, they charged us twice, over $530 dollars to the wrong cards.  Classic over promise and way under deliver on food and service.  Not worth the time or money.

You don't finish your salad to save room for steak. You can't finish your steak because you ate too much of your baked potato.

You can entertain the idea of ordering something else, but to be honest, I'd go directly to this and leave the rest alone.  Service wise, our waitress seemed a little overstretched and seemed a little lost when it came down to collecting glasses, plates, used utensils, and even ordering.  Still though, she was very nice, and very patient with the amount of wine we had brought and were ordering. The only thing that irked me a little was that in asking for water, I got a teeny tiny water glass and had to ask for it to be filled at least three before someone came around regularly. I totally get why people come here, and you can be that I'll definitely be back here for that steak again!", "author": "Lisa I."}

I've been here a bunch of times and hands down the best steak in the city.  My wife and I went here to celebrate the new year.  Ordered my steak Medium and it came out rare.  I let our server know it wasn't cooked correct and he took the steak away from the table.  He brought my steak back out and it was the same steak that I sent back because I had cut a big chuck out and realized it was rare.  When it was brought back it was now medium to medium well and the piece that was cut was well done.  I called the waiter over and told him I didn't want the steak anymore and he took it away.  He didn't charge me for the steak which is normal.  I'm just disappointed that the steak wasn't cooked right and then they tried to serve me the same steak again and it still wasn't right.

The chilis didn't have any spice or flavor and I didn't really taste the ponzu either.\n\nNext we had the crab and mussels but the mussels were rotten. Not just old and fishy but putrid, like poo-poo. If you've ever eaten a bad oyster or mussel you know what I'm talking about. My girlfriend and friends found a couple that were ok but we didn't touch most of them.\n\nThe crab on the other hand was pretty tasty, but every now and then we would get this strange flavor we couldn't figure out that would make our mouths go numb. It wasn't peppery, spicy, minty, or really any flavor I can describe, but it had a numbing effect that wasn't enjoyable.\n\nAfter that we had bone-in filets cooked medium rare, except by the time we got them they were closer to medium/medium well. Perhaps I'm just being difficult, but if I'm spending $52 on a medium rare steak then I want it to be cooked medium rare, not medium/ medium well - so I sent it back. \n\nWhen the waitress brought out my 2nd filet and I cut into it, the first slice was raw, purple meat. I sliced into the rest of the steak and it was the same. At this point I just said nevermind and lost my appetite. The Argentinian Malbec was quite nice for what it's worth though... \n\nAnyway, the waitress said she was sorry but that was pretty much the extent of it. The manager didn't come out, no one offered to cook something else... like there was no problem I was leaving without having dinner even though our bill was $450. \n\nSo here I am, sitting at home eating a bowl of cereal for dinner instead of Bobo's while I write this review.

I ordered the filet, which is one of my all time favorites here. Sadly, they sent out an oddly shaped cut that was completely burnt on the bottom. \n\nAs you may know, Bobo's uses cat iron pans as their cooking vessels so I can forgive a rustic crust, but that steak was burnt. The bartender took my steak back and re-fired a new steak. \n\nThe new steak came back clearly burnt on the top and bottom. Even though I knew it was burnt, I tasted it to be sure and it was. Now, with my dining companion halfway through dinner (a perfectly cooked filet by the way) and the sides cold, the bartender just stood there unsure what to do when I said this too was burnt. \n\nNext, a person behind him that works at the restaurant speaks just loud enough for me to hear his off-handed comment: \"we cook with cast iron. That's supposed to be how it is cooked\". Of course I spoke up and asked why he is getting involved and if he would like to taste my steak, which of course he didn't. \n\nNow things have escalated and I'm angry. The bartender did nothing to help and the other guy just walked away with a smug smile on his face. \n\nThe bartender offered to get the manager but no manager ever showed. My steak was comped with no apology and the rest of the bill included all other items, even the cold sides I never enjoyed because I did not have a plate. \n\nBobo's has had their ups and downs with me but I feel they are just no longer a decent place to go, especially with a clear lack of management, poor customer service skills, and inability to cook their steaks properly and consistently.", "author": "William R."}

We were running late because some asshole wanted to throw fireworks in front of a bus we were behind. So I called to let them know we were on our way. The guy on the phone told us that it was fine and not to worry about it. \n\nWhen we got there, there was no one at the Valet stand, so I went down to get someone. The guy went out there right away! Not even a minute when my husband came in to meet me we were seated. \n\nWe were greeted right away from our server, Teo K. He gave us water right when we sat down and gave us our menus. We didn't have to wait.\n\nHe recommended a cocktail for me because I wanted Malibu Pineapple, but they didn't have Malibu rum. He recommended a drink called Rum Baba. It had Captail Morgan Rum, Blood Orange, and Pineapple. It was good, but I didn't get buzz at all. I felt like I didn't taste any rum.\n\nWe ordered a Lobster Crostini, which had lobster, avocado, and garlic aioli served on top of a toasted bread. It came out less than 5 mins after we ordered it. It came with only 2 pieces for $17.95. However, it was really good! The bread was toasted perfectly, they were generous with the lobster, they had this really good white glob in between the Lobster Crostinis. Not sure what that was, but it was super delicious!\n\nThen my husband for the 20oz ribeye. He wanted it cooked medium well and that's exactly how they cooked it. He says it was really good, flavorful, and tender. He says the chefs really know how to cook a medium-well ribeye steak.\n\nI was going to get the combination with mussels, shrimp, and crab. But I asked our waiter if the crab was a whole crab and he said it was half crab. So I got the double shrimp and double crab. Yes, just for me!! It was a $55.95 dish, but it was well worth it. The garlic flavors on the crab and shrimp was too perfect. There was the right amount of seasonings. Oh my yum!! \n\nAs for our sides, we got the twice baked potato and the mod Mac and Cheese. I have to say the sides were good, but my crab and shrimp dish made me forget about the sides because my food was just too good. I couldn't stop eating! \n\nFor dessert, you must get the mango panna cotta. It had this flan type texture. It basically melts in your mouth. We also got the strawberry cheesecake. I wasn't really feeling the cheesecake. It was a bit tough. I never had to really chew cheesecake before.  \n\nI would definitely come here again. The service was great! The food was amazing!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-31", "description": "Bobo's is an interesting restaurant. I thought it would be a high end, classy steakhouse but the interior decoration was actually very unique - red walls and curtains, and some interesting paintings, I felt like I was eating in a circus... not in a bad way though. It's always good to have some sort of uniqueness. It's a tiny restaurant which end up creating a pretty loud environment. So this is not a place for romantic dates but rather for friends gatherings.\n\nI went with a friend on a Saturday night at 7:30pm (reservations made ~1 week ago). We were right on time, and were seated around 10 mins later. Started off by ordering two cocktails - Q-ball and Moscow Mojito. Both drinks were okay but ice amount was a bit excessive which kind of dilute the drinks a little bit.\n\nOur server had a friendly attitude and was quite attentive, however she didn't seem to care much about what we were ordering like giving suggestions, or how we were doing throughout the meal. Would have appreciated if there is a bit more of conversations engagement with the customers.\n\nDouble Crab and Mussels on iron-plate: B.\nFirst of all, the portion was pretty big. Lots of mussel (small size type) and one big crab in the middle. The sauce had some sort of unique roasted pepper + garlic flavor. Although the mussels could not really absorb the taste, but butter / olive oil (?) were provided as dipping sauce and they definitely played a crucial role to enhance the mussel taste. For the crab, the shell was all covered by the roasted pepper/garlic, but I think it was a little bit overcooked. The shell of the crab legs were pre-cracked and it still took quite a bit of effort trying to crack them open, which is not a convenient thing to do at a high end restaurant. The crab meat tasted pretty bland and dipping sauces were still required.\n\nBone-in New York (Medium Rare): B+.\nI had mixed feeling about this steak. I really like the texture - super tender and juicy, and as some fellow Yelpers mentioned the portion closer to the bone were also cooked till medium rare which was a big plus. Cooking skill couldn't be doubted. However, the steak definitely needs a bit more flavor - I got tired after finishing half of it because of the lack of flavor from the sauce.\n\nI also tried my friend's bone-in filet mignon. Personally I like the New York better. Somehow I think the New York managed to have slightly more flavor than the mignon, although again both were on the bland side.\n\nMac and Cheese: B.\nSaw a lot of good reviews about this but I wasn't impressed. I think it was kind of over cooked again... Was it just me? I have had a lot more better ones at other steakhouses. \n\nStrawberry Cheesecake: B.\nNothing special. My friend said the sauce on top of the cheesecake was kind of salty which I agree. Other than that it was an ordinary piece of cheesecake.\n\nThe bill ended up to be ~$210 plus tips. Honestly with this price tag I think I could have gone to places a lot better than Bobo's. But again, I think the steak cooking skill is quite exceptional, now just need to add some more flavors to that and it would be perfect.", "author": "Simon C."}

I would totally come here for more mussels! \n\nBone in filet mignon: 4/5: it was my first time trying this cut and well I can say that it was tasty for the most part except closer to the bone. I ordered it medium rare and they did a good job of that. The only part I did not like about this cut is that once you get closer to the bone it's almost practically raw. Not my favorite but my boyfriend was happy to finish it for me. Next time I get a steak here I'll probably go with a petite filet for more even cooking. \n\nOverall, a great date place.

Came here for Valentines day dinner and enjoyed the experience from top to bottom. It looks like this place was once a house that has been converted into a restaurant, but I'm not going to pin that as a fault. They also offer complimentary valet services, which is very nice for a place in SF as parking is always a pain in the ass. \n\nI'm not quite sure origin of the name to this place, but I'm guessing it's an Italian or French clown as this place had a European Clown type of vibe. I'm a huge fan of the circus, so also a big bonus for me. The service was great. Not Alexander's great, but great. (I really need to stop mentioning Alexander's in my steak house reviews) \n\nThey start you off with some great, which has an olive type of taste, but it needed butter. Bread and butter go hand in hand, so it was a little odd that they didn't offer breads beast friend. The steak's were all great. The bone-in filet is what they are known for, so it didn't take much to convince the gf to go for that. It was cooked perfect medium rare for optimal flavor. Remember kids, when it comes to steak get it cooked medium rare! The mac and cheese were pretty good, but the mushroom needed some more flavor. You're paying $8.95 for chopped mushrooms. You better add some flavor! \n\nOverall, I liked it again. I'm not sure when I'll come again, as my quest takes me to many different steak houses.

It was:\n\nDUNCE CAP CONE (4) - $8.95\nFour cones filled with dark chocolate mousse over ancho chili pepper chocolate sauce. \nSo she gave us one of these, but I loved it so much I ordered one set (4) to go for my mom.  I KNOW she would love this!  The mousse part is light and not too sweet with the combination of the crunchy waffle!  LOVED it!\n\nLois was a huge part of why my first experience here was so wonderful.  I had an amazing time.  She really took care of us and we appreciate her so much.  Oh and valet parking is free which is a plus!  I know how muc SF suck when it comes to parking, haha.  I loved how this place is decorated so nicely in the Venetian theme.  LOVED it!  I loved the quiet romantic ambiance.  I really do hope to come back again.  :)", "author": "Tu-Anh N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-12-29", "description": "When your server's first instinct is to insult you?  That's a bad sign, and I wish we'd taken the hint! \n\nBirthday celebrating in SF included lunch at Little Star (since pizza is my favorite, like last-meal-before-death favorite), some bar hopping, and then a nice steak dinner... or so we thought.  \n\nWe were seated without incident at an upstairs table by a faux fireplace in a small room with maybe 10 little 2-seater tables.  Only half were occupied, and the room was quiet.  We perused the menus for a short time--  Then our server, Ponytail Michael, greeted us, and proceeded to make jokes about us being \"virgins\" (our first visit to Bobo's... & thx in part to him, our LAST visit as well) while making weird wanna-be-French groans & sounds?!?!  \n\nAfter spouting off EVERY menu item, as if we hadn't read the menu at all, and calling EVERY item \"exquisite,\" he started to walk away...  he didn't ask (or know) that we were ready to order drinks & appetizers so I called him back.  A beer for him, a cocktail for me, Yellowtail Carpaccio appetizer, and I asked if I could sample the Lobster Soup?  It was the only soup they had, and I'm not a huge seafood person.  With an appalled expression, he replies, \"No, this isn't Baskin Robbins; it's made to order.\"  \n\nTHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUR CUE TO EXIT!  But, of course, we naively stayed.  \n\nHis famous first words to EVERY TABLE in that small, quiet room were \"exquisite\" like 7 times in one sentence & \"liquid food\" for the \"ladiieeesss!!\"  As if women are just wino-drunkards who can't think straight without their \"liquid food!\"  I heard his lines at every new seating for over an hour, sooooo lame & classless.  \n\n2 or 3-star food, at best, unless we went on an off night??  Which I doubt given some of the reviews from regulars referencing the steady decline of this once-great establishment. \n\nSERVICE: \n\nPonytail Michael never brought complimentary bread; he never came by to see if we were enjoying the appetizers (namely the soup that I had questions about); he never came by to see if we needed anything (like another round of \"liquid food\" haha); we had to flag him down for our check--  which ended up taking, LITERALLY, 15 minutes to bring out!!  We had to cancel the Uber request because he wouldn't bring us our dang check! \n\nOverall... unprofessional, not welcoming or friendly, a bit impatient, inattentive, inconsiderate of our time, condescending in an attempt to be \"uppity\" though it failed miserably & only made him look like a charlatan clown (the greasy ponytail didn't help).  \n\nFOOD: \n\n**The Lobster Soup looked & tasted terrible.  3 tiny chunks of lobster (which didn't bother me, but just fyi to all seafood lovers), unappealing grey broth whose texture was thicker than thieves & whose flavor was ruined by too much salt... or perhaps someone let it cook down too far??  Don't know, don't care, just don't order it.  \n\n**The Yellowtail Carpaccio tasted like straight raw vinegar & its texture was like chewing on gooy, slightly slimy, wet tissue paper.  Utterly FOUL.  \n\n**The Twice Baked Potato was crunchy, and not in a good, crispy-on-top kind of way.  More like someone forgot the TWICE because it was pretty undercooked!  And it was barely warm on top with a frigid interior... meaning cooked previously & refrigerated & then not heated through.  The flavor wasn't bad; it was just difficult to keep eating it, YUCK! \n\n**The Swiss Chard was pretty amazing!!  Probably the best thing we'd tasted all night, and that's sad for a steakhouse.  Too bad we hadn't ordered 3 portions of it & none of the other sides/ apps. \n\n**The steaks:  He ordered the bone-in New York; I ordered the bone-in Filet.  Both were cooked perfectly, but someone forgot to season his!  Just super bland... especially after we traded bites...  that's when he really knew his was lacking.  Mine, however, was freakin' good!!  Thankfully too because it was MYYYY Bday, only fitting that I end up with a decent steak (I'm usually the one who gets the crappy meal... cold, undercooked, missing key ingredients, plastic wrap in it, hair, it's always MINE that's messed up somehow!!  So this was a welcome & timely change of events). \n\nPRESENTATION: \n \nSub par on soooo many levels...  see pics. \n\n**Grey, vomit-colored soup?  Not very appetizing.   \n\n**Goopy, sloppy looking carpaccio?  It's supposed to be clean, crisp, & refreshing.  Imagine limp sushi?!  Yeah, no.  I'm actually surprised we're not physically ill from it.  \n\n**Messy, greasy, steak juice all over the EDGES of our plates?  Uumm not good!  What happened to wiping that clean? \n\nNeedless to say, \"we're never, ever, ever getting back together\" with this place :(  Not even if it were free.

I know this is a place known for their steaks, so I refrained from reviewing.  \nMy last trip to Bobo's I ordered half a crab and a twice baked potato.  Before I get too lost in the moment I would like to mention that the crab was delectable.  It's messy, but absolutely yummy.  OK, now for the important bit, the bit that got me to change my mind about reviewing Bobo's, the TWICE BAKED POTATO.  I swear on all things pancakes, that this was the best twice baked potato I have ever had in my entire life. The taste was exquisite-creamy and perfectly seasoned, the texture was PERFECT.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-12-21", "description": "In terms of service, this place is a Bobo-NO-NO! \n\nMy sister AKA Thine Stultifying Light AKA The Divine Reason I Breathe AKA My Everything made dinner reservations at Bobo's for her birthday well in advance and was excited to test the digs out. Renowned for their crab, steaks and side dishes that include some type of twice baked potato, Boboquivari's had come recommended from a few friends and that was enough for us. \n\nBobo's gets points for complimentary valet service, which is a must in the city. But from the moment we hopped out of the car, all \"point\"-age came to a screeching halt. It was raining pretty hard, but apparently the upper level is known to get hot as Hades so they like to keep the door open. Of the two available booths open, our party was placed closest to this gaping formation of fierce monsoon level winds and all around deluge. I asked our hostess, Anya, if the door would remain open throughout the duration of our visit and she said she couldn't say for certain but that she would check in with our waiter. \n\nThis is where everything goes south. Not in a tropical, birds of paradise, cue the steelpan drum sense; this is around the time that we meet Robert D., our server for the evening. The anachronistic fly in the ointment, that pernicious little platter-propeller. I could end this whole review now and sum up our experience in five words: Robert made our experience horrible. He did so by being in inattentive and totally unavailable server. Other restaurant patrons, to the best of my knowledge, were provided with complimentary bread, which we never received from Robert, even after asking numerous times. When we were able to locate him, what we found instead of exemplary service was a condescending attitude. When we asked questions about dishes or ingredients, Robert treated us as if our questions were some sort of personal offense. To make matters worse, Robert seemed to be a gratuitous, and helpful server to every other table, including the one just to our left and just across the way, easily within earshot. Just imagine a waiter that's Delphine LaLaurie to your family alone but Betty White to every other table in their section.  \n\nBut it's imperative that we note the good, too! This can be done by highlighting the real star of the show: my main man, Jose. After trudging up and down the staircase in desperate search of the elusive chanteuse known as Robert, I gave up right around the time I found this sweetheart named Jose. Jose gets things done, like getting you bread when you're hungry and explaining meal ingredients and crab preparation. Jose, you have my heart.\n\nAs I mentioned above, it was my sister's birthday. She mentioned it, I mentioned it, my brother-in-law mentioned it, and my brother-in-law's brother chimed in, just to see if it made any difference. I'll be damned if at the end of our horrible dinner, Robert doesn't saunter up to the patrons at the next table, extract a slice of chocolate cake from some nearby surface, rouse a group of servers up and put on a damn performance as we are literally hanging on by a thread of patience, having had about all we can take of being ignored, spoken down to and disregarded. That last initial fits him perfectly! Definitely will not be coming back to Bobo's. \n\n(But again, thank you so much to Anya and Jose!)", "author": "Gabrielle T."}

The only thing I knew before visiting is that Bobo's is one of SF's known places to enjoy a steak. Here are my thoughts about my experience:\n\nWe ordered a caesar salad, the filet minion, crab, twice baked potato, and crab mac and cheese.\n\nPROS\nMy friend and I arrived for our 7:30pm dinner reservation, and we were greeted nicely and promptly seated. (It was a Tuesday night though, so I assume it wasn't nearly as busy as it might be on a weekend.)\n\nThe filet mignon was delicious! The twice baked potato was tasty too.\n\n\nCONS\nOur waiter was pushy and obnoxious, not likable. I asked for my steak to be prepared medium well and he rudely told me no, saying they would do medium at the highest. Um okay... That's fine I guess but why the rudeness? His attitude made me want to leave.\n\nOur salad arrived at our table, and two minutes later our entrees arrived. We only had a bite of our salads at that point! The staff apologized, but at a restaurant like this I would expect that this kind of timing issue would not happen.\n\nOur table was close to the door, so the cold air from outside definitely made it chilly at our table and unfortunately helped to cool off our food too quickly. \n\nMy water glass stayed empty for most of the time I was eating my entree.\n\nThe crab was nothing special. Not worth the money. So disappointing.\n\nThe decor was a bit cheesy and parts of it were very dusty.\n\n\nOVERALL\nI wouldn't go back to Bobo's. I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not impressed and won't waste the money or the time trying the restaurant again.", "author": "Ali M."}

Thankfully they were very understanding and reassured me that it would be no problem at all.  \n\nWhen we finally arrived, we were greeted with a smile and led to our semi private table which was pretty romantic.  The place was dimly lit and decorated in a sort of Moroccan theme with lanterns hanging from the ceiling.  There was Frank Sinatra playing in the background and the vibe was just relaxing after a long day.  \n\nAfter careful thought, we decided to order the Bone In Filet Minion, the cranberry walnut and blue cheese salad, and the mac and cheese side.  We also ordered the loaded baked potatoe side.  Before our courses arrived, the waiter brought some bread which seemed to be flavorful and infused with garlic.  Everything was pretty good.  The Filet Minion can perfectly medium rare.  The salad was refreshing and not too vinegary.  The mac and cheese was just ok.  it was good, but after a couple of bites you get tired of the flavor.

We got there a little early and we were a little under dressed..it was a hot weekend and i was wearing some daisy dukes..opps. anyway, people here wear a little bit more clothes than i was, and I felt a little out of place.

Since they're known for their bone-in filet, we each got that and my friend ordered it with the crab.\n\nThe food came out pretty fast, starting with the salad. I thought the salad had too much dressing, but it was still good.

So instead, I request if I can have mussels instead. The filet mignon... was to die for. It was absolutely one of the best filet mignon I ever had in my life. The mussels were also very good.

I've had better tasting steaks for lower prices before but for a date night, it is definitely an experience most can appreciate. \n\nI recommend the bone in filet mignon and twice baked potato. Both we delicious and were also highly recommended by the employees of the establishment.

I had always ordered crab, which is really great. I got the ribeye this time round, and it was completely amazing.

The baked potato side really stood out.

Decent crowd outside of the fact that this one lady behind me didn't stop (loudly) talking about politics for 2 hours but the food was incredible. \n\nApps: The crab legs have this Cajun spice seasoning and were delicious.  Also had the steak tartare and lobster crostini. Both were excellent but would vote the crostini over the tartare. \n\nSteak: Ordered the New York strip and super bone-in filet. FYI medium rare is more of the rare scale, which is actually cool with me, but a heads up for others. Not much seasoning on the steak which really made the quality of the steak and the expertise of how well it was cooked, stand out. Both were charred black on the outside and had a nice crisp. Inside was incredibly moist, bleeding and succulent. I'm from NYC and would put this against any of the big boys back home. \n\n\nSides: In order of taste: twice baked potatoes (must get), brussel sprouts, cauliflower and Mac & cheese. \n\nNegatives: Apps and sides could have been a little bigger and was a little disappointed with how small they were.

This was a great cut of meat aged over 10day. Soft easy cut with lots of flavor, this was a choice steak. The grilling was done pan style likely with butter and the medium rare I chose was done to slight perfection. Not easy to get a bone in type steak done perfect through out the whole thing, they did a great job.\n\nCrab was excellent. These things are cooked in some broth or marinade or something that adds a level amount of salt and such that pops nicely and makes for a good sideline to the steak.\n\nThe crab cake was not exciting. Won't waste time writing about that.\n\nBrussels sprouts sucked. Soggy boring and only part about these was picking out the bacon.\n\nBread is excellent. I can't get enough damn sourdough in this town.\n\nDrinks are strong, they are prepared well too, my Hendricks tonic had a slice of cucumber in it. Liked that.\n\nService was decent, nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nThe dining room and ambiance was excellent. Lots of cool stuff around, the music is funny though. I haven't heard \"eye of the tiger\" in a high end steak house in...ever.\n\nSo to end, I would come back. I won't waste time expectations or money on their weak ass sides though.

I made reservations 2 months earlier for 7:15. When we got there at 7:10, the hostess told me they were running really late behind, so we could sit at the bar which was right behind the hostess stand. The bar was packed and there was only a side table to sit at. People were standing all over the bar like sardines. Wait staff that were passing us, and people in the bar with food, would hit the tables (that we were sitting on) or we would have to duck not to be hit by the trays. We finally got sat at 8:15 (an hour later). I ordered a filet mignon and crab legs. I've honestly had better at Outback Steakhouse. I was so excited to come here and experience great San Francisco dining, but customer service and food were very disappointing.

The place is tight but downright cozy.\n+ Bone in filet mignon is one of the best dry-aged steaks I've ever had. Medium rare is obviously the way to go. Try 16 oz ($51.95) or 20 oz ($66.95).\n+ Service was spectacular. Renaud made a great explanation of the menu and his recommendations. He appeared at all the right moments to ensure service was attentive without being overdone.\n+ Yellowtail carpaccio ($15.95) was a light appetizer that was an easy start to a highly caloric meal. Seasoned well.\n\nNo on seconds -'s:\n- Seating was deplorable. We had a 7:45 and didn't get seated till 8:15. That's fine because we were promised a booth upstairs. When we were seated, we were seated in the open. Another couple who had arrived AFTER us was seated in the coveted spot. The hostesses had miscommunicated with one another and did not offer anything but a mere \"sorry.\" We had two drinks comped (we should not have to be the ones to ask for it) but it failed on so many rounds. Unacceptable compensation for wasting our time for a special occasion.\n- The menu is dated. Nothing inventive here. If you want middle of the road then by all means this is what you will get: twice baked potato ($9.95 for one potato), modern mac and cheese ($9.95), brussel sprouts, standard salads and the tiring chocolate cake with raspberry. We are stuck in the 80s.\n- The birthday surprise (usually $2) is an ice cream cone served upside down on a plate with a small spoonful of chocolate mousse, a raspberry and two mint leaves. I don't get it but it's free if you want it for your birthday.\n\nBeing locals of SF and the Bay Area for over 20 years, we love supporting great restaurants.

Price aside, I didn't find the food that tasty either.  I ordered the surf & turf (bone-in ribeye with crab), along with the mod mac and twice baked potato for sides.  I usually order my steak medium rare, but when I got my plate, the steak seemed way too pink for my liking, and more on the rare side.  I had to ask the waiter if this was correct, but apparently that's how they cook their steak.  The steak was very soft, chewy, and also runny.  The crab was good, because it's drenched in garlic butter.  The mod mac was decent, but if you're only going to get one side, then I would recommend the twice baked potato.  It's so good!\n\nOverall, I'd expect to have the best meal I ever had for the price I paid.  The portion size is very filling, but the food itself wasn't to my liking.

Very convenient since parking is a bit difficult to find in & within the Lombard radius. \n\n2. The decor is eclectic but warm & inviting. Reminds me of the 1960s...There is a bar as you walk in, to your right are tables for small groups & couples, upstairs is for bigger groups enough to fit maybe 3 large groups of 8. Restrooms are upstairs too. \n\n3. The food. Started off with a big loaf of freshly baked garlic bread with a crunchy crust and bits of baked garlic on the surface. \n\n4. Bone in filet mignon - oh my God!! It's the bomb! There aren't a lot of steakhouses that serve bone in dry aged steaks but this one won the trophy! It's very tender (med rare of course) and made me want to pick it up with my fingers and eat it like the way I do with fried chicken. My husband did this and the Neanderthal man came out of him. Lol!

This time, I opted for Bobo's mainly so I could get my steak and my mom could get her fish. \n\nI showed up at 5PM, right when they open. They do have complimentary valet, which is a plus since parking can be a pain in this area.\n\nTheir decor is super awesome. It almost feels like walking through a Mardi Gras parade with all the costumes and decorations. Their music choice was a bit random with old school stuff and slightly too loud for background music. \n\nThe layout was a little weird too. This place is slightly cramped, which probably explains their 3 story set up. They have a bar to hang out at on the first floor.\n\nWe were seating immediately. We ended up ordering the crab cakes and the lobster soup for appetizers. The crab cakes and the perfect amount of crisp. I wasn't a fan of the soup though. It was too much curry and not enough soup. It felt like I was straight up drinking curry. They also came out with their house bread with garlic sauce. Man, that sauce! If you enjoy garlic, you will enjoy this.\n\nI opted for the bone-in filet. I usually order medium rare and hope for the best. Here, I ordered a medium rare and got a medium rare! What a treat! It was very delicious, tender and filling!\n\nWe ended up ordering 3 sides for the table: Loaded potatos, mushrooms and brussel sprouts. The loaded potato was sooo gooood! Every bite was a potato overload! You must order this! The brussels sprouts were really delicious too! Then again, not many people like brussels sprouts My brother enjoyed the mushrooms a lot but I felt like they put too much olive oil sauce in it. Maybe that's just me though. \n\nMy mom also ordered the basa fish. They cooked that fish PERFECTLY! If I wasn't biased for my love of steak, I would almost say that the fish was way better!\n\nFor dessert, we all shared the dunce cap cones and the mango wanna cotta. I normally LOVE mango more, but the dunce cap cones were amazing. The chocolate was sooo rich, even my mom, who's not a chocolate eater loved it. The mango was not too sweet, which I appreciated. \n\nOverall, I've very satisfied with my meal. Great job, Bobo's!", "author": "Jessica Y."}

The bone adds flavor and dimension. I've had both, on different occasions of course, and it will always be the Bone-in Filet hands down. They give you their gigantic carving knife to cut into a steak so soft and juicy; it cuts like butter. It practically melts in your mouth. And I love mine medium rare with a nice full-bodied red. The twice baked potato was great as well. I always get it. The sweet potato is alright, it's not my favorite and it's very small portioned. The Mac and cheese is pretty good, I liked it, very cheesy. I would still choose the twice baked potato over the Mac and cheese but that's just my preference. \n\nA good starter are the Crab cakes, they're great and they come with cranberry on the side which pair really nicely together. The Apples, walnuts, sun dried cranberries salad are great as well, it comes with bleu cheese and a tasty vinaigrette to open your palate. I love the garlic shrimp, they're delicious and they come with a thing of melted butter to dip. Down side is they come with shells but it's not that bad to peel. And if your not full and want to top yourself off with dessert, the mango panna cotta is my fave. Nice, light and creamy. \n\nLet me not forget to tell you, they give you amazing bread to eat while waiting for you food. It's thick and seasoned well. I love it.

Jack truly enjoyed the Rib-Eye and said the Chef at Bobo's really knows how to cook a medium-rare steak. He said it was like butter to cut and an excellent taste. We also ordered a couple of sides (actually our eyes were probably bigger than our stomach!), we had the Twice-Baked Potato, which was so different as it was stuffed with zucchini, chives & fontina cheese.    The skin even had a crunch to the skin & was drizzled with sour cream. To Die For!!!  The other side was the Portobello Mushrooms which went perfectly with Jack's steak and my garlic-y seafood.  Soooooo good! We even forced ourselves to have the Strawberry Cheesecake, it was fluffy and almost the texture of a tiramisu.  Scrumptious!\n\nThe service was spot on!  Our waiter was friendly and helpful, but seemed to have too many tables to wait on. No real complaints, however. \n\nComplimentary valet parking. My first time at Bobo's. Jack's second.  Definately recommend for a special occasion. Like I said, the ambience is definately unique. Swanky, nice vibe.", "author": "Janet T."}

I read the reviews and it seemed everybody else agreed this was the best bone-in filet they had ever had. \n\nWe had the first reservation of the evening, and it was pretty dead in there. Our waitress was really nice and super on top of everything.\n\nFor drinks we all had different cocktails and they were all very good. I liked my Moscow Mojito very much, a perfect combo of two of my favorite cocktails.\n\nWe started with salads and soup. My boyfriend had the Baby Blue and it was awesome. A very large wedge salad with tons of blue cheese, a delicious creamy dressing, and lots of chunks of pancetta. My Lobster soup was amazing, if you like curry, you must order this! It was a very flavorful, delicious soup. \n\nThey also bring about half a loaf of bread to the table that has roasted garlic all over the top, and the garlic flavor had permeated the bread. It was wonderful, and was a perfect bread to sop up my soup with. \n\nAll of us ordered the bone-in filet. It was HUGE! The menu didn't say how many ounces it was, but it had to have been at least 10. And at only $45 it was a great deal. Was it the best filet I had ever had? No. We all felt it was under-seasoned, but it wasn't bad. Perhaps people think it is the best because you get so much meat for such a low price. Either way, it was a good filet, just not one that would make me run back here to have again.\n\nOverall, a good dinner. I think the soup and salads were what made me push this place to a four instead of a three.", "author": "Randi B."}

I have tried both their Porterhouse Steak and their Bone In Filet Mignon Steak cooked to medium, and it they were both delicious!  Their beef is aged to perfection for it to be so tender.  And each cut is quite on the lean side with minimal amounts of fat on the sides.\n\nThe Porterhouse was huge, and was cooked medium.  It wasn't dry at all, and it came out perfectly.  The meat was so tender and flavorful that I devoured it like a hungry growing boy.\n\nThe Filet Mignon with a bone was also tastefully prepared! It was cooked to medium and the steak was thick.  The aroma was as good as it tastes, with just the perfect amount of flavor. The steak was tender and easy to eat. \n\nWe also ordered sides of brussel sprouts and macaroni n cheese.  The brussel sprouts was tender, but may be a bit overcooked... while the mac n cheese was good but wish it was a bit more flavorful if there was more garlic added.  But no complaints because we need side orders to enhance our steaks.  \n\nI also ordered a side of Arugula Salad which is lettuce mixed with honey roasted walnuts with dried pears and cranberries, cherry tomatoes, parmesan cheese and an oil and vinegar dressing.  It was delicious!  The vinegar dressing was a bit on the sour side, while the pear and cranberries neutralized it with a touch of sweetness. Oh my... I loved it.\n\nThe waiter was really attentive to our party.  He made sure the dirty dishes were put away, and kept filling our glasses with water, while kept asking if we needed anything else.  He was very nice and professional which is a huge plus.\n\nWe made reservations and had to wait a little longer than anticipated for them to get our table ready.  Yes, we had a large party since it was a friend's birthday dinner, and the steakhouse was a bit on the squishy side.  I felt a bit on the claustrophobic side since it was crowded inside with little room to maneuver.  The whole restaurant is well kept and it's decor made the ambiance more on the classy side. \n\nLooking for parking on the street will be tough.  So it's better to have your car parked by the valet parking attendant.  It's free! Just tip him a couple bucks when you come out.\n\nYes, this is a wonderful place to enjoy a delicious steak.

Unfortunately we had dinner here and were pretty disappointed. The service was not good and food was average at best. We ordered the dungeness crab crostini and heirloom toy box tomatoes appetizers, two full dungeness crabs, bone-in filet, a few orders of macaroni and cheese (mod mac), and desserts. The crab was great, but everything else was either average or terrible. The mac and cheese was hardly edible (my entire party of 4 felt this way - it tasted so bad that none of us could stomach it). Before coming here, I didn't even know you could screw up mac and cheese! \n\nService was also bad. The waiter asked if we would like our appetizers before our crab/steak main dishes. We said yes, we want our appetizers first. Of course, we get the two dungeness crabs first. About half an hour later, we finally get our appetizers. To make matters worse, my aunt's steak did not come until an hour later - after me and my uncle had already finished our crab..... it was pretty unfortunate. She just sat there eating alone until finished. I don't think I've ever experienced such sloooooow service.\n\nDessert was okay, but nothing memorable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-01", "description": "Came here for a birthday dinner, reservations at 6:30. The hostess wanted to seat us at a very small 2-top in the bar area, with a view to Lombard Street. I let the hostess know that we would be ordering a lot of food and that the table was too small. She didn't seem pleased and told me it would be about 10 minutes before another table opened up. Not a problem in my book. I'll sacrifice a view and wait for a bigger table, just so someone's butt isn't bumping into my elbow every 2 minutes.\n\nOur waiter Anthony (love the French accent!) greeted us cordially. Ordered straight away: double mussels, double crab, one super bone-in filet mignon, one bone-in filet mignon, lobster mac and cheese, swiss chard, double baked potato, cauliflower, and portobello mushrooms.  The music was great, some good 70s and 80s pop, rock, R&B.\n\nThe mussels come out on a sizzling hot platter; ladies, you might want to rethink what outfit or top you are wearing. It's sizzling hot butter and soy sauce that splatters! The soy sauce is added when brought to the table...almost like how the Chinese add the soy sauce to the steamed bass once it's out on the table. The added Dijon to the clarified butter for dipping was delish. The mussels, being steamed, don't have much flavor, but swirl it around with the butter and soy sauce and you are good to go.\n\nThe crab came next. It also is served on an iron platter, but there is no splattering here. I really can't speak to the crab, as I was too busy peeling the shell off for the birthday boy. And, I wanted to save my appetite for the steak.\n\nIt took longer for the steaks to come out, but the wait was OK, because it allowed the food to settle! When our main course did arrive, so did the all the sides. The steaks were perfectly cooked and HUGE. This is not your typical 6 oz. filet. My man's was 20+oz. and about 2 inches thick at a minimum. My filet was not much smaller. Good overall flavor and char. I'm not sure what all the hype is about the double baked potato...mind you, this is coming from a gal who likes her carbs, particularly my spuds! The lobster mac and cheese wasn't anything to write home about. First, it was shells and not macaroni: it was bland as though it was not drained well, not that cheesy, and oddly, a bit spicy. I like spicy and while it helped with the flavor, I would have preferred more cheese. The swiss chard was garlicky good...the mushrooms tangy from some sort of vinegar that was not balsamic (a bit too tangy, in fact)...and the steamed cauliflower had dried garlic or something similar garnishing the top. The swiss chard and the cauliflower were the winners. On  any other night, with a bit less vinegar, the mushrooms would likely be a good choice.\n\nNext time, we'll know what to do: pass on the lobster mac and cheese and order the crab cakes.\n\nGet here earlier. The vibe, once it hit 8pm, got a little weird. For example, the table right next to us, with 3 apparently \"single\" men, one talking about 2 prior marriages with his friend stating, \"Oh, cool! So you had 2 bachelor parties?\" It was hard NOT to hear considering the guy was less than an arm's length away. You know how close I mean: their butt runs the risk of touching your food when they try to squeeze in, to sit down. \n\nThe other turn off: the twenty-somethings that come in wearing so much perfume, it was like they bathed in it. I was glad my dinner was done by this time. The last thing I want to smell while eating is your cheap, sugary/cotton candy smelling perfume. Just sayin'. Oddly enough, a double date was seated nearby, and not 5 minutes in, they left. Not sure why, but price may have been a factor...they didn't even open their menus, but then again, the menu is framed at the entrance for all to see.\n\nOverall, the birthday boy was happy. He loved his mussels, loved his crab, and loved his steak. Winning.", "author": "N M."}

Next we had the hamachi cappacio as an appetizer which was delish. As for our main course, we chose to share the 8 oz filet mignon and the combo sizzling plate. We loved the filet minon which was super tender and juicy but as for the seafood, I would give it a thumbs down. The mussels were so fishy I couldn't eat any of it and the shrimp tasted like the shrimp you would get out of the frozen section of your supermarket.

If the zombie-apocalypse finally happens, instead of leaving the island, I'll just head on over to Bobo's.  My suggestion is to utilize their valet service since it may take a few minutes or ten to circle around for parking.  Other suggestion is to use public transportation but the valet service beats it hands down.\n\nIf you're in a party greater than 2, I suggest arriving earlier than the other group members so you can hang out at the bar to order a drink (or two).  The bartender makes excellent drinks whether it be a moscow mule or other popular cocktails.  After you are seated, I suggest you order the ginormous ribeye and accompany it with brussel sprout sides.  Potatoes are a good starchy option to fill you up if you foolishly thing the steak won't do so.  For parties greater than 2, I suggest sharing the mussel and crab double combo.  The waiter will bring a long sizzling skillet of juicy and tasty mussels and crab to your table.  The steam shows how it just came out of the oven....errr stove.", "author": "Ronald L."}

After dreading the thought of parking at 7pm on a tuesday we were relieved to find out there is complementary parking. You first walk into the bar area where a host greets you and escorts you up a couple flights of stairs to your table. It is kind of cramped but we still had a nice private booth area. Our waitress was friendly and patient with us since we could not decide what we wanted to eat. We ended up with the lobster soup for appetizer, the sizzling single order of shrimp, twice baked potato, mod mac, swiss chard and caesar salad with lobster. I am not a lobster person so I didn't try too much of the soup but my boyfriend enjoyed it with the bread. The bread was reaally good btw. Kind of had a curry taste too it and lacked in lobster pieces. The shrimp was a good portion and were tasty. The sides were definitely enough for 2 people. All of the sides were flavorful. The salads are all the iceburg lettuce that you have to chop yourself which is kind of annoying. The first time my boyfriend ordered it with the smoked salmon which he thought would be cooked. It wasn't lol. So he had it sent back and got the lobster on top instead which he enjoyed. Overall we were satisfied but nothing to jump for joy about. Maybe we needed to get a steak.", "author": "Alisha C."}

I'm gonna assume the people who are gushing over this place are also giving 5 stars to Applebee's and Taco Bell.\n\nThe steak wasn't the worst I've had but it was pretty damn far from the best. It was overdone for medium rare but at least it was tender. Everything else was a disaster. The side of swiss chard seemed to have been fished out of a salt pond. It was completely inedible but since the waiter was only around on a 15-minute schedule that was how long I had to wait to return it. He insisted I scrape it from my dinner plate onto a fresh plate so he could \"show it to the chef\". Classy. A new one did come but by then my taste buds were already numb.\n\nThe appetizer of yellowtail carpaccio was devoid of flavor. The wine selection was pitiful and overpriced. But the worst part of the experience was the \"ambiance\". First of all the place has a distinctively run-down, sleazy feel. Think Nick's Crispy Tacos meets Spearmint Rhino. And they can't even install a decent ventilation system to keep those large windows from fogging up. But ambiance is not just decor, it's also clientele.

The salad was crisp but but not creative by any means, dressing kinda meh. Adding some parsley or onion to this dish could help. Crab was of lower freshness and quality than I am used to in this area. It was dumped on the plate with me filet, no presentation at all. Some weird gravy on it for which there was no explanation. No plate for the shells, no towel or even a towlette for your hands. The steak was a good piece of meat but not seasoned very well and tepid at best. I ordered it rare and expected the center cold but the outer bits weren't up to temp either. Pretty poor for a $50 steak.\nThe ambiance could be so great in this place. The decor is there. But it lacked any music. We got to hear the sound of Lombard street and hollaring valets from the open front door on a pretty cold night. The ringing phone and the staff chatting in the bar. Just not great. Not sure why we were sat in that area, with a table so close to us that it was as though we were dining with them. Upon getting up to use the restroom, which was in a service area (tacky), I realized that the restaurant had so many spots that could have offered a better experience. \nAlso, we were sitting by this old fireplace with mirrors in the place where there would be fire and it was just so dirty. Splashed with crab juice? I dunno, but that should not have gone uncared for. In the room we were eating in there was also a rack of silverware and napkins sitting in a plastic bucket. I'm sorry, but for the price of the restaurant, this just doesn't get it.\nOur server was polite but he could have been more attentive.We won't be dropping in again or recommending this place to friends.

We sadly forgot the gift card, and were traveling from out of town so could not go home to get it. We called the day of our reservations and asked if a photo of the gift card was acceptable, which clearly showed the numbers and pin on back, and the woman we spoke to said it wouldn't be a problem. \n\nAs we walked up we both noticed how beautiful the place was. We were both very excited to enjoy a nice dinner out on our vacation together. \n\nAs we entered, we got seated quickly and enjoyed a few drinks, two steaks, two sides and dessert. \n\nThe table we were seated at was not stable, and shook every time either of us were cutting our steak.\n\nFor a steakhouse the food was good, but nothing special. Presentation was also poor. Everything that came out looked like the food was just thrown on a plate. \n\nDrinks were tasty. \n\nWhen we asked for the check later we mentioned that we spoke to someone earlier about the gift card ready to show the photo, and our waitress immediately left to request a manager. We waited over 10 minutes just to be told by another woman that their systems do not allow any form of \"manual\" entry to minimize the risk of \"security\" for their customers. \n\nShe shared the wait was because she needed to validate with other employees if it was even possible to manually enter a gift card. She later shared that \"now I have to train our employees about this \" when she herself wasn't even sure. \n\nI find it hard to believe that it's impossible to manually enter a gift card of your own establishment into your system. When a POS system is unable to read cards, there has always been a manual entry option in my experience. \n\nThe cost of the meal wasn't a concern to us, but we would not have come here if the person we spoke to originally had shared this with us. We didn't want to cause a scene, so kindly paid the check and left to enjoy the rest of our night else where. \n\nOverall, service was poor and lacked training. \nI'm extremely disappointed with Bobo's. \nWhile the food wasn't bad, I wouldn't go out of my way to plan a second trip here when there are other steakhouses not too far away with great food and amazing customer service. \n\nOur gift card will probably go to waste. \nWhat a shame.", "author": "Binky A."}

We were placed in the room on the first floor with a birthday party of twelve.  They were loud and buzzed.  One lady was really loud and dropped several f bombs.  They were so loud that I asked the hostess if we could be seated in another area because I could not hear or carry on a conversation with my girlfriend.  With an icy response the hostess said there's another table in the same room with the party.  Go sit in it.  Instead of causing a fuss we moved which turned out to be a little better.  Our waiter felt bad.  I could see he was embarrassed for us considering the amount of f bombs pertruding out that woman's mouth.  We had a great crab and wine.

Then we moved on to a single order of mussels and I have no idea how they cook these mussels but they were AMAZING. From the flavor of the mussels, the slight crisp toasted texture, and the butter you dip them in its absolutely mouth watering just thinking about it! I would suggest get double of everything for seafood no regrets! Then I ended up getting the surf and turf! To be honest I've had better steaks, the filet mignon was just ok (8oz).

We went to Bobo's to see what's all the 4-stars on yelp and all the rave reviews about. I think the 4 stars are more for their kitch ambiance and all the dated \"Venezian\" decorations. The free Valet and Table Side Service are great and attentive so these aspects are also deserving of the 4 stars.\n\nBut if you're here for the food. It's a 2 stars rating at best. The server will tell you that they are known for their aged meat--mostly, their bone-in filet mignon. We had the regular size bone-in filet and a porterhouse. These tasted fine and cooked decent enough after a second trial when the first cut was served on the medium side (we ordered medium rare.) The server was gracious enough to take back the overcooked meat and gave us a new order that was more medium rare. \n\nWe also tried the mussels, crabs and shrimp on sizzling plate, man these were salty and way overcooked-so overcooked the mussels were shrunken into the size of peanuts--blackened peanuts. I normally plow through this type of entre since there's not much to begin with but I had to stop eating sooner since my mouth and lips were turning pruney due to the high salt seasoning on them.\n\nThe most disappointing part is the \"side dish\" which is $8/plate and \"large enough to share,\" per our server. I'm not sure if they have toddlers in mind when they mention the \"large enough to share\" part since these are tiny and more like a single serving of everything. \nWe tried the:\n \"Twice Cooked Potato,\" which was a mush of zombified potatoes re-stuffed back into its own half-shell skin and lightly baked so it resembles a baked potato--tasteless-zombie-potato-mush-in-its-own-skin might be a better name for this one. \n\"Brussel Sprouts,\" totally over cooked, over oiled and over salted--not very appetizing.\n\"Mod Mac&Cheese,\" if this is truly what they think as a modern version of mac&cheese then I'd rather be old fashioned. It's super oily and salty.

It started off very exciting ... our blood always boils with the thought of crabs and meat!  We ordered a bottle of wine, Lots of Crabs, Whole Crab and Mussels, Bone in Fillet plus sides to share, and some desserts. The bill came to 400 dollars for three people.  \n\nWithin 10 minutes all of our food came out at once.  The whole crab with mussels were served on the hot plate.  Watching the smoke come off the hot plate was deceiving.  While the plate was hot, the crab was cold and dry.  The mussels were over cooked and shriveled to crispness.  The lots of crabs was drizzled in some garlic sauce and while it wasn't as dry as the other crab, it was also cold!  I liked the flavor of the steak, but it was as well cold.  Actually, all of our food were cold.  That's the end of it.  Our experience with the dessert was not anything better.  I forgot what the name of the desserts were, but both had waffles.  All I can say is that no matter how good the filling is, if the waffle is stale and soft, the whole thing tastes horrible!\n\nSo service --- horrible horrible horrible!  The experience for the main courses was okay, except no one offered more bread and we couldn't get anyone's attention to ask for more bread.  It's when the dessert came that things got really weird.  Since one of our desserts had sorbet in it and none of us wanted to touch it because of the stale waffle, all the sorbet melted.  The other dessert also had half of it left untouched...due to the stale waffles.  Our waitress came by looked at our plate and instead of asking if everything was okay, said \"looks like you loved your desserts!\"  Then she cleared the table.  We laughed it off and kept on with our evening and conversation.  No one came back to offer to close our ticket not to ask if we wanted anything else.  We had to flag someone down to order coffee.  In fact our waitress never came back.  When we didn't know what to do, we grabbed a random gentleman who seem to be working there to ask for more coffee.  I actually think he was either the manager or the owner.  He looked at us, snickered and said, \"people are waiting for your table and you want more coffee?...*snicker*...okay!\"  We took that as our cue to leave.  But no one came by with the bill!  We had to ask for it!  The though crossed my mind that we should have just left without paying, but that my end is up in a place worse than where we were...or would it have?  Hmmm ...\n\nThe best part of the evening was when my friend and I were outside the restaurant discussing how we were kicked out after a 400 dollar bill to help the restaurant turn over tables.  The guy that kicked us out approached us!  He wanted to tell us that he was sorry he had to do it, but they needed to make sure they get a good turn over!

This was pretty ridiculous for the price of food here to push people out. I will never come here again. The food was not worth the price and the attitude of the restaurant towards it's customers was insulting.", "author": "Thida T."}

The bone in filet was so tender it melted in my mouth and it was so easy to cut with a knife.... Fast forward this year to my birthday again and boy did everything change..\n\nIf people were to ask me before what's a good place for steak I would have recommended bobos but after my last visit, I won't be coming back anymore. Me and my bf both got a bone in filet, medium rare... Tell me why it was cooked differently for both of us? One was tender but the char on it made it have a burnt taste to it and the other was obviously overcooked because it only had a slight light pink in middle and the char was so dark it also tasted very burnt... It was not like this last year.. I was very disappointed on my birthday this year because I was hoping for that juicy and tender meat I had before but instead I got burnt and overcooked meat..", "author": "Michele M."}

Came here to celebrate my son's birthday, and really sad to say that it didn't really live up to the good things I have heard.  We had filet mignon,  bone in ribeye and mussels & shrimp, some appetizers and sides.  The steak was quite disappointing, one of them was medium rather than medium rare that we asked for.  The seafood was quite good, but not fantastic.  Servers (only one of the servers was really smiling and made us feel welcomed) were not quite as professional as we have expected.  The Mussels & Shrimp platter was supposed to be accompanied with garlic bread, but they served the garlic bread right on when they brought us the appetizers, so by the time we were done with the appetizers, the bread was not warm anymore, and we didn't know if those were the complimentary bread you get for each table or not, and while we were wondering, we nibbled on the bread. Then the seafood platter came when we were almost done with the bread....*sigh*  All the little things led to the conclusion that they need more improvement in their service. and I was also expecting a much better steak too given the price tag, it's way too overpriced.

Yelp and Google had very high reviews about this place, even voted #3 on steakhouses in SF. Seeing that we were pretty excited about eating here. We pulled up and they have comp valet which was nice since parking is bad in SF. The restaurant has a old school feel, with a many small dining areas. We had reservation and requested a window seat. They were able to accommodate us with the request. We brought our own bottle of wine and they charge $25 for corkage fee. The food is on the pricy side and everything is al la carte. We ordered the double shrimp and 1/2 crab for $49.95. For the price I was expecting larger shrimp but the shrimp that was served was small white shrimp. It was over cooked in the hot skillets and was drenched in butter not much flavor. 1/2 crab was good but very little. We ordered the bone in NY and a bone in filet. The menu clearly states that the steaks are cooked medium rare, but when I got my NY steak it was clearly a medium cook and NY steak gets very tough when over cooked. I made a comment to the waitress and she just replied what an \"that looks medium rare to me\". I was kinda annoyed at this point so I didn't want to deal with it and just continued to eat my tough overcooked flavorless steak. The bone in filet was actually pretty good very tender and cooked properly. They gave us free dessert since it was our anniversary. Overall I'm giving this place a 2 star because I felt pretty ripped off, they served mediocre food for so much money. Everything we had we were happy with one thing. The service was ok.

My husband and I went here on a whim and had the time of our lives--sat upstairs tucked away in a romantic corner, excellent, warm, and caring service. Got a filet mignon that literally was the most decadent thing ever, fairly dripped in butter, but OMG the taste was everything, and though I like my steak fairly simple, they grilled it with such flavor, all was good. Even my husband who's not a huge beef guy, was blown away. We got salad and crab as starters, including garlic bread, and dessert . . . . everything was phenomenal, and of course we couldn't wait to go back. What do we do? Take our family of six there, with my niece and nephew, who's the biggest steak lover in the group. We were super excited to introduce them to this place. It did not get off to a great start: we were not seated upstairs as requested; instead despite asking, were seated downstairs (though we were one of the first people there, so it like they didn't have space). The hostess cold and austere, as if she's working for free. But I didn't want to make a big deal of it, since we were celebrating my brother's birthday, and I didn't want to make one of my usual scenes (that's what Yelp is for :-). It was downhill from there: we ordered much of the same stuff, and then some. The steak was dry and overdone, which they didn't take responsibility, despite me wanting to send it back. The waitress was surly, impatient, rude--and argumentative. Yup, getting defensive about how she thinks we ordered the steaks cooked. The vibe and mood at our table was strained and uncomfortable . . . I felt embarrassed about bringing my brother there for his brother, because everything was colossally bad. Our experience this second time was the total opposite of the first time--multiple personalities, as I mentioned. This trip was a while back--and despite wanting a regular steakhouse to go to, my husband and I have not been back. Btw., despite their messing up our orders, and my asking to speak to the manager, etc., we were not comped anything, and though I'm embarrassed to imply that I feel entitled to this (cuz I don't), but geez--the service and food were uniformly bad.

After some contemplation, I sent it back. Manager came over and agreed it was overcooked but the filet was not, which I agreed. They returned the filet and half crab.

I was bummed out because we ordered shrimp and mussels for appetizer, and it was the last thing that came to the table. If I knew it would come 15/20 minutes after our entree, I would not have ordered my entree since it was basically what I ordered as well. By the time the appetizer came, we were all full. Mussels are not good to take home, so we were forced to eat it, or we would have to waste it. I sure did not feel good the next morning =(\n\nBesides the food, the dessert was good.

Overall, Bobo's is a decent casual fine dinning restaurant, with stellar service and interesting ambiance, although it is hard to say that it is the best steak I ever had.\n\nFor the appetizer we shared the carpaccio and lobster crostini. The carpaccio had decent flavor although we were disappointed with the freshness of the fish itself. The lobster crostini was awesome, no complaints here. Just keep in mind that the appetizers are really tiny, like one appetizer per person.\n\nFor the main course, I had the super bone-in filet minion and my wife had the whole crab; we shared both dishes. We also got a side of Brussels sprouts, sweet potato mash, and twice-baked potato. First of all, the sides are amazing. All three were absolutely delectable and I would have been perfectly happy with just the sides and some bread. Second, the filet minion was decent but I was expecting more from a place with such a good reputation. The char was great but the meat itself was under-seasoned and not cooked to my requested temperature (I asked for medium rare but it was rare). Finally, my wife's crab was awesome; I overheard the waitress say that their crab is cooked in some type of a butter sauce, and it certainly makes sense because the crab is jam-packed with flavor.\n\nIn short: appetizers = okay; sides = great; steak = okay; crab = great", "author": "Toby K."}

We sat on the 2nd floor which was more quiet and the decor was pretty interesting. \n\nFood was pretty good. I think we over-ordered! \n\nFor starters, the bread with garlic and butter drizzled on top was pretty good. We ordered a caesar salad which was good as well as a single order of the mussels with a melted compound butter dip were REALLY good! \n\nFor our entree, the Bone-in Ribeye was pretty good. The first bite was delicious and then afterwards was decent. We ordered a whole crab and my lady said the crab was a bit on the dry side. We asked for more of the melted compound butter to dip. Sometimes we like to over-do it and over-do it we did! \n\nFor the sides, we ordered the onion rings, the twice baked potato and the portabellow mushroom. I thought the onion rings were well executed and had a really good creamy dipping sauce that went well with it. The twice baked potato was pretty good too. The portabello mushroom was my favorite side!\n\nFor dessert, we had an order of the dunce caps! These were small waffle cones with chocolate mousse inside of them.

But not before I grab the Mac n Cheese and rub it all over myself. I'll save you the details, but yes, you heard me correctly - this Bone-in Filet is a sensual piece of meat! \n\nI came here with a group of 6, on a Sunday night. 2 in the group had previously dined here and decided this would be a perfect way to end the night after we had just finished with a booze cruise. To their credit, the decision was spot on. Being that it was a Sunday, the wait was not long (FYI Ask them to seat you upstairs. I felt like we were secluded with a great view) \n\nThe first thing they bring out to you, is a fresh hot loaf of garlic bread. Be careful not too eat to much, or you wont get to eat all of what is to come out. The bone-in filet is really amazing. They sear the outside of the meat so well, that it keeps the inside juicy. I kid you not, inside the meat has a buttery texture with every glorious bite. By the end of it, whether you are full or not, you will attempt to finish it. This goes well with their Twice Baked Potato. If you're not huge on red meats, don't worry! Order the crab and/or muscles - or even better....the double crab, double muscles!! I guarantee you will feel like a king! Really, they serve it to you in a big 2 foot platter. \n\nBottom line, everything I had was great.

I was looking forward to eating here because it has the same name as my oldest son's nickname and we'd pass by the place with the kids and tease my son \"Hey Bobo, theres your restaurant.\" Lol. Came in with sentimental memories, but left with real disappointment. \n\nLet me first say that it was not what I was expecting. You can't  tell at all from the outside what the inside would be like. I guessed a sort of rustic upscale kind of ambiance.\n\nObservations:\n1-The free valet parking was a nice start.\n2-Decor was unusual, that of a gypsy fair. Could use some dusting though. \n3-Several floor levels of dining. Not disabled person friendly. All stairs to get from/to each level.\n4-Unique seating set ups. A few tables were set inside walls that gave it some privacy if you wanted it.\n5-Limited menu selections\n\nWe started out with their house bread which I didn't care for. It was some kind of garlic mushroom seasoned thing. For dinner I had the porterhouse with mod Mac and yam. I ordered it med/well but when it came out it was charred (over seared). The porterhouse comes with a small filet mignon. The filet was black (again seared too long) and was mostly well done than med but was ok. The actual porterhouse was too dry. Also charred on the outside but med/well on the inside. It was tough to cut which also was tough to chew. A bit disappointed for something that costs $70. \n\nThe sides were good though. The yam was the closest thing to mashed potatoes. The twice baked potato comes as is so you can't add anything to it like a normal baked potato (hubby had that). The mod Mac was good. I wouldn't call it a mac&cheese though. It's pasta with sauce but definitely not a mac&cheese since the pasta isn't entirely covered with a cheese sauce but more like \"topped\" with their sauce that wasn't that cheesy but was good.\n\nEverything is a la carte and definitely over priced. I've had better steaks at Texas Roadhouse but that's just me. The side dishes are not worth $9 each and the desserts as well. The desserts are pre-made so you cant ask to have it changed in any way if you had an allergy to something or substitute a sauce because of flavor preference as someone in our party asked and found out. The menu is slim pickings and with all the rave I expected the quality to be a lot more. Before I forget, the service was excellent.\n\nSo sadly, I would not go back to Bobo's.

Thank you OpenTable via Yelp and the refresh button! We arrived on time and waited less than ten minutes for our table. The complimentary garlic & olive bread was a good starter. Flavor was very subtle, which I appreciate since I'm not a big fan of olives.\n\nMain entrees are served a la carte, so ordering sides was necessary. We got the house salad which consisted of romaine, tomatoes, bread crumbs, avocado, and red onions. It was very light, especially because it's served with evoo. Overall, nothing too special but definitely didn't ruin our huge appetite for the entrees. We also ordered twice-baked potato, which was great -- very creamy melt in your mouth goodness. It was cooked well enough so the skin was a little flaky. There was little cheese baked into the potato too. However, I thought the zucchini bits were odd.\n\nBf ordered the bone-in filet mignon, medium rare, but the doneness varied throughout; it was very rare near the bone. I ordered the surf & turf, which consisted of half a crab and a petit filet mignon. The crab was very meaty and delicious. The ginger reduction sauce served with it was very creamy, but too oily. I spent more time cracking than eating and ashamedly left a mess of crab shells all over the table and floor. The petit filet mignon (ordered medium) was very small but so so so tender and juicy!

The sides were all excellent, don't miss the onion rings, yams, or brussel sprouts.\n\nThe food and service were outstanding.  The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is due to the quirky outdated decor and the odd music selection that randomly cut on and off throughout our meal.

Doesn't take much to make crab delicious.  I don't need no crab cracker...

I asked the waitress why it's called modern Mac & Cheese, off hand I can't remember the name of the cheese she said they use, but it's definitely not the one mom used.\n\nHow Bobo's came up with the name and decor of clowns I'm not sure.

I raved about the place to her beforehand from a past experience but on this visit I felt let down.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my wife ordered the bone-in fillet and also some crab.  My ribeye was not served anywhere near hot nor even close to warm.  I asked the waiter about this and he stated that is how it is served.  I didn't believe him but didn't feel like making too big an issue and just ate it because it was still edible.  My wife's steak was worse, she is pretty forgiving on food but I found out towards the end of our meal that her steak was burnt in a few places and I thought it a bit late to send back since it was half eaten.   I'm not sure what happened between my visit a few years ago and now but this place seems to have fallen hard on quality.  I thought perhaps that maybe it was just me that had the problem but the table next to us also had issues with their steak that night.  The food is still good but if you have to pay that much for what we got then I'd rather go elsewhere.\n\nService from the wait staff was also sub-par as well.  They refilled my water once and only towards the end of the meal after we were done.  At a high-end restaurant, I think having a drink sit empty the whole meal without anyone asking if I wanted a refill a sign of a bad restaurant.", "author": "Charles L."}

It's definitely cozy, especially in the quieter secluded upstairs dining room, where you feel like you're eating under a circus tent (there are colorful curtain-like fabrics draped against the walls from top to bottom).\n\nAs for the food, it was exceptional.  They do a really good steak here, I was impressed. I started with the crab cakes which were solid, not greasy at all.  For the steak, I had to go with the bone-in filet.  This was a tremendous cut, generous in its thickness and dry-aged for 6 weeks.  It was cooked to perfection, seared and served piping hot.  We also sampled a couple of sides and they were ok, good but not epic.  The sides at Bourbon Steak and 5A5 are way better but this placed is all about the steak.\n\nService was perfect, our waitress took really good care of us.  All in all, a really great experience.

I could hear the sizzling sound and smell the garlicky aroma from the roasted/ grilled seafood already while the server was carrying our skillet like 3-4 tables away from where we were seated.  The seafood tasted fresh; seasoning was flavorful; portion was huge. One word, Delish!\n\nBoth the boyfriend and a friend of ours had the 6-week dry-aged NY steaks that were extra-flavorful because of the dry-aging process.  Another friend had a whole Dungeness crab roasted in garlic sauce; very garlicky and good but not impressive because we had already tried some of the Dungeness crab from the skillet combo!  I had the Basa a White Fish Filet, which was the only fish option on the menu.  Oh gawwwd.....the fish filet sauteed in soy-butter and topped with thinly-sliced dried seaweed was so Asian, and sooooooo delicious!!  The side items that we ordered, including the twice-baked potatoes, Portobello mushrooms, and roasted Brussels sprouts, were fabulous, too!  The server said that the mushrooms were like the Signature side item that everyone loved, but I personally liked the Brussels sprouts better.  One more thing, the complimentary bread along with the melted garlic butter dip was scrumptious!  \n\nFor a party of four, the bill with tax and tips included was $300-ish; Pricey but totally worth it!

Quiet with low dim lights. \n\nOrdered: Double Mussels and Double Shrimp & Filet Mignon with Bone. \n\nTotal bill: $97 (excluding tips). \n\nTo be honest, if it was a battle between House of Prime Ribs and Boboquivari's (bobo's) I would choose House of Prime Ribs. Why? First, Bobo's portions are about the same as the House of Prime Ribs but it costs more. Secondly, Bobo's filet mignon do not come with sides and each sides cost $8.95. Yes, that means if you want a stupid potato it is 9 bucks. And when they say it's a la carte, they really mean it is a la carte. There isn't even a freakin' granish or a piece of green to decorate the  filet mignon. Third, the  filet mignon  has no flavor. This is the part that upsets me the most. I just wish they would have added a little salt or pepper to the meat. I do have to say that the meat was tender and soft (at medium rare). \n\nAnother con about Bobo's was that the place smoked up really badly towards the end of the dinner. My eyes were getting watery and I was inhaling a lot of bad smoke fumes. The staffed mentioned that the smoke came from kitchen but there wasn't any fire. They didn't know why there are so much smoke. There was one table left at the end of my meal and I am not sure if the restaurant relocated them to the bottom floor or what. Also, when I was existing the restaurant I could clearly see a film of smoke in the stairway (I was eating at the top floor).\n\nThe mussels and shrimps were good. The mussels were really good. It had a herby garlic flavor to it. The shrimps were a disappointment. There were like five shrimps and it doesn't look fresh. It looks like shrimps that have died a long time ago, defrosted, and just cooked. You can tell when the shrimp isn't fresh when the shells that are soft and clings to the meat. The shrimp meat wasn't chewy or juicy. Trust me, if you've had really garlic, juicy, jumbo shrimps before you won't be craving for Bobo's $34 or $35 something shrimps. \n\nOverall, the food isn't bad. It's just over priced. If you want good steak go to The House of Prime Ribs or even the HOUSE (near north beach). If you want fresh seafood go to SCOMA or CAJUN HOUSE for some garlic shrimp.", "author": "Lily K."}

It wasn't bad, it just wasn't excellent. 1st off, in their defense I don't particularly care for the porterhouse cut. I use the New York/ KC strip to make potato hash and to grill when I tailgate so I didn't appreciate that being their only option as far as stake.. There was nothing spectacular about the sides. I believe I had the mac-n-cheese.. Nothing special. My opinion is the Hose of Prime Rib is better. Parking is also a pain to say the least in that area so for all the trouble I expected more. As far as the steak.. The flavor was average. I ordered a medium steak and it was slightly overcooked but okay..I figured that since that's what they do for hours everyday they should be like clockwork, just like the House of Prime Rib..", "author": "damiain a."}

This was how I announced our dinner plans for No. 300:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeNGVS2T_Rk&feature=related\n\nAnyway, I saved No. 300 for one of the most popular steakhouses in San Francisco, Boboquivari's, aka Bobo's, which also means court jester.  The decor is appropriately playful and stylish, but not too much to make it cheesy.  The food, for the most part, is no joke.  The filet mignon was very tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  If you're just looking for great steaks, I bet Bobo's will not disappoint.\n\nThe twice baked potato was excellent.  I would suggest asking for additional sour cream.  Also pretty good was the lobster curry soup.  \n\nSadly, some sides and appetizers failed to live up to expectations.  The complimentary half loaf garlic bread looked a lot better than it tasted; the middle part was soaked with butter while the other parts were dry and bland.  The grilled shrimp dish was small and undercooked.  Not impressive at all.  The lobster crostini was also just okay.\n\nOther than the bread, Bobo's portions tend to be on the smaller scale.  The high price is definitely more of a reflection of the quality than size.  The filet mignon, for example, will wow you with the awesome quality of the aged beef, but the smaller portion may leave not leave you completely satisfied.\n\nThe good thing is that Bobo's gets right what matters the most, the meat.  Add that to decent service and complimentary valet parking, it will likely be a memorable meal.", "author": "Angel S."}

Nonetheless, all these symptoms are real so I guess I'm on the fast track to \"Aging like a Rockstar\". :X On the bright side, getting old means independence and most importantly becoming a seasoned foodie!\n\nMy first visit to Bobo's was five years ago when I was a broke college student and the restaurants I frequented most were Sizzlers, Red Lobster, Hungry Hunter...you get the point. So back then, I would have given BoBo's 5 Stars because I was blown away with their bone-in filet. As years passed, I was fortunate enough to met Mr. Wagyu and thanks to him, I now have very high expectations of what constitutes a good steak which is why my review may be biased. I know there's NO way you can compare a USDA Steak to a Australian or Tajima-ushi Wagyu (esp when it's about 4x more expensive), but Bobo's just isn't \"as\" good as I remembered it to be.\n\nInitially, I was going to give BoBo's 3 Stars but with FREE VALET PARKING they definitely deserve an extra star! I'm being very generous because it is the holiday season after all. :)\n\nOn Wed, 11/24/10, my friend and I arrived at BoBo's for our 6 PM reservations. We were seated at booth on the second floor which from my side overlooked Lombard Street.\n\nF O O D:\n*Dungeness Crab Crostini w/ Smoked Salmon, Avocado and Burrata ($13): YUMMY! The thin and crisp crostini (similar to a flour tortilla) was topped w/ a layer of smoked salmon, a generous chunk of crab leg, avocado, chives, and a side of burrata (mozzarella & cream). The crostini provided the perfect texture contrast to the tender crab and soft salmon, avocado and burrata. It was the perfect combo of crispy, soft, buttery, salty, sweet, smoky, and creamy. \n\n*Bone-In Filet ($39): OK. I requested the 8 oz filet to be cooked medium rare, however the level of done-ness varied throughout the cut. Upon cutting the edges, it was a medium-well, the center was a medium, and near the bone, it was more a medium-rare to rare. The filet had a nice charred outer crust which helped seal in all the juices. It was semi-tender and moist but didn't cut like butter as with other (non-wagyu) filets I've had. My biggest gripe is it was overseasoned to the point the natural beefy-ness got lost in all the saltiness. \n\n(As a side note: The steakhouses in Vegas just don't compare to SF. If you have $$$ to burn, I highly suggest Wolfgang Puck's CUT @ The Palazzo; their Australian Wagyu is TO DIE FOR and is simply life-changing! Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak @ MGM is a close second with their Kobe Skirt Steak. \n\nHowever, an excellently prepared steak can be found in SF in the same price range as BoBo's and I suggest the Kobe Bavette Steak @ BIX or the Steak & Eggs @ Tyler Florence's Wayfare Tavern.) \n\n*Twice Baked Potato ($8): CARB-RRIFIC! The potato was perfectly baked until the skin was crisp and the center was like finely milled creamy mashed potatoes. The melted cheese added a savory and saltiness while the sour cream added a zing. It also had little bits if zucchini which didn't do much for it. Personally, I think bacon bits should have been added because pork fat ALWAYS makes everything better!\n\n*Brussels Spouts w/ Pancetta ($8): Our waiter recommended this dish and it was AWFUL! We had to send the brussels sprouts back (which we rarely do) because it was so salty that it was unbearable to eat. The second batch was better, however, the sprouts had a very unappetizing bitterness and tartness to it. For a minute, I thought they mistakened distilled vinegar for olive oil while cooking it.  \n\nS E R V I C E:\nOur waiter was nice and attentive, but I felt it was very contrived. While our app came within 5 mins, our steaks took nearly 45 mins to arrive and our sides 5 mins later, so timing of dishes seem to be off. \n\nOh yah, since our pitcher of water never got refilled, my mouth felt like the umbrella in the Morton Salt cover after our meal. :X\n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nReminiscent of The Stinking Rose (its sister restaurant), \"The Nightmare Before a Circus\" is the best way I can describe BoBo's. If Tim Burton were to open a restaurant, it would probably look like BoBo's; funky, gothic and dark with cracked out jesters. Don't get me wrong, it had a unique decor, but just very odd for a steakhouse. \n\nBoBo's has 3 levels with little nooks and crannies where some of the booths are placed. I love how the booths have burgundy velvet drapes which you can close for privacy. Hmmm, are you thinking what I'm thinking? *wink wink*\n\nBoBo's may not be as good as the first time around, then again not many things are right? However, I do partly blame Mr. Wagyu for this. Ever since we met 2 years ago, steaks will just NEVER be the same to me.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I chose to give this place the benefit of the doubt when reading all of the yelp reviews, but now I actually regret taking my boyfriend here and was pretty embarrassed I chose this place because I never miss the mark this bad.\n\nI hate to give a bad review, but I'll make it comprehensive to be fair.\n\nAmbiance: Expect a circus theme with creepy decorations. At first it was quiet because there were only two other parties of 2 - then it got incredibly loud. I felt like we were suddenly in a bar as we were raising our voices louder and louder. I know restaurants aren't able to control the volume of noise too much, but the proximity of all the tables were definitely a factor. I made reservations for this place two months in advance and you give us a small cramped table in the middle? Thanks for slapping my face.\n\nService: While the waitress was attentive to refilling water, I could just tell in the tone of her voice that she would rather be serving the other guests in the room. Is it because we decided to not have alcohol, thus making our bill a scratch cheaper? Whatever the reason, I did not appreciate it.\n\nFood: Unjustly priced. There are so many other steak houses in the city that taste exponentially better and I would gladly pay that price. I would not consider this place fine dining, but they definitely charge fine dining prices for diner-quality food.\n\nWe had the following:\n\nDungeness Crab Crostini with smoked salmon & avocado - super tiny. A few bare and mediocre ingredients I literally could have made myself - not worth $15 at all. I've never felt so ripped off in my life.\n\nPetit Filet Minon - they say their \"medium rare\" is cooked more on the rare side, but I feel like this is a cop out way of not taking responsibility for cooking their meat right. You can still get all of the flavor without leaving it blood-red if done right. My steak was really red, flavorless, and kind of tough. I didn't finish it.\n\nThe boyfriend ordered the Bone-in Filet Minon - we've both had such good steak elsewhere that these just didn't cut it for us. Plus he got stomach pains afterward.\n\nAs for sides: Portobello Mushrooms - $9 for a few diced mushrooms enough for 2 - again, overpriced. The Mod Mac - flavor was decent but that stuff was just swimming in a pool of butter/grease, kind of throw-up worthy towards the end.\n\nNot impressed with the dessert selection, but opted with the Monterosa. This is a TINY piece of strawberry cheesecake. I thought the cake part was soggy. For $9, I could have finished this \"slice\" in literally 2 bites.\n\nIn summary, if you suck at making your own food and have money to burn, then sure go here. Otherwise, any other normal person could easily make better food at home or go to the many other better restaurants in SF. I've been to a lot of other steakhouses and this one does not make the cut.\n\nDO NOT come here if you're celebrating a birthday because they'll just put a candle in IF you order dessert. Other restaurants actually value the fact that you've chosen to celebrate with them. This place is just embarrassing. House of Prime Rib, Alexander's, Ruth's Chris, anything else is better really.\n\n*Addition: I appreciate that the business owner skimmed through my review, but why would I bother giving more of my money to an undeserving establishment? The menu wasn't impressive to begin with and first impressions are everything. SF has too many other options for me to want to give a place like this an expensive 2nd chance.", "author": "Sandy T."}

My girlfriend took me here for my 25th birthday; but unfortunately, the best thing about this restaurant was the company I was with. \n\nI can honestly say that I love steak, I have gone to a number of different places all over the world including the mecca, Argentina. This place just did not cut it in terms of quality and ambiance. \n\nWalking into the restaurant, I was greeted with tacky decorations that made me feel as though I was entering a tourist trap. The decorations took on a circus-like theme that I wasn't too fond of, but to each their own. I'm fine with weird themed restaurants as long as the food blinds me of my surroundings, but alas, the food totally missed the mark. \n\nFood: Started with the Dungeness Crab Crostini. It came with two crostinis with lox, two pieces of crab meet and avocado all for $15. This dish was forgettable, and lacked flavor. The best item on this dish was sadly the avocado. Moreover, the portions size was a meager two bites, for lack of a better term, clearly a ripoff. \n\nBone-in Petite Filet Mignon was $50 and the supposed must have at Bobo's. I'm all for spending $50 on a quality piece of meat, but that filet needs to be aged, well seasoned, and cooked to perfection, three things every meat lover looks for with their first bite. No of those qualifiers were met, as you could tell the aging wasn't right due to the lack of tenderness, seasoning was off  and the piece seemed to be overcooked. You can't afford to make these elementary mistakes when you have Harris's and the House of Prime Rib literally right up the street. \n\nMonterosa - The cheesecake was a sliver. Look I'm trying to lose weight just like everyone else in this world, but honestly I was hoping to enjoy my birthday cake not only have a tasting. Additionally, the crust was soggy and not up to standards, save your money and just head up to Whole Foods, the bakery is 3x better. \n\nOverall, a major disappointment.

I'm talking bold red walls, and crazy glass clown figures hanging from the walls, wonky gilded mirrors, and an eerie yellowish dim lighting, to go so well with their 80s hits that they play throughout your dining experience.

I would say the Magic Castle decor makes for an interesting time, but with the nice steak and great service, I would still go back.

No big deal, so one of the employees escorts us to the restaurant and plenty of seating at the bar.\n\nWe sit at the bar and check in with Spencer, the host. We are seated at 7:20, which is perfect as the final person arrived. Our reservations were at 7:30 on 12/6/14.

The waiter was not personable at all and did not even ask if this was a special event, how are we doing, nothing of that nature. Maybe he had a personal issue that night, but if your working, you might as well make the best of it and earn the highest amount of tip available.\n\nThe waiter comes by and asks us for our order and doesn't even ask if we want appetizers or even explain the menu. This is common sense at higher-end restaurants, such as Alexanders Steakhouse and Michael Mina. After we order, bread arrives at the table.

The walls are covered with all sorts of interesting paintings and decals. Lined with a lot of red and crimson tones, this place was totally different than I expected. It's quaint, not a very big place but that helps cut down the noise level. I felt like I was in a members only club. That's probably the best way to describe the feeling. The staff, decor and size of the restaurant gives the impression that it's only accessible to certain people, which, in all honesty, makes you feel pretty badass while you're in there. Think old school mafia. If you watch Boardwalk Empire on HBO, you'll get my drift. \n\nI went with two of my friends (Jack and Josh) and we didn't skimp on anything. However, I'll only mention the steaks because I didn't feel any of the sides (shrimp, crab, brussels, Baby Blue salad, Mod Mac, etc.) were anything spectacular which resulted in docking a couple stars. Plus, the steaks, as it should be at a steakhouse, were the stars of the show. \n\nBone-in Filet Mignon (Jack) ~ Medium Rare ~ 4 stars: This was all the rage going into Bobo's. Jack and Josh heard through word of mouth that this was the go-to cut. I verified their claim by reading up on how many Yelpers raved about it. It was good, not great. You'll find better bone-in filets at other restaurants. I thought the seasoning was lacking. However, the steak was cooked perfectly. They did a great job of cooking the portion close to the bone, which is usually a little undercooked at other places. Tender, juicy but lacking flavor. \n\nBone-in New York (Josh) ~ Medium Rare ~ 3 stars: I thought it was just a typical NY strip. Nothing special, nothing terrible. The flavor was much better on this than the filet. Blame it on the fat! \n\nBone-in Ribeye (Me) Medium Rare ~ 4 stars: You won't find this cut on Bobo's online menu, however, it was available when we went. With ribeye being my cut of choice, I had to do it. It also made sense since Jack and Josh go the filet and NY. With my ribeye we had the opportunity to get a full sampling of their carnivorous offerings. The flavor was on-point, the fat-to-meat ratio was great. However, it could have been a little more tender. Oddly enough, although the meat close to the bone on Jack's filet was cooked perfectly, my ribeye was a little too rare in that area. However, Josh and I thought the ribeye was better than the filet. \n\nWith a standard $20 corkage fee, we downed three bottles of wine. We also ordered a round of cocktails. Of course I started out with a nice ginny T. We walked out each spending $121 which included tip, which isn't bad if you consider $60 worth of corkage fees, a round of cocktails, three premium cuts of steak, 1/2 order of crab, shrimp, brussels, three salads and an order of mac. \n\nBobo's is the first official steakhouse I've dined at in SF (I don't count House of Prime Rib) and it wasn't even close to my experiences at other restaurants. Places like Mastro's in Newport Beach, CA or Craftsteak in Las Vegas, NV or CUT in Beverly Hills, CA outshine Bobo's. However, Bobo's is a step above your typical steakhouse chains like Fleming's, Lawry's and Morton's. \n\nIt's a great place to enjoy a meal with some of your closest friends and I think I'll go out on a limb and say it makes a pretty decent date spot. Although I wouldn't suggest Bobo's for a first date. The staff was amazing and very familiar with all their menu items.", "author": "Bruce C."}

The day before the reservation, I called to ask if it would be possible to delay it by 30 mins (to 7 pm). I was told that it was not possible. I was fine with that, but the day of, we all ran into some traffic and were 10 minutes late. I called them to ask them if that was okay, and was told that it was no problem, and that they would put me down for 6:45 pm.\n\nWhen I arrived for my party of 4, one person was stuck at work and was going to be 30-45 mins late. The receptionist told us that we could sit down immediately for a table of 3, or have the table of 4 but had to be out by 7:30 pm! I had to tell my friend that he could no longer join us since he as going to be 30 mins late.\n\nI was also confused. My original reservation was for 6:30 pm for 4 people. Were they expected me to eat for only 1 hour? When I brought this up, they told me I had to leave by 8 pm. This still confused me, so again, their thought was that my dinner time was from 6:30-8 pm?!\n\nFinally, after I expressed my disappointment, they allowed me to sit down with no specified time limit, and thankfully I was then able to re-invite my friend. To be honest, we ended up being out the door by 8:15 pm anyway. \n\nI felt embarrassed and dismayed with this whole ordeal. Having something come up at work is unexpected, and having to uninvite someone or risk being kicked out within 1-1.5 hours seems out of line with a restaurant of this calibre. I did not see anywhere on their website or reservation confirmation, or in my calls to the reservation staff, that our entire party had to be there, or an ending time.\n\nI will try other steak houses for better service.", "author": "Yan K."}

We had reservations and were super lucky to score awesome parking a short block away. Since Bobo's is known for their bone-in filet, we both had an order of it as well as their twice baked potato plus mac 'n cheese. We enjoyed the sides, but felt like the mac 'n cheese was nothing spectacular to rave about. The twice baked potato was huge! It definitely was a shareable side. The filet was outstanding. I had mine medium and my knife just sunk into it. The meat was flavorful and tender. Also, they give you this bread that's different from other restaurants, two pieces of bread topped with a garlic sauce. For dessert, we shared a strawberry cheesecake.

The service was prompt, casual, but friendly.\n\nTHE STEAK... it was AMAZING!:\nBoboquivari's doesn't serve Rib Eye's??!! Your choices are: Filet Mignon (~$43 for the bone-in) and NY Strip - even their \"Porterhouse\" (~$69) is a NY Strip and Petite Filet cooked separately. Wha? No question, I'm a Rib Eye girl who had serious doubts about the famed bone-in filet, but every bite was like sinking my teeth into heaven. The filet was cut really thick, yet cooked perfectly medium rare, tender, and deliciously seasoned. Usually a cut this thick would be overly charred on the outside, or really chewy and tough on the inside. Amazing! \n\nTHE WINE:\nThey have a decent selection of wines that aren't too overpriced, or bring your own and pay the very reasonable $15 corkage fee.\n\nTHE REST... it was all pretty mediocre:\nThe bread isn't \"stale\" like many other Yelpers wrote, but it was definitely a waste of my carb intake for the week. The yellow tail in ponzu sauce was pretty good but way overpriced (I could have put the entire \"plate\" of yellow tail in my mouth at once), the cauliflower side was incredibly generic, and the Mod Mac and Cheese was atrocious - not worth ordering because it was tasteless and clumpy. The mango panna cotta reminded me of a worse version of Chinese mango pudding from dim sum.\n\nDespite the unimpressive sides and appetizers, I really did love Bobo's, and I came here just for the steak. I would absolutely return, but just for the bone-in filet.\n\nTip: Valet is free!", "author": "Jess C."}

He's not very friendly nor accommodating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-21", "description": "I've been to the major steakhouses in San Francisco and in the Peninsula, so it was nice to try Boboquvari's where I hadn't been.\n\nThe most well known items here are the steaks (all dry aged for 4-6 weeks) and the crab.  This made ordering simple and straight-forward.\n\nWe started with a seafood sampler that included mussels, shrimp, and the famous crab.  A searing hot skillet was placed in the center of the table and all the seafood items were covered simply with oil, salt, and pepper.  I found the mussels to be good, but found the shrimp and the crab a bit on the oily side.\n\nFor the main entrees, I opted for their famous bone-in filet mignon.  I'm usually a rib-eye eater, prefering the greater fat and flavor that comes with a ribeye over the tenderness that comes with a filet mignon.  But other than the filet mignon, Boboquivari's only offered a New York Strip and the Porterhouse (=NY strip + filet mignon).  \n\nThe bone-in filet mignon looked similar to the NY strip and was covered with a light sauce.  A tad salty, the sauce however added a great flavor to the very tender filet.  It was one of the more tender steaks I've had and the flavor worked quite well.  They really cooked it a perfect medium rare.\n\nI tried some filet mignon from a surf and turf combo (crab and petite filet mignon) and think the bone-in must have added to the flavor or the cooking style as there was a clear difference in both quality, flavor, and thickness.  The bone-in filet mignon is really the cut to get here.  Don't bother with the petite filet....it's not even close.\n\nIn addition to the entrees, several sides were ordered.  Mac and Cheese, potatoes, and spinach came out as small sides.  The one complaint among all of them was definitely that they were too salty.  The spinach was the worse offender and literally tasted like a salt lick or as if the cook had accidentally dumped the salt shaker in.  At $8, it was disappointing.  The mac and cheese was better but definitely had a strong gruyere cheese flavor so you better like that.  Finally, the potato skins were very popular but a tad salty and definitely very rich.  \n\nOverall, we had a great meal at Boboquivari's.  I'd say the prices are a tad high (bone in filet mignon at $39, Porterhouse at $59) but the filet mignon bone in was excellent.  Sides were much weaker and I found the seafood to be a pass.  I'd much prefer garlic crabs at PPQ over the crab legs we had at Boboquivari.  \n\nComplimentary valet parking was a plus in the horrid Marina area district for parking and the small and cozy (yet a bit too dark) environment was nice too.  Boboquivari's takes credit cards, including American Express.", "author": "Randy F."}

We ordered the double shrimp and double mussels skillet as well.  We also all ordered the bone in filet.  \n\nThe first item to arrive was the shrimp and mussels which I though to be the highlight of the meal.  The shrimp was very flavorful and the butter to go with it was amazing as well.  The mussels were also good.\n\nThe sides seemed to be a hit or miss.  I wish they roasted the Brussels sprouts a bit more to have the caramelized look but it seems like they just boiled it.\n\nAs for the steak which was supposed to be the highlight turned out to be disappointing.  While the filet was very flavorful, 6 out of the 7 steaks turned out to be still raw.  While I understand mistakes happen with one or two, but when the almost the whole table has raw steaks, I find that to be unacceptable but this was quickly rectified when we informed our host.

I have yet to find it, so if you know of a place - please let me know!\n\nI took my boyfriend to Boboquivari's for his birthday since he loves nice, juicy steaks more than anything. After much scouring the internet and rifling through recommendations, I decided on Boboquivari's. I can't resist a place that was named \"Best steak in SF\" back in 2013 or whatever.\n\nThe boyfriend and I ordered the 20 oz bone-in filet to share (~$60), a cranberry-walnut salad (~$10), and a side of brussel sprouts (~$9).  We also got complimentary garlic bread, which was warm and very tasty. \n\nThe salad came first, and it was disappointing considering the cost. I could have thrown it together myself as it was literally two wedges and some toppings. However, I place the blame solely on my boyfriend who wanted the salad. Who orders a salad at a steakhouse? ;)\n\nThe steak came very quickly thereafter. It was charred on top, and really added flavor to the steak. The steak was cooked perfectly! We had requested a medium rare, and it was just the way I liked it - red-centered, chewy, melt-in-your-mouth tenderness. Very flavorful and I could really taste the quality of the meat. It could have been slightly more seasoned, but that is my own personal preference.\n\nThe brussel sprouts were delicious! A bit pricey for what you get for $9, however.\n\nThe waiter also brought out a cone with a candle in it in honor of my boyfriend's birthday (I had requested the waiters to wish him happy birthday when I made the reservation). I thought the dessert was something nice that the restaurant was doing for us, but I was charged $2 for an itty bitty cone. This dampened my spirits only slightly, since I did not expect to be charged, but I suppose $2 is $2. \n\nThe service was no fuss, and I loved how efficient our waiter was. We got our food cleared quickly, waters filled promptly, and we never had to wave our waiter down for anything - he always took away our plates in a timely matter, and gave our bill without us asking (but didn't rush us either).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-02-09", "description": "I agree that it's wholly self-indulgent to go to Ruth's Chris Steak House one weekend and then to Bobo's the following weekend. You're thinking what a decadent carnivore I must be to drop so much do-re-mi on high-end beef that shouldn't really be devoured that often. Well, Ruth's was an act of culinary desperation when no other Dine Around Town eatery was available on the last day of the program. Bobo's, on the other hand, was a more deliberate choice since Jamie W. and I wanted to celebrate the few more shekels we received in our respective paychecks with a nice steak dinner. \n\nHere's the newsflash: Bobo's turned out to be no better and no worse than Ruth's. It's a dimly lit place that appears to cobble various nooks and crannies into a restaurant. We were placed in the Lilliputian room next to the bar in a dark, cramped corner where every creak of my chair was the result of my fidgeting between the back wall and the table. I kept straightening the front of my shirt, hoping to see space to insert my napkin but to no avail. I'd characterize the vibe in the place to be manly. Lots of Super Bowl talk, lots of meat talk, lots of boobage talk. And that was just the two guys sitting mere inches from us at the next table. \n\nFirst off was the huge loaf of Garlic-Baked Sourdough Olive Loaf that came to our table, toasted and quite a bit of starch for an opener. Jamie and I both decided to start with Baby Romaine Wedges. His was topped with tomato and avocado slices, red onions and a light vinaigrette ($8). Mine was more decorative with apples, sun-dried cranberries, candied walnuts and a raspberry vinaigrette ($9 - see photo). Both of us were challenged by the minuscule size of the oblong glass plates and would have preferred a proper salad plate to keep all the ingredients off the white tablecloth. My wedge was marginally tastier simply because it was fruitier. \n\nSince neither of us had been here before, we both tried the $39 Surf & Turf, which consisted of a petit filet mignon (...they weren't kidding about the size) and a half-crab already pulled apart but not cracked (see photo). The filet was easily the best part of the meal - tender, pinkish on the inside and so very easy to cut. Too bad it was so small. Next time. The crab was decent, but I forgot what a pain it was to disassemble crab with a nutcracker and try to spear it with a cocktail fork. It was a chore, but I made it. The two $8 sides were variable in quality. The Modern Mac & Cheese had several competing cheeses melted on top of the wide noodles (see photo), but it failed to make an impression.\n\nWe had better luck with the Twice-Baked Potato (see photo) simply because I hadn't had a twice-baked potato since the Nixon administration. Memories. We ended up splitting dessert, their $8 Pistachio Panna Cotta (see photo), a disappointment as it had the distinct texture of something that had been stored in an aluminum tin in the fridge way past the expiration date. There was no light custardiness to it but rather a congealed quality. Ho-hum. Bobo's wasn't a boo-boo, but it wasn't that far north of so-so either. Bye-bye.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars....great little steak, the rest was on the meh side for such a high-end restaurant\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...very red, very dark, very cramped, very manly, very Republican\nSERVICE - 4 stars...no complaints here...she also led me to the tasty Moscow Mojito - Stoli Vodka, brown sugar, mint, lemon, orange, and a splash of ginger ale (see photo)\nTOTAL - 3 stars...as George Michael would sing. \"Wake me up before you Bobo / Don't leave me hangin' at a place that's so-so\"", "author": "Ed U."}

However, after tasting a bit of other peoples, they instantly admitted defeat and realized they should have got the bone-in filet.  Not that the other items are not good.

My friend was right, the steak was good. But everything else about the experience wasn't good. Let's start with the decor: old, dingy, dusty, and cramped to the point of being claustrophobic. Also the music was WAY too loud, we could barely carry on a conversation. As I said, the steak was good, but every other food item was only ok to terrible. The salad was terrible. All the salads were made with iceburg lettuce including a Ceasar Salad! My salad, $13, consisted of a very small wedge of iceburg lettuce with a sprinkling of off-tasting vinegar and some nuts, etc. No dressing, just vinegar.  I couldn't eat it. The wine selection was very limited and very overpriced. Speaking of price, if you take the price of the steak, add a salad, a vegetable, a potato (everything is ala-cart), add their healthy SF charge, you are at $100 per person before wine, tax, tip, or desert. For that price you can eat at Gary Danko! Unfortunately the service was not very good. Wine orders were forgotten, the wait staff didn't come into the room very often, the bill took forever.

After passing by this place many times we finally decided to give it a try. I made reservations for 6:45 Saturday night. We live about an hour away from SF so it's always a treat to venture into the city and play for the day. We decided to watch a movie before dinner and realized we'd be running a little late due to all the construction going on downtown. I called to let them know and was told I had a 15 min grace period so I should \"hurry up\" Really?!? I'm calling to let you know, super RUDE! Lucky for us we made it just in time! Valet parking is free so that's nice. We were seated right as we walked in. The downstairs area was small and already crammed with locals drinking the night away. We were taken upstairs which I thought would be nice, quiet and romantic...UMMMM NO! We were seated in this very small room with a bunch of other people. Our table was the smallest table I've ever sat at, I think my kids art table is bigger than the one we sat in, in fact my office is slightly smaller than the room we were put in with 20+ people. \n\nAfter adjusting to the small room we review our menus and order a drink. Our waiter was ok, he wasn't very attentive and seemed very frazzled by the amount of people he had to serve. We finally got our drinks and I look up at my husband who looks so uncomfortable and ask what's wrong. His response \"it's HOT in here\" and he was right, the room was SO HOT! So hot it was almost impossible to drink our Moscow Mojitos because we were both sweating, not my idea of a romantic dinner. After a few full cups of water we finally started to cool down. A few other couples were led to the boiling room and actually complained and requested to be moved because it was so HOT and the room was WAY TO SMALL! \n\nDinner time! I ordered the surf & turf with the bone in filet, the husband ordered the bone in new york, and we ordered the cauliflower side & portbello side, oh and we also had the crab cake appetizer. My steak was cooked perfect, a nice medium, and seasoned well. My crab was another story. When it came out it had this strange brown butter sauce over it, didn't look so appealing, at first I thought it was a mistake until I saw the side butter that was the same color. It was a very strange sauce, it wasn't horrible but it looked disgusting, not appealing at all, this very dingy brown, almost like sewer sludge. It was just different, the actual crab itself was fresh. The husbands steak was cooked perfectly, but much smaller than any other steak house we've ever been to and definitely much more expensive. We aren't afraid to pay top dollar for our steaks either, we've eaten at place like Mesa Grill in Vegas(owned by Bobby Flay) we've eaten at top steakhouses in Florida, and several in San Francisco. The sides were good, nothing I couldn't make at home. \n\nAll in all the place was just ok, for the price we paid I would have expected some awesome customer service, a table that I could actually stretch out at, a room that didn't feel like a sauna, and a meal that fit the price. I've paid 1/2 the price at other top steakhouses and received twice the food and way better service, all without dying of heat stroke.

So they've known about it, but just never bothered to fix it.      \n-  Menus are old, stained and nasty.  If you are going to charge $200 p/p for a meal, I think you should reprint your menus when they are covered in old food stains, especially when they are a simple paper print out.

Leather booths. Random clown decor, nothing homey or attractive.\n\nHowever, this can easily be overlooked because the food is rather great (but expensive):\n\n- free bread = yum! great texture and served hot for you to pull apart\n- Crab = WOW, delicious! I didn't realize this place wasn't just a steakhouse. I couldn't stop eating the crab from the appetizer to stealing off my husband's surf and turf plate.  It was so tasty I didn't even dip it in the butter, no need!\n-lobster crostini and heirloom tomato starters were both great, although a bit pricey for the portion.\n- filet = yum! I ordered it medium/medium rare since the chef suggests medium rare, however it was cooked well done on the edges. My first slice I thought they cooked the entire filet well done and was ready to tell the waiter.\n- italian cheesecake dessert - very light and fluffy compared to traditional cheesecake. it was good (i was looking for something sweet to top off the night) but wasn't GREAT or amazing.\n- sides were OK, i did not enjoy the brussel sprouts at all and am usually big on brussel sprouts. onion rings were delish!\n\nOverall, really really enjoyed our dinner with family in town.  Be prepared to drop some serious cash though - for the 6 of us with drinks at the bar before dinner and 2 bottles of wine and heavy appetizers, the bill was close to $1k. Everything good overall and we all left happy and with full bellies, but hefty tab and ambiance of the place and service both weren't top notch. However, would chose any day over a place like Ruth Chris.", "author": "Melody T."}

We waited over an hour for our table we had reserved with no acknowledgment or apologies, then sat us at a table in a room with a private party when some of the party left, and they threw together a table for us to sit at in their room.  Kids were running all over the place which is fine if you are part of the private party! The host lied to us throughout the ordeal.  Said there was another table upstairs we could move to when the guests paid their check.  But later said there were no tables.  There clearly was no manager on duty making sure things were handled right.  I would not call it an off night.  The place looked like it was in total chaos.

The meal itself didn't blow me away like a steak meal usually would!  I love meat!  I am a meat eater!! I should of been AMAZED and in heaven!  But that was not the case!  Don't get me wrong!  I ordered the 10 ounce bone in filet mignon medium rare.  I do admit.. It was good and full of flavor!!! I didn't need any sauce or peppering at all!  You definitely need side orders to accompany your steak!\n\nMy all time favorite side order here was the twice baked potato!!  The potato fell right off of the skin and was delicious with the stuffing baked in! I couldn't stop eating it!  The modern mac 'n cheese on the other hand was a disappointment.  It was average but I didn't quite enjoy it like I always do at steak houses!  I was looking forward to it too but that was a bit of a disappointment.  Portobello mushrooms were sweet and delicious as per my company say. ( i don't eat mushrooms :P ) \n\nIron skilled mussels were delicious though.  It was good for an appetizer. I liked the seasoning and how fat those mussels were.  Not some rip off of mussels that we pay so much for!  Melted butter sauce provided in the middle with bowl to throw away your shells.\n\nCrab cakes were over-fried I felt like.  It comes in a pair with some side cranberries.  It wasn't as flavorful and soft in the inside as all the other crab cakes that I have tried.  I've had better!\n\nLast but not least... I don't think I would get the crab here anymore.. Crustacean is TEN TIMES BETTER!  Crab was plain dungeness and supposedly in garlic sauce but I didn't really see much of that... That was ALSO a let down!! \n\nVenue-wise was very small!! I was surprised!  I was expecting this big steakhouse just like any other ones in the city!  But in reality, it basically is only 3 rooms! the front one is mainly the bar area with 2 private dining areas on the back and right side of the restaurant. One bathroom available.  Dark and intimate place to eat..  Decor was very confusing!  I personally am not a fan of clowns so that was a downside for me...Automatic doors so watch out or you'll get hit!\n\nService was great!

Seriously?  Just basic mediocre stuff thrown on a plate.  And I didn't have any alcohol--just a diet Coke.   The service was fine, she was very friendly.

We've heard many good things about the restaurant and were really excited to come try it out as we both loveee steak! We had reservations at 8:30pm and arrived at 8pm. They were kind enough to seat us early and also had a booth for us when we requested it when we checked in. The restaurant looked more casual than I had anticipated but it was still in a romantic setting.\n\nWe opted for their specialty bone-in filet mignon. We started off with the yellowtail Carpaccio, and ordered double mussels and double crab with our steak. Our yellowtail Carpaccio came out first and it was so thin! Of course Carpaccio's are always thin slices and I was amazed at how much flavor that dish had. It was delicious! I probably wouldn't order it again but it was fun to try. We decided to share the bone-in filet mignon, mussels, and crab. I would suggest having one come out before the other because it was hard to eat all three items at the same time before it all got cold =(. In regards to flavors, the mussels were a bit too charred, they were dry and tiny in size. It might have been left it in too long in the oven. It was still really good with the sauce to dip in it. However, the crab I absolutely loved the flavors. I would come back just for the crab! The steak was lean and was extremely tender. I enjoyed the food here.\n\nService was great, my water was always refilled. She kept checking on us to make sure we were doing okay. Anyway, corkage is only $15!

Bobo's it was.\n\nUpon arrival, I will agree with everyone's assessment that the initial greeting and hostess isn't the best.  Along with that their sign is not obvious when you pull up and I passed the valet stand and had to go around due to the lack of parking space.\n\nAnyhow, they were running about 15 minutes late with our reservation which was at 7:15PM.  Wasn't a big deal as there is a bar right when you walk in that you can grab a cold one prior to getting seated.  One thing I will say, is that I'm not a fan of the decor. Growing up terrified of clowns thanks to the movie \"IT\" really had me feeling uneasy.\n\nWe were seated on the second floor which again the decor was creepy with clowns and just the facade I'm eating in a circus. We had Jenn as our waitress and she was incredibly attentive, and patient.\n\nI already knew what I wanted to get going in based on all the reviews and the fact I've never heard of a bone-in filet mignon.  My parent's got the crab for two, and my spouse the surf and turf and we ordered a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon (I unfortunately, forgot to grab my bottle of Caymus Cabernet which the corking fee would have only be $15 bucks).  Anyhow, we settled for a bottle of Titus which wasn't bad.\n\nFor sides we got the twice baked potato, Bahama Onion Rings, and the brussel sprouts which was recommended by our waitress.\n\nMy thoughts on the items ordered:\n\n\nWe started off with two salads, apple walnut and caesar salad which we opted to share between two people.  It was a good thing that we did as they are reasonably sized.  They provide half a loaf of garlic sourdough bread which was awesome as well.  The twice baked potato was very delicious, and the onion rings were not special, and the brussel sprouts were yummy and salty. \n\nThe crab for two was so much my mom and dad didn't even finish it and had half the platter to bring home which is shocking as my mom usually can eat a ton of crab in one sitting.  The crab was cooked similar to that of the Crab House which I believe they are sister companies in some odd way down by Pier 39.  It was a little dry, which was disappointing, but the flavor was delicious.  My spouse's surf and turf is more surf than turf, but the flavor was amazing for the steak with good texture, but definitely a petite filet mignon.  \n\nOn to the main event, my dish - The bone-in filet mignon.  THE BEST PIECE OF STEAK I have ever had in my life!!!!!!!  First the amount you receive is massive, and looks overwhelming.  When I initially put my fork to it and my knife to the meat I can tell it was extremely tender as I barely had to apply pressure it just cut like butter.  The outside is charred and you see the pretty color of pink for a medium rare steak with a dark crust.  Should be used for a food magazine of perfection. At this point my mouth was salivating just looking at how perfect it was.  As I brought it to my mouth O-M-F-G, it literally melted in your mouth.  I may have said that line before for steak, but this is by far the most tender piece of meat I have ever had and the flavor just bursts in your mouth.  Wow - I wish I was more articulate for those reading this review for you to really understand how that initial 5 seconds felt, but it literally is the best thing I have ever eaten.  I continued to carve away at this juicy tenderness that had texture similar to ahi tuna steaks in some way, but a steak.  I ate as much as I could, but it conquered me and I was forced to save the rest, which I must say I ate this morning and it still blew me away the next day which never happens.  It wasn't as good as last night, but it taste on the level that I  usually get at Alexander's Steakhouse filets without the unnecessary sauces.\n\nIf you're big on steaks you have to come to this steak house and order the bone-in  filet mignon as it really is to die for  The best $44 bucks I have ever spent.  Next time I know I'll order this steak with no sides to make sure I can finish it along with a bottle of Joseph Phelps Insignia or Backus to really compliment my meal...Freaking amazing just thinking about it gets me giddy that I had to grab a beer while writing this review.\n\nTo end the night we got the dunce cap cones, which comes with 4 little cones, with this delicious chocolate mousse, raspberry, and chocolate sauce on the plate.  Delicious as well.\n\nAnyhow, I would have given them 4 stars due to their hostess, but the steak did more than over compensate for the minor hiccup of the night!!", "author": "Angeline Z."}

So went last night and had a great time.\n\nThere were three of us; we ordered the yellowtail carpaccio which was fantastic.  Also as an appetizer we got the lobster crostini.  The crostini came with a hemisphere of mozzarella which was as soft as butter and a perfect complement to the lobster.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the surf and turf, a petit filet with a half crab.  My friend ordered the bone-in filet.  When the steaks arrived, I won't lie: we didn't speak a word the entire time we ate.  The meat was that good.  I started with the steak because in my experience shellfish takes longer to cool.  But I switched back and forth, and even dipped some filet in the crab butter which was exquisite (they must have used clarified butter or something).  The petit filet was perfectly tender, and melted in my mouth.  The char was just the right amount of crispiness and not overseasoned.  Then I got to the crab.  The shells were perfectly brittle and were easy to break.  The meat separated easily from the shell--a sign of a perfectly cooked and prepared shellfish.  I also had a taste of the whitefish which, as would be expected, was perfect.\n\nThen, the dessert.  Got the \"dunce caps\" which were awesome, and a raspberry-chocolate cake.  Highly recommended.  And of course, to top it off we had a couple rounds of smokey Old Fashioneds.\n\nI highly recommend Bobo's for the perfect steak night!!", "author": "Foodie B."}

I even asked if they had a different sauce (cocktail sauce perhaps!?) and no, it was just more butter.  Maybe it's because I prefer either Asian / Italian styles of cooked crab (Vietnamese, Chinese or in a good cioppino!), but this just didn't do it for me.

Amazing.\n\nMy bf & his co-workers had been here a few times & he loved it. \"We HAVE to go there sometime,\" he said emphatically. \"You will love it.\"\n\nWhat can I say? The boy knows me. We made a reservation for four on a Friday evening, and I was not disappointed.\n\nI am given to understand that all of the appetizers are amazing (and when a large group of them go, they just order one or two of everything), but being only four, we limited ourselves to the yellowtail carpaccio, the crab cakes, and the Dungeness crab crostini. All were fantastic. I could've eaten another serving of any one of them.\n\nThen my bone-in filet mignon showed up. Now, I am from Texas, my dad is a butcher, and my housemate dry-ages his own meat regularly. I know from beef. I'll admit that I'm still making the rounds when it comes to SF steakhouses, but I've been to a couple, and Bobo's filet mignon beat them all. It was *at least* 1.5 inches thick. Maybe 2 inches. And flawlessly medium rare. The meat was juicy, flavorful, and succulent throughout.\n\nI ate the whole thing.\n\nI didn't want to waste too much space on sides, but my bf insisted that I would adore the Swiss chard, so we ordered it, and I did. (Don't order this if you don't like garlic. I adore garlic.) Again, I could've made a meal on that alone.\n\nThe wine selection was solid, with all the obligatory steak- and seafood-friendly options, and the mark-up was quite reasonable. If you want to know a secret, skip the triple-digit cabs & get a bottle of the Green & Red Syrah as we did -- in addition to good fruit and a subtle earthy component, it was older than most of the cabs, a third to a quarter of the price, and paired fantastically with the steak. Now that is what I call a hidden gem.\n\nOur server was helpful, knowledgeable, friendly, and always around when we needed her. Perfection.\n\nI can't wait to go back.", "author": "Angela B."}

It was an anniversary dinner, so I wanted to have dinner at a place that was classy, with great food and a nice atmosphere.  I usually get that at Bobo's, but this time, not so much.\n\nTo start off, the restaurant was fairly empty, but they sat everyone that was coming in in the tiny dining space downstairs.  As soon as we sat down, the music turned off.  When I asked if they could turn it back on, they said it was down and the IT guys were looking into it.  On top of that, the air conditioning was not working, so the front door was left open, so we had to eat amidst conversations of other diners (I can usually tune out with music going in the background) and with the noise of traffic from Lombard Street.  \n\nI don't think you can get a better steak in the City, but I don't think it's right for a $200+ meal to be in the equivalent of a high school cafeteria with no a/c.", "author": "C H."}

The Maitre d at the front told us that a couple near the window will be leaving soon and that we can take that table. We did end up waiting about 10-15 mins before we were seated. This was not a problem since we were about 20 mins early before our reservations. Our waitress was very welcoming and nice. Me and my gf started with some wine and Lobster Crostini. The appetizer was delicious. The big half loaf of bread was also a good side for our pre meal.We both ordered the Surf & Turf. I had the Bone-in filet mignon and my gf got the petite filet mignon. The meat was juicy and tasty. The crab was perfectly cooked. I'm not one to order crab all the time because it's work to break open all those shells lol. I wasn't disappointed in the fact that the crab meat was delicious. For our side dishes, we ordered the Twice Baked Potato and Mod Mac. I enjoyed the twice baked potato, but on other hand the Mod mac wasn't up to par for my standards. The Mac was over cooked and the flavor didn't surprise me much. I would have to try it again to give it another chance, but I wouldn't eat it again if it comes out the same way. This was our first time dining here. Besides the okay Mod mac, Everything went our way that night. No complaints and no bad food/service.

The assorted accessories throughout make for some interesting scenery.  Despite the close quarters, the friendliness of the hostess, bartender and other staff make it a welcoming place.\n\nNow for the eats...  The lobster crostini arrived with fresh garlic aioli avocado & red onions and burrata (Italian cheese made with mozarella and cream).  It was a delectable little starter bursting with fresh flavors.  (Ultimately, I enjoyed this more than the main course.)  Their entrees are fairly large, so my bf and I decided to split the bone-in filet mignon which neither of us had recalled seeing on a menu before.  The filet is usually served without the bone.  It arrived with a soft, juicy palatable texture which melted in our mouths.   For sides, we indulged in brussels sprouts with pancetta and portobello mushrooms- both of which were average.  The brussel sprouts could have been a little greener to retain fresher flavors.  I'm not big on eating veggies cooked to a more yellowish green.  The portobello mushrooms were decent but nothing incredible to rave about.\n\nThe service here was wonderful and attentive.  Overall the food was acceptable but nothing superbly special justifying the exorbitant prices.  Valet parking is free which is a nice amenity but ultimately, the fat bill at the end of the night justifies the compliments.", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

It was a little more rare than I am used to but the steak was so darn good I didn't even care. I also ordered the swiss chard which was meh and the crab cakes which everyone was raving about. It was just okay. I feel like the crab cakes appetizer was too dry with the cranberries on the bottom. If there was a sauce or something that evened out the crab cakes it couldve been much much better. \n\nThe decor sucks. It's dim and a little dingy.... not sure how that would make a steakhouse appealing at all. \n\nthey have complimentary valet parking which is nice. \n\nOverall for what you're paying for it's not totally worth it.

We started off with the hamachi carpaccio which was light and refreshing. We ordered the bone in filet mignon, the crab and muscles platter, the bacon and brussel sprouts, and the twice baked mash potatoes. The meat was juicy and tender, but lacked flavor. The crab and muscles came out sizzling on a great big platter, but they too lacked flavor. I had to \"chase\" our entrees with the sides in order to keep my palate entertained.

I should have sent it back, but was with clients. The next day was stricken with the worst food poisoning ever. Called the restaurant to ask if they had similar issues. The woman did not answer my question, but said she would have the manager call me back. No word until I called back a few days later and spoke to Jim; this is after also sending an email. Expressed that I should not have to pay for a meal that made me so sick and caused me to miss work and several meetings. While my bill was 1,400 (not inc the bar tab) for 9 people, all I wanted was for them to make up for my situation and said I did not expect them to comp the entire meal as that would not be fair. Jim said he had to speak to the manager, and would call me the next day. After over a week of several attempts to reach Jim, I finally was able to reach him last night.

This is probably one of the main reasons I do come to Bobos (....free valet!!!!!!). The cranberries that come with the appetizer is to die for. I could eat a whole tub of those things. The crab cakes never disappoint me, EVER!!!! If you come to Bobos and do not order them, you are definitely missing out. Along with the crab cakes, my boyfriend ordered the lobster soup. It was mediocre, maybe because I am not a fan of American soups (they are often drenched with sodium and just do not taste appetizing to me). He loved it, and even dipped some of the complimentary bread into the soup (which he liked as well).\n\nI ordered the double order of mussels and he ordered the filet mignon without the bone as our entrees. The mussels were okay, I ordered shrimp here before and was not very satisfied. Yes, Boboquivari's is a steakhouse, but that does not mean that the seafood has to taste strange. I tried a piece of the boyfriend's filet mignon and it was SO good. I normally am not a beef eater but I LOVED it!

We wanted to reserved a table 2-3 weeks prior to get an early time. Every single date we mentioned, all they have available is 9:30pm. It's for a table of 11. We were wondering, why so late at 9:30pm?! That's left over meat for us and the chef probably wants to go home. \n\nAnyhoo, we got there by 9:30pm and the place was weirded out. The entrance is off to the side. Felt awkward. It was too dark inside. Saw the bar and didn't know where the host was. Finally the hostess took us upstairs to our table. Ohhh, no wonder they reserved us at 9:30pm. It's because the restaurant is hecka small. Not too many tables. \n\nGot our menus and yes, it's expensive. Not too much on the menu. I got the bone-in filet mignon with baked potato. I loved the baked potato. So velvety good. I also took a sample of other dishes at the table. The macaroni & cheese was very good. And so is the crab cakes. The filet mignon was delicious. Moist & tasty. Seasoned just right. It's actually one of the best filet mignon I've had. Huge portion. I couldn't finish it because it was too stuffy inside the dining area. The dining room upstairs is so small & boxy. All 4-5 tables were filled up in the tiny room. I was feeling hot, nauseated and feel like fainting mid-way thru. Had to get up and stretch for some fresh air outside. Usually I don't box my steak to go but this time, I had to. I'm glad I brought it home because my left over was even more delicious. \n\nI would've rated a 4 star but since I've never experienced a dining room so small with no air ventilation & 9:30pm reservation, had to give it a 3 star rating.

As I mentioned above, the seafood section should not be ignored (it's San Francisco after all).  The crab was very flavorful as were the mussels which were perfectly cooked and had no hint of fishiness.  For the steaks we ordered the bone-in filets.  It's possible they would allow you to order a regular filet mignon sans bone-in, but I doubt they would recommend it if the bone-in is available.  It was an excellently cooked medium-rare steak and full of flavor, especially with the hot melted butter sauce it's served on.  I enjoyed every bite of mine and hers when she couldn't finish it all (it's a pretty hefty portion).  The sides were excellent as well -- the brussel sprouts and twice baked potato paired well with our steaks.  For dessert we shared the chocolate bomb which was a very nice and sweet finish to a very delicious and filling meal.\n\nFriendly service and healthy pours of wine!  \n\nWe finished the night off with a visit to their new spot, Bobo's Lounge (adjacent to Bobo's, just up the hill), which was really quite awesome.  A very well decorated and ornate interior with obvious Venetian inspiration, but also had a comfortable and casual atmosphere.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of the food which is very different from Bobo's menu.\n\n4.5 stars.", "author": "Erich D."}

After about 15 minutes, I was impressed by this restaurants decor, and service. Our waiter was very friendly and offered his expertise and advice on every dish. We both ordered bone in filet, and lobster crusto? as well as some portobella mushrooms to have on the side of our steak. Though the lobster appetizer was small, it was incredible. Tender, tasty, and with a side of cheese that I have never had before. I was very happy after the lobster, and was enjoying it with the wine I ordered. \n\nOn to the steak. This was a steak like I have not ever had before. I have had some great steak, and this definitely joins the pack. The filet was grilled perfectly, and the top was seared and glazed with a sauce that was delicious but not too sweet. I thought it was perfect.\n\nWe sort of rushed out, because we were meeting with some friends after, but next time I go here, I would like to hang out for some time, have a few more drinks, and suck up the ambiance.", "author": "Rick B."}

Steaks are incredible. Big slice of cow for the money, tender and tasty. Bobo's is very San Francisco, tourists looking for something memorable, won't be disappointed. I also like their lounge/bar just a few doors down. We arrived 30 minutes early, not knowing what traffic would be like and enjoyed a Bulleit Rye until our table was ready. Even though tables are placed closely together, sound is dampened and you hardly notice any conversation but your own. This is something I would like to see more of in other restaurants. This really makes a difference in your experience.Service is top notch. \n\nHighly recommended!", "author": "Steve S."}

I've dined at Bobo's for many years and have generally have enjoyed a great steak with good appetizers and overall excellent service.  Unfortunately, this my last experience was just not.   \n\nA little background: we are a group of 6-8 guys that get together to laugh, eat, tell stories and enjoy a night on the town together.  We're easy going, well traveled and all have solid steakhouse dining resume's.  We have a level of expectations when it comes to steak houses:  Attentive service, good drinks and an excellent steak.  Attitude does not matter as long as our waiter has a good sense of humor and knows how to take care of his or her clients.  With a bill that now often exceeds $1000 and tip that often exceeds $200, we think it's fair to hold these expectations.  \n\nUnfortunately, Bobo's service completely missed this mark and really the reason for this review.  To start, our server was slow to welcome us to the restaurant, slow to take our drink order, slow to bring the drinks, slow to bring water, etc... Similar to the current 49er offense, there was no sense of urgency to simply attend to the basics you would expect to make a group of hungry men happy while they await their feast.  I got the feeling that the entire restaurant staff a had recently turned over.  This was no longer the Bobo's I'd come to know and love.  \n\nOK, we've got our drinks and are ready to order wine.  My friend is a bit of an oenophile and Bobo's showed us a wine list that included a number of 2010 Cabernet's that we thought would be good to enjoy with our meal.  We chose two bottles from a single winery.  Our waiter brought the wine, two bottles of... 2011.  No problem, easy mistake.  However, instead of apologizing for the oversight, our waiter suggested that there was no difference.  No difference, eh??  OK, no thank you, please check to see that you have the 2010.  Waiter returns, \"no we do not\".  Here is our wine list again.  OK, we select another 2010 from a different winery.  Waiter comes back with two more bottles... of 2011.  Hmmm.. now we're getting frustrated, we select a third 2010 on the menu.... again, sold out.  \n\nNow, I'm not sure how many people notice when their waiter brings the wrong vintage of a wine, but in San Francisco, that is a huge mistake.  Some steakhouses have aspiring sommelier's as waiters.  Evidently, Bobo's does not.  We're now a little ticked off as the manager arrives.  He gives us a song and dance about how they were in the process of updating their wine list, blah, blah, blah, but it's too late.  I'm now convinced he's lying to me and that they were trying to rip us off.  How many other patrons noticed the year swap that night?  Am I being too sensitive regarding wine list vintages?  I think not.\n\nTo their credit, they amazingly found a few 2010's of a well known Cabernet that were not on the list.  Saving them for their regular clients maybe?  Unfortunately at that point, the damage was done.  \n\nI am hoping this review gets read by management and the issues are resolved.  In the meantime, If you're looking for an experienced waitstaff, accurate wine list, or to impress someone, search elsewhere for now.  If you're just plain hungry, the bone in filet is quite excellent!", "author": "Wile C."}

I took three close friends there for a \"thank you dinner\" after they helped me move.\n\nI budgeted for about $450 for the meal and it turned out to not quite cover our costs. Had to borrow a bit from one of my guests (whom I repaid shortly thereafter with another meal at a better restaurant).\n\nSo, onto the Bobo experience. Walked in the door and was met with some very gaudy circus decor that included very random elements: dusty feathers on the hostess podium do not bode well for kitchen hygiene. The red, imitation velvet carpet was threadbare. Their strategy of keeping the lighting very dim is probably for the best; it is a place that I'd be loathe to lay eyes on in the daylight.\n\nIn short, the food was incredibly salty. I don't know if a new chef was working, or some sort of sodium frenzied saboteur was manning the gas range, but each dish, from the crab and shrimp starters, to the very cold twice baked potatoes we ordered to accompany our entrees, featured enough salt to pay a legion of Roman soldiers.\n\nThe only redeeming quality was the service. Our waitress was very attentive and nice and seemed to commiserate with our plight. When I complained to the manager on the way out, she nodded in agreement and told him - \"this is what I have been talking about.\" I did not demand a refund or another meal (don't want to develop hypertension). Just politely suggested that he look into the kitchen sitch. \n\nI worked in the restaurant business for many years so always treat servers and other restaurant staff with great respect, so I did not make a scene or place undeserved blame - just expressed my disappointment. \n\nHonestly, with the money spent for a truly awful dinner, I could have taken them all to Gary Danko's.

He wanted steak and I wanted seafood, and what a great marriage we found in Bobo's.  \n\nCame early, and thought the bar area was a bit casual.  Not a problem to me, but I felt a little out of place with my 'dressier' clothes for a nice night out.\n\nWere seated promptly, upstairs in a corner that was like a makeshift space.  3 walls all around us, except for my back which was the only way out.  Did NOT like this space at all because we somehow were close to the 'waiter's corner' since all we heard were slamming dishes and clanging from the kitchen.  That's why Bobo's didnt get 5 stars. If could otherwise suggest for them to just dish this spot because this is where you'll definately lose stars, even if your food is wonderful tasty. \n\nStarted the night with their Hamachi.  YUM!  Wonderful marinade of soysauce, ponzu sauce, and their own taste.\n\nOut comes their mussles and shrimp sizzling platter I couldnt keep my hands off of!  My mouth is watering just talking about it.  Olive oil, garlic, salt, (probably some butter) all hot on a sizzling plate.  I could taste it in my mouth just talking about this dish again.  I would suggest to get more shrimp, since this 1/2 combo comes out with a heaping serving of mussles, but only about 5 shrimp.\n\nHe ordered the porterhouse, great mix of a tbone and filet minon.  I had a small bite, and it taste wonderful!  I ended with the full crab. Tasty, AND fresh!  You can tell the crab was newly cooked/killed because the crab meat was hearty and filled the shell.  \n\n One last gripe.  If you plan on going elsewhere after this restaurant and dont mind the smell of 'food', this is a great place to visit.  Otherwise, you'll be better off bringing a pair of changing clothes, because the ventilation is HORRIBLE.", "author": "Barb B."}

I guess it's better than overcooked. The NY steak my bf ordered was not as good, and he was upset that how much bigger the potion should be for the $50 steak. True. The side order we got were mushroom and swiss chard. They were both very good but toward the end it started to taste too rich with butter. The Mango Panna Cotta was delicious! It was smaller but light and nicely flavored. Also the chocolate mouse was very light and very yummy!\n\nThe only thing about this place is that this is really a casual place meaning some people are dressed in sweatshirts. We were sat in the back in a more intimate section so it made it ok, but it made my head tilted to see a casual place like this with oldschool decor charging this much. Also a cocktail was $14.

They told us about their lounge right next door which we could wait at, which we did and it was lovely! We walked back over at 7:45 and our table was ready. We ordered our drinks and those were brought out relatively quick. Next we ordered appetizers, we got the crab crustini and steak tartar. The crab crustini was good but I felt it was lacking something. However the steak tartar was amazing. The waiter started off by presenting it, which was amazing. He also prepared it at the table. I've never had steak tartar so I can't compare to anything but this tasted delicious!! My main course and side came, I ordered the bone-in filet(rare),which they are known for. For the side we ordered swiss chard. The sides comes family style, which I enjoyed. For me rare, is when you cut it and blood runs. It was SLIGHTLY more cooked then that, which I didn't mind but cooked more then I had asked. None the less my steak was delicious. Buttery, pan fried delicious! And the Swiss chard was just as good, VERY garlicky and citrusy. After having ordered several drinks , we then decided to order/share a skillet of half crab and mussels. The presentation was beautiful and I loved being able to crack my own crab. HOWEVER the first issue that I had was they brought us a whole crab and mussels, when we only asked for half. I also felt the crab was slightly over cooked. In my opinion crab is best served slightly warm, this crab was literally scorching hot. We had a table in the top floor and it was rather warm.

First of all, we were seated about 25 minutes after our reservation time.  As we were waiting at the bar to be seated, the bartender accidentally spilled an entire drink on the bar which drenched my pants and my dry clean only sweater.  He managed to clean up the drink before even offering me a napkin to dry off and there was no apology.  We ended up paying the $30 bar tab for 2 drinks.\n\nOnce we were seated, I was really looking forward to a good dinner.  The shrimp, salad, and bread were all fine.  However, we then waited a long time for the rest of our food and as soon as our meals was brought out we were immediately disappointed.  The sides were COLD, and our steaks were lukewarm, so obviously the food had been sitting for some time after it was ready before it was brought to us.  It took us a long time to flag the waitress down, and when we finally let her know what was going on she took everything back.  I have never had to send food back at a restaurant before.\n\nOnce the food was brought back out, she let us know that they were really trying to not overcook our steaks given they had to reheat it.  They did manage to not overcook it, however only the edges of the steaks truly got warm and about 3 bites into the steaks they were still lukewarm.  We actually abandoned our steaks in order to save ourselves the embarrassment of sending them back for a second time.  We each only had a few bites of our steak, and we just focused on the sides which weren't all that great either after having had to be reheated.\n\nAll in all, we paid over $200 for a meal for two people that was very disappointing with no apology from the restaurant.", "author": "Marissa P."}

The mushrooms were a little too salty for my liking, same with the swiss chard, but both were flavored well.  \n\nThe only bad thing I'd say, maybe because it was v-day's, was that upstairs the seating is so cramped that I think I learned too much about other peoples' lives that night, and would've instead liked to have more space.", "author": "Liz W."}

The decor is kitchy, cute and has a lot of personality but could use some re-vamping. While the food was nowhere near terrible, the price point was pretty expensive. While I've come to expect at these types of \"touristy traps\" in and around San Francisco, I feel like that raises the standard & I was not very impressed. I will say that the one memorable thing here was the crab cakes were to die for - and this is coming from a person who doesn't even eat crab. However, the steaks could use some serious work - filet mignon was fine but the porterhouse was not what I was expecting. The top of it was completely charred, the inside way tooo rare - not the way we had ordered. They were also flavorless. The sides could use some work & be a little more creative than just some veggies tossed in EVOO/salt. If you plan to share 'em, be aware they're quite small. I was really looking forward to this place to celebrate my SO's birthday. I opted to come here instead of our typical steakhouse fav's, Ruth's Chris or Morton's - I'm definitely made a wrong choice.", "author": "Sia P."}

But I had such a depressing experience this evening at a restaurant that was awarded 4 stars on Yelp that I felt I needed to do something to right this wrong.\n\nWe were in search of a good steak restaurant to take my brother who was visiting from out of town for his birthday - and Bobo's was recommended by a friend and I also decided to validate the recommendation by checking on Yelp and thought 4 stars with 1000+ reviews must mean the restaurant is pretty darned good.\n\nHow disappointed we were!\n\nFirst off, what kind of steak restaurant does not carry Ribeye!? Waiter recommended New York Steak instead claiming it was more marbled than the Filet Mignon and therefore a closer choice to a Ribeye. My brother and I looked at each other and thought - really? But we reserved our judgement till the steak arrived.\n\nFirst, a review of the bread - it was dripping with garlic oil - definitely not the most appetizing loaf I've seen.\n\nNext, a review of the appetizers - the lobster soup was nasty - the description on the menu said \"in a mild curry brodetto\" - there was nothing mild about the curry, it was quite overpowering and the consistency of the soup was a cornstarchy goupy mess and the lobster was nowhere to be found.\n\nThe lobster crostini with burrata was a much better option - although the combo of smoked salmon and lobster was kinda odd, but at least the burrata was creamy and fresh and delicious.\n\nNext up, the steak and seafood - my brother ordered the NY Steak (on account of it being more marbled), but of course it really wasn't and my husband ordered the Petit Filet Mignon.  Neither steak was very impressive (NY Steak was kinda dry) and they were definitely way over-priced for the quality.\n\nThe shrimp was swimming in oil and wasn't particularly fresh.\n\nThe twice baked potato was overly creamed and disgusting and the brussel sprouts with pancetta was (once again - theme of this restaurant clearly) swimming in oil.  \n\nWe were so disappointed with the meal we decided to cut our losses and skip dessert.\n\nLastly, the ambiance - it was kinda a depressing place - the carpets were worn and tired, and the ventilation in the restaurant wasn't good, resulting in the whole place smelling of oily steaks.  They had to keep the door to the patio open to create ventilation which made for a very cold evening, but at least that way you didn't entirely reek of an oily steak.\n\nI say, save yourself some money and go to Ponderosa instead - you won't be missing that much, that's how bad this place was!", "author": "Nik T."}

She snapped in to action, letting the kitchen know to delay our meal until we were ready, and brought extra water.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-12-06", "description": "I came here about six months ago. It was not planned for - we were just looking for a place to eat and one of the divas in the group just really wanted steak. We tried to catch HOPR but we wouldn't have been able to make it before closing. Yah, we were eating pretty darn late. The only one still open at the time and within walking distance was lo and behold, Bobo's. Honestly, I was not really impressed and if you've already read Jenny C.'s review (http://tinyurl.com/d4rkf8m), mine is not gonna be that much different.\n\nThe ambiance is what you expect out of a fancy-shmancy restaurant - dark, quiet with lots of maroon colored decor. Considering the time and day (I think it was a weekday) we were here, it was uber quiet. Our complimentary bread was a garlic topped bread which was surprisingly pretty hard. Maybe it was because it was late in the night. Still, it's complimentary so can't really complain about that.\n\nJenny and I ordered a filet to split with a side of mac n cheese. The filet was whatever. Not as tender as other places I've had and the mac n cheese was just okay. I felt it didn't have enough of the gooey cheesiness I usually like. The baked potato on the hand was the winner of the table - warm and super buttery.\n\nIt was quite an unsatisfactory meal for me and just to make myself feel a little better, I took a few of their matches.", "author": "Linh V."}

I have been craving an excellent rare steak.\n2.  Wanted to spend the experience with the funny man.\n3.  Friends all recommended the \"Bone-In Filet Mignon.\n\nAfter locating a much treasured parking space two blocks away, I dreaded the entrance because it was so reminiscent of a cheesy steak house I've been to in Chicago :  outlandish colors, stripes reminding me of a joker's cap, and the usual crimson lining the rugs/walls.\n\nActuality, it was not too bad, even though I had requested a window seat.  We were seated in a corner alcove complete with drawn curtains in the need we required privacy during the consumption of the meat.\n\nWe both requested the bone-in filet mignon, because I kept on repeating at the dinner table and of course, I requested it rare.  I did not order any sides as I heard they were mediocre for the pricing listed and the bread with drizzled olive oil.  \n\nOur steaks came out in record time, since I have usually waited around an hour or so (Ruth Chris for example) and let me just state this:\n\nA large baseball cut of the filet mignon, with the bone in, immaculate in conception from the grill to my station...cutting into it was smooth and effortless, literally a bite of silken heaven.  Seared on the outside, and rare, with the perfect cool center.  \n\nThe steak was so large, I could not finish it.  \n\nService is pretty good in that our waiter was quite attentive and patient, given the numerous side conversations \"w\" and I had that took up most of our decision time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-22", "description": "Sidenote:  I used to laugh every time I heard someone say they went to \"Bobo's\" for dinner because it sounded like some sort of restaurant in an Italian mob movie.  Seriously, it's like it's straight out of Goodfellas or something; I could imagine Ray Liotta narrating a line like, \"Paulie got whacked at Bobo's for ratting to the feds about Gino\" and Joe Pesci on the screen staring down some dead body.  Okay, anyways, on to the review!\n\nThe place is somewhat oddly shaped, as there's apparently tiers of seating areas for customers.  Didn't really see how big the other areas were though, as we sat in the small dining section right by the bar, just off the hostess podium.  We were seated pretty promptly after we claimed our reservation time (party of four), and the waitress we had was pretty nice throughout our meal.\n\nTo kick off our meal, we decided to split a couple of their appetizers to go with our entrees.  The first was the Heirloom Tomato dish served with avocado, onions, and burrata cheese.  It was my first time trying burrata (that I know of) and it was some good stuff.  Definitely liked how it had a creamy texture but still retained that stringy mozzarella consistency.  The second was the Dungeness Crab Crostini with smoked salmon, avocado, and burrata.  SO DELICIOUS.  Even though avocado and burrata is listed in both, the two dishes tasted so different.  Made up entirely of some of my favorite things, I only wish they had more than just two crostinis on the plate.  Lastly, they give a plate of bread that seems like it's been baked with olive oil.  Pretty nice having that flavor built right in, but didn't eat much of it to save space for the steak.\n\nAnd speaking of the meatiness goodness, we each ordered their signature cut - the bone-in filet mignon.  Generally, I think filet mignon can be a little overrated; sure, the meat is tender but it can also be a little lean for my liking.  That's not to say filet mignon isn't good, just that depending on how it's prepared, it doesn't strike me as amazing as everyone raves.  This one though, was pretty damn good.  I don't know if it's because the bone was still attached or if it was the butter sauce left over from cooking, but lots of natural juices, great flavor, and still oh so tender.\n\nFor sides, we decided to try two - the Mac n Cheese and the Baked Yams.  The Mac N Cheese was just okay, and I've had better.  I didn't notice a crunchy topping which disappointed me, and the cheesey part was almost like a pasta sauce.  They might have been able to salvage it if they drizzled some truffle oil on top (truffle oil can do that to a dish).  As for their baked yams, not bad but I think the one at Ruth's Chris is better.  Creamy texture with minimal lumps gave it a sort of mashed potatoes consistency, but sweeter than it's pale counterpart (especially with the brown sugar sprinkled on top).\n\nAs for dessert, our table split an order of the Dunce Cap Cones - four mini waffle cones filled with chocolate mousse with an ancho chili pepper chocolate sauce.  Pretty tasty dish, but halfway through the cone, you realize that the mousse filling stops.  It'd be nice if it was fully filled, but I guess that might also be too much of a good thing.  I don't know if I would get an order for just myself in the future, but certainly I would split it again with a friend/date (in this case, three other guys...no wonder the waitress gave us an odd look).  It went really well with their black coffee (which was really good) and, oddly enough, the red wine I still had left.\n\nI was going to give them a four star review for their average sides, but I'm going to bump them to five stars specifically for the bartender and waitress, and their free valet.  While waiting for a couple of the guys to show up, the bartender was nice enough to comp a sprite for me (yeah, yeah...was saving myself for the three bottles of wine we brought).  As for the waitress, she was really accommodating of our request for three wine glasses each just so that we could settle an ongoing bet of which of my three friends could pick the best wine.  Overall, will definitely come back again for the crostini appetizer, their steak, and to try their crab (looked good at the neighboring table).", "author": "Mike L."}

It came around time to go eat. We got back there and were greeted nicely and they sat us down. Seats are close and cozy next to other which is fine didnt bother us. We started off with water, then I ordered a glass of champagne,  and my husband said cocktail. We checked out the menu, my husband had the bone in fillet in mind yet a guest at the bar \"lounge\" told my husband the bone in ribeye was delicious... So he ordered the bone in ribeye. I LOVE seafood. ( cooked and hot plates) I ordered the crab and double shirmp. As we waited we chatted about how nice the place was and pretty fancy. Food comes out. .. most amazingly looking shrimp and crab! !! My husband ribeye looked great as well! We dug in. ... honestly I would say that was the BEST can and shirmp I've ever had.

I has a fly in my water!  My husband was so embarrassed and upset at the fact we go to a nice fancy elegant  restaurant and their is a FLY. As we try to get our waitresses attention the bus boy comes by and my husband shows him the fly. He goes to the waitress and shows her the cup. Time passes and she brings another water cup and whispers \" here you are\"  NOT EVEN AN APOLOGY!  We were almost done so we asked for the check. It was 180$ and we left her a 20% tip even after that! We didnt say anything we were too upset. My plate was AMAZING yet we should have received and apology of some sort. Would I come here again?

My parents taught me not to lick my fingers when eating at a restaurant. But being a Filipino and trained to eat with our hands came in handy at Bobo's. (You should at least know how to eat with your hands in theory even if you don't do it in practice if you are a Pinoy kid.) \n\nBecause at Bobo's, you'll get the best of both worlds:  STEAK AND SEAFOOD. \n\nAnd my Filipino seafood eating skills were put to the test. Who needs those metal thingy-s to crack crab claws? Bite into it and use your choppers!\n\nOur dinner date started at 5:30 PM. We were seated at a  super-tiny corner booth but the cuteness of the hanging colorful ribbons to give us privacy from the next booth made up for the feeling that we were being put on \"time out\" in the corner. Couples and groups of friends dressed to the nines started pouring in.  They got the bigger, padded booths. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=KaPc4oNFfee6bKmp1BAsMQ\n\nThe decor at Bobo's  might be playful but  there is nothing funny about Boboquivari's food and service. They definitely do not clown around when it came down to the real thing: steak, seafood, bread and their server. Our server was very attentive and friendly.\n\nDRINK AND BREAD: And few minutes later, I was sipping a BOBOTINI (yummy but not strong enough) and devouring the half loaf of HOT, garlic bread oozing with butter that was served to us almost as soon as we sat down. (Note: I finished almost this half-loaf by myself with little help from fiance.)  So addicting!!!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=Q-BC1kHEsfjPzyVgpM-ejQ\n\nSEAFOOD APPETIZER: And not long after that, fiance and I got down and dirty. How could you not when you have a GIGANTIC SKILLET OF PRAWNS AND CRAB placed  in front of you! Delicious seafood very seasoned in butter and herbs served with 3 flavored butter sauces for dipping.  They were on the dry side and the prawns were not plump but they were delicious none the less.  I have no mercy and took home the last 5 prawns left. And that's just for appetizer! ($40)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=soimFTR-upzbcZIPXEVHBQ\n\nSTEAK: And the FILET MIGNON STEAK! Bone-in for fiance ($40), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=uLL3OSFIaqbDL2gdAMiUOA petite for me ($30).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=DXG7nIeCMI-uZR4Y6iClNg Bone-in Filet Mignon is the MAIN ATTRACTION. Bobo's signature steak. Both steaks were so tender. Melt.in.your.mouth. Period.\n\nSIDE: As if we didn't have enough, we ordered a side dish of TWICE BAKED POTATO ($8).  Big enough to share but ending up to be not our fave. We had two bites each and decided we did not like it. Tasted like a veggie quiche on top of the half-potato. Very untraditional. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=IVNdN8WggJolVzPsjli6eQ\n\nDESSERT: And a CHOCOLATE BOMB ($8))! A mound of chocolate with truffle-like consistency drizzled with raspberry glaze. Even this lacto could not resist! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=R5ipc1QOrgSdXpJnl5BIAw\n\nTAB: $180 including 2 diet cokes, tax and 20% tip.  Pricey but definitely a very enjoyable dinner.\n\nBy the way, I licked my fingers all throughout dinner and I didn't care. My parents were not there to scold me!", "author": "Leah E."}

Dungeness crab wasn't as fresh or tasty as I thought it was going to be...especially for the price.\n4. Everytime one of the servers brought out our food, they placed the food down infront of the wrong people.

Highly recommended is the bone in filet mignon, not seen on steak menus very often.  The sides are quite expensive but good.  I would order the larger steak and take it easy on the sides.  The only drawback to Bobo's is the way overpriced drinks.  For example,  Lagavulan scotch whiskey goes for 30 dollars a glass!  Price at Costco for a BOTTLE is around 65 dollars.

Here is what I say, and what should matter to you:\n\n1) They pride themselves on having a \"bone in\" filet.  I say nonesense.  Get yourself edumacated and look it up if that is what's making you salivate: that's false advertising for a more \"prime\" cut of a T-bone or Porterhouse (aka New York Strip w/ bone in you smucks).  So stop raving about this.  But yes, a T-bone steak is generally juicy because it is cooked with the bone in.\n\n2) What IS worth raving about is their wine list.  You can get yourself some good wines here at somewhere closer to 2x the retail range.  And they have a great wine list.  THAT my friends is why you would come all the way out here to the middle of nowhere to eat.\n\n3) Food is good, but very traditional.  \n\nService I hear is hit or miss.  I had great service here.

Our table was not ready until 9:30 pm!!! What kind of surprise do you think our beloved friend got?!?! \n\nSure, the hostess did apologize and told us that some people take longer than others.  But I honestly think that's an excuse for bad time management.  Having gone to plenty of comparable fine dining establishments, a one hour wait is unheard of!!  By the time we got a table, we might as well have just walked in at 9:30 pm without reservations at all.\n\nI say, if you can't handle reservations, don't take any at all!  \n\nI had already originally asked for a 7:30 pm reservation.  Given that you offered me a 8:30 pm reservation, could you at least have made it on time?!?  In total, that was a 2 hour delay!!! \n\n2) Highly overrated food, high prices! I'm okay with paying high prices for either impeccable service or great tasting food.  However, as stated, service was terrible given that we had to wait for an hour!  You would think after waiting for an hour, they'd treat you nicer or give you bread/ water once you took a seat, but even then things took forever!  We had to ask for our bread! The steak was a decent sized cut, but the texture was bad for 40-50 bucks!! For a fillet mignon, it was quite chewy.  One of my friend's medium rare was cooked pretty rare!  Gosh, for being a supposedly 'reputable' steakhouse, can anything more go wrong?!  To top it off, the sides were extremely pricey, and did I mention dinky?!  Baked potato for $8!  Mac & cheese was the tiniest portion I've seen relative to many other places -- $8!! Mussels and shrimp were okay.\n\nLoud environment, over-crowded.  Theatrical like decor a la Cirque du Soleil. \n\nI think we were one of the last ones to leave the restaurant! I'm definitely not recommending this place to any of my friends!

Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the food, the bone in filet mignon was cook to perfection, and same goes for my girlfriend's bone-in new york steak. This was a very special night for the 2 of us because we're celebrating our 2 year anniversary, so we decided to give this place a try. Parking was surprisingly not too bad, we found street parking on the same block. They do offer valet if you chose to do so. \n\nAnyways back to why this place does not deserve a higher rating, so we were seated to our table, our server comes up to our table to greet us, asked if this was our first visit, we replied yes. he chuckled and walked away. We felt a unwelcome vibe from him because it felt like he thought that this was the very first time we've dined out at a steakhouse and that the tip probably wouldn't be that great, so he didn't even bother to tell us about the specials or what he would recommend. This guy totally ruined the vibe for our dinner, but good thing I had good company and we made it an enjoyable experience. \n\nThe complimentary bread was awesome , I may consider going back , praying that I don't get that same waiter.... treating your guest like that will likely not get you a nice tip.", "author": "Jeff C."}

Prior to tonight I've dined here twice. Service and food was commendable. Unfortunately, on this occasion service and food had deteriorated. Our empty appetizer plates remained on the table 20 minutes after consumption. My empty martini shaker remained on the table the entire meal. I refilled my own water x3 and martini x2. At the end of our entree, which we sent back due to being under cooked, our server (Tao) attempted to refill my glass with the melted ice water from the empty shaker.  When we mentioned that our medium rare filet's were under cooked (meat was black/blue) our server was very defensive and gave me a short lecture on steak!  It shouldn't come as a shock that our empty entree plates were never cleared either.\n\nNeedless to say we felt inclined to voice our observations to restaurant management. The manager was apologetic and offered to comp our cocktail. However, the manager failed to return with our change!  \n\nBy the way, this was our anniversary dinner. What a bummer.\n\nThe twice baked potato, Chard and vodka Gibson up were delicious.", "author": "Alfonse P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-06-16", "description": "I had been to Bobo's once before with my friends and wasn't a big fan, but I decided to give it another shot along with my wife (her first time) due to all the good reviews.\n\nOne word to summarize: mediocre.\n\nWe waited about 15 minutes at the entrance of the restaurant for our table and were then led up a confusing set of stairs to a low-ceilinged, jam packed 3rd floor of the restaurant.  There were about 5 two-seater tables that were available, so I'm not sure why we waited, and I'm also not sure why they decided to seat us in the small dark \"alcove\" of that room when there were so many other available tables that were getting some nice sunlight from outside.  Our table was extremely close to another table which basically made us feel like we were sitting at a 4-top rather than having the intimate dinner we were looking for.  I noticed all of the other tables were like this, so if you are looking for a private, intimate dinner, then this is not your place.  It was IMPOSSIBLE not to overhear our neighbors' conversation (and vice versa) so we inevitably ended up talking to the couple next to us.  Luckily they were cool people so we had a good conversation with them.  That was probably the best part of the experience to be honest.  \n\nBobo's decor is old.  Not in the classic, ageless way.  But rather in the dusty, \"this place is about to fall apart\" way.  At one point I had to go to the bathroom and it required that I walk down a set of stairs, through another dining room, and past a set of curtains.  Nothing was clearly marked and it made me feel like I was trying to find the Wizard of Oz.\n\nOur waitress was polite and relatively attentive, but nothing extraordinary.  When ordering our steaks, she walked away without asking for our preference on how the steaks are cooked.  I understand if the restaurant/chef has a standard method of cooking steaks, but they should verbally state \"we cook our steaks medium-rare, is that okay with you?\".  As it turns out, this is indeed the way they operate.  Both of us prefer medium-rare anyways, so this was a non-issue, but it did make us wonder and worry about how they would actually cook our steaks, so we had to follow up with the waitress to ask and find out.\n\nNow for the worst part.  The food. And the associated cost.\n\nI ordered a dry aged, bone-in NY strip and my wife ordered the filet mignon/crab leg combo.  The steaks were mediocre.  That is all I can say.  They were cooked okay, but my main complaint would be flavor.  There was none.  The grass fed steaks that my wife and I cook at home are better than what I had there.  At least some basic seasoning (salt/pepper) should be applied.  The absolute worst part was the seafood.  Someone else commented on Yelp that their seafood was poor, and I can definitely attest to that.  The crab legs were.... fishy.  Straight up.  They were dry and fishy.  \n\nAfter an extremely sub-par meal, our tab came to the table for more than $200 for my wife and I.  We have decided never to return.  If you are thinking of going to Bobo's, I would recommend taking a look at Alexander's, Ruth's Chris, or you can try picking up a nice steak from Brian's in Presidio Heights or from Fatted Calf and cook it at home.", "author": "D.

We made reservations, although it didn't seem like we needed them because there were a bunch of open tables at 7:15, but maybe they were reserved for later times, too. Cute place, but a little dim. I sat by the window so I had plenty of light, but my mom kept complaining there wasn't enough lighting, especially with the iron skillets casting a shadow on the table. Then she tried to bring the candle over, but it was a fake candle so it didn't do much. Haha!\n\nWe started with the Yellowtail Carpaccio. Yum! Lots of flavor, and cut very thinly. We all had a hard time biting through the bread they serve. The edges were REALLY hard. I ordered the Petite Filet Mignon, which I LOVED. They also had the Bone-in available, but I don't like bones. I hear it's amazing, though. I ordered it medium, and from my experience, medium was a little more pink than what I got, but was delicious nonetheless. My parents ordered the Combo of crab, shrimp, and mussels, and also another order of mussels and shrimp. They seemed to enjoy it, and really liked the dipping sauces. I also got the Twice Baked Potato. Very flavorful, perfect texture (not dry), and a pretty big potato! I couldn't finish it. The only thing I didn't like is that you have to order vegetables from the side orders. Everything comes a la carte, but I usually expect it to come with some potatoes, and a little side of veggies. \n\nOh! They also have this AWESOME after dinner napkin presentation. I call it a presentation because I asked our waitress to do it again. It's basically a little compressed napkin the size of a huge mint, and they pour water over it and it grows into a folded up wet nap! Pretty coooool.\n\nService was excellent. Our waitress was great. Overall, we all enjoyed our meals, and I'd definitely be back!", "author": "Jaime H."}

Yes...............FREE!!!!!  \n\nFrom the moment we stepped out of the car, into the restaurant, ate, paid, and came back to the car, it was 40 minutes.  I'm pretty sure the engine was still warm when we got back.\n\nSo............onto the meal.  Started out with a cocktail.  My new drink of choice is now whiskey, and Bulliet is it's name.   A very smooth whiskey might I add.  Started out with their house salad.  As I get older, I seem to gravitate more towards rabbit food.  I hate it when girls say I don't eat rabbit food.  Girl.............look at yourself.  Throw in a salad once in a while and you won't look like that.  haahahahhaa.  Ok.........back to the food.\n\nI ordered the bone in new york.  Mine was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Seared evenly on both sides and seasoned perfectly.  The quality of the meat is probably one of the best in the City.  I believe Omaha still have the best steaks but we aren't in Omaha right?  Kevin ordered the bone in filet.  His came out more on the rare side.  Had some of his meat as well (I'm talking about the steak) and it was very tender.  I like my steak with a little bit of texture, so believe it or not, I don't like filets that much.

The filet on the bone is amazing. Service was great and personally I dug the unique decor. \n\nWe ordered the lobster crustini which was really good and the baby romain salad with panchetta and bleu cheese dressing. The salad was simple and good. We also got the mac and cheese and onion rings for sides. As far as everything besides the steak, it was good, pretty good even but not on par with the how good the steak is. So  I was told the garlic bread they provide is amazing. It was really good but not sure about amazing. To sum up the food, the fliet on the bone amazing. Everything else was good and very typical steak house fare but not blow me away type of food.\n\nOne thing I have to say about this place is they make a solid cocktail.

Once the hostess finally came over she informed me that our table wasn't ready and it would be a few minutes. 10 minutes later we were finally seated. \n\nWe started off with cocktails, I ordered the Q-Ball (hangar one citron, fresh cucumber with lemon & mint) $12. This drink tasted more like cucumber, 7up and tonic water with a TON of ice mixed in. Overpriced (nasty) beverages generally put me in a bad mood, put I put my reservations aside and was ready to devour some steak! \n\nHere's the rundown of of our order: \n\n- Bone-in New York\n- Surf & Turf (half crab & petit fillet mignon) \n- Swiss chard with garlic & olive oil\n- Mac & Cheese \n- Twice-baked potato\n\nMy NY steak was completely overcooked and tough to chew (I ordered it Medium). The Crab with the Surf and Turf had absolutely no flavor, it was as if they boiled it with no seasoning and thew it on the plate. +1 star because my husband REALLY enjoyed the Petit Filet - he described it as one of the best he's ever had.

We left a 25 percent tip. \n\nHowever, like a dumbass, I left my computer bag there. I call the next day to see if they have it. They claim they do not. I call again later - specifically asking if someone has found a computer bag - they again say that no one knows of any bag that has been turned in. I find this odd.\n\nI call to make a police report, assuming that a fellow patron made off with it. They ask if the restaurant has video surveillance. If they do, an officer will meet me there to review the surveillance with them.\n\nI call Bobo's today and ask them when a good time would be to stop by and review the security footage. The hostess immediately gets a manager (the guy who served us our drinks that night no less) who tells me they have the bag. He claims that the hostess from the previous day asked if a computer had been turned in. She didn't ask about a bag, despite being told it was a brown messenger bag with a computer in it. Again, very odd. \n\nWhat's more, my business card was clearly visible in the clear plastic holder in the front of the bag. Apparently, no one looked in the bag to determine the owner or bothered to look for this card, which had all of my contact information on it. This, despite my having called in twice to ask about a computer bag and also having left my number. \n\nPretty shady IMHO. Perhaps I'm being too cynical?

The bone in filets were fantastic and I split the new york strip with my Mom which was done perfectly (as we like it very rare and the chef did listen to this and prepare it as asked).  We also did the lobster and crab cristinis which were fabulous, I loved the lobster one best.  We did the lobster soup, also.  Upon the first glance on the menu, the lobster soup includes curry, which can turn some people off, but it really is some great flavors that meld together quite nicely.\n\nThe sides we chose were the mushrooms and mod mac.  Both were very yummy.  The steaks were all great.  \n\nThe complaints I had were the hostesses.  We came in and I had planned a dinner reservation months and months ahead of time and told them it was my Mom's birthday and would love a nice table.  They took us upstairs and to this back little dungeon room, which is the room they have the large table in and the bathrooms and put the 4 of us in a little cramped table right next to the bathroom.  I went back downstairs and asked if we could get a different table and they looked annoyed and gave me a bit of attitude... like \"that table is perfectly good\"... and that is fine if they think that but it was a customer preference and I shouldn't have had to give a reason (in my opinion).  They took us to another table in the front room upstairs which was gorgeous and bright and by the window.  I noted that they tried to place 3 other groups in the table they tried to put us and only one stayed at that table... I think they may just put people there and hope no one complains.  I loved our new table though.  our waiter was nice... not overly great service but not bad by any means.\n\nThe food was great, the atmosphere was very nice, the wine list was great... I just think the service could have been a bit better or people could have given a smile and attempted to give a feeling of the customer being wanted at the restaurant.\n\nI will go back for dinner again, but I hope service improves... :)", "author": "Lyndsey C."}

I ordered their new york cut which was cooked to perfection - seared nicely to give that nice hint of smoky flavor and at the same time having the tenderness of a beautiful medium rare. Probably up there with the most well made steaks in the Bay Area.\n\nTheir roasted muscles were delicious as well. Coming sizzling to the table and cooked very well. They were nice little morsels of tenderness. Also highly recommended.\n\nI can't say the same about their crab. I'd go so far to say that I've had better crab at a value Chinese buffet. Granted, we didn't go during crab season which may have played a role... but I thought it was unacceptable how dry the crab was. Better left unserved in my opinion. \n\nI was also kind of turned off by the service. I remember asking one of the servers what kind of muscles they served us (because I liked them so much) and I was never given an answer. He said he would check with the chef but he never came back to tell us. Second, the drink cocktail they served me was very haphazardly made. It was supposed to have a rim of black salt on it, but when it came back there was hardly any salt on the rim and most of it was on the side of the glass. I actually had to have the waitress confirm because I started to believe it could've been steak grease. The drink itself was good, but I think you should get what you pay for. If I wanted a crappily made drink, I could've done that myself!\n\nIn any case, I might be back for the steak and muscles but I'd probably avoid anything else. Hopefully the next time I visit, the service will be better.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

I love myself a good steak, and my date enjoys crab so after some quick research I thought \"why not?\" \n\nI pulled up to free valet service which was a major load of my shoulders given how bad parking is in SF. We were quickly greeted and seated for our reservation.  The venue is quite nice and has a very intimate feel. The tables were rather small though and space was limited. Our waiter was prompt, knowledgeable, and when given the opportunity to choose a drink for me, he did not fail to amaze. Now on to the food.\n\nMy complaint is in line with many of the other complaints about this place. The steak says they are cooked \"medium-rare\" ....(I even requested medium-rare)....but the steak came medium-well to well done. I ordered the porterhouse and though I was happy with the portion size, the steak was not cooked correctly. It was dry and tough. Even my date asked \"how did you order this?\" Not impressed especially at $60+\n\nNow the crab, that was amazing. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. I wasnt able to hold much of a convo with my date because she was busy enjoying every bit of her half crab. Im not a big seafood fan but even I got in on the action. Succulent and flavorful. Oh and the bread everyone keeps mentioning....yea...its pretty darn good. A bit messy, but definitely worth it. Almost spoiled my appetite by eating so much of it. \n\nI spoke with the manager at the end of the night and gave him a heads up to my experience being in line with the negative Yelp reviews. He suggested I should have sent it back and was willing to make it up to me. I had to get back home so I unfortunately turned down the offer but it was nice to see him take responsibility and not make excuses like some managers at other restaurants.\n\nOverall, free valet parking, great drinks, superb service, succulent crab, and an intimate atmosphere make this a great date or weekend drink spot. I DO recommend this to people looking for a nice atmosphere, great drinks, and some tasty crab.", "author": "Derek F."}

And I've made some great steaks myself.  \n\nBut.\n\nThe ambiance and the service, coupled with the quality of the food and preparation,  made my dining experience at Bobos the best meal I've ever had.\n\nI can't explain to you how they take a 28 day dry aged cut of bone in filet mignon and cook it so perfectly a hard glance could cut it.  I also can't explain to you how the perfectly grilled steaks start attacking your olfactory senses a block away.  And I can't explain to you how the magical process of dry aging beef creates a new zenith of flavor constructs that puts anything else you've put in your mouth to shame.  \n\nAll I can tell you is if you've got the scratch, and are in San Fransisco (and eat meat), you must go to this place and see why this is the best country EVER.  \n\nEven if you don't eat meat...go.  Now.  \n\nps-don't mind reviews of people who've had bad experiences.  I've managed a restaurant for 2 years, and the bottom line is, this stuff happens.  Also, you'll note most bad experiences come from bad service or the seafood.  seafood is a cruel mistress restaurant wise.  \n\nthey deserve their bad experience if they aren't getting steak.  if you want seafood, go to mccormick and schmicks for god's sake.

I did a quick search for steakhouses in SF not the norm RC or HOPR.  Wah-la Bobos!  I've been by this place before but I've never heard of it so thought nothing more of it.  \nAnywho, when we arrived, the place was quite small to my surprise but nice and cozy.  Circus/clown theme.  Duh.  Boboquivari's - look it up for you reviewers who were caught off guard with the decor.  Anywho, we were seated upstairs.  The menu had striking resemblances to The Dead Fish menu and as you have it, the waitress confirms that the chef who designed The Dead Fish menu also designed Bobo's menu.  Turns out this place is sister restaurants with The Dead Fish in Crockett, CA.  Now that was music to my ears.\n\nI ordered the bone-in filet mignon. My goodness!  It was the juiciest piece of filet mignon I've ever had.  Minor exception is my \"medium\" came out more \"medium rare\" but still I devoured it.  He ordered the combintation petite filet mignon and half crab.  His steak was not the bone in so it was relatively dry and petite it was.  I felt awkward my piece of meat was bigger than his.  The server actually swapped plates on accident.  We giggiled about it after.  Moving on, the crab was fresh and so sweet.  Cooked to perfection.  The dipping butter could have more seasoned though.

Bone-in filet all the way. A real carnivore knows the value in dry aging steak and Bobo's does it right.\n\nAnd for those of you complaining that your steak was over-cooked...stop ordering prime cuts of meat medium, medium-well or well done because \"I don't like it bloody\"! If the meat is questionable and it's on your buddy's grill, then go ahead and turn it into charcoal if you want. But when you have a bone-in filet at Bobo's, medium-rare is as far as you should go.

Because of the special occasion, we fudged a bit on doctor's orders and came out here despite my wife being ordered on bedrest.  Don't worry, we  used the free (yes, free) valet.\n\nI was ready for a fight when I got here based on the reviews indicating a rude hostess and even more ready for a fight when we arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation.  When we got in, we were given no flack or attitude and shown directly to our table by one of the 3 hosts/hostesses.  No fight needed, and I did feel a bit embarrassed taking off my Ultimate Fighting gloves as we walked up the stairs.  Kidding (about the gloves, not the host).\n\nBecause I told them it was our anniversary and requested a booth on OpenTable, we were given a little nook with a secluded table for two upstairs.  Very nice.\n\nWe ordered the crab cakes and mussels as starters, each got the bone-in filet (petit for my wife), twice baked, and brussel sprouts.\n\nThe highlight of the meal, after the steaks, were the brussel sprouts.  Most people shy away from these mini-cabbages because they've never had them cooked right.  Bobo's does it right.  I'm not a filet guy because there's less flavor in more tender cuts (hence the tendency for restaurants to offer a sauce with filet), and have long since conceded to that being my wife's preference.  However, I had to order it here because of the reviews, and I was not disappointed.  We both ordered them medium and they came out juicy, tender, pink, and no blood.  Perfect.  The potato was not as bland as people claim; it was good not great.\n\nThe mussels were very good although the sizzling hot butter did splash onto my wife's eyelid at one point.  Be careful.  Burn potential aside, they were great but I don't know if I'd order them again.  Then again, I might.\n\nWe both got a dessert:  the chocolate bomb and the cheesecake.  Not impressed and won't be getting dessert here again.

Since we both haven't been here before but are fans of the sister restaurants, I thought why not check it out.  I hadn't done much research about what this place was known for before hand so we were both going into this unprepared.  \n\nWe got there a little early so we sat at the bar and chopped it up with the bartender, Michele.  He was very friendly and asked if we had been there before.  We told him no and he immediately mentioned that this place is known for their bone in fillet.  He said that it's so popular that it sometimes is unavailable.  OK, if hearing something like that doesn't intrigue you then I don't know what does.  After only waiting about 15 minutes, we were seated at a very nice \"romantic\" table.  By this time we had pretty much made up our minds on what we were going to order.  We ordered the muscles (we order this at all of the sister restaurants so we knew this was gonna be good), bone in fillet, brussels sprouts w/ pancetta (sounded interesting but my husband likes brussels sprouts and the waitress recommended it) and Mac and Cheese.  \n\nWhen the food came, the meat looked great.  But because it was my husband's birthday, he had the first bite.  I could have sworn his eyes teared up (LOL).  The bone in fillet was absolutely delicious!  The meat was so soft, it was like butter!  You didn't need any additional steak sauce, the au jus was just fine.  Our sides were also delicious... the brussel sprouts were a nice surprise.  I guess anything with pancetta is gonna be delicious!  Mac and cheese was yummy because there was a hint of bleu cheese flavor that gave it just the right amount of tart-ness.  \n\nAll in all, this was a wonderful meal.  My husband was definitely pleased which made me extremely happy.  He couldn't stop talking about the meat.

Nice crispy exterior with tender goodness on the inside.  Pretty generous portion -- 10 oz Steak (12 oz including the bone).  The only side we ordered was the mushrooms.  Mushrooms are a pretty simple side, but they somehow made it taste amazing.  I would definitely recommend the bone-in filet and the mushrooms.\n\nAs for appetizers, the mussels we got were pretty good too.  They gave a very generous portion.  I would pass on the lobster soup, however.  It is not a typical bisque you would expect.  It just tastes like curry with lobster chunks.  \n\nDefinitely would come back.  Service was excellent.  The bar side is nice for a casual dinner and the dining room is nice for a more romantic setting.", "author": "Bert N."}

My crab was mediocre, I've had a lot of crab in my life and this wasn't memorable at all, it tasted pretty bland in my opinion.\n\nThe service was attentive, but our server didn't really come off as nice at all.

I ordered a medium rare bone in filet, roughly $40.  I was excited as my friend had been raving about this place's bone-in filet.\n\nThe food took quite a long time to come out, but perhaps it was just a busy day.  In either case, when i got my steak, it was well done - not even a smudge of pink in the center.  If this was a Denny's, i suppose i would have just kept on eating, but for $40 - i want to actually enjoy my steak so i sent it back.\n\n10 minutes later, they brought out a new steak.  I cut into it and tasted a piece.  To my unpleasant surprise, it was ice cold.  I had the urge to spit it out, but that would have been unpleasant for everyone else around me, so i swallowed it.  A horrible mistake.\n\nAnyway, i sent that piece back again, still hoping they could get it right this time.  The third time, they used the same piece of steak i cut into.  The plate felt hot... perhaps they just placed it in the oven.  I hope so... i hope it wasn't some microwave.\n\nThe steak sucked.  It came back in two pieces, well done on the outside, and barely pink in the center, but it was edible, and i was hungry.\n  \nThe check came out and i saw that they removed my steak from the bill.  I was almost mollified, though thought to myself - i would rather have paid twice as much for something i actually enjoy.  Well, it turned out they charged me for 2 steaks, and the removal was just only for the 2nd charge...  So i did end up paying for dinner.  \n\nAnd continued paying the next couple of days for that piece of cold hell that i swallowed.\n\nMaybe they don't always suck, but from my experience - they're not worth the one star I'm giving them now.

We asked the waitress why a filet is about one inch thick and her explanation of butterflying the meat was to cook it evenly(new one on me).  My wife and I split the Frank Sinatra cut which was ordered medium rare and arrived raw and pretty thin for a supposed 64 ounce cut of meat(I guess the bone was heavy).  After both dishes sent back the Filet arrived cooked in different areas from raw to medium well with no flavor and tough.  The Sinatra cut was cooked medium rare but was chewy with no taste.  When a server saw a lot of left over meat, and already aware of our problem he asked if we wanted to see the manager.

While I can't remember \"going to a steakhouse\" before, I'm sure a better experience awaits elsewhere in the future. This would have been a three star review, but for the price, an \"A-OK\" for the three stars it's not. \n\nThe ambiance is dark and intimate, and space is pretty tight, and while the service was good - relaxed but quite attentive - the problem for us and those in the small dining room was our next - over table. One of these four losers was just flat out drunk; whiny, loud and nearly belligerent. Not cool, for his party or anyone else. Thanks a lot.\n\nI hadn't been drinking myself, so I went ahead and ordered a cocktail - the Dream - a vodka Martini sweetened with amaretto. Different, and very enjoyable.\n\nThe food - The Cesar salad was shredded, and while reasonably good, looked too \"out of the bag\" at that chopped up size. Perhaps rather than confetti size, the appearance could be better with actual leaves of romaine? The heirloom tomato appetizer was good - tomatoes were flavorful and brought with soft cheese.\n\nThe dinner consisted of two NY bone-in steaks and one order of crab, while tasty, was fine, not bad, but nothing particularly amazing in my opinion either. Moreover my steak arrived almost cold to the touch from the kitchen. Medium rare or not, I got the impression it sat in the kitchen window and had come off some steak assembly line. The sides, ordered \u00c0 la carte, were quite good however - especially the Swiss chard which was hot, garlicy and a great side to the steak.\n\nThe deserts were actually super - no faint praise here. The blood orange sorbet in a waffle shell was the perfect light palate cleansing desert, and the chocolate mousse dunce cones with spicy chocolate sauce were a surprise hit.

But downstairs was the bar and upstairs is where the dining is. It's actually small from what I remember but there's different rooms.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-06-10", "description": "Excellent food, TERRIBLE SERVICE. \n\nFor the prices you pay at this restaurant, I expect grade A 5 star service. First off, when we arrived at the restaurant for our 9pm reservation on a Friday night for 10 people, we waited an additional 30 minutes to be seated. A large party that was about the same size came in AFTER us and were seated before us, with no apology or explanation. There is not much of a waiting area or a bar area, so you're stuck feeling completely in the way as people are trying to get through and walk around the dining area. \n\nIt took us about 20 minutes to get our drink order in (several bottles of pricey and \"meh\"  wine) and another 30 minutes to get our steak orders in. The menu is not enormous, it doesn't take that long to figure out what cut you want and how you want it cooked. You also have to order a la carte for sides for the table. That is expected at a nice steak restaurant. Our food arrived about 20 minutes later. Most of the steaks on the table were cooked perfectly medium rare. Mine was not, it was about Medium Well to Well in some places (I ordered medium rare of course). I was fine with eating it as is, but my friend the birthday boy INSISTED that we send it back. So he flagged the server down, and we sent it back. Minutes later the server comes back and they had cut through the middle of the petit filet and said it was \"medium rare in the middle.\" So naturally I didn't want to make much of an additional scene, so I took the steak back (now cold with a bit cut through the middle) and I just didn't eat it. I had some of my friends' steaks that were cooked wonderfully. About a minute later, my friend spills his wine all over my steak and my dress. The bus boy comes around and I ask him to take the steak I didn't eat. They didn't take the steak off the bill, I paid $50 for a steak I didn't eat. Major sad face. However it was my friend's birthday and I didn't want to make a fuss. \n\nAs I have been told before, don't complain until the check comes. Since we had a large party, there was auto gratuity, so I couldn't take the money off there for the service. However I did try to leave a note that our server was great, but how the steak temperature situation was handled was very poor. I made sure to put the slip in the middle of the stack of all the other slips at the table, since we had multiple credit cards that they accommodated. In poor form, the server comes back to pick up the finished checks while we were still sitting there. And as we're getting up to leave, he comes back and says he has \"lost\" my signed slip with the note. Therefore he demands my copy. I should have refused and said it was my copy. Feeling defeated, I gave him my copy, and he stood there and made sure I didn't write anything horrible on it I guess. \n\nWhile the steak if cooked to the right temperature is tasty and well seasoned, I wouldn't patron this place again due to the lack of professionalism. When I pay ~$100 for dinner, I expect the service to be exceptional. Go to 5A5 instead, their food is amazing, as is the service.", "author": "Matty T."}

We got the porterhouse and the crab. While the porterhouse was tender and cooked properly (med rare), it absolutely lacked in flavor. I'm one to enjoy a good steak with just salt and pepper but this had none of that good beef flavor. The crab was no better. Maybe their crab is better when it's in season locally, but the waiter assured us that it comes from \"way up north where it's now in season.\" As skeptical as we were we gave it a shot, since they're known for crab, but we should have trusted our instincts. Was flavorless and just didn't taste fresh. On top of that, service was sub par.\n\nThe sides (twice baked potato and brussels sprouts) were good, but like everything here, over-priced.

However, I had an exceptional experience at Bobo's, and feel like I must share it.\n\nMy friends and I went here for our Fantasy Football league banquet-yes like all other athletes, we must have an end of the season award banquet. Let me preface the rest of this story by saying that we are a rowdy bunch. 10 men, and 2 girls. We're young and loud, and don't fit the \"old, sophisticated, mature money\" mold. And they treated us amazingly anyways.\n\nThere was a short wait before we got in, so a few of us grabbed some drinks before going in. I guess the manager or owner is a Detroit Red Wings fan, and he was jokingly giving my buddy a tough time for being a San Jose Sharks fan (should maybe minus a star for not being a Sharks fan...haha jk). Super friendly guy, checked up on us a bunch of times to see that we were doing well over the course of the night.\n\nAfter we ordered, we got our bread and the wine we ordered shortly. I did say that we were loud and rowdy right? Well, if you put a bit of alcohol into young, rowdy, immature young men, language becomes more and more colorful, and stories become less and less appropriate. Unfortunately for our neighbors (or maybe fortunately cuz our stories are funny), they did not tell us off. Instead, once our neighbors finished, they didn't seat other folks upstairs with us. Honestly, that blew my mind. I half expected us to get kicked out of the restaurant for our poor behavior. Instead, they treated us in a way we didn't deserve to be treated-extremely well. This blows my mind the more I think about it. \n\nIt took a while for us to get our steaks, but I suppose that is to be expected when there are 12 of us. One of my buddies said that his medium steak was not cooked long enough, so they took it back and fixed it for him. Everyone else had a great experience with the steak. My buddies all loved the sides as well.\n\nI forgot our servers name, but he was a nice young Asian gentleman who treated us awesomely.

The place is kinda small and so, everything felt somewhat cramped and when you walk from one location to another, you have to kinda walk gingerly to make sure you don't knock down anything or hit someone. The toilet is located on the furthest edge of the top floor and you have to traverse the maze upstairs or should I say that you have to pass other tables within 1 to 1.5 foot clearance between tables.\n\nValet parking: we used the valet parking service and he was pretty prompt in taking and returning our car.

The hostess barely batted an eye at my outfit and seated us in a very nice little private alcove for two, despite us not having a reservation.

We also ordered the lobster crostini for the appetizer, chard and mac n cheese for the sides.\n\nLobster crostini was amaaazing.

The lobster was very flavorful and I ate every single little piece.\n\nI'd also like to mention here that I got a glass of the Rose, and it was HUGE. I actually had trouble finishing it. Good value on the wine glasses here!\n\nAnd for the main attraction, the bone-in filet! It says on the menu \"Our steaks are served medium rare for maximum flavor\", and I had no arguments with that. The filet was buttery and delicious as filets should be, and it was especially flavorful in the area right next to the bone. Also, it was nice and BIG! It came very lightly sauced, but the sauce did not interfere with the natural flavor at all, and was merely a subtle compliment.\n\nYou know the steak is beastly good when you have to keep reminding yourself to cut smaller bites so you don't freaking choke on the thing.\n\nFor dessert we had the pistachio panna cotta, which was light, creamy, and refreshing, a perfect way to end a fabulous meal!

If I were judging the wait staff, I'd probably give them one or two stars.\nThat being said...The Filet Mignon is so insanely good!  It seems they've changed the way they prepare the steaks.  They used to be seared and roasted with garlic and rosemary, but now it seems they're seared and roasted with salt and butter.  I'd definitely prefer the old recipe over the new, but either way, the steaks are amazing.  For the average person, no other steak you've eaten in your lifetime will compare to this.  Assuming most people have chosen to go to the roadhouse or outback for a steak.\nWe always order the crab cakes and lobster soup for our appetizers.  The crab cakes we absolutely cannot get enough of.  I could probably eat those for days on end and never get tired of them.  The lobster soup also is amazing, IF you like curry.  It just so happens that I love curry.  You can't go wrong with those two appetizers!\nBack to the steaks.  I've done the bone-in filet and a regular filet.  My recommendation is the bone-in filet mignon, medium rare.  In my opinion, the more you cook the steak, the less flavor it has.  Fortunately Bobo's uses quality aged beef.  I believe it's aged six weeks.  So if you can't bring yourself to order it medium rare, don't go any further than medium.  Trust me!  \nI realize there are a couple other steakhouses in SF that have better reviews, but this is the first one I've been to, and it's hard for me to try a new spot when I know this one is always on point.

Perfect for a date night or just a nice quiet and classy dinner with the family (with older kids - our daughter is 14) or with friends or a low key and impressive business dinner.\n\nFor starters we ordered the yellowtail carpaccio, the heirloom toy box tomatoes and a Caesar salad.  The carpaccio was to die for especially when you soaked the garlic bread in the sauce! The heirloom tomato salad was also delicious.  The Caesar salad? Not so good; it was rather bland.  However, if you combined all three dishes, the carpaccio and the tomatoes added zest to the Caesar salad.\n\nOur waiter suggested the bone-in filet mignon. I personally didn't want to try something other yelpers raved about! I ordered the roasted crab.  It was interesting as I am more accustomed to steamed crab.  The texture was drier yet had a nice grilled and smoky flavor to the meat.  I think some warm drawn butter could have been added to the presentation.  Otherwise it was good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-12-15", "description": "Went to Bobo's for the first time for my boyfriend's birthday on Friday night.  We were in a group of 5 and had made the reservation about 2 weeks ago for 8:30pm.  We arrived to the restaurant in our complete group around 8:20 and were told there was a slight overlap in service and we would have to wait an extra 10 minutes to be seated (the website does advise that reservations may not be kept on time due to dining room traffic, so that was understandable).  The hostess sent us to \"The Lounge\", which is their bar a couple doors down, and said she'd text us when the table was ready.\n\nAfter fighting through the narrow walkway crowded with middle-aged drunk people, we get to the bar.  It must have been the bartender's first day EVER - he had no fucking clue what was going on, never acknowledged any of us standing there waiting to order, had no idea what a Tom Collins was when my friend ordered it and had to go next door and ask for help multiple times with using the register.  Needless to say, after waiting 10 mins for him to get my order (I even tried just waiving and talking at him) and feeling completely ignored, the rest of us gave up on ordering drinks and waited to be texted that our table was ready.\n\nFinally, at 8:50, we were seated.  Granted, the restaurant was very busy, but 3 of the 5 of us at have worked in food service long enough to know that it was just very disorganized service and took much longer than it should have for everything.  We were thrilled that the corkage fee was only $15 and brought a bottle of champagne with us, which was great because that was the only beverage any of us had for the first 20 minutes we sat there.\n\nEventually our server came over and apologized and brought water for everyone and took our orders.  Maybe they were short on staff, but one server for a room with 4 large parties (there was a group of about 8 people sitting across from us) is a little ridiculous.  And the poor guy was so clearly overwhelmed, constantly being grabbed by each table to get something else.  I don't remember if he had written our order or not, but he definitely came back about 5 mins later and asked one of my friends how they wanted their steak cooked again, though she definitely had told him.  Garlic bread was brought out shortly after we ordered and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  The wait time for food was acceptable, about 20-30 mins, and everything was served at once,  which was great.  The food was definitely phenomenal.  I had the bone-in filet mignon, which was perfectly cooked medium rare as I had asked.  Everyone's steaks were actually cooked perfectly medium rare, even my boyfriend's giant Porterhouse, which had been ordered a medium well.  He still ate it and said it was delicious, but at a top-shelf steakhouse, you would expect them to know how to cook a steak to order!  We ordered the brussel sprouts, cauliflower, mashed sweet yams and mac-n-cheese as sides.  All amazing and great to share with the table.  After finishing, our plates were immediately cleared by a busser, but it took another 20 mins to flag down our server and get the check.\n\nOverall it was an incredibly delicious meal and we had a great time, but I doubt I'll return to that restaurant for the simple fact that I'd rather pay for good food that comes with equally good service, and not feel like I was a less important diner than any other party there.  And really, if you're going to spend $70 on a steak at a top rated steakhouse, you'd expect it to be cooked right.", "author": "Katie S."}

Steak came out well done and crispy. We had asked for medium rare. Crab isn't pre cracked... Most steakhouses have already cut the crab for you. Twice baked potato was ok.

So disappointed, I ordered the New York strip as they did not have any rib eye ( my favorite cut ). It was extremely bland. Had no flavor what so ever. I tasted Nooo seasoning not even salt or pepper! And it was pretty tough too. Now I'm a huge steak eater and I've been to many steak houses and had many different cuts of steak.

The atmosphere is very interesting, the room being mainly red and dim with images of jesters and whatnot, basically reminding me of the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland.  It's probably best to make a reservation, although a friend and I did manage to get seats at the bar right away without a reservation.  Get seats towards the front side of the restaurant where there are windows.  The ones in the back are rather stuffy and too dim, I didn't like it at all.  \n\nAnyway, I've tried several different plates at Bobo's.  I have tried a steak from here once, but considering it was a while back, I don't want to give an inaccurate description of it so I won't critique it in this review.  \nHowever, in all honesty, the Iron-skillet Roasted entrees are really what you should be coming here for, despite the rave about the steaks.  (I base this off the fact that the steak doesn't seem to be particularly memorable.)  I've ordered the combination orders of Mussels & Shrimp, and also Mussels & Crab; point is, get the mussels, it's amazing; shrimp and crab are good as well.  It comes out sizzling on a huge skillet and the portion for the combination orders are perfect for two, maybe with a side.  They pour some sort of buttery, white wine (?) sauce right when it comes out and it is sizzling, drooling, delicious awesomeness.  \nTheir steak tartare (called Filet al Crudo) is a good choice for an appetizer, tasty as a steak tartare should be, sorry I don't know how else to explain it; if you like raw beef just get it.    \nI've also ordered a side of brussels sprouts with pancetta, which were a bit soggy for my tastes but not bad in flavor and of a decent portion; however, personally I think it's a bit overpriced for just brussels sprouts. \nLastly don't forget the best \"free\" bread you'll ever get ever.  They bake a fresh loaf of garlic bread to come with your order, with chunks of caramelized garlic on the crunchy top and a soft middle.  \nIt's a place with a creative atmosphere, good food, and decent service.

For my entree, I ordered the Filet Mignon and we shared asparagus and cauliflower as our sides since all the entrees are a la carte. I should of gone with my gut and asked for the steak medium-well, but I went with the recommendation on the menu and ordered it medium. It was a little bit too rare for me. I still ate it, but I know I would of enjoyed it even more had it been cooked a little bit longer. That's my fault though.

OMG. If you don't order this when they have it, then something is seriously wrong with you. I think this is the only steakhouse I've been to where they do serve the bone with their filet. The filet is about 13oz including the bone so it's a hefty size.

The waitress who took our order was nice and very helpful. BUT the servers who brought out our food were something else. They kept confusing who ordered what. Setting down crab in front of us when we didn't order crab, or asking who ordered the filet, who ordered the blahblahblah. This was REALLY annoying especially for such a fancy restaurant like Boboquivaris. They should damn well know who ordered what instead of making it such a messy havoc! Minus 1 star for that.\n\n(Photos uploaded)", "author": "Heidi C."}

Ended up just a mediocre experience since the chef couldn't seem to cook a steak medium-rare (even sent one back to let him try again). The wine list is quite good, but extremely overpriced. As much as 2.5x over retail. The cheesecake dessert was inedible. Will plan to try another steakhouse in the future.", "author": "Jacobus B."}

Jewel toned and lush, the first thing that impressed me was the fancy automatic double-swing front door. Enter this and the first thing to greet you is the bar. Don't ignore this sign. The bartender whipped up some well-crafted martinis (go for the basil). \n\nOnce we were seated in a small-ish room just to the right of the bar, we indulged in the Heirloom Toy Box tomato appetizer. Amazing...so simple but delicious. It was hard not to gorge myself on that salad and still save room for my entree. They give you this fresh-baked loaf of olive bread. I don't even like olives but this bread was beautiful. \n\nOrdered the waiter's recommendation...if you can even call it that. He basically told us we were disgraces if we didn't order the bone-in filet mignon. Normally, I don't even really like filet mignon but with this rousing recommendation, I had no choice. And I'm really glad I listened. \n\nThis steak..ordered medium rare, came on the lighter side of medium rare....almost fully rare. But I ate it anyway. So tasty and bloody. I fully embraced my inner carnivore and attempted to finish that big-ass filet. But my carb-loving self was fighting the good fight as well. The twice-baked potato was not even my side dish but i ate well over half of it. Baked yam was decent enough for me to clean the dish. Swiss chard was very garlicky and very good....Modern mac and cheese was great but nothing to write home about. \n\nFinished off the meal with the recommended Dunce Caps- very rich ...very nice, but I was already past the point of no return with my meal. \nCan't wait to go back!", "author": "Lauren G."}

The meal is all ala carte, so be prepared to spend $$$.  We chose wisely by sharing the bone-in filet along with a twice baked potato and super yummy portobello mushrooms, which added a lot of flavor to the meat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-14", "description": "I had high expectations for Bobo's. I can't say that I was blown away, but it was definitely very good. The meat is fantastic and it's true what they say- the steaks come out more rare than you order. If you order medium rare, be prepared for a VERY rare steak on your plate (probably still has a pulse). Knowing this ahead of time, I ordered a bone-in ribeye medium, and it came out just as I like it - medium rare. The steaks are served with an au-jus like sauce...I usually don't like gravy or sauce on my steak, I like the meat's natural flavor to speak for itself. But in this case, the au jus was very mild and only enhanced the flavor.\n\nWe started with a caesar salad (split) which was fresh and light with homemade croutons - definitely a big salad, perfect for sharing. We also ordered the lobster crostini with burrata. SO good. For entrees we each had the bone-in ribeye, and for sides we ordered twice-baked potato and mac n cheese. Twice-baked potato was delish - a little on the salty side but very tasty. The mac and cheese was disappointing- it tasted strongly of sharp bleu cheese, which was unexpected. Bleu cheese is for salads, not mac n cheese! We also ordered a couple cocktails - Qball and Blood Orange margarita. The qball was delicious! Needless to say, we were way too full for dessert.\n\nBobo's is great, but I'm not convinced it's the \"best steak in SF.\" Even though Ruth's Chris gets a bad rap because it's a chain establishment, I have to say that for the price, I prefer their steak, service, and ambience over Bobo's. \n\nAbove ALL else, if you come here, request a private booth or table that isn't bumping elbows with the table next to it. Some of the tables are literally 10 inches away from the table edge next to it, maybe less. We could hear the couple next to us CHEWING for chrissake.

We also ordered the heirloom salad with buratta, and a caesar salad to start. A complimentary half loaf of garlic bread was also served and was quite good, though I didn't munch on too much of that. All the appetizers were absolutely wonderful, with my favorite being the tomato salad.\n\nMy date ordered the surf&turf (a petit filet mignon and crab), and I ordered just the petit filet mignon. Our plan was to share the crab. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium, just as ordered. It was melt-in-your-mouth good. One of the juiciest steaks I've had in a while. The crab was also wonderful, and tasted great in the butter sauce it was served with.\n\nService was just fine, nothing special there.

Harris's for me, is the second best and Alfred's after Harris'.  Unfortunately, I have had below average steaks at Morton's and Ruth's Chris'.  Bob's and Epic as well as Morton's and Ruth's Chris' are too expensive and the steaks aren't as tasty as Bobo's.  Lark Creek Steakhouse is hit and miss, Izzy's steaks are just not that great overall.  I haven't been to Michael Mina's new digs at the St. Francis Hotel.  It's probably good, but I have kids to feed and a mortgage to pay!  I heard that 5A5 is good, but I haven't been.\n\nFood:  Dry aged- Great Bone-In Filet and Bone in NY- best I 've had.  They arrive at the table hot and very rare.  Order it medium if you like it medium rare.  The sides are delicious.  My personal favorites are the Brussel Sprouts and the Twice Baked Potato.  Mac and Cheese one of the best in the city and the Yellow Tail carpaccio is outstanding and the Lobster bisque has a curry flavor.  You can also get crab, and mussels- which some of my friends criticize, but I think are delicious dishes.\n\nService:  Fabulous, fantastic, super service.  The wait staff is friendly, yet not over the top, efficient, professional, and seem like they are genuinely NICE people. \n\nAtmosphere:  Circus like,with colorful walls and decor, which I admit, I had to get used to, but now I wouldn't want it any other way.  It's unique and a good idea to decorate in this manner because it is a small space.\n\nBar:  Small, but good things come in small packages.  Comfortable u shaped bar with cool lighting.  Very tasty homemade recipe martinis,   great wine list with some very reasonably priced, but delicious wines.  \n\nPrice/Value:  Bobo's is NOT as expensive as Harris', Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Bob's, or Epic.  Most steaks are $39.00 as compared to steaks that are priced in the $40-$50 range for the other steak houses.  Alfred's, Izzy's and Lark Creek are probably cheaper than Bobo's.

Just a side note, by the time I left the restaurant, only one table on our floor ordered a full bottle.  So those glasses just say there on the top shelves collecting dust.  Big minus.  I asked the waiter if they have a decanter and he said he will try to find one.  The dude, brought back a flower vase, poured my wine into the vase and literally shake rattle and roll my wine in the vase! I almost fainted at that moment.  BIG BIG minus.  Later when the waiter came back to pour me some more wine, I had to wave him off, fearing what other brutality he had up his sleeves.\n\nAs for the food, it was not bad.  The bread was very beautifully baked.  The dungeness crab crostin is not something you get everywhere which is good so I have something to remember this place by.  I ordered the boned in filet since it was the same price as the bone free filet.  My friend warned me about the steak at this place but what the heck, anyone can have an off night.  Cause my expectations were set so low, when my filet came out medium rare just as i asked, I was pleasantly surprised.  They add this peppery salty sauce on top.  The bone was rather forgettable cause it was like a small piece of shaved bone.  Later though when the party next to me order the boneless, I realize you get a much bigger cut with the bone in.  I also saw the petite filet, just an fyi, it's like an appetizer cut. \n\nBobo is located in the middle of a residential and restaurant area.

Mine was a bit overcooked (but the middle was still rare), but my mom's was SO GOOD...It was so good that she literally kept saying \"this is SO GOOD!\"  with every bite.  \n\nAnd as if I wasn't full already, the pretty server tempted us with the dessert menu.  \n-The Dunce Cap Cones: Little waffle cones atop sweet and light chocolate mousse.

I signed a contract stating that i had to pay $50 a head for every person that didn't show up. She confirmed our reservation for 18 people. I show up Saturday night with an entire party for my boyfriends 30th birthday party and i should have figured..... NO reservation. I was so embarrassed. I had 18 people standing around while they figured out a room to put us in. The manager only did this after i threw a fit. After waiting an hour they put us in a nice room and i was content. But i at least figured after making us wait an hour they would do something to make up for the inconvenience.. Nope we were charged corkage fee and all.

This restaurant along with the whole day surpasses any other birthday he's had so far. He tells me all the time.\n\nWe arrived at this restaurant at around 9:00pm. I made reservations here 2 weeks prior to coming. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess that led us to a dimly lit secluded corner of the restaurant that gave us privacy and a romantic setting. I had included in my reservation that this dinner was special because of my b.f.'s birthday and they apparently listened. \n\nI was somewhat doubtful since we were so secluded in the restaurant with even a curtain to give us even more privacy, if we were going to get good service. What if they just forgot about us back here? To my surprise the service was excellent! Our waiter was charming and treated us with the utmost respect and gave us a good recommendation to a very expensive though tasty bottle of red wine.\n\nWe ordered a well portioned fillet mignon and cracked crab. The crab was a little on the salty side but was cooked to perfection. I dipped it in some butter and lemon and it was heaven in my mouth! The fillet was melt in your mouth delicious! It was tender and juicy! Could not eat it slow enough! The wine made our meals taste even better!\n\nThe decor of Bobo's was eclectic and fun although had a somewhat mysterious feel to it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-16", "description": "Found this gem on Yelp while i was looking for places to eat that were close to Ghiradelli Square.  I'm becoming somewhat of a steak snob so I liked the idea of trying a cheeky place that isn't your run of the mill \"steakhouse\" but is still known for its steaks.\n\nFirst off, the restaurant is quite small.  It's not crammed, but if it was busier it might have been a little noisy and packed for my taste.  And yes, the other reviews are true - the decor is tacky.  But that's the point.  The name is derived from the Italian word for court jester, and it's run by the same guys as restaurants such as The Stinking Rose, so they're going to go with an Italian theme of course..\n\nSo our server Michelle was very pleasant and really helpful, telling us a little about the menu and whatnot.  So now on to the food:\n\nBone-in filet - Their specialty dish is, like many reviews state, A+++!  The dry-aged steak is cooked in an iron skillet with garlic and rosemary and its own juices, no marinades.  It taste absolutely delicious and the filet can be cut with your fork and melts in your mouth - Just like filet should be.  I guess the bone-in is slightly larger and more tender.  The juices are spectacular and it's such a tasty steak!\n\nPorterhouse - Essentially just a bone-in NY strip and a petite filet on the same plate.  Not really worth the extra price.  The strip was good, but not great.  I'd stick with the filet here since you can probably cook a strip just as good at home.\n\nWhipped yam with brown maple sugar - Just a scoop of whipped yam, but I'm a sucker for candied yams so I gave it a whirl.  Not worth $8 but it was good.  Not too sweat and slightly savory.  If this had marshmallows baked on top it would be better but hey this isn't my Thanksgiving table so what am I expecting??\n\nBermuda onion rings - Very sweet onions with a very nice, crispy outside.  Not greasy and the crust does not overpower the onion and vice versa.  I would get these again for sure.\n\nCaesar salad - Absolutely delicious caesar dressing!!  Just a few leaves of lettuce though - Not really worth $9 or so.\n\nJust Burrata - I would defnitely try one of their crostini con burrata dishes as an appetizer if you're planning a visit.  I had the Just Burrata, which is essentially just toast points and cheese, but the cheese is great house-made fresh mozzarella.  Very creamy texture and sprinkled with sea salt and EVOO, this appetizer is not filling but is very very tasty.\n\nEasyrider on the rocks - Jameson and a splash of amaretto and I think Disarono.  Oh yeah I forgot I don't like Jameson.  Why did I order this?  Oh yeah it sounded good.  But wasn't worth $12!\n\nOverall a 4 star place.  What could make it 5 stars?  Less cramped quarters, slightly larger portions for your dollar.  Other than that it was definitely a hit in my book.  \n\nNote about the dress code - It is not \"dressy\" but it is not supposed to be basketball shorts and a hoodie, either.  That being said if your money is green they won't turn you down.  But for the record the OpenTable website calls their dress code \"smart causal\".  Jeans and a nice shirt are fine, I wouldn't call it \"dressy\".\n\nFun note on the side - when we were aout done a group sat down and I couldn't help but overhear their conversation.  The young 60-somethings were discussing Yelp and how it's \"useless\" and full of \"opinionated know-nothings\" who \"have no life\" =)", "author": "Robert K."}

I walked in and my friends were there and getting ready to be seated.  Perfect timing!\n\nWe were seated on the top floor in a private table with curtains about half drawn.  Kind of weird, but it quickly grew on us as we were able to have a good conversation without too much noise.\n\nI ordered the heirloom tomato salad to start and my friends ordered the shrimp plate.  We got a bottle of Groth, which was excellently priced at $79.\n\nThe shrimp was just OK.  It came on a skillet and you had to peel it first.  I hate having to peel my own shrimp, but I only had one to try, since it was my friends' dish.  At least I know I wouldn't order it.\n\nThe tomato dish, on the other hand, was heavenly!  Cherry-sized tomatoes with avocado and cro\u00fbton and a balsamic vinaigrette.  Plus very, very, very fresh mozzarella made it a great appetizer!\n\nI ordered the bone-in fillet for my main meal with a side of sweet potatoes. The waiter challenged that if this wasn't the best fillet we've ever had he would buy it for us.  And at $39, it's reasonably priced.  Folks.. it was one of the top steaks I've ever had.  Perfectly seasoned and a great temperature for \"medium\".  The potatoes were just OK, and frankly weren't even necessary.\n\nOverall, we had a great dinner.  Highly recommend and will be back for sure!", "author": "Todd M."}

This place was my kind of steak house with that lounge-y atmosphere (red mood lighting, soft music, weird deco, cool vibe...).   I only was here for a quick drink, but service was on point.  This place is tiny!  If you're a tad claustrophobic you might be a bit uneasy (that bar is small and cramped - but I love it).  Looks like the key to eating here is reservations.  They brought out some plates while I was waiting and OMFG.  Smelled so good.\n\nSo yeah, 4 stars after 700 reviews - I don't think this place is effing around!", "author": "Chris B."}

With such a quirky name for a steakhouse I was amazed to find out what it really meant. The name actually had nothing to do with steak at all.\n\nboboquivari\n(bo-bo-kwee-var-ee)\nThe venetian court jester of comedy, embodied in a popular Italian marionette.\n\nInteresting. As a San Francisco native, I've just heard this restaurant referred to as Bobo's. Apparently you can't call it Bobo's unless you've dined there before, so with me writing this review it looks like I've earned my rights of passage!\n\nBobo's isn't a traditional steakhouse in terms of the decor. Following suit to its name the decor is quite festive that fits the mood of Mardi Gras with the black and red color scheme and masks hanging on the walls.\n\nLet's talk about the food, notably the steak. Most of our group picked the signature Bone-In Filet Mignon. This was my first time ordering Filet Mignon attached to the bone. I'm not exactly sure if it added that much more to my experience. It actually was more of a hassle to cut around the bone or to extract the meat that got stuck to the bone. I didn't find that it added any extra beefy flavor to my piece of steak. The steak did come with a unique brown steak sauce that was slightly tangy.\n\nI ordered my Filet Mignon rare, but I felt it came out more on the medium rare side. The cooking was slightly uneven throughout the steak. There were spots that were more rare than others. The Filet Mignon at Bobo's also wasn't the most tender piece of Filet I've had before. The outside of the steak was nicely seared though.\n\nFor our group's sides we shared the sourdough bread, macaroni and cheese, swiss chard, portabello mushrooms, and the twice baked potato.\n\nI really enjoyed the baked garlic and olive sourdough loaf. It was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The olive spread gave the bread a slightly saltier taste. The macaroni and cheese was considered a modern spin on the dish. They used egg noodles instead of elbow macaroni and it wasn't overly cheesy or heavy. The swiss chard tasted like spinach and was a good balance to the steak. The portabello mushrooms were a definite winner at the table and I would recommend ordering it. It was also cooked with capers, which was pretty unique. The twice baked potato was also very tasty. It was mashed potato inside of a baked potato.\n\nI didn't get a chance to try the crab this time, but I'd be interested in coming back to try it one day to make my meal a surf and turf. Although the steak wasn't the best I've had before, the sides were very solid.\n\nA last thing to note, Bobo's offers free valet parking!", "author": "Jason H."}

I rarely order steak at restaurants. A friend brought me here and insisted that they have the best steak in town! So I said OK, let's give it a try since I can do Surf and Turf!\n\nAmbiance:\nchic interior and intimate lighting with the red wall and everything, however it's quite stuffy and crowded in here. The smoke and amazing smell of the food can get quite overwhelming after a few drinks. We got there a bit earlier than our actual reservation so we decided to stay by the bar for a drink or two. It gets really crowded by the bar with waiters walking around, people waiting by the door and the managers checking on the bar and seating area. \n\nDrinks: Mojito was refreshing and their Margarita was very strong and delish as well! You will definitely get a buzz on! \n\nFood: \nSpectacular!\nI definitely like the seasoning for the steak here. It has a beautiful crust around the steak. I tried both the bone in filet mignon and surf and turf here. The bone in filet is definitely more tender! When my friend ordered his bone in, they had a special deal for slightly a few oz more for just 20 dollars more. If you are a meat lover, you might just get lucky for a face size steak! haha.\n(big disappointment for my friend: they messed up his choice of rare with my choice of \"medium rare\" so he was very disappointed, although he still enjoyed his meal).\nThe roasted crab is very delicious. It has the best seasoning and it was very tender. \nAppetizer - Dungeness Crab Crostini with Smoked Salmon, Avocado and Burrata - ABSOLUTELY delightful! The Burrata was so creamy and buttery pairing with the crisp of crostini and smokiness of the smoke salmon. Superb!\nThe brussel sprouts with pancetta here are amazing as well (I'M A BRUSSEL SPROUTS LOVER). Main dishes do not come with side dishes FYI, you have to order them separately (which costs about 10 dollars each).\n \nService:\nnot as great - they are super busy so it was hard to get their attention. The server messed up our order (meat preference) which was a HUGE disappointment. That's why im taking one star off my 5 star review. \n\nIn general, the food was super flavorful and yummy. The service was ok. The ambiance was intimate and romantic. It might be slightly over priced. $44 for surf and turf(however the filet mignon in surf and turf is a lot smaller, maybe a girl's fist size). $39 for bone in, $8-10 for sides like brussel sprouts with pancetta.\n\nI will come back for the food and ambiance for sure!", "author": "Mindy C."}

Well it was a damn good thing HOPB was booked. The 1st thing you notice is the age-old char-grilled aroma of Bobo's. This alone should be marketed and sold. Environment is dimly lit, colorful, cozy and quick to seat you if you don't have a res. If you've never had a dry-aged steak before then for the love of god try one here. I'm a 1st class carnivore but I got the Petit Filet. You can have a bigger cut but the richness of the dry aged steak and the sides together will zombie-fy you if you're not careful. My dish came out in 15 minutes! Don't get it well done. The staff knows you need it medium to medium rare. Melts in your freaking mouth. Buttery. Well seasoned. For sides I had the twice baked potato and the 'ModMac', which was so good I had to ask the waitress what evil henchman created it. 3 kinds of cheese: Sicilian Parmesan, Port Reyes Blue, and White Cheddar. If you can somehow get a bite of steak and the 2 sides on your fork and into your mouth, you may die of ecstasy. If you survive, wash it down with a sip of good red wine. Repeat. \n\nSteaks were a bit pricey but I have to say I feel like my money was well spent.\n\nI'll be back Bobo.", "author": "Chris A."}

The FM was seriously tender and you could literally pull the meat off with your fork.  I was afraid I would need steak sauce but the seasonings they used was perfect.  I would probably order it Medium next time, as it was just a little too red for me but, you wouldn't have known since I ate that piece of meat down to the bone!\n\nThe s/o ordered the Mussels, Shrimp & Crab, which was a presentation in itself.  It came out on a griddle and managed to continue cooking for a good 7-10 minutes while at the table.  I think the portion was big enough for two to share, so long as you order an appetizer and salad to start.\n\nOh yeah, their appetizers, we had the Crostini with Crab and Smoked Salmon.  Not a smoked salmon kind of guy but, damn that was delcious!  It was also served with a nice chunk of soft mozzarella cheese that tasted awesome when spread on the Olive Loaf.\n\nSides, we had the Portabella Mushrooms, which I think could've used a little flavor.  Seemed like it was just cut up, blanched and served.  The Twice Baked Potato was awesome!  I swear, every bite I took, I experienced a different flavor.  Definitely worth ordering!\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Monterossa, an Italian Strawberry Cheesecake.  It was heavy like your standard cheesecake but instead, very light and delicious.\n\nOur server was outstanding!  I forgot her name but she kind of looked like Amanda on Ugly Betty.  Very pleasant at all times and was genuinely friendly.\n\nI actually love the eclectic style of the restaurant, the decor and the multi-levels.  It kind of reminds me of my hotel, in \"Hotel City\" one of the many apps that's sucked me in on FB.  It's quite intimate as the dining rooms are small but, IMO, the best place to sit are the bistro tables at the bar, you get a prime window seat!\n\nParking is valet and it's free.  Yup, FREE!  What?  Free Valet parking in SF?  Hell to the yes!  Granted, they park the car in the garage right below the restaurant but it beats the hassle of finding a parking spot.

But for the prices, you won't be making it your local haunt or weekly go-to unless you've got a considerable amount of extra income.\n\nThe menu selection doesn't offer a ton of options, but if you just want some well above average steak, crab, or lobster, you'll have plenty of ways to satisfy that craving. Just know going in that you're likely to spend at least $60-$100 a head minimum if you're having an appetizer, drink, entree and side.\n\nThe decor, ambience, and atmosphere are very nice, if a bit dark. The layout and design of the dining areas does well to make every space feel intimate without sacrificing that all important \"energy\" and chatter that makes a restaurant feel alive when it's full. Also, the music is surprisingly good despite being contemporary. This does an excellent job of keeping the mood relaxed even though the prices would otherwise indicate \"stuffy.\"\n\nDress Code: None enforced, but everything from jeans/button-up to suits/evening wear is acceptable and seems in-place.\n\nBest Suited For: First dates, celebration dinners, \"nice night out\" dinners with family, friends, and significant others.\n\nAvoid If: You're on a budget, aren't interested in the difference between a $20 steak and a $50 steak, or don't love fresh sea food and the associated cost.", "author": "Aaron C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-06", "description": "Bobo's, you've let me down. Sure, your steaks were some of the best I've ever had, but a girl cannot live (and dine) on steak alone. Taking everything else into consideration, I was underwhelmed. \n\nI came here with my mom while she was visiting and we certainly feasted, starting with the IRON SKILLET-ROASTED SEAFOOD COMBO with mussels, shrimp, and crab (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=kobhqDwU0lKRIFYARQqzjQ). It really wasn't that great. The skillet was scorching hot and sizzled loudly for a good while. There were a ton of mussels, 5 crab legs, but only 8 shrimp. The shrimp and mussels were tiny and the crab legs were dry. Nothing was all that flavourful (where was the garlic in the garlic sauce?) and everything was doused with copious amounts of (i.e. too much) melted butter.\n\nWe also got the CURRY LOBSTER SOUP (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=9bhbBOXmFaSU0duUPeYzNQ) and yellowtail carpaccio. The soup was more a thick curry soup with two lobster pieces than a lobster bisque. The YELLOTAIL CARPACCIO (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=F-ENPjrFhnw1jdAVu6BxCQ) was way too thinly sliced to get the nice buttery texture I like in yellowtail (it was actually kinda rough) and the other components overwhelmed the delicate flavour of the fish. On top of that the fish was drenched with way too much olive oil.\n\nFor the sides we got the \"modern\" mac & cheese (what makes it modern? I have no idea), twice-baked potato, and baked yam. The MAC & CHEESE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=U-MYG_37XH7cen05N-MHcA) was ok but a litttle too rich for me. There was way more cheese sauce than I knew what to do with (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=Af11doxiqaBvDRknNnoJTg). The mashed BAKED YAM (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=lNLNT1EU7U3_TTV4RRLZJA) was cloyingly sweet and really didn't need the brown sugar on top. The TWICE-BAKED POTATO (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=vxPjlHC73YEOBcPXCM_pSw) was the only non-steak dish we really liked. It was a halved hollowed out baked potato filled with a yummy tangy warm potato salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=dwOsLpan7k85-TmihdKyLA) with zucchini to add crunch.\n\nAs for our steaks, we shared a PORTERHOUSE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=JsSWNPXdsYm29TAv-_vWpQ). Though cooking the bone-in new york and petit filet separately ensured both cuts were cooked properly, it took away from the wow-factor of a porterhouse. Presentation aside, the steaks were spectacular! Cooked perfectly rare (as I requested - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=eZEmblPxN-O3WAGDOFYu9A, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=bs7ERDKjcF9pDy06Vos5jg), both were so tender with the new york (surprisingly) more so. The steaks were seasoned well and no salt and/or pepper was necessary (unlike at Harris'). Best of all was the slightly nutty flavour from the butter - it was the most amazing steak butter I've ever had!\n\nFor dessert we had the PISTACHIO PANNA COTTA (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=zN324c4zHgJJpKvSxlbi7Q) and MONTEROSA (strawberry Italian cheesecake, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=vhB6yTWuA7KgJW89C9Ke2g). The cheesecake was delish. Similar to a tiramisu, it was light and fluffy. The panna cotta was a miss, both flavour- and texture-wise. Instead of pistachio I tasted coconut. And unlike any other panna cotta I've ever had, this one was dense, heavy, and grainy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNU6sPRWzVl0ngCRqat1TQ?select=sgZphVa_dAll5CSdCTUXDA).

That being said, some of the so called \"great\" steak places really fall short in my book.  For example, Sparks (NYC) and Smith & Wollensky (NYC & Philly) are average at best.  But if you're a fan of Mastro's (LA) or WOlfgang's (NYC), then we're on the same page.\n\nBoboquivari's is an old school steak experience at its finest.  Decor is basic, but the food is amazing!  This is the second time I've been, and it was as consistent as the first.  \n\nFor starters, the crab legs are better than you can get at Crustacean.  Then jumping to the entree, the bone-in-filet, NY strip and porterhouse were all prepared to perfection, from the seasoning to the temperature.  I recommend the sauce on the side.  Who would ruin a good piece of meat with too much sauce?\n\nExtra bonus is the valet.  A nice touch that you would expect in SoCal but find as a luxury in SF.", "author": "Thom P."}

My husband and I come here about once a year to treat ourselves to a decadent, delicious meal.\n\nThe ambiance is fun and reminiscent of a Mardi Gras-themed Cirque du Soleil.  The tables are a little on the small side and crammed a little close together so prepare to be cozy.  I think you have to request a table by the window and if you don't, be prepared to sit in a darker room with no windows.  The darker rooms aren't bad; in fact they can be cozy and romantic.  Bobo's service has always been excellent with attentive and pleasant staff.  We feel like we're treated to a very special experience whenever we dine here.\n\nAnd the food!  I don't think there's a bad item on the menu.  So far I've only had the crab and the petite fillet mignon entrees, and the petite fillet is what I keep going back for again and again.  All of the side dishes are tasty.  I particularly like the mushrooms and the twice-baked potato.  So yummy!  The wine list is quite accomplished but there are lovely vintages in all price ranges if you want to splurge on dinner and save on wine.\n\nSpoil yourself with an experience at Bobo's.

The bread had good flavor but is on the dry side.  We ate two loaves and both were on the dry side.  The caesar salad was disappointing.  I had a better caesar at Dick Clark's restaurant in Salt Lake City.  Dick Clark doesnt even freakin cook.  The grilled mussels, shrimp, and crab was ok.  It comes out on a hot platter that will burn yo face with splatter from the sauce they put over it.  Now for the main event.  The BONE in FILET!  All my fat friends have been raving about this steak.  I am not a huge filet fan but the steak itself was good.  I just had Delmonico's in Vegas a few weeks ago and for the same price Delmonicos destorys this place.  Half way through my filet I found a sticker that I took a picture of and posted it under their photos.  I eat a lot of food.  I have fucking 1300 plus reviews.  I have been to a lot of steakhouses.  This is the first time I ever found a fucking sticker in my $50 steak.  The best the waitress could do was to take my plate away and give me a cold plate to finish my steak.  I wonder if this was still sanitary to eat.  She said when the grilled it it stuck to the bottom of the steak.  If it was grilled how come the sticker isn't burnt?  In the pic it looks like it just fell in the sauce or some shit.  This place takes the first place in a major steakhouse fuck up.  On top of this shit when we get the bill they overcharged us on an addition soup we did not order.  Someone in management needs to be fired.  But it does make me feel better my $50 choice steak was USDA approved!", "author": "Fatty A."}

Holy sh*t, you wouldn't believe how excited I was when I saw the welcome email last night. Many piercing squeals of joy rang throughout the house. THANKS, YELP!\n\nFirst things first, did you know that a Bobovaquivari is a court jester? Did you know that their floppy three pointed hats represent the ears and tail of a donkey? It's good to learn something new everyday.\n\nThis is definitely a one-of-a-kind steakhouse. The decor is dark, loud, and funky, and has a large hand-painted marionette hanging above the kitchen. Various frames and knick knacks adorn red and black striped wallpaper in a charming hodge podge of clutter.\n\nThe loaf of sourdough topped with garlic and olive oil was a bit of a miss. The bread was so oily I had no desire to oil-fy my fingers trying to tear a piece off. \n\nCrabcakes! Two decently sized cakes sat upon a bed of cranberries sauteed in butter and deliciousness. Those cranberries freaking partied in my mouth. Tasty morsels, get in my belly!\n\nBone-in filet mignon! As tasty as everyone raving about it said it was! Juicy, tender, and so flavorful! Such a large cut of meat too, only a true carnivore will be able to stuff the whole thing down into their stomachs!\n\nEven though we were absolutely stuffed like no other, our greedy piggy eyes eyed the cheesecake as a dessert. Each bite was a chore, but what a delicious chore it was. \n\nGood for a date, or for a group of classy diners. I would quite enjoy having a glass of wine (or three) while chortling away in a classy way with friends.", "author": "Carolyn K."}

I ordered a medium rare as I couldn't chance a overcooked steak.  I was so impressed how perfectly cooked it was as a medium rare and consistent to my dining mate's filets were.

It was crisp and refreshing. \n\nPortions are a good size, food is on the pricey side but well worth it! \n\nOnly thing that was weird, is that the tables are really close to eachother.

Too fast in my opinion considering the couple of made to order steaks. Bread came after the food though, and only because we asked for it -again-. We had to stand up and go look for our waitress a couple of times because she didn't check in after taking our order or while we were dining. At one point, we had to flag down a different server when the first one was no where to be found. It wasn't the businest day or time either.

So while we were enjoying our meal, I found a hair in my boyfriend's steak. We told the hostess what was going on and this little bitch responded us with a  \"Uhh, all of our chefs and staffs have hats and hair nets in the kitchen\". EXCUSE ME?! So are you implying that we are lying to you that we found a hair in he steak that you guys served us? We then told her that we just found it there and she just walked away without doing ANYTHING. Ridiculously rude! Not only did she not handle the situation, she gave us attitude. OH HELL NO, BITCH. Then our waitress came and took care of the situation. My boyfriend then asked if that hotess was a bitch, and of couse, our lovely waitress laughed(Yes). So my boyfriend had his steak switched, and when our waitress brought it back she told us that they found more hair in that steak. How disgusting...After that steak situation, I was in no mood to eat anymore, for that hostess has ruined my evening on our 1 year anniversary. As we were planning to leave, I waited for my boyfriend to finish using the restroom. When he came back he told me that when he look through the kitchen window, only TWO people were wearing hats. I was about to about to explode in anger at that moment!! Not only did that bitch accused us of lying, she fucking lied to us as well. Shake my head...I hope she gets fired after I talk to her manager. As the bill arrived, yes it was expensive.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food. Personally I would not come here again. However, their steaks are really delicious. My boyfriend ordered a suf & turf ( steak and crab)while I ordered my filet minon in bone. My steak was fat and juicy. Their medium rare is basically a rare steak to me , so to all those medium rare steak lovers,  I prefer you guys order medium or else it'd be too rare to eat. My boyfriend's steak was quite small, but it made sense because he had the crab, too. We also ordered the mushrooms and the twiced baked potato as sides. Oh, and the mussels, too! The mushrooms and the baked potato were good, but the mussels were the best. They also had their complimentary garlic sourdough bread, which was a bit too oily for me. Overall everything was delicious, but I personally felt that everything was just too oily. Even though their mussels were good, it arrived in a puddle of oil, which was not that appealing. Even if we didn't experience the unprofessional service from that bitch hostess, we still would not come here again. Maybe it's because the place was just too small and dark. But overall, Bobo's was just not my cup of tea...in other words, THIS PLACE SUCK! Come to BoBo's if you want to eat hair.", "author": "Anna F."}

They have several floors of seating with window views.  The bone-in filet seems to be the winner there, unfortunately I got the petite filet and the fish, which both were ok.  Service is ok, they don't add gratuity on the check even though we had a party of 8.  I'd come back and only order the bone-in filet next time.", "author": "Spencer T."}

Here the food just explodes with flavor everything from the bread to the sides to the steak dinner is great. I feel that although the food here is really expensive, the flavors in a way make up for it. However, if it's just once in a while it's alright. \n\nMy experience here came when I went for a friend's birthday party. We probably ordered everything off the menu, I'm serious! The food came out nice and hot and each item I was not disappointed in. I kept thinking throughout the night of the cost though, I kept saying to myself I'd rather go to House of Prime Rib and get way more than this (which is true, but the food specifics are not the same) Other than that portions here are kind of on the small side, but the flavors pack a punch. When you order your $40 steak or crab it comes with nothing else. You must order sides which are $8\n\nOverall, Bobo's is a great place to bring someone special, your family or even your boss (to get that next promotion right? ). The prices are a little steep so make sure you cashed your paycheck. The food has a lot of flavor so balance it out with the delicious complimentary garlic and olive oiled bread. I will not see myself here anytime soon, but if you want to try some good flavored crab and filet then come to Bobo's\n\nRecommended Items: ***(my photos are in the photos section)***\n- Surf and Turf ( petite filet mignon and half a crab)\n- Bone-in Filet Mignon\n- Twice Baked Potato\n- Portobello Mushrooms\n- Shrimp (tastes great, but definitely not worth $15 for several small shrimp)", "author": "Michael J."}

We were greeted with complimentary valet (whaaaat???!!)) So rare in the city.  We went here on a friend's recommendation...said her husband proposed to her after she took him there lol so we figured we had to see what this place was all about.\n\nEverything we had was awesome!\n\nWe started with the bread (bomb!) and the lobster soup (super good!). The waitress explained it was made out of a puree of cauliflower & potato w/coconut milk and curry and big chunks of lobster (no dairy!)...it was deeeeelish!!!\n\nI had the surf and turf (petite filet & half crab).  The steak was divine.  The crab was finger-lickin' yummy.\n\nHe had the whole crab, and it was so much, he was defeated by the crab (he doesn't get defeated by food ever, always cleans his plate!).  And as he sat back in sheer euphoria from his meal, his eyes began to droop from food coma lol.  Poor guy.  \n\nWe opted to have a salad served as our side, so we went for the house salad.

(they better be too, at the price you're paying). \n\nso why is this place my favorite? because i like the way the meat is seasoned here. its more flavorful. and that is my only reason. i feel like thats fair. i mean, why else would you go to a steakhouse and pay $100/person? because you want steak, right? I'm not gonna go to a steakhouse and order chicken... 0.o (i don't even think they serve chicken here). \n\nanyway. if you like your steak to be more seasoned and flavorful, i think you'll like this place better than most of the others. it might be because bobo's has the oldest dry aged meat in the city...or is west coast? i forget...but whatever. its really good. \n\na regular cut or surf and turf (petit filet mingot and half a crab) is about $44. the bone in filet mingot is slightly more tender. they do not come with any sides. sides are about $9 or $10 and are all delish. \n\nthe fish carpaccio is really good, but the slices of fish are HELLLLA thin and there's not much of it...i recommend the crab cake appetizer. i get that every time. they have  mussels and stuff, but i don't care much for shellfish so i never order it. \n\ndesserts are...ehhh. i usually go towards the pier for dessert after. make an event out of it. haha\n\nservice is ok. not bad, but could be better. \n\n(damn, my review doesn't sound like it should be 5 stars, huh? i guess overall it should actually be like 4...but i'm gonna go ahead and give it 5 anyway, just because their MAIN DISH is the STEAK. and their STEAK is better than the other places. and also, they have free valet parking!) haha. \n\n5 stars.

It was so good. It was the perfect complementary of sweet and sour. \n\nMy main course, I ordered the Petit Filet Mignon and Eggs got the Surf and Turf. We ordered the Baked Yam and Twice Baked Potato which was TO DIE FOR. I'm guessing it has in it cheese, zucchini and crack or something in that potato. It was sooo delicious. My filet mignon was cooked to perfection and Eggs had no complaints. And he's usually picky about his meat. \n\nWe ended our perfect meal with the Mango Panna Cotta.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-31", "description": "I think I may have finally been initiated into the Jeh clan, with Joe Dirty asking me to join the family for a pre New Years dinner. Usually when I eat steak, I don't give a fuck and wear sweatpants so that the elastic waistband can freely expand unlike the skinnies I wear.  However, because this was a first impression opportunity, I sadly shucked off the sweatpants for khakis and a shirt for a button-up.  Our reservation was at 6:30 and there was plenty of parking around Bobos.  Like many Yelpers have mentioned, Boboquivari does not look like much, situated between some cheap motels.  However, once you enter into, it is visually completely different than its surroundings.  The interior has a very intimate setting and you can immediately tell it is upscale.  The good thing about a large party is that it gives you an opportunity to try many dishes that a party of two can't.\n\nOur waitress brought out a loaf of bread and it was okay.  The middle parts were soaked with butter, however, the butter was not evenly dispersed.  As a result, you got some really unbuttered pieces.  The bread they give is fleshy and thick so it easily becomes dry if you land a part that isn't doused in better.  For appetizers and sides, we ordered:\n\ncrispy crab cakes: 4/5  The crab cakes were delicious, especially with the cranberry relish.  It was the perfect pairing.  \n\nyellowtail carpaccio: 2/5  The yellow carpaccio was basically an appetizer that wasn't.  The fish was sliced so razor thin, it was pretty much invisible.  Whenever I thought I got some fish, I ended getting a spoonful of sauce.  This was pretty much a $15 non-appetizer.  \n\ntwice-baked potato: 5/5  The twice baked potato was the best side of the night.  It was so creamy and you could non-literally inhale it.  I loved baked potatoes, especially twice baked because it comes out so much creamier.  The only grip was that 5 greedy hands had to share one potato.\n\nbaked yams: 4/5  My mom used to make yams for me when I was a child and force me to eat it.  Back then, it looked so odd that I refused and many civil wars were fought over it.  I have never acquired a taste of yams since, only politely taking a spoonful of sweet potato pie, which is not bad.  Because the paramour's parents ever seeing eye was fixed upon me, I had to eat everything.  Taking a spoonful, I was very surprised.  It was delicious and I ended up polishing this side off.  \n\nswiss chard: 3/5  Your staple vegetable.  It tasted like anything a mother could make.  \n\nportobello mushrooms: 3/5  I believe these cubed mushrooms, along with the chard were ordered for its fiber properties, to induce a smooth turd later on that night.\n\nmodern mac n cheese: 2/5  I was a little disappointed in this mac n cheese.  They used a different type of pasta, a longer one.  However, it wasn't that creamy.  \n\nfilet mignon bone in- 5/5  Because Bobo's still had filet mignon bone-in, I opted for that.  I felt like eating a piece of meat that was so tender that it didn't require that much chewing.  The waitress explained that their steaks go through a period of aging, creating the perfect texture and taste.  When the steak arrived, it was neither too small nor too big.  It would be considered small if you didn't order additional sides, however, with side dishes, yielded the perfect portion.  My knife cut through it like hot butter and forking a piece into my mouth, I rolled my eyes to the heavens.  It was very good.  A good steak doesn't need much flavor besides salt, peper and some butter.  The thing with me is that I am not really a steak person.  I love it, but am hesitant to pay $50-70 for a steak.  I had a horrible experience at Chops in Chicago and since then, will never pay that much.  The reason being is that I feel I can make something that taste just as good as home.  In addition, it's just too much meat and nothing else.  That is why I always would rather have a good burger than a steak.  WIth that in mind, it was a perfect steak.  I also had some of KJeh's triple platter of mussels was was very disappointed.  Fucken 2/5 type disappointed bro.  While the portions were huge, it wasn't very flavorful.  The lemon garlic butter sauce was barely tastable.  You want some good mussels, go to Frites.  \n\nIf you are a steak lover, go to Bobos.  Nobody had any complaints with the steak.  It was most savory.  I am sure if you go to any higher priced steakhouse, the quality and taste is the same.  It isn't very hard to cook and there is minimal seasoning.  However, refrain from anything else.  The mussels were not that great and Mama Jeh said her fish was too salty.", "author": "Brian V."}

Coming here for the steak alone is totally worth it.  \nMy wife and I came here for our 1 year and she ordered the bone-in filet mignon and I ordered the bone-in NY steak.  Both equally delicious, cooked to perfection.  The food came out quick too.  The steaks came out soon after we finished the crab crostini which we both agreed was good but for $15 we thought we'd get more.  We ended the night with the wild strawberry italian cheesecake.  It's as good as it looks.  Being that it was our anniversary, I thought we'd get something nice, but all we got was a candle in our cheesecake.  I mean they waived the corkage fee for someones bday at the table behind us so of course I thought that.  Not a reason I wouldn't come back though.  \nLooking forward to trying the garlic crab next time.  We had great service too.

I am happy to report that I decided to have our end of craziness celebratory expensive dinner here at Bobo's. Damn what a good idea. *pats self on back*\n\nFirst of all, I had 6 people RSVP and 7 show up. Whoops! The hostesses were great about accomodating it - however it took almost 2 hours. The reservation was for 7pm and we did not get sat until almost 9. However, note the 5 stars I gave it. Thats due to the fact that after an hour plus we were starving and asking how much longer it was going to be they let us order 6 apps - on the house. Which, due to my reservation snafu, it was entirely my fault that we were not seated on time. So kudos for them for customer service. It also probably has something to do with the 4 (ok 5) martinis I had before dinner. But thats how it goes. My favorite app was the mussel shrimp and crab app. served on a sizzling platter - yum!\n\nDinner was simply amazing. Five words for anyone thinking of going to Bobo's: Get The Bone In Filet. 'nuff said. Perfectly cooked (well, mine was at least - one got sent back but came out perfectly the second time) Our server was a delight and always around when we needed her - quite the feat considering the restaurant is spread out over 3 floors and at some point every other guest had left but us. And they were smart and put the large loud group of 5 martini folks in a quiet velvet curtained area. Made me feel all important. Love this place. I will be back many times!", "author": "Brenda K."}

When they were finished talking, they made me feel like i was intruding when I told them I was here for dinner and need a table for two.

I'll never forget the the waitress said to us...\"We're expecting a huge rush after the giants game ends so we're kinda saving those tables\". W...T....F....!?!?! Are you kidding me?! We should have gotten up and left but I was starving. We ended up switching table after we assured them we'd have a quick dinner. I'm so upset still, I'm shaking as i write this.

My bf ordered the $59 porterhouse and while quality definitely trumps quantity, I have to agree with others that this is still overpriced.\n\nWe had the crostini and toy box tomato appetizers. The crostini was definitely delicious but for $13 it was a bummer that it was only enough for two people to have a taste. \n\nI was also slightly disappointed by the bread that they advertise on their website. My bf and I are suckers for places with amazing bread and while theirs was tasty, I wouldn't say I prefer it or that it was even that memorable.\n\nSide dishes were very good - esp. twice baked potato though it is very, very rich so it is one to share for the table. Brussel sprouts in pancetta were just as tasty was they sound.  Portabella mushroom side was good but the all the oil used drowned out a lot of the taste.\n\nWhile the food was an overall 4 stars, the service was an overall 2 stars. Our waiter did the VERY, VERY bare minimal to get by. On several occasions our water glasses were empty for some time until we poured it.  Meanwhile he stood in the corner, when he noticed he would rush over to do so but I mean seriously, you have a bus staff and food runner so really your only job is to make sure we're sufficiently tended to and that was not the case. I just expect more if we're forking over close to $100/person for a nice meal.\n\nGood experience, glad we went but prob wouldn't go back until it was a SUPER special occasion AND their wait staff was better.", "author": "Kristine T."}

I came here with my buddies for a birthday/get-together and I have to say that this is one of the most simple, expensive and best filet mignons I ever had! Hands down!\n\nBobo's interior is a little cramp and dim, but the environment itself is comfortable. Walking in, you'll see the bar straight away and I notice there are seatings in several places in the building, so it's not just one big dining room. The waiting service, I thought, was professional, yet casual. \n\nAlright! We didn't order much, just 3 pounds of crab, Bone-In Filet Mignon each, and a Twice Baked Mashed Potatoes. Topping the orders was the Bone In Filet Mignon! The plate was nothing but meat and it was resting on its own juice. I could taste the butter that they used to cook the steak, but it might have been pan-seared. Whatever it was, the steak was cooked to perfection and to the letter! My buddy's rare steak was cooked on the outside with a thin layer of pink and a whole lot of red! I got mine medium and it was still juicy! Remember, Bone-In!\n\nThe crab was roasted with garlic and herbs. 3 pounds of it was good enough for appetizers for 5 guys. Not the best crab I ever had, but it's still good. The Twice Baked Mashed Potatoes was peppery, but I didn't see anything special other than the fact that it's mashed potatoes sitting in a hollowed out potato cut in half (I don't know if that made sense, but order one and you'll see what I mean).\n\nThe pricing is pretty reasonable for the quality, but don't expect a whole lot to eat. Oh, and I believe there's complimentary valet parking, so that balances the cost up a little.", "author": "Jeremy L."}

Celebrated a friend's birthday here and the group ordered 3 servings of mussels and \"mmmmmmmmmm!!!!\" is all that needs to be said to describe it. Cups of melted butter and garlic accompany the mussels for dipping and believe me, what appeared to be a ridiculous pile of mussels disappeared fast with this crowd!\n\nBone in filet mignon was delicious. However, I would definitely suggest ordering a side of sweet potato as it distracted me away from the filet mignon during the meal from time to time. I was surprised at how creamy and yummy it was, although many at the table commented that it was a tad sweet for their taste. \n\nAnyways, back to the filet mignon. It definitely didn't need any sauce at all! One of the better prepared filet mignons I've had. I had to restrain myself from eating the whole thing and leaving my boyfriend with some extra though, as he is the #1 meat-eater of all time.

In every other steakhouse they either broil or grill your steak. At Bobo's however, they season your steak and sear it in a cast iron skillet, then put it in the oven to finish it off depending on how you like it. This creates a crust on the outside of the steak searing in the juices, that is unlike any I've ever had. The concept has caused me to cook every steak I've had since, using my cast iron skillet. Finishing it off with a bit of butter, garlic, and rosemary, combined with the juices of the steak makes for an incredible bas\ne \"sauce\" to which they lay this Devine piece of meat on top before serving. \nThe mussels appetizer (also cooked in cast iron) Is absurdly amazing. And if you like dungeoness crab, they boil it in a base liquid that makes the meat taste incredible even without needing to dunk it In butter as I usually do. Once again, unique to anything else I've had, And all around pretty much the best place ever.\nEvery one of my friends from out of own that I take there (3 so far) have all walked out agreeing it was the best steak they have had.\n \nIf your looking for a cheaper steak house that is also phenomenal, with the best au gratin potatoes In history, go down the street to izzy's. but I you've got the loot to drop on the best steak you may ever taste.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-11-11", "description": "Having read all the glowing reviews, we were very disappointed to to be served mediocre steak and substandard side dishes.   The service ranged from perfuntory to downright poor.  Restuarants like this that offer a limited menu usually ensure that their few offerings are outstanding.  Here, the limited menu is a sign of their limited commitment to quality.\n\nIn detail-\n* The Steaks- We all ordered the bone-in New York strip.  I was pleased to see that they served bone-in versions of the strip and filet.  Usually, finding the bone-in version on the menu means the restaurant really cares to serve the best cut.  Not in this case.  Our steaks were smallish (12-13 ounces) and they weren't seared on the outside.  Instead, they came out brown with a light covering of a slightly-sweet steak sauce.  A good steak does not need to be covered in steak sauce  (offering the diner steak sauce on the side is a reasonble option, but a good restaurant shouldn't smear it over my steak as a matter of course).  My steak was cooked reasonably properly.  A pink, but not pink/red medium-rare.  The waitress actually told us that their medium-rare was closer to rare, but this was not the case at all.  My steak wasn't tough, but clearly less tender than the usual prime grade New York strip.  In addition, it actually had a streak of gristle through through the middle that required me to cut around it.  Flavor was that of a high-grade choice steak, not a prime one.\n\n* Cocktails-  I ordered a Beefeater gin martini, up with olives.  The waitress had to come back later to tell me that they don't have Beefeater.  She didn't know this when taking the cocktail order.  My martini was served with hot pepper olives.  Who in their right mind serves a hot pepper olive martini to a customer without telling them or asking them if they like it this way?  I'm glad that I didn't order a premium gin only to have the flavor so changed by hot pepper.  Ridiculous.  I should have sent it back.\n\n* Side Dishes- They serve a reasonably good baked garlic and olive sourdough bread.  But the crust on the loaf is so hard you can't cut through it without a serrated knife (which of course, they didn't provide).  The smooth-edged knives on the table weren't sharp enough to do so. We managed to chop and tear it up (crumbs all over).  The bread is not served with butter or olive oil, and the bread is fairly dry.  Whose idea was that?  Our apples, walnuts, sundried cranberries salad was standard fare, with an standard dressing.  The twice baked potato was good.  But only  1/2 of the potato was served.  We were told by the waitress that each side dish was enough for two people.  If a half potato serves two people, they must be light eaters.\n\n* Service- When we walked in, the maitre-d did not greet us, or even seem to notice we were standing there.  Instead, she was on a long coversation on the phone, turned around so her back was to us, jotting down reservation info on a form that she held against the wall.  After a few minutes of us just standing there looking around, she paused a moment to say \"hold on, I will be right with you\".  After about five minutes more, she finally greeted us, then seated us.  Our waitress was a pleasant person, but we saw her once for the cocktails, once for the dinner order, and once for the check.  (as mentioned before, she didn't know what common drinks were available at the bar).  During the dinner,  I dropped my knife, and no one was available to ask for a replacement.  After some time without seeing anybody to ask for a replacement, I had to take one from the table next to me.  I guess I should have just stood up and walked over to the bar to find a live person and asked for a new one. Very innatentive amateur service, that bordered on ungracious.\n\n* Ambiance-  This was the high point of the meal.  It is a funky space, decorated in an eclectic 19th century way.  Fun and cozy.\n\n* Parking- Free valet.  This is great!\n\nOverall, a third rate experience at first rate prices.  We enjoy steak very much, and we have dined in some of the best steak houses in Los Angeles, New York, Las Vegas and Chicago (and a few in Japan).  From the reviews, I thought we had found \"our place\" in our home city of San Francisco.  Although we have had a few disappointments in the past when dining in other highly regarded steak houses, in my opinion, Bobos was the worst steak and worst dining experience that I have ever had at a restaurant that claims to specialize in high-quality aged, prime grade beef.", "author": "Preston F."}

My husband ordered the filet, and he enjoyed it a little, however he's a big lover of the rib eye which they don't carry, so his opinions about his entree weren't very praising either.  Medium Rare is how the steaks are served, and that's great because a lot of people enjoy them like that.

Normally cooked med-rare and can b a tad too salty(happened twice now so minus 1 star) but bone in New York or Filet is the way to go. \n\nA couple going with drinks, apps, dinner, dessert, rounds out about $200 or so. \n\nEasy curbside VALET parking, which is a blessing in SF........", "author": "Rafael N."}

We were seated upstairs which we had to ourselves for part of dinner so we had the chance to have some intimate time together. We both ordered the recommended bone-in filet medium rare. Now I have never had a bone in before so I was a newbie. We ordered two sides, Bermuda onion rings and Pancetta brussel sprouts to accompany our meat. They started us off with a loaf of delicious garlic olive bread. I was care not to indulge as to have room for the main course. Our steaks arrived with great timing. The smell was intoxicating and it looked like it would melt into the plate. I had my first bite and was in love. So flavorful and tender. They really dry aged these steaks. The onion rings with the steak together was even better. The spouts were excellent as well, a little stingy on the pancetta but still great. The bf cleaned his plate and I had a good 8oz wrapped to go. For the price it was perfect. Great service, food, complimentary valet (so awesome) and vibe made our night. We will definitely be back soon. \n\nSide note: steak reheated the next day still was perfect. Now that's what I call a piece of beef!!", "author": "Bri R."}

My Wife and I really love the \"Crab House\" and the \"Dead Fish\" that are part of this restaurants sister establishments with a very similar menu especially when it comes to the Crab.  \n\nSo we thought lets try out this place because they have steak too... Well we call and the hostess Rosemarie was very nice but let us know that it usually takes about a week in advance to get reservations.  So we thought well this place must be great!... right? \n\nWell a week later we pull up to awesome free valet parking and then walk in to get seated.  At this point we have all these built up expectations but instead of continuing to be wowed some more we got let down completely from there.  \n\nWe'll the server who I guess didn't understand English very well just pretty much did horrible at his job.  He hardly came to check on us and left the door open that let in an extremely cold draft in.  Since he hadn't been up in ten minutes I decided to close the door on my own.  Once he came back up he opened it right back up again instead of looking around or asking if anyone was cold.  However 5 minutes later they seat a party right next to the door and do what of course... close it!!!  My friends ordered beers and we tried to ask him for the same cold glass he had given me for my beer and all he did was reach over to the table next to him and pull the water glasses off of those??? Of course part of dinning is your servers personality and recommendations right... well this guy didn't really have either.  When we got the food it ended up being good but the steak was definitely not as good as Ruth Chris for the price they were charging.\n\nSo at the end of the day we realized we can say three things now.\n1) We have been to Bobo's...   :-\\\n2) The food is pretty good but not \"amazing\" by any means.  \n3) It is definitely not worth a weeks wait for the ambiance or price for anything on their menu except the Crab and were going to stick to the \"Crab House\" and the \"Dead Fish\" and wont be back to Bobo's.  \n\nSorry to everyone else who raved about this place but you all should really eat out more. Just because it looks like a really nice steak house with black napkins and wine glasses ready to go that doesn't mean other places with the same prices don't blow this one out of the water.\n\nI hoped this helped someone???", "author": "Guillermo R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-11-04", "description": "I went to Bobo's expecting just as good of an experience as Harris base on the reviews but the experience severely fell short.\n\nValet parking was prompt, courteous and best of all, free.  My friends and I arrived 30 minutes early but we were seated in few minutes.  The restaurant has a very cozy feel to it but I felt really cramped and stuffy but it passed as soon as we were seated.  The decor is very original.\n\n\nOn to the dinning.  Our waiter was attentive but seemed preoccupied of had something on her mind.  She was attentive in making sure our drink cups were filled but still seemed kind of off.  It gave my group a bit of an ackward feeling.  My friends and I proceeded to order our entrees and sides.  Here is where the explanation of the two star rating comes in:\n\nWe ordered the following items:\n\nPetite Filet\nPorterhouse (to share)\nPortabello mushrooms\nOnion Rings\nTwice Baked Potato\n\n\nWhen my friend received her petite filet, I remember thinking to myself that Hostess cupcakes are probably bigger than this, but hey, it's dry aged so it must taste friggin awesome if they're gonna charge $28 for it.  The porterhouse steak turned out to be the NY strip and petite filet cooked separately and served on the same plate.  I figure, makes sense, a porterhouse is two different cuts on the same bone.  That said, the steaks were cooked perfectly.  The problem was that they had absolutely no flavor.  Seriously, no flavor.   Don't get me wrong, they were tender, but if you think I was drunk, sick with a cold, or on crack at the time, I wasn't.  The sauce that was served with the steaks help, but didn't justify the hype or save the experience.  \n\nOn to the sides.  You normally can't go wrong with Portobello mushrooms and this time was no exception.  I did, however, wish they didn't cut it up into half inch chunks.  The sauce on top was a bit too lemony.  Onion rings - served with aioli.  They weren't anything special.  Worst off, I paid $8 for five small pieces (nowhere near the size of Ruth's Chris onion rings which are the size of donuts).  Lastly, on to the baked potato.  This was awesome.  Creamy/chunky/cheesy.  Order it if you go.  Period.\n\nWe glanced over the deserts but nothing appealed to us and we ended up going to Byrite Creamery instead.\n\nAll in all, I was seriously disappointed but not enough to give this place a 1 star.  Not my preferred way to spend almost $200 bucks and believe it or not, we were in and out in about an hour and twenty minutes.  I've been to McDonalds were I've stayed longer.  If I had a chance to do it over, I think I would have opted for spending $30 for the three of us at Sizzler instead but hindsight is 20/20.....  Maybe I should've ordered the crab?  Don't know.  I won't be coming back unless it's on someone else's tab.  If you're looking for steaks, Harris or Ruth's Chris are your best bets.  Harris being smaller portion/more flavor.  Ruth Chris being larger portions/slightly less flavorful but still a great experience.", "author": "Tang K."}

A little bigger than a silver dollar and encrusted with breading.  They were alright, even better with the cranberry served with them.  Paired with glass of Savignon Blanc. ($9)\n\nLimited wines by the glass, but affordable choices for bottles.\n\nIT STARTED TO SPRINKLE:  I ordered, without hesitation, the New York Strip bone-in, Medium rare. ($39)  It was brought, rare, blue at that.....had to send it back....darn it!  I'm used to this practice at Morton's...\n\nCooking a steak properly is the most essential thing at a steakhouse. (duh) Everything else is secondary.  They failed at this.  Putting a great cut back onto the grill, no longer makes it a great cut and devalues it too.\n\nBrought it back.  It was fine...a little tough and dry.  But excellent taste, the closer the meat was to the bone.  \n\nPaired it with a lovely Merlot, ($9) gave the server a choice between the Merlot and Zinfadel, but she said, they were OUT of the Zinfadel. How could they be out  of it on a Friday night?  Hm...\n\nIT'S FINALLY RAINING:  So, for dessert I ordered the Italian Cheesecake.  Very sweet, and good.  The top was a layer of strawberry cream cheese, the middle was regular cream cheese inbetween white cake.  Like a strawberry tiramisu without the rum.  ($8)\n\nFinished with a Reisling dessert wine -lovely.\n\nCOST OF UMBRELLA: $101.  Wow.  \n\nTHEY LADY HOLDING MY UMBRELLA: Service was great.  She was very friendly, charming and very helpful, even when the others tried to take my half-eaten steak, thinking I was done, as well as reasurring me my payment was fine when another server was confused with my OpenTable dollars.\n\nMY SHELTER:  Small rooms.  Could be claustrapobic, but nice if you want the evening to be intimate. Kind-of an all over restaurant, not sure what it's trying to look like...Small.

Great cocktails, easy going service, a menu centered around meat, a long list of fattening sides you can pick and choose from, and quirky borderline freaky decor. I think they call it \"venetian\". That's one way to say it.\n\nA group of my nearest and dearest and I set up a date between ourselves and plates of beef to celebrate the birth of baby Jesus. I liked that the place was relatively full, even on Christmas. Guess we weren't the only ones hoping for a less traditional dining option on December 25th. We arrived early and grabbed a cocktail. I snagged and gulped a terrific blueberry margarita. \n\nThe tables are set up in various offshoots of rooms, so each dining experience is unique and intimate but not isolating. We sat in front of a fireplace surrounded by diamond patterned wall coverings with a large clown-friend guarding the entrance to the room. I only wish there was a tight-rope walker.\n\nWe sat down, ordered way too much food, and enjoyed ourselves immensely. Lots of petite filets, some bone-in NY strips, a few orders of crab, twiced baked potatoes, chard, iceberg wedges with blue cheese, some with walnuts and berries, bruschetta with fresh burrata cheese and tomatoes, and lots of onion rings. In my opinion, the NY strip and the twice baked potato are the must-haves. I'd skip the bruschetta, 'cause the house-baked bread they give you before your meal is delicious and hearty enough. \n\nAll in all, so worth facing your fear of clowns.", "author": "Sarah M."}

Maybe it's a tourist trap?\n\nFrom start to finish it was a less than mediocre experience especially considering the amount we payed.\n\nWe were a party of four with reservations pretty early in the evening. They put us in the front of the restaurant in a booth with a view of traffic and the motel across the way. Ick! The ambience was similar to a Denny's.\n\nMaybe the server was new because she seemed a little nervous which is ok but she was overly attentive and throughout the meal stood nearby polishing water glasses. It was distracting and at one point she joined in our conversation. Also, we felt rushed when the restaurant wasn't busy at all.\n\nI have to give the cocktails a B. Good selection and pretty tasty. I had the basil martini and my table companions had the mojito which I tasted and loved.\n\nWe had the combo appetizer which was a large sizzling hot skillet filled with mussels, shrimp and crab. It was mostly mussels and had a few overcooked and soaking in oil shrimps. The crab consisted of two flimsy legs. Not worth the $39.\n\nNow the bread is awesome. They bring out this mini loaf with little chopped up pieces of olive and garlic and then drizzle the whole loaf with olive oil. Pretty tasty except our loaf was a little dry like day old bread, not so fresh.\n\nI was not impressed with their steaks at all.  First, poor selection, they only have New York, Petite Filet and Porterhouse which is a combo of both.  They claim their steaks are aged 4-6 weeks. Everyone had the New York which I think was $39 per steak. The steak was very fatty and where there was meat tough and lacked flavor.  I had the Petite. First, I ordered medium and got well done.  Second go round landed me a small piece of meat looking like seared ahi tuna in the middle, raw. I didn't eat it.  For a steak house and for a $29 piece of meat I was surprised they couldn't get this basic order done right.\n\nWith those prices and quality you have to then fork over another $8 to $9 for sides which were good enough except our server over charged us two things we didn't order or get.

Very knowledgeable and truly commanding her space.  I was impressed with the food and the atmosphere -for a steak house the $100-$150 per person was definitely worth it because of the quality and experience being genuine. I was first struck by the smiles from everyone when we walked in and I got the feeling that it was a great place to be.\n\nThat being said, I did overhear a table behind me giving the hostess a very hard time for no real reason other than the fact that they knew they could...I could hear them saying they owned a restaurant and that they were going to yelp because they spent $500 and accusing her of something that she was not doing.  She was being very kind smiling and apologizing but this party was being rude for no reason.\n\nI just think that these gals have a really tough job trying to make everyone who is hungry and wants to be seated happy.  As a man who enjoys a good Steak and service, I don't like to see others who are enjoying it to, thinking that because they can pay for it, they are entitled to treat the service badly  I am yelping because I heard those people mention yelp to this little lady who was quite humble in the midst of their storm - and I don't like anyone bullying someone with technology when they have the means to spend $500 on a meal, and this poor girl is just trying to do her job well.

Their chocolate cone/caps are delicious for dessert. I think it's a dark chocolate mousse. We tend to go 1-2 times a year and it's always good!", "author": "Shannon W."}

So it definitely didn't take much for me to like this place.  It also doesn't hurt that their steak was, indeed, super delicious either!\n\nThis was recommended to us by a friend who raved about how awesome the steak he had there was.  I've been on Lombard street so many times, but honestly never really noticed Bobo's.  Only did we decided to look this place up online and saw a picture of the outside did it dawn on me that I've driven by it so many times!\n\nWe, of course, got the bone-in filet mignon and it was all it was hyped up to be.  Cooked perfectly to my desired doneness, it was super tasty.  We had the twice-baked potato and sauteed cauliflower as sides and they were good too.  \nThey have a nice bar too.  It was hopping on the night we dined there - mostly business people after work.  They were super amusing though.  There's nothing better than a bunch of business people unwinding after work, drinking and loudly cracking jokes.  I don't think I've spent so much time at dinner laughing at the random stuff people were talking about the table over.\n\nOnly thing that took some getting used to was the decor, as many other reviewers have mentioned.

The walls are a weird red and it was dim and not my style for a steakhouse. We were cramped in a little corner by the entrance (maybe since it was for two) and was not very cozy. Complimentary valet was a plus. We ordered the bone-in New York and the half crab and filet mignon which were both very good. I could not stop eating up every last scrap of the crab. When it comes to the appetizer and side let me tell you to just pass. Crab cakes (only two) for $15 was not worth it at all (i have had better) and we also ordered the twice baked potato for $9 lets just say this is only one piece of half a narrow potato and it was dry and small and very disappointing.

If you are looking for a great steak and have hit up the other places, say second helpings House of Prime Rib, you won't be disappointed. Though House of Prime Rib would be my first pick.\n\nWe celebrated a birthday there, and made reservations. Upon arriving we were promptly greeted but left to stand, well, just there. In the middle of everything. Right where servers need to exit the kitchen, right where new guests needed to enter, and right where the bar and service staff grab drinks. So it's a small entrance. Once seated, we scored a nice oversized booth, perfect for a celebratory, steak coma lounge.\n\nFood was amazing, the bone in Filet Mignon is like butter and so flavorful, and I know, you are thinking there are NO bones in filet mignon, but you'd be wrong my friend. In any case ,they serve it on the rare side, which fine by me, but it's ridiculously thick, so if you are squimish about blood and rare meat, bump up the doneness. We also enjoyed many of the apps (salads, tuna tartare and a tomato salad, all to rave reviews) and ordered 3 sides to share. Twice baked potato (tad salty), mac and cheese (too \"crispy\" that the noodles were dry) and the brussel sprouts (too rich but very tasty). For 4 of us, we barely put a dent in the 3 sides, so I'd recommend 2 sides for 4 people, but the sides are not as impressive as that buttery steak goodness!\n\nService was polite and not intrusive. Good timing and allowed us to enjoy our evening... BUT I speak servernese. Having served for 4 years in a steakhouse, and spent 8 years in the industry and trained over 1,000 national restaurant staff (FOH and BOH) I know when I'm getting the one over, eye roll from the server. Which we did. Big time. Once she asked if we had dined with them, that's when the eyeroll started. And from that point on she never redeemed herself. She was pleasant yes, but a tad cold, and lacked personality. Shame because she was pretty, and knowledgeable about the food. Though, not so much on the restaurant. I had inquired on the restaurant's history and the decorated room, we got a \"well I'm sure this room existed before the restaurant opened\" speil. Ah ok, pretty for sure. \n\nAnyways, as the evening winded down, and after coffee and dessert (I mean her eye roll was because thought we were cheap, bad tippers, or annoyed to serve us altogether) she then realized we were celebrating a birthday (aside from gifts at the table and the cheers \"it's your birthday\" toast) I guess the hostess forgot to point that out to her. I'll never know for sure what they do for birthdays, but I hope friendlier staff makes it on the list, because that would have made the dinner even better.\n\nEnjoy and knock yourself out.

This place sits in a nice trendy spot in the Marina area with plenty of bars and lounges within walking distance. \n\nI had made my reservations online and had no problem being seated when I arrived there. It was suggested to me to indulge in the the Costini Con Burrata witht the dungeness crab and smoked salmon. The appetizer was fantastic, much like a harmony of foods that melted in your mouth. Since I am not a huge wine drinker I asked the waitress for her help. She recommended a great wine to go with the went well as a starter, during the meal and during the dessert. The wine was in the 29 a bottle range.\n\nAs for my meal I had the bone in filet mignon and it was done medium. The steak is dry aged and is soooooo good. The waitress told me it was a little red towards the bone but I loved it that way. \n\nFor dessert I had the four chocolate mousse cones which where a perfect light dessert to follow a hearty meal.

Most of the people at the table had the surf and turf which looked really good, but since I couldn't partake in that kind of a feast, I went with the bone-in NY Steak.  \n\nThe waitress told us that they are one of the only restaurants that serves a bone-in filet, and I did want to try that, however, being that I was sharing the steak with a friend, I thought that the filet might have been too small.\n\nWe also ordered up some sides:  mashed yams, mac n cheese, mushrooms which were all good, but the steak was definitely the main star of the meal.  My date ordered a lobster soup that looked really good, and smelled really good, but since I am allergic to crustaceans, I couldn't try any of that either... \n\nThe atmosphere of the place reminds me a little of the Old Spaghetti Factory in downtown SJ, and it was a bit cramped in there, but then again, we're in SF, so it was a bit to be expected for me.\n\nThe ambiance of the place was pretty nice, though, reading through other reviews, I can see how people might think it feels a little creepy in there... Kind of had that Winchester Mystery House feel to it.  \n\nSo the funny story for this trip was about the group of people sitting next to us.  There was this one FOB who every once in a while would get carried away and make these loud laughs or something, and it made me laugh everytime because then he would start trying to use curse words, but it didn't come out quite right... well, at least he was trying, and he is a foreigner, so can't give him too hard a time for not knowing how to swear...", "author": "Michael C."}

I feel like Bobo's is a bit of an inbetweener steak joint, between something low-end like Black Angus to something high-end like Ruth's Chris. The lighting isn't as dim, the decor isn't as formal, and the service isn't casual but isn't snobby either. The problem, however, is that it's priced like a high-end steakhouse. Also, their steak selection isn't as varied as dedicated steakhouses. Granted they do specialize in crab as well, so that is an option. Looking back, no one in the party actually got the crab, which is kind of a regret as I would have liked to try that. Anyway, onto the food:\n\nAppetizers:\n- Crispy Crab Cakes: Pretty good, but only come in pairs of normal smallish size servings\n- Lobster Crostini: What little bits of lobster were good, but once again small.\n- Heirloom Toy Box Tomatoes: My favorite appetizer. Amazing how good well seasoned fresh vegetables can taste\n\nBread:\n- Very interesting and different. Not too heavy in butter.\n\nEntree: \n- New York Bone-in: maybe a 16oz. Pretty good.\n- Filet Mignon: Choice of regular or bone-in. It seems everyone who got the bone-in, the meat portion was slightly bigger than the non-bone version, even though they cost the same. I didn't actually try any so I can't say if there was a significant difference in taste. Apparently, the bone-in version is not always available either. Wouldn't advise getting the petite unless you really want a light meat portion, I think they said 6 oz.\n\nSides:\n- Twice Baked Potato: TINY! It's like half a potato. Taste was decent, but couldn't get over the portion size.\n- Brussels Sprouts: cooked well, and bacon makes everything taste better.\n- Macaroni and Cheese: nice and cheesy, albiet a bit plain.\n- Portebello Mushrooms: my favorite accompaniment to steak. \n\nDessert:\nWe got 3 desserts, that I can't specifically remember, but the chocolate cake one stood out as the favorite for most people. I also enjoyed the custard/flan type dessert as well. \n\nCorkage: $15/bottle - no limit that I'm aware of.\n\nParking: Free valet! Definite plus in SF.", "author": "Jonathan H."}

After reading the many positive reviews, I would have to strongly disagree that this is an exceptional steakhouse. Having eaten at several high profile steakhouses, I would not consider Bobo's to be in the same caliber. This has nothing to do with decor or service which in my opinion were also nothing special. Our party of 4 ordered the sauteed shrimp appetizer which should have been our clue re the caliber of food we would experience. I was completely astonished that the shrimp skillet arrived with what are considered small size shrimp when ordering in bulk as well as still had their shells in tact and literally saturated in butter with little flavor. We also ordered several starters and side dishes and all were lack luster at best. As for the entree's, the steaks were not cooked with any consistency among the four ordered. Only one was ordered medium rare and was literally raw at the center. What made the experience even more disappointing was the price paid for such a mediocre meal. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant unless one had no other options for dinner. The best part of the evening was the free valet parking. There are too many fabulous options in the bay area for a great steak.

Turns out, the people who had our booth were taking their sweet time before leaving, which is fine, except they (bobo's staff) could have told us instead of making us wait thinking it was their fault.\n\nNow, onto the food!\n\nTheir bread is delicious!!!! I wish they gave more. haha. I got the double shrimp and crab.  It was SO GOOD.  I've eaten the crab and stinking rose and dead fish, and for some reason, this crab was the best of all three!!!!! The shrimp was good too, but I could have easily just eaten the crab and been satisfied.  They give a lot of shrimp (normal size, not prawn size!) probably about 20 pieces and I definitely had to share... I think we had 2 pieces left over because everyone was stuffed. Everyone enjoyed their meals (most got the surf and turf which came with half crab and prime rib...) For dessert we opted for the mini cones w/ chocolate mousse (yummy, but I think I could have done without it... not anything spectacular... haha) and the blood orange sorbet... that was so-so... a little bitter for my taste.\n\nAll in all, a great meal.  The atmosphere is definitely more upscale (although, you don't have to dress that way) than stinking rose or dead fish, which makes it kind of more pleasant to eat at... Service was good (besides the hour long wait... ) - we always had our glasses filled and the server checked in on multiple occassions without us feeling like we were being bombarded... haha.\n\nI would definitely come here for any other special occassion since I wouldn't be able to afford eating here besides those times.... lol.\n\nPROS: COMPLEMENTARY VALET PARKING! Fantastic, tasty, delectable crab, decent table service.\n\nCONS: pricey, host/hostess should learn how to take care of customers if their table isn't ready.... ugh.", "author": "Roxanne K."}

A special mention on the sourdough: The garlic sourdough was surprisingly pleasant - warm and toasty - even though sourdough usually is not my thing.\n\nMussels were served on a hot iron plate with melted butter sauce on the side. You don't have to dip into butter 'cause the mussels were cooked marinated. Crab cake was impressive with noticeable amount of crab meat, not just fillers, found under the crispy skin.\n\nCrab were roasted with butter sauce that layered the outside and osmosed inside through the shell. Fillet mignon was cooked just right for medium rare.  The steak with a nice texture and flavor was served with butter sauce.\n\nI do like this restaurant - however, you have to be aware of the priciness associated with a good darn steak in this place. My last word on this restaurant is that Bobo's is NOT your everyday's restaurant if you want to keep your wallet healthy and your health in great shape.", "author": "Edmund L."}

I've come here a couple of times, each for a special occasion, and have never left disappointed (or able to fit inside my sweatpants for that matter). \n\nLocation of Bobo's feels a bit off to me. It's not a classy, old-school steakhouse along the lines of Peter Lugers, etc., but still several notches above most of the other places on Lombard in the Marina. We've come here each time in blazers and dresses, and have felt slightly overdressed each time. \n\nAlways have ordered a seafood appetizer for the table, almost all of the side dishes (especially the twice-baked potato), and the New York bone-in (I've heard the filet is also amazing, but I personally prefer quantity over everything else). Crab here is supposed to be awesome too, but I think there are other places where you can have crab that is just as good, but few places with comparable steak.\n\nLast note - the bar area is very crowded. Each time I've been, there has been a wait to sit down, and its been nearly impossible to wiggle your way to the front of the bar for a cocktail while you wait.", "author": "Nils H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-22", "description": "Went to Bobo's for a friend's birthday last night; I heard that this place had a great reputation and was eager to try it. A great perk is that they have complimentary valet parking which was perfect since it was raining. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were the first to arrive of a party of 6. We checked in and waited by the bar. The bar/waiting area was tiny; it was a backwards \"J\" shaped bar with stools surrounding and a few bar tables along the window. Between the tables and the bar seats was only about a 2-3 foot walking space; it's hard to walk by without bumping into someone. I must add in that the bartender with the Hello Kitty Tattoo was very nice, chatted a bit, but not annoyingly, and was very attentive when needed. \n\nWe sat at the bar and I ordered an unsweetened iced tea. We sat at the bar for about 30 mins waiting for the others in our party. During that time, I did a lot of observation. The plates and the table settings were very elegant. There were hooks under the bar also along the side of the bar tables for people to hang their stuff. I also noticed that the bar area felt very crowded with just 10 people in it. Before dinner I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and was directed to a door in the middle of a serving area; all the bathrooms were single rooms but had either a bench or seats for personals while using the restroom. \n\nWhen our friends arrived, we were seated up stairs. In the dining area, there were tables sectioned off by curtains. I really liked this because it gave some privacy to our party. The setting felt like an old circus tent with lots of red drapery on the walls and serving as dividers. The light was very dim. Our server met us and she was very friendly. \n\nWe started off with drinks. I still had my iced tea, my boyfriend enjoyed his Merlot, while our friends ordered cucumber cocktails and Cognac. \n\nFor appetizer, we shared the muscles, a mixed beet platter, crab cakes, and a Caesar wedge. The muscles were nicely done with a buttery dipping sauce, while the crab cakes were nice and crispy on the outside, while still being soft and moist in the inside. The beet platter was yummy, but the taste got too overbearing after a while; it was the only appetizer that wasn't devoured. I ordered the wedge expecting a salad; i guess i didn't read the menu LOL. It was like any ordinary Caesar salad. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the New York Bone In with the Double Baked Potato, my boyfriend the Porter House with Swiss Chard, our friends Porter House with Brussels Sprouts, the Fillet Mignon with Portobello Mushrooms, the Fillet Mignon Bone In with Portobello Mushrooms and the Surf and Turf with Modern Mac and Cheese. \n\nAll our food came out, but was served to the wrong people. All the people on the left received the orders for the people on the right and vice versa. We had to play \"pass the steak\" in the dark. They also brought out two Double Baked Potatoes and only one Portobello Mushroom sides. \n\nWe all enjoyed our food. My steak was cooked properly, but I wasn't too impressed with the potato; i wished i had tried the Yams instead. The Swiss Chard was cooked to a good texture, but was too salty. The Portobello Mushrooms were cooked perfectly, but i didn't appreciate how small they were chopped. The Modern Mac and Cheese looked so dry that I didn't even bother tasting it, and the Brussels Sprouts were also just OK. \n\nAlthough the sides were mediocre, we enjoyed our supper with jokes and conversation. Everyone was stuffed and we decided to skip dessert. I even got a doggy bag because i didn't over do myself =) \n\nWe split the bill amongst ourselves and went to pay, that was when i realized that we hadn't even checked the bill. We had paid for 2 Double Baked Potatoes. She had to give us a refund in cash for the mistake. \n\nWe left and i had realized that i left my doggy bag. I went back up to get it and caught them right before they were going to toss it. \n\nAll in all a great night. \n\nI did deliberate with my boyfriend in the car afterwards, I still appreciate Ruth's Chris Steakhouse much more and he still appreciates The House of Prime Rib. We don't know if we'd go here again; over rated and $$$", "author": "J-nine I."}

Humans are force-feeding them corn and then brainwashing the consumer with the notion this \"corn-fed beef\" taste is most desirable.\n\nI had not read this book before my visit to Boboquivari's.

Unfortunately I had only an hour to sip on delicious cocktails and bite on small plates in the bar area. \n       Boboquivari's cocktails deserve special attention as they  are extraordinary and tasty at the same time. Q-ball, probably my favorite, is made with local Hangar One Citron vodka, fresh cucumber, mint and lemon. The Basil, a mix of premium vodka, fresh basil, lime and touch of sugar is another piece of art. My friend, who was visiting from Russia was ecstatic about Moscow Mojito; for a moment he reminded me of a Japanese tourist as he couldn't help taking pictures of drinks and food.        \n       Almost all the appetizers we ordered were excellent, especially iron-skillet roasted mussels with garlic drawn butter and homemade creamy mozzarella buratta... Crab cakes were good as well, although I wished for a bit less of breading.

We showed up at 7pm on the dot for our reservation and were made to wait half an hour in the non-existent waiting area (the bar was full) where we were being shoved around by the wait staff and ignored by the hostesses. I don't mind waiting around at cheaper places, but when you're going to drop $50+ on dinner, I want to eat on time, or at least wait somewhere pleasant. We weren't even compensated. In contrast, the evening before I had been to Front Porch, a much cheaper place, and suffered a similar wait. However, the staff were thoughtful enough to offer us a round of mulled wine to keep us happy. No such luck at Bobo's. Just as we were about to leave the restaurant to eat somwhere else (we had to be quick as we were watching Avatar at IMAX that evening), our table was ready.\n\nSo 1* for service, but 4.5* for food. It's really good here. I got the bone in New York strip. I normally go for rib-eye but Bobo's doesn't offer that, so I thought NY strip would be the next closest. It was good, but my friend's bone-in filet was delicious. Very tender and juicy and with good flavour too. The sides were also impressive particularly the twice baked potato and the yams.\n\nThe decoration was rather odd - it was explained as \"Venetian\", and they had a CD with about 6 songs on (random stuff from the 80s) that repeated at least 3 times that we were there - totally killing the ambiance.\n\nMy favourite quote of the evening \"This place looks like it was designed by a blind man and DJ'd by a deaf man\".\n\nOverall, the steaks are really up there, but the experience was really tarnished by the very poor level of service.

We were about to leave when they told us a table was ready. They blamed the wait on large parties who would not leave but I find this totally unacceptable and a lame excuse for treating us so poorly. The only person who was cool to us the whole night was the female bartender. Our waiter had little personality and never offered an apology on behalf of the management for making us wait so long. Neither did the manager, who made eye contact with us many times but never bothered to come over to apologize. My friend had even mentioned to the hostess that it was my b-day. \n\nOnce we got seated we were still ignored while they were taking other peoples orders who were seated after us.  They definitely cater to blow-hard groups of men too. I think we were served our very crappy meal at about 10:30! My friend and I each ordered the Surf and Turf and the filet was not memorable at all and had little flavor and the crab was just bad! It was stringy, dry, and tasted horrible so I didn't even eat it after a couple of bites. I didnt know the crab was dry aged too! What a waste of money.\n\nWe chose the place in part because of the sides that my vegetarian friend could order like the Mac and Cheese and the fondue everyone raved about in the reviews. Well guess what... no fondue and no Mac and cheese anymore! They just changed the menu that day and hadn't updated it online.  \n\nWe were really shocked at how bad the service and the food were and this was on a Wednesday night! They didn't even have the decency to offer me a complimentary desert for my b-day and god knows we didn't want to give any more money to this place, we just wanted to get out of there. Other reviews said this was a local secret but seemed more like a tourist trap to me.

But I don't sit around and drool over their steaks the way I drool over Bobo's.\n\nI don't know exactly what they do to their steak.  They claim to age it for 4-6 weeks, and to have the best steak west of Peter Luger's.  A bold claim indeed.  But whatever they do works for me.  The seasoning, almost too salty, and yet, not.  The meat melts in your mouth.  S**t I'm drooling again.\n\nThe marina crowd, well, I guess I'd rather avoid them, but where else in San Francisco can you get into a huge discussion about football with 2 OTHER TABLES?

In fact, I feel bad for my future reviews because the competition just got steeper. Here's the complete run-down of my PERFECT Anniversary Dinner.\nFirst off, I have to mention free valet parking! In this city, that's priceless. We were sat immediately for our 8pm reservation in one of their cozy dining rooms. The place is small and dimly lit with kitchy decorations I thought looked cheesy in the photos, but were more comfortable in person. In fact, I felt bad for thinking I was going to get freaked out by the clowns others mentioned. Not a single clown stared me down during dinner. I actually found the decor to be charming and warm. Even the dark lighting was perfect for our intimate dinner. \nService was impeccable. Our server was Amberlee. She gave us advice on what to order throughout the meal, kept our glasses full of wine and cocktails, and gave us the perfect amount of attention without being too intrusive. She was very charming, wishing us a Happy Anniversary dinner. Even the Manager stopped by and made us feel like we were dining WITH him rather than just a customer. I had requested a table worthy of an intimate celebration. Bobo's Manager made a personal trip to our table to wish us a Happy Anniversary and to make sure we couldn't ask for more. \nWe started with a few Cocktails - The Belle  and the Q-ball. Both of us could not decide which we liked better. Then we had the Lobster Crostini which were heaven. We then had Mussels and Crab. I cannot emphasize how much my Boyfriend HATES mussels. He ended up fighting me for the majority of them, mentioning we HAD to get them the next time we come. The Skillet was just dripping with garlic and flavors I couldn't help but lick from my fingers. My mouth is watering even now. Our server brought us hot towels to wipe ourselves down for the next course. For this, we shared the Baby Romaine salad with Pancetta and Bleu Cheese dressing. Just perfect before our steaks arrived. Of COURSE I got the Bone-in Filet. No words. Really. It's the best steak you'll ever have. I didn't even use my knife. My Boyfriend had the New York - he only allowed me a single bite before he practically licked the bone clean. We shared a twice baked potato and the onion rings. Both were so packed with flavor I found myself overwhelmed with what I should take a bite of next. We had a bottle of BR COHN Olive Hill with dinner for $89!! (That's an incredible deal). Their wine list here is impeccable with prices impossible to find even directly from some of the Vineyards! Amberlee recommended the Chocolate Mousse filled Cones for desert. Just the right amount of something sweet to take us over the edge.\nI'm already planning my next visit! This is the kind of meal you save up to afford, but worth every single penny. They allow you to take your time and enjoy the entire experience. I can't wait until I have tried everything on the menu. Thank you to Bobo's for the PERFECT Anniversary Dinner! The Staff and Management along side such an incredible meal made our special day one we will be sharing with everyone we know!", "author": "Jena D."}

The decor is funky and bold, with red hues and black-topped tables. The space is a bit cramped. My crab cocktail starter was ok, however the meal was rough after that. My steak (filet on the bone) was served lukewarm and as I worked my way towards the bone I realized that the steak was undercooked (the marbleized fat was still visible). I suppose I could/should have sent it back, but I wasn't that hungry anymore. Besides being undercooked, the steak was sitting in melted butter (as Lijia also noticed).

With that being said, I was very excited. \n\nAfter our dining experience here, I have to say that our server, Erin was the best part of the meal.\n\nWe both ordered the New York, bone in. We asked for them to be a very generous Medium. Knowing that restaurants hate it when people order a steak well done. We received ours prepared very rare. I know that that on their menu it says that they cook their steaks rare for optimum flavor. But if you are going to go their and plunk down 40 bucks each for a steak, you darn well better get it the way you asked for it. The flavor was delicious and it if was cooked to how we specified, we would of probably enjoyed more of it.\n\nNeedless to say, our dog scored big last night eating our rare steak we brought home for him.\n\nThe sides we ordered: Twice Baked Potato and the Zucchini Fritti were just okay.\n\nI did like their wine menu because of the many options of 1/2 bottles they had on their menu.\n\nAfter paying $200 bucks on dinner, I can't help feel dissapointed in the meal.\nThe service provided by Erin was very friendly and attentive. \nI am not sure I will be back, I have had much better steak dinners here in sf.", "author": "Christine S."}

I don't know how it gets rated as one of the top steakhouses in SF.\n\nA group of friends and I have been hitting all the different steakhouses in the Bay Area and finally made it to Bobo's.  When we arrived, we are led up to our table on the second floor, and are put in this tiny room about the size of my friends apartment living room, with a low ceiling. The walls are covered in an Argyle tablecloth like material and have a gross mauve/tan color scheme, with the same tablecloth like material in a solid color making up a tent-like ceiling. I guess this is to give you the impression you are in a circus tent? If you are claustrophobic, this room may bum you out.\n\nThe room has a couple smallish tables that seat 4 and 4 small tables that seat 2 pushed up against the walls. There are two other tables filled when we are seated and the place is DEAD SILENT aside from the really quiet music playing in the background right by the entrance. It's immediately clear you are going to be hearing every single word anyone in the room says and vice versa. It was really awkward how silent the room was.\n\nThe tables are really too small and they have these crappy narrow glass plates to minimize the space taken up on the table top. There wasn't really enough room on the table for all our appetizers once our steaks are served.\n\nThe food arrived and I will say, the steaks were actually very good. Possibly one of the top 3 steaks of all the places we have been so far. All of our steaks were cooked perfectly and tasted excellent. The steaks definitely save this place from a 1 or 2 star review from me. The sides however left a lot to be desired. I ordered the swiss chard with garlic and olive oil and it was so ridiculously oil soaked it was just plain gross. It felt like I was taking a shot of olive oil with every mouthful of chard, and after a couple bites I had to give up. I didn't try the onion rings or deep fried zucchini, but based on the full plates at the end of service and expressions on my dining companions faces, no one else was impressed with their sides either.\n\nThe desserts we ordered were pretty tasty. Two of us ordered coffee after dinner and it was served in these totally ridiculous glasses that were hard to hold as they had these stupid \"arty\" handles. The coffee was hands down the worst coffee I have ever had at a halfway decent restaurant. Heavily watered down and flavorless.\n\nOverall, despite the steaks being great, Bobo's is probably one of my least favorite of all the steakhouses we have visited so far.

In said time before he stopped by to say \"hello\" he stopped by the table next to us 6 times.  Yes 6.  Unacceptable.  He promised us bread.  The bread arrived...after our entrees did.  Never mind keeping the buzz either because the cocktails were not flowing.  Apparently we should have ordered wine like the fat guy next to us (the guy that got 6 visits from said waiter) This guy had \"expense account\" stenciled on his forehead so clearly that's what our waiter was enamored with.  \n\nPeople - they have plastic coated menus in this place.

The meat on the bone literally was like butter in your mouth.  The waiter told us that all the meat is dry aged four to six weeks, at a constant 33 to 34 degrees, and with a constant air flow (forget the number here).  I even heard another patron tell the waiter that it was the best steak he's ever had in his life.  \n\nThe crab was delicious and good thing it was on a hot plate so that I could focus on the steak while it was warm.  After getting my share of the steak, I'd pick apart each of the legs and dip it in the garlic sauce on the plate.  My only complaint about the crab was that they removed the insides before they serve it.  If you've ever had the insides prepared like they do in Chinese restaurants, you'll understand why alot of folks consider it one of the best, if not the best, part of the crab.         Check out a place like R&G lounge for it.  \n\nSorry, I know I'm going in reverse order here but the steak was so good, I had to talk about it first.  We had the roasted mussels as an appetizer that were deliciously sauteed in olive oil and some kind of salt I couldn't help licking off the shells.  There's also a dip that has butter, olive oil, and capers that's delicious, especially for dipping w/ the tasty, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, olive bread.  Helluva meal!  I'll have to try some of the other appetizers next time like the roasted shrimp.  Drooling thinkin about it...time for dinner!\n\nDSKO favs: all the bone-in cuts, house bread, crab, mussels - it's all good!", "author": "Dik Shun K."}

We arrived on time, and the place was packed. The bar area was totally jammed, so my party of 4 was dispersed to various corners as we waited while they \"set up our table.\" They must've been \"building the table\" because it was an HOUR before we sat down, after checking in several times and being told it would be \"just a minute.\" That's with a reservation. Not to mention that the people kept pouring in for reservations that were scheduled at 15 min. intervals, meaning the crowd just continued to grow.\n\nThe service was uninvolved. The NY Strip bone-in was pretty good. Two of us ordered it, and the steaks were completely different -one was huge and thick, the other about 3/4 of an inch skinnier.\n\nThe sides pretty much blow too. There is only one potato option - a baked stuffed thing that was unremarkable. No hash browns, no mashed, no fries. And the only vegetable offered was a fried zucchini fritter. And it's not as though you're getting a bargain here and willing to overlook the traditional steakhouse offerings. It's just as pricey as Harris' or any of the others.

Bobo's (I hope it's all right that I use my pet name, but we've shared a meal together and have fond tipsy memories) is one of them places. The bread? It already comes to the table soaked with delicious butter, crispy and flaky and melty bread pieces sliced at the center like a pineapple. I don't have to dip it in oil - it's already done for me!! I just put it in my mouth and smile as it slowly moves its way into my arteries.\r\n\r\nThe crab cakes are flavorful and quite loaded with crab. The yellowtail carpaccio was an interesting idea but didn't quite deliver. I did like the dungenesse crab bruschetta, however. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint with the petit file mignon was that it was petit. I should have ordered a full order. That was some really delicious steak. It was the kind of tasty that made me feel guilty eating it. Don't you ever get that? Something is so good that you immediately in your mind start repenting for committing gluttony AND loving every second of it.\r\n\r\nFor dessert, I had the  Kir Royale - Champagne - Chambord sorbet in a waffle nest. Dear lord. I sometimes question whether or not I'm a lush because it seems like all the tasty desserts I like lately (with the exception of creme brulee, but hey if they made a creme brulee with some kind of liquer I wouldn't mind) are laden with alcohol. I'm not complaining.\r\n\r\nThe waitress was pretty nice too. Service with a smile. My dad, who has the advantage of being able to speak our \"secret\" language to us, somehow got confused and said in English, \"The waitress is pretty hot, huh?\" to my brother.

Well the crab cake's with cranberry where very very good, the onion rings are just onion rings nothing special, the twice baked potato was damm good but the bone in filet was wow freaking amazing.

We were looking soooooooo forward to eating at this steak house, however we were dissapointed.  For one, had to wait for one half hour to be seated.  Two, I ordered the petit filet and it was SO SMALL!  Myhusband ordered the porterhouse, and what a dissapointment!  He was telling all his friends how big this thing was and how it was prepared and cooked...  I was teasing him about how I didn't believe it was going to finish it... well, he ordered it, it arrived and all four of us just looked at it.  It was flat, yes it was cut in two, but did not at all look like the picture.  Very small.  I mean for $70.00!  Totally NOT worth that price for sure!\nMy petit filet looked like a mashed hamburger!  Kids meal size if that!  What I will say is the flavor of both steaks was good...  but the size and portion was a joke.  I felt like we were \"ripped off!\"  \nThe couple we were with, were happy with their steaks, bone in filet..  but with our two steaks being so small and \"not like the picture\" and expensive, it put a damper on our entire dining experience.  \nWe brought a bottle of wine and the corkage fee is $15.00.   Our waiter said we wouldn't have to pay because we had waited so long for our table.\nAll in all... would I go back again?  No.  It was OK.  Maybe I would sit at the bar and have a drink ... maybe.... \nBased on our experience here that evening for all four of us, we decided we would NOT reccomend this place.  It's OK.\nBut we were VERY dissapointed.  Money is too hard to earn these days and for a steak that is 70.00 and one that is 30.00 that looks like a kids meal....

Appetizers were all very well done and included - crab/salmon crostini, tomato salad w/ burrata, and the burrata w/ salt - all delicious!\n2. Mussels/shrimp/crab on the iron skillet - the table was pretty crowded by then, but all 3 were super tasty - and worth the buttery fingered mess.\n3. My entree - I opted for the NY strip. One of the best steaks I've every had! Will try the bone-in filet next time.\n\nWe had vegetarians in the group (4 stars instead of 5 for not even offering 1 veggie option - this is the bay area for goodness sakes), so we ordered all the sides. The onion rings and swiss chard were particularly tasty. The fluffy loaf of bread with garlic butter in the center was very (very) quickly dispatched. So good!

I found out that there are only two filet mignon's on a cow with the bone-in according to the server.  Okay you got a deal sister, just make sure you give me the filet on the left side of the cow, kay??\n\nI wasn't too sure I ended up getting the one on the left side.  I got this filet with bone-in for 39 clams.  It came out juicy, perfectly cooked not heavily seasoned.  For a meat eater it was satisfying.  Honestly though, I can't sit here and tell you I was blown away.    I've had more excitement watching Jerry Springer than eating the steak here and that show makes me ill.  \n\nI ordered a twice baked potato on the side and was expecting a fluffed up potato with all the fixin's inside of it.  What I got was a submarine looking potato that literally looked like they gutted the potato, mashed it up with chives, sour cream and butter, stuck it back in the skin, and baked it again.  Realization time; probably why they called it twice baked potato.... either way I didn't care for the concept or the end result.\n\nFor a petit filet mignon the server informed us the portion was 5 ounces.  Should've clarified that because my guests were still hungry.  I think the server meant 5 ounces before cooking because it seriously looked like 3 ounces to me (after cooking became smaller than a deck of cards).  I could just here the guests mumble under their breath \"ah shit, should've gone bigger.\"  Yes, yes ... I'm sure Katie Holmes thinks the same thing...\n\nThe bread was okay... a little olive oil, some olives and re-baked sourdough bread.  (Yawn).  \n\nWine prices were their usual 100% mark-up.  We diverted that catastrophe by bringing our own champagne and Bordeaux.  Complimentary valet was a nice touch but not enough to make me want to return.  \n\nFor the price, I think Boboquivari's is a bit on the high end when considering what you get.  For my money, Bob's on California continues to reign the steak title.", "author": "Bill P."}

I wish I could say the food made up for the way that my family and I were treated upon our arrival, but it did not. I'll begin with the experience with the hostess then move on to the food, because I believe the former should be enough for you to make up your mind about coming to this restaurant. \n\nUpon arriving on time for our reservation, we were met with the smug hostess who informed us that our table was still not ready. That was strike one. After waiting ten minutes she curtly told my mother that she and the rest of my family were in the way of the waiters, and that we needed to move. Strike 2. Then on our way up the stairs to our table that was finally prepared well past the time of our reservation, she had the gall to openly ask \"what was she looking at\" as my mother walked by, while making arm gestures that made me question whether or not she had Parkinson's. She said this not once, but four times for our entire party to hear. And there was strike 3. If I wanted to get  bossed around by some bitch with a false sense of superiority and six inch heels I would have called a dominatrix. And after seeing other reviews, its blatantly obvious that the restaurant has had complains about her before. The only possible explanation that I can see for this woman to still have her job is a flagrant case of nepotism. \n\nNow for the food (just in case for some reason you still would like to come here.) I cannot deny that the Bone-In Fillet I ordered was good. Very good. It was tender, cooked well, and seasoned perfectly. However, it wasn't the best steak I've ever had and that is exactly what it would have to be in order for me to recommend anyone to come here. For the prices, there is no doubt that you can get a steak that is just as good, if not better, and still receive great service.", "author": "Josh J."}

The way the steak is cooked, you really have to like it that way. I ordered the Porterhouse which was only 15oz. But I guess they could get away with it with all the butter it was cooked with. The initial bite was very juicy and was good. But as I continued to eat the steak, it got a bit more rich, a bit more salty, and the char was really starting to kick in. I ordered the steak with the baked yams with brown sugar. It was good the first couple of bites, but then you start to realize how much brown sugar they actually put in it. The best part of the night was probably the portobello mushrooms. The italian cheesecake was good too. Usually cheesecake for me is too rich, but it was nicely light,  but the raspberry was too sweet. Waaaay too sweet. \n\nIt started out well, it really did. The bread was magnificent, (take a little olive oil off) which was drenched in olive oil but was very crispy on the crusts. Very good. But then it went downhill, waaaay downhill. The lobster soup was real good though. Chunks of lobster at the bottom  and a hint of curry as a base.\n\nThe hostess was VERY humble and nice. I haven't been around a host or hostess who was that intriguing. But our waiter, DANIEL, was not very  friendly at all. He took our order but only came back to check on us once. He re-filled everyone else's cup of water in the room (top floor) except ours. He checked on everyone else at least twice. Not personable at all.\n\nAnd what really killed the rating, was the short, bald bus boy. He was incredibly RUDE! I haven't faced that much rudeness from someone in a restaurant since Zazil. He was incredibly pushy, trying to take our dishes out of the way while we were still scooping food off of it. Sure there wasn't much left, but there was food left. And when we would ask him something, we wouldn't be given the opportunity to finish our question. He'd interrupt \"wait a minute, wait a minute\" until he was ready to accomodate us. I guess we were an inconvenience to him. The first time I thought, that was a bit rude but understandable if he was really busy. But he did it THREE times and it was just infuriating. If I wasn't at dinner with my boss, I would've went off on him and told him to shove something where it hurts. \n\nThe food alone receives 3 1/2 stars, the hostess bumps it up to 4 stars.

I have been here 20+ times, and always ready to go back again at a moments notice.\n\nLets start with the bread, I think it speaks to the attention to quality of this restaurant. It is just delicious, i'm not recommending you fill up on this, because the food is great but definitely have some to warm up your stomach, it's warm, butter, and soft, everything you want out of good bread.\n\nI have had the bone in filet, the new york, the bone in new york, pretty much every steak they serve (except for the petite filet, for obvious reasons). You honestly cannot go wrong with a steak here. Every steak manages to taste even better than i remembered from the last time, a feat not easily accomplished by most restaurants. To live up to your  expectations and memories. A+ all the way.\n\nI used to only have steaks here for the longest time because this is a steak restaurant after all, but recently, i started trying out their seafood selection too, to my shock, it is also... great. I know i sound like a fan boy to this restaurant but everything here is just so good and flavorful. When i eat seafood here i usually go with the crab and mussel or crab and shrimp on a skillet. The mussels and shrimp are good, but it's really the crab that sets this place apart. I would highly recommend getting something with crab from the seafood menu if you are going to get seafood here. Remember to have the crab over a skillet, for reasons I don't understand, it tastes better over a skillet, maybe it's the way they prepare it as appose to when they prepare it in the surf and turf. \n\nThis place is perfect for every occasion, night out with the guys, birthdays, dinner with the girlfriend, everyone i have brought here before loves this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-22", "description": "I JUST got  back from dinner here for the first time and the food here is incredible! My boyfriend and I had gone to Peter Luger's Steakhouse in NY just last month, and we were groaning about how we couldn't find a steakhouse that compared on the West Coast. Boy were we wrong. Let me tell you about our meal!\n\nFirst, my boyfriend meticulously read all the Yelp reviews, so we came to the restaurant expecting subpar decor, delicious filet mignons, and yummy olive bread. When we walked to the restaurant, the outside looked unassuming, and the inside looked like Buca di Beppo. But all that didn't matter because as soon as we were seated, I liked how the table we were sitting at was just the right size to hold food, but it wasn't so large that I felt like I was sitting miles away from my boyfriend. We were in a small room with a large party to our right, but the corner we were sitting in managed to still shelter us from the loud noises so we could have a comfortable conversation. Our waiter was very nice and smiley, which is always a plus. I like that we were given carafes of water on our table that we could pour ourselves.\n\nNow enough about the place, let's get to the food! We ordered the olive oil loaf, the tuna carpaccio, two bone-in filet mignons (based on Yelpers' suggestions!), and two sides, one of the sweet yam, and one of the mod mac and cheese. Can I say INCREDIBLE!?\n\n1) Sourdough olive oil loaf: Four thick slices of warm bread soaked through with olive oil and covered in chopped olives. This is probably the best bread I've had in a restaurant. The flavor was unlike any I've ever tasted. The inside of the bread was soft, warm, oiled but not overly oily, tasty, and comforting. The outside was fresh and had a satisfying crunchiness.\n\n2)  Tuna carpaccio: Thinly sliced tuna, thinner than some other restaurants I've had carpaccio at. The slices were covered in minced chilies and a delectable sauce that was tasty and rich. This dish had us swooning in anticipation of the rest of the meal, we were so surprised at how good this was.\n\n3) Filet mignons (bone-in): These steaks were amazing! I ordered mine medium, since I'm normally used to medium rare but the waiter said the meat closer to the bone would be extremely bloody if I didn't order medium. My boyfriend ordered his medium rare. The steak was comparable to Peter Luger! It was so delicious because of the way it was slightly crispy/charred on the outside, and tender/juicy on the inside. The sauce had a unique/distinct flavor and it was satisfying. My boyfriend said that his steak, especially the part closest to the bone that was bloody, tasted almost like the Kobe beef at Alexanders.\n\n4) The sides: Mod Mac & Cheese and the sweet yam dish. The mac and cheese didn't have the traditional macaroni pasta, and the cheese was not your typical American cheese. This dish was so scrumptious and covered in bread crumbs. The yam dish wasn't anything special (tasted like yams) but was surprisingly well matched when eating it with the steak.\n\nI'm glad to have found such a great steakhouse. This is going to be the one steakhouse my boyfriend and I will go to a lot!", "author": "Katherine P."}

In contrast Bobo's felt like a neighborhood restaurant and had really tasty, well-seasoned dishes.  Butter was still in full effect, but wasn't used as a substitute for real cooking. Having just returned from Argentina, I thought I knew a few things about good beef.  However, I had the bone-in filet mignon and it was one of the most flavorful, tender cuts of meat I've ever had.  Ceasar salad and sides (twice-baked potato, baked yam, sauteed spinach)  were all decent , but this place is all about the meat and the huge cuts leave little room for anything else. Service was relaxed and didn't have any of the clubby, faux pretension of other stakehouses.

We open our menus, place our orders, and sip a nice merlot while awaiting our food.\n\nMy mom hates meat so she orders the double mussels and crab.  The rest of us order the bone-in filet mignon with the twice baked potato, portobello mushrooms, and crab cakes as sides.  Her seafood is first to arrive and all of us are shocked at the portion size which amounts to a 20 ' x 12' sizzling platter piled high with at least 60 mussels and 1/2 a crab!!  Immediately afterward our dry aged filets are served and the conversation ends as we arm ourselves with forks and knives to get down to business.  \n\nThe filets are delicious- with a great flavor reminiscent of a steak I had in Florence.  The mussels are a bit dry but very tasty.  The crab has an excellent flavor.  The crabcakes....wow (perfectly crispy on the outside and moist inside).  The twice baked potato seems to be a hybrid of a baked potato and mashed potatoes (yum!).  The portobello mushrooms are fresh tasting and not too salty.\n\nOverall, we got more than we had expected and are already planning our next birthday dinner!!", "author": "Russ N."}

My friends took me here for dinner this past Friday and damn was it a good dinner.\n\nBobo's is located right off Van Ness. It's on the right side right after you turn left onto Lombard, so be careful you might miss it.  We got our car valeted (complementary) and walked inside. You know, I never understood why steakhouses are always dark and look like antique shoppes, and Boboquivari's is no exception. They got this creepy carnival decor that makes you wonder if the clowns are gonna spring to life and climb off the wall.\n\nWe sat down and got our bottle of wine cracked open ($15 corkage fee) and enjoyed a fine cabernet as we looked over the menu. My friends ordered the surf and turf, which is a half crab and petite filet while I ordered the bone-in filet mignon. For sides we ordered twice baked potatoes as well as the sauteed portobello mushrooms. For starters we had crab cakes.\n\nThe waitress brought out our crab cakes and some bread. The bread had a great flavor to it, but it was wayyy too hard. It was like eating a giant crouton. Crab cakes had this cranberry relish that I think had some fried shallots in it. Very good. Not 14 dollars good though.\n\nAt last, the entrees were brought out. Prior to ordering, the waitress informed us that the steaks were dry-aged. Lovely. I've always wanted to try some dry-aged steaks. Basically the meat is left alone in a temperature controlled environment for 6 weeks and the natural enzymes and shit break down the fibers. Something like that. Shit was good though.\n\nWe all ordered our steaks medium-rare which is the only way to have a steak. When I plunged my knife into the huge piece of steak and carved out a bite size piece and placed it in my mouth, I felt this overwhelming sense of euphoria. After each bite, alternating between the mushrooms, chugging the wine, and back to steak I kept wondering if the portobello mushrooms they gave me were \"special\". The clowns really did come to life but instead I greeted them with open arms... no that didn't really happen. Basically - the steak was really good.\n\nMy friends enjoyed their crab and steak, but I can't really say if they had a psychedelic experience like I did eating their food. One felt that it wasn't enough food and the other said they were just satisfied.\n\nOverall, everything but the steak was alright. The bone-in filet that I had deserves 6 stars. So in total, 4. Next time I come here I'll just order the filet...twice.\n\nRecommendations: anything on the menu that has cow.", "author": "John B."}

The porter includes a New York, and a Filet which are cooked separately; but delivered together.  Unbelievable.  \n\nAnd I've read the comnparisons of Bobo's to more economical steak houses.  This is not a very good comparison.  That's like comparing the cost of grape juice with wine.  Bobo's steaks are dry aged, while 99% of the other steak houses wet age or non-age. A steak that's dry aged for 4-6 weeks tastes better than a wet aged steak because flavors stay intact in a dry aged setting better than a wet or non-aged setting.  More flavor, means better steak.  \n\nMy suggestion for first time goers.  \"The Bone In Filet\" .  Mark it down.  It's a lock.", "author": "Chad C."}

It looks fairly unassuming from the outside, and the inside makes you feel like you're in a quirky, swanky, circus-tent themed bar & grill, but don't let that throw you off.  Not only is this one of the best steaks I've ever had, but the appetizers and sides are delectable (get the mussels, and the twice baked potato), and when the bone-in fillet or NY arrives, you feel like you're in heaven, at least I do.  The steak's flavor is awesome, and it melts in your mouth.  Phenomenal steak.  Check out their website if you want to get a feel for how they marinate/prep their steaks...they're serious about making a seriously succulent piece of meat.  \n\nThis place is rather pricey, (especially since the sides are a la carte) but believe me, it is worth it.

I loved everything about this place from the decor-food-lighting-employees.,etc. I had the filet and it was the best steak i've ever had. It was so soft and basically melted in your mouth, I didn't even need my knife. I also had the twice baked potato which was the jumpoff. I tasted a few other sides like the modern mac-n-cheese and brussel sprouts, both were tasty and above average. We had some bottles of cabernet, very nice and decently prices. It takes about 2 hours because they don't rush but I promise it's worth the wait. My gf had the shrimp and crab combo and it was fantastic.

Filet mignon, crab and crostini were delish but the side dishes were too salty and overcooked (swiss chard, twice-baked potato & onion rings). Server started out well but completely fell off. My water glass stayed empty for 20+ minutes and it was 35-40 minutes between our appetizers and entrees. I couldn't event get our waitresses attention because we were tucked in a weird, tiny corner booth. \nOur salads came with the entrees and sides so there was no room whatsoever on the table.

I called ahead to check what the parking situation was, but I was half way thinking that I would have to find street parking of pay for vallet. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they have complimentary vallet. YES! No need to search for parking! We got there and handed over my car to the vallet and walked to the front door. I was expecting this place to be a big place, since all the steakhouses I have been to are fairly large places. When we walked into the place there was a bar and some tables hugging the window on the left side, then there was another small room that our hostesses lead us into to be seated at our table and that was it. The small little room had at most 8-10 tables only. Its crazy how small this place is, but that means that we would not have to flag any waiters or waitresses down, big plus. We ordered the house salad, Bone-in Filet cooked medium rare (chef's recommendation), twice baked potato.\n\nGarlic Loaf Bread - very warm, soft and nice texture. They drizzle extra virgin olive oil over the top of the bread. We tried it like that and it was very flavorful, but we asked for butter anyway, because Butter is awesome. I must say, I took a liking to the bread here because I couldn't stop eating it. No Atkins diet here, haha.\n\nHouse Salad - Nice light salad. They toss the EVOO vinaigrette in a separate bowl and then plate it so there is no puddle of vinaigrette at the bottom of the plate, but every piece of salad is nicely coated. Very good.\n\nTwice Baked Potato - WOW! I usually don't like baked potatoes too much, but this twice baked potato is wonderful. I suppose you can't go wrong with how they make it. They first bake the potato, then scoop out in insides of the potato, make mash potatoes, while adding zucchini, chives and fontina cheese, pop it back into the shell and bake it again. When it comes they hit it with some sour cream and chives on top. Whats not to like?\n\nBone-in filet(medium rare - no messing around, the plate arrives with the filet centered on the plate with sauce surrounding. First bite, toasted butter sauce hits my palate and it's beautiful. The next thing I realize is the silky soft filet meat. The aging process they use here to prepare their meats is first rate. It's aged 4-6 weeks in a special offsite facility. That is some good stuff. There is no way you can replicate this process at home or even at other steak places. Wow, what a combination\n\nChocolate Dunce Cap Cones - chocolate chile mouse filled mini wafer cones. So good. The chile in the chocolate mouse gives it a nice little kick. Don't worry the heat is very subtle and its more in the background and plays a great supporting role.\n\nI wanted more after the meal, not because I was hungry, but because I wanted more of the divine bone-in filet. Why is the steak so good here? Its the dry-aging process they use. They dry-age the steak for 4 to 6 weeks in a large, specialized facility under the watchful eye of a highly-skilled butcher. Wow! This place cares about their steak...a lot! \n\nThis is at the top of my list for steak.

Every birthday, celebratory dinner, anniversary dinner was at Bobo's for the past 10 years.  Anytime anyone asked me what my recommended steak place was, I undoubtedly recommended Bobo's.  After my experience last week at Bobo's, I will NEVER return to this restaurant and more importantly, I will NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone who asks me again. \n\nI recently had dinner there last week and yes, the steak was delicious as usual.  The crab and mussels were sizzling as usual.  But the service was horrendous.  Normally, Bobo's has pretty mediocre service considering the quality of their food.  We were the very last patrons sitting in the restaurant.  As expected, they immediately closed the restaurant right after we left.  After driving into our car (which was valeted immediately in front of the restaurant) for approximately 10 minutes, I discovered my camera was left in the booth, where I had set it down 5 minutes before we left.  We rushed back to the restaurant and despite them being closed already, two of the cleaning staff or kitchen staff members let us in to examine the booth and the surrounding area.  The booth was however, completely cleaned but devoid of any camera oddly.  The following 2-3 days we were given a run-around and vague answers with no one ever calling us back even though they promised to do so.  Finally, we gave up realizing that most likely someone in the Bobo's staff had taken our camera.  Four days after the incident, WE finally got hold of one of the managers who promised to call us back the very next day (which of course they did NOT.  There was an e-mail sent to us two days after saying there was no camera, shocking). \n\nI am incredibly disappointed with Bobo's.  Considering how pricey their food is, it is unacceptable with how unprofessional and downright shady their staff is.  \n\nThis is actually my first review on Yelp but I was so appalled by my experience that I had to share it so that the Yelp community is aware of what exactly they are walking to at Bobo's.", "author": "Melissa K."}

Because steakhouses are always fun.  Even if you don't eat steak.  Bobo's is no exception.  \n\nHad a little bit of trouble getting a reservation, so make sure you call well in advance.  I called three days ahead and all they had was 6:00 and 9:00.  Since I don't like eating looking out at a sea of blue hairs, we waited until 9:00 p.m.  (If you see a pack of tourists enter before you, elbow them, kick them, jump over them, just do anything to get ahead of them.  They tied up the hostess for about 5 minutes...which is 5 minutes too long when you have a reservation.  The hostess was incompetent and could not get this particular herd of felines to get the HELL out of the way.)\n\nThe booths are nice and comfy, but I was slightly creaped out by the decor.  It felt a little too much like \"The Masque of Red Death\" in there.  Anyway, on to the non plague aspect of the restaurant.  The waitress was very nice and patient.  I was still frazzled from standing behind the entire Joad family.  She must have seen my frustration because she immediately asked us if we wanted a drink.  I went for a rather sissy cocktail called the Toasted Hazelnut.  (Real men should not be drinking cocktails with \"Toasted\" in their name, but it had Frangelico in it.  Plus it was in a steakhouse, so you don't lose too many man points.)  The drink was excellent and soon my visions of ax murdering the annoying tourists were awash in Frangelico.  \n\nFor appetizers we went for the Burrata and the Crab Crostini.  The crostini was very good.  The burrata left a little to be desired.  Not enough cheeeeeese.  However the half loaf of bread that comes with your meal was like a meth/crack speedball.  Awesome.  It is absolutely soaked in olive oil and garlic.  It took all 12 steps to avoid eating the entire loaf.  \n\nMy dinner was very good.  I decided to be a complete slob and order the whole crab.  It was a mess, but worth the effort.  My girlfriend was a bit disappointed with my crab because all the guts had been removed.  She ordered the bone-in filet mignon.  (How much do you want to snicker like Beavis and Butthead whenever someone orders \"bone in\"?)  The sides were also excellent.

When it's slow, the place just feels weird.\n\nThe layout is sort of weird and I think it impacts the service.  Just tough to navigate the place and leads to some weird timing issues with food coming out and stuff.\n\nI and friends have tried a number of the steaks, my favorites have been the bone-in filet and strip.  Which have sometimes been perfect.  And other times they have just plain sucked.  So weird.  Friends have had similar experiences.\n\nI haven't tried the crab.\n\nThe sides I had were all quite good.\n\nThe chocolate mousse filled \"dunce cones\" are delicious and a really great dessert.\n\nIf this place were like my best visits there, it would be up there with Harris' as my top steak place.

Even though we were the *only* guests in the restaurant at 17:00, service wasn't very attentive.  \n\nOrdered a bottle of wine, and the waiter dripped wine on the table.  Anywhere else, I would have been like whatever.  But when you're paying a lot of money to eat at a place like this, the least the waiter could do is have a wiping cloth ready when pouring wine.\n\nTo start, I ordered a baby romaine wedge salad (7$) with apples, walnuts, and sundried cranberries in a raspberry vinaigrette.  It was super delicious.  See photo.\n\nFor the main meal, I had the Surf & Turf (39$), which was half a crab and petit filet mignon.  The crab was super tasty, especially with the garlic sauce; my only complaint was that it took so long to eat (I'm a n00b crab eater) that it was kind of cold by the time I got to the end of the crab.  The filet mignon was also equally delicious.  See photo.\n\nFor the side, I had the portobello mushrooms (8$).  These were also really good and prepared quite tastily.  See photo.\n\nMy friend ordered the twice baked potato as his side.  When it came out, it was actually cold.  He summoned the waiter and had him take it back; the waiter didn't even apologize.  When the second potato came out, it was definitely warm and quite tasty.  By this time, another group had shown up, and we actually watched as one guy from that group also sent the potato back and received a new potato.\n\nBottom line: tasty expensive food with poor service.", "author": "emilie k."}

Made it at the restaurant around 8:15 PM, the host was talking to some tourists who walked in & was told that the next table available will be at 10 PM or they can come back tomorrow. Mr looked at me & asked, did we make reservation?  My reply \"of course babe, also booked it at opentable.com w/c means 100 pts towards our dining credit.\" ^_^ \n\nOur host greeted us and was told to wait by the bar while they prep our table w/c by the way I requested to have a booth facing Lombard St. Right on time, @ 8:30 we were seated immediately, our waiter greeted us. Offered us the bread yummy but not complimentary. Got a half bottle of La Crema 2003 Pinot Noir, since we already had wine at the gallery. It was just right wine for our steak.\n\nMr ordered FILET MIGNON BONE-IN, medium rare w/c totally melts in your mouth, crispy on the outside & very tender on the inside, Perfect! Side order: SAUTED SPINACH & MOD MAC (MODERN MACARONI & CHEESE) Like the Spinach but not too crazy about Mod Mac.\n\nI ordered HALF CRAB & PETIT FILET MIGNON, medium rare (YUMMY) & SAUTED PORTOBELLO MUSHROOMS like the Portobello but wish that they didn't add vinegar on the sauce.\n\nMr & I like the Decor, it's different and not pretentious like the other steak houses. I find the establishment to have character besides we were there to enjoy the great filet mignon bone in together. Did I mention its aged dry, you can tell the difference.\n\nGave it a 5 star coz, steak were perfect, service were awesome & good comparable price, were definitely coming back. Mr love me even more, coz sometimes boyfriend needs to be taken care of too. As far as dessert, we didn't get any, we were so full besides he can have me for dessert *wink*", "author": "jubi l."}

With a name like Bobo's, a jester as the mascot, the color red splashed over you might think ..\"what the #@$%\" .. but you will be amazed. That reminds me - if on a date - get the girl to wear Red. \n\nThe gastronomic experience commenced with the \"Garlic Baked Sourdough Olive Loaf\".  The baker had my attention already.  \nI was so ready for the bone-in filet mignon. My jaw dropped on learning that they ran out of their most popular cut. Apparently, they were out of the same only once before in FY07 (provided their year starts in July) :)  In hindsight - one suggestion - call ahead and find out if they have it available. (geez, who would do that ?). \n\nWithout a formal backup plan, I requested Jonathan (who gave us just the right amount of attention), to suggest a flavor on the same lines as the MIA bone-in filet. My only hope -  considering they are all dry aged, the disappointment could be contained.\n\nI went with the  \"New York Bone - In\". The dry aged classic arrived  medium rare, pan seared and with a garlic buttered top . One bite and I knew that the food gods were on my side.  The twice baked potato and Kenwood cabernet was just about the perfect bridesmaids. For those who tread the white wines - Bobo's doesn't offer a Reisling. (Though I think that's probably with due diligence for a steakhouse. )\nThe grand finale was when the baker nailed the night  with the chocolate moussed cones. I wanted to do a cartwheel.\n\nFor those who like to know where they are eating - the same trio of restaurateurs'  who run the Stinking Rose, The Crab House, The Franciscan, The dead Fish,  and Calzone's also run the show here.", "author": "Ajay J."}

My hubby and two friends all ordered it and absolutely loved it! I ordered the Hawaiian Sunfish and that was pretty damn good too... But don't order it if you don't like seaweed, cuz all the flavor seems to be in the seaweed that is topped on the fish. We also ordered a whole crab, which was just ok. The appetizers (crab cakes and the tuna carpaccio) were average to good. The lobster soup was good, but you have to be ok with curry, cuz it has some of that in it. The sides of Swiss chard and the onion rings were also good. Total bill for all this plus the YUMMY espresso martinis and couple other drinks came to about $350 including tip. \n\nService was good.

Everything at Bobo's is done with a unique twist from the way they cook their steaks and the dry aging, the addition of capers to the traditional side of mushrooms, to the salads all being done in a \"wedge style\".  \nWe tried the bone in filet, and it was as good as it gets.  I haven't had a better steak in SF! We loved their mushrooms with the capers in the sauce.  They make a great companion to the steaks.  They have a nice, well rounded red wine list.  We brought our own bottle of wine as their $15 corkage fee is reasonable.  The salad was fair, but the chocolate cups for dessert were excellent.  They too are unique with a bit of ancho chili powder in the chocolate.  \nThe room is unique, and interesting to look at.  There's so much red on the walls that we couldn't take a good picture at the table.  Iif you want a photo of the night, you might want to have the valet take a shapshot of your group before he parks your car.  The rooms are small and the tables are very close.

I go about once a year - the bone in filet always sucks me in - but each time that I do, I ask myself: \"why?\"  Let's start with the positives, the bone in filet is an exceptional steak.  The yellowtail in ponzu is good.  But then it ends.  The lobster soup was Dr. Seuss time - green glue.  Perhaps something for the Incredible Hulk?  The twice baked potatos were the worst I have ever had.  Whacked out production with zuchinni and glue like consistency.  Last time I checked, bacon, cheese and some buttermilk are just fine for twice baked.  These can only be eaten if done after the green glop soup.  By comparison, you will trick yourself into the belief that the twice baked are good.  I wish someone in town would do a bone in filet so I can avoid my annual disappointment.", "author": "Lena D."}

Of my laundry list of carniverous favorites, a choice piece of steak will always be at the top.  I've sampled steak in 15 states and 10 countries and I can safely say the bone-in filet at Bobo's is the best of'm all.\n\nTo give you an idea of my steak preferences, I am a big fan of Harris' Kobe ribeye and both the double filet and cajun ribeye at Morton's.  House of Prime Rib is alright (I'm not big on prime rib - personal preference) and I don't much care for Ruth Chris.  I especially dislike Izzy's.  It pains me to even type the name of that awful place.\n\nThat being said, I was extremely upset at myself for not having discovered Bobo's earlier in life.  The bone-in filet is the only thing that should be ordered and it should only be ordered medium-rare or below.  If you want a discertation on the specifics of the 4-6 week, off-premises, dry-aging process your waiter or waitress will happily provide it.  If you want to hear about the benefits of the process, just ask anyone who's dined there.  The meat melts like butter in your mouth and packs more flavor than a ball of five-spice.  It's truly a religious experience for steak-lovers.\n\nThe appetizers are pretty tasty as well.  The sizzling iron-skillet roasted starters are great for sharing but keep in mind your clothes will likely have a skillet scent to'm at the end of the night.\n\nWhile the decor is a bit cheesy, the waitstaff is attentive and very accommodating.  Last time I was there, we ran up a big tab and stayed a bit past closing time and they were still gracious enough to serve us complimentary limconcello aperitifs.\n\nThe good:\nUnforgettable steak for under $40, easier to get reservations than at the Big Four (Harris, Ruth, Morton, House), lots of appetizer choices\n\nThe bad:\nNo free bread - only a problem if you ask for it and it \"unexpectedly\" shows up on your bill, the decor - almost feels like they'll kill the lights, throw some music on and host a burlesque show after midnight.\n\n[edit] On my second visit here, the service was a solid D.  The waitress was unfriendly and it seemed like serving our table was the last thing she wanted to do in the world.  Based off my two visits, I'd say the food is always excellent but the service is hit or miss.\n\nThe notable:\nOne of only a handful of places in the country that dry-ages more than 21 days.\n\nThe Junius pick:\nFilet mignon, bone-in.  The menu says \"when available\" so call in and make sure it is to avoid disappointment.\n\nThe person you're dating:\nShould be brought here if and only if he/she likes steak.  Nothing worse than watching an incredible pieace of beef go to waste on a less discerning palate.\n\nThe significant other/spouse:\nShould probably be brought here under the same conditions mentioned above.  Then again, if you love steak and he/she's already locked in to the relationship, there's nothing wrong with the occasional selfish dinner.\n\nThe last time I was there:\nOctober 3, 2006\n\nThe number of times I've been there:\n2", "author": "Junius H."}

Note, I am a vegetarian (but not the crazy meat-eater hating type), so my review comes from that standpoint.\n\nLocation: A bit far out for most people, but still central enough to not be hassle. Unfortunately there's no night scene and not really much to do around that area, which is half a star minus for me. Where am I supposed to stumble into after I get liquored up with those fabulous espresso martinis? \n\nSpace: Nicely decorated, classy. I am really into the lighting there. There's also seating by the window, so that you may enjoy the beautiful sea of cars racing down Van Ness street. Also, the bar is quite beautiful; Modern, yet classic, with trippy green little lights.\n\nAmbiance: Quite a variety of people. I thought it would be mostly business types, but that's San Francisco for ya: You should never expect to get what you expected. There were young people, old people, latinos, asians, the works. Quite diverse and no one was annoying or awkward.\n\nService: The service was absolutely fabulous! The house manager checked in on us the entire time and even entertained with his glibly comic demeanor. All the waiters were professional and diverse. They liked us so much that they even brought over a complimentary dessert!\n\nFood/Drink: Again, I'm a vegetarian, so what was I doing at a steakhouse? The alcohol, sweetie, the alcohol. They have the most fabulous drinks, specially their Espresso Martini. The drinks here are a work of art, truly down to the very last detail. There was unfortunately not too much vegetarian variety, so if you're a vegetarian and hungry DO NOT come here. I had the onion rings and a walnut, cranberry salad; Both of which were perfection to the core. The lack of vegetarian items for me is another minus half a star--Yes, even if it IS a steakhouse.

I do have to say the wait staff was very nice and courteous but the food was BLEH!!! My best friend took me here for my birthday dinner.  I was extremely excited to go because I have never been and have heard great things about this place.  Upon our arrival, the hostess said that our table was not ready yet so we decided to have a drink at the bar.  Moments after we were seated, we were told that our request of being seated upstairs has opened up and if we would like to move....heck yeah!!! Things were looking up until our appetizers arrived....if you could even call them that.  We ordered the yellowtail carpacio and lobster costini.  The yellowtail was submerged in a concoction of oil and spices, you could not even tell there is tuna on the plate.  When I scraped up the tuna, it looks like BEIGE flakes of mystery stuff....not cute.  Then we moved on to the lobster crostini which was SALTY!!!!!!  The only good thing about that dish was the burrata that came with it.  They had the bone in Filet that night so we both ordered it medium rare.  We also ordered two sides, the mushrooms and the swiss chard.  The swiss chard tasted like five lemons were squeezed in to it and the mushrooms were mushy.  We decided to cut in to our steaks and boy....was it disappointing!  The meat was completely RARE inside with a slight char on the outside with an EXTREMELY salty crust.  The meat itself have no flavor except for the saltiness of the crust outside.  They did comp us dessert which was good and the bottle of wine we had with dinner was excellent.

Finally, I had a taker!  Now where to go?  We thought about Izzy's but the last time I went there me and my steak were cold because the door was left open, and the \"peanuts on the ground\" feel wasn't really hitting close to home.  I've never been to Boboquivari's before but have driven by countless times and I heard good things about their steak. So I called and made an 8:15 pm reservation for two with no problem at all. Free valet in the front for diners and we walked right in at 8:15 and seated immediately.  The place is a bit dark and reminds me of a 1920s establishment - dark, red, table for two a little tight, but not terrible.  \n\nWe were hungry girls and ordered mussels for an appetizer and I ordered the regular filet mignon (10 oz.).  SG ordered the petite filet (5 oz.) with half crab. We shared two sides - sauteed swiss chard and portabello mushrooms.  The waitress helped SG pick a glass of red to go with her meal.  The menu states that the meats are cooked to medium rare for maximum flavor, so if you like your meat done or rare, be sure to say something early.  \n\nA loaf of bread was brought out - it looked impressive but didnt taste that great and looked warm but wasn't.  The mussels came on a sizzling cask iron pan and served with warm garlic lemon butter.  These were delicious with or without the butter.  I would order again! Although a bit small, there were quite a few of them, each one plump and succulent.  \n\nWe came here for the steak and my filet mignon was done to the perfect temperature.  The beef was flavorful, could have done with a little more salt, but mind you, I'm getting over a cold and I couldn't taste too much until this day anyway.  SG's half crab was an ample portion and she gave me one of the legs that were roasted in garlic.  More butter was served with the crab. Her 5 oz petite filet was quite petite, but a good portion considering the size of the half crab.  The swiss chard was sauteed nicely, not overcooked and gave me inspiration to make it at home.  We felt the portabello's were to cut up and stemmy.  We could have done without the stems, and i tend to prefer my portabellos in whole caps or thick strips with no stems.\n\nThe service was pretty good, the shining stars were the attentive servers who brought our food out.  They didn't just bring our food out, they wanted to make sure we had everything we needed.  Super!  \n\nThe place is a little dark, and a table for two is a little crowded, so my preference would be to come here with couple more friends and sit around and hang out.

I had fairly low expectations because I hadn't heard that much about it, and what I did hear was more about the atmosphere and how kitschy it was. I figured that was probably OK since our usual problem is that we like nice places, we like steak, but when this particular group hangs, we are severely inappropriate and totally obnoxious. But my gawd after the steak I had I will totally go back to Bobo's, kitschy Barnum & Bailey decor and all.\n\nI agree whole-heartedly with everyone else - the bone-in filet is incredible. Perfectly seasoned and perfectly rare - and wtf is with a bone-in filet anyway? I'd never heard of one but now it is my new best friend. Don't even bother with anything else on the menu.\n\nMy one complaint is that the salads are WEAK. A \"wedge\" is not 4 leaves of lettuce piled on top of each other with a drizzle of dressing. And it's certainly not worth $7 if that's all you're going to give me. \n\nThe meal, with wine, salad, entree, and dessert can get pretty pricey, but I woke up and wanted the bone-in for breakfast. OK, that didn't sound right...\n\nOne more thing...if you're thinking of having cocktails before dinner, I'd suggest someplace else - the bar is really, really small and doesn't feel very cozy...", "author": "Kate S."}

The staff is always on the ball, the waiters are attentive without being overbearing, and The Steak is definitely the best here. I always pick the Filet Mignon, and this cut here is like butter that melts under your knife. If you want more flavor, they also have this cut available \"bone-in\", and it is delicious. Their sides are not spectacular, but always tasty and well-presented. The heirloom tomato/mozzarella/avocado salad is to die for, and I find that in general their salads are always winners. In most steakhouses I always have to add salt to the steak to add flavor, and eat a starch alongside.

I made a dinner reservation for 8pm but called to let them know we were running late. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating since it was Sunday night and they probably weren't very busy. We get there around 8:30pm and only had to wait a few minutes before getting seated at a booth right next to a window. The decor is done in reds and reminds me a bit of a dark circus with the multicolored lights. The booths are back to back so you can easily overhear other people's conversations if they forget to use their indoor voices. That was the case with this drunk lady in her 40's and her 60+ year old husband at the next booth. \n\nWe started off with the Yellowtail carpaccio appetizer. I could have eaten 3 more plates of that on my own! The fish melted in my mouth and the balsamic vinegar and fresh chopped peppers they added were very complimentary! Next came our mains. I got the petite filet mignon with a side of yams. Chris got the surf and turf which came with crab and a petite filet. The meat was so soft and tender that I almost didn't need a knife to cut it. We both ordered it medium rare which is the only way to eat this kind of quality meat. My first bite was so flavorful and the combination of the yams provided for a sweet and savory treat in my mouth! The crab on Chris' dish looked really good, but was a bit salty for my taste. Besides, you can go to Chinatown and buy your own live crab and prepare it to your liking for a fraction of the price. Since we were already running late to meet some friends for drinks we didn't have time for dessert.\n\nOverall, the steak was excellent and the service was top notch.

I also tried some of my boyfriend's bone-in filet which, although a little juicier than a regular filet, is good, but not mindblowing or anything.

I wasn't a big fan of the sides... the twice baked potato just seemed cheesy, the yams were very sweet, and the chard was just okay.

We looked over yelp for twenty minutes or so, and decided that Boboquivari's sounded like an interesting choice. Noting from previous reviewers that we needed to get the 'bone on' option, we jumped in the car and headed over to the Marina (a good lengthed drive from Bernal Heights).\n\nThe first great thing about this restaurant we found out was the valet parking. We drove around the block initially looking for parking but there was absolutely nothing, so we came to the restaurant expecting to ask someone, when we saw the 'free valet' sign. Excellent!\n\nWalking into Boboquivari's is an experience in itself. It is styled with a Mediterranean circus theme, and done well. It was exciting place to be, and pretty romantic. We initially were seated in the entrance room booth area, but the seats were low compared to the table, and it wasn't very comfortable. So we asked to move to the other room, which is MUCH better. The room on the right has a far more relaxed and romantic ambiance, and proper chair-table format. If you're going on date night, reserve a table there.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and had well thought out responses to everything we asked. We ended up ordering the tuna carpaccio and crabcakes to start, and then two bone-in mignons for main, with the sweet potato and spinach sides. Our starters were delicious - excellently sized and well flavored and presented. It looked almost haute cuisine. One major big-up is their house bread -- clearly baked on the premises, unusually flavored and absolutely brilliant. To be honest, just asking for bread as an appetizer will leave you feeling pleased. By the time the main course arrived, I'd almost forgotten about my need for steak!\n\nThe steak itself was wonderful. I'm a huge carnivore with a love of red meat, so quite the specialist here. They got the medium-rare just right. Juicy, warm and rather red against the bone. Delicious! The steak was A-grade, melt-in-your-mouth quality, and the side dishes we selected were a great complement. Overall - fabulous.\n\nHowever, when the bill came, we were slighted startled. We had chosen this place partially for its '$$$' rather than '$$$$' listing. Personally I would give it '$$$$' (it is definitely over $60 per person). The bill for two came to $289, before tip. So, either be a little more careful with your choices here, or save this place for a really special night out!", "author": "Sarah F."}

The sides are amazing as well; the twice-baked potato in particular is a great complement to any of the steaks.  I've had the porterhouse (cooked separately to ensure that both chops are done to perfection...essentially a small filet and a NY), and the bone-in filet.  I don't get the hype around the bone-in; all of their cuts are dry-aged to perfection and the bone-in wasn't an order of magnitude better as everyone seems to proclaim (both were amazing though).\n\nWent there with a big group and the service was great.  We took over one of the rooms on the second floor and the waiter was very friendly and meshed well with the group.  He also decanted an imperial (6L) of BV George de Latour for us.  We were able to strike a deal with mgmt for the corkage, although they did try to pull the \"corkage is for each 750 ml bottle\" trick (it ISN'T!  Corkage is to cover the overhead of serving wine, cleaning glasses, etc...not to make up for lost revenue.  It isn't 8 times harder to open a 6L as it is to open 8 750 ml bottles...it's slightly harder but not linear with size.  Call it diminishing marginal effort (logarithmic perhaps?).  Either way, restaurants could bring wine prices down from the stratosphere and people will stop bringing their own bottles!...But I digress....\n\nDespite the corkage diatribe (that is common to all restaurants, and just happened to surface in this review...), I give a top rating for Bobo's and I can't wait to return.", "author": "Nate H."}

Wonderful because, well, it's $100 gift card. But terrible because you can indulge in many more things that you might not normally if you actually cared what the bill total came to. We started wtih several appetizers our favorite two being the crab cakes and burretta. Burretta I love pretty much anywhere, but it was fantastic here we got the plain but I can't wait till next time to try it with a few different combo's. I wasn't expecting the crab cakes to be anything really exceptional, I like crab cakes in any normal setting, but these were the best crab cakes we've ever tasted we were considering ordering another round of them they were so dang good. The cranberries on the side was a great unique addition to the already very tasty fresh crab. The wedge salad was good.. but honestly too much dressing. I am a huge blue cheese fan so I felt odd not loving it, but it really isn't your typical wedge, it's a few long leaves of baby romaine and then a very large portion of dressing. It would have been great if i just had more lettuce to spread the dressing around. That said, it was an extremely rich and flavorful blue cheese, just overpowering with the lack of lettuce. We also got the lobster soup - good, but the curry made it a little stronger and different than I'd hoped, not so much of a lobster bisque as in creamy yummyness, the curry just gave it a zing that i didn't really want or need.  \nNow onto the main event - the steaks! Well the hubby splurged and got the porterhouse. Um... is it common knowledge that a porterhouse is actually 2 full on steaks? We are big meat eaters, bbq, shop for beef ourselves, and have visited quite a few steak houses in our lives and I felt very silly not knowing that was what a porterhouse was, as did he. So we were a little surprised to see the full on NY and the filet mignon presented to him when the entree'scame out. At first we thought perhaps we ordered wrong. I got the surf and turf. The steaks were absolutely delicous. So tender, just the right amount of fatty goodness without seeming fatty. I wasn't a big fanof the crab. I love crab so i didn't dislike it by anymeans - but I just guess I prefer it without all the extra herbs and flavoring. I let the hubbs finish the crab and i stole a few pieces of his steak instead since he had an abundance.\nSome of the desserts sounded ok, but after our meal we were totally stuffed and decided to skip dessert and walk home to try to walk off some of the delicous calorie packed meal.", "author": "Audrey V."}

It was so good, we were speechless for a few minutes while our eyes rolled into the back of our heads.  ...On the other hand, don't ever get the 1/2 crab, 1/2 petit filet surf and turf.  That was absolutely disappointing.  Crab was dry, the filet was merely passable.  Definately the worst dish i've ever had there. **\n\nThe steaks are fantastic.  I LOVE steak and am a very discriminating steak eater.  \n\nMy favorite cut is the ribeye because of the texture, flavor, and marbling.  While Bobo's does not offer ribeye, I've had the filet mignon and the porterhouse, both times still being excellent.  I don't always love a filet mignon, as its a bit too lean for my tastes.  However, bobo's consistently does a fantastic job with the way they prepare the steaks.  I like mine rare, and they have not screwed it up yet.  And the flavor.  Love that rich browned butter flavor.  Velvety, melt in your mouth quality, with the perfect char on the crust.

I recommend sitting in the room upstairs, as you can get a decent view of the city.  The wine list is good - mostly California, but they still do have a good variety.  The setting is higher-end but not too fancy, and the prices are about what you would expect from a specialty/fine dining experience.\n\nI first stopped in for dinner with a group of work colleagues and had a great experience.

As soon as you walk into the place the wall decorations and colors bravely informs you that you are not in an ordinary restaurant and that you are about to experience something completely different taking you out of your comfort zone.  At least that was my impression upon my first visit to this delectably funky place,  with its sumptuously simple fare, and a fun and energetic wait staff.\n\nThe menu doesn't have a large selection of beef cuts, but it does cover the \"trinity\" of the sacred cow cuts i.e., fillet mignon, New York strip, and porterhouse.  Over the past three years, I've directly or indirectly tried each cut and found the cuts to be generously portioned, and seasoned appropriately highlighting and not overpowering the fine quality of the beef.  A unique characteristic that I've had to make an adjustment to is the manner in which they serve a boneless porterhouse steak.  I'm not sure why it is served this way, and to see a sirloin strip and a fillet not connect by a thick and darken T-bone denies me of a very appetizing visual.  None the less, I still enjoy the contrasting textures and flavors between the toothy sirloin strip and the melt-in-your mouth filet.......ahhhhh beef heaven.\nAnd so to move on, the dining experience is more than just about the steak of course.\nThe appetizers will certainly appease any palate served in the right portion size so as not satiate to early into the menu.  I especially enjoy the mussels, clams, crabs broiled atop a stone slab  seasoned with wine, garlic and herbs brought to the table sizzling and steaming along with bread for sopping up the infused juices.\nThe sides are a unique addition to the entree, tastefully and simply prepared, and as it is served on its own dish it adds a family style dining experience.  I typically don't order desserts and if I do it is usually a refreshing sorbet, but we've tasted their dessert menu and attest that it is a light, sweet and pleasant finish to an excellent meal.\nThis steakhouse rates highly in the categories of wait staff, mixologists, culinary presentation and preparation of steaks and sides, while at the same time successfully being something different.  A typical steakhouse feels stiffed collard, and looks staunchly male, and it is refreshing to see and feel a new look.  As selfish as it sounds, I know it will be an impossibility to keep this place a secret.  So I'll just concede to tell it like it is so that you can experience the fine dining experience of Bobos.", "author": "Oscar M."}

They do a nice sizzling crab platter to start which is nice to split with your friends, add some shrimp if you want, but don't worry this is just filler before the main event.  \n\nThe Bone in Fillet is by far the best steak I've ever had.  If I am going out to dinner, I'd almost never choose to go to a steakhouse, I find it boring.  Sometimes the meat is really good and that makes it worth while, and sometimes it's even better.  This is the tastiest meat you will ever find, and it gets better and better as you get to the bone.  When you get to the bone, the meat tastes like butter.  It makes you want to cry. Truely unbelievable!  I'm talking full on weeping folks.\n\nI can go on and on about this beef, but I think it's best summed by a line a fully grown 50 year man from Chicago said, \"This is the best steak I've ever had.\"  Do they know their steak in the midwest?

I was actually introduced to your restaurant via a business meeting and have continued to be a patron ever since.  My experience in the past has been excellent.  Good food and great service.  I have tried many steakhouses around the Bay Area including the highly touted Alexanders in Cupertino, Bobs on Montgomery, EPIC, Mortons, etc.. and still find myself coming back to Bobos.\n \nYesterday however was one of my worst dining experiences.\n \nLet me preface the occasion before i explain the experience.\n \nThe event was for two occasions, a birthday and entertaining guests on vacation from Sweden.  I made reservations for 12 at 8pm on Monday.  I was excited for my guests.\n \nWe arrived half an hour early with several people missing.  So, we crowded the bar with several of us ordering drinks.  The bar tab was a bit confusing for (stand in managers name), who i believe was the stand in manager for the night. Three different tabs total.  However, when (stand in mgrs name) was making the drinks, i believe she was a bit frustrated with the confusion of what was on which tab, understandable.  However, she made a comment to another, whom I believe was another server, in which she stated to something of the effect of, \"I must have bad karma\".  I overhead it, and thought nothing of it.  Still not necessary.  This was a foreshadow of what was to come.\n \nWhen all the guests arrived, we sat and ordered.  Jessica did a wonderful job and was very friendly.  It wasn't until we received our steaks.  I ordered medium well and the birthday person ordered medium.  Both steaks were dry and well done.  So, I explained to Jessica that they were cooked well.  She took my steak back for the chef, and it was returned with the chefs reply that they were well done.  Jessica offered for me to see the manager, but i declined.  I told Jessica that it was fine, but after some convincing by people at the table i decided to talk to the manager on duty. \n \nThis is were i felt i was treated very poorly.  Typically, restaurants who maintain good quality and service would not even question the customer and just fix the problem. The manager came to the table, and to my surprise it was the bartender (Stand in Managers name).  Excuse the spelling.  She asked me what was wrong, in which i stated the the NY was well done.  She looked at it and told me that it was medium well and that she has known the chef for a very long time.  So i was questioned in front of my guests.  (Stand in mgr)  further stated that the we always suggest medium or medium rare for our cuts.  I was never told this.  She then asked me \"what is it that you want'.  I expected her to find the answer.  I wasn't sure what to say since most places find the solution for you. She further stated \"well i will do whatever you want\".  She then extended an offer which had a rude tone to it.  She stated, \"you know what you can keep those steaks, Porterhouse, and I will BUY you a new fillet\".  I was actually offended, I dont need favors and i dont need anyone to buy me anything.  However, I told (stand in mngr)  fine, not sure what else to say.  She left, but the Swedish guests told me that they were scared of her.  The birthday guest didn't even want to ask to fix his steak because of the responses I was getting.  I didn't even touch the filet or finish the NY.\n \nAttached is the picture at the restaurant, of the NY.\n \nI'm not sure what Bobo's policy is on this quality and service, but my expectation was to have the decency to take it away and fix the problem, not to question and continue to question the patron.  I rarely complain, but being that i have been here many times with colleagues and friends that this was not the same quality and service i have received previously.\n \nI was actually a bit embarrassed in selecting this place for my guests. \n \nBest Regards,\n \nAndrew", "author": "Andrew J."}

Naturally, we were excited and looking forward to the experience.  Imagine the let down when we pulled up to the entrance to the Travel Lodge and a dumpy looking building to the left.  Okay, you cannot judge a book by its cover. . . .\n\nWe waited outside, along with two other parties, while the hostess got her act together.  We were led up a narrow, dirty carpeted staircase lined with appallingly ugly, dusty looking memorabilia. to our table with a view (a motel across the way)  and crammed into a claustrophobic booth (we did like the privacy).  The restaurant is badly in need of a thorough cleaning and an upgrade to the decor.\n\nThe food:  We ordered onion rings (Mel's dinner better), petit filet mignon and the bone in  filet mignon, their signature dish.  Starting with presentation, if it means anything to you, well, the small portion of meat sat alone in the middle of the plate without any attempt to present it attractively.  There was no garnish whatsoever to break the austerity of the presentation.  I have to say the meat was cooked to perfection, medium rare, as requested, however, it was flavored by what I would describe as a mild stilton cheese which would be fine, but should have been offered as a side, if one prefers the actual flavor of the meat, which I do.   Even though they are famous for their steaks, we have had superb and much better steaks at Lark Creek, Ruth Chris and, of course,  Mastro's.   The side orders were extremely small and absolutely unremarkable.  The mac and cheese only rival would be Kraft's., we did not finish it.   The Brussel sprouts were okay.  Much too pricey for a mediocre meal. \n\nOur server, though competent, was cool, aloof and somewhat snobbish.  We had difficulty getting water when needed.\n\nNow, all this aside, we had a wonderful time because of the people we were with.  We will go out with them again and again, but not to Boboquivaris.", "author": "Laura G."}

The restaurant has a cozy decor - lots of red, lots of color, very fun. Our waitress was fantastic. She had really great recommendations being that this was our first time eating there. \n\nWe started off with the Costini Con Burrata w/heirloom tomatoes. This was really good, very refreshing. We both got the house special - the bone-in filet mignon, and 2 sides the portebello mushrooms and the onion rings. The filet was super tasty, so tender and it just melted in my mouth! The onion rings were nothing spectacular - but the mushrooms were extremely salty. We told our waitress this, and she got another one made....only that was extremely salty as well. She took it back, and I asked for the swiss chard instead. This was very tangy - but at least it was not heart attack salty! We were super stuffed at the end so we decided for no dessert...but the waitress brought my bf a birthday surprise! A mousse cone with a candle! That was really delicious! I was surprised that they actually remembered and made a note of that in their system. I think I had just mentioned it when I made the reservations. Very cool!\n\nService here was phenomenal. I esp. appreciated that they kept taking back the salty mushrooms and tried to fix our order. Water was always filled, and the warm bread was delicious. We also ordered 2 of their drinks: The Dream and The Blueberry Margarita. My favorite was the dream : delicious - sweet yet strong! Overall summery of the evening: meat was delicious, both times the mushrooms was extremely salty, but the service was terrific.", "author": "Betty S."}

We ordered the shrimp as an appetizer and they were SO good! They came on this sizzling skillet with this garlicky butter sauce. For our main course, I got the bone in New York strip with the twice baked potato. The steak was amazing and cooked to perfection! The potato on the other hand was kind gross. Whatever cheese they put in it, maybe some kind of bleu cheese, gave it a pungent smell and flavor that I didn't like. My boyfriend got the whole dungeness crab and cauliflower as a side.

SMH we readjust everything so that it's all easy access for both of us. one steak, one half of a twice baked potato, two halves of an ugly looking plain baked potato, tiny order of mac n cheese. we're quite confused about the potatoes, so we ask him \"is this how the twice baked potato comes? why are there 3 halves that look different?\" he does not answer and walks away and doesn't come back for awhile. we eat our food, cuz quite frankly it looks delicious, and if the yummy bread was any indication, we are in for a feast. he comes back after we've finished most of the food, picks up the water pitcher on the table and refills her water, does not refill mine. ok, whatever, i'll fill mine up myself. we finished eating we ask for the check. the plain potatoes halves are untouched.\n\nthe bill comes and he's charged for two potatoes! $9 each btw! $9 for an ugly plain potato really? for $9 i could've gotten a whole bag of potatoes from safeway and made my own plain ass baked potato! so we wave him down and tell him he's charged us for two potatoes and we only ordered one. he claims, that my friend ordered two, one plain and one twice baked. which is of course not true! he apologizes for the \"miscommunication\" and adjusts our bill. \n\nnot a great experience...to be fair the waiter was polite enough, however we got the feeling he was not only being snooty since we didn't a meal each, but he was also trying to charge us for things we did not order. the food was delicious, the service or attitude rather was lacking. i don't need great service, but DO NOT turn your nose up at me. the hostess was no better, she was lacking manners. i work in customer service myself, you're a fuckin hostess welcoming guests into your establishment, your business, guests that will be paying your salary at the end of the evening, a greeting certainly is not beyond expectation. \n\nsadly, i will not be coming back, which is too bad, cuz i loved the food. but there are so many delicious steak houses with great food who treat all their customers the same, no matter what they look like or how much their ordering. not to mention $9 for half of a twice backed potato? for $9 i expect the whole potato! the high prices and scarce portions are ridiculous! i can go to fleming's, pay the same price, my steak is 3 times bigger and juicer and tastier, and the sides are twice as big and they give whole potatoes! and i'm sure if someone were to order a plain potato they still would've found a way to make it more presentable. so utterly disappointed, i've been wanting to try this place, and now that i finally i have it was such a big let down! what a shame!", "author": "Gaile C."}

It was my husband's birthday and his special request for our dinner date was to get a good steak.  I knew he'd been to House of Prime Rib before and loved it, so I tried to get a reservation there, but it was booked up.  Happily, we managed to find an open table at Bobo's.\n\nFirst, we really liked the quirky space, with all its little nooks and crannies, off-kilter pictures on the walls and kitschy knicknacks.  The decor and music (disco!) were a welcome respite from the typical steakhouse stuffiness.  The service was friendly and attentive, but not rushed or obtrusive.  Our waiter made a perfect wine recommendation for our meal.\n\nWe both decided to splurge and get the bone-in filet.  We agreed that it was the best steak either of us had ever tasted, bar none.  Flavorful, tender and perfectly medium rare.  It was memorably good and totally worth the splurge.\n\nThe seafood crostini appetizers, brussels sprouts and onion rings were all delicious (my one minor complaint would be that the onion rings weren't quite as stellar as everything else, but then I'm exceedingly picky about onion rings).  It was a lovely meal and a great dining experience.  We're already looking forward to our next excuse to go downtown and splurge.  We want to try the crab next time.", "author": "M D."}

We were looking forward to it since we saw it received good reviews & figured it's gotta be good. We had 7:30 reservations, but arrived 20 minutes early & were able to be seated right away which was great. The decor made me think of a circus/mardi gras kinda theme which is interesting & fun. You can tell this place used to be a house because of the layout of the restaurant & narrow stairs & small rooms. We were seated in a tiny cramped corner which we didn't like, but the place was small to begin with. They give you a complimentary garlic olive oil loaf which I didn't care so much for cuz it was sour. We decide to order for our appetizers the lobster soup & crab  cakes. We liked the crab cakes & the lobster soup wasn't bad either. For steaks, I order my favorite cut which is the filet mignon while Jan ordered the bone in filet mignon & for the sides we order their baked potato & portabello mushrooms. Jan enjoyed his steak, but I on the other hand thought it was alright. I didn't like how it was way too charred on the outside & was slightly bland tasting. As for the sides, the baked potato was HUGE & we thought it was ok, but we didn't like the portabello mushrooms because the sauce they cooked it in was overpowering the taste of the mushrooms. When we finished our steaks, we decide on dessert & order their pistachio panna cotta. Wow... it was really good. Reminded me of pistachio gelato & flan in one. Overall, we were disappointed w/this place. Service was fine, but if the dessert is what we enjoyed the MOST out of everything else we ordered at a steakhouse for the price we paid, that's EXTREMELY disappointing. =/ We've had WAY better steaks than this place. We don't care to ever go back here. Sorry Bobo's!", "author": "Jan And Daph S."}

After an extended period of time, the server comes back with a modest dessert which she mentioned was complimentary because we mentioned that the day was a special occasion. OK, that was a nice gesture, but it would've been nicer if maybe they offered us the dessert menu as well. The bill comes and, guess what, the dessert (1) they CHOSE for us (2) which was allegedly COMPLIMENTARY and (3) wasn't all that good, was tacked onto the bill.

So what happens is that when you put the piece in your meat, it's quite tasty w/ a bunch of salt hitting your tongue. But as you chew, everything becomes less flavorful and bland.  In the end, you'll realize that it's not that great overall.\nThe twice baked potato was not as good as everyone seem to rave about.  I thought it tasted weird w/ some zuchinni in the mix.  \n\nWe also tried the mussels, which was good.  The crab was a tad too dry.  And they call themselves a steak and seafood place?? \n\nThe best item I thought for the night was the Italian cheesecake.  I was delighted that the meal ended w/ something good and sweet.\n\nAnd still why the 2 stars?  1 star for the cheesecake, and 1 star for the complimentary valet parking.  That's it. \n\nThe service, while wasn't horrible did not deserve a star.  It was mediocre service.  The thing we could not put up w/ was the snide comment from the hostess.  Thefore, I took away 1 star.\nSo my friend made reservations for a total of 10 people.  9 of us showed up.  As the hostess seated us and about to walk away, she told my friend that next time that she should call to confirm the number of people that will be showing up.  C'mon on.. 9 out of 10 ppl showed up.  It would be the exact same table setting, except that they have to take away 1 setting of plate and fork.  With a 18% mandatory tip, they cannot actually remove the extra chair and setting??  \nTo insert that snide comment before walking away was rude and a bit obnoxious of the hostess.  I would understand if only 6 or 7 of us showed up, b/c that would require re-moving the tables around.  \nI am definitely appalled by the hostess's attitude.  They are the gateway to the impression of the restaurant, and by her saying that, it already ruined the mood for us before we started eating.  The food did not help matters, except the dessert probably.\n\nI don't think we would come back for a \"next time\".

This is a steak joint, but given how much the steak is your money is better spent at a place like Harris's. This is a steak joint right? A steak joint with a mardi gras atmosphere. The high point is the steak. We both had the bone in filet mignon dry aged for six weeks. The meat was good, it was cooked fairly well and for a medium rare chunk of meat it had the required pinkness, raw near the bone, good juice and a wonderful buttery flavor from adequate marbling. Where this place goes down hill is everything else. The side dishes were absolutely flavorless, the bread over done to the point of being a flaky mess and the yellow tail carpacio, although tasty, was over priced and drowned in a sea of olive oil and balsamic which neutralized most of the more subtle fish flavors. The real problem is that for a steak joint, or a place that posits itself as a house where flesh should be consumed, they had too few fleshy options. The high point here was the service, friendly, and by the looks of the crowd in the bar area, a local meeting place even if the pours were on the smallish side and priced on the high side.", "author": "Len S."}

Owned by a trio of North Beach-based restaurateurs (the Stinking Rose is another of their six California dining spots), this is the place to go for the most exquisite steak in the city. It's USDA-certified prime beef, dry-aged four to six weeks and cooked to perfection, pan-seared in its own natural juices, with a hint of garlic and rosemary, then deglazed. What really sets them aside from the competition are the amazing starters, like crab cakes with cranberry confit, and the creative side dishes, such as sauteed cauliflower in a lemon-garlic-caper sauce, Maui onion rings, and zucchini bread pudding. Ordering soup to nuts, so to speak, with a couple of drinks, will run you in excess of $100 per person, definitely worth it for an occasional splurge.

However, the bone-in filet is truly wonderful and a rarity on a steak house menu. The best part about bobo's is that the sizzling seafood is just as good as the steak. Mussels, Shrimp, Crab: all are great. I usually stuff myself too much with the huge seafood items prior to my steak...but i never regret it.\n\nThe other thing I like about Bobo's is the pricing of both the steaks and the wine list. The steaks are not overly expensive. And being a couple that isn't rolling in $$$, my wife and I like that we don't have to go scouring through the wine list looking for that 1 bottle of Cab Sauv. that's in the $40-$80 price range.

NO SENSE OF TIMING, POOR MANAGEMENT:  I went to the restaurant for my friend's surprise grad dinner.  Since we have a big party, met the minimum, we got the priviate room by ourself.  Our reservation was 8:15pm.  There were a couple in the private room having dinner when we got there at 7:45 to set up the room, (since we were told it is a private room for us, we thought we can go a bit earlier to do a little decor).  The rest of our party came shortly after, Since it is a surprise party, everyone rather be there early then late, But guess what? Not only we were not seated in our room ON TIME, We were not even allowed in the room, no more than 4ppl  max, (the reasaon was: because they don't want to disturb the ONLY couple in the private room). Clock was ticking, the next thing you know, it is 8:30 already, and we were still not allowed to go in, b/c the couple were still there, plus of course they still have not set up the table yet  because of them.   Ok here is my thought,  i understand you dont want to disturb your customers, BUT, if you know you are gonna have a big party for the private room, don't u know better not to put anyone in that room when it is close to the reserved time?  Should you set the room up ahead of time? This is not how a up scaled restaurant should be like.  THE so called PRIVATE room, party of 18 minimum... HELLO???  Well as it turned out, we didn't get seated until 9pm. (45 mins late).   \n\n#2.  THEY DON'T KEEP THEIR WORDS:  We were told when we made reservation, we can either order from their regular menu OR a pre-set menu of $55/ per person.  Remember it was \"OR\" that they told us. But, when we got there, they refused to honor that OPTION.  Everyone of us had to order from the set menu.  BECAUSE quote quote from them: \"that's just easier for us\" .  Sure, thats easier for you, but what about us?? that means every one has to either order three course with a whole Crab or 13lb steak.  If you want to order other things, salad, dessert, or maybe you dont want any of those-- TOO bad for you, (No, too bad for us!!) !  And,  of course we cannot share either, remember 18 ppl min to have the room?? (so 18 sets min.hahaha...) Oh forget to mention, a  bill of to $55X22++ for you is \"small potato\" -- Great business and easier for you!!! Wow, pefect!\n\n# 3.  THING TEND TO GET MYSTERIOUSLY LOST IN THAT DARK PRIVIATE ROOM:  Ok, besides paying for food that's not even worse $55++, i unfortunetly had to pay a bit extra, BECAUSE, my camera has mysterousely dissapeared from my table!!  Btw, i was sure it was on my table, i even took a pic during dinner, and i had never left the table for bathroom or anything.  All my friend were in the room, double checked their belongings, and i dont know what happened, or how it happened, sometimes in between the dinner plates being taken away and hot towel being served, Camera dissapeared!!! \n\n#4.  OH last but not least, The food was not worse the price!!!  After you read all this, if you still are interested in going there, please take my  last little advice, if you want to have crab, have the whole crab, don't do half half with the meat.  The 1/2 crab meal is not as fresh as the whole one!  I am seafood person,  trust me, i can taste it!", "author": "Jasmin Y."}

Awesome steak, not so much other menu items\n- Good Service?: Yep. The place is about steak, but service was quick, courteous, and professional \n- Good Ambiance? This place is about steak. Decor is heavily masculine and wouldn't be out of place in the late 70's or early 80's, think Rockford Files meets  Pulp Fiction, with lots of Chinese restaurant red thrown in for good measure. Crowd was mixed, but mostly older. Dress ranged from T-shirt and jeans to fairly formal. \n- Good value? For one large awesome steak, one small awesome steak, two Manhattans, two beers, two soups, a salad and two deserts we spent $160 plus tip. \n- Good for a first date? Definitely not. Bobo's is about steak, not total experience, stimulating environment or intimacy. The dinning room is very small and tightly packed. Intimate conversation is not recommended unless knowing that any sweet nothings will be shared by your date and the adjacent tables gives you an exhibitionist rush. \n- Reservations Required?: They serve their full menu at the bar, so not absolutely necessary but highly recommended. Note: I was able to get a time slot shown as not available on opentable.com by calling directly. \n\nWarning/Full Disclosure: Our experience was marred by the loud, foul-mouthed, boastful jerk at the next table. I have the conflict seeking tendencies of your basic doormat,  but it was bad to the point that I regretted there were no kids in the dinning room, as that would have given me unambiguous license to tell the guy to watch his language and/or lower his voice.  The waiter later explained that the guy was one of their best customers, someone who \"kept the lights burning for a lot of years\" and therefore felt \"entitled.\" A jerky but valuable regular is a tough thing for any restaurant and obviously Bobo's made a decision. I'm guessing the guy comes in at least two or three times a week so know there is a reasonable chance your meal may come heavily peppered with the F word (and no, I don't mean fabulous). One positive: he left (to the obvious relief of the entire room) before our main courses arrived, allowing Bobo's to remain all about steak.", "author": "Bill S."}

The Bone-In New York Strip had a great, sweet marbled taste. Definite quality meat. The meat was perfectly cooked rare, and sat in its own deglazed juices. Damned good steak for a steakhouse, but I was disappointed by the supporting cast.\n\nEverything else was mediocre, if not sub-par for a high end steak house with the prices they were commanding. Sure they have Burrata and yes the velvety smooth, creamy texture was a man's version of McDreamy. But everything else was...   eh. Crab cakes were meaty, but nothing to have a food-gasm about. Again the steaks were great, but the char danced the fine line between a great sear and burnt toast crustyness. Yeah that's a word, don't worry about it. The meal wasn't helped much by the sides. In a word, they were sad. Portobello Mushrooms swimming in a sea of garlic grease, and Swiss Chard that seemed blanched dressed in garlic olive oil. So it's not fair to judge all the sides because we only had two, but c'mon folks you've got to know the sides make a good steak that much better. Poo poo poo on you for falling flat on your face. But hey, look at the bright side. There's places like Izzy's that make you look that much better! HIGH FIVE!", "author": "Al L."}

Some have suggested that Bobo's makes the best steaks in the City.  While I haven't yet tried all the major steakhouses, I have to imagine that at least one of those places can make a better New York steak than the one I had.  My steak was good, but it really wasn't much of an improvement over what I've had at a spot like Izzy's... I ordinarily like my beef rare, but this time I made an exception and ordered it medium-rare, because this is what Bobo's recommends.  What I got was closer to medium on the edges and more rare as I got closer to the bone.  While the flavor was good, if I spend 38 bucks on a steak, it had better melt in my mouth.  And this steak most definitely did not melt in my mouth.    They don't have the traditional sides -- like creamed spinach -- but there are plenty of other tasty options, like swiss chard in garlic and olive oil and creamed yams with brown sugar.\n\nThe service was okay, but a little slow.  And the winelist has a serious markup.  Seeing as the corkage is only 15 bucks, I'd bring your own bottle.", "author": "Andrew E."}

Others in our party did the surf and turf and the petit filet, which also makes up in taste what is lacks in presentation.

The positives are few and far between, the bone in filet  was delicious, the crab cakes were really small, cute, and tasty, but again not worth the bill at the end.\n\nThe bad--aside from the thief's in valet; the crab is horrible and everything else is mediocre at best.  I've eaten crab all my life, and this could have been the worst I've ever had. The menu says nothing, nor did the waiter, about how the crab is served. It comes coated with some brown, gritty, butter garlic sauce, which ruins anything it touches on the plate, and leaves your mouth tasting like a vat of Crisco. Also note that if you order the surf and turf, your cut of meat will look more like a taste off someone's plate rather than an actual steak.....my petite filet was, oh, 2.5-3oz. Not exactly what I had in mind.  For sides, the waiter recommended the Swiss Chard (not good) and the Twice Baked Potato (just ok). We also got the tomato romaine wedge salad, which was so unoriginal and bitter it should have been sent back (I've seen 8th grade Home Economic students make better).  The onion rings were decent, but at $1 a ring, were they that good? Probably not.  They also came along and randomly tossed half a loaf of toasted, stale, crusty bread on the table, dripping in olive oil.  It was so bad, I wondered why they even bother putting it out? \n\nIf you are bound and determined to eat here, set the bar low, hide your valuables, and hope someone else picks up the check.", "author": "Scott R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-12-14", "description": "I'm sorry...was that a steak I just consumed, or a deliciously seasoned and well-disguised stick of butter? Bobo's steaks, which are aged for many weeks more than most other establishments in the U.S. (or so they claim), are the best I've ever had---and my family is full of good cooks and knows how to grill a steak. Indeed, before Bobo's, the family steak held the top spot. People are serious about the horrendous atmosphere, though. I didn't really notice it the first time, but the last time I was there, it definitely struck me. It's like the inside of a clown on acid. It actually seems REALLY old school to me, and I'm under the impression that the restaurant actually hasn't been around that long...like long enough to get away with that \"well, we decorated in the 40's\" excuse. Also, sound carries inside, so it can be very loud if there's a large party in your section (especially a loud, obnoxious drunk one...consider yourself warned).\n\nAnyway, the filet is almost consistency of butter, though I did try to chew it with just my tongue and the roof of my mouth, and that didn't quite work. But then I didn't have the leverage of my jaw, so I think it's safe to say a toothless person could eat this steak. The crab cakes with the dried cranberry relish are also fanfuckingtastic. (I bet the straight up crab is too...this is San Francisco, after all). I've tried the onion rings and the baked/stuffed potato, too. The onion rings are made with purple onions (which are my favorite), so I was surprised I wasn't that thrilled by them. The baked potato had a good consistency and was artfully done, but I'm not a fan of whatever cheese they use in it (fontina, I think). That didn't stop me from eating a few bites when the BF wanted to share one, though. It is pricey ($29 for the petite filet, I think, and around $8 per side), so be prepared to pay. But you're guaranteed to get a five star steak...just don't get TOO high before you go or you might be afraid to step inside.", "author": "Jasmine F."}

Lots of tschotkies you'd find in a watery-red-sauce Italian North Beach tourist trap, not in a high priced steakhouse. Second, the service. Our waiter, while nice enough, knew little to nothing about the food or how it was prepared...Then, our table. We had a reservation for nearly a week in advance but were still sat at a table under the stairs. Sounded like there was a running of bulls in Pamplona through our meal. The racket of heavy-set waiters up and down the stairs all service was so bad we asked to be moved to another table. Now the food: well, spinach cheese fondue was not hot enough and the consistency was too heavy. My steak was good as it goes, but I can think of at least a half dozen other SF steakhouses (and those not even known for their steak!) that serve up a more flavorable side of beef. Think Harris', House of Prime Rib, ....hell, even, Izzy's!.

It was good as well, but for some reason the petit filet that came with the surf and turf didn't taste as good as the a la carte petit filet. All in all the entrees were good, but if I do go again I'm just sticking to the steak and a twice baked potato!!!! BOTH YUMMY! Another perk I almost forgot is that when you eat here there's no need to look for parking...COMPLIMENTARY VALET!!!!", "author": "Krystal G."}

I called them last Saturday afternoon to make last minute reservations for a party of 12( day before Mother's Day).  They very kindly did some juggling of schedule to accomodate us. Later on it turned out there would only be 6 of us. When i called to let them know they were very appreciative.  So, 6 of us sat in a round booth. The decor was amusing, attractive...quirky and fun. The staff was  nothing but friendly and attentive.\nThe food OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!\nThe lobster curry soup, scrumptiouis...the brussels sprouts w/ pancetta..MMMMMM. \nThe meat, I'm told, was amazing. I had 1/2 garlic broiled crab. It was delicious, but personally took too long to crack open, for small the smaller bites inside. Next time I\"ll go for meat, as yummy as the crab was. They have an elegant selection of desserts. I only have fabulous things to say about this place, including the free valet parking (tips, of course). Can't wait to go back.", "author": "June K."}

Only positive thing is the 'free' valet parking service which is pretty much one poor guy trying to park cars into a 20 spot garage while keeping Lombard's right lane off Van Ness clear of customer's cars. Once you get in and sit down however, there isn't much positive left. \nThe prices are standard steakhouse but the quality of meat and steak grilling skill is very poor. First of all, this steak house uses a flat iron skillet, fancy way of saying the steaks are not cooked properly. I order my steaks rare everywhere I go and so I know exactly what to expect. Not only did my steak come back very overcooked but almost everyone with me had the same problem. Some got wrong cuts of beef and it was just horrible. My steak was probably medium well with a very poor texture and the meat itself was not juicy and lacked flavor. \nIt's very sad when a 'steakhouse' serves poor meat but extra sad when the best food they serve is their crab which is only so-so at best. The servers are nice and the decor is pretty cool but the pricing is ridiculous. I am usually happy to pay about $100 a person at a steakhouse if the steaks are good. Paying $100 at Bobos i felt was a crime. One of the worst steaks I have ever paid for in my life. But for those who call this place the best... get your taste buds, tongues, palates examined. For the same price, you can get a much better tasting steak and overall experience at almost any other steakhouse in the city. \nStick to the basics, Morton's is a big public company restaurant franchise for a reason.

We were seated in a small upstairs room that was decorated with random knickknacks, which were most likely found in the basement of the owner's parent's house.  I'm talking foam a Siva heads, a tin lantern, mirrored flower holders, and tea candles.  I swear I thought that I was in the game Clue: Colonel Mustard in the Library with a candle stick. \n\nSo the decor was bad, but the food was worse.  We ordered a \"wedge\" of salad.  I imagined a quarter head of iceberg lettuce or something like that.  What arrived was three, wilted leaved of romaine smothered in blue cheese dressing.  We sent the first \"wedge\" back and got another one that was marginally more fresh.  Maybe I'm a fool for thinking that a steakhouse can do a good veggie.  I was similarly disappointed by the bland cauliflower and deep fried zucchini, which were cut like hot-dog pennies.  I did like the onion rings and yams.\n\nAs for the steak, I had the petite filet and my friend had the porter house.  He said he loved the porter house and there was various \"MMmmm\" sounds expressed that confirmed that it was in fact a good steak.  The petite filet was small but good, though undercooked. \n\nI had high hopes for this place.  Sorry to say it doesn't live up to most of the reviews or the title of second-best steak in SF.

All of them recommended the Bone-in Filet and the twice stuffed potato.\n\nIn my opinion, I've tasted better steak and sides at other steakhouses (20oz Bone-in Filet at Metropolitan Grill, Seattle), but Bobo's still ranks very high among the restaurants I've visited.\n\nI'm not sure if it was my table's luck, but my buddy and I both ordered the bone-in filet medium rare and received steaks that were unevenly cooked. The portion of meat away from the bone was cooked almost all the way through. The meat was still tender, but it was not a bit raw in the middle. As I progressed closer to the bone, the center became rarer and was delicious. If only it had been a bit more even throughout. I understand that the section by the bone would be the most rare, but I did not expect the rest of my steak to be severely compromised.\n\nI'm not a big guy, but I am a big eater. I want my steakhouse meals to be huge. I want a large steak and large sides. The sides at Bobo's didn't really cut it for me. Our twice baked potato was probably about the size of a computer mouse, and the sweet potato looked a single scoop of ice cream on a plate.

So despite the exterior, the menu here is basically luxury style where there are few items, everything is a la carte, and everything was expensive.  I ordered the New York Bone-In ($39) with a side of portabello mushrooms ($8) and fried zucchini ($8).  I ordered the steak medium-rare (which is done by default unless specified), but my steak came more medium than it was medium-rare.  I didn't tell them to redo it (I hate doing that as much as possible, so to not get \"extra sauces\" into my meal), but the flavor was very good.  It was still pretty tender and the juices was very flavorful with whatever spices and herbs they used to marinate it.  The sides, I thought the mushrooms were decent; it actually came out lukewarm when I got mine, but the zucchini was excellent especially dipping it in the tartar sauce.  One thing that I regretted getting was their baked potato and I tried a bite out of someone else's and it was amazing.  I don't know what they did, but you get a half slice and its basically a mashed potato mixed with butter and spinach dip and not sure what else.  Trust me, get the baked potato for the side if you do come here.\n\nI saw some of what other people had and the filet mignon ($39) looked pretty typical.  It was 8 oz and it looked very tender, but people I talked to wasn't jumping out of their chair for it.\n\nBy the end of the night after some corkage fees and splitting the cost for some of the appetizers, I spent about $90 there.  Was it worth $90?  No, but I guess I would be very hard pressed to ever say any restaurant would be worth that much.  But if you want a fine, dining steak (and I suppose crab) experience, then you can't go wrong here.  They have a great wait staff, the unique atmosphere of the restaurant, and their food is quite eloquant, though not without a few mishaps that I encountered.  I would go back again, but I preferably would want to pay less and try out their crab.", "author": "David Y."}

My first opinion of the soup was that they didn't give us nearly enough, but upon consuming half of it i discovered it was really rich and thick and full of huge chunks of lobster!  The crostini was light but the portions of crab were not skimpy, and even though it wasn't a real standout, it was a refreshing appetizer.  And being a lover of cheeses, the burrata was really good both by itself and on bites of the crostini.  (i had heard that burrata is the king of fresh mozzarella, and it definitely lived up to the hype)  \n\nfor the main course we ordered two filets and the whole crab that we all shared.  plus a twice baked potato and zucchini friti on the side.  The steaks really were perfectly tender with the right amount of charring on the top, and whatever the flavors were, they were delicious.  The crab was also excellent.  Much better than your typical boiled crab.  Even though the garlic and butter were applied to the outside of the crab, the meat still had some of the flavors of it, but of course could be dipped in the sauce.  I really liked the potato and the zucchini was fine, but nothing spectacular.  the only downside was how incredibly messy it was, but that's always the case with crab and they bring you wet napkins after dinner to help with the cleanup process (major props for the wet towels).  \n\ndessert consisted of cones filled with mousse (so good), and pistachio panna cotta (which i really liked, but the parentals weren't too thrilled by).\n\nthe waitstaff was very attentive, but not in our faces.  Our server was constantly making sure our glasses were filled (though they did leave carafes of water on the tables) and that we had everything we needed, but never rushed us (i take my time going for every last bit of crab meat).

Typically, when I want to really get my hands dirty, i'll go with the petite filet and half crab. It simply cannot be beat. However, when I'm feeling especially decadent, I'll order the bone-in aged filet. I can't quite put my finger on it, but they do something to their steaks that creates this abundance of flavor that I have yet to find in any other steakhouse I've ever been to. Hands down the best steak I've ever had the pleasure of cornering and devouring. Bonus, Bobo's always serves me my steak extremely rare, exactly as I order it. Never once have I had to send my steak back as being overdone. And let's face it, for a girl like me  with slightly vampiric tendencies, it's as close to love as I'll ever get. Their sides are delicious and easily large enough for two or three. I highly recommend the sauteed chard, mushrooms, or twice baked potato.

It seemed as if the room he was working was for those who did not have reservations and it seemed he resented the task of serving those who may or may not be as generous with the gratuity.  Again the wine list was very nice and set up for tourists as all the selections were catagorized by price using the grocery store method of pricing on the .99 ie., 19.99......29.99 etc. Effective but tacky.  Still I would return and be sure to make a reservation as well as ask to be seated in one of the dark dining areas as opposed to the brightly lit area with a view of the traffic on Lombard st.  Avoid the side dishes and request lite salt on the meats.  The first visit we ordered the filet mignon and it was prepared perfect.

My boyfriend and I recommend this place to all of our friends and have taken multiple people back with us.  We travel over an hour each way to go to this place and it is worth every minute of our drive.\nFirst, the food is incredible!  The bread they bring out is topped with green olives and olive oil is disbursed throughout the loaf which is so good!  We always get the crab cakes.  I don't even like crab but last time we went we ordered 2 orders  so we could each have 2.  They are crispy on the outside, excellent flavors inside, and topped with a cranberry relish that is the best crab cake topping I've ever tasted!  I always get the filet mignon (bone-out) and my boyfriend always gets the filet mignon (bone-in).  This is by far the best steak you will ever have.  I recently tried Ruth's Chris to see how it compared to Bobo's filet and it paled in comparison to Bobo's.  The aging process they do with their steaks and the method of cooking causes the steak to literally melt in your mouth.  The twice baked potato is my favorite side.  It is SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOD!  My boyfriend loves the mac n cheese side.  As far as sides go, those two are the best.  \n\nNegative would be that our service is somewhat hit or miss.  We have had a couple servers who were very friendly, knowledgeable, and actually kept our waters full, but more often than not, our service is under par.  We had one waiter whose cologne was so strong it almost ruined our meal, which was on top of the fact that he only checked on us once.  The servers are making good tips because of the price of food, so I would think that servers would be a little more attentive to things like refilling water and menu knowledge.  If we didn't love the food like we do, the service would be enough reason for us to not go back.  They have changed the recipe on the steaks since when we first started going.  It's still excellent but I personally like it even better (if that's possible) when they used some rosemary in pan when cooking the steak.  The flavor was just a bit more complex.  The noice level can get obnoxious.  The last couple of times we have been seated next to business parties who seem to think they are the only people in the place.\n\nOverall, this place is worth every penny if you are a food lover like me.

They bring you bread in the beginning that is olive and garlic or something? very good.  \n\nThe main meals are a la carte.  They said for three people we should get 2 or 3 sides; we got 2 and that was definitely enough.  We got the sauteed cauliflower and then something else that was like steamed spinach but not quite? the cauliflower was good, I think next time though i'd get the zuchini frittada rather than the spinach-like-stuff.\n\nThe food is good! ...but there is a price for that!\n\n- We went on a Monday night and had no problem going last minute...

From the outside, the place didn't look like the typical upscale 5 star joints that I'm used to, but hey-what the heck!?! So as we got out of the car (Valet service a plus), we were escorted past the line, and taken upstairs to our private dining room (compliments of the owner) near the patio. We greeted by the Maitre d' & were offered the best selection of Cognac on the house ($200 bottle not on the menu). After skimming through the menu, we decided to go with Appetizer: Apple-walnut cranberry salad. Entree: Porterhouse Filet Mignon. Sides: Baked yam, Portobello mushrooms, and modern mac & cheese for the sides. Drinks: Moscow Mojito & Champagne. Everything was delish & more than enough food to take home for left overs. The only complaint that I have was the loud cackling hens (middle-aged drunk white women, one who tried to hit on me & my guest), were extremely \"chocolate\" wasted, loud, & obnoxious. With the way Bobo's require a specif formal dress code, reservations, and over $200 for dinner for 2, you would think that type of behavior wasn't allowed.

The service is not tremendous and the decor (dark, funky) is not for everyone, but if you want a romantic dinner with a loved one, and a perfectly cooked steak, this is the spot for you.\n\nWe started off with the burrata with grilled asparagus and heirloom tomatoes.  The EVOO that it came with was flavorful, but the burrata was the star of this salad/appetizer.  Creamy and mild, I have to find somewhere in the city that sells a close imitation!\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the New York strip and my girlfriend ordered the surf & turf (half-crab, petit filet).  I snagged one of the crab legs from her, and almost wished I had gotten her meal!  Though it takes some effort with the cracking/extracting, the claw meat was worth every bit of time spent.  The legs were enormous, fresh, and juicy, though the accompanying sauce was nothing to write home about.\n\nThe New York strip was one of the best I've had, not just in SF.  Mine was medium rare and cooked exactly that way.  Those who don't want a steak red in the middle should order it medium.  The steak was so good I contemplated taking the bone up with my hands and chewing off every last delectable morsel of meat.\n\nNot to be missed were the twice-baked potatoes, which were the best I've ever had.  They were silky smooth and cooked perfectly, and had a flavorful burst of scallion, sour cream, and seasoning that will make sure I order it next time I come back. \n\nSince it was my girlfriend's birthday, I also got the strawberry cheesecake.  Luckily, it was very light and not too sweet, so even though we were stuffed, it did not make us feel sick from overeating after we finished.

All ordered bone in filet.  Although we explained to the waiter that we wanted them pink, nor red or wet in the middle, three of the four steaks came out too rare.  Not a big deal to us, just please cook them a little more.  However, waiter left the 4th one at the table and continued to bring the sides, so the birthday boy ate his dinner alone while the three of us watched.  Then, when our steaks came out, he sat and watched us eat.  Moreover, my steak was poor quality with fat running through it.  Waiter proceeded to tell me I should order a different steak because I just \"wasn't aware\" of what BIFM tastes like.  Really? I've had plenty of BIFM's all over the U.S., including at Fleming's in San Jose (which was PERFECT), Gibson's in Chicago, the Caucus Room in DC, etc.   All were far superior to what I was served.  At least the manager came over and agreed with me on the quality and then made a second steak (which is reason for the 2nd star).  Worst of all, when it came time for dessert, the two teens ordered something, and waiter brings my son's dessert with a candle in it, places it in front of my husband who blows out the candle, then the waiter picks it up and places it in front of my son.  They couldn't even be bothered to give my husband a birthday dessert! (Yes, they were informed weeks ahead of our dinner that it was a birthday celebration).

Fortunately for us on a saturday night at 8 there was a table for two in the bar by the window, and we were seated right away. (really wish they had a podium for the hostess though, it felt like we walked into the back kitchen and felt a little lost) on to the food.\n     Crab Cakes: Almost all crab with enough crumbs to hold it together, and the cranberry relish was the perfect addition. \n     Baked Yams: Smooth and creamy, with a sprinkle of brown sugar on top. Although for 8 bucks I wish the portions were a little bigger, also because yams are my favorite side and do not want to share. (sorry b.f)\n      Portobello mushrooms: fantastic, the seasonings were so good it could have been mistaken for little cubes of tender beef. \n       Surf and Turf: (Petit filet mignon and 1/2 crab) the steak was extremely tender, however some parts were a little over salted...still good. and crab was great with the butter lemon caper sauce thing.\n\n       Best thing was our waiter Bernard who was the BEST! Bernard was prompt when needed but did not overcrowd us. Replaced water when and, inquired about our food appropriately. He even gave us an extra pair of crab crackers in case my b.f wanted some crab or if I just wanted some help.  \n    We are so coming back.

So, the group of us (four people) decided to order the double crab double mussels, the double crab double shrimp, two BONE IN FILET MIGNONS, mac & cheese, brussel sprouts and twice baked potato.  Man oh man.  The seafood was great, but I definitely have had better.  The mac & cheese was good, however, I'm not a big fan of blue cheese, and there was a lot of it in there.  The other sides weren't outstanding either.  But the Bone-in Filet Mignon was utterly, melt in your mouth delicious!!!  If you come here, you must order this Bone-in Filet Mignon!!  For four people, and all that food, the bill was just under $250.  Mind you we didn't order drinks.  What a deal!!  Reasonably priced, scrumptious food!

The prefab places had a lot of similar granite options, but we did not find the color scheme we were looking for.

Because of the reviews on Yelp, we went to Andrea's.  We assumed we would not be able to afford their services, but we liked the idea that it is a family business and that Giovanni, his father, and his son Andrea, had all been trained as stone fabricators.  Although much of their work is fabricating materials people buy elsewhere, they do have a selection of slabs in their warehouse.  They happened to have a slab with the colors we wanted, and it had some interesting garnet, carbon and quartz highlights.  We gave Andrea the layout details of our galley kitchen.  He spent a lot of time discussing our relatively small project and helped us choose a counter edge that fits our particular needs.  We were very surprised when we learned that his price was almost the same as the price quotes we had received at the prefab places, and we agreed to have Andrea fabricate and install our countertop.   \n\nAndrea came to our house in Concord to prepare the template and answered all of our questions.

I've had the bone-in filet on three separate occasions, and it has been nothing short of sublime each time.  The mushrooms and twice-baked potatoes are both excellent sides, and the wine list is reasonably priced.  The decor and the ambience are a little bizarre, but if what you're looking for is a truly fine piece of beef that is exquisitely prepared, this is your place.", "author": "Drew W."}

It was dimmly lit and had multiple dining nooks on multiple levels. These nooks can make for a more intimate setting, if your party is 2-3.  The service there was great with informed waiters.  Just a note, expect a wait if you have no reservations.\n\nNow, I am fairly new to steak but i can safely say that this is probably the second best New York that i have ever had.  Being our first visit to this place the waiter kindly explained to us the aging process used on all their steaks.  Apparently something delicious happens during this process. whatever it was keep doing it.  My Girl, who is a filet fiend, said that her petite filet was the best she had ever had.  I guess that means its good.  We both each got a side, the twice baked 'tato and the onion rings, both of which were amazing and we wished that we had ordered more sides.", "author": "Milo A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-11", "description": "Bobo's offers the perfect dining experience.  It's a classy restaurant with a funky masquerade twist.  Hostesses, bartenders, and servers are all warm, friendly, and accommodating.  And the food is, and I say this with conviction, great!  It really is well above average.  An A+ if you will.  I came here last Friday for the first time after hearing so many rave reviews about this place and I must say that it did live up to its expectations.  Alas, there wasn't anything surprising because I came for great and that's what they gave me.  (As a sidenote, I love trying a place where I have no expectations at all and am pleasantly surprised.  Going in with an unbiased opinion creates for a better judgement of the overall experience.  I feel that there is a high risk of disappointment in venturing to a widely praised restaurant due to failure to meet high expectations.)  Moving on....we arrived early to get a drink at the bar.  I got a split of champagne and I was impressed by the champagne flute.  The mark of a classy glass is a thin stem.  Not as impressed with the wine glasses because of the thicker stems, but that's okay.  My date ordered a scotch and I really have nothing to say about that.  We were seated promptly and attended to with kindness and servitude.  For the night our order consisted of the Cherry Tomato and Avocado Salad, one Crab to share, a Twice-Baked Potato to share, and the kicker Filet Mignon.  The salad and potato were good.  Unique dishes and quality, but not as good as the crab or filet.  Now, I've always found it ironic that crab is served at nice restaurants even though it seems like something you should be eating out in the backyard with ribs or something.  That shit is so messy.  But I really liked it.  It wasn't too buttery and garlicy because sometimes that can over-power the crab.  Now the filet was amazing.  Considering this is my favorite type of steak, it was really a treat to have such a tender piece of meat cooked to perfection.  In retrospect I probably could have ordered a bigger one and have nixed some of the sides.  Dinner was followed by a cappucino.  Now I'm not a huge coffee drinker because the stuff makes me sick, but this cappucino was amazing.  If Starbucks made coffees like that, then maybe I'd actually buy the stuff.  We brought our own wine and I didn't much look at the wine list, but I do know that there were some $800 bottles there.  Whoo.  Those must be good.  After all the wonderful things said about Bobo's I agree with people, but don't expect angels to swoop down and bring you diamond encrusted champagne flutes with Dom Perignon, cholesterol free steaks that melt in your mouth, and no-calorie ice cream cakes that make you skinnier.  Anyway, sometimes it's the company that makes an experience and in this case it definitely was.  I had a splendid time with my date which only made everything else that much better.  Brilliant drinks, brilliant food, brilliant service, brilliant conversation--an overall brilliant time!", "author": "Vanessa Z."}

No concessions are made to decor (west Texas bordello meets Dean Martin) or convenience (think \"l'Idiot\" in L.A. Story if you arrive before 10pm sin reservations), because you don't go there for that.  This place is about The Steak.  Sides are a distraction, and ambiance is for wimps.  The meat is dry-aged for a month and a half before it is deemed ready.  Those of you with less refined palates who are used to the rubber and gristle national chains might be a little off-put by the texture, and indeed mistake the \"au jus\" for butter.  It's not.  The bone-in fillet mignon will shake the foundations of even the most dyed-in-the-wool PETA-card-carrying vegan.  Boboquivari's is the reason God invented cows.

Our group was lucky enough to have an almost private room to ourselves so some of the atmosphere was lost. The drinks were a bit pricey and could have been poured a little stiffer, but they weren't bad. And their wine list was a bit unsophisticated and slightly overpriced for what I was getting. As everyone before me has already said, you come here for the steak. I had the bone-in New York which was RIDICULOUSLY GOOD. It wasn't the best steak (I categorize Prime Rib joints differently) I ever had, but it has jumped into my Top 5 for sure, maybe even Top 3. They know their steaks here, but you definitely pay for it. Everything is a la carte, and I recommend getting some sides to balance out your meal. The cauliflower was good and so was the twice baked potato. But in terms of what Bobo's was selling, THE STEAK, this place is a 4 star joint.

The sides didn't fare much better -- the zucchini frites smelled of rancid oil, and the baked potato (which we did not order, but was \"comped\" when they realized their mistake) was too heavy full of cheese and whatever the hell else they'd stuffed in there.

Which does not mean the steak wasn't good, it definitely was but the whole ambiance and feel of the crowd and quality of the service just isn't up to par to a place like Harris'. To start, the decor is kitschy bordering on hideous, and for some reason the majority of the other diners seemed to be a bunch of loud and obnoxious drunks with young, unruly kids. Which is not necesarily the restaurant's fault but it definitely detracted from our dining experience. However, our salads were quite tasty and the famous olive oil soaked bread was delicious. The quality and preparation of the steaks were good and they are quite tender, however I felt like my steak was overpeppered, every time I took a bite I got a delicious meat taste and then a strong aftertaste of pepper. We had the champagne sorbet for dessert which was yummy. Overall the place was only three stars for me but I'm going to give it an extra star for Lisa our server who was a total sweetheart and so nice and dealt graciously with all the other rude people seated next to us.

I went last night for the first time, and WOW... i was blown away at how good my steak was. First let me start by saying that from the outside... it looks like a TGIFridays... so it was never really appealing to me. BUT the saying never judge a book by its cover seriously applies to this restaurant. I followed many peoples advise and requested a booth on my opentable reservation. We were promptly seated in the front room, in a great booth by the window (overlooking lombard). Not the best view, but at least we had a window. The decor is the only reason why I cannot give it 5 stars. It is really tacky, loud, and just distracting. My eyes kept going all over the place instead of focusing on the convo I was having with my friend I hadn't seen in over  year. We said yes to the bread, which is baked fresh for each order with olives and garlic and olive oil. SOOOO good. There is nothing better than having warm bread at the table. I got the spinach and fontina fondue and Mike got the curry lobster soup. Both were so good, and we could've ended our meal there, since we were already pretty full. I would've like the consistency of the fondue to be meltier (is that a word?), but I think fontina isn't really meant for fondue... still good though, and the fact that the spinach dip tasted like spinach was a major plus. I had the petit filet mignon which was the perfect size, anything bigger and I would not have finished it. The steak, was PERFECT. Beautifully crispy on the outside, and juicy and soft on the inside. so soft that the steak just melts in your mouth. I'm salivating again as I write this...Mike got the one on the bone which is their specialty and he said it was the best steak he ever had, but it was too big for him.

My wife and I went there for dinner, made reservations on open table and all went smoothly. Arrived a few minutes late, we parked at valet which was complimentary as others have said. Went inside and the hostess promptly seated us. So far so good.\nOur waitress was very nice, we ordered the crab cake appetizer while going over the menu. While waiting for the appetizer our bread came and was ok, greasy but kind of good in a way. When the crab cakes arrived they looked good. Crispy and crusty on the outside moist and meaty inside, nice crab flavor. The cranberry relish they served on the side was really good with them. So now we are happily awaiting our dinner. Appetizer was good, wine is good, we are happy. Then comes dinner, my wife ordered the double shrimp and crab and I ordered the infamous bone-in fillet. As our sides we ordered the portabella mushrooms and twice baked potato. At this point all looked great, but flavor wasn't really there. The dbl shrimp and crab was ok at the very best, not something I expected to have here. It was more on par with a tourist trap. My fillet, after reading review after review about the bone-in fillet, I was expecting greatness, I mean the \"best steak in the city\" as some have said. I was so disappointed you can't imagine. Well, I guess you can since it prompted me to write this review.  It was a good fillet, not the best, not even close. I have decided after this, that for me a fillet on it is own should not be bone-in. Kind of defeats the purpose of a nice fillet. The sides where good, mushrooms and a twice baked potato, could it of been bad? I guess so, but they were good so I will leave it at that. Would I order again? The mushrooms yes, because my wife loves mushrooms. We also ordered dessert, the chocolate mousse cones. Not bad, they were good but not really our style. We ordered them because nothing else sounded appealing. A little bit of mouse in an upside down waffle cone. With that said, the fillet was aged, flavorful but a little salty and a good size. The dbl shrimp and crab, don't waste your money. Crab cakes good, service was pretty good. Everything else was just...  well just ok.

No luck...not even with a cash offer to create an opening. I dialed Bobo's and they had an available table within the hour of my phone call on Saturday evening!  This was my first time there so I was admittedly nervous about inviting out of town guests. Yelper's seemed to enjoy it so I felt a bit better. We had a great booth comfortable for lingering. Our waiter was charming, in fact the entire staff was attentive and very unpretentious. We ordered the warm bread with olives and olive oil. It was okay...a bit too salty for me but they guys seemed to like it. I ordered the mojito which was full of limes and mint and not enough vodka to give me a buzz-it was tasty though. (For $10 I expect more alcohol in my drink). The fillet was in a word 'butter.' I doubt anyone can eat an incredible amount of meat in one sitting which is why the petite cut is plenty( Bobo's offers a 19oz steak)! The twice baked potato was killer and it complimented the meat perfectly. My friends seemed impressed and I felt good about my restaurant choice. Next time I'm ordering the crab.

The first time I went here, I waited one hour for a table when we made reservations. We waited at the bar and told them that we were fine eating at the bar. They told us that they don't serve food at the bar. Eventually we said fuck it and went to Izzy's. Tonight I walked in with no reservations and they were able to seat us immediately AT THE BAR. Probably a change in policy but who knows. The meal was excellent but they do things a little different here that you should know about. The crab is cooked in a skillet instead of boiled. The heat from the skillet is intense and makes the shell of the crab brittle. You have to be very careful when you crack the crab. Tiny little pieces of crab shell go everywhere and you could end up cracking your tooth on a piece of crab shell like Sam Malone did in the free salad he ate from Melville's. ( It is the subplot of the episode where Cliff thinks he is a comedian and Lilith is the only one who thinks he is funny. Season 10 Episode 15. IMDB it.) ANYWAY.......They also dry age their meat which makes it delicious. I mean that steak is really good. We also had the twice baked mashed potatoes which were tasty. The mushrooms are really tasty but you will be belching that garlic for the rest of the night. Overall this is a really good place. They have some really cool tables up stairs for parties of 6 or more. Looks like a good place to get the guys together before a big night out on the town.", "author": "John S."}

I'm kind of a steak snob and didn't expect to find a great piece of meat in a place that reminded me of Clown Alley.  I mean I'm used to crappy steakhouse decor (ie. Peter Luger's) but don't think I've been to a steakhouse that gaudy that looked like TGI Friday's from outside.  My friends and I had initially planned to go to Bob's but at the last second, the rug was pulled out from under me and we were transported to Bobo's.  Anyway, the night didn't start out too hot.  We were 15ish minutes late for our reservation so the hostess had given our table away.  She wasn't particularly friendly and kept telling us to wait 5 more minutes even though we weren't being pushy at all.  After being told \"5 more minutes\", probably 5 more times, we were finally seated.  Once we were seated, the hostess magically became much friendlier.  Plus our waitress was great.  I think her name was Kimberly.  She was very attentive and offered good suggestions without trying to upsell us.  Since the 3 of us were ordering steaks, she suggested sharing the whole crab to start when we had intended to get the larger 3 pound option.  The crab was delicious.  I'm not usually the biggest fan of crab since it requires a little too much effort on my part, but this was well worth it.  The accompanying garlic baked sourdough olive loaf was perfect for soaking up the excess sauce from the crab.  For entrees, we all opted for the bone-in filet.  The waitress explained that there were only 6 places in the country that offered a bone-in filet (this was the first time I'd ever seen it and i've been around the block a few times) and that Bobo's was known for it so I decided not to order the NY Bone-in that I'd been eying.  All of our steaks were cooked perfectly.  I have to say that this was perhaps the best steak I've had in San Francisco, rivaling Harris'.  This was steak as it should be done - no unnecessary sauces or accompaniments.  Just a great quality piece of meat with minimal seasoning.  For sides, we shared the mod mac (Bobo's take on mac & cheese) and sauteed portobello mushrooms.  Both sides were excellent, but the mac portion was a little small.  We enjoyed a surprisingly well priced bottle of Jordan Cab with our meals.  As everyone was pretty stuffed, we opted to forgo dessert and just have some after-dinner drinks.  All in all, Bobo's was well worth the $$$.  For a superb piece of meat, there aren't a lot of options in SF and Bobo's should be at the top of the list.", "author": "Saw T."}

I gave up trying to age my own steaks in the vegetable crisper of my refrigerator after realizing that I probably can never get them to taste as good as a dry-aged cut from Bobo's.  They are one of only 3 restaurants in the country that has FDA approval to age their steaks for this long.  During 6 weeks of dry aging, excess water leaves the meat thereby concentrating flavor, and natural enzymes already existing in the meat actually break down tough connective tissue and do some of the chewing for you.  The grain is nonexistent. You need skills in order to cut a bone-in filet, which is why you don't often see them on menus.  Order just a steak and maybe a glass of wine.  You don't need bread.  You don't need appetizers.  You don't need sides.  You don't even need a toothpick.  The enzymes in your saliva are enough to melt away this protein from the gums of even the most gap-toothed of diners.", "author": "Kevin G."}

Its a scary dimly lit mix of court jester, clown and medieval harlequin wrapped into one.  But, its okay, because we were there to eat meat.  And eat meat we did.  We ordered two bone-in filets and after an extensive lesson from the enthusiastic server, we were informed that the steak is kept offsite, aged longer than at all other steakhouses, and when its cooked, it gets rarer close to the bone (e.g., medium rare would be rare near the bone).  So we ordered medium rare and medium accordingly.  The steak is large, savory and well-cooked, crispy on the outside and chewy melt in your mouth good on the inside.  We also had an appetizer of yellowtail tuna carpaccio that was little too citrusy, and definitely not as good as other tuna carpaccios in the city (such as Kabuto, for one). For sides we got onion rings that were big and crunchy and sauteed mushrooms that were good because they were drenched in butter.  In the end, it was a satisfying meal.

I AM a steak person. I eat my filet's on the rarer side of medium, I get a great red wine to wash it down with and I do it without regard for the price because it is the one weakness I don't want to fix. That being said, I will say again, this is the best steak in San Francisco. I've been 4 times in the last month and a half and not once has it been anything less than stellar. 420 Yelpers can't be wrong. To the good stuff... The Basil Martini is a must! You can get it sweet or not, either way it's great. I like it with more of a bite to it. I have had the bone-in filet and the petit filet, both are super. They cook it perfectly, without question and are smart enough to under cook it and cook up for you to get it right. The portobello mushroom saute is divine as well as the chard. I'm not really a dessert person, so I can't speak to that, but if it's red meat you're lookin for, don't wait... get over there. BTW... a friend and I decided to give it a shot on Valentine's Day... they worked us in, no problem. Very accommodating. I will say this though, if you make a reservation, plan to be seated 30-45 minutes late or make your reservation later and get there early. They work it out, but they aren't the most organized, I think it's because people enjoy themselves so much (ambiance and all) that they stay longer than anticipated... it's worth every second though!!", "author": "Amanda D."}

Started with the white tuna carpaccio, which was just ok to me.  I've had better.  I was getting my fill on the tasty garlic baked sourdough olive loaf.  Very oily but still good.  I had the filet mignon bone-in which is the most popular apparently.  I can see why.  It was delicious.  Unfortunately I was too full to sample any dessert.  I'll save that for next time.

The costini appetizer was tasty, with smoked salmon, crab and avacado on toasted bread. For the side dishes we had the twiced baked potato, which was also good. Drinks are little pricey, and I was disappointed that the bar didn't not have any kind of peach flavor liqour. Vanilla gelato with fresh berries were refreshing. All in all, a fantastic dinner but there was one thing. The service was disappointing. For such a highly recommended place, we were quite annoyed with the service. Our server was great in the beginning (when there weren't any other people dining around us), but when our food was served, it was horrible. We order another round of drinks, and it never came. By the time I had finished my food, I didn't want the drink (that hadn't arrived) and I was cranky I didn't have any more alcohol. Our server never asked us how the food was, and we needed extra sour cream for the potato. in my opinion, they need another server in her area when it starts to fill up. Patrons do not like to be ignored, especially when they need something. And especially when they're dropping this much money to eat here.

My parents and I once went to House of Prime Rib, which was elegant, but it was a tourist attraction compared to Bobo's --- is it classless of me to call it Bobo's for short? Well, I'm not really a fancy person myself, but I do enjoy fine dining, and this is the finest experience I've ever had. Thanks to the restaurant's website, I glanced through their menu in advance and the prices blew me away. But Bobo's schooled me on fine steak dining and fine dining in general.\n\nThe only reason I dock the one star is because I'm no expert on steaks, but I had the New York steak and it was the most flavorful slab of meat --- and dish in general --- that I've ever devoured. I started with asparagus and split a side dish of portabello mushroms with a friend, and the veggies were as flavorful as the steak. Oh, and the meat thing: I'm no meat-eater, at least not regularly. I was only here for a birthday dinner, but if I have to come here for someone else's special occasion again, there'll be no complaints from me. \n\nThe service was amazing: our server was attentive, conversational, and very accomodating. Some of the other guests in our party had some requests that I considered a bit finely particular (I like to be flexible and tolerant with restaurant service, myself), but our server tended to us in all the ways humanly possible. And getting drinks at the bar was an experience entirely separate from the dining, for the bartender was also exquisitely attentive and conversational, and the setting is so intimate that you could hang out there when it's not packed but probably still have a good time with a modest crowd. (Both our server and the bartender were women, and I wonder if the consistent quality of service is a kind of coincidence.) I had this cucumber drink thing (I couldn't pronounce the name for the life of me) that hit the spot in such a right way that I had to have a second glass during dinner and therefore I achieved just the right level of tipsiness.

(just sayin).  anyhoo, my steak was cooked perfectly again and so was my girl's.  the skillet mussels, were delish, the sides were all on point.  the steak had great flavor, and the side of mushrooms we ordered was a great compliment.  the service was on point.  hostess was busy but made eye contact with us immediately, and same with the bartender.  everyone was super nice.  we had some bubbly at the bar while we had a short wait for a table after our res.  and am i glad we waited, because they took us to a very nice table.  as for the server, i believe her name is Ilse, spelled i-l-s-e, (we were on the second floor i think), was on point.  she was a very nice lady, not over intrusive. we had four courses, all timed perfectly. she also made some good suggestions.  we never waited for any beverages.  and finally, free valet parking, nice touch.  this restaurant is great because they focus on things that are extremely important when it comes to food and beverage. eye contact, being hospitible while also being efficient, good quality food cooked correctly with good flavor, quick delivery of beverages, excellent timing of the courses, not making people wait without giving them some sort of direction, delicous warm bread brought without asking,  and making good decisions about making us wait a couple minutes for a better table.  the people that work here are able to make good decisions.  and nice little touches like free valet parking in the city, one less worry for their diners.  i have to say this place makes their guests feel important, and cares about food quality.  thank you for the memorable birthday experience.  totally erased the horrible experience from last year's birthday when we went to harris' steak house got stereotyped, and left due to the rude, smart mouthed hostess, who talked to us like she was shrugging off men trying to buy her a drink at a club.  lol.  we left before we tried the food.  we will definately be back to boboquivari's.", "author": "E E."}

We had a terrible experience.  The waiter was pretentious and inattentive.  Two tables that came after us got their bread and water before we did.  When he approached us to take our order, we were in the middle of a conversation, discussing what wine to order; he abruptly interrupted and asked if we were ready to order - not even waiting for us to take a breath - he interrupted again and asked \"are you ladies ready to order?\".  Apparently he was in a hurry.  We made our decision on the wine and he asked if we'd like it with our dinner or sooner and we replied \"as soon as possible\" - it didn't arrive until after we had finished our appetizers which were ordered at the same time as the wine and our dinner.   My appetizer was Lobster Soup in an extremely small cup.  There were large pieces of crab in it which would have been okay except both pieces of crab had not been properly cleaned and they still had cartilage in them - definitely not edible nor digestible!   When the waiter finally brought the wine, it appeared that he was not an experienced wine server and poured large portions into each of our glasses.  After toasting and taking one sip each, we had a horrific experience - my friend saw a RAT run under our table!  We both screamed and jumped up, knocking the table on the way up with all the liquids on the table spilling everywhere (the wall, the table, the chair and ME! ).  The waiter happened to be standing behind us at another table and upon seeing all the commotion, he non-nonchalantly opened the door that was next to our table that leads out to the Patio to let the critter out.   We heard one of the waitresses say \"it must have been a shadow\" - I hardly think the waiter would have opened the door to allow a \"shadow\" to escape.\n\nBeing a service provider myself, I always believe when something goes wrong its \" the recovery\" that makes or breaks a situation. . . . well, after ushering us downstairs and seating us in the bar area, they didn't bother to bring us bread or water and didn't offer to replace our wine.  We asked our new waitress if she'd been told about our experience and why we were now sitting in her section and she replied \"no\".  So, we proceeded to tell her and while she appeared sympathetic that's where it ended.  We asked the bus boy to get us the manager, which, after 10 minutes he/she never appeared.  When our new waitress made her way back to us, I asked her to see the manager and she replied \"I'm the manager\".  We were floored!  In a relatively expensive restaurant like that (any restaurant for that matter) we were shocked that no one but the customer bothered to let the manager know about the experience.   After we went into more detail with her than we had previously when we thought she was just our waitress, she offered to take care of the wine (which, after all the spillage upstairs only had two glasses left in it) and treat us to dessert.   \n\nWe left there with the impression that no one really cared about what we had experienced.     I'm told that many restaurants have critters circulating about and even if this is true, the customer should never see them.  There are health codes here after all.\n\nWe will definitely NOT be going back there.", "author": "Julie S."}

I've been to Harris', Bob's, Alfred's, Ruth Chris, Kincaids, Broadway Prime, Town.... Nothing comes close.  This is AMAZING melts in your mouth like butter steak.  I cannot stress how important it is to me that everyone experience the bone in filet, it will change your life for the better.", "author": "Danae D."}

Simply put, this is the best steak I've ever had.  I've been to all the steakhouses in SF, and many in New York and elsewhere, and this is by far superior.  (Worth noting, however, Bobo's only serves the filet mignon, New York and porterhouse, so if you're craving a prime rib, go to Harris', or House of Prime Rib if you can stand the tourists).  When you order, get the bone-in.  The beef is dry aged, so prepare your taste buds.  The filet is king - tender and jiucy, but respect to the New York, which has mucho gusto.  The sides are all good, I especially like the mushrooms, which are super garlickey, and go well with the steak.  The wine list is pretty good, and thank heavens for the full bar and tasty martinis.  The service is very friendly and attentive and never intrusive.  About the only negative is that the bar is a bit small, and getting reservations for Friday and Saturday nights is becoming harder.  So let's keep this place a secret.", "author": "Justin M."}
