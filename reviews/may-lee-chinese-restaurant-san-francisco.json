{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-21", "description": "This a good place if you're looking for something quick, cheap, and filling.  The food was okay.  Not amazing.  Just ok.  To be fair, I ordered the chicken with snow peas.  Maybe white meat and veggies are a blander dish in general, I don't know.  Probably they don't put MSG in the food, so maybe that's why it has a blander or milder taste, or it could have been what I ordered.  I'm not sure, but my chicken dish had a strangely shrimp-like aftertaste to it and something about the flavor mix just seemed a little odd.\n\nPros:\n*Variety of veggies in the dish that I ordered.  The chicken with snow peas had wood ear mushrooms, water chestnuts, carrots, and onions in addition to the snow peas.\n*Very fast service -  They had it ready in 2 minutes after I ordered (I was the only one in the restaurant at that point)\n*Authentic - You can tell by the menu and the dining arrangement that this place is just a hole in the wall by people who know exactly what they're doing and are making authentic Chinese food the way they would make it back home\n*Reasonably priced - My order came up to about $11 not including tip (I personally don't tip on to-go orders since I'm not getting table service)\n\nCons:\n*I arrived a half hour prior to closing, and they told me it was \"To Go Only\".  They didn't want to bother with table service even though I had a half an hour.  It seems that most of their business in fact comes from GrubHub and other delivery services.  They practically seemed shocked that someone would actually walk into their restaurant to eat, and want to sit down.\n*Food is okay.  Again, not great.  Just okay.  I'm out of my league here in trying to explain why.  I've had good Chinese and I've had great Chinese.  This wasn't bad.  But it wasn't great either.  \n\nSo again, if you're looking for fast, cheap, and filling, then this is the restaurant for you.  If you're looking to sit down somewhere nice and eat some of the best food in the city... maybe not.", "author": "Sarah R."}

I wanna tell you I take a very dim view of any restaurant where they don't welcome you when you walk in,it is rude, and is bad business etiquette. I was so surprised of how nice and professional the owner (Benson) was. He was extremely patient, friendly and informative. I told him what I like and I dont like and he told me what would be good to order. That is a really good way to deal with your customers. I really enjoyed my meal, so did my friend I came with. We had shrimp dumplings, string beans with chicken and rice. I was really impressed.  I will certainly be going back next time and would recommend it to all my friends.

May Lee's offers a similar kind of stereotypical Chinese food menu of chow mein, Mongolian beef, general's chicken etc... except that unlike Panda, it actually tastes like real Chinese food! \n\n[FOOD]\n\nI had intended to get the Mongolian beef because the pictures looked good, but I didn't pay attention to the captions and ended up accidentally getting the basil beef instead.  It turned out to be decent--not bad Sichaun style cooking, and I liked how it came with ample veggies, tofu, and a brown rice option.  It was a bit too oily for my tastes, but I guess the plus side is that it was filling enough to have easily fed me two meals.\n\nIf you're a picky eater, May Lee's is one of those Chinese restaurants that has a menu of endless choices--besides the typical Asian-American Chinese food (i.e. Panda menu), there is also legit Chinese food (like Singaporean fried noodles and moo shu), fancy Chinese food (like duck), and even a Japanese selection (though I'm not sure how good the sashimi is).  There are 20 lunch special options, all $8 and under including a spring roll, but no soup for take-out.  They also have reasonably priced catering trays--great for when you need to feed a lot of people for an event and you've brought Kiki's party trays too many times.\n\n[SERVICE]\n\nAll of May Lee's staff were friendly and efficient, despite Chinese restaurants' notoriety for bad service (perhaps I had RBF and scrutinized every corner like a Yelper during my wait, so they were trying to impress me?)   In any case, it was nice of them to frequently keep me updated on when my food would be ready, and they gave me an extra menu so that I could call my order in next time.  I found it amusing that they cycled through Canto/Mandarin/English each time they spoke to me as if they couldn't remember.  (FYI they are decently fluent in all 3, though the Mandarin hilariously sounds somewhat Canto-accented).\n\n[THE VERDICT]\n\nGood Chinese food, especially for 1) when you need leftovers 2) when you need a party tray 3) when you want Panda Express-type food without the actual Panda Express", "author": "Edna C."}

This dude shows up & claims that there's no tip, even though I know I added a $5 tip before checkout. Then he shows me a printout of the order which shows Tip: CASH. And I say No, let me run upstairs & get my phone (while the food is getting cold). So I show him the delivery receipt & clearly we have a discrepancy... he tries telling me that the $2 coupon is not on his paper (I can see that), and blahblahblah, ad infinitum... (I do not speak Chinese but I've been eating Chinese food in SF for over 30 years & I know a con man when I see one.) So THEN this guy gets on the phone (with the restaurant?) talking about another order--this is all part of the act to wear me down & get me to throw cash at him so he'll get out of my doorway--and yes, that is, in fact... what. I. do. \n\nI gave him the 4 bucks in my wallet & I will not be ordering from May Lee again. It feels like harassment just getting the food on my table... every time.\n\nThe food, BTW, is loaded with MSG, but that's typical -- won't kill ya.

Their delivery is usually right on time, not to long and not super quick. We usually get the same thing every time we order, chicken w/ string beans, crab cheese puffs, kung pow chicken, and a sushi roll. Comes out to around $40 including tip for the driver. Good thing about May Lee's is that they have coupon deals for different amounts that you spend. We usually use the coupon code for $30 which is free chicken fried rice or chicken chow mein. Don't get the lemon chicken, onion pancakes, or mandrin (mandarin?) chicken wings, Baddd. \n\n11/11/12\n\nwe placed an online order through May lee's website and the time was 7pm we waited until 8:05 before we called them. They are on 7th we live on 20th and from previous times we ordered it usually takes around 35-45 mins for them to show up. When May Lee's picked up the phone we asked them what the current status of our deliver was, they said that they had some back orders so they are running late but the driver is on the way. 20 mins later the food arrives so totally time 1 hour and 25 mins. We unpack everything and notice that they left out an item so we call back and the May Lee's said oh sorry let me take down your phone number and address and we will give it to you for free the next time you order. Didn't want to start an argument so w/e, forget it. The other food items were all okay, we got the mandrin chicken wings and it was edible, but upon eating the 3rd wing there was something on the chicken and it was soo stringy and stiff, couldn't figure out what it was. \n\n- 1 star : really greasy\n- 1 star : never reading the comment box (every time i leave a comment seems to be disregarded) \n- 1 star : some times the chicken has a subtle taste to it that makes me second guess the freshness.\n+ 1 star : big portions, a bang for your buck\n+ 1 star : cheap and has coupon deals\n\ni'll post again if i decided to order from them again, and see if they actually remember  to include my \"free\" (since i already paid for it) item.", "author": "Lily S."}

Restaurants HATE delivering to the Island, and when I am stuck in the office alone, I can't go anywhere to get food.\n\nLo and behold, my coworker once ordered from May Lee's and left their to-go/delivery menu on my desk.  After realizing that a cup-o-noodles just wasn't going to do it for me, I dialed their # and decided to place an order.\n\nDepending on where you are, the minimum ranges from $10-30.  For me, since I'm located in the middle of the bay, I had to ring up a total of $30, plus they had to throw in an extra $4 because it's, well, in the middle of the bay.  So really the total had to only be $26.  Knowing that Japanese food is more expensive than Chinese food, I decided to go with that, rather than order like 18 things of Chinese food.\n\nI ordered a rainbow roll ($9.95), edamame ($3.25), salmon sashimi (8 pc. for $10.95) and a spicy tuna roll ($5.75).  Tax and tip and everything came out to a little over $40, which is pretty decent for the amount of food I got, plus the convenience of not having to leave my office.\n\nWhen they delivered the bag, I found 3 pairs of chopsticks.  Way to go for making me feel like a fatty.\n\nSurprisingly their sushi was very good and fresh.  The salmon sashimi was a good size, and everything was still chilled (probably helped that it was cold outside).  The rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll were both decent as well, and my only complaint was with the edamame, which was generally flavorless.\n\nAll in all, plus points for being friendly, fast and relatively cheap.  More bonus points for delivering to Treasure Island and taking credit cards.  The whole process was super simple, and I'll definitely be ordering from them again when I feel hunger pangs at work!", "author": "Tori S."}

We get food delivered from them all the time, it's our guilty pleasure, and I would keep ordering food from them. However, the reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 5, is that they have gotten my orders wrong about 30% of the time (gave me beef instead of chicken, broccoli instead of tofu, etc).  We ordered everything online so I know they definiltey got the correct item names sent to them online, I just wish they would pay attention to the details a little more.  Honestly, I so wish I can give them 4 or 5 stars, because I really do like their food and the delivery service is consistent, but it's incredibly frustrating when you pay for delivered food then realized it's not what you ordered.

I wanted to try San Tung but it was bursting at the seams with people, hungry Chinese people. I hope I can try it someday. I tried Golden Chopsticks across the street but they were only offering their lunch menu. Tracing back my footsteps back to 7th ave I kneel at the wooden menu board and make my decision, veggie chow mein and veggie egg rolls please. Ten minutes later two piping hot boxes of yummy are nestled in my arms and I march diligently back through Kezar Stadium, back up steep Stanyan, and back to my warm nest. This travel took about 25 minutes and when I unfolded the boxes I received a wok breath facial from the hot steam. \nI've decided cheap, greasy, fast American-Chinese food simply tastes best on an empty stomach and low debit account. I think this is the best veggie chow mein I've ever tasted chock full of mushroom slices, crunchy water chestnut. broccoli, celery, gai lan, and cabbage. I asked for them to make it spicy and they make it spicy. The only thing I'm bummed about was the lack of duck sauce to slather my veggie egg rolls in. Regardless, they were neat and tasty and less than $1 each. \n\nI wonder why they serve Japanese food too? Perhaps they thought it would be a good idea to offer cheap American-Japanese food...

I've lived all over the city [and in China for a time] and tried just about every Chinese place here in SF I can think of. \n\nThis place rocks when it comes to *delivery* food. Yes, there are better Chinese restaurants here in the city, but ask them to deliver food as hot, fresh and on time as these guys? It's not going to happen. \n\nCompared with other restaurants within their price range, this place stands right at the top of the rest of the places here in SF as it pertains to quality.\n\nYes, like every small take out place they have their strengths and weaknesses.... Every take out/delivery restaurant does. Sometimes spices are hotter then before and sometimes they are not. But compared to every take-out or delivery restaurant I've tried here in the city [regardless of the type of cuisine] May Lee's is VERY consistent.\n\nThe food is ALWAYS hot, and freshly cooked. The delivery guys are ALWAYS fast....scary fast as the matter of fact. How they get the food to my place in the time that they do always surprises me. I tend to tip the drivers big because I don't live close to them anymore, and appreciate the effort it takes to come to where I live. They seem to appreciate it, and accordingly continue to provide excellent customer service when I call. \n\nThe restaurant itself is SMALL. I think they have two tables. It's obviously a family-owned place, intended to make it's money on pick-up orders and deliveries [like many Chinese places in China Town]. \n\nFor Chinese delivery at the price point that May Lee's falls into, they get 5 Stars.", "author": "David P."}

We didn't even have to leave home, yay!\n\nYes, May Lee's has calmed our craving for Chinese food. We ordered a few items that stood up to the challenge.\n~ Combo Chow Mein: My only beef is that there were not enough shrimp, but that doesn't mean it wasn't delicous! :-)\n~ Sesame Chicken: This was different from most of the sesame chicken I've had, but it worked.  I liked that it had it's own style and brought the heat.\n~ Sweet & Sour Chicken: It's sweet & sour chicken, not much to say. It was very good though. I have had some sweet and sour chicken dishes that tasted like ass!\n~ Hot & Sour Soup: This was one of the best Hot and Sour soups I've ever had. There was a lot of stuff in the soup, including large pieces of mushroom, tofu, and delicious egg.\n\nThis wasn't the best Chinese food we've had, but it still was good. My girlfriend and I will definitely be ordering again from May Lee's.  their fast, friendly delivery made it even easier.\n\nA hardy thanks!", "author": "Nick R."}

First of all they fucked up on my order \nthe spicy tuna roll wasnt even spicy, the rolls where falling apart. The rice used to make the roll wasnt even sushi rice ( the vinegar rice) it was just regular white rice.\n\nThey gave us Tempura Shrimp instead of tempura shrimp roll that we order, jacking up the price. The terriyaki Beef wasnt even grilled it was deep fried and was oily and disguesting. \n\nIve had better food at fastfood places in the mall then this shit hole.

We have had their food more times than we can count over the course of three or four years. \"So why is she giving them 1 star if she's been going there for years?\" Well, the answer is because their food has gone down hill BIG TIME this year. May Lees is not a dine in location, you either take your food to go or you have them deliver, and they are Speedy Gonzales delivery. We live 5 blocks away and we get our order within 10-15 minutes. \nMay Lee's used be great because I would get their Chinese and my boyfriend would get their sushi and it was good food, which was good quality AND low cost. But something changed this year. We got food last night and their chicken and beef was inedible. The meat was hard and unappetizing. I pushed the chicken to the side and ate the rest of the food, and this has been consistent over the past few orders.  I would highly recommend finding another spot until they get their act together.", "author": "Hedieh G."}

But, this place did not exist when I lived in the neighborhood, otherwise, I'd surely would've tried it by now.  \nOn a whim, we stopped for take-out and I recognized a dude going back into the house next door to my old apt building.  I couldn't believe he still lived there after all these years....\nBack to May Lee's.  A hole in the wall smack in the middle of 7th Avenue with nothing but residential buildings.  Like a pineapple in the middle of a ski slope.  There are 2 tables for 4 and one more in the back which the staff was using to make eggrolls and won ton (the ingredients were laid out on the table).  \nEvidently, they do most of their business in take-out.  The driver came back in his down jacket, washed his hands and proceeded to help out in the kitchen (still with his down jacket on, probably ready for a quick get away when he has to hit the road to deliver).  It's a mom-pop business with delivery all over the city she told me, even Treasure Island for an extra $4.00 fee and minimum $10 purchase.  No checks accepted, credit cards OK.\nWe took home the lunch specials (M-Sa before 4PM) of Mongolian beef ($6.25) over rice which was more yellow and green onions than beef.  It was spicy enough but not memorable; combo chow mein ($6.50) which was soggy and had beef, chicken and fried shrimp in it (didn't like this one) and broccoli beef over rice ($5.95) which was OK.   \nI'm not sure what type of restaurant it is, as they serve sushi/Japanese food too (nigiri, sashimi, maki roll, vegan & combo sushi/sashimi)  Everyone in the kitchen was speaking Cantonese.  \nDidn't need to use the bathroom but I did hear a dad ask for soap for his daughters to wash their hands.  That was enough to make me not wanna use the bathroom.", "author": "Ry T."}

My husband and I went to pick up the food, and the man in charge there rudely insisted there was no way we had ordered food.  It wasn't until I showed him the confirmation email I had, that he changed his mind insisting that I had asked for delivery, and that the food was on its way to my house.  Once I showed him in the email showing that I had asked to pick it up he had to call his driver to bring it back to the restaurant, while we waited there.  Fine, OK, we got our food and while we were annoyed we moved on.  Next stop sitting down to eat with family, my husbands orange chicken is missing.  We had a lot of food so we went with out, and after dinner I called the store to tell them it was missing, and I was coming back because I wanted my money back.  The man on the phone just kept saying that he would send me orange chicken now, and didn't want to listen when I said I no longer wanted the food.  So we showed up at the restaurant for my refund and the same man that was difficult at the beginning was there, and insisted the orange chicken wasn't missing, basically calling me a liar when I assured him it was not in our bag.  He then proceeded to huff and puff when giving me my money back.  Overall I will not be returning here ever, while the food was OK enough, the service was so terrible.  Not to to mention, the inside of the restaurant leaves much to be desired in the way of perceived cleanliness.  Sorry May Lee's, I used to really like your place, but you've surely lost us as customers.", "author": "Kristen B."}

I noticed most of the comments were for delivery which I am suspicious of so I walked there and ordered. As I looked around I noticed there was quite a bit of food on the floor and the place is coated in a layer of grease. There is cardboard over the rubber mats in the kitchen apparently to soak up the grease but I don't think that is considered sanitary. The guy hand-making some kind of dumplings sneezed a few times and wiped his hands with a paper towel but did not wash them. I did eat the food I ordered which was pretty average but all I could think of later was how filthy the kitchen was and if I was hours away from contacting the norovirus.", "author": "Chris H."}
