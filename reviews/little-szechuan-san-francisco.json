I believe the cooks are also Cantonese that's why they make the classic Szechuan dish nowhere like a Szechuan dish. \nWe ordered Shredded pork /w garlic sauce (\u9c7c\u9999\u8089\u4e1d) and Beef boiled /w flaming chilli oil (\u6c34\u716e\u725b\u8089).\nThe shredded pork is a classic Szechuan dish and it's very easy to tell if it's authentic or Americanized or else. First, the pork was off-taste due to bad preservation; second, the flavor was too sweet and even worse than the Americanized version. I would give it 1 star.\nThe boiled beef was decent. The flavor was good and tasted like what I had in China. The beef was a bit too chewy. I would give it 4 stars.\nSo on average, the food ranges from 2 to 3 stars. But the service was also bad, every time, we needed to wave to the server several times to raise her attention, although we were the only customers in the restaurant.", "author": "Zhongjie W."}

These were meaty, but not very soupy. Also, the sauce didn't have any ginger which I missed. I still made it work with some green onions and hot sauce I had at work. I tried the beef pancake and it was okay. My coworker liked the hoisin sauce in it as it was reminiscent of a peking duck bun. I didn't try the lunch special, but I think it was enjoyed by all.

Some of us don't eat meat (me), soy or nuts (cousin's deathly allergic), spicy (aunt), etc etc. Most places would've rolled their eyes and said, seriously? But not here!

Shout out to their amazingly patient and accommodating staff! \n\nMy fav dishes here are: salt and pepper fish (perfectly crispy and slightly spicy), boiled fish in spicy oil (SO good), pea sprout veggies (has just the right bite to it), and hot and sour soup (spicy to vinegar ratio is on point). ALSO, yest we tried their honey walnut calamari...never had this anywhere before, but it was super delicious! We even asked for the walnuts on the side bc of my cousin, and they said no problemo.

With care, they put them in these nice reusable containers, custard tins to maintain shape, and present overall, very well. \n\nFood is hot, tasty, fresh, and made with good quality ingredients. Definitely vegetarian friendly as well. Will keep this at the top of my list for delivery or party orders in the near future. \n\nReasonable pricing for pot stickers, both meat and veg ($7.98), soup dumplings (6 for $7.98!!) , egg rolls (3 for $4.98), and crab rangoons (6 for $7.98). \n\nGreat for party appetizers, small bites for a team shindig, or family-style meal sharing. I would feel comfortable using this business to cater a happy hour party since their delivery timeliness and presentation was so great. \n\nFree delivery on Eat24 with $35 or more, and with an order that large, you also get a free side of pot stickers (a deal of $7.98) so it's a good option for a group/party order. Be sure to follow-up with Eat24 and/or the restaurant direct if you order for an advanced date, so they do not confuse a future order date with the date you placed the order (this occurred and the delivery person did not speak English so I could not explain the situation mix-up on their end, and the food was just dumped our lobby).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-07", "description": "This place just screams tourist trap in SF Chinatown, but if you walk inside, you will definitely find your fair share of Chinese diners. The interesting part is that the staff do not speak Cantonese but speak Mandarin, which is unusual for SF Chinatown, but it is Szechuan food so that more than makes sense. Not that that has any bearing on the restaurant, but I suppose that means they know how to make Szechuan food.\nAnyway, the decor is really well done and the inside looks like new. We were seated right away but when we tried to ask in Cantonese about the lunch special that was advertised outside, they said to wait one minute and then never came back to our table. A Mandarin speaking family was seated well after us who had their orders taken well before us and served drinks. I was angered by this and ready to get up, but my boyfriend insisted that we sit down. After what must have been 20 minutes after the Mandarin family was served, a waitress came over and tried to take our order in English. We told her we wanted the lunch special menu and so, she had to give it to us and leave yet again to let us look at the menu. Btw, this menu isn't actually handed out during the weekends unless you ask. So many points off for this experience already. The restaurant wasn't even busy, but I did see someone waiting for a takeout order get frustrated by the wait to order and pick up the food.\nWhen we finally ordered, the food came out in a timely manner. I got the mapo tofu, my favorite Szechuan dish that I've even enjoyed in Beijing (with some...pain). The mapo tofu here lacked the spice I was looking for though. I enjoyed it, but it just wasn't spicy enough. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal at least and we had a good time together once we were finally served.\nSo..I would say this place is good for the food if you order spicy, but the service sucks. Ask for your food to be extra spicy! If you don't like spicy, you are in the wrong restaurant though...", "author": "Jenn T."}

When I came into the restaurant and after I got seated, the waiters gave us some peanuts as appetizers, which I thought was pretty nice. I scanned the menu and saw the only dish that appealed to me was the Pork Spare Ribs with Sour Pickle Noodle Soup. To be honest, I really only wanted the sour pickle noodle soup but not really pork spare ribs (I was have preferred to see other types of protein on there, otherwise I would've been fine if there was no meat at all). As one of the few places in Chinatown that serves Szechuan food, I was okay with the fact that there were limited options when it came to meat toppings since I primarily came for the sour pickle noodle soup. The fried spare ribs went nicely with the sour pickle noodle soup, but I think the sourness wasn't really emphasized since there were very few pickles in there. The noodles were nice and the broth tasted mellow. I was expecting this dish to be overwhelmingly sour but I think that is a misunderstanding on my part since I thought the sourness was infused into the soup. \n\nThe service was a little slow, but taking into account that I only saw three workers there out in the front, I think this is to be expected.

The order arrived lightening-fast, hot and well-packed. \n\nWe ordered: \n\n- scallion pancakes (savory, flakey, perfectly crisp)\n\n- General Tso chicken (good quality meat, and perfectly crisp - but the tasty sauce was slightly too... gloopy for my taste)\n\n- beef w/broccoli (perfectly cooked broccoli, great light sauce. I wish the beef had s more \"seared\" taste/appearance as steamed beef isn't very appealing)\n\n- vegetarian hot and sour soup (skip it)\n\n- vegetarian egg rolls (very tasty, fresh, and crisp)\n\nIn short, not a bad pick for delivery, but I'm sure there are better options available.", "author": "Erica A."}

I would have NEVER known about this place. It's separated from the restaurant upstairs. The space is an open canvas - my friend laid out the logistics fairly well. There was a TV, music, no bar but area we managed to turn into a bar. Six large round tables fitting 10 people each and nearly a server for each table with a 13 course meal. I kid you not!

We were the only table until a small group came off a tour bus. Then two other two person tables eventually came in. I liked the darkness of the furniture and the ambiance because it didn't feel like your typical red and gold Chinese place. It was a little more upscale with a bar and wine bottles lined up and even the restrooms are fancier than most (left over from the previous place I'm sure). However, the service was not very attentive until the actual server arrived about 45 min later and the food was less than average but came out really fast. We started off with the Triple Dumplings. They miscounted the dumplings as we were missing one. They were ok tasting. I could taste the flavor of the Mushroom one though I didn't get much flavor from the other two. The server didn't say what they were when he set them down. The Spicy Green Beans were crunchy and tasty and not too oily. I didn't care too much for their Pork Noodle Soup or Xiao Long Bao because it was all quite bland. Everything was edible but I don't think I'll be back with so many better choices around.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-01-03", "description": "Since this was a new Sichuan place in Chinatown, I felt that I should come check it out and see if it really was worth the recent praises. Being that this place used to be a night club, the decor and setup were definitely very different from a typical Chinese place. The inside is still very dark; I realize they are trying for a more classy feel, but it feels very out of place with the type of food served. Even if it's supposed to high-class Chinese food, which I don't think it really is. The booths were just chairs instead of actual booth cushions, the water glasses seemed more appropriate for mixed drinks, the paint job looked half-finished, the \"Chinese\" decorations were way overdone, and they just kept playing \"Say Something\" on repeat. Very strange and very different experience.\n\nFood was also somewhat underwhelming, especially for the prices. I was hoping for the lunch menu, which I saw online, but we came here at noon on a Friday and didn't get one. Much of the menu seemed to be regular Americanized Chinese food. We ended up ordering one appetizer, the Five Spices Beef Roll, was not so much Five Spices as it was lukewarm instead of hot, soft instead of crispy, and weirdly sweet inside instead of flavorful. And this came out 10 minutes after our main entree too, which was fairly confusing. \n\nThe fish fillet boiled in chili broth (shuizhu yu) was the order I was most looking forward to. Appearance-wise it was not bad and seemed quite large, with an abundance of chili peppers. After tasting it though, I felt largely disappointed. Despite all the chili, it was not nearly spicy enough, and more importantly it was not mouth-numbing (ma) enough. The broth itself was mostly fish and chili, and very devoid of vegetables, of which it should have a decent amount. \n\nWhile waiting for our food, we were wondering if our water would be refilled, but eventually we had to call a waiter over. At which point, they just brought the entire water bottle and placed it on our table. Why not just do that to begin with?\n\nI acknowledge that Sichuanese food is rare otherwise in SF. Also because they are new, so I am hoping they will improve as time goes on. But I will give a while before I go back there, if ever.", "author": "Tony D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-15", "description": "Coming in here on a Sunday night was interesting as this place was maybe half full.  I had made a reservation for my party of 8, but it ended up not being needed (if you have a large party, you should probably always call ahead anyway, however).  Upon arrival and throughout the night, the staff was very attentive, friendly, and overall doing a good job.  We noticed during the dinner some people came in from a tour and gave the staff some attitude - the situation didn't escalate and was dealt with quickly, so good job done there.  It's nice anywhere when a restaurant isn't busy - you'll get your food quickly and better follow-up service (which we did).  The interior is nice and there are some TVs for sports at the bar - visible to the whole restaurant.  There's also a downstairs area that I didn't get to see, I'm assuming for larger parties or when the restaurant fills up.\n\nWe tried to get a big sampling of the menu, and most of the food was very good:\n\nA5 Pot Stickers - kind of difficult to screw this one up.  They didn't have enough sear for my taste, but overall wasn't bad.\n\nA15 Salt and Pepper Calamari - good seasoning, well cooked, good portion size (would've liked more but it is an appetizer).\nB5 Sliced Pork with Spicy Garlic Sauce - one of the table favorites - the pork was cooked perfectly and still moist, while the sauce was a great focal point.  Enough for all 8 people to try a few bites, and a very strong flavor.  Would recommend, especially if you like garlic.\n\nF17 Pork Intestine Boiled with Flaming Chili Oil - the #1 dish at the table.  I personally love intestines, and have had it in most Asian countries.  It was a difficult sell to my semi-adventurous group, especially because it also looked like it was at spice level 10.  The intestine was so juicy and was just popping with flavor - overcooked intestine can turn rubbery/chewy real fast, and this was both chewy and tender at the same time.  The broth was great as well.  A must try, especially if you've never had intestine before.\n\nJ2 Braised Crispy Chicken with Red Chili Oil - chicken was juicy and flavorful, and with a beautiful presentation.  Spice level was a bit lower than I expected and the chicken could have been crispier.\n\nK2 Ma Po Tofu - I had a problem with this one, as I've had different Ma Po Tofus around the world including in Chengdu.  The spice level was just not even close to what I would expect - this dish should be numbing your mouth, and I was barely feeling the heat.  The sauce was a bit thin as well, and the tofu itself could have been cooked a bit longer.  I had a chat with the manager afterwards about it and cleared this up - it was probably partially my fault for not specifying the spice level I wanted (although I was never asked).  I've also had ground meat included in this dish almost every other time I've had it, and this was a vegetarian version of it - so that was just my preference.  I would expect a Szechuan restaurant to execute this dish perfectly, and next time I go back I'll ask for the real deal - I'll update my review accordingly.\n\nK11 Pea Sprouts with Garlic - expertly cooked, with a ton of flavor and a crispiness that is required for Chinese vegetables.  Would order again.\n\nR4 Orange Beef - cloying flavor, reminded me a little bit of Chinese fast food.  I didn't choose this one, I probably wouldn't again.  Portion was a bit small.\n\nR13 Cumin Lamb - cooked well, a bit on the tough side, but good flavor here too - veggies were a mix of soft and crispy.  Enough for everyone to try a little bit.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the dinner and everyone else did too.  Good food, good service, and I met the manager who spoke to me about my food concerns listed above.  Not as good as what you'd find in Chengdu, but a good option if you're in the North Beach area.  I'll come back to get the real Mapo Tofu experience in the future.  I'll probably try a few other Szechuan places first to get a comparison.", "author": "Ben K."}

It's been over a year since I last visited here (not by choice) but I remember it like it was yesterday. Honestly you can't find good Szechuan in LA and this blew away anything you could scrounge up in our Chinatown. This was my first time in The City so being able to experience their Chinatown and hopefully what I perceived to be \"authentic\" was a great immersion in a new culture. It was like being transplanted to a whole new part of the world. Anyway, we walked in and they were not busy at all, and I really liked the overall ambiance, dark furniture red accents, friendly staff. \nWe sat down and we're given these little spicy nuts to nibble on while we looked at the menu and they were so tasty. First I ordered the passionfruit smoothie to drink. It was my first time trying passion fruit and this was the place where I fell in love with it. It had a jumbo straw which I though was fun. I don't remember what my then boyfriend got to drink but honestly it was forgettable compared to my passionfruit delight. Then we started ordering food. I stuck to what I knew which was orange chicken and my bf got beef and broccoli. For sides we got fried rice of course and veggie chow mein. We also got egg rolls and I think a couple other things which I can't quite recall but I can tell you everything I put in my mouth I liked. The orange chicken had this delicate, light breading but still crispy--it was like nothing I've ever tasted and I'm not exaggerating. I must say, the sauce was of the chaiiin good and I sometimes wish to make that 6 hour drive just to go up there for lunch. The chow mein noodles were so good the veggies were cooked but still had a crunch and the sauce was delicious. I even liked my mans beef and broccoli and I usually am not a fan. The egg rolls also had a light crispy exterior and I remember loving every bite I took.

Their menu has a selection of standards as well as Szechuan specialties. Their standards are fine, but if you want something spicy, go with one of the specialties! \n\nWe got the green onion pancake, triple delight dumplings, honey walnut prawns, and lamb boiled with flaming chili oil. All were decent, or better. Three were standard. One was not.\n\nThe lamb boiled with flaming chili oil came in a HUGE dish. It was a bit more soupy than at other Szechuan restaurants, but it still had a mouth-numbing blend of peppers and peppercorns, with cilantro and bean sprouts.  The lamb (yes, it actually was lamb--I could tell by the gamey taste) was nice and tender, and soaked up the spices. This dish was massive...it could have fed two people easily, and was only $15.\n\nThe honey walnut prawns were good, although it's hard to mess those up. Adding broccoli was a nice touch. The onion pancakes were good. The dumplings were alright...I've had better at most dim sum restaurants.\n\nWe also saw a table that had a big rectangular container with a boiling whole fish with Szechuan spices and peppers. We'll have to order that next time!\n\nExtra points for having brown rice.\n\nService was fine. Having bottles of water at the tables was a nice touch. We were seated promptly and they gave us time to look at the menu before taking our order. The food came out pretty quickly, everything at once.

The braised chicken with jalape\u00f1os (J2) is also really good and authentic. The mapo tofu is good. The spring pea shoots is the best vegetables (and it isn't spicey). If you're adventurous, B1 (Spicy Chili Combination of Beef & Intestine) is authentic and solid. \n\nThis place has a corkage fee but it's a great place to bring a nice bottle of white to cut the spice down.

I revisited this place where has always been my favorite while I was living there. All the good memories came back with the great food, it was such a delight. When I was leaving, my uber driver called me so I left in a hurry. As a result, I left my $$150 earphone on the table.

The guy who was picking up the phone sounded so happy, as soon I said the word earphone, he shouted \"Yes! The color is black!\" Obviously they were waiting for me to call them back. He said he can't do anything unless I go and grab it. It was Sunday, 2 hours before I depart from my trip back to Honolulu. Then he forwarded me to a lady named Nikki, and she helped me to mail my earphone. Two days later, my earphone was there sitting right in my mail box with a FedEx envelop. (Of course I paid for it later)\n\nWell, it's hard to find something so neatly thought out in this fast moving world.

Z&Y's way better\n\nRed oil wontons--same issue as Mapo Tofu--has some red oil, but otherwise, the sauce didn't have garlic, nor any vinegar or sugar (at least not that I could detect).  To summarize, a bit bland. And the wonton skins were pretty thick.  Texture closer to dumplings than paper thin wontons.  Definitely Z&Y here\n\nCold cucumber...not sure if Z&Y has this dish (or I haven't ordered it).  I was expecting something extremely light (i.e., just garlic and cucumber), but it had some vinegar and chili oil with it.  Flavor was good, although a bit vinegary for me (note, I'm super sensitive to sour flavors)--my wife liked this dish fine.  \n\nOne major caveat--they did deliver to our hotel....however, I've also had Z&Y takeout, so I don't think that was a major factor in my evaluation.  \n\nLet the debate continue!!", "author": "Howard T."}

The hot pot is not unlimited and you have to pay per serving. The meat slices are thick and frozen, does not feel fresh. What is more ridiculous is that they charges us one dollar for each of the sauce we got for the hot pot! Seriously!

The service was really quite friendly. \n\nI'm a bit of a skeptic so I'll say it like this, our server, Bobby, made us feel like we were being treated well with little treats here and there (free refills on rice bowls and free tea). I'm not sure if they were actually treats, but he said they were. Someone should check for me. I felt great in the moment. A girl just wants to feel good, y'know?\n\nI thought the food was a good mix of authentic and americanized. Got some cold Sichuan styled chicken that was tasty. Also had some shredded pork, bok choy with garlic and crispy, spicy garlic prawns. First two were pretty simple, and the prawns were a bit expensive and few in number (that's how it is, though). In hindsight, I would have liked everything to have been more spicy, but they did offer that avenue in the beginning, so I find only myself to blame.\nBobby told me he rated most of it as a 6 out of 10 in spiciness, so take that as you will. If you like a good kick, I would suggest asking for extra spicy.\n\nCheers, Bobby.", "author": "Robbie Z."}

I asked waitress to get dishes later but she didn't quite understand.  \n3) The water bottle was kept on my table as soon as we arrived but I had to ask 4 times for glasses. This was in spite of the fact that restaurant didn't have much crowd. I can understand if they are full but with three tables occupied it was unacceptable.\n4) The last thing, this restaurant location shady.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-04", "description": "My favorite thing about Little Szechuan is the variety of dishes that they have. It's a great place to bring a group of people, not only because the restaurant itself is large and spacious, but because as long as everyone is wanting Eastern flavors, they're sure to find something palatable. \n\nThe place is, as I said, spacious and done up in highly lacquered reds and blacks. It's definitely more upscale than other Chinese restaurants, although I still usually get takeout because the lack of windows and color palette makes the restaurant too dark for me. It almost feels more like a bar and less like a restaurant. \n\nThe wait staff is decent. They are very good about taking your order and bringing food, although they could be a bit more attentive about filling up water glasses, especially since their spicy dishes are rather spicy.\n\nThe food itself is overall quite tasty, nicely prepared and heavy on the spices. The portions are really great, as is the pricing. It's definitely on the low end of \"$$\". I would suggest ordering their more unusual or regional dishes, as their generic Americanized ones taste about the same as any Chinese take-out place. The presentation is prettier and the rice is fluffier, but basically it's the exact same flavors and cooking techniques.\n\nI've had the Tan tan noodles, which was delicious but so full of anise that my tongue was numb halfway through the meal. Their sesame chicken was nicely prepared and had a good crunch. My go-to is definitely the spicy beef noodle soup. It's so warming and hearty and oh so filling. The only big negative about the food at Little Szechuan is that some dishes randomly do not come with any vegetables. My sesame chicken lunch special was a large scoop of rice and a large scoop of the chicken. I think there was an orange slice garnish, but that made for an unbalanced-feeling meal.\n\nOh! And the lunch special is very worthwhile, although offered on weekdays. Noticeably cheaper, just as filling, and it comes with a little cup of hot + sour soup. The end.", "author": "Jasper P."}

No flavor. I can't believe they got this wrong -- even the most mediocre Sichuan restaurants in the bay can get this right\n- chongqing la zi ji - this is the dry fried chicken cooked in a lot of chili peppers and sichuan peppercorn. Their version was not spicy, slightly bitter/off tasting, felt really greasy, and just... blech. My friends complained that it just didn't have much chicken, though the chicken:pepper ratio seemed alright to me.\n- \"beef cooked in water\" - I forget what they call this in the English translation, but in Chinese this is \"shui zhu niu rou\". This was also not very spicy, and the dish itself felt smaller than what I was expecting. I'm also used to a version that has napa at the bottom, and this did not, which was kind of a disappointment \n\nWe also got:\n- scallion pancakes - this was probably the best dish of the meal, no joke. It also came out last, well after we had dug into all our other dishes, despite having ordered everything at the same time.\n- sauteed mustard greens - this was probably the second best dish of the meal. I'm glad they did not screw up saut\u00e9ing veggies in garlic. \n- a pickled cabbage appetizer - my friend remarked that it was much sweeter than what he was expecting. I have no baseline for this, so take it with a grain of salt.\n- rice - same old, same old.\n\nIf you're looking for regular old American-y Chinese food, this place might be alright. The dishes that looked like sesame/orange chicken looked normal when I saw them on other people's tables. However, if you're a hunter of delicious Sichuan food, I'd go elsewhere.

Aside from the beef dish, we also ordered the spicy fried chicken (can't remember the exact name). Each piece of chicken had a chunk of pure salt on it. If I wanted to taste the ocean, I would have went to the beach instead. I would have given this place one star if the manager didn't give us a replacement dish. There are way better sichuan restaurants in the bay area, particularly in the east. Go to the one in Albany which is a Michelin recommended!! I will never recommend this place to anyone.", "author": "Chris K."}

I love the nice yet simple atmosphere with great service & reasonable prices.  They serve some of the best Szechwan & Cantonese cuisine in the area; so, weather you are in the mood for something spicy & something mild or one or the other, there is something for everyone.  The pot stickers are crispy golden wiwith a well seasoned ground pork, ginger, & cabbage filling; perfect with a little soy sauce over the top.  The spicy wontons are perfect with a thin wrapper & a wonderful ground pork filling with a tongue tingling sinus cleaning chili sauce.  The green onion pancake is thin, crispy, & greqasless with the perfect dough to onion ratio; perfect with the dipping sauce that comes with it.  The black pepper sizzling beef platter is wonderful with tender marinaded beef, fresh zuchini, onions, & peppers in a wonderful black pepper sauce; my cousins were wowed about how he brought out the sizzling platter & then scooped everything onto itl; needles to say, watching it sizzle & the wonderful smell caught there attension.  The tan tan noodles are aldentae with well seasoned ground pork & onions in a spicy amoky peanut sauce that packs a one two punch.  The prawns with honey walnuts were wonderful with suculent prawns, a lite badder, & just the write amount of mayonaisse with crispy honey walnuts.  My mother & cousins enjoyed the chicken egg foo young & chicken fried rice as those are not my favorite things to get.  Round it off with a couple Tsing Taos & you will not be disappointed.  Our waiter fchecked in with us to see how everything was periodically & we loved the 70's funk they had going on Iheart Radio.  So, for excellent Szechwan & Cantonese cuisine with friendly service in a nice yet casual atmosphere, Little Sichuan cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys..", "author": "Brian S."}

In retrospect, yes, we should have put some cash down for the drinks we actually received and walked out. However, after waiting ten minutes, fifteen minutes, thirty, forty and so on we figured our food would shortly arrive, like the waiters we talked to told us. Ultimately, we received our food and we were absolutely starving at that point. Even then, the food was mediocre at best.

The music was a fun mix of pop music, new and old. The staff in the restaurant was so friendly to us and went out of their way to see how we liked the food.

Every item we had was well seasoned and authentically prepared. The menu offers an extensive variety of classic Szechuan dishes. We ordered a total of 4 dishes between the three of us, and it was plenty of food. If you've never tried Szechuan food before, your mouth is in for a taste and sensory adventure!\n\nI'm a pretty adventurous eater and wanted to try something new in spite of my dining companions' dubious expressions. We started the meal with two of the cold plates-  Bean Jello in Red Chili Sauce, and Spicy Beef Tendon. The chili sauce in the bean jello dish was delicious! Spicy, garlicky, salty,  in just the right balance. The bean jello was an interesting textural vehicle for the spicy sauce. My dining buddies polished it off with delight and surprise. The Spicy Beef Tendon was also delish, although the texture was more to my liking than to my friends. Gelatinous beef tendon sliced paper thin and seasoned with a pleasantly pungent dressing of chili oil. It has a fun, chewy, rubbery texture, but I'd understand if this isn't to everyone's textural preference. Next to come out was the House Combo Fried Rice, which had that yummy, slightly smoky, fried rice flavor only a super hot, commercial wok can achieve. Finally, we ended the meal with Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, which was also excellent. I don't know how it's made, but there were huge slices of tender beef brisket with possibly hand-pulled noodles floating in a hearty, gravy-like broth with a subtle vinegar kick to it.

Don't miss this tasty deal.\n\nPeter from Boston", "author": "Peter R."}

This place was worthy of the second review.  I came here to get a quick bite to eat.  I've heard that the chinese food in SF is usually sub-par because it caters to american tastes.  When I saw various versions of steamed intestine on the menu I knew this place wasn't trying to pretend to be something its not.  I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try the intestine but the fact that it was on the menu gave the place some authenticity points.  There were a good amount of vegetarian options, I had the braised tofu which was pretty great.  They also make a house hot sauce which was the right balance of tangy, spicy, sweet and sour.  Everyone in our group enjoyed the food.   The owner came by our table to check on how things were going, a really great guy, super friendly.  He said they just opened up a few months ago, that said there are plenty of solid reviews already.  I have found my go to chinese spot in SF.", "author": "Anish A."}

Read lots of reviews and walked by this place and decided to try it. It's right outside Chinatown. We tried crab rangoons, dumplings, chicken lettuce wraps, chow mien, and kung pao chicken. Ended up eating there 3 days in a row! We loved it. The chive and pork dumplings were awesome, yummy and fresh kung pao, great chicken lettuce wraps with peanuts and cilantro, and the spicy chicken was great with a pretty presentation of tons of hot chiles! Can't wait to go back to SF to eat here again. People were friendly and helpful, especially by our third night in a row.", "author": "Jeanna B."}

Their dishes are faithful to their origins but do not require re-engineering of American taste buds.  We ordered the garlic fish in chili oil, cumin lamb and chicken wings. The wine we had was full bodied and smooth and pared well with the food. Surprised to see a Chinese restaurant at this price range having a good selection of wine and beer.   The staff was very helpful and pleasant.  One of my favorite restaurants in the city.", "author": "Hong N."}

We just arrived from the East Coast and were very hungry for dinner.  We were greeted by a very friendly hostess and who we presume was the owner/manager.  We were told that in addition to the items on the menu, they could make anything we wanted.  The food was so delicious, and fresh tasting.  We ordered pretty standard fare, moo shu chicken, mixed vegetable fried rice and a sizzling salmon dish from the Specialties menu.  The food was absolutely delicious and we'd go back in heartbeat.

Both the spicy wontons and cold noodles tasted flat (wontons were too sweet and the noodles were heavy on the salt).  Both could've used more huajiao.

He called back to confirm items when he said he would; his customer service was awesome!  They delivered quickly to our staff meeting and all of my staff agreed that the food was great (my desk clerks want a menu for ordering at work!).  We had the Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Chow Mien, Orange Chicken, Sweet and Sour Pork and the Mixed Veggies were the absolute bomb!! The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star review was because I was told the order would be good enough for 9 people; it actually was only enough for 7 (2 didn't show to the meeting; if they had, we would've had even smaller amounts).  I definitely will order from them again!", "author": "Sheena C."}
