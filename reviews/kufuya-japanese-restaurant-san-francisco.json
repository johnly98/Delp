The interior is in need of some dusting and maybe some air fresheners but its cozy and the service was prompt. I can't comment on the shabu, which I look forward to trying. The sushi was fresh and tasty, definitely the best dish of my meal. The karaage chicken was good, as most fried things are, but definitely not prepared in the traditional way I'm used to. The batter was very thin, like tempura, rather than thick and flavorful. I ordered the tonkatsu don and the tonkatsu was a bit soggy and tough with over cooked egg. On the bright side, I did appreciate that our meal came with a side salad, miso, and hot green tea. \n\nOverall, mixed feelings about the non-shabu dishes I tried.

The soup came out a bit later than the rest of the items, but the wait wasn't too bad. \n\nWhat SURPRISED me the most was that once we finished our plate of meat, a server immediately came and switched out the empty plate with a new plate of meat!!! This didn't just happen once...they kept switching out our meat once our plate was empty! I didn't need to flag someone down, wait for them to take my order and then wait for the meat to come out. The SERVICE that we received was BEYOND AMAZING! (Please note that I came on a Friday night, and there were no empty seats, so they amazing service was not due to the lack of customers)\n\nWhen we asked for the check, they told us that tax and tip was already included!

When you walk in, it's very plain, simple, but modern. \n\nSeated quickly but no greeting, no smile, there's confusion between the two types of menus. One is an \u00e0 la carte menu for the sushi, another is for the hot pot (which is AYCE) -- looking through reviews, no one mentioned it, so I figured this was AYCE.\n\nAnyways, it was fine - we ordered sushi and sashimi. Honestly, quite fresh the sashimi, not the best I've ever had but not bad either. The sushi was rolled well and had a nice combo of rice and ingredients - enough to be memorable. But it wasn't good enough to justify the price tag on the food - which is one of the reasons for my 3 star rating.\n\nSecond reason why is because I called in advance and they had told me that it was AYCE.

Service.\n\nI was introduced to this place last weekend because my friend apparently loves hot pot. This is nothing new since my best friend also loves hot pot and I've probably been to every hot pot restaurant in South Bay. That being said, when we were on our way to Kufuya, I thought it would be like every other hot pot meal. I was wrong.\n\nHonestly, the best way to eat shabu is to eat AYCE shabu. With a price tag of $25 (before tax/tip), it's honestly hard to beat. The downside is that you're limited to a few options (Beef, lamb, veges, clear noodles, and udon) but honestly all I need is one solid cut of meat and I'm golden. Spoiler, the beef was great quality! It also helps that their sauces are super good, it's still DIY here but they pretty much bring everything to your table in separate dishes so you can adjust it however you want.\n\nNow let's talk about the service. At first I thought all the workers were super nice to us because my friend goes there often but then I could tell that they were just genuinely nice people based on how they treated the other guests - verdict, they treated everyone like family! That's what I'd call a homey restaurant ;D To call out a specific event, a small family came to the restaurant and had a tiny baby with them. It's a little hard to explain, but have you ever met a person that was extremely good with kids? Ya, that person was going out of their way to make sure that your baby was having a good time at this noisy restaurant. Please take my money.\n\n*NOTE: They have their own little parking lot in the back, I believe there are spots for 7 cars and if your car gets blocked in, you can just tell one of the people at the restaurant and they'll make an announcement for you.", "author": "Wiseley F."}

The shabu shabu is delicious, the service is wonderful, and I always end up coming here for AYCE more times than I'd like to admit.\n\nFor shabu, the broth is subtle yet flavorful, it doesn't feel overly salty or masked with spices to cheaply \"season\" the meat and veggies. The quality of the meat is also excellent, it always comes out looking and tasting fresh, something most places sadly have a hard time achieving. \n\nAs many have mentioned, refills come FAST. Unlike other AYCE places where you feel like people are moving at a snails pace and wonder \"Are they doing this to be cheap save money?\", at Kufuya they make you feel welcome like they want you to eat and enjoy.\n\nThe one thing you absolutely have to come here for is their dipping sauce, it works with everything. From the meat, to the veggies, tofu, and noodles, this sauce delivers the perfect bite each time. Make sure to mix in the extras they give you before the meal starts!\n\nAside from the great food, Julie and Eric always make us feel so welcome!

I absolutely love everything about this place.\n\nWell, I've specifically only come here for the AYCE (all you can eat). There's a choice between beef or lamb, and I just prefer beef because of how quickly it cooks. When it comes to AYCE, it's $25/person. For the price you're paying, it's worth it if you come ready with a strategy. You gotta be ready to scarf down all that food. \n\nThe beef itself is thinly sliced, which is great because then you definitely know it'll cook instantly. There's a pot of soup that you have three options for. I always go for the spicy miso. If you can't really tolerate spicy, it's recommended that you opt for one of the other two options. In my opinion, though, it's not spicy.\n\nThe pot of soup has a side bowl filled with spinach, tofu, mushrooms, udon noodles, noodles, and lettuce. Throw it all in and let it simmer! Super good. \n\nTHE SAUCE IT COMES WITH IS WHERE IT'S AT. I don't know exactly what it consists of, but that's what really sold me about this place. There's also four tiny dishes of add-one for the sauce (green onions, garlic, chili peppers, daikon radish). I only use garlic to give the sauce that extra BAM! Apparently, if you want to use the chili peppers, feel it out. Don't add generous amounts of it right away because it's too spicy and you don't want to be miserable. \n\nThe service is exceptional. They treat you like you're family and they check up on you often. They'll refill the broth, constantly replace the plate of meat, the side bowl, and even your sauce! \n\nSo when it comes to paying the bill, they will automatically add in the tip if it's AYCE. I'm not upset at that because I feel like they work really hard and they deserve to be tipped well. I feel like for those that have an issue with tipping, don't eat out if you're not going to tip 15 or 18% for exceptional service, you know?", "author": "Rachel M."}

It was very nice they cleaned up after the kids mess. You know kids will be kids. Tips automatically added and small parking behind the building for kufuya customers. The only negatives is that I'm not a fan of their dipping sauce. Seems to be already combined both the sesame and ponzu together. I ask for just sesame so it won't be so tangy which they didn't have it. So I assumed pre combine sauce.   Lamb is not all that but the beef is good. Very thinly slice. Food I would rate 3 star but their service is fast and nice so extra for that-4star. Now would I come back? Yes but only if I'm in the area.

I found parking along the streets nearby the restaurant. I noticed they have a small parking lot where people would parking behind other people so often while you're dining there... You'll hear them call out license plate #s out so that the car owner will go out to move the car if it's blocking someone in.\n\nIt seems funny whenever they're yelling out the numbers. It's like playing lottery, but you don't get a prize. Lol.. also, it interrupts your dinner so it can be annoying. \n\nThey have a spicy or non spicy option. Unlike other shabu places that offer the split pot, this place does not have that. I could see why after they brought out the pot since it's like made out of a different material rather than the pots that most other places have. This is like some hardcore cauldron or something. lol Anywho.. service was fast & friendly. But it could be since one of my former coworkers goes there often so she's close with them. They bring out a plate of meat immediately once it's empty.  \n\nI didn't get to try the different sauces while I was there though. I see the staff would drink with each table which is cool. Makes it more cozy, I guess?\n\nI think I remembered it being about $35 per person for AYCE&D which seems right.\n\nI would say this place is 3.75 stars.

For the longest time I was obsessed with KBBQ until I was introduced to Kufuya's shabu and now I'm completely hooked!! Confession: I have eaten here almost 4 weekends straight on Saturday evenings. How embarrassing! So embarrassing that the staff here remembers me and my boyfriend. I guess it works out because they always give great service and are friendly and courteous. They are always smiling and are happy to see their repeat and regular customers. I like coming here on game days because they have multiple TV's where they show the games.\n\nFOOD: On to the food....\"straight fire\" as the cool kids say or it was \"hella lit\"! Stick to the AYCE shabu shabu with spicy miso broth (not spicy at all and you can ask them to spice it up). They also have tonkotsu broth and chicken broth. For meat, they have either a choice of beef, lamb or both. They have nicely marbled and thinly sliced meat. The mushrooms are deletable as well because they have spinach, lettuce, two types of mushrooms and glass and udon noodles. Better yet, wait until you taste the dipping sauce!! I like to add diced garlic, onion and spring onions to it. Its savory with a kick to it! I'm currently salivating as I type this out just thinking about the sauce.\n\nPRICE: $26.99/person for AYCE Shabu. The only CON is that they add gratuity automatically on your bill. Service is great so it ends up working out in the end.\n\nPARKING: there is a small parking area on the back of the building however if you are blocking another car, you might be asked to move in the middle of your meal which could be very inconvenient. \n\nTIPS: Avoid peak times 7-9pm. Call ahead to make a reservation.\n\nSee you all there on the weekends :) I'll for sure be there!", "author": "Sandra P."}

I filled the pot up with some vegetables in our tonkotsu based soup. As it started to boil we would only grab a piece or two of each meat so it wouldn't overcook. Just swish the meat in a few times and it'll be cooked. We were only given one sauce, so we weren't able to experiment with sauces sadly. I definitely enjoyed the rib eye steak, as for the lamb, I'm not a fan of lamb in general so I barely ate it. My boyfriend enjoyed the lamb more though! We ordered around 3 rounds until we were stuffed.\nMy boyfriend ordered the dragon roll I believe, and it was yummy!\n\nDuring our meal it got super packed since it was dinner time then.

You can order individual orders of the meats if you don't think you're up for AYCE, but AYCE is definitely a much better bargain. Individual meat plates range from $14-16 each depending on what you get. \n\nThey don't have much of a selection here in comparison to hot pot...you can only choose between beef or lamb or both. You're served a bowl of veggies which come with tofu, udon/vermicelli noodles, spinach, etc - your typical stuff. They give you sides of garlic, green onions, some sort of chili, and I'm not sure what that other thing was. They serve you unlimited hot tea, water, and rice. One thing they don't have here is ponzu sauce, but the peanut sauce made up for it w/ the yummy spicy miso broth. \n\nWe started off with a huge round plate of beef slices and a small plate of lamb. Finished that and were immediately served another round without being asked. They kept doing that for a while... but eventually asked if we wanted more. I'd say we had about 5 plates in total!\n\nWe didn't know there was a parking lot for the restaurant until we got there.. but you're probably better off parking on the street! \n\nOverall a good experience.

They also have a small parking lot where you can park. However, when the lot is full, finding parking in the area is a bit tricky.\n\nFor all you can eat, it's $25 per person. Very reasonably priced for good quality meat (ribeye steak and lamb). They offer two kinds of broth which is the spicy miso or tonkotsu. I've had both of the broths and you can't go wrong with either one. Along with the meat and broth, you get veggies and noodles on the side as well. If you want to do the all you can drink, it's an extra $10 per person which includes beer, cold sake, or hot sake. I really enjoy their sake, so I find the all you can drink to be very much worth it. You have a 90-minute window for the all you can eat and drink.\n\nKufuya's service is on point. When the servers see you running low or running out of anything, they'll come check on you and will even take the initiative and bring you what you need without you asking for it.

However, besides this minor setback to some... food wise, this place is pretty damn good!\n\nEvery time that I come here we always opt of the all you can eat shabu, so I can't judge their other dining options. As far as shabu goes, Kufuya has always been consistent and good. One of my main reasons for choosing Kufuya for shabu is due to their dipping sauce. It's basically a sauce base where you can customize with as much red peppers, garlic, daikon, and green onions as you like. Another great thing about Kufuya is their service which is usually pretty prompt.

Thus, it makes it hard to get refills and/or the check every time. It feels like I'm trying to hail a cab. On at least 2 occasions, I've had to just walk up to the counter to ask for the check. \n\n-They automatically deduct a 15% tip. This is usually the standard practice with large parties, but not for a party of 2. I always tip well, and find it hard to tip anything less than that even if service is poor. However, something about forcing it on a party of two while not consistently meeting all basic needs is off-putting.\n\nI've been here several times, but over the years, less and less. The service and accommodations seem drastically biased toward wanting to retain large and extra large parties as customers. Maybe it's more profitable that way, but I prefer a business that will value all customers the same.

I've driven by this place a lot whenever I go to Japantown and it just looks like a regular ol' sushi joint from the outside.

A good amount of tables and I saw a lot of people just get the AYCE shabu for $23. \n\nService is ridiculously fast! As soon as you finish a plate of something, the waiter is already there to switch the plates. Either their meat is gonna go bad in the next 20 seconds or they are just on top of it with that AYCE, hahaha. And the quality of the meat isn't really all that, but you do get what you pay for here. And after my friends ate 11 plates of meat, they definitely made it all worth the money. They're quick to refill water, too. Definitely a big plus in my book. \n\nFor the AYCE, you can choose between 3 different soup bases - spicy miso, chicken, and tonkotsu which is pork flavor. And with the AYCE, you get a big plate of beef, a small plate of lamb, a bowl of veggies that includes lettuce, mushrooms, clear noodles, udon... It's awesome. \n\nParking is a sort of a pain because they're located in a residential area in San Francisco where some spots aren't long enough for a car to fit, but you can definitely find parking if you try hard enough or just get lucky. They do have a small parking lot on the side, but it's one of those parking lots where you'll end up blocking a car and it can be a pain because they will call you to move your car if you end up blocking someone who needs to leave. \n\nOverall, would definitely definitely oh please let me come back here again!

We started with a mixed tempura appetizer which was just OK. 1 shrimp, 1 broccoli, 2 slices of sweet potato, and 1 of potato. The waiter must have misunderstood us because instead of a seaweed salad, he brought a western style salad of lettuce and tomato, also just OK. We each had udon bowls, mine was mixed seafood and my friend's was eel. With both the broth was tasteless and only slightly improved with soy sauce and nanami togarashi. Bowls were medium sized and inexpensive - $12 and $15. Mine had a lot of seafood, but not much flavor. The grilled eel was nice. Things were delivered from the kitchen as they were ready, which was OK for us. The people working there were nice, but not particularly efficient. I let them know we needed to leave at a certain time. When we couldn't waive them down for our bill, I went up to the counter to pay it.", "author": "Donald O."}

They offer three different broths- chicken, spicy miso, and pork. I always go for the spicy miso since I like a little spice in my life hehe. The deal also comes with a bowl of veggies that includes cabbage, spinach, two different types of mushrooms, udon noodles, and glass noodles. Yum. \n\nWhat I must highlight is the amazingly attentive service here. I don't know why but whenever I come here, I feel like family. They refill your tea, delicious dipping sauce, and plates of meat without you ever having to ask them. It's truly wonderful.. If only it was like this at other restaurants. I will definitely continue coming back here. Keep it up, Kufuya!", "author": "Marny N."}

The food along with the sauce is delicious, but service also plays a huge role in the restaurant industry.\n\nCame here with party of 3 and they seat us right away. Throughout the WHOLE meal though not ONCE did they come to our table, we had to flag them down every single time.\n- No water refills after asking 4 times\n- Messed up our vegetables 2 times\n- Forgot our meat\n- Forgot our sauces\n\nBeing a server myself I'm typically extremely understanding... Especially if it's busy, BUT they were just drinking with friends/maybe customers when tables needed to be serviced... I even ask for everything at once so they don't have to constantly come back... When we recieved our bill one of the servers(tall man with glasses) was nice enough to apologize because it was busy, but we've been neglected for so long that at that point it didn't matter anymore. Needless to say, we did not tip the 15% that is already added to the bill. I don't usually have bad service here, this being the first time, but 1 time is all it takes.", "author": "Amy W."}

After ordering we noticed that everyone else was ordering the shabu and began to wonder if we made a mistake. Absolutely not.\n\nWe ordered the volcano, tiger, and red dragon roll along with maguro nagiri and an order of goyza. All of which was fantastic. The fish was very fresh and the rolls were expertly prepared.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and the service very good and the staff fantastic and attentive. Keep in mind that this is more of a family restaurant, so it would not be considered quiet or intimate. However, even on a busy Saturday night, the noise level was fine and much less than what you find at many trending hot spots.\n\nWe will definitely return although I will be hard pressed to chose between the AYCE and the other menu items.

I guess they're just that busy. \n\nI walked in there and there were no parties waiting  before me. The server looks right pass me and seats the two parties that walk in after me. When I attempt to tell her that I arrived first, she tells me that the other two parties have a reservation. But how would she know that if she hasn't even spoken to them? \n\nShe then hands me a menu and tells me I have to wait, doesn't say how long though. When another table finally opens up, the same server was hesitant to seat my party. She just waves us off to the table and comes back 10 minutes later to give us the rest of the menus. When we tell her immediately that we're ready to order she disappears for another 10 minutes before coming back to take our order. \n\nWe all wanted to do the ayce shabu and she took about another 10-15 minutes to bring out the meat and veggies. And another 10 minutes after that for the soup pot. Service was extremely slow. I understand they only have 2-3 servers working but I've been here a few times before and had better service. The servers are also very forgetful. I had to ask several times for the same item multiple times. \n1/5 stars for service. \n\nMoving on to the food, we got the spicy miso broth. It wasn't too spicy, some of us who didn't like spicy really enjoyed it. They also give you dipping sauces with plenty of garlic, green onions,  red peppers, and daikon for you to add together to suit your liking. They don't have much variety for ayce but the quality of the meats are pretty good. They give you about 2-3 plates of meat at a time and a bowl of veggies with udon and glass noodles. They refill your new plates of meat on request, which took a while for us. \n4/5 stars for food. \n\nAyce shabu is $25 per person which is pretty decent for shabu. They also have a 18% service charge added onto the bill which I really wouldn't mind if they actually had good service. Probably wouldn't be back.

Although I don't to AYCE shabu a lot (so expensive, and I only really need one plate to get full), if I were to ever do it again, I would do it here!!! The price is niceeeee ($22), the service is awesome, and the food is delicious!!\n\nI came in with 4 of my girl friends hoping that they would let 3 of us do ayce shabu while 2 of them would order off their normal menu even though we were sitting at the same table. Our waiter Simon let us know that it would be fine, so we were happy about that because we know at a lot of shabu places, the whole table has to get ayce. \n\nOur dipping sauces and its toppings came out first. Right off the bat, you'll notice that it's not the typical goma and ponzu sauce, but it's some miso based dipping sauce that is DELICIOUSSS (I even had to ask for a second bowl after I finished the first). We were wondering if they had ponzu and the waiter overheard us, and he even asked us if we wanted some (good customer service!!!!). He brought us three bowls but we still decided we liked their housemade dipping sauce better. The toppings they give you for the sauce are garlic, daikon, peppers, and green onion!  After a little bit, our veggies came out. The veggie bowl comes with udon and glass noodles, napa cabbage, spinach, tofu, button mushrooms, and shitake mushrooms. My friends and I were wondering why they didn't bring out the pot and soup first to let it boil, but I think they heat it up back in the kitchen first so it's hot and boiling already when you get your meats (pretty convenient for people who don't like to wait... kind of). We ordered spicy miso and it wasn't that spicy, but honestly I wasn't really focusing on the broth because that dipping sauce was just... amazing. Our meat finally came out and us three started to dig in!! We only got the beef (we don't really like lamb haha) and it was so tender!! The meat quality here is really good, and the servers are super quick when refilling them. Most times, we didn't even have to ask and a server took the empty meat plate and brought out a full one. Also when you refill on veggies, you can let them know which veggies/noodles to leave out and which to bring so you don't waste any! They're super accommodating. At the end of the meal, we were all super stuffed (pretty sure us 3 had 5 plates of meat I think??? Impressive.... I know hahahaha).\n\nOH and just an fyi, try to park in the front spots of the parking lot, so you don't have to move your car during your meal!! My friend warned me because if you park in a back space and you're blocking off someone's car that's trying to leave, you're going to have to get up (no matter what stage of the meal you're in), and move your car so they can get out. Just a tip! :)\n\nOH OH and another thing. They automatically add a shabu tip of 15%..... Have no clue why.. Kind of weird lol", "author": "Tara A."}

When looking at my old reviews I noticed to my horror that I never gave a review for Kufuya.  Lisa and Julie will be so mad at me for that one.  But much like another reviewer whose review I read earlier, what makes a great restaurant? it starts with the people working there.  Julie, Lisa, Eddie and the rest of the crew are the reason why I keep going back. always smiling,energetic listening to my witty comments and then dishing it rite back at me.  And they seriously get the whole restaurant involved. complete strangers at the other end of the restaurant will be joining in on all the fun throughout the meal.\n\nThe food is always amazing.  The broth for the shabu is amazing.  Endless trays of meat and veggies.  And if you are craving sushi instead they got you covered there as well.  Bottom line is shabu places in SF on Geary street are not hard to find anymore.  But try one of those places and then come eat at Kufuya and tell me which experience is better.

All you can eat shabu is the only way to go if you come here for that.  It's $23 and includes all of the usual fixin's: glass noodles, napa cabbage, udon, mushrooms, tofu, and of course your choice of meat.  The non AYCE option is more expensive so don't do that: $13/plate meat + $11 plate of veggies.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because they only have 1 dipping sauce that tastes a little like a mix between the ponzu and goma.\n\nIf everyone at your table is doing shabu, everyone has to get AYCE.  Otherwise, some people can order regular Japanese food from the menu and others can do shabu.\n\nThey have a small parking lot behind the restaurant around the corner but I generally don't like to park there.  You have to park tandem style where you're either blocking someone in or you're getting blocked in.  So you'll have to be prepared to interrupt your meal to move your car.

We had the beef, so can't comment on the pork. The beef was pretty good quality, a good balance of meat and marbling. The servings per plate were pretty generous, but you'll get more slices each time around at other restaurants. Getting more was easy and quick, requiring only that we put our empty plate in the edge of our table, with waitstaff replacing it within a minute or two. There were some nice veggie accompaniments, too - tofu, mushrooms (both shiitake and button), spinach, Chinese cabbage, udon and glass noodles. All were pretty good, standard for shabu shabu.\n\nNow the kicker for us - this didn't really seem to be Japanese shabu shabu. This was more a Chinese style hot pot. First off there's no choice of a regular dashi stock, only chicken stock, spicy miso broth or tonkotsu broth. To me, that's super weird. Secondly, the sauces. There was no ponzu sauce, only a salad dressing-like sesame sauce that seemed way heavier than you would usually want/find at other restaurants. The sauce accompaniments were good - sliced chilis, green onions, minced garlic.

It was actually normal inside with alot of couples! \n\nWhat I liked about Kufuya was their menu. Besides having Shabu, they had a full Japanese spread - sashimi and sushi (didn't try), teriyaki plates (for the folks visiting from Wisconsin), and even ramen (only served during week day lunch). I did try some chicken karaage which was doable and their grilled squid which was tender and tasty. \n\n* After reading a couple other reviews below, I must say yes -\n- Service can be up and down, but the place was busy and the waitress/hostess/water refiller/busboy acknowledged they were busy and and apologized. Cut slack! \n- Yes, it is kinda chilly inside.

The reservation was for a group of 15...but more people actually showed up. Whoops. The waitresses were friendly about adding more people! They added more chairs and another table for us. \n\nEveryone got AYCE! Unfortunately they don't have the \"half\" pots so you can't get two types of broth at once. This was kind of a problem for those who did not want the spicy broth. The waitress (I think she's the owner) will take shots with you haha. Definitely a fun environment for birthdays! \n\nTHE DIPPING SAUCE. OOOooOo this was so good! It was probably the highlight of my night :). I threw in tons of onions, green onions, and red peppers! (try not to choke on a pepper like me LOL, my throat was on fiyaaaa)\n\nI like how the meat just keeps coming! You don't really have to order until it gets busy, then you just have to ask for it. You have the option of beef, lamb and pork! The portions for the beef are big but kinda small for the lamb. \n\n\nP.S You may want to do street parking if you don't want your meal to be interrupted!

I've lived two blocks away from kufuya for the last 15 years and only discovered it this year.  My boyfriend is going through a hot pot phase so We always try new shabu places that just end up being over priced and mediocre. We've been to kufuya probably over 10 times in the past couple of months and they never dissapoint. \n\nThere's always a table available for us and the service is great. Once we get our pot boiling the meat just keeps on coming! You don't even have to ask they'll bring a brand new place once they see you take the last slice. Their meat is so thin it just melts in your mouth! And it doesn't come frozen solid like at other shabu places.  What I love most about kufuya is their sauce! It's like the perfect mixture of ponzu and sesame. Their shiitake mushrooms are really good too, I use to ask for more all the time and now they just give me a bowl or plate full of it.", "author": "Linz C."}

The first time we came we did AYCE shabu for a really good price $25.99 which is cheaper than most places in Sacramento. We had a party of five so we got to choose two soups since we had two pots. We chose the tonkotsu and spicy miso but both were a bit on the bland side but I guess their dipping sauce made up for it since that was one of the best dipping sauce i ever had at a shabu place. We chose beef and lamb as our meat choices and the beef was pretty good, thinly sliced and was of an okay quality and I didn't try the lamb because i hate the gaminess of lamb but the rest of my party said it wasn't all that, so we just stuck with the beef for all our other rounds. I semi like the fact that they keep refilling your meat without asking and they were pretty attentive with refilling the items. They also gave us a bowl of mix vegetables that had really good clear kind of noodles. The second we came we just did a Shabu by the course and some sushi and appetizers. The rolls were pretty good.

My personal favorite is the spicy miso broth. The broth lends a light, clean flavor while the sauce they provide adds a tangy kick. I LOOOOVE the sauce and always load it up with garlic and daikon! The chili peppers are hot as balls though so proceed with caution. The meat can vary between very lean and slightly fatty but I love it all regardless!  I think that if you are someone who is very particular about the fat content of your meat, maybe you should go to the store and buy your own meat... stay your ass at home where you can pick and choose whatever you please instead of going out and complaining about how you once went to a shabu place that served you fatty meat. \n\nI love everyone who works here, from the servers who see me almost every month to the servers who have only seen me once or twice. They're always kind and smiling and never, ever lag on bringing a fresh plate of meat to our table. That being said, beware of the time limit! They handle a high volume of customers so they will enforce their time limit when they have to. During this time they do their best to rotate in as much food as possible to your table so coordinate wisely, my friends. \n\nI always leave happy. I don't mind the 18% gratuity; after being a server in the city for several years I understand the struggle! So maybe if you do not believe in tipping your servers, go elsewhere. They are amazingly patient and hardworking here even with the hordes of drunk assholes and impatient snobs. Kufuya consistently provides great service and good eats at an affordable price. Call ahead to arrange for seating, especially if you have a larger party. Also make some time to find parking! \n\nWhy I prefer Kufuya over other shabu restaurants? \n- Servers are friendly and quick and do not avoid making eye contact (I HATE servers who do this, and for some reason so many shabu places are staffed with people who walk around staring at the ceiling or walk right past you when you're trying to get their attention).\n- Broth is flavorful but still light, not overly spiced (some places go crazy with the herbs and I find that it makes their broth taste almost medicinal)\n- Their sauce makes my tastebuds tingle with happiness and I can put as much garlic in there without being judged hehe", "author": "Patricia P."}

I always add radish, green onions, garlic, and extra extra chillies into my sauce. \n\nPretty fast customer service. As soon as they see your plate of beef or bowl of veggies and noodles empty, they will refill it. Not so fast refilling the lamb though.", "author": "B. R."}

I drive all the way from Daly City to eat thier ayce shabu and it never disappoints. Veggies and meats always fresh and service is awsome. They only have beef and lamb but its aight cuz I like it simple anyways. Veggies are mushrooms,  spinach, napa cabbage,  udon and clear noodles. At $23pp every day, its the cheapest in the city! Attn!! The tip is already calculated with your bill!! Its all good for me cuz when I came yesterday with my 2.5yo, they didn't charge him a thing. I ordered a bowl of rice for him and he eat some of our shabu stuff too!!! Gave him ice cream for dessert!!! It was an Awsome meal and experience.\n\nThe only reason its not 5stars is the parking. Parking can be pretty crazy and if you park in the lot, its tandem parking so you might have to ask people to move their car to leave. Other than that!! Thumbs up bro!!", "author": "RICKY C."}

I've been hearing good things about this place so I was willing to try it out. \n\nMy friends and I made reservations for 15 and had no troubles. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. \n\nNot the best quality meat, but cmon $23 for AYCE that's not bad at all. Whenever there's an empty plate on the table, the server replaces it right away without having to raise a hand. Their service is really fast, but maybe it's because we came on a Thursday night and it wasn't busy..? \n\nI would definitely go back, but im sorry it's still not as good as Shabu House.", "author": "Krystelle D."}

People keep saying their sauce is good , but I don't find it special and I think other shabu places have better and more sauce options. Meat is ok, and I like the veggie bowl the most because it is fresh. We ordered pork and spicy miso broth ,both has no flavor. \n\nWhy I only rate then 2 stars ,I have to say the customer service is really no good , or I will say bad. Not friendly at all, my friends came before me said both waitress and the waiter were being rude to her. We are party of 5, and need to flag them for water few times. We asked for more sauce two times and they forgot about it. When the bill came ,15% tips is already added. We paid with 2 credits card and somehow the total charge was higher than the total. We just didn't get get it but we didn't bother to argue or question. Bottom line , we will never come back. There are so many shabu shabu out there.....

That plus I'm moving to the neighborhood- this created the perfect storm for me to try Kufuya...\n\nWell....lunch was totally A-OK- but nothing amazing.  I had a rather lackluster but adequate tonkatsu ramen- tasty enough broth, mixed with stringy ramen noodles, plenty (maybe too much tonkatsu) and various veggies.  Edible, and fundamentally sound, but not something I'm likely to order again.  If you are accustomed to eating ramen in Japan, you will be disappointed- but without that reference or expectation- its a satisfactory meal (and a large portion).  My lunch companion had the more impressive score- a massive combo platter of chicken teriyaki, gyoza, and tempura shrimp and veggies.  All that + rice, miso soup, and salad- this lunch special was almost a feast for two at a price of around $10.  The total damage was something like $25 combined, so we got decent enough food at a value which can't be found on the other side of the city.  That said, I wouldn't drive across town for this, but I can see myself eating here sporadically when I move 8 blocks away.  It seems from many many yelp reviews that the shabu shabu is surely the way to go here, and I am definitely going to try that down the road at some point.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SPICY MISO BROTH. They bring you a hot pot of soup quickly and everything else equally fast, getting you started as soon as you sit down. In addition, you are served their delicious goma sauce (I think that that's what it's called) and I also recommend dumping in some of the daikon, green onion, garlic, and of course some chili. When you get the broth don't forget to put garlic and stuff in it to make it extra yummy.\n\nKufuya offers excellent service, even at their busiest. They will constantly refill you on meat, and you can most definitely ask for anything else you want more of (noodles, veggies, broth, tea, etc). \n\nGreat place to fill your tummy with the most delicious food to warm your soul.

There are many Chinese-owned restaurants in the City and I can taste it when it is not real Japanese.  Other than that, the portion is generous.

I didn't have an issue with parking (came on a Sunday night @ 7:30 pm). My boyfriend made a reservation just in case it was packed but there were a couple empty tables when we came in. BF and I both got the AYCE shabu shabu for $22 each (they include the tip when you get the AYCE so the grand total was around $27 each). \n\nThis place is NOT Japanese owned (I understand Chinese and the owners/waitresses were speaking Chinese to each other) so the flavor was a little off... The spicy miso broth was really bland so we asked our waitress to add some pork broth to our pot. Unfortunately this didn't solve the bland flavor issue so we just added some soy sauce into our pot and reduced the sh*t out of the soup. The shabu only came with a sesame dipping sauce (also bland in my opinion) and some chopped green onion, garlic, grated daikon, and chile. The quality of the beef is pretty good, although it was shaved a bit too thin in my opinion. We had an abundance of fresh napa cabbage, spinach, tofu, Korean glass noodles, udon, white button mushroom, and shittake mushroom to accompany our beef. Neither of us liked lamb so we skipped it all together. \n\nService was really good! Our meat plate was never empty and we ended up with a lot of extra veggies.

(who doesn't choose AYCE kbbq & hot pot?!). Anyways, after she told him her choices, he was disappointed and told her he wanted AYCE. Since our group of friends normally eat at Shabu Club, she decided to try something new for all of us! To end this little short story, we had an awesome AYCE experience with our group of 6 :) \n\nHaving AYCE hot pot, I was surprised at how great their service was. As said before, Shabu Club has always been our place to go for hot pot (if not, it'd be Shabu House). The thing with Shabu Club is that their ponzu sauce was superb and their meats were marbled most of the time, but their service was meh... Sometimes we'd sit around for 10-15 minutes with no meat at the table. We would have to order a plate in advance when we're about halfway through with the current plate and still have to wait an extra 10-15 minutes, sometimes 20! For Shabu House, it was the same thing, except their food quality wasn't as good as Shabu Club. I found the service here at Kufuya impeccable. They are always on the floor and carrying meat, ready to fill an empty plate or table. Though their meat isn't as great as Shabu Club, it is still pretty good, as well as their sauce. It is important to us that we are never left hungry, and I felt as though they are going above and beyond that. \n\nAnother awesome thing was the cake surprise! Of course the girlfriend had to order a cake in advance, but we were having trouble deciding whether or not to eat the cake there or back at home since most of the guys didn't have room for cake quite yet. While we were close to ending the decision of having cake there (after sitting for several minutes), they closed the lights and we all sang happy birthday to our dear friend, Mark! His girlfriend wasn't even expecting it just yet either because she hadn't given them the candle, but it all turned out great, because they surprised us with a sparkler candle too!! :) Thanks for everything and making our friends birthday awesome, Kufuya!! I am definitely coming back here with the impeccable service and delicious food!! I will never go hungry :) \n\nSo aside from the awesome service & birthday celebration, I'd like to tell you about other stuff!! I guess you can make your own stuff because the table will have little bowls of dishes that has garlic, tunip (??), green onions, and red peppers for you to mix into your sauce to your liking. AYCE hot pot is $23 and includes rib-eye steak, lamb, and pork. The meats come out on large plates, but if you order lamb, it tends to come out in a smaller plate. Also, their veggie bowl has cabbage, spinach, udon, glass noodles, mushroom, and tofu. I wish they had enoki mushrooms! For parking, they have a small private lot, and you can park behind another car, but you must move it when the person leaves (which they will announce to the restaurant what type of car is blocking the person). If there is no more space, you have to find street parking, so good luck!! \n\nOverall, I had a wonderful experience here and would definitely come back again with friends. Thanks for making our friends birthday special!! :)", "author": "Mandy G."}

But I'd rather travel some distance to come to kufuya! Here is why!\n\nShabu shabu - this might be the only spot in SF that doesn't give you ponzu sauce or sesame sauce. Let me tell ya, the sauce here is amaze-balls! It's their secret ingredient - I cant tell all the ingredients but it is so good! I literally drink my sauce every time I come here. I ask for refills 5, 6 times every meal. I love it. They also give you the thai chili pepper, it is so spicy but its so good! The beef and lamb are so tender and neatly placed on the plate. The waitresses here are so quick with bringing out more plates of meat before you are done. They keep it coming! And this might be the cheapest all-you-can-eat place, I believe it's 22 dollars, definitely under 30 which is the usual price for all-you-can-eat shabu shabu. \n\nSushi - I don't only eat shabu here, I order sushi and other dishes as well! So I can really tell you more about this restaurant. I'm not a big fan of california roll but I tried it here once and I have to get it every time before my shabu! They use real crab meat, none of that fake stuff! It is absolutely delicious! The sushi here are so fresh. Spicy tuna is great too! If a place like this can make the two basic so delicious, then it is legit! I also tried monk fish liver - it's so delicate and so great!\n\nMy friends and I also order takeout from here also. I usually get a 6 piece sushi and Oyako Donburi (the chicken and egg rice dish). My friend also likes to order a dish that's beef pieces with mushroom stir fry. Their dinner bento box are great with simple salmon filet, tonkatsu and teriyaki chicken. Reasonable price for everything! It's affordable with amazing food. \n\nJulie and Lisa are so great! They don't just serve you. They actually make friends every time people go there! Everyone that goes there knows their name and had some kind of conversation with them! It's a family own business so they really take good care of you! Like I mentioned earlier, you never have to ask for beef, they always walk around and check if you need refill on sauce, meat, etc. I first yelped the place and the only thing I got out of all the reviews was the friendly customer service. It truly is great. \n\nThanks Julie! I will see you soon!\nxoxo", "author": "Mindy C."}

We came here on a Tuesday evening so it was pretty slow so the service we got was great and fast. \n\nCame here last week with a friend and was amazed by the low cost, high quality food. At $22 a person you can eat all the beef, lamb, and veggi you want! The quality of meat is good and fresh. Although like all other all-you-can eat places, the more you order the thinner the slices get. I highly recommend the spicy miso broth, it's not super spicy (can hardly taste it actually) so for those of you who can't handle spices this isn't horrible. \n\nI actually like this place better than Shabu House on Geary.. so that being said, i will be back here for some more shabu!", "author": "Jenny G."}

I've been here a few times already and everytime its been an amazing experience. \n\nThe first couple times, I ordered the AYCE Shabu. Its $25 per person, not a bad price for me. They only offer beef and lamb, but the quality is pretty good, as well as veggie bowls. The service is fast; they always give me new meat and more veggies right away. And the sauce is UNCOMPARABLE! Its so good and they give chili peppers, garlic and daikon to add to your liking.\n\nThe next times after that, I decided to try out their sushi hoping that it will be as good as my past experiences, and I was not disappointed. Their sushi rolls are one of the best I've had ever; I asked them if they could make some recommended and house specials to try and they were UNBELIEVABLE! The sushi chef makes some of his own inventions which were really good as well. \n\nThe best thing that I liked about this resraurant was the service. They were fast and friendly; it created a very comfortable and \"homey\" environment. I've been here a few times and the servers would always joke around which I find makes me feel welcomed every time I come back. There is a 18% tip added to your bill, which I find to be acceptable because they deserve it (I do sometimes put more). \n\nOverall, my experiences have always been good memories made and I will always come back.

It's nice that Shabu House uses kobe beef and has a nicer environment, but you can't beat the Kufuya's deal.\n\nWe all decided on the spicy miso broth and decided to forgo the lamb.

Spicy miso is also good too but I only tried it since I can't handle spice very well. The staff constantly check on your plates of meat and replace them right away when they're empty. Good group experience except for the fact that when you run out of lamb, they don't replace it automatically. You have to ask for it everytime. They will also replace your veggie bowl constantly. They can replace the veggie bowl with anything you specify (i.e. just udon) as you get closer to the end of your meal when you don't want to eat everything given. Also they have a parking lot behind the restaurant where cars can park back to back so you'll hear them yell out car models during dinner for people to move their car so someone else can get out. It's not that bothersome when you think of how much more convenient it is to park there than to park blocks away. But I recommend parking a block away on Clement along Lincoln Park. There's plenty of parking.\n\nIf I was in the Richmond district, this would def be my choice for Shabu.

We weren't too hungry and didn't really want to pay $22 a person either so we decided to get individual plates of partially oxidized meat for $13 a person.\n\nFirst impressions tell all. Right when I sat down, I looked up and was pleasantly greeted with the sign every restaurant patron wants to see: \"We reserve the right to refuse service to any customer\". Whenever I see this sign, I always feel like it's an excuse for poor service, and boy was I right. Right when we sat down, we were greeted by an unfriendly, snappy, but still smiling waitress. She was completely confused that we were going to order small plates and not the AYCE. When I asked to order a small plate, she said that I couldn't order single plates since I might be eating my friend's food who she assumed to be ordering AYCE. So, right off the bat, she thought that I was going to steal food by nickel and diming them. I should have walked out then. The rest of my party all ordered small plates that took me multiple attempts to explain to her, and my girlfriend got their \"udon\" noodles. That was the last time she ever spoke to us. Note to self: next time wear \"I reserve the option to pay tip\" t-shirt. \n\nSomeone new brought out our food and the rest of everything that we needed. He didn't speak much, but he had a friendly composure. We ordered the tonkotsu broth with lamb, beef, and vegetables. Right when the meat came out I knew something was wrong. They had the misfortune, or lack of vision, to use plates that were dotted with red marks, so it made it look as though the meat was still dripping blood. Also the meat had tinges of dark grey, so you know they aren't fresh at all as they have been oxidizing for some time now. The broth tasted lifeless. And when we were running low on broth the same silent but still dependable man came by with a plastic jug of hot water to top us off. Eventually hot water and broth became synonymous. Overall the food was quite mediocre.\n\nNow I understand that we weren't the regular customers that seemed to be the only ones eating at the place, but could they try to at least be somewhat friendly to us? You know to hopefully get a repeat customer? I guess not.\n\nNext time, if I hear the waitresses speak Catonese to each other in a \"Japanese\" restaurant, I am walking straight out of there.", "author": "Alan H."}

Once you leave you can just tell the waitress to call out the car that blocked you in and the person will move their car.", "author": "Karen H."}

Now I probably come here at least once a month. \n\nAll you can EAT for $22. Do I need to say it again? ALL YOU CAN EAT SHABU for $22! This is cheaper than any place in the city for quality meat and their sauce, which is like crack out of a bottle. So delicious!!! Their broth (I always get spicy miso) is not too spicy, but still good. They give you a pretty good selection of vegetables that consists of Spinach, Napa cabbage, Shitake mushroom, and regular mushroom to put in the broth. They also give you udon noodles and clear vermicelli type noodles as well as rice if you ask for it. \n\nThe service here is excellent. Everyone who works here is very friendly and looks happy when they are working. They are pretty quick with replacing empty meat plates and getting more veggies and noodles when you run out. \n\nThis place has a little parking lot in the back around the corner, but it gets filled pretty quickly. If there is no parking in the lot there is usually plenty of street parking. \n\nI've never had a problem with not getting a table no matter how busy they were. No waiting like 2+ hours like other Shabu places. If you have a party of 6+ I recommend calling in for a reservation.", "author": "M S."}

I normally go to San Mateo with my boyfriend because it's cheaper and the wait isn't as bad. When my boyfriend and I came across this place we always left happy and super full! However, the other day I went with my best friend here and turns out their parking lot was full! (their parking lot is small, but free and convenient) We got worried so while looking for parking I called to check in to see if they can hold a table for two. They said sure just come soon! We came in to find one tiny table close to the bathroom that is meant for those who only want sushi and another table of 8 that was for shabu and easily could have split. Though it was reserved they made it unavailable for anyone an hour before the ones who made reservations had arrived and we were stuck eating by the bathroom. Ew? One star down for that. Next, they ask us what soup base and we wanted split pot( I always do this when I come here) and they say we can't because our table is too small...um, we're paying $25 per person and you're telling us that we're stuck with one soup base ( my best friend couldn't eat spicy and I wasn't a fan of their non spicy bases). So basically we spent $60 here and they charged us tips that seemed more than they deserved. They were very attentive and came out with our meat fast but I wish they planned accordingly because no one wants to eat by the bathroom and have to pay $25 and not be able to have the same services that other tables have. Keep in mind this was game day for the Warriors so I'm pretty sure everyone but us was there for more than the time limit. My seating was also not the best when I had someone who kept shouting in my ear everytime Curry made a shot.", "author": "Emily S."}

The first few plates i could tell had at least 10 pieces of defrosted meat, then the amount got smaller and smaller.

We had the miso soup; there were about three (chicken and pork?) choices of soup.  I enjoyed the miso soup, not too salted. If your partner want their own soup, this is not the place.  Must come to an agreement. You finish your bowl of fresh veggies, you can tell them want you want and they will refill.  The service was great!  They really hustle.  I love the mushroom and they have two kinds (American and Shiitaki).  Had an extra serving of udons and glass noodles.  The house sauce was okay, but I ended up dipping and probably drinking it all.  One disappointment:  No free ice cream at the end. That would have topped off our meal.  The burner was great because it was electric (less scary then fire); we got to control it (no gas cartridge).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-16", "description": "I have to admit, my first impression of Kufu-ya was not a good one. Back more than ten years ago, there was no \"shabu\" here, just your typical Japanese choices, I first came here for a simple lunch bento, with Winnie, for no other reason than a long time family friend of ours lived close by, and the teriyaki bento was $5. What followed was one of the most uncomfortable experiences we ever had in a restaurant. As we were seated, we immediately realized that we had just been thrust into the middle of a huge family fight. There were no other customers and the young couple that evidently owned it, were verbally tearing into each other, swearing and threatening each other with divorce and other things in mandarin, as the two young kids there were crying incessantly. Really uncomfortable. It was hard to order and eat in that kind of environment. The husband barked accusations at the wife from the sushi counter, as she called him names while she ran the food out and took orders. The situation calmed a bit when he stormed out and we later saw him smoking in their small back door parking lot, as we left. Anyway, we swore we would never go back, even though, over the years, we drove by there a hundred times. Also, it didn't look like they were doing too well, since it looked like they were seldom open. You can imagine our surprise when we heard  the \"buzz,\" that it had remade itself as a \"shabu shabu\" AYCE. And the reviews seemed good! Wow, now that peaked our curiosity, and of course, despite our first bad experience, after all these years, we had to go. And so we did, and you can imagine our surprise when upon entering, (I'M NOT 100% SURE,) it sure looked like the same \"husband\" standing behind the sushi counter, this time surrounded by the noise, clanging and clutter of a shabu shop, with a whole group of seemingly different staff. Except for the mismatched old style (gas canister) type of burners on the tables, (the same as you used at your grandmas house for hot pot, before you went to Ranch 99 and bought her a new electric one for Xmas that she never used,) the restaurant looked exactly the same as it did more than ten years ago, faded wood faux Japanese country style decor, old furniture, and a kind of (popular now) retro semi neglected look. What was different was the hustle and bustle of the staff running out big plates of thinly sliced rib eye, amid full tables of loud, semi drunk twenty somethings. One look at the menu told you why. In addition to the limited two meat choices, (rib eye, lamb,) with the $23 AYCE Shabu dinner, there is an All-You-Can-Drink option for $10 more, (Japanese and other beers, Sake etc) And drink as much as they wanted, was exactly what half the restaurant was doing. Mostly Asian 20 something office ladies, made up, decked out in \"clubbing type\" tube dresses, spiked heels, young couples, and college students, (with the occasional obligatory \"kweilo\" ) all getting plastered. The whole scene was pretty cool actually and we were happy to join in the fun. (We joined in with the neighboring table, and made some new friends, if the next day they remember who the hell this phone number on their screen belonged to. Haha.) But sadly that was the extent of the \"5 star experience\" for us. The food? Look, no need to lecture me about \"real Japanese shabu being only rib eye,\" I spent years in Japan, lived in a purely traditional Japanese neighborhood, and went days without ever seeing a \"foreigner.\" And I had Shabu hundreds of times over many years in many places, from \"grandmas house,\" to expensive \"name\" restaurants, and I can say that this rib eye is average at best. Also, since it's not chilled and then freshly sliced (as all good shabu is,) it had the annoying feature of being room temperature and sticking to the plate as you lift it, and ripping into shreds, Also, the veggie, tofu, + noodle  selection is kind of sub par. All this in comparison to other shabu and hot pot restaurants in our fair city and surroundings. And that's where this restaurant lacks, in comparison to other places. The safety risks associated with using gas canisters aside, this place at $23 ain't cheap. I mean for $25, you can go down the street to Hot Pot Island and have AYCE with infinite choices of meat, seafood, veggies, noodles etc.,four broths and more. In comparison, this broth was kind of bland. We and our new friends had to add soy sauce to it. Truthfully, with a minimum of effort and ingredients, we could easily and cheaply duplicate this complete dinner at home. Additionally, they have the questionable policy of an automatic 15% tip added. For what? Service was spotty. We had to \"flag down\" for everything. And often, overwhelmed, they forgot to bring it. Def not 15% worthy. But it won't matter. This place's appeal is in the \"nostalgia\" it offers to the 20 yr old age group, of a past \"innocent time\" of hot pot at home, before they had to pay rent and bills. Nostalgic hot pot plus alcohol, a sure fire winner!", "author": "George F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-25", "description": "5 FUCKEN STARS!!!  Here's why:\n\n1.  This is probably a top 5 restaurant in service.  I suggest many restaurants institute a program and have their employees shadow Kufu-ya's workers for a day to learn a thing or two.  Shabu House all you can eat will give you the first plate of really nicely cut meat however, the subsequent plates are like 8x11 sheets of meat.  There is no uniformity.  Either cut the meat nicely for every plate or give us 8x11 sheets every plate.  Kufu-ya's meat isn't artfully cut, but it isn't just slapped down on a plate.  However, each plate comes out looking like the previous.  Kudos.  The workers here are very friendly and are always smiling.  While they had smiles plastered on their faces, I counted at least 5 instances where they got wider: 1. when i asked for rice  2.  when kder asked for more vegetables and specified only udon, tofu 3.  when i asked for water  4.  when the waitress pinched a patron's arm and him curling up into a rolly-polly ball 5.  when the younglings were stomping about, playing hide n seek.  This place has such good service that it is basically a playground.  Kids were running around in circles, yelling and gurgling at the top of their lungs while the waitresses dodged them, carrying plates of meat with a fat grin on their faces.  A shabu house and a playground...I definitely approve.  There is something about seeing kids run around with reckless abandon, not worrying about their parent's nor workers scolding that gives you the willpower to chow down an extra plate of meat.  \n\n2.  The food was really good.  The meat isn't kobe beef like Shabu House, but honestly, can you even tell the difference.  I feel that all meat at Shabu house is pretty flavorless.  The broth gives it a little flavour, but its all in the ponzu sauce.  Their ponzu sauce is a little different.  Most houses have a peanut and separate ponzu sauce, however, they have one dipping sauce that seems like a hybrid of the two.  When I asked for more, they came out with a bottle of gatorade without the label to refill me with a mysterious twinkle in their eye.  Damn them shrouding their sauce in mystery.  They should have heightened the effect by storing their sauce in a challis and marked it with the words \"Fountain of Youth\".  You never have to ask for more meat, they automatically bring it.  They also give you a bunch of little condiments to flavour your broth: daikon, onion, peppers, garlic, etc.  The meat variety was lamb and beef, however, I am naturally not fond of lamb.  I stuck to the beef.  They have a different type of broth, the pork broth.  I usually get spicy miso, but this broth was very god too.\n\nWe also ordered a poki salad.  It was simple dish and was good in conjunction with our meal.  \n\n3.  I give this place the highest of 5 stars.  There are so many intangibles this place possesses that I will make this my regular place to take guests.  They never lag on the delivery of meat, always one step ahead of you.  I was about to open my mouth to ask for another one but before I could utter one word, a new plate was placed before me.  They let ou specify what vegetables you want.  I like this place because it is quaint yet serves as a hubbub of sorts.  It looks unassuming but chances are, you'll see your friends and enemies in here.  The wait staff has a uncanny super power of service.  They are friendly and seem to know everyone in here; it seems like a place of regulars.  They hug their customers and I hope to one day be firmly entrenched in their arms.  Oh yah...you have to peep their ice cubes.  They are no ordinary ice cubes.  They are most excellent little cones..so wadDUUUP!!!  Peep pics tho.  A fitting place for a fitting choice by Kder.  3 cheers: HIP HIP HORRAY!!!", "author": "Brian V."}

I made the call, and a sweet, enthusiastic young voice told me, \"Of course we have space for you!\" We jumped in the car and drove across the city, hopeful that we would be promptly fed.\n\nLet me tell you -- not only were we VERY promptly fed, but we ate like kings! The restaurant was quiet (only a few other parties, no annoyingly loud background noise), and the staff was SOOO attentive. But I'm getting ahead of myself. When we arrived, our table was ready, our server knew exactly who we were, and we were able to promptly order without even looking at the menu -- spicy miso broth, lamb and beef shabu for 4.

I ended up just using a spoonful of the miso broth with some garlic and soy sauce dumped in, and it was much better.\n\nI'm definitely down to come back here for AYCE shabu.  We didn't really look at the other items on the menu, but from what others say, the shabu is the best thing about this place.\n\nService was kind of slow/nonexistent, especially since for the first half of our meal, we were the only other party in the whole restaurant.  We were getting really annoyed because we were clearly wanting more food and water, and they weren't even around (our speculation: sake bombs in the kitchen).  Finally we had to wave and flag them down in order to get more water and plates of food.\n\nBesides the service, we had a great time here.  The food was fresh, the broth was good, and it was AYCE.

I was craving shabu so badly that I yelped a place that was open for lunch. I saw that Kufuya was open and decided to take my boyfriend to try it. I was sadly disappointed. \n\nYes, the deal is pretty awesome for all-you-can-eat, but as soon as you walk in, you hear Cantonese. Usually this is a red flag... Chinese people serving Japanese food? I don't know, my experiences have shown Chinese people are better of serving Chinese food and likewise for any ethnicity. However, I kept an open mind and decided to not let the lack-of-authenticity impart my judgment. \n\nI like the dipping sauce and the little additions (real garlic, green onions, peppers and minced daikon) you can put in it, especially the REAL chili peppers. We ordered the spicy miso broth and it was TERRIBLE. It was so watery with no hint of spiciness and not pleasant to sip on whatsoever. The vegetables that came with the udon were the usual: spinach, two different types of mushrooms & cabbage. The meat was sliced way too thinly that it would break before it was placed in the broth and this annoyed me to no end. \n\nThe service was good. They were very accommodating and constantly came back to check on us.\n\nAll in all, there was nothing special about this place that would make me come back. If you aren't too much on quality (and more on quantity) than the good price and good service should be more than an incentive for you to come try this place. \n\nGood future tip: Chinese people should just stick to Chinese food.", "author": "Jessica T."}

Julie and her staff gave us their undivided attention).  Soon after the rest of our group showed up, as did other customers (which made me feel better) and we were there for close to three hours enjoying the delicious shabu shabu.\n\nI would definitely go with the consensus and order the all you can eat with spicy miso broth. You get a large plate of thinly sliced meat, another plate full of spinach, mushrooms, tofu, glass and udon noodles, little side dishes of green onions, minced garlic and fiery red peppers that made grown men cry.  MMMMM MMMMMMMM.  For $22, how can you beat?    And for an extra  $10, you can drink all the beer and sake you want, too.  Sweet - next time.   \n\nI don't know what is in their sauce, but there has to be crack inside b/c it is sooooooooooooo freakin' good. (I must've said that at least five times last night.)  In fact, I want some right now.   Honestly, I've never been \"that\" impressed with shabu shabu, but Kufuya's sauce stands out amongst the rest.  \n\nWe never had to ask for more meat.  Every time our plates were empty, someone replenished them.  It was great.  All in all, I highly recommend this place for large and small groups.  You can tell that the people running this restaurant are good people that care about their customers and I really appreciate that.  \n\nWe found street parking b/c we had drinks at Tee Off before dinner, but as some of the other reviews have stated, there is a private lot on 34th Ave.  Another huge plus in the City.\n\nI was THRILLED that we found a place with such short notice.  Even better that it was highly recommended by one of my best friends (thx, C).  Good food, good price, great service - I will definitely be back!", "author": "Christie X."}

Service, 2. Their shabu sauce. Super friendly, always attentive, the staff were super friendly to our rowdy group of guests. The shabu sauce, although given with a limit of your choice amounts of green onion and raddish; is pretty mouth watering.\n\nTo gain the fifth and maybe fourth star for this all-you-can eat shabu shabu, they'll probably need to redecorate (out with the portable gas) and start serving more choices/condiments with their sauce.\n\nI would come back often.", "author": "Alfred Y."}

There were many moments during the meal that we had to wait to eat because we ran out of meat or veggies.  That doesn't work so good when I'm trying to get the bang for my buck on all you can eat shabu shabu :(  Too much lag time means too much time for my stomach to tell my brain that I'm full!\n\nI will admit there is the possibility that they were slow because we had a party of 24 people, and my friend --- the birthday boy that does everything at the last minute --- had made reservations late in the afternoon before our meal.\n\nI will say that the waitress was super nice, and stayed nice and funny even as we started to get progressivley more drunk and belligerent :)", "author": "Christina L."}

My friend was almost going to get some sushi and a bento box, but I sweet talked her out of it. She admit it was a good call after everything was said and done.\n\nThe order came with veggies (cabbage, spinach, tofu, mushrooms), noodles (udon and soba) and, of course, beef and lamb shabu, some green onion garnish and 'Crack' sauce. The beef was great. Just the right amount of fat to meat ratio. I did notice it was cut thinner than most places... if that can actually be measured. Melted like butter in my mouth. The lamb was good too, but we're not the biggest fan of lamb, so we only had one order. Was still good though. This was all in a spicy miso broth. I was very satisfied with my meal. The 'crack' sauce worked well with the meat.\n\nService was pretty good!! The meat kept coming out without us even asking. So cool. We had about four plates of beef, one plate of lamb and 1.5 servings of veggies. The servers were very nice, but it did slip a bit as our meal ended.

My friend brought me to Kufu-ya for the Japanese shabu-shabu dinner. We walked in on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was almost empty. That's usually not a good sign for any restaurants, but we were there for shabu-shabu and we went for it anyway.\n\nWe ordered the all-you-can-eat (not buffet) shabu-shabu for two and chose the spicy miso as our soup base. Our other choice was the chicken broth. The server took no time to get us setup with a table top portable stove and all the shabu-shabu utensils and condiments of miso based dipping sauces, minced garlic, scallions, finely grated daikon and slices of tiny Thai chili peppers. She then turned around and came back with two handful of platters filled with food. \n\nFor $22, we got (2 rounds of the below):\n- a huge pot of spicy miso soup that is rich, flavorful and hearty\n- a huge platter of thinly sliced beef (about 15 slices)\n- a plate of thinly sliced lamb (about 15 slices)\n- a large bowl of napa cabbage, spinach, tofu cubed, button and shiitake mushrooms, udon and vermicelli noodles. \n\nAll the ingredients were very fresh, the meats are bright red and the vegetables items were clean. They also give you their homemade dipping sauce which was really delicious. As soon as the soup started boiling, we dove right in and cooked away. We may be two skinny girls, but we ordered a second round of everything and ate it all. Did I mention $22 p/p is all-you-can-eat? \n\nA shabu-shabu dinner is nothing fancy, but it sure is a lot fun to be able to cook your own food table top and while you wait for your food to be cooked, you catch up with friends on the latest gossips. It is especially tasty on a cool SF night and you get a good dinner that warms you up and send you home full and happy.

I've never taken that many sakes before. I was buzzed, but not drunk. Good stuff though. We had a great time!\n\nWhy 3 stars? I asked myself, if I would come back here. Though the food was good, but lacked variety of what we can put into our Shabu Shabu, that covers under the buffet cost. I think I'd go to Hot Pot place (paying just a couple buck more) to get all you can eat seafood! Beside vegetables and noodles aren't expensive. The only expensive item was the thinly sliced rib eye.", "author": "MT D."}

So when my friend decided to have his b-day party here, I was a little apprehensive. \nGiven that the price of all you can eat shabu here is $22 (you can get all you can eat sushi on top of this for 6 more dollars) and that the price of shabu house all you can eat is $30, its definitely a good deal here. The shabu shabu was still very tasty. They only let you have beef and lamb however. I could kind of tell that the quality wasn't AS good as shabu house as far as the meat goes (pretty fatty!), but the spicy miso broth was still very good! Its kind of strange they don't serve you rice, but that just means more room for meat, right? Even though the sauce that they give you is pretty good, I'm used to getting the two different sauces. Overall, the shabu was very good and I would come again. I still think shabu house tastes better. \nThe service is very nice and they helped us store cake/cupcakes for the birthday surprise. Oh, and its less busy so that's also a plus. They have a parking lot right behind the restaurant as well which is very convenient.", "author": "Tim B."}

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm typically anti-buffet/allyoucaneat, but I definitely had an enjoyable time here. Heres a tip, have a few sake shots/beers before you start eating and all will be well. I think the food is typical for an all you can eat, a veggie plate that includes leafy greens, noodles/udon, mushroom, and tofu, and then you can have beef and lamb slices. Again let me reiterate the $10 all you can drink on top of the food. \n\nWhile the food was what I expected for this type of joint, the reason I really enjoyed this place was the service. Our waitress was so much fun, she kept bringing out food/drinks. Typically, for all you can eats, they are somewhat stingy, but not here. Great attitude, and even drank with us. The waitress (I think her name was julia) even spilled beer on me and while unpleasant, I was fine with it because she was so interactive with our group. They eventually kicked us out long after their official close, but were very accommodating in letting us stay past hours and bringing us food/drinks to the extent the kitchen could provide (they were closed by the time we were done and trying to close their register). \n\nThis was my first time here and while I didn't try anything outside their normal shabu, I would highly suggest getting the all you can eat shabu and definitely adding the all you can drink for an enjoyable time.

We even called several days in advance to make reservations to let them know such a big party would be coming in.  Food came out one at a time.  Several of my friends did not even get their meal until more than 1hr and a half later.  We had to constantly remind them of what we ordered, even though they wrote everything down.  We had to request for tea and chopsticks a couple of times before they returned with the items.  The waitress was rude and gave attitude when we tried to get her attention.  She asked us to speak louder if we wanted to be heard.  \n\nA lot of us ordered the dinner box special which comes with SOUP AND SALAD, but was not given to us until we asked about it AFTER we finished our dinner boxes.  The waitress's only response was \"oh i forgot\".  Several of my friends who sat at another table did not even get theirs at all.  \n\nTo top it off, at the end of the night, 2 and a half hours later, when everyone finally got their meal and was ready to pay and leave, the waitress asked for the payment minutes after she gave the bill to us.  Can she have been any more rude?!?

I figured it'd be worth a shot since I was in the mood for some Japanese food. I think the unfortunate part was that although they were nice enough to reserve a table for us, there was a rather large birthday party in session.\n\nBecause of that, the service was moderately slow, but we were fairly patient. Besides, we understood what was going on. Still... one of my friends didn't receive his order for another ten or fifteen minutes after we all got ours, and when we got the (rather expensive) bill we realized they had botched it up and we almost wound up paying about $20 more than we were supposed to. Good thing we caught it.\n\nTo be fair, the food here is pretty good. Between the six of us we got a bit of everything - sushi, donburi, udon, and combination bento boxes, all of which was well made and tasted authentic. The price was a bit much for the quantity though, in my opinion. Definitely not a place I'd want to come on a daily basis, less it burns a hole in my wallet.\n\nIn terms of the space, it's very well designed, with a wide open central area and a few semi-enclosed spaces for hot pots and smaller groups. It looks like it's recently been remodeled too; either that or they just keep everything in really nice condition. The decor is pretty quaint as well.\n\nI'm sure I'd be willing to give Kufuya another shot, especially considering the testimony of my friends who've been here multiple times, as well as some of the positive reviews on Yelp. My experience was probably unfortunate rather than purely a bad one, but I can't justify giving them more than three stars for now. Sorry!", "author": "Will C."}

The workers there are always friendly and customer service would be a 5\\5. After a long week of work and everything I always choose kufuya to go to for a nice dinner. I LOVE THEIR SAUCE! especially with alot of red peppers. It's the shizznat (: Me and my group of friends threw couple of birthday parties here.

Half of us wanted to do the buffet that was cheaply $22, but the other half didn't so since there was 9 of us, we were thinking we would sit at different ends of the table but the lady tried explaining the situation, confusing us even more. She said we had to sit at different table at the other end of the restaurant, but we tried telling her that we were going to sit at different ends and in the end she said \"if some of you want buffet then you can sit on this side, but the others can sit on the other side of the table.\" We were frustrated because it took a good 20 minutes trying to figure everything out when we had it right all along. ANYWAYS!\n\nSo 4 of us got all you can eat shabu and figuring out the menu was bleh. We used portable hot pot stove. It took forever for them to bring the soup out, we got our veggies and meat before the soup. We ordered the spicy miso soup. It tasted more like water than spicy miso soup. The dipping sauce was not what I was use to, but I gave it a shot and it was alright. The beef was ook, but I did stuff myself. \n\nThe service was okay, but I think they can improve. It didn't help they had friends or family at the other table so they would sometimes ignore us and constantly go to their table to chat. \n\nI don't think I'll be coming back here. Definitely sticking to my favorite shabu restaurants.", "author": "Cindy N."}

They have parking in the back where its 2 car slots with instructions where it says 1 car - park anywhere (very vague). \n\nNot really a shabu-table ready place like Shabu House or Coriya or sorts like that.. the service started out to be really nice. Little did I know as my friend had read reviews prior to selecting this place, they only carry beef for all you can eat along with veggies and the typical things you'd get. The service was nice, however 10 minutes into eating a waitress comes asking if that car was mine. I responded yes and she says thats now how I should park the car.. and suggested nicely but offensively that I should not do that next time. I'm wondering why are you telling me this when we're the ONLY customer in the restaurant? Since that I decided to get my money's worth. Six plates of beef was how much we had.. 2 plates were not fresh at all however I still ate it just to see the results. Out of the 4 waiter/ress it took us about an avg of 5-10 mins before getting we can actually get something when there were no one in the restaurant.. I find that very displeasing and was also told to move my car halfway into my dinner... \n\nnone the less I would not come back just because of how they treated us.", "author": "Ian C."}

They give you a pre-made dipping sauce (soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil) that I personally love because its the same sorta sauce I'd make at home.  Kufuya is a little out in the boondocks, but they have their own parking lot behind the restaurant.

We ordered the same, in hopes to fill up our empty stomaches with the all you can eat meat. The conclusion? Yes, it was filling but the beef was disappointing. First the soup base - I think it's a miso soup base. It was bland, tasted just like a pot of hot water combined with soy sauce. Then, the dipping sauce, it's supposed to be the house's special sauce. But again, didn't feel like it enhanced the food any better. Lastly, the beef. The beef was dry and the texture was coarse. I can imagine it to be sliced thinly from a piece of rough meat.
