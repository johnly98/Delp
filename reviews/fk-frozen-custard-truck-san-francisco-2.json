It's actually pretty damn good.\n\nI've been to this truck a few times at different Off the Grid events and festivals, and I can honestly say that their frozen custard is pretty standard. I'm pretty boring when it comes custard flavors because I usually stick to vanilla. Something about original vanilla custard just drives me wild. But for the more... \"adventurous\", they usually have at least 4 different custard flavors to choose from.\n\nBut the toppings?! I'll be adventurous with those! I'm a sucker for almonds and sauces on top. I would highly recommend the pairing of almonds and burnt caramel because it's simply delicious AF! A dynamic duo that will taste delicious on practically any flavor of frozen custard. If you wanna get wild and crazy with it, you can always make it into a sundae or a donut sandwich! They also sell donuts for purchase here, but I've never actually had them.\n\nThe prices are pretty comparable to any other frozen custard truck but all of those fancy toppings can add up quickly. I usually visit this truck while it's at the Pleasant Hill OTG and it never seems to be too crowded. But if you see them at Oakland First Friday's or any type of local festival, be prepared to wait. If you're a lover of frozen custard, I would give them a try.", "author": "Shayla B."}

Not only do they have unique flavors, but they also have various ways of presenting those flavors; whether it be simply in a cup, in a donut sandwich, bread pudding style, etc, and now they also have Frozen Kuhsterd BARS. Yes that's right, bars. \n\nI revisted Frozen Kuhsterd on National Ice Cream day at SOMA EATS, so you bet that they had something special in store for everyone. Their normal ice cream truck sadly had no line and I couldn't understand why and then I turned around and saw their frozen kuhsterd booth selling the bars and it all made sense - everyone was trying out their new creation! My friends and I still grabbed a scoop of ice cream from their normal truck to hold us over while we wait in line for the ice cream bar hehe. We tried the red velvet cookies and cream. The way I had imagined the ice cream to be from the sound of it was that it would be red velvet ice cream with crushed cookies inside of it. However what it ended up being was vanilla ice cream with red velvet cookies crushed inside of it, so there wasn't too much red velvet flavor in it. \n\nWe finally made our way through the line for the bars and we ordered their popular S'more's bar. I love the new ways people make s'more's! They use a vanilla ice cream bar, dip it in chocolate which acts as the adhesive for the graham cracker, then they smear marshmallow fluff on it and torch it. Sounds delicious right!? And the taste delivered! It was like eating a frozen s'more, something I would definitely have again!", "author": "Maleah M."}

The frozen custard was rich and creamy with great coffee flavor. The custard is actually really dense, so I didn't need much to satisfy my sweet tooth. In fact, I didn't even finish the scoop. You can also get your custard with toppings or in sundae or sandwich form.\n\nThe cashier was nice, but when I went to pay, she moved the iPad and I accidentally the $2 tip option. Apparently I didn't have to sign for anything as it processed right after. I tried saying something, but she was already moving on to the next customer. This is partly my fault as I should have been pushier. I would have tipped a $1 anyways, so it was only a $1 more.

I am not a frozen dessert snob, but I really could not tell the difference between FK's offerings and a large tub of Dryers from the grocery store. I do not mean to bash on them, but I was fairly disappointed they did not offer some of the odd ball flavors that Yelpers were posting pictures of on FK's page.

After all, I'm the one who orders caramel flan for dessert at a Mexican restaurant when others order churros. Custard pie was my favorite as a child. Not apple, not blueberry, but custard with the nutmeg sprinkled on top with a side of Cool Whip. So why was I not overjoyed when I saw this truck at the Friday Night Market at Civic Center? I think it's because I didn't grow up with it like Midwesterners did. You wouldn't buy it in the frozen food section of Jewel Supermarket. You had to get it fresh at a shop with a spigot big enough to let that intensely dense cream come out in a slow ooze.\n\nYou can tell there's a ton of butter fat and egg yolks in frozen custard to satisfy the high-risk sweet tooth.

And why not? They serve all the cool-sounding creations like the $6.50 Dynamo Donut Sandwich; the $6 Napa Style Sundae with burnt caramel, Himalayan salt and EVOO; and the absurd self-indulgence of the $16 \"FK Your Diet\" Sundae which sounds like your basic kitchen sink (photo: http://bit.ly/1xdFjop).\n\nJamie W. and I were feeling the need for a bit of dessert and decided to try the $6.50 S'mores Sundae which allowed us a choice of our own frozen custard flavor, two layers of honey graham crackers, chocolate syrup and toasted mini-marshmallows on top (photo: http://bit.ly/1Fzf9Oc). Although they offered temptations like White Coffee, Strawberry Basil and Thai Tea, both of us felt Vanilla Bean made the most sense given all the sweetness in that cup. I must be getting old because I found the concoction just way too sweet to enjoy fully with the best part the toasted marshmallows since they did evoke my days as a Cub Scout in front of the campfire with the scoutmaster leaning toward me and...uh, never mind.

I'm not sure what 'West Coast style frozen custard' is supposed to be, but I was curious to try.\nThey have a plethora of flavors, including the classic and familiar, some alcoholic, as well as some very strangely intriguing ones, like White Rabbit candy, Avocado, and Miso. Even their toppings are unique, like tapioca balls and ramen. \nIt seems like their trucks serve only a few flavors at a time, which makes sense. It wouldn't be the best use of their resources if they loaded up dozens of gallons of different flavors into a truck all at once.\nIt seems like Cereal Milk is very popular. I tried the one from Momofuku and while it was good, it wasn't amazing. So I got a double scoop of the Four Barrel Coffee & Thai Iced Tea for $5. Two generously sized mounds of custard plopped into a plastic cup. It was deliciously sweet and creamy, like I thought it would be. To me, both had an interesting gritty texture, probably from ground coffee beans and tea leaves(?).\n\nIt's cool that they have partnered with several local coffee & dessert shops and created some very decadent sundaes. It seems like they come up with new combinations all the time.\n\nKids Scoop: $2.50\nSingle: $3.50\nDouble: $5\nSundaes: ~$6-$7\n\nI'd be interested in trying out other flavors, especially White Rabbit candy, or Ube, or Coffee Mint Mojito.\nI enjoyed it, but I'm still left wondering what makes frozen custard different from ice cream? Also, what makes this custard 'West coast style'?", "author": "Joy W."}

So the first time I visited the Frozen Kuhsterd truck was a few years ago at SOMA Streat.  We actually shared a scoop of the milk tea flavor.  And everyone who knows me knows I don't do milk tea because I only like the fruity Americanized teas, but this was so good.  It had a teeny subtle tea flavor, and the milky flavor worked well the creaminess of the custard.  It was thick enough and not too sweet.  We also got to talk to the guys for a few minutes, they are so sweet!  \n\nFlash forward to last month at OTG Serramonte.  We just like a slew of other people still wanted dessert even when it was freezing cold.  So we waited in line for dessert.  But there were so many choices..I'm not gonna lie, I was tempted to get the cronut ice cream sandwich or a silvana ice cream sandwich.  But we kept it simple with a scoop of cookie butter custard.  It tasted just like the awesome Trader Joe's cookie butter, and was nice and creamy.  The single scoop is huge too, so you definitely get your money's worth here.  Maybe next time we'll be adventurous and get toppings, but the custard here doesn't need it at all, because it's great on its own.  \n\nGet some of their custard when you see these guys trucks and you won't be disapointed.  What if it's freezing out?  You still won't be disappointed for sure, because the satisfaction in your stomach will outweigh the cold.", "author": "Cat C."}

And then the guy, I don't remember his name, tells me that that the small scoop that I had was normal, and it shouldn't have been \"an issue\" and etcetera, claiming that he worked there for so long and that tiny tiny scoop is normal, since they apparently \"don't serve anything bigger, it's ALWAYS been this SMALL\". No, it has not always been that small; it's obvious from yelp pictures, personal experience, and word of mouth.\n\n***He tried to put the blame on me, and nagged at me for writing a review that was bad, saying that it wasn't their fault the scoop was tiny and defending himself/FK, even though I came in happy and didn't even inquire about the past incident.\n***Very Unprofessional and Whiny***\nThe employee kept addressing me as the \"girl who gave a bad review\", and this is no way to treat a customer.

I was the recipient of the hateful \"How can you be slim and eat all these frozen custard?\" glances (Hungry eyes, people, I order considerably more than I can eat). I was stopped by a few people so they can take a picture of my frozen treat. I was overwhelmed. But I ordered it and I stood by my order.\n\nSo, the frozen custard. Oh. My. Goodness. How did I exist on this Earth and not have had this amazingness a part of my life heretofore? The custard is smooth and rich, creamy and not overwhelmingly sweet. It is difficult to decide which one of the flavors that day was my favorite, but I can tell you that mixing all four flavors together in one bite was heaven. The Nutella cupcake was moist and delicious, and the salt from the salted caramel doughnut counterbalanced all the sweetness going on in my palate. Their FK Your Diet Sundae may have been a monster, but I want that monster to hide under my bed so I can have it for midnight snack. I want that monster to be my friend.\n\nI did not finish the sundae, but I am a certified Frozen Kuhsterd fan. Till next week at OTG: Pleasant Hill (yup, I know you will be there June 11th and 25th)! Your Halo-Halo Sundae and I have a date!", "author": "Clarice O."}

The menu seems to differ from day to day, but thankfully they were handing out samples when I came, so that was helpful in making my decision.  \n\nI visited them (or more accurately, was on a MISSION to find them) at their tent at Maker Faire. Their prices were a tad higher than usual due to vendor fees, so a single scoop was $4, while a double scoop was $6, and toppings were 50 cents each, including burnt caramel, sprinkles, chocolate and strawberry sauces, etc. I ordered a single scoop of cookies and cream (a safe flavor for me) with chocolate sauce. The flavor of the chocolate sauce was a little off but it wasn't a big deal because the frozen custard was still good! I sampled the cereal milk flavor, but it might be an acquired taste. My boyfriend got the donut sundae, and they had some interesting (but delicious-sounding) types of donuts for that. The size was slightly smaller than we thought it'd be, however the owner mentioned he had to use smaller donuts for this event. I guess I just need to visit them at their truck instead sometime!\n\nThere is a check-in offer for 1 free topping and 1 free sticker. With that, my scoop with one topping was only $4, and you get a cute sticker of their mascot.\n\nI think my expectations were too high because I was a teeeeny bit underwhelmed afterwards. Everything was pretty good, but I was not blown away like I thought I would be, and it was a little pricey for the size (given, these prices were a little higher than normal). I would still come back though, for the creative flavors and combinations...aaand because I am a dessert addict and I want to try their \"FK Your Diet\" sundae, Cookie Monster, and boba sundae.

Frozen Kuhsterd isn't as thick as ice cream and not quite as thin as frozen yogurt. It's somewhere in between but it is definitely rich and creamy. I can't get enough of it. I feel like there is always something new every week. It surely keeps it interesting and has me wanting more and more. I think their newest creation was the white rabbit candy turned into Frozen Kuhsterd. One things for sure, it never gets boring here and it's exciting to see what else they come up with!\n\nThe first time I tried Frozen Kuhsterd I had the burnt caramel with the burnt caramel topping. Anyone who loves caramel has to order this! The second time I ordered the cookie monster and halo halo bread pudding (which was one of the specials that week). The cookie monster was exactly how it sounds! It came with three different cookies with two different kuhsterd flavors. I ordered the coffee and cookie butter kuhsterd flavors. Super delicious and I'm pretty much addicted to cookie butter in general. The halo halo bread pudding was satisfying and it was a good mix. I also tried a mini roti kuhsterd bun from Honeyberry. If you've ever had a roti bun from Honeyberry, you can already imagine how good it is with a scoop of Frozen Kuhsterd! It's a match made in heaven! \n\nLastly, I always say- no matter how cold or foggy it is outside, there is always room for Frozen Kuhsterd! Now go and get some!", "author": "Jennifer D."}

Forget Italian Ice, gelato, froyo, or ice cream, kuhsterd in the frozen form is where it's at. As a current east coaster facing unbearable summer humidity, it's hard not to seethe from jealousy after trying the myriad of flavors they have available day in and out.\n\nThere is no shortage of wonderful flavors, all must be sampled at some point. There are seasonal concoctions and lots of \"premium / exclusive\" flavors worthy of palate experimentation. One cannot go wrong with any of them, which means it's a win-win for all!\n\nMy favorites from their exclusive flavor line are: Ube (purple yam), Black Sesame, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Vanilla Bean, and Maple Butter. If you're looking for something with a bit more \"umph\" it's time to move to the premium bunch of frozen kuhsterd. Ones like Reposado Tequila, Buena Vista, Red Velvet Cake Batter, and the Coffee Mint Mojito are straight game changers. It's all stupidly good that wanting another is only a natural reaction.\n\nThe dudes running the truck are super friendly and they sure know how to turn a profit. From around $3.50 a scoop or $5 for two, some folks might wince a bit considering the portion size. If it's just about the experience, throw in some extra $ for a dynamo donut or waffle. Sprinkle some bits of extra toppings to really make it rain.\n\nOne last request: Please come to New York?", "author": "Jando S."}

Upon closer inspection I realized this is the same \"bibingka\" from the motherland. \n\nPeaked my interest and peaked my taste buds. First a lesson in Bibingka- Bibingka is a type of rice cake from the Philippines traditionally eaten during the Christmas season. There are different variations, oh but the taste. For me it's not just the taste but  the fond memories of Post-Christmas eve mass...So, naturally I stood in line for this \"bibingka sundae\" - the sundae came with a scoop of thai iced tea custard layered in between 2 slices of miniature bibingka cakes and drizzled with ube (purple yam/taro sauce.) \n\nWhat a brilliant way to turn an unexpecting bibingka into a masterpiece - which instantly reduced me to a fond childhood memory. Bravo Frozen Kuhsterd!\n\nThey also had a surprising take on the ice cream sandwich - not with cookies but with miniature donuts - I mean holy hell (Donut) HOLE - amazing.

It was delicious!\n\nThe maple bacon donut: I could do without this. The donut wasn't as light and fluffy like I like and the bacon tasted really weird. There was too much grease or something and it set off the sweetness of the whole dessert. There was just something about the bacon taste that I wasn't a fan of.\n\nSalted Caramel: I'm not usually a fan of this, but I decided to try it based on the raves of other yelpers. This was actually really good. I like the sweetness of the caramel and it had a really good and not too sticky consistency.\n\nMy sister also got a mini peppermint chocolate cupcake - good, though taste like any other peppermint chocolate cupcake.

The wait was about 5-10 minutes, which wasn't that bad because the employees are super friendly and very welcoming. My sister and I decided to share a \"Boba Guys Sundae\" with a choice of custard (we opted for vanilla bean) topped with condensed milk, and what I assumed was Boba Guys' almond jelly and boba. The total for the sundae was $7, which is a tad bit pricy in my opinion, but was sooooo worth it!\n\nBoba Guys Sundae - This dessert was definitely worth the calories! Boba, almond jelly, condensed milk, and vanilla bean custard was the perfect combination for a chilly night at OtG.

By its nature, I think Frozen Custard is such a great product, and as such, I think Frozen Kuhsterd is a great food truck.\n\nHowever, even though Frozen Custard is great, the flavors here didn't really pop.  They aren't the best flavored (or maybe I just tried the wrong flavors), and there is a really small selection, so in a place with actual competition(like the Dallas area), it might not do so well.  But since there are no other options, I am a fan of Frozen Kuhsterd for even existing.\n\nBesides the Frozen Custard, they also offer some baked goods like Dynamo Donuts(unique flavored donuts) and bread puddin' so that they can make bread puddin' sundaes or donut sammiches.  Those options sound cool and would love to try sometime.  Looking through the pictures on Yelp, it appears that they also make really unique items every once and awhile as well.  I like experimental food items and would love to try them sometime.", "author": "Jason S."}

I feel fortunate to have gotten the chance to catch up with this food truck (they only make frozen custard) when they came down the peninsula to Hiller Airplane Museum. We tried four scoops and enjoyed them all as they were smooth and creamy as they should be. The toppings made them even punier, elevating them to a gourmet treat. The strawberry topping is homemade and you can really taste it, its Devine. Marshmallows toasted to perfection, with a slight char on them really brought a lot of flavor to the party (if you're not a fan of the charm try these they are so good that they might make you a believer.\n\nI did start with my toughest test, vanilla. If they can get vanilla right then you know that they are paying attention and care about the product they are serving you. Their vanilla is good enough that I ordered  second cup so I could focus on their yummy toppings. I recommend that you ask for samples because everything I tasted was so yummy that I can't ecocide just one. Give them a try and pick your own favorites.\n\nThe service was excellent prices reasonable, and the owner, Jason was super friendly, was happy to answer my million questions patiently and thoroughly. The speed of service was very good and in the two hours tat I hung out at the food event I did not spot one error. Every single customer was very happy.\n\n=======\n\nSince Frozen Custard is new to the West Coast I though I'd offer a guide to get everyone interested up to speed:\n\nFrozen custard was invented in Coney Island New York in 1919 and is essentially ice cream with added egg yolks which gives it a creamier texture. It was popularized in the 1933 Chicago World's Fair which is why I believe that most people erroneously believe that frozen custard is a Midwest only treat. It actually has existed on the East Coast (I remember enjoying it in the sixties and seventies in New York City) and is still available there, albeit not as easy to find as in the Midwest.\n\nBecause true frozen custard is very dense, the maker can adjust how much air it contains as the cream is stirred (air is not added or pumped in) during its creation. The most dense frozen custards will only have 15 to 35% air (overrun) but in some regions, frozen is served as a \"Soft Serve\" with 100% overrun (meaning that it is half air). This causes a lot of confusion with soft serve ice creams, but the two actually are different products.\n\nIce cream by definition in the US, is: a frozen dairy dessert that contains between 10% and 16% milkfat; 9 to 12% milk solids-not-fat (this where the casein and whey protein are located plus carbs; 12% to 16% sweeteners; 0.2% to 0.5% stabilizers and emulsifiers (yuck) and finally 55% to 64% naturally occurring water. If the ice cream has air intentionally pumped into it (most except gourmet ice creams have huge amounts of air in them) then these numbers would be lowered to as much as half of what is listed here.\n\nIf you add egg to that, then you get a frozen custard however, different people and different regions, make it differently. Some adjust their machines to work the custard a little more which traps more air into it so they can over it as soft serve, some add so many egg yolks that it takes on an eggy yellow tint.\n\nIn the US a frozen custard, according to the FDA, is suppose to have at least 10% milk fat and at least 1.4% egg yolk solids. FDA Frozen Desserts 21 CFR 135.110(a)(2)\n\nI recall seeing recipes in New York calling for egg yolks to be added but they called it an Ice Cream or a rich ice cream or a premium ice cream even though they were technically frozen custards. I suspect there are a lot more people out there enjoying frozen custard than actually realize it.\n\nMy favorite frozen custards are the ones that are eggy (otherwise why bother) and firm (low percentage of air in it) because they are most different from gourmet ice cream.", "author": "Bob L."}

I can taste the sea salt which gave it an interesting taste mixed with the Carmel. Yummy in my tummy as I took my time eating it. I was impressed that it came with a thick and big blue  spoon. I will keep this sturdy spoon. :-) Next time, if I am the area on a Tuesday, I'll be sure to stop by.", "author": "Priscilla L."}

Really nice guy, he was totally open to criticism and was super friendly, and I've been considering doing my own food start-up and he gave me a lot of tips.\n\nHis custard is denser than ice cream, more smooth, and it actually freezes at a higher temperature so it doesn't hit your mouth as cold as ice cream. The flavor last night was Pumpkin Cheesecake and while it had a deliciously strong cheesecake flavor, my friend and I couldn't taste the pumpkin as much. I noticed it a little when I went back for seconds. The graham cracker crust crumbles on top add nicely to the flavor, giving it a much more authentic cheesecake feel.\n\nJason was also really cool about taking suggestions for flavors too. He draws  inspiration from our shared faves - Momofuku Milk Bar, Humphrey's Secret Breakfast. We also both LOVE Bi-Rite's roasted banana.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

As with most great inventions, Jason confirmed my suspicions that it was created on a fluke and I am so thankful for this wonderful discovery!! I'm surprised I never thought of it myself because I used to drink Jameson like it was my job, paired with cereal and milk as the perfect hangover cure but I never thought of actually ingesting the two together and thank goodness someone was thinking out of the box (or really really drunk) when they created this heavenly concoction. \n\nWhen I think of cornflakes in milk, I automatically think of nasty soggy cornflake chunks that have been sitting in milk too long and are falling apart and hanging together for dear life but this version is NOT even like that!! The cornflake is such a sweet little surprise in constrast to the smooth creamy texture, and then TA-DA, here comes that Jameson flavor to heighten the experience even more. I swear, it was a party in my mouth and only Frozen Kuhsterd was invited. \n\nThe cookies & cream flavor was okay too but SCM stole the show and seemed to be a crowd fave, perhaps b/c it's so \"different?\" I wanted to ask them about other liquor infused flavors in the future (Hennessy Sugar Cone, or Vodka Cranberry perhaps? Let's patent this now!) but didn't want to seem like an alcoholic. I was already a groupie at their table the whole night asking for seconds as well as bumming off Mary-Anne & Yohanna's seconds, and then eventually thirds. I probably would've eaten out of the container if they hadn't ran out and plus I started to get drunk off it (just kidding, maybe, maybe not) and plus my stomach started to hurt (really though but it was my fault, not theirs). Major crackhead status with the Spiked Cereal Milk. Like, seriously. Even up to now, I still can't stop thinking about it. I need counseling for my obsession and withdrawal, it's almost frightening.\n \nThe only advice I have for them is why aren't these small batches packaged yet??!!! Let's expand on the business development, and commercialize a little bit, unless you want me to stalk you and I'll totally eat up all your supply everywhere you go.

Why?\n\nBecause ice cream shops always serve up flavors that you would never find in real life. Would you ever *eat* a rocky road of your own volition? Not a real rocky road, but a smattering of nuts, chocolate chips, and marshmallows? No. And so general ice cream flavors are commoditized, shops are fine peddling them, and reviewing such product is a lot like eating dutch crunch from three different sandwich shops and claiming that one is head over heels.\n\nBut what if your ice cream was something more? If it were measured not along a dimension of \"flavor,\" but a dimension of experience? Like the good old fashioned soda machine days, before coca cola and Pepsi owned 90% of the market? Ice cream flavors like Cereal Milk? or Thai Tea?\n\nI can feel myself getting too into this review already, so I'm going to cut it short.

The Four Barrel Coffee has a strong, smooth and chocolate notes coffee frozen custard,but this wasn't too rich. On the other hand, you got to try the Thai Tea (one of their seasonal flavors),a distinctive Thai ice tea in frozen custard that tingle my taste buds wanting more. These flavors are exceptional on their own. \nI tried their Burnt caramel bread pudding sundae,so you can choose 1 flavor with bread pudding and their owned Burnt caramel. I would rate this as a 4.5 because the bread pudding complemented well with the Thai tea frozen custard but the Burnt caramel was thick buy cloying sweet. I didn't taste burnt notes of caramel though. This sundae is too sweet but it was kind of comforting because of the bread pudding. It tasted like the Spotty Dick, an English bread pudding that had some spices but the Burnt Caramel was the sauce. Of course, the sundae was topped with freshly made whipped cream. This cost $6 .\nYou should try their Napa style sundae= it's their vanilla bean frozen custard with a light EVOO  (not too strong olives oil but good for dessert), and their caramel sauce. Don't let EVOO fool you or stray away for just trying their sundae. Also,try their donut or cookie ice cream sandwiches.Yummmm.....:)\nOnly dessert ice cream truck I would go back to try for dessert. They had 4 featured flavors at that time during the Fremont Street Eats (Vanilla Bean, Strawberry, White Chocolate Mint and Thai Tea). \nCheck on their Twitter and their website where they are going to be at. This custard was 4.5 because it was smooth, dense and  the flavors were phenomenal. They will rotate 4 flavors at a time, and sell baked goods like cupcakes,  and few other baked goods from Mission Hills Bakery and Dynamo Donuts. Then they partnered Four Barrel Coffee to make a signature coffee frozen custard. Then Frozen Khusterd makes over 30 original and seasonal flavors of this frozen dessert. They are the only dessert food truck that makes excellent frozen custard in the West Coast. Try it and you won't regret it.\nService is 6/5. I mean the girl was a sweetheart and gave me 2 samples because of my indecisiveness between the Four Barrel Coffee and Thai Tea flavors.

Their custards like Cereal Milk, Dirty Chai, and Burnt Caramel can stand on their own. But when I have dessert, I want the whole shebang. The first time I tried them at the Asian Street Festival in the TL, I tried the cereal milk sundae with condensed milk and cinnamon toast crunch and thought that would be my fave but I was blown away with the one with azuki beans and matcha syrup. The balance of flavors was perfect. \n\nAt the Eat Real Festival, I tried their interpretation of halo halo with custard atop flan with puffed rice - I need the crunch. I love liege waffles so this sundae with a mini bacon waffle is really what convinced me to stop by the ERF. It did not disappoint. \n\nI'm so over most mediocre food trucks and food concepts that just pile creamy, rich crap on top of fried grease.

Great product, great flavors (they have tons to choose from) and most importantly great people running the business.  Hopefully they can open up a store so I do not have to keep chasing down their truck! Keep it up! \n\nThe coffee \"Kuhsterd\" is a must try!

I was surprised at the taste of the custard and couldn't decide if I actually liked it or not.  I was a little blue that I didn't find Mr. Blue to be as amazing as everyone said it would be.  \n\nThey were at the SF Mad Dash and their flavors were very limited.  For my first cheat treat after running the 5K, I got vanilla bean with caramel and cinnamon toast crunch.  My FAVORITE cereal!  All 3 flavors blended nicely but there was something weird about the custard.  I can't quite put my finger on it but it threw me off a bit and I didn't want to waste any more calories eating it.  I wasn't wasting much because their portions are so tiny.  And for the price!  Talk about highway robbery.  $7 for about 1/2 a scoop of custard, I squirt of caramel and 1 tablespoon cinnamon toast crunch.  The portions were prefect actually but not for the price.  Either lower the price with the same portions of give more portions for the same price.\n\nI give them 3 stars for now because I only had one flavor and would really like to try their other flavors, like the mint flavor.  The idea of the custard ice cream is really new to me so I think it's going to take some getting used too.  I'm willing to give Mr. Blue another chance if he doesn't make me blue again.", "author": "Victoria C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-10-01", "description": "After standing about forty minutes in line it was somewhat worth it. I had a bacon waffle with a scoop of vanilla custard and burnt caramel sauce. The custard is as expected - good. Tasty stuff with good consistency. If it's a hot day it will melt quickly. The caramel sauce is done very well and adds to the tastiness. The flavor of the bacon waffle turned out better than I expected. It's pretty salty but if you eat everything together it's somewhat magical.\n\nMy biggest gripe would be the freshness of the waffle. The waffle was REALLY stale. It's a leige waffle so I wasn't expecting anything airy, but I couldn't even cut it with the given spoon. I ended up having to eat it with my hand. If something isn't fresh they should just take it off the menu. I would have rather just gone with two scoops of custard than the waffle option. Oh and my last gripe would be the portion size. It's rather small for $3 you get less than a 1/4 full of a plastic cup.\n\nThe organization within the truck was ridiculous. The workers were looking at tickets super confused and disorganized like they have never done it before. Simplify the menu and organize your food line. There's no reason why it should have gone that slow for custard that's already made and needs only one or two toppings.", "author": "Michael H."}

Therefore, you know an item is too sweet if even I think so. I had high hopes for FK given the 4.5 stars and multiple reviews. After one failed attempt at trying this food truck at SOMA, I was finally able to make a date for this place when it was at Off the Grid: Serramonte. I started the trek by creating room in my tummy. This began with the idea to run two laps around Lake Merced and ended with one lap around LM. I braved the cold and wind standing in line to order the match sundae, which included green tea syrup, red beans, whipped cream, and your choice of custard. I chose the Thai iced tea flavor. Maybe it was the custard flavor that made the sundae too sweet but halfway through it, I had a fleeting thought that I should save the rest because of the sugar level.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-11", "description": "Having lived in SF for almost 20 years, I am thrilled to see the new interest in frozen custard.  I am a native of St. Louis where frozen custard is legendary, not a novelty at all.\n\nFor it to even exist on the West Coast or SF is somewhat of a miracle.  I love Frozen Kuhsterd for that.  I do have a criticism, however.  The focus on quality needs to improve.  I noticed that there were ice crystals in my 4 barrel coffee 2 scoop.    Frozen custard should not have ice crystals.  Perhaps the focus should be on the quality of the mouth feel, not on coming up with new flavors.  At the legendary Ted Drewes in St. Louis, the smoothness quality is the focus.  The huge variety of topping options is what is supposed to jazz up frozen custard.\n\nAccording to Ted Drewes' website, \"By definition, frozen custard must have at least 10% butterfat and 1.4% eggyolk.  The amount of air, also known as overrun, truly separates frozen custard from traditional ice cream.  Frozen custard has 20% overrun or less.  This reduction of air is what give frozen custard its silky smooth texture.\"  http://www.teddrewes.com/sitecontent/dynamiccontent.aspx?pid=76&uid=D18D6B6C-7948-4C04-8F59-12F77F9F3F49 \n\nPerhaps the key to quality is having it freshly made, rather than flash frozen or stored at sub-zero temperatures.  Could producing it on site inside the truck be possible, rather than transporting it from a production facility, which I understand Frozen Kuhsterd does?  \n\nCustard is made by sending it from a refrigerated hopper through a valve into a freezing chamber lined with beaters. The frozen custard is pushed through (extruded) out the front of the special machine and into a waiting bucket, ready to be served. Because it is not held in the chamber, there is very little air, known as overrun, beaten into the custard. This low overrun creates the dense and creamy texture.\n\nBy comparison, soft-serve custards, yogurts, and ice creams are made using what is known as a batch freezer, where the mixture remains in the machine and the overrun is as much as 100%, causing ice crystals to form. Frozen custard should not have ice crystals.  (See also http://www.thedairygodmother.com/what-is-frozen-custard/).", "author": "A. N."}

My husband was thrilled that this lil frozen custard shop was actually a food truck, so he was sold after sighting it a block away. I had the vanilla bean custard with strawberry sauce (actual sauce with whole strawberries) and condensed milk. The custard itself is super creamy and you can tell they use a lot of egg yolk from the richness of the flavor, much like creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The strawberry sauce tasted homemade and I just flat out love condensed milk. My husband has the cinnamon custard which tasted exactly like cinnamon toast crunch cereal. He had caramel over his. Very good!", "author": "Kae H."}

I'm very picky with desserts, but it was love at first bite. To be honest, it's a bad idea for me to have custard in the first place since I'm lactose intolerant. BUT I cannot and won't stop. It's so worth it even while I'm racing and hoping I make it to the bathroom afterwards. Anyways I've had the pleasure of trying all the other flavors by now and I absolutely love the basil strawberry custard and the Thai Tea is a close second. Try it if they have it. It's super refreshing and not too sweet! & if that doesn't tickle your fancy, just ask the employees of FK. They know best when it comes down to what will satisfy your needs.
