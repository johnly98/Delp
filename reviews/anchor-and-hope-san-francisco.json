It's a loft-like dock-style room with ropes dangling from the rafters.  The seats are metal chairs and the tables are bare hardwood. It can get a little loud but that's part of the fun. Think boisterous send-off party vs romantic or business lunch. \n\nFresh seafood here is first rate. The ceviche at A+H is one of the highlights, in my opinion: shrimp, fish, squid in a citrusy vinegrette served with house-made chips. It's delish. Their salmon, sand dabs, Louis salads are all made with fresh local creatures and prepared to showcase the seafood's flavor. Just avoid anything that says \"battered\" as it'll come in dough thicker than a kitchen mitt and drenched in oil. \n\nTheir sandos -- lobster roll, burgers -- are served on brioche-type bread, and pretty much most folks I've eaten with there say it's just too much bread. They wind up taking half the bread off. I'd say skip the sandwiches and go for fresh fish. \n\nThere's a decent wine list and beer selection here.", "author": "Lanny B."}

To my surprise, Anchor & Hope was also one of the places I read about on an article of SF restaurants serving lobster rolls. \n\nAnchor & Hope has a pretty upscale decor and I enjoyed looking at the art work they had on their walls. Seems like dinner service here can get busy so I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time or getting here early enough to grab spots at the bar where they don't have a time limit. \n\nTIP: HH is 4PM-6PM\n\n+ $1 oysters for HH - The oysters are on the smaller side of things but for $1 I'll take them. They pair them with their own mignonette sauce & cocktail sauce on the side. \n\n+ Lobster Roll ($31) - I'm a sucker for lobster rolls and this one was a roll I had to try. Was it worth $31? In my opinion not really, but I am glad I tried it. The lobster wasn't overcooked but there was few pieces of it. However, the bread they paired it was nice and fluffy/buttery that it just melted in your mouth. I wish they had some extra melted butter on the side for dipping as well, but you can only get it dressed in butter or aioli. The lobster roll is also paired with 5 of their tater tots and coleslaw. The tater tots was perfectly crispy while the coleslaw offered a nice bite/change in texture from the rest of the dish. \n\nWe also grabbed some of their $5 HH drinks. They have a stout, hefe, and from what I remember two wine options. \n\nService at the bar was also pretty hands off. If you want to see the full dinner menu you'll need to ask your server.  \n\nOverall, Anchor & Hope was a nice place to try in SF, but I gotta admit, New England Lobster still has my lobster roll loving heart. Their happy hour menu wins you over with their $1 oysters, but the rest of the menu doesn't have other unique options that would entice me to come back as I could go to other places for a cheaper price.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

We came for drinks and tastes before a reservation elsewhere, but we hoped the feeling and food would inspire a return visit.

Our baby seafood tower (we got the smallest one) came quickly, as did the fresh ceviche and house potato chips and drinks.\n\nThe space was beautiful overall and the fish impeccably fresh, but service was a little bumpy, despite trying to communicate a limited time window.

I reserved a table for 5:45 PM.\n\nUpon arriving, the hostess asked me if we were here for dinner service. I said yes, but we'd also like to order off the happy hour menu before happy hour ended at 6 PM. She said that if we reserved a dinner table we weren't allowed to order off the happy hour menu as happy hour was \"walk-ins only,\" and then said that if we did want to order off the happy hour menu and still sit at the table we reserved, she could make an exception but we would have to give up our table at 6:30 PM and leave. I was unsure if I actually heard her correctly as this sounded like an absolutely absurd policy, so I responded for confirmation, \"So you're telling me that I'm not allowed to order off the happy hour menu because it's 'walk-in' only? And that you can make an exception but that we would get kicked out of the restaurant at 6:30 PM and have to give up our table?\" She looked at me, completely serious, and responded \"That is correct as we are booked for the rest of the evening.\"\n\nI didn't want to be hassled with finding another place to go, so I told her fine, we'll do dinner service only. As soon as I sat down at our table, I saw people getting up from the bar and leaving, and more people walking into the restaurant and heading straight for the bar to sit down without even stopping by the hostess stand. At that point, I went up and asked one of bartenders if the bar was open seating. I was told that it was, that we could stay as long as we wanted and could order off BOTH the dinner and the happy hour menu there as the bar was FULL SERVICE. *Insert Facepalm Emoji* Why didn't the hostess just SAY so then?! A simple \"Reservations are for dinner service only, but the bar is full service and first-come-first-served\" would have saved me so much time and prevented confusion. What a waste of time and a convoluted answer to such a simple problem!\n\nIn any case, once my friend and I got situated, we ordered two dozen dollar oysters, a seafood platter (with clams, shrimp, remoulade, ceviche, etc.), and finally a plate of mussels along with some wine. The food was average at best, and some of the oysters were very grimy and had chunks of mud/seaweed/sea gunk on them. But no matter. We were there to catch up and have a good time so we just ate our food and kept to ourselves!\n\nWhile we reminisced about our life back in the Midwest, we asked the bartender out of curiosity if they carried Malort, a type of alcohol popular in the Midwest but seemingly nowhere else. The bartender responded, \"No...what is that?\" As my friend began explaining to her what it was, the bartender turned her back and walked away from us while my friend was MID-SENTENCE. Mind you, the tab was ~$198 and we tipped the bartender ~$40. Guess the bartender figured since we already gave her a good chunk of money, she was no longer required to give a sh*t.\n\nBottom line - rude, unprofessional staff. Mediocre, forgettable food.

I'm so glad we found it! \n\nWe started by trying a few wines before purchasing a bottle of delicious Chardonnay. \n\nNext up, we ordered the seafood platter. The large fed 6 people perfectly with clams, oysters, shrimp, ceviche and (my favorite) crab salad. The oysters and clams were incredibly fresh. But the shrimp had too much shell left on. And the cocktail sauce was perfectly spicy with the amount of horseradish. \n\nAs for entrees, I highly, highly recommended the clam chowder. It was loaded with fresh clams. Skip the table bread and asked for the grilled bread that comes with the fish stew. Excellent stuff. \n\nThe fish stew also got rave reviews - especially the fish - though, I found the the tomato broth to have a strong vinegar flavor. Other friends had the salmon and another grilled fish - both great. \n\nThe only downside was finding this place. When we finally found the entrance on a side alley, two tractors were outside, which didn't give the best impression. The restaurant didn't disappoint once we went inside, though.", "author": "Danielle D."}

The staff seemed a bit disorganized because a few always look frustrated or lost. One was dropping glasses on the floor... standing there in disbelief and annoyance with a fellow coworker.

I did not like it at all but luckily it tasted better than it smelled. The table to my right had clam chowder and the smell of it smelled like.. the taste of the mussels after a while, which was good I Guess. In the end, I still devoured the whole plate of mussels. \n\nIron Skillet Steak (3/5 Stars)\n- Whenever I see iron skillet on the menu, I'm getting it ! This was rather disappointing. The steak was overcooked and the taste was just meh. It wasn't GREAT but it wasn't THAT good either. It was chewy. I only had a slice and was done with it.

Perhaps I just haven't tried enough places, but I don't think there are a lot of places in the city you can get such a good lobster roll with a coastal vibe. The decor is nice and I just love how much natural light this place gets. \n\nWe went with the express intent of trying the lobster roll. Even for a lobster roll, it's pretty pricey at $30 - I'd note average somewhere closer to 25. It's not the best I've ever had, but it's a strong contender. The amount of lobster is good, and the dressing it tasty but not overpowering. The tots the roll comes with are HUGE and remind me absurdly of the Giants' Causeway. Since they're so big they're a bit doughier than your average tot, but still tasty. We also had the mussels with green curry which was delish. They provide complimentary chips and dip that are quite tasty and a nice change from the usual bread. \n\nOverall great place albeit a bit on the pricey side - but it's seafood so that's to be expected.

This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend because I wanted seafood. I think I would have been better off eating seafood at one of the restaurants near the Pier. \nWe got to the restaurant 5 minutes before they opened, and we didn't realize how early we were. A lady with a short boy hair cut, dark hair, came to us and asked us if we needed help. We told her we had a dinner reservation, and she said \"We are not opened yet. We will be opened in a few minutes. Please come back then.\" No offer to just wait near at the hostess area with a drink or so...I mean it's just 5 minutes.. anyway, we decided to leave and grab a cocktail at the neighboring bar. (minus a star for that\nWhen we got to the restaurant, we were seated with the friendly hostess and waitress (+1 star for that). \nMy date was bummed out that they did not have a full bar (minus a star for that). \nI ordered the Sole and he ordered the clam chowder and crab cakes (as his dinner). They came out with the clam chowder first. I told the server to make sure to bring out the crab cakes out with my dinner, because my date ordered the two appetizers as his \"dinner\". The clam chowder was amazing. He ordered a cup, which looked like a bowl. Makes me wonder how big a bowl of clam chowder would be. (+1 star)\nMy sole was super SALTYYYYYYYYYYYY and the couscous had no flavor at all. I guess the chef decided to just pour salt all over my sole and leave the couscous bland.??? I did not enjoy my dish at all. (minus 1 star)\nNow on to the douchiness of the wait staff: 1. When the waiter delivered our food he said, \"Here is your dinner\" and to my date, \"here is your appetizer\". Like does he really have to clarify what it is? FYI, My date ordered two appetizers as his dinner.... 2. The waiter sat a couple behind us. He was trying to upsell water \"would you like sparkling water or regular?\" The couple said regular water is fine . He made it clear , that he didn't get the upsell, that regular was just tap water.. He repeated \"Okay tap water.\" Really? You have to say tap, when he didn't mention that before? The waiter left, in which I said, \"tap water taste just as fine. It seems to be filtered.\" 3. Service seemed really slow and the restaurant was not even full (minus 2 stars).\nIn fairness the women hostess and woman waitress were very friendly and nice. I don't think I'll be back though because the food was not as good as I thought it would be, there is no full bar (my mistake for not looking at the information on yelp), and because of how \"douchy\" the male staff seem to be.", "author": "Ivy R."}

It looked delicious but imo pretty over priced. $8 for one. \n- 1 order of fries. DELICIOUS! Fries are always amazing. $6. \n- 1 order of beer steamer PEI mussels  - there were about 8 mussels total. $8.

Anchor and Hope has been in our SF rotation lately and always turns out to be a solid meal.  \n\nThey've got a lot of raw bar options and I've always been happy with what I've chosen, so that's where I started.  As we were putting together our plan (collectively planning all aspects of a meal is a thing, right?) a manager sensed our uncertainty and stepped in to assist.  I geeked out for a bit as he was a dead ringer for Negan.  But, instead of bludgeoning me with Lucille he played savior and guided us along with our decisions and got me going with the daily selection of oysters.  My wife wasn't feeling them, therefore I embarked solo on that effort: Miyagi, Pickering Pass, and Cape Cod.  A beet salad to open for the little lady and calamari to share.  As usual I loved the oysters once again here.  They're always fresh, tasty and well presented with various dipping sauces.  The beet salad had a bunch of different beets and greens and my wife loved it.  Calamari was some of the best we've had and was perfectly lightly fried.  \n\nFor our mains my wife got the Ling cod and I, once again, opted for the lobster roll.  A&H really excel at what I like to think of as classic seafood fare: fish&chips, raw bar and this delectable lobster roll.  Lump lobster meat piled high on one of those perfect split down the middle rolls accompanied by house made slaw and monstrous tater tots.  No filler at all with it and I love it every time I get it.

Beyond just the look of the place though (modern, casual), their seafood-centric menu is pretty terrific, in addition to a great selection of beers that also includes a cask variety.\n\n-- \"ANGELS ON HORSEBACK\" - Smoked Bacon Wrapped Oysters, Remoulade...$15\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anchor-and-hope-san-francisco?select=LjXOcUm1y__2-foBUrsg_g)\nI'm generally cool on cooked oysters, but these are the angelic exceptions.  The oysters were meaty and juicy enough (read: not dried out) and those long cuts of bacon added a nice salty, smokiness.  Admittedly though, the (slight) downside to the latter was that the bacon was a bit overpowering.\n\n-- ANCHOR & HOPE LOBSTER ROLL - Pain de Mie Bun, Tater Tots, Stevie's Coleslaw...$29\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anchor-and-hope-san-francisco?select=IntQcWqsFdBoziAAm3tvTg)\nWoodhouse's is still my favorite, but this one is up there.  The chunks of lobster were sizable, fresh, and had a tinge of sweetness that was complemented nicely by the dressing.  The only thing holding it back was the bun, which dried out every bite.  As for the sides, the slaw was okay, but the tots didn't disappoint - huge, crispy, and tasty!\n\n-- GRILLED BABY OCTOPUS with Butter Beans, Squid Ink, Shaved Mango, Chimichurri...$16\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anchor-and-hope-san-francisco?select=sRMqi_DV9x-DKgEKVtKZyg)\nThe portion felt modest, but only because the dish was so good!  The octopus was tender, charred well, and tasted great with the chimichurri and squid ink.  Plus, I liked the sweet acidity from the mango.  I was mixed on the butter beans though; good earthiness, but bland and starchy.\n\n-- SMITHWICK'S BEER BATTERED LOUISIANA FLOUNDER with Tartar Sauce and House Cut Fries...$26\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anchor-and-hope-san-francisco?select=TY6JTOhZHdSrsnN2aTRDLQ)\nComparatively, the \"worst\" dish I've had here, but fine, really.  Both were crispy, but the batter on the fish was a little thick and light on seasoning.  Still, plus points for using a decent cut of flounder, as opposed to the usual cod.  Also, while I did enjoy the generous portion of fries, part of me wanted their tots instead (fish & tots!).\n\nSomewhat like with my entree, I didn't find the service to be quite as sharp the second time around.  While our first server was very friendly and attentive, our second seemed fairly indifferent in both demeanor and helpfulness.  Plus, our table never received the complimentary chips and dip that we got the first time around, which I note more out of principle than for the sake of the chips themselves.\n\nStill, despite their flaws, Anchor & Hope is an awesome spot in my book.  Perhaps they've lost a bit of their shine over the years (like with Town Hall), but the fact that they're still a solid four shows just how high they set the bar for themselves.  At the least, the silver lining is that it's that much easier to get a table here these days!", "author": "Mike L."}

Each time (except for tonight), I've gone with a reservation before 6pm, gotten oysters and fries on happy hour, then ordered salad and other stuff from the dinner menu to share with friends. \n\nWhen my friend and I arrived and were seated at 5:45, I asked for some oysters. The server asked, \"are you here for happy hour or for dinner?\" I replied \"both!\" She just stared at me. I said, but if you're making me choose...I guess happy hour?\" \n\nShe took our menus and the hostess brought me new ones just for happy hour. The rude hostess said, \"just so you know, we don't take reservations for happy hour.\" Um, what? Who does that? Your restaurant opens at 5(ISH) for dinner and happy hour is over at 6. Why let your website take reservations for that time, then? Plus, no one has ever said that to me the 3 previous times I've eaten here (and have spent at least $50 per person, so I'm not being cheap).\n\nI won't be back.

The oysters, shrimp and clams were fresh with a wonderful sea flavor. The crab remoulade was okay, but I felt we needed a carb to eat with it. Maybe I should have used the complimentary chips? I didn't care for the ceviche as it was too sour for my taste. The scampi and lobster were both good. The clams and prawns were nicely cooked and the white wine sauce very flavorful. The lobster roll buttery and tender. I loved the tots! I didn't care for the clam chowder at all as it had carrots so it had a sweetness I didn't care for. Desserts were pretty good. I liked the panna cotta. The strawberry shortcake was a little dry.\n\nBeer:\n*Headlands 'pt bonita' bohemian pilsner: san francisco, california, 5.3% abv ($7)\n*North coast 'old 38' dublin dry stout: fort bragg, california, 5.4% abv ($8)\n*Allagash 'curieux' barrel aged tripel: portland, maine, 11% abv ($8 for 6oz)\n*Pinkus mueller: 'pinkus' pils, munster, germany, 5% abv ($10 for 500ml)\n\nLots of beer between the two of us!

Much disdain from behind the bar when you split the tabs when closing out. \n\nThen once we got seated in the dining room when the bar was too full and that's when we finally experienced some cheery hospitality. Service was friendly and attentive - a total step up from 10 steps away. Service issues aside, $1 oysters at happy hour are great especially when paired with some happy hour kolsch or bubbly. The shrimp tacos are quite tasty with a nice balance of sweet and spice. Crispy calamari is always a crowd-pleaser. Also angels on horseback - bacon wrapped baked oysters? Yes, please.   \n\nA great spot for dollar oysters at happy hour but probably best with a group size of under four.

The inside was really pretty and to me was quite fancy shmancy. Our server was EXCELLENT and provided us with a lot of options when we kept asking him what he recommended. I'm only giving it 3 stars because other than the great service, the food was just okay and ended up being REALLY PRICEY. Our bill came out to $146! We ordered a small seafood plateaux ($58), calamari ($16), lobster roll ($29) and 2 drinks ( not sure). \n\nThe seafood plateaux was really good. It came with clams, oysters, cocktail shrimp, ceviche, coleslaw, and sauces. The oysters were definitely our favorite and were sooooo good! We preferred that over the clams which were slightly bitter. The ceviche was great also but the amount was what could fit in a shot glass. And you can't really go wrong with shrimp cocktail. \n\nThe waiter said that the calamari was the most popular appetizer so we went with that. The calamari itself was average but the thai dipping sauce is what made it really good. If it wasn't for the sauce I wouldn't get it again.  \n\nThe lobster roll entree was the biggest disappointment for me. The roll itself was delicious. It was quite fluffy and buttery. Sadly the star of the dish, the lobster, wasn't amazing. It lacked flavor and was a bit chewy. The tater tots it came with were extremely bland and had a weird consistency. Even after salting the tots up it didn't help so we didn't finish them. \n\nMy friend had a red win and I had a prosecco.

So we snagged a little corner spot at A&H and chatted about life and limb. \n\nWe both had the Penfolds Riesling ($5) from the happy hour menu and then ordered up some apps. I wanted oysters real bad, so we got a dozen of the Chef's Selection (at $1 each who could say no?). We also ordered the Anchor & Hope Fries with Malt Vinegar Aioli ($6) and the Shishito Peppers with Sea Salt ($6). Thick potato chips come out before your food, which were tasty with a drizzling of lemon juice and dipped into aioli.\n\nEverything was good, but the oysters had a milky, kind of chalkiness under some of them that made me feel a little uneasy. I ate four and left the rest for my friend, or the garbage, whichever, as getting sick from oysters is not my gameplan (I didn't get sick, mind you, but I also drank a Fernet next door at Eddie Ricknebacher's just to be safe).\n\nThe Shishito peppers were good, but could have used some jamon, like the ones from Coquetta on Pier 5. Good, just lacking a dimension of flavor from lack of fat. The fries were crisp and light. He had a Cali Craft and I had another wine as we decided to finish the mini meal with the Angels on Horseback ($3.50 each), which were bacon-wrapped oysters, flash fried and drizzled with a sauce of sorts.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-09-11", "description": "TL;DR - I will not be returning and I do not recommend this restaurant for anyone considering the expensive mediocre food with extremely poor service.\n\nI made a large group reservation with business guests scheduled during happy hour. When we arrived, we had to wait to be seated for some time even though we had a reservation and there were only 2-3 other parties in the restaurant. We patiently waited. We were just happy to drink soon.\n\nEven though we were well within the happy hour timeframe, we were only given regular menus until we inquired. The happy hour menu items are cheaper, but minuscule in portion, so it didn't seem like a happy hour deal at all. It felt more expensive in a way. We ordered lots of appetizers to share (all of which came hot and fresh), but we also ordered two vegetarian-friendly entrees that never came at all.\n\nWhen we realized our dishes were forgotten, we tried to flag a waiter, but no one was available to tend to us for some time (by now there were only about 10 parties in the restaurant). With some urgency, we began to wave our hands in the air like children. Our associates were hungry.\n\nWe found out that the original waiter never put our entree orders in. At this point, we also found out we had a new waiter. We didn't know she was our new waiter, but we came to realize she was because when we inquired about our missing dishes, her response was, \"You didn't place those orders with me.\" ... Of course not. We placed them with our original waiter!\n\nThey switched waiters on us, and the new waiter was entirely and utterly unapologetic about our wait, our missed orders, and our hungry clients. In fact, the sharpness of her attitude (tone of voice, choice of words, and body language) all spoke as if we had accused her of some heinous crime when all we did was politely ask about our missing dishes. (For the record, our original waiter was kind and jolly; this waiter clearly did not want to serve us.)\n\nWhen we received our bill, we reviewed it and noticed that they charged us for an extra count of a dish we ordered. We flagged our waiter down. \n\nWaiter: \"Is there a problem?\"\nMe: \"I think there's a mistake. We only ordered 2 of these.\"\nWaiter: \"No, there's no mistake. You definitely ordered 3.\"\n\nDisgruntled, she was insisting I did what I did not do. At this point, none of us really wanted to deal with her sour attitude any longer--especially over $12--so we just paid for it. For our own sanity, we asked around the table in case they really did serve us the extra dish, but everyone confirmed that there were only 2 orders of that dish.\n\nAs I write this review, I'm starting to have an epiphany: Maybe the restaurant is empty because waiters like her keep customers from returning.\n\nThere are some positives notes, e.g. A&H has a great beer selection and some fresh seafood. Sure, the portions are small and quite expensive, but that's many San Francisco establishments. It's just unfortunate that the service left such a bad taste in my mouth.", "author": "Basile K."}

They were a little fishy that day, but my friend swears by them and said it was just an off day. \n\nTheir best menu item was he Angels on horseback....aka bacon wrapped oysters. Oh em geeee! Sooo delicious. Crispy bacon, yummy oysters, and a really good dipping sauce to compliment them both. 3.50 each for these...definitely worth it. \n\nTheir hh beer was really good too. A brew from walnut creek. Gotta love local support. \n\nOh! And we had popcorn shrimp. They are pretty good. Not anything to rave about, but definitely on he good side. I like the light batter and yummy dipping sauce.\n\nI wish I could give this place 3.5 stars instead of 4. I went with 4 bc of the food. Wanted to give them less because their service blew. Any time anyone in my party asked for something, they said wait. Then they'd come back at least five minutes later to take one order and leave again. It was slow.

We arrived at opening for a happy hour before the dinner rush and they very reluctantly offered us a table (I guess the new rule is that you're not allowed a table during that time, fair enough). There are a lot of ways to handle a table you need to turn over quickly but passive aggressive, downright snarky comments should not be one of them in the service industry. Just tell us straight up that you need the table by 6:30 and we'd be cool with it. Instead we had a prolonged encounter of rudeness and three forgotten orders.

I got really excited when I saw Pliny from Russian River on the list but it was less palatable at the price of $15 for a bottle. Excellent beer, but ridiculous price. We also ordered fries to share - $6. Fries weren't very good, so don't get that.\n\nI recommend coming here only for the dollar oysters during HH, the prices for the rest of the food seem pretty insane, even by SF standards.

They are slightly off the beaten path which means you are likely to find a spot at the bar without issue and maybe even a nice table.\n2.  The food is OUT of this WORLD!  In the few nights that I've been here, I've consumed 6 Duxbury, Mass oysters (they will change your life), the Arugala Salad (thin slices of Granny Smith apples, manchego cheese, candied walnuts, and black pepper vinaigrette), Smithwick's beer battered flounder with fries, and last but certainly not least, the Bucatini pasta which is Gulf shrimp, clams, in a lightly spicy sauce (if you've ever had the shrimp Diablo at bonefish, the sauces are very similar)\n3.  THE BEER!  This beer list is ridiculous! Pliny the elder (for you IPA lovers) and many many more options!  I won't give their list justice if I try so if you like beers, GET OVER HERE!\n4.  This has got to be my absolute favorite reason to recommend a place...THE STAFF!!!!!  Everyone from the front of the house to Aaron (boss), Tom, Adam, Dustin (hardworking bartender/waiter)...to the rest of the amazing people that make up this team.  In the multiple visits here I've personally witnessed them dealing with difficult customers with finesse all the way to the customer that strolled in absolutely trashed at 9:59 (1minute before close) and obnoxiously orders a whole bottle of wine.  On one side note, I had already paid my bill and was getting ready to leave so don't judge me!    I wouldn't subject my worst enemy to 5 minutes with this complete A-hole, but to watch this team articulately and PROFESSIONALLY work with him was truly mind blowing!  In those moments that I would have already flipped, they represented composure and poise!  My hat is truly off to this team!\n\nBottom line:  I always look forward to visiting SF!  I have the best time, meet awesome people and see great friends.  The networking here is priceless for me.  Anchor and Hope just gave me another reason to look forward to coming to this awesome city.  If you value Quality, service, and BEER you should look forward to your next trip out here or if you're a local, look forward to your next reason to eat out and treat yourself.

I love fish and chips, but there's only so much of it you can eat before getting a little queasy. The fish was well battered, fully cook, and everything stuck together in one solid piece - not the crap where batter and fish separate.

Kind of a lot of money for a small appetizer\n-Bacon wrapped Branzino with potatoes and brussels sprouts. This was an entire fish with some stuff inside, wrapped in bacon. They told us the fish had been deboned but I found like 12 bones in my first mouthful (subsequent mouthfulls had few to none, but...). Flavor was ok. Bacon was the best part. Potatoes were undercooked, but the brussels sprouts were good.\n-Fried flounder and fries. Tasted good. Nice and crispy. Overpriced though, but so was everything here\n-Kale salad: overpriced but awesome\n-Lemon cheesecake: overpriced and small but seriously tasty\n-Chocolate blackout cake: overpriced but awesome\n\nSo the food was ok but really not worth how expensive it was. For the price I expect the food to rock. Meanwhile, the servers were super friendly but the food took forever to arrive, and the servers were kind of aggressive about removing plates, even when we were, like, still forking food off them. Finally, one of my family members clandestinely paid half the bill, and the guy who brought the other half of the bill to the table was kind of shifty about it, which made it seem like they had taken items off the bill or given us a deal, rather than that no, a member of our party had just paid for half. So it was kind of like taking credit for something they didn't do.\n\nSo it wasn't horrible, and if three stars wasn't \"A-OK\" I might have given it 3, but I will definitely never go there again, and I wish I had checked the reviews before going there a first time. \nThe space is cool and not loud, which was a plus.

I wanted to mainly come for their happy hour m-f 4:30-6 because they have 1$ oysters.  I arrives right before 5 and had a seat at the bar with my husband.  We had another friend joining us and put our name down for a table later on.  We started with a dozen of the chef selection oysters.  I was worried \"chef selection\" was code for some crappy leftover oysters but they were actually rocky point oysters and they were AMAZING!  I am an oyster fanatic and these were some of the freshest tastiest west coast oysters I have had.  PLus for the cost it was amazing.  We also had the angels on horseback which was a cooked oyster wrapped in bacon and it was really good- totally expensive though at 3.50 an oyster, I think I liked the raw better.  They had 4 happy hour drinks for 5$- champagne, pinot grigio, red wine, and a beer selection.  I had the champagne and pinot grigio and they were both really great.  Once we sat down we ordered some more dishes such as the fries, popcorn shrimp, ceviche, and tuna salmon tartar.  Some of these were on the happy hour menu some were not.  The fries were my least favorite they were just okay.  The popcorn shrimp were surprisingly delicious and light.  The ceviche was also really tasty and flavored great.  My favorite dish of the night was the salmon and tuna tartar it had passion fruit and avocado mousse and I think I will probably dream about this dish for a long time.  Its served with plantain chips as well.  \nThe prices were a little on the high side for items not on happy hour but I thought it was well worth the money.

Great selections of those.\n\nThe salmon tartare was a fantastic starter - rich, buttery fresh salmon cubes with the creaminess of avocados, balanced perfectly by a tangy acidic jalapeno vinaigrette and the brightness of watermelon.\n\nThe lobster roll lived up to all expectations - the warm, toasted and fluffy brioche bun was buttery and a perfect compliment to the generous amount of fresh lobster.\n\nA&H would have gotten an easy 5 stars if they didn't miss the mark on my steak - my medium rare steak arrived well done (and they brought my date salmon instead of the ordered lobster roll) - though both mix-ups were remedied very graciously and efficiently.\n\nThe whoopie pie ice cream sandwich was a fitting end - rich chocolate and salted caramel ice cream. YUM.\n\nLike most spots in SOMA/FiDi, a meal with drinks won't come cheap - but A&H is a worthwhile effort amidst much competition.", "author": "Jocelin L."}

I immediately loved the actual restaurant- from the decoration, to the set up, the bar look, the servers appearances. Fantastic start.\n\nTheir beer menu is killer- if not a little overwhelming with so many choices. I had the afflegim and it was wonderful. \n\nWe had the calamari and the shrimp cocktail for appetizers- the calamari was seasoned and cooked to perfection and the shrimp was super fresh. The only downside was that the cocktail sauce was very spicy- but still awesome.\n\nMy friend got the New York strip steak and I got the fish and chips.

The service was not just poor, but exceptionally awful.  It took nearly 40 minutes for the waiter to even take our order.  Our reservations were at 7:45 and everyone in our party was there and seated by 7:45, yet it still took 40 minutes for someone to take our order.  The appetizers were fine, but we didn't get served our entrees until 9:30pm.  It was ridiculous.  They had taken away our appetizers and plates but we were still sitting there waiting for our entrees.  \n\nNO ONE came by to ask if we wanted more drinks.  We had to flag someone (not even our own waiter) for more drinks.  And no one ever asked if the people who were not drinking alcohol wanted refills.  The service was just awful considering a.) most of the tables cleared out by 9:00pm, and b.) there were at least 10-15 staff running around (a mix of servers and busboys and waiters.  It was hard to tell).  But the place is NOT big, so it seemed over-staffed.  \n\nThe fact that they messed up an order and took an additional 15 minutes to bring out the correct entree didn't even factor into my low-star rating because sometimes that just happens so I gave them a pass for that. \n\nBut what put it down to TWO stars after the horrible service was that the meal itself was not great.  It was fine...just fine.  AND SUPER EXPENSIVE.  I mean a $500 bill for 7 people where only 4 of those people had a glass of wine is RIDICULOUS unless the meal is fantastic.  And it just wasn't.

Some dishes were off-the-charts good (best mignonette for oysters ever) and some dishes were just \"eh\".  The oysters are really fresh, very good, and many to choose from.

Some of the other dishes we ordered were either very small for the cost, or the flavor profile left me scratching my head.  A friend at the table ordered the pork belly and grilled octopus, and I really just didn't get it.  However, the Mt. Lassen smoked trout and potatoes had me banging my fist on the table in delight--awesome.  \n\nOne thing I did notice was that the place was too dark to read the menu.

It's off Minna between 1st and 2nd, which feels more like an alley than a street.  I'd almost stopped in a few times but it's often pretty crowded; finally one Saturday evening it was clear so I went in and sat at the bar.\n\nThe vibe is kind of industrial-chic, laid back but with minor elements of a fancy place.  The crowd was a mix of casual and date night, semi-fancy dress.   Not pretentious but it looks nice and clean inside, and since it's a seafood place it has a nautical feel to it.\n\nI first had one each of the 5 west coast oysters they offer.  They were good, not the best ever, but they tasted fresh and the cooks shuck them right behind the bar.  $3.50 each which felt a little above average in price but I haven't been in SF long enough to judge that.  Everything is pricey here so maybe that is normal.  They also carry east coast oysters but I didn't try them.\n\nNext I got the lobster roll with tater tots.   It's hard to screw up a lobster roll, and they certainly did not.  It was tasty, and they have the real rolls like you get in New England, warm and buttered.  I've had stellar lobster rolls in the northeast and this was pretty darn close.  The cole slaw that came with it was nothing special but who likes cole slaw?  The tots were probably homemade, they didn't look like the traditional tots we're all used to, and they were just ok.  Honestly I probably miss the low quality ingredients in the school-lunch tots so that's not a great reason to ding them.\n\nThey have a good wine list and offer a handful of cocktails, and appeared to have quite a few draft beers.  I didn't booze it that night but it looked like a good list.\n\nAll in all I gave 4 stars because it was good but I wasn't blown away and I thought it was a bit pricey.  There weren't any low-priced entrees, everything was in the mid 20s to mid 30s range.  Dinner for 1 with oysters, an entree, and a dessert ran me about 70 all in.

As a someone with a lot of industry experience I should have known to specify the temperature when the server did not prompt me for one but I always assume when the server does not ask that it will come out medium. It was barely seared and we didn't eat most of it as a result. It's not fair to leave a poor rating for something so minor, especially when we could have asked to have it cooked a bit more.

The crab was just OK as it didn't taste very fresh.  I steam live crab all the time and when I make too much, I would take out all the meat so that I can scoop them into salads for the next few days.  I know what crab taste like on day 1, 2, and 3 and after a while, crab will start having strong seafood smell.  I'm not sure how many days old this crab was but it definitely was not day 1 or 2 so let's just leave it at that.  The angels on horseback were quite tasty since the wrapped bacon was still crispy.  My friend ordered their famous lobster roll.  I tried a little bit and thought it was quite bland.  \n\nLunch for two cost us about $40 pp with tax & tip.

I was originally craving PPQ for some crab, but needed something closer to the financial district.  However, after eating here, I couldn't even remember what PPQ was about...\n\nWe had the small seafood plateaux appetizer.  It was pricey, but well worth it.  The oysters were delicious, the littleneck clams were gone before I knew it, and the ceviche and crab...my mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\nI also had the baby octopus appetizer and I think this just made my week.  This was the one thing I kept thinking about all night long.  It was sooooo good!  I wouldn't have thought Thai basil, yuzu, and beets would make a good combination, but this just blew my mind.\n\nFor the entree, I had the sole.  At this point I was already a raving fan and was worried I would be disappointed, but nope, the goodness just kept coming.  The dashi broth was just full of umami and the sole had some nice crispy skin and was soft and delicate in the inside.\n\nTo top it all off, I had the Sugar Pie Pumpkin Bread Pudding.  I hope they never take this off the menu!  It wasn't like your normal bread pudding, actually it felt more like a flourless cake, but it was scrumptous.", "author": "Ray B."}

Great laid back ambience. I ordered new england clam chowder and one from each of the three type of West Coast oysters. Skookum oyster from WA was the best -- close to the hog island oyster which is my favorite -- sweet and not too salty. I am a bit of a purist when it comes to oyster, only using lemon with no other sauce. For some of the salty ones, if you don't put vinaigrette insider, you feel like you are drinking sea water along with the oyster!\n\nNew England Clam Chowder was excellent, not too creamy and not too runny. Very fresh clams.

I saw him walk into the kitchen to examine the tacos. Not sure if he even told the chef or  the kitchen staff. I called the manager over to tell him that I sent the food back and his response was \"No worries\" like I made a mistake? Then he continued to say that \"Bugs are extra protein in some countries\". I'm not sure if that's the right way to respond after a customer has found a bug in their food. All I got was a light apology & the tacos removed off my bill after being asked multiple times if I wanted to order something else.\n\nI'm not ever coming back. It's even scary to think we're eating raw oysters at a place that is not as clean as we would expect it to be.

This restaurant yields a cordial, classy atmosphere, without all the uptight formality. \n\nUnfortunately, with my family history, I already have high LDL (the bad kind) cholesterol. However, I had no qualms of neglecting my health and conscience for the sinful seafood at this restaurant. It was simply delicious, and every guilty mg of cholesterol consumed was entirely worth it for their succulent oyster and uni.\n\nFrom their seafood bar, we ordered all 6 types of oysters offered. 3 different oysters from the East coast, and 3 different oysters from the West coast. The thumb-sized oysters came out on an elevated ice platter, arranged as listed on the menu. \n\nTheir East coast oysters are definitely more brine-y than their West coast counterparts. I, personally, like the West coast oysters, because their meats offer a fresh aroma, that makes it easily compatible with both their cocktail sauce and their vinegar-herb sauce. However, as an oyster lover, every single one tasted amazing. Even without their beautiful presentation and tasty sauces, their oysters are STILL 5/5!!\n\nNow, the Uni... (I'm already drooling from the thought of it) It's an uni chowder with bits of potatoes, and unlike clam chowder where the clams are chewy (and can even get plastic-y if not fresh), the uni was like tender flesh that melted in your mouth. I practically licked the bowl clean (well, not literally, but used the bread they served to wiped it clean!) Umm...DEFINITE 5/5. \n\nWe ordered monkfish as the main entree. Unfortunately, after the uni appetizer, this dish tasted, well, sub-par. Although the fish was cooked tenderly, the vegetables surrounding the fish tasted a bit bitter! I do NOT recommend ordering this platter, especially after having uni, because you'll be severely disheartened. 2/5. \n\nTheir servers were very attentive, always vigilant to my needs almost to a point where it was intrusive on our conversations. But that may also be because we went on a Wednesday night, when business wasn't as busy, so they may have over-did it on the service. 4/5\n\nAs my friend mentioned, the open-kitchen allows one to see not only the culinary finesse of their cooks, but also their sanitary standards.

The walnut/raisin mixture in the center of the squash soup added a nice texture change to the very delicate broth, though the oil slick that accompanied it was a little odd.  It wasn't over-whelming, but it was an addition I didn't need.  I could smell the curry, but it didn't contribute to the flavor significantly.  No problem there, delicate is the order with a soup like this.\n\nThe rockfish ceviche, which I loved if nothing else for the light-handed use of citrus, was a highlight.  Our very helpful server said each ceviche dish is made to order, so the fish is not swimming in citrus all day long.  This was great because some of the pieces were less cooked than others, bringing some rare pieces and some medium-to-well pieces.  I liked this mix of textures and doneness.\n\nBeing close to full we should have stopped, but I insisted on one more crudo and opted for the salmon tartare.  Maybe because I was full or maybe it was the dish, but I was not happy here.  There was yet another oil slick, this one resulting in at least a tablespoon of it in the bottom of the dish when I was done.  The cut of fish wasn't great for me either.  I would have liked the fish a bit more manageable, perhaps shredded or more chopped.  The mint and basil added a great compliment, but not enough to make me want it again.\n\nOne humorous note for us: we had at least 5 servers through the night.  On the one hand it made sure we were well attended to in this busy place, but on the other it lead to some confusion about who was getting us what.  In the end the hostess/server who seemed to be a manager (excellent arm piece) was my favorite.  There is simply nothing wrong with a server who understands good beer and how to pair it with food.  \n\nShe Said:\n\nWe arrived just as they opened on a Wednesday night, and the bar was already full. We got a table with no problem despite not having reservations.\n\nFirst, the beverage selection was good. I opted for beer because their selections on tap were great, but the wine list was pretty amazing too.\n\nWhile we waited for our ceviche, a waiter delivered some chips and dip, and they were both very good. The ceviche was excellent. Not too citrus-y, and served alongside a plum and basil mixture that complimented it nicely.\n\nNext we shared a bowl of clam chowder, and it was really quite good. There wasn't a heavy flour taste as there often is in chowder, and the chef didn't rely on the heavy cream to carry the day either. I would have liked more clam in it, but it wasn't so lacking that I'll complain. It was also good enough that I might come back just for the chowder.\n\nWe also shared a bowl of the butternut squash soup, and it was delicious. Smooth and creamy with a bit of a curry taste. Although He Said felt that it was too oily, I didn't find that to be a problem at all.\n\nAfter the chips, ceviche, two soups, and two beers, I couldn't even imagine eating anything else; however, He Said is a trooper, so he ordered... something.\n\nOverall, this is a great place. The decor is fun, it's only steps from the hotel where we regularly stay, the food is tasty, and the libation situation is good. It can get pricey, and the rotating server situation was weird, but overall, I'm a fan.\n\nShe Said's Potty Points: The bathroom situation was fine. They were clean, and there weren't any lines.

So, here goes my review of this place. \n\nGet the corner bench table to the right, it's the best date spot for 2. Mention that when you make your reservation.  The BEST HOUR to go on a weekend is 5:30 pm, when they just open & there's not a lot of people (yes, they fill out right away).  They run out of sea urchin usually by 8 pm.\n\n5 stars for the sea urchin! (I always like eating my sea urchin on it's shell. I like it better when I get to crack it myself & scoop the meat out). (1) Great presentation. (2) fresh sea urchin meat, it's so soft, melts in your mouth! As if I can still taste it while I'm writing this review. Only 5 pcs of meat though, not enough for me. (3) nice mix with the crab chowder. \n\n4 stars for the oysters in bacon. (1) great presentation (again), they put each on top of a half oyster shell. Now I got a great party idea for homemade hors d'oeuvres. (2) salty oysters + salty bacon = interesting mix, I guess that's what the lemon was for. \n\n2 stars for the fresh oysters, we ordered 4 pcs only. I find it flavorless (even the juice), a little chewy when it's supposed to be soft. But maybe because I know my oysters well, and I know where to get the best ones. If you want the best fresh oysters, plan a 2 hour trip to the Hog Oyster Farm in Marshall, CA. I always go there during the Easter to get my yearly oyster-fix. \n\n4 stars for the ambiance. \n\nTIP: before you go there, grab some food 1-2 hours prior at the Crab Station #2 to get some crab & clam chowder overload for only $12/person. By the time you get to Anchor & Hope, you wont be at your hunger state you'll only want some \"appetizer\" sea urchin & oysters in bacon. Coz just the 3 items I mentioned above (without any drinks) cost $75! \n\nBut it's SWELL trying out their sea urchin. I'm coming back for more.", "author": "J\u00ebn N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-18", "description": "My first experience at one of SF's more expensive restaurants was mediocre (Town Hall).  I was a bit iffy about Anchor and Hope, but both L and I had this bookmarked for awhile after reading excellent reviews from fellow Yelpers.  OpenTable saved our spot (it was packed, fyi) and we were seated around 6:50 (btw, for some reason, parking in the area is usually pretty easy breezy but tonight it was HOrrendous).\n\nAfter deciding that we both needed to be \"good\" since we'd eaten an uncharacteristically large amount of food during the day, we both decided on the gravlox salad each, and we split an order of the Angels on Horseback and the brussel sprouts with bacon, plus a glass of red wine for her, and a pear cider for myself.\n\nLet me tell you something, in case you didn't already know this: bacon makes everything better.\n\nSuch was the case when we got the Angels on Horseback, which are smoked oysters wrapped in bacon, served with a tart creamy Thousand Island-like sauce and a squeeze of lemon.  The whole thing was smokey, chewy, savory, and just overall amazing.  The bacon overpowers the oyster, so if you don't like oysters but like bacon, you'd probably still enjoy this.  Bacon also made the brussel sprouts taste absolutely uh-may-zing; how can something so healthy and normally pretty untasty be turned into something so salty, flavorful and overall heavenly?  Oh right, bacon and bacon grease.\n\nOur salads were the perfect size for someone who's trying to be good.  The bottom was diced beets in a mayo-based sauce (I think), and on top of that were some fresh greens, and smoked salmon was the top layer.  There were also crispy pieces of lavash bread sprinkled all around.  So many different flavors and textures made for a very unique salad.\n\nFinally, we decided that we had to get dessert.  We were thinking of splitting one, but then I figured that with it being an uppity expensive restaurant, the dessert would probably be smaller than the palm of my hand.  Plus, L wanted the Blue Bottle Coffee Milkshake, and I wanted the Chocolate Almond Cake, which came with malted ice cream and hot fudge.  The desserts took significantly longer than our food, for some reason.  Maybe they were hand-churning the ice cream?\n\nBut oh, it was so worth the wait.  Best coffee milkshake ever.  And best chocolate cake ever, with the ice cream melting into the hot fudge.  And I was right - it was small.  Like I could probably eat 4 servings.  All by myself.  Note to current and future potential boyfriend(s)/significant life partner(s):  If you ever ask to share my dessert, I will cut you.\n\nWhat a great dining experience - the restaurant was beautifully themed and decorated, and the food was excellent.

This time, we ventured out to this restaurant 2 blocks away from our hotel and had such a fabulous time here last night. \nWe shared a small seafood plateaux with 6 different types of oysters, each with it's own distinct flavor. The prawns were fresh and meaty and the cocktail sauce not too tangy or overly sweet. The rockfish ceviche sang with Thai chili and coconut milk flavors and the delicious crab r\u00e9moulade demanded we eat it by the forkful. Knowing we would be full from the plateaux, we'd ordered on the light side and decided on the grilled octopus with pork belly. While I was expecting the \"octobelly\" I was quite unprepared for the fresh cubes of sweet watermelon, pickled canteloupe rind, dollops of balsamic vinegar reduction, grilled beets and crispy pieces of chiccharon! The combination of flavors and textures was perfection on both the plate and palate. We also had the grilled summer squash which was topped with a tasty hazelnut-heavy gremolata. \nWe were so full halfway through the squash that we didn't want to look at the dessert menu, but at our server Josh's insistence, we did...and found ourselves lusting after the Nutella bread pudding, but unfortunately lacking the stomach space. His solution? Pack it up, bring it back to the Palace Hotel and have them heat it up for you when your stomachs are good and ready. Um, hello, best suggestion ever!\n\nWhat really stood out was the wonderful attention given to us by Josh and the rest of his team. Everyone we encountered had a smile to share with us and made us feel very welcome and right at home. At the beginning of the meal, I wondered aloud to Josh if he might have any sour beer suggestions to share with me. Seeing his eyes light up when he told me they actually have a Secret Sour Beer menu made me positively giddy! When our 2 glasses of Bruery's Sour in the Rye were brought to our table by Tom the bartender, he told us they were the very last 2 glasses they had and not a drop was left. Manager Danny also stopped by our table and we had a great conversation regarding Bruery and we're excited to try more of their selections. This team's attention to detail and infectious enthusiasm for the food and beverages they stand 100% behind is refreshing to experience in this sometimes jaded industry.\n\nI can't wait to come back here with my friends, my family and maybe even just myself.

The bf commented that the food was too mild & that the lobster did not taste distinctly \"lobster.\" \n\nTotal for 1 appetizer, 2 sandwiches & a Port of Call drink: $68\n\nOur waitress, although not enthusiastic, was quick, which was helpful because we were parked at a meter. If you don't make reservations for lunch, the hostess will try to seat you at the bar even if there are plenty of open, available tables.\n\nA&H is a trendy, fun spot where the flavors are mellow enough to convert seafood skeptics but good enough to satisfy a seafood fan such as myself.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

Came here with the BF after watching the Peter Pan show.  It was kind of scary walking to this place because Minna is pretty deserted and dark.\n\nAngels on Horseback (bacon wrapped oysters) - First time having oyster like this and it was pretty interesting.  Cooked oyster has this distinct taste that I'm not too fond of, but with the bacon, it mellowed it out a little bit and made it more pleasant.  The BF however did not think it was good, said he could not taste the bacon and the whole thing was kind of flavorless.\n\nFried Green Tomatoes - Not sure why, but they gave us this dish complimentary from the chef. First time also having fried green tomatoes.  I like how it had a nice crunch to it, but the tomatoes were too tangy for me.\n\nCalamari - The BF has to order this at every restaurant we go to if on the menu.  It's nothing special, not too soggy, and came with a pretty good thai chilli dipping sauce.\n\nAhi Tuna - While the BF has to order calamari at every restaurant, I have to order Ahi Tuna.  It was fresh and had a very good sauce and other things mixed in.  My only complaint is that for $15, I expected a little more.\n\nSoft Shell Crab - I did not like this at all.  I know it's suppose to be \"soft shell\" but this crab was soft and soggy and tasted as though it was fried in the morning and served to us at 10 at night.  The avocado type mousse tasted kind of sour too.\n\nThe restaurant was a cute and intimate restaurant.  Our waitress however seemed kind of unpleasant and the food was definitely not worth the price.  It was fun trying out the Angels on Horseback just to knock another item off the Big Eats List, but I would not come back here again.", "author": "Katherine C."}

My office is across the street so after all this time I felt like it was time to give it a second chance.  This experience was even worse.  \n\nWe were seated in the corner which was fine with me except that we were completely ignored our entire meal.  Our lunch to such a long time because they never came by to clear our apps, bring us bread, which I had to ask for 3 times before we got any, and we waited almost 15 minutes after we finished eating for the check before I asked the hostess to bring it to us since our waitress waited so long to check on us.\n\nAs for the food, the prices are fine but the portions are tiny and the food is just not that flavorful.  I got the crab Louie.  It was simple lettuce and a tiny portion of crab with a really heavy not so tasty overly pickley tartar sauce.  No tomatoes, nothing extra to go with the lettuce and crab.  Just not very tasty. The burger was overcooked and didn't fit the size of the bun (was really small).\n\nLots of good places downtown for a casual or business lunch.

When ordering drinks, small misstep in that the original bar guy didn't ask 10-year-old daughter what she wanted to drink. However, when our drinks came and were served by the woman who took over, she was on it. My favorite question ever by a server? \"Tell me what you're allowed to have.\" Oh. my. god. All these years in the bay area and not one server has been smart enough to take that angle. Savvy servers often will be kind to kids (and duh - if you haven't figured this out yet servers...listen up) but they do it to the exclusion of the parent. \"Want something syrupy and sweet?\"  \"Would you like dessert?\" Right at the kid. Bad move server. You may think the tug factor works in a restaurant - but you'd be wrong. Now you've just pissed me off. \n\nBut back to THIS server who did NONE of those bad things. She engaged her (and us), served her crab appetizer without the spicy stuff that normally comes with it, stopped and had a full-on adult conversation with her without excluding us....on and on. The food continues to be spot-on - daughter thought the crab was the best meal ever....the squash soup that we split was delicious, the trout was yummy (although I do think I'd revert to the lobster roll next time - just can't get enough of a good lobster roll....ever).

I take offense when a restaurant charges thirty bucks for an entree but gives the server so many tables that she can't spare a moment to ask if that entree came out all right. Our waitress gave us no warm attention at all, just came by to ask, \"More wine?\" or \"Room for dessert?\" basically asking, \"Wanna spend?\" instead of, \"How can I make this dining experience good for you?\"\n\nTwo people I believe were managers just creeped me out to see them.

We'd heard it'd been featured on the food network for the bacon-wrapped oysters - which is a good enough start to get me in the door.\n\nWe started with that very dish, in addition to some west coasters served in the original style with shallots and cocktail sauce, as well as some legit black pepper calamari.  I definitely preferred the original chilled oysters to the bacon-wrapped variety, but that might be a personal preference as the rest of the table was pretty enamored with them. Calamari was a hit as well - instead of being served with a mayo-based sauce or tartar, they came with a spicy asian dressing.  \n\nFor entrees, I was immediately attracted to the cioppino because it featured so many different types of fish - crab, mussels, clams, and bass in a fiery red sauce.   It was substantial and tasty.  \n\nAs an FYI, they don't serve liquor.  Only beer and wine - but they have a pretty extensive list of both. It's hidden on a side street, so it's slightly hard to find.

The restaurant is airy, big, and generally pretty sexy.  The food was expensive-ish ($25 entrees) and not bad (particularly the free potato chips at the beginning of the meal), but our night was ruined by the restaurant's terrible hygeine and even worse management.  To summarize:\n\n(1) My husband found two short black hairs in our raw seafood appetizer.  He brought it up with our server, who then walked away (presumably to consult with his manager).  The server came back and apologized, saying that the restaurant would comp. the appetizer--which was an appropriate response for a well-managed restaurant, we thought at the time.  But, 30 minutes later, AFTER our appetizers had been taken away and our entrees served, our server came back bearing a small plate with 6 shrimp on it.  He leaned in and said that the restaurant was giving us this tiny plate of shrimp INSTEAD of comping the hair-laden appetizer.  We said that we didn't want the shrimp, since it was the shellfish that had the hygeine issue in the first place, and we were already eating our entrees...He then took it away without a word.\n\n(2) The server also brought us the wrong bottle of wine, which neither he nor we noticed until after he had poured the glasses.  The server later came back and said that he accidentally poured a more expensive bottle, but that since we were ordering another bottle of wine, he would just charge us $100 for both bottles.    We thought this was a weird response, but accepted it.\n\nWhen the bill came, not only were we charged $120 for the wine, but we were charged $55 for the appetizer!  When my husband brought this up with the manager, the manager basically said (1) that the server didn't have the authority to comp. our appetizer, so he didn't want to take it off the bill, and (2) more alarmingly, it was the guests' responsibility to make sure that the right wine was poured!  This is an incredibly shady practice because, under that reasoning, if I order a $70 Malbec, and the server pours a $2000 wine instead, I owe the restaurant $2000 for the restaurant's bait-and-switch.\n\nIn the end, the manager relented and took $75 off of our $500+ bill, but the unprofessional way he handled the whole exchange left a bad taste in our mouths.   We will never be going back.", "author": "Thomas W."}

They are not afraid to serve you a healthy dose of raw clams and their prawns were about as good as prawns get. The quality of the lobster let me know they were serious. And some less common components - like pickled mussels and a ceviche that tasted nothing like ceviche - made it more interesting than the usual fresh seafood indulgence. We ordered one side, brussel sprouts, and they were the best I've ever had. \n\nThe beer menu was acceptable, but don't be fooled by their cocktail menu as this establishment does not have a hard liquor license.

A & H serves oysters & seafood...sold! \n\nWe started with a dozen oysters, 6 west cost & 6 east coast. I can never remember which oysters I prefer after I eat them, but I do know that they were all fresh & delicious. Maybe next time I will actually write down the names so I can order them again! \n\nI was very impressed with their beer list. It was as extensive as some wine lists. I tried the local Linden Street Black Lager, which was a slightly lighter version of a stout. This was probably a bad idea seeing that I had a lot of food coming & stouts are very filling, but it tasted great. Hubby tried a Japanese hefeweizen. Yeah, who knew, right? It was light & refreshing. I liked how they brought the matching glass for each beer. Classy touch. \n\nAs an appetizer I ordered the very creamy, chunky clam chowder. Hubby ordered the calamari. I usually skip over fried calamari as an app cuz it is usually rubbery, greasy, & tasteless. These were lightly fried & came with the most amazing dipping sauce. Hubby was all over it. In fact he almost canceled his main dish just to get another order of calamari. The dipping sauce was a strange combination of fish sauce, lime juice, & thai chilies. But somehow it worked & was a great compliment to the calamari. \n\nMy main dish was the sea bass which was perfectly cooked (of course) & delicious. Hubby got a pile of mussels which was almost more than he could eat. They definitely don't skimp on portions here. \n\nMy only complaint is that some of the tables are realllly close together. When you have guys with booming voices on either side of you, it's kind of hard to concentrate on your own conversation. Whether we liked it or not, we got roped in to conversations with 2 different neighbors.

The single piece of flounder was huge and the batter crust was crisp and flavorful enough as not to overcome the taste of the fish. Actually, maybe the best F&C I've ever had. The chips - amazing taste, tartar and cocktail sauce need work, nothing special.

Besides, there's nothing manlier than surviving purely off of water, whey isolate, and some questionable-looking brown powder that apparently required the harvesting (and subsequent destruction) of a 5' x 8' patch of protected Amazon rainforest.\n\nOver the years though, I've learned that not everyone's as much of a hero as me, so when we decided to throw a welcome lunch at A&H for a new co-worker, I acquiesced and decided to have a solid meal. The fact that I was recovering from the previous night where I found myself drinking a spirit that tasted like it was fermented from a potato found in an old Commie boot of Dostoevsky's also likely contributed to this brief moment of weakness.\n\nGiven the above circumstances, you'd figure that I would have enjoyed my meal at A&H a lot more than I did (since somewhere deep down inside I do have a soul and can appreciate things like calories that don't start off in powdered form). Besides, a lobster roll is pretty manly and that's apparently this place's signature dish.\n\nLooks like someone needs a new John Hancock. (Hahhhh good one, Leo.)\n\nOverrated with a capital OVERRATED sums things up nicely. Basically they served me a San Francisco-neutered version of what's supposed to be a hearty East Coast comfort food. I want a real lobster roll, people. Layer on that mayo and throw in lobster chunks so large that I question whether or not that's actually lobster in there. Bonus points for throwing everything in a supermarket bun.\n\nThis description couldn't be further from what I got at Anchor & Hope. I don't remember much since I probably blacked out in a fit of rage upon seeing my lunch; what I do know is that from hazy recollections I still realized that pretentious French pastry (seriously, f those guys) and tiny little lobster chunks in a light cream sauce does not a lobster roll make.\n\nWill not be coming back here unless someone else is paying or until they start grinding up their whole menu and serving it to me in a Big Gulp.", "author": "Leo K."}

The lobster roll was overflowing, the fries were to die for, and the old bay chips were tasty.  I did have a problem with a $150 lunch for two, which included 2 glasses of wine each, but was okay for the special occasion.\n\nThe second time I went back - all hell broke loose.  The lobster roll - which is $25 by the way - was so skimpy.  The waiter apologized and said that they had their 2 year anniversary the night before and they had run out of lobster, so he took it off the bill.   But I was a bit skeptical.\n\nLast night, bad got worse.  I went back and was served an even tinier lobster roll.  It was the smallest lobster roll I had ever seen.  The roll was ginormous compared to the little scoop of lobster meat inside it.   I told the waitress what had happened last time and she admitted it looked dinky.  So she brought it back to the kitchen.  The same roll returned 2 minutes later with just a few chips added to top.  I was told that the chef had given me 3 ounces of lobster meat the first time and that was all I was getting.  20 minutes later, with each staff member just looking at me sitting there pissed off and not touching my food, I finally got the attention of the waitress again and sent it back to the kitchen for the last time.  \n\nThe manager finally came over and tried to offer me a normal-sized lobster roll, but the chef had been watching me not eating for the past 20 minutes and I felt like I was on a Seinfeld episode.  \n\nSo I got up after a wasted hour and left, starving, and went to Salt House.  I told them about my experience and they treated me like royalty.\n\nI think Anchor and Hope has become too busy, too big for its own good.  The food is overpriced and they don't have enough servers to help.  It has underwhelmed me on two occasions, and at the prices they charge, its not worth it - especially in a city with so many beautiful places to dine.", "author": "Scott H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-12", "description": "Came here for lunch on a Wednesday with 12:30pm reservations for 3.  We arrived and told that we had to wait another 10 minutes, but when we expressed our disappointment, they immediately sat us at an open table, which happened to be the very first table upon walking in.  On occasion that table got chilly if the front door was left open, but each time an employee would close it to make sure I didn't get too cold.  The interior is extremely airy, filled with light (huge windows and skylights), and decorated with a nautical feel.  The space is larger than it looks from the outside, and it's not too cramped while sitting inside.  Tables can be moved around to accommodate people dining alone to larger groups of 6.  \n\nWater is left on your table in dark tinted bottles that look like they were found at the bottom of the ocean after many years.  I liked it.  Also, the bread is served in brown paper bags....the bread is in full length rolls that you need to break apart.  The bread is good and I found myself munching on it throughout the entire meal.  \n\nAppetizers: 1) Wild Arugula Salad with picked fennel, roasted olives, grana padano (cheese), and lemon vinaigrette. 2) Seared scallops with mustard greens, kohlrabi, and apple miso broth.  Both were really well seasoned \n\nEntrees: 1) Almond Crusted Shetland Salmon with Israeli Cous Couse, Asparagus preserved lemon, endive, and Citrus Butter.  The salmon was not very flavorful but it was well cooked.  I found myself needing to dip it into the Citrus Butter and mix each bite with the cous cous to give the fish flavor.  This dish was 3 stars.  \n\n2) Brie Burger.  I didn't try this but I was told it's good.  Comes with sauteed sweet onions, smoked bacon, and mushrooms.  Also has rosemary & thyme fries on the side.  However, I have been told that the burger at Spruce is WAY better (review to come).   \n\n 3) Lobster Roll on a Brioche Bun with kettle chips.  The lobster roll looks small when you get it because the lobster stuffing appears to be sitting on top of the toasted bun (which looks like 2 huge pieces of toast).  However, the lobster stuffing is literally stuffed inside of the bun  like a hot pocket and just spills over the top.  The stuffing is very light, well seasoned, and not too heavy of a lobster flavor (yet you can taste the lobster).  \n\nDessert: Dark chocolate mousse with salted caramel popcorn.  2) Strawberry sorbet with shortbread.  Both were really delicious!  The strawberry sorbet was super fresh and tasted like I was eating a frozen sweet strawberry that had just been mashed up.  \n\nService was attentive and professional for it being so busy during the lunch hour.  There were many people to seat and serve, and yet our glasses were constantly filled to the brim with our beverages and the food was served promptly.", "author": "Naomi P."}

The appetizers list, comprising perhaps 10 different options, had 2 which weren't seafood.  And only 2 of the entrees weren't seafood as well (yes, one of them is steak).\n\nThey focus on sustainability, which is fantastic - for example, they knew not just where my wild king salmon came from (Oregon), but also that it was line-caught.\n\nThe warm sea urchin and dungeness crab appetizer was spectacularly ridiculous - it was almost more like a chowder with a rich, buttery sauce and huge chunks of crab meat (including a whole claw) and giant pads of uni.  Really fantastic.\nThe Thai-sauce ceviche was interesting, and the shellfish was clearly all very fresh, but the sauce really was overpowering at first - it did dissipate as you chewed, giving way to the flavor of the seafood, but even so it seemed too strong.  I'd recommend they put less of it on the plate.\n\nThe King Salmon was fabulous - perfectly medium-rare, and the crisp, fresh, buttery veggies beneath it were wonderful.\n\nThe Lobster Roll is served inside a large piece of toasted bread, which is really nifty, but the lobster itself is more like a tuna salad, except with lobster instead of tuna.  There was a lot of celery, and its flavor threatened to overwhelm that of the lobster.\n\nThe rhubarb, aniseed meringue and almond ice cream dessert was excellent, and the 3 flavors enhanced each other in ways I'd never have guessed; this was great!\n\nI also really recommend the Vermont Ice Cider, which was truly unique - imagine an ice wine made with apples instead of grapes.

We ordered oysters, fries and drinks.  For a $1, the oysters were fresh and quite large.  It was much larger than the ones you get at Hog Island for their happy hour, so that was a bonus for us.  Also, the fries were so well-seasoned that you really didn't need any additional condiments.  Love it!  As for the drinks, they have a daily draught beer for the HH price.  The choice beer that night was Downtown Brown which is solid, but just not what I was seeking.  I went with the Prosecco instead.  However, I have to hand to this place, the beers on tap as well as in bottles were exceptional!", "author": "Lisa R."}

For lunch, make sure you do have about an hour and a half or more.  This is not really meant to be a quick FiDi lunch place.  In fact, they didn't even honor our reservation time at 1230pm and we were seated about 20 minutes after our booked time...\n \nTIP #1: A great date spot is in the wooden bench back right corner, which is perfect for two.  The high noise level during lunch will encourage you to chat too.  Don't take my spot!  \n \nWe quickly started ordering so as not to linger for too much longer.\n- Bacon wrapped oysters: Read my tips and my lips.\n- Lobster roll: The lobster roll was light on the lobster, but came with a freshly baked egg bread, which was buttered well.  All accompanied with kettle chips and a cole slaw.  Nice, but it was also difficult to get my mind off the loaded lobster rolls I had in Boston...  This was a lot less hefty.  \n- Seafood etoufee: Just the right amount of seasoning and the portion was just right for lunch.  \n- German chocolate cake: Just right for a German chocolate cake, but if you want more dense chocolate, then you might want to go for something else. \n- Ginger beer: Great cooler to go with your food. \n \nTIP #2: Order the bacon wrapped oysters.

They were visiting from out of town and I brought them here even though I had never been but we like to try new places and I can't think of too bad an experience I've had at a restaurant in the city yet. The menu was small and pretty unimpressive but we managed to find a few things that looked good. Everyone must have agreed that nothing really looked very good because at 7:30pm on a Tuesday they were out of the only items we liked. I probably should have took this as our queue to leave but instead we sat through a mediocre but  expensive meal. \n\nThe real kicker came at the end of the meal when my father--who happens to have lost a limb in a horrific accident--heads into the bathroom only to be assaulted with a poster above the urinal advertising compensation for missing limbs complete with prices posted next to pictures of body parts. Normally he could have brushed this off but at this point felt like not only had his wallet been abused but so had he. When I made a comment to the waiter about whether or not we would actually receive compensation as the poster in the bathroom advertised, he laughed but not even so much as the dessert was on the house.", "author": "Rachel F."}

Last time I went though I was VERY disappointed. First we had to wait for 45 minutes for our table (with reservation). Hostess suggested upon checkin it would be a 10 minute wait and didn't bother to invite us to bar to wait or to give us any other update. After waiting 30 minutes we went to bar to wait. Manager came buy to apologize and wanted to buy us a drink. He told bartender what we liked who promptly ignored us for the next 15 minutes until he came over and asked \"what did you order again, I forgot\". So not too happy when we were finally seated. Alas things went from bad to worse. When uni with mashed potato came out the sauce was VERY over-salted (I usually eat very salty - but this was uneatable even for me). We sent this back and when they re-did the dish it unfortunately tasted just about the same - they must have over-salted the sauce and didn't bother to fix it. We also had a fish that tasted really off I. A couple of other dishes we ordered were ok.

I am a frequent patron at this establishment (my 2nd visit for lunch this week) and I've always been satisfied with both food and service. It takes a lot to get me upset, so I find it necessary to spend time writing a BAD review for Anchor & Hope. Today, I was quite disappointed with the service, and as a result, I did not enjoy my meal my food because I had to rush to eat it.\n\nWhat went wrong:\n\n1) It took 10 minutes before someone came by to take my full order (and I gave a full order of beverages, appetizer, and entree)\n\n2) 20 minutes later before any bread was brought to us AFTER we had to request bread.  \n\n3) The appetizer came out 10 minutes later, only after I had to had help the server bring the appetizer to the right table because she was looking around aimlessly for who ordered the appetizer in her hand. \n\n4)  Another 15 minutes elapsed and my friend had to ask our server if our entrees were coming out.  \n\n5) When they finally came out, I spent the last 15 minutes to eat my lunch.\n\n6) Let me add that the staff did not know how to process their own gift card... Odd since I used it on 2 days ago.\n\n7) From start to finish, my lunch took 1 hour and 20 minutes.  \n\nSure, I did go during peak lunch hours... but it's your job to staff accordingly.  I probably would not be upset if:\n\n1) During the whole time, there were 2 occasions where servers were standing around and conversing.\n\n2) My own server was in the kitchen chatting it up with another person in clear view, not giving a sh!t\n\n3) How many times did you stop by to check on me or ask how my food was?  Zero.\n\n4) Why did the Line Cook have to flag you down so that you could bring me my bill?  Wasn't my frustration evident?  Oh, it's because you weren't paying attention to me.\n\nSo, I'm not sure if I'll be going back to Anchor & Hope anytime soon... It sucks because I still have a good balance on my gift card.

It had a cool ambiance, everything on the menu looked too tempting to decide on just a few things, and our selected appetizers were delicious once they arrived.  \n\nBut (of course there's a but), there were a few too many other things that tainted the experience.\n\n1. Reservations: My boyfriend called to book a table for 4 and was told the first available was at 9:30 pm.  I looked on Open Table through Yelp and was able to book one 45 minutes earlier.\n\n2. Appetizers: GREAT.  We ordered/split the sea urchin which was delish although a little disappointing that it didn't come in the cool shell like some of the pictures online.  The heirloom tomato, burrata and peach salad was absolutely worth coming back for.  And the mussels (we opted for \"bollywood\" style) were not bad either, although I've definitely had better.\n\n3. Entrees: Don't bother. Two of us had the rockfish which was a nice piece of fish that was cooked well.  And the dish probably should have ended there.  There were about 5 other things in the dish that just didn't seem to mesh well together: gnocchi, smokey japenese eggplant, thick strips of roasted red pepper.  \nAnother ordered fish and chips but the fish was barely battered and not that crispy.  And my other friend had linguine with clams which I tried and frankly would have sent back.  It was over spiced and loaded loaded with garlic (lots of full garlic slices throughout the dish).  I also had grit /sand in 2 of the clams I tried. \n\n4. Waiter: very nice but made a few mistakes/forgot to bring us essentials after we asked. He also cut the bill wrong and it took about a 10 min wait for him to circle back to us when we were ready to leave at 10:30.\n\nOverall, maybe this was just an off night?  It'd be a good spot for a lighter diner of just drinks and a few apps. Next time, I would pass on entrees and try to reserve a table through Yelp/Open Table if tables don't appear available over the phone.", "author": "Miss W."}

I was just wondering because I wasn't feeling like I was in a desperate situation and relying on hope to see me through. I was actually relying on someone else's expense account.\n\nSo I have finally completed the triumvirate of swankily packaged, suit-friendly SoMa eateries from Doug Washington and the Brothers Rosenthal - Town Hall, Salt House and now Anchor & Hope. I have to give them credit for opening restaurants that are neither snooty nor overly creative in concept. They all serve good food - pricey yes but good. Since I now work within the lopsided triangle that connects the three locations, they have become the default go-to spots among my colleagues, past and present, for the after-work cocktail get-together or the catch-up business lunch.\n\nLuckily, I actually like the people who were generous enough to take me to lunch there today. I also like the open warehouse loft decor, as it offers space rather than the cozier warmth of the other two places. Although they offer meat and poultry options, it's really a nice fish house as you could guess from the name. What immediately drew my eye on the menu was the $23 Anchor & Hope Lobster Roll which came simply with kettle chips spiced with old bay and a ramekin of cole slaw.\n\nOh yeah, it was really tender and buttery, though I couldn't help but remember getting a similar roll at a lobster shack in Cape Cod for less than half the price. But I'm sure not complaining. It was a helluva lot better than the chicken salad on sourdough I get at Lee's.

I had carefully checked the menu before ordering, and so was surprised to have four sizeable chunks of salmon in my risotto. Salmon! My food kryptonite! I ate one piece, then ate around the rest as it quickly went cold - not how you want to be eating when you're paying $25+ per plate. Shane enjoyed his tuna, but liked the accompanying sausage and beans even more. Our wine finally arrived, but only after we'd flagged down another server. Honestly, the highlight of the meal for us was the Blue Bottle milkshake and wee maple macaron that we split for dinner, both of which were sweet and delicious without making us feel guilty about the indulgence.\n\nI've subsequently been told that Anchor & Hope can be hit or miss - and I received a very apologetic email in response to my complaint - but I still can't shake the disappointment of that last special meal.", "author": "Elizabeth E."}

I badly wanted to like Anchor & Hope but my overall impression was just meh.\n\nThe space was beautiful, gorgeous even in a clean, nautical sort of way. Our waitress was pretty helpful, friendly, and overall the service was generally impeccable. No complaints there.\n\nMy first instinct was to go for the clam chowder as an appetizer but I decided at the last instant to be adventurous (but not ambitious enough to try the sea urchin) and went with the Slow Cooked Oxtail Marmalade and Oven Roasted Bone Marrow with toasted Brioche. I could not have been more happy. The dish was unique, perfectly sized, both rich and flavorful with lots of moist tender meat. The bone marrow was almost sinfully decadent. Everything in the dish just seemed to work well and compliment each other.\n\nSince trying dishes I normally wouldn't was paying off, I decided to continue and went with the Oven Roasted Striped Sea Bass with Fava Bean Brandade, Manila Clams, and Chorizo Bouillabaisse. After all, this was a seafood place and I figured if anything was going to be great, it'd be a fish plate. But alas, it didn't live up to what I was hoping for. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but the bass was just ok and while I love chorizo and clams, the flavors of the sauce didn't really work with the fish.

Be careful as there is a lit candle in the middle of the table which could easily catch fire. ( as a friend quickly made predication come to reality when he he caused our table's bill to catch fire at the end of our meal...lol)\nCalamari thai vinegar: I would say of out of all the interesting dishes this was nothing special. It was good for what it is but really not to die for. \n\nSea urchin, crab in remoulade and mashed potato: I am a big big fan of uni when I go to the Japanese restaurant and a fan of crab as well. However, this dish was extremely heavy, almost like a thick clam chowder but is a much much saltier. The sea urchin is a bit unsettling because it is luke warm. Not as good as when it is chilled. It was a interesting dish to try and the crab meat was great but I would not order again. \nTrout: Grilled trout was a perfect flaky and buttery consistency. 2 large pieces of filleted skin on trout grilled to perfection. Crispy skin with tender meat. The squash is a nice touch to the fish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-29", "description": "Love at first taste in a new restaurant isn't easy to come by, but it's magical when it happens. It all started when a friend emailed me a brief article about Anchor & Hope, a new restaurant in SOMA from the owners of the renowned Town Hall and the more recently acclaimed Salt House. After reading some more promising press coverage, I decided on a whim to check it out on their opening night. \n\nLocated in the Minna Street alley, the restaurant is housed in a renovated warehouse from the turn of the century. According to our very friendly and charming waiter, the Rosenthal brothers (owners) traveled to the seafood hot spots along the East Coast to figure out how to capture the look, feel, and tastes of a traditional fish house by the sea, while still retaining a modern touch. Their research clearly paid off, as reflected in the high ceilings, wood floors, brick walls, lengths of nautical rope dangling from wooden beams, and sea-themed decorations. The resulting space was comfortably roomy and rustic, like an old fish shack, but still urban enough to fit into the city. \n\nSarah Schafer (formerly from Frisson) is the head chef at Anchor & Hope, and the menu consists mostly of seafood items, including several kinds of oysters of the day. My friend and I decided to order several appetizers to share, so we could sample more dishes.\n\nOur waiter informed us that the wine and beer list was unavailable that night, due to some shipping issues. But before we could start feeling too bad, the owner came around and offered us complimentary tastes of white wine. We each ended up getting two generous glasses of free wine for our dinner. Now that's great customer service!\n\nThe food was phenomenal - fresh seafood, creative approaches, and casually fun presentation. We started off with a half dozen of raw Drake's Bay oysters - one of my favorites for the salty flavor. These bad boys were nice and fresh, served with a slightly spicy cocktail sauce.\n\nI had really wanted to try the Angels on Horseback - smoked bacon wrapped oysters - and I'm glad I did. These were amazing! The combination of crisp, slightly fatty bacon, buttery oysters, salt, and mild spice sent my taste buds to heaven and back, resulting in my signature \"zoned out\" look as I was happily chewing. Another excellent dish was the basil-stuffed clams, topped with parmesan bread crumbs. The crinkle of the crumbs contrasted well with the softness of the clams, and the basil was a nice highlight. We also ordered a cold maple smoked trout, stacked atop a warm potato salad layered with some greens and a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette. And we even got complimentary fried smelts! \n\nFinally, for dessert we settled on a warm rhubarb apple crisp with fresh strawberries and vanilla bean ice cream. A wonderfully sweet way to end the meal.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with the Rosenthals' latest offering, and I will definitely venture back to Anchor & Hope to try their main fish entrees, along with that warm sea urchin in a shell appetizer. I hope you'll find the time to make a visit as well! \n\n(See accompanying photos!)", "author": "Lisa M."}

Well b/c i was craving clam chowder! haha. Anyways, the clam chowder was, by far, my favorite dish of the night (which may something about this restaurant, but i'll let you all come to your own conclusions). The clam chowder was not your typical thick, overly creamy potato blend. Rather, the clam chowder here was of thin consistency (which i prefer), had fresh whole clams (as opposed to minced mystery shellfish meat), and was overall packed with clam essence/flavor. You tasted clam, not milk, cream, or potato. The only downside of this dish was that it there was not much soup, especially when you consider the 10 dollar price tag. \n\nMy entree: Prosciutto wrapped brook trout\nThe dish was a whole trout wrapped with prosciutto wrapped around the body of the fish. It lay on top of a bed of brussel sprouts, almonds, and osyter mushrooms.I had high expectations for this dish, but was slight disappointed. First of all, the prosciutto was wrapped around the skin of the fish. I understand if the purpose of the prosciutto was to provide flavor into the fish of the meat, but i still wouldve preferred to somehow be able to consume the prosciutto without eating the skin of the trout. The meat, while cooked well, was a little bland in my opinion. Despite the fact that it was seasoned with salt and stuffed with dice garlic, i felt there was some missing component or flavor that i badly craved from the trout itself. On a brighter side, the brussel sprouts and oyster mushrooms were well cooked and flavored. \n\nThe service:\nOur waitress was decent. She was polite and cordial, but didn't seem like she wanted to be there on a Saturday night and was void of any human energy. She did not check in on us often and relied on the bus boys and other waiters to provide our appetizers/entrees. There was no subsequent explanation of our food when it was laid down on the table (which i needed for the damn trout). \n\nOverall, this restaurant is exactly as i rated it: a-ok. Some of the food was good, some were just decent. But in the end, the price tag was way too high for the food and service we were given.", "author": "Nathan T."}

That's right. I said it. And I meant it too.... \n\nOn a recent visit back to the city I once called home, we were sure to make reservations here for a late Friday evening meal. I love the atmosphere, and the friendly staff, and the professionalism of this place almost as much as I love their BEER LIST! HOLY COW! This has got to be the most diverse, highest quality, and most awesome beer selection in the city. Stuff on tap, stuff in the bottle, its just mind blowing.....seriously. Mind. Blowing. \n\nBeing near an ocean for the first time in months, I had a hankerin for some oysters and A&H did not disappoint. And when I eat oysters, I drink black beer. That's just what I do. So naturally after perusing their previously mentioned extensive beer list, I opted for a local Oakland brewery Linden Street and their \"Burning Oak Black Lager\". Wow. This beer is amazing, and while I know its not the restaurant that should receive the credit for this fine lager, they get the credit for having it...and having it on TAP no less. Brilliant. Oysters and Black Beer people, trust me..... \n\nAfter several Black Lagers and even more oysters, it was time to move on to the entrees. Everything was prepared well and tasted great. Again, moving down the beer list I found a great German Pils to go with my fish and chips. A few more of those Pils' and the evening was complete. \n\nThe meal was not cheap, but as I've said, I just LOVE this restaurant. Beer geeks and sea-foodies alike should make this a must try and be sure to try the black beers!", "author": "Matt M."}

It's definitely located in a small little alley so I'm sure people keep wandering around looking for it. It looks like a grimey wharf export warehouse from the outside. However, it's definitely nice and elegant inside with a touch of San Francisco IF that makes sense. \n\nWe tried out the angels on horseback and these are DELICIOUS. Bacon wrapped oysters? How could you go wrong? Oh right... when the bacon is super salty and overpowering... but they weren't. They were cooked perfectly and the oyster was piping hot. The bacon was just perfectly crispy. \n\nI had their famous lobster roll on brioche. DELICIOUS. The lobster was fresh and clean. It was dressed up a bit but it was perfect and not overpowering. The bread was buttered and melt in your mouth. It comes with slaw, which I'm not that big of a fan, and it comes with kettle chips dressed in SOME kinda seasoning. They were completely addicting. \n\nI'd come back. They have a large selection of beers. On their dessert menu, they have an option for beer and cheese. Yes, you read that right! BEER and cheese.

The manager (we later learned that his name is Danny) quickly walked over and asked if we'd be OK with seats at the bar. Oh, yes, we were. We sat at the far end, where it was quite roomy and actually sort of intimate. \nThe food was fantastic (see below), but the most remarkable thing about our time there was Danny and his attentive, professional wait staff. That old-school, effortless-looking graciousness and attentiveness elude most restaurants today, even the really nice ones. But Anchor & Hope may be an exception, because the manager and staff made us feel like we were guests at a festive dinner party. \nAbout our food:  We started out with half a dozen oysters and frites (french fries) served with mayonnaise and ketchup as well as a bottle of vinegar to mix into the mayonnaise, which I think the Belgians do and which is DELICIOUS. Danny suggested a glass of champagne with our fries, saying that fried food with the clean taste of champagne are a perfect pairing. He was so right. Oysters were icy cold and weren't attached to their shells, so we could tip them right out of the shells into our mouths. Because I like a strong brine taste, I preferred the Cotuit, Mass., oysters to their western brethren. For the entree, we split a dungeness crab filled with dirty rice, both of which were excellent (rice wasn't overly Cajun-spicy). But if you like a whole lotta garlic, you'll love the butter slathered on the crab. The only misses came at dessert time: The cookies were large but average, and our espressos were cold, which I've since learned has something to do with a mistake during preparation of the \"espresso extraction.\" But the warm pumpkin bread pudding with marshmallow cinnamon sauce were absolutely over-the-top tasty.", "author": "Felicia S."}

Upon arrival (between 430-5) to a semi empty restaurant, we immediately were told that we needed to vacate by 7 because of a 7pm reservation. Not a huge issue... However, it would have been more customer friendly to KINDLY mention this tidbit, or simply seated us in the area that hadn't been previously reserved... Strike 1. Then a hostess (the short one with curley hair, NOT the one with a geometric nail design.) came over to take our order. When one of the women in our group attempted to order food, she rudely cut her off and said \"I am only taking your drink order\", and gave her a less than pleasant look... Strike 2. We had 3 more people join our table. Multiple wait staff came to check in with us periodically, which could explain the reason for the issue that occurred when the bill arrived. BUT, it doesn't justify the waitress' reaction. When the bill arrived, we were charged for 5 orders french fries, instead of 3. The oysters, alcohol were fine. When I very politely mentioned this to the waitress (slender, with chemically dyed red hair worn in a bun) she immediately got defensive. She then lied, semi-yelling, and claimed she brought over \"all 4 orders of fries\" because she \"remembers\" doing so, and told me I could talk to her manager. We only received 3 fries, and unless she transformed into two Latino gentlemen, she never brought fries to our table. She took off the two orders, but it didn't make up for her and the curley haired hostess' behavior.

So the waiter recommended Anchor & Hope, the sister restaurant devoted to seafood.\n\nI really enjoyed the Anchor & Hope decor.  So much that I swear I felt a clean ocean breeze upon entering.  Our party of three was seated immediately, at a wobbly table that seemed just bad enough to become a minor nuisance.  The waiter noticed our displeasure (no, we weren't snobby about it!  we were showing a \"we can adjust\" body language) and even shook the table himself to see how bad it was, but rather than move us he disappeared suddenly.  To our surprise he returned with a slice of cork to slide under the faulty leg.  So instantly our hopes were raised for excellent service.  Alas, matey, from there the service level plummeted to the ocean floor.\n\nOur water jug went empty for long stretches of time, and I was never asked if I wanted a refill of my delicious iced tea.  Our waiter seemed to be tending the bar for much of the time, despite nobody being seated at the bar during lunch.  A few staff members were running around clearing tables and filling water jugs.  They would bring out new water jugs for parties who were just seated, then walk past our table, acknowledge that our jug was empty, then do nothing about it.\n\nMy fish & chips came out with no ketchup, and the waiter never came back to ask how we were doing.  I used the tasty tartar sauce concoction to dip my fries and it actually worked out quite well so I didn't bother raising a stink over ketchup.  The fries were tasty enough, and the batter around the fish was light the way I like it.  It hit the spot but I'll probably never order it again from here.\n\nI will say that the menu was packed with other options that piqued my interest.  Including the virgin cocktails at the top of the menu, which all sported names consistent with the ocean warehouse theme.\n\nAll things considered, Anchor & Hope was better than Salt House and a step below Town Hall.  Town Hall has much better service and better food thus far, but I wonder how my opinion might change on future return visits here.

After browsing through some reviews, we decided on this restaurant. I browsed on yelp and I was pretty excited coming in, especially being a seafood hound myself.\n\nWith reservations, we were promptly seated. Service is great and the ambiance is very cozy - dimly lit with little lights here and there. We ordered the bacon wrapped oysters and calamari for appetizers. They oysters were beautifully presented and were delicious, although all I could really taste was the bacon. And really, anything tastes good with bacon. I've had bacon on a doughnut and it was delicious. Calamari was very light and crisp - much better than your average calamari. The good appetizers made up for the terrible bread. Maybe it was because I was overly excited when they brought it to the table in a little brown bag and it was beautifully designed, but the bread was cold and chewy as hell! \n\nAt our table, we had people order the swordfish and the lobster roll. My boyfriend and I shared the lobster roll and a tomato lobster soup. Soup was ok, nothing out of ordinary other than the lobster pieces although a little on the salty side. The lobster roll was very disappointing. The bread was drenched in butter and oil which made it soggy near the center. The lobster inside was ok - I felt like I could've bought something just as good on the streets. The chips that came with it were not very crispy and bland! None of my friends were impressed by the swordfish either. Maybe it was because we came on New Years Eve on a Saturday night when they are grudgingly cooking in the back, or maybe it was because I didn't order oysters which was their specialty, but it was overall not a very tasty experience.\n\nOverall, place is more on the pricey side (~$30 per plate) with ok food and small portions (our boys decided to pick up some fast food after we ate....after their swordfish and 3 plates of appetizers between 6 people!).  Corking fee is $20, although if you buy a bottle they will take off the fee. Service and ambiance is great.

Tall exposed ceilings and rafters which takes the boathouse theme to new levels. Interesting artwork and decor (cool lamps above the bar that look like gigantic fish eyes etc). Excellent beer and wine selection. While there are no spirits, there are literally about 100 different beers to try many from Belgium, Japan, and obscure parts of America. I had 2 great pilsners. The glassware was funky and matched whatever beer we selected. The food menu offered a great array of seafood and it was a challenge to decide what to order.\n\nThat said, there were quite a few hiccups that prevented me from going higher than 3-stars. First although we had 8pm reservations (for 3 people so not a huge party), it took 40+ minutes to be seated at our table. I understand waiting 10 min or so, but 40+ is a bit obnoxious especially when you have a reservation. The food was a bit of a let down largely because of my very high-expectations after eating at Anhor & Hope's sister restaurant (Salt House). It wasn't bad by any means, but was just OK. My pepper seared ahi was gorgeously presented but was just blah...not enough flavour. My appetizer (yellow-tail sashimi) was also just OK (see the recurring theme). My friends did polish off their jambalaya though.\n\n3 stars overall---I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend Anchor & Hope but am open to trying it again.", "author": "Dave S."}

The sauce had a hint of truffle in it, which made me sad because I was too full to finish it.  \n-The Seared Scallops were good as well.

It had a great feel and good energy. The decor was pretty cool as well. My husband and I kept admiring the different arrangements of lighting.\n\nWe both love seafood as well as beer, craft beers to be specific so we were both very excited! \n\nService didn't start off on the best foot, but we were talking so we looked passed it. We ordered beers and decided to order about 5 to 6 different things off the menu so we could get a wide variety of what they had to offer, since we were on vacation and may not be back.\n\nWe were very impressed with the beers we ordered, however, our food came out in a very random order. They did give us the wrong food, but insisted we keep it and wouldn't be charged (which we weren't) they also forgot one of our orders as well (again they brought it out late and didn't charge us). My husband and I don't feel comfortable doing that so we insisted on leaving extra money, whether that went towards the tip or food, didn't matter. \n\nThe food was delicious, we ordered the catalan mussels which were great, but a little over salty.  The ceviche mixto which was heaven and one of my favorites. We also had oysters (Riocky Port and Kusshi) both wonderful, however, I enjoyed the Kusshi. The calamari was good, but again to me over salted. We also split the lobster roll, which was very good, but not the best I've had. We did order the cream of asparagus soup, but that got lost in the mix.\n\nOverall, we had a very nice time, great beer selection, good food, but only ok service.

Yes, I know that's a pretty large claim, but there are two things on this menu that merit the 4 star rating I'm giving.\n\nThe first thing I must talk about is the famous \"Angels on Horseback\".  As angelic as it sounds, they are pretty naughty at the same time.  They describe this dish as \"Smoked Bacon Wrapped Oysters with a Remoulade Sauce.\"  Forget all that...they should just say \"orgasm in a bite.\"  If you're an oyster fan like I am, I'm all about trying new and exciting ways to eat those little slimy, salt-watery, little aphrodisiacs.  As cliche as it sounds \"bacon makes everything better.\"  Real talk.\n\nThe second item I must call out is the Sea Urchin.  This isn't your mama's Uni.  They actually take the Sea Urchin and mix in with Dungeness Crab in a Lemon Beurre Blanc sauce.  As you bite into it, the flavors marry with one another and dance on your tongue.  As for the presentation, they serve this in the Sea Urchin's own shell...kinda morbid, but whatever.  It looks pretty damn cool.\n\nSure I had other things for dinner, and they were good, but those two things are enough to make me come back over and over again.", "author": "Mark P."}

Perhaps I hyped this place up WAY too high but I became very uninspired by what was served. \n\nService: Was ok. The hostess was nice enough to accommodate for the extra person who came and the wait staff was very nice but our waitress was a bit inattentive.  Nobody came to refill out water jug and it took a \"Excuse, we're ready to order\" to have someone come over take our order. I'm not a tunneled vision person. I can understand if you're waiting like a 5-6 other tables but the place was not full yet when we were there. \n\nFood: The major problem for me with the food was the grease and oil factor. And the price we paid for the quality of food, the dining companions and I thought this was definitely not worth it. \n\nWarm Uni, Dungeoness Crab with potato puree: In theory, this probably deserved a 4 stars. It was creamy, rich, and flavorful. BUT I had to really fish for my uni and when i found it, it was the tiniest piece of uni I've ever had. Smaller than 1/2 the sliver of my pinky. It defeats the purpose that its call an uni dish when it has marginal uni. Nonetheless, it was very tasty and probably the highlight of the meal. \n\nAngels On Horseback: Everybody is enthusiastic about this.  \"it's delicious, decadent.\" Yea its pretty tasty, but I'm not impressed by it. I think I've had this before a buffet with similar quality. I just wasnt wow'd and don't really get why its on the 7x7 list. \n\nLobster Roll: Again, minimal lobster, more roll. I've had an excellent Lobster Roll in Boston for the same price and there was like 2x the lobster, it was succulent lobster. That was not the case at Anchor and Hope. The bioche was crispy but saturated in oil and I just couldn't finish the bread. \n\nCod Fish & Chips: Too greasy. It had a very crispy batter and you can taste the beer batter but we had to 'de-flake' the crust to actuall eat it. \nHalibut: This was probably the second most flavorful dish next to the uni dish. It had a combination of tart and sweet, complimented well with the sweet corn. My only issue was that I've had much more juicier and flakier halibut at ISA in Cow Hollow. But overall, this was an above average dish. \n\nAhi Tuna Poke: Typical. \n\nIn conclusion: the meal was grease laden and forgettable. I would've like to have opted for something more dependent on flavors than crispy texture. In theory, everything sounded like a good idea but it fell short. I'd come her to try out the warm uni dish during happy hour. Other than that, I don't think I would return.", "author": "Wendy L."}

Oysters are not my thing. However, our waitress was as elusive and cold as she was tall and presentable. We could hardly track her down, although it wasn't even her fault. Anchor & hope seemed to have been severely understaffed and slightly unprepared for the lunch rush. \n\nWhile my friend was enjoying his single oyster, served with all the accoutrements that one would expect when ordering oysters, I waited for my celery root puree soup. The soup presentation was spectacular: a poached quail egg was placed in the middle of the plate, and then one of the waiter poured the soup from a tiny decanter. If soup were meant to be admired for its aesthetics, this soup would win awards. Sadly, it was as bland and boring as pureed celery root. \n\nWe really wanted to find two different entrees to try, but after rereading the menu for the umpteenth time, we both settled on seared ahi tuna. The standard \"our chef prepares tuna rare; is that OK?\" question followed, and we both answered that we wanted our tuna as rare as possible. Much to my surprise, the tuna, encrusted with cracked farro, was slightly overcooked. It was medium rare, if you will. It was obvious that they used high quality fish. We also ordered a serving of Anchor & Hope fries, which complemented the fish nicely, despite being over-seasoned. \n\nTo cap off our meal, we decided to share some cobbler-type creation served a la mode. Again, it was an obvious case of form over substance. Beautifully presented in a clay pot, the dessert ($8.50) tasted rather pedestrian and overly sweet. \n\nAs I paid our bill ($101 + tip), I felt a little gypped. I felt as though I had a pretty good $50 lunch, and I was being charged double for it. Perhaps it's different at dinnertime, but I don't see myself coming back here for lunch. $118 lunches should be reserved for special occasions, and Anchor & Hope is just not that special.", "author": "Yan G."}

Simple metal tables placed strategically in an open space, large ropes hanging from the rafters, and lanterns  hanging in the corners.  \n\nOn their website they state that diners can come in a suit or jeans.  True to their word, the vibe was a perfect middle between a happy-go-lucky fish shack and the fine dining expertise of a major seafood restaurant. \n\nWe loved everything about our first encounter- from the bread in a brown paper bag to their selection of Belgium beers.  We wanted to order everything on the menu, but decided on the BBQ shrimp and the Halibut and Tuna entrees.  My boyfriend and I were impressed with the cuts of fish and how perfectly everything was prepared.  The halibut was flaky and white and served with a pea ragout and asparagus.  The tuna was a generous portion over beans and Italian Sausage.  We had to run to a performance and were unable to try dessert.  *sigh* \n\nOur waiter, Dustin, deserves a special call-out.  In addition to being professional and attentive, his personality and interesting points of conversation made the evening more like dinner at a friends house.

We got some of the Washington Kumamoto ones (3.50 each I believe)\n- Calamari was crispy on the outside and perfectly soft  on the inside. I normally don't like calamari but I really enjoyed this one. The dipping sauce had a good kick to it as well. \n- Fish and chips were perfectly crispy and the fries were seasoned perfectly. The tartar sauce was definitely on a different level than most -- very yummy!\n- Salmon tartare was DELICIOUS. The avocado base and seasoned crackers/chips were great accompaniments\n- House-made lime rickey (not alcoholic) was yummy. Lots of fresh lime flavor\n- Service was great, waters were refilled quickly, and empty plates were cleared within a reasonable amount of time (one of my criteria for good service)\n\nCons\n- Wish they had removed the brown stuff from the salmon in the tartare (you know, the stuff at the bottom of a salmon filet...the fat?)\n- There was an awkward gap of time for them to finish bringing out all the entrees for the group. Wish they had just let 4 out of the 5 wait for another 2 minutes and brought them all out together. \n\nOverall, a great place and reasonably priced (around $40/pp with tax and tip) for lunch.", "author": "Farhad M."}

I strongly suggest  you go elsewhere.\n\nI was here tonight celebrating my friend's birthday and we had Happy Hour oysters for $1.00 each and champagne for $5.00/glass. I know, I know.. it sounds like a great deal, but they aren't the first, nor will they be the last restaurant to offer $1.00 oysters. I've frequented other places in the past (like East Side West,who had the same Happy Hour special).  \n\nNeedless to say, I know I'm getting a \"good\" deal on the oysters, however, that does not excuse any restaurant from providing extremely poor and unresponsive service. Special pricing does not equal un-special service.\n\nThe oysters were just okay. I mean, I've had better oysters, and Oysters will be Oysters. The mignonette sauce was so-so, but the oysters themselves (though of the tiny variety) were okay, and fresh enough.The broiled oysters, on the other hand, tasted, ummmm... as my friends called it, \"Earthy\", which I take it, is a euphemism for \"Tasted like mud\".\n\nFood aside, the poor service really was the nail in the coffin. The place was 98% empty. No one was seated at tables, and there were only two other patrons at the bar. The lady bartender could not be bothered to help, I had to practically flag her down \" Excuse me!! EXCUUUUUUUUUUUSE ME!!\". I got the feeling we were being deliberately ignored. I even told her nicely that it was my friends' birthday (in an effort to evoke the human side of the ice queen). I got no reaction, no 'happy birthday', no niceties, not even an offer to take my drink order ---- just dull, blank, a combination of Dumb-Snob. .\n\nTo make a long story short, it was hard work getting my drink order, and even harder work to get silverware. I got up and got my own napkin, plate and fork, from another table (yes sirree I sure did.). My husband never even got a napkin or silverware.\n\nSo will the $1.00 oysters from Anchor and Hope save the day? Um.. No. Not really. Actually, not at all.  In this economy, I am surprised they treat paying patrons like shyte.\n\nI will take my $106.00 bar tab somewhere else. If you don't want my business, then I'll skip the oysters-with-the-cold-cold-attitude, and get clam chowder elsewhere instead. Hot clam chowder might make me feel a whole lot warmer inside, a far cry from the chill I got from the service at Anchor and Hope.", "author": "Marie F."}

This is genius! I just wanted to sit on my couch and watch Bravo when the server placed that at our table. The menu is seafood heavy and so we ordered the Calamari, Crab Cakes, and Tuna Melt. The Calamari was delicious though I thought could have stayed in the fryer for a little longer. The Crab Cake was the highlight of my meal as they set themselves apart with the pouched egg and bacon bits. Egg yolk over crispy crab and bacon bits is probably what they serve for breakfast in heaven everyday  It was amazing. The Tuna Melt was warm and gooey. The salad that accompanied it tasted quite bland. Overall I had a great time and I would come back again to try out the other offerings on the menu. The service was great and attentive.

A group of us decided to get reservations for a nice little Saturday dinner in SOMA district of SF.  Wanted to give Anchor & Hope a shot.  \n\nArrived, our table was going to be ready in about 5 minutes. Hung out at the bar and grabbed some drinks.  I opted for the excellent \"Consecration,\" by Russian River Brewing Co.  It's an American Wild Ale.  If you haven't had it before, be warned, it is unique, but very flavorful. I think it's excellent and jump at the chance to order when I see it avail.  Let it open up and get to about room temperature though.  You will see a major difference in flavor.  \n\nSo after about 5 minutes, we sat down at our table.  Pretty quick story from there.  Started with \"Angels on Hoseback,\" smoked bacon wrapped oysters. They are a must.  So good. From there opted for the main entree of Soft Shell Crab Pad Thai.  Also very good.  A few of us then finished things off by splitting Carrot Cake.  It was good, but maybe the weak point.  Not the greatest.\n\nBut not to end on a bad note, all in all, had a great time.  Fun atmosphere, nice restaurant layout, good service and solid food.

So when I had the opportunity to wager a bet with my Cowboys against my friend's Eagles I could not resist.  And Boy what  catches those were...the touchdown passes I mean (34-14).\n \nThe wager was a steak and dinner of the winner's choice- Anchor and Hope was mine since they also served meat as well as seafood (yea I wanted to milk this baby for all it's worth- I mean how could he even think he was going to win on this game).\n \nI decided to arrive early, after a bit of downtown shopping and decided to gloat I mean, wait (while I thought of this glowing review)at the bar.   The restaurant had a quaint yet modern interior, alluding to a boat house.  Giant ropes meandered through the ceiling as did various tools and fishing buoys and the only thing missing were the fishermen themselves.  A school of fish drawings drawn above the bar like Russian matryoshka dolls eaten up by the bigger one-- I felt like one of the little fishes in the school ready to eat the biggest one...you know just like Romo winning his first playoff win to silence all his critics (yay!!!- I just had to sneak that one in there).\n \nMy wait at the bar started with a full tasting of their white wine selection- and I highly recommend them all.\n \nGewurztraminer- Hibou de Nuits, RUssian River Valley, Sonoma Ca. 2007\nFloral, Ripe Melons, Delicious apples and hints of strawberries and honeysuckle\n \nSauvignon Blanc- Forefathers, Marlborough, New Zealand 2008\nFresh, vibtrant with a slight Oak finish\n \nViognier Copain tous ensemble Mendocino CA 2008\nThis one has a sweet honey roundness to it, delicate hints of citrus and kiwi and minerals\n \nMy friend arrived a little late- I let it slide since I could tell he was still sulking from the lost last night, and upon his confession still had a remaining hangover...(enter my aweeees and \"it's ok there's always next year\" consolation).  \n \nWe were seated, I believe, on the best seats of the house where one could see everything in the restaurant and next to the giant floor to ceiling windows so that the passing traffic could get a glimpse of what kind of meal one could be having.\n \nWe started off with a dozen oysters with a selection from both Pacific (Hood Canal, Beausoleil and Kusshis) and Virginia (Malpeque)type varieties...all were memorable fresh sweet kisses from the ocean :-)\n \nI was hoping they had a the halibut but they didn't that evening so I decided on  the Spice Crusted Sea Scallops with Israeli cous cous shaved fennel and madras curry sauce and citrus salt.  The scallops were seared heavily on one side which surprisingly was not overcooked- the caramelized top was a tad too seared I thought but it was still quite delicious.  I did not care much for the madras curry sauce- it overpowered a bit although it was not a heavy serving.  I loved the cous cous- it was cooked al dente.\n \nMy host had the the Prosciutto wrapped Brook Trout with butternut squash, Brussels sprouts and salted almonds with sage brown butter.  This was a superb dish- I delight in anything wrapped in either bacon or prosciutto-- I will definitely use this next time I bake a fish.  The accompanying sides were as delicious and I don't even like Brussel sprouts, nutty and buttery!  \n \nFor dessert we shared the Chocolate cake- a triple layer of moist chocolate cake with tiny praline bits and nuts in the icing.  \n \nHmmm wonder what kind of wine will go well from oysters to saucy fish dishes with that added butter?  Why not try a Gamay?  The low tannin and a mellow wine with a little sweetness and spice...Domaine Ruet, Cuvee Vielles Vignes, Brouilly, France 2006.

The spoiler, though, is the time spent on waiting to speak to the waiter and get your food, 'cause everyone in this restaurant is busy here and there. But, I think it's acceptable, unless you are in a hurry.\n\nWine list was adequate, not overwhelming. The server was helpful and let us have a few samples of different wines before a final decision was made. I was impressed that every sample offered was pulled from a new bottle. They definitely know treating customers right. Beer list was above par with quite a few uncommon selections.\n\nOysters were nice and fresh, though 4 out of 7 types were run out. Bummer.\n\nRisotto with squid ink was great and it reminded me of my trip to Italy. It was full of flavor and I can't ask for anything more.\n\nTuna tartar with cucumber nibs had a refreshing taste. Lobster cakes didn't disappoint - soft inside and firm outside so they didn't fall apart when cut apart - and were filled with decent amount of lobster meat. I'd recommend the pan fried trout based on the comparison with my experience at Bouchon in Vegas.\n\nIn my opinion, Anchor and Hope presents to be a nice and semi-upscale place for happy hour. My experience there was positive, especially after a hard day of work, it is always enjoyable to have drinks and bites in this warehouse-like decorated restaurant. Mind you, you pay extra for being in downtown.", "author": "Edmund L."}

The only reason that it's not getting five stars is that the linguine with clams was a little bland (a little more garlic or basil would not hurt) but still very fresh; everything else was fantastic. The PEI mussels moules frites were outrageously good and well recommended by the wait staff, who were attentive, funny and very well informed on the menu. The maitre'd was fantastic, worked throughout the tables rather than simply standing behind the desk, and made several excellent wine suggestions for me.

I actually liked my view of the kitchen--you can watch the servers plating and chef-guy wielding the Kitchen Aid. \n\nMr. B. and I had enjoyed wine and cheese at the Ferry Building, so were too full to order appetizers--big mistake on our part. Our entrees arrived within 10 minutes of our ordering, right as I was breaking off a piece of the Acme mini baguette. Still, we both very much enjoyethe spice crusted sea scallops and ate every bite ofthe couscous. Delicious!\n\nWe managed to stretch dinner to an hour and 15 minutes and in no way felt hurried by the staff. The only slight snafu was when we ordered a piece of the blackout cake to go. We sat for a good 10 minutes, craning our heads in search of the server. Gave up and asked the hostess the location of our cake; turns out they had very efficiently packed it up and it was sitting at the hostess stand. Our server found us and apologize profusely.

The batter is super thin and crispy and the cod inside is fresh and buttery. Probably one of the best fish and chips I've had but again, I never pay $25 for fish and chips so it better be the best one I've had.

I'm really glad we went because this restaurant opened my eyes to a bunch of new things. Yes, I'm mainly talking about the Angels on Horseback. \n\nFirst and foremost, let me get the things I didn't like about this place out of the way so I can focus on the good stuff. \n\n-Parking is horrible. It's really easy to miss this spot and it's located in an alley. Not a good place to walk to alone at night, especially in San Francisco. \n\n-I got the Warm Sea Urchin, which I was really excited for because I'm a big fan of Uni. It came in the actual shell of a sea urchin which looked pretty cool but the smell was kind of a turn-off. Besides the smell, there was this weird sour/bitter taste here and there. The kind of taste you're hoping not to experience when eating seafood. Overall, this appetizer was a bit of a letdown. \n\nOk, now on to the good stuff: \n\nThe decor of this restaurant is really cute and I think the atmosphere and the lighting makes it really intimate if you bring a date here. \n\nFor our appetizers, we also got the cornmeal fried artichokes which has a great crispy crust. They do not skimp on the artichokes, these babies are huge! The sauce that came with it is amazing as well.  Our other appetizer was the Angels on Horseback, aka Bacon-wrapped-oysters. I'm not a big fan of bacon but I mean everyone else loves bacon and who doesn't like oysters? Whoever decided to pair these two together is a genius. So, all you bacon aficionados, this is a MUST. \n\nAnchor and hope has some pretty amazing twists, and when they pull it off, it is simply out of this world!\n\nAs the main course, my bf got the Alaskan Halibut and I got the Sea Scallops. When they brought out our dishes, at first, I was thinking \"only 4 pieces!?\" I don't know if it was the appetizers before or maybe the bed of couscous under the scallops but I could not finish my scallops. I only ended up eating two! Let me tell you, both of these dishes were to die for! They were melt in your mouth, just like butter-type of goodness. \n\nNow, I know for a fact I had only eaten 2 scallops and had them box up the rest. The next morning, I was excited to eat my leftovers but there was only 1 scallop! I don't know if my bf secretly ate one and is just denying it or if the waitress stole one but if I were you, be very cautious with your scallops, someone will steal them!", "author": "Bianca L."}

Plus two starters, the scallops ceviche and the dungeness crab remoulade.  I enjoyed the ceviche and the crab.  But it felt like a little too much remoulade. . . remoulade with the oysters, the crab, and something remoulade-like with the scallops. Perhaps another form of sauce would be nice to complement to richness of the seafood. . .\n\n I did enjoy the first two bacon wrapped oysters but the last one was just too big and scary-looking and the bacon wasn't too crispy on it.  Loved the first two but I covered the last one with one of the oyster shells. R.I.P. Mr. Oyster.

(but in a good way) the downside is, you only get 4 small pieces! \n\n*buttered dungeness crab: MY FAVORITE! it was so good! it has a little spice to it (because of the peppers), so be warned. It comes with three pieces of bread and bowl of buttered dungeness crab. Generous portions on the crab is a plus! I would DEF. get this one again.\n\nEntree:\n\n* lobster roll: my friend had the lobster roll with the side of salad. I actually liked this one better than my dish! The bun is GINORMOUS, completely-buttered and SOFT! The lobster roll IS good, but I don't know if it's just worth $26. I had a lobster roll at those trucks at golden gate park (Sam's Chowder  House Truck) and I swear it was JUST as good! \n\nSide note - for those that don't know, Sam's Chowder House is an actual restaurant in Half Moon Bay... but they also have a truck that goes around the bay area! They have GREAT sea food choices! \n\n* salmon: I had the salmon. I mean, it was good.. but honestly nothing special at all. Pretty typical salmon you would get at any nice restaurant. Probably would not get this again. \n\nNo dessert. Think the damage including tip was a little over $100 for two.", "author": "Sarah C."}

In fact, the only thing preventing me giving this food 5 stars was the unbelievably strong spice in the broth.  I realize that cioppino broths can really vary (some tend have more kick that others) but when I was reaching for a gulp of water after every fourth bite from a scorched throat, perhaps the chef added a little more spice than intended?!  As such, I ended up not eating that much of the broth and focused on the, once again, delicious seafood.   \n \nThanks to the recommendation by Pinchit...I also gave the oysters at Anchor & Hope a try.  The good part:  they were delicious.  The bad part:  I missed the happy hour, and ended up paying full price!

It is filled with mashed potatoes, big chunks of dungeness crab, beurre blanc sauce, and delicate chunks of uni.  I could have eaten this as my entree and been very happy.\n\nThe french bread they serve to you is really good.  Crusty on the outside, moist and fluffy on the inside.\n\nThe lobster roll was so so good.  The brioche on which the lobster was served was thick, buttery and perfectly toasted, and the lobster was seasoned well.\n\nThe presentation of our dinner was spot-on, and they use a lot of color to make the dishes pop.  The Warm Sea Urchin appetizer was served in a sea urchin shell, which I loved.  All of our dishes were beautiful to look at. \n\nThey have a raw bar with a good selection of local and not-so-local oysters.\n\nThe BF and I did not drink while dining here as we had just come back from Napa and were a little grossed out at the thought, but I did notice that they had a nice selection of unique wines and beers.  Next time I will try some of them for sure.\n\nThe decor was really nice - it was like you were on an old-timey dock in the 30s with nets, unfinished wood plank floors and the lantern-shaped light covers.  Loft ceilings made it feel open and airy.\n\nCONS:\n\nThe Alaskan Halibut I had was way oversalted.  I admit, I'm kind of averse to salty foods (some might say that's weird), but I like to taste my food, not salt, and this was too much for me to handle.   So I asked for a second opinion, thinking maybe it was just me.  Nope...even the BF agreed that it was too salty.\n\nThe Old Bay Kettle Chips (made in house) that are served with the lobster roll were kind of gross.  Some chips had a light seasoning on them, while others were coated in the stuff.  Yuck.  If the chefs could figure out a way to make the seasoning on these chips evenly distributed, they would be wonderful.\n\nThe tables are too close together to have a relaxing dinner.  Next to our table (maybe 2 feet to my left) was a group of Brits that were bitching about how pretentious this or that was, and how the food was so pretentious here.  It was actually really funny, because the pretense just OOZED from these people.  It was too much for me...if the tables had been farther apart, I probably would not have heard them and might have been able to enjoy my food a bit more.\n\n\nSo all in all, I really enjoyed this place, and with a few tweaks here and there, it could be really special.", "author": "Sarah G."}

I've been twice and I have to say that I was a little bit disappointed. \n\nI'm a lobster fiend. A FIEND, I tell ya. Unfortunately the lobster salad that goes into the lobster roll is over-seasoned.

We had reserved a table for 5 people. It started being awful from the time we walked in. The table was put in an awkward space right next tot the bar and the door where you could feel the cold draft every time someone walked in. We asked if we could move to another table and the hostess (in a very snobby way) said no, everything is reserved. I will talk about the staff's attitude later.\n\nThe food \nHORRIBLE!!! Overpriced cheap food with no taste. My husband ordered a steak, two of us had the lobster roll, we had the grilled sardines for apps and also the scallops. The scallops were undercooked, and looked slimy! The steak was probably the smallest steak I have ever seen, and the fries were stale! How can a restaurant not know how to serve fries properly?? Additionally, they were very skimpy with the chips, they brought chips with WARM SOUR CREAM! They only gave us one set of chips for the five of us! The food is bad, bad, bad and overpriced!\n\nThe staff \nOur waitress was very nice and extremely helpful and had an overall great attitude. However, there was a waiter there who had some weird curl thing going on with his hair who was so obnoxious and kept complaining about everyone that he had to serve. The reason we could hear all this was because our table was next to the bar - literally, we were almost on top of the bar. He was loud, obnoxious and only said nasty things about the tables he had. I almost got up and said something to him about being a bit more polite, but I didn't want to ruin the atmosphere (that was left anyway) at our table.\n\nIf you want great seafood - you might as well go to Fisherman's Wharf rather than going here. Save yourself the money and go to another amazing restaurant - there are way too many good restaurants in the city to give this one another chance.", "author": "Julia Z."}

Everything sounded fantastic sea urchin, steak, mussels, tuna. However the food does not live up to expectations. Mind you the food was good but not not great. For example my British friend had the fish & chips ( go figure, he flies 5000 miles and orders food he can get at home) and he gets a smallish serving of fish & chips for $23.  $15 I can see but $23 hello, that's nuts anyone home here?  Anyway I had the braised ribs for $24 served on mashed potatoes and these were god but not great. Overall I'd say the food is good, not great and every dish is overpriced by $5 at least.  \n\nThe wine list was the same. Ok but not great with an average price of $46 a bottle.

The Sea Scallops were cooked perfectly.\n\nWhat I didn't like:  The lobster bisque was hyped by the server, but was super salty and not very creamy.  The BBQ shrimp seemed a little overcooked and uninspiring.  The Shellfish Plateaux was mostly good, but not worth $47.

Some of the food was great - the sea urchin and lump crab appetizer comes to mind, as do a number of the other appetizers which I didn't order but saw delivered to nearby tables.  On the other hand the entrees lacked finesse; my lobster roll was uninspired (not to mention smaller than a similarly-priced sandwich from Woodhouse), and my date's halibut was fine - but just fine, and that's not saying much for a $24 piece of fish.\n\nService was super friendly, but I asked for a recommendation on a bottle of dry sake and the selection was decidedly not dry.  I mean, for all I know that was their driest bottle, so this is either a reflection on the restaurant or the server; either way i suppose props are due for having any sake at an American seafood restaurant.\n\nThe decor is cute; it doesn't actually feel like New England because it has a certain fancy flair, but I appreciate the effort and the art on the walls is clever and welcome.\n\nLike Lynn S. said over a year ago, Anchor is a restaurant of contrasts.

The dish featured sounded delicious and peaked my interest to try. First I will say the sea urchin appetizer was wonderful but I was disappointed with the presentation.

Rough life I know.  It's always a special occasion when our group of old friends unite so we like to live it up.\n\nWe love sharing and trying everything we like on the menu... it's a habit, more like a way of life.  Eating and drinking with my friends is my favorite pasttime in the city.\n\nhttp://www.anchorandhopesf.com/menus/dinner.pdf is a link to their current menu.  Off the appetizer menu, 5 of them were more memorable in some way or another than the rest on the list.  We had a bottle of the Albarino a Spanish White from the Vionta Vineyard in Rias Biaxas region.  It's a perfect Springtime wine and one that goes well when you are eating seafood especially oysters on the half shell.\n\nMy favorite was the Sea Urchin Bowl... now I'm guessing the bowl is a prop. as I'm not sure how easy it is to get sea urchin that big on demand.  Probably just wash and reuse right?!?  That's fine.  Presentation is lovely.  I'm definately going to see if I can make recreate this one on my own for shits and giggles, maybe even give it a little twist.\n\nMy second most memorable plate was the \"Fries with Eyes\" which was fried smelt (like fish sticks but whole fish) served with a Remoulade Sauce.\n\nThe Warm Asparagus Salad with the poached egg, salt cod and Meyer Lemon Hollandaise was solid except I don't care for huge thick asparagus.  I was thinking less is more for asparagi.  The jinormous strands of asparagus was used to create a fort Lincoln Log style for presentation, great but the thinner ones taste better in my opinion.\n\nThe only plate that I was bummed out on was the Seared Sea Scallops that were slightly seasoned with Indian curry and served with preserved lemon-ginger chutney.  The scallops were okay but the sauce (and I think there Israeli cous cous was cooked in this sauce and added to this plate to add dimension) tasted like a cube of chicken boullion.  It was a little off.  \n\nI think the oyster platter that we got before our apps. feast was another show stealer with several different kinds of oysters and a few clams.  Whoo wee.

I was impressed with their speed and gracious apologies for something that was not their fault.  Their wine list was extensive and their beer list is a reason by itself to check this place out. My friends and I ordered our drinks and took a few extra minutes with the menus, so when we finally ordered, the other 20+ people had just ordered, all at once, causing the kitchen to be slammed.  Instead of avoiding our table, as some waiters might, our waiter, Ryan, came over to explain that the kitchen was a little backed up and asked if he could bring us another appetizer or some chips while we waited.  For apps we got \"angels on horseback- amazing, baby octopus crustini-perfect, calamari-excellent, housemade chips.  Everything was wonderful.  \nFor entrees, my friend ordered the flank steak, but since they were out of flank steak they replaced it at no charge with an excellent perfectly cooked rib-eye.  I got the seafood pasta, which sounds simple but was delightful.  They either make their own pasta or they get it from someone who does.  Another friend ordered the fisherman's platter and was also very pleased with how fresh the food was and how nicely prepared.  \nWhen we were so stuffed we couldn't take another bite, our waiter brought over the dessert menu which we politely declined.  He was so apologetic  for our wait, he told us he would like to bring one for the table to share free of charge.  He brought us the 'caramel bar' (or some simple sounding name like that) but what actually came out was a house made snickers.  We pretty much licked the plate clean and thought we would have to roll ourselves home.  It was just too good to leave behind a single bite.  I strongly recommend saving room for dessert.  \nNeedless to say we thought the service was excellent and the staff went above and beyond to meet our needs", "author": "D M."}

The brioche bread was perfectly toasted. The lobster pieces were sweet and succulent, although there wasn't much lobster. Light on the mayo which was good. I did NOT like the slaw; it was wilted and had me wondering if it was several days old (yuck!)?

All ingredients were fresh. \n-BBQ Spareribs: Pretty good. I wasn't expecting anything much since \nthis is seafood restaurant. But the ribs were tender and the portion \nwas generous.

I got the trout, and it was great.  The skin was really perfectly cooked.  I also tried the cod and duck, and they were equally delicious.  I didn't try the scallops since I'm not partial to scallops, but I heard good things.\n\nAs far as downsides, I thought the portions were a little small, especially considering how expensive the entrees were.

I went there for lunch - single girl from out of town here for a conference - on the recommendation (\"it's mildy funky\") of a local friend.  I seriously needed some funk after a morning of FIFO, CAPEX and EBITDA, so I headed over.\n\nThere was a short line upon arrival at 12:40pm on a Friday, but I was able to immediately squeeze in to a single seat at the bar.  Got a menu - and whew, I have to say, I knew SF was expensive but this was way beyond my modest Austinite expectations - $10-$15 for apps and $20-$30 for main courses. I was also surprised by the fact that the seafood offerings weren't that extensive - a good minority of the menu were things like chicken salad and gnocchi.  \n\nAfter suppressing the fleeting desire to flee with my wallet intact, I decided to stick it out and ordered the salmon gravlax/salad appetizer and the steamed mussel and clams for the meal.  \n\nThe salmon was very good - fresh, sliced very thin, with a nice pile of greens on the top and very finely chopped onion. I could have used less dressing, but that's just me.  At $10, this appetizer was actually a good deal given the volume of salmon on the plate.  \n\nBut it was the steamed mussels and clams ($17.50) that really made me glad I came.  Perhaps a dozen plump shellfish floating in a fragrant yellow broth chock full of slivers of onions and bell peppers.  A fun extra touch was 4 tiny sausage balls along with - presumably for flavoring.  I ate every bit of that dish, and sopped up all the broth with the chewy fresh bread provided.  Mmmm.\n\nService was very friendly and accommodating.  The waiter didn't blink when I asked for extra bread to take home with my excess salmon, and he was happy to get me some tin foil for my leftovers rather than the standard big styro box (I hate those styro boxes).  \n\nTruly excellent food, but the bill of $35 for one lunch eater who drank water is a shock to the system.

Any self-respecting SF foodie had to taste the hype. With unbridled excitement, I did so within days of its commencement on April 22.\n\nSpartan decor in a converted warehouse I'd kill to live in. A nice Stoic start; duly noted. \n\nUnfortunately, any further positive note-taking is nonexistent. Fortunately, I had the foresight of self-accessorizing with a bottle of 1990 Chateau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande. While my foresight saved me from whining about the prosaic wine list at the time, it's not doing much for Anchor & Hope now as I recall having had to request that it be decanted. Did the wait staff not notice the way I was cradling and caressing this bottled poetry? To add to my dismay, the joke glasses were never removed and I was forced to propose a stemware exchange...\n\nThe menu was imaginative but unappealing. Granted that this is a bit of an \"oyster bar,\" what is with the shell fish lineup? From lobster, to clam,  to crab, and prawn... I only intended to be branded a bad Jewess for one evening! That means no mussel stew for me, either.\n\nWithout sighting a single hama hama on the menu or basking in the ice trough, this soon-to-be-blacklisted Jewess settled for a tasting of the chowder, prawns, lobster roll, and sea bass. With special exception to the chowder, the rest of the Little Mermaid entourage was lousy and utterly forgettable.\n\nMy wine was rich and austere, though, and finally opened up after an hour. Its fabulous chocolatey aftertaste saved me from having to select more mediocrity from A&H's unpromising dessert menu. I pat myself on the back for bringing an accessory that not only tasted immaculate but also hastened my escape from the Nemo nightmare.\n\nNotwithstanding my lackluster dining experience, the evening wrapped up charmingly as Mr. Washington himself came out to chat about the wine. Feeling bibulous, I ask him for the anchor-shaped leaded paperweight that accompanied the bill. He claimed he only ordered 30 and they cost $40 each. I told him he would have been better off devoting the funds to lighting the restaurant. Seriously, I added, it needs a few buckets of flair.\n\nLeaving Doug still in shock, I escaped the dimly lit lair, which has now begun to resemble a socialist cafeteria.

The Lobster Pot Pie is definitely in my top five favorites of all time. I might even consider changing it to my Last Meal on Yelp.

The super cool piranhas painted on the wall were done by owner Doug Washington's wife.\n\nService was top notch. The staff was extremely accommodating and our server, Devon, was wonderful. We originally started as a party of two, but when we needed to add another place setting, they were able to make arrangements and move us two tables down to the corner table (the best seat in the house, because you could see everything going on), even though they were a full house.\n\nEverything on the handwritten menu sounded amazing. We started off with the fried Ipswich clams and sea urchin with mashed potatoes and dungeness crab, both very salty and rich. Make sure you spread the creamy sea urchin onto their freshly baked bread - it's delicious. For those of you who aren't a fan of uni, this is a great way to eat it because the texture and flavors are masked. Devon recommended a lovely Chenin Blanc to go with the sea bass that I ordered.

Seriously you deserve it, don't be embarrassed be proud. \n\nThis was my third time at A&H and a third time is a charm. You most certainly charmed me today. I sat at the bar and just enjoyed myself. I started with some of those yummy rolls! I want more and more and more but I need room for my main course. I decided to have a Savignon Blanc from Alsace region and with that the tombo tuna melt. Perfection is all I have to say! I enjoyed it so much I chose to have a second glass of this most amazing wine. \n\nA&H is going to be one of my favorite places. The decor, service and food all have me sold! I am a big fan. Maybe I need to start a fan page on Facebook. Hmmmm!", "author": "Scott P."}

Seafood as therapy...I could definitely go for that.\n\nGiven that the inner critics are uncommunicative, let's just talk about the visit.\n\nThe staff was friendly and professional; from the welcoming gentleman at the host stand to our waiter who gracefully explained the lack of wine list at our table (Anchor & Hope's liquor license was delayed).  \n\nThe space is a rehabbed old warehouse with soaring wood ceilings, an open floorplan, nautical touches and a palette of grays and blues that somehow manages to not seem icy.  How did they do that?\n\nThe food:\nOur shrimp cocktail appetizer was very basic, if beautifully presented.\nOur mains were delicious!  I had pan-roasted black sea bass with thinly sliced potatoes and wonderfully lemony wilted greens.  My friend had Guinness-battered halibut with spicy steak fries - quite possibly the most delicious 'fish and chips' dinner I've ever tried.  And perhaps the most expensive...\n\nWe didn't stay for dessert, but on our way out we were warmly invited to come back again soon.  \n\nI can't put my finger on the reason why I liked this place so much on the very first try.  It could be that I wanted to taste most of the entrees on the menu.  It could be the touch of elegance combined with whimsy in the decor and execution.  Another reviewer mentioned the word magical and I think that might have some merit - sometimes a restaurant just hits the right notes at the right time.  All I know is I'm very happy to have this place so close, and I will definitely be back to try their food with wine.  And some dessert...\n\n(Update 5/02:  Liquor license issue resolved!)", "author": "Suzanne B."}

It's like we lose all concept of the size of our appetites when we start reading a menu. Or we'll be full from a meal we just consumed mere hours ago and think we need another snack when we see a menu. It's bad. \n\nThis gluttonous behavior happened to us when we entered Anchor & Hope. We were taken by the wonderful atmosphere, friendly hostess and big bucket of what looked to be Acme bread at the end of the bar. \n\nOnce we looked at the menu, we were hooked. We were in traditional form and decided to order a variety of items so we could try everything that sounded good. \n\nOur waitress was nice enough to split our dishes (without us asking) so we each had our own plates of food. \n\nHere's what we tried. \n\nParsnip and dungeness crab bisque - amazingly creamy and just the right amount of crab. It was sinfully rich. \n\nBasil broth steamed clams - well prepared clams and tasty broth. We used the aforementioned Acme bread to soak up every last drop of the broth. \n\nWarm sea urchin with potato puree and dungeness crab - this was a standout dish and made the meal for me. The urchin tasted like the sea (in a good way) and was delicate, smooth and went well with the potato and crab combo. At $16.50 it's a splurge, but worth every morsel. \n\nLobster roll - huge chunks of lobster, served on brioche and house made potato chips. \n\nI wanted to order the brussels sprouts, calamari and house made salmon gravlax but somehow restrained myself. In retrospect,  I'm happy about that because I need to save a few menu items to try during our next visit.", "author": "Lee H."}

HOWEVER...the experience did not start well.\n\nWe had a reservation for a party of 2 for 12:30 pm.  Since it was the first time either of us had gone to Anchor & Hope, and didn't know it was so easy to walk to, we arrived a bit earlier at 12:10. (And we wanted to finish lunch early to get back to meetings.)  The restaurant was busy but there were tables opened.  We asked the hostess if we could be seated earlier and she was pretty non-committal and said they have some reservations coming in.  We waited in the small entrance way, along with 2 other parties since the bar seating was filled up.  So I swear she seats 2 ladies who walked in WITHOUT a reservation who came in AFTER US.  In the mean time, there are still 2 tables open (from the time we came in the restaurant).  Then my friend remarks, \"I hope she didnt make us stand for 20 minutes and will seat us at that table right by the door that has been open all this time.\"   So we're still waiting. \n\nAnd then at 12:30, the hostess seats us at the rickety table that was open all along, which she wouldn't let us take.\n\nAND, then my friend points out to her, why did you make us wait since that table was open the whole time?  She mumbles some excuse WITHOUT AN APOLOGY OF ANY SORT about the restaurant having to work out the number of tables, blah blah blah.  \n\nSo mind you, were were hungry and now even cranky.  And we had been waiting for 20 minutes for a table we had been staring at... Did she want a tip or something to seat us earlier?  \n\nWhen we sat down, the table was uneven, which they fixed for us.  The menu looked good, but my appetite was already surpassed by my upsetness.   \n\nWe ordered the Angels on Horseback - bacon wrapped oysters ($13) which are a MUST HAVE if you try your luck here.  I had the blackened catfish sandwich and my friend had fish and chips ($23).  The food is pretty good, but we were pretty irritated to enjoy the experience.  I have to say, the wait staff was really attentive and nice and made up a little for the hostess.\n\nYour wonderful wait staff cannot continue to make up for the lack of experience and the poor attitude of your inept hostess.

Glad to see such a different approach in building a classy restaurant straight out of an old warehouse.  Their before pictures straight up looked like a  Public Storage space.  They've kept the rustic touch by keeping an uneven paint job on their front entrance wall.\n\nThe vaulted ceilings allow the usual overly noisy buzz to travel up and out.  Ropes dangling over the untreated wooden cross beams and muted industrial lights give patrons a sense that they're dining in the hull of a creaking ship.  \n\nMy party of 4 was probably given the best seat in the house.  It's the 4 top hidden in the back corner, so we got a private room feel during our visit.  The openness of the restaurants really helps with the flow of space.  I find it so rare in SF restaurants to be able to walk normally, as opposed to side stepping it to avoid knocking someone's head with my purse.\n\nWe started with the Angels on Horseback, an oyster wrapped with bacon and dressed with a creamy tangy sauce.  This dish could not lose... an old flip flop fried with bacon would be delicious!  But texturely it worked well -- soft and crispy are a favorite combo of mine.  \n\nFor my main, I had a seared tuna fish dressed with baby greens, creamy tomato sauce, and tempanade.  Overall it was a well-prepared dish.  The sauces carried the flavor of the entire meal, but really could have left out the tempenade.  Overly salty and powerful for the delicate flavors of fish.  Almost made the fish taste sour.  \n\nA strong contender for best seafood in the city.  One of those restaurants that will be on many \"must try\" list.", "author": "Chris T."}

It makes my list of best places in SOMA and perhaps even the list for best places to eat on a regular basis after work.  I had the same expectations for Anchor & Hope, considering the same ownership.\n\nOverall, fairly impressed with the place.  I think it's a better place for a larger group than Salt House. The menu is diverse with a variety of fish and other seafood, along with short ribs and a chicken dish.  The trout was excellent and prepared very well and the short ribs were excellent.  They have a nice beer list as well.  I enjoyed the experience but I may not frequent back too often.\n\nI do think if you are in town and looking for some solid seafood you have numerous choices.  Farrallon is expensive but by far the most impressive and a few other places including Bar Crudo and Waterbar have hit the scene.  Anchor & Hope is not among that class, but I still think it's a nice, somewhat casual and fun place to visit for seafood and a nice beer or glass of wine.", "author": "E L."}

It was very tasty.  We also had a red snapper sashimi with Ponzu sauce.  Delicious, and we topped it off with the Lamb.

Brought to you by the same folks that did Town Hall and Salt House, this place purported to be a seafaring version of the other two places, and having been wowed at Salt House, I had high expectations for this place. I don't know who does the architecture for all the Town Hall restaurants, but they really get it spot on with the motifs. This place had high slanted ceilings with exposed beams and maritime themed decorations all over. Extra points for innovative design.\n\nI started with the Tai Snapper Ceviche. I'm not quite sure what the sauce was, but it was slightly acidic and very light, not overly limey as most places that attempt ceviche tend to do. The Tai was sliced well and fresh, I really loved the texture of the finely diced red bell peppers and chives. Great starter to the meal for me. My companion OrangeJenn, ordered the Baby Bib Lettuce with Cara Cara Orange Salad off the DAT menu. Sounds simple enough, but someone in the back got a little too zealous with the salt as the bite I tried I could taste a several grains of coarse salt. OrangeJenn also complained about it being overseasoned.\n\nFor our entrees, she got the Spice Blackened Mahi Mahi, Shaved Fennel and Arugula Salad, Rosemary Pesto. The Mahi Mahi was cooked correctly, coming out juicy and tender, but the fish just lacked flavor. The Rosemary Pesto was too understated even when you lathered it on the fish. My Lobster Roll on Toasted Brioche on the other hand was a whole other story. The Brioche was toasted perfectly and matched well with the generous portions of lobster in creamy sauce peppered with diced celery. There's nothing more I hate when people overdo the creamy sauce, but this one was light. The accompanying Cole Slaw was a little tart, but still good and the Old Style Kettle Chips made a good pairing with the meal. I relished each bite of this delectable sandwich. We also split (read she ate one and I ate the rest) a plate of Steamed Mussels with Herb Ribboned Fries and Creme Fraiche which was also very well done. The mussels were larger than what's normally used in a preparation like this, which I enjoyed. I hate picking through a plate of quarter sized mussels. The Herb Ribbom fries added a contrasting texture to the dish and were just fun to munch on. \n\nFor dessert, I had the Meyer Lemon Souffle with Huckleberry and Thyme Sauce. When I see a souffle on a menu, I have very distinct preconceptions of what should be. The words light and and airy come to mind. The words curdy and custardy do not. On top of the failed texture, the flavor was way too tart and sour, even for a Meyer Lemon. The Huckleberry Thyme sauce did nothing to tame this flavor. The DAT meal came with Chocolate Blackout Cake topped with Sea Salt Pistachio Brittle. This dessert reminded me of my last girlfriend, dark, salty, and leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. The cake was very dense, almost fudge-like. I thought there was too much dark chocolate or not enough sugar and damn it, I know fleur de sel goes well with dark chocolate, but I wish chefs would stop putting salt on desserts. Really, I think they should have named this place Salt House instead of the other place.\n\nI really wanted to like this place given my experience at Salt House, but there was just too much inconsistency here. Measured solely on what I ordered, I would say the only miss was the Souffle, but factoring in OrangeJenn's plates, that really brought the experience down for me.

Earlier in the day, I received a vm from A&H notifying me that they hadn't received their liquor license yet so they could reschedule our reservation or chill/serve our wine at no charge. Kudos to the girl who had to make those difficult calls--I appreciated the notice. We brought our own wine from the corner store and it was just fine. \n\nOur waiter even recommended foods to go with the red wine that we brought (I know we were having seafood but that's what I wanted). We had three different types of oysters: two East coast (because they are a little richer and go better with red) and one West. All delicious.\n\nNext was asparagus salad and the salmon/mixed greens/fried oyster appetizer. Very crisp and refreshing. The salmon was super fresh (nice to not have raw smoked salmon for once) and the mixed greens really complimented everything--nice contrast with a crispy fried oyster. My bf pointed out that I don't usually like inconsistent textures but I liked this!\n\nEntrees consisted of the seafood stew (monkfish, mussels and chorizo meatballs in a rich broth) and the halibut fish & chips. The stew was accompanied by some nicely toasted focaccia that dipped just fine. I LOVED the crunchy-on-the-outside-but-soft-on-the-inside-chips. The tartar sauce was more of an aioli and I dipped those fries in there, too. Of course the fish was tender and flaky and cooked just right--batter stayed on but wasn't too thick.\n\nSince I was feeling greedy, I had the chocolate pudding cake all to myself--nice and moist and great texture on the outside (pistachios?). The bf had the strawberry-rhubarb cobbler with home-made graham cracker topping a la mode. I had to admit it was good although I don't care for rhubarb.\n\nOh and I almost forgot to talk about the place itself--cool, clean, decor. Service was fine and they just need to fine-tune by bringing the correct silverware with the food (mini-spoon with oyster sauce, spoon and bowl for discarded shells with stew).", "author": "Kat H."}

One thing that you might want to keep in mind -- this is the kind of place that the appetizer is better than the entrees...that's my feeling.  But don't get me wrong...thats only cause the appetizers were really REALLY good.  Here's a few that I had:\n\nAppetizers:\n\"Fries with Eyes\" -- smelts and remoulade sauce.  \nSimply, just battered little fish with dipping sauce.  As simple as it is...it is actually pretty good.  The fish are not dried out but still juicy and moist.  The batter just thck enough to get the crispiness and battered taste.  Very good balance\n\n\"Warm Sear Urchin In The Shell\" -- with mashed potatoes and dungeness crab\nThis is a very good appetizer.  I'd say this serves about three per order...tapas portion.  I normally don't like sea urchin any other way than sashimi style, but this time...hands down..good job.  There's also a creamy sauce that they mix in with the sea urchin, crab, and mashed portatoes...almost like a chowder sauce.  Oh, and the sea urchin is still raw..thank god.  Made very nicely.\n\n\"Angels On Horseback\" -- smoked bacon wrapped oysters\nBacon wrapped...only in the states!  Haha.  This dish is not bad.  I mean, what can possibly go wrong with bacon wrapped anything right?!  If you like the bacon wrapped hot dogs they sell on the streets after clubbing, then you'll certainly like this.  Oysters are very nice and fresh and juicy,\n\nEntrees:\nFor the entrees, I had a oven baked fish with leeks...I forgot what the fish is called...something that I don't see everyday.  But just like the waitress said, it is a fish that is very similar to the taste and look of salmon.  It was cooked very nicely...very fresh and juicy...and yet just the right about of rawness in the middle and cookedness on the outside.  Good dish.\n\nMy other friends had the Lobster Roll.  I had a small bite.  It was pretty good...but I needed a bigger bite to comment on it. Haha.  The chips that came with it is homemade and fresh though.  So that's always a plus.\n\nThat's it for the food.  A few side notes:\n-Great service\n-Nice atmosphere and deisgn.  Minimalistic and clean.\n\nAnyways, that's it from me.

Ordered the Sichuan pepper prawns, which had excellent spice & flavor, and also the chowder which was among one of the best Ive had in a long time!\n\n3) Wine list was reasonably priced and offered a wide variety of selections (ordered the Foxen Chennin Blanc $40...clean).\n\n4) One of the misses for me was the decision to put potato wedges with the Smithwick's battered halibut.  It just seemed like a little too much heaviness for a fish dish (maybe a cole slaw or something light would have balanced it out).  Also had the Rib eye which was cooked to temp and had nice flavor and came with a great, spicy Dijon Bordelaise on the side.  \n\n5) The other big miss was the service.

Because I grew up on the New England coast, I was excited to find a lobster roll on the menu.  The $25 entree involved an oversized roll with a meager amount of overdressed (very wet) lobster consisting of only tiny chopped pieces -- no larger chunks at all -- along with a side of cole slaw that was so soupy it was inedible, and a pile of ordinary potato chips.  It was simply the worst lobster roll I have ever eaten anywhere, and therefore extremely overpriced given the poor quality.\n\nMy friends' meals were better than mine, but not exceptional in any way.  The service was only average.  I was expecting more from the owners of Salt House and Town Hall, both of which I love, but this was a real step down.

But man, even on a business lunch budget ($75/two people), this place was pushing it in terms of cost.\n\nWhy the mussels and fries are not on the appetizer menu is a bit perplexing, but whatever. We ordered them off the entrees and at it as a starter. Portion was small considering it was intended to be an entree, and I wish they had either served the mussels in a shallower dish so the sauce could mingle with the mussels, or fill the bucket thing a little more with sauce. To me, the whole reason you get 'moule frites' is for the sauce--both on the mussels and for dipping fries into. Regardless, it was tasty.\n\nThe lunch entrees are composed of $15+ sandwiches and $25 entrees. We had the lobster roll - very tasty, if not a bit greasy. Coleslaw was flavoriless, and chips were so so. I would have rather eaten a larger sandwich for the price. We also ordered the salmon with basmati rice -- again, pretty good, but salmon and rice for twenty-something bucks? Eh.\n\nFor the price and the reputation, I was expecting something a little more creative and varied. I wouldn't go here on my own. But for another $75 lunch? Why not.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-01", "description": "I love finding a new restaurant and being able to give it five stars, and after a few visits, I'm thrilled to report that Anchor & Hope definitely deserves all five.  Located in a former auto mechanics bay (and somewhat hard to find, off the beaten path on Minna between Mission & Howard at 2nd street), this new restaurant delivered on all points.  They've been open a relatively short time and seem to have ironed out any of the wrinkles that were initially present and to be expected in a brand new establishment. \n\nService -- extremely friendly, accommodating, helpful, and attentive.  The hostess and waitstaff dazzled.  \n\nBeer/Wine -- extensive selection of bottled beers, served perfectly.  Very well thought-out wine list, not too lengthy but hitting on all cylinders.  \n\nFood -- excellent.  Three of us shared two appetizers, the exotic beet salad (so delicious, and perfectly balanced), and the Ipswich fried clams, which were delicate, crispy, and so flavorful.  Note that these are not the rubbery strips so typical of many restaurants, but are tiny, Ipswich clams, lightly battered, and then fried crisp and served with a nice house-made tartar sauce.  \n\nThe entrees were great too, and I commend the restaurant on its portion control -- it was \"just right.\"  I am so tired of restaurants that feel like they have to overwhelm us with volume, and conversely with places where the food is so very special they can allocate only precious tiny tastings for big prices.  I had the halibut, served with crispy potatoes (they were nice and held the rosemary on the potatoes for me -- I recommend asking them to do it -- rosemary overpowers the fresh pure flavor of the potatoes otherwise.)  My friends had the scallops, which were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the bass, grilled and served with peaches.  \n\nOn another visit, this time at lunch, I ordered the crab salad.  After being assured that it included no onions, I was not happy when with my first bite of the crab, I discovered finely minced onions.  However, the waitress swiftly whisked it away and replaced it with the shrimp salad.   A minor glitch, but something that restaurants need to be aware of -- many patrons have sensitivities to certain foods and it's not just that we don't \"like\" it -- it almost puts us in the emergency room. \n\nI must mention the desserts, which earn a couple of stars.  We three shared two desserts:  the rich, moist chocolate espresso cake, which was truly spectacular, every bite so succulent and rich; and the fresh peach & cherry crisp, served with house-made vanilla ice cream, which married somewhat tart peaches, very sweet cherries, and a buttery topping with the creamy smooth vanilla goodness.  I would be hard pressed to determine which was my favorite -- both were excellent.  (Realizing I've used \"excellent\" and \"perfect\" way too many times already, I do feel compelled to add that they serve excellent coffee, in oversized cups.  It's perfect!)\n\nAmbiance -- like all but a few restaurants, yes it's noisy and at times we had to repeat ourselves to be heard.  But this didn't diminish our enjoyment of the restaurant, with its subtle nautical theme.  It's not kitschy like something you'd find at Fisherman's Wharf, but more like the types of lobster places that dot New England.  Note that this is more like the favorite place the locals frequent, and they usually keep it to themselves while sending the tourists to the paste-like clam chowder house tourist traps that most New England towns are packed with. \n\nPrices -- are about what you'd expect in FiDi, and given the quality and service, well earned.  I highly recommend trying Anchor & Hope, especially if you're burned out on all the other restaurants in the area.      I've visited the sister restaurants Town Hall and Salt Box numerous times, and have to say this one is my new favorite of the three.  Reservations were easy, via OpenTable.  I've learned, however, that if you're trying to book for a specific time and OT shows it unavailable, to call the restaurant directly -- they often have availabilities that don't show up online. \n\nColor me happy!", "author": "Bevy M."}

We also had the \"fries with eyes\", which were fried smelts with a dipping sauce. Fried = tasty. For my entree I had the Smithwick's battered cod with rosemary potato wedges. I couldn't have had a less healthy selection, but I had seen it online and wanted to try it. I'm sure glad I did because the fish was battered so it had a delicate yet sturdy coating with a tangy tartar sauce. The taters were perfection. It's not my fault fried stuff tastes good! A couple people in my group had the boulliabase, which they also enjoyed. Our group ordered dessert, and the stout cake with maple gingersnap ice cream was delicious, and so was the apple pie with hazelnut ice cream!\n\n Service:I wish I had gotten our servers name because she was so on top of it without being overbearing. We were dragging our asses and she never pressured us. She was also quite knowledgeable about the wine and beer list, which are both quite extensive. Awesome wine-by-the-glass selection.\n\nThe space looks fantastic at night time, and it's lively without being too loud. We had a good time, even if it was a business dinner. Best part about that though was that I didn't have to pay, and we got to order all kinds of appetizers, desserts, and wine without worrying about the pricetag!

They're all okay, but not spectacular--not a destination restaurant but probably better than your average neighborhood restaurant. I had the Fisherman's stew, which was on the skimpier side, although the broth was really delicious (spicy, and not too tomato-ey).  My partner had the lobster roll, which he thought was good, but nothing to write home about.  Dessert was a good strawberry shortcake--again, everything was okay, not spectacular, and I would probably be more enthusiastic if I'd liked the service.  But our server seemed to be in a rush--we'd barely been seated when she came to take our orders.  And after we ordered (no starters), the food came about 5 minutes later.  I kid you not. We did order dessert, but I felt like the server kept checking in on us, which gave the meal a very rushed feel (not the mood we were going for, since we were meeting friends whom we hadn't seen in a year).

I ordered two -- one for appetizer, and one for entree :)\n\nWhile the staff is polite and friendly, all of our waiter/waitresses were neglectful to some degree.

As well, one \"helpful\" waitress insisted on taking my used spoon (after I was done with my appetizer) despite my refusal to surrender, yet she forgot to give me a new one with my entree (another sea urchin).\n\nOn to the food, the sea urchin was indeed a great exhibition of originality and creativity.  However, there were a few problems with the dish.  The beurre blanc was overpowering the taste of crab and sea urchin.  As well, there were pieces of feature bones and shells inside the dish.  I jokingly said to my friends, \"Gordon Ramsay would not approve of this dish\".\n\nAll-in-all, it was an excellent meal that did not live up to its hype.  I am torn between a three and a four.

Now all skepticism out of the window for A&H!!  \n\nWe started off with a dozen oysters and a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.  While I wasn't sure if the wine was truly worth $70 (would've gone with beers but wine seemed to be a more reasonable choice for a dinner party of two), the oysters were all very good.  The Kumamotos were sweet as always, and the Kushis were larger in size and creamier in taste.  \n\nMoving onto our appetizers: We had the beet salad and the warm sea urchin in the shell.  The beet salad, as expected, was refreshing and light.  The warm sea urchin was probably the richest seafood appetizer I have ever had...  It was made with crab and mashed potatoes and cream...  It was like eating foie gras from the sea.  Every spoonful was heart attack delicious and just as I thought I was getting overwhelmed, I went for another bite.  The shell was scraped clean when it was taken away from our table. \n\nWhich made sharing an entree a smart idea.  \n\nWe got the grilled petrale sole with Brussels sprouts, which was ideal following the sea urchin experience.

The entrees were not as outstanding as the appertizers. My entree at least was mediocre. I remember one of us had this seafood entree, similar to cioppino, and it was huge. It looked delicious!

However, we recently had a HORRIBLE experience that is makes us question the quality of this restaurant and its employees.\n\nWe visited Anchor & Hope on Saturday, August 18th to complete a day of activities celebrating my wife's baby shower. We had a number of out-of-town guests and thought it would be nice to finish off the evening at Anchor and Hope since my wife and I have both had wonderful experiences at the restaurant. Our server for the evening was Ryan (if you ever get him, request for another server). To make a long story short the service was so bad because, plain and simple, we were ignored. When we sat down, our waiter Ryan promptly came over to take our drink order. When the drinks came, we asked that we needed a few more minutes to look at the menu. That was probably the last time that Ryan voluntarily came over to our table. \n\nOur meals came extremely late -- Grant it the restaurant was busy because it was a Saturday so it's understandable that things may lag. However, I don't think it should take 30 - 40 minutes. We even had to call Ryan over once again to ask him what was going on with our order. This is a good time to note that in the 30 - 40 minute wait, Ryan did not come over to our table one to ask if our drinks needed to be refilled or to apologize for the delay.\n\nRude service -- Again, we've received some very bad service in the past but this past  experience with Anchor & Hope was by far the worst dining experience that we've ever had. After dinner, we called the general manager to let her know how poor the service was. She was very helpful to try and smooth things over by offering to comp our drinks and dessert. However by this time, all we wanted to do was pay the check and leave. After the general manager delivered the check, we reviewed the bill and placed the bill with credit card and cash at the corner of the table for Ryan to pick up and close the table. Ryan walked by us a number of times  without picking up the check. One of our guests actually stood up and tried to hand him the bill with cash and credit card but Ryan blatantly turned around and ignored her. I then had to go back to the general manager to at the bar to close out the check.\n\nI spoke with a couple of the managers a few days later. They said that disciplinary action will be taken and that I am suppose to receive a follow up email. It's been a few days now and I have not heard back from them. I sincerely hope that this issue isn't swept under the rug.\n\nIt is important to note that Ryan did not once come back to our table to apologize for any of the above mentioned. We have received some bad service in the past but  the experience with Ryan at Anchor & Hope takes the cake for the worst service ever and it really makes us question about ever returning to what was once one of our favorite restaurants.", "author": "Arvi R."}

I hadn't done any research and was only expecting a good meal. I'd seen some press leading up to the opening but it dropped off my radar until early this week.\n\nArriving I found an nice open space and given the decor was given notice that this was seafood and they seemed serious about it. A chalkboard near the door listed the oysters and shellfish for the day. My friends were already seated and we got down to the business of menus. The very first item on the menu was teh Anchor & Hope Chowder with white corn and little neck clams. My bar for chowder is Hog Island's Clam Chowder. This particular variant was rather sweet with just a few clams. In short, all chowder, few clams. Nice taste but all broth. Ahh...too bad.\n\nEntrees were next. I'd ordered the bass. My friends went with the Lobster roll and the special of the day - soft shell crabs. My bass was fine...flaky and cooked well but little taste. The comments from the other side of the table were to the effect that rather than serving east coast fish the chefs should stay local. I'd agree. It was all \"fine\" but nothing near inspired.\n\nThe chocolate cake for dessert was lovely and the wines-by-the-glass selection was pretty good.

We were there with a client He had barely finished his first glass of wine, when he decided to look at the wine list and order a 2nd bottle. It was at this time that he noticed that the wine menu had a derogatory term on it. He immediately asked to see the manager to point out the term and request that in the near future it should be changed by the owner because it could be construed as offensive. When the manager on duty, who was very very young, came to our table she thought the ordeal was funny.  She just kept smirking and made lite of what he was saying, which of course angered our client because she did not take his request seriously.  All she had to do was to tell him, thank you for pointing this out and I will let the owner know.  But instead she continued to disrespect him in front of the entire table.  She then refused to serve us wine and then walked away. I would be very very careful about bringing clients to this restaurant since they don't understand the concept of the customer is always right.  Since we still hadn't received our meal, and our client was incensed, we thought it best to leave and find another restaurant to eat dinner at.   \n\nWe did walk down the street to Umbria.

They start you off with a baguette that's pretty good: crispy on the outside, and really soft on the inside.\n\nWe started with clam chowder, some fried calamari, and a dozen raw oysters.  The appetizers were far better than the main course and dessert.  I didn't try the clam chowder-- but the fried calamari was good.  I think they have some lemon zest in the batter which gives it a fresh taste, and it comes with a sweet and spicy sauce that I think is balsamic vinegar, grilled onions and hot peppers.  The raw oysters on their own were good, and they came with a house seafood sauce that's not as tart as the usual stuff, as well as black peppercorn in oil.\n\nThey do put together some interesting combinations of flavors, but I didn't like them that much.  My uncle had scallops on couscous-- you get three large scallops, and they pour a buttery curry sauce overtop.  Tastes new, but not that great.  I had a brook trout with a light mustard sauce on some beans, and I didn't like that combination.  The beans weren't soaked for too long so they still had that grainy taste, and the brook trout wasn't anything special.  So it's not terrible, but I think it would taste better if it could be made more moist.\n\nDessert was this chocolate mousse thing with peanut butter cookies.  Not that tasty.

It's a wonderfully huge & airy space, so I can imagine it being great for groups.  \n\nThe food is top notch. We got a variety of oysters and they all were unbelievably fresh & mouthwatering. Some distinct undercurrent of flavors that made each kind pretty distinct. The sea urchin appetizer was FANTASTIC, not to mention that it was presented in a badass way (sea urchin, fresh crab, and mashed potatoes served up in a spicy sea urchin shell). The fresh crab claw was fun too (although wow... had to default to the GF to crack it open after my part went flying across the floor and under the table next to us). Oh and dessert fiends, the butterscotch dessert was damn good too.\n\nThe bacon wrapped oysters (aka Angels On Horseback), however, were disappointing. That was the dish that was raved about recently on the 7x7 100 Things To Eat In SF Before You Die list so based on some of the other things on there I was familiar with, I had very high expectations for this one. The bacon was flavorful enough, but the cooked oyster had an extreme flavor that overpowered everything too quickly. Good idea, but I think they should go back to the drawing board to get the flavor right. Also, the raw Kampachi appetizer was just good, but not exceptional.\n\nIt is worth noting that the service was EXCEPTIONAL. Our waitress not only knew everything about every kind of oyster on the menu, and when I asked her to describe each of the three Rieslings on the wine menu so I could order the sweetest one like my girl likes it, the bottle we chose showed she nailed her description right on the head. Also--the manager apparently thought the restaurant was taking too long to get us going on our food (we didn't notice anything out of the ordinary though), so he came over and told us he would be comping the entire oyster assortment. In fact, we were just ordering a few initially, so he really hooked it up big time. Fucking awesome and it really felt great to be taken care of like this from two people at the same restaurant.\n\nExcited to try some of the entrees on the next go around, and oh yes, there definitely will be another go around.

Service was good. Wine and beer was good though not inexpensive. The ambiance is cool. Nice decor. My husband in jeans was probably the only man in the whole restaurant not wearing a suit. I guess that's because it's downtown and we went on a Thursday night. I like the Old Bay chips to start. Husband had the King Salmon which at $30+ should be excellent and I would say it was very good; salmon was a touch more done than I like. I had the Linguine and Clams ($24). Clams were small but tender. But the sauce was disappointing. Very similar to the red sauce I make at home. Nothing special at all in fact the menu said garlic as the first (other) ingredient and I didn't taste any. Also not served with anything notable like a nice triangle of bread, etc. Dessert was $8 for the red velvet sundae which was a rip off. Dry pieces of red velvet cake over vanilla ice cream with icicles plus caramel and pecans. I do not recommend though I think if I made it myself with homemade cake it would be yummy.

In my opinion, the food was fine, not exceptional, and certainly not bad, and even a solid step up from mediocre. I'm always looking out for the strict veggie and vegan crowd (though I am not myself), but truth is, people often go to dinner in groups, there is often at least one person who doesn't eat meat or seafood, or cheese, or anything that casts a shadow, so hey, I'm looking out for you.\n\nThere is an option for you folks, it is likely stir fried veggies, and based on the description from the server, not very inspiring. Anyway, our group all eats seafood, so we went that way. I was happy with, but not happy enough to rave about it - the meal was solidly good, and I would not hesitate to eat here again, but I won't go out of my way. One thing I can say, it is a far cry better than any of the seafood joints you would find along the pier.\n\nWe did manage to find a very good CA wine, and I am not a big fan of CA wines. And quite honestly the wine list is pretty darn good, if a little over priced for many of the selections.\n\nWhat really killed it for me was the service - just a little lackluster all around. We were there early, there were only a few tables seated, and the entire service staff just seemed to be waking up from an afternoon nap or a good puff. It was just attentive enough to avoid really downgrading the tip, but not interesting and caring enough to make the experience 'zing' - and it would have only taken just the smallest amount of additional care, and we would be looking at a 4, 4.5 star situation.\n\nI'll certainly give it another try, and hopefully bring this up to 4 stars (maybe more).

I mean, everything was decent, but nothing was really great. The gravalax starter I had was flavorful, but had a slightly off taste. I had the seared tuna as an entree, and the sauce was overpowered with too much vinegar.

Both owners stopped by our table and shared stories of their passion for food (particularly BBQ, who woulda thought?) It was evident why they own and run 3 restaurants. \n\nThe service was ok, not sure how much it was influenced by the owners stopping by. Love the way, they present the fresh bread. You're able to tear off a piece without spreading germs to your table mates. \n\nPrior to dinner, I ordered the scallop seviche. Being a seviche lover, I thought...\"how could I go wrong?\" Unfortunately, this dish was not for me. The scallops overpowered the remainder of the dish and tasted decidedly fishy. For dinner, I ordered the trout with rice and snap peas and was NOT disappointed. The maple/carmel (??) glaze was amazing and the blend of seasonings with the trout was delectable. The herbed ribbon fries were wonderfully lite and hard to stop eating. \n\nPortion sizes were perfect and the ambiance welcoming. Heads up....we were there on a Monday night around 6pm.

A guy who I would guess was maybe the head waiter (?) came over and welcomed us, and we ordered a bottle of Morgan chardonnay, fried clams and maple smoked trout salad to start, and mussel and monkfish stew and black bass with peaches and ramps for mains. \n\nTiming was great - wine came quickly, then starters just a few minutes later. Fried clams were *excellent*. I grew up eating fried clams on the beach in Maine as a little kid and I'd come back just for a basket of these things. The trout salad was nice, with bitter arugula and radicchio to contrast with the soft fish and little cubes of potato. There was supposed to be an anchovy dressing, but I don't remember tasting that. \n\nNice break before the entrees arrived - just long enough but not too long. My stew was pretty good, but I have to say the main ingredients - mussels and monkfish - didn't make the dish. The mussels were tiny, and monkfish is a bit strange... Luckily there was plenty of nice spicy chorizo and that flavored the broth well. I would have liked slightly larger mussels, different fish, and for the fish to have taken the flavor of the broth more. \n\nMy sister's entree looked beautiful - big pieces of sea bass with tiny early peaches and a bunch of sauteed ramps. Taste was good but not amazing. I case you haven't gathered yet, I like bright food with big, fresh, spicy flavors, so sometimes I find that lacking when someone else would a quieter dish. Sis liked the fish. \n\nWe split a shortbread biscuit with lots of berries and a little champagne cream - very nice finish and my kind of dessert. \n\nDid I mention expensive?? Oysters at $3 ea. is more than a bit steep. Even so, I really like the room, and I'd come back for more modest meal - beet salad and fried clams, fried clams, fried clams, for sure.", "author": "Bowen D."}

The tart Festina Peche resonated with the salsa and was like an extra squeeze of lemon on the delicate fish. \nAnchor & Hope, which opened in 2008, is the third restaurant by brothers Mitchell and Steven Rosenthal and their partner, Doug Washington, following Town Hall (2003) and Salt House (2006). Anchor & Hope is a popular destination for downtown office workers during lunch and dinner, and for its excellent happy hour specials, like a chef's selection of oysters for $1 each, fish tacos and shrimp fritters, as well as beer and wine specials.\nDespite the stainless steel that gives the restaurant an urban ambience, the bright room has a lot of warmth, which was enhanced by Tom McDermott playing New Orleans style on the piano that Anchor & Hope brought in for the occasion. McDermott was recently featured on HBO's post-Katrina series Treme.\nEnjoying the fish tacos with the fresh Festina Peche while listening to McDermott play Professor Longhair on the piano was like taking a mini vacation from bustling downtown San Francisco.

Nice when you have to get back to work.\n\nI had the Crab Louie.  It was described as coming with haricot vert, nicoise olives & butter lettuce in contrast to the Shrimp Louie I didn't get, which had the same description other than Arugula lettuce (vs butter).  The Louie arrives and here's what I got.  A small stack of Arugula dressed with a light vinaigrette, maybe 6 haricot vert and 2 teensy smashed pieces of a single nicoise olive.  One piece of butter lettuce with about a cup of crab sitting on it.  Next to that was a small container of a nice spicy thousand island-type dressing.  Oh, there was also one cherry tomato cut in half and a quail egg cut in half.  It was all ok but no way was the portion worth EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.\n\nOne companion is vegan and had the only vegetarian choice on the menu.  Chef's Delight was the name and it was a selection of roasted vegetables that were nicely prepared, but again, not a very large portion.

I'm not sure if they have it all the time though, it was on the chalkboard menu the night we went.\n\nThe oysters, both the fresh ones and the deep fried, were delightful, as was the lobster roll. The sea urchin was so-so. Great presentation with the shell, but I tasted more of the mashed potatoes than anything else. Nice wine list, friendly waitstaff.  Great, open loft-like space - they need AC in there though. Granted, we went during that crazy heat wave, a rarity in SF.

The menu was good, enough to choose from depending on your seafood preference. The beer menu was giant and was very extensive. Prices were high but that's what I expect when dinning downtown. For appetizer we got the bacon wrapped clams and they were okay. After we got our clams we got the surprise of getting homemade kettle chips with a salt and vinegar aioli sauce to dip. Very tasty, I could have eaten that all night. For my main I had the Ca Sea Bass which was perfect. No problems at all with that dish. My girlfriend got the cioppino soup and she loved it. The only thing she want more of was the bread, so that she could soak up every drop of the soup. Got the bill and it was expensive, but hey its seafood downtown.

The ambiance is definitely what you'd expect - casual and sophisitcated at the same time, warm and comfortable and not too loud. \n\nThe service was great. And here's a story to prove it: I ordered the wine for our table and then got through the tasting alright (I'm a lady and like the man at the table to do this kind of thing for me. Sorry Gloria Steinem.). The server poured our glasses and then set the bottle to my right. Because I'm a klutz., a very big klutz, I decided to move the bottle before I had a chance to spill it - and while I was moving the bottle, I spilt it all over myself. So embarrasing. But the staff descended upon me like a NASCAR team and in 10 seconds flat it was like it never happened. Kudos to them for being so efficient about everything.\n\nNow for the food - very salty and wasn't as good as I was expecting. I had the lobster roll.

He ordered the asparagus soup as a starter, which he said was incredible.  I and our other two friends ordered clam chowder which was the perfect thing for a windy cool night.  I loved the bread that came to the table, super-crusty and delicious with real butter.  I ordered the fish and chips - the portion was huge and a little greasier than expected, but the fish was breaded beautifully and the fries had a lovely thyme seasoning.  My husband ordered the seafood stew which he loved.  Our friends had the lobster roll which looked amazing and the halibut, which was a fairly modest portion compared to my fish and chips, but looked tasty.  The service was reasonably attentive and when the waitress forgot my soda and I asked about it, she brought it over and indicated that she wouldn't charge us for it, which was not necessary but I thought it was a very nice gesture that a less upscale place wouldn't have made.

We had a reservation on a Sunday night and were seated immediately at a wonderful table at the front next to the Window. The space is really impressive and pleasant. There are high ceilings, its bright and there is quite a bit of room in between tables. Its not like Town Hall where you can't hear your dinner guest speaking over the loud noise in a tightly packed room. \n\nUnfortunately, our food was just pretty good. I can't complain about anything specific, but, it was just a bit forgettable. I had their special for the evening which was a soft shell crab dish ($25) and my husband had the sea bass. Both of us enjoyed the meal, but, I probably wouldn't rush back. We also had a watercress salad with beets and hazelnuts ($11) and bread pudding w/ white peaches for dessert. Everything was just a little over average. \n\nThey had a nice beer selection though. We had Hoegarden which they had on tap, but, they also had a list of Belgians including Delirium, St. Bernard's and Duval. \n\nIt was pretty neat that you could order individual oysters and crab legs.

But, YOWIE!\nI could have eaten a trough of it. Plain and simple.\n\nThe sea urchin dish tied with my other favorite of the evening:\nThe Fried Ipswich Clams.\n\nThis appetizer made up for me the fact that this seafood based restaurant had NO FRIED CALAMARI!  Seriously, it SHOULD have a star missing for the lack of calamari goodness, but I regress...\n\nThe fried clams were divine, the tartar sauce was classic and complimented them well. I could almost close my eyes and pretend there were tentacles.\n\nThe service was pretty good, Host was great, Server was a little too attentive at the beginning and a little too much less-so when we wanted to get out of there and celebrate my birthday elsewhere.\n\nOverall though, if conditions are ideal: Anchor and Hope is a GREAT restuarant for getting together for some drinks and apps. + less costly than some of the other local restaurants of a similar caliber.\n\nI will try a full dinner sometime soon, but my over all point is:\n\nWith app.s like that? Who needs it!", "author": "TheJane N."}

The building itself is very nicely done, so great atmosphere - it was also hopping with people very late into the evening, so you would think it was a happening spot - also casual, so you didn't feel out of place in jeans and a sweater.  Our server was very nice and wasn't on top of us all night, but checked in enough that he also wasn't a distraction.  The food - Both the guests had the salad (without avacado) and they said it was pretty salty.  I had the clam chowder and it was also salty, so mabye a note to the chef - lay off the salt a bit - if I want salt I'll add it.  For entree I had the Halibut, it was grilled nicely and served on a balsamic reduction and garlic mashed potatoes - very tasty.  One of the guests had the gnocchi, which the portion was on the small side for the price.  Decent selection of tap beers - I had the Russian River Brewing Company draft - nice pairing with the meal - just a hint of something sweet in the blend.  We shared the pumpkin/gingerbread dessert item - that was really quite good with a mix of cake and ice cream - enough for two.  Might give them a chance again, but lots of other places to explore in the city, so it'll likely be on the back burner.", "author": "Steve A."}

Started with a drink at the bar and were brought to our table in a very timely manner - good selection of beers and wines  - but no real bar so no cocktails. Had an attentive waitress who had good suggestions. The food began to come and didn't stop for a while. We ordered a few of each oyster (compliments of dad who loves oysters). Then a few rounds of the asparagus salad. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night which is odd because i rarely enjoy asparagus and am only so-so on eggs and this had both of them. A fried egg topped the perfectly heated asparagus along with a light sauce and cheese. It was a wonderful blend of veggie flavor with creamy saucey goodness. The fresh bread as yummy and I always love when a restaurant has salt to drizzle on the butttered bread, they had this so that made me smile. We also ordered the angels on horseback to check off a list item. Again, they managed to make me like something I normally don't like! I am an avid non-bacon eater. I mean, if i even taste or smell the hint of bacon it turns me off of my meal. But because of my obsession I decided I'd have to suck it up and give it a taste at least. Well, I was pleasantly surprised, they were actually good. I stuck to my one bit - but the fact that it didn't make me scrunch up my face and wish I hadn't even had the bite is huge. So for all you normal people that love bacon, you'll love this, a lot, everyone else at the table did.  \nFor our main course we had the following:\nLobster roll - good but don't get this for dinner, it's a downer. But for lunch awesome. \nSteak - Great, perfectly cooked, juicy and flavorful\nHalibut - delicious and fresh\nScallops and couscous - very good\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone looking for some yummy yummy seafood.

The water was poured and then a bottle was left on the table- which i very much appreciated.  The waiter gave an overview of his favorites for everything. Overall good service. \n\nFood-we ordered an assortment of starters- fries with eyes),  Angels on Horseback, scallop ceviche (I liked this), the sea urchin, crab, mashed potato mix- the best app in my book- and heirloom tomato salad.  The bread was served in a brown bag- kind of weird, but tasted good/fresh and had salted butter on the table.  \n\nOn to the mains- i had the curry sole- which was good- the other two mains my table tried were enjoy- i'm blanking on what one of them was, but the other was a tuna.  The selection was pretty good- there were several other fish dishes I was deciding between- so that is always a good thing.\n\nDessert- this may have been a half disappointment- there were only two choice- luckily for them both of them were very enjoyable- chocolate cake with chocolate pudding filling was good- but the heart of sweet cream was really good- i hope the next time i come they have expanded this selection...\n\nDrinks: I had a glass of sonoma sauvignon blanc- it was good.  They had a nice selection of wines- almost all came by the glass which was a nice surprise.  They also have a pretty good beer selection.  I didn't see any cocktails.\n\nVegetarian selection- i only remember the heirloom tomato salad-which i had and would say is average- and the 'chefs special'- which you will have to look at other reviews for because with all the fish on the menu i will not be trying it. I guess you shouldn't be expecting veggies at a fish place- but this is sf so i thought i'd comment and I'm find myself looking for veggie/vegan reviews when i have veggies coming out with me.\n\nAmbiance- the chairs are oddly light and seem like they have been spray painted their silver color.  The boat/fishing theme is there classed up a little, but didn't feel as fancy as salt house or town hall.  Try to get a table along the wall or the five seater in the alcover if you don't want some traffic around you.  The noise level was relatively low for sf.  The bathrooms were nothing special either- i always love to be surprise with a nice bathroom like umami- i'll have to keep looking.\n\nEven though none of the parts were amazing the overall experience was really nice and I will likely come back if i need a work dinner location that is close to the office.", "author": "Maria F."}

And, because they are in my neighborhood, I tend to eat here at least twice a week.\n\nFoodwise - the fish and chips is delicious because it so light and perfectly crispy.  The chowder is divine because it's not a brick of cream in your stomach and the corn kernels are sweet crisp nuggets.  The oysters are delicious and the servers are great at describing the flavors and making suggestions.  The salmon gravlax is very well done, it's rich tasting but not overpoweringly fishy.  The fish stew is tasty but I would have preferred it to be spicier.  The sea urchin appetizer is worth a taste because it's a fun way to present it and keep the briny taste of the sea urchin to a minimum.  \n\nDesserts - the sweet cream heart is refreshing and light, the chocolate cake has an amazing top layer of salt, chocolate, and nuts and the meyer lemon tart is tangy without being bitter.\n\nAmbiance - there's a lot of energy and chatter in the room but it is not overwhelming.  The crowd is varied in terms of suits to jeans and a variety of ages.  \n\nThe team - this staff is fabulous!!!  The servers are knowledgeable and easy going.  Chad is a riot!!  Brady does a great job making things happen.\n\nAn update from last night's dinner on 8/19:  The trout salad is perfect in it's salty goodness.

Brick walls and an space make for lots of bouncing sound. But it gives the restaurant a certain energy at the same time.\n\nI didn't have any oysters from the raw bar, (I'm apparently spoiled and had some at home before going to dinner), but I noted they had Kumamotos, Miyagis, Kusshis, Beau Soleils, Malpaques, and Island Creeks. I'm an aficionado, but I was trying to save room for the...\n\nAngels on Horseback (a.k.a. Bacon-wrapped oysters):\nWhat can I say? Wrapping food in bacon is cheating. It automatically wins +1000 points. Especially when aforesaid bacon is wrapped around one of my other favorite foods (goodness, could you imagine bacon-wrapped foie gras? I would die. I bet someone has done it. If you know where to get this, let me know!!). So how were they? In all honesty, I don't know if they lived up to the hype. Perhaps it's because I'm more of a fan of raw oysters. And I also probably had built them up in my head, so really, maybe it's my fault. However, I will say, I admired the textural contrast between the soft, delicate oyster and the crisp bacon (well, the parts that were crisp, anyway). And these things looked like a pain to make. I asked our server what varietal the oysters were and she said that they are made with Blue Points. I noted that the shells looked more like Miyagi's, and she said that they do use a variety of shells, but that the oysters were always Blue Points. Interesting. But believable. Blue points are generally less expensive too, I think. I thought the remoulade was a bit flat, but adding a squeeze of lemon really brightened the flavor.\n\nHoney Mustard Trout: Wow. What an interesting combination of flavors! Admittedly, on my first bite, I was a bit overwhelmed by the mustard (I apparently am terrible at reading and retaining--the mustard was totally unexpected). However, the flavors really melded well together upon further....mastication. And the trout was cooked perfectly, with a bit of dill weed and lemon peel in the center cavity, which infused every bite with a subtle flavor. Very impressive. However, I was not as impressed with the bed o' pinto beans. The flavor was okay (as in, it didn't do it for me, but I also was not revolted by it) and improved slightly when combined with the watercress (I thought the watercress should have been wilted a bit, but then realized they are relying on the fish's heat to wilt it--with mixed results), but it's really hard to get the texture of beans \"just right,\" as there's a thin line between that and mushy. I also think \"just right\" can be pretty subjective; I think these were just too underdone for my taste.\n\nPetrale Sole: Again, a really interesting combination of flavors. The sole was fine, but the smokiness of the tomatoes really penetrated the fish and added a lot of complexity. I will say, some tasted like roasted red peppers, which was too overpowering. Those potatoes though! I can't say that I've had smoky potatoes, but these were fascinating (in a really good way)! Very enjoyable.\n\nI was pretty impressed by the beer list (lots of bottles, but on the pricier side).\n\nService was a mixed bag. It took ages for our server to take our drink order (in fact, I was ready to order my entree by this time, and that NEVER happens). During dinner, the service was good...and then tapered off again.\n\nOne thing that I noted: They serve bread in a paper bag. I personally think this is just trying too hard. It's kinda tacky, actually (think, \"this is how I buy it in the supermarket!\"). And it's a waste of a bag.\n\nOverall, I admire the creativity of the dishes.

In my last visit we decided to try an item from the full menu. We ordered the \"signature dish\", warm sea urchin with dungenous crab and lemon. I've never had sea urchin before but I was definitely up for the challenge. I made the mistake of gathering a huge spoonful and stuffing it in my mouth. The taste was different, still not sure how I feel about it to this day. I think I'm willing to try it three or four more times to fully understand it, and I'm sure it would help trying it prepared differently in the future. But aside from the sea urchin, the crab was amazing. It was drenched in a chowder of lemony butter and potato puree. Every bite melted in my mouth and it was so full of flavor. There was a fresh herb, possibly dill, that gave the dish a really great organic aftertaste. I tried to incorporate sea urchin to each bite once I built up the courage, and together it was amazingly delicious.", "author": "MaryAnn C."}

Their pride and joy appears to be their beer selection, which is impressive, but they seem awfully eager to cater also to the wine crowd as well.  They offer lobster roll and a fancified fish & chips alongside \"cornmeal crusted slow baked loch duart salmon\" served with \"heirloom beets\" and a \"red wind reduction\" and \"spice crusted sea scallops with Israeli cous cous ...\"  They serve bread in a brown bag, but their butter softened in a white ceramic container and topped with sea salt.  They claim to be a fish house, but they have almost as many meat entrees, which from the looks of the short ribs at the next table, would have been a better choice than our fish entrees.  It feels like it should be a casual place, but most people were dressed quite nicely (men in suits, ladies in dresses, skirts, slacks).\n\nWe were not so thrilled with the food.  Apart from the recommended Angels on Horseback, which I hated (apparently not even bacon can make me a lover of cooked oyster), nothing was particularly bad.  For the prices they charge, however, things should be at least a noncommittal \"good,\" and they weren't even that.  The clam chowder wasn't simmered long enough for all of the ingredients to meld, which was fine, but not good.  The salmon tasted fine, the beets on that plate were fine, but again, none of it affirmatively good.  The battered cod was the only dish that I actually enjoyed, but it still would not make my top three.\n\nEven the decor is a bit disjointed.  The bar is appealing in a clean, sophisticated way, as are the tuna fish patter along the wall behind the bar and the light fixtures throughout the restaurant, in a whimsical sense.  But then you have the exposed brick and unfinished ceiling beams with thick, rough rope draped around it.  I get that it's all with an eye toward a deep sea/nautical theme.  It just seems a little undecided.\n\nGiven my lukewarm impression of the whole experience, this would have been a 2-star review, except that the restaurant was packed with well-dressed familes and co-workers that seemed to appreciate and enjoy the place in all its schizo-glory, starting with beer and apps (salad, or maybe clams over squid ink risotto (sounds better than it tastes), or a tray of oysters), and moving on to wine and entrees. It was bustling, others seemed happy with their meals, and by the time we were leaving, there was a bit of a wait.  It got me thinking maybe we just did this all wrong - ordered the wrong food, had the wrong expectations.  I probably won't be back to confirm either way, but it seemed enough to tack a star back on.\n\nPros:  Beer, including beer flights; nice atmosphere and crowd; friendly waitstaff; substantial and aesthetically pleasing bar area\n\nCons:  Mediocre food on average (not very high highlights and some very bad lowlights); uncomfortable chairs", "author": "Alice C."}

The other two being phenomenal!  We walked in, the ambiance seemed lovely, open, loud, great! Loved the Devore and the details (ropes from e ceiling, writing in the light bulbs, etc.  Alas, that's where the wow ended. \nWe had to wait forever for the waiter (I don't want to name names, but i do remember who hi was) to come and take our drink order. Then, finally when he came to take our drink order we were ready to place our food ordr, but he left to place our drink order and took forever coming back to take our food and didn't even have our drinks ready! We ordered the octopus appetizer. He did warn about e smokey flavor, but it was WAAAY too smokey. Overwhelmingly smokey. They for our main dishes my husband ordered the lobster roll which we both liked a lot, the challah was great, and I ordered the soft shell crab/prosciutto sandwich. We waiting awhile for our main dish and when it came I looked at the side and it was something breaded. I lifted up the bread on top and it was breaded fried shrimp, rather than soft shell crab. Our waiter was nowhere to be found, so I asked another waitress, talking to her customers two tables away if the sandwich was supposed to have soft shell crab and not shrimp. She said yes, but that they had run out if the crab. Out waiter never told me that. I would have ordered something else had I known that. Finally, our waiter came over and I told him that I got shrimp. He said that e kitchen told him that they had one sandwich left and he was sorry. Offered tomhave them make something else, but we had waited SOOO long already, I didn't have time to wait for my mnext meal. Needless to say it was SUPER spacey, flavorless and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I had e most sour flavor in my mouth at this point and it turned even worse when he LEFT THE ITEM on our bill!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-06-09", "description": "After anxiously awaiting my first dining experience at the much hyped Anchor and Hope, I left disappointed.  The ambiance is nice, yes.  I can tell they put a lot of effort into the design.  And, the location is great, too...half a block away from my place of work.  But, other than that...the menu is mediocre and the best thing I had was the bread and butter.  And make note: its a beer and wine only bar...poo. \n\nWe ordered the angels on horseback (fried, bacon wrapped oysters), the fries with eyes, the warm sea urchin in the shell, the black sea bass and the lobster roll.  Out of all these, I'd say the sea urchin was the only thing that I \"mmm'ed\" about.  Everything else was disappointing.  And, I feel like the only reason I liked the sea urchin was because it was mostly buttery mashed potatoes. The fries with eyes are not as scary as they sound...but I'd pick a fried fish filet over those any day.\n\nOur entrees were the most disappointing.  I had never had a lobster roll before, and if this lobster roll is representative of what a lobster roll should taste like, then I would say that lobster rolls are completely over-rated.  Anchor and Hope's lobster roll was bland, unexciting and I felt like the lobster was undercooked.  The lobster meat was too soft and somewhat slimy.  And, it was basically just lobster, mayonnaise and some parsley.  Very under seasoned.  And, it was difficult to eat by hand...just skip taking a bite out of it and use your utensils to avoid a huge mess.  The sea bass was equally unexciting. The best thing about it were the stewed peaches...other than that there were no exciting flavors...very bland and forgettable.\n\nThere are two other issues that need to be addressed.  The first, and most important, is the seating issue we had.  The place was nearly empty, on a Sunday night.  We were seated at a table along the wall on the right, where there were about 10 tables lined up, none of which were occupied.  About 15 minutes after we were seated, the hostess seats another couple at the table immediately next to us-instead of choosing one of the other 15 open tables.  Why would you seat the table next to us (I'm talking 1 foot away), when you have SO MANY other open tables available?  It was cramped, and we felt like we were basically having dinner with this other couple, listening to each other's conversation with no privacy.  It  ruined the ambiance of our meal.  Terrible seating choice by the hostess- it really impacted my experience. Taking away 1 star for that blunder.  Second issue: watch out for the splinters on the bench seating along the wall.  We were picking out splinters from our clothes and/or skin for an hour after sitting on the bench seating.  And ladies: if you're wearing tights, ask to be seated in a chair to avoid ruining your stockings.\n\nAll in all:  'aint nothin' to write home about.

Anchor and Hope kept that mood going with their great service, food and ambiance though.\nScott, Danny, Natalie and I dined here last weekend after our event at the Ferry Building concluded. We snagged a reservation pretty quickly just prior to getting there and were lucky enough to find parking right in front on the street. Our waitress was incredibly knowledgeable and personable from the start. We went with 1/2 dozen Malbec and a 1/2 dozen of another kind of oyster I've forgotten, the bay shrimp ceviche and the Angels on Horseback (aka bacon wrapped oysters) for our starters. The oysters were fabulously fresh and the Angels on Horseback were pretty great too. The ceviche was just okay for me but I'm not a fan of shrimp ceviche.\nFor the main course I went with the Petrale Sole and I was skeptical of it's curry sauce in the menu description but fell in love at first bite. Simply delicious and a whole new take on a favorite fish of mine. Natalie had the mussels and Scott the ahi tuna while Danny joined me on the sole side of things. I think we had the best main entrees. It was all accompanied by about a bottle and a half of a great white wine whose name escapes me. Dessert found us sharing the apple pie with hazelnut ice cream and the cheese plate. Loved the cheese plate but honestly the apple pie wasn't that remarkable and we only got it because Danny was amused at the \"warm apple pie\" description by our waitress and how it reminded him of that scene in \"American Pie\". \nYeah, he's kind of an ass like that.", "author": "Jill D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-05-11", "description": "Let me set up the situation. I came on a Saturday night with my sister and and her husband. We were eating on the later end (around 9) and went in without a reservation. The hostess offered us bar seating but then said she had a table leaving and just had to re-set the table. Somehow, resetting the table took about 20 minutes. The decor/ambiance is definitely cute - minimalist/nautical. The bartender was friendly and walked us through the beer selection while we waited. \n\nOnce seated, I found our waitress to be on the aloof side, never coming by to see if we needed anything after we were served. Don't get me wrong, I don't need someone asking me how everything is every 10 minutes, but its helpful for a waiter to stroll by, catch someone's eye from the table and give them the opportunity to call him/her over if they need something. Between our appetizers and entrees, the wait was inordinately long.\n\nNow about the food. \n\nI agree with a previous reviewer that the bread arriving in a bag evoked an expectation of just-out-of-the-oven-hot. It was not. I would suggest that the restaurant then do away with the wasteful bags and serve the bread in some other re-usable vessel that is appropriate to the decor. The bread itself was only ok. \n\nOur group had 2 of the soups to start: clam chowder and what I think was a special soup with ramp. The ramp soup was very good, but the clam chowder flavor was overpowered by the bacon. Being a bacon fan, this is not such a bad thing, but when you are in the mood for the flavors of a good clam chowder, this soup does not deliver.\n\nFor entrees, we had 2 orders of the scallops with Israeli couscous, the chorizo and mussel stew, and a side of the broccoli raab. The scallops were delicious and the brccoli raab perfectly cooked. The stew was good as well, but had a questionable consistency to the chorizo meatballs. We asked the waitress if the meatballs were thoroughly cooked and she took the whole dish back to the kitchen to ask. Upon her return, she was suddenly the expert on the preparation and meat quality of chorizo. She said that the texture of the meat and its ability to retain moisture was why the meatballs were still seemingly raw and assured us that they were fully cooked. After dinner, I told her that our family uses chorizo regularly and that is the first time I had heard of the reasoning she gave us, but we let it go. \n\nFor dessert, we tried the Bailey's milkshake and the chocolate cake. Both very good although the milkshake was more original. The oatmeal cookies that came with the milkshake seemed like an afterthought.\n\nNow for my favorite part: the cost vs. product quality. I understand that ambiance is very important in a dining experience, but I think restaurants in the city lean too heavily on that when it comes to pricing. Just because there are clean lines to the furniture, whacky light fixtures, and the building used to be a garage/firehouse/what-have-you, it doesn't mean that the food price qualifies for a major bump up. Food quality and service are what should be the main factor. The service here left much to be desired. It is the food quality that helps give my rating a solid 3. There's something about the menu options that bothers me but I haven't been able to zero in on it. As I said, just a solid 3 stars. It's definitely on the over-priced side.", "author": "Maria Y."}

The complimentary potato chips were greasy and cold and not crispy at all.  I ordered the fish and chips and my guest ordered one glass of wine and the steak.  The steak portion was extremely small for the price ($29).  3/4 of the plate was covered by cheap bibb lettuce and a very weak vinaigarette dressing and some very greasy onion rings.  The fish and chips ($24) looked appetizng, but the coating was not crispy at all and the meager amount of fries included with the dish were not enough to keep the grease from forming on the bottom of the plate.

I've hit it for a night with the girls, and two business dinners.  The ambiance is perfect for both, since the food, although casually presented, is very, very good and attention to detail is very cool -- and the laid back vibe of the place fits many bills.  The first two times I went I thought the service was bumpy, but it improved from second to third so dramatically I think they are kind of figuring it out.  The wine list is just killer - love that almost everything is done by the glass - and unusual and the staff seems knowledgeable about it all. The ambiance is great too, although keep in mind that it is a high-ceilinged loft, so it is LOUD until quite late, but the airy feel and the decor is just right for the food's presentation.\nI love, love, loved the sea urchin appetizer - you need to try it to understand it but it is fantastic as was the \"Angels on Horseback\".  I also liked everything from the raw bar to the trout salad and the other salads we shared.  The lobster roll is magical. I thought the special seabass I had was fantastic, but another entree, the monkfish and mussel stew was really not good at all- a step below mediocre and oddly stood out from everything else there that was great - it was flavorless and dull where it should have been rich tomato-y and spicy;  a discordant misstep in an otherwise good menu.  Anyway, desserts were terrific too.\n\nGo if you want a non-stuffy, not quiet place for dinner or want a late night alternative to a bar where you can snack and share and indulge in seriously great wine (and beer list is excellent too).  Doug Washington has prowled the place each night I was there and his attention to customer service is just phenomenal - the kind of restaurant proprietor you wish there were a thousand of when paying your hard earned money for a meal....", "author": "Kirsten M."}

I think, though, the secret may already be out.\n\nThe about page on the site [http://anchorandhopesf.com/about.html] does a good job of succinctly evoking an accurate image of the restaurant's character, both in ambiance and cuisine. What's not captured in that description is that the menu, which includes familiar items like oysters on the half shell, stuffed clams, and lobster rolls, offers some more gastro-provocative fare than what the conventional mind might readily imagine, such as the warm sea urchin appetizer served in its spiny shell and the decadent lobster-stuffed-with-lobster entree with a horseradish bearnaise.\n\nThe sea urchin appetizer, which even tantalized the shellfish-allergic at my table, seems poised to become a signature must-try item, and the Portuguese clam-style stew featuring octopus, chorizo, and monkfish in a spicy broth was exceptional, although I will say that I had to wait for the stew to drop about ten degrees in temperature before its flavors registered in full. I tried a bite of the stuffed guinea hen breast, and it, too, was pretty amazing.\n\nFrom soup to nuts, the service was top-notch. The host was exceedingly nice -- perhaps he was the general manager? -- seating us promptly but also checking in on us throughout our meal and attending to us in conjunction with our server, who was uncommonly attentive, engaged, and knowledgeable in her own right.", "author": "Eugene P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-13", "description": "My first (but not last) review of a San Francisco establishment!  On a recent business trip to San Francisco, I asked a San Francisco business associate for his favorite restaurant and he named Town Hall and Anchor & Hope. He was pretty unwavering on these choices, so I thought I would check it out.  A colleague and I went to Town Hall first and looked at the menu.  The menu and atmosphere were fantastic, but my colleague was in the mood for seafood, so we took a short walk to their sister restaurant Anchor & Hope.\n\nThe restaurant itself is in an incredible setting: a historic garage that was converted into the restaurant with exposed brick and wood beams and the decor was incredible as well, elegant in a casual way.\n\nNow let me start off by saying that I am a vegetarian, but I am still also a foodie and primarily go to non-veggie restaurants because I love the  different cooking styles of really great chefs.  That being said, I couldn't make up my mind between the Tarragon Marinated Baby Beet Salad w/ Aged Parmesan, Watercress and Salted Pistachios and the Little Gem and Cucumber Salad w/ Buttermilk Dressing and Chopped Dill.  So, I ordered them both :)  They were both incredible: extreme fresh ingredients, beautiful seasoning and the dressings were incredible (the beet salad had an amazing dressing with horseradish in it).  My colleague ordered 2 appetizers as well: starting with a mixed plate of oysters and a dish called I believe Angels on Horseback? (oysters wrapped in bacon).  My colleague is from New England and is well versed in seafood and the only silence I got from him was while he was devouring these dishes.  After of course the silence was broken by his raving about not having had oysters that good in like forever.\n\nNow for the main course!!  We came to this restaurant because my colleague wanted seafood, but after seeing another table's meal, he ordered their Hanger Steak.  Again, he raved about the quality of the beef, the seasoning and that it was cooked to perfection.  As for me, when the server discovered that I was vegetarian, she offered me a vegetarian dish that was not on the menu, but sounded delectable.  However, I had already set my heart on some of the side dishes.  So I ordered the sauteed Brussels Sprouts, the Broccoli Raab and an order of Fries.  I was in heaven.  Like everything else, everything was extreme fresh, not overcooked and seasoned brilliantly!!  I was truly a happy camper.\n\nWe finished the meal by splitting the Chocolate BlackOut Cake w/ Salted Almond Walnut Brittle.  It was packed full of flavor without being overly sweet and just hit the spot.\n\nI will also mention that the wine list is great. And as for the staff, everyone from the maitre d' to the server were extremely friendly, accommodating and attentive!!!  All in all, we had a wonderful experience.\n\nNot only will I return (next time I want to try their vegetarian offering), but I am dying to try their sister restaurants Salt House and Town Hall.  I actually will be in SF again in 1 week and already plan on dining at Town Hall!!!  Hats off to the owners and chef!!!", "author": "Mdivani M."}

Top it off with a couple of his friends and we were a veritable scene.  I note that the 7:30p dinner crowd was markedly suit-ed, as it is the financial and Soma districts watering hole for those who don't beat the commute.  The crowd wasn't that enthralling, nor was it much of a scene.  I like to people watch, but at least it wasn't stifling.  I am sure we were the most garish people in there.  Waiting for the rest of our party we saddled up to the bar and ordered a bottle of VERY good, VERY reasonable champagne (of which I am escaping and actually *know*... server said it was best on the menu and last bottle so I was proud of it enough to let it get me inebriated enough to... totally.. forget... what it was).  We had the rest of the party arrive and got to our table, but not until after we see two separate tables have customers go belly up on the light, aluminium chairs that were on the slick service floors.  \n\nBy the end of the night, patient reader, THREE total chairs had hit the ground... and it wasn't until my female compatriot deferred to the other chair flippers that we realized it wasn't due to inebriants greasing the balance of the consumer... but rather the floor and chair connection being poor, at best.\n\nHowever, this really was our only complaint.  The food was amazing.  The Snapper was full head on delicious, my fish and chips (of which I am a dorky connoisseur)  were some of the best I have ever had in my entire life.  The batter was superb.  The fish perfect.  The service was awesome, and the cute blue eyed bartender graciously flirted with my man lover friend.\n\nIn the end, after two more bottles of wine, 5 entrees, and some dessert... the bill came out to a bit more than a \"casual night out with a couple friends\".  Actually... doing the math now of picking up two meals, plus the birthday boy.... it really was fair, but I ended up dropping much more than I am normally comfy with and walked away consumed by the cost.\n\nIn retrospect, that is my fault, not there facility's.

I'm fairly certain that loosely translates to a fresh tortellini in some sort of brown butter or cream sauce with French beans, carrots (the fancy kind with the little green tops still on), and mushrooms (unidentifiable because I don't really like mushrooms). When butternut squash is out of season, the tortellini is ricotta, tomato, and basil in a heavy, buttery, flavorful cream sauce. Too often restaurants let cream take center stage in a sauce like this. It was really refreshing to enjoy a cream sauce with some spices, caramely onions, and mmm mmm goodness. Needless to say, I was not forced to choose a fish option. In fact, none of the non-veggie options were even the least bit tempting.

I had not been in a couple of years, and although it was good, it was not nearly as good as I remembered.  I was put off a little bit when we arrived.  I was eating with a friend of mine who works at a nearby hotel and sends lots of his guests to Anchor and Hope.  He had made the reservation, and when we arrived the manager was at the front desk.  We gave our name for the reservation and the manager was kind of rude and looked down the list and said he did not see the name, he kept repeating the name over and over and sort of mumbled no reservation.  At that point the hostess came over and she recognized my friend, and she was super friendly and sweet.  We were seated and ordered.  They have a great beer selection.  Our waiter was very friendly, but the service was off a bit .  For instance they brought our first course before the drinks(but they were all so nice it did not detract from the meal).\nWe started with oysters which were very good, then we had a shrimp ceviche which was excellent.  We also had an octopus with ham hocks and frisee.  The octopus was a little soft and not that flavorful, and the portion of seafood was very small.\nFor main courses we had Monk Fish in a curry sauce that was pretty good, but it was overly salty, but tasty.  We also had the salmon which was very well prepared.\nThe place has a fun vibe to it, and although it is expensive, it is totally unpretentious.  I think I was most bothered that the manager never even came over and said hello to my friend after being rude to us.  If I was rude to someone who was consistently sending customers to my business I would make sure to have at least come over and checked on his dinner.

Also, the curry wasn't quite curry-like...it was more of a broth, which would be ok if they described it better on the menu.  So yes, I was very disappointed but the other dishes were quite good.

How about a dessert menu? It was my birthday, after all, and I wanted dessert. My husband said maybe we should skip it. Nope. I wanted dessert.

They didn't  make us wait to set up the table or anything. Our server was really polite and patient as we had so many people. \nI tried most things on the menu but my favorites were the sea urchin, the ceviche and lobster roll!  The sea urchin looked amazing, as it came in its shell and I loved how the uni was blended with some lobster. The lobster roll did not have a lot of mayonnaise, and the meat was very succulent. \nFor dessert the we ordered the chocolate cake and the goat cheese cheese cake. Chocolate cake was moist but VERY rich. I actually enjoyed the goat cheese cheese cake, as it was not as heavy as cheese cake made of cow's milk. \nIt's definately not a place to come if you are dieting because you would want to eat everything!", "author": "Benny S."}

The salad came deconstructed which drives me nuts and (this is totally my fault for not realizing this) the dressing was 1000 island which I don't enjoy. I was doomed from the start. That being said, the shrimp while unseasoned, were fresh, tender, and downright yummy. I can't really give them less than 3 stars because I made a bad choice and from a technical aspect they lived up to their end of the bargain.

I went with a group of four friends and we all dug the look of the restaurant. A&H took the place of an old auto mechanic shop and is on a side street off of Second Street. From the outside it looks like something out of a Jim Burton movie, slightly creepy and intriguing with a hint of potential for fun. \nThe hostess is a real cutie but I wasn't particularly happy with where she seated us. We have a reservation and yet we ended up at a table literally right next to the door. Fortunately the weather was mild the opening and closing of the door didn't bother us. What was weird was the acoustics in the restaurant. Not only is it really loud (the ceilings are really high) but it seemed like no matter how loudly we spoke it was hard to hear. I compared it to talking into a pillow. Apparently, if you sit against a wall you can hear better.\nI'm not a big seafood fan but I figured I'd try something new. If you like oysters, this is the place for you. They've got a nice selection of west coast and east coast oysters, they had six types of oysters. The menu changes everyday so the variety will likely change. The love boat and tug boat oyster appetizers are basically samplers with various seafood salad sides; they sounded good but what you were actually going to get was kind of confusing. We ended up getting the urchin, angels on horseback and bacon appetizers. The urchin was the best followed by the angels and horseback. I ordered the cod entree which was essentially fish and chips. It was good, not oily but the chips were slightly under cooked. I would suggest getting something more exotic. \nFor dessert we got the chocolate cake. It was very good albeit slightly small. \nOverall, it was a decent seafood meal in a unique setting. I'd go back for the oysters or lunch.", "author": "Richard S."}

A well-heeled modern take on a casual seafood shack. The only problem is that the food and prices don't really follow through on that premise. I wanted to like it I really did, but I should have known when we got there for happy hour and it was dead. Note to Managers: PUT ON SOME HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS! You might think - \"We're too nice a place for something trashy like that. We did Salt House and Town Hall!\" But hey Bacar has them and they manage to fill up with people who are there for Happy Hour and Dinner Service. I just find it a shame that this could have been a really great place to go to for a casual but well executed seafood shack in the FiDi. This week we go to the place next door which was jumping by the time we left the still empty Anchor & Hope.\n\n2.5 stars for the food. Had Angels on Horseback - meh I think I'm a fresh oyster gal. My companions had the scallop ceviche and an order of the crab claws. Again meh - too much scallop (what? how is that possible?) Ok, maybe it's more accurate to say, not enough everything else. The bits of jalapeno were nice, but other than that the flavors just weren't there. I like to really taste the lime, vinegar, onion etc. instead I just tasted the scallop. The crab claw was ridiculous for $4 a piece, they each had about a tablespoon worth of meat to them. Ironically I have to echo other yelpers in saying the free bread and salty butter were highlights of the time we were there. The olives were also good. The only thing that managed to get an ooo out of us was the dessert (!) The unassuming chocolate cake was really tasty. Simple flavors that popped off the plate. The frosting had a saltiness that was tasty playing off the not too overwhelmingly chocolatey chocolate cake.\n\n5 stars for service. The staff really tried to be welcoming and friendly and we could only sheepishly smile at each other when she would ask how things were, to which we would do our best to say \"great\", but we both knew that it was not so much.\n\nMaybe this place just needs to rethink who it is.

Not bad...Sitting around, no one comes by...Finally our waitress shows up and looks like she'd rather be yanking her fingernails out than working. \"ready to order\" yes, just like that - not, do you have questions, how are you. My friend asked if she could tell us about the menu and she goes \"well there is really not much to say\"... Kid you not! Anyhow, she recommended some things lack luster, we ordered 2 appetizers and asked she come back for our main course. She walk away, never asks if we want anything to drink. Anyway, another waitress brought over the app, just one... we ate it. No one comes by to check in, ask if we want any wine. \"Happy\" walks by and avoids any eye contact. I had to actually waive her down and ask for an order of wine. Mind you this girl is pretty much MIA the whole night. She came back with the wine and took for our main order. We're sitting around and our main course comes. No second app!!! So we ask the other waitstaff who brought us our food where our appetizer is. They had no idea, and we just asked them to cancel. Mind you Waitress of the Year doesn't bother to come by and apologize for screwing up, or simply acknowledge us. Just being a raging bitch all around. \n\nAnyway, the food was ok. The Angels were not bad. I had the salmon and it was pretty bland with a sorta decent sauce and a blob of pure. I've made better at home. My friend said her paella was pretty good. The fish and chips were alright as well, but nothing to throw $26 at. \"Happy\"  came back and got our desert order. Again, decent but nothing to get excited about. Check came or should I say - she threw it at our table, no apology for screwing up. An anchor came with the check and I was tempted to chuck it at her head. Honesty we're not high maintenance. So long as someone acts like a human being, we're happy. And we were being nice to her the whole night despite her shitty attitude and service. But that was just a crappy experience.

The chips were good, but my co-worker's substituted fried looked much better.  The waiter took forever to take our orders, and not all the food arrived at the same time - a little awkward when you're politely waiting for everyone to be served before you start eating.  However, the servers were great at refilling the water glasses.  The ambiance was fun, an urban take on the nautical theme.  The location was odd, off a side street by itself.  I'm not planning on going back unless someone else is paying and I'd get the burger which looked really great.", "author": "Erin L."}

I think the only other thing that prevented me giving it four stars was the price. Although the food was good and it was good quality it seemed a tad overpriced. For appetizers you can't go wrong with the raw bar, but the sea urchin appetizer was fantastic as well. For entrees the fish and chips were good and the lobster roll was nice. Dessert were ok.

Greeted by a somewhat vacant hostess and shown to our table. I really like the interior decoration, contemporary feel with a nice used edge. Love the big fish eat little fish mural above the bar. Ok, so to the food and drink. To start we shared the artichoke crusted with cornmeal and shrimp fritters, well presented and very fresh, but bland (for me), that's because I didn't like the dipping sauces they came with. Main course, the cod and herbed fries were absolutely outstanding, Tuna was great and the trout delicious. Now to the beverages. This place has an incredible collection of ever changing world class beers that is hard to match in San Francisco, expensive, why of course yes, $20+ for a bottle? You bet sir! But hey, it's a beers drinkers heaven make no mistake, couple that with the solid food and it makes for a great dinning experience. Did I mention the service? Well it was OK, not great, just OK. Our waiter decided that after 45 mins of floor time it was time for his break, in the middle of our meal. Another waitress took over, but only because we asked for service.", "author": "Kevin S."}

We were brought here after reading about the warmed Uni appetizer. It did not disappoint and neither did the other dishes we had. The Uni dish even inspired us to re-name our new dog.Their are few places I give 5 stars, but A&H gets it not only for their great food, but for their EXTREMELY courteous and friendly staff. Our waiter was completely understanding of our need to speed things along. He was very quick to exchange our empty beer/wine glasses (it was happy hour). Our son is frequently throwing things down on the ground and every staff member that walked by was happy to pick anything up and hand it back to him. They also get bonus points for having a mermaid logo. I look forward to dining here again and maybe next time we can get a sitter and stay a little longer. =)", "author": "O Ommmm O."}

The space of the restaurant made me feel like I was in a small intimate clam-bake back east. Decor was simple but still very fresh...candles lit every where with white roses as their standard flower centerpiece...i didn't feel like i was in SOMA of San Francisco...had a good East Coast feeling to it.\nSince A & H didn't have their liquor license just yet, we were told that we could bring our own wine and wouldn't be charged a corkage fee...SWEET.  Our waiter was extremely cute, friendly & attentive but not overbearing. In fact, the whole staff was attentive and great. We were recommended the seafood platter and we dove right in...for 42 dollars, I thought that might have been a little bit much BUT this is San Francisco so I wasn't surprised. I didn't count, but it came with a lot of oysters that for two people we were having a hard time finishing it...and this NEVER happens, as I happen to love oysters. There were cocktail shrimps (really fish and plump) and stow crab claws, which I was a little disappointed because they weren't fresh...I am guessing they aren't fresh because Stowe crabs are mainly harvest in Virginia, so i am assuming that they were shipped, plus they had that texture where something was frozen and just thawed feel. But I liked it overall...\nEntree: I got the spicy mussel and monk fish stew and it was good...It's comes with little toasted bread on the side so that you can dip into the rich, tomato/bell peppery broth. I liked it and would ordered it again. My date got the scallops...I've had better...I wasn't impressed and would not recommend it....especially if you are picky about scallops. \nOn to desserts...if you come here...you have to get dessert. I thought it was actually better than our entrees...hahahaha...\nI got the rhubarb strawberry cobbler with homemade graham cracker topping and a scoop of their Tahitian vanilla ice cream...SIMPLY DIVINE & my date got the brandied cherries creme brulee...yum...\nJUST yum...it was heaven. \nOverall...I would recommend Anchor and Hope...the atmosphere, starters, desserts and wait staff make it worth coming back for.", "author": "Mary B."}

Called in for a reservation and was placed on hold 3 times in a row for a long time.  Probably spent 25 minutes holding when we were only 10 minutes away.  Seems the hostess was MIA and whoever was answering the phone didn't have the training to book tables.\n\nAmbiance was fine - a little loud due to the brick warehouse but still comfortable.  It took a while to get a server to come over - I noticed she was also playing hostess and busing tables so they may have been understaffed.\n\nWe ordered some wine and oysters followed by fish and chips.  30 minutes later as the wine was running dry - still no sign of the oysters.  Figured that was because we ordered the ones from Oregon and they had gone to farm them fresh.  Waitress tells us they are on the way (without checking with anyone).  They did bring bread in a little paper bag - I think the idea was supposed to be clever but we found it cheap.  Ran out of butter pretty quickly and they didn't notice - had to ask and the refill took 10 minutes.\n\n40 minutes into the meal - oysters arrive - yea!  We slurp those up instantly then there is another 20 minute wait for the main dishes.  Fish and chips were just OK but for the price I felt pretty ripped off.  They tasted a bit watery and we had to ask a few times for more sauce.  At this point the crowd had dissipated and the whole staff was congratulating themselves on another lunch service finished, while we were still waiting for condiments.\n\nWe ended up late getting back for our 2 pm meeting even though we should have had ample time.  We would like to be fans of the Town Hall and Salt House crowd but for serial restaurateurs they just really don't have a solid game.  Plus that whole screw-you attitude.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-07-18", "description": "Maybe it should be called \"Hope and a Prayer\"!\n\nOkay, so I would probably give this place more like 4 stars based on the food alone, but combined with the clumsy service and lack of  atmosphere I wouldn't recommend it. I had dinner here last night with three friends and we all felt that it was a major disappointment.\n\nFirst of all, the dining room atmosphere is ill-conceived and poorly executed. It is a nice size room with exposed rafters and skylights which could be good. But as soon as you walk in you notice the awkward scattering of mismatched tables, some with linens, some without, and some placed just feet from the door. The seating also seems as much of an afterthought made up of uncomfortable aluminum chairs and wooden benches. They are apparently going for a \"fish shack\" atmosphere, but if you're not paying \"fish shack\" prices than you would expect a little more . They are obviously going for something here, but it just looks cheap and thrown together. They have used incredibly flimsy looking metal factory lighting and they threw up a few old fishing lanterns above the seating. It looks like they've set up for a theme party and forgot to put the rest of it up, or forgot to take it all down. The mural behind the bar is graphic and modern but completely incongruous to the rest of the decor. Also the open service station is poorly placed outside the bathrooms which also seems strange and serves to cut off flow. \n\nThe service was also pretty appalling. For a place that charges $12 for a salad, you'd imagine the service would be pretty great. However, this is not the case. The service was slow and not particularly friendly.  It seems our server had to leave after asking every question. He asked if we wanted water, then left for 10 minutes, then came back and we ordered drinks, then left for 10 minutes, then we ordered some oysters, another 10 minutes, the oysters came and we still did not have our drinks, then he came back and we finally got to order our main dishes, our salads came fairly promptly, but it seems like our entrees took forever. When they did arrive, my partner asked for more sauce, which never came, and at one point I was asked by a server to hand him a plate that was apparently out of his reach. Now, normally I am happy to help out, but when a meal is over $300 for four people, it is unacceptable. \n\nNow the food is the one bright spot here. I have to say they have some very inventive and delicious dishes. They have a good selection of oysters and they were fresh and creamy, however the platter came with two sauces and no way to spoon them on. I ordered the smoked trout salad that blew me away, it was very good, although no fresh cracked pepper was offered to anyone at my table. This was followed by the Monkfish, Mussel, and Saffron Chorizo stew, again it was excellent, although it was so hot when it came to the table I think it was still boiling. My partner ordered their version of fish and chips which he said were outstanding. But do beware of the iced tea, which tasted, believe it or not, like liquid smoke had been added, very odd. \n\nIt seems like this place is going through growing pains. But with so many amazing restaurants in the Bay Area they need to figure it out. The kitchen seems to have it together, but the front of the house needs a lot of work. The decor is either not enough or too much of a theme and not high-end enough for the food and it's prices. The service needs to be streamlined and polished. There seems to be a lot of servers rushing around looking busy, but not being very efficient. I will try to come back here in a few months to do a follow up, although I don't think I will have any luck persuading my friends to come back with me.", "author": "Andrew D."}

The restaurant is more like a shellfish bar with a lot of tables. A couple of us don't eat shellfish, so I can't attest to the crab and oysters etc. Also, the chef seemed determined to X-out the non-shellfish options by adding non-Kosher ingredients to the fish dishes, such as pork belly, catfish, and ribs. So, it was very frustrating trying to order. But the fish we had, Idaho trout and almond crusted Shetland salmon, was very good. Just be prepared for a limited fish menu. For some reason we had an exceptional wait (over an hour) for our entre\u00e9s. The menu had asparagus as a side on many of the dishes, but by the time we were served we got broccolini, so it's possible they ran out and had to send someone to Safeway for another vegetable.

Went with a whole bunch of fellow workers and they raved about the lobster roll. It looked hefty. As for the tuna melt, there 2 thumbs up delicious and on thumb down taste like subway. The raves the angels on horseback got made us order several orders. Ho-hum actually. The rule that everything tastes good when fried holds true and the oyster was nice and creamy inside but it was a bit \"hard\" on the outside, not crunchy, if you know what I mean. I had the crab salad which was just okay. I've been known to sacrifice a live crab for my personal delectation and so my familiarity and my standards are high, so I would venture a guess that the crab was cooked the day before, and possibly not alive/fresh when it was cooked at that. I love raw oysters and the eastern oysters were delicious, briny and tasted of the ocean in all her glory. The local oysters tasted off, fishy and full of iodine. Stick with the east coast ones. The fish tacos were a disappointment, not tasty or crunchy using what looked and tasted like store bought tacos wrapping around bland poorly fried pieces of non descript fish. Contrast that with the excellent fried chips. The dusting of seasoning was haphazard which made for an uneven experience should you just eat one but well I couldn't just eat one, or two, or three so if I ever came back (doubtful) I'd make sure they were on the table right in front of me. Service from the manager was great, she was attentive and efficient. The waitstaff was another story. They didn't know who ordered what, they took my water glass and I had to ask for another one since they never came back with another. They poured for one side of the table and ignored the other. One person waited 5 minutes before we told them that we were missing an order. Very unprofessional, almost amateurish. For the money we didn't have to pay, I would say go elsewhere where someone who does pay will get what he or she paid for. If you know what I mean.", "author": "bongo c."}

Hmmm. Apologies from the waiter. Still no food. Finally, we threaten to leave if or food wasn't there in five minutes. Apps show up. 15 more minutes. Still no entrees. Still no one in the restaurant has food. We're leaving in 5 minutes if entrees don't arrive.

Roasted stuffed lobster was half a small lobster.  Halibut was on the small side too.  Lobster was tasty, halibut a bit oversalted.

That being said, Anchor & Hope made a believer out of me.  My famously fabulous friend and I endeavored to try the sea urchin one rainy night on a bit of a dare.  The bartender who was friendly but unobtrusive gave this urchin and crab appetizer so hearty an endorsement that we simply had to order it.  And it was fabulous. The sea urchin's soft, velvety texture was, well, a bit sensual--and definitely delectable.  The dozen oysters we ordered were a mixure of east and west coast lovelies, and my dining companion and I both concurred that it was all about the west coast, baby.  Those oysters were far superior in taste and texture.  As far as entrees go . . . both the scallops and the ahi tuna were fabulous, and the red wine was absolutely fine.  The acoustics aren't the greatest, so be prepared for a it to be a bit noisy.  We sat at the bar to be closer and better able to enjoy and comprehend each other's words before their syllables were lost in the past.  Be forewarned.  Anchor & Hope does not have a full bar--just beer, ale, and wine, but who cares?

Alas... I am still totally divided! There are things that I love and things that I hate. \nThe decor is super cool, a little over done but very well executed. Details like an ancient classroom desk as the host stand and a wrought iron community table with giant wedges securing its position summon emotions and memories warm and inviting. You feel as if you are in Nantucket steps from the ocean and a Kennedy. The blinking buoy above the bathrooms however??? Are you kidding me? Apparently not.\nTO THE FOOD\nThe food gets a mere \"meh\" from myself and my guests. The first time we were a party of 6 so we had plenty to share and taste. The \"fries with eyes\" and the seafood stew were the only things worth remembering. The black bass was good but nothing special; the lobster roll was good but nothing special; the fried clams were good but nothing special. Do you sense a theme here? The second time around it was one other person and I solamente. We were lucky enough to order the sea urchin with dungenous crab and potato served in its shell. In fact this dish bumped the review up to 3 stars from 2; its that good. The foie special however... BORING. There was little chunks of tuna (I think) on the plate with this marmalade stuff that I kept mistaking for the the foie and toward the end of the dish I was just pissed. I want my foie to shine and represent itself in all its evil glory.\nThis place is worth checking out but temper your expectations. Like its sisters Town Hall and Salt House, Anchor and Hope has great things and terribly wrong things. I'd even just sit at the counter with the bulbous breastastic lanterns hung from above, you're more than likely to check your expectations that way.", "author": "Ishmael C."}

My friend had the sea bass, which from a taste was good.  Then we had the multi layered chocolate cake that had expresso spreads between its layers and pieces of caramel brittle to top it off.

Last night we asked for a table but were directed to the bar even though half of the restaurant was empty. Their food is mediocre, but definitely not worth the price tag.

It used to be one of our favorite restaurants and somewhere we would take visitors when they came in town. Not anymore!! One star.", "author": "K L."}

As soon as I saw the decor, I knew we had to stay for dinner. Inside, the place was packed on a Weds, and the hostess nicely informed us that she had two seats at their bar, which we promptly accepted. After careful consideration, we decided on some drinks, the most expensive sparkling rose on the menu, and a sweet white for the bf. It took a bit for us to be greeted by our bartendress/server but she was very gracious to offer us a few tastes of champagne to aid us in our decision. The food was pretty amazing,we began with the acorn soup(love the seasonal menu) and then moved on to the calamari(loved the chili peanut sauce) and then shared the paella(bonus for no seafood in it!) and I had the lobster remoulade , the special of the night, which I loved!! It consisted of huge chunks of  lobster and fresh herbs! Overall, good service, great ambiance, and great food! Will be back with family members who love seafood!", "author": "mia l."}

Aida said the warm sea urchin was the best thing she ever ate. It was in a lemon cream broth with lots of crab which I really liked. I didn't care for the actual sea urchin in the dish, not the restaurant's fault, just didn't like the texture. But I loved the lemon broth, lots of crab and mashed potatoes on the bottom of the shell. My only peeve about the dish, almost every bite of crab I ate, had reminents of shell in it. After every single bite of crab, I had to spit out shell and put it on my bread dish. At the end of the meal, I saw a lot of shell. It was a bit disappointing. Withouth all the shell, I would have given this place 5 stars, but it was just such an elementary mistake..", "author": "Stefanie G."}

I was really excited to try Anchor & Hope for the first time. First off the ambiance of the restaurant is great. I've never actually been to a fish house in Maine or New England but it had that kind of feel with the high ceilings and driftwoodesque tables. Really cool place for like a family dinner or second or third date. We started with the \"fries with eyes\" which was really tasty, little fried fish with remoulade. Be prepared to eat the entire fish though, eyes and head and all. Delish! I had the lobster roll for my entree and while it was good I don't know if I agree with the $25 price tag. It was definitely filling but man I kind of wanted more bang for my buck. Well I wasn't paying but you know what I mean. It's basically a sandwich and chips and yeah I know it's lobster but really? You get like three ounces for $25 bucks (how much do chips and roll cost? like 2 cents?) So yeah, it was tasty but expect to shell out the bucks here for that good ol' ambiance and trendy factor. I did really enjoy my meal though. Also we were able to walk in without a reservation on a Thursday night. We did get seated at the communal table but I thought that made it more fun.", "author": "Cathy T."}

We had early reservations (6:30pm) on a Sunday night, but were late, and called ahead to let them know.  No problem, the place was still in daylight, 1/2 full and friendly vibe when we walked in past 7pm.  Had a great table, in the corner, at 90 degrees of each other, looking out into the restaurant.  The service tried to be attentive, with different staff taking orders, delivering orders, refills etc.  I appreciated the waitress really knowing the wine list, and offering to put 1/2 my glass of white wine chilled while I fnished the first portion.  A first for me!  Loved the\"angels on wings\" - I had these at Xmas time and raved about them then.  Even hubby tried them.  We both chose one of the specials, which was a \"CLT\" -Soft Shell Crab, with other incredible ingredients,and a mixt salad on the side.  The service did deteriote slightly through the meal, however my husband did not notice, and they served his cappucino with a single candle for his birthday - very nice touch. Also the first round of drinks was not on the cheque, and we appreciated that.  This is a special, casual place that I would reserve for my friends that appreciate good food, casual but fun atmosphere.  Most of the clientele are in their late 30's and more......

We had a group reservation for 8:30 for a friend's birthday and we got there early to make sure we could check-in. Over an hour later and without apology we were seated and then left alone. There didn't seem to be any interest in taking our order and it wasn't until after two hours from arriving at the restaurant that we received our appetizers. Other parties that had arrived after our were seated first and served first. I did not see any effort made to try to accommodate our group or any urgency to provide service. The simple task of refilling water was even neglected. By the end of dinner service the only thing I wanted to do was be able to leave. It seems the only thing they do fast is take your money. I would not recommend this venue if you want attentive service. As for the food, it was generally good (though I believe overpriced). Some of the appetizers were over seasoned with lemon but other than that the food was good. Overall though, the experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not be returning there for dinner again.", "author": "Josh B."}

Seriously, this was glass half full/half empty experience all the way around.  Everything there had an upside and a down side.  Let me explain:  The East Coast fish house theme decor is cool but the metal chairs are cold and uncomfortable.  The staff was fantastic but a little too attentive. if you know what I mean.  The guy behind the bar was great - he let me sample 3 wines before selecting my glass.  The server was fantastic (thin woman with short hair).  She definately found her calling.  The down side was that the busser came over every 3 minutes to try and take plates.  Seriously, he came over more than 5 times and my co-worker had to grab her plate!  The food was good but definately more suited for lunch.  I had the halibut that is served as fish and chips.  It was good but not spectacular.  My co-worker had the lobster roll and it was just okay.  I should have tried the black bass.  We did experiment with an interesting appetizer though.  We tried the sea urchin and the presentation was very cool.  They simply hollowed out a large purple sea urchin and mixed the meat with some potatoes and a sauce.  Somewhat tasty and interesting but I wouldn't order it again.  We skipped desert since nothing sounded good.

We had separate servers for the drinks and food, which was a little confusing at first but that seems to be a trend lately at restaurants around the city.  Regardless, both servers were nice and friendly - and quick.  We were in a rush to make a movie and they made us a priority.  Very cool for a first time at a restaurant.  We shared oysters that were fabulous, and then we tried the blackened prawns appetizer which was good (but not very filling).

I really like the decor of the restaurant...exposed brick, wood beams, nautical but not cheesy feel. We had a very friendly waiter who when asked what his favorite dish is on the menu said they are all wonderful...except to go with the lobster roll for lunch not dinner. And he was right. Half of our table ordered fish dishes, the other half meat dishes. My fish and chips were crispy and flavourful. The rosemary salted potato wedges were definitely a step up from the regular fries. My friends ordered the spiced lobster tail, pork chop, and steak...of which I tried a bite from each....and I have to give those dishes rave reviews as well.

While waiting for our table at the bar, the bartender was excellent chatting about the extensive beer list and sharing his favorite menu items.  Our server was fantastic - she quickly assessed that I was with a group who had not seen one other in a long time so there would be lots of chatting and a few glasses of wine before ordering.  And I loved the space.  Appetizers were good - bacon wrapped oysters (Angels on Horseback), fried calamari with chili sauce, and fries that were more like chips - very addictive.  I was prepared to love this restaurant.  My entree came - lobster roll with chips and coleslaw and although it looked lovely, the lobster was over-salted and when added to the salt on the chips, made eating the coleslaw as a palate cleanser mandatory.  Maybe I just mis-ordered (but a $24 sandwich should be good, right?)?  The halibut looked delicious as did the hanger steak.
