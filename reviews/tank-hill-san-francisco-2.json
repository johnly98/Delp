The views of SF are incredible, especially on a beautiful day because you can see the highest building in SF so clearly (without the fog in the way)! This panoramic view of SF is sure to WOW you away because I sure was! \n\nThis is a perfect place if you are looking to escape the hustle and bustle of SF. It's definitely quiet and peaceful. \n\nDo you need an alternative other than Twin Peaks? Well, look no further because this beauty is everything you need to see. Yup, another one of my SF Urban Hikes led me to this awesome hidden gem and honestly, I am so happy I found it. \n\nIt's nicely nestled in a non-touristy residential area, so it's totally easy to miss. Don't look for any signs because there aren't any. \n\nHow to find this hidden gem: Drive to Belgrave Avenue. Street parking is available. Walk to the eastern end of Belgrave and you'll find a slightly hidden staircase on your left that will wind its way up Tank Hill.\n \nThings to bring: \n*    A jacket-Well, come on now! It does get chilly in SF, right?\n*    A lunch\n*    Some great company\n*    Last but not least don't forget your camera-Duh! \n\nSo grab a friend, pack you a lovely lunch and take a nice hike up to Tank Hill to enjoy amazing company, a delicious meal, and a lovely epic view that spans from the Bay Bridge all the way to Golden Gate Bridge. This is a place you should not miss. Plus, it's FREE!\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Porsche C."}

Out of the three, this is probably the one that is the least exciting; however, the view of SF is definitely memorable once you reach the \"top.\" \n\nTank Hill is located in a residential area, so there are quite a number of parking spots on the sloping street - so interesting to see a public park right next to the many homes of the residents. We went to Tank Hill twice - one at night and one during the day; it's definitely too dark to see where you are walking if you aren't familiar with the area, so I wouldn't recommend coming to Tank Hill too late. A lot of the locals use Tank Hill as their gym/source of exercise - definitely not as popular of a place as the other parks.\n\nWalk up the steps and you're immediately taken to a hill that overlooks the view of SF. It's pretty amazing and, like another reviewer mentioned, you get a 360 view of SF. But what's even more special is the addition of a park bench that was placed by a resident in dedication to his wife, if I remember correctly. The shiny green bench is situated at the perfect spot, allowing for whoever is on that bench to sit and enjoy the view of the city. Because the park is still not too well-known, hopefully you won't get interrupted by too many people eager to sit on that bench. \n\nIf you actually turn to the right after coming up the steps, you'll see a flat, wooded area. You can't really see much of the view, and if you turn away from the city, you see the woodsy area with green trees and branches. But what's smack in the middle of that flat area? A swing! I don't think we were prepared for the discovery of the swing - seems like it's a pretty new addition to the park, but it's pretty cool to sit on it. If you are able to pump high enough, you can see a bit of the SF city view. \n\nAnd from the top, you're even able to get a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge, the water, and the many, many houses and buildings that SF is known for. We ended up not visiting Twin Peaks this time and I definitely did not regret it! \n\ntl;dr - A not-so well known park located in SF with a cute bench and a swing! Hopefully foot traffic will still stay low so everything stays in pristine condition. Definitely give this place a visit if you're in the area and, like my sister (okay - and me), are a fan of very Instagram-able type spots.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

But with a little research, we found this is a secluded little locals spot. And the best surprise was the swing! I'm a swing fanatic and this discovery just made it the best. For me, this is an awesome park because all I need is a great view and a bench. I could spend the whole day here drinking in the fantastic views. It isn't the prettiest place but it is definitely worth the short hike up the stairs. And then the short walk to the swing, what could be better than a good swing and great views while swinging?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-13", "description": "No doubt, one of the best views of the city.  The actual \"park\" is so small that it is often not listed anywhere for people to find when researching SF.\n\nI was always curious as to the history of this site--so I found the following from a SFGate article on urban outings:\n\nBy Gail Todd Published 4:00 am, Thursday, October 25, 2007\n\nTank Hill\n\n\"Dazzling views of San Francisco, dozens of native plant species, plus hawks and endangered butterflies make this little-known but centrally located destination well worth the climb to the top.\n\nRich in history, Tank Hill is named for the Clarendon Heights water tank built in 1894 to store drinking water pumped from Laguna Honda. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, eucalyptus trees were planted around the tank to hide it from feared Japanese airplane attacks. When a larger, covered reservoir was built nearby, the tank became unnecessary, and in 1957 the city removed it. In 1977, a concerned community persuaded the city to buy the hill from private developers for $650,000 as part of the city's new Open Space Program.\n\n\nThis spot is a 650-foot-high minipark that offers what many consider to be the most spectacular view of San Francisco of any hilltop park. So small that many maps of San Francisco leave Tank Hill out entirely, this spot provides a panorama that sweeps from the Golden Gate Bridge to Bayview Hill. Access is from the east end of Belgrave Avenue off Stanyan Street or via a small staircase on Twin Peaks Boulevard near Crown Terrace.\"\n\n So, there you have it--another interesting tidbit about our beautiful city.  Be careful up there as it can be a tad precarious.", "author": "Thomas D."}

While not as well trodden as Twin Peaks and Buena Vista, it offers an almost completely unobstructed view of San Francisco from Ocean Beach to Bayview. Very few points in the city offer such a magnificent view of both bridges while remaining relatively tourist free! In fact, it took me more than a year of living here before I found it.\n\nAs a park, it is simply beautiful. It's sort of a hybrid between Grand View and Corona Heights. There are trees and trails as well as exposed rock to climb.\n\nAdditionally, Tank Hill is only a short walk from both Cole Valley and Eureka Valley, making it the perfect place to include in a neighborhood outing.", "author": "Sophia A."}

Very cool!\n\nIt's a great alternative to Twin Peaks, if you're not up for sitting in a long line of cars so that you can park and join a long line of people and then follow a long caravan of cars back down the hill.

This is a great place for a panoramic view of the city, but it does not offer much else in terms of walking/hiking/picnicking. There's fun rocks to sit atop and also one cute green bench, though! Because of the height, it is also very windy (the billowing gusts make for a very cold experience if you do not have adequate outwear, even if it is sunny!). I would call this more of a look-out than a park, but the view is spectacular, especially the initial ascension up the side of the hill. Reminds me of Grand View park, except a little more secret and thus a lot less crowded.

I had just read \"Oh the Glory of It All!\" and decided to search for Pat Montandon's angel tree on Shrader after googling it and realizing it was just up the street from where I live. The tree was pretty awesome to behold, and having walked up that far, I figured at this rate, I could hit Twin Peaks. I continued to walk up towards the tower and came upon a foresty area just off of Carmel. Having heard enough fairy tales to know not to go wandering into dark foresty areas alone, I did a 180 and proceeded to march off in the opposite direction, which is when I discovered a friendly looking trail. A minute later was possibly the best view of SF one could hope for.\n\nI kept it a secret for a while, but since gave in and told all my friends. Tank Hill is now my default place for celebrating New Year's Eve and 4th of July. The views are panoramic, and you can see GG bridge, the Financial District, and Oakland off in the distance. It can at times get quite windy, but just be sure to have your North Face parka handy. It's a nice little getaway for reading (if not windy), and I've even see people do tai chi there.

You can see both bridges, all the ballparks in the SF and Oakland, downtown, the tip-tops of the trees in the park, USF, Alta Plaza Park, DeYoung, etc, etc.  The best part is you don't have to vie for the view with the tourists.  I love how I surprise my guests by pulling over in a 'berby hood and lead them up these random, hidden stairs.  I've seen fireworks (of both types), red-tailed hawks, little secret notes left for people, and have watched a huge ship enter the bay, go under the bridges, and dock in Alameda.  It is really pleasant up there after all the rains, when the whole bay area is green and vibrant.  I visit on sunny days, clear nights, foggy afternoons, or wind-blown evenings just to catch a fresh breath and remind myself that I'm pretty small in comparison to all that's going on around me... I'm amazed by its beauty every time.", "author": "Tara G."}

In the spring, there is a succession of native wildflowers that you would just not expect to find in the middle of the city.
