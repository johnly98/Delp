When we visited his restaurant Mason, two months ago, he highly recommended that we try Paulie's Pickling since I live nearby.\n\nPaulie's Pickling is located in the shared marketplace: 331 Cortland (no available seating). Their specialty is as their namesake states: pickles. They have an array of different pickled veggies: cucumbers, green beans, sauerkraut, cauliflower, jalapenos, spicy carrots, etc. which are about $6-$10 per a jar.\n\nThey also serve up various Jewish deli-style sandwiches ($7.50-$11.50), bagels and smears ($3.50-$8), salads (price varies on size), and housemade drinks like honey cardamom soda, egg creams, cucumber lemonade ($3.50). Please note that prices on their website are not current. Most items were about $1 more when I visited yesterday. CC's accepted. \n\nMost 8-year olds would cringe at the thought of eating liver. My classmate did...so much so that she would trade her weekly liverwurst sandwich for my pathetic burnt toast folded over with a slice of ham and imitation cheese. \n\nWhen perusing the menu, I immediately gravitated to the Brisket & Liver Combo Sandwich w/ grilled slaw, onion, and Russian dressing ($11.50) http://bit.ly/1x9hOLr. Between a choice of rye, onion roll, sourdough, and wheat, I went with sourdough bread. The sliced sourdough was lightly toasted in the oven so it held everything together quite well. Overall, I thought the sandwich was just OK. For the price, I wouldn't order it again. Just like Ed U., I thought the brisket was very dry and bland. I found myself just picking it out of the sandwich. =/ The slaw gave a nice crunch, however, it lacked acid to cut through the richness of the meats. The highlight was the liver (5 stars) which was decadently rich and creamy (no metallic taste). I'm glad they sell this a la carte because it would make a killer spread over some lightly toasted Acme or Josey Baker bread.  Mmmm....\n\nThe sandwich also came with a pickle spear which was perfectly pickled, uber crunchy, and very satisfying. For the price of the sandwich, I wish it came with two spears but anyhow, I would definitely come back for a jar.\n\nA NYC classic, it's rare to find egg creams in SF so I ordered a Vanilla Egg Cream ($3.50) to slurp on while I waited for my sandwich to be made. Loved the prominent vanilla flavor but it was too sweet for my liking. Next time, I would ask for less syrup. \n\nService was very friendly and sandwiches took about 8 minutes to be made (only 1 person working).\n\nEasy street parking. \n\nThe sandwich, egg cream, and small tip totaled over $18...for a non-sit down lunch. Eeeeeck. Ahhh, the price of being a wannabe groupie...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I thought I had a solid handle on all the Jewish-style delis in town, so seeing I missed this one in Bernal Heights made me feel like a shmendrik. Well, you could have knocked me over with a paper towel and picked me up with a pair of silver ice tongs when I saw that this has been in a communal space at 331 Cortland for the past 4-1/2 years. I convinced Jamie W. to accompany me for a Saturday afternoon visit, and I was amazed I was able to find parking just a half-block away. Gee, I wish there were more incubators in the city that allow budding small business owners to share space and cut down on their rent to establish themselves. Married owners Paul and Liz Ashby run their combination deli, bagel and pickle shop in here.\n\nIt's clearly the favorite of the six businesses in operation in here. Lots of sandwiches to choose from the whiteboard (photo: http://bit.ly/1rnVWde), but I already knew from a Yelp photo check that I was getting the $10.50 Brisket and Liver Combo with their Grilled Slaw, Russian Dressing and Onion. I ordered it on an onion roll (photo: http://bit.ly/YDDUHo), and I was surprised that the luxuriantly creamy chopped liver overpowered the brisket which was a bit dry and under-seasoned for my taste. The grilled slaw was a nice switch fro the expected mayo-mustard mix lending a welcome smokiness to the sandwich. Jamie was happier with his choice, the $11 Brisket Reuben which more predictably had Sauerkraut, Russian Dressing and Swiss Cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/1vlz9gh).\n\nThe ingredients blended more comfortably together in his sandwich, and the sauerkraut, in particular, had a nice fresh taste. Of course we had to have Paul's specialty, the housemade pickles, and we enjoyed the snappy flavor of the garlic dill spears we got (photo: http://bit.ly/1ndYlQm). Just from looking at the display of them in the case, I ended up getting a jar of them to go (photo: http://bit.ly/VGlJ1P). The other temptation I caved into was a $3.50 slice of the Lokshen Kugel, which looked good in the case. Liz warmed it up for me, and it was one of the best slices I've had. I had a good one at Wise Sons, but this was much richer with a custard-like consistency and plenty of egg noodles and raisins (photo: http://bit.ly/1pTnswk). You do have to shlep everything you buy, so they obligingly bag everything up for you. Oy, I'm mishpocheh!\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...Paulie has fine, snappy pickles, but it's the creamy chopped liver and kugel that stand out...though not together\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...the 311 Cortland marketplace concept is very cool...a little seating area would be nice\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...responsive, helpful in explaining the choices\nTOTAL - 4 stars...not quite verklempt but Paulie and Liz have reason to kvell", "author": "Ed U."}

The \"under $10\" given to this business only applies to a couple things on the menu.\n\nThey also never ask if I want my bread toasted which should be done by default but only is if you get cheese which costs extra. Pickles are great, they give you one quarter spear and they will give you two quarters if you ask (they used to do this by default). I used to also get a Russian pear soda from the place adjacent to Paulie's in this co-op but now it seems 2 of the food stands at this address have had to leave but I guess it doesn't affect me anyway since the money I'd be giving them ends up going to Paulie's now anyway in the form of raised prices. It's the little things that killed this place for me, but I'm sure this place will still thrive without me because of all the rich yuppie asshats that have flocked to this neighborhood. Make sure to pay them no mind when they give you dirty looks for pulling up a chair across from them at one of the 2 small tables in here while you wait for your order.", "author": "Sky M."}

Well, I have news for you. I once flew across the COUNTRY for a pickle. Guss Pickles, the iconic  barrels filled with brine out front on the Lower East Side. Sadly, it exists only now as Ess-A-Pickle in Brooklyn, due to the rising rents in Manhattan. Mother of god. Those were great pickles.  \n\nIf you have only had supermarket pickles, you just don't understand. Okay, let me try to explain. It's the difference between filet mignon and a Hungry-Man minute steak, between freshly made yogurt drizzled with honey on a warm day on a Greek island versus Yoplait, tomatoes grown in your back yard versus the round red supermarket orbs.\n\nSo, I can't keep having them FedEx me pickles from Brooklyn. I always look locally, and I am always very disappointed.\n\nUntil now.\n\nSo I go to Cortland and it's a tiny shopfront in a cooperative store, a deli with fresh cookies for Hannukah no less. Liz was behind the counter. I'm not sure why other people say she's not friendly. She's just from Boston!  That IS friendly by Boston standards. By Manhattan standards, she would be a loquacious laggard. In the LES, the extent of the conversations is: \n\"Quart of Spicy.\"\n\"That's five bucks...next!\"\n\nMe, I thought Liz was quite nice. We chatted a bit; she let me sample a bunch of different stuff. And, the pickles. \n\nWow.\n\nPerfect crunch, great flavor. The kind you just can't stop eating until they are gone. Me personally, I like a tad less dill and a touch more garlic, but I'm not complaining! I can get REAL pickles on the West Coast finally!!!\n\nAnd pickled green beans! And lox! And a nice lean Reuben! And an egg cream! Oy gevalt!\n\nAlso, the sauerkraut is delicious! I bought a pint. Now when I went to use it after a week, it looked a bit off although it smelled fine. Now I pickle at home. Okay, actually I TRY to pickle at home, and... look, let's not dwell on this okay. Let's just say there were some disasters and I am no longer allowed to pickle at home. BUT, I thought it was okay, but I gave Paul a call just to ask. He says to bring it by the shop. Liz and I both look at it, and agree it's fine. BUT, she takes it and right on the spot fills up a new fresh jar of sauerkraut from the back for me. \n\nCome on, where do you see that kind of phenomenal customer service these days! Above and beyond the call of duty, guys! But I won't complain for outstanding service.\n\nMakes me want to buy a quart of pickles a week.

I ate the brisket and chopped liver on rye and absolutely loved it! Rarely do I like beef liver or brisket but this combo, plus Russian dressing, onion and grilled slaw, was awesome.

It should be good.\" Or so I thought.\n\nOur two sandwiches, a Brie baguette and a Brisket + Chopped liver came out at a turtles pace but it's understandable since they were toasting the creations in a mini convection oven. All sandwiches come with a side pasta, tabbouleh, or bean salad which helps but doesn't make up for the failed expectations from the sandwiches.\n\nAfter only a 3 minute walk home, both sandwiches weren't luke warm. They were nearly cold. Have you ever had a brisket and chopped liver sandwich cold? Ya, I don't believe so. Putting that aside, the flavors weren't exactly all there and the \"chopped liver\" had more of a pate smear texture. So, when accompanied with the sloppy joe style brisket the sandwich had a chunky pudding like structure. \n\nI didn't get a chance to try any of their pickles but after having a sandwich I believe it's easy to say that Paulie's Pickling should stick to well...

The sandwich was a spin on classic tuna salad - with relish, celery, lemon and mayo and topped with lettuce and pickled onions on a roll (I had poppyseed, it was delish).  It didn't look that big, but I could only eat half (and I was hungry).  I *loved* the lentil salad (made with pickled carrots, maybe cinnamon?) and potato salad (made with lots of dill and pickled green bean pieces, no mayo).  The barley salad was a little strong for my taste, with feta and sundried tomato strips, but I think that was just a personal preference (and btw, I ate it all anyway).  I think a whole sandwich which comes with a side salad was $7, so pretty reasonable considering the quality.\n\nPaulie's shares its space with 5 (?) other vendors, so it's almost like going to a permanent farmers market - other vendors have sushi, organic produce, cutlery, vegan baked goods (this is Bernal after all), and yummy-looking empanadas.  I am dying to go back!", "author": "Lynn S."}

The only thing that is not perfect is that the sandwiches are a bit cold. I'm ok with sandwiches not being hot - but these tend to be a few degrees below perfection. Still 5 stars though.", "author": "Fred A."}

Just really great food and great to be able to support local businesses.\n\nSecond - The pickles here are STELLAR.  Bought some zesty originals and garlic dill - both are amazing.  They are perfectly flavored and fresh and crunchy at the same time.  Paulie was pickling right there next to us.  They were so nice and let us have a little taste of everything.  First class pickling.  I will be back!", "author": "Abby G."}

They're huge, so sometimes I just go for the half-sandwich and it's plenty.  With every sandwich you get to choose a side salad (quinoa, lentils, potato salad, slaw, pasta) and they're all really good.", "author": "Chris F."}

I'm looking forward to try the pickled cauliflowers. I also had the tuna melt with Paulie's special sauce which was a nice touch of spicy. Great food and great pickles.

The place is run by a super friendly couple in a co op . I tried my friends tuna melt and it was amazing. It had some secret sauce that really made the sandwich. I had the braised brisket on rye. It was a giant pile of delicious meat with slaw and dressing and it came with a great pasta salad. I also had the corned beef and that was good too. can't wait to try the pickles", "author": "mark h."}

Their sandwiches are fantastic. The only reason this is not a 5 star rating is the space these guys occupy in a \"Co-Op\" arrangement is just too small. A dining area with a few tables would be terrific. Otherwise this place is great for that quick lunch. Take a jar of pickles home to put in the fridge. Or two. Or three.", "author": "MAURICE C."}

I had been wanting to tryZOVIRAX\u00ae (acyclovir) Cream 5% ickles since they opened but never could get my act together. Until today. The classic Garlic & Dill is a very good pickle. It takes me back to the pickle barrels of my youth in a deli on Kedzie Avenu on Chicagos North side. But it pales in comparison to the HALF SOUR, a non vinegar naturally brine fermented pickle. This the REAL DEAL. And Paulies half sour is way more sour than most pickles FULL sour. Yet it is still crisp, full of fresh pickle flavor. You want to jut suck the brine off it. Then...wait for it.....there is......CHOPPED LIVER!  I am going to have that for lunch tomorrow. A chopped liver sandwich.  I only had a taste, but this was a chopped liver that should be world famous. From New York to Chicago, to LA and beyond, I dare you to find better chopped liver. Eat this food!", "author": "Gary G."}
