Although the wait could be long at times (especially on Friday and weekend nights - 40-1hr wait), if you come right at the time when they open or at 5-5:30PM in other weekdays, there seems to be only 5-10 minutes or barely any wait. \n\nThe first thing you would hear as you open the door would be \"FRESH UDON!\" It is in a food-court style in which you come in a line to first order your udon, choose your tempura/musubi, and pay at the cashier. Then, there is a little bar with toppings and sauces, including green onions, tempura flakes, tempura sauce...etc. \n\nEvery time I come here, this is what I always get:\n1) Nikutama udon, hot, regular (you can just say \"#8 regular\") \n- It comes w/ sweet beef, caramelized onions, and soft-boiled egg in Bukkake sauce and kake soup that is not too sweet. It is VERY flavorful! Since they make their own noodles, it is very FRESH and CHEWY! You can actually see them rinsing the noodles w/ cold water a lot to give that chewy texture. They also give you enough beef, which is a big plus for me:)\n2) Squid tempura (my favorite!!!)\n- In many restaurants, I see that the batter is too thick with not much filling inside. Here, the squid fills up the whole space and the batter is not too thick! Complements greatly to its sweet tempura sauce that you can get from the bar.\n3) Mentaiko musubi\n- I recommend this to anyone who loves mentaiko (pollock roe) like I do:)\n\nFrom the bar, I put A LOT OF green onions, because it adds that spicy flavor to my udon and some tempura flakes as well. If you want more spice, I recommend adding some spicy chili powder as well!\n\nIn a cold, windy day (which is almost always in SF), Marugame Udon would definitely be a great choice to melt your stomach :)", "author": "Justyn P."}

Staff is youthful and somewhat friendly. Three of us split a large spicy udon and a normal sized udon whose name I don't recall. Also got onion tempura and chicken tempura. Both were flabby and mostly batter. They have a little condiments bar that lacks vinegar or lemon-kinda need one or the other to oomph up the flavor of the soups.\n\nIn the end I'd say the udon was good quality but, alas, I can't stand the texture or flavor of udon noodles and much prefer ramen which they don't seem to have here. \n\nDo come here if you're an udon fan-and split a large, but avoid the tempura.", "author": "Trish W."}

Their choice of tempuras were different from their other place but still good. \n\nPrices are a little cheaper here which was good. Still a clean place and fast service. New since beginning of 2018.

I noticed that the one at this location had a wider selection of add-ons at the end like spam musubi that I hadn't noticed when I went to the one in SoCal (though I could've just overlooked it) but I thoroughly enjoyed picking way too much add-on items since the udon bowl (even a regular size) was more than enough to fill my tummy. \n\nLuckily they had to go boxes for all my extras that I had enjoyed at a later time. \n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend this place!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-14", "description": "Being sick that day... I was in the mood for feel good soup noodles. I had heard that Marugame Udon and Marukame Udon (in Hawaii) were of the same company. I had been eyeing this place for awhile given the amount of reviews, and I honestly prefer udon more than ramen (the noodles are more fun to eat!). Having not gone to the Hawaii location, this place sold me on their udon.\n\nFOOD\n\nI believe in the hype (I haven't gone to the Hawaii location). Got the regular Nikutama Hot Udon, which was the perfect cure for my runny nose. Everything was so tasty. I loved the udon - soft but chewy, not at all soggy. The soup also went really well with the mellow flavor of udon. The poached egg was awesome... the creaminess made it go well with savory flavor of the thin meat. It definitely tasted like comfort food.\n\nSome udon items are soupless, like the Mentai Kamatama Udon. I got to try some of my sister's, and it had a nice flavor to it. Very savory, if you're familiar with the burst of salt you get from eating fish eggs. Reminds me of mentaiko pasta without the cream. Overall, I liked it, though my sister was a little sad there was no warm broth.\n\nHonestly I'm glad I got the regular, because it gave me more room in my stomach to finish my sides! You get tempted to grab everything you see that looks delicious, but I opted for the vegetable kakiage tempura, fried fish, and fried shrimp tempura. I even got a mentaiko mayo rice ball. The tempura was perfectly crispy, and could be dipped in the designated sauce or dunked in your udon soup.\n\nSadly the rice ball... I never got to eat. I tried to take it with me, only for it to get smashed in my bag. Lesson learned... gotta restrain yourself on the sides.\n\nPRICE\n\nWorth it - and the best bang for your buck. My regular nikutama was only $8.50... and I was already quite full from just the udon. The sides are under $2, but it stacks up if you get too much... so seriously restrain yourself. The vegetable kakiage at $1.70 was a good deal for the side, and you get a variety of flavors from it. \n\nMy set of food was under $15 (before tax and tip), and I couldn't even finish my rice ball!\n\nLOGISTICS\n\nI'm fairly familiar with the concept of cafeteria style - in Seattle, there's popular chain called U:Don that does the same thing. Seating is first come, first serve... you aren't assigned a table, but you pick/pay for your food first.  You take a tray, choose your style of udon, they'll hand you the assembled bowl then you get the option of picking whatever pre-made fried sides you want.  There are also stations to add ginger, sauce, tempura bits, and green onions. Getting to control how much green onions was a nice touch - I love green onions!\n\nThere may be a line to get into the place, as a worker usually controls the flow of people that go in, which was the case for us. However because of the \"assembly line\", it went pretty fast for 1 pm on a Saturday (we waited about 20 min). And while it may look crowded and you may be tempted to \"save\" a table... people cycle through here pretty quickly, so I wouldn't worry about finding a table once you get your tray.\n\nParking is super easy because the store is located in the mall (though the entrance is outside of the mall). More of a reason to come here while in SF - easy parking!\n\nNow I can't wait to try the one in Hawaii...", "author": "Alyanna C."}

There was a small line but it was all inside and I saw the setup outside that showed there was a much longer line before. \n\nFirst, you line up and watch the noodles being made. It's really fun watching masters at work through the glass. You take a tray, bowl, and a plate and slide it along while you pick your noodles and hand them your bowl when it's your turn and then get back gold. \n\nI tried the Curry Udon and my friend got the Nikutama Udon. Both were insanely good and extremely reasonably-priced. $6.50-8.50 for regular, both +$1 to size up. Then you continue along down the line can add tempura to your plate. There's vegetables, sweet potato, chicken, and other options, as well as various types of musubi. I was insanely tempted by them all but only selected sweet potato and green bean tempura (both roughly $1.50 each.)\n\nLastly, you pay and you're off to add toppings. There's a sign that suggests what to add to different dishes. There wasn't a suggestion for Curry Udon so I added chives and green onion. They also had some sesame seeds and a type of ginger. \n\nHonestly the Curry Udon was heavenly. The noodles were thick but not overly chewy and oozed with flavor. The broth was savory, rich, and warm and great for a cold day at Stonestown. \n\nService: \nAmazing service. Quick, knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.

The vegetable kakiage was drenched in oil and chicken tempera had sogg outer coat.\n\nUdon on the other hand was decent in quality.  Nice and firm in texture and you get to try it cold or hot.  To be honest, you can enjoy that bowl of udon without anything on the side.  It is the star of the show!

I was actually in the 3rd section & ended up waiting approximately 30 minutes to get into the restaurant. Note to self (and you all of course!), don't come at dinner time- go at an off hour to avoid the wait. \n\nAs a first timer here, it was really cool seeing the workers make the noodles and prepare them right in front of you. The process is relatively quick so there's a steady flow of people in and out of this place. The menu isn't overwhelming in any way, just google some of the menu names to get an idea of what the broth will be like and you'll be fine! You'll get to pick your tempura options after you order so don't worry too much about that while waiting in line. You also get to add toppings (scallions, cilantro, etc.) after you order. \n\nI ended up getting the large and hot... bukkake. It's a shame that this word has turned into such an \"interesting\" meaning (don't google this option if you want to save yourself). The broth is soy-based and has a solid amount of depth due to the dashi. The noodles were cooked beautifully and had the perfect bite to compliment the broth. Moreover, for the price point of only $5.50, this is a steal. \n\nFor the tempura, I got the chicken and shrimp. These were just alright, nothing too spectacular, but were cooked right.

The chashu is okay, but of course, the main star of this dish is the udon. It has the absolute perfect texture. Make sure when you get the tempura bits that you dont add them to your udon, but put them on the side and only add them when you eat them. You get the super nice crunch from the batter and the chewiness of the noodles and the umami from the broth--it all comes together in perfect harmony. \"5 ALL DAY SON!!!\" \n\nNikutama:\nThe niku is savory, but a bit too sweet for my liking, but still very delicious nevertheless. The broth is light and the udon does most of the talking for this dish. Make sure you ask for some hot chili oil to give it that extra oomph.

Grab a freshly made bowl of noodles with your choice of soup base and pair that with a whole variety of tempura ranging from chicken karage, shrimp, and sweet potatoes. It reminds me of a high school cafeteria assembly line, but with exquisite delicacies. \n\nI ordered the Nikutama udon, which tasted like a sweet beef broth home made by your dearest grandma. I picked out a few pieces of chicken karages and a shrimp tempura that had me salivating waiting in line to pay. The chicken karage was crispy on the outside, but tender when you bite into it. Next to the register, there is a topping bar that lets you add tempura crumbs and finely cut green onions to pile on to your bowl. \n\nThe lines are long sometimes extending outside to prevent overcrowding, but there is good movement. Decent price point and ideal for a casual outing when you crave a hot bowl of noodle soup in the cold weather.", "author": "Ronald M."}

I missed out on the Hawaii version and was ecstatic to finally make the trek to the foggy city for a girls day out. I didn't have too many expectations going in but just excited for some fresh udon. I've only had the pre-packaged kind from the grocery stores previously. \n\nWe could see the line out the door and it was also lunch time so we expected to be in line for awhile. Much to our surprise, the line was only about 10 min? It's cafeteria style and and the udon is constantly being made so the line really moves as quickly as customers make their selections. The dining area is fairly large with both communal tables as well as smaller tables. Bus your own table after you eat and you are on your way! There is a big sign that says no outside food and holding tables - not sure how strictly this is enforced but it is posted. \n\nThere are many add ons to choose from after you make your udon selection - there is signage but still can be somewhat confusing. Don't be afraid to ask the workers as they will gladly explain the item. I chose 3 add ons - potato croquette, tamago tempura, and fried chicken. Potatoes are always my jam so it was definitely my fave. The tamago tempura was interesting to try but I don't know if I would get it again. The fried chicken was really tasty and very juicy inside. \n\nWhat my friends and I enjoyed the most was the condiment bar - they both said it was better than Hawaii or LA. We loaded up with sauces, green onions, tempura bits and flakes - YUM! \n\nIt was definitely a satisfying and somewhat inexpensive meal for you are getting but do be aware the add ons can add up quickly! The SFSU students are lucky to have this spot so close to campus! \n\nPROTIP: If you have leftovers, load up on more condiments - it's almost like new bowl of udon! :D Yelp check in for a free drink - was so distracted by everything I forgot to check in till much later haha! \n\nTwo things I will note about my visit - The first one is they have gender neutral restrooms here which is completely fine but dang - CHILL OUT to the dude in the bathroom who gave me dagger eyes like I was stupid for entering the men's room (you clearly didn't look at the sign SIR). Just be aware if this somehow makes you uncomfortable! The second one was I failed to check my receipt until I got home and realized I got charged DOUBLE for my udon. I'm still wondering where's the beef because that's basically what I got charged for (a #8 with beef instead of #4 plain with bukkake). What's ironic is that I didn't want beef and my friends did that's why they ordered #8 and I got the latter. I guess the cashier assumed we all got the same.

There's also a lot of seating so you don't have to worry too much about waiting around.\n \nIn San Francisco standards, this place was good, fast, and cheap. I ordered the Curry Udon and it was super filling even though I only ordered the Regular. The broth was heavy, the meat was flavorful, and the udon had the perfect amount of texture. You could also order sides which consisted of various tempura and spam masubi. Definitely use the sauces provided at the side bar for your tempura, and add the crispy things (not sure what they're called) into your udon.\n \nOne thing I didn't like was the bathrooms. It's poorly designed because it looks like there's only two bathrooms - each having the vacant/occupied lock capability. However, inside each vacant/occupied bathroom, there's actually two stalls inside (totaling 4 stalls for customers to use). I'm glad there's more bathrooms and it's gender neutral, but it's not obvious for people who come here for the first time. Bad design.\n \nWhen comparing this to Hawaii's, this restaurant location was not as good. Hawaii's was cheaper (~$5 vs ~$7), had some different udon options, and gave more per bowl. However, the theme was the same and at least SF has more seating.\n \nOverall, this restaurant can't beat Hawaii's but I still enjoyed my meal.

For the pale of heart, Chipotle is just next door lol.\n\nI usually get the large nikutama. The flavor has been inconsistent. Sometimes the sweetness is overpowering or it's too salty. Lol the best part after getting your bowl is all the extra side items you can get... And I usually lose myself here. Maybe skip the onigiri. They are cheap for a reason; they barely have any meat/stuffing.", "author": "James N."}

Finally took the leap of faith and chose to brave the SF wind while waiting in line for this place--and it did not disappoint! First off, albeit the line may seem long, it moves fairly fast. The staff at Marugame Udon has definitely upped their efficiency. They operate in an assembly line fashion. You choose the order you want (they have several menus outside, with #1-12 different types of udon to pick from). The options range from tonkotsu udon, to beef udon, thai spicy chicken, curry udon, etc. You let the staff member up front know whether you want a regular or large size, whether you want hot or cold noodles, and which type (#1-12) of udon you would like. \n\nThey then prepare your noodles the way you like, add the sauce, then the meat/eggs (if included in your order). You collect your order on a wooden tray, then slide down to the next part, where you can choose to add tempura, croquette, or various types of musubi for extra money. All in all, a very fast way to receive your meal while ensuring that it is made on the spot. The last step is to add complementary toppings and sauces on the side, which include green onions, ground sesame, chili flakes, etc. \n\nI opted for a hot, regular sized #8 nikutama udon. It was absolutely delicious. The beef was tender and well flavored. The noodles were very chewy and had a soft texture that went well with the broth. The egg yolk was cooked perfectly, very runny, and out of this world. My added toppings--tempura crumbs, chili flakes, and green onions, added a nice burst of flavor to each bite. I loved the customization aspect of this place. My only complaint is that I feel like there's too little beef and too much noodles. The ratio felt off, but otherwise the taste was on point. Worth the hype and I would definitely come back!", "author": "Karen Y."}

When we visited for dinner in the middle of the week , I was surprised at the line out the door and the full house inside . The wait wasn't terrible , and we had some time to look at photos and reviews to figure what what we wanted to order.  It's kind of like cafeteria style ordering , where you grab a tray and walk down the assembly line before paying for your food and grabbing a table. \n \nWe ordered one beef udon and one nikutama udon .  We also helped ourselves to a bunch of tempura . The beef udon was definitely wayyy better then the nikutama. The nikutama udon was too sweet and heavy in flavor...plus there wasn't much soup  and the egg was too cold.. I didn't care for it it much. The beef udon has a more clear and pure flavor and was served piping hot. \n\nOverall not bad . But nothing too extraordinary about the food itself . It's more the novelty of a build your own udon that makes it a memorable experience.", "author": "Brenda B."}

Sadly to sum it up, my visit to MARUGAME was a let down. The restaurant functioned kinda like a food court place where your go down the line then pay and sit anywhere you would like. The line actually moves quickly and diners sit and eat and bus their own dishes to the cleaning rack.  We had the tonkotsu udon which was supposed to be spicy( it was not). Broth was flavorful but a bit too oily for our tastes. We also got a few tempura items which I would pass on. Best to get tempura fresh instead of having them sit under a lamp for who knows how long.

Then at the end, the cashier rings you up and then you can go sit down and eat.\n\nI would highly recommend trying the Bukkake Udon (hot), Tonkotsu Udon, or the Curry Udon. Out of the three, my personal favorite is the Bukkake Udon (hot), large size. For $5.50, I get a big steaming bowl of noodles and delicious broth. Add a piece of delicious chicken and squid tempura, and a fresh salmon flake onigiri, and you have a meal fit for a king for around $12~! WOW!

I tried the potato croquette and the shishito pepper tempura. Then you pay at the register and seat yourself. There's a condiment bar where you can add green onions and tempura flakes to your udon.

The noodles were good, but honestly not any better than the udon packages that you can get at Hmart. \n\nI'd be much more impressed with Marugame if they added more drink options. Their soda fountain just has a couple of sodas and you can also get canned green tea, which isn't very appealing to me. Also, it might be more exciting if there were more options for customization. It feels like they're trying to make the selling point that you can customize the bowl but really you can just pick 1 of like 7 options and get some tempura or musubi on the side. \n\nI will say that the staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful, and they themselves definitely deserve 5 stars.", "author": "Claire C."}

Also, while both have lines, Marukame has more fluid and quicker service.  \n\nWe arrived on a Thursday a few minutes after 5.  The line was out the door but a lot shorter than expected.  It still took about 20 minutes to get just place an order.  And by the time they plated my noodles, walked to the tempura station and got rung up, I'd say it was closer to 30 minutes.  \n\nWe both got the Nikatuma Udon - his was large ($9.50) and mine was regular ($8.50).  With added sides of two shrimp tempura, a sweet potato tempura, and a zucchini tempura the total was $26.  I didn't see that the spoons were by the tempura bits/green onion station and had to ask an employee who came around to wipe down the table.  We were only able to get a seat at the communal table, but that was fine as we needed to eat quick to pick up our son before 6.  \n\nWe added fried tempura bits and green onions at the topping bar.  And tried both their sweet and regular tempura sauces.  The Nikatuma came with lots of beef pieces, a perfectly yolky barely poached egg, and the light sweet salty sauce.  The noodles were cooked perfectly.  The egg was wonderful though I felt it even could have been cooked a little more to form a tad more of a bind.  I chose to get mine hot but they didn't put much broth in it at all.  The sauce could have used more flavor, but possibly could have not been as pronounced due to the broth.  Beef was plentiful and well seasoned.  Tempura was obviously batch fried ahead of time, but the zucchini was so soggy.  It was not enjoyable.  Shrimp was better but again would've been better more fresh.  Unlike the Hawaii Marukame, they don't have spam musubi here.  \n\nI hope they improve their service as time goes on since Marukame in Hawaii has a lot longer of a line but is a well oiled machine to get people in and out quicker.

Came here around 11:30 and we already walked right through the front door. I always wanted to come here, but reading reviews saying the wait was long, I never came. But today was the day! \nThey have enough variety of udons. Once you order a bowl of your choice, there's fresh tempura waiting for you! You can choose what tempura you want for your side (price ranging from $1.50-1.80). They also make rice balls. \nThe udon is pretty good. Its not too soft and it has the right chewiness. They don't add green onions for you, but they have a booth where you can add your green onions. \nThe tables and floors were clean. On top of that, there was always someone ready to wipe the tables.

We called ahead thinking we needed reservations for a table, but it's basically first come first serve. There wasn't an entirely long line when we got there; we waited about 20 minutes in line before we got to the counter to order. Tables were also consistently kept clean, making it a little easier to get seats.\n\nThe way this eatery works is basically like a cafeteria. You start off by grabbing a tray and ordering your udon noodles. Once you get your udon at the end of the line, you continue down the tempura bar. There was a bunch of options and what I liked most is that they constantly replenished the supply of all the different types of tempura. My total came out to be about $15 so I definitely think it was a bang for your buck. After you're done paying there's a sauce bar/topping bar across from the soda machines. I added a little more tempura flakes and some chili on top of my soup, and the tempura sauce. \n\nI got the regular sized egg drop chicken udon soup as well as the potato croquette, sweet potato tempura, and fish cake tempura. The regular size was pretty filling, even for some of my pals who are hefty eaters lol. The potato croquette was really good and didn't really need the sauce imo. The sweet potato tempura and the fish cake tempura were also both really good, but tasted even better with the tempura sauce.\n\nOverall, my whole group was completely satisfied with their meals here, and would come back again!", "author": "Cass V."}

How unfortunate, but it's cool I'm not trippin. \n\nUdon, udon, udon... fresh? yes, you can literally see them when you walk inside. Although whenever I now see the workers handling those noodles with their bare hands, i start to think of the negative part of it.. i just look away before i get cringy ha ha maybe that's how it's supposed to be done? i don't know, i'm not an expert. I've tired most of their menu besides the new ones like their tofu salad, i think it was. anywho, they're not too bad just not a fan of their spicy chicken thai udon (i don't remember something like that) it wasn't spicy for me and it tasted a bit watered down. but I mainly crave their curry udon. I love love LOVE curry any to be exact with udon? even better! order that if it's your first time or have yet to try and make sure to add an egg, and lots of scallions + tempura flakes. if you're into that. mix everything and voila, you get perfection. or maybe a trip to the couch from being so bloated. I always have to get the inari too! like literally! every time i'm here it's a must. dip that into the curry sauce, YUM! \n\nVery affordable, especially for students.. they picked the perfect location in Stonestown, where SF state, CCSF and high school students is nearby. prepare yourself with sworming high school kids throughout the day when school is over and they come here to eat. they're just everywhere in Stonestown running around. lol at least the line isn't as long as dinner gets. pfeww, not coming here during those hours esp if you're very hungry although they are fast. i got hangry once waiting in the second line (yup, they have two separate lines).. \n\nThe workers are always so nice, from what i've notice when i'm here often. they would greet you when you come in and so polite.. some workers even took our tray when my friend and i were on our way to put them into the dirty plate station. how nice of those two gentlemen. they deserve tips in this place. then again it's a fast food japanese resto. \n\nDef. would come back when obvi I crave more curry udon and inari!

Once we arrived and saw the horrendous line though, we both agreed that we should try something else. Anyways, the date was meh, so to salvage my afternoon, I circled back and hopped in the (now shorter) line so that my whole Sunday wouldn't be a wash. \n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n2/2 Stars for Taste --\nWhile I was waiting in line, I heard someone say \"The nikutame is really the only thing worth getting\". I had already decided that was what I wanted, but it's always nice to get some validation. Let's start with the star of the show -- the udon. You can watch them making it fresh at the front of the line. Chewy, almost succulently plump, long noodles. I would eat these noodles plain, that's how satisfying the texture is. The sweet/savory broth was the perfect accompaniment. I love sweet beef because it reminds me of the Yoshinoya excursions of my childhood. Also, the soft-boiled egg was surprisingly delicious. They cracked it straight from the shell into my bowl -- HOW? An engineering marvel. It was served cold, a perfect contrast to the hot soup, almost like an umami custard. Also, let's not forget the complimentary toppings bar. I tried not to overdo it with the green onions and fried crispies...but it was a damn near thing. I didn't try any tempura or onigiri this time around because I'm not the biggest fan of fried things or rice (I'm a bad Asian), but maybe next time if I bring friends!\n\n1/1 Stars for Value --\nI thought I would be hungry after ordering the regular, but there is a surprisingly quantity of noodles hidden in that bowl! The noodles absorb the soup fast, so it almost feels like a race to finish before all the soup disappears. I'm someone who prefers a higher broth to noodle ratio, so I almost wish they gave me a bit more soup, but I imagine it would be sodium overload. I think the complimentary toppings bar with green onions, cilantro, fried crispies, and a myriad of dipping sauces is a nice touch. I mean, the tempura sauce comes in a coffee dispenser. Magical. All this for less than $10? Life-changing.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nThe line is broken up into three segments so as not to block up the sidewalk. When I got in line, I was at the end of the second segment, and it took me about 30 minutes to place my order. Once you order though, everything moves real quick -- you pick up your bowl of noodles, select the various accoutrements (onigiri, tempura), then pay for the mountain of food you've inevitably accumulated. The free soda with Yelp check-in is dope too.\n\nBonus star because I've already promised my parents that I'll take them...maybe during a weekday when the line isn't as insane.\n\nTL;DR -- CHEWY DELICIOUS NOODLES. Try the nikutame! Expect to wait at least 30-45 minutes during busy times.", "author": "Abby W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-17", "description": "I love this place on a religious level! First lets start with the portions. Large is actually LARGE! And its not that much more expensive than a regular, so why not?! Also the pricing is very reasonable. I dont quite remember but the range is around 10-12 for a large depending on what type of udon you get. Second, the quality of the udon is phenomenal. If you've only had udon in a generic sushi restaurant, I definitely recommend giving this place a try as it is definitely something different. The place also has fantastic tempura. However, some tempura is more expensive than others, such as the shrimp. Regardless I believe all the tempura is fantastic so I usually i just get the cheaper ones such as the cod, chicken, etc. The also have rice balls which are neatly wrapped in a to-go fashion. I've had some friends say the rice balls have too much rice and not enough meat, but hey, I'm a lover of carbs and seaweed so I don't really mind. I recommend getting the crab meat rice ball. In the end, i usually end up with a large udon, around 4 pieces of tempura, and 2 riceballs. If I remember correctly, I only paid around 18 dollars with that, which, in my opinion, is a STEAL considering the quality you are getting. There's also a complimentary condiment(?) section where you can get panko flakes and green onions to put on your udon. \n\nDespite a long line at any given time, the line actually moves at an efficient pace. The restaurant is set as a cafeteria style, so you get your food, pay for it, and then sit down. Despite constantly having a line, I've never had trouble finding a table after I pay. I dont know why, but I guess the system works. The decor is also nice and waiters usually clean up after people leave, so there's rarely ever a mess after a party is done. All in all, I definitely recommend this place. I take every opportunity to come here every time I'm in the area.", "author": "Tim W."}

I believe this is the same as the famous Marukame Udon in Waikiki in Hawaii. \n\nThe wait was not as long as I expected. I had read reviews before going here, saying the wait would be an hour, at least. We actually only waited about 30 min. It was a Sunday in the late afternoon and we saw that the line wasn't long, so we took our chance and waited, which worked out great! However, when we had our food and looked out the window, the line had gotten way longer, so we definitely got lucky. \n\nI ordered the Nikutama Udon hot. I also got the chicken karage and a salmon rice ball on the side. There was ample seating, so we were able to get a table right away. \n\nThe Nikutama Udon came with beef and a poached egg. I thought they would ask me if I wanted to add green onion, but they never did. We had to go to the another table after we paid to get the green onion and other toppings (like crunchy tempura bits). The green onion wasn't sliced very thin. It was actually very chunky, which is different to what is pictured on the menu. There were a lot of pieces of green onion that weren't sliced at all, just a large chunk of green onion. I ended up not adding any green onion and only added the tempura bits. \n\nThe udon itself was good. The broth was nice, and the udon noodles were chewy and definitely tasty. The beef was flavorful as well. The thinly sliced green onion would have definitely made the udon more enjoyable.\n\nChicken karage was lukewarm and the batter wasn't crunchy anymore. It was most likely an older piece of karage. The chicken still tasted okay, though. And the salmon rice ball was just alright. Salmon was really salty, but it tasted okay with the seaweed and rice. \n\nTo be fair, I have very high expectations, having just tried the Marakuma Udon in Waikiki, which was such an awesome experience. This place was okay, and I think it's worth trying once, especially if you've never been to the one in Waikiki.", "author": "Nikki P."}

At 2pm on a Saturday, we waited about half an hour until we reached the assembly line. The wait was not too bad, but having to wait outside in the cold and wind was not fun.\n\nOnce you make it inside, the process is cafeteria-styled and quite streamlined: You grab a tray, choose from a selection of hot or cold udon preparations in regular or large, and then add on as many rice balls and pieces of batter-fried tempura as you care to have on the side. The basic Kake Udon starts off at only $5.50 for a bowl, but with the additional beef and soft-boiled egg; this bowl has become the Nikatama Udon at $8.50. I picked the latter as I need my meat and I'm a sucker for a soft-boiled egg. It was really cool to watch them make the udon as the bowl made it onto my tray though.\n\nThe part that really eats your money is the additional sides. With the tempura ranging from $1-2, be careful as it does add up. I added a fishcake tempura ($1.70), sweet potato tempura ($1.30), and salmon musubi ($1.60) that left me with a $15 meal --not so cheap anymore. And to be frank, the tempura was a-okay and lacked much flavor. Even the musubi was quite disappointing with minimal meat. If you're looking for a plain riceball, that's what you're getting here.\n\nAfter paying the cashier, there's a condiment bar to add on some extra free toppings: green onions, cilantro, grated ginger, shoyu, hot sauce, and tempura sauce. For the tempura sauce, definitely go for their sweet version --it's thicker and more flavored almost like a unagi sauce. Finally, you find yourself a seat to enjoy your meal before dropping off your dirty dishes at the counter.\n\nI have to say that the udon was incredibly fresh, silky, and delicious! I especially loved how the soft-boiled egg mixed into my udon for a creamy flavor while the thinly sliced beef gave the perfect contrast to the udon. Next time, I'd definitely opt out of all the batter-fried goods and riceballs though. Also tried some of my friend's curry udon, which was tasty as well. It's more of a soupy consistency for the udon, which was suitable as a broth.

The cold offered a sharper taste and was perfect to accompany a sunny day. Another favorite of this bowl would the difference of noodle texture. The cold noodles are bouncier and chewier, which picked up more of the sauce. \n\nThe tempura was decent, but was not as good as the Hawaii location.

He was telling me how often this place has a very long line...we waited about 15 minutes. Not too bad. They were conscious in the sense of placing what they offered on their menu along the line. I can only imagine that this makes placing your order easier and boost the efficiency of service.\n\nThey offer a handful of options in terms of broth and fixings. Unfortunately, the only vegetarian option they offer is a cold udon with edamame salsa. I'm glad I asked about the broths...I can only assume that they're fish, maybe chicken, based. The edamame udon was good...very saucy, maybe too saucy, but I typically enjoy food extra hot. *My fault* for ordering a cold dish, but it was the only one available to me.  In addition to the udon, I contemplated getting a potato croquette and some veggie tempura. I opted for the Inari instead when I saw the potato croquettes stacked with the breaded seafood. I didn't like seeing the veg items mingling with the meat items. They were likely fried together. Speaking with family and friends about this place, they all have the same suggestion...that the broth is not hot enough. Perhaps it's a safety issue? There are indeed, careless customers that are at risk of burning themselves. \n\nI think as a vegetarian/vegan, this place does not really make sense. I can appreciate the value, and the crowds that it can bring, but it falls short when it comes to dietary preferences. Maybe I can give it another try if/when there is a vegetarian broth.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

So uh, these were so bouncy it made me bounce like a basketball (get the reference? LOL)\n\n#3 Curry Udon Regular- $6.90: very flavorful with beef as well.

We ordered the Tonkotsu Udon, Kaikitama Udon, and Nikutama Udon.\nThe Tonkotsu Udon was okay, the broth was nothing special, but the vegetable tempura was good.  The Nikutama Udon was surprisingly sweet in both broth and meat.  The meat reminded me of bulgogi.  The egg that came with it was cooked nice and soft and runny.

Hand pulled and perfect udon noodles, made right in front of your very eyes while you wait to order, cafeteria style.\n\nMentai udon. One of the orders that probably doesn't get enough hype, but I think this is my favorite of the lot. Not soupy, but the eggs are delicious and creamy with the egg yolk. Heavy with green onions and the side of sauce that available, I think this is the most balanced and delicious thing on the menu here.\n\nCurry udon was always a favorite of mine. Light curry, but pretty salty. Not your usual udon flavor but I like it with the tempura chips they offer.\n\nNikutama udon. Clearly a fan favorite for a good reason. The sweet beef is tender and delicious. The broth is lightly salt to coat the udon and give everything that you want in a bowl of noodles. The udon here is chewy and done right. You can't go wrong with this order.\n\nObjectively a very good udon place. Cheap food, with good tempura. The wait has died down to maybe 25 minute wait for a weekday dinner. Much better than the 2 hour wait when it first opened. The only caveat that I have is that they don't have the soft boiled egg tempura from the original, which was a game changer.

Eat it for yourself, you'll enjoy it! The line looks long but, it goes by really fast. If you've had their other locations first, i don't think it compares.\n\nLet me start this review by saying I'm not an advent lover of udon and most i've had wasn't really that good. My partner Swore by Marukame Udon in Hawaii and trying that version for the first time, it blew my mind and made this fast food style my favorite. Every time we came in to the Marukame udon and trying the different style dishes they offered was like a new experience, everytime. Hearing that they opened a location in the city, I had to try it. My review for Marugame Udon.\n\nThe good:\nThe location is settled in Stonestown Galleria, a mall with plenty of parking. The line looks really long but, like the Waikiki location zooms by really fast. Price is the same as the hawaii location and along with the set up of the establishment. so, what gives? why the 3 star rating (more like 3.5) why not a 4 star rating? Well, it just didn't give me the wow factor my taste buds were yearning for.\n\nThe food:\n\nI ordered the Cold Nikutama Udon. I must have not said cold loud enough because I got the hot version (that's my fault). The udon noodles are made in house and you can see them taking a block out, kneading it, resting it, cook it, and cool it right in front of your eyes as you wait in line. The broth is flavorful but, a little on the salty side but, luckily the sweetness of the beef evened it out. The sou vide egg was perfect. \n\nThe broth was served luke warm but probably from the cooling of the udon noodles. The quality of the toppings didn't seem up to par and if you've eaten in the hawaii's location you can instantly tell the difference in quality. The green onions were cut semi-thick and were dried up and sitting out (Waikiki's green onion looked fresh and cut so thinly that it looked shaved), the tempura have been sitting out and the oils collected on the bottom.\n\nFor the sides, I enjoyed the Inari and Musubi. I didn't really care for the squid, Tempura shrimp (too much batter), and the potato croquette (tasted too mushy).\n\nEnd food review\n\nThe udon is still better than most out there. If this is your first time trying Marukame/Marugame Udon, you'll love it. But, if you have tried the other locations i don't think it compares.", "author": "Alex T."}

All of the bowls I've had so far is delicious. \n\nTheir classic hot Bukkake Udon is simple and a relatively inexpensive meal. Just add a piece or two of tempura/onigiri and you easily have a filling meal that's less than $10. \n\nThe Thai Spicy Chicken Udon is also tasty. It's a sour spicy, so if that's not your thing I wouldn't recommend this. \n\nThe sides (tempura and onigiri) are okay. The onigiris could use a little more filling. After a bite, you're left with a bunch of rice. These are also pretty dangerous. The first time I went, I went overboard and ended getting way more than I could finish.", "author": "Christine F."}

Ever since I visited the Honolulu location (multiple times during my trip) I have wanted udon to become big here in the bay. So happy they have opened a location! I'm bummed it's a little far from me, but at least it's in a mall so there's parking. I visited on a Friday so we didn't have to wait too long. What is great about this location is that it greatly improves upon the Honolulu location. It's a big space, and since it's cafeteria style, it's easy to customize your meal. Scallions, cilantro and tempura flakes can be added after you pay. There are many communal tables and even outdoor seating. My personal favorite is the cold udon with beef and soft boiled egg. Next time I will try the mentaiko udon, that looked delicious! They also have onigiri and I got the mentaiko which was super yummy.\n\nIf you plan on getting tempura sides stick to a regular size for your udon. We tend to order with our eyes and get more then we actually can eat (my leftovers kept pretty well so, that worked for me)\n\nThe udon here is so good, cooked perfectly and slightly chewier then what I've had here in America.

The udon gods must be on my side because I only waited for about 30 mins which isn't terrible considering how I heard people waited for much longer. \n\nI think it's pretty cool how it's cafeteria style and you move along a line. I got the regular beef udon and also grabbed a seafood tempura and potato croquette. The regular sized beef udon is more than enough if you want to enjoy tempuras and their other offerings. I would suggest not getting too greedy as the price adds up quickly per tempura (I think it was almost $2 per tempura). \n\nThe broth for the beef udon was good. Light and flavorful- perfect for a foggy SF day. However, their udon was a bit soft for my liking. Not sure if it's suppose to be like that or I waited too long to eat it. The beef was flavorful too, but they weren't that generous (even though it looked it in the photo). \n\nSeafood tempura was good and I liked the sweet tempura sauce you can get at the station.

Definitely wasn't expecting it to be that quick but glad it moved that fast. I would say there was probably about 30 people ahead of us. I didn't know until I got inside that it's like a cafeteria style restaurant. You start by telling them which udon bowl you want and the rest of the line up until the cashier you can pick and choose what tempuras you want. I got the shrimp, fish cake and fish. All decent. There's also some freshly made onigiris at the end that you can grab. After you pay for the food, there's a condiments bar where you can get your green onions, cilantro, grated ginger, tempura sauce and tempura flakes. This is awesome, I really liked this. After assembling your tray, it can be a challenge finding a place to sit. I can see finding a seat being really annoying during the lunch and dinner rushes. \n\nAfter getting seating, I of course had to take a sip of the broth to gauge the flavor. It's a very light soy saucy kind of broth. It was a bit sweet but that's probably because I got the beef. I threw a buttload of green onions into the bowl and got a lot of the ginger on the side. The noodles are amazing and super fresh. When you order your bowl you can see them make and cook the noodles in front of you. The tempura were all decently good. As I was picking what I wanted they ran out of some vegetables so I was little disappointed there. I ended up getting a bunch of seafood. The shrimp tempura was good. Tasted like any other shrimp tempura really. The fish tempura I thought was awesome. You can see the little fish tail at the end, nice and crispy. The fish cake I thought was all right but I only got it because there wasn't any fried asparagus available. \n\nWhen you finish, you need to bus the trays yourself which is located behind the condiments bar.

Our party of three came on a Saturday night and it took about 45 minutes until we were able to order. The line can run out the door, and is sectioned off in two parts outside to avoid blocking the walkway. Once you get inside, the place functions as a cafeteria and being able to watch them make the udon noodles as you continue down the line makes for a pretty cool experience!\n\nWe ordered the Tonkotsu, Nikutama, and Mentai Kamatama Udon and loved all of them - each had its own distinct flavor and the noodles were perfectly chewy. The Mentai can be a bit salty, so we poured in only half of the sauce that came with it. We were starving, and the regular size was pretty filling!

Came 8pm on a Sunday night, the second attempt at this- still a half hour wait since there was a long line.\n\nHow it works: it basically works as an assembly line, where you pick up a tray, tell the workers what you want, pick up your finished udon, pick up tempura and / or onigiri, and then pay.  There is also a spot to put condiments on your udon.  Large portion is almost 2x the size of the regular in terms of amount of noodles.  \n\nVenue / Service: Very brightly lit inside with light wood accents.  What surprised us the most was the fact that the number of people coming in matched the number of people going out; I never saw anyone with their tray waiting for a seat!  Service-wise, it's hard to tell but they seemed friendly enough.  Only critique was that they seemed a bit inconsistent with how much broth each bowl got- I had a large amount of broth while my date got half a bowl of broth (and we both ordered large sized portions).  \n\n-- Large-sized Beef Udon ($8.90) - large is quite large; think twice before ordering it if you want tempura and such!  Nevertheless, the broth for the beef udon was delicious- light in color and taste but still flavorful!  Noodles were well cooked for me as well.  I highly recommend adding scallions on top for a bit of freshness.  \n\n-- Assorted Tempura ($1.30 for sweet potato and $1.90 for shrimp, per piece) - tempura were all quite tasty!  Also liked how they weren't too oily and such; also appreciated how the sweet potato tempura (my favorite) was given in large slices!\n\n--  Salmon onigiri ($1.60 each) - a bit much if you have a large portion udon but I liked my onigiri.  A bit inconsistent with the filling however; my date noted how his crab onigiri had only crab at the top and the rest was rice while mine had a good amount of salmon throughout it.

Probably a 20 min wait honestly. \n\nTheir menu is posted outside and at the door so you're able to really figure out what you want before you reach the counter. All dishes are udon. There is no other option which sort of sucks because my boyfriend isn't a big soup person so I can't really see myself bringing him here but between my mom and I, I got a regular #1 which was the udon in the wooden bowl and my mom opted for their beef udon. \n\nThe process is pretty cool, I suppose. You grab your tray and a side dish and then you can watch the person make the udon by hand as you're ordering. Put your tray up on the mat and the person will place your bowl of udon on top of it then you grab your tray and continue down the line to all their tempura and musubi options. Be wary and keep your eyes peeled. Everything is by the piece so don't go too wild unless you can afford to then why listen to me at all. \n\n6pm on a Tuesday night and they're out of curry. I wanted to bring home a large curry udon to my dad, but they were out. Asked if I could order it later, maybe when they make more? Girl taking the orders said, \"we won't have any.\" 6pm on a Tuesday. When you're opened till 11. Really? Ooookay. \n\nAfter you're done grabbing your side dishes you pay and from there you can bring it to the little stand that's off to the side to sprinkle your tempura flakes and green onion into your udon. Tempura sauce and utensils are also located on the same stand. Eat and once you're done you clean up after yourself and place your trays and bowls in the designated area. A little confused on how this is done as there were workers helping when I was eating and when it came time to clean up, no worker assisted and I was stuck with a group of people who were all trying to figure out what piece of trash went into which bin. \n\nAlso at one point there was just a giant gap in the line which I could see why the line would take a while to move now as at one point they were scrambling to make more udon leaving people to wait. \n\nOverall, it's a pass. My friend raved about how good this place was the day prior to me and I wish he was right but I felt no joy in eating the food. The broth for #1 was legit water and even though they added a sauce to the side there was not much to rave about. I didn't eat the tempura, but my mom did and she said it wasn't worth it at almost $2 a piece.", "author": "Venus L."}

That means I don't have to book a flight to Hawaii anymore just to get my Marugame fix!!! \n\nJust to warn you, the line is usually out the door, especially during prime lunch and dinner hours. If you're lucky, you'll spend the majority of your time waiting in the sun. But when Karl the Fog rolls into SF, a jacket is necessary to survive the cold outside- so think ahead and bring a light jacket! I went on a late Thursday evening an hour before closing. Even though it was 10 pm, there was still a line with about 10 people in front of me and I still had to stand outside in the cold- good thing I wore a coat that night. To cut down the wait time, I would recommend coming here right before closing. But if you decide to go during the busy hours, don't worry too much since the line moves fairly quickly. \n\nThe \"cafeteria style\" makes the whole ordering process a little more efficient. When you're standing in line by the door, you'll notice the chefs preparing udon from scratch. Once you get to the ordering window, simply tell them which udon combo you want and they'll make it fresh to order. After you receive the bowl of udon from the window, pick up a couples pieces of tempura and/or onigiri. There's variety of tempura to choose from including squid, sweet potato, zucchini, vegetable croquette, and more. After, don't forget to head over to the complimentary station bar to upgrade your bowl of udon with green onions, cilantro, crunchy tempura flakes. \n\nDuring my first visit, my friend and I both ordered a hot bowl of plain Bukkake udon. I grabbed few pieces of tempura (sweet potato, squid, vegetable croquette) and a salmon onigiri on the side. In my opinion, the tempura was alright, nothing too special. I prefer my tempura to be super hot and fresh out of the frier, not warm under the heat lamp. The batter was a little too thick for my liking, and it lost some of its crunchy texture since it was only warm. Out of the tempuras I had selected, I liked the vegetable croquette the best. If you like onions, this one is for you since it contains mostly onions and shredded carrots! My favorite part of the meal was, of course, the udon! I was able to taste the high-quality ingredients and freshness in the udon. The udon noodles were smooth, soft, and had the perfect chew to it. It was delicious!     \n\nWhat's not to love about Marugame Udon? The prices are very reasonable and the food is super fresh and delicious! The only downside is the long line, but if you have some time to spare, wait it out so you can have a taste of the udon!", "author": "Michelle F."}

I was eager to try this location because my first experience at Marugame Udon was in Hawaii two months ago. In Hawaii, there was a long line as well, and I devoured that bowl of udon. It was mouthwatering and overall, the best meal I had in Hawaii. So setting my standards quite high, I was looking forward to this location.\n\nIt's easy to find with ample mall parking. Located next to a Chipotle. I came here on Easter night and the rest of the mall was closed, but to my surprise, the restaurant was not, thankfully. The line wrapped around a few times, but I waited no more than 30 mins like I did in Hawaii. You order in a single file line as you see the staff create orders right in front of you. Once you actually make your way into the restaurant, the rest of line goes by quickly. \n\nIt was a bit difficult to find seating for two. I managed to find one somewhat quickly after clearing the table myself. I saw this group of 4 making a dispute and almost forcing this table to hurry up and leave. As for actual food, I was underwhelmed. It was salty and the flavors I expected weren't there. Even after a long day, I found myself struggling to finish my bowl. I'd come back here again because it's cheap and affordable. But I'm sad I have to lower my standards.", "author": "Janet S."}

So if it's your first time here, you'll have to know the basics: \n* Expect long waits (come 30 min before opening is what I recommend)\n* But also expect fresh udon made to order right in front of you, amazing tempura selection fried to a crisp, and a topping area to decorate your udon bowl. \n* Reasonable prices with each bowl ranging from $7-$9. Two bowls of udon + 7 pieces of tempura added to about $32 for us two. But it was more than enough food. \n* Always super friendly staff who greet you in Japanese. \n\nUdon here is SOLID. Tempura is even better. Rice balls are underwhelming though. My main complaint is the amount of salt in the udon. The top half of the bowl of udon (mostly without broth) is spot on. The noodles taste fresh- nothing like packaged instant udon. The meat is so soft and tender. The beef was perfectly marinated in a light soy sauce. However, the bottom half of the bowl was extremely salty. My date agreed as well, so naturally we added water to drown out the salt. The \"soft boiled egg\" was overcooked but my date's egg was perfectly soft boiled. A bit inconsistent on the egg cooking but not a huge deal breaker for me. \n\nSome of my favorite tempura: Fried squid, potato croquette, and fried fishcake. \nPass on the chicken karage, shrimp, and aji fry.\n\nService is excellent! The staff are extremely efficient and keep the line moving. We were the very first customers of the day and we felt so welcomed. \n\nInterior is really clean and sleek. Not to mention, the short chairs with the cushions are really comfortable. There's booths, tables, as well as limited patio seating. Parking is easy since this location is right outside of a shopping mall. \n\nConsidering the many many great places to eat in SF, I wouldn't say Marugame Udon is a *must* But if  you really like udon and tempura, definitely check this place out. Come for the awesome cafeteria style service and delicious noodles. \n\nTip: It is first-come, first-serve. No reservations and no calling ahead!", "author": "Sandra N."}

But then I discovered Marukame during my trip to Oahu and I was changed. My family and I loved it so much that we came back two days later. And, I was ecstatic to learn upon my return to SF about their soft opening right in the city!\n\nI love this place because it's fast, affordable, and the quality of food is top notch. It is \"self-serve cafeteria-style\" meaning you line up, order your udon, select your a la carte tempura sides, pay, then find a seat. It's a very efficient process and I've almost never had a problem finding seats since people rotate out so quickly. \n\nIn the span of a couple months, I had been to Marugame / Marukame four times. I've tried most of the udons on the menu but my all-time favorite is the Nikutama. It comes with sweet beef and a poached egg, which are the perfect additions to the already perfectly flavored broth and perfectly chewy noodles. Also, the udon is made right in front of you so it is super fresh!   \n\nBoth times I went to the SF-location was around 9pm on a weekend and the line took a bit over 30 minutes.

From my understanding, this is all the same chain and they opened two new spots, one in SF and one in LA. \n\nThis store is located at Stonestown Galleria, an extremely busy shopping center next to SF State. There's tons of parking available, but be prepared to park a little far and walk, especially if you go on the weekend. When you arrive, there's more than likely going to be a line. The line is split into two parts so that people don't block the walkway. There's generally a staff member outside to let you know. Be prepared to wait 45 minutes - 1 hour most days.\n\nWhat I love about this place is that they make their udon fresh! You can see them make everything as you go through the line. You know what you're getting is as fresh as it can be! The udon is so good and has the perfect texture and firmness.\n\nI've tried both the Nikutama udon and the curry udon. Both are amazing in their own way. The Nikutama comes with their beef, a soft boiled egg and some Kake sauce. This is a very simple dish yet so delicious. The curry udon comes with beef and their curry soup. The soup is a little on the thicker side, but there's so much flavor. \n\nAs you go through the line, you have the option to get some various tempura or musubi on the side. I personally like the potato croquette and the fish cake. After you pay, they have unlimited tempura flakes, cilantro and green onion toppings.\n\nOverall, a great place for udon, arguably the best in the Bay Area in my opinion.

I know some people miss this from Hawaii, but seeing how much shorter the lines have become since opening makes me wonder if it's as good as the original.\n\nOnce inside, you follow the line cafeteria-style where you make your order and size. They portion the udon and give you your order, where you proceed to stock up on various tempura and savory sides. You pay, then load up on complimentary unlimited green onions, ginger, and sauce.\n\nFinding seating, of course, depends on how busy the place is. It didn't seem too hard to find a seat despite it being crowded, though some seats can be sticky from previous patrons.\n\nAs for me, I've gotten the beef udon twice. I remember the items with the largest photos are \"the most popular\", but they sound too fancy for me haha. In short, the udon is plenty and very delicious - and the broth is a little sweet/salty that tastes really good at first, but then weighs you down as you end your meal.

During my wait, I was able to watch them prepare the udon noodles. Boil, boil, boil the noodles are so plump and pretty! I like that the bowls are prewarmed before it's filled with hot broth to keep your food warmer for longer. I decided to go for the classic Beef Udon; thinly sliced beef, broth, scallions and udon noodles. For tempura, I just grabbed one Shrimp Tempura to try. The Udon broth was pretty good, savory and clean, slightly sweet tasting and not cloyingly oily. The beef was sliced thin, was tender and good flavor, but wish they gave a little bit more beef. The udon is where it's at, I don't know if I was just wowed by watching them prep the udon in the open kitchen but the noodles were amazing. Great texture, nice bite and not mushy at all. The tempura here had great texture, batter wasn't too thick and tasted soo good when dipped in the broth.

I came here on a Saturday night and the wait was over one hour in the freezing cold. When I finally got in the door, I was getting more and more excited. I ordered the large Nikutama Udon ($9.50) and then selected shrimp, zucchini, and squid tempura along the self-select stations.\n\nWhat I like most about Marugame is that their udon noodles are fresh, made right in front of you, and have perfect texture. I also like the taste of their sweet beef and broth. Another plus is that you can choose your own tempuras and other add-ons individually. Their self-serve toppings bar of green onion, cilantro, ginger, and tempura flakes is a fun addition. \n\nWhat I did not like about Marugame is that they didn't give much broth with our noodles (I like a lot of broth), the tempura by itself was bland (only tastes decent in tempura dipping sauce), the long wait (obviously), and... when it was time to pay, I saw the cashier's screen which had the correct total. After I gave the cashier my credit card, he quickly added one more piece of zucchini tempura, then slid my card very fast. I called him out on it and then he did refund me the overcharged tempura, but it seemed very shady. If I didn't pay attention, he probably would have gotten away with it. Just make sure to check your receipt. \n\nOverall, the udon noodles itself are pretty good. The regular size might have a better noodle to broth ratio, but the large bowl is so much more worth it (only one dollar more for almost double the amount of noodles). The broth and beef are great with the udon, but it doesn't have an absolute wow factor. Plus, we want more of it.

And all my life, my soul has died a little thinking of the mediocre food that's been at this mall (RIP Chevy's, good riddance Blue C Sushi). At this point, I've had Nordstrom Cafe's entire menu and have borderline OD'd on clam chowder from Boudin.\n\nWhen I heard Marugame Udon opened up--and that it was doing well and was actually really good--I rejoiced. I envisioned myself walking to the mall, casually grabbing a delicious bowl of udon, loving life in Lakeshore.\n\nWell, we're not there yet, but the future is promising. Marugame Udon opens at 11am. On a Monday, my friend and I showed up at 10:30am to line up based on Yelp reviews. There was already a long line of people waiting (how everyone's free at this hour on a weekday is beyond me). They opened right on time and started funneling people in - luckily, we made it in the first wave.\n\nThe order process is cafeteria style, with a person behind the counter taking your udon order, making it, then handing it to you. You then move down the line to the tempura and musubi station to pick your \"sides.\" The process is interesting, but definitely has some growing pains right now. The staff is still learning - I'm pretty sure I got asked for my udon order 4 times within the span of a few minutes. I can't help but think there should be a way to automate that process instead of having the person ask a few people's orders, and then forget it right away. I hope they can figure out how to streamline this process so that they don't have a bottleneck right at the entrance.\n\nOnto the food - I got #5 beef udon and added a few toppings. I also got shrimp, fish cake, and zucchini tempura. All were delicious. The noodles are SO good! The perfect texture. The soup is sweet but exactly what I expected. I did find myself feeling really thirsty afterwards, so not sure about the sodium content there... but ah well. The shrimp tempura was so fresh! I was pleasantly surprised to find that the batter was not soggy at all.\n\nSince this place is new and so popular, the line doesn't seem like it'll die down any time soon. I definitely wouldn't wait more than an hour for this place, but if you have the time to spare and can arrive early, it's worth a try. I'm sooo happy this place opened in Stonestown!", "author": "Alyssa T."}

Guess that's the benefit of going on a weekday when everyone's at school/work. You can expect to wait a while on weekends or dinner time probably. We only waited for 20 mins or less which wasn't too bad, honestly. The wait was primarily due to the cafeteria-style design of the ordering process. It wasn't because people were waiting on tables to clear up. There were plenty of seats available, even when we were out the door. Udon is pretty easy and quick meal. \n\nYou start off by choosing which type of udon you want and what size. We tried their curry udon and their nikutama udon, both large sizes. They weigh the udon noodles. After you receive your udon bowl, which is made to order, it's pretty much self-serve from there. There are different types of tempuras and musubis to grab and go along the way to the cashier. I tried their shrimp tempura and zucchini tempura. My boyfriend got their fish cake tempura and one of their salmon musubis. After you pay, you can go to the self-serve topping bar for additional toppings like tempura flakes, green onion, tempura sauce, sweet tempura sauce (tasted like katsu sauce to me), etc. \n\nThe curry udon was good. It tasted like what I expected. The noodles were soft and chewy. I think next time I would go with the nikutama udon, just because it's a little lighter in flavor! I could barely finish my udon. After reading some reviews, I found out that they serve the same amount of noodles for both the small/large sizes and the only difference is the amount of soup they give in each bowl. If that's true, I would've totally gotten the small. I don't drink the soup anyways... \n\nI don't recommend getting the musubis at all. The salmon musubi barely had any salmon (maybe just a pinch on the top) and the rest was all rice. Wasn't worth it.\n\nI don't think they allow you to reserve seats for your party either. You have to have your food already to sit down and eat. It makes sense though.\n\nAll in all, it was a good experience. I would only come again if there wasn't a wait, lol.", "author": "Sydney C."}

When we got there for Sunday lunch, the line was already huge and we ended up waiting about 30 minutes. Definitely worth the wait!\n\nI love that as you go through the line inside, you can see the chefs making the udon from scratch. You pick your udon, then there's an area of self-serve tempura and then self-serve condiments/toppings. \n\nNIKUTAMA UDON ($8.50): Comes with beef and an egg. This one is sauce based versus the Beef Udon, which is soup based. It has less volume of liquid than the Beef Udon because the sauce base is more concentrated so if you're more of a soup person I'd go for the Beef Udon, otherwise this one is great and has a strong flavor. \n\nVEGETABLE TEMPURA ($1.70): It's a mix of carrots, onions, and sweet potatoes. I wish the tempura was more fresh because the one I got was very soggy and not crispy at all.\n\nPOTATO CROQUETTE ($2.20) : Decent tasting but next time I would probably get something else. It's super filling and dense so with the udon it was definitely way too much food. \n\nSHRIMP TEMPURA ($1.90) : This is probably the most popular because when I got to it, there was no more so I had one freshly made and super crispy.

I stopped by here yesterday with a friend - weekday night about 6pm - the wait was 45 min. and 110% worth it :) \n\nIt's almost a little nostalgic the way this place is organized - like you're walking through a school cafeteria line and picking up food items along the way (except exponentially more delicious and drool worthy!). I really enjoyed it though, as you get front row seats for the full udon making process! Open seating when you're done, again just like cafeteria/food court style and when you're done, just bring your trays up to the front! \n\nI wouldn't mind waiting for this place at all - the food is inexpensive (you can get a really good - I mean REALLY good bowl of udon for as little as $4.50!). As affordable as that sounds, I wouldn't deprive myself of all the crunchy, fried goodness waiting for me after I order my noodles and continue my meandering along the line! It's a tempura haven after you get your order of udon - tempura sweet potato, chicken, fishcakes, shrimp, squid, vegetable balls, zucchini etc. etc. I checked out the menu beforehand and I was still not prepared for all those options (all around the $1.80ish range). In my excitement I definitely over-grabbed, but rest assured I have no regrets about that! They also sell musubi, which in actuality I would say should be called a riceball not musubi! Grabbed myself a salmon one of course! ;D (Tip: don't forget to use the tongs when grabbing!). \n\nTo get to the nitty-gritty - Nikutama Udon. The #2. It is everything I would want it to be and more. I hope they never raise the prices but this udon was worth so much more than the $8.50 I paid for a regular bowl. Udon cooked EXACTLY right (I'm looking at you, Tsuortontan in NY!) mixed with the most amazing kake sauce, soft boiled egg, and a super healthy portion of sweetened beef. The flavors just mixed so well together - I'm a savory person, but the sweetness level didn't bother me at all and in fact I rather enjoyed it! The regular was really filling and I just can't get over how happy that udon made me feel - warm, soft-chewy, perfection. This place really knows how to do udon.

I really wanted to like it, but unfortunately, it was severely over hyped and didn't live up to my expectations. \n\nCurry Udon: The broth was like drinking salty curry flavored water.  It was REALLY salty.  I couldn't drink more than 2 spoonfuls of broth, but the udon noodles were perfect.  There is also little to no meat in the broth because they just scoop the premade broth from a large vat. How much meat you get depends on how lucky you are that day. Today, I got 1 very tiny piece of meat...so I was basically eating noodles with salty broth. \n\nSalmon Rice Balls:  Just skip it. It may look like there's a lot of salmon in it, but they only put salmon on the top of the rice ball to make it look like it's filled to the brim. In reality, there is less than half a teaspoon of salmon in there.  The rice ball is also just plain rice with no sauce or flavors added.  It was super bland. \n\nTempura:  At $1.90 a piece, it's super overpriced. For those of you that want an extra kick to your udon, it might be worth it. But you can quickly rack up your bill by adding 3 pieces of tempura. For the price of 3 pieces of tempura, you can basically get another udon. \n\nAll in all, I might come back to try the beef udon. Maybe that'll be less salty.

I would not wait 2 hours for this. \n\nOnce you get inside, you get a tray and choose your udon (flavor). Amy got number 2, regular $8.50 (nikutama udon), serve with sweet flavored beef, soft boiled egg, and kake sauce. I think it's one of their popular items on their menu. I didn't want to get the same thing, so I decided to get their number 3, regular $6.90 (curry udon), served with classic curry soup and beef. We also ordered fish cake tempura, shrimp tempura, and various musubis to try, $1.50 each. Don't forget to swing by to get your toppings like green onions, chilli, cilantro, fried scallions, etc. all FREE!\n\nI got to try Amy's soup, it was tasty but too salty for my liking. My udon on the other hand tasted like paste. The curry was too thick to be soup and beef was too shredded. In my opinion, the curry was too overwhelming. It would have been better over rice. The musubis was a NO,NO, don't get it!  When we cut the musubis in half, it was all rice, barely any meat inside. We used the rice to dip into my curry lol. That was a lot of CARB. We REGRET for getting 4 musubis! The tempura was not bad, but nothing special. \n\nI would say opt the musubis and go for tempura if you want additional food.

The downfall of Stonestown's Macy's store certainly suggests it might be in need of saving.\n\nIts explosion into the Japanese food scene on the edge of San Francisco was curious. How often do you see a place receive over 100 reviews, with no sign bribing for Yelp reviews at the restaurant, within mere weeks of its opening? Marugame is extremely popular in Hawai'i as Marukame, which explains the hype. We arrived at the opening of its dinner hours, and after 45 minutes, finally made it through the doors into warm, soupy heaven.\n\n\"FRESH UDON!\" came the cry, as we pored over the menu. Yes, the open kitchen concept allows patrons to see every aspect of the cooking process, from workers cranking out udon dough disks, blanching the noodles in light broth, frying fresh tempura veggies and seafood, and wrapping the musubis. It goes udon order - tempura - musubi - point of sale - drinks - free toppings.\n\nI stuck to the classic and ordered the kama-age udon, fresh noodles dipped in a savory dashi broth that epitomizes the umami bomb. At the topping bar, I added a sprinkle of green onions that really flavored the original udon broth. Having just recovered from wisdom tooth extraction, this was the perfect re-introduction into the wonderful, wide world of salty food. I couldn't stop dipping. It really helped that it came in a cool bamboo bowl and only cost $4.50 for a regular bowl.\n\nWhen my significant other wasn't looking, I swiped a bit of his curry udon ($6.90), which included gyudon. Although we both expected it to be thinner, a la made-from-Vermont-Curry-package soupy curry, we were amazed at how rich the flavor was. Emily T. opted for the bukkake udon ($4.50), consisting of fresh noodles submerged in a bit of dashi broth. Also a really good option.\n\nThe tempura is really another stand-out feature of Marugame. It's just evil that they put it right next to the udon serving station, where innocent, hungry bystanders who have no self-control like me are lured in by the promise of fresh, crispy sides. Some of the foods on the tempura menu are shrimp, chicken, squid, sweet potato, a vegetable pancake, and an especially-great potato croquette.\n\nOn the flip side, skip the musubis. While it's cool that they hand-make and wrap them (and include an 'eat-by' sticker so you KNOW it's fresh), I found that the sticky rice outweighed the salmon flakes by a ratio of 10:1, so it really felt like I paid for plain ol' rice.\n\nI recommend that the establishment put up larger signs about not saving seats and tray disposal. The directives to go leave your tray with the dishwashers, with no indication of where that is (hidden behind the toppings bar), only appear on one side of the napkin holders.\n\nCan't wait to return and try their full menu!", "author": "Gwen W."}

I like the \"cafeteria-style\" of ordering and you can see the udon being prepared as you move down the line. At the end of the line, there are many different choices of tempura and musubi that you can grab ranging from $1-2. My boyfriend and I both ordered the hot Nikutama udon and grabbed shrimp, chicken, and squid tempura to share. I couldn't resist the musubi so I grabbed a mentai mayo musubi as well. You can see that their items are all fresh because they were constantly putting out more tempura and newly wrapped musubi. My total for 2 people came out to be $29, which isn't bad at all! (My boyfriend got a large sized udon) \n\nThere's a station of complimentary toppings where you can add green onion (my fave!), cilantro, tempura flakes, and seasoning/sauces. Here is also where you get the tempura sauce that's served hot. So hot that it literally melted the plastic container that it was in. They need to do something to fix this because it's definitely not safe for people to still use the tempura sauce in melted plastic. I saw some other people in the same situation. We ended up putting the tempura sauce in a paper cup instead. The tempura was okay, the batter was a little too thick for my liking. \n\nAs for the udon, it was good! It didn't necessarily blow me away, but there was a good amount of sweet beef, and the udon noodles were cooked perfectly and tasted very fresh.

Weekends have been HELLLLLA crazy, but on a weekday, just a few minutes wait will get you to a heaping, delicious & comforting bowl of hot, fresh Udon!\n\nTheir Grand Opening was on Thursday, January 18th, and the expansive eatery offers a slew of udon noodles (prepared by a machine, naturally), via soup or dry, in various sizes and topping formations. Diners then take the bowl, which is prepared to order, as well as fill their plates with various freshly deep-fried tempura. After paying, there's a station to finish off bowls with fried tempura bits, cilantro, or green onions.\n\nPrices are reasonable, starting at just $4.50 for a basic Kama-Age Udon bowl which is served in a wooden bowl with a flat bottom. Curry and spicy chicken udon add a bit more flair while things like the beef, tomato, tonkotsu (fatty broth), and nikutama add even more fun. The nikutama features a sweet beef broth served in a moderate portion and topped with a soft-boiled egg. Tempura pieces might include asparagus, sweet potato, shrimp, chicken, and squid, and they each cost $1.30 to $2.20 per piece, and can be enjoyed on the side or in the udon bowl itself.\n\nSo why is Marugame Udon one of the most authentic Japanese experiences in SF? The self service, the cafeteria-style arrangement, the reasonable prices, and even the dining room, which asks customers to bus their own tables afterwards. All of that is indicative of a traditional fast-casual eating experience one might find in a Japanese city.", "author": "Alvin M."}

Study the menu at a fast pace (unless you already know what you want)\n2) Once the line cooks behind the counter asks, tell them what you want. Once prepared, (relatively fast) they will place it on the counter for you to take. \n3) Moving further down the line, you can pick fried sides, like tempura shrimp, fried chicken, potato croquette, vegetable tempura  and a variety of musubi. \n4) Order drinks & pay at the cashier. \n5) Look for a table\n\nYes, everything is self serve. You're even asked to bus your own table, so I'm not sure why there's an option for tips at the cashier. There are also red chili pepper and fried crispy udon toppings near the drink station. \n\nOriginally, I wanted the spicy chicken. But the picture that hangs above the line shows a plain broth with chili flakes. That turned me off, so I got what my friend got, curry beef. The broth was a tad too salty, the meat was sparse, thinly sliced and had a decent fat ratio (not good). Even worse, my friend's order had only one tiny piece of beef. I'd give this udon a 2/5.\n\nI also got a vegetable tempura because it looked the most interesting, only to find out after one bite that it's an onion blossom with 2 shreds of carrots for color. 2/5. I passed on the musubi because from my experience, when they're shaped like a triangle, the toppings/fillings are little and only on top for show. So in essence, you're buying a rice pyramid for over a buck and a half. \n\nThe friendliness of the staff was present. One guy near the entrance explained about the Grand Opening on 1/18 and offered us coupons, but since I live 400 miles away, I declined. \n\nThe flavor and price point is not as good as Honolulu, the only thing I liked better here is it's a more modern decor, and it's temperature controlled, while Hawaii has open windows and was quite humid. \n\nI tried it. Curiosity filled. Done. Not in a hurry to wait in line for this again. I don't see the hype. Perhaps many people have only heard of the one in Waikiki and were anxious to try it, or want to justify why they waited an hour in line. A generous 2.5 rounded up to 3 because of the nice staff. \n\nNotes:\n* Line is outside, so check the weather and dress appropriately\n* Many menu items are not available until 1/18/18\n* Soft opening in the meantime with limited items\n* If you also think it's ridiculous to wait for average flavored udon, avoid meal times or line up before opening. At least you'll be guaranteed a table.\n* Soft drinks are from fountains, not cans. Some people prefer cans.", "author": "James L."}

My dipping noodles were hot and delicious, a tiny bit too long to dip at once though. The tempura flakes were super fun, and my actual tempura was so-so. Accidentally got overcharged for fish-cake tempura instead of zucchini and the cashier gave me my change back in cash (instead of card). \n\nThe one thing that stood out to me the most was the guy weighing out the regular vs. large size udon up front.

I wait there and this dude behind me is on the phone \"this must just be a hype cause its cheap\". I turned around and gave him a death stare and said nonono, this is the real deal. Now he thinks im crazy but stays in line, he is about to experience greatness thanks to me.\n\nCool thing about waiting in line when you get inside is watching them cook the fresh ass udons. So effing good!!!! \n\nWe waited about 45 mins and decided to order 3 bowls for the two of us so we can try a few flavors. Spicy chicken, beef and curry.

It was about 30 minutes from when I got into line to the end when I paid and was ready to eat. The line moves pretty quickly as they usher each patron through their assembly line style process. One person cooks the udon, the next prepares the broth and toppings, and yet another person accepts payment. They have the whole thing pretty streamlined.\n\nI went with the beef udon ($7.90 for the regular size) with a soft boiled egg and some extra tempura sides and toppings that are self serve. The freshly made udon noodles were nice and chewy, the broth was light and refreshing, and the soft boiled egg was so softly boiled it spilled open with a light poke of the chopsticks. For my tempura sides, I got fish, squid, and fish cake. The fish was overpriced and not worth the $2, but both the squid and fish cake were good sides to eat with the udon. If I had to pick one, it'd be the fish cake as it is more flavorful.\n\nThe restaurant is large with plenty of seating.

I also don't think every location serves this dish so it may be special. \n- Edamame Salsa Udon - this is a cold noodle dish with veggie toppings.

I would highly suggest you skip on these as its 90% rice.\n\nAfter you fill your tray, you go to the toppings station and can load your bowl with tempura flakes, green onion, and cilantro. They also have sauces for your tempura.\n\nUdon is just as good as hawaii. I would definitely be back. Literally the best udon I've had at any establishment.\n\nCan't wait for their full menu offering!", "author": "Lena V."}

It was soft opening so they did not have their full menu out. Usually the line is out the door to Olive Garden, but since it was pouring, the line was relatively short.\n\nTheir set up is similar to a cafeteria. You choose which broth you want, then you can use tongs to pick up your additional items. After you pay, you can add cilanto, green onion, or tempura flakes to your bowl. I ordered a regular hot Bukkake udon ($4.50), which the broth is made with soy sauce. They give you less broth since the flavor is strong. I don't typically eat udon because it can get too chewy but the udon here is by far the best I ever had. The noodles were perfect and extremely fresh. I also got a piece of fried chicken ($1.80) and a salmon flake masubi ($1.60). I thought the chicken wouldn't be crunchy anymore because it is sitting out, but it was still good. Th salmon flake masubi would be better if it had more salmon through out the masubi but for $1.60, can't really complain.\n\nTheir grand opening is on January 18, 2018 so afterwards, I will be back to try the other items on their menu. Stonestown finally put a good establishment that will last in that space.", "author": "Julian Y."}

Hopefully the lines don't get super long, but on a Friday night, my friend and I waited about 20 mins to get to the front of the line. It could've been worse, so I'm not complaining!\n\nWe've both been to Marukame Udon in Hawaii so we knew what to expect. I love the concept of ordering your udon and then going down the tempura/musubi line just picking what you want as you go! We both ordered the beef udon. What's nice about this location is that they have green onions, tempura crunchies, ground sesame, pepper, and sauces at a different station so you can top your udon yourself. I liked the thick sweet tempura sauce and the dashi soy sauce. \n\nThe beef in our udon was a little chewy and pretty fatty.. imo, next time I would just order the plain udon and get extra tempura since the plain udon is only $5! The noodles were perfectly chewy and the broth is just how I remember from Hawaii, however the broth could've been warmer. My fav tempura was definitely the chicken tempura!! Surprisingly, the breast piece was super juicy. Compared to the similarly priced shrimp tempura, the chicken was larger in size and definitely more worth it. \n\nI will definitely be back! I can't wait to try the curry udon once they are officially open. So glad to have some good udon near my house now, and right next to my gym too! :D", "author": "Tara A."}

I would rather just not go than to wait. \nI've known about Marugame Udon for several months, but never had the urge to go simply because of the wait. But today was different. As I wandered around looking for another store, I saw the line wasn't too bad. So I decided to give it a go. \nMy son and I both got the tonkotsu udon. I must say that the udon itself is excellent. It has a soft, silky and chewy texture, and tasted very fresh. The pork broth was really good, not too salty but still a lot of flavor. The two slices of pork was really tender. \n\nThe soft boiled egg was definitely disappointing. This wasn't a soft boiled egg, it was a poached egg. And it basically disenegrated as soon as I put it in my broth. Making soft boiled eggs is definitely an artform, one that this place hasn't perfected yet.  Also because of their assembly line system, the broth was semi-hot but not steaming hot, which would be my preference. \n\nI also tried the shrimp, tamagoyaki, and squid tempura. The batter was light and had a bit of saltiness, a bit if nuttiness to it. It tasted good. But again because of their assembly line food production, the tempura were all basically cold. And I really don't like eating cold tempura. If this could be improved upon, I would rate this place through the roof. \nBecause of the way you get your own tempura and rice balls, you tend to indulge more than usual. Don't forget that each item is priced separately at about $2 a pop, which quickly adds up. So even though the udon is relatively priced, everything adds up to about $15-20 per person. \nOverall though the udon is the star of this show, and I would definitely recommend this place for their udon. I will be back soon, crossing my fingers that the line isn't too long.", "author": "Dom L."}

I wanted to feel nostalgic and decided to wait as well!\n\nI came at around 2pm - 3pm and waited for 45 min. to get in. There are less than 10 different udon dishes on the menu - much less than the choices you can get in Japan. However, they had the essentials. I was disappointed that they didn't have zaru udon. But bukake udon makes up for that. Bukake udon is like zaru udon except the dipping sauce is poured on the noodles. For my visit, I ordered two dishes: bukake udon and mentai kamatama. Both were not disappointing - very similar to the consistency of Marugame Japan.\n\nThe meals here are generally cheap. Everything's less than $10. The only problem's that the store's in Mordor. I live in the south bay so getting here's a long drive. Hopefully in the future they'll open more stores throughout the bay and more around Los Angeles as well!\n\nI'm so happy this store opened.

It's like noodle bowls from an anime show! The only thing I wished this location can change is the level of saltiness of the soup. It was slightly really salty, but at least it has a lot of taste. The udon looks are very long and chewy, just the way an udon should be, slurp-able. The location is open seating, inside or outside. Occasionally there will be lines, but it's worth the wait!

Although this may seem daunting and a waste of time, it was surprisingly worth it for the experience. As long as you have a good group of mates to pass the time, it goes by quick. \n\nThere was a selected few options to choose from on the menu and it wasn't overwhelming at all, so if you're indecisive like me, there's little anxiety when picking the one item for you. You just need to choose between 8 different items and the process is super simple. It's a single line that starts the moment you enter. You start off by telling the great employees what item you want, what size, and whether you want it hot and cold. I chose a regular, hot Nikutama as it was filling and warm enough for the cold weather at the time. I definitely loved the extras you could add on such as grabbing a few tempuras and musubis along the way to the register. My favorite part was the toppings table where I piled on a lot of green onions and cilantro! Definitely would recommend putting a little bit of ginger in there too! \n\nThe Nikutama was a bowl of goodness as it knew how to warm up the soul. The udon noodles were very fresh as you can see the noodles life span from exiting the hot water to your bowl and into your mouth. I was sad that I was lacking a bit of soup compared to my friends other bowls but it was mighty tasty regardless and got me wanting more. The tempura was really good! My favorite out of the bunch was the chicken so definitely grab a couple of those to pair with your bowl. The beef was soft and melted in your mouth but it was a little fatty for my liking. And the musubi was an okay snack as the ratio between salmon and rice was off balance for my preference but I could've been eating them the wrong way so who knows. \n\nOverall, I had a great time at this restaurant and would definitely be coming back to try a little bit of a dish more spicy. Definitely would recommend this to someone who's looking for something with great noodles but would warn them about a long wait. Thank you Marugame Udon for a wonderful time!", "author": "Jomari G."}

They're rolling out the rest of the menu as time passes.\n\nOrdered my (large) beef udon and proceeded eagerly down the line with my tray. This is where i needed to show some self control... but didn't. I wanted every piece of tempura and all the musubis. I piled what i could onto my tray! There's an island of cilantro, chopped green onions, sriracha, and tempura sauce to top your bowl. Watch out for the tempura sauce in what i normally recognize as a tea dispenser. It shot out a lot more forcefully than expected for my tiny dipping container hah!\n\nSeating is difficult. People are far too antsy and save seats before they even get a tray. It doesn't take long to slurp down a bowl of udon. No need to throw your sweaters and bags on a table so far in advance! I'm judging you if you're one of those people ...\n\nUnfortunately the line is long and can move slowly which cooled my soup down significantly. It is delicious though! Their tempura is perfectly cooked too. The squid was tender and surprisingly my favorite. The (boneless) chicken and shrimp were great too.

My older brother ordered the large Curry Udon ($7.90), and I ordered the regular Curry Udon ($6.90). I can't eat foods that are too spicy, so I was very cautious of ordering the Curry Udon, but after asking a customer who sat down eating it, I felt relief. The Curry Udon was delicious! It is very simple though, just curry, udon, and beef. My little brother ordered the large Spicy Chicken Udon ($7.90), and my mom ordered the large Beef Udon ($8.90). I didn't really like how the chicken in the Spicy Chicken Udon was all chopped up, in a mincy texture. The soup base tasted like a sweet and sour soup. I would steer clear of the musubi because it's mainly 99.9% rice and 0.01% seafood. Besides the Vegetable Kakiage tempura, the potato croquette and other tempura choices were mediocre.\n\n-The system of ordering food is in a cafeteria like order. You tell them which size and type of of udon you want, pass by the tempura and musubi options, and pay. They use Square as a POS system, but they don't have Apple Pay as a payment option.\n\n-On the side adjacent to the cashier is a condiments station where there is a variety of vegetable toppings (onions, cilantro) and sauce options. There are also sauce containers and bags incase you have leftovers. \n\nWhen you're at the front of the line, there's a green sticker line on the floor. There's an employee on the side with menus who is in charge of the flow of the line, and who can go order. If there are too many people in udon and musubi station, they make you wait behind the green line, which makes a lot of sense. The Curry Udon and Vegetable Kakiage (mixture of vegetable tempura) were the utmost highlights of my meal. A big mistake customers make is leaving their trash and bowls behind on the table when they're done with their meal. On the napkin dispensers on the table, they have signs that say you have to bring your tray and bowls to the back for the employees to wash them.", "author": "Erica K."}

However I have found myself coming back here again and again, changing  my mind drastically on my feelings for it as the flavors they put together gives my tastebuds yearning for more.\n\nLet me start off by saying the wait here is ridiculously long. The first time I had came, I went during their down time so being able to get food and finding a seat quickly is a rarity. It is made up with the fast pace the restaurant does with the upkeep but do expect to wait on average 15~30 minutes before being able to place an order and sitting down. This place can get as busy as to having two separate lines before going in to actually order and grabbing a seat to eat.\n\nThey have a wide selection of udon ranging from cold to hot and regular to large sizes; prices depending on what udon you get. Typically an udon bowl will range from $8~12 and others with just the sauce and noodles ranges from $4~6. Bowls are customizable for an extra $1~3 per item depending what tempura/onigiri you decide to grab. Do expect that although the bowls are cheap in price, it can run high. I find myself usually spending an average of $15~20 here because they seem to always put new seasonal items they like to try out.\n\nSeating does get hard to find. When it gets busy here both indoor and outdoor seating is packed like sardines in a can. Seats are usually about a foot away from each other so its important to be mindful of space. If you dine here with a friend it is recommended to have either yourself of your friend grab a seat as they can be free one second and gone the next.\n\nIn all the times I have came here, I have only ordered the Nikutama Udon. It is quite a bit of food and the sweet beef is something I could not pass up on eating every time. It pairs well with the sauce they put in the udon and the tempura you decide to grab on the side. Compared to other udon I have tried outside of here, MARUGAME is sweet in flavor. There is a bar filled with sauces, tempura flakes, onion, cilantro toppings and much more. This makes it easy to get exactly what you want and how much you want of it. The only bad thing I can say is the tempura you grab seems to be very oily and at times cold unless pulled right out the fryer. \n\nOverall MARUGAME UDON gets a 4/5 from me. If they are able to improve on their seating arrangements and tempura I definitely see big things for MARUGAME in the future.", "author": "Dalina N."}

However, once you order, it only takes about 5 minutes to sit down with your food and eat!\n\nMy boyfriend and I both got the regular plain Kake udon ($4.50 each) with different types of tempura (~$1.80-$2.20/piece) and he got a musubi ($1.50). Don't let the cheap udon and tempura prices fool you - we ended up spending $24 still! Everything adds up! \n\nThe process is very similar to Marukame Udon in Hawaii if you've ever tried that, although it's a little slower but maybe just because they just opened. Hopefully they'll get the line moving a little faster over time. They have unlimited tempura crunchies and a sauce/toppings bar which is nice. As for the food, the broth tasted a little off to me. Not quite the same as Marukame but still good. Tempura was tempura - nothing too special although I took Tara A's recommendation and tried the chicken tempura - definitely filled me up for about the same price as a shrimp so I'd get that again! \n\nThe place is a decent size, didn't seem like anyone was forced to eat outside on the patio the whole time we were waiting in line or eating so the seating turnaround worked out pretty well. \n\nOverall, the place is good and is worth trying but for me, I wouldn't wait 45 minutes again. I'd probably wait until they get a little faster and if I'm really craving this type of udon.

You'd think there's not much too it because it's pretty simple but there's so much hidden flavors. It was filled with flavor and it kept me full. I never got tired of every bite I took.

Maybe because there's no udon place in sf (that I know of?) but there's nothing too special about this place tbh. \n\nI really like their udon noodles and I think they do a good job on the texture of it. But the broth was okay. I got curry and it was okay. The meat inside the curry was definitely over cooked so it was soggy. Meh. \n\nIt's cool that you can see their assembly line - rolling the noodles, boiling the noodles, portioning the noodles to adding the soup. But not so cool when you see the noodles being served to you touch someone's arm but they still serve it to you...\n\nPretty gross but my friends and I saw a chick make the portions of noodles and she didn't grab them all so one noodle from her hand was long and dangling so it flew a bit where it wrapped around another worker's forearm then she was like :O then unwrapped it but continued to bunch it in serving noodle pile... Pretty unsanitary but didn't want to potentially have my food be messed up somehow. \n\nI also feel bad for my friend's order (large) verses mine(regular). I think he ordered a large but only got 1 portion of noodles instead of 2... and just had more broth to compensate. Not sure if the workers were frazzled but they might have not noticed my friend's order was a Large and not Regular. \n\nI would probably give this place another shot later in the future but I think they have a lot of training to go through with their employees before I return. Also - lined up at 4:30pm and waited in the cold until 6pm... No fun. \n\n\n+1 Star for the price though. Definitely affordable and not robbing me!", "author": "Nicole C."}

It's located outside the entrance to the mall by Olive Garden so you cant miss it. \n\nLet me tell you about the lines, wow... You wait in a line across the way to get into a line that gets you into another line inside where you finally order. It was packed but we were hungry and it was a cold evening and udon was the answer. We waited about 30-35 mins before we were able to order. That wasnt cool but its popular and inexpensive so you just gotta bring your patience.\n\nOnce you get inside, grab a tray. You will need a tray per person with all the additions as you go down the cafeteria style ordering line. You first order the type of udon you want. I went with the #5 like I did in Waikiki. It's the beef udon that has a little bit of sweetness to it. I went with a small bowl ($7.90) because I knew I would go crazy with the tempura options... I added 2 shrimp, one potato, a mixed vegetable tempura and an egg plant. They were all good but the mixed vegetable was a little disappointing as it wasnt like the one in Hawaii. It was more of like a ball of onion rings. Not so much the other stuff. I would probably pass on that next time... The udon itself was just as delicious as I remember. The soup it comes in and the perfect udon noodles topped with the sweet beef was delicious... There is an area for toppings so you can add green onions and tempura shavings. You can also get tempura sauce for dipping and other things.\n\nWas it worth the wait? I guess it was because it hit the spot and was light on the wallet. Was it as good as the one in Honolulu?

Unfortunately, nothing I have had around here has been comparable. I had high hopes for Marugame Udon (basically Marukame with a \"g\"?? Confusing). Anyways, I came during their soft opening on a Sunday morning 30 minutes before they opened with the intent of being the first wave for lunch. EXTREMELY happy we came at 10:30 am instead of 10:45 am, because those who came at 10:45 am probably were at the start of the second wave of patrons. So sad, especially because it was so cold outside. :(\n\nBoyfriend & I decided to we were unlikely to come back & bare the line or cold again so we got the following (don't judge us please): \n\n- Spicy Chicken Udon -- threw me off a bit because it felt more like a tom yum broth or something--decently flavored & had a nice kick.\n- Curry Udon -- not a huge fan of curry udon because it's a little heavy for my taste, but the bf liked this, although he def compared it to Muracci's.\n- Beef Udon -- probably our favorite of the 3 udons, wish they offered the egg during soft opening :(.\n- Chicken Tempura -- best tempura!!\n- Shrimp Tempura -- second best tempura!\n- Sweet Potato Tempura -- meh.\n- Potato Croquette -- meh.\n- Salmon Flake Musubi -- meh.\n\nMy biggest gripe with our meal(s) was the lukewarm temperature of the broth & tempura. I'm not sure what went wrong, maybe it was because we were part of the first wave, but then that's kind of weird, too. Honestly, if the bowl was piping hot, & the tempura were at least warm, I think Marugame would have received 5 stars from me. I hope they work out the kinks for their grand opening this past January 12th. HOT BROTH & TEMPURA GUYS, it's important!\n\nOther than that, I would recommend Marugame Udon as a great place for udon noodle soup in the Bay Area. It seriously is INCREDIBLY well-priced. If the line doesn't keep me away, I'll definitely be going for the Kake or Beef Udon with a soft-boiled egg, along with the chicken & shrimp tempura.", "author": "Carol N."}

If you can't find a spot in the outdoor parking areas, there is always the underground parking garage.  We finally tried this place out on a Wednesday afternoon around 2ish.  There was no line at all!  We were so happy that we walked right in and stood in line (inside) passing the counter where noodles were made.  It was a sight to see on how the noodles were properly cooked and prepared.  \nI chose the beef udon and got a couple of the tuna onigiri.  We were quite upset and annoyed that they didn't have the tempura station up and running.  We were told that they've always had issues with their fryers and today was just the wrong day to try this place out but we continued to just try to enjoy the food they had.  The beef udon was delicious; broth was flavorful, meat was tender, and the noodles were good.  The noodles are thick and not particularly not my favorite.  The tuna onigiri was okay... it lacked the ratio of tuna and rice.  Literally... there was more rice than tuna and it was not a pleasant piece of snack.  \nThe restaurant was decorated in Japanese influenced pieces; good amount of tables and chairs but is a first-come first-served.  The process:  you stand in line (cafeteria-style), you pay, and you go find a seat to sit.  After eating, you bring your tray with the bowls, etc. to the drop-off station.  Great and economical concept.\nOverall, I had to give this place three stars.  This place did not live up to the hype!  Maybe if there was the tempura station which would have provided more food choices, I think it may have made a difference.  Will we come here again?  Maybe if we know that their fryers are working and we get lucky again with no lines... we'll give this place another chance.", "author": "Erna M."}

But the worst thing was when I was biting into the musubi half way I feel a loud crunch in my mouth that resembled a small black grey rock like.

They have a small menu for you to pick from and there are some items with hot and cold dishes and  you can pick the size you want, either regular or large.  When you get inside, you tell the person the number and the size of your order.  You'll need t grab a tray for the udon and one for tempura if you plan on getting it that is.  You'll go to the next section, where they'll place it on the tray and you can ask them to add an egg or two if you want.  It is 1.00 for an additional egg.  Continue down the line and you can pick our tempura.  There's veggie options, like sweet potato, shrimp, zucchini, tamago, and other tempura options.  If you don't want tempura, you can pick the onigri options in the end.

While the line was easily an hour outside, there was plenty of seating.\n\nIf I got only udon, I think the large would be perfect...but next time I return, I will get a regular size so I can stack up more on tempura. The self-serve toppings is great so you can shamelessly pour tempura flakes and green onion. \n\nOnce done feasting, you bus your own trays/dishes to the kitchen.\n\nThe noodles were the highlight with the chewy freshness. You can see the udon being shaped, cut into strips, boiled, cooled, and placed in each bowl. The curry was really savory, but I don't think I would ever drink it. I loved the kakiage. The shrimp tempura was very good, too, but it was not as crispy as I would have liked it.\n\nI joined the line 20 min before opening, and I highly recommend doing so to be the first batch of customers and not wait for seats to empty out.

Pay and from there, there is a topping bars filled with delicious tempura flakes, cilantro, green onions, etc.\n\nbeef udon + soft boiled egg: reminds me exactly of the udon I had in Japan! The soft texture of the udon mixed with the sweet taste of beef was amazing. The soup wasn't bad; although I didn't drink much of it. Wished the portions of beef was bigger but the overall experience was worth it! \n\nshrimp + fishcake tempura: can't go wrong with either of these! both were so light and crispy. At the toppings bar, make sure to grab a little dish of tempura sauce to compliment your delicious deep fried goodness! my favorite was definitely the fishcake but my boyfriend loved the squid + fishcake one\n\nWhile this location was good, I still preferred the LA one - tasted more authentic and lesser wait time. The LA one also had more options because I got the Tonkotsu udon last time but didn't see it on the menu here.", "author": "Vinni C."}

If there are this much people who are willing to wait in line, it must be good! \n\nCame on Tuesday at 2pm. The line wasn't bad at all, about 5-8 people out the door. \nI love how this is a quick service establishment. First, you order your udon, which is made in front of you. Then you can pick what kind tempura and musubi you'd like, and then you pay. There is also a complimentary toppings bar right pass the register. \n\n#5 beef udon \nMy boyfriend got this one and to me, it was the tastiest amongst both udons we tried that day. The beef is thinly sliced. Think of beef brisket when you go to a hot pot place. The broth was flavorful and complimented the beef well. 10/10 would recommend.\n\n#6 spicy chicken udon \nThe only reason why I got this was bc I wanted something spicy. To me, it wasn't spicy at all. The chicken was moist, cut into small bits. Freshly cooked udon had a nice bite to it. \n\nShrimp tempura \nTasted cold but was still good.\n\nSquid tempura \nThe squid tempura tasted like it's been sitting there for a good amount of time. Not appealing. Old and rubbery. The tempura batter had left oil residue on my fingers. \n\nPotato croquette \nYum! My fave out of all fried foods. Basically a mashed potato ball breaded and deep fried. Slightly sweet. Very good. Reminds me of an Asian version of a Portos potato ball.\n\nChicken tempura \nI was not amazed by this. Many people have said great things but I was not impressed. Although the chicken was moist and the exterior was crunchy, I felt it was lacking flavors. I tried to sprinkle on some seasoning on it but still wasn't tasty. \n\nVegetable kakiage\nThis definitely has been sitting there. Oily and cold. Tasted heavy of onion and nothing else. \n\n\nThis place is affordable. I love the fresh topping bar where you can customize your soup to your liking. I recommend coming during lunch hours bc the line is significantly shorter. Definitely try the delicious beef udon & potato croquette.", "author": "AJ C."}

We were on of the last group for the first set of the line. They have a second set of line in the back by olive garden so that it doesn't block the crosswalk. After it opened, we had to wait another 25 min to order. \n\nThe set up is cafeteria style. You get a tray, order your udon, choose the udon or musubi you want, pay, go to the toppings bar to add to your udon and find an open table to eat. I think  the process is pretty organized and efficient. When you're done eating, you bring your trays back yourself. \n\nWe ordered the beef udon, nikutama udon, shrimp, zucchini and asparagus tempura and a musubi. The nikutama udon is a sauce based noodle and you can choose whether to get it hot or cold. I thought the udon in Hawaii tasted better but food was still good!! Udon noodles was super fresh since they make it there and you can watch the process as you're in line. Musubi was good too, the rice was super fresh.

We waited for about an hour. I was wondering why there would be periods where the line kept moving gradually, while sometimes we'd just be standing there. It turns out that they kept running out of some of the broths and it was a 15 min wait for those options. I think they will be working on the timing and efficiency during their soft opening, so hopefully the wait won't be too bad in the future (fingers crossed). Staff was polite and friendly. \n\nNone of their udons with egg were available during the soft opening, so I got a large beef udon with squid and chicken tempura on the side. Highly recommend the beef udon, though I'd get a regular next time haha (I was so hungry after running the Hot Chocolate 15k in SF that I was a bit ambitious xD). My husband preferred his bukkake udon, but both were delicious! The noodles were cooked perfectly with the right texture and consistency.\n\nAs for the tempura, I'd recommend the squid tempura and the potato croquette- so tasty and perfectly fried! After you pay, you can get free green onions, tempura flakes, ginger, parsley, and pepper at the toppings bar and seat yourself at an open table. Afterwards, you bus your own tray to the tray return area. \n\nPrices are really reasonable, averaging $5-8 for a bowl of udon including tax and less than $2.5 per piece of tempura or onigiri. \n\nI want the Nikutama udon (contains beef and egg) when they have their grand opening on January 18th, 2018! \n\nArguably the best udon place in the Bay Area even though it is a chain-\ndefinitely come check it out!", "author": "Jessica Y."}

There was a guy walking around handing out menus, which also had some coupons printed on them to use once the grand opening happened. There was also a really long line, so it took us about 20-30 minutes to finally order. It gave us enough time to go over the menu to choose what to eat. I decided on the large beef udon, especially since I was hungry. \n\nYou get a tray and then wait to tell the person your order. They will hand you the bowl with the noodles and broth, then you are sent on your way to the topping bar. They have many different types of tempura. The shrimp tempura, zucchini tempura, and potato croquette were calling to me. You then also pass by some masubis, but I wasn't hungry enough to also eat one of those, so I passed on it. I might come back and try one of the crab meat masubis. After the masubis is the cashier where they ring you up for everything you order. Each piece of the tempuras costs money, so choose wisely. Everything I ordered was under $15, so it wasn't too bad. \n\nThe beef was kind of a small portion, but I actually enjoyed the beef. The tempura was really good. I think people don't really choose the vegetable tempuras much because my zucchini tempura was pretty cold. It probably sat there for a while and cooled down since it was in the fryer. The shrimp one had just come from the fryer, so it was nice and hot. The potato croquette was a lil cold, but still tasted good. If you see something come straight from the fryer, i would recommend getting one of those items. \n\nHaving only one cashier does slow down the line a lot, but that might be a good thing since it's getting cold now and no one wants to sit outside. By slowing it down, people are allowed to sit and eat and then empty seats will eventually open up for everyone. Maybe it was meant for the seating arrangement to work out. Who knows. \n\nAnyways, I really enjoyed the udon and it was nice to eat on a pretty cold day. I can't wait to come back and try some of the other dishes that become available soon.", "author": "Allyson L."}

Be sure to come that day because they will be having a special promotion for their first 100 customers.\n\nWe waited about 50 minutes in line, but the wait was worth it. Marugame serves freshly made handcrafted noodles that will blow you away. We ordered the Curry udon as well as the beef udon which were both very flavorful. The curry udon wasn't too heavy and had just the right amount of saltiness. The beef broth was very satisfying. The texture of their noodles was perfect as they were perfectly cooked. The beef was sweet and thinly sliced which was nice because it was easy to eat. The tempura was fried perfectly and wasn't too overcooked.\n\nI thought their ordering system was wise because it allowed quick service and had the long line moving smoothly. The condiments bar which had a variety of different garnishes was a nice touch as it allowed people to customize their udon just the way they liked it.\n\nOverall, the food was great, quality of the food went beyond my expectations and everyone in my group enjoyed their food.

Decent soup base. Good execution for the veggie tempuras.

I came at around 3:30, and was sad to see the lime was already out the door, waited about 30 minutes from outdoor line until ordering. However, I was not let down, the taste is very similar to the Hawaii marukame, but I feel that the quality is a tiny bit lower, and as of now the line definitely moves slower. I felt that the texture of the udon noodles are a little less chewy, and a bit more on the soft side. They also do not give much broth for the #2 nikutama udon that my boyfriend ordered, while my #5 niku udon has plenty of broth. The broth was still tasty with a perfect sweet and savory combo. The tempura options are also a bit smaller than the Hawaii marukame, I wish they had kabocha (pumpkin) tempura, that's my favorite. \n\nEnvironment wise, seating was no issue when we came. Although the line was quite long, people were constantly leaving, so there were many seats throughout our meal. In addition, the little bar of green onion, sauce, ginger, and tempura flakes was very clean and a nice addition. It was great to be able to add as much topping as you like! I will definitely be returning! Although the price is a bit higher than Hawaii's marukame, it is still a good deal for sf pricing and definitely cheaper than other udon spots in the area.

The udons are made fresh at the spot, which was amazing. That alone was worth the wait, however it is cafeteria style and the tempura is made ahead of time, so that's why it's only receiving 4 stars. \n\nRegardless, I went very plane Jane- only because I really wanted to taste the noodle and not everything else on top of it. I ordered hot bukkake udon (and yes, I did add cilantro, tempura bits and green onions to it) plus asparagus, zucchini and shrimp tempura. I will say that the tempura should be warmer than the room temperature it was when I went in, but other than that for the price it was more than okay. \n\nNow, would I wait over an hour just for a bowl of udons at a mall? No. Look, the place looks very authentic, the prices are incredibly affordable especially for San Francisco, but no it's not worth an hour outside either in fog or sun.

Udon was overcooked and lacked the chewy and bouncy texture that I love about freshly made udon (maybe I've been spoiled by Japan). Other restaurants in the Bay offer better udon. As other reviewers mentioned, the tempura is not hot and fresh because they sit on plates for customers to choose from, buffet-style.  However, an employee frying tempura was kind to give me a fresh squid tempura that he just finished frying though (I think the key is to linger and stare.) I also had a sweet potato tempura and a croquette - even though they've been sitting out for a bit, I was happy there was still a yummy crunch. Onigiri had expected filling and rice portions - onigiri is meant to have more rice anyway. \n \nThe lines here are long, and the cafeteria-style service and new employees are inefficient in dealing with the huge influx of customers. Likely explains why my udon was overcooked. I would come here again later, when Marugame has more of a handle of everything.", "author": "Christine L."}

Additionally, they have a sauce bar for you to get sauce for the tempura and you can add chili to your udon if you would like.

We noticed the long lines during the soft opening and decided to come here after work on a Friday.  We arrived about 5.15 and already there was a line.  We waited 45 mins before we got inside.  Please note that this review is on the soft opening and there were only 5 udon bowls to choose from.  However, the grand opening will be on Jan 18th where more udon bowls will debut.\n\nFirst you line up with a tray and dish and decide on the Udon.  After a few minutes waiting for your udon to cook in front of you, you place the bowl of udon on your tray and continue along the line.  You then pick up your favorite tempura sides, which ranges from vegetables to chicken which you place on your dish. I was worried there would be no seats but fortunately the turnover is quick and people leave as soon as they're done.  The udon was good and together with the sides provided a really satisfying meal. \n\nOverall, the variety of tempura is good and reasonably priced, starting from around $1.  There is also a bar, where you can help yourself to spring onions, cilantro, ginger and tempura sauce to compliment your udon. Would be back after the grand opening to check out the other udon bowls.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

I always look forward to reading her reviews on new spots in the SF/Peninsula area and I'm shocked I actually got to a soft opening before her lol. She's always super on top of it!\n\nWhen I saw the coming soon signs for Marugame I freaked out. I remember trying them in Hawaii for the first time and it was honestly the highlight of my trip. I had never tried udon before that and I fell in love. Ever since then I had hoped for an udon only restaurant like that here at home..\n\nFast forward to a few years later and here it is! I only knew it was open because I was actually looking for ramen for my sick self around Daly City when Marugame popped up. I literally dropped what I was doing (which was really just throwing the blanket off me since I was laying down lol) and said let's go! I was afraid that they might be sold out of things since it was already 8:15 when we left and I was also scared they would cut off the line at 8:30 to make way to close at 9. Neither of those things happened so yay!\n\nIt ended up being a 15-20 min wait which wasn't that bad for a soft opening since I remember waiting about that long for udon in Hawaii too. The staff was friendly even though it was the end of the night and I loved watching them freshly make the udon! \n\nThey have the same fixings as they do in all Marugame chains, the tempura crumbs (omg yum!!) And the huge bowl of green onions. I docked a star only because I felt like the udon was a teeny bit over cooked and the furikake and egg rice ball had a weird after taste..\n\nYou also have to be careful adding too much tempura because the seemingly cheap $4-8 udon really adds up when u start adding tempura pieces. With 3 pieces, my udon jumped up to $14 which is still not bad but no longer cheap as I was excited for hehe.\n\nSince they are still in soft opening mode, they have a limited menu with 5-6 types of udon I believe then adding a new one each week on Wed, until opening day.\n\nAll in all I can't wait to come back and try their Egg drop udon when they have their actual grand opening!", "author": "Jayne S."}

It's marinated beef, the texture and flavor comparable to sukiyaki beef (sweet soy sauce marinade), with just a bit of broth to cover some but not all of the noodles. The broth is meant for dipping rather than sipping. The egg was cool (temp wise) and the yolk runny.\n\nAfter you grab the entree you can select tempura of your choice. You pay for what you choose.

I've come here multiple times, and each time, it's been different. As for the noodles of this place, it's consistent with texture, but how you get them is another story. Often, I noticed that they try to give it flavor by making it overtly salty. The fry bar is great, but again with the consistency. \n\nI've gotten the curry udon, the nikutama udon, the beef udon, bukkake udon, and the mentai kamatama udon. \n\nCurry Udon: I'm usually a fan of curry flavored things, but the curry here was just awful to me. I did not like it whatsoever. There was something distinct that I did not like about it, that I could not even finish it. It was watery, and it felt like they were using pepper to mask it. \n\nNikutama Udon: I liked this one a lot. The broth was very hearty, and flavorful. There were many pieces of meat in there, but they're not so meaty, and have a higher fat content. \n\nBeef Udon: This is a good safe choice. You can't really go wrong with this, but I like to be a bit more adventurous, so I don't really get this one. There's plenty of beef here too, but again, the fat content is more than the meat. \n\nBukkake Udon: LOL. Had to get that out there, but yeah, this one, I thought it would be a simple dish, just sauce and noodles. Thought the sauce would compliment the noodles well, but it just made it extremely salty with not much actual flavor to it. \n\nMentai Kamatama Udon: Love this one! My favorite one, but there's not a lot sauce or soup. It's basically a little bit of sauce with cod roe. It's really good since it's flavorful, and not salty.\n\nPricing for these dishes are quite affordable so I guess I can't really complain. They range from $4.50-$9.90 depending on which dish and size you get. A regular is pretty filling especially if you are planning to get some onigiris or tempura.\n\nThe fry bar is fun though! It's basically tempura fried things, and there's a huge variety. Again it's inconsistent. Favorite items of mine are the fishcake stick and the potato croquette. I once had the best potato croquette here. It was fresh, crispy on the outside, warm on the inside, and there was nice peppery taste to it.

At the last station, you pay and proceed to sit down anywhere where there's a open seat and table. I tried almost every item on their menu at this pint. My favorite was the Tonkatsu Udon which had a flavorful broth, pork and a raw egg. My least favorite was the Kama Age Udon, which was also the cheapest option on the menu and the most plain. Lets just say it wasn't the most appetizing, since they scooped it directly from the water they used to boil the udon noodles without rinsing it.

Came here with an open mind twice and I was disappointed...both times. \n\n1st time: came around 5pm on a Wednesday and the wait in line was about 10mins. I ordered the Nikutama and the ratio of broth to noodle is little to none. By the time I reached a table to sit down to enjoy this, it was lukewarm. Meh..the tempura was cold and oily. Nothing special. \n\n2nd time: Monday, lunch time and wait was SO long. Waited almost an hour in line. Decided to give something else a try so I ordered the egg drop chicken one. OMG...the chicken tasted like it's been sunbathed and soaked in a saltwater bath for 20yrs. It was inedible. \n\nI don't think I'm going to go for a 3rd visit. Simply not worth it wait nor money.

But nooooo....... the line is still there! Maybe because of the students from sfsu? \n\nI was lucky a few times when I was able to go here without waiting in a long line. As I enter the place, you are greeted by the staff and immediately see an employee pulling the udon noodles out of the water and twirling it around his fist before putting it into a a small bowl. \nThis place is set up like an assembly line.  Basically you pick an item (udon dish) from the menu and move down to the next employee for the broth to be added into your bowl of udon. The good part about this is that before you get to the cashier, you can select many of the tempura they have laid out for you to pick and place on your tray. Usually cost $1.50 and up for each tempura. \n\nI had the Nikutama beef udon. This is a very flavorful bowl of udon that's very filling and sometimes maybe a little salty. The shrimp tempura are delicious especially with the ponzu sauce. \n\nWould I come back to this place you ask....?

(dao hsiao mien) I haven't been the one in Waikiki to compare, surprisingly. I guess every time I've been there (twice) we've had too many other food options to try too! Hubby decided to take me today for lunch since we had already planned to head to the city for a different reason. We got there around noon on a Wednesday and I saw a line outside and my heart sunk a little. \"That doesn't look that bad,\" my husband said.\n\nSo I hopped out to wait in line while he parked..it's in a mall-like plaza and you can't miss it next to Blaze pizza which was also packed today (pi day) for $3.14 pizza. The line did move surprisingly fast and they had menus outside for you to peruse and decide while you waited. It's cafeteria style, so you go in, pick your udon bowl, pick the size, add on tempura, see if you musubis, and then pay before heading over to the condiments bar (green onions, cilantro, crunchy tempura flakes). You can even watch them make the fresh udon while you wait (once the line moves you inside) and it's pretty cool!! \n\nThere's someone outside regulating the line too so the whole process is pretty efficient and painless and you pick a seat after you get your food. I have to say one of the guys adding meat and sauce to the udon seems a little slow and sloppy today but I think maybe he was just new. Our food was prepared well though, but the guy in front of us had some messy to go curry bins.\n\nI ordered the beef udon ($7.90 regular) because I wanted more broth in mine and I read some of the other broths were too little. I considered the curry udon but didn't want something so thick today. In retrospect, I think I should have just gotten the noodles and broth ($4.50 regular) and then added on tempura because I was STUFFED. My husband got the spicy chicken ($6.90 regular) which he didn't like the broth as much. I have to agree it was a little too sour for my taste, plus the cilantro in it which I hate but I'm sure you could ask them to remove it. The large bowls also looked like huge portions for another dollar more but I think the regular was already a lot. \n\nThe noodles were super Q and fresh and chewy! I read some reviews that the broth was too salty but I didn't think so for mine haha..i topped it all off with extra crunchy tempura flakes and green onions. On top of that, I got a shrimp tempura ($1.90), zucchini tempura ($1.30) and a chicken tempura (forgot the price). Shrimp was standard, the chicken was delicious--like chicken karage almost with less thick breeding, and the zucchini was a generous slice that I took home and toasted later on for a snacK because I couldn't finish! The chicken re-heated well too. My husband also got a shrimp and fish cake which was pretty good, actually! I would try the vegetable one next time. It looks like a bundle of fried onions (almost like a blooming onion) but it just looked slightly too oily for my palate on top of the shrimp and chicken that I wanted, so I opted for zucchini. The onion ball smelled heavenly though! \n\nAll in all, I would totally come back. Prices are super reasonable and the food was delicious and fresh! I would try the potato croquette next time too!", "author": "Jasmine C."}

It's the place I recommended to my brother, when he mentioned how expensive he was finding Hawaii and it's the place I return to at least twice on each visit.  \n\nMarugame Udon (same owners, slight difference in name) is a similarly satisfying experience even if the menu has been tweaked; new menu items seem more fusion-y than the originals, which I prefer.\n\nThe experience at the SF outpost stands on its own but I can't help but compare it to the Hawaii experience and somehow, it comes up a bit short (I consistently award Marukame Udon 5 stars).  A line snakes out the door (but moves along at a good clip, I waited about 20 minutes), the condiment adding area was messy and missing some vital containers, and squeezing into some of the seats is impossible to execute with elegance.  The place feels much closer to fast food than its Hawaiian counterpart.  \n\nStill, I have no complaints for a place like this, where there's free parking, service until 10 p.m., and you can get an excellent and satisfying bowl of perfectly prepared, fresh noodles for well under $10.  I prefer their Hawaii outpost but that's not saying I don't like this one.  I do.  \n\nWelcome to San Francisco, Marugame Udon.  I predict a glowing future.", "author": "Tracey A."}

It was neither great or horrible, just in between. \n\nChicken Karaage 3/5 - It was good, but nothing like Hawaii. Honestly, I was really looking forward to this.

For first-timers, I'd probably recommend one of the more ordinary udons like the Kake udon or the bukkake udon (haha, get it out of your system).  Or one of the udons with a topping you'd enjoy.  Be sure to pick up some tempura or onigiris too.  They're also very reasonably priced and very tasty.  \n\nYou won't have to worry too much about getting a table.  This place has that down to a science or something.  Since the line only moves so quick, seats seem to free up faster than people are coming in so it really works out well in that sense.  I came in with a party of 9 during peak hours and we were able to snag a table fairly easily.  \n\nOverall, this place is a great chain that I'm happy has made its way to SF.

My boyfriend and I came during soft opening, and the line was super long. We probably waited 45 mins to an hour. Not too bad. The way it works is you grab a tray, order your udon and actually wait till you get it. Then you can choose from a selection of tempura and musubi but it's extra cost. You might as well go all out though. And then when you reach the end, you pay. After that you can go to the station that has complimentary toppings to spice up your udon. I ordered the spicy chicken udon and it was so delicious and flavorful. I also got mentai mayo musubi and zucchini tempura. I loved every single bite of it. I definitely will be back to try more flavors! :)", "author": "Tiffany T."}

The line looked long but it moved pretty quickly - we waited about 45 min in line. I decided to try the Nikutama Udon, which is basically the Beef Udon + a pouched egg. I also got a shrimp tempura, chicken tempura, and sweet potato tempura. First off, the shrimp and chicken tempura were definitely worth trying and I understand why it's rated as #1 and #2 tempuras in the restaurant. The sweet potato tempura wasn't that great for me. Now for the udon, the beef was flavored really well, and the udon noodles were cooked perfectly and tasted really fresh. I didn't care too much for the poached egg since they are pre-cooked so it was cold. The udon broth was really good, but sadly my soup was not hot at all. If anything it was only room temperature, and I was expecting a nice steaming bowl of udon. I'm not sure if it's because all the ingredients were cold to begin with, and mixed in with the hot soup cooled the soup down, or if the soup just wasn't that hot to begin with. Regardless, the temperature of the soup was really disappointing for me. That's pretty much the only complaint I had here, but everything else was amazing and I would definitely come back here again! \n\nAlso, there's a station after you get your food where you can add as much green onions, ginger, and tempura flakes to your udon as you want!", "author": "Shannon H."}

I've tried the beef udon, curry udon, egg drop udon, and the mentai udon. All of which were all pretty good, but sometimes the beef can be a little fatty. My favorite is the curry udon and mentai udon with the cod roe. Curry udon can be a little salty at times,  which can be fixed if you eat it with the side tempura. The squid tempura and the shrimp tempura are my favorites to get with the udon. \n\nOnly reason for the 3 stars is because the place isn't really ADA accessible. Brought my brother here who was recovering from Knee surgery and had a difficult time of waiting in line and getting to a table.

I know what I like, and I definitely can tell you that I enjoy Marugame Udon.\n\nIt was awesome to see a new restaurant at Stonestown since I usually do not stop by the mall often to eat in San Francisco. Decided to wait in a decently long line (30 minutes) for my very first time eating at Marugame. Eventually we get to the front and I see the choices on the menu. I decided to go with the Nikutama Udon (cold) since I particularly like my udon to be refreshing, and boy was it refreshing! The soft boiled egg and beef look so delicious the moment they graced the bowl. Garnished with cilantro, green onions, ginger, and tempura bits, it was beautiful.\n\nSomething clicked in my brain and I was off to the races. I was on a mission to try every single menu item, tempura, onigiri, etc. Within the first 7 days of visiting the restaurant, I had already eaten there 11 times and consumed the entire menu at least once. Last week I went a full 7 of 7 days eating lunch at Marugame. That week I locked on my usual order, Bukkake Udon (cold), which I ate every single day. I could not get sick of the refreshing feeling eating this dish, and the price was very affordable.\n\nIn a way I felt like I started working for Marugame since my days were spent answer questions about menu items to patrons either waiting in line, or on my Instagram when I still posted a lot about it. I enjoy this place so much I am guilty of eating there twice in one day, multiple times. As of currently I have chosen to dine at Marugame 23 times and I plan to still keep bringing my business there!\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nNikutama Udon (cold)\nBukkake Udon (cold)\nCurry Udon with soft boiled egg\n\nPotato Croquette\nChicken Tempura (when it comes out fresh it is so amazing)\nInari\nKombu (kelp) Onigiri\nMentai (cod roe) Mayo Onigiri\nUme (salted plum) Onigiri", "author": "Josh M."}

The service inside is super fast, and the tempura is self-serve.....so they clearly just need to come up with a better ordering system.  One idea to improve efficiency would be to have people order on iPads and then pick up by number when their order is ready.  They should also have an option to order ahead online and pick up to go (they are on Postmates for delivery), rather than having to STILL wait in the long line just to turn around and walk back out.  I just think something has to give...\n\nThe food is really good though.  Not exactly light or healthy, but a good treat now and then.\n\nThe tempura is all perfectly fried and never seems to have been sitting out too long.  I also like the not-sweet dipping sauce that they offer.  \n\nMost of the udons that I've tried are also really delicious.

I read reviews about the wait and that coming after 8PM would be a 20-30 minute wait. Well my boyfriend was hungry and couldn't wait so we got there at 7:30PM and it was pretty chilly weekend so we thought no one would be waiting. We were at the end of the first line and we had to move from the first line to the second line out in the middle of the courtyard area. I think we waited 40 minutes which is lots better than an 1+ hours. \n\nThere's 8 different menu items but 3 of them were the base of the other 6. We ordered the Nikutama udon (regular), beef udon (large), and kake udon (regular). The lady preparing the noodles could not remember people's orders and would have to ask the customers 1-3 times in order to repeat the order to next guy doing the broth and toppings. Seemed kinda inefficient. The guy doing the broth and toppings kinda made a mess spilling broth and meat out. Also when he cracked the egg he also cracked the yolk which peeved the lady in front of me probably for picture reasons. The atmosphere also kinda reminded me of the early days of 85 degree bakery when they shouted \"FRESH BREAD!\" Here they something about fresh tempura and noodles.\n\nThe udon was very good and you can definitely tell the difference between fresh noodles and other places. The stewed beef is sweet and the broth was very flavorful. We got some fried goodies after such as croquette (which was plain potato not curry), fish stick, and squid.

Having eaten at the Marukame Udon (I'm pretty sure they are related) in Honolulu, I was happy to find the same familiar items available.

The cafeteria-style layout, varied selections of toppings (note: lots of fried items), and even side items like onigiri were also available.

The restaurant is clean, somewhat efficient, and the food is tasty.  I like the toppings bar where we can add our own green onion and tempura flakes.  Crowd control was a bit disorganized but is better as the initial hype has died down.  Hopefully, this will spark an udon craze around here to compare with the recent popularity of ramen and poke.\n\nComparing this place to udon restaurants in Southern California, Hawaii,  and Marukame in Waikiki is where Marugame falls short.  The lines tend to move twice as fast at the Waikiki location than at Stonestown.  \n\nWhat is a continual irritant is that employees at Stonestown tend to yell a few words in Japanese (oishi) every now and then in an attempt to make things feel authentic but it looks and sounds really forced and contrived, as if they were instructed to do yell in Japanese by their management.   There is one particular employee who takes the yelling to a ridiculous extreme and he seems to be more focused on yelling more than at making udon. \n\nIn contrast, the employees at Waikiki are just busy moving and working and processing things along twice as fast as Stonestown without the obligatory shouting in Japanese.  Also, while the broth in Stonestown in good, the broth in Waikiki is magical and more flavorful.  Everyone I've talked with who has been to both Waikiki and Stonestown locations has said the same thing.  Also, most udon establishments offer a greater variety of soups and toppings (sliced braised tofu, for example) so this is another area where Marugame falls short.  I would be much happier with this place if they cut out the yelling in Japanese and focus more on moving the lines.  \n\nI'm not sure if the managers of Stonestown have ever been to Waikiki but I think it would be an eye-opener for them to see how much faster, more efficient, and tastier it can be.  The Waikiki store is like a well oiled machine and I estimate that the line moves about 20% faster than at Stonestown.  If it were like Waikiki, I would go to Stonestown several times a week but I've only been to Stonestown's a couple of times since soft opening.  If I had to grade Marugame based on the high level of the Waikiki store, this is 3 stars.  On its own, its 4 stars. \n\nMarukame in Waikiki shows up regularly in Top 100 lists.  This one has the potential to do so if they focus less on their yelling semi-random words in Japanese and more on their udon.  The staff should not be the ones yelling \"oishi!\".

I got the spicy chicken udon which comes with udon, shredded chicken breast and some chili flakes. They have a huge topping bar which comes with stuff like ginger puree, shoyu, tempure sause, cilantro, green onion, chili powder, etc. You can really make your broth into so many things depending on your taste, and it's what I really like about this place. \n\nThey also have plenty of types of tempura you can get, along with some musubis. I would say on average a piece of tempura is like $1.75, depending on the type you get. I would also say that on average you don't need the extras in your life. I, like a fool, got spicy chicken udon (large) and two pieces of tempura and I was wayyyy too full. The udon will be enough to satisfy you tbh. If you're really craving tempura though then I'd recommend to perhaps get one of the cheaper bowls of udon, and small.\n\nI really don't think the wait is worth it, though. You have to *stand in line* for 40-45 minutes to order your food in a line, sort of like Chipotle style. They have no option to order ahead or online. It's just like not very convenient, and while I enjoyed the udon, I don't think I'd come here and wait again for it unless it was a special occasion. It's a little bit extra to do so and also a little bit ridiculous tbh.", "author": "Brian W."}

A lot of their soups do incorporate kake bases and they'll add in lemon juice, and other ingredients, so similar taste across the board. The curry and spicy udon though are different bases, so if you want something different go for those ones. \n\nThe beef make the udon come together, and it's the Japanese sweet beef. I love it so much I could eat it all day. \n\nThe udon noodles are made in house and freshly made, which I think is enough to try it out once. For the price you're paying I think it's more than worth it. Honestly I feel like they might even be losing some money selling their udon for so cheap! \n\nAnother cool thing about this place are the side dishes. You have a variety of tempura (fish cake, shrimp, chicken, mushroom, spam muisibi, salmon muisibi). They're about $1.50-$3.00 a piece. Those aren't made as fresh as they sit under a heat lamp, but I think the shrimp tempura pairs greatly with their nikutama udon. \n\nTL;DR a bit overhyped but well worth trying! I don't think you'll be disappointed if you don't expect too much out of it. Overall great experience and fairly quick service.

There was a zig zag line of three rows outside. There was an employee outside handing out mini menus to everyone in line, but since I was eating by myself, I guess I blended in with the other groups that I didn't receive a menu. A lady behind me in line kindly gave me her menu though. \nI got inside and picked up a tray at 11:55 am, so the wait was about 25 minutes. I ordered #5 Regular hot beef udon (Regular is $7.90 and large is $8.90), with one sweet potato tempura and a coke soda. It was about $11 something. The price was pretty good for good quality food. The employee outside was calling it \"high quality cafeteria food\". \nAfter you grab your tray and a plate (if you plan on getting tempura or extras), an employee takes your order for what choice of udon noodles you want. After you get your bowl of udon, you have a choice of choosing your own tempura (around $1.50-$2 ea) and onigiri ($1-$1.60 ea). You then pay for your meal, and then to your left, there is a sauce bar with utensils and the soda machine. \nI was kinda nervous I wouldn't find a seat. Since I'm sitting by myself, I didn't want to take a table with four seats. But after I got my tempura sauce and utensils, someone left at a table for two so I quickly sat down there because I was so hungry. The tables were kinda close together, so I had to kinda squeeze by another table of two to sit down. \nEverything was very delicious and tasted fresh. The sweet potato tempura was a huge circle so I started cutting it with my fork and chopsticks. I guess it looked like I was having difficulty, that I believe it was the manager kindly handed me a knife. After I left, there was still a zig zag line of three rows (see pic). I think I will be back when the line of people slowly dies down (when there is no more lines) because it felt a bit too crowded for me. But I recommend their food! I'll be back to try the onigiri. \nIf you are trying to avoid the wait, it's better to go early and on a weekday.

One thing I really want to highlight is that the musubis are a WASTE OF MONEY! It is 98% rice and one bite of tuna/salmon. Disappointing! \n\nTips:\n- LONG WAITS!! Go before opening or odd hours.\n- Take advantage of the self-serve toppings bar! Tempura flakes are DELICIOUS in udon. \n- Make sure your add-ons are actually added on.

Maybe it was because I came during the soft opening and (maybe?) they were still getting in the groove of their systems? Probably. Why it wasn't love at first sight? The udon broth tasted salty as compared to the more complex flavors of what I've grown to love from their MargKame Udon counterpart. The line was crazy (Waikiki's MaruKame Udon moved WAYYYY faster)... but I guess it was expected since it was open for nearly only a month and everyone was still flocking to this new place. Also, I purchased a soft drink, but they were out of ice (a bummer for me because I like to counter the hot soup with a super cold drink). Nevertheless, my first visit was GOOD - very reasonable prices for SF, crispy tempura, and LOTS of free add-ons (including parsley). \n\nHowever, I recently went back for a THIRD time... and I was surprisingly pleased at the improvements since my first initial (and second) visit. \n1) Line moved way faster. Less than 15 minutes in line. \n2) The broth of the Kake was less salty and more dynamic in taste. \n3) The curry udon was amazing and had a lot of beef pieces in the curry broth. \n4) Tempura and musubi bar was plentiful and loaded with all the choices - nothing missing.\n5) No problems with no ice for fountain drinks. :) \n6) **Only issue was that they ran out of regular (not extra sweet) tempura sauce AND baskets of tempura flakes were all out. Both were not refilled for maybe 10 minutes... but that was ok, since the food was perfect without either. \n\nOverall, I will definitely be back.

The line moved quickly. \n\nMarugame is a self-serve restaurant that we get to order the food in an assembly chain. First, we picked up the tray and headed to the noodle station. The menu was very basic, with only 5 or 6 types of udon to choose from. Once we picked our bowl, the employee would prepare it infront of us in a matter of minutes! Next, we followed the line to the tempura station to take any fried food we like: there were a range of options from seafood to meat to vegetables. All around $2/each. I had the squid and sweet potato - they were lukewarm and tasted standard. After that, we paid our meal immediately at the cashier and headed to the condiment station to add scallions, add soy sauce and flakes etc depend on our preference. \n\nThe reason why I gave Marugame 5 stars is because of its Udon noodle. I chose the #1 on the menu which had beef and poached egg. The beef was marinated well and tasted so delicious. The broth was the best I've ever had. It's mildy sweet and was NOT salty at all. My bowl had little amount of broth - I think this is the way the restaurant prepares this bowl but I'd love to have more cuz I'm the person who sips the last spoon of broth when eating noodles!

I waited 45 minutes on a Friday at about 11:00am. I expected to wait but would I come back to wait that long for udon? Probably not. \n\nThe noodles had a nice chew to it and the broth was tasty as well but seemed to be just like any other udon you would get at any Japanese restaurant. I got the vegetable tempura which was majority of onions. Shrimp and asparagus tempura were good. It's tempura. Again, it's as though you would get it anywhere else. \n\nI sat in the back corner of the restaurant and noticed one thing: the hold up of the long line is the cashier. The food comes out instantly, there are tons of open tables, tempura and drinks you get as you move down the line. They definitely need more cashiers. If they had at least one more, I guarantee you the line would move exponentially faster. \n\nThey also need to pick up on their service. They were out of utensils and tempura sauces. I waited at least 15 minutes for them to bring some out after asking multiple times. At one point I saw people just opening the bottom drawer and getting things themselves in the bins. \n\nFor me this was a one time thing. I'm not going to wait 1-2 hours for udon where I can get at any mediocre Japanese restaurant.", "author": "Marie N."}

Although when we went inside the restaurant and I looked behind me I was shocked that the line grow like crazy since it was an odd time to eat lunch. \n\nI've been to the Marugame Monzo in LA which is a traditional sit down and order from a menu type of restaurant. Their more extensive selections are more tasty than this particular Marugame Udon however that isn't to say this location's dishes weren't good.\n\nMy sister and I both enjoyed the Mentai Kamatama the most. Mentai is savory cod roe (fish eggs) and mixed with the udon brings a creamy dish that taste of the sea. \n\nThe other two that we tried was the Beef Udon and the Egg Drop Chicken Udon. The beef udon is okay; just wasn't as good as Marugame Monzo in LA. The Egg Drop Chicken Udon was good at first because the sauce was thick however it becomes more watery as you eat it and we got kinda sick of it. Both of us wished it was just Egg Drop soup by itself, minus the udon since it's just a bit too much. \n\nWe also got the Kombu, Tuna Mayo, Salmon Flake, Mentai and Inari Onigiri rice balls. They're all great though they are more heavy on the rice side. The stand out one was the Mentai Fish Eggs rice ball. \n\nUnfortunately, this place just doesn't stack with their Marugame Monzo location in LA however it's a great fix for people who are craving fresh udon since we do lack in that department in the Bay Area. It's worth giving a try if you enjoy noodles however, I wouldn't personally wait more than 30 minutes since their dishes didn't blow my palate as the ones in LA did.", "author": "Rainar W."}

Curry udon was finally released December 27 and the spicy chicken udon debuts on January 3rd. I came with my friends exactly at 5 pm and the line was already long! We waited about 15 minutes to finally reach the doors.\n\nWhen you first enter, you see the employees making fresh udon noodles. The setup of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You wait in line, grab a tray, and go.\n\nFirst, you tell the worker what you're order is and he/she gives you your bowl of udon with broth. I was slightly disappointed that they do not serve eggs yet :( they said that eggs will be served after the soft opening is done. Next, you can choose from a variety of tempura and musubi inari. Then you're all set! It's that simple. \n\nAfter you pay, there is a condiments bar with fresh green onions, cilantro, tempura crumbs, etc to top off your udon. They have hot tempura sauce that's in dispenser but be careful! My friend almost burned her hand because the tempura sauce was so hot. Hahah there's other seasonings you can add as well. \n\nSurprisingly, for how packed it was it was not difficult to find a seat. They have seating inside and a couple tables outside by the line. It was freezing so I preferred to sit inside. \n\nI got beef udon, my friends got curry udon and bukkake udon and all I can say is that all our stomachs were pleased. The udon comes in regular or large and the regular is already filling especially if you get tempura or musubi on the side. \n\nIt's safe to say I will probably be here every week.

So think Chipotle, but udon and also sweet tomatoes where you can tong in all the tempura you want priced a la carte. In theory, the lines should be super fast because all there is to it is someone ladling in your bowl of udon and handling you the bowl, then you go off to scoop your sides onto your tray.\n\nThe menu is limited It's soft opening and will continue to be soft opening until roughly 1/18/2018, which is what the sticker on their menu says, anyways.\n\nWe got the #5 which is beef udon, partly because our friend said he got the curry udon (which was another available one at this SF location's soft opening) in Hawaii and that he said it sucks. I'm a stickler with Japanese curry, so I took his word on it and passed on the curry udon.\n\nNow, I'm going to leave somewhat of a different review here, and say that in the grand scheme of things, the udon tasted ALL RIGHT. The udon noodle was nice, chewy yet firm and the broth was good. The tempura was excellent.\n\nThe critique is this: The udon is too damn sweet. From the broth, to the beef, it's like they cooked and simmered it in an army of vidalia onions. You ever had a french onion soup where it was just too sugary? I got the same feeling here. There's a deleted scene in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory where Marugame's udon is in the movie and the kids swim in it and says its their favorite Jolly Rancher flavor. Too dang sweet, man. After finishing my bowl, I felt hella sugared out. A milktea afterwards would've been too gratuitous at that point, pastries at Tartine? Forget about it. Most palettes would enjoy this, and rightly so.\n\nAnother thing is, Marugame should handle seating a little better before they let it loose to the public. When doors opened on the dot, there were people in way back of the line, who probably weren't even going to see a bowl of udon on their trays for another 30 minutes, starting to walk in and save seats already, while people who were the first dozen in line were still ordering. What gives, guys???? Seriously. I thought it was rude and a jerk move.\n\nAlso, lots of parents who brought their kids were letting their kids just  roam around, while many people who just finished purchasing their udon, were trying to walk back to their tables carrying said udon (which is stupid hot). There was literally one kid who walked up to my knee, and if I didn't see him earlier before he disappeared under my tray, I would've tripped over the kid, probably landed on the kid, spilled all the udon on the kid and the kid would've probably have been bludgeoned and burned to the first or second degree. Parents, you don't want your kids to be hurt over some $10 bowl of udon, please handle your kids.\n\nI'd come back, possibly after the grand opening to check out some of their signature udon that was held back during this soft opening.", "author": "Tom S."}

Udon noodles are freshly made in front of you as you watch the dough go through the noodle maker and come out in beautiful strands before going into the water. The set-up to order reminds me of buffet style except you have to pay for each item you grab. Or I imagine this is what it is like in a Japanese school cafeteria. After you get your udon bowl, you can also grab musubi (I don't know why they call it musubi since there is no spam musubi and it looks like onigiri [rice balls]) or tempura to add on to your meal. Most of the snacks add-ons are around $1.50 or so. The first time I had the onigiri, there was very little filling throughout so it was a bit plain but the second time has improved. The cod one is pretty good! You might have to wait a bit if they run out as they are continually making them behind the counter. \n\nYou pay at the end of the counter as they ring up your order on the iPad. The receipt doesn't show your individual items pricing and just the total paid. Water is self-serve at the water spout by the soda machine. \n\nDon't forget to check out the toppings bar behind the soda machine. You can add in green onions, cilantro, ginger, tempura flakes, tempura sauce, sesame powder, chili powder, etc to complete your meal. Your udon looks really plain if you don't. You're literally wondering why it doesn't match the photo on the wall until you reach the toppings bar at the end.\n\nBEEF UDON\nBeef is soft and delicious.

After you're done eating, you bring your tray over to the back (like in the dining commons at college) and you can throw away your trash and leave the dishes on the shelf so that they can wash it. \n\nFor soft opening, the line is long and stretches out and it looks daunting but the line moves pretty quickly.

I would say that this was quite similar to a pho broth, and the beef that they put in your soup is a little on the 'greasy' side, and you can definitely see the fat layer on top of your soup, just a heads up.  The portion size was enormous for me, so I took my leftovers home and ate the rest the next day!\n\nOther people with me tried the Curry Udon bowl and I was able to try their broth as well.

A host approached us and walked us through the menu - he was very informative. He gave us a few recommendations and we decided on the beef udon and the tonkatsu udon. We each ordered a large beef udon. And large tonkatsu not realizing how much food it was. \n\nWe finally approached the door where you can literally see the udon dough being rolled out and put into a machine to make the noodles. Then they're freshly put into hot water and ready to serve. I loved this place this much because you were able to see how fresh the noodles are. Someone then takes your order and it literally make to order. There's an option where you can get different types of tempura. We settled for the chicken, shrimp, squid, zucchini and asparagus. Mind you, they're like tempura on steroids so it's totally shareable. \n\nBill came out to less than $50 for 3 large bowls of udon along with probably 9 pieces of tempura. Totally worth it! They also have an area where you can add condiments such as - tempura bits, green onions and cilantro.\n\nI recommend this place to anyone who loves a great, cheap, fresh experience with food!!!

Thank goodness the line was not too bad and waited about 15 minutes before getting into the building to order. The system is essentially similar to Chipotle. You pick up your tray, order your udon, grab any extra tempura or onigiris, pay and add your toppings. \n\nI ordered the regular nikutama (#8), which was honestly very disappointing. At the very least the udon was the highlight of this lunch; chewy and \"bouncy\" noodles. However, every other aspect was just unimpressive. They give you a very small ladle of room temperature broth that barely covered the noodles. The beef closely reminded me of bulgolgi, except worse and overly sweet. The soft-boiled egg was very soft and essentially thickened the broth since yolk was very runny as well. Adding ginger and other condiments helped offset some of the strong sweet flavors, but the whole experience was not the best. \n\nI also grabbed myself some shrimp and fishcake tempura. Cold, too much panko, greasy, flavorless tempura. Do not recommend at all. I'd save those $4 for boba to wash this meal down. \n\nOverall, expensive and didn't taste the best either.", "author": "Lisa L."}

I ordered the regular size hot nikutama udon which comes with beef and a soft boiled egg. I also got shrimp tempura, inari, imitation crab onigiri, and salmon flake onigiri. The egg in the udon was a littleee more raw than I'd like it to be, but it was still good. Also, I felt like the udon soup wasn't as hot as I wanted it to be or maybe it just got cold really fast?? I'd say the price is pretty fair for the udon (~$9), but the onigiri wasn't really worth. It was around $1.50 for an onigiri, but only the very top had the meat and the rest was rice so it was literally only one bite of meat... \n\nI like how there's a self serve station for green onions and cilantro so you can customize your bowl. The tempura sauce is also self serve, but it's a little salty so don't dip too much. \n\nAlso, don't be intimidated by the line because it goes by super quick!", "author": "Selina H."}

We probably waited about 2 hours. Honestly, I don't understand why the wait took so long. There's plenty of seating inside, it's fast food style so technically the wait shouldn't be as bad, but I think they're still working on their operations (since it recently opened) and hopefully make it more efficient.\nThey were out of several ingredients so I was bummed about that, but nonetheless, it was delicious.

It's not as efficient as it could be, but given I went on grand opening day, it makes sense. They had a lot of staff to try to make it run as smooth as possible.\n\nBasic gist is this: 1) Pick your udon (I suggest getting a L size since it's not that much bigger anyway); 2) Pick your tempura or side dishes (incl rice balls); 3) Unlimited toppings and side sauces bar!!! \n\nI recommend the beef udon as a base, and then build it up with tempura (I actually liked the chicken tempura) and grab a rice ball while you're at it. Beef udon feels light due to the soup base, but packs a punch. I really liked the chicken tempura, as well as the squid tempura. The mentaiko cream musubi is EXCELLENT too, by the way. My bf got the curry udon and liked it, but I would recommend that if you're into something heavier. You could easily get away with a dinner under $10-15 if you are wise enough, but I'd say it's worth the wait.

I heard the Grand Opening today had a crazy wait though. With this line it feels like it's kinda constantly moving at least, so you're not just sitting there waiting for your party of 2 to be called or whatever. \n\nI got chicken breast tempura, vegetable kakiage (not even going to try to spell it right), shrimp, and zucchini. I definitely over ordered. The chicken breast was pretty meaty, vegetable had too many onions, nothing wrong with the shrimp, and the zucchini was maybe a little too moist.\n\nOne thing my friend loves about this place is that there is a tempura flakes bar, so you can add as maaaaaaany tempura flakes, green onions, and cilantro as you want, which is awesome because I love all 3.\n\nI'll definitely be back, probably towards their closing times so that we don't have to deal with traffic.

On a Sat night around 6pm, expected wait is 1-1 1/2 hrs. Yikes.

The soup stock is a kelp dashi, a Japanese kelp base with various dried fish and soy sauce additions. Along with Udon, MARUGAME also features fresh tempura and handmade Musubi. The goal is a custom noodle meal.\nWith all that said, this was totally worth the wait. The udon noodles had a great texture, they stayed sturdy the entire duration of our meal. The broth was flavorful and it had a lot of depth. There was a large selection of tempura items and each one was visually appealing, but most of all they were light and crispy with lots of flavor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-26", "description": "We came on one of the soft opening days when the menu was still limited to only 4 udon bowls. There were at least 30 people waiting in line ahead of us around 11 but it did have pretty steady movement every few minutes. They have a good amount of seating and you order first then find seats. We got the beef udon (L) and Kama-Age udon (L). They're pretty generous with the amount of udon in each order so a regular size probably would have been enough because two large bowls was super filling. We also got shrimp tempura and squid tempura. There were many other tempura options and some onigiri too. They have a toppings bar with tempura flakes, green onion, cilantro, ginger, and sauces. \nThe beef in the beef udon was like beef don (sweet with onions). I felt like it would've gone better on dry udon or rice rather than udon. I did like the kake soup though. It was flavorful without being salty. The Kama-Age udon comes with kake sauce which is a lot stronger than kake soup. I think if you added the kake sauce to the kama water that the kama-age udon comes in, you would just get kake soup. So the biggest difference would be the beef and what your udon is soaking in longer. They both tasted great but for the price, I would be ok without the beef and would just go for the kama-age and load up on toppings for more flavor. The dipping does get tedious for the kama-age but getting that brief burst of flavor is actually preferable. Also the soup you would be drinking would just be kama water and your toppings, which seems healthier.\nI would skip the squid tempura (at least if it wasn't recently fried) and just get the shrimp. The batter wasn't oily and was a nice fluffy crisp. It's kind of a lottery to see if you arrive in line at the right time to catch tempura being fried fresh.", "author": "Christine L."}

The restaurant layout, the line, the ordering system is a carbon copy of Waikiki's. But it ends there.  The menu has less options, the soup proportion isn't very generous, the overall taste is lacking some sweetness, no spam masubi and the cart return is quite abandoned. \n\nWith that said, I will say that it is one of the best udon places in San Francisco, though my experience is just mostly downtown and Japantown, I have yet to try the Sunset/Richmond ones.

I got a day off from work today, and decided that today would be the perfect day to try again. \nI'm not surprised that other helpers waited in 45+ minutes, which I wasn't trying to do, so after reading several reviews, it sounded like around 2-3 PM would be the best time to avoid long lines. \nI got in line around 2:45, and paid at around 2:55PM.

It is a cafeteria style restaurant where you grab a tray, and after getting your udon, there are several sides to choose from, self-serve. I got the tempura chicken, sweet potato tempura, and a potato croquette. The total came out to be around $15. \nOne thing that I love about this place that I wish the Waikiki location had would be the self-serve tempura flakes and green onion for the soup. I piled that ishhhh on lol. \nThe tempura chicken was good, just a little salty for my taste, but anything fried is going to be salty. The sweet potato was good, but was a little harder than I'd like it to be. The croquette was a little bland but that didn't stop me from eating half of it lol. \n\nOverall, I would say that I prefer the Waikiki location over this one.

First time hearing about this place and didn't know what to expect, but my experience was great!\n\nLocation is at a mall, so there's plenty of parking but was a pretty crowded area in the afternoon. We were welcomed by a grand opening with balloons, photo backdrops, and cheery staff. Line wasn't too bad around 3pm, we had maybe a 15 minute wait. The dining experience is a unique one with energetic workers (when a worker shouts thank you to a customer leaving, the rest of the crew repeats). The dining process is getting in line, picking up a tray (and plate if you want sides), picking your bowl of udon, watch them make it in front of you, and pick your own sides of tempura, musubi, and more-- buffet style. After you pay, there's a condiment/topping bar right behind the cash register, where you can add tempera flakes, green onions, or sauces to your tray. \n\nI had their curry udon and some tempura, and both were delicious. The udon noodles were really soft, some the best tasting udon I've experienced by far. The curry was also great, especially on a rainy day. For the tempura, I got a zucchini, shrimp, fish, and sweet potato. All fried pretty well with good texture and tasted great with the tempura sauce they have at the condiment bar. \n\nI'd definitely recommend this place! The udon selection has a lot of good options with ranging prices, and you control how much extra you want by picking your sides laying right in front of you (with price tags).

This is unreal (in a bad way). It turns out the noodle-cooking are all done by $15 Americans and cooks are slow. The workers don't keep enough udon noodles ready, and they often have to repeat customers orders, since they don't seem confident. \n\nIn Marugame shops in Japan, by the time you are ready to order, the udon noodles comes instantly from their table along with the soup. Here, it takes 2-3 minutes after you place an order - creating unnecessary back-up all the way outside of the store.  Long lines doesn't necessarily mean it's that good. This is an example.\n\nI think their serving can be improved vastly - they just need to bring back the HQ people and improve on the customer flow. As a hourly worker from SF, you'll have no idea how to make the line flow any better.\n\nThe soup is too salty, even by high-blood-pressure Asian standards. \n\nBy the way, I have no idea how they pass city ADA regulations. The interior has less than 2ft to go through between chairs and it will be impossible for wheelchair patrons to go in/out. I wouldn't be surprised if they get reported.", "author": "Another R."}

Had to wait an hour on a Saturday night.  Prices are reasonable, $7.90 medium bowl and $8.90 for a large bowl of udon.  The Noodles are FRESH!  Waiting in line you can watch them make it from a pizza size dough ball.  Then as you are going through the line the person adds whatever broth and meat to your udon.  I had the large curry beef and she covered my fresh noodles with two huge scoops of thick meat broth.  Then you if you want, you can pick freshly deep fried tempura.  You can pick your choice from a wide variety of different types of tempura in front of you.  This is helpful for me because I am not a tempura connoisseur.   They were all less that $2 apiece.  Then to top it all off, there is a topping bar with green onions, cilantro, sauce, and deep fried crunchy tempura batter.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-04", "description": "Just tried this place for the first time earlier for dinner.  My bf and I tried it and both agreed that this place was simple, tasty and best  of all, a great price for freshly made udon.  Upon entering, you order first and pay, seat yourself and eat-and-go.\nOnce you enter, you can clearly see the udon being made and cooked from scratch and put together in an assembly line way through the glass.  \n\nI got the curry udon and my boyfriend got the spicy chicken udon. The curry udon was really good in flavor and texture. The soup was slightly thick being that it was curry but not overbearingly saucy or anything.  The curry had pieces of beef in it, however, I surprisingly found myself not really caring much for it.  \nThe spicy chicken udon, on the other hand, was also tasty.  The soup was a lot different from what I got. Compared to the curry udon, it wasn't as noticeably thick, but still had a lot of flavor. The flavor itself was spicy, sour and sweet.  Although it was a strange combo of flavors that I'm not quite used to, it was still pretty good. \nAside from the soups, the noodles itself were great in texture and flavor. \n\nAlong with udon, this place also serves fried tempura meats and vegetables.  Of the side dishes, we tried chicken tempura, tempura fish cake, potato croquette, salmon onigiri and the shiso one.  \n\nThe tempura foods, aside from the non crispy/crunchy fish cake tempura, were pretty good in the crunch factor and tasty when dipped in sauce.  All the sides were basically under heat lamps so they weren't as warm and good. \nAlso the onigiris we got were not very good at all!!!, I recommend skipping them completely being that they had little to no flavor and were tiny for what you pay for. \n\nOverall, this place was pretty fresh and a good price.  Definitely recommend trying this place for lunch", "author": "Daisy S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-14", "description": "I loved the location in Oahu; and this one is nearly identical. I love the freshly made noodles, so chewy! I love the simplicity of the udon options, I love the selection of the tempura (note to self: try not to overdo it, 1-2 pieces per person is enough oil. :P) and I don't even usually LIKE udon!\n\nSo why would some people write negative reviews? Certainly, it is their own personal experience, they are well within their rights to; I would never say they're wrong. What I can tell you is how to temper your own expectations and hopefully have a better time. \n\nFirst, the line is ridiculous. The line was ridiculous in Hawaii too, so either be prepared to wait around 45 minutes (bring a book or a friend), or come right about closing time. or really in between lunch and dinner. I'd say when we left around 2pm, there was still a line, but maybe it was a 30 min line. When we came at 9 pm, still a 45 min wait. So maybe we just have to deal. Keep in mind, this is right next to a college campus, so students will come WHENEVER. \n\nSecond, understand the product. \n- The udon options are very simple. Some have more broth, some have less broth. [Nikutama is one that inadvertently tricks you, there is less broth in that one.] Some are cold (noodles will be chewier), some are hot. They're all super simple and straightforward. The ones with meat will be slightly oilier than the ones without. The curry one is spicy, and potentially salty. Get the soft-boiled egg! I love egg yolk, and it adds so much to the udon. \n- With the tempura, you have your standard shrimp- then a bunch of different options. (I like the squid, but haven't had it here yet.) With veggies, the sticks of zucchini have the largest vegetable to batter ratio (potentially most healthy). I personally love the sweet potato. They are expensive add-ons. I would try to stick to just 1-2 pieces per person. \n- Then you have your rice products: know they are mostly rice, don't go in expecting there to be much filling. Don't get it if you expect there to be any filling, that way if you have a tiny bit- you're ecstatic! \n- Have fun with the complimentary toppings! I always add a ton of green onion and tempura flakes. They also have spicy toppings and dipping sauce for tempura. \n\nThird, this is fast food. I know. I know. It's crazy (because of the line and the hype), but this is essentially fast food. Don't go in expecting it to be a Michelin rated restaurant where the staff tell you where all the ingredients are sourced and how frequently they forage for mushrooms. It's literally cafeteria style fast food. Of course it makes sense that you should be able to get better udon at a sit-down restaurant. Don't go in thinking you're going to get super wowed. There is hype, and a long line, but it is still fast food.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

I've tried the one is Waikiki years ago but was not fond of it that time.\n\nFood: I ordered a large beef udon with an egg. First off, a large is A LOT to finish, so I would definitely stick to a regular the next time. The broth was flavorful and the fresh udon was really good. I sprinkled a lot of their \"spicy\" condiment but it didn't make it spicy for me so I wish there was an option of a spicy paste, but not sriracha. The beef is a little sweet and I don't like sweet meat, but I didn't mind the beef. \n\nShrimp tempura-it was not warm and crispy. Of course I should have expected that when it sits out for a while. Definitely try to pick a fresh one. \n\nPotato croquette-I didn't like how it's mushy inside. I've had it at other Japanese ramen restaurants and it's chunkier inside so it had more texture. Pass on this. \n\nI like how they have the bar of condiments because I like to pack on the greens. \n\nService: Everyone was really polite and it moved as fast at it could in the line. There were a couple of employees that stood near the condiment island to assist customers. \n\nPrice: Definitely is cheap for a bowl of udon but if you start adding in the sides, of course it will be more costly.

It's pretty amazing to be able to see your food being made in front of you, and then getting to order it right away. \n\nYou wait in this line and basically order what you want with the guys making the udon, receive your bowl, and as you move down the assembly line, you can pick up a variety of tempura if you want. (I will say $1.90 for ONE shrimp tempura is quite hefty of a price considering it wasn't anything spectacular. It was just a good regular shrimp tempura.) Once you've finished picking all the things you want to devour, you pay for your food at the end of this assembly line and move your way onto the island of toppings. They've got green onions, cilantro, ginger, spices, and sauces for you to top your delicious hot bowl of noodle heaven. \n\nSince it's just a soft opening, they didn't have everything on the menu available just yet. There were about 4 of their dishes that wouldn't be available until their grand opening on Jan 18. I did order the beef udon and I will say, it was prettyyyy damn good. The thinly sliced beef was marinated in this beautiful sweet sauce, garnished with some thinly sliced onions...MMMMMMM so tender and juicy and .. you just have to try it yourself. The broth was rich in flavor yet light enough to drink the whole bowl. However, the biggest disappointment was the noodles. Now I've had freshly made udon before, and the texture is a big difference. Even though you can watch the gentlemen making the udon in front of your eyes, somehow, something tasted different. Don't get me wrong, the udon was chewy and bouncy and delicious - it just wasn't what I was expecting. Honestly, it had the same texture and look as the frozen packs of udon you get at the grocery store. Except these were exceptionally longer strands of noodz. \n\nI'd definitely come back though - I can't wait to try the rest of their menu!!", "author": "Ava F."}

I was so curious but wasn't willing to wait a whole 2 hrs... so I randomly decided to check this place out on a Monday at 5pm. Thankfully, the line wasn't too bad! It extended outside and wrapped around a bit but it only ended up being a 20-30 min wait. Pretty fast! \n\nI wasn't sure on what to order so I looked through yelp and decided on the nikutama udon while my husband ordered the curry udon. The nikutama looked like the perfect combo of light broth, good amount of meat, and a perfectly poached egg.  I was excited. We also got an assortment of tempura.. sweet potato, shrimp, veggie, and fish. All of this totaled to be $31... I was surprised at how the cost added up but I thought, hey, why not just try it all to see what it's all about. \n\nThey had actually run out of the nikutama broth but they offered to give us a number and have it brought over to our table when it was ready. But when they brought my udon over, there was absolutely NO broth... I knew that the udon was going to have a little broth but my bowl had absolutely no broth. I thought maybe the noodles had already absorbed it... but when I tasted it, there was no broth flavor... so I asked one of the servers and they offered to bring some extra broth. Once I added the broth, it was perfect! The noodles were an excellent consistency. I love my noodles slightly chewy. The curry udon was good as well. But to be honest, while I loved the noodles, the overall taste of the udon was decent. I can't say that it was anything spectacular... but it was a good experience. My husband and I both agreed that the nikutama was better than the curry. The tempura was the same as any typical Japanese restaurant. But just a little pricier.. but we enjoyed the self serve sauce and topping station. \n\nI would honestly never wait more than 20 min for a bowl here. But it was a good experience so I would definitely recommend it to others.", "author": "Janice H."}

Why? Let's get started! \n\nWhat I ordered: \n\nBeef Udon 3x\n2 vegetable nest tempura\n1 squid tempura \n1 shrimp tempura\n\nThe beef udon brought me back to Jimbocho station when I was at Tokyo eating udon for the first time. Same set up and great customer service. It's can never be an exact replica of the udon at Japan but this comes close!! The broth was sooo flavorful and paired nicely with the beef that had a sweet caramelized onion flavor. Yum! It's really nice watching how your food is prepared and seeing the cooks make the dough, have the dough rise, cut the dough, and then cook it. It really makes you appreciate the udon you will be eating. The wait time is around 20-25 minutes but it's honestly so worth it!!!! I can't wait to come back on the 27 when the menu expands more!! The day I went, the tempura was nicely done. Not over battered, and nicely fried and not oily at all! After ordering your udon, getting some tempura to pair it off, that is when you pay. The squid and vegetable nest looking tempura are really good and highly suggest getting it! Now on the side is a sauce bar with all your fixings to ump the level of the already tasty udon! Their is fried tempura bits for the crunch factor, green onion, cilantro, dashi sauce, hot tempura sauce, and a cold sweet tempura sauce. The cold sweet tempura sauce pairs nicely with the chicken kaarage they have! I can't wait to review it when it fully opens. But for now, happy eating! Totally worth it!", "author": "Roseanne V."}

Adding the tempura flakes with green onions and the poached egg over it all made it really enjoyable to eat. The only problem I had with my food was that the tempura chicken was nothing special.

The staff was frying the tempura right as we were going through the line and it was fried beautifully - amazingly light and crispy.\nSalmon flake musubi ($1.60 each) - rather disappointing as there was only less than a spoonful of salmon at the top and barely any throughout, so the whole thing lacked flavor.

I came here with a friend on a Friday at around 11:30am and there was a line outside, but it went by quickly. This is a cafeteria-style restaurant, meaning you order in a line, and pay at the end, since there's many add-ins/sides that you can get as well! I got the nikutama udon (#2), which comes with udon (freshly made!!), beef, and a soft-boiled egg. My friend got the beef udon, and her portion was definitely bigger (maybe twice my size? even though we both ordered regular sized), and the only main difference between our dishes was the egg and higher price of mine. There's also tempura that you can add on to the side, but I opted for the salmon onigiri, which was a little salty for me. At the end, you can also add toppings (tempura flakes!!) to your dish to spice it up. Overall, the udon was delicious and there's a good amount of sides, but I would definitely want to try another flavor/dish.", "author": "Lisa C."}

Finally got to try this place during a weekday after lunch time, there was still a line outside but not as long as the other days I've seen. When you first walk in, you see the employees making fresh udon and washing it out I am guess. The menu was slim pickins but I decided to go for the curry udon and my husband decided to go for the beef udon. As lined up to order, I feel that the udon portions were pretty much the same for a large bowl vs a regular bowl, so your basically paying more for the soup?  That is not the case, since I saw a few large bowls the soup wasnt that much and it didnt look appealing at all. I finally got to where you can get the add-ons and very very disappointed on what they provided. I got a few tempura items, ( shrimp, veggies and mixed veggies). I was very disappointed in the tempura items, the mixed veggies was basically just fried onion, and the rest of the tempura had too much batter and it was luke warm not even hot. Now for the udon part, the curry soup base was too thick for my liking AND it was very very salty, so it seems like the soups there are sitting there all day and they just add new soup on top, and the beef broth at first looked really plain didnt look like beef broth at all, but after trying it, it was VERY salty as well. The only thing I probably liked was the udon.. but I def had  better. All in all this was def overrated and people made this place sound like a must try, I was not impressed and probably wont be coming back because shortly after both my husband and I ended up with stomach aches.  I guess one star for the good customer service, but seriously the food was not great at all.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

I took others' advice and went during lunchtime on a weekday, the wait was merely a half hour. As soon as you enter the doorway, you're immediately hit with an irresistible concoction of bubbling udon pots and the savory smell of simmering broth. Being able to watch the cooks make, chill, and measure out udon noodle portions was extremely satisfying while waiting in line to place your order. I was torn between many of the menu selections, but ended up choosing the Kake Udon with an added poached egg. I also couldn't resist and picked out an Inari and Mentai Mayo Musubi.\n\nAfter adding a criminal amount of green onion, tempura flakes, and ginger to my bowl, I dug in...and was overall really satisfied! The flakes provided great texture, the toppings were fresh and made the broth taste delightfully complex with each mouthful. Although the noodles were nice and chewy when I first started eating, they soon became somewhat soggy, perhaps a bit faster than I expected? The inari was well-balanced- the sweet bean curd covering really complemented the vinegar-y rice inside. I, sadly, could not finish the mentai mayo musubi as the flavor ended up being too strong and fishy for my liking.\n\nOverall, a great addition to the Stonestown area!

The rest of the reviewers must have NEVER had udon in Japan or they're just novelty food whores. The tempura alone should have knocked these ratings down. \n\nMy husband and I decided to try this because we had to pick up from the Apple store that evening. We stood in the line and got inside relatively quickly. We ordered two different types of udon, grabbed a few tempura pieces and breezed past the condiment bar with no problem. \n\nWhew had to clean our own table to sit down but didn't mind. We understand they're busy. \n\nHowever, we could not forgive the quality of the food.  The noodles were alright in texture but the broth/dipping sauce was either too sweet or taste less! The beef was full of fat and tendon. The soft boiled egg was the only thing that seemed right in my dish. \n\nDo not eat the tempura.  I have never had tempura so thickly covered in batter and drenched in oil. Some pieces were cold when we bit into it. Instead of light and crispy, this was doughy and cold. Some pieces were completely batter. Gross!  \n\nBottom line: If you're a mindless lemming who enjoys long lines and cafeteria style dining, you will enjoy this experience.  If you've ever made your own fresh or instant udon at home or have had udon in Japan, save your self the sever disappointment. \n\nWith all the great Japanese places in the city, I'm honestly shocked at the good reviews people have given.

The udon was very soft and you can see the workers make them fresh, while you are in line. Before you order, you grab a tray, and a small dish. The smaller dish is where you can self serve pick diff types of tempura, or sushi rolls. I picked a fishcake tempura, which was an extra like 1.80, so total price was $12.15. Pretty affordable! It doesn't end there, because there is another self serve area, where you can pick green onions, cilantro, ginger, and regular tempura sauce, and sweet tempura sauce. Plenty of seating inside, and close to SFSU. Right by stonestown if you need to do shopping as well. Just return your trays when you are finished.

That's fine, but the chick made my friend and I wait by the Olive Garden even though we were the last ones and for a while too. But eh, that could be policy. The other reason I knocked off a star is because since it is in San Francisco, pretty common to have beggars or homeless people, whatever you may call them.

I usually wait about 20 minutes total. The food is good but it's not overflow line good. Those who have been there know what I mean by overflow line. \n\nMy favorite hot Nikutama Udon (#2) or Curry udon (#3). \n\nPro tip: The difference between regular and large is 50% more udon. They have full size piles and half size piles of udon. Regular gets one full size pile, large gets 1 full size and 1 half size piles. For $1 more for 50% more udon, I say go for it. But only if you can finish it. Take home udon sucks. \n\nMy only complaint is that the broth is consistently lukewarm. It needs to be streaming hot. I don't want to wait 20 minutes outdoors to come in and drink lukewarm soup. That just ruins the whole experience. \n\nIf you're going to get any of the seaweed wrapped rice balls, make sure you get one right out of their hands immediately after they wrap it. Seaweed touching warm rice gets soggy very fast so avoid those sitting in the tray unless you like rice wrapped in soggy seaweed. \n\nI come back regularly. It's a great value at Chipotle price.

I honestly had such high standards due to all the previous reviews but I was unfortunately let down when I tried this place. It's still grand opening so the line is pretty ridiculous still. I came here with my boyf on a Friday night around 8:30 and waited around 45-1hr, so come here as early as you can to avoid lines or prepare to wait! My boyf has been to the one in Hawaii so he was expecting the same quality, we even spoke to one of the workers about this and was reassured it was of the same standard so we were super excited! I got the Nikutama and boyf got the curry udon. Sadly, I think because we came near closing time, they ran out of eggs ;( or something about the machine was broken so I just had beef udon. We also got a couple of sides like the potato croquette, sweet potato tempura, salmon,crab, and furikaki rice musubis. The beef was bomb, super tender and flavorful. The broth itself tasted exactly like the beef, it was good at first but after a while it got really repetitive and way too salty. The noodles were honestly okay, it was very mediocre and I tried so hard to enjoy it but I was just meh :/ Boyf said his curry was okay, too salty as well and nothing compared to the Hawaii location. He said at the Hawaii one he came back the next day to order TWO different udons lmao, but that's not the case for this location. I felt like everything was just too salty. The musubis are a rip off ngl, there's barely any meat and it's all rice plus there's no flavor. I'm not giving up on this place though! The prices are really good here and the workers are SO friendly, I think because since they're still new they still have to adjust and work on things.

We went on a Sunday and luckily we didn't have to wait over an hour. We had an early dinner so we got there around 4:30pm and we got in by 5. (FYI: The best time to go according to the worker there is around 2-3pm). The menu is pretty limited but you can choose from variety of udon on the menu. My mom ordered the kamage udon and my dad and I ordered the nikutama udon. We actually all ordered a large size b/c it seems like the regular had a better portion. (If you're a big eater, get the large and if you're feeling somewhat hungry, get a regular size) I like that you can pick your own toppings/sides to eat with the udon. There were tons of options from sweet potatoes, fried squid, tempura shrimp, fried chicken, and some other toppings. The udon was freshly made in front of you within minutes. After you pay for your udon, you can add cilantros and green onions and some other sauces available by the cashier area.  \n\nIn all honesty, I wouldn't wait over an hour though for these udon.

HOWEVER, the moment I told my bf and his sister that there was a MARUGAME opening in SF, he looked at the photos and said \"we have to go\". Reason being that he usually doesn't like udon, but he loves MARUGAME. Being a student at SFSU, I know MARUGAME took over a sushi spot and I LOVE what they have done with the interior. It's very cafeteria style where you line up and make your way down the line and let them know what type of udon you want, then once they prepare your bowl you get to pick and choose a bunch of different tempura, then you pay at the end and go pick a seat. The wait wasn't very long at all, and i love how you get to see the udon being made as you stand in line. There's also a little bar island after you pay with green onion, fried tempura bits to add to your udon, etc. Don't be fooled like me, because I got the beef udon (large) and got two pieces of sweet potato and shrimp, and one piece of fish cake and one salmon onigiri. Man oh man was I shtufffffed. My bf got the egg and chicken udon (small) with one piece of shrimp and sweet potato also. I ended up letting him finish half of my beef udon and one sweet potato and one shrimp. It was the freshest and softest udon I have ever had. The broth was so light and refreshing, and the temperature of the udon is also perfect where you won't burn yourself if you dig in, but it's not too cold either. 10/10 would come again.", "author": "Tram H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-06", "description": "In San Francisco, there aren't many places that serve udon as its main offering. There are even fewer places that serve cold udon in addition to the normal hot udon. A recent addition to San Francisco, Marugame Udon is welcomed among San Francisco's sparse udon offerings. I came here on two separate occasions and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed with the udon, especially with the cold udon here. \n\nThe first time I came here was on a Saturday evening with some friends, and we were waiting in line for at least an hour and a half before we got to the front. Once we got to the front, we got to see the udon being prepared. I ordered the large cold Nikutama Udon because I rarely get to eat cold udon, and watched as they prepared my food. Even though it was freezing outside, I knew I wanted to get the cold udon because I haven't had such high-quality cold udon in such a long time. After my udon was served, I went to the tempura counter and deliberated what I should get. The tempura sides are self-serve, and I got the sweet potato tempura, zucchini tempura, asparagus tempura, squid tempura and the potato croquette. After I paid for the food at the cash register, there is a self-serve station where you can get your garnishes (scallions, tempura flakes, etc.). When I dove into the nikutama udon, I was delighted by the slightly sweet taste of the pork, the cold noodles and the nice cold broth that was filled up half the bowl. I started off with the vegetable tempura, and to be honest, it didn't make much of an impression on me. I moved on to the squid tempura and it tasted very mild, it had a very subtle squid taste. Finally, I went for the potato croquette and was blown away by how soft and fluffy it was. The potato croquette had a very soft crunch on its exterior, very easily broken once contact is made with your teeth. Hands-down, the potato croquette was the best among all the sides that I got, and it more than made up for the mellow taste of the tempura that I got before it. Overall, the highlights of the meal was the nikutama udon and the potato croquette, and it was a very satisfying meal overall. If I had to pick one thing that I didn't like about this particular visit, it would be the plastic spoons! For udon, I would rather have a large real spoon instead of a plastic spoon for ladling the noodles, but other than that, everything else was excellent.\n\nThe second time we came here, we went on a weekday evening to try to avoid the weekend rush. Unlike the long line that we encountered the first time, we just strolled to the front of the line with no wait time. This time, I ordered the Curry Udon with a side of potato croquette, fish croquette, and vegetable kakiage. When I went to the self-serve counter to get my garnishes, I noticed that the spoons this time are much larger and they're of the disposable kind, which probably meant that they've noticed the spoons used previously seemed out of place when compared to the rest of the utensils. The curry udon was thick, which was just how I like it since I believe udon taste better when the curry is thicker. There are slight traces of beef scattered throughout the curry, and as I made my way toward the bottom of the bowl, the curry became more liquidy, which was pretty interesting. The vegetable kakiage was tasty, and so was the potato croquette. The fish croquette, on the other hand, had a very mild taste, and I didn't particularly feel anything when I ate it. It could be because of the curry overpowering any taste that the fish croquette had, and I'm willing to chalk it up to that. But like my first time here, I was very happy with the meal, and I couldn't really find any cons this time. \n\nIn my opinion, Marugame Udon is perhaps the best udon establishment in San Francisco, I have to say that price-wise, and especially for San Francisco, the udon itself is very reasonably priced. I'm inclined to believe that they make their money on the tempura, since the tempura is where it starts to get pricey. I honestly didn't mind though, since being able to choose the amount of tempura you want was far better in my opinion than getting multiples of the same tempura. I would highly recommend coming here on a weekday if possible to avoid the long waits during the weekend. One of my friends said that one could easily be satisfied with a regular size udon since you're getting sides to go with it. I'm inclined to agree because I felt extremely bloated after getting a large udon and the tempura sides. The next time I come here, I could see myself getting the edamame salsa udon. My hope that in the near future, Marugame Udon would expand their repertoire of cold udon dishes, but for now, their current offerings is pretty good compared to the rest of the udon places in SF.", "author": "Nelson X."}

It's cool, at least it wasn't raining and they had a employee be outside handing out menus and telling people about the place. \n\nIn terms of price and quality, it's really good for what you get for sure. Got the bukkake udon and topped it with green onions and tempura bits, plus a shrimp tempura and some \"musubi\" aka really onigiri on the side (I know call me an elitist but I'm right). The noodles definitely tasted fresh, and also the broth is more concentrated which I really like since I think we're all used to seeing regular watery broth in most typical places. But I also wanna say this beats Kagawa-Ya (lol Uber udon) to me, since that was a bit pricier for something like this. Would much rather take the trip over to Stonestown where I can actually park my car too. \n\nAlso tried my boyfriend's niku udon, somehow he managed make his bowl taste like some kinda Japanese fusion pho. Don't take my word for this, it's probably because he added a ton of cilantro and green onion in his. But in all seriousness, that was good too :) \n\nHowever, the onigiri was alright. Could use an improvement in preparation with placement of fillings in the rice, and packaging to keep the seaweed from getting soggy with the rice.

With that in mind, I got the regular beef udon with a side of the vegetable tempura ball thing. My meal was about $11, which in comparison to what it costs in HI, is a bit more but it was still good. I also liked how there was a lot of seating inside and we didn't have to fight or wait for seats. Definitely will be back again for my udon fix", "author": "Michelle C."}

MARUGAME SF definitely did not disappoint.  Same concept as the other location.  Grab a tray, pick your selection, pile on the sides, pay, add on the toppings, find seating and devour.  I had #2, beef udon with poach egg.  Just as I remember, sweet beef perfectly balanced with well seasoned broth.  No additional flavor required, as with a lot of Japanese dishes.  The only thing I would request is, maybe, a tad bit more broth in my bowl.  But after reviewing others photo, maybe its intended to be served with lesser broth to show case the poach egg? (??)\nMy husband had the egg drop chicken udon.  I don't believe this one is served at the Waikiki location.  The broth in the egg drop chicken udon was a bit thick to me.  Very similar to Banh canh, maybe even thicker.   My husband enjoyed it since he didn't care too much for the sweet beef.  Me on the other hand, I would of if the broth was on the thinner side.  We also had the shrimp,  squid, and sweet potato tempera.  Everything was light and crispy as it should be.  PERFECTION. \nOverall, was it worth the hour and a half drive and another hour and a half wait?  If in town, definitely.. yes!", "author": "Fann H."}

After their grand opening, rumored their lines were going for hoursssss so I waited 3 months later hoping for the lines to die down. NOPE. That didn't happen. SO, STILL stood in line on a Sunday, waited about 40 minutes to get in. Overall the line moved pretty quickly. Once you get in, it's literally ordering which udon you want and they prepare it on the spot in front of you, kind of like a canteen cafeteria feel except you get to see how the udon's are made so that's kind of cool. \n\nWe tried #2 (Nikutama Udon) and #3 (Curry Udon). We both got the small size since we wanted to leave more room for tempura's and onigilly's. Both udon's were quite nice, one's on the light soupier side and the curry had a thicker sauce/soup. Both came with beef. \n\nOnto the tempura's and onigilly... DON'T GET VISUALLY DISTRACTED as they charge per piece, price are shown below the food. The tempura had a lighter golden crispy batter almost flaky, done nicely, doesn't feel too heavily patted on. Of course my favorites the shrimp ones! Classic. \n\nThe onigilly's quite standard, if you're having Japan withdrawals and you're missing those easy pickups at the convenient stores, they got you here. \n\nAfter you pay, there's a sauce bar nearby where you can grab all those tempura dipping sauce, hot sauce, green onions, and whatever you like to pair your food with. The tempura sauce pump was a little tricky. Can't tell if they ran out of sauce or the pump was just really hard to push down. Not gonna lie, it was very filling, the tempura's were so big we had to get a box and take them home. \n\nAs for the hype.... I mean it's not as blown out of proportions as I thought it would be, it's still satisfying. If compared to Udon Mugizo in Japantown, what differs most is the environment for me. This place feels more like a quick fix here whereas the Japantown one is where you can sit down, relax and take your time.", "author": "Aly C."}

I believe this is known as Marugame Seimen (what the Japanese characters on the store front reads) in Japan, and maybe Marukame Udon in Hawaii. Anyway, they are all part of the same chain, but the location in SF is a disappointment. The broth used at this location is quite different from the one in Japan (and Japanese udon broth in general!). Udon broth (or tsuyu) is based on dashi from dried bonito fish shavings plus kelp, soy sauce and a  bit of salt. The broth at Marugame Udon seems not to have enough of the dashi taste and is on the sweet side!! The flow of the restaurant is also poor. Most people queue up outside, because there is very little line space inside. The exit is also through the same door, so there is quite a bottleneck most of the time, even if the restaurant isn't that busy. We were one of the first to arrive after they opened, and we waited outside for about 15 minutes before we were able to place our orders. Once we got our food, about half of the tables were empty.The fried toppings are the same as in Japan, but I seem to recall there being more variety in Japan, than just the fried stuff. The edamame salsa is not on the menu in Japan, and just looked weird to me. I did not try it. And maybe it was just the day that I was there, but the self serve areas seemed sloppier than what I was used to seeing in Japan. Sauces spilled, napkins strewn about, floor was sticky in places.", "author": "\u548c\u5b50"}

Sure, if your lunch lady/seat police constantly hover around, apologetically reminding you to bus your dishes in the back. None of the floor staff knew how to manage a family with a stroller. With no place to stand (I wasn't rolling the stroller in the cafeteria line with hot soup!) and their \"strict\" no seat-saving policy, I just don't see how this place can call themselves kid-friendly. We were shamed by floor staff into thinking we were in the way. They gave us few options to park our stroller. Then they said we couldn't save seats (we were standing by the stroller) until we paid for our food. Uh. How do you expect three adults and two children to safely obtain this food you speak of?! Yeah - send one adult, the rest hang back. You know what's funny: there was another family of five behind us in line who got no static from the seat police when they placed utensils and napkins on a table - I guess the universal sign for \"seat's taken\". I overheard one of the seat police speaking to them in their mutual language (not English) and couldn't help but feel his cultural bias.\n\nLots of kinks to work out.

It does add up so be careful. But the price is pretty reasonable.

The line gets broken up into two parts (to avoid obstruction of public foot traffic) so be sure you're in the correct part of the line. As you slowly make your way inside, you'll find yourself in a cafeteria style line where you grab a tray, a side dish plate and keep moving along the counter. Think of which udon # you want, size, cold or hot before you get to the staff cause you'll sound like an old udon patron who knows exactly what he/she's doing (#savvypoints). You can see the udon gets pumped out from the machine behind them, it gets cooked and tossed into cold water by hand and placed into the bowl. They then add the broth and whatever else you ordered into the bowl and move on. After you grab your bowl, you'll see an array of optional tempura side dishes which will cost an additional $ per piece.\n\nI ordered #2 Nikutama, the beef was really flavorful and the broth was tasteful and light.

There's plenty of actual FRESH HANDMADE udon around the bay area and it doesn't fall short in comparison to Marugame. So like I said, if you don't want to brave the cold for the wait, there's many other options for a great bowl of udon. But if you'd like to feed your instagram with the latest foodie hype, then this is the spot to check out.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

I got number 2) the udon with beef, and it was good, but I think if you do happen to come here, I'd go for the cheap $5 plain udon because the udon really is delicious.\n\nThe toppings bar where you can self serve chives and tempura is amazing. I love the tempura, and I'd definitely recommend treating yourself to as much as you can.\n\nSo in conclusion, I personally would love to come here as much as I can, but the wait is definitely an issue.

There was a limited menu, which I wish I knew - it sounded like they were unveiling a new dish every few weeks to make it interesting rather than perfecting said dish. I really wanted a soft poached egg in my beef udon, but no no - that will be unveiled in a week. How annoying. Other than that, the prices are much higher than the one in Hawaii without having the same quality. That in my book is already minus so many stars, but whatever. I ordered their beef udon, regular and added 1 piece of fried chicken, 1 piece of fish cake, 1 piece of shrimp tempura. Don't forget to get tempura bits and chili flakes at their sauce bar!! \n\nTo be honest, the only reason why I gave this three stars is because the noodle portion is pretty generous. The noodles are pretty filling and perfectly cooked. However, I was also sad how their fried chicken is DEFINITELY not the same as their Hawaii's location. The breading was very light and had zero flavor. The pieces were really small and thus very dry. If you have been to their Hawaii location, you will know that the only thing to get there is their fried chicken because it's so plump and juicy and drips of juiciness.. (omg salivating as I'm writing this). Anyway, this is not the same. Don't get it. The only addition that's worth getting is their fried fish cake! It's HUGE - definitely enough as the only protein needed for the entire meal (also note I am a petite asian girl that doesn't eat much - if you're a large dude X2). I would go back for some fried fish cake and beef udon + poached egg. Hopefully they learned how to perfect their soups by now!", "author": "Anh Thu P."}

I got the Kama age udon, a sweet potato tempura, and the shredded veggie one. My friend got the spicy chicken, shrimp tempura and the calamari tempura. The Kama age udon was definitely the best thing I ate. The noddles are a great texture and really tasty. The sauce that came with the Kama age was prefect. I wasn't crazy about the broth for the spicy chicken udon. I thought it was too acidic and lacked depth. The tempura were all about rubbery and oily. The sweet potato one was the bear and the others I wouldn't get again.  \nThere is a fair amount of seating and the space is pretty big. The staff is super nice and helpful. \nI would give it three stars, but I give it four now because I would go back again. I'm a bit fan of noddles and I thought the undo itself was great.

I've had the cold nikutama udon and the hot kakitama udon here; I prefer the cold udon to the hot, as I find that the chewy texture of the udon is far better. My hot udon noodles were a little overcooked, and when I went with my BF he had a similar complaint. The beef is on the sweet side - it didn't bother me too much, but may not be to others' tastes. The mixed vegetable tempura and chicken tempura were good, but the sweet potato was disappointing - the slice of potato was super thin. Flavor-wise in general, though, I have no real complaints.\n\nThe line can seem long, but it does move relatively quickly. If you like udon, you'll probably like this place.

I ordered the #9 Edamame Salsa Udon. Overall, I really liked the option I ordered. It had a great amount of flavor and the udon was on point. I also got a salmon musubi which was just okay. I will stick to getting only tempura next time. All in all this is a great place with inexpensive udon and many options for sides. It is worth the wait!", "author": "Joe A."}

It's so crazy, maybe like an hour and 15mins wait. Mmm... delicious fresh udon!!! I got myself the number 10 egg drop udon, flavors was fantastic and the udon was so good! I also got a salmon masubi (the salmon was kind of skimp they make it look like every bite you will have some salmon pieces but no, they piled it on the top of the triangle to visionary that it looks a lot but really it's not, but besides it just being skimpy with the salmon the masubi was delicious!!!

It was verrrrrrry salty and the broth felt almost like a reduction. Noodles were nice enough, liked that we could put our own toppings on and I piled cilantro and onions in particular. The tempura was light overall and they had a good system to get me the items that had not been made when I went by with my tray. I added shrimp, asparagus and kakiyage and it was too much for me, grease wise. Tempura sauce was gross imho, salty and fake tasting. Staff was super nice and working so hard. Glad they serve in ceramic bowls and wish we got ceramic spoons too.\n\nI eat udon in Japantown regularly and this was nothing better than anything I've had there. I will try it again and eat here when I am at Stonestown once a year or so but I didn't find it anything special, unfortunately. I did not finish my food and it felt like a lead weight in my stomach. Will try a different offering next time.", "author": "Sally R."}

As it was the soft opening still, there were a few dishes that were still unavailable, so we both decided on the beef udon.  Portions were huge and they had an assortment of tempura and masubi to choose from.  We tried the squid, chicken, shrimp, and zucchini tempera along with a salmon masubi.  \n\nThe udon soup base was very flavorful and had a rich taste to it that blended well with everything else.  The noodles were perfect, but the beef was a little too sweet, but thats personal preference.  I had the large bowl and the portions were huge.  I was barely able to finish and I worked up an appetite waiting in line so long.  As for the tempera, the shrimp and chicken were tasty while the others were just ok.  \n\nOverall, it was a cool experience, being able to watch as the cooks made the udon for you fresh while waiting in line.  Definitely quality udon and probably some of the best I've tasted.  Sucks that the wait is so long but I guess thats to be expected, seeing as this is a new spot and everyone wants to try it.

Anyway I went there today (day after Christmas) with my 3 sibs and 2 nieces.  The concept of fresh udon in a cafeteria style line is great - but why did I wait for 45 minutes? haha!  Yes, definitely be prepared to wait. Glad it was a soft opening because if it was a full menu I'd think the wait would be much, much longer.   \n\nOn to the food...\n\nThe noodles are amazingly fresh, the broth is a bit too salty for my taste but it was good.  I put fresh ginger (yuuum), green onions and lots of tempura bits.  Broth soaked tempura bites make this soup all the better. We all shared tempura and different types of musubi, all really great!  \n\nOne less star because we took 2 soups to go and by the end of our meal it was leaking through the container onto the meal tray.  They were kind enough to replace the broth and double the container.  We were smart to bag it separately and tie it up because by the time we got home after an hour trip to the mall after lunch....half the broth was in the bag (eek!).  Hope they can fix this issue for future to-go orders!\n\nI will return when they have their full menu because I can't wait to have a soft boiled egg in my udon, yum!!!", "author": "Mary-Anne C."}

The wait was about 45 mins but it was so worth it. They prepare your udon infront of you & you take it to your table. When you're done you take the trays back up (cafeteria style) so they can wash the bowls etc. It was so warm and delicious, specially during a cold night, and I now understand why people are willing to stand in line for an hour just for a bowl of udon from this particular place.

We get there and the line is WAY out of the door, but it moved pretty quick considering how fast the employees were working.\n\nThe inside was neat and clean, even though customers had to clean up their own dishes. I really liked their Japanese layout and design. It was a shame that they were out of eggs at the time I was there, so I decided to go with the Curry Udon. I thought it was really interesting how there was a section where you could choose all of your add ons yourself after you get your udon. There were add ons like fried tempura, zucchini, chicken, etc. There's also an unlimited topping bar near the back!\n\nFinally onto the udon. The curry udon I had was one of the BEST udon I have ever had here in the Bay Area. Not only was it fragrant, it tasted even better than it smelled. I was extremely satisfied with the appearance and flavor of my meal. The curry was not overpowering like many others, I thought that it was just right. Marugame has reasonable prices for their udon so there is no way you can go wrong coming to this establishment.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this place, I am sure if you are an udon lover you will not be disappointed.

My go-to is usually the Kake Udon, a regular on days where I don't want to be overly stuffed, and a large if it's going to be the last meal of my day. Super simple and inexpensive. \nTheir Tonkotsu Udon is good, but not worth the price at all, as it comes with the smallest, skimpiest slices of pork, but if you're craving a rich broth, this is the way to go. The chili oil in the broth is pretty mild and not spicy at all.\nThe Kama-age Udon is a struggleeeeeee to eat and so time consuming, you gotta move the long noodles from the bowl of water into your dipping bowl (which is super small and makes it kind of annoying), and then into your mouth, and it's just so much harder than shoving food directly from a bowl into your mouth. But get this if you're going here for an aesthetic picture for the gram, the snap, or other social media. \nTempura-wise, I only care for the potato croquette.

I slurped down noodles so fast I lost my vision, but this only enhanced my eating experience.

I ordered the Nikutama Udon and it was quite enjoyable. All the food here is pretty affordable and for the price you're paying it's good quality food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-08", "description": "Marugame Udon is definitely a great addition to the Stonestown shopping mall. I waited a couple of weeks until the hyped died down because the lines were sooooo long. I've been here a couple of times now, and only have good things to say about it. \n\nThe restaurant is cafeteria style so as you go in, you grab a tray, and make your way down the line. They make the udon noodles fresh and you get to see them do that as you are in line. You let the worker know which noodle soup you would like and they put the noodles in the bowl, add the broth/toppings and place it on the tray for you - so getting your udon bowl is pretty quick once you order. I've tried both the beef udon and the spicy chicken udon. They give you a pretty good amount of meat on both the bowls and the flavor of the broths were delicious. The udon noodles tasted fresh, and were so soft and had the perfect consistency to them. \nAfter you get your udon bowl, you get to the tempura section of the line. They fry the tempura fresh as well, so the tempura are all warm and crispy! Some tempura options include: shrimp, squid, sweet potato, fish, etc. The only con I have about the tempura is the price. It's a little pricey for one piece of tempura- for example, the potato croquette is $2.. which seems a little steep for a palm size piece of fried potato. \nAt the end of the cafeteria line, you'll be able to check out with the cashier so the payment process is easy - especially if you go with a group of people, everyone can pay individually rather than having a bill. You make your way over to their topping bar and you can add tempura flakes, green onions, and scallion to your bowl. I recommend adding all three to add a little bit of crunch and freshness! The place has plenty of seating so finding seat was pretty easy all the times I've went. All the workers there are super friendly too. \n\nAll in all, I would 100% recommend going here if you haven't tried it! I found that going before 5pm beats the line so the longest you'd wait is 20 minutes.", "author": "Lina T."}

I ordered #2 and it was a good. I thought i was gan have more soupy but guess not. Maybe will come back again someday!

It has a hint of sweetness that went so well with the rich umami flavor of the kake sauce. I got the Kama-age udon. It was a huge portion, and at first I thought I needed more Kake sauce, but I didn't realize how flavorful it was! They have a topping bar on the side with extra tempura pieces, green onions, and sesame seeds to add onto your udon. I also tried the Curry Udon, it was really flavorful too! Not like the package curry you buy in asian grocery stores. The udon went perfectly with the curry broth, but it felt a little too dense. We also got the veggie tempura, but it wasn't as crunchy as I liked, which was disappointing. So overall: definitely go for the udon soups and maybe skip on the tempura.

The Time was 15 passed eight , for the first time there wasn't a line it was a  third of it normal size . Normally it looks as as if there was a world famine and there was only on restaurant in town that sells food . But all I have to say it's that it was crazy , like Great Wall of china crazy . Just to say the company started in Japan and their noddle is special because it the only in the world that has a diamond cut . Which makes it evermore delicious. Aaccording to the host I spoke too.At the time I am one person away from the door my mouth is think of the lean Japanese style grilled chicken with bases of spicy chilly style broth and can't forget the diamond cut noddle .  8:32. If you don't want to wait for noddle I would recommend coming on a Tuesday night . I am writing this still in lines ahhh . Just entered theres a  fishing net sit over a pot with running water will. Has noddle cooking facing the streetview has you first walk in. In my head I feeling the warm fuzzy feeling .The employred are wearing English style train conduct caps accompanied by peach cream half aprons all tied together with half sleeve chef coat . They dress real western but it a Japanese company interest? . Just me being curious  but let me tell you it looks dope . I almost thought about asking if they were hire but because the work outfit looks lit . Yeah it lit .  Still in line chewing my gum imagining the taste of the ramen . The noddle is now bedding in rectangular basins the noddle is watch In two different temperatures hot first than cold  then final n hot . Than served in an Asian style bowl  I ordered  number six  .  The guy asked me large or regular . I looked at him o he knew what it was . Just tried it and it nothing special to be honest i would rather wait in line At the dmv than wait for this half ass insta ramen bull shit story \"we make fresh noddle from scratch\" . Yeah your  right, you make it from scratch but why does it taste like insta ramen   that probably the most exciting thing about the whole wave . First off the broth was so under seasoned  you might aswell serve me green in sweet and low . I would prefer to drink that shit and to drink that half ass chicken pour ramen bull shit that I have to wait 2 hour in line for . Thanks but no thanks I will run my ass to the grocery store and for that eleven dollars that I spent on the bowl would probably buy me instant ramen for a month .  That sounds like a better financial invest to my stomach and pocket than that bull shit y'all are serving people . No yeah I forgot I having secon thought on that job interest . Y'all can keep it .

The meat a little over cooked for my taste and the poached egg was pretty good. All in all, it was good, but it wasn't \"super good.\" I've definitely had better udons.

Thursday at 3pm, the wait was still about half an hour. You wait in line to get the food and then get seats after. It's cool to see the machine make the noodles then goes into hot water to cook and get rinsed before being served to you. I got the beef udon plus egg and honestly.... The broth was no different than buying the bottled soba sauce concentrate and then diluting it out yourself. I would dare say the udon itself is very good and consistently round/slurpable. But... I can't tell much difference between this and a frozen udon pack. The beef was very fatty and stringy, kind of reminded me of the beef bowl they serve at Yoshinoya. I got a tempura shrimp (crunchy good), and fried battered fish (crunchy and very good), and a fried fish cake (not good and it absorbed a lot of the frying oil). I also got a mentai rice ball and it was just super fishy and not good. The rice was HOT so the mayo filling melted and the seaweed wilted. Overall, the place is not bad and price is ok but...

In the cafeteria format, where you'd first grab a tray, order your basic noodles-in-a-bowl, then pile all the sides you want yourself, it's an unadulterated, very authentic experience.\n\nThe wheat noodles (no gluten-free option!) are made on the premise. They are pre-cooked, then reheated upon ordering, just the way it is done back in Japan. It has the right level of firmness, or \"koshi\": neither rubbery or mushy. You liberal commies ;) should stay home, because there isn't, shouldn't be, and won't be a vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free options for you snowflakes. You are less special than this gem, even if it's run by a gigantic corporation in Japan with over 1000 restaurants. They run a carefully designed formula that's been tested over many years.\n\nThere are a few gripes, though. The food quality is equal to that back in Japan. After all, this is fast food. The broth is ok, but a little too salty and too dark. The quality of bonito flakes is ok, but not superb. The green onions you can pile on your noodles aren't cut as thinly as they should be. There should be grated ginger instead of blasphemous Sriracha. The noodles and broth should be served hotter, too.\n\nBut again, you can get a bowl of authentic noodles for as little as $5. Sure, it costs about the double of what it costs in Japan, but other Japanese noodle joints in the Bay Area cost twice as much again.

The only one I loved loved was the shrimp, perfect decadent piece of tempura. I grabbed what I thought was a big piece of chicken, but the cashier told me to get another as well to make it worth the price. How nice!

Just from what I remember, I know that Hawaii's location doesn't have the mentai option and I believe the edamame salsa? I personally went with #2, the Nikutama, but I wish I got the mentai. As for the tempura and onigiri, there was a good variety so I'd say it's almost the same just from the top of my head. I got shrimp tempura, zucchini, and the mentai mayo onigiri which was soooooooo good and the reason why I wish I got the mentai udon.

My trashy ex roommate swore that this place was a good sushi place. But nonetheless I wasn't expecting this place to be as nice as it turned out to be. Awesome experience. After getting through the line that extends out of the storefront your greeted with an amazing smell of fresh noodles being prepared in front of you. I knew as soon as I saw this I was in good hands. They have a wide variety of soup options udon or ramen based with an unon noodle. I got the #5 and was so satisfied with it. I will forsure be back on a regular basis and can't wait to try all of the numbers plus some. They have some side options you can pick for yourself before you get the the cashier for checkout. 6 stars if that is an option! Yum!!!", "author": "Tofu S."}

It was ok but she said it so loudly and everyone started looking at us. I was so embarrassed and I just said whatever just ring me up so I could get out of this line. If I was her I would have said let me ask my manager about this. Then she told me you could use the coupon twice because your only one. I don't think so .

I've always been stirred away at the sight of the line, but one day my bf and I stuck it out and just waited. It wasn't that long, the line moved pretty fast for what it was. We probably waited about 20 minutes. It was a bit chilly, but it was worth it! Inside, you order your choice of udon, and then add your choice of tempura, pay, and then pick a seat. Seating can be tricky, but we were able to find a seat inside. I'd suggest bringing a jacket in case it fills up inside, there's outdoor seating too. Overall the food was super yummy!

The tempura were way too oily also the onigiris were almost empty of what they were supose to be filled with.

You can think of it as a foodcourt staple similar to Panda Express in America... not that I'm saying there's something bad about the food, but that it's a very common offering and nothing too special about it. But this location is so swamped that the wait is long and the line moves slow, so by the time you actually sit down to eat your noodles they've already become soggy and your tempura luke warm.\n\nHopefully the hype dies down a bit, so the wait is not as long and the food can be enjoyed the way it should be.

Marugame Udon has a couple of locations, which in my experience had a variety of waiting times.  The Los Angeles one there was no line, the Hawaii one had a long, but shorter line, and for this location, since it is at a mall this was the longest line for Marugame Udon I've ever seen.  Of course, I've stood in the line though because this is five star udon.  \n\nI always get the regular Nikutama Udon. It's simple, flavorful and delicious plus the size is pretty generous especially for the price.  The Nikutama Udon order will come with the broth, noodles, meat and the egg.  You can add green onions and tempura toppings at the end, and man do I add that up.  I can never get the right balance of toppings, but one day.  \n\nOtherwise, you can also get tempura and onigiris at the end, but be careful, because that's how you rack up the bill and since the size of the regular is already pretty generous it might be difficult to finish all of the tempura you pick up.  What'll happen is that you'll spend money on food you won't even finish and at least for me, tempura is gross as a cold leftover.  So be careful what you pick up at the end!  That's where they get you, especially because you've been waiting in line for so long haha.  \n\nFor me, five stars since I fervently love Marugame's udon with its generous portion size and affordable prices.  But!  Be warned, the line is long and be careful not to pick up too much tempura/onigiris once you get to the end.", "author": "Cristina C."}

I think similar in the idea of set up maybe more so. Came before it opened at 11 around 10:45 on a Saturday. Was able to find parking okay in the mall parking lot. A lot of people were waiting already for it to open. Went to the front of the store area and the lady there said the line was over in the middle of the sidewalk closer to Olive Garden by some trees. It reminded me of going to Disneyland and going through lines and zig zagging till you got to the front for the ride. So we waited at the end of the second line and it took us 45 minutes to finish the first line. Took us 36 minutes to finish the second line to just get into the door but still in line. Had to wait a while because they ran out of beef for our udon. Ordered the large beef udon. They put 2 servings of noodles into it. The broth though they didn't put enough in husband's and mine was okay. He tried the fried chicken and I had the shrimp tempura. Think it takes them a while to serve the food while in line that there's usually seats open already. Didn't like the short back chairs because people kept bumping into me and I felt like I was going to fall off. I like that they had a condiment station for the onions, krispies, and sauces as well as utensils. Water cups by the soda dispenser. Next to that is where you bus your trays to. The noodles were tasty. Beef was a good amount, a little on the chewy side. Not as sweet or soft as Hawaii Marukame. The chicken and shrimp were tasty. Would definitely come here again! A lot closer than Hawaii  If you want good freshly made udon, it's a good place to check out but have patience to wait in line.", "author": "Helena C."}

It strongly reminds me of the restaurant in Oahu called Marukame. It works like a Chipotle style-ish place, where you choose your base noodle dish and then add on any tempura / masubi at the end. They even had a helpful board to show people how it works near the door. I chose the beef udon and it was a light kake broth to balance out the soft but carby noodles. The meat was tender and very thin, but good flavor. I tried my friends curry udon and it's a tiny bit spicy with a much heavier broth, but not overpowering. I'd choose the curry over the beef if I was more hungry but I wanted something less heavy. Masubi didn't have much filling and more rice: filling ratio. I'd skip it next time. Tempura has a flaky coating and I tried the vegetable one, which has a lot of onion. I don't think I'd get that one again since it's kind of big and I was stuffed silly, but it was tasty. The staff was super attentive at the soft opening and turnover with the tables was quick so staying in line was fairly fast in comparison to ramen places.

Place recently opened, so there can be quite a long line for dinner. Went around 4:30pm on a Tuesday. Line wasn't too long. Line kind of moves at a snails pace because you order your udon bowl, the guy boils the udon and adds the soup and other items, then you proceed to the side dishes area (pick what you want) and then pay at the register. I got the beef udon, a couple pieces of shrimp tempura and a salmon rice triangle. There is indoor and outdoor seating. When I went, there was plenty of seating available.

The curry udon was spot on, good flavor and not too thick. There was a decent amount of beef in the curry to add texture and flavor.

It's like a rice ball with one slice of seaweed. Rice definitely over powers everything. Just dip it in soy sauce for your flavor.... or dump it into your udon", "author": "Donna L."}

It is just not the same.  I will say the employees are the best thing about it.  Very welcoming as soon as I walked through the door.  The first person explained how it was the soft opening so the menu was limited.  The second person told me all about the concept and how to do the ordering by picking the type of udon you wanted and moving  down the line to pick the tempura and musubis you wanted.  I didn't want to interrupt her by saying I've been to the Honolulu site many, many times.  She was doing such a good job at explaining.  The floor manager that first night was very attentive by clearing tables, finding people seats and clearing your tray for you.\nThe food is a different story.  I will say the udon was al dente but the broth was just warm.  The tempura was cold.  What an oily disappointment. I think it sat out too long because there wasn't much turnover in customers yet, even though I came around 6:45. Or was it leftover from lunch? I will say the potato coquettes were very good.  I always like a good coquette.   The condiment cart was well stocked but the tempura pieces were not crispy and another greasy mess.  \nI think I'll stick to the Murakame Udon in Hawaii.

Unfortunately, I do not like sweet meat in my bowl of noodles, which is why one star is docked. \nWe went on a night where it was pretty blustery and light drizzle and the line was getting out the door. One of the staff advised all the customers in line that due to fire code, the line would have to be moved outside....in the rain...in the cold.... I thought they should've been better prepared and not kick people outside, but I understand it's for safety reasons, but still the way he announced it was off putting.\nThe interior itself is like a cafeteria, you order your noodles and sides and sit down at any open space.

But I don't like the fact that one person can be in line, then at the last minute, friends and family join him/her. \nWhile waiting in line, I can watch the employees make the noodles in the front of the shop. Then it's time to order. Choose the size, and type of meat and broth. Since I love the assorted tempura, I always go for the clear broth, but I have tried the beef and also the curry. There are plenty of staff working, so the tempura is always hot. And after paying, there is a self help station to add toppings like scallions, cilantro, ginger... The main reason I love this place is the udon is the perfect consistency of chewiness, and the broth perfectly seasoned. I have been to the one in Hawaii, and it tastes as good! \nEven though it is always busy, there will be a seat available when i get my bowl of udon.

We ordered the spicy chicken udon and the curry udon. The broth in the spicy chicken udon had too much lime added to it which made it really sour. The curry was ok, but not spectacular in flavor. The texture of the udon had a good bite to it , which makes this Marugame promising after a few more months of being open. I feel that with practice and experience, the food will be just as good as the one in Hawaii. We also ordered a bunch of tempura- chicken, shrimp, vegetable ball, etc. But it was also disappointing because the chicken was overly battered and the other tempura pieces were limp, not crispy, and overly oily. The lines were long when we got there around 5:15, but like all good places, you just have to wait. But after going through the whole experience of ordering food, waiting, paying, and getting a table, I feel the biggest problem is the efficiency of the staff.

He liked the noodles, but expected more meat in the curry like the picture.  He got tiny bits and pieces of meat.  I guess I expected what I got though after eating it, I think I would have preferred a clear broth instead.  My daughter basically had plain noodles in water with dipping sauce.  She was fine with that and ate it up!  And she usually doesn't eat that much, so that was good for her.  Now after eating there, I was very thirsty a few hours later.  Too much MSG used in the sauce?  I didn't eat anything else that was salty that day, so maybe too much sodium in something.  With the long lines, we're not sure if we'll be back anytime soon.
