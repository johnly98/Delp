The menu is brief but had enough variety to find something you would enjoy. We were staying in the hotel so we enjoyed both dinner and breakfast at this restaurant . The restaurant staff were all very friendly. We had plans in the evening and service was quick , breakfast was leisurely and we were not rushed. The menu is pricey but the portions are big. The food was great. My favorite was the Brussels sprouts appetizer. After an evening out , I passed by the restaurant going back to room and the waitress remembered my name and wished me a pleasant evening , nice touch!!", "author": "Michelle D."}

Everything from the sexy JW Marriott hotel, to the friendly staff members, oh-let's not forget about the sexy chandeliers once you step out the 3rd floor! Whoo! At least come here to check out the d\u00e9cor and ambiance-you will be just as amazed as I was! \n\nLevel III is located in beautiful San Francisco's Union Square-JW Marriott hotel. The restaurant is a little pricey then the norm, but it's because you are paying for the location (nothing in D/T Union Square is cheap!). \n\nThe bar area is a great place to sit and relax (chat with the bartenders). They also have seating areas in the restaurant and areas to sit around the restaurant that consist of outlets to charge your electronics (sweet)! Some friends and I decided to get together here to enjoy a couple drinks and I was shocked at how cute this place was! The hotel itself is gorgeous and impressive, but the bar is a MUST! \n\nI hear there burgers here are delicious, wait-lemme not forget about their well-known Mac and Cheese!! I'm still wondering why I didn't order that dish! However, I ordered the Truffle Fries and dived right into a Lemon Drop and they both did not disappoint. I appreciated that the menu was short and simple, but at the same time offered a little bit of everything you want. \nHappy hour!! Don't we all love happy hour deals? Well, Level III has half price off their 3 signature cocktails, red and white wine. Hours are from 4PM-7PM Monday-Friday! \n\nDid I mention they have a wonder wine list! Yess, honey! The wine itself is enough for me to keep coming back. During the weekends, they offer a wonderful l JW Buffet which consists of a lovely health y breakfast and a create-your-own omelet from 6:30AM-11AM. Lunch and Dinner is served from 11AM-11PM.", "author": "Porsche C."}

We were looking for a restaurant to have for lunch during Dine About Town and I decided to go with Level III since I was really impressed with their food when they held a Yelp Elite Event there a few weeks earlier.\n\nWe were so excited because we read on their DAT menu that they would have Ribeye Steak there for $17.95.  BUT, when the waiter came to take our order, the first thing he tells us is that \"We don't have Ribeye, only NY Steak.  It's Better.  You'll like it.\"  They pulled the old 'Bait and Switch' tactic on us!!!  So yeah, we settled for the NY Steak since the waiter claims \"It's Better\" than Ribeye.  Uh huh, yeah sure.\n\n1st course - Endive Salad\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qxQ2OSOZgruD0q2QI2WeKA?select=kZJ0nMT9rjS2gYS3rVmLrw)\nWhile it looks pretty, I didn't really care too much for this salad.  Probably because I was still feeling bitter that they didn't have any Ribeye.\n\nMain Course - Ribeye....Oops, I meant NY Steak and Garlic Fries\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qxQ2OSOZgruD0q2QI2WeKA?select=e9K3qyq8oJB0ozHv4snIFQ)\nThe NY Steak wasn't too bad.  It was cooked fine and medium rare as I requested.  But it definitely wasn't \"Better\" than a Ribeye steak.  And the Garlic Fries were just okay.\n\nThe real kicker was what happened with Hannah C.'s order.  We both ordered our steaks medium rare, yet when they brought them out, mine was fine, but her's was well done to a crisp.  How the cook messed that up is a mystery.  When we told the waiter about it, he said that the \"order confused the cook\" which is didn't make sense since we both ordered our steaks medium rare.  Well, eventually they fired up another steak for Hannah and it was medium rare.\n\nTo shed some light, despite all the mishaps, we kind of found this dining experience to be indirectly entertaining.  We probably won't dine here again for DAT.  If you do consider going here for Dine About Town, take extreme caution as you'll probably get something different than what's advertised.", "author": "Rodney H."}

Also the higher up a dining room's altitude, the higher the prices get.\n\nAs of late, I've ended up at Marriott hotels and it's partner company Ritz Carlton, eating at their restaurants/lounges.  And I'm realizing these hotels have a really nice chic atmosphere, good food, service, and comparatively reasonable prices.  \n\nArriving on the third floor via Marriott's cool elevators, I loved how the bar area looked.   Contemporary all white upholstered benches, stools, tables laid out nice for chillaxin, and comfortable booth areas overlooking the City.\n\nThe menu looked great with entrees like filet mignon, oysters, sliders, sea bass, and Mac & Cheese.  I ordered a couple beers at the bar and socialized with my friends.\n\nSince I came during a Yelp event I was able to sample a few items from the menu:\n\nKobe Beef Sliders:  very tasty, cooked to medium, with fresh toasted slider buns.  No better social finger food than sliders except maybe buffalo wings..\n\nMac & Cheese:  it was ok, it's hard with all the competition out there making this cherished comfort food.\n\nI also had good desserts and of course the cause and solution to all of mankind's problems: alcohol.\n\nSo in my Level 3 voice...

When it came time to order, the waiter said no ribeye but there's NY steak and \"New York steak is better than ribeye\".  Are you for real???  **This just cracked us up.   \n\nDisappointed and caught off guard, a friend took an extra minute to decide on the order.  During this time, the waiter impatiently said \"There really aren't many choices on the menu to decide.  Either one or the other\".  MMMM ATTITUDE!!!\n\nSo let's talk food.  Among the 3 of us, we were able to sample all choices from the menu:  seafood chowder, endive watercress salad, pan roasted chicken breast, and the infamous \"better-than-ribeye\" NY steak. \n\nThe endive salad with julienne fuji apple, candied walnuts, and blue cheese was refreshing (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qxQ2OSOZgruD0q2QI2WeKA?select=F__a4h37qLFJobBlX5rMcw). \n\nThe seafood chowders with clams, scallops, and crab meat also had chunks of potatoes and carrots.  It was creamy and pretty good.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qxQ2OSOZgruD0q2QI2WeKA?select=g2vak9m0xNU9Wml3BPtsoQ).  \n\nThe chicken breast with maitake mushroom & roasted tomato risotto.

Two of us ordered medium rare steaks but I happened to be the unlucky person to send back the well done steak and wilted fries.  When I told the waiter, he accused my friend for having mistakenly eaten my steak.  He also came back to tell me that the chef was confused if I wanted my steak more or less cooked. Haha really?  Can we say confusion!!!  He did return later with a medium rare steak.  The fries were definitely better when they were crispy.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qxQ2OSOZgruD0q2QI2WeKA?select=9sub3qrAT_w7r-ueS-1_iQ)\n\nOur waiter was pretty clueless.  He never stop by to check if we needed anything.  Keep in mind the restaurant wasn't busy. He also didn't know how to split the bill on 2 separate credit cards and that we would have to wait for him to figure it out.

What a mistake. We should have ordered a pizza. Let me paint you a picture. This is in real time. I am sitting here with my team. The server is trying his best. He really is. None of this is his fault. He is friendly enough. But he is all by himself. Marooned in the lies of yelp reviews provided by the mechanical turk. My colleague, Ryan, just got his arugula salad. It looks very tired. At least we got our drinks, which were steeped for 15 minutes in benign neglect. My diet coke reminds me of the seldom cleaned soda gun I wielded circa 1989 in a rural Vermont bowling alley.  The ambience is 100% Marriott. That's where Level 3 is located. We are in a hotel. The rug. The tables. The lighting. The music. I am celebrating my team mate's professional achievements in a hotel lobby. Oh. Here is our food! (45 minutes later with an empty restaurant).\n\nMy french fries are a little soggy. My burger is \"fine\" but it costs $16.00.\n\nI am sorry Rob.

After all- there are tons of other places where i can eat. But during my recent trip to the Bay area- Level III was a logical choice for a couple of eating occasions. \n\nIf you go- go for the heirloom tomato salad. Three to four kinds of tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella and garlic toast crumbles all drizzled with balsamic dressing make for a great first start to your meal. This is my favorite of all the items I tried. \n\nI also had the NY strip (okay but coming from Chicago I guess I expected so much more). It was thin, well prepared but a bit tasteless and I found the mashed potato and pea combination a little odd. \n\nAt another visit I had the tuna poke, that while very artfully arranged, was a bit tasteless. It needed more soy sauce and Wahhabi or anything that would give it some flavor. \n\nThe atmosphere is trendy, the service spot on but know that Level III has fine dining prices. Dinner with drinks ran almost $70 a person which felt steep for a hotel restaurant, although I get they don't want to be considered a \"hotel restaurant\". They do have a prixe fixe special of a starter, entree and dessert which probably would be the better deal than ordering a la carte. \n\nLevel III has good food, served by friendly people. I guess I'd just prefer if I am paying those kind of prices to be at some trendy place across town!", "author": "Carol K."}

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place to get together with a couple girlfriends, a couple cocktails and a good time flirting with waiters if that floats your boat. The restaurant is off by the windows and because of the wonderful way it was decorated, you could hardly tell you were in the lobby just inches from the lobby bar. \n\nI have to say these five stars go to the black truffle mac n cheese. Oh my goodness, the mac and cheese is unlike anything else I've ever had before! There's something special about having black truffles in each and every bite of mac and cheese. The appetizer is served in a cast iron pan thus ensuring each bite is rich and hot 45 minutes into dinner. I have dreams-no nightmares about how good that pasta is. I hate the chef who thought up this dish 'cause he's ruined me for Southern Comfort food now. \n\nOkay, so besides that, we also had:\n\nChicken sticks: This is basically Thai satay chicken right down to the skewers and peanut sauce.\n\nFlight of Kobe Beef, Crabcake Sandwich, and Pulled Pork Sandwich: Honestly, I was too stuffed from the appetizer to really dig into it too much but the presentation was beautiful and the gherkin pickles they found to adorn the tops of each burger made it that much more delightful.\n\nFlatbread Pizza: This is a classic Italian style pizza with just the right balance with fresh arugula and tomatoes. I love how the arugula gives the pizza a kick that put it over the top. \n\nSo I'll come back to this place one day when I lose the 10 lbs. I gained from inhaling all that mac and cheese. I'll see it in my dreams tonight probably...damn it.", "author": "Jessica K."}

Level III has a great deal called the Prixe Fix Menu.  It is $39 and includes your choice of one appetizer, one entree, and a dessert.  Considering the prices of the entrees this is a really good deal.  I had the scallops, the portobello ravioli, and the Apple Grunt.  The scallop starter was exquisite.  I don't know what was in it but trust me when I saw it was delicious.  The ravioli was good, but I felt it was too much...as in the sauce was a little overpowering, the portobello raviolis were delish though.  If a delicious cheesecake and a scrumptious apple pie made sweet love their baby would be the Apple Grunt dessert.  It was decadent.  I also had a few bites of the filet mignon, man it was so good.\n\nThe ambiance was really nice, as the restaurant just flows from the lobby area.  Our table remarked that it could have been a little more dim to set a better mood.  The service was great, they came by often to refill our drinks and check on us.  Unfortunately the kitchen didn't follow suit.  The food took a really long time to get out there.  It took a good while before we got our first appetizer, and then it seemed like we were waiting awhile for our entrees.  That aside the food really made up for this.", "author": "Joel S."}

We were a group of six and ended up being there for Dine about Town which can be a hit or miss.\n\nThey had two options for first and third course and we tried everything. \n\nThe first course was either a greens salad of a cauliflower soup. The soup was the most creative dish of the night and had a complex flavour and wasn't too creamy or heavy.\n\nThe green salad was ok but forgettable.\n\nThe entrees were all excellent. Two of us got the filet mignon which is one of my favorite cuts. I had mine medium rare and the other person had their medium well and both of our meat was cooked to order and tasted great.\n\nThe fish dish was an arctic char that was prepared well and had nice accompaniments.\n\nThe vegetarian entree was a butternut squash tortellini which probably was the most complex and interesting entree and was a dish we all agreed we would have again. It had a nice spiced almost floral sauce.\n\nWe ended with the dessert which was old fashioned chocolate cake and cheese course. The cake was super moist and creamy. The cheese was decent but the dried fruit served with it was rather anemic and should have just be left off.\n\nThose of us that drink were unimpressed with the wine list.

DAT is to showcase what a restaurant does creatively and get you to come back. While there was nothing technically wrong with the dishes' execution - NY Strip came out medium-rare, as requested, veggies were flavorful, etc. - there wasn't anything outstanding. You put mac and cheese with steak on a DAT menu? Salmon on a bed of spinach? Solid, but really lacking in the creativity department here.\n\nThe one outstanding thing was the service, but not in a good way. Level III was dead empty on a Saturday night, with one server running the show for the entire place. Spoons for soup were forgotten, and the server seemed to disappear completely between courses. We actually had to get up and search for her when it came time to settle the check, since we were left twiddling our thumbs in front of empty dessert plates for about 15 minutes and the time window for our valet parking (Level III validates 2 hours for free) was running out.\n\nPity the poor souls who pay full price for this.

Every few years, I have a definingly mediocre dining experience that then becomes a reference point for all others, until it is superceded or has finally worked it's way through my system.  Level III is my new level 4 bad dining experience and the one that inspired me to finally sign up for Yelp just in order to lay down some feedback. \n\nI don't know how any restaurant with this remarkably low standard of service and quality, can survive in a competitive San Francisco market.  I think it must solely survive on the captured hotel guest clientele that are too lazy to venture down the street, though I see other reviews here that suggest people intentionally come here.   My mistake, as last minute Thanksgiving travel plans imploded and we found ourselves instead at a Union Sq hotel restaurant and at the mercy.  \n\nSo, our expectations were low to begin with but we were in an appropriately celebratory mood going in.  Level III took care of that in a hurry.  Stiff, unfriendly, unprofessional, lacking in basic social and service skills, from host, to waitress, bus boy.   I'm pretty sure our waitress had not worked in that capacity more than 2 days before bumbling through our evening.  We had to flag her down almost a dozen times just to keep water in our glass, a fork on the table, \"we still have entrees coming right?\".  Even our visa card at the end of the night went missing for a time.   The staff couldn't get out of their own way, let alone ours.    \n\nThe food?  I would coin it cafeteria-lousy.  It was so poorly executed (and I'm not a food snob, really)  that we sat across from each other, politely picking through our dry, tendon-laden Thanksgiving meal, before finally requesting an extra ladle of gravy just to be able to grease it down our throats.  Seriously, I've had better dinners at Pinewood Derby award dinners. \n\nWe walked out of there not only embarrassed to have overspent for a thoroughly mediocre experience, but also challenged by a 2 hour struggle that threatened to suck the life out of the rest of the evening.   The final kick in the head came with the bill to learn that our small, weak cocktails (Saphirre & tonic) were $12 each!   Level III = Lousy Lesson Learned.", "author": "Span D."}

I also like the fact that they have a work bench with plugs so I can even finish up some work without feeling like a buzz kill in the lobby/ bar. \n\nMinuses: Pretty much everything else - the Happy Hour is not really a Happy Hour as wines on and off the Happy Hour list are around the same price. Apps and food are overpriced and nothing special. \n\nWait staff is hit or miss. The young-ish waiters and waitresses are on point and friendly. The older waitresses aren't very friendly and don't seem to know the drink menus that well. One time I asked for an Old Fashioned and the older waitress said she'll check if they had that 'brand' Another time I asked the waitress if she had a sweet white wine by the glass for my wife.

Well mixed drinks are listed as $6 during happy hour. When I got the bill, she charged me $10 and it said 'well-whiskey' on the receipt. I asked her about it and she said she used extra alcohol. I told her a sidecar is not made with whiskey. She said she 'knew' but had to charge it that way??? It would have at least been nice if she let me know she would have to charge it as extra before giving me a bill with a bogus whiskey charge.\n\nNew plan; Farallon down the street has an AMAZING happy hour and impeccable service.

However, when such an expansive (as in large) place is practically empty, I involuntarily shiver.\n\nDRINKS: A great Happy Hour menu; better than most upscale places in Union Square. A friend/colleague went with me, and since we're both industry people, the bartender made us off-menu cocktails for a couple hours. Great prices. \n\nEATS: One should never order food when already drunk. But in the case you're rewarding yourself for a hard week's work, please do! The chicken wings are amazing, as are the parm fries. There are all on the Happy Hour menu, and come in rather well-suited portions; enough for two alcoholics, or for four rather sober people wanting snackies.\n\nATMOSPHERE: The splashes of red in an otherwise austere layout remind me of religious goings-on.

Joseph Ehrmann (of Elixir fame http://www.yelp.com/biz/elixir-san-francisco), they do deliver on quality and originality. The Harvey Milk Punch comes in 3 levels of the Big Easy classic; I'm not sure who's ordering the level 3 cuvee du cent-cinquantenaire at $90 a glass but let me know if you do, but the level 1 at $15 is a relative deal. The Shaghaied at $15 is also tasty, and the description of the cocktail lets you know that \"you'll go willingly on this Chinese journey,\" and I want to believe them.\n\nBut I'd say the real pleasant surprise for me was the food, namely the bar snacks. Items like: bistro fries seasoned with salt and pepper; a mac and cheese made up of gruyere, mascarpone, and parmeggiano reggiano; and kobe beef sliders on mini brioche buns.

It is a ridiculous building, a hideous mid budget glass elevator monstrosity with exposed duct work that has always reminded me above all else of the atrium from the death star.\n\nAnd then the setting, it is a Mariott.  Mariott has never stood for hip or cool, I'm not sure what it stands for but clueful is not it.  Mariott doing ultra lounge is like tuedo on a monkey.  Maybe I would rather see the monkey.\n\nAnd Union Square, that's tough competition.  Within a few blocks are the Saint Francis, Campton Place, Fairmont, Sir Francis Drake, Mark Hopkins, Ritz, Omni, plus any number of boutique hoels.  If you come to San Francisco and your boss puts you up in the Mariott you've got rocky times ahead my friend.\n\nAmidst all this, somebody studied the success of the W and all the boutique hotels and said, lets do this!   In fact, let's take it up a notch!\n\nSo now there's an utterly sprawling, vast restaurant lounge lobby that takes up the entire surface (other than the news stand and the elevators) of the main floor of the hotel, floor 3.  They have every conceivable amenity and seating arrangements - formal tables, couches, bar seating, bar tables, banquettes, long Cat 5 enabled computer hookup tables, Internet pay stations, semi-private flat screen roomlets (at least a dozen of those), fireplace seating, and beds.  Yes, you can even plop yourself down in one of their lobby beds and order from there.  It's nuts I tell you.\n\nFor all this, service is slow and haphazard.  Food is middling to terrible, menu is not thought out well.  Drinks are well designed but not well executed (names like Harvey Milk Punch, Marina Margarita, Emperor Norton's Mistress, Dirty Harry).  The prices are unconscionable - $8 for a draft beer????   Hello, this is not the Saint Regis.  At happy hour they have a small number of half price options which just makes it a normally priced bad meal instead of something you kick yourself in the head wishing you didn't.\n\nThe best part of the place is the design and layout.  It is pretty cool to lookout, and not bad to hang out.  If only the food, service, vibe, and prices were at that level.

If you are looking for a private dining experience then this is probably not your place. However, the food was very good.\n\nI took advantage of the Price Fix menu paired with wine. I have been on a soup binge lately and started with a carrot puree, which was not the best ever, but was a good way to start the meal. For my main course I had the Filet Minon. It was lightly seasoned and cooked to perfection! The way a piece of meat is cooked means everything to me and they nailed it. I actually went to a place \"famous for steaks\" a week later and was longing for the cut I had at Level III. That is pretty impressive when you can outshine a famous steakhouse. The dessert I chose was the cheese platter because I don't like sweet at the end of a meal. They missed a bit on this. They weren't the best cheeses and the accompanying items on the plate just didn't work.\n\nI would try this place again and recommend it to others if they are not sure where they feel like eating. The Scallops looked delicious and I would try them next time. The price is about what you would expect from similar restaurants in SF, so you won't feel ripped off.

I know it's not a rule to do so or anything, but I happen to appreciate any restaurant that would give me a choice of food, seeing as how I'd be the one subjected to... *cough*... I mean, seeing as how I'd be the one eating it.\n\nSecond, flavoring your food is NOT a bad thing. Our three-course meal consisted of a half-decent tuna tartare (because as long as the fish is fresh, it's damn hard to screw up tartare), a god-awful butternut squash pasta, and some subpar ice cream sandwiches. The flavors were boring at best.\n\nThe pasta was the single most disappointing plate of slop I've had in recent months. The butternut squash sauce and tagliatelle came out looking like gloopy mac n cheese. Not a high-end mac n cheese, mind you, but something that looks like it had a Velveeta label on it five minutes prior. \n\nAside from being an ugly plate of food, it had no seasoning whatsoever. Butternut squash and cream. I think that was it. My friends and I looked around guiltily as we emptied the salt and pepper shakers onto our plates, because after all, when dining at a nice restaurant you shouldn't have to season your own food.\n\nAnd then there were the ice cream sandwiches! A Neapolitan trio of chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla ice creams sandwiched between some cookies. The strawberry ice cream sandwich was plated next to some slices of strawberry. And you know what? The chefs at Level III cut their strawberries on the same cutting board as their onions. I know this because strawberries usually don't taste like onion! That was the end of the meal for me. Never mind that the service was decent, since we were one of only three tables in the restaurant at 12:30pm on a Saturday. \n\nArgh. Dine About Town, I want my $21.95 back.", "author": "Amy C."}

We decided to check out Level III at the JW Marriott. We walked into the hotel lookin kinda lost because all we saw were elevators and no signs indicating where Level III was. Well, duhhhhh.....we finally figured out that it was on the third level. How clever of them. Yeah, I can be the most blonde Filipino girl out there sometimes. \n\nThe bar/lounge area was right off the lobby and not far from the hotel's front desk and so we really didn't feel like we were in a separate area. Although our table was perfect, it still felt like we were in the lobby. We decided to share the Seafood Salad, Kobe Beef Burgers and Tuna Tartare. It was delicious! They really designed their dishes for sharing and mingling over cocktails. The burgers and seafood salad came in threes. 3 mini kobe beef burgers and 3 small bowls of seafood salad.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-05", "description": "I am seriously impressed by the food at Level III!\n\nLocated inside  the new JW Marriott, it's the hotel restaurant on the third level of the building - - hence, Level III.  One thing to note that the front desk is also on this level, and essentially, you are dining IN THE LOBBY.  It's a bit weird, but they've designed it in a way that works - - the lobby sort of melds right into the lounge, which melds right into the restaurant.... and while you may technically be eating your dinner in the \"lobby\" - - it's not bothersome.\n\n\nWhile it is a hotel restaurant, it's not all that formal, and quite bright.  Service was excellent - - every server we encountered was trained to the JW Marriott style - friendly, pleasant, and polite.  \n\nBut the food was EXEMPLARY.\nI am tempted to give it 5 stars because it was so good, but as I always say - - 5 stars is a class of its own, and while Level III really impresses me, the overall experience is not quite up to par.\n\nLevel III is a \"shared plates\" concept, tapas-like, if you will.  They do have larger entrees which could serve as your main course, but that, too, is best shared.  All \"level 1\" items are very small, all \"level 2\" items are a bit bigger, and all \"level 3\" items are similar to main entrees.\n\nOn this night, we started with the seafood salad, which was EXCELLENT.  I can't begin to explain how good this was, full of real lobster meat, clams, scallops and tons of flavor - - 5 stars hands down.  I could eat four plates of this by myself.  We also had the tuna tartare, and contrary to how bland it looked, with the green sauce, it was really quite good.  Then we had the Kobe Beef Sliders - - which were PERFECT.  We requested rare, and it came close... two patties with an onion ring inside the slider, it was perfect.  Last, but not least, was the Mac and Cheese w/ Black Truffles (the truffles are an added option, as is lobster mac and cheese).  At $17, this was one FANTASTIC mac and cheese, with Gruyere and mascarpone cheese.  The pasta itself was a bit overcooked for my taste, but it didn't take away from the final 5-stars I give this dish.  (Edited to add:  We also had ice cream sandwiches and freshly fried donuts with chocolate dipping sauce --  the sandwiches were excellent, piled high between cookies... the fresh donuts were good but I've had better.)\n\nCombined with a bottle of J Pinot Gris, which was quite good, the total was a $135 or so and we were stuffed.  Frankly, for hotel dining, I thought this was quite reasonable.,,, and factoring in the food quality, I'd HIGHLY recommend Level III.\n\nThis is, without a doubt, a welcomed addition to the San Francisco dining scene, and with a little time, undoubtedly will become well-known for their great food and good service, at reasonable cost.  It's a fantastic date place, if you secure private booth seating - - or in my case, I preferred a table on the outskirts of the restaurant as it was quieter on this night.  Be it a date or a group outing, Level III can host your dinner, and I'd assume groups of up to 20 people could easily eat here.\n\nLevel III takes \"shared plates\"  to a whole new level, and does not disappoint!", "author": "Grace K."}

And on top of that, the service is slow and inattentive. We'd made a reservation at 6 p.m., thinking that in any ordinary universe, two hours would be a perfect amount of time for a practically empty restaurant such as Level III to serve up a coursed meal, but because the wait staff was so inattentive, we ended up rushing to get our check taken care of by 7:30 so that we had enough time to walk to the theatre. \n\nWhen we first came in, there was no host at the host stand and had to wait. Then, once we were seated, it was 10 minutes before a waitress came by to take our drink order. And another 10 before she brought back our wine. Mind you, we were there at 6, and there were only two other seated tables in the whole place. We didn't get our first course until 6:40, at which point we told the head waiter that we needed to make an 8 p.m. curtain. At which point, they picked up the pace a bit, which was appreciated. \n\nI can barely even remember what I ate there, save to say that their French Onion soup is unmemorable and the butternut squash pasta had no subtlety (basically just tasted like butternut squash). My desserts were three little ice cream sandwiches, that I left unfinished because it was 7:40 and I had to get to the Orpheum.\n\nSlow service plus uninspired food?

With time, though, Ryan Jette, Level III's chef de cuisine and erstwhile French Laundry chef de partie, undid my unease with his enrapturing prix fixe menu menu. \n\nThe amuse bouche was a chestnut soup with apple relish. Although a bit cloying for an amuse bouche, I savored the lingering roasted chestnut aroma.\n\nIn addition to the prix fixe, I ordered the sliders. Gruyere melted down onto the plate, the patties' interiors revealed a luminous rose color, and the crispy onion rings all harmoniously married.\n\nNext, I had the tuna tartare. The chili powder, cayenne, ginger, and wasabi were pleasant additions to a ubiquitous dish.\n\nThe beef fillet au poivre with pommes frites and veal jus was a really good steak. The veal jus, which boasted a mostly salty flavor along with the slightest fruity note, inhibited the peppercorns from overwhelming the palate. The fries had an unforgettable crunch. The only conceivable way to improve them would have been to cook them in duck fat. For that, I suppose I will have to revisit Monsieur Mina.\n\nThe dessert was mundane - three bite-sized ice cream sandwiches.", "author": "Andrew F."}

Normally, this would be a big warning sign, but I had always heard mixed reviews about this place, so I didn't give it much thought since I had been wanting to try it for some time. \n\nWe arrived a little late for our reservation, but it was no problem because the place was so empty you could've heard crickets chirping. Besides one other group of people a few tables away, we were the only diners in the restaurant. \n\nDespite the lack of patrons, I really liked Level III. They have a $39 prix fixe menu that has many nice choices from the menu that add up to well over the price of the prix fixe. I ordered seared scallops, filet mignon, and a fruit filled creme brulee. The scallops were a little lukewarm, but cooked just right. The filet mignon was super soft and tender. And finally, the creme brulee was to die for (I don't even really like creme brulee). I also had some of my bf's new york steak, which made me regret my filet mignon. His steak was so juicy and melt in your mouth I totally foodgasmed. \n\nI think this place is a little underrated. The general complaints I've heard from people is that it's expensive and the food isn't that great, but I think if you go with the prix fixe menu, it's not really more pricey than many of the other nicer restaurants out there.

Well, when I went to slide my drink out of the way it got caught on the lens of  the fixture (I guess it's not really flush at all when you think about it).  I ended up spilling some of my drink which I wasn't very pleased about.  It wasn't a lot, but enough where I needed a couple of napkins.\n\nOur server, Jess (short for Jessica I think - but after two Shanghai drink specials I asked if we could call her Jess and she was more than happy to oblige) was equally friendly, very pleasant and down to earth.  She got us exact directions to the SF Playhouse, none of us had a clue to where it was.  \n\nAs Tasha said, the ham and cheese and sliders were yummy, as well as the tempura veggies with dipping sauce.

And the sad part about this is that its predecessor, the Pacific Grill, which was overpriced and bland in taste, looks better than this newly renovated cafe.   Nothing really appealed for me at lunch today.  I was hoping that the Chicken Salad and the French Onion Soup would wow me, but it was very bland.  They give you a good amount of chicken than the weeds that they serve on your plate.  Coffee Service was abysmal.  You call that service?  The server and busperson nearly ran into each other, and then the follies continue when he forgets to bring the half-and-half.  And the joint only had 3 or 4 tables during lunch.  They weren't busy at all.  I will stick with the places across the street from the this place.  JW Marriott is a big joke.  Too bad the Pan Pacific Hotel is gone.", "author": "Tony L."}

It's kind of hidden but it is a very large space with lots of seating areas and lots of standing room if you want to mingle with different people in a large group. I can't really comment on the drinks because I usually don't get alcoholic drinks but they did offer a HH specials menu. I tried my friends' mac and cheese and fries which were pretty good.

First off, it is located in the lobby level of the JW Marriott hotel on Post Street, about a block from Union Square. Grab a seat by the windows and take a peek at the cocktail list and snack menu. Chicken sticks with peanut sauce, your typical Thai style satay. Sweet potato fries, a substantial portion, crisp, sweet, with your choice of seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic, parmesan, or all of the above.) Artichoke dip, featuring house made tortilla chips, which in my opinion was the star of the dish. The mixed nuts were a pleasant surprise, actually a tower of various nuts-smoked almonds, wasabi peas, cinnamon pecans, glazed cashews, and spicy peanuts.  The cocktails we tried: blueberry lemonade-blueberry vodka, fresh blueberries, not too sweet or sour, but very refreshing, pumpkin martini-fresh pumpkin puree, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla vodka, sweet but not too, like pumpkin pie in a glass, blue cosmo-with blue curacao and white cranberry juice, was a little too sour. The downside of happy hour is the $5 drinks doesn't include the specialty cocktails, so we ended up paying full price for all of them. Still, it provided a good escape from the street for a nice afternoon buzz.", "author": "Coren D."}

The place is so bright with these huge chandeliers hanging down above the tables, I thought I was going to melt (2)!  The server noticed and came over right away to open the window for us (5).  Our server was very friendly throughout our entire meal (5).  They were out of the wine we ordered, so they upgrated for the same price (5).  We ordered the french onion soup (4 - smelly but tasty), the loster bisque (3 - very, very runny), tuna tartar (5 - yummy), macroni and cheese w/ lobster (4 - cheesy and tasty but not much of a lobster flavor), and ratitouille (3 - not very exciting).  The timing on the dishes was a little off, which I expect will get better with time.  The place is beautiful though and the colors incorporated in the chairs and carpet make it very nice.

Having never been in the city, almost alone, on a Christmas we weren't really sure what to do with ourselves. We decided we'd get all dolled up and go out to a fabulous dinner at the Top of the Mark, Fairmont, or Ritz and  play fancy tourist in our own town I mean ya gotta check out these legendary SF locations sometime right? Well silly of us to think we could get reservations for any of these places on Christmas day for our fabulous dinner. We then turned to yelp and opentable to find out where we could eat. We live in Nob Hill so Level III was close. The reviews were only so-so so we went in with low expectations and were just happy they were able to get us in (plus we got open table points, always a plus for mystery place). The service, although clearly bear boned staff was excellent. They were totally full and only had about 2 people waiting so they were constantly rushing around, but very apologetic for any amount of wait and very friendly and informative about the menu. The menu wasn't anything amazing, but everything we had we liked. We each had a soup then shared a few small plates. i loved my french onion soup, his lobster bisque was a bit watery, but had a nice flavor. We had the mac n cheese with lobster which was rich(waaaay to heavy for my taste, but i don't like mac n cheese), some veal dish and oysters. Everything was good. I would go back for their happy hour deals if I went again. Overall they made our Christmas evening one to remember.", "author": "Audrey V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-20", "description": "I'm a bit torn with this review, and I'll try to explain why.  My friends and I decided to take advantage of Level III's dine about town menu last weekend before a big night out, and while the food didn't disappoint, the service left something to be desired.  Well, let me rephrase that - our waitress just plain old sucked.  Granted, I was the first of our party to arrive and was seated (by the manager himself), but the waitress ignored me for a good 15 minutes before the MANAGER (bless him) came and took my drink order.  Once the rest of my friends arrived, it went from bad to worse.  It took another 15 minutes for the girl to come around to take the rest of our drink orders, 30 minutes after that for her to decide to take our food orders, and then probably another half hour or more for our food to actually arrive.  In the meantime, the restaurant is still half empty, our glasses are empty, no one has come around to see if we wanted another round, and we are practically gnawing at our arms to ease our hunger pains.  All the tables around us somehow got bread, and yet no one has even offered us anything, despite us having been there for an hour at this point.  We had to flag down a busboy to beg for a basket of bread - at what restaurant do you have to ASK for bread??  Ok, so then we finally get our food - after another debacle where our waitress mistakenly brings us another table's order - and we pause for maybe 2 seconds in our ravenous eating to notice that the steak actually is pretty darn good.  At that point, we were ready to just leave and get on with our nights, but one of the girls decided to go voice our complaints to the manager, and he turned into recovery mode faster than a blink of an eye.  He practically ran to the bar and brought us 2 rounds of drinks, then proceeded to load us full of yummy desserts, including chocolate fondue and cheesecake, on top of our DAT desserts.  The waitress, however, was not apologetic at all and didn't even seem to care.  The manager was incredibly gracious and saved the night for us, and I would consider going back solely because of him.", "author": "Irene W."}

We're thinking hotel bar/restaurant (think Ame) where it will be cool vibe....well, let's just say there was NO vibe, because I think there were only two other people in the entire place.  It's a weird open space, and the reddish color everywhere just doesn't work.   So I'm figuring that because there's no one in the restaurant, the wait staff would be more attentive.  Well, the woman came over about 3 times in the first 30 seconds to ask if we wanted drinks, even though we told her we needed a couple of minutes to pick a bottle of wine.  Then later, when we wanted to get the hell out - no one was to be found.  The food was - eh.  The mac & cheese was okay, but nothing special.  The seafood salad was not good (gritty!), the salad was fairly boring, and the tuna tartare was good - but really hard to eat because it was in these miniscule pieces which were sprinkled along the plate (i.e. it looked nice, but wasn't very substantial).
