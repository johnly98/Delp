The meat is tender, well cooked but it's lack of the duck's original flavors. With the sweetness of the sauce, it pairs quite well with the Merlot.

Her reply was \"we don't usually do that.\"  When I said that neither of us wants to look at the wall, she reluctantly gave in.  You would think with virtually every table empty, her response would have been \"sure.\"\n\nWe made a mistake in ordering the foie gras.  It's served on seared pineapple and two figs on the plate.

In the past we have really enjoyed our meals there. Our most recent dinner there however was a huge disappointment. I don't know if they are now under new ownership but the restaurant has  changed, for the worse in my opinion. \nMy dinner companion and I ate here Friday 6/15/18. Our server immediately rubbed us the wrong way with her abrasive attitude, my companion asked for ice for her water, but the server informed her that she had just poured from a pitcher of ice water that was cold enough!\nWe are familiar with the menu. My companion ordered from the prix fixe selection but told the server she would like crepes Suzette for dessert. My companion always orders the crepes which are always served old-school style table-side. The server told her that she had a choice of other desserts that came with her meal. My companion said that she did not mind paying extra but cane to the restaurant specifically for the crepes Suzette. The server said she would speak to the cook. She then began to take my order. I respectfully informed her that I have very strict dietary limitations, no sugar or starches. I asked if I could gave plain vinaigrette on my salade compose as I did not want the pistachio honey dressing. I asked for no fries and maybe just extra vegetables. She first denied my request then later said she would have to ask the kitchen. She took menus away before I could order wine. I had to ask another server for the menu again to order wine. \nOur food arrived. I noticed my salad looked pretty but had no dressing at all. I signaled the server and informed her of this. She looked confused, not understanding what I wanted. Someone else bought me a cruet of oil and vinegar.\nMy small hanger steak arrived, cooked properly and accompanied by carrots and zucchini. I can't eat carrots but enjoyed the zucchini.\nA male employee came to our table (we assumed he was a cook) and put his arm around my shoulder with inappropriate familiarity. He informed my companion that they were out of butane or whatever fuel they use to cook crepes table side. My companion expressed disappointment. He then said he would \"take care of us\" and would ask if the kitchen could prepare the dish. The server returned sometime later with a plate of crepes, telling my companion that she was lucky that they agreed to prepare the dish for her. My companion ate the dish but said it was extremely sweet and different from the other times she's had it there.\nThe man returned and reminded us that he had \"taken care\" of us and to make sure we wrote a good yelp review.\nI wish I could write a good review, but with all the great places to eat in the city this restaurant no longer qualifies as a place to receive a good dining experience.", "author": "ALICE l."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-14", "description": "Having driven by over the years, I was looking forward to finally dining here recently on a Saturday evening. The restaurant is located at the crossroads where Laguna Honda Blvd, Dewey Blvd and Woodside Ave. meet. There's a parking lot on the side for about 12 cars, but it appears to be a shared lot with several other businesses next to the restaurant.  You can't stop in front if you need to drop off someone since the curb lane is a traffic lane. Do the drop off in the lot. \n\nThe bistro is cozy and quaint, especially for the tables on the left side of the room. We were fortunate to be seated at a table for two by the front right with a view of street and Laguna Honda Hospital.  A server welcomed us and gave us the menus.  Then water and a basket of warm baguette and butter was brought over.\n\nBesides their regular menu, they offer two prix fixe specials: $40 per person for a three course dinner for two and a $65 per person for a three course dinner plus two glasses of wine or champagne. We instead were going with our Groupon deal for any two entr\u00e9es, two glasses of wine and a dessert from the prix fixe menu.\n\nEntrees:\nFaux-Filet de Boeuf - grilled Angus 12oz sirloin in a Madeira wine sauce with truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus. My entr\u00e9e selection ordered medium rare. Tasty Madeira sauce but the sirloin was not as tender as I had expected. But given that this was the same price as the filet mignon, the filet was a better selection. \n\nFilet de Boeuf Charolais - grass fed 8oz filet mignon in a green peppercorn sauce with truffle mashed potatoes and zucchini. Had a taste of the filet. Ordered medium rare, it was so buttery tender. Delicious.\n\nDessert:\nTarte Maison - housemade mix fruit tart. A thin crust tart with apricot and blueberries with a glaze. Tasty and not overly sweet. \n\nGlad I finally dined here.  ChouChou is a neighborhood gem.  Good French food, but not the best. But this is a bistro and I would come back given the overall experience.", "author": "Al L."}

I ate here about a decade ago with my parents, so I was down to revisit. Plus, I adore French food. I believe he made a reservation about a week prior for dinner on Friday, March 23rd at 8pm. I think the reservation was for 8, but we ended up being a party of 6 instead. They put a few tables together to accommodate our party, so they just took a two top away.\n\n$40 Per Person 3 Course Dinner x2\n*Entrees ou Salades - Soupe A L'Oignon: french onion soup, croutons, and gruyere cheese ($9.95) & PEI Moules Marinieres: mussels, shallots, garlic, and parsley, light cream, and white wine broth ($13.95)\n*Les Plats - Angus Bifteck De Suspension: hanger steak, blue cheese sauce served with pomme frites, and tumeric aioli ($27.95) & Cuisse De Canard Confit Wellington: all natural moulard duck leg confit, mushrooms duxelle, diced potatoes, and cherry tomatoes, garlic, shallots, and parsley, maple vinaigrette ($27.95)\n*Desserts - Tarte Maison: house made chocolate walnut tart ($8) & Mousse Au Chocolat: chocolate mousse ($8)\n\n$65 Per Person 3 Course Dinner + Glass Of Wine or Champagne x2\n*Appetizers or Salads - Escargots A L'Ail Gratines: infused snails with butter, shallots, garlic, and parsley with panko crust ($11.95) & Salade De Crabe: crab meat, avocado and pate feuilletee, light chives cream dressing ($13.95)\n*Entree - Cotelettes D'Agneau Roties: lamb chops, yams landaises (bacon), haricot vert, plum sauce ($31.95) & Faux-Filet De Boeuf: grilled angus 12 oz shell steak (sirloin), truffle mashed potato amd asparagus, madeira wine sauce ($34.95)\n*Desserts: Creme Brulee: vanilla custard ($8) & Ile Flottante: light soft meringue, vanilla cream, (creme anglaise) caramel, toasted almonds ($9.50)\n*Monthuys - Brut Reserve Champagne: pinot meunier, chardonnay, pinot noir, france, nv ($20) x2\n\nFour of us ordered from their prix fixe menus. Apparently these are their SF Restaurant Week menus, but they just serve them all year round. For each menu, you just pick one item per course. Above are the dishes we selected. I listed the actual prices on their regular menu for comparison. If added together a la carte, the two $40 menus would have $95.80 and the two $65 menus would have been $150.03, so we saved $35.83 overall which isn't bad. I got the escargots, sirloin, and brulee. I love garlic butter, so the extra sauce was great for bread dipping. I got my steak rare, which was great for me, but it may have been under for some people. If you like the american version of rare, it might be best to go up to medium rare. Their cooking temp was very French. I don't recall the brulee being good or bad, so I'm thinking it was okay. We did everything family style, so I tried a bit of all the dishes. I liked the mussels as they were plump, but I thought the sauce could have used more flavor. The duck confit wasn't really my kind of dish as I usually find the texture a little too mushy. Overall, everything was fairly good.\n\n*Foie Gras: seared foie gras, caramelized pineapple and oven roasted fresh figs, moscato sauce ($23.95)\n*Ravioli Aux Trois Champignons: three mushroom filled house made ravioli with truffled cream ($14.95)\n*Frites A L'Huile De Truffes Et Parmesan: house made fries with white truffle oil, regiano parmigiana cheese, and parsley ($9.95)\n*Noix De Saint Jacques Sautees: seared day boat scallops, leeks fondue, and zucchini, truffled saffron beurre blanc sauce ($32.95)\n*Angus Boeuf Bourguignon: braised beef, burgundy wine, mushrooms, bacon, pearl onions, and baby carrots, served with tagliatelli ($24.95)\n*Louis Bernard, Domaine le Garrigon, Cotes du Rhone, Cuvee des Vieux Truffiers, 2015: organic ($45)\n*Corkage ($25)\n*Coffee: regular ($2.75) x2\n*Espresso: regular ($2.75)\n\nThe other two people in our party ordered a la carte. I adore seared foie, so I enjoyed that dish. And the mushroom ravioli? Yum! I literally finished off all the sauce with the complimentary bread and butter. So good! I'm not a fan of beef bourguignon as I like my meat with a little more chew. The scallops were nice and meaty though. I couldn't try the truffle fries as I'm not eating deep fried foods at the moment, but they smelled good.\n\nWe were here for a good two hours, so we were the last party as they close at 9:30pm. Being a larger party, we tried to split the bill. They only take two credit cards per table, so bring cash or venmo each other if you want to split the bill. It did feel a little weird being there past closing as I felt like they were just waiting for us to leave. We managed to wrap it up and get out of there around 10pm. Parking was a breeze as they have a small parking lot to the right of the restaurant.\n\nA fun birthday celebration. I grew up in a french restaurant as my dad used to own one, so this spot reminded me of the kind of food my father used to make. Very comforting.", "author": "Elena N."}

They make the duck confit wellington style meaning it was covered in bread, which misses the whole point of confit. The salmon has some sort of breading and was also fried. Salmon is not a fish meant to be fried. The beet salad had a raspberry vinaigrette that was so sweet as to render it inedible. \n\nThe only thing coming close to delicious were the $9 garlic french fries.\nAfter dinner we came home and everyone needed to find something to eat. \n\nThere are too many proper French bistro in the city for this place to stay open. \n\nAlso, beware, if you have an expired groupon, they won't accept it for the cash value. You must get the prix fixe even though the voucher clearly states they must accept the cash value. They were super rude and I will NEVER return.

It is really old, and uninviting.  Service was bad too.  But the worst part was a cheap wine and aweful main courses.  We were treated badly because we came in with a Groupon which you are required to show before ordering.  I think that's why the food was inferior.  We ordered duck which was chewy and fatty.  The grains that accompany the duck were terrible and it was less than a teaspoon.  Don't expect a generous or a tasty meal here.\nFor the price you better off dining at Prospect.

They were absolutely divine! They weren't very large, but they were cooked perfectly - tender and just a bit chewy. Make sure to have a bit of broth with every bite - you won't regret it. I even used it as a dip for the baguettes just to savor it a bit longer. My friend had the salad - very typical, but looked nice and fresh.\n\nFor my entree, I chose the Duck Wellington. The duck was done nicely. It was fall off the bone tender. The mushroom duxelle was very nice, adding that earthy flavor to an already succulent duck. I actually found the maple vinaigrette a bit salty when eaten with just the duck, but when you included a tiny diced potato, it was a very nice, complete bite. My friend opted for the Mushroom Souffle. Though it was delivered impeccably, it was actually a bit burnt according to my friend.\n\nFor dessert, I opted for the chocolate pear tart. I found it to be too dense and didn't really expect it to be warm. The pear flavor was also completely masked by some glaze on top - tasted of apricots. I had a bite of my friend's chocolate almond - I was definitely not a fan of the warm, slightly softened almonds on top.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

Walking in at 6 PM there was only one table occupied with two; the warm colors of the interior, soft French music in the background instantly put us in a relaxed mood. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly at the small corner table.  Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive throughout the evening.\n\nWe took a while to order, being not big fans of duck we went for the $65 pre fixe and some ala cartes. The complimentary baguette came first, it was warm, crispy outside slightly chewy inside, just perfect with butter. We enjoyed all the dishes, some more then the others.\n\nSalade De Crabe beautifully presented; a smooth mixer of mild tasting avocado and crab. Good but a drizzle of lemon juice or some lightly dressed arugula will make it even better. \nMussels in white sauce, generous portion, fresh and tender, again the sauce was slightly blend  but definitely good.\nScallops - four good size scallops sitting on top of zucchini slices with grilled leek in the center. We liked the taste and all the ingredients except  the sauce was a bit too rich and too much. \nFilet Mignon was the best dish of the night. A thick piece of tender filet cooked to a perfect medium rare. I love it that steam came out after cutting it open, juicy with great flavors even better then the one I had at Ruth Chris.\nThe prosecco and the glass of Sauvignon blanc were both good as well as the light dessert of floating island and coffee.

My roommate went, she said she felt ignored and the food wasn't great, but I had still wanted to try it myself. I came in for dinner and ordered a glass of wine, foie gras, and scallops. Their wine selection, for a French restaurant, is very small. When the foie gras came out the surface on both sides was black. I tried it and it just tasted burnt, not charred and I couldn't do it. I was also sad it was covered with so much stuff. Grilled pineapple, fig jam, and some type of sauce. This is my opinion, but I felt like they were adding on the dish to hide poor quality foie gras. I sent it back and asked for it lightly seared. It came back much better! Unfortunately, that was the only highlight. My scallops were chewy and the zucchini that came with the dish was cold. For service, they were attentive but I was disappointed my table wasn't cleared from crumbs in between dishes. I know that sounds picky, but for wine, and app, and entree comes to $75 before tip, I expect service to be a little more than giving me food. \n\nWhen I arrived around 8pm it was semi-busy, but I won't be returning for dinner.

It's a bit Parisian. It's old school, stick to their 3 course $25 prix fixe menu for brunch. Not crowded on a weekend day at noon, which is to say, perfect if you are looking for a nice restaurant to catch up with your closest girlfriends and you don't want to feel rushed. God knows I suck at picking restaurants. I pick the in crowd restaurant, which means, despite the fact I have a reservation, the services often felt rushed. Or the restaurant is so crowded all we could hear is others talking. As of late, we've determined to find places that are not so popular with the Millennials, or young parents with their young children, and to embrace our own unique connections with the beloved France and England, we'd attempt to find British pub or French bistro for a leisurely Sunday brunch.\n\nSo this is a good spot for inexpensive French food, and a good quiet place to reconnect with your besties. \n\nNote the parking is behind the restaurant and is a bit tricky. You need to turn right into their lot before you pass the restaurant.\n\nOne girl was born on that street. She's now a mother of two. Two other local San Franciscan girls also their unique ties to the neighborhood, so we felt rather serendipitous when the restaurant came up in our picking list. \n\nThere is no reason to come during restaurant week. They offer the same three course for the same price. Lunch to me is a better deal only because for French food, dinner is heavier than I'd like. I'd stick with what is truly French. Crepes are exceptional. Pork is well done. The frites are nice but not matchstick so that part I did not get it (shouldn't all frites be cut like matchsticks in French bistro?). No matter, it was tasty.  And finally, do start with the French Onion Soup. It's not too salt and made way better than any number of those French ally restaurants in the Financial District. \n\nThe creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is very good. I'd go with that or the chocolate. It's a hard choice to make so do come at least in a pair.\n\nWhat I find to be charming about this place is their seemingly haphazard decor, it really did feel like you'd stepped into a local cafe bistro in Paris. Even the seating is cut a bit too tight for tall and slim Americans girls. We had Rose and coffee to go with our meal. It's a very perfect place... for both neighborhood families or for secret rendezvous for lovers from across town. It's unlikely you'd run into anyone you know at this place. Its not located in the hot and happening hoods. So when you plan your next morning after meal and are looking for some place that is romantic, intimate, charming with delicious food and not rushed service, do consider this place.", "author": "Victoria E."}

I'm not a big fan of the interior, but other than that, I thought the food was really good. My friend and I split the groupon deal that includes 2 entrees, 2 glasses of house wine, and 1 dessert to share. We ordered an assorted cheese plate with almonds, fruit, and honey which was a great starter and compliment to the groupon deal. We both ordered the filet mignon, 2 glasses of merlot, and Ile Flottante for dessert. Bread and butter was complimentary. Everything was yummy and we were stuffed before we even got to dessert!\n\nThe restaurant wasn't crowded when we were there. I may be because it's in an unfortunate location. It is at the end of a T-intersection. You would either have to park in the small parking lot next to it (also used by the 2-4 businesses next to it or in the residential neighborhood.

It is kind of in a weird location (as it's right in a T intersection with plenty of busy traffic and in a residential area, yet next to the Forest Hill bus station) but this is like a neighborhood's well-kept secret for some good French food that never gets overly busy or packed. \n\nI came here for Restaurant week and did their three course meal for $40/person (i felt this was  one of the best deals I found featured) and since I came with my mom and sister, we decided to go for variety and order different dishes so we could try a little bit of each! \n\nFor appetizers, we got the mussels, french onion soup, and the crab meat in avocado. All of it was soooo good. I realized I don't think I'm a huge fan of french onion soup in general (I had some in France and thought it was just okay), but how they make it here is very delicious. The mussels were good (and soaked in a really yummy white wine sauce) and the avocado crab meat was something different but not bad if you're looking for something different.\n\nNext came the entree's; and I LOVED the steak I got! Medium rare all the way and it was cooked PERFECTLY. My sister got the pork chop (which was delicious also) and my mom the salmon. Everyone was satisfied with their dishes. The steak and pork chop came with a side of fries too!\n\nAnd lastly (my favorite!), the desserts! I got the creme brulee; sister the ile flottante, and mom got the tart of the day with apricot. Everything was good. Get the ile flottante (floating meringue) if you never had it before and want something out of the ordinary.\n\nI would definitely come back here again.

I was very pleasantly surprised by Chouchou and would highly recommend this place, especially for Restaurant Week prices. \n\nFirst, I want to note that the complimentary bread that comes before dinner is really good. They came out warm/hot, and were very tasty. I thought this was a really nice touch, shows that the restaurant pays attention to details, and puts in effort. The servers were also very attentive and kept refilling the water and bread.\n\nFor the appetizer, I had the crab avocado salad. They gave an ample portion with an ample amount of crab in the salad. It tasted a bit tangy on its own, but went perfectly with the little piece of biscuit that came with it. I had a taste of my friend's mussels, and they were also excellent. \n\nNext is the salmon entree. I like this dish, and didn't find the sauce on it to be too heavy. This dish also came with artichokes, which were a bit sour, but still great. \n\nFor dessert, I got creme brulee, which was fantastic. I tried my friend's chocolate mousse, and really liked it as well. \n\nThe service was great. We were a group of 8 who were immersed in conversation and had inadvertently stayed until 10:30PM, past the restaurant's closing time. The servers were so polite that they just waited for us, didn't rush us, and didn't even tell us they were closed. We felt really bad when we finally realized that they had closed already. \n\nAlso, it looked like this restaurant is doing great business because it was packed.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

Place is small and the staff all have French accents which makes you forget you're in SF. The tables are relatively really close together and they have a small parking lot on the side of their establishment.\n\nWe were directed upstairs. The stair mats were ripped and had giant air bubbles. The upstairs seating was a tiny balcony which felt slanted and not very stable. The paint was chipping from the ceiling and the handle bars shook a little. It was a little unsettling sitting up there, not knowing if any second the floor below us would collapse. LOL.\n\nAnyway, $40 dollars for a 3 course meal was a steal! As simple as their bread was deliciously crunchy which was an initial sign that this place must be great! The boyfriend ordered the three mushroom ravioli and I ordered the crab and avocado salad. Both were plate lickin' good. The boyfriend kept making satisfying noises as he licked his plate clean. The crab and avocado salad was almost too pretty to eat, but also very fresh and light. As for our entrees, we weren't as excited. The braised beef was smothered in sauce and cut into chunks. Nothing amazing there. The duck dish was huge and the gravy was sweet and tangy. Both were interesting, but nothing orgasmic. The fruit tart wasn't what I expected but it tasted sweet. The boyfriend wasn't a huge fan of the meringue but only because it was his first time and didn't like the texture. \n\nOverall, this place is average based on what we ordered.

It's cozy and captures a bit of the vibe of the bistros of France. \n\nMy pal and I started off with the moules marini\u00e8re, which were creamy, fragrant and luscious.\nThen my mind was fairly blown by both of our entr\u00e9es. I got the noix de Saint Jacques: scallops which arrived perfectly seared and on beds of thinly sliced and poached zucchini in an exquisite saffron beurre blanc, surrounding a fondue of leeks. It was just as excellent as I hoped it would be. My dear friend Tracy got the duck confit, which was expertly prepared, stuffed with a phyllo pouch of mushrooms duxelle (!), and served in a wonderfully balanced maple cream sauce with roasted potatoes and cherry tomatoes. \n\nThe cr\u00eape suzette was anticlimactic. The cr\u00eape did not seem to be very freshly made, arrived in too much of the Grand Marnier/butter sauce and did not appear to have been flamb\u00e9ed (as advertised), but all was forgiven after that dinner. \n\nI also found it strange that the wine menu did not include all of the producers' names--this seems like it would be a given at a French restaurant in this price range and with food this good. Overall it was a very good experience and as I live just down the road in the Inner Sunset I will definitely be back for both of those entr\u00e9es!", "author": "X-topher B."}

My main complaint almost after every course we ordered, we were told of the restrictions of the Groupon.  I found it quite embarrassing.\nThe food was a mixed bag.  Our appetizers were excellent, I had the escargot and wife and son had the onion soup. Side note, my son didn't eat all his soup and what seemed to me, he was scoffed at. For the main course I had the special, cod w/ a gnocchi in a creamy pesto sauce.  My son had the steak and instead of being cooked med well it was very well done. Another point, the chef made his way to chit/chat and talk about dish to everyone but avoided our table.  For dessert, we had fruit tart and chocolate mousse. Both of those were good.\nOverall, the service was ok and food decent.  We spent well over what Groupon covered.   In fact, we calculated it and we only saved $12.  Yet, I felt we were stigmatized for using Groupon. From my two experiences there, I would recommend not using groupon.  My suggestion to the restaurant is don't offer a discount like Groupon when you're going to treat user differently.  Most people have read Groupon and know what it entails maybe only bring up Groupon if the customer orders something outside what it covers.  Also, shame on the chef, we saw him do rounds talking about dishes with others but completely skipped our table. \nWill I come back, maybe.  The escargot is really good.", "author": "Mike S."}

Down to earth and cozy restaurant with the most amazing duck breast EVER ! Starting off with the appetizer, the steak tartare is good but not as good as the ones in France where the raw meat are in bigger chunks and seared for a second. This tastes a little like raw tuna but the flavor (medium spicy) gives quite a pleasant kick. The red and white wines  both taste spicy, somehow, good spicy. The entrees were the amazing duck that's tender, juicy, flavorful beyond words, and the filet mignon which is probably one of the best ones in town. The medium cooked slab of meat is even better in the middle because it's rarer. As for the dessert, our very cute and bubbly waitress Melanie recommended the meringue. That was quite the bomb too !

Beef is fresh and delicious! \n\nFrench onion soup - damn this is good! I don't enjoy eating onions at all but I dream about this soup! The gruyere they use is amazing quality so it makes the soup extra good! I also love how they have bread pieces inside the soup so it's actually filling, and has more substance than just overall heaviness.\n\nPEI mussels - I order this on occasion when I'm feeling it, however I will add that I usually make it myself and it tastes similar to here so I rarely order it. However it is delicious here. \n\nBurger w/any cheese you want - one of my favorite things about their burger is that you can pick any cheese you want. Naturally, I pick gruyere since it's my fave! I actually didn't expect this to be as good as it was but damn it's amazing. I also like how they cooked my burger patty to a perfect medium rare, per my request. Also noteworthy is that they tend to have the burger available on the dine about town/restaurant week prix fixe. \n\nFloating island aka ile flottante - this is also my favorite dessert here, it's literally a must-have every time I'm here. I love when a restaurant does a great meringue, mostly because it's one of the more difficult things to make, but I also love their vanilla sauce and even their almond slivers and I'm not even a huge fan of almonds. \n\nAs for whether you should come here, just do it, my discerning tastebuds told you to!", "author": "Constance C."}

This restaurant has been at its current location for several years and has garnered rave reviews for its food and d\u00e9cor.  We have driven passed the restaurant many times, as well as riding by on Muni ... so we were enthused at finally trying it.  The $72 Groupon dinner for two (two glasses of house wine, two entrees, and one dessert to share) made it especially attractive.\n\nReviewers got it right about the d\u00e9cor: quaint, friendly, unpresumptuous.  The establishment is a small venue so tables are indeed crowded.  Reviewers also got it right about the bread: crunchy and delicious.\n\nUnfortunately the entrees were quite disappointing.  My wife ordered lamb chops: they were not chops in the common usage, rather three large pieces of what looked like meat but, counting bone, amounted to about a mouthful each.  They were covered with a heavy cloying dark brown sauce that was described as made of plums but which added little to the overall flavor of the dish.  Green beans were ... green beans.  The yam was touted as cooked with bacon but neither of us could detect its addition.\n\nI ordered a shell steak with asparagus and mashed potato.  Lots of gristle and fat on the meat that was drowning in a dark sauce that tasted overwhelmingly of pepper (definitely no taste of the Madeira wine it was supposed to contain).  Billed as \"truffle-mashed,\" the two dollops of potato were generally bland.\n\nWe ordered the \u00cele Flottante based on gushing comments of reviewers.  As described by the menu, the meringue was indeed light but tasteless, though the cream, caramel, and toasted almonds were delightful.\n\nWe ordered house wine: unbelievably, the white had no real taste of its own.  Try as we might we could not place the vintage.  The red was, well, your plain generic house wine.  Servers were friendly and attentive, and food was delivered promptly.\n\nSo what to make of this experience?  How can our dinner have been so at odds with the many great 4- and 5-star reviews??  We are well-educated seniors and not at all unfamiliar with fine dining.  While my wife disagrees with me, I am willing to give Chouchou another pass, perhaps for lunch, focusing on their orange soup and chicken or duck, dishes that would certainly bear the telltale marks of French cuisine.  But until then, we stick with our two star rating.", "author": "Edward K."}

Presentation was excellent as well. \n\nHowever, the food was just meh. \n\nI was fired up to try this place. I always drive by and wonder what the food is like. Now I know. It wasn't bad - just wasn't very good. \n\nUpon sitting Melanie brought out hot, fresh baked French bread. We ordered a few cappuccinos while we decided what to order. \n\nThey offer prix fixe lunch and dinner menus which I really love seeing in restaurants. We came for lunch. I ordered the $25 prix fixe which came with French onion soup, three mushroom ravioli in truffle sauce and the Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nMom and grandma both ordered the mussels in white wine sauce and the lamb crepes. \n\nMussels were great. Sauce was perfection. Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was great. Generous portion. Everything else was off. \n\nMy French onion soup was so sweet it was almost inedible. It made me question if the salt and sugar were mixed up in the kitchen? Same with the crepes. Too sugary sweet. For savory lamb crepes sweet shouldn't even be in the equation. My ravioli in truffle cream sauce was ok but too heavy handed on the truffle and bathing in cream. :( Though it only came with three ravioli it was so unappetizing I only ate one. \n\nAside from the underwhelming food the restaurant itself is quite charming, well decorated and cozy. Good service makes up for lackluster food. Melanie showcased ideal interaction.", "author": "Rosalyn W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-02-11", "description": "We decided to revisit this restaurant as the other nearby French restaurant (Chapeau!) was fully booked.  \n\nAs we were pretty early for dinner we were the first patrons to be seated yet the place became filled as time went on.  The two young women who seated and served us were as usual very friendly and courteous.  However, the owner/chef (who also took our order and served some dishes) could have been welcoming. I mean we were the only people seated for some minutes at first and he just ignored us. Later on he seemed to be brusque and not at all friendly as he asked if we were ready to order; I'd expect nothing like this from anyone even a server.  When he came by with a few of our dishes he never said \"Excuse me\" to give us warning; we had to guess what he was doing and move out our glasses and bread plate to make room.  We all ordered the $40 prix fixe menu, and I had the mussels.  We intended to share this dish, but it appeared that the chef was irritated that I put the bowl in the middle of the table thereby messing up the placement... No words spoken either when he hurriedly replaced the dish in front of me like if a child had made a great mistake and was being corrected.  He was okay when he asked if we'd like to leave the (huge) bowl of sauce (for the mussels) and we said 'yes'.  However, he didn't ask if we'd like more bread (to sop up the sauce of which there literally was like a half pint of cream used); I realize one usually asks the server for things like that yet since he was the server of sorts sometimes it would have been good to follow through and ask or so I thought.  So we just used whatever remnants of bread we had and left it at that. He also seemed okay to light a b'day candle on my husband's dessert and wished him a happy birthday. Just himself no other staff member and it was the quietest of song-strange but it was fine we didn't need the attention.  Yet it was bizarre since usually all staff would gather round and with the celebrant a 'happy birthday'.  Thus, it was just totally mixed feelings from him the entire visit.  Plus as he took our orders he had coughed loudly mouth opened to one side a few times with no apologies.  I noticed that he was very warm and talkative to some other diners perhaps regulars.  Interestingly he never opened up to the Asians who were in the dining room the same way.\n\nThe food was like most people report:  Good but not stellar.  In fact, the hanger steak was unbecoming to look at yet from all accounts from my son it tasted all right.\n\nMy husband and I ordered the pork chop which was fine except again nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nDesserts were good as well but nothing fantastically extraordinary. \n\nI have to admit that the decor is getting very outdated as it's been the same for years now.  And the toilet is terrible as it's unisex, the staff uses it too so you may need to wait even longer near the highly busy, noisy kitchen and/or the station where the staff cut the bread.  AIso in full view of the rest of the diners.  \n\nAll in all, it was an all right dinner.  However, I'd expect the owner to be more welcoming of all patrons equally.  At least in France (Paris especially even) this is what we've been treated too.\n\nUPDATE-8/30/18:  Since someone (the owner or the stalker who seems fixated about my negative reviews of ChouChou and others) got Yelp to delete my update about ChouChou I'll write it again here:  From the recent majority of reviewers' accounts ChouChou is declining all around.

It's a cute little French bistro that looks very unassuming from the outside but has this cute charm once you walk in.\n\nWhen you first get seated they give you this wonderful amazing bread that's still piping hot from the oven and is nice and crispy around the side. Between my friend and I, we must've devoured 3 loaves of this stuff! It was that good!!\n\nI started with the PEI Moules Provencale - mussels in a tomato-based soup. Pretty tasty, especially once you finish the mussels and can soak some more of that delicious bread with the tomato broth.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Cuisse de Canard Confit Wellington. This was an interesting dish and I have mixed feelings about it. The meat was really nice and tender and fell off the bone, but I'm not sure how I felt about the maple vinaigrette. I felt like the sweetness from the vinaigrette actually overpowered the natural duck taste, so I wasn't able to taste the duck very well.\n\nFor my dessert I had the Ile Flottante, which was a very light and tasty dessert and exactly what I was looking for to end a very filling meal with.\n\nI had made reservations through Open Table and ended up having to adjust my reservations a couple times. Never had any trouble finding available time slots, even though my last update was a mere 2 hours before my reserved time slot. \n\nAlso didn't have any problems with parking as they have a small lot off to the side with room for maybe 10 cars or so.\n\nI thought the service here was really good...our server came to check in on us a couple times, and once he noticed we were out of bread, he offered to bring us more. Also at one point I noticed most of the restaurant was empty and asked our server what time they closed. He was super nice and said that they were open as long as they had patrons. Awww how sweet!! \n\nOverall I'd say the food itself is only 3 stars (based purely on this one meal), but for the charming atmosphere and the attentive service, I'm bumping it up to 4!", "author": "Dianna H."}

We didn't have high expectations but we were so excited to have French food! \n\nFor my appetizer: I got the French soup and my friend got a strawberry salad. The salad had way too much cheese and was overdressed but the French soup was just right. The presentation as you can see in my photos was beautiful and the taste was exquisite but I would suggest the French soup. \n\nEntree: I got the clams and a crepe for an entree. I shouldn't have got both and decided to just chow down on the crepes and hopefully take hope the clams but they have a rule against taking seafood home so I had to force feed myself. The crepe looked like the baby of an omelette and burrito. The batter was thick, there was so much stuffed in it, and it was just not pleasing to the eye. I got the duck crepe and thought the flavors were on point and that the duck was seasoned well. The clams were very tasty and had a nice cream sauce with it. I definitely would suggest the clams! \n\nIf you have been to Paris before, this place is no comparison obviously, but for a French brunch place in SF, this place was not too shabby. Overall, the waiter was super nice and accommodating and the bistro reminded me of a cafe near the Eiffel Tower in Paris. It does bring nostalgia and I would definitely go again but would not order a crepe.", "author": "Eric Joseph D."}

Although they had 2 floors, most guests were seated on the first floor so the tables were squished together really closely. The ambiance is really nice though, definitely had an authentic French vibe with nice wall decor and a little curtain next to the entrance.\n\nWe went here for restaurant week and their menu had a lot more variety than most other participants in restaurant week. I ordered the mussels as an appetizer, duck as the main entree, and apricot tart for dessert.\nMussels: these came in a generous portion, and they were steamed in light, creamy sauce. I especially liked the wine flavor in the sauce, though I wished the sauce was a little more salty. The mussels were soft and fresh.\nDuck: Definitely my favorite of the night and my boyfriend also loved it. We both agreed that it was the best European-style duck dish we've ever had. The dish is carefully made, with a layer of soft breading-like material either over or under the duck skin (couldn't tell), and it was flavorful and buttery. The duck was super soft and juicy, and it was a very large portion. The duck was covered in a sweet, tangy sauce that I loved, and there were also small diced veggies on top. \nPeach tart: The peaches were fresh and sweet, and the tart stood out because it was very moist and buttery.\n\nService was great, the manager and the servers were really friendly and accommodating.

The only issue with the place was how close all the tables are next to each other. If it was pack, you don't really have any personal space. \n\nThey give you bread as a stater. It came out warm and crispy. I just couldn't stop eating the bread that we had 4 rounds of it. For appetizer we had the mussels, it was very flavorful and not over powering. The sauce was perfect for dipping your bread in it. For entire we ordered the C\u00f4telettes D'Agneau Roties (aka lamb chops), and duck breast(their special of the night). The lamb chop came in 3 pieces. It came out as requested middle rare and I enjoyed the meat since it was not dry or tough. The duck was just woah, very chewy, tender and season well. The best part was the fact all the food came out HOT and the temperate lasted until we finish the whole plate. Most often it comes out as luke warm in many restaurants and gets cold fast.

I stumbled across Chouchou on Groupon while I was searching for a nice place to bring my mom for her birthday lunch. It was a great deal, so I bought it. \nFrom the outside, it doesn't look like anything special, but once we walked in we found it to be quite intimate and cozy. \nWe were greeted by the only waitress in the restaurant, but she was all smiles and was always cheerful. We waited a moment for the table we wanted by the window, and were seated. \nOur first course was a beautiful salad (I can't remember it's name, but it was the first on the lunch menu) made of arugula, goat cheese, pistachios, and cherry tomatoes. The cheese was SO good and the rest of the ingredients were absolutely fresh. \nThe cheery waitress, whose name we didn't learn, came to help us with a wine choice. Neither my mom or I are very big wine snobs, and our waitress kindly pointed us to a red blend that wasn't too dry or too sweet. It was a french wine, and I can't remember the name.\nFor the second course, I ordered the beef bourguignon and my mom ordered the steak with truffle fries, turmeric aioli and blue cheese sauce. The bourguignon was TO DIE FOR. It was so rich and the flavors were layered and complex, and everything played together perfectly. The dish came with tagliatelle that tasted great swirled in together in the sauce. Whole carrots, pearl onions, mushrooms and bacon added to the pure amazingness that was this dish. \nThe steak for my moms entree was tender (even though the cut, a hanger steak, is usually quite tough) and juicy, and the blue cheese sauce gave it a wonderful tang. The turmeric aioli gave the truffle fries and exotic twist. \nFinally, we ordered the Flottante for dessert. This was a small meringue cake sitting in a creamy sauce with caramel, almonds, and strawberries. I wasn't terribly impressed with the cake, it didn't have a lot of flavor but the texture went well with the sauce. It finished the meal nicely. \nTo conclude, I have to say I made the pilgrimage from the coast to this little French bistro. The ambiance, quality and flavor of food was perfect.

The soup was a bit too sour for my taste though.\n-P.E.I. Moules Proven\u00e7ale Mussels: Very generous amount of mussels. Love the tomato broth. You can really taste it seeped within the mussels. A unique twist to the more common white wine sauce. \n-Angus Boeuf Bourguignon Braised Beef: I don't particularly like braised beef so it was just okay. The burgundy wine broth was sweet. The tagliatelli pasta was quite plain and didn't have enough/any sauce.\n-Duck Confit Wellington: I love duck and I love pastries. So this dish was perfect for me! I loved the mushroom duxelles. Very rich and fatty. The maple vinaigrette was a bit too sour for me, but it did complement the savory duck. The duck could have been more juicy and moist. Very rich dish overall.\n-Chocolate Pear Tart: The tart was very hard, but I like how they made the pear into a gelatin over the tart. How unique!\n-Overall, the food was good and they used high quality ingredients. It was a bit extreme for me though. Some dishes were too sour, too sweet, or too hard. However, it was an interesting experience and it has broadened my taste buds to the unique mixes of flavors and to different types of dishes that I haven't found anywhere else in the bay. I mean, where else can you find duck wellington? Or mussels in a tomato broth? Or a pear glazed in a gelatin form over a tart? I recommend coming to Chouchou with an open-mind!\n\nAmbiance:\n-Beautiful, dark, intimate, fancy, and formal. However, it is very cramped and you are sitting side by side with others. The lights also hang quite low and I actually hit my head sliding into my seat (haha!).\n\nLocation: \n-Right next to Forest Hill Muni Station and across the street from Laguna Honda Hospital.

I like the design of the interior very classy and original where is other french restaurant is too modern looking. special about eating french cuisine and other cuisine is that french is really about the cooking technique of the chef and together with the ambience of the restaurant. with skillful techniques of the chef and the design of the interior of the restaurant u r able to really get a feel of being in Paris and enjoying a french dish. this is a totally a different level of enjoying your course of food as they serve u your dishes one by one, one after the other. U basically can not rush thought the course of diner as if u were eating Chinese cuisine.\n\nFor appetizer we order\n1 Carpaccio De Thon   ( the tuna is just perfect not too chewy very sweet taste to it with the baby arugula very well blend in with parmigiana cheese and Truffle oil. \n2.P.E.I Moules.   ( the only draw backed of this dish is the sauce did'nt really taste any wine flavor in it. it was a little blend. very creamy I was dipping my french bread in the sauce.\n3. FoieGras over panshear pineapple ( There is really nothing to say about this dish except for Perfection.) every one of the elements in the dish came so perfect I am still tasting that flavor in my mind and mouth as it slowly trying to disappear. \n4. Escargots a L'ail   ( This dish would of been a perfect dish for me only if it was less oily )\n\nEntree\nI had order the pan shear Duck breast and my wife order Cuisse De Canard Confit Wellinglton\n( duck leg confit )for the duck breast it was very well executed the fat on the duck breast was still cooking it self even thought the dish is already sitting in front. as u all know the layer of fat suppose to continue cooking even if it is off the pan to put it easier to undrstand the layer of fat is to protect it from getting cold. so even if the outside is cold the inside is still at a cooking temperature. just to say it the duck breast was so tender and juicy. \nmy wifes duck leg confit can improve more to me I think the breading is a little too thick on the duck leg. but other than that it was a very taste dish.\nDessert for us we order the Crme Brule  I know this might sound like a easy dish to some of u but the real issue is that the Crme Brule tha my wife and I tasted was the best we had so far.\nthe vanille was not as sweet as I expected.actually it was made at the right level of sweetness for asian people like myself. this was a perfect diner to me with a perfect dessert what more can u as for. I just hope the next time we go back they can improve a little bit more with the sitting arrangement.", "author": "Tommy M."}

That's alone deserves a star! When you first walk in the place has that San Francisco house smell, which is kind of comforting but also reminded me of my grandma's house. However, as you keep walking you star to get a whiff of the excellent food that awaits you and you're instantly excited. The decor was really cute, very colorful and dainty. The waitress was really nice, she had a cute French accent which really helped transport us out of San Francisco to France haha. I was with 3 people so we were able to taste most of the menu. I ordered the mushroom ravioli which was excellent. There two big raviolis but the white cream sauce was the star of the show! It was definitely worthy of asking for another baguette of bread to dip. My friend ordered the tartare which was also yummy. It was a little fishy for my liking but still very tasty. The plating was nice as well. \n\nMoving on to entrees. I ordered the beef stew. It was served with a side of pasta noodles which confused me a little. I wasn't sure if I should pour the noodles in the stew or kind of dip as I go..lol The sauce was great, a little thick but the flavor was nice. My friends ordered the salmon and steak which I've included pictures of. They both said the plates were amazing!\n\nI'm not a big fan of dessert but we ordered the creme brulee which my friends raved about. At the end of the meal the chef came out and introduced himself and thanked us. He was very sweet! I'll definitely come back to support this nice establishment!", "author": "Jessica B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-14", "description": "For a couple of years, my mother and I kept driving by this bistro, and she said, \"one day, we should have a meal here.\"  Three weeks ago.  It all started when we decided to eat out for lunch after running some errands, and she brought up ChouChou as I was driving.  So, I pulled over to the side of the road, took out my cellphone and looked for a menu on their website.  I was in the mood for some crepes, and maybe some escargot.  Low and behold, they serve both of those dishes, so my mother and I headed over there... only to show up at around 2:00 pm, when they were about to close the kitchen.  We almost walked out of the restaurant in disappointment, when the waitress told us that the chef had time to cook an entree for us.  Thank goodness we saw the menu ahead of time, otherwise, we would've wasted too much time trying to decide before time ran out.  Before we sat down, we asked, \"are you sure?  We don't want to hold you up if you're planning to close soon.\"  She assured us that it was okay, so we accepted her offer.\n\nI quickly glanced at the menu to see if the item I saw online was listed, and sure enough it was.  So, I told her what I wanted without any hesitation.  I ordered the poulet grill\u00e9 (chicken crepe with tomatoes, red onions, and pesto), while my mother asked for the saumon grill\u00e9 (salmon crepe with red onions, fresh dill, and capers).  While we were waiting for our meals, we couldn't help but listen to the music playing in the restaurant.  My mother wanted to know the singers and the names of the songs, so I pulled out my phone and Shazamed them.  Apparently the waitress noticed what I was doing, so she cranked the volume a little higher on the stereo system in order for Shazam to do its work on my phone.  She goes to me and says, \"here, let me help you out with that\", so she took my cellphone out of my hand, and literally held it up to the speaker, and sure enough, we managed to get a couple of songs for my mother.\n\nOur food arrives, and I must say, I was not disappointed, and neither was my mother.  Our crepes were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  We've been to a couple of crepe places in the city, and although they're pretty decent, this place has just surpassed all of the other establishments we've dined at.  The crepes were so delicious that my mother was contemplating on coming back to the restaurant for their dinner service.  Just as the waitress asked us how our meals were, it gave my mother a perfect opportunity to ask her about the dinner service at the restaurant.  The waitress kindly suggested that we make a reservation, considering that some evenings are busy while others are quiet, and each week varies.  She also added that every Sunday evening they had live music; we'll have to check that out someday.\n\nWe felt bad that we showed up at precisely 30 minutes before the kitchen was scheduled to close.  The next time we plan to dine here, we'll pay close attention to the times posted for the restaurant.  Otherwise, our waitress, as well as the chef went above and beyond the call of duty, and we were eternally grateful.  We figured that if any waiter/ waitress was willing to put up with a couple of brand new customers, provide quality service, and serve delicious food, they deserve a huge tip from us.", "author": "Claudine P."}

I was hoping this compact neighborhood bistro would be the hidden nugget just waiting for moi to discover and wax about incessantly. Mais c'est pas, mon cherie. I was wooed by a three-year-old episode of \"Check Please! Bay Area\" where comedian Bob Sarlatte went on enthusiastically about how great it was and how friendly the host was. I thought it would be an ideal place to have a holiday meal with Jamie W., but Chouchou just refused to deliver the goods in a completely satisfying manner. Parts were good - especially the tarts at the very end - but the whole experience just wasn't doing a high-kicking, bloomer-exposing can-can in my palate.\n\nIt was the first time we got off at the Forest Hill MUNI station, and the restaurant is just around the bend of Dewey to the right. It was a dark, foggy Friday evening, so the place was aglow in a swath of pink and orange lights (see photo). Tables are extremely crowded together, but luckily, we were there early and didn't have to deal with awkward acrobatics getting ourselves inserted. Chouchou offers a three-course Menu Degustation for $34.95 all week but just for an hour and a half on Fridays and Saturdays. I didn't know what \"degustation\" meant and later found out I have a gustatory system...gee, does it show? Regardless, we figured we should take advantage of it since the much-praised duck confit was one of the entrees offered in the deal.\n\nFor the appetizer course, Jamie ordered the $14 Crab a la Russe, which was a fresh crab salad mixed with a macedoine of vegetables and molded into a circular shape. It was topped with a dill dressing, a couple of sheets of pastry-brick dough, and a passel of peas sprouts (see photo). Looked good, tasted bland. Mine was better but smaller, the $9 Escargots a l'Ail, which came in a little custom dish that looked like it was designed for midget deviled eggs. It consisted of butter-sauteed snails topped with shallots, garlic, and parsley (see photo). Ah yes, it was very French of me to order, but there were only a half-dozen. They were gone in seconds. Good thing the French bread was still steaming hot and the perfect accompaniment (see photo).\n\nJamie and I ordered the same entree, the aforementioned All-Natural Moulard Duck Leg Confit Wellington, which was slathered with mushrooms duxell in the skin and stuffed with saut\u00e9ed slivers of zucchinis. It was topped with wilted baby red chard and then lacquered with a maple vinaigrette and orange oil (see photo). This dish normally goes for $24. It was definitely a hearty enough portion with all the trimmings, but the duck meat itself tasted overcooked and the mushroom spread was just too liberal an amount to complement. We were both marginally disappointed by the execution. We partook of the $7 tarts for dessert, and these were not disappointing - Jamie had the very dense Triple Chocolate (see photo), while I had the comparatively superior Apricot (see photo). Voila! We ended the meal on a high point.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...sorry to say it was middling bistro fare for us despite the fussy touches...the tarts are worth stopping for though\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...definitely feels like a bit of Montmartre in here\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...pleasant\nTOTAL - 3 stars...ain't leaving for that midnight Chouchou for Georgia...I mean Forest Hill", "author": "Ed U."}

They still managed to accommodate us, even though the place was packed.\n\nThe wine list was more like an encyclopedia, but what's nice is that it wasn't just a list but rather a bit of description next to the wine.  It's always great asking a sommelier for their thoughts, but it's also nice getting a chance to just browse and try something.\n\nThe food was fantastic.  I had a french onion soup to start and my girlfriend a salad (it was quite large).  We had the filet mignon and mashed potatoes for the main, and it was perfect.

Mostly because it was recommended by a friend who knows food who lived in area a few years earlier. But, also because it superficially looks similar to other casual French bistros in the city that I enjoy. And, lastly because there are not many other French options nearby. Finally had the opportunity to visit and I likely wont return soon.\n\nLooking back, I may have misjudged the restaurant. The closest neighborhood has an older population and that was reflected in the demographics of the diners on a Friday night. Perhaps it would be a better choice if you are a senior.\n\nOtherwise, the experience didn't add up. Dinner for two (2 salads, 2 main courses, bottle of wine and one dessert) came to over $180 including tip and tax. I can think of many places in the local area and across the city where that would be better spent.\n\nThe food was unsurprising and would be passable at a lower price point; the duck special was actually fairly good. A lamb dish was less flavorful and came with an overbearing sauce. The wine choice was not a good match. The odd thing is that we got a recommendation from the server; but the server later told us that she doesn't drink wine.\n\nThe decor was a bit shabby and some of the tables were oddly arranged. Not an attractive or relaxing atmosphere. Service was also rushed. We were one of the last parties seated.

I've had fond culinary gustatory memories here so I brought my bf here for a visit. It was (unintended) 1000-point reservation on OpenTable if you were seated before 6:45pm, for your future reference.\n\nThe menu boasts one of our favorite wines: Sancerre sauvignon blanc from Loire Valley in France. We started off with the half-bottle ($35) while poring over the menu. We decided to have the Prefixe Dinner for $34.95 each:\n\nCrab & Avacado Feuillete\nComposed Salad, w/cherry tomatoes, candied walnuts\nAngus 8oz Hanger Steak, pommes frites, blue cheese sauce, turmeric aioli\nMoulard Duck leg Confit Wellington filled with mushrooms duxelle potatoes saut\u00e9ed with garlic and parsley, maple vinaigrette, orange oil\n\nThe restaurant became packed to the gunwales shortly after our food order was taken. The ma\u00eetre d pretty much ran the whole show here on a Friday night (to my surprise) with the help of one server and a bus-boy. She opened our wine, took our order, and checked on us. Maybe owing to the short staff, she forgot that I requested to have my salad without gorgonzola. \n\nFor pre-fixe menu, Chouchou portion is generous. The salad is beautifully presented. Crab & Avacado Feuillete was tasty. The Hanger Steak looks overcooked on the outside but pink in the center. Pomm frites very crunchy. Duck confit is in a thin buttery pastry wrap. It's a bit heavy but the tangy flavor gives it a kick.\n\nI prefer Cafe Claude and L'ardoise Bistro over Chouchou in terms of flavors. Chouchou seems to emphasize on beef dishes, witha hamburger, hanger steak, beef bourguignon, and filet mignon on any given night, but no coq au vin. Chouchou has what most restaurants lack in this town---their own parking lot! Pre-fixe menu is great value here. But the food is at best average.\n\nDinner for two $110", "author": "Matt Y."}

I think they deserve it for their consistent quality of food and service since my last review three years ago.  \n\nThis time I ordered the onion soup, snails, lamb chops, and crepe suzette (again).  The bread, again a great complement to dinner; as it should be.  The soup was crusted nicely with cheese and served piping hot and not over seasoned or salted.  The snails came bubbling hot with a thin parmesan dust layer coating the ramekin.  I'm used to more garlic and herbs, but perhaps the chef was following the same philosophy with not over seasoning?  This way we could taste the snail (sounds gross when I say it like that, doesn't it?). \n\nI ordered my lamb chops medium rare.  They came out on the rare side, which is what I expected, since the French seem to define medium rare this way.  The yam sauce was a bit too sweet for me and reminded me of American BBQ sauce.  I enjoyed it anyway as it was otherwise perfectly prepared and cooked; and our server suggested a nice French wine that paired well to balance the sweetness of the yam sauce.  The accompanying paper-thin fried yam \"chips/crisps\" flavored with pancetta was really tasty. The string beans broke with a satisfying snap in my mouth!  \n\nMy wife ordered the prix-fixed menu with a goat cheese green salad, beef bourguignon, and mixed fruit tart.  All excellent.  The goat cheese went really well with the sliced strawberries.  Where they got such sweet strawberries in November, I'll never know.  I know one reviewer thought there wasn't enough dressing.  I suppose it could use a little more, but we're back to the \"non-over seasoning\" thing again.  \n\nI couldn't resist the crepes suzette, since the chef had already prepared it twice in the middle of the dining room.  That's the point, isn't it?  To up-sell the dessert.  The Grand Marnier really intensifies the orange sauce.  I think the chef enjoys the flamb\u00e9 a little too much, as the flames went higher than his head!  \n\nAlthough my menu choices were mostly clich\u00e9, I thoroughly enjoyed my guilty pleasure of a small slice of Parisian life.", "author": "Stephen F."}

When Chef Michaels called personally(!) to confirm our reservation, I told him it was for my daughter's birthday and that she loves the French onion soup, he invited her to tour the kitchen prior to opening to see how a kitchen operates.  Hopefully Chef Michaels won't be mad that I mentioned this (Diners: don't all go rushing to ask for a tour!), but he and his sous-chef went out their way to make someone's day really special.  That says a lot about the level of attentiveness which carries over to food preparation as well.\n\nSo about the food:  with a our large group, many appetizers and entrees were sampled with rave reviews from everyone - onion soup, mussels, escargot, crab salad (a lot of crab), scallops, filet mignon (huge piece), beef bourguignon, hangar steak (smaller than filet mignon), filet of sole (my brother orders this whenever possible & he gave a thumbs-up), duck on menu, duck special, and lamb cassoulet special.  Portion sizes were ample and presentation was beautiful.  We brought our own birthday cake so didn't try the desserts but we saw what other diners ordered & desserts looked delicious.

I've passed by several times and noticed crowds of people waiting.  \n\nOur reservation was scheduled for Sunday, June 6 at 7pm.  As we finished up at the Union Street Festival early, I called to see if we could change our reservations to 6:30pm where a male picked up the phone and rudely told me with attitude that he'll try but there would be no guarantees because they were expecting many people at 6:30pm and quite honestly, our 7pm reservation might be late.   As 2 friends and I strolled in around 6:30pm, there were at least 3 tables available and we were seated right away.\n\nFOOD:\n*Escargots \"a la Bouguignonne\" - I was quite disappointed in this dish.  I didn't know what \"a la Bouguignonne\" meant but I figured it was the escargots that would be in the shells.  Instead this dish did not look appetizing as purple stuff (I don't even know what it was) was spread around the bone marrow which contained pieces of escargots.  It looked gross... http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=YOChRzTztTL_KooP9wEtSQ&select=Jp5SiMX7cfNg5TrjBpYTZQ  \n\n*Steamed Mussels Marinieres - YUM!  This was my favorite dish!  The mussels are available to order as an appetizer or an entr\u00e9e.  You'll find yourself using pieces of bread to soak up the creamy wine broth...a MUST TRY!!\n\n*French Onion Soup - The soup was okay.  I think the broth wasn't rich enough but the crouton/bread and the cheese on the top layer was delicious.\n\n*Rack of Lamb - I order medium rare but the meat came out medium to medium well.  The lamb lacked flavoring and juiciness.  I'm a fan of rack of lamb and if I did return, I would pass on ordering the lamb.\n\n*Dessert tarts - As all 3 of us did Dine About Town, your meal comes with a tart.  As we've read on Yelp that Chouchou is known for their delicious tarts, we tried the chocolate pear, chocolate walnut, and chocolate almond tarts.  I was disappointed.  The tarts were only okay.  The chocolate taste was lost in the almond and walnut tarts, as the nuts overpowered it.\n\n**NOTE: Although we didn't order the scallops, they looked delicious as people around me ordered them.  They were big!\n\nETC.\nThe waitress seemed like the only friendly person there.  I don't recall any of the workers even cracking a smile.  The tables seem too close together and the table next to ours slid right ours when the husband attempted to move theirs so his wife could get out.  The bathroom (unisex) is gross!  You would think they would maintain a nicer bathroom.  \n\nPARKING:\nThere is an available lot next to the restaurant, however I believe it's shared with two other restaurants on that block.

Let me just start right off the bat with.... service was excruciatingly slow. There was a lot of waiting in between getting water, our bottle of wine, getting our food, getting our bill, and having our card charged.    We could only surmise AND hope that due to the Dine About Towners, they were understaffed or perhaps the kitchen just wasn't prepared for such great capacity of orders. Anyways...\n\nWe ordered mussels, french onion soup, and crab avocado salad for appetizers. The mussels appetizer could've very well been considered an entree because it came in a whopping huge bowl with mussels spilling over the top, but only decent tasting, some pieces lacked flavor. The crab avocado salad was good, generous blending of both main ingredients, neither overbearing. The french onion soup was only lukewarm with the cheese barely melting. I don't think any of us were too disappointed since we were all pretty famish by the time our appetizers finally arrived.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the Crusted Salmon, Hangar Steak with fries was the most popular item ordered in our group, and I personally got the Duck Confit. This was when the Great Disappointment started..\n\n- Crusted Salmon-- overcooked, tough on the edges, and the dill sauce was rather peculiar, probably more of an acquired taste.\n\n- Hangar Steak-- the medium well was overly well done, came out all -around-inside- and out brown. And on the other end, the medium rare came out well... RARE.  The insides were still red and at first cut, red juice came spewing out. And as if it couldn't get any worse, one of the steaks NEVER came out. After persistent friendly questioning about one of the missing steak entree, they finally brought it out when the rest of the party was trying hard to suppress- stomach the food.\n\n+Duck Confit- Luckily for me, I absolutely loved my entree. The skin was a crunchy and marinated to perfection, the meat was tender and succulent.  After passing around bits and pieces of our entrees to each other, we all hands down agreed that mine was by far the most tasty. \n\nFor dessert, we opted for the chocolate mousse and creme brulee. The mousse was NOT light and fluffy, but rather really rich and thick. Creme brulee.. well you can't really go wrong with any sort of brulee...\n\nFor what it was worth, our server did apologize profusely for the delayed entree and he even gave us glasses of wine on the house. This made the mandatory 18 percent gratuity slapped onto our bill more bearable. The bill came out to about 350 dollar, we paid and left feeling somewhat robbed.", "author": "Ada C."}

Our reservation was at 7:30 and I arrived a few minutes early and was promptly seated. Good start but the positive experience ends there.\n\nThey were very busy but in some sense that is part of the charm of this place. However, once seated, we waited and waited and waited - no waiter, no water, no bread, no drink order. Finally, after nearly 35 minutes I got up, crossed the room, and tapped the waiter, who was at the counter, on the shoulder. He sent someone else over and we gave him our entire order, including two glasses of wine.\n\nAfter that we waited again, at least twenty more minutes - still no water, no bread, no wine. In frustration this time I actually waved my empty wine glass in the air until I caught the original waiter's eye. Waiter #2 came by shortly thereafter and poured our wine with, I couldn't believe it, a wee bit of an attitude. Even though the place was abuzz with busboys we still had no water, no bread. Finally, shortly after the wine was delivered, bread and water came for the first time - about an hour into our visit.\n\nWe had the set menu: the french onion soup was quite good, the mussels were fine - portions were quite generous. My date had the hangar steak, which was very tough but medium, as requested. I couldn't chew it. I had the beef stew - it was just okay. It only had two skinny little carrots in it. We had to ask a busboy for our dessert. We both had the chocolate mousse, which was good, very rich.\n\nWe never had a refill of water again until we asked. Nor were we offered more wine, which I actually would have liked had I been offered one. As the evening wore on several parties left but tables remained uncleared for long periods - there was no turnover. We were never offered coffee. Our dishes between courses sat and sat. We finally realized we would never get the bill if we didn't ask. My boyfriend, who is the most patient man in the world left an insulting tip on our $100++ check for two people.

We arrived at the time of our reservation and we are offered our choice of a couple of tables, but basically were left to seat ourselves. We took our table and then were ignored for about 10 minutes. Another couple arrived and they were seated and promptly given menus. The waiter eventually glanced in our direction and whispered to another staff member to bring us menus. Another 10 minutes and he finally came to take our order. When the appetizers finally arrived 15 minutes later, he said he would bring bread. I was almost done with my salad when I finally got the attention of another staff member and asked for the bread.\n\nThe restaurant was now full and a party of 4, including a man in a wheelchair, were standing around waiting for a table. There was really no room for them and they positioned the man in the wheelchair within 2 feet our table with him left staring at us while we tried to eat. It was awkward, uncomfortable, and unpleasant.\n\nWe never saw our waiter again for the entire night. Another 20 minutes passed before our entrees were brought by a different server. My filet mignon, which was supposed to be medium rare, was extremely under cooked. I told the server and he argued with me that it WAS medium rare. It was dark red all the way through, not the cool red center that it should be. He finally took it to be cooked more. When it came back it was still not quite medium rare, but closer. Overall the food was bland and uninspired. The service was deplorable! Besides the ridiculously slow service, lack of follow through, and rude wait staff, not once was my husband's iced tea refilled. No one ever asked if I wanted another glass of wine.\n\nI was really looking forward to eating here because friends have said it's a great restaurant. Based on my experience tonight, I don't see how.

THIS is not important - for the realists, these things happen.\n\nAll that matters is the reaction, accountability, and response.  This old haunt of ours changed hands, and the new ownership is profoundly dedicated, and nothing but committed, to creating wonderful food and experiences for it's guests.\n\nWe started with a few Kir Royals, both got Onion Soup (traditional, not overly American - complex, not overly sweet, using all the right onions.  The Steak Tartare was traditional, and delicious.  The frites were also delicious.  We got also got a tasty Burgundy for along the way. =)\n\nI was curious about a new menu item, and got the Mushroom Souffle. This is where the problem arose: the souffle obviously had an extreme amount of some sand or grit in it.  I am just a man who knows what he knows, and I am never angry or contentious (nor disappointed) when I have to send something back to be cooked right or re-heated.  I note that restaurant owners and servers are so poorly educated or skilled in how to handle these moments, which honestly should pass with amicable mutual respect and low key accountability.  The mushrooms or morels in the souffle weren't washed, there was obvious sand, oh well. Honestly, it could have been blended egg shell or something.  \n\nI told the server. The server didn't make justifications, excuses, or as so often happens, defensively acts out at me, suggesting I don't know what I am talking about.  The server said, \"Sorry, I will grab the chef\", Chef comes out, obseqious, apologetic, and totally deferential without knowing or understanding the situation - totally accountable before even knowing I was \"full of it\".  He was THE BEST. We chatted for a bit about the change of ownership, his views and missions, passion with food....\n\nAlso about his cultural shift from New York to here. That's got to be wild! Hope you are hanging in there, sir!\n\nBut his response was everything that is supposed to happen in food service, and never does. He took the souffle to the kitchen, tasted it, came back out and confirmed that it was absolutely wrong, and then preceded to regale us with a couple complimentary sides that were delicious... it was a bit over the top, and we couldn't finish it all, but it was such a grand and rare classy gesture.  I wish I could offer more than a review.  \n\nWhen stuff like this happens, I don't care at all.  I linger, I am La Flanuer - so I don't really have anywhere to go when I am with my love, eating, and drinking. =)  I just deplore when people become unskilled, fall over themselves, act insecure, over-apologize... or worse, don't take accountability, don't taste the food I suggested was wrong or cooked improperly, and then becomes reactive and rude, blaming me, the guest.  I know a lot of guests are idiot and full of it, but until you know for sure you have to be calm, patient, and respectful.\n\nThe majority of San Francisco's fine dining establishments and other eateries could learn a lot from this restaurant's staff, and chef.  It is vital to pe consistent and do the best you can.... but it is also the most extreme of responsibilities to be transparent, accountable, and have the professional confidence, pride, and self-respect to admit failure or mistake.  When you can be that humble, you will only learn and grow.\n\nI can't believe how extraordinary experience we had here, with the new ownership.

From my steak + frites to the dinner salad to the bread to the side artichokes + impressively delicious dessert menu (we ordered bananas flambe and the banana split) ... I was thoroughly impressed as were my 3 dining mates. It stops here, we all sadly agreed.\n\nI was surprised service was so lacking, based on reviews here and what we expected to pay: a pretty penny. We were seated 20mins late past our reservation on a busy Sat eve; no problem there, we were very patient w/them and waited quietly. We just figured the service would be great once we sat. From beginning to end, service was just ... lazy. Were we bothering them? We had to ask for water 2 or 3x. Our apps plates weren't cleared when they brought our entrees. He attempted to put our entrees down on the table along w/dirty apps plates - there was no room  for them- we ended up practically busing our own table and piling our plates for him - utensils landing on the floor - absolute mayhem. ?!?! Did no other server or bus boy or even the manager see the commotion in such a small, intimate space? So odd.

Chou Chou is doing false advertising with their deal.  They advertised you are getting an $101.90 value for $69.  For $69, you get 2 entrees, 2 glass of house wine, and 1shared dessert.

The dressing was just squirted on top and it tasted like mayonnaise \n- Brussel sprouts: meh. They were already yellow but weren't cooked all the way. Very garlicky though\n- Chocolate almond tart: the tart was crumbly and dry. And they used wayyy to much apricot glaze on top.

Went to this restaurant last night for the $40 prix fixe dinner.\n\nFor the appetizer, I ordered the crab salad. It was light and fresh with avocado and minimal seasoning. Highly recommend for those who want something small and unique. The puff pastry on the side was mediocre at best, but without it the dish would be missing a crunch. My friend ordered the arugula salad. It was very average and the chef probably forgot the dressing...the salad was dry and tasteless, which we originally thought was \"normal\" until we asked the waitress. By that time, we already tried several bites to understand why this is even on any menu. I do not recommend this salad. If you do, please ask for dressing immediately, not like us.\n\nFor the entree, I ordered the duck leg. Amazing dish!!! Best dish of the night! The sauce was absolutely perfect, the right amount of tanginess and sweetness. The duck was easy to chew and had a puff pastry covering that was just at the right consistency. Unfortunately for my friend, he ordered the hanger steak. Bad mistake for him again...the steak was so difficult to chew and lacked flavor. The fries next to the steak were..meh...\n\nFor the dessert, my friend was hoping to at least be pleasantly surprised (and find worth in spending $40...). We both ordered the mixed fruit tart, stupidly thinking the fruit would be fresh fruit. The tart came and it was very thin and...warm, almost hot (we thought the fruit tart would be chilled). It's topped with canned fruit. A serious disappointment for my friend.\n\nOverall, my friend would probably give this place three stars. His food was average. And the restaurant was a bit too cozy. There was minimal space in between tables so all the conversations could be heard (in addition to a lot of \"butt-kicking\" the tables whenever someone gets up).\n\nI gave four because the duck entree was absolutely decadent! The customer service was also really good. They immediately seated us and gave us just enough attention. The only bad thing I could mention about service was there was one waiter who tended to touch the food with his fingers...a plate will be set down and his fingers will touch the food on the plate.

I've been here for Dine About town previously, but I recently came here again and found they have a Dine-About-Chouchou menu, which is just about the same thing as Dine About Town. This is a three-course meal for $39.95. I ordered the P.E.I mussels for appetizer, which is cooked in a white wine sauce with garlic, shallots, parsley, and cream. The broth is delicious and the goes so well with the complimentary French bread. They give you a generous portion also! I ordered the salmon entree, which is pan seared and comes with sauteed artichoke hearts, cherry tomatoes, and covered in a dill cream sauce. The salmon was tender and not overcooked, but there was too much creamy dill sauce. I probably should have just asked for a little on the side. i ordered this because the sauce is not a typical sauce I would usually find served over salmon. It's unique, but the sauce makes it a little heavier. For dessert, the chocolate pear tart is the way to go! Not too sweet and the pear on top adds great yet subtle flavor. The creme brulee is also good, but not too outstanding as many restaurants make good creme brulee. Ok, now for the minus points...the bill. They charged us incorrectly (added an extra Dine-About-Chouchou order to the bill). We asked them to fix it, which they did, but the second bill didn't add up as well. After adding up the food items, it did not add up to the food subtotal. Strange.

Served with shallots, garlic and parsley in a cream and white wine sauce, they weren't bad, but I remember them tasting a lot better the first time.\n\nAs for my entree, I thought the salmon missed.  It's cool how it was wrapped and cooked in a parchment pouch, but the fish was overdone and dry on the ends/edges.  The taste was okay...once I got rid of the six to eight sprigs of thyme.  I'm no professional chef, but I'm sure they could have used less; it was almost like having steamed thyme with salmon seasoning.  At least the fingerling potatoes and yam puree were decent.\n\nThe creme brulee at the end of the meal was pretty solid, but I wonder how it would have fared had there been vanilla beans thrown in.

In a word, it's charming, especially on a Friday or Saturday night, when it's busy and fun.\n\nThe food is always good, often awesome.  Everything I've had -- over three visits -- is well prepared, well presented and very satisfying.  La Menu is a good choice, and very reasonably priced for what you get.  Portions are good, sauces are subtle and beautiful, combinations are sometimes unexpected yet well-chosen.  Escargot are excellent.  On my last visit, I had salmon perfectly roasted, on a bed of tender artichoke leaves, with a very light cream-and-dill sauce, and I loved it.  The salad was fresh crab and delightful. They have a white bordeaux wine by the glass that is superb.  Dessert was a very delicious mixed-fruit tart.\n\nThe space is narrow and intimate, yet not overly noisy.  Lighting is good in most areas.  But there are a few things that keep it from being one of my five-star spots.  Service is rather variable, in a rather French way...I find myself often waiting for five or ten minutes to get a glass of wine, or for the next course to arrive, especially on the busy weekend evenings.  When you have the place to yourself (like early on a Tuesday night), the service is very good, of course...and the restaurant feels quiet, and not as much fun.\n\nIf you want an intimate evening for two, the upstairs area is less busy with smaller tables and soft lighting.  However service upstairs is not as prompt as downstairs, although the staff clear plates and refill water promptly.  And the decor is a little too classic, with exposed conduits, bundles of cables, worn paint on the railings.  Yet it still feels romantic, perhaps even more so, in a Parisian kind of way.\n\nSuch a classic bistro.  If you want a nice relaxed French dining experience, this is a fine spot.  Just head upstairs, order a bottle of wine to start, converse and touch hands, enjoy the food, like the French.  You won't be disappointed.", "author": "Tom C."}

It is a very small restaurant inside. They do have some small tables upstairs but they were not occupied and I do not know if they actually serve up there or is it just for looks to typify cafes in France. They do take reservations through Open table. I happened to book it during a 1,000 point reservation special. ;-) Yay to me!\n\nThey do have a prix-fixe menu and I wanted to sample appetizers, main course, and dessert so that was the route that I took. I ordered the crab salad appetizer, duck confit, and the floating island. \n\nThe Crab salad was nicely presented with some toasted french bread and some greens. Mixed into the crab was some fresh young peas and carrots that were al dente. I liked it but some of my dining companions did not. \n\nFor the main course, the duck leg looked so yummy. I love duck so I was hoping that this would be a great dish. Unfortunately, the presentation was great but the taste was not. After taking my first bite, my tongue was immediately greeted by a saltiness that I have not experienced in a long time. I definitely was not expecting this in my dish. The last time I had tasted duck this salty was when I had some preserved and salted duck leg. I can tell you that I am not a fan of salty foods. Several other compatriots with me voiced the same sentiment. Man, I was really disappointed. 2 glasses of water later, my tongue was finally back to normal. \n\nHere comes dessert. From all of the choices, I wanted something relatively light. The floating island consisted of an island of meringue floating on top of cream and caramel. The dessert seemed to be the extra credit on the assignment that made me happy again. \n\nService was great as the lone waitress/hostess took care of our large party without any issues. She was extremely friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable of the menu items. Hopefully, they will take this constructive criticism and fix the saltiness of their dishes. Not only was my duck confit salty but the hangar steak was also salty as noted by my companions.\n\nCrab salad and floating island - thumbs up\nduck confit - thumbs down", "author": "Joe K."}

Most likely due to Dine About Town.  The wait wasn't too bad, as we just hung out at the bar, chatting away.  Our table was ready after awhile on the second level. \n\nThe Dine About Town menu was more of a small scale version of their regular menu.  Each course had an option of 4 choice to choose from. Not bad really.  We all decided to do the Dine About Town menu selections, plus 2 orders of the foie gras torchon. \n\nThe foie gras torchon was simply heaven on a plate.  Served with toasted brioche and berry compote, sweet and fat were meld into one.  Tasty.  The foie gras itself was tasty to eat by itself.  As my dinner companions couldn't finish the remaining portions, I scooped it all up. Hey, gotta have my foie gras fixin' before it's banned. \n\nNext, first course, though really second.  My choice was the crab a la russe with pea shoot salad.  More like a crab meat salad.  They use real crab meat mixed with vegetables.  The vegetables added the nice crunch to the salad. \n\nDuck leg Confit Wellington filled with mushrooms was my main. Another successful dish for me.  The duck meat fell off the bone, nice and tender.  I didn't really care for the breaded portion, but the mushrooms and duck meat worked well.\n\nI finished my meal with the chocolate pear tart.  Yum is all I could say, as I was stuffing my mouth.  What great way to end a meal. Chocolate and sweet.\n\nStuffed on good food, two bottles of wine, we all decided that we would come back again.

The P.E.I. Mussels Marinieres were good - the white wine sauce goes great with bread.   My Angus Hangar Steak was unspectacular - a small, not especially tender piece of meat.  The accompanying Pomme Frites were crispy and fresh with a good bleu cheese sauce.

The Vanilla Cr\u00e8me Brulee was delicious - light on the vanilla and proper consistency.   A friend got one of their fresh tarts, and it was good, as well.\n\nIn hindsight, I think ordering straight off the menu rather than prix fixe Dine-About-Town menu would have been a better strategy.  The manager (or owner?) was particularly chatty to the Frenchy with us, and all the staff was friendly.

The bread on the table was toasted which I find totally un-French. I ordered Ile Flottante for dessert - just awful. The creme anglaise tasted like eggs and the meringue was dry. Too few wine by the glass choices (and no carafes, we were told) - not everyone can handle a bottle. The service, however, was EXCELLENT. Attentive, polite, caring. But I won't be back unless the food improves.", "author": "Sara G."}

I bought it after looking for something nice and fun for my mother and I to do while she's visiting, and I definitely my expectations blown away. \nAmbiance is beautiful, simple, cozy. Lighting was low enough to be romantic and flattering, but things like splashes of light against a bright green wall gave it an energetic punch. Music was subtle and unoffensive, some Edith Piaf and jazz. \nThe gentleman that served us for the evening (Michaels, if I'm remembering correctly) was hospitable, clever, and warm. \nThe bread came out HOT, the butter soft. Something so simple is sooo gratifying. \nEverything that I read on the menu sounded heavenly, but that's French cuisine for you... slather any meat or vegetable in buttery sauce cooked to perfection and your mouth will be happy. This is definitely a rich food, fine dining experience, and it's worth every calorie. \nI had the Crevettes (Shrimp) over a cheesy polenta and string beans. They didnt scrimp on the shrimp ;) and the polenta was like savory pudding. Delicious.\nMy mother got the panko salmon with artichokes and dill cream sauce, it was downright velvety.\nMy boyfriend got the steak special, with truffle potatoes and asparagus... freaking phenomenal. It was like how they say you can tell the food is good because no one is talking :) We were smiling, chewing, content little piglets. Creme Brulee to top it off felt like indulging in one of those 7 deadly sins!\nI have to say that being able to choose ANY entree with the Groupon for my mother and I was really great, I felt spoiled to be able to pick any of the item's listed before me. \nExcellent dining experience, will definitely recommend and revisit.", "author": "Chelsea V."}

And I feel like they have know about the problem and not wanting to fix the booth. I wave down whom I thought is the server but is end up to be the owner. And surely look like he don't give a damn. Did not apologize or anything for what has happen. Even while I was telling him about the booth his eyes was elsewhere, with no direct contact. Rude. But our server she was so sweet.

You can taste a hint of flowers. Maybe flower petals of some sort? For food we did a combination of DAT and the regular menu.\n\nFrom the DAT menu:\n* French onion soup - Tasted really good and a bit cheesy. I was tempted to order another one\n* Smoked salmon - Cooked well, fresh, the dressing taste good.\n* Vanilla Creme Brulee - Pretty good but I think I've had better, more richer taste\n\nFrom the regular menu:\n* Veal chops - Certain parts of the meat was tender. The areas that were tough to work on was near the bone. It was cooked medium rare which was right (as requested). Though, I've spent most of my time working out my index fingers and arms just to cut this thing. After that night, I sure got enough forearm, wrist, grip strength training with the fork and knife! The juice the meat let out was good. I liked it with my potatoes and complimentary bread.\n\nThe place started getting crowded later on. What really bothered me was their door. They don't have a doorstop or some hydraulic spring for the door. I was sitting next to the door and believe me, every time that door opened a gush of cold wind came in. The customers that come don't realize it isn't closed completely, too.\n\nThe waiters are pretty attentive and nice. I think they knew about my seating area and the door. They surprised me by giving me a special treat when I got my check. I received a complimentary slice of their mandarin orange chocolate tart. +1 on that to them. Wow that tart is very chocolatey!!

Since it was our last dinner before I moved away to lovely Corvallis and he majorly fucked up, we decided to go all out and order half the things on the menu. Unfortunately it was not money well spent and everything was horrible. I should've known it wouldn't be very good. We called for a last minute reservation and they said the restaurant had plenty of seats and then when we arrived, I realized I have driven past this place hundreds of times and never noticed it. Now I know why. \n\nThoughts that went through my head while dining at Chouchou:\n\n\"Are they really blasting ghettobeats right now?\" \n\" I think the bread might be the best part of dinner\"\n\"These plates look sooo tacky\" \n\"Why aren't there any waiters?\" \n\"I can't believe I have to season my own food.\" \n\"I can't believe I'm seasoning the butter.\" \n\"The restaurant is packed. How did they trick all these schmucks into dining here?\" \n\"Elephant Bar may be better than this\"\n\"For a place in such an obscure area, it sure is decorated exactly like a tourist trap.\" \n\nThe seats were packed into the perimeter of the restaurant but the middle of it was really wide and empty. My bf ordered a cheese plate and they never told us what cheeses they were. The table next to us also had the same experience and they asked the hostess what cheeses they were eating. She brought out a notepad with words scrawled across it and she gave very vague descriptions of them. I hate when the staff have no knowledge on the food being served. There also weren't any waiters and our water was rarely refilled. \n\nAt the end of the night, we asked them to call us a taxi.

Bay Area. \n\nOn Sunday, 6.6.10, I finally had the opportunity to give it a try.  My friends and I arrived a little early for our 7 PM reservations and were promptly seated.\n\nFOOD:\n*Mussels (App - $8): YUMMY! The mussels were huge, tender, and sweet. The shallots, garlic, parsley, cream and white wine sauce was rich, savory, and garlicky. There was just enough sauce for bread dipping too!\n\n*Escargot ($9): Ehhh, although the escargot itself was tender and sweet, the accompanying sauce was awful. The red wine had tarnished the garlic and turned it into a funky purple color which looked very unappetizing. The garlic was burnt which made the sauce very bitter. \n\n*Foie gras ($15): It was ok. The foie gras was savory, fatty, and went down like buttah. However, the ACME walnut bread was too heavy and dense for the foie gras, almost to the point the richness got lost in the bread. \n\n*DAT MENU ($34.95):\n-French Onion Soup: It was meh. The best part was the toasted crouton w/ swiss cheese which was crunchy, savory, and creamy. The broth itself was flavorless and missing all the richness from beef bones. It also had a very sour finish which lingered in my mouth. \n\n-Rack of Lamb w/ Truffle Toast: Blah! We all requested our lamb cooked medium rare and it came out well-done. It was dry, chewy, and completely unseasoned. There was just sprinkles of the Normande Sauce (broth w/ cream) which did nothing for the lamb. Sadly, the best part of the dish was the toast slathered w/ truffle oil which was crunchy, buttery, and decadent. \n\n-Pear Tart: Everyone seems to rave about Chouchou's tarts and I thought it was just ok. My tart was actually a chocolate tart with 3 slices of pear; hardly a \"pear\" tart. The crust was crunchy and buttery and the chocolate center which something between a mousse and a ganache; it was rich and velvety but had something grainy in it--cocoa nibs?\n\nSERVICE:\nIt if weren't for our waitress who was a total sweetheart, I would have bumped down the rating to 2 STARS. She was very friendly, prompt, and basically ran the front of the house herself. The male waiters are downright rude and pretentious. When we walked in, one of the waiters (shaggy blonde hair) just looked at us, gave a slight eye roll, and walked away. Umm, ok?\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nI wasn't too impressed with the d\u00e9cor; it seemed more like a Habana-Type Caf\u00e9 w/ funky color walls, ceiling fan, etc. The only \"French\" accents were the artwork on the walls. It definitely looks a lot better in pictures.  There's seating for about 35 people and tables are a little cramped.  \n\nIf you're looking for delectable French food at affordable prices, awesome service w/ SEXY French accents, I highly recommend Chez Papa Bistrot or Restaurant Decriox instead!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I remember both to be solid tasting and generous. \n\nI can only recall what I ordered, which was a rack of meat with french toast. It was super rich and very, very good. Definitely not something I can eat on a daily basis and still maintain my zaftig physique. After the first two courses, I was very full but the triple chocolate tart still sounded soo good that we decided to order it. In our heads, we thought it was going to be easy to eat since we usually finish our desserts quickly, but this one was different.

It's my turn to plan our anniversary (since the boy planned a great Valentine's Day in Hong Kong, including fireworks over Causeway Bay for Chinese New Year), and given that I just spent nearly $200 on stuff to upgrade my turtle's digs (she is spoiled, I know this for a fact), I thought I would use this handy restaurant.com coupon I bought a few months ago. \n\nThey have their own parking lot, which is helpful, except for when it's full (which it was, when we arrived), so we found street parking in front of a house a few feet away. Parking is not an issue here, actually. I made reservations, so they seated us right by the window. They have this genius thing that blocks wind from that table whenever someone comes in (It's not really that novel, but some restaurants lack it when it's really quite necessary in SF, so I thought I would mention it.). I'm really glad I made reservations, as the restaurant wasn't quite full, but we really had the best seats in the house, being right next to the window and able to watch the cars pass in the Laguna Honda/Dewey intersection. \n\nWe ordered the mushroom tart and the tuna tartare to start with, and the scallops and the pork chop for our main. We had this great English guy serve us, and we asked him for some wine pairings with each dish. He was completely right on. Each wine pairing did precisely what it was supposed to do, which was bring out certain flavors in each dish. Because I didn't order the wine myself, I don't remember what each wine was, but if you happen to get an English guy, have him make the pairings for you, and you won't be disappointed. \n\nDear mushroom tart, you've made me remember how much I missed porcinis. The crust was flaky, the mushrooms just right, and the spring onions sprinkled on top really sealed the deal. I had some of the tuna tartare, and it was equally delicious; they served it with a taro chip that really completed it. It was very fresh.\n\nThose scallops that I had set the bar for every scallop dish I will ever order in the future. Perfectly cooked, good flavors, everything just works very well together. The cheese was amazing, the lobster sauce not overpowering, everything was like a delicious symphony in my mouth. My date didn't really like figs, but with the pork chops, he was sold. We added on some potatoes gratin, which used really delicious gruyere, and were just rightly \"undercooked.\" We thought it was on purpose until we tried it again three minutes later and the whole piece was cooked just right. I think you're not supposed to eat the gratin right when they set it down...\n\nWe closed it up with some isle flotante (delicious creme anglaise and meringues brought me some delicious memories of baking with my grandma) and the creme brulee (in which my date couldn't stop praising the custard) and we were treated to some Kir Royale with our dessert. \n\nOur server was amazing. He knew the food and wine selection well enough to give us spot on pairings, and he was sociable and hilarious to boot! He speaks Chinese quite well, which I assume impresses his clientele quite a bit (there were a lot of Chinese people in this place!) and he also chased after us when we left the restaurant without saying a proper goodbye, as he was fiddling with the register when we got up to leave. We got some nice, hearty hugs from him and left feeling quite important.\n\nWhat a delicious, magnificent experience. I will be back.", "author": "Angeline P."}

I was hoping to get some of my last foie gras fixes at dinner.  When I asked the waiter, he rudely said we are not allowed to serve foie gras anymore.  I was like, uh, doesn't that law happen July 1?  He looked at me like I was stupid, sniffed and said no it is outlawed.  Then I heard him speaking in French about me to the other waitress in the corner.  SUPER RUDE.\n\nMy mom ordered \"Composed Mixed Greens Salad\", which sounded yummy in theory with chard, mixed greens, arugula, strawberries, goat cheese, etc.  However, she couldn't eat half of the leaves because they were old/yellowed or rotting.  We brought this to the attention of the server when he cleared the plates (and asked if she was finished because there was a large pile of lettuce leaves still on her plate) and he just said oh and walked away.  We didn't make a big deal about it since I already wasn't too pleased with the wait staff and remembered that another yelper that had complained about their food ended up getting ignored by the servers all night.\n\nI had the Crab and avocado Feuillete and it was just ok, not worth the $12 a la carte price.  \n\nMy parents both had had the hangar steak, which they both thought was ok, nothing exceptional.  I had the mussels, which were just ok too.

My boyfriend and I ordered these as appetizers because we love scallops. The dish came out with 4 or 6 large scallops in a pool of rich, buttery sauce. But, get this. The scallops were sitting on a huge mound of soggy lettuce. Excuse me but who eats soggy lettuce? And for that matter, why would you serve it with scallops?! The dish was pretty good but one bite of the lettuce had me gagging. The texture is extremely disgusting. In addition, many of the scallops had sand in them. \n- Tuna Tartare. Again. Nothing special. I've had much better. \n\nEntrees:\n- You and Me (lamb or pork?). Not memorable. I only remember the cute carrots that came with the dish. \n- Halibut. Again, nothing to write home about. Cute carrots. The sauce was pretty much the same as the scallop dish. \n\nI really wish I ordered the mushroom souffle instead of trying new dishes because the souffle was delicious last time!

Early this week, I made a Saturday early dinner reservation for the family. My brother commented that we haven't been here in about five years. Has it really been THAT long? By coincidence (no, I'm not easily influenced by PBS programming for my dining choices), this week's Check Please Bay Area featured Bob Sarlatte's choice of Chouchou. When the host handed us the menus, my first reaction was, \"What happened to this place? Where's the cassoulet? Where's the flat bread?\" After regaining my senses, I ordered the following for our party of five: \nAppetizers: \na) Wild Mushroom Tart (2 - shared) - Not knowing the sizing for this and knowing my family's love for fungii, two orders seemed very logical. With an assortment of various mushrooms cooked in a strong wine sauce, it was a nice contrast in flavors (crust - crunchy and buttery, sauce - creamy), garnished with two small prosciutto rolls. \nb) Steamed Mussels with Pomme Frites (entree size - shared) - Served in a large bowl, the mussels were above average in size and very meaty. We literally ran out of table space due to the plate/bowl sizes. My uncle was surprised that such large mussels held not even a hint of sand (a plus). (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpuKzQh5d6veDB-M9qU6Fw?select=KOmQA6eQf4FLo6YyTMgYYw) \n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpuKzQh5d6veDB-M9qU6Fw?select=WPacB4k-wDuLc1CesGqVpw) \nc) Onion Soup with Swiss Cheese (shared by parents) - As a child, one of my first food love was gooey cheese from pizzas and lasagna. Stealing a few bites of this brought back pleasant childhood memories. The onions were plentiful and flavorful. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ymPGcr0AW2mjEgvCXZq0-Q?select=vXN4aL2I6Ezyd6HJdMH9Yw) \nEntree: \nd) Rack of Lamb (Medium rare) - Two thick racks (2 bone per rack) done medium rare as ordered with vegetables and a small potato cake. Tasty and a nice change to the beef and pork options.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpuKzQh5d6veDB-M9qU6Fw?select=MtlEbl5WePwIxAXyFWu5Zw) \nDesserts (shared) \ne) Strawberry Bruschetta - Fresh strawberries served on top of a savory toasted bread with a light sauce. Refreshing and a nice contrast in flavors. \nf) Chocolate Pear Tart - Dense chocolate tart with pear slices infused within the topping. Like the differing taste of the pear (light) and chocolate (rich and creamy). \n\nOverall, everyone was satisfied with their meals. My father gave me one of his scallops which was seared brown on top and tender chewy below. There were three other tables dining when we arrived, but the restaurant was packed by the time we left. Since we sat near the front door, I noticed that the chef and host were hugging or shaking hands with everyone who came in, clear evidence that most were regulars here. Given the food and atmosphere, I can see why.", "author": "Mike C."}

UGH.\n\nWhen we first arrived, we were awkwardly standing in the tiny door way for a few minutes waiting for someone to seat us/ set up a table. It wasn't busy at all, there were about 4 other tables. The beginning of our dinner was nice. Everyone was being friendly. Our waiter's name was Sam and he was cheery in the beginning. We ordered a bottle of prosecco and the cheese plate to start. The cheeses were pretty good. There was a very strong bleu cheese on the plate (that I want to say was similar to Stilton) and a nice honey to balance it out. Tasty beginning.\n\nNow to where our meal started to turn sour.. We ordered our entrees. We had ordered the shrimp meal that came with asparagus and polenta, the mussel dinner with truffle fries, and I had ordered the scallops with turnip puree and portobello mushrooms. \n\nWe will start with the shrimp: OVERCOOKED. The shrimp were hard!! The asparagus were almost raw and the polenta was very loose and liquidy. Yuck. Luckily they took this off of our bill but our waiter never once asked if we wanted a replacement dish. \n\nNow onto the mussels: the mussels were actually good but the creamy broth that came with it seemed like it should have been a little thicker. It was a good sauce though.\n\nThe worst part of our whole meal: the scallops. I don't know how people who have ordered this have been able to stomach them. They were DISGUSTING. It tasted like they had been marinated in a cleaning solution. The thought of it makes me gag. They were flaccid and opaque. Not only did they taste bad, but they were cut so THIN. Even IF they did taste good, I would have been disappointed because they were the size of a quarter. The turnip puree was tasteless. The sauteed portobello mushrooms was the only good component of this dish. I sent back my scallops figuring I had just gotten a bad plate with high hopes for the next one... oh was I wrong. If it's possible, the second plate might have been worse than the first. The scallops were brown and the chemical taste was even stronger. I then sent that plate back and just decided to munch on the grilled artichoke hearts we had gotten. \n\nAfter we complained about our meals being far less than stomach-able, a french lady (who I assumed was the owner) came over and asked us if everything was okay and once we tried to tell her what was wrong, she THEN informed us that she DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. No one came back to our table to ask us how were doing after all of this. We were pretty much avoided for the rest of the night. Each interaction with a staff member led to them grouping up in a little pow-wow and looking over at our table and OBVIOUSLY talking about us. Uncomfortable!\nWhen we got our bill, we saw that they had taken off the shrimp and the scallops, but our bill was still almost $140. \n\nBIGGEST WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. There are WAY better french places in the city.", "author": "Janessa C."}

The \"composed salad\" and creme brulee were especially great. It's expensive, but not astronomical or anything. If $20 entrees are out of your range, you probably wouldn't end up here in the first place, and if they're not, then the prices aren't unreasonable.\n\nUnfortunately, they were out of three separate entrees so three of us had to re-order. Since they were out of the only vegetarian option, they made me a plate of tagliatelle with veggies instead. It tasted great, and I appreciate that they were willing to accommodate me, but I can make pasta with veggies at home and not pay a bunch of money for it, you know? They gave us each a glass of champagne to apologize for the shortage, but alas, I had overindulged the night before and could barely even look at mine let alone drink it.\n\nThe staff was totally friendly and helpful (and many of them had French accents, which would seem to be a good sign in terms of the quality/authenticity of the food), but service was slooooooowwww.

Quite cozy when you get inside. \n\nAppetizers: the french onion is superb! usually i find most french onion soups too salty, but you can taste the sweetness of the caramelized onions in the soup. delicious! it is a must!\n\nWe also got the Escargots \u00e0 la Bourguignonne & Steamed Mussels Marini\u00e8res.  I think 2 of our snails were duds inside, but the favoring and seasoning was quite appetizing.  We figured we are in a french restaurant - gota get the escargot. \nThe steamed mussels are also another MUST HAVE! the broth was superb and my mouth just watered as i was typing it. I enjoyed it a great deal and would order the entree portion again next time as my main course.\n\nMain Course:  My bff got the Saffron seafood cassolette which was similar a seafood pot pie that had fish, shrimp baked inside..   I opted for the NY steak, which didn't wow me too much but the fries actually did.  I thought they were fried perfectly with the seasoning.\n\nDessert: We shared the Strawberry Bruscetta and Floating Island. Both quite tasty and somehow we still had room to put it in our tummies.\n\nWine: I asked the waiter for a recommendation to go with my meal and he suggested a 2001 vintage bourgogne and it was a great pairing.  I'm not too big of a wine drinker but i enjoyed this wine alot. \n\nService:  The staff is very friendly and very affectionate - as we got kisses on each cheek upon our arrival and departure.  However, it appeared that there was only 1 waiter running around and he was very busy.  It took a long time between each dish to show up but each dish was definitely given the time in preparation. \nWe actually ordered a side dish that our waiter forgot to place, and because of his mistake he comped our escargot off our tab, which was very nice of him to do. \n\nParking: its sf, so you know its going to be tough. They only have about 8 spots in their parking lot, so most likely you are going to end up parking on the street.  \n\nTips: -Restaurant.com coupon: you usually can find a promo code for an extra 80% off.

Dimly lit and romantic, this would be a great place for a date. The only problem is that it may be a bit loud on a Friday or Saturday.\n\nThe food was okay the first time and it was okay the second time around. The foie gras torchon was served at room temperature and it did not go with the dry, hard piece of ACME walnut bread. The kobe steak tartare was mushy with the consistency of what you would think raw ground beef taste like. For entree, I had the \"Plum and Steak,\" which was more well-done than medium. The whole dish lacked flavor. I have to say everything was forgettable.\n\nI know it's French culture to kiss on both cheeks as a welcoming or farewell gesture but it makes me very uncomfortable.

The service is quick and friendly, the wait for the food is a little long if you choose not to get an appetizer. As far as the food goes, the mussels are fantastic and plentiful, the beef bourguignon compensated extra saltiness for flavor, and the duck leg was a little disappointing. The duck leg should've been advertised as a pastry since it was basically a semi-dry duck leg surrounded by a flaky baked pastry, not at all what I was expecting.

I liked the chocolate pear tart best, which tastes more like a flourless chocolate tart than anything. But the pear tart was a good effort because it wasn't mushy. \n\nJust OK:\n- The Kobe steak tartare was decent, but nothing special.

We waited a long time before they came to take our order, continued to ask for more water throughout dinner and after 10-15 mins of having our table cleared out (after dessert), we had to remind the staff that we still did not receive our check. I really dislike places that think they can lack on service just because we have a big party and they automatically get gratuity. Please note they charged us 20% gratuity for our party.\n\nWe came here last night for Dine About Town and the food was mediocre, but the upside is that the portions are pretty good.\n\nThe things that I tried:\nP.E.I Mussels Marinieres - this was actually really good and was one of the two dishes that I liked at this place. My bf ordered this dish and kindly shared it with me. I love taking the bread and dipping it into the juice in the bowl to savor the white wine taste.\n\nCrab a la russe - this dish was the second thing I liked in which I ordered. It was light and rich at the same time. The crab felt like it melted in your mouth when you ate it.\n\nMain Entree:\nAll natural Moulard Duck leg Confit Wellington - not good at all. The duck itself lacked seasoning and was very dry. The thing I liked best of the whole dish was the bed of vegetables that the duck leg was laying on. I actually gave most of my duck to my bf to eat because of two reasons: a. the duck was not that good and 2: I was getting full. \nEven my bf didn't like the duck dish.\n\nMost of my friends ordered Angus 8oz Hanger Steak and it was so charred outside. My friend's hanger steak actually looked like a piece of poop just because of the cut and the over charring of the steak. Another friend ordered it medium well and his steak was still red inside. \n\nDessert:\nCheesecake cookie, raspberry coulis - the cheesecake was ok, but when I eat cheesecake, the best part is the crust. This dish was cheesecake on top of a soft cookie. There was no crunch to the crust on the bottom. I was very disappointed in this dish. Also, if you are not a tangy kind of person. I wouldn't recommend this dish for you. The Raspberry Puree was very tangy.\n\nVanilla cr\u00e8me brulee - I liked this dessert better that I switched with my bf HAHA. This is like most places that serve creme brulee. It was light and tasty.\n\nOverall: \nI would not come here again. It just wasn't worth it at the end. A friend decided to NOT order off of  the Dine About Town menu and her three dishes (appetizer, entree and dessert) and it was cheaper than us ordering from the Dine About Town menu. At the end, you just break even. The deal isn't worth it. \n\nAlso be aware that if you sit on the 1st floor, you will get gusts of wind throughout your meal.

It was the week of Christmas, and this place had a few large parties that evening. \n\nAs with the last time, we were warmly greeted by one of the wait staff.

The tables were literally arranged for maximum capacity, so there wasn't much room for maneuvering around the restaurant. \n\nOur reservation was at 7:30 but we waited until around 8:15 to be seated. We ordered the fritas, mussels, and onion soup as appetizers. The fries were decent; they came with a dice sized dipping sauce that tasted like strong mustard. The mussels came in a huge bowl, and were sitting in what tasted like butter water. As unhealthy as it looked, it went really well with the mussels. And lastly our onion soup was a bit on the salty side, but we just used it as a sort of dip for the bread they provided (their bread was cold, boohoo).\n\nWe originally came here for the Dine About Town menu, but when we took a look at their regular menu we decided it'd be more worth it to just do ala carte. I ordered the salmon; it came wrapped in a baking paper and was cooked to just how I like it. The salmon was on top of a bed of purple yams, which I felt didn't go too well the fish. I also tried my friends' duck, it was amazing! The duck was tender had a hint of sweetness, which is probably why I loved it so much since I have quite a bit of a sweet tooth.\n\nThis restaurant is in the most random spot ever but I enjoyed eating here. Despite the wait and confined space, I would come back here next time I'm in the mood for some good French food.", "author": "Angela K."}

My party of three all ordered different starters, entrees, desserts so I got to taste a lot of their items.  \n\nStarters:  Organic Composed Salad, Crab a la russe, and PEI Mussels.  None of them were spectacular, but if I had to choose a winner, I'd say the crab dish.  Probably because it had avocados.  That always does it.  Mussels-wise, good amount so no complaints.\n\nEntrees: Duck Leg Confit Wellington, Seared Shrimps, and Angus Hanger Steak.  Again, nothing blew my mind away.  The accompaniments on the dishes were what impressed me more.  The polenta on the seared shrimps dish was delish.  The potatoes with the duck leg was yum.  And I guess the fries with the hanger steak were all right.  The meats and shrimp itself were a let-down.  Seemed like it needed some seasoning and oomph.  \n\nDessert: Mixed fruit tart, vanilla creme brulee, and the Ile flottante.  AGAIN, average.  The Ile flottante is a light soft meringue, with vanilla cream, caramel, and toasted almonds.  Ordered it because it sounded fancy.  Now that we have tried it, we know not to order it next time.  It's like a soaked sponge cake.  Lacked flavor, like a lot of their other items, and just did not hit the spot.\n\nWord of advice: Do not come with someone you don't like or are not comfortable with.  The wait in between the courses will cause some major tension/awkwardness.  But as that was not the case for me, it was bearable and presented itself as a good time to catch up with friends.", "author": "Vanessa C."}

The blend of flavors create a unique taste for your palette!  I believe the menu changes monthly.  The atmosphere was very laid back with semi-loud upbeat music, mood lighting, people mingling at the bar towards the back and the tables very close together.  There weren't many waiters, but the restaurant is not very large.  Most of the tables and the bar are on the ground level and there are a few tables on the second level.  Once in a while, the Chef will come out to mingle, chat and check on clients, or even bus tables if necessary!\n\nWhen my family and I arrived for dinner, we weren't greeted right away. It was a full house, this place seems popular. We made a reservation, but we had to wait about 15 min. Also, there is no waiting area, so we awkwardly stood between the rows of tables near the door.  I was getting a bad impression of this restaurant, but once we were seated, it was all uphill from there!\n\nWe ordered 6 appetizers (about $7-15 each): Kobe steak tartare, escargots a la Bourgignone, cheese platter, French onion soup, fois gras, and Californian garden tart.\n**Fois Gras - fantastic, so smooth, melts in your mouth\n**Escargots - came with a delicious, garlic & shallot infused sauce.  Couldn't let the sauce go to waste, so I ate the rest with baguette.\n*All appetizers were great! Those 2 were my faves.\n\nWe ordered 2 Entrees: \n*Sonoma Duck Breast Surprise - honey-glazed duck breast, chestnuts and pureed carrots.  The sauce was a sweet, thick honey sauce with duck jus, I loved it!  However, this dish was a bit small.\n*Rack of Lamb - Special of the day. Delicious! Cooked the way we requested.\n\n2 Desserts:\nFloating Island - spongy, sweet egg whites floating in warm English cream. This tasted good as well and wasn't too sweet to my surprise.\nChocolate Pear Tart - thick, moist and rich in chocolaty flavor. Almost like a brownie, but not so oily. Great taste!\n\nMy family loves mussels, but they said there were no mussels that day because they received them, but they looked bad. So they threw them out, which I think is a good move as a restaurant.  As we headed to the door, the Chef and waiter greeted us with a goodbye and thank you in French & English! We could tell that the Chef was happy to have us (and all the other clients) because he gave us each a big, genuine hug!\n\n**5 Stars for a fun, great experience with French cuisine!  I will definitely come back when I want some more la cuisine francaise!", "author": "Elizabeth Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-06", "description": "One of the most common comments about Chouchou is that it is out-of-the-way, a charming bistro hidden in the Forest Hill neighborhood, one of those places you seek out rather than stumble upon. I think it might be mildly ironic, then, that the only reason I knew about the restaurant was that I used to pass by there regularly. (It was on the route of a shortcut between my friend's former apartment and a bar we used to go to.) And it is probably slightly more than mildly ironic that the first time I actually went to Chouchou on purpose, I got lost. \n\nAnyway. Chouchou is worth dealing with google map's bad directions. In fact , the out-of-the-wayness adds to its charm. I can't praise the seafood trio more--every bite was perfect. And if you get it, do savor it--the portion is small. My friends' meals, however, were more than filing enough. Next time I go, I'll get the duck. I'll also get one of their lattes--I love that they have full espresso service and don't even charge the usual restaurant premium.\n\nIt was actually a good thing that I was the only one who didn't have a meal that left one excruciatingly full because when the waiter brought a complimentary slice of the chocolate-mandarin orange tart, I was the only one who could eat it. Any restaurant that services a complimentary dessert has won my heart forever. \n\nOne word of warning: the waiter likes to kiss female patrons' cheeks. If you're a germaphobe, New Englander, or both, you can always follow my trick of wearing an angry scowl until the danger has passed.", "author": "Susan S."}

Chou Chou has been my go to French Bistro that entire time...until last night. What I did not know before my boyfriend made reservations for Valentine's Day was that the bistro has been sold and has NEW OWNERS. We have been going to their Valentine's Day celebration for a few years, and this was absolutely an embarrassing DISASTER like I have never experienced in a restaurant before! Here is a run down:\n\n-overall service was exceedingly bad. There were lots of bus boy types milling about but no one person actually serving us. We had to flag down bus boys to get anything, from drinks to asking where our meal was, to even the check.\n-ordered our meal but it took at least 30 minutes before bread even arrived on the table\n-1 hour into the meal we finally got our appetizers. My first course was a crab salad that I swear was actually canned tuna fish. I'm not kidding.\n- drank prosecco all night, but oddly had no buzz...could it be that they watered down the drinks with mineral water?!!\n-1.5 hours into the experience we finally got our main courses. My boyfriend's pork chop was not fully cooked! Scary times. We ordered a side of pomme frites and got big steak fries with tons of garlic and parmesan. wha???\n-as the night progressed and our meal was taking over 2 hours from start to finish, a massive line up of people arriving with reservations. the room was filled with TENSION from the staff, to the customers at tables angry with the service, to the people with reservations who were wondering why they had to wait an hour to be seated. It was a complete disaster!\n\nIn addition to the clear disaster of Valentine's Day Meal service, the gratuity was automatically added to the bill, giving us NO opportunity to express our outrage at the service. We paid over $200 for a terrible amateur meal, terrible wait staff, and 2 hours of embarrassment. When we got home we immediately looked up online to figure out what happened to our beloved Chou Chou...new owners!

Normally, this wouldn't be a problem. I've gotten steaks at other places that weren't cooked right. But getting a steak that was not cooked right at nearly the two hour mark put me over the top.

It is a small quaint restaurant almost in the middle of nowhere but definitely worth trekking to. I ran across this place through a recommendation from a co-worker and it was a great restaurant indeed!! Service was great and the food ... it was Yum-Yum excellent! \n\nMy husband ordered the prix fixe menu that came with a selection of appetitizers, entrees and dessert - all for only $25.95. He chose the Frisee aux Lardons (Frisee salad with poached egg and pancetta as appetitizer and I got the Sauteed escargots with garlic, butter, and puff pastry. Both were delicious. \n\nFor entree, I ordered the duck confit - shredded duck nestled inside the lightest, tastiest, thinniest fingerling potatoes I've ever had. Simply deleeessh!! Myhusband ordered the mussels with the side of shoestring fries. Mann, that bowl must have had 50+ mussels in there... they definitely didn't go cheap on the portions even though the mussels were part of the Prix Fixe menu. The broth that came with the mussels was excellent. \n\nThen came the dessert. By this time, I was too full to have any - but since the prix fixe order came with dessert, we picked the Mixed fruit tart to share.  And mann o mann....I practically ate 1/2 of this tart even though my tummy was about to explode. It was soooo good!! The crust was thin and sugar-coated, which provided a great balance with the fruits. Excellent!! The dessert was my favorite even though I liked everything else too. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a non-pretendious French bistro that gives you all the things you're looking for - service, price, and great food!!", "author": "Jannie Q."}

The champagne was great, but it'd better be if I was surprised by a $85 bill later, when all we ordered was 2 desserts for something like $8 each.\n\nNot really a great introduction to a supposedly great French restaurant.  If you offer champagne to waiting patrons, it had better be complimentary, the house brand, or you had better make it clear it's Lancelot at $67 per bottle.  Also, lose the euro trashy wait staff (slow) and invest in a door that works.", "author": "Dylan T."}

I couldn't read my menu though; so, I strategically optimized my tea-light candle flame by placing it behind my glass of water.

Not much was really done to acknowledge the delay, which was even more annoying.\n\nAmbiance: 3/5 - Considering the somewhat random location, it has a nicer feel. A few downsides though - since it's small and the door is a straight shot into the restaurant, cold breezes come in. People also end up waiting just inside the door, next to many of the tables.\n\nValue: 4/5 - Entrees are under $30, many being closer to $20, so given the types of dishes it's priced fairly reasonably.

Upon arrival, the first floor was a bit noisy, but they were able to seat us at a cozy table on the quieter and more romantic dimly lit second floor.  Bread and butter were served straight-away and the waiter allowed us plenty of time to order drinks and food.  I tried a glass of a Syrah on his suggestion, but in hindsight, was probably not as pleased with it as I would have liked to have been. \n\nWe eventually settled on the lamb and braised beef, as well as the $16 foie gras plate (since it will be banned by next July!)    The foie gras came on a board with some brioche and huckleberry compote.  The sweet berries proved to be a fine complement to the rich, smooth foie gras.  It should be mentioned that we actually got quite a generous, filling portion of foie gras.  There wasn't quite enough brioche, and we wound up using some of the harder bread to spread the gras on.\n\nAfter finishing the appetizer, the lamb and beef entrees arrived.  The medium-rare lamb was topped with a cute log of long, raw pea shoots, a combination that I found to be quite delightful, if not sensual, matching the slight gamey-ness of the lamb with the slightly earthy taste of the pea shoots.  The lamb was both tender and juicy, all the way to the bone.  It also came with some long green beans and hand-cut yam  chips.  The Angus beef Bourguignon came with a separate bowl of pasta noodles - almost like Chinese Jia-Jiang mein.  The beef was tender and the sauce rich, but otherwise, I wasn't as impressed with its presentation.  \n\nAnyhow, we couldn't finish the entrees, so we got a takeout box and took a peek at the dessert menu.  But one dessert caught my eye - a banana flambee!   So, we ordered that.  Apparently it comes with a little show!  The waiter (or waitress, in our case) brought out a little cooker onto a table on the first floor (apparently not enough room on the second floor to do this) and cooked up the bananas, spiced rum, and brown sugar in a little skillet, and lit the mixture on fire, creating what seemed to be a blue hue, from our vantage point.  Otherwise, the dessert was just chopped bananas in a sweet, rummy, caramelized, maple syrup-y sauce.  But good to the last drop ;)", "author": "Gerald C."}

Yes it can happen.\n\nChouchou had been on my list to chowchow at for quite a while. I had seen a segment on Check Please several months back and made a mental note to pay a visit. We even have a friend who literally lives a short walk away. \n \nMy wife and our friend had dined there on several occasions, but I was always getting into some legal troubles of some sort and could never join in on the fun. Finally last night I was able to break out my prison cell and I got the opportunity to enjoy a nice meal out.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in we were treated by the most friendly service by the entire waitstaff.  Drink orders quickly taken, water glasses continually poured and helpful advice on menu items offered. \n\nThe atmosphere is just what you would expect. a quaint little neighborhood French bistro filled with locals. My wife is a lighting snob and was more than pleased with the dim romantic mood, but not to dark where you can't read the menu.\n\nParking situation? Yes, this is San Francisco but easy, a small lot to the right of the front door is available and also plenty of street parking to be found.\n\nThe food? Yes, they serve food. It was not mind blowing \"best ever French food in the City ever\" kind of experience. But I thought it was still excellent and the menu varied enough to keep even picky eaters happy.We split an onion and goat cheese to start that was light, flaky and full of flavor with not one ingredient dominating the dish. For my main I went with the beef cheeks. The cheeks were moist, soft and not overcooked at all. You can tell the cow never worked out as they were not tough at all. They were cooked in a clay pot along with carrots, potatoes in what seemed like a red wine sauce. Think beef bourginion but they just don't call it that.\n\nMy wife had the halibut (for the halibut). I don't eat seafood so I will take her word for it that it was good. She was impressed that they asked her how she wanted it prepared (medium rare). She believes that most meat/seafood dishes tend to be overcooked. I tend to agree. My wife is also a French fry fiend, so I ordered a side of those too. They were good, but maybe a little too on the on thin side (not Zuni thin, just thin).\n\nBy the end of the meal the three of us were stuffed but of course I can never leave without having something for dessert. We decided to split the creme brulee. Our waitress didn't want to see the table walk away starving and brought out a chocolate tart on the house as well. Both desserts helped complete a perfect evening.\n\nNice spot for a casual evening out or for a first date. They don't even bring you the check unless you ask for it, just like in France!

My sea bass with calamari and chopped \"salsa\" was delicious, and my partner's scallops over a beat and mashed potato mixture melted in your mouth. The french onion soup was fantastic too! Our chocolate pear tart was the perfect ending to the meal. The wines are all great, but very expensive. Cheapest is $28 - and that is for a half bottle. The service was friendly, chatty, and cute, but most importantly, on task. \n\nCons: The music didn't fit the food or ambience. They were playing pink floyd by the time we left. I guess they have a sense of humor. The restaurant is very loud. It was difficult to hear my partner's conversation. They did an odd calculation method with the restaurant.com certificate opting to take a few dollars off here and there, maybe a percentage. It did not quite add up to the full $25 off but rather around 21 dollars off.  Why is it that everytime I use one of those certificates my bills look different or the waiters get flustered?", "author": "Mark S."}

They had the chicken.  I commented on their chicken looking undercooked during the meal but the windows are tinted a very weird ORANGE so we concluded that it was just the lighting, but it obviously wasn't....speaking on the orange tinted windows, wow ugly! The whole room is bathed in this weird orange hue.\n\nOn top of the food poisoning there was a very limited and overpriced menu. The food was the definition of average and the serving sizes were very small. I didn't mind the small serving sizes the less of their food the better!  \n\nThe dinning room doesn't feel fancy, it just feels kinda cheap and thrown together, not a place to celebrate for sure.\n\nThe service was not horrible but there wasn't any friendliness either, just \"what would you like.\" Etc...   Although the birthday girl's dinner came a full 6 or 7 minutes AFTER everyone else's food, so we all ate luke-warm food since we waited out of politeness.\n\nAll in all, there wasn't one positive thing I could say about this place, I wish I could but it just failed in every way.\n\nOh, and the bill was HUGE!

THAT is customer service. holy crap.\n\ni ordered the halibut for my entree, paul got the steak. his steak was so tender you really didn't need a steak knife at all. my halibut was cooked perfectly and came with the most amazing leek gratin EVER. like it put a smile on face once i ate it. like i'm about to have dreams about it. \n\n[side note, there was also a female server delivering our food and she was just as nice as the guy before her]\n\nfor dessert we shared a slice of the mixed fruit tart and we were offered complimentary glasses of kir royal.

Let me explain:\n\nPRO: \n* Lobster Bouillabaisse with mussels, clams, fish, prawns and more was delicious. A masterpiece of a dish made famous by Julia Childs. Very buttery and creamy, but worth it once in a French blue moon.\n* Duck Confit - 4.5 star! Perfectly crispy skin. Great brown rice and special French sauces. No fat to be found. Only the finest duck and sauces around.\n* Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer was fantastic. 5 star. Well marinated, good use of asian fusion croutons and bean sprouts. I wanted more!\n\nCON:\n- I called weeks ago to make Vday reservations and was explicitly told by a male worker that I didn't have to order the $70/person Vday tasting menu, and could order regular dishes as well.\n- They overbooked themselves for 8PM and there were about 35 people (the restaurant fits about 50 max) waiting in the middle of the tiny place hitting me in the back of the head, HORRIBLE!\n- They ran out of creme brulee even though it was one of two dessert choices on the mandatory pre-fixe menu! And we came relatively early!\n- The chocolate tort cake was horrible. Dry, overcooked, I wanted to puke it out.\n- One male waiter was yelling at the chefs constantly and I thought they'd end up in blows, the whole restaurant heard it and they had to be shushed by the manager. \n\nSo basically if I wasn't promised I could order the regular menu instead of paying an arm and a leg I would have gotten two entrees and one appetizer and one dessert and saved $50-70 easily.\n\nCome here for the entrees and ahi tartare and nothing else.

I would say 2.5 stars at best, but I'll give them the extra half star for having their own parking lot. First off, the restaurant is REALLY small and they've jammed in as many tables/chairs as possible. I definitely wouldn't recommend it if you're claustrophobic. It was also kinda awkward since i felt like I was being watched while eating due to the fact that there were a lot of people waiting for tables, and they're literally standing right behind you. \n\nWe had a reservation for 7:30 and didn't get to finish dinner till close to 10. The 2.5 hours dinner wasn't due to the fact that the food was amazing and we were enjoying ourselves, though the company was great, but simply due to the ridiculous SLOW SERVICE. We spent more time waiting between courses for food/service then actually eating! It was easily 20 minutes of wait time between each course.\n\nWe arrived at 7:30 and were seated promptly, but had to wait awhile before the waiter came by to take our order. They changed their menu from what was listed on the DAT website so I got the Crab Salad and Half Chicken. The Crab Salad was mixed nicely and the crab flavor really stood out. The lemon dressing also contrasted nicely against it.  The Chicken wasn't half bad, though the sauce was a little on the buttery side, but nothing to write home about. I think my favorite part was actually the potato gratin that came with it. \n\nThen came desert. My friend asked to see their desert menu since she didn't do DAT and the waiter kinda brushed off her question and was like \"I'll bring you guys a surprise on the house\" and left without giving any of us desert options. We're still not quite sure how it would have been \"on the house\" when 4 of us did DAT and it came with desert. Awhile later, the waiter came back with \"every desert they have available\", which consisted of a plate of Tarts and 1 lonely Creme Brulee. None of us wanted the Tarts since we had all planned on getting Creme Brulee, but I guess they ran out and didn't want to tell us. I would have rather they just told me and skipped the desert. \n\nSorry Chouchou, I wanted to like you but sadly you disappointed me with your lack of service.", "author": "Carrie F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-01-09", "description": "We used to go to Chouchou quite a bit, a few years back. We've always enjoyed the food & atmosphere -- so we booked a reservation for Christmas Eve, a special treat for my parents visiting from out of town for the holidays.  A special occasion, since we just bought a new house in the neighborhood, & wanted to show my folks one of the hidden gems in our area.\n\nWell, what can I say.  It was an awful, terrible, almost humourously disasterous evening.  \n\nMy parents are older, and actually go to bed *really* early (like, 8pm). So we booked a reservation for 5:30pm.  We arrived spot-on at 5:30, and the door was still locked.  We waited for a little while, and we were the first ones in & seated.  I'm pretty sure we were first to order, as well.  Slowly, other people began to trickle in.  After an hour, the place was packed until we left.... over 3 hours later.\n\nAfter ordering, it was an hour and a half later before we received salad or soup.  We had one tiny piece of baguette that they brought after an hour of sitting there, and four empty water glasses.  We complained only a couple times about the wait  -- other people were actually eating & leaving before we even received a leaf of salad.   Eventually we got a second piece of baguette.\n\nIt was a very chilly & windy evening, and with each person who came in or left, the open door let in a bone chilling wind that ran through the restaurant.  The door didn't close completely by itself, so the poor chap sitting immediately behind the door had to close it almost every time.  I'm sure his evening was as \"memorable\" as ours.\n\nSo, after 90 minutes waiting for soup and salad, when it finally arrived, we inhaled that small plate of greens & thin bowl of soup.  We were starved.  They never brought more than that second piece of baguette (for a table of 4!)... We probably finished soup & salad in 10-15 minutes.  Regardless, the main course didn't arrive for another hour...!  So, here we are, two and a half hours into a Christmas Eve dinner, with pretty much an empty table staring at us the whole evening.\n\nThe \"ma\u00eetre d'\" actually apologized at one point, and brought out four glasses of port, on the house.  But when the main dish still hadn't arrived twenty minutes later, and we were able to make eye contact with him, we saw him roll his eyes in a sort of painful, wincing recollection, and he ran back into the kitchen.  Our meal then finally came out like 30 seconds later.\n\nThis clearly wasn't so much a matter of slow service -- we basically had no waiter serving us after our order was taken.  We had to get someone's attention each course, for any service at all.  We never saw our waiter again after he took our order.\n\nLike idiots, we actually ordered dessert.  Another 30 minutes waiting for dessert.  Which doesn't make sense, since we ordered the crepes flambee, which they make at the table for you.  My father ordered the \"floating island\", which was an incredible disappointment. (In the absense of service, there should be some sort self-service description on the menu that gives some suggestion as to what the food item may be.  He was hoping for ice cream.  It was not.)\n\nWell, long story short, from 5:30 to 8:30 we had a relatively average dinner without even a lot of food (we had pretty much digested everything before leaving).     Sadly we even had to wait for the bill, which was just adding insult to injury.  It was almost 9pm as we traipsed home, exhaused, disappointed, and already a bit hungry again.  \n\nThe food wasn't bad; but nothing to write home about. The whole experience, however, was worth writing about, sadly.  Just as a catharsis, if nothing else.\n\nCertainly Chouchou was not the way we remembered it from years past, unfortunately.  I do hope this was just an exception, because we still do have fond memories of going here.  But it'll be a while before we can forget this experience.", "author": "michl .."}

I should've stuck to that rule.\n\nIt's a small and crowded restaurant.  Our party of 11 were seated fairly promptly for our reservation @ 6.30p on a Sunday.  Service was okay the rest of the night.  They took a while before giving us water and didn't ask if we wanted anything else to drink.  They didn't even hand us a wine list.  Spoons and steak knives also came long after the soup and entrees had arrived.  However, they were pretty good at serving the courses at the same time for all 11 people.\n\nMany of us ordered the French Onion per yelpers' recommendations.  Unfortunately, I've had better, at Bennigan's no less (the $7.99 combo will get your two sliders, too).  The mustard seeds were interesting but the soup was waaay too salty.  The bread to soup ratio also seemed high.  And I'd like my cheese a little more browned.\n\nOnly about half of us ordered off the DAT menu which was not spectacular and not a particularly good deal.  The regular menu was equally underwhelming so I went for the bavette.  While I'm not familiar with this flank cut of meat, it was odd to me that it tasted/felt more like stew meat.  Perhaps that's because it was well done when I asked for medium?  I couldn't find a grain to cut against and there was no pink left.  My friend asked for medium rare and got it pretty rare.  I tried my husband's duck confit which was okay.  Two people barely touched their DAT salmon but I didn't know why.  The veal chop was huge so half of it was packed home.\n\nI chose to finish the meal with the crepe suzette which was fun to watch.  The sauce was a little too sweet and tart for my taste but I didn't complain when the owner singled me out and asked how I liked it.\n\nAs my husband and I reflected on our dinner, we felt that Chouchou just didn't live up to the hype.  In just the last 12 months, we've had more satisfying French culinary experiences at Rue St. Jacque, Absinthe, Chapeau, Left Bank, and Alize.", "author": "Bertilla M."}

The pea shoots and toast were a nice compliment to the salad. Also, portions were just enough-not too large or too small. My main dish was the duck confit over a bed of farro, chirizo and snap peas. Yummy! It was really made well-the duck leg was crispy on the outside and warm and tender on the inside. Not dry at all. And the best part was that the farro was cooked in duck fat which tasted so good, adding a lot of flavor, depth and density.

And I kept on having to try hard to get a waiter to fill up our glasses for us as they never seemed to notice that. And the food took forever to come out as well, we sat down at 6:50 and left around 9pm. yeah, it's that slow!\n\nFood: it was okay, not as impressive as I thought. We ordered:\n\n1. Escargot : tiny little snails with way too much breadcrumbs on top, I was slightly confused as to what we're supposed to be eating, crumbs or snails?\n2. Duck confit: The sauce that came with it was fairly nice, but the duck itself was way too hard.\n3. Vegetarian Crepe: It's interesting but the crepe was too thick, it almost felt like cardboard\n4. steak and fries: the cut of the steak was not tender at all, we asked for a medium rare, but it came more like a medium. But the fries were good though.\n5. Veal chop: the meat was decent but also seemed to be on the dry side.\n6. Creme Brulee: It's too runny, I thought creme brulee was supposed to have the consistency more like flan (the firmness aspect of it) , right?\n7. floating island: it's basically what's inside creme brulee in a bawl with meringue on top and drizzled with caramel sauce. nothing impressive.\n\nHowever, the French baguette they served you in the beginning was really good, crusty on the outside and soft in the center.

Soup & appetizers were excellent as before, but I got the Cassoulet (like I usually did before) and it was actually quite disappointing.  It was now much too gamey and greasy for my liking.\n\nTo top it all off, I think they have actually raised the prices since I last ate here.

When we came in at 7:15pm, the place was full, and nobody had any food. People in the corner were looking sad, trying to catch the attention of a waiter who was just not interested. People next to us were brought main course, but complained that their starters haven't come out yet.  This is when we sat down. For the next 15 minutes, nobody showed up even with menus.\n\nAnother 15 minutes for aperitifs to come out. And then a whopping hour for any food. Though no, I'm lying, a ridiculous pre-starter appeared, I'm guessing because they were getting nervous that there is no real food coming out- they composed some atrocious dish that was not on the menu, and consisted of canned salmon pate and herbed goat cheese wrapped together, and, inexplicably, mango salsa on the side.... individually these three things might taste good, but mixed together, it was not edible.\n\nWe were there with two children, who thankfully received their french fries and ice-cream on time, and then kept themselves entertained by bastille day balloons. But after 1.5 hours, and adults still not having main course, children started to ask to go home. We were ready too- even without main course!\n\nAt some point our waiter came out, saw an empty table, and happily asked if it was desert time! This was before any ordered starters came out....\n\nFrench onion soup tasted of ... mustard... predominantly, and went back untouched. Fillet mignon was a good piece of meat, cooked to order, and unencumbered by any of the chef's inventions, it was good. I did not try the sides or the sauce out of fear of spoiling the impression.\n\nFinally, when it got to dessert, we had to take it to go, since kids were at the end of their patience, and so were we. The dessert, which was a pear tart, was a chocolate fudge type thing, with congealed translucent pear slices melded into the top- really very bad.\n\nIn the end at 9pm, the staff tried very hard to keep us pleased- we were the last diners in the restaurant, and weren't looking happy. They comp'ed kid's deserts, and even brought them toys to keep. And this is why my review gets 2 stars instead of 1.\n\nI don't know if it's any better on a regular day, but judging from other reviews, it's not.. Definitely not recommended on a busy holiday!\n\nService was awful. Chef kept walking around trying to make amends.\nMaitre D' (the greeter)- was lost, and so were the waiters.\nFood was mediocre at best, and sometimes plain bad.\nPrice was prix fixe at $60/person! which is way too much for this meal...", "author": "Adelie P."}

We had to wait quite a while to be seated, seems like the restaurant overbooked for the night. While we had our meal, there were always large groups of people standing in the doorway and in the middle of the restaurant waiting to be seated. No bueno.\n\nOverall, the starter and main entrees were great. My only complaint was the awful desserts. In our group, we tried the floating island, the ice cream cup with \"fresh fruits,\" and some of the tarts. It was extremely underwhelming to say the least. The floating island is some kind of meringue floating in some sauce with hot caramel sauce over it...with almonds? It tasted like eating a big soggy marshmellow. It just felt kind of half assed. The ice cream cup had two pieces of raspberry in it...that was it. For all we knew, it was probably scooped out of a dreyer's ice cream carton lol. \n\nThe bathroom is a bit unsettling. Dark and lit with only a few red lights. They really ought to remodel the bathroom...\n\nConsidering the mixed quality of food throughout our night, location, and overall experience I would probably never return.", "author": "Patricia Q."}

I ordered the chef's omelet and instead of a double folded omelet which I'm use to, the omelet had several stacked layers.  The eggs were very fluffy and the gruyere cheese added a lot of flavor.   The side potatoes were seasoned enough and not soggy. \n\nI had a taste of the Croque Monsieur- grilled ham & cheese sandwich, which was VERY cheesy...cheese covered the entire bread.  Nothing to eat with your hands; it's defintinely a knife and fork kinda sandwich. \n\nI loved the slight crunch of the crust from Quiche Lorraine with eggs- bacon over pastry puff along with a side of mixed green salad.  The bacon was subtle, which was good for me since I'm not a fan of bacon. \n\nDefinitely a very cheesy brunch meal, so if you like cheese, this place is a hit.  Loved the location, as you can sit by the window and peer at the view, and it's a small intimate place.  \n\nGreat, friendly, genuine service by the two waiters.  When we were several steps out the door, one of them came running and called after us to specifically shake our hands goodbye, despite how busy they were!

What I was really dying to try was the foie gras and I got my wish; along with some other foods. \n\nI've passed by Chouchou all the time but never realized what it was. It's a tiny restaurant but when you step in, you won't feel extremely cramped or anything. The service was really good. They came to pour water and cleaned up our tables from time to time. Friendly service too. It was pretty lit at around 7:40 but then the lights dimmed a bit and set a more romantic mood.\n\nFood was amazing. I just had to order the foie gras (fatty duck liver). I sort of wish it was seared instead of served cold, but the taste was interesting. It came out on a white plate with jam drizzled underneath, a fig on the side, and under some bread. The bread added a firm texture while the liver had a buttery contrast to it. I found the taste of the liver to be very unfamiliar but it was a nice experience. \n\nMy entree was the rack of lamb with truffle sauce, truffle bread, and a mix of veggies. The lamb was tender and just so good with the sauce. Veggies were good also, but nothing really to rave about. I really liked the taste of the truffle cake though. Quite light and not like any cake or bread I've had before. \n\nThe price for this place is pretty up there, but that's expected for a French cuisine restaurant.

The roles reversed.  It was her who tooted the horn outside this time.  It was me  walking  down the steps, nervously twisting the insides of my pockets, too shy to look at her directly while she leered at me.  Actually, no, that's just her everytime I swoop her.  Driving to Chouchou, we passed many parking spots due to her inability to park, settling for a huge space that was literally half a block in length about a block away.  Walking in, we were immediately greeted and told to stand at the bar to await seating.  The ambiance of Chouchou is very French, reminding me of my summer visits on therue of St. Germaine de Pres.  Everything is very compact and you are literally rubbing elbows with the next table.  The lighting is very dim with most illumination coming from a candle on each table; music that ranges from top 40s to french music softly pipe in the background.  We were seated upstairs, which was very intimate considering the occasion.  It is pretty much a table so small you have no choice but to be an inch away from each other's face; brushing of the dentals is paramount.  We ordered a bottle of Domaine Bernier Chardonnay  along with the:\n\n1.  plate of cheese appetizer: 3/5  the cheese platter consisted of 2 cow cheese, 1 goat blue cheese and one sheep log.  I wasn't too fond of the cheeses beside the goat cheese.  The cow cheese tasted like a kraft single.  The highlight of this platter was the honey.  It blew grocery store honey out of the water.  Given it's pricetag, i was pretty disappointed.  Our waiter failed to name the cheese when he placed it before us and after consulting with the chef, took very long to get back to us.\n\n2.  onion soup: 3/5  after Chez Maman, I have fallen in love with onion soup.  The torched cheese on top is so good, and once you break that seal and get to the innards, my god.  This onion soup came topped with guyere cheese, and unfortunately, came with too much cheese.  Once I broke the seal and ate the cheese, I found that there was hardly any soup.  It was some onions and just gobs and gobs of cheese, so much that I grew very sick of it.  \n\n3.  all natural creek stone 8 oz bavette: 3/5   I ordered this piece of meat medium rare and it came nicely presented.  I was a little full at this point from an earlier lunch, wine and the appetizers so was relieved that this piece of meat wasn't too big.  The pomme frites were delicious and perfectly seasoned.  However, my meat was very average.  It was tender inside however, just didn't stand out on how a pice priced cut should.  It was a little sinewy and I implore chouchou to give sharper cutting steak knives.  I grew quite weary sawing at the last strands of sinew holding my bite from the whole.  The blue cheese beef sauce was okay.  The blue cheese was surprisingly very intense in it and I used the sauce sparingly.  The fries had a dipping sauce however, it did not taste good at all.  \n\n4.  Loch Duart Scottish Salmon Papillote:  3/5  The salmon was pretty neat that in came in a bag, then was cut by the waiter.  Unfortunately, that was its only high point.  The salmon tasted very plain and alas, KDer has baked me better salmon before.  The purple potatoes were a aesthetic garnish, however, the taste did not follow suit.  \n\nI really wanted to like this restaurant.  The decor and ambiance as a whole is really something.  Sitting upstairs was a treat as we had a view of downstairs and as my gf likened it, a bird eye's view of tig-o-bitties, if you like that sort of thing.  This place is really for dates and the table settings are very intimate.  If you looked around, what you would notice in common at every table was a bottle of wine and hand holding on the table.  However, for the cuisine, the food was just average.  While it was presented very well, the taste was lacking.  The waiters are very friendly and jest with you, however, on this day, was very slow.  He apologetically explained that one person called in sick, however, it took 20 minutes nearly for them to present me with a check and 10 more minutes to receive my receipt.  I won't penalize them for that as it sobered me up.  At the end of the day, Chouchou, despite its successful attempt at looking very chic, as evidenced by its clientele and their attire, was painfully, just average.  I have no qualms on spending enemy on a dinner with my to infinity and beyond counterpoint, however, when the food doesn't merit its hundie cost, I get a bit irked.  Chouchou did not live up to the expectations however, at the end of the day, its who is across the table from you that really counts.

Walking in around 6 pm, they didn't appear busy at all.  They were quick to confirm that we had reservations though as the restaurant definitely began filling up between 6:30 - 7:00 pm.\n\nAs we perused over their menu, we enjoyed their hot bread and butter. (Yum, who doesn't love warm bread?).  \n\nFor $31.95, they offered the following courses: \nFirst Course - \nFrench Onion Soup gratinee - with croutons topped with Swiss cheese\nEndive Salad - with Roquefort cheese, candied walnuts, and balsamic vinaigrette\nFricassee d' escargots - snails with roasted garlic, tomatoes, shallots on Chouchou brioche and white wine sauce\n\nSecond Course - \nGrilled New York Steak - with green beans, pommes frites, and green peppercorn sauce\nSeared Salmon - with potato leek puree, yellow squash, provencale vinaigrette sauce\nCassoulet - braised pork, Toulouse sausage, garlic sausage and duck confit with white beans\n\nDessert - \nChoice of Fruit tarts\nChoice of Chocolate tarts\nCreme Brulee\n\nTo start, I had the French Onion soup.  I'm not usually a French Onion soup kind of girl and I have no idea what provoked me to get it.  It came out  piping hot and quite tasty.  The Swiss cheese was full of flavor and the soup was a meal upon itself.  I wasn't able to finish it.  My friend had the Endive Salad and it was delicious...I'm tempted to make it at home!  The cheese with the walnuts and the endive and the nice touch of balsamic was such a fabulous combination together.  I would definitely get that again.\n\nFor my main, I went for the Cassoulet after learning it was \"a French country stew served in clay pots with a pastry shell 'lid'\".  I was a bit disappointed by the dish.  Digging among the beans, there lay a piece of garlic sausage and a piece of Toulouse sausage.  The flavors were all mixed in together and had no individual taste at all.  i don't remember tasting any duck confit either.  My friend had the steak and he finished the whole thing.  I would guess there were no complaints from him and I would say it's pretty hard to mess up a steak.  \n\nFor dessert, I went with the Chocolate Tart. They offered Chocolate Mandarin, Triple Chocolate and Chocolate Walnut.  Per the waiter's suggestion, I went for the Triple Chocolate.  It came with two dollops of cream and some chocolate sauce on the side.  It was tasty, not too heavy despite it being a triple chocolate dessert.  My friend had the Creme Brulee and I really enjoyed his.  I'm on the fence with creme brulee in general, but theirs had a extra nice sweetness that made me wanting more.  Next time I would go for the creme brulee, although it's a smaller portion.\n\nOverall, service was good. My water glass was never empty and we were asked repetitively if we wanted more bread. At one point, the waiter did bring our desserts while he was on the phone.  So, I watched him as he craned his neck to support the phone while carrying on his conversation and debating how he was going to serve our desserts and silverware.  In the end, my friend reached out to help him.  \n\nAtmosphere-wise, it started out really quiet and I enjoyed this. I was able to talk to my friend easily.  However, as the restaurant filled up, loud music started to play and I found myself shouting over to my friend.\n\nI'm not sure I would say this experience was worth what I paid.  I was a bit disappointed in the overall main course, but did enjoy my first course and dessert.", "author": "Teri C."}

My second visit definitely upped their rating. \n\nMy DAT date had...\n\nFrench onion soup: I love french onion soup and I loved their french onion soup. Oooooh onion-y goodness! Flavorful and not too salty. Definitely tastes like they took their sweet time cooking down the onions for this one. The thick, creamy layer of swiss cheese on top was so gooey and good.\n\nPork loin with lentils: I usually am NOT a fan of lentils but theirs were REALLLLLY good! The pork loin was ok. I have to say it was cooked perfectly. Very tender but not that flavorful.\n\nPear, apricot, orange tart: They FOR SURE make their own whipped cream! It wasn't like that sweet shit that melts into a sticky mess you get from the grocery store. Theirs was rich, creamy and SLIGHTY sweet. A perfect compliment for the super sweet tart.\n\nI got...\n\nEscargot: DROOOOL! The sauce had the perfect citrus flavor mixed in with the rich buttery goodness soaked up by the flakey puff pastry floating in the middle of tender escargot. \n\nSnapper: Moist inside, crispy outside. Light and sweet just like snapper should be! \n\nCreme brulee: MY FAVVVV part of the meal! Very vanilla-y and creamy and rich. Just the way creme brulee should be!\n\nOn my second visit I went with a group of about 8 friends. We had made reservations but the host told us they were running late and gave us a round of champage on the house. SWEET. What's better than booze?! FREE booze! Too bad we sat around for a good 20 minutes before they told us it would be yet ANOTHER 15 minutes before our table was ready. What did they do? Gave us YET another round of free champage. Anyways on to the food...\n\nGoat cheese tart: WOW. I could've eaten a whole XL pizza of this. Creamy tart cheese, fresh basil, slightly salty pancetta, sweet onions... seriously this alone gets a 10 outta 5 stars!\n\nDuck confit: Rich truffle oil soaked mashed potato mixed with crisp bacon with crisp bread crumbs on top smothering a bowl of yummy yummy tender, sweet duck. Another 10 outta 5 stars! Get this and the goat cheese tart if you go!!! \n\nSidenote: While eating dessert the owner gave us yet ANOTHER round of champage!

It comes out with lots of melted cheese and threatens to ruin the rest of your dinner because it's so filling. You won't want to leave any behind but you will. One fried got the bone marrow instead, which was also delicious. It wasn't just plain bone marrow, but dressed with other ingredients that cut through the richness.\n\nI had the fish, someone else had the beef, and another friend had two appetizer-sized tarts. One was mushroomy and the other cheesey. Everything was good. Hearty, but not overly rich food with great flavor combination.\n\nAnd then we split a slice of tart. Because you see various fruit and chocolate tarts in a fridge on your way to the bathroom and then you see them again walking back to your table. How can you say no? The service is also excellent. The restaurant is small but very atmospheric.\n\nThe restaurant is out of the way, but really close to the muni station. Just go up the hill and there it is.

I ordered the smoked Salmon while the rest of my party ordered entrees--mainly fish dishes.\n\nThe presentation was beautiful, of course, and it seemed as though my portion size--albeit expectantly small--was not that much less than the entrees.

I dismissed my previous expectations of hoity toity dishes, and also, the staff and the restaurant itself was cute and low-key (the chef comes out and greets each table). We each tasted one another's dishes, and I would say that my smoked salmon was the best. We only ordered a chocolate apricot tart and the Floating Island (kind of meringue-ish) for dessert.

We came here Saturday night reservations booked a week in advance for 6pm. Unfortunately, there was a large surprise party that was occupying half the restaurant downstairs so my family (party of 6) was escorted to the top upstairs. First off walking up those stairs is dangerous there is hardly any light and if my parents were any older I wouldn't feel comfortable making them walk that. \n\nAfter we were seated our waiter came to give us the menus and serve us water and bread. We all decided on sharing the entree size mussels for an appetizer with of course extra bread to soak up the goodness. I had the butter lettuce salad as an appetizer and my dad had the curry soup. All the starters were delicious. \n\nMom/Myself/Sisters Fiancee: Halibut = Do not order this...it did not have a good taste and was overly salted. The chopped up carrots below the fish was oily and unappetizing. I know you're probably thinking why we didn't just send it back and order something else..well ultimately we did not want to wait for another entree to come out considering our order took a long time to begin with. \n\nMy husband/Dad: Bacon Wrapped Veal Loin = The entree came with 3 little medallions with fingerling potatoes and veggies. It was just ok nothing really memorable about the dish. \n\nMy sister: Scallops = This is what I should have ordered. Very rich but my sister ate the whole thing and I was envying every bite. It also was very beautiful visually...like an art piece.\n\nAfter the waiter had delivered us our entrees. He kindly took our empty bottle of water and said he would bring back a new one. 10 mins go by...then 15....then 20...he doesn't even come to check back on us. We just sat there waiting for our water. By the time he came back he didn't even realize he forgot to bring it to us. As he scurried off to fetch the bottle....upon arriving to our table...I believe trying to make it up politely poured each of us our glass. If you are going to pour us water you should make sure it doesn't splash all over the place. \n\nI tried to give this place another chance but the service lacked AGAIN. We felt like we were pushed off into the corner and had to request things way too often. \n\nAlso...I hope they realize that people don't want to have to scream over music to talk to each other. Turn the music down!! We aren't deaf!! \n\nAnyhow, I won't be coming back here...It was surely disappointing that I pick this place to bring my dad for Father's Day.

We both enjoyed our appetizers. The french onion soup was souper hot and took me awhile to eat. The foie gras portions are french and so my boyfriend helped me  a bit with my soup :) Onto the entrees, he had the mussels and pommes frites ($18) and I had one of the two vegetarian options, the black trumpet souffle. I wasn't impressed by the souffle, there were about 4 slices of mushrooms throughout the whole thing and it was a little too eggy for my liking. They also didn't provide enough of the sauce for the souffle which I think compounded the eggy issue. The green beans that accompanied it were yummy (if you put enough butter on anything it'll be delicious ;). We couldn't pass up their acclaimed tarts and split the chocolate walnut tart ($6) and were not disappointed. \n\nIn all, I would give Chochou 3.5 stars - I thought they had a great french onion soup and dessert but was less than impressed by their entrees, at least for vegetarians.

The experience feels very French, but not stuffy like more traditional French restaurants.\n\nWhat Chouchou really excels at is its sauces. For starters, order the Escargot and the Wild Mushroom Tart. The sauce is freaking delicious!!! Apparently in France, butter is unsalted, so if that's not your cup of tea, just smear your bread on the leftover Escargot sauce. You will not be disappointed.\n\nI got the Monkfish Cassolette, which is kind of like a pot pie dish, but more brothy. It came with a hard bread shell, but a little too hard IMO, but the insides of the dish I have no complaints. The broth was rich, but not overly salty, the monkfish was moist and tender, not overcooked.\n\nAlso, if you decide to get the Mussels, order a side of fries with it too - perfect combo.\n\nMy one main issue with this place is its size. It's a small neighborhood restaurant, so it gets crowded fast. This is understandable, but I think they could stand to shed a table or two to alleviate this issue. My gf and I were seated uncomfortably between two other tables - the waiter even had to pull the table out just so I could walk to the inside seat against the wall.

Those high hopes were soon shattered when we arrived. \n\nWe made a reservation for a large party; probably a mistake since this place can fit about thirty people and we had a party of 18. Nevermind that. When we arrived at our given time, they did not have enough tables to accommodate us. They made room for us, though, by taking tables away from the other dinner party next to us. Awkward. \n\nThe menu was pretty standard; definitely nothing special. Pork chops, filet mignon, rack of lamb, sea bass, salmon. Same old, same old. I ordered the pork chop. It didn't look good; the pork chop had no char or grill marks. However, it was tasty for about three bites and suddenly turned really dry. My friends ordered the filet mignon and the rack of lamb. Both were overcooked and underwhelming. Our table inevitably ordered the same items, but each plate looked different. Inconsistent plating and portion size. \n\nThe french onion soup turned out to be interestingly flavored with what tasted like orange rind. Not orange zest...orange rind. It was definitely bitter. \n\nThe service was bad. The man taking our orders just hopped around the table in no particular order. And when the food arrived about 45 minutes later, we all scrambled to figure out whose dish was whose, including the waiter. Never was there an 'excuse me' or 'pardon' when a plate was placed down on the table. These people just don't seem good at their jobs. Maybe the large party threw them off, but we made reservations so they should have been prepared. \n\nAnd they charged $37.50 to cut a cake. Happy Birthday.", "author": "NickJess S."}

I trust their judgement when it comes to food because we've gone to a new restaurant each time I've visited and I've never been disappointed.\n\nThey were prepared for a feast.  We went in armed with 4 different bottles of wine - a bottle of Sauterne, a bottle of Chardonay, and 2 bottles of red wine.  The 3 of us ordered: 1) Steamed Mussels Marinieres, 2) Escargots \"a la Bourguignone\", 3) Home Made \"Rougi\u00e9-France\" Foie Gras Torchon, 4) Plum and Steak, 5) You and Me for Life (Lamb), and 6) Day Boat Scallops.  Each of the wine paired beautifully with each dish - even the owner sat down and tried each one of our wine and he loved it!  Normally, I'm not a big fan of lamb, but the way they cooked and seasoned it made it taste very tender and less musky.  The plum went very with the steak and wine and brought out a completely different flavor in the meat.  And the scallops were cooked just right with the right flavors to match with the chardonay.\n\nThis is a little hole in the wall kind of place so it's best to make reservations since there are not many tables available and people tend to sit for a very long time to enjoy the food.", "author": "Tieu-Y N."}

He hugged my date, and gave me two kisses on the cheek, one on each side. How French! Immediately I feel welcomed and part of the \"family.\"\n\nMust try:\nKobe steak tartare - prepared in front of you by the ma\u00eetre d'; a young French gentleman. In a bowl he mixes the Kobe, quail egg, a single drop of Worcestershire sauce, capers, pickles, garlic and pepper. It's then placed back on the plate and accompanied by freshly-made waffle chips. Delicious!\n\nFrisee salad - small salad with micro greens, diced tomato, crispy bacon bits (BACON BITS!!), mixed with a house vinaigrette, all topped with a small poached egg. If memory serves me right, I like poached eggs on top of a salad with meat in it(read: Foreign Cinema review).\n\nRack of Lamb - In anticipation of coming to Chouchou, I read over the menu the day before. The lamb dish had caught my eye and therefore I was looking forward to trying it. The lamb was cooked to medium-well and is deliciously pink inside. Accompanying the tender lollipops are mixed veggies (cooked veggies, green onions, mushrooms) tossed in a flavorful brown sauce.\n\nCheese plate - 2 goat cheeses, one cow's milk cheese and a blue cheese, all placed atop their individual topping (candied walnuts, quince jelly, dates). Delicious.\n\nOnce most of the customers had strolled away, tummies filled and lightheaded from the wine, we were offered an additional dessert and dessert wine! We had a slice of chocolate tart (?) with sliced almonds.\n\nThis has been one of the best dining experiences I've had. They are huge on hospitality and put you first above all else.

SF offers finest examples of the world cuisine with the notable exception of French (not to say that all of the French restaurants in France are doing a better job when it comes to a Cuisine).  I think, most of the local French establishments are guilty of the crime of  \"false pretenses\":  such as unusually long waits, awkward attempts to fake an accent, incomprehensible menu descriptions and the like.  \n\nThe truth is that Chouchou bistro is clearly exhibiting all of the above, coupled with the total lack of air and space inside their dining room.  However, it is still offers a different experience.  First of all, the food is way above average for this rather simple bistro-like place.  For starters, porcini mushrooms and sauted mussels were exceptional (it is not entirely clear from their menu, but yes, you can order their mussel entree \"appetizer-style\");and although tartar tuna was non-eventful, their foie gras made up for it.

We made a reservation for 8:30 on xmas eve cuz we got ousted by her family. borat  *high five*. /borat\n\nArrive at 8:25, plenty of parking even though the place was full.  Place was very quaint.  Oddball decorations but somehow it worked.  My SO said that they did a pretty good job of giving a french bistro scene.  Que magnifique!  Music was very frenchy though none of it had any cheesy accordians.  Guess the music was on a cd or something cuz after the 4th time i heard each song, the wine went sour.\n\nWe were seated up on the 2nd floor much to our delite.  The main floor seemed rather stuffy as your rubbing elbows with ur neighbors.  Best part of the ambiance was when the waiters made the banana flambe.  4 foot high flames warmed everyone around that cold nite.\n\nWaiter was a nice frenchy dood, complete with an accent and black attire.  We were expecting to order the xmas eve and xmas tasting menu for $55 per as stated at their website.  When we didn't see it on the menu, we inquired about it and our waiter said that it was only on xmas day that they were doing that.  Cheesy?  Yeah, pretty cheesy.  That would have been best as we would use the coupon and just pay $60.  Now we had to look at the menu and come up with a Benjamin's worth to eat.\n\nSoooooooooooooooooo, we ordered mussels appetizer, steak, the duck, glass of wine, coffee, 3 deserts, 2 cokes, and a partridge in a pear tree.  I rested assured that my SO can pretty much be the host of Woman vs Food.\n\nThe entree's came out separtely and I was given veal.  I told the food runner that I had ordered steak so he took it back to the frenchy waiter.  He came by and confirmed that I had ordered steak and stated that it wasn't his fault.  Rather comical, cuz the coupon we had automatically factored in 18% gratuity, but I believe he was genuinely sorry for it.  He came by later with the veal in a to-go box.\n\nThe food:\n\nThe mussels, someone earlier reviewed it was average.  I found the mussels to be the best I've ever had.  Maybe I haven't been around as much but these were softer than clams and not rubbery as everyone else makes it.  The white wine cream sauce was spot on.  Again, subtle and not overly creamy or replete with wine.  I wanted to wrap the left over sauce to go but apparently in France, they don't do that.\n\nSteak seemed like a thick skirt steak. It was fairly tender.  The blue cheese dip wasn't overbearing and the peppercorn cause was savory.  The french fries or le pommes frites would have been tasty if it wasn't over salted.  It seems though every restaurant over salts their fries.  CHEFS, STILL KILL THE FRIES!\n\nThe duck was fat and juicy.  Pretty much a flavor explosion.  The skin was perfectly crisp.  The chorizo seemed to have trapped smoke in it cuz when I took a bite, the flavor was endless.\n\nThe desserts were fairly good.  Banana flambe was a bit burned.  The vanilla creme brulee was delicious.  The 3rd desert was forgettable, forgot what it was, some floating crap in a cup of cream.\n\nThe total came out to be $97 but the waiter was kind enough to let us off without making us order over $100.  Food was 4 starsish, the place was about 4, and the wrong order thing/false advertising was 3.  Rounded up.  Chouchou, your food wasn't doodoo, 4 stars.", "author": "Dirk M."}

We were sat next to a very loud table and were unable to carry on a conversation.  The people next to us had drink menus, but we weren't given them - perhaps we were meant to read over our neighbor's shoulders?  The servers tended to vanish for huge amounts of time.  We had to walk our credit card up to the bar to wait.\n\nOur food was just bad.  We ordered the quiche, which provided the opportunity to play an exciting game of \"can you find the egg?\" The dish was essentially a pop tart made out of puff pastry and filled with copious amounts of melted cheese.  A LOT of melted cheese.  There was allegedly some bacon in there, but I cannot confirm that claim.  We also had the french onion soup.Again, a ton of melted cheese and not much else.  \nTo give credit where credit is due, the staff seemed to realize something was amiss as they provided us with a number of very tasty croissants to take home with us.\nI'd be willing to go back and investigate dinner as I've heard it's amazing, but I'm in no hurry to go back for brunch.", "author": "She-Ra .."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-10", "description": "My next Dine About Town adventure was Chouchou, a French restaurant. If you arrive early, take a stroll up Dewey Blvd & check out how the houses are landscaped, it's a very nice looking neighborhood. Also notice you're across the street from Laguna Honda Hospital, convenient if you happen to suffer a heart attack from all the butter.\n\nChouchou has their own parking lot next to the restaurant, but MUNI's Forest Hill railway station is only a block away from the restaurant. If you plan to drink, or just want a fun evening riding the trains, take MUNI! This MUNI station appears as a small building at street level, surprisingly nice looking.\n\nThe building Chouchou occupies is old. It needs renovation. The front glass door doesn't close well, so front of restaurant tables can be drafty. Chouchou tries to insulate the draft with curtains, which doesn't work well as people enter & leave the restaurant. This needs to be fixed.\n\nThe downstairs dining area is packed with tables, all full. Waiters moved swiftly from table to table. I was seated upstairs. The stairs are small, so be careful. It's hot up there; the restaurant needs more fans.\n\nNow, on to the food. My first course was escargot. Yes, snails! I'd never had them before, and I explained to the waiter that he was going to have to show me how to eat them without firing snail shells all over the downstairs diners ala Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. The chef cooks them in butter, with a topping of chopped shallot, garlic, and parsley. This is proof that enough butter can make anything delicious, and these certainly were. The snails take up the flavors of what they're cooked with. The waiter showed me how to grasp the shells with that spring-loaded double-sided escargot spoon, then you pull them out of the shell with a small fork. I can see how if you grab them wrong with the spoon, or don't release the spring slowly, those escargot are airborne. Vivian, I feel your pain, even though I still don't think this comedic scene sanitizes your film enough to air on ABC Family.\n\nNext, I had the duck leg wellington. I've had beef wellington before, delicious beef cooked in puff pastry. What arrived at the table was unexpected: it appeared to be a plate with a regular duck leg & thigh, bones & all, on top of some sauteed cubed potato, halved cherry tomatoes, & chard with garlic & parsley. I was at first disappointed, because I thought there would be no puff pastry. As I cut into this dish with my knife, I realized what the chef had done. He had excellently cooked the duck leg & thigh until they were fall-off-the-bone tender, and removed the skin. He then covered the duck in mushroom duxelle, minced mushroom, onion, shallot & herbs sauteed in butter. He then wrapped that in puff pastry, forming the pastry to the shape of the duck leg. The menu also mentions maple vinaigrette & orange oil, which probably give the puff pastry some flavor, and act as the browning agent in the oven, so the puff pastry darkens to a color similar to that of the duck itself. As you saw into this dish, you raise your fork with these beautiful color & flavor layers of browned cooked with a hint of sweetness pastry, white inner puff pastry, black earthy mushroom, rich dark meat duck. And it tastes marvelous. I haven't been this enthused about a dish in a long time, it is a revelation, complicated construction, beautifully crafted, visually stunning, tender & delicious, and demonstrates a master chef. My hat off to you sir.\n\nFor dessert, I vacillated between chocolate mousse or creme brulee. I'm glad I went with the creme brulee, it was fantastic. Perfect brazed crunchy top, sweet & smooth dessert.\n\nService was excellent. I never had to once ask for my water glass to be refilled, it just always was, sometimes without me even noticing it. There were a couple delays in between courses, but I just assumed it was because they were being prepared. Nothing about this meal struck me as simple, and difficult things take some time.\n\nI had a glass of pinot gris with my meal, which went well, but I wish I'd got a glass of red. I think you need red wine to stand up to this much butter. I've eaten quite a few Dine About Town meals, and I think my body is reaching its butter limit. I feel a little off today; my body is craving fresh veggies with no rich butter or sauces. I'm taking a couple days off from reviewing before starting on my next batch.\n\nIn deciding on stars, I have to ask myself: how much do you let a few problems with the building the restaurant is in define the review? The front door & hot/cold/drafty areas need some work. The review, however, is about the food, the waitstaff, and your resultant happiness with the whole meal. I think you could pick up these people, put them in a nicer building, and you would have arguably one of the finest restaurants in the city. For that reason, I give chouchou 5 stars. And I suggest to you, don't be afraid to try new things!\n\n- Adam", "author": "Adam M."}

The service was ok, very typical of European style service so I think that's fine in a French restaurant. The tables were very close together, but again, it's a European thing so it didn't bother me. \n\nThe food was good, but not great. The escargot was really good, especially the sauce. Both the lamb chop and duck entrees were ok, but not especially good. We didn't try any desserts. \n\nMy big complaint would be that they are in the wrong price category. They should have $$$, not $$. Figure about $100 for two people. For that price I think that Chez Papa in Potrero Hill is far better.", "author": "Tonie C."}

This place used to be amazing, but it's gone downhill, and I can no longer recommend it in good conscience -- especially for the price.  Food was generally unremarkable in a way it didn't used to be, and wine selection (at least by the glass) is mediocre. The waitstaff and host(esse)s are a bright spot in an otherwise forgettable experience.  We happened to have a ridiculous wait for our courses on Valentine's Day, but even disregarding that factor, I can no longer recommend what was once a bright spot in this part of town.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-02", "description": "This is SUCH a charming place!  The first star that I'm giving this place is for the service and atmosphere.  It's charming, intimate, and the French man who greets you is extremely friendly and cheerful.  He has the most contagious smile, and he makes you feel like you're home.  This place definitely knows how to treat its guests well, and that is so important for making the customer feel comfortable and welcome.  I love it.\n\nSecond, the bread.  Oh my goodness, the bread.  My cousin said that someone on Yelp described it as \"Ratatouille Bread\" and that person is most definitely CORRECT!! Just grab a piece and crunch it! It makes THE SOUND!  The sound of good, crunchy bread!  The bread was so good, we kept eating it and eating it; they had to refill our bread basket THREE times because we were such greedy, hungry little girls who kept eating and eating the delicious bread, scattering crumbs all over the table.  I felt like I was 5 years old, but that's okay.  The bread was THAT good.  Another sparkly, shiny star for the bread!\n\nNow, another star for tasty mussel appetizer with fries.  The mussels came in this creamy sauce that goes really well with the bread.  They give you a good amount of mussels too; tender, delicious, morsels of sea animal! Yum!  And the fries are SO GOOD I couldn't stop eating.  Crispy, crispy, crispy.  All you want to do is keep grabbing them and stuffing them into your mouth because they're so tasty.  \n\nNow, onto the entrees.  Half a star for the entrees.  I had the special during the week of Christmas, which was sole cooked in a plumy, red wine sauce.  The sauce was waaaay too sour, but the sole was cooked to a perfect consistency and well-seasoned.  It was nice and light, overall.  I liked it, but it wasn't mind-blowing.  My foodmates ordered the duck leg confit, which was smokey and delicious; and my other foodmate ordered the pork tenderloin, which I thought was tasty but also not earth-shatteringly good.  Respectable, though.  All in all, the entrees were tasty and came in good portions, but nothing too amazing.\n\nNow, onto desserts!  We ordered two tarts: a chocolate pear tart, and a mixed fruit tart.  I'm not a big fan of chocolate, but I'll admit the chocolate one was creamy and sinful and flavorful and yummy.  I liked the mixed fruit tart more; the crust was crispy and you could taste a bit of the baked sugar in it, which gave it a nice, crispy crunch.  They put a good number of apricot and pear slices on top too; I liked that!  Another half a star for the desserts!  \n\nOverall, 4 stars for a very cute French bistro!  Good service, friendly and warm waiters, GREAT bread and appetizers, good entrees and desserts!  It's also in a quieter part of town, nestled right in a neighborhood, which I like much better than the hustle and bustle of being downtown.  It's a little on the pricey side, but I think it's standard for French food, and appropriate since it's good quality eats.  \n\nVery much recommended!", "author": "Vivian C."}

The floors had clumps of wadded up paper and I don't know what else everywhere.  The counters and stoves were a huge sloppy mess.  I told the minnions back there to clean it up - the looked at me blankly.\n\nFilthiest bathroom I've seen since the last time I used a gas station men's room.  The sink was backed up and spilling on to the floor, which was covered with rubber mats (the kind with holes in them that chefs stand on) probably for a reason - the toilet was also backing up.  The water level on the floor was so high it was nearly reaching the top of the holes.   Soggy rolls of toilet paper were all that was available.  I can't even bring myself to think about how they got soggy.  Disgusting.  I pointed this out to a waiter as I left and he laughed at me!  I had to wash off the soles of my shoes when I got home.\n\nDinner was upstairs in this unbelievably narrow and very scary balcony. I can't believe that the fire Marshall or the building inspectors allow this.   I felt like I was doing to fall over board and onto diners below.  The noise up there is deafening, ear splitting - I shoved bits of toilet paper in my ears which made me completely not able to participate in my group's gathering.  Then they put on music on top of the loud noise.  Anyone know a good audiologist?  Seriously, my ears are ringing 12 hours later, It would have been quieter (and more fun) standing in front of the speakers at a Metallica concert.\n\nThe California Garden Tart was as disastrous as my trip to the bathroom.  The crust was tasteless (I'm all about crust, come on over for some of my pie or my pizza)  It was stacked with undercooked vegetables like zucchini.  Just horrible.\n\nI ordered a filet mignon that was to be wrapped in pastry dough.  But what I got wasn't in pasty dough, and it was cooked well done!  I was never asked how I wanted my meat cooked - I assumed the chef knows how best to cook meat and serves it that way.  Since it was well done I sent it back and 4 times I told the waiter RARE.  He didn't believe me. I kept insisting.  What they brought was was medium rare, closer to medium.  \n\nWith this tasteless piece of $25 filet mignon was a mysterious and strange flying saucer shaped potato \"thing\" which was also tasteless - other than salt.  \n\nMany of their dishes have stupid names which is nearly as annoying as the decibel level.\n\nAs others have mentioned the chef goes around being social and kissing women.

After a long wait, I finally had an opportunity  when I suggested this place for a friend's 30th birthday.  Having built myself a reputation amongst my friends as the \"yelp guy\", I was putting my rep on the line.  And as much as it pains me to say so, I think I missed a little on this one.  My experience may have been influenced by the fact that we were a large group of 16 people, which may have affected how food was sent out.  \n\nAfter perusing the menu, I ended up ordering the rack of lamb which came highly recommended by our server as well as a few friends, the escargot \"a la bourguignone\" as an appetizer as well as a bottle of pinot.  The escargot was excellent.  It was so garlic-ey, butter-ey and  shallot-ey.  A dish that I would definitely order again.  However, when the main attraction came the first thing I noticed was that my rack of lamb was overcooked.  There was little to no pink left in the meat, which was really disappointing.  The meat was definitely on the dry side, though the flavors were good.  It was an unfortunate occurrence that marred what could have been a very promising meal.  However, the dish was plentiful which gets bonus points.  \n\nThe service however was friendly and quick.  There was, however an odd moment where the chef walked out from the kitchen to tell us that they were going to turn our the lights for the next hour in observance of Earth Day, even though Earth Day was still a few weeks away.  So during our meal, the only lighting available was provided by a few candles.  While it set an interesting mood, it made it hard to tell what your food looked like.  The lights did eventually come back on after we were done with the meal.  It didn't really adversely affect the meal, it was just an unusual experience.

The only way the anger could have been soothed was if the food was GOOD. It was. Yay!\n\nAMBIANCE: it was rowdy, but not so loud that we couldn't have a conversation (we were seated upstairs). The layout of the restaurant is pretty tight, so I can understand when people complain about being elbow to elbow with their neighbors. However, since we were upstairs, we had our own little bubble of space (the walkway is only wide enough to fit one table + room for walking by), which was nice and cozy. I think this would be an amazingly fun place to have dinner with a larger group of friends (4+... we saw several large groups having dinner here), but still cute enough for a date (saw several couples out on dates). \n\nSERVICE: Nick, the chef/owner, greets you warmly at the door-- double cheek greet for the ladies and a nice strong handshake for the gents. Although the servers are busy every single second running plates/glasses/etc back and forth to tables, they were excellent multitaskers.

We arrived 15 minutes late on our reservation and were still greeted with warm smiles and an available table. We were seated upstairs which I really liked as we could see all the action and it was a bit more quiet. The food was delicious. The 3 of us split the escargot to start. The were plump and tender little suckers with a nice sauce to go with. The we had the mussels and fries, the halibut, and the lamb. Each of these dishes was executed well not the best I have ever had of any but certainly tasty and worth the money. I really liked how the tuna was buried beneath my halibut and the mussels were in abundance. They dont skimp on the food here and for a price of $14 I couldnt be anymore happy. I think the most expensive entree on the menu is around $24. \n\nOutstanding value, good food, and friendly service!", "author": "Michael B."}

It was nice and tender and not at all dry, but the sauce was a little sweet for my tasting.  the deserts weren't memorable.  they were ok.  got the tart and the jelly on top smelled and tasted nice.  I can see how the food can be a bit hit or miss.  I overheard a patron saying that the hanger steak was super fatty and the chef overheard and came to join the conversation.

So, after a workout together, we decided to come for brunch on a Sunday.  If you're not here before noon, you might find it challenging to find a table.  \n\nGF ordered a mocha and the waitress presented her with this tiny cup, an espresso.  So, she had to take it back and remake the mocha & GF wasn't happy about the lack of \"foam\" on her ginormous cup of mocha ($3)  She's dined here enough to know better.  The French bagette was hot out of the oven and was scrumptious with butter.  They don't bake their own, it's from Bakers of Paris but they crisp it nicely in the oven.  \n\nI really enjoyed my slice of quiche, oozing with Guyere' cheese and ham ($9.50).  It came with delicious oven roasted potatoes (but heavy on the salt) and a cup of salad and 2 strawberries.  I had to take some of it home.  She had the parisienne, a mushroom omelet with potatoes too ($9).  The chef/owner came out to greet his guests and give a hug to his regulars.\n\nWe each took 4 croissants to go.  She had 4 choc  ($3) and I had 2 choc and 2 plain ($2).  When I got home and looked at the bill carefully,  I realized the waitress had overcharged us an extra 2 croissants and the tax  to boot.   The food is good, but pay attention carefully to your bill.  Food's good but based on my experience last yr and this year, they clearly have staff training issues.  I love their tarts and if you want a whole one $28), it has to be pre-ordered.\n\nA few days later, I called to tell them about the overcharge & the owner answered the phone & told me that he would be more than glad to refund the overcharge. I told him it would just be simplier to come and get the 2 croissants paid for, that's all I wanted.  Had to send Jr. Yelper to go pick it up with the receipt because I was busy and the owner was so nice, he gave us 4 croissants; 2 were chocolate which was rapidly devoured by the Jr. Yelpers.  That's what I call service and class.  I plan to bring the whole family back for dinner one day because the owner really cares about the service.  Just that the staff probably could use a tad more training.   Good help is hard to find.", "author": "Ry T."}

The escargot is presented inside this bone marrow which is very unique and nice, but does nothing for its taste. The sauce was way too salty.\n\nI ordered the filet mignon which for 25 bucks was the size of my small fist. It was completely tasteless. Juicy, but completely tasteless. Potato gratin also came on the side but i've never ate it before so I can't give a good review on it, but i wasn't able to finish all of it.\n\nAt the end of the dinner, both my dad and I wanted to try the souffle. Hey you think french restaurant, souffle right? No souffles here, only tarts.\n\nThe service was the highlight of the evening. The chef comes out and asks you how the meal was, cleans up the table.

Unfortunately it fell short of expectations.  \n\nWhile I expect french food to be pricey in general, places like Fleur De Lys deliver.  This was not the case with Chouchou.  While the food was certainly not bad, it really wasn't good either.  I found my steak to be tough and over seasoned - likely due to what seemed like 8 hours they took too cook it.  I believe my date really enjoyed her mussels, and on the plus side, the portions on that specific dish were quite generous.  Overall though, while there was nothing really 'bad' about the place, the price was simply not on par with the product.  I have no intention of going back.", "author": "Mystery V."}

A bit difficult to navigate through the hilly and foggy streets and parking was not exactly plentiful (we got lucky that night), but once you step inside it is a small cozy little establishment that immediately warms you. \n\nSince we've mistakenly just finished up with happy hour, we were not as hungry as we should've been. We decided with all seafood to keep it light: tuna tartare, scallops, and the halibut. Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly...with delicious accompanying sauces and veggies to fill you up. Portions were a bit small for the price, so it is definitely not an everyday kind of restaurant. Our server told us their tarts were all made in-house and highly recommended the apricot, so I gave in and ordered a slice. Sadly, I was disappointed. The crust was dense instead of light and flaky and there was no cream or custard or any type of filling besides the apricots. I've definitely had better tarts elsewhere. \n\nIf only their desserts were a bit more inventive or appealilng because everybody knows that is the BEST part of the meal! \n\nStill, 4 stars because I enjoyed ChouChou very much due to the simple food and fantastic serviice.", "author": "Vivian D."}

We had a reservation for a large party at 8:00 pm. The first 5 of us arrive punctually, and we were standing around for 5 minutes before being acknowledged.  OK so we weren't within the normal older demographic that I observed around us, but dang!  Manager finally approaches us and says, \"You're early.\"  We reply, It's 8:05, we all pull out our phones in synchrony...He half chuckles, well my watch is broken, see?  OK.......so he leaves and a waiter comes back in another 5 to tell us, they are setting up our table.  When everyone arrives, we sit and sit and sit....when are they going to take our order?  So, we flagged the manager down, and requested the checks to be split prior to ordering so there is no confusion when it comes time to pay.  He agrees, and takes the orders accordingly.\n\n30 more minutes pass and we ask about bread...Manager's reply: \"It's baking.\"  UHHHH for 30 minutes??!  I wondered if they were watching the yeast rise or something, but I'm not a big complainer and we were in good company, so more patient waiting...So the bread comes out, and then we wait FOREVER for food.  Dishes came out in piecemeal, first cohort, 4 dishes, 2nd cohort, 2 etc...We were all trying to be polite and wait for everyone's food to come out before eating.  However, after the long wait, we decided, the people that got their food should eat before it gets cold.  One chicken dish was under-cooked, but he ate it b/c he didn't want to wait another 25-30 minutes to have it sent back and cooked.  Three people were waiting for their dishes as we all were almost done with our food.  We asked the waitress about these dishes, and her reply, \"You got separate checks so they were confused in the back...\"  Hubby made a good point: If you had four separate tables, you would have separate orders/checks....doesn't make sense.  I got my food and he didn't...\n\nWhen those dishes finally came out, it was cooked all wrong; medium was medium rare; one steak was well done instead of medium well.  Then came time to pay, which they were more than speedy with bringing out checks.  They overcharged one of our friends.  For two of us, we paid $52 for a mushroom and cheese soufle (good in the first few bites) and a undercooked steak.\n\nThey always say that service makes a big difference, and this experience was no bueno.", "author": "Steph W."}

Chouchou was on the list and we jumped for it.\n\nChouchou isn't all that big of a restaurant in terms of space. A lot of patrons are tightly seated together and so are the tables. Because of the size of the restaurant, it could get really noisy. \n\nThe owner of the restaurant came out to greet us with a firm handshake for me and a kisses for my fiancee. Just a little warning for those who are not familiar with the French culture and prefer their bubble of space kept to yourself. It might be awkward, but it's their culture.\n\nDown to the food! We ordered the Mussels, French Onion soup and Frisse Salad for appetitzers, Filet Mignon and Salmon for entree, and Strawberries Bruscetta and a dessert with an assortment of red fruit and ice cream (it has a long name and it's not on the menu).\n\nThe Mussels top the list of everything we ordered! When you see it, you'll be taken away by the strong smell of garlic and each mussel is decently sized although some are the size of oysters! Each piece isn't rubbery, but soft and plump. The broth that it was swimming was excellent! Good to dip your bread in! \n\nThe Salmon was a little fishy, but it wasn't dry. Filet Mignon was tender and juicy; melt in your mouth goodness! The sauce that it came with might be a little too strong for my taste. Both desserts were good, but the bruscetta is a deal-sealer! \n\nOverall, it was a great experience, but do not walk out without trying the mussels!

Super moist and soft for that cut of steak and the truffle blue cheese sauce was great with the steak! Medium rare was really medium rare, not over or under cooked. Dessert, well i expected the chocolate mousse to be a lot better but it wasn't awful. It was more on the heavy side and instead of semi sweet it was really sweet.

Don't get me wrong I luuurv bacon, but I ordered a salad with bacon--not a bacon salad.  \n\nThe main entree was  standard mussels and frites.  The frites were unremarkable, but still crunchy and plentiful.  The mussels were delicious!  Nice and plump in a creamy buttery sauce.  \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the strawberry bruschetta.

Completely bland and tasteless.  The pear tart was delish and tasted fresh.\n\nWe ordered a few bottles of wine and closed down the restaurant.

One dish in particular, a rack of lamb with mushroom sauce, was one of the best things I've ever ordered - at Chouchou, or anywhere! Perfectly cooked and expertly seasoned, for less than $25. You simply cannot beat that. And, as always, you will be treated like family by owner/chef Nick and his staff. Every time I visit he acts like we are old friends!\n\nGo to Chouchou. It's a wonderful surprise on an otherwise blah corner near Forest Hill station.", "author": "Beth T."}

The service was very good, maybe a little too attentive to us almost on the side of \"European friendly\" which by American standards can be read as pervy.  LOL.  But overall, the wait staff was very nice and they treated us and other patrons like old friends and so it felt very \"French\".  They had a guy playing on an accordion live and that was also quite lovely as an accordion can sound.\n\nThe place got louder as the night wore on but the food was above average but just not amazing and I wonder if it was because I was still full from lunch in the Mission.  I got the lamb which was nicely cooked atop a bed of crispy potatoes and a savory mushroom sauce.  It was all pretty decent.  My friend ordered the halibut, which was also cooked nicely as far as I could taste, it was a tiny bit on the bland side.  But still enjoyable.  I think the creme brulee was delicious.  Crispy on top and smooth and cool inside.  Perfect.\n\nWith that said, I would most likely go back but be totally hungry and ready to devour not just nibble.

I came here for dine about town with two of my girlfriends not knowing what to expect.  This restaurant is pretty out of the way in a residential area and in a line of 5 store fronts which include a sushi restaurant, Westernized-Chinese restaurant, tarot fortune teller and gym/workout center.  Very random.  What we didn't expect was a very cute, romantic French restaurant.  The waiter was a legit French man and was very nice.  We asked for mimosas which was not on the menu but he decided to make some for us.  That's a plus for service.  I ordered the mussels and expected the portion size to be small just because most places are cheap with the quantity when it comes to seafood, BUT I utterly surprised about the amount I got.  I think I might have gotten about 30-40 mussels!  Whoa....awesome I didn't just get 15.  The mussels were great and I would love to come back for a romantic dinner!", "author": "Shirley T."}

Here are our thoughts.\n\nFirst of all, this restaurant has very friendly and attentive service.  The wait staff made our experience better than that it would've been.  The busboy was notably efficient.  If there shall be a first time for everything, this shall be my first time commenting on a busboy on Yelp.  Yes, the busboy was a standout that night. \n\nNow on to the food.  The appetizers were excellent.  The escargot and mussels met all of our expectations stemmed from all the raves on Yelp.  But unfortunately after that, the entrees and desserts were disappointing.  From 5-star appetizers, the rest of the evening took a nose dive to 3-star (if even) entrees and dessert.  The cassolette was bland and the duck leg was not spectacular.  The potatoes that came with the duck however were very good.  The truffle oil on them leaves this lingering goodness that makes you lick your teeth to savor the flavor even longer.  The \"mandarin\" chocolate tart was a little \"misleading\".  We thought there would be more mandarins on the tart.  Instead there were just 3 very very thin slivers on the top of a really rich chocolate tart.  I was hoping for something fruitier than that as the name suggested.  \n\nSince the appetizers were so excellent, next time we will order a bunch of them instead and pass on the entrees.", "author": "Irene T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-09", "description": "This is a charming restaurant with great service in a wonderful neighborhood.  So why only three stars?  Unfortunately, the food fell a bit short.\n\nThis Saturday night, the place was totally packed.  But we were quickly and politely ushered to a table near the front of the restaurant.  The place is charming but a little uncomfortable.  First of all, it was a typical San Francisco 60 degrees outside, but sweltering inside despite two big ceiling fans going full-speed.  (At one point during the meal, the gf had to tell me to wipe beads of sweat off my forehead.)  Second of all, the place is loud when full and the tables quite close together (we were separated from tables to our right and left by about six inches, so the table had to be moved to get to our seats).  But the pleasant French bistro decor and the excellent service mostly made up for it.\n\nTo start, we shared the French Onion Soup and the Goat Cheese Tart, which had been so highly praised by other Yelp reviewers.  The French Onion Soup was indeed outstanding, slightly sweet with a good onion flavor and nice gruyere cheese on the croutons.  (I still like the soup at Chapeau! better, but this was excellent.)  The goat cheese tart was a bit bland and underseasoned -- a bit of salt judiciously applied during prep would have gone a long way. \n\nFor our entrees, the gf had the halibut and I had the beef cheeks cassoulet.  The halibut was probably the highlight of the night, perfectly cooked and surprisingly moist, with a sinfully delicious butter sauce.  It was served with a leek gratin which the gf loved and I thought could have used a little more carmelization on the leeks.\n\nThe beef cheeks cassoulet was served pot-pie style, with a bread dome the consistency of a pizza crust (not a puff pastry) which made for a beautiful presentation and a surprisingly nice crunch around the edges.  I had never had beef cheeks before and found them disappointingly fatty (not necessarily the restaurant's fault, just may be my taste).  But again this dish was a bit underseasoned, and the onions, potatoes, mushrooms, and carrots in the dish unevenly prepared and cooked.  The sauce looked rich and delicious, but it too was bland.  I came away with that \"not worth the calories\" feel.\n\nAt this point in the meal, we were hovering between three and four stars (yes, we were plotting our Yelp review from the start) and decided to let dessert be the tiebreaker.  We ordered the much-praised chocolate and pear tart.  We were expecting a fruit tart with chocolate, but instead this was a very rich chocolate torte with little pieces of pear occasionally hidden within.  Unfortunately, the torte was also a little grainy and unimpressive.  Between the two of us we still left half the dessert behind.\n\nThe wine list has good variety and some nice selections by the glass.  I chose a white bordeaux for the gf and the waiter recommended an easy-drinking red bordeaux for me.  Both were excellent food-friendly wines that went well with our meal and were very reasonably priced.\n\nThe service throughout the meal was attentive and polite.  It was quite good for San Francisco and exceptional by French standards!  The waiter was always at-the-ready, our water glasses consistently full, the food and the bill arrived promptly, and overall we felt well taken-care-of but unrushed.  The prices were extremely reasonable -- with two appetizers, two entrees, two glasses of wine, a dessert, tax, and tip, we still got out for just over $100.  That was quite a bargain.\n\nI can see why locals would love this place.  It's nestled in an affluent residential neighborhood with probably enough people in walking distance to sustain this restaurant for a long time.  It's a pleasant enough place with an interesting menu and great service.  If we lived near this 'hood, we'd probably be regulars.  But by the standards of this great restaurant town, Chouchou is only ok.  When the French bistro craving strikes us, we'll probably go back to Chapeau!, Clementine, or Le Charm instead.", "author": "Steve B."}

And SUPER lucky for us that was the perfect time to go, before the rush came in.\n\n1) Service was fantastic!  Yes, it was crazy packed with 150+ reservations that night but our waiter was so amazing and attentive.  Even when the rush came at 7:30pm...we only had to remind him once about our check and then he was on it.  He even gave the women in his section roses.  And when I asked the woman at the desk where the restroom was, she held my hand and guided me to \"les toilettes\".\n\n2) Ambiance was charming and the best seats are on the 2nd floor.  It can get a bit cramped on the ground floor, so we were grateful they sat us upstairs overlooking the 1st floor. \n\n3) Food was a fixed menu for Valentines Day.  I spent some time in Paris, so I was looking forward to some French food.  I had the steak and my date had the duck.  I'm not a huge duck person but it was very moist and the sauce was great.  The steak was good, not great...but the truffle sauce made up for it.  The Vanilla Cr\u00e8me Brulee was my favorite part. \n\n4) Music!  Okay,  I might be biased because 1) we were lucky to dine before the V-day rush and 2) the music selection for the first 2 hours felt like we had our own personal song list playing.  They played 2 of our favorite songs!  That was the cherry on the top....so worth every cent.", "author": "Miss M."}

It's oddly located and the space is a little bit weird, but the food is satisfying French fare for the common folk.  While this isn't haute cuisine, it's good, substantial, and fresh.\n\nI joined a recently married friend out to dinner on our first post-marriage outing for him.  I appreciated that they have a vegetarian section on the menu, however small it may be (it only has two entrees).  There are a handful of appetizers that were vegetarian-friendly as well.  \n\nWe started off with ahi-tuna on taro chips.  My days of eating any kind of fish are numbered, and this was the first time I've eaten fish in months.  It was surprisingly fresh, crisp, and flavorful - deceptively simple with a dollop of creme fraiche.  Surprisingly good.  I had wanted to get the wild mushroom tart, but because I ordered the morell mushroom souffle, we opted for this instead.\n\nThe morell mushroom souffle was excellent with a vermouth sauce on the side.  The portion was modest, but it was cooked-to-order and served piping hot.  My married mate ordered a seafood cassoulet, which he was surprised he enjoyed so much (I didn't try it, as I don't eat monkfish, tiger prawns, or bacon).  Normally, he says, he orders a lamb cassoulet but alas it was not being prepared on this eve.  The cassoulet, too, was brought to the table hot and crisp, just like Napoleon would have wanted. \n\nFor dessert -- which I ordinarily don't order -- we each got a slice of tart; he ordered the apricot and I, the chocolate almond.  He raved about the tarts and insisted I try one.  I'm not normally a dessert person, and after eating the tart at Chouchou, I remain unmoved.  I wouldn't order the tart again.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't earth-shattering.  Occasionally, though rarely, one meets a tart that blows one's mind.  This was no such tart.\n\nThe service was delightful.  The server was a Japanese-French-English sweetheart who tended to us beautifully.  Her recommendations were sound and she generously offered us a dessert wine on the house to pair with our dessert tarts.  When my friend asked to bring a piece of tart home for his recently-wedded bride, the server simply gave it to him without charge.  I was surprised by the genuine generosity of the wait-staff.  While I certainly would never expect such gratuities were I to return, I appreciated the hospitality.  We felt like guests.\n\nWe ordered a half-bottle of wine to accompany our meal.  With tax and tip, the meal was about $120.  So, it's not a cheap dinner by any regard, but it was substantial.  Without wine and dessert, the meal would have been considerably less (perhaps $70 in total), though, perhaps, the experience would have been less as well.\n\nI'd return.  It's a delightful place.", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

There really isn't even any room to check in with the hostess. Literally, you are standing on top of people who are seated near the entrance to the restaurant. After waiting a while, the hostess finally tells us we can sit but it's the worst table so we politely ask to sit at another open table. Total attitude so my friend talked to the guy who looked to be in charge (owner?) and we were seated at the table we wanted.\n\nThe food was totally awesome. Totally worth the wait, attitude, and the money. I had the mussels to start-- it was a huge portion and were so delicious. My friend got the escargot and I  tried it---so good! Our bfs got the organic salad and the crab salad and looked happy. We then ordered entrees-- my bf got the fillet (said it was better than the one at Ruth's Chris we had the night before), my friend got the souffle, and her bf and I got the duck wellington. They brought out 3 ducks and my friend says \"sorry, I had the souffle\" to which the waiter says \"are you sure?\". lol He then brings out the duck back to her and says that they would like for her to enjoy the duck while she waits for the souffle (score!). The duck was great, covered in finely chopped mushrooms and baked in filo dough. The rude hostess then stops by and asks if we are done. Umm...nope still eating, thanks. We then got the cream brulee which was a little too sweet but very good.

Ok well...I guess if you count the cockroach that decided to drop in on our table...we could call it a party of 9.  If the cockroach had better timing, he could have dropped in on a nice dish of escargot.  Instead, he tried to drop in on our friends wine and missed by a few inches.  At this point, I was hoping the food and service would be top notch to eradicate our experience with Mr. McCockroach.  \n\nThe Dine About Town pre fixe menu was $35.  As the only Asian with Chinese blood at our table, I wanted to get the best value out of this meal.  Not only did I want the best value...I wanted a main course that would fill my tummy...MEAT.  I'm a meat man, so I ordered the Filet Mignon for the main course, Frisee salad appetizer, and the Red Fruit w/ ice cream dessert.  To be honest, the highlight of my dinner was the Frisee salad and the complementary bread.  The Frisee salad was loaded with real pancetta and a poached egg.  Once you break open the poached egg, it tastes wonderful with the vinaigrette and pancetta combination.  I used the complementary bread to absorb the remaining vinaigrette from my bowl and that was mighty scrumptious.  \n\nThe Filet Mignon was juicy and tasty, but it didn't amaze me.  I was fairly disappointed with the main course portion.  I don't think I'm over exaggerating because my friend's Fettuccine that came with his Salmon looked like pencil shavings.  I'm pretty sure he was still hungry after we left the restaurant.  I know you're thinking \"it's a French restaurant...the portions are normally small...stop being a cheap bastard Brian.\" My honest opinion is...if the food was breathtaking then it's totally worth it.  My first visit fell slightly short to what I expected.     \n\nWhat stood out during our visit to Chouchou was the service.  Our waitress was really nice and would always stop by to have a conversation with our table.  The food was prepared and served rather quickly.  They were great with the smallest details...they kept the wine glasses full and folded our napkins when we left the table to use the restroom.  We were the last party in the restaurant and not once did we feel like we were being rushed out.  Despite the cockroach, ordinary Filet Mignon, and small portions....the service picked up the slack.  Overall, I had a lovely experience with my friends and I will probably return to Chouchou in the future.  I just hope there aren't anymore surprises.  \n\nUnfortunately, I can't give Chouchou 5 stars that Elite Mr. Kazu O. gave, but 3.5 is still a good score.", "author": "Brian S."}

The warm restaurant immediately lulls you into what will be a lovely evening. The servers are all charming, and I didn't speak to a single one that didn't have a French accent. We started off with the escargot. The server waited for me to look at it quizzically - where are the shells? Turns out Chouchou did the heavy work for me and it was all arranged out for me. The cheese souffle was superb (I felt bad for cheating on Jacqueline, I hope she forgives me) and sharing the chocolate walnut tart was the perfect end to a truly wonderful dinner that easily could have been on a quiet corner in Paris. \n\nAnd they have a parking lot... when was the last time you saw that in SF?", "author": "Kelly C."}

It's a charming French bistro that alway seems to be packed with folks who are clearly enjoying themselve in a cozy setting.  The service is friendly, the owners welcoming and overall a good vibe.\n\nThe food, though, is hit or miss.  The french onion soup was my favorite dish with its velvety melted swiss cheese and broth-soaked croutons.  Also quite nice was the foie gras terrine, which was accompanid by a large sweet fig and apricot glaze (a little two sweet).  It would have been nice if the toast was crunchy and warm (to contrast with the cold, smooth terrine).\n\nThe heart of palm salad with beets, endive, goat cheese and orange slices sounded so amazing - and it was good - but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe mains were more disappointing.  The seafood cassoulet (with monkfish, prawns and bacon) is served piping hot with a crust that resembles a dense \"everything\" bagel.  While the look was impressive, the saffron broth itself was quite salty th.  And the tiger prawns?   More like puny shrimp.\n\nDessert options were mainly various kinds of fruit and chocolate tarts.  We ordered a few.  Now, if you like tarts, this might be heaven but to me, they all started to taste too similar and were quite dense.\n\nOverall, not a bad place.  I like the homey, mom & pop feel to it.  But the food isn't something that I'll be remembering any time soon.", "author": "F. P."}

The cheese daily cheese plate.  It was really good but very meager portions.  I always forget that these fancy high prices places usually have small portions.\n\nIt had about 4-5 small slices of cheese, a fig and some fruit stuff, was really good but not enough for $15.\n\nThey really only had 2 vegetarian entrees.  I'm glad that they had at least more than one, but for such a limited amount, usually means there isn't much of a selection for me to come back multiple times.\n\nMy bf got the scallops ($22) which literally had 4-5 scallops on the plate and that was it.  Definitely not enough for an entree.  He said that the plate was a little cold also.\n\nI got the Black Trumpet Souffle ($16) which was pretty good, although a little too hot (temperature) and the green beans were very flavorful.\n\nI ended up sharing some of my souffle with my boyfriend because he was still starving after his small portion of scallops.  \n\nWe finished the dinner with the chocolate tarts.  They have about 5 but they don't have all of them at once.  I wanted the almond or triple chocolate, of course, was the 2 they weren't serving that night.  I said \"Oh guess I'll have the creme brulee\" but nope they were out of that too.\n\nI got the mandarin orange chocolate tart and my boyfriend got the pear.  Not much of a \"mandarin orange\" tart with two small mandarin slices in it.  It was alright.\n\nI understand it was a busy night but the service was sub-par and the food not that great for the price.\n\nI think this is a better establishment for those who do eat meat as well as those who can a good chunk of change for a meal here.  More for special occasions.\n\nFinal verdict: the plating was nice, atmosphere was romantic, but the food left me wanting more and hungry after the meal.\n\nTables are small (mostly for smaller parties 2-4) and not recommended for large parties.", "author": "Kameron K."}

I enjoyed the foie grois, and my lamb, but the suprise that came out with the first course, I couldn't figure out what it was, and I wasn't as into it.  Dessert was standard, brownie and ice cream on top, with nuts sprinkled all over.  \n\nIt was an intimate atmosphere, the service was good, considering how busy of a week it was, prices were not going to break the bank, and the owner/chef came out and greeted and said good bye to EVERY SINGLE person that came in, which I thought was a really nice touch!\n\nI like the location because even though on the busy intersection at where the Forest Hill bus station is, inside, it's dark, intimate, and you can't even tell what is going on outside, as the windows have an orange see through tint and there is no outside noise coming in!  Good job on that!", "author": "Denise B."}

I'm so glad I did though because I had no idea what I was missing out on! I came here with Sally L. because they were doing a promotion with Yelp Eats this past week, but we ended up picking right of the menu instead of the prix fixe. Its just as well that you don't because we split 3 appetizers and an entree, and it came out to about the same price. Being the foodies that we are, we figured it was a better way to try more variety.\n\nFOIE GRAS -\nI loved the paring with the pistachio and quince jelly. The flavors mixed really nicely\n\nESCARGOT  - \nNormally I see escargot in a butter pesto sauce, but I like that this dish had a roasted garlic flavor. The presentation was also different than most in that it came in what we first mistook as a bone marrow dish. Instead of the bone marrow, they had hollowed it out and stuff it w/ the escargot!\n\nSTEAMED MUSSELS - \nI've been eating a lot of shellfish lately, and these mussels were huge! Definitely very fresh, and very tasty!\n\nCHILEAN SEABASS - \nAfter some serious yelp research, we had to give this dish a try. Unfortunately this is the only dish I could have done without. I love seabass and was disappointed that it was a bit on the dry side\n\nCHOCOLATE PEAR TART - \nit was on the house! It definitely was different than most dessert tarts i've tried. The richness reminded me of fudge, but the pear was a nice contrast. They give you a huge piece too, so it's good enough to share with 4 people if you just want a few bits of dessert after your meal.\n\nOverall, I definitely will be coming back! The staff here was so nice, and they were constantly checking back with us to make sure we were enjoying our meal and having a good time.\n\nThanks again for the dessert Chouchou!!", "author": "Kristen C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-15", "description": "This is an excellent place to use that restaurant.com gift certificate that you don't know what to do with. \n\nMy mom got me a whopping $100 restaurant.com gift certificate. Little did I know, it doesn't work like cash, but it only works as discounts off their specific list of participating restaurants, and a lot of those \"discounts\" have so many restrictions on them (i.e. $10 off your bill of $75 or more, not good towards alcohol, not valid on the weekends, etc.). So, I did a lot of research on yelp and restaurant.com for a well-rated restaurant on restaurant.com that also offers a significant discount, and this is one of the best. We opted for the $50 gift certificate. (The catch for Chouchou being that you have to make a minimum purchase of $100 and the 18% is automatically added to the bill -- not bad compared to the many restrictions that some of the other restaurants have). I should also mention that my husband is French and he thought the food was authentic, creative and that it tasted really good.\n\nWell, since we knew we had to spend at least $100 we decided to each get an appetizer and an entree, and not to go with our usual $30 range (or less) bottle of wine. The waiter recommended a $54 bottle of Spanish tempranillo called Pago Florentino Tinto (2007). It was pretty good, although I think I resigned myself more to the idea that I was paying for the idea of drinking a $54 bottle of wine, than paying for the actual taste (of which $30 bottles are just as good, thank you).\n\nAppetizers: We ordered the steak tartare ($10) which was a fun dish because it was prepared table-side, and the excellent foie gras with dates ($15). Portions were good, not teeny-tiny.\n\nEntrees: The lamb ($22) was presented well, tasted great, and was a nice-sized portion. The scallops ($22) were delicious but I felt like it was a kind of small portion, even though I was completely satiated by the end of the meal. We also got a side of the gratin ($4).\n\nDessert: The tartes are the thing and we had a pear tarte that was excellent.  Espresso was brewed correctly.\n\nTotal bill came to $172.64 (including $10.64 of tax and the included 18% tip). So, yeah, I suppose that restriction for using our gift certificate of spending more than $100 wasn't such a restriction after all. With the gift certificate, our bill went down to $122.64, not bad for a fancy night out \"pulling out all the stops\" for our usual (or at least, most of the time) cheap selves.", "author": "Ekin O."}

I even had to remind them several times for bread.  I also asked them to serve up my kids food - if not the french fries and they didn't.  You know I'm paying good money for this and food is good, but not great.  the escargot is not from a shell - hence frozen, but from a can.  The duck was good, but dry.  The lamb was not unique.  the steak was good b/c of the cheese.  the steak with the Burgundy was okay, but dry - I think they reheat it since some of the beef was hot and some was cold.  the fries were over cooked and dry.  The only thing good was the desserts - the banana flambe, chocolate tart, creme brulee, and the fruit tart.  all good, but not unique - desserts you can get anywhere.  their french onion soup is okay - not great.

What does that have to do with ChouChou?  Well, the front door kept blowing open because it was really hard to close (you have to really put some weight into closing it, which most people didn't), and as we were sitting closer to the front of the restaurant, we were constantly annoyed by the gusts of wind as each patron entered and left.  Let's keep a tally; that would be annoyance #1.  Annoyance #2: my boyfriend was parking his car and dropped me off so I could go inside and notify them of our reservation.  I walked in and nobody bothered greeting me, let alone asked me a party of how many, did we have reservations, etc.  The restaurant only had a few patrons inside at the time, so it couldn't have been that they were too busy to greet me, they were just flat out apathetic.  I had to walk up to a waiter after the 2 other people who worked there decided to ignore me (an older gentleman who I'm assuming is the owner or manager, and a woman).\n\nWe sat down, placed our orders, and waited for our food.  They brought out this fresh, warm, yummy bread, which we kept gobbling up because, surprise surprise, our apps were taking forever (side note: The bread is the only reason I added an extra star).  Annoyance #3...I got the French onion soup, and trust me, it was nothing to write home about.  The broth was salty, and instead of the cheese being a nice melted, stringy consistency, it sat in the soup as a large glob.  If you want amazing French onion soup, go to Absinthe.  Much, much better.  \n\nDuring the middle of eating out appetizers, the manager came by to ask if we could move down one table because apparently he forgot that a larger party was coming and had to put our table with another empty one to form a larger table.  Okay, fine, that happens, but still, come on...the busboy and my boyfriend and I had to all move our things.  Ever heard of planning ahead?  Apparently not.  Annoyance #4.\n\nFast forward 15 minutes - no wait, slow mo 15 minutes - since it took forever and a day for us to get our entrees.  By then, we finished our 2nd serving of the house bread, and were working on the third.  Annoyance #5.  Finally our dishes came.  I ordered the shrimp with asparagus and some sort of grits like thing, and my boyfriend had a full order of the mussels.  My food was COLD, whereas his mussels were hot, which meant my food was cooked first, and sat around while his was being prepared.  Ugh.  Annoyance #6.  I sent it back to the waiter and asked him to heat it up in the microwave.  I hate cold food.  I can stand in front of the fridge and eat cold leftovers at my own house for free, why would I want to do that at a restaurant?  My boyfriend's mussels weren't much better either.   The broth was good (can't go wrong with a cream and white wine sauce) but the mussels were gross.  Not only were they rubbery (overcooked), they also tasted like burnt rubber.  There was something very off-putting about their flavor, the mussels were obviously frozen and reheated as opposed to fresh.  Annoyance #7.  Geez, they just keep adding up, don't they?\n\nSo now we finished our meal and sat around and waited forever for our check.  Our waiter disappeared, and we couldn't get the other people's attentions, so we finally flagged down a busboy, who had to get our waiter.  Said waiter came to our table, we asked for the check, and then we finally got the bill.  Annoyance #8.  \n\nWe left full but definitely not satisfied.  Our experience coupled with the totally disappointing food left us with a bitter taste in our mouth.  I don't understand the high average rating this establishment has on Yelp, so maybe we were there on a really terrible day...?", "author": "Laura S."}

Already I was liking the location; although Dewey Blvd has many cars that drive through, it was a nice walk through a mostly neighborhood area until we reached Chouchou. There were only 2 other restaurants close to this one, and they were right next to each other. Other than that, pretty much just homes and some trees.\n\nThe staff were nice. As many have already stated, the owner/chef is a gentleman. Me and my friend arrived about 45 minutes earlier than we expected and the place was full. So we decided to walk back to the car to hang out until our reservation time. Shortly after we had gone outside, the chef ran out to us make sure everything was ok. How's that for ya?\n\nNow for the food: I have never eaten at a French restaurant before, surprisingly. Although it's style has American influence, I must say the food was very good. I enjoyed the Salmon; however after seeing the bowl of muscles, I think I that's what I'll be ordering the next time ;P\n\nI've seen reviews about this place being a bit dirty in the kitchen and what not, but IMO, as long as the food is good [and it won't make me sick], the atmosphere is enjoyable, and the service is as delightful as it was, I have no complaints.

For appetizers, we had the mussels, pomme frites, and goat cheese tart.  The goat cheese was slightly disappointing, as I love goat cheese and was hoping for a whole lot more of the goat cheese.  It wasn't bad though, still tasty, but I would have liked a more accentuated goat cheese presence.  I really liked the mussels, but everyone pointed out it was too salty, and I ended up agreeing after having a few more.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the lamb cassolette, truffle duck, crab salad, and pork loin.  The cassolette was definitely unique to Chouchou.   Inside was just a lamb stew, but I recommend getting the cassolette just because it's different.  The crab salad was too fishy, but the duck and pork loin were better.   \n\nI'm not a dessert person, but the dessert is a must have here:  their tarts are their specialty!  We had the pear tart, the mandarin orange chocolate tart, and the chocolate nut tart.  My favorite was the pear, but everyone at the table liked a different one!\n\nOverall, the food is decent, but it's actually the ambiance, not the food, that makes the place!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-02-01", "description": "I embarked on a yelp hiatus in an attempt to be more productive in other areas of my life, but my experience at Chouchou was more than enough to precipitate a return. \n\nChouchou is randomly located in West Portal's residential area. Despite having a private lot, no spots were available when we drove in, resulting in a search for street parking anyways. We were seated promptly after arriving, menus handed to us, and though it took awhile to order, we empathized with the waiters that it was Dine About Town week and kept ourselves entertained. My four friends decided on the DAT menu while I stuck with their salmon and purple potato entr\u00e9e. \n\nDAT Menu (simplified):\nFrench onion soup or crab salad (french onion soup too salty. crab salad was a bit runny but tasty)\nSalmon or Chicken (salmon was buttery, moist, and overall very good. I did not try chicken)\nCreme Brule or Fruit Tart (creme brule was delicious, I wasn't impressed with the fruit tarts). \n\nStrike One:\nBefore anyone could select the dessert they wanted our waiter told us,  \"Dessert will be different tonight, but it will be taken care of\". He didn't elaborate. We were confused, but speculated we might be given alternatives to choose from later. Service throughout our meal was spotty. There was a lot of waiting in between appetizer and entr\u00e9e, but our glasses and bread basket were never empty for too long I suppose. My entr\u00e9e was so-so. I liked how light the dish was , but it didn't offer any exciting flavors. If anything, I started to eye my neighbor's salmon from the DAT menu. Their homemade bread is AMAZING, I will give them that. They would have been a three stars in my book at this point, but any approval quickly dissipated.\n \nStrike two:\nAfter the last of our entr\u00e9es were taken away we had been dining for about 1.5hours. I asked two waiters on separate occasions if they had a dessert menu for us to look at. The first waiter said, \"Yes\" and then left and never came back. The second, also our server, said \"Dessert will be a surprise and it is on the house\". I responded with a quizzical look on my face and said,  \"How is it on the house if all of my friends ordered the DAT menu (with the exception of me)?\". He didn't respond. Again, he wasn't giving us a straight answer. I looked at my friends for a moment and when I turned back he was gone. \n\nStrike Three:\nA total of  thirty minutes passed before we received any semblance of a dessert. By this point, we were pretty upset. We just wanted to leave an go home already. When it finally arrived, one creme brule and a plate with six slivers of fruit tart, though all different, were set down in front of us. Two pieces of tart was about the size of one serving so everything essentially amounted to about four desserts including the creme brule. The fruit tarts were smushed and smeared all over the plate. The whipped cream was losing air and melting. I thought he said the desserts would be different from the DAT menu, but these WERE the two items on the dessert menu. What was the surprise? Did they run out of creme brule and decide to compensate for it by giving us different fruit tarts? Turns out, this was the case and we only found out because my friend went to the manager to complain afterwards. Why couldn't they just tell us to begin with and let us decide if we still wanted to do DAT? And what was \"on the house\"? Naively, we thought that they might have compensated us on our bill, but when we received it: zero compensation. \n\nI'm not upset with how dessert panned out, but the lack of communication and the prevarication that took place. I hate to use a politically associated term, but that was what it was. I'm giving them two stars as slack because this might be their first year participating in DAT. S'il vous plait, communicate with your customers and don't take them as idiots. We came in at 7:30 and did not leave until 10!

She's even been known to join us on multiple occasions, unable to resist her siren call.  Whether it's a Sunday morning rendezvous, or an evening romp, our voracious appetite is always quelled. She has never disappointed us. We leave there with a smile on our face and an even greater desire for more. Undoubtedly, a nap will always follow.\n\nOn a more serious note... it had been a while since we had been there for dinner, and were happy to be heading back for a family dinner with some old family friends visiting from Hong Kong. This gave us the opportunity to sample many of the delight found on the menu.\n\nWhen they brought out the menu, I was in shock. Yes, they kept some of the classics, such as the Cassolettes and Mussels, but it looks like Nick has really been trying to kick the menu up a notch.  Gone were the Lamb, Chicken & Seafood cassolettes, replaced with Beef Cheeks or Oven roasted rabbit. New additions also included a Duo of Kobe beef and a Gruyere Souffle. \n\nThe appetizers also had a bit of a make over too. The escargots were no longer served in the traditional escargot plates, but now stuffed  inside  a beef marrow bone (correct me if I'm wrong).  The roasted garlic and , shallot and butter sauce were also fantastic spread on the crusty french bread they give you. Also Kobe beef had made its way over as an appetizer, served  as  steak tartare, with shallots parsley, cornichons, quail egg and a potato gaufrette.\n\nSo, with all these new options, it took forever to decide what to eat. I kept going back and forth between the 2 cassolettes, the kobe beef, the Maple Duck Breast and the Gruyere souffle.

Our 3' chocolate Santa, a surprise for the guest of honor, was presented with all the glory and revelry a knee-high pagan Odin analogue.  I can't say enough about the food, from the bacon-wrapped duck (on pear/turnip with a Calvados sauce) to the overly generous portions of mussels and wine and the bread to sop it all up with.  Owing to the character of the location, near sleepy Forest Hills and Midtown Terrace, the crowd was similarly friendly and welcoming.. as we met half of them while offering De Goedheiligman around.\n\nIf you don't like engaging service and being anywhere near the other folks in the dining room, Chouchou might not be for you.  For a fun night where you just might meet some new food-loving friends, be they fellow diners or the house staff, this is a hands-down must-try.\n\nThe complementary Kir was a spectacular touch to a perfect night.", "author": "K M."}

After all, I had such a great experience choosing French for my birthday in January dining at Bistro LeZinc.\n\nAmbiance. The yellow and red walls created a festive ambiance. The best view is window side for a sight of the neighborhood. Greeted by a waitress from France, the service was attentive.\n\nFood. Served with pastry puffs and a light sauce, the escargot had great presentation but did not make up for the over use of lemon in the sauce. Stealing the show, the French onion soup was great. A full bodied broth married well with the nutty taste from the burnt cheese crust. Sweet onions rounded out the dish.\n\nFor entrees, the pork tenderloin was tender accompanied by a sauce that needed a dash of kosher salt. Greeted with a big bowl of mussels, my appetite increased immediately. The sea sweet mussels bathed in a sultry wine sauce. \n\nCrusty bread dipped in the sauce made a good side dish itself. Acting as the comfort food agent, the fries could have been a perfect side dish if it had a crispy texture. The duck confit (shredded duck with a layer of mash potatoes) was a disappointment. With a crispy crust, the potatoes lacked any flavor and the shredded duck had no character and flavor.\n\nKnown for their pastry skills, the tart lived up to its reputation. Light fluffy crust joins fresh fruit to make up the fruit tart. Lacking a caramelized crust, the cr\u00e8me brulee was nothing spectacular.\n\nConclusion.

It was towards the end of \"Dine About Town\" - - and she had a long list of places she had wanted to try out.  Of those, we chose ChouChou as our gathering spot for that evening.\n \nFirst - - interesting name.  French Restaurant.  Sounds Chinese.  Educate me.\n\nSecond - - WHAT ON EARTH?  Just how far is this restaurant?  Am I really even in SF anymore?  \"Sunset\"?  Where's THAT?  OMG, where am I?  (I was awfully late by the time I got there - - apologies again, Cynthia!)  I had just moved into SF and had given myself a modest 15 minutes to get there from Nob Hill.  NOT!!!!  More like 35 minutes!?!?!\n\nThird -  having its own parking lot - - - PRAISE GOD.  Given how late I was - - this lot saved me a lot of stress!\n\nFourth - - French waiters.  Enough said.\n \nI got there and Cynthia was already working up the wine.  Atta girl....  I think I've finally met a girl who can drink me toe to toe.  Actually - - I think she might outdrink me, but that remains to be seen....\n \nNow, the food!\nWe both opted for the DAT menu.  From a choice of three items for each of the three courses, we agreed on which two we'd like to try and split everything.  \n \nFor our appetizers, we had escargot and I think a beet salad?  Escargot was quite tasty - - but the other slips my memory.  Couldn't have been amazing if it slips my memory, right?  Either that or I am just losing my memory...  Oh, the beet and arugula salad.  Of course.  It was good, actually - - but not quite great.\n \nFor our entrees - - they were not offering their usual duck entree that evening and informed us that instead, they would be offering the pork tenderloin - so we accepted that, and ordered the salmon dish.  The pork tenderloin was really disappointing - - no flavor, tough, and dry.  The salmon was quite good, if my memory serves me right.  I remember not liking the tenderloin and liking the other dish - - and Cynthia swears it was salmon.  Perhaps my memory is fading indeed, haha....\n \nDesserts were great, though!  The choice from the DAT menu was either one of their fruit tarts, or creme brulee.  While we did want the latter, neither of us were in the mood for a fruit tart - - so off the regular menu, we asked if we could order the chocolate-something w/ ice cream instead, though I knew replacements were not accepted on DAT menus usually.  Our friendly waiter happily obliged us, though - - and it was well worth it, as both desserts were divine!  Their coffee was also very good.\n \nI found the food at Chou Chou to be decent to good - - none were horrible, though the pork tenderloin really did need some help.  Dessert was excellent, though!\n\nService was nothing short of excellent, w/ both waiters as attentive and doting as can be.  \n\nWine list was good - - but not being familiar w/ French wine, I just went w/ whatever the waiter suggested - and it was indeed tasty wine.\nAtmosphere was pleasant - - cozy, but not suffocating -  but it was a bit \"neither this nor that\" altogether.  Totally a great date place, but then again it did not feel uncomfortable w/ two girls, either.\n \nAll in all, it was a fun night filled w/ lots of food and chatter - - good times!  \nOverlooking Chou Chou's website, I'm finding their brunch menu to be enticing, and would be interested in trying that out at some point. \n\nFor dinner, though - - given the location and more importantly, the quality of food - - I think I'd opt for other French restaurants in the city before going to Chou Chou for dinner.   After dinner, while we were the last to leave the restaurant, we found ourselves wanting to go elsewhere for one more drink or something - - except we were in the middle of freakin' NOWHERE w/ no choice but to head home.\n \nNext time, we do this ALL NIGHT, girlie!  Good times!!", "author": "Grace K."}

I was impressed by the reviews and thought it was a great excuse to check out some new areas of The City. \n\nIt was pouring outside, and we were lucky to score a spot in the tiny parking lot.  Although we had a reservation for our party of 8, the table wasn't quite ready yet, so we stood huddled awkwardly in the entrance close to the tables. After securing a table close to the bar (and I mean VERY close to the bar-it's tight in there!) we asked the server for recommendations on a bottle of wine. We were thrilled with the recommendation! We sat for a while waiting for the rest of our party, but this didn't seem to be a problem. They were very gracious about letting us hang out with our wine, water and bread.\n\nFor my second course I had the lamb, which was a little tough, and something like a strawberry bruschetta for dessert, but the best part was the frisee salad. I probably could have eaten 5 of those salads, plus a few more glasses of that wine and left a very happy camper.\nOverally, I liked the atmosphere. Such a quaint place filled with so much happiness!

Much to my boyfriend's dismay, I was greeted two big kisses on the cheek from the host and the rest of the restaurant and decor was just as charming.  However, I didn't really care for the restaurant's close and cozy quarters - the table surface was relatively small and the tables were situated  so close to other patrons that I could have literally reached over and tasted something on another couple's plate. But hey this is San Francisco I guess...\n\nThe food was pretty darn good.  The appetizer salad with crab was good and beautifully presented, but the stand out dish was the french onion soup.  It was probably one of the best I've ever had.  The duck entree was  flavorful, with a wonderful sauce, without being too fatty or gamey.  The pork tenderloin dish with mashed potatoes was my favorite and I'm still not sure how they managed to infuse so much flavor into the meat.  My boyfriend's only complaint was that the sauce accompanying the duck and pork were pretty much the same.  I'm not a huge fan of chocolate, but the chocolate mandarin orange tart was pretty yummy.\n\nThis was definitely a wonderful pick for date night.  Just try to secure one of the tables by the windows if you can, as they seem to have more space.

The foie gras was fantastic and among some of the best I've ever had. The chef mixed some peas and other small veggies in with the foie gras that nicely complemented the flavor. My one critique was that they could have included a few more small pieces of bread with the appetizer (they only included one square-shaped piece), but we had plenty of bread at our table so used that to get all of the foie gras-y goodness.\n\nThe peach-heirloom tomato salad was a bit of a letdown for both of us. For starters, the presentation made the dish appear daunting - the various components of the dish were piled on top of each other, kind of like a bird's nest. Also, neither the heirloom tomatoes nor the cheese in the salad were very flavorful at all.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the sea bass with a bacon-based sauce, and it was out of this world! The fish was cooked to perfection and the sauce was absolutely delicious. It was accompanied by some sundried tomatoes and potatoes, which were also quite good.\n\nWe then split a dessert, the chocolate pear tart. It was terrific! The chocolate was so rich and dee-lish.\n\nI'm keeping this restaurant on my radar as the hidden gem to share with locals and out-of-town guests alike.", "author": "Rachel G."}

Both our entrees were prepared perfectly, had great flavor, and was hearty in the portion. We both agreed the escargot dish was the highlight of the meal.

Reserved a table for two and when arrived, they had an empty table for two but said we had to wait because they weren't ready.  The owner was the one who greeted us and we were thinking \"why are they making us wait when there's an empty table?\" Well, we waited for 20 minutes past our reservation time and finally got a table after a couple left. The good thing about this though was the owner apologized a couple of times about the wait and gave each of us a tasty glass of sweet wine while we were waiting (looked like a rose). \n\nAfter that, we ordered some food and we were happy because the food was great! Size is just right; not too big and not too small (with the exception of the Ocean Trilogy..thought it wasn't enough). The Bacon Wrapped Duck was very tasty, moist, and tender.  Sea and Ocean Trilogy was interesting since they made three different flavors for each fish. Mussels were only OK to me and the zucchini with crab was awesome. We had the chocolate with pear tart and that was VERY chocolatey! Didn't taste any pear flavors to it besides the slices of pear on top but otherwise yummy tart!\n\nAll in all, I liked this place. Didn't like having to wait cramped up in a small area where it feels like you're in everyone's way but food was good enough that it's not that big of a deal. And FYI, they didn't seat us in the beginning because those were saved for a bigger party.", "author": "sidney c."}

But my navigation did take my lost but i eventually found my way. When i came it was around 8:30 or 9 or so, and they said the kitchen had closed but then i guess another group came in so they just sat us down. The ambiance is so beyond amazing, its like France or Italy. The service here is so great and professional! Something i'm not used to, He didn't even let me touch the plate! Which mean't that he wanted to set it for me. It was a great place and I highly recommend it for the date. You get  free bread with butter. I ordered the pasta dish? I forgot what it was called but i know there was only 1 pasta dish and it was mushrooms, which i hate! But it was actually delicious.

Came here for Dine About Town and I got the endive salad, rib eye, and some chocolate dessert thing. Don't really remember what it was called. The food was nothing more than what I could make at home.....but I could make it better. The salad was pretty darn bland and boring.\n\nThe rib eye though, was cooked very well, but the sauce was a little overbearing. My girlfriend got the same thing, and it would have been appreciated if we had a little consistency with the sauce. She didn't  have enough and I had too much. How is that possible? The sauce didn't taste like much either so it didn't really make a difference, but just some consistency would have been nice. The scalloped potato was....bleh also. Nothing special. It was also on the colder side of warm also. \n\nFor dessert as I was asking about it, our waiter told us about the chocolate dessert and the guy next to us said we had to get it because it was outstanding. Umm....no. It was dry and plain and made me really regret not getting coffee with my dessert. What was special about it? Absolutely nothing. \n\nThe wait staff is friendly, but the place looks like it belongs in LA (and not the good parts of LA). I don't really appreciate warm tap water either. Dump a couple of cubes of ice in it, geeez. The wait staff was incredibly clumsy too. Nothing happened around my table, but I was there for not even an hour and heard them drop dishes and food about 4 times! \n\nOverall everything was average. Nothing I couldn't make at home and nothing I would want to pay more than $20 for. What's the fuss guys? I don't get it.\n\nedit:\nHad to edit because after reading some reviews someone reminded me of something. What's with the music? It's incredibly loud and also inconsistent.

There's maybe 15 tables in this little restaurant and every table was full when we arrived on a Sunday evening. Their wait staff is super friendly, but a little one the slow side with only two waiters and a bus boy. The feng shui of the place is probably no bueno considering its right at the top of an intersection...meaning when the cars are stopped at the stoplight outside of this place, their headlights are shining right into the restaurant windows. Kinda weird. Despite that, the restaurant is cozy. \n\nWe enjoyed mussels, pomme frites, goat cheese tart, lamb cassolette, duck confit, crab salad, and pork loin...all of which wasn't too bad. The mussels were fresh but the sauce was quite salty, the pomme frites were a little on the soggy side, the goat cheese tart was ok, the lamb cassolette was probably the best dish but tasted like a pretty standard stew, the duck was a little well done, the crab salad was a little fishy tasting, the pork loin was pretty standard. Overall the meal was no better than average.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered half a piece of chocolate nut tart and half a piece of pear tart. Being my mom's bday, they brought out a full piece of each of those tarts and a small piece of every other tart they had! Mmm tasty. I personally liked the chocolate mandarin orange, my mom liked the chocolate nut, my sister liked the pear tart, my dad liked them all. \n\nOverall, I was a bit underwhelmed by the food but it is a cute, friendly place.

The waitress was nice enough to allow me to try a couple of the wines. \"Merci!\" A waiter gave me the histoire de cassoulet. They convinced me to try the Rhubarb Tart. \"Bit ef course!\" I'm a sucker for good Tart Tatin, but the Rhubarb Tart fixed me up just right. We said our \"Aurevoirs,\" and I headed home to watch \"Shoot the Piano Player,\" \"Betty Blue,\" and \"La Femme Nikita.\"  An odd pairing....but when you get the French Blues, there's no real cure other than to ride the wave (Nouvelle Vague anyone?).\n\nChouChou is a great little neighborhood place, tucked between where 7th Ave, Dewey Blvd (Twin Peaks/W.

The Russian waiter was so obviously hamming up a French accent that the entire table tittered.  Fake!\n3. The wine list was reprehensible! We ordered a supposedly St. Emillion '03 Bordeaux at $55 only to get a bottle of cheap plonk masquerading as a Grand Cru. Absolutely unacceptable. Adding insult to injury, we were charged a staggering $18 corkage fee for the much more drinkable California cab we brought with us.\n\nThe food was mediocre... completely serviceable escargot were followed by a lackluster steak and frittes.

Really good with complimenting textures and a balance of flavors. We ordered a bottle of 2003 Chateauneuf de Pape which was heavily tannic and started to open about the time we finished the bottle.\n\nFor the entree I went with the Rabbit Cassolette. Awesome.

Ate dinner with the wife and kid (2 yr old) and in-laws.  The service was amazing, from the waiter who was very courteous and had a cool accent, to the food server who brought out our food and constantly filled our bread basked, and finally to the head chef (Michaels) who filled our water glasses multiple times, took our dessert order, and personally cleaned off our table before dessert which was a mess from our kid.  All the tables were full and it was a busy night, but the service was impeccable.  Never had such great service in a restaurant before where everyone was awesome. Other reviews comment on the average service, perhaps because it was during a very busy night, but we had top notch service from everyone, and it was busy.  The chef even went up to his office and gave our kid a toy and shared his ideas about the wine list and menu!!!\n\nAnd the food was delicious.  Had the mussels, amazing, finished off the broth by lapping it up with the bread.  They were so good, our 2 year old wanted more.  The crab/avocado feuillete and escargot were also tasty.  Had the salmon and mushroom souffle for our main dishes and both were cooked perfectly and delicious.  Finished off with the creme brulee and chocolate mousse.  Both were top notch, but the creme brulee was the bomb.  Portions were good (not too small or big) and we were all more than satisfied at the end.\n\nI can't compare the new/current owners and chef to the previous ones, but my experience has been nothing but exceptional and excellent cuisine.

I had to jerk out of the way or get an elbow right in my forehead.  My friend saw this and the host must have seen the expression on her face because he finally turned toward my direction and refilled my glass without apologizing and still chatting her up.\n\nSo. . . 2 stars because the food was awesome and for the service I had before that night.

So we decided to make it a tradition and go again. This time I was very disappointed, not only with the service (WE WERE THERE OVER 2 1/2 hours!!!!) but the food as well!. :(\n\nMind you, this place is supposed to be fine dining (and the prices show it). Now, I don't mind paying a good amount for good food and good service, but this place had neither.\n\nThe owner was so busy socializing with all his friends who came to visit him at work, that he was neglecting others like us. We walked in and no one greeted us, and when the owner finally came more than 5 minutes later, he said \"someone will be right with you\" and he decided to sit down at one of his friends' tables. We had a reservation, and never even got a reserved table. Throughout our meal, I kept noticing that he was very hospitable and greeted others who walked in that he was familiar with. He would hook them up w/free stuff, which is fine, it's his restaurant. But if he wants others that aren't regulars or friends to come back, he needs to give us some courtesy.\n\nNext, our server was just in her own world of daisies and sunshine. She was sweet, but very slow and kinda just seemed like she was frolicking around (I'm exhaggerating, but you get the vibe). She brought us someone else's credit card when we hadn't even received our dessert or check.\n\nThe food wasn't as good as last year. I remembered it tasting delicate and being of good quality, but this year everything was smothered in butter.\n\nThe ONLY guy who really helped us out was this guy whom I originally thought was the host, but I think he may have been the server assistant or another server or just doing everything. He was running around all over the restaurant picking up the slack after the airheady server and the social butterfly of an owner. Since our dessert took over 30 min to get to us, he came to us and said, \"I put in an extra order of creme brulee on the house,\" but then when the bus boy came out with it, he only gave us one.

There is no reason to waste your time going to Chouchou.  \n\nWe waited to sit even though we had reservations, waited for water, waited for bread, waited to have our order taken, waited between courses, waited for the bill.  Overall the service was completely lacking.  There were two servers for the entire first floor, which was packed.  We had to remind the waiters three times that we had ordered dessert before it arrived.  It was almost comical by the end.\n\nDespite the poor service, I was hoping for some yummy french food.  The sauce on the mussels was weird.  It was a flavorless soupy cream.  The shrimp and asparagus was ok, but I have had much better food for much less money.

From what I remember, we enjoyed the evening but I had not returned since. \n\nSo last night, my brother and I met with a few individuals from Edward Jones to talk about investments. Interestingly enough the owner and chef Nick was very accommodating to our group and had us eat in their secluded loft above the main part of the restaurant. The one hosting the dinner had arranged for us to have a quiet table to talk about different options. \n\nOverall, we had a great dinner. They served us all an \"Amuse Bouse\", which I have seen mentioned on Top Chef a few times so that was cool. They even gave us an on the house desert tray - which was nice. On Thursdays, they have live musicians playing in the background. Overall we had a great experience. \n\nMy brother had the filet mignon and the steak tartare which they made in front of us while I had the beef cheeks. \n\nOne could tell that the dishes were good, we all finished our plates.", "author": "Max D."}

Which is very French... the tables are always close together so it should be \"authentic,\" but  I like my space!\n\nBut everything else is quite fantastic.  We were greeted warmly by the chef-owner, whose reply to all inquiries is, \"No problem!\" Our party of 6 arrived about 20 minutes before our reservation time, and because of the rain the only real place to stand was in the center pathway for the restaurant... but the staff was understanding and we were never given the stink eye.  The ambiance was interesting to say the least... visually, it could be considered a romantic but casual type place, with dim lights but accented with bright colors.  But then you bring on the eclectic mix of music, and it's almost a chic type place.  Whatever it was, it was NOT snobby and pretentious.\n\nOnce seated (10 minutes later, woo!), we were given some overtoasted  (but in a good, tasty way) baguettes and our orders were promptly taken. Then a nice touch... the chef-owner came out again, shook each of our hands, and thanked us for visiting him that night!  All throughout the night, our server checked on us to make sure we were ok... even on a busy night, we were never neglected.\n\nAnyway, onto the food.  I admittedly went overboard on the food ordering, but I wanted to try it all.\n\nTo start, I had both the Frisee aux Lardons and the Foie Gras Torchon.  The frisee was served with a poached egg and a vinigarette.  I'm not a fan of vinigarette and thought it was too tangy... definitely would have prefered a creamy dressing.  But the salad was delicious otherwise.  The foie gras was complemented well with flamb\u00e9d figs... rich and delicious.  (Others had the butter lettuce salad, warm goat cheese tart, and onion soup gratin\u00e9e, and all were happy).\n\nFor my entree I had a Duck Leg Confit served with sliced potatoes and frisee drizzled with white truffle oil.  The duck meat was falling off the bone, moist, and succulent, with the flavor penetrating deep into the meat.  Definitely one of the best confit I've ever had (top 3 easily). And you can't be afraid of the skin, because that was the best part.  I especially liked the fact that only the frisee had the truffle oil, as the flavor of truffle can be overwhelming.  When I wanted truffle essence, I cold have a sprig of frisee... if not, then I can enjoy the flavor of the confit by itself.  (Others had lamb cassoulette, seared salmon cooked to order, morel souffle, and hangar steak frites... all were raving).\n\nFinally to finish, we had an apple tart, an apricot tart, and a floating island.  Others liked the apricot tart more than the apple because it was more moist.  I personally enjoyed the apple tart precisely because the dryness (and it wasn't dry by any means, just drier than the apricot) concentrated the carmelized sugar in the crust.\n\nThe floating island was simply amazing.  It was a dollup of stiffed egg white/meringue (but not baked, just frozen) floating in a sea of cr\u00e8me anglaise, garnished with shaved candied almonds. Also, we got a sampling of chocolate tarts, courtesy of the chef.\n\nAwesome place to eat... everything you could ask for.", "author": "Johnny N."}

A place needs to have something special to warrant a return or recommendation from me.\n\nWe ordered 4 Hog Island oysters that were delicious by themselves.  We shared the fois gras appetizer.  The best part was the reduced balsamic vinegar.  The pan-roasted trout was beautifully presented, but there was hardly any flavor to either the delicate fish or burned butter sauce.  My seafood cassoulette was good, well cooked for seafood, but the taste was not spectacular.  We decided to skip dessert and went someplace else to finish the evening.  \n\nI observed many of the nearby tables for their food choices and served dishes.  Everything looked fine, but perhaps the kitchen had an off night?  I wish I would have tried the Brie appetizer - it looked good.  Hanger steak also looked decent.  Tarts were rather flat looking, but I'm sure tasted at least good since most reviews have been positive.\n\nI would not return or recommend to anyone.  There are too many other French places that serve food for the same price and have better (in my humble opinion) food.  For French, I recommend Chapeau (15th and Clement), Clemintine (4th and Clement), or Jeanty At Jack's (Sacramento & Montgomery).

First, the parking lot is a mess, grotty potholes full of rank water and debris all around.  Then, the first thing you notice when you walk in is an overwhelming smell of fish, their ventilation system is obviously not working.  And then going upstairs is treacherous, it's dark and walking through that second kitchen area to get to your table is sticky.  Also a little smelly.  \n\nThe food is ok I guess, my friend loved his (fois gras and lamb cassoulette) but I was not nearly as pleased.  Goat cheese tarte was oily and soggy, fish was so overcooked and so tough I  had to cut it with a steak knife, it reminded me of that turkey in Christmas Vacation!  Had high hopes for dessert but it was obviously refrigerated and then microwaved so that the ramekin was effing scorching hot and the middle/bottom of the dessert was still cold.

It's been hard to break that to my Filipino parents, but that's the story of my life: dreaming of Paris, watching French movies, having two French pen pals in high school, French fries, you name it. \n\nSo when someone says, let's go to Chouchou, I am not going to say, well...Olive Garden is a much better option. Hell to the no, Bobby, let's go to Chouchou. I get there earlier than my friends, which is odd because I am always the last one to arrive. It has nothing to do with me wanting to make an entrance, I think that's the Filipino part of me.  That's how I roll.\n\nThe staff is kindly allowing me to sit at a table awaiting two other members of the party, and they don't sweat me. I was waiting for someone to get snippy with me and tell me to summon my friends immediatement! But there was no such worry. Thank goodness.\n\nAnd so the other homies roll in, and the food is getting ordered. French onion soup? Good. A little on the sweet side, but tasty nonetheless. Fresh HOT bread on the table, so good. Lamb cassoulet was enjoyed by my friend, and myself and friend #2 had the salmon. When we ordered it, the waitstaff asked us: \"How do you want it prepared?\"\n\nMe: \"Cooked?\"\n\nSo we learn there are different ways to cook salmon that day, kids, and who the hell knew that you could have it so many different ways. Rare, medium rare, medium well, well. Steak-like. I opted for medium rare, which was good, but had a little sushi thing going on in the middle for a bit, so I'll get it a little more cooked next time. \n\nI opted for the Tarte Tatin (my favorite sweet when dining a la francais), friend #1 ordered creme brulee, and friend #2 ordered the Floating Island. Creme brulee and tarte tatin didn't disappoint, but the fabulous floating island was pretty GOOD. FYI, it's a dollop of meringue surrounded by creme anglaise and sprinkled with honey and almonds. If you have the whole lactose intolerance thing happening, you may want to steer clear, but it's fabulous.\n\nI nicked it a star because the noise is beyond reasonable, and largely I think it's a bit on the over crowded side. I drive by this place all the time, and always thought it would be a quiet, but it's SO not. You been to Paris? You know that rubbin' elbows stuff with the next table? Well they imported that too.\n\nExtra points for the neato real French people who work here. :-) I'm easy like that.", "author": "Charlene L."}

Its not too fancy either!\n\nWe wanted to start off with some cocktails, but our waiter came to us saying they didn't have enough of something to make the drinks so they came with two sparkling glasses of Kir Royal. I didn't mind it since I was curious to try it out anyway.\n\nOn to the appetizers which were:\n- Escargo: Came with 8 of them, each dipped in their juices and with an awesome garlic herb flavor to it. This was phenomenal. Best escargo I've had in my life (actually this was my first time to try it).\n- French onion soup: This was also very good.\n\nMain dish was the mussels, which was what I actually came here for. The mussels came in a big bowl (entree size -- there is also a smaller size available), also cooked in their broth and a very creamy garlic-flavored stew. I was expecting something more simple, just plain steamed mussels maybe slightly flavored, but it turned out to be a fully flavored dish, which turned out to be very tasty. Don't forget to dip the bread in the leftover soup!\n\nIn the end, I was stuffed like hell, but the waiter treated us to a free tart and a dessert wine. This was very surprising and thought it was very nice of them to do that. I believe he did this because we said we wanted the right portion of food so we can save some space for dessert but he suggested that I get the bigger sized mussels plate, which left me stuffed. Maybe he felt bad, but either way, great service.\n\nAlso, not to mention the attentive guy who takes away the dishes and keeps the bread basket filled with freshly baked baguette.

And the cream sauce that it is simmered in was one of the best I've eaten. I sopped up the leftover sauce with the french bread and scraped the bottom of the bowl for ones that jumped ship until they finally took it away.\n\nI ordered the duck leg confit and the boyfriend ordered the halibut. His dish was quite tasty and probably better than mine (despite the menu saying it had a celery puree--I'm not a fan of celery in any form). However, my duck leg was yummy as well with its bacony sauce and accompaniments.\n\nI sipped a glass of the pinot noir with my meal and BF had a beer that started with a K.

So after reading the great reviews of Chouchou on Yelp and Check Please!, I decided to check it out. \n\nI made reservations earlier in the week because I thought it would be necessary.  Turned out I was right.  It was jam packed and loud. The place is small so it doesn't take a whole lot to fill it up.  \n\nAnyway, when my wife and I walk in we were immediately greeted by the infamous greeter/server/hugs and kisses dude.  I thought it was a warm gesture, but a little over the top.  Wife didn't mind it though.  Inside the place is nicely decorated.  The colors of the walls are a vibrant orange and the black & white photos of European scenery add a nice warm touch.  We were asked if we had reservations and we quickly responded \"Yes!\"\n\nWe were escorted away from the lively atmosphere and to the back, up a very steep staircase which led to the kitchen (?!).   It reminded me of that scene in Goodfellas when Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco cut through the back of the Copacabana.  We continued following the maitre'd through the kitchen then to our table.  \n\nUpstairs is quite a contrast from the rest of the restaurant.  It's really a balcony.  The walls are painted a dull, cornflower blue and it's very dark.  The aisles are very narrow and the tables are only enough for two.  And I can see they try to make it more intimate, but really, it doesn't work.  The conversations and noise from below echo through loudly so it's hard to hear your partner.  It's almost like your looking down at a great party and you're stuck upstairs looking through a glass ceiling.     \n\nAs for the food, I was amazed by the warm goat cheese tart.  It was fantastic.  Great wine selection as well.  I was really looking forward to my entree, the lamb cassolette.  My wife ordered the beef cassolette so we could compare which was better.  However, an hour after ordering our entrees, our waitress comes back to inform us that they just ran out of the lamb.  Devastated by the news, I regretfully ordered the duck leg confit.  Damn that was a salty duck.  Didn't really enjoy it.  I should have ordered the Niman Ranch steak.  My wife's beef cassolette however, was incredible, which made me hate my dish even more.  To finish off our meal we both ordered the creme brulee, which was truly fantastic.  \n\nBottom line:  to really enjoy this restaurant, dine downstairs with a party of four or more and come early to insure your lamb cassolette.", "author": "Larry A."}

I had a 5:30 reservation and when I arrived there were probably 6 other people in the restaurant. I like to eat my dinner over a 2 1/2 to 3 hour period, so I tend to make early reservations----plus I like those 1,000 points from Open Table.\n\nAnyway, the service was excellent from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. \n\nFIRST Course:\n\nFrench Onion Soup -- Extremely flavorful, with just the right amount of onions and cheese.\n\nBeet Salad -- This was great! I love beets and they were a perfect match with the mandarin oranges and the very fresh greens. The dressing was well balanced too.\n\nSECOND Course:\n\nEscargot -- this was wonderfully flavorful, what with the butter, parsley, garlic and anchovie. . .soo good that we sopped up all the remaining sauce with our bread.\n\nENTREES:\n\nChicken with baked potato and spinach -- the chicken was juicy, but both it and the spinach were a bit over-salted. So much so, that we couldn't finish the spinach. The baked potato with cheese was great!\n\nPork tenderloin with mashed potatoes and asparagus -- the pork was phenomenal. It was perfectly cooked (with a nice crust on the outside) and the morel sauce was amazing. The mashed potatoes were tastey and the asparagus was cooked perfectly. I loved this dish.\n\nDESSERT:\n\nTriple chocolate tart -- extremely decadent and we finished it all. \n\nI brought a 2002 Mondavi PNX Pinot which went quite well with the food and had a glass of port with dessert.\n\nSo we stayed for about 3 hours and we were never rushed. The waiter was awesome and so were the busboys.\n\nWhen we got up to leave, the maitre d' came over to both of us, shook our hands and thanked us for coming.\n\nI'll definitely be going back again.

But seriously, the two late people were REALLY late so I couldn't blame them.  But either way, they could've been rude to us, but they weren't so major props to them for keeping smiles on their faces while dealing w/our table.\n\nAnyhow, I ordered the rabbit cassoulette, which, while tender, tasted like chicken. I was told it's supposed to taste gamier, so I don't know if that was a good thing that it didn't?  It comes with this layer of bread over it which looks like a huge hamburger bun with sesame seeds on it (the lamb only has an olive in the middle to distinguish the two).  It was kinda fun sawing into the bread and cutting it out in a nice circle to reveal my cooked bugs bunny underneath.  (I thought it would be pieces of rabbit, but turned out to be the actual bones/carcass.)  \n\nMy friend's duck tasted like the yummier part of a turkey, while my friend's lamb tasted like lamb, and my friend's mussels were really good.

My boyfriend and I opened the door to find a small, cheery looking room and a sign that said \"Welcome to Chouchou.  We love you!\"  I decided this was probably going to be a good experience.  And then I looked around - the place was really quite full.  Where would they put us?  To my surprise, we were led upstairs to a smaller dining area that was almost like a dimly lit catwalk.  We had a tiny, intimate table, and we could look down on the dining area, and at the tree hanging from the rafters.  Well, holy cow.  That was cooler than I expected.\n\nWe set about ordering, and then we set about eating.  The food and drinks were rather speedy arriving, and then got right to the business of being delicious.  Even the bread they started us off with was a brilliant combination of crusty and soft in a way that other breads can only attempt to be.  The fois gras on brioche with huckleberry compote was absolutely to die for: the juxtaposition of crunchy and creamy, of savory and sweet were enough to make my taste buds jump for joy.  My entree of puff pastry with mushrooms, celery root, and creamy goat cheese was no less amazing.  The sauce was neither heavy nor overpowering, and the melange of roots, herbs, and fungi kept both flavor and texture very interesting.  Plus, you can't go wrong with puff pastry.  It's impossible.  To finish, I had the chocolate pear tart.  Here I congratulate myself: I navigated a dizzying array of desserts to find the option that was clearly the best.  The chocolate was dark and thick, its bitterness tempered not only by the sweet pear, but by the best whipped cream I have ever had in my life.  I don't even like whipped cream, but I sure liked that.  And the portion sizes were really substantial, too, so you don't have to worry about sacrificing satisfaction for technique and artful presentation.  They have it all covered.\n\nSpeaking of which, the service was really stellar.  I know another reviewer was there the exact same night as me and was less pleased, but I've thought about it and there was just no way our waiter was anything less than superb.  He was friendly and he was helpful.  When we made it apparent that we had no idea what wines to order, he helped us make selections without making us feel awkward or bad at all.  On top of that, he came out with a couple of complimentary dessert wines for us that he had selected himself.  Our courses came out as soon as we had completed the previous, but we were left unperturbed until said completion.  Even waiters who weren't our waiter were friendly, funny, and helpful.\n\nI have to say that I was really skeptical going into dinner that night.  It was the first Christmas my boyfriend and I had ever spent on our own, and I had a lot of inner mutterings about how dinner in some restaurant just wouldn't be the same.  I was right.  It wasn't the same: it was something wholly new and wonderful.  Chouchou met and surpassed my expectations in a way that no one has done in quite a while, and gave me a truly perfect end to my holiday.", "author": "Becca S."}

The food warranted a 3-star, \"A-OK\" (which is just that: good, but not superlative) score, but the atmosphere and attentive service bumped Chou Chou up to 4 stars in my book. \n\nSmall, neighborhood restaurant, with a (at least in San Francisco) novel bonus: a small parking lot on-site! Upstairs and downstairs dining areas, and the upper area appeared to quieter and more dimly lit (romantic, perhaps?) while the lower dining area was brighter and more cheerful. Walked in on a rainy Friday evening around 6:30ish with two friends (no advance reservation), and we were seated immediately on the lower level. We dodged the supper rush, and I would advise Fri/Sat-night reservations judging by the crowd that followed us. Tables are very close together, so you may want to keep that in mind if anyone in your party has mobility issues (at least call ahead and ask for a table by the front windows). Very much a couples-on-dates kind of place. Nice crowd.\n\nOrdered: mussels with saffron, pommes frites, and foi gras for starters, and then two orders of the veal chop, and one of the beef bourguignon for our entrees. Entrees were in the $22-27 price range, and the appetizers were reasonable. The mussels were excellent, and the veal chop was outstanding. The beef bourguinon was good (but not amazing) and the foi gras was likewise. For dessert, we tried the Floating Island (very nice) and the Triple Chocolate Tart (which this chocolate-lover disliked; would agree with other reviewers that it's dry, and almost chalk-like in consistency). Would have loved to try the creme brulee or the bananas flambe, but our server reported that they were all out. Wine list was short but reasonable, and the dessert wine list had a few surprising gems. Service was excellent but not overbearing: neither the water glasses nor the bread basket ever went empty, and our server did check-in with us regarding the food, but then left us to enjoy our meal. We enjoyed our meal, and I know that I'll be back to try the duck confit (looked terrific) and those bananas...", "author": "Miss M."}

Also, brunch here is not crowded at all, so you can totally waltz in with no reservation.  The cafe au laits are large and extremely satisfying (and I've become quite a coffee snob in the last year, FYI).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-17", "description": "I came to Chou Chou for the first time soon after it opened.  I was looking for some French food, and I was morbidly curious - after all, it was in a location where so many restaurants have come and gone who knew if it'd be around for long or not?\n\nAnd it was impromptu date night, so my girlfriend and I came on down.\n\nWe had a great time.  We were well treated.  The food was great.  The wine (from their list) went well with what we both were eating.  And then... and then, stuffed, we were getting ready to pay our bill and Manu - our waiter - who had suggested we try the torte came with a piece of it for us to share.  Gratis, so that we could 'try the product.'  Oh my, oh my, we nearly made a terrible mistake - we aren't dessert people but the Chou Chou torte, my friends, is not dessert.  It's much more lovely than that, it's transcendent, it's worth the price of admission, it is what you are looking for.\n\nA few months later, I was somehow promoted at my job, and to celebrate my girlfriend arrived at my crappy little apartment with a bottle of the widow and a slice of the torte that Chou Chou was happily willing to allow her to get 'to go'.  Once again, it exceeded expectations.  Recognizing a good thing, I proposed to my girlfriend that night, and she said yes.\n\nA year after that, we served the torte to our friends and family at our wedding reception.  They were just as amazed as we were that first time, and we were happy to share our love of the place on a day that, after all, was all about love.  And more relevant to this space, they were the easiest vendor out of all of them for us to deal with.  And we dealt with many vendors.\n\nWe've been back many, many times since that first time, somewhat less so recently, but still relatively often.  I've heard that they're a bit spotty on rough nights lately, but haven't noted anything in the quality of service or food that I get.  The service has always been cheery, helpful, and efficient, the cassoulet quite good, and the torte remains, as ever, wondrous.  When it's busy it's a loud, close, happy place to be - and on some nights that's what dining out is all about.", "author": "Jacob R."}

Just coarse grained sugar baked in a tart pan until it just starts to melt and then topped with thin slices of strawberry.  At least, that's what I think it was.  So simple but so amazing.  The residual heat from the melted sugar dehydrated the berries ever so slightly which only made them MORE delicious because it concentrated their flavor to the point where they almost tasted like candy. \n\nI might have to call them and see when they have that tart on the menu again.", "author": "Jami C."}

I wasn't expecting much bc the menu seemed bare and was warned the place was really tiny.  We got there and the waiter told us to wait  a minute and I thought that was weird bc we had reservations as there were 7 in our party.  Within minutes I see the chef/owner coming towards us and he greeted us to our seating.  It was a little tight but  very cozy.  At one point he asked if we had one more guest coming and when we told him that she was looking for parking he told us that if she couldn't find parking to have her park right behind his car outside the restaurant! \n\nWe ordered the goat cheese tart, oyster soup and fries as appetizers along with wine.  All the food we ordered was excellent.  The flavors were so fresh.  I got the Kobe steak and it was delicious.  Everything from the port tenderloin w/ sauteed grapes to the salmon that was ordered was all cooked to perfection.  Each one having a special touch of flavor I've never had before.  Throughout the night I saw the chef greeting every customer who came into the door while managing to go back and forth from his busy kitchen.   \n\nTowards the end, the chef gave our party a round of complimentary champagne and sat with us for a good 10 minutes.  He literally pulled a chair and sat with us!!  What a great guy who started from nothing to doing what he loves best, creating special recipes and entertaining people!  As we left we were looking for the chef to say our goodbyes and thank yous but knew he was busy in the back so we left quietly.  As we were all standing outside the chef came out and thanked us for coming to his restaurant that night.

Ah-mazing.  \n\nHere's the breakdown of the stars: \nFOOD - 5 + 4 = 4.5 \nAMBIANCE - 3 \nSERVICE - 2 + 1 = 1.5 \nOVERALL - 3.5\n\nThe hostess / FOH was a hot mess.  I'm sorry, no matter how sweet or how cute she is, she was all over the place.  We had gotten there at 7:50p for an 8p reservation.  First off, you walk in and you kind of stand there in the middle of the restaurant and wait to be acknowledged.  So, we approach the back and we're told that they're waiting on a table to leave and that it should be 5 more minutes.  We said okay and told her we'd wait outside.  15 minutes later... she's given our table to another couple that had just waltzed in AND she doesn't recognize who we are.  Awesome.  Then, we're seated thisclose to the two tables on either side of us.  You could see the expression on the other two couple's faces as they were being seated, \"Oh. Um, ohh kay.\"  The waiters themselves are an off shoot.  Rude and brusque - just like in Paris!  Love it, lol.  \n\nBut, the best part and the saving grace - the food.  Hubby and I were here for DAT 2010 (w00t!).  I started with the Fris\u00e9e salad served with poached egg, saut\u00e9ed pancetta and cherry balsamic vinaigrette.  Egg was cooked perfectly and bacon really does make everything better.  Hubby had the endive tart tatin - carmelized endive and goat cheese.  As E. put it, it was \"different\"; he sort of felt it served better as a dessert, really.  I liked it and thought the flavors meshed well.  For the main event, I had the lamb chops served with truffle French toast, mushrooms, fingerling potatoes, zucchini, black truffle oil, and baby carrots.  The lamb was cooked perfectly.  I ordered it medium and they hit it on the mark.  So tender and juicy, perfectly complemented by the sauce and veggies.  E. had a heaping bowl of mussels, which came in this white sauce of shallots, garlic, parsley, cream and white wine.  Perfect for dipping your bread into and the mussels were a decent size.  Served with an order of fries, which the he didn't particularly enjoy.  Though in the end, he was dipping his fries in the sauce.  Now, dessert.  We had the chocolate tart and the strawberry bruschetta.  The tart was a bit disappointing.  While not horrible, it did nothing to illicit an \"mmm\" reaction from me.  The strawberry bruschetta was served with sliced strawberries, ice cream and toasted bread (maybe it was French toast?).  Very refreshing and tasty.  \n\nThe food took me to another zone.  I had completely forgotten about the start of our food journey here... until the very end.  I was watched as a table of 4 was seated, then asked to move over 10 minutes later to accommodate another party of 4.  They were all less than amused.  The table next to us was asked if they could finish their meal at the bar so that another couple could be seated.  The couple bowed out gracefully and left without any fanfare.  It was like a bad game of Diner Dash being played out right in front of my eyes.  \n\nAh, but I digress.  The food is definitely something to tell your friends and family about.  I know we'll eventually come back to try some of the other items on their menu.  Hopefully the service won't be as frenetic.  Then again, I probably won't notice once the parade of food is at the table.  :)", "author": "Shereen R."}

The chocolate was to die for...the consistency of a ganache and SOO chocolately...tasted like bittersweet chocolate.\n\nNick was not there, he is in Italy with his wife for 2 weeks but the staff was very friendly and attentive this time around.\n\nAs usual, will be back.", "author": "Maria M."}

It almost seems too french, perhaps the owners instruct every waiter to use a fake accent?  Does that sound paranoid?\nAnyway, you're going to find simple and classic french fare here.  Their specialty is the cassoulette, a clay pot filled with various ingredients in a light gravy and covered with a pastry shell.

I have to warn you though, if you are seated upstairs, bring a portable A/C.  Man oh man, it had to have been at least 10 degrees hotter up there... especially when you're inhaling a hot bowl of french onion soup which was super delish I might add.  My friend's escargot was pretty good -- a little more chewy than other escargot I've tried... creative little idea to pile them up into a hollow bone.  I loved the sauce/soup for the mussels... creamy but very light!  My friend's steak was delicious too -- I'm a big fan of sauces so that was quite tasty.

Even though I had a bad experience (literally at the very end of the meal), do note that the food (especially the tarts) was really good and I thought it had great value. I encourage you to form your own opinion about the restaurant.\n\nThis day shall go down in infamy. Asked to vacate a table because we had already paid the bill, not once, but twice in the same day. Both places French to boot. The second time happened at Chou Chou and it had not been more than 5 minutes since the cc slip had been signed. Up to that point I was happy with the restaurant, but I am never coming back here again.\n\nAmbiance (3): Little bistro place, nothing fancy. Music was at times inappropriate (Sexual Feeling by Marvin Gaye) and with so much good French music out there, I think it would be appropiate to play some of that.  \n\nFood (4): I enjoyed the food actually. The menu is a bit sparse, but all the typical food types (meat/seafood/vegetarian) are represented. We tried the mussels (plump, good broth), pomme frittes (too small, like pik-niks), escargot (great, presented in a bone and mixed with some marrow I believe), steak tartare (good), lamb dish (generous portion compared with everything else, never knew truffle oil paired so well with lamb), beef (stuffed with plums, delish), chocolate and walnut truffle (great flavors and balance between ingredients), and apricot truffle (perfect, take one home).  My favorite dish was the lamb and overall everything was good and tasty.\n\nService (1): Ok servers, nothing memorable about the table service. Everything was fine until they gave us the boot. Now, I know a restaurant needs to crank out as many services as possible, but we had not been sitting there that long after signing the check. If I wanted to hurry along my way I would have gone to a taco truck or ordered delivery or something. I go out to eat for not only the sustenance factor, but also for the experience, which usually includes some good conversation. If we had been there half an hour or even fifteen minutes squatting at the table and being obnoxious jerks, I get it, but it had barely been a few minutes. This to me is unacceptable for a sit down eatery, be it a restaurant or bistro. At the very least come up with a nice way of doing it and tell me something other than we need the table. Figuring out what that way is is not my effing problem, that's your job and you failed at it during my visit.  \n\nValue (4): The prices of the appetizers were good and of the entrees typical fancy French place. Twenty two bucks for two tasty pieces of beef stuffed with plums is par for the course. Fourteen dollars for a big bowl of mussels is good.  \n\nOverall: I would have come back to Chou Chou despite having to drive there for some good French food for sure. Maybe not more than once a year (let's face it, there are way too many restaurants in the city proper to have to trek out to the edges of the city), but it was worth another visit. As it stands, Chou Chou you are blacklisted. You broke my heart Chou Chou, you broke my heart.", "author": "Alvaro H."}

My friend found this spot on Yelp so we decided to check it out. \n\nMy first thought was, \"Where are we?!\" ChouChou is located in Twin Peaks, I think. I never venture to this area so for me, it felt like visiting a foreign land. \n\nThe maitre'd was French, which always makes a French restaurant feel that much more authentic. The space was open and comfortable, and the second floor had small tables with lamps that reminded me of a French Cabaret. \n\nAnd then there was the food. When I think French cuisine, I think \"$$$$\", but this place was surprisingly affordable. It was also absolutely delicious. The escargot appetizer was rich, but perfectly combined with a crisp bread and a slightly-acidic sauce. The warm goat cheese salad also shared a perfect flavor balance with the pear and arugula pairing. \n\nThe main courses were warm, rich and comforting. I had the duck confit with its crispy and extremely fattening skin. Although it was a bit on the salty side, it was very satisfying. Dessert fell a bit flat for us. The floating island wasn't a hard meringue like I expected and the tarte could've used more crust. \n\nOverall, I would undoubtedly come here again when I'm looking for some comforting French food without dropping serious cash.", "author": "eileen b."}

I sensed most of the customers are regulars here. \n\nThe food came at appropriate times. Anatoly, our server was friendly and lively, and the owner-chef Nick stopped by to greet us when he came in and stopped by again to ask how our food was after our meal. Not intrusive at all.\n\nWe ordered the home made Foie Gras au Tochon for appetizer, it was delicious! Followed by the rabbit cassolette with a side of potato gratin. It was good, and Anatoly recommended a glass of syrah to go with it.\n\nWhen we were done with our entrees, our next table found out that it was our first time dining at Chouchou and told Nick, the owner-chef that.

If you want to know, he will tell you, and happily so.\n\nFrisee salad comes with a poached egg and a hefty portion of pancetta.  The frisee is fresh, the pancetta perhaps a bit too much of a good thing, but the poached egg is overdone and doesn't release its yolk when cut.  Too bad, it would have added an additional savory element to the plate.  Still a nice plate of food. \n\nA main course of lamb cassolette is covered with a pastry dome that is cut by your waiter at the table.  I look into the dish and search for the ubiquitous filler, you know carrots, celery and the like.  None.  These guys have filled the dish with nicely braised lamb.  A few black olives and a few potatoes finish the dish off.  This is what this place is all about.  Good bistro food, happily transported from the kitchen to you.   At a bargain price.\n\nThe host asks me whether I might try a tart for dessert.  He tells me of ten available.  I ask his advice.  He says I must try them all!  A bit latter he comes back with ten slices. Variations on chocolate and variations on fruit.  I liked the fruit best.   \n\nShortly after the tarts arrive the host reappears.  With some gratis sherry.  Can't have the tarts by themselves.  \n\nWhen I leave the host shakes my hand and wishes me good speed.  See what sort of place this is?

The black truffle beurre blanc sauce was seasoned just right. The halibut on the other hand could have been cooked slightly less.\n\nChilean Sea Bass - Fish was tasty. Sun dried tomato and bacon really gave the dish some powerful flavours. Sauce may even have been slightly over seasoned, but that's the way we liked it.

You've got to have great food, and great service.  The fact that Chouchou is thriving after five years in this unexpected location shows that they've mastered the food and service, along with a warm, unpretentious atmosphere that just makes you want to come back.\n\nWhen we entered, we were greeted with a warm handshake by the friendly chef/owner, Nick Ronan, who immediately showed us to our table despite the fact that (a) it was a Saturday night, and (b) we were 10 minutes early for our reservation, and (c) the place was packed.  Unbeknownst to us, there are a few additional tables on a narrow mezzanine above the main dining area.\n\nService was prompt and friendly, without being overbearing.

My wife's fish was a bit mushy but not bad.  The flavor was light and you could actually taste the freshness of the fish.   A friend got the steak and that was a bit chewy for my taste but she seemed to enjoy it.  Desserts were quite good, though.

It came out looking like a giant pot pie but once I carved into it, I could see how shallow it actually was, which would be fine if the contents had been substantial.  It was inadequately filled with small prawns, very thinly sliced potatoes that were too sparse, and one big scallop in the center. Unfortunately it consisted mostly of broth, which was kind of creamy.  It was really more of a soup than a casolette.  \n\nAs for dessert, my friend and I both ordered a fruit tart. She got the chocolate mandarin and I got the pear...she complained that hers was too overpowered by the chocolate and I didn't much care for mine because the pears didn't seem that fresh and I felt the crust was too sweet.  It was also too dense to be authentically French.  The crust had a bottom layer of crystallized (or caramelized?) sugar on the bottom which I thought was weird because it completely overpowered the natural sweetness of the pears. Too bad. \n\nI would also mention that it's a little bit expensive for what you get.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-27", "description": "My friend and I came to this French bistro with a \"Provencal feel\" in San Francisco's Forest Hills neighborhood on Fri, Dec 25, 2009. Chouchou in French means a blue-eyed boy; a teacher's pet or other group favorite, a hair scrunchie, or a term of endearment, being derived from \"chou\", which is slang for sweetheart. The name most likely a reference to the latter, this darling of a bistro was packed as we entered, with people about to be seated just ahead of us. The chef himself, Nick Ronan, showed us upstairs to our table on the mezzanine.  The pretty good decor consists downstairs of art for sale on the walls, while the mezzanine offers soft blue walls with French food-related words painted on them. For my appetizer, I had the homemade \"Rougie-France\" (founded in 1875 and based in the medieval town of Sarlat in the Perigord region of France, the #1 producer of foie gras) Foie Gras Torchon (torchon is the French word for the cloth used to wrap the foie gras and then poach it)  served with sauteed pistachios, medjool dates, and figs, $15. The foie gras was rich, buttery, and delicate. One assumes that the foie gras is made from moulard (a hybrid cross of Peking duck and Muscovy/Barberie duck) duck liver. My friend had the butter lettuce served with cherry tomatoes, croutons, and mustard vinaigrette. He found it a little under-dressed. For my entree I had the special, Sun and moon (a reference to hot/cooked and cold/raw) pan-seared wild king salmon served on a bed of wild king salmon tartar, with a rose of fresh fettuccini, shallot confit and oseille (sorrel) sauce, $25; oseille can also be slang for dough, as in this was an expensive entree! But well worth it, as I enjoyed the two variations on the fish as well as the sauce and pasta. My friend had the Menage a Trois: rack of lamb with mascarpone polenta and plum coulis; chicken breast with fondue of carrots and thyme sauce; and pork tenderloin with dates and figs, and a foie gras sauce. He thought the portion was a little small, but finished it all (and later he couldn't finish his dessert, and not because it was bad). Our server Damien did a good job of keeping us supplied with the good and warm homemade baguette bread. We also had the garlic spinach, $5, very good. I ordered the justifiably famous homemade mixed fruit tart, $6, containing apricot, pear, mandarin orange, and blueberry). It was so good, I loved every bite. My friend ordered the chocolate mandarin orange tart; it was very chocolatey and very moist. I would've preferred more mandarin orange on the tart, but I'm not a chocolate fan, so that's why I ordered the mixed fruit tart. The chef was gracious enough to shake my hand as I left the restaurant. I enjoyed my experience dining at Chouchou, and would not mind making it my pet favorite, especially at these prices! This was the first year that Chouchou was open on Christmas, and hopefully it was a success that bears repeating.", "author": "Hao L."}

The reason that there is a change in atmosphere and quality in food is because I just heard Chef Nick Ronan has moved to Bisou :( I will be going there from now on**\n\nThis is about my fifth time here and I always seem to be coming with a new group of people every time. This time around I brought my dad's side of the family here. I'm actually used to having the chef come and greet with the customary kiss kiss, but there was none such greeting this time. We were seated promptly because it was a (not so busy) Sunday night. Unfortunately my experience here this time wasn't that great. When we were served water it was warm and tasted slightly of cooked meat. I had given rave reviews about their french onion soup, but they have changed it since the last time that I was here. They put mustard seeds in it now. I definitely don't remember that. The taste of the soup was good, but there was way too much cheese and too many mustard seeds. The escargot, while the flavor was there it lacked a little hint of salt to it. I also had the foie gras terrine, which was divine, melt in your mouth awesome goodness. It's also hard to mess up. I was also disappointed that they didn't have the steak tartare that I love getting here. I am not sure why it isn't on the menu anymore. \nFor the main course we had beef bourguignon, the duck, veal, and mussels. The mussels were spot on for taste and so was the duck. My family really liked the duck especially because the duck was cooked so well. It was falling apart so easily (a good thing) and yet still crispy around the outside at the same time. It also had the reduction of blueberries or huckleberries (not sure which), which gave the dish a nice taste to cut the heaviness of the duck. I think I only ordered the beef bourguignon just so my family could try it, but I personally don't like it. I don't think they did either. The Veal was cooked very nicely, I just wished that they had better knives because I felt like I was sawing through that piece of meat for a while. \nWe ended the night by sharing a creme brulee which was standard to the taste and a good portion.\n\nAlso I would minus a star because I reserved this on opentable.com and they didn't give me my points!\n\nAll in all I was actually a little disappointed this time around :( Sorry Chouchou.", "author": "Kathy B."}

We were stationed upstairs which I feel was a disadvantage because none of the servers (the ladies) wanted to make their way up the bumpy and hazardous stairs.  We started with sparkling water, which was definitely overpriced ($6/bottle), and that was the last time we saw our server.  Another person came to help us for the rest of the night, he was pleasant but I think he was the busboy.  We both ordered the mussels which came in good portion size and quite tasty but I've had better.  And we both ordered the Angus Steak which was a big mistake.  The steak seemed burnt and crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside. Not that great... After which seemed like forever, our \"server\" came back up to bring our desserts, and by that time, I was full and could barely enjoy our desserts.  The service was horrible, our real server never came back up and I felt neglected upstairs.  Not to mention that there's only one unisex bathroom and when we left, no one had the decency to say bye.

There are much better places to eat for much less and better food. For two couples we spent $180 + tip. We had one DAT, the Hangersteak, the seared bass, and the mushroom souffle for dinner. The french onion soup was ok, too be honest the Trader Joe's frozen packs taste equally the same (not to say that they're good). The sea bass fish was very oily and the run-off went into my green beans which tasted fishy and oily. Portions are pretty small. The souffle was too wet and soggy and didn't have much flavor, a little too plain. Jacqueline's is much better.  The only redeeming grace here was the Pinot wine and the creme brulee. The soft meringue was more like soft marshmallows and melted ice cream. Servers didn't come by often enough to refill my water and we waited quite a while to get the check. I wouldn't recommend coming here and I wouldn't come back except for the vanilla creme brulee which was delicious in the cute heart plate.

The area downstairs looks good for parties of 3 or more, but for an intimate date night, try to reserve one of the 5 upstairs balcony tables that you have to travel through part of the kitchen to get to.  From there, you get a bird's eye view of the other patrons on the ground floor.  The experience feels slightly unsafe, as the floor is slanted, the walkway is very narrow, and the railing separating you and the floor below is very low.  However, after a drink or two, you stop thinking about what would happen to you in the event of a tragic earthquake and start enjoying what is a very unique dining experience.\r\n\r\nThe food is also quite good...The cassoulettes are the house specialty.  It's like a pot pie, only with a harder crust instead of the traditional soft puff pastry.  It's cooked in a clay pot with a rich wine-flavored lamb stew.

(Food was alright, but nowhere near good enough to make up for the horrendous, rude and terrible service.) I will never, EVER come back here again.\n\nI was here with about a group of 10 for the Dine About Town special. Each of our prix-fixe meal was about $40-50, so plus their generous self-calculating tip, our total bill was $500+. You'd think that given the impending payout, the service would be top-notch. Nope. Wrong.\n\nFirst, throughout the whole dinner service, I happened to be seated next to their dessert cabinet/fridge. Their desserts seemed popular, the waiters kept opening the fridge. Good for them. Each time they opened the door, however, it would ram it into our table. Not a gentle tap. No no no. A good solid knockin'. Think of it this way. If you had a full glass of water, the water would spill. No apologies. No nothing. Every. Five. Minutes. Bam!\n\nThe crowning jewel of their \"excellent\" service came at the end of the night when we were paying our bill. As my friends and I anticipated the situation, everyone came prepared with cash to make splitting the bill easier. So our whole bill was paid in cash. Not unusual, right? To make things clear, we didn't pay the bill in coins. Or single bills. 95% of our cash was in $20's and $10's. Since I happened to sit at the end (Bam!), I was delegated to handle the bill. I double checked our amount. We're good.  I triple checked the amount. We're good. I asked my friend next to me to count one last time. Yup. We're good and paid in full. I hand our bill directly into the hands of the manager (not wearing waiter-uniform but still running around), because I knew we paid in cash and didn't want any funny business.\n\nOur group gets up to leave and we say our goodbyes to each other just outside the restaurant. With such a big group, our goodbyes take a while. The first half of the group leaves, and the rest of us walk to the parking lot. As the rest of us says goodbye there, the manager comes storming out of the restaurant and comes running straight at me. He's yelling that I shorted them and that I didn't pay the bill. I'm very confused so I, by myself, walk back into the FULL restaurant, WITH ALL THE OTHER DINERS STARING AT ME, to see what was going on. We walk ALL THE WAY BACK to the end of the place where the bar is at and he has the money all laid out. He reiterates that I cheated them and didn't pay my full bill. I calmly and politely asked if he checked his counting of the money. He looks at me like I'm crazy and says \"Yes. OF COURSE.\" I ask him politely if he wouldn't mind doing it again. With the rest of the staff and the entire restaurant staring at me. He looks incredibly annoyed but he does it again. So he starts to count all the bills again. \n\nHe counts, counts, counts. Say, the bill was $500. He gets up counting \"440... .460....\" As he's nearing the end of the stack of bills, a look of realization passes his face. There's still $40 left in his hand and his count is $460. He continues counting. \"480....\" one bill left \"$500\". Our bill was $500. He says \"Oh.\" I ask if there's anything else he needs. He says \"No\". I turn to leave. I walk all the way through the entire restaurant, again, with the whole place staring at me. \n\nDid anyone apologize? No. \nDid anyone say sorry? No. \nDid anyone say, \"oops, my bad?\" \nNO. NO. NO. NO. I couldn't believe it.\nI've never been so publicly embarrassed nor insulted in my life. Not a single member of the staff even apologized for THEIR mistake. \n\nI never want to come back here again. I would not send my worst enemy here either.", "author": "Katherine W."}

I ordered it again tonight and it was even better. The duck was so tender but what really made this dish was how nicely caramelised the puff pastry was. It is served over little square potatoes and a maple vinaigrette--delectable, so I sent my compliments to the Chef. Hubby enjoyed his boeuf bourguignon, but recalled the beef being more tender; nevertheless, he loved it which was evident by the empty plate.  \nThe service was outstanding.

Creamy and crazy flavorful.  the bisque also had large chuncks of king crab as an added bonus...DELICIOUS.  \n\nThe steak was flawless and served with au gratin style potatoes.\nFor dessert I had the apricot tart.  Don't be fooled into thinking that it just isnt dessert without chocolate! GET THE TART\n\nThank you chou chou for helping me ring in my new year happy and full.", "author": "Carley B."}

We were seated under an adorable dog/Eiffel tower photo. Did I mention the place is French? It is very very French, from the Paris photos to the French Chef that actually took my arm to escort me to the (not at all hard to find) restroom. I chose to find this charming.\n\nThe crowd was diverse in age, dress and style (if not income bracket). It seemed like it was a neighborhood spot (the lovely and little known Forest Hill). There is plenty of parking, by the way, either in the small lot next to the restaurant or in the residential streets behind it. \n\nBy 12pm things had become a bit insane. The quiet bistro had transformed into a bustling SF brunch spot and the tables felt really really close together. I think this may be \"Parisian\" but it is hard to have an intimate brunch while inescapably listening to the older couple 4 inches to your right arguing about whether or not to throw out the 8 VCRs in the basement. \"But they may be worth some thing some day!\"\n\nBut I digress. Service slowed down once the hoards arrived but it was still good. We needed to ask for more bread a few times, but it did come. \n\nBut on to the food. The mussels were wonderful, the best I have had in the city. I am an East Coaster so I am used to fresh Prince Edward Island mussels and these excelled. The frites were standard crispy fried bits. And the bread was fresh, crusty and perfect for dipping into the broth...\n\nWhich brings me to the broth. The best part of the meal. It was cream based but not too heavy and perfectly seasoned with garlic and shallots. Very decadent, but I admit I ate it like a soup after I finished the mussels. \n\nMy vegetarian companion enjoyed the chef's omelet with cheese, red peppers and fried potatoes. They even let him substitute the caesar salad (he is a vegetarian with an aversion to most vegetables) for frites. \n\nThe very friendly chef said goodbye with a kiss on the cheek and a complimentary apricot tart to go. Delicious mussels and free dessert? I'm going back.", "author": "Rebecca A."}

One of the reasons why this place gets a five.\n\nIf a wait staff of two can pull together the exquisite entrees and still be friendly while sweaty - they've got my vote.\n\nSoju is this great Asian alcohol that the head waiter/owner has put in all of his cocktails.  It's a fabulous addition to the Mango Lemon Drop and the Lychee Martini.  The waiters (all two of them) even rolled over to take a shot with all us seated at the five-person large bar.

Mussels and fries are one of my all-time favorite meals, but can be hard to come by at a reasonable price. We found Chouchou thanks to Yelp and were able to walk right in and get a table at 8 PM on a Friday night, though the place was pretty much full.\n\nI got a LOT of love on our visit. The host put his arm around me as he led me to our table. And Nick, the owner, kissed my hand not once, but THREE times of the course of our visit. This might be off-putting to some, but he is French - come on!\n\nAs for the food - I had the mussels with white wine and garlic and frites of course. The mussels were some of the tastiest I've had in SF, and were reasonably priced, with fries for about $18. Nick told me he has a million recipes for mussels and that he would change it up for me the next time I come back - I felt like a star.\n\nMy husband had the coq au vin, which he reported to be tasty, but the portion was a bit too small for the price. We finished the meal with the chocolate tart which was delicious.\n\nNick brought us two glasses of champagne at the end of the meal and chatted us up for a while. The hospitality here is unmatched, if you're open to that kind of thing. When we got the check we saw that one of my husbands glasses of wine had been comped.

I made our reservation on OpenTable, which would only let me reserve for 14, so in the notes I asked if 16 would be possible. 2 days later I got a call from Nick informing me that they'd be delighted to host my party of 16.\n\nThe night of the party when we arrived at the restaurant he greeted us at the door with a hug and a kiss on the cheek for me, handshakes for all of the boys, & kisses on the hand for all of the girls. The table they'd set up for us was a ton of 4-person tables all lined up against a booth, so I had to keep moving to socialize, which was fine. (I might not recommend taking a huge group there for this reason though.)\n\nEveryone was able to order separately, which was nice. Most of us ordered from the 3-course menu ($25.95).\n\nFor  my appetizer I had the Oeuf Cocotte (Poached eggs served with black Truffles, bacon \"mouillette\") & it was outstanding! I can't explain how much I loved this thing.\n\nFor my entree I had a heaping bowl of steamed mussels served with a butter - garlic - chive - shallot soupy dressing. Oh MAN SO GOOD. One of my friends who'd never had mussels before ordered this too & he absolutely loved it.\n\nOthers around me had the butter lettuce salad (one friend complained that it was too mustard-y & too dill-y -- but these are 2 flavors that he doesn't like) & soup du jour, which that day was a really tasty potato & leek soup.\n\nOther entrees (from the set menu) included a baked casolette that people seemed generally to be absolutely thrilled with, and tortellini that were just scrumptious. (Like Miriam, I sampled all around.)\n\nMy fiance ordered a la carte: For an appetizer he had the Charcuterie Plate (Selections of cure artisanal meats served with cornichons and toasted baguette), which he thoroughly enjoyed; for his entree, the duck confit, which was very tasty.\n\nAnother friend got the smoked salmon salad, which she loved; & one more ordered that night's special, the filet mignon (delicious!).\n\nOverall the service was very good; Nick came by to check on us pretty regularly (calling me by name each time). A couple of small things were forgotten (a bowl of mussels came late; we got an extra dessert tart (which we weren't charged for); a coffee was forgotten), but it wasn't a big deal at all.\n\nWith 1 bottle of wine (which was split among 6 people) it came to roughly $40 per person.

Cute place in a good location (two minutes' walk from the Forest Hill metro station, right across from Laguna Honda Hospital). We arrived rather ahead of our reservation, but the hostess managed to find us a table even though the place was packed. \n\nWe started with the cheese plate since it was one of the few vegetarian appetizers available for my boyfriend to eat. The cheeses were all really good, but the portions were a bit small. The jellies and other fruit preparations that came with it were good, but it would have been really nice for the server to tell us what cheeses we were eating and what all of the stuff it came with was! \n\nI had the scallops for my entree, which came with a cauliflower-truffle veloute, mushrooms, and port-glazed beets. The scallops were cooked well and served hot, but the rest of the plate was kind of lukewarm, like they had let it sit for five minutes while they finished cooking the scallops. It also needed some kind of greens or something because while six scallops is an okay serving size for the actual meat of the course, a smearing of cauliflower and some mushrooms doesn't really cut it for filling me up. The boyfriend had a mushroom souffle (one of two veggie entrees), it was pretty good. For dessert I had a chocolate pear tart, and he had a chocolate mandarin orange tart. (they had run out of creme brulee and the chocolate almond tart by 9 PM, wtf?) Dessert was tasty but nothing special. \nWine selections by the glass were limited (four reds, four whites, one rose) but I picked a Colombard from the Russian River valley that wound up being pretty tasty in addition to being the only local glass on the menu. I was pleased that they had Dow's port by the glass with the dessert menu. \n\nSo the food was okay. The service was attentive and respectful, but the kitchen was _sloooow_. It must have been 15 or 20 minutes from when we _finished_ our appetizer to when the entree showed up. What? And then mine was sort of cold? Not sure whether to blame the server or the kitchen here -- it was a busy night, but there was always someone coming over with more bread or water. Not so great when your food comes out cold. \n\nThe food quality was probably worth four stars, but the slow kitchen and small portions for the prices knock it down to three.

However, not too seasoned, so it' was ok.  It was prepared very well in a bacon potato base, but there was no taste at all to the duck.  But again, prepared very well.  Crispy, juicy, and light.\n\nThe chocolate tart was 'yawn'.  Not even worth the taste.  It was very Safeway Selecty.  But alas, at least it wasn't bad.\n\nThe lamb casserole looked very appetizing (like a rich man's pot pie), but the filling was soupy, the lamb was gamey (I like gamey, but this was like eating lamb sashimi).  Great idea, bad execution.  But that's just my opinion.\n\nThey serve warm toasted bread (nice), a very broad wine list (try the gamay), and the spot is quaint with attention to detail.  It's a small place, perfect for a weeknight date with the s.o., but not so much for a big group.  I'd say about 10 tables with some table upstairs.  NIce vaulted ceilings keeps the noise manageable.  The location at the West Portal makes it feel a little warm, cozy, and exclusive.", "author": "Isaac L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-23", "description": "Hmmm, here is my maiden voyage to French cuisine. I came here with my husband and two dear friends, one of whom came from France. I did my research prior to arriving so I wouldn't take all day trying to figure out what I wanted to try  that evening and decided on:\nEndive Tart Tatin: Yellow Belgian endive Tart Tatin stuffed with goat cheese Cumin powder and caramel...wow, this truly was my maiden voyage, as much as I thought I did my research, I wasn't sure what a \"tart tatin\" would look like. It was thin layers of endive made into a small hill full of flavor. In between the layers were small pockets of goat cheese, I imagined it to be one leaf of endive filled with goat cheese, perhaps being overwhelming. No, it was an even smattering of goat cheese inbetween the layers that went beautifully with the caramel sauce accompanying the sides, it was a masterpiece. The cumin accentuated the symphony of goat cheese and buttery caramel as the endives kept everything in sync. I didn't want it to end.\nOk, so the main course, I chose the Sea and Ocean Trilogy. Again, small portions, big plate. Only, this was three individual servings of each mentioned dish, a seared scallop, a piece of wild black cod, and instead of salmon, it was mahi mahi. Each serving of fish and or sea food was an awakening of the taste buds, it was a treasure chest of concentrated delight for each of the three dishes. And the beauty of it, I was FULL by the last bite, not overblown stuffed and uncomfortably full but satisfied and fulfilled.\nNow this is the part that made me wake up with an epiphone, I groaned thinking, or assuming that big plate small portion night was going to leave me hungry.  Bottom line, \"Assume\" makes an ass out of u and me, I understand the smaller portions and coming to understand the gluttony of Americans. Each dish was intentionally \"small\" but it wasn't small, I was taught from other restaurants, you must leave with a doggy bag or just overwhelmingly and uncomfortably full. Each dish was JUST RIGHT, masterfully made so that you appreciated the flavors and the ingredients, you could make out the work that was put into the dishes, like it was lovingly made and the chef knew how you would feel with each bite. \nAll four of us ordered different things from the menu so I can explain what they had and how they enjoyed it. \nEscargots \"a la Bourguignone\", we thought snails in a shell, no biggy. NO, it came out looking similar to mine, a small hill, it was a beef bone with a wonderful center of escargot infused with buttery bone marrow (sigh~~~), and my husband had the cannelloni of zucchini, cute little cannelloni shells made of thin slices of zucchini stuffed with crab, and my friend next to me ordered the Foie Gras, I was so tempted to steal his plate. A slice of foie gras to accompany two slices of toasted baguette and I couldn't make out the rest because my dish arrived at the same time and soon I was busy trying not to devour it too quickly with my eyes and my mouth.\nTo end the evening, we had several pieces of the tarts. I was skeptical since I was already full and I am not a chocolate person (don't judge me on this) nor a tart crust person (pie crust is gross to me). AGAIN, I was amazed at the tarts!!! We had the apricot, the pear, the mixed fruit, the chocolate almond and the chocolate walnut. You would think that was too many for four people that were full. There was not one morsel of any of the FIVE tarts left after we had our way with them (evil laugh). The chocolate tarts, holy cow, they weren't cloyingly over sweet or overwhelming with the bitterness of walnut, I even liked the walnut one and I was apprehensive. The chocolate was real cocoa on layers of nuts that were there for texture and flavor. The fruit tarts were amazing and fresh, the crust was \"buttery\" and delicious. I guess this is what you would call \"not your store bought variety\" that I realize I was so used to. Served with fresh whipped cream, wow, and I thought I couldn't eat one more bite...\nI can go on and on about this place but I'll just finish it with this, my husband is one picky guy, so picky that if you even mention something that he doesn't like such as cantelope or asparagus, he will not eat his food. He loved everything, the wine, amazing baguette and butter, and his food. He thought the same thing, small portions, big plates, groan....no, he too was full by the end and he usually gets hungry because he's trying to be polite about the food. \nI must say, I will be sure to return and perhaps try the foie gras this time....\nOops, before I forget, the staff was very nice and personable, my friend from France mentioned that the French do not hurry meals so they were very accomodating as we lingered with our last bite. They brought us out some lovely sparkling wine because they heard it was my husband's birthday. Overall, a great experience and a planned return.", "author": "Natasha C."}

The entree I got the duck wellington. It was nicely presented though had no flavor.. The duck was dry and hard inside the pastry dough.  The potatoes that came along side tasted better however.  Lastly, the dessert I got the vanilla creme brullee.. this was decent but very small.  It had good vanilla flavor but wished it was a little deeper dish.

In fact, it is a little crowded - especially if you have to wait for a table as there is no place to wait.\n\nMy experience on this particular evening unfortunately made my overall perception of the place lower than what it has potential for. I made a reservation and showed up promptly, but was made to wait, with no where to wait, for over 20 mins for an available table while I was standing right next to an empty table. Is there anything more frustrating in a restaurant than that?.

But I only ever am driving by on my way to the Empire Cinemas in West Portal (one of the last remaining civilized movie-viewing establishments in San Francisco), and thus am not necessarily prepared for a proper French meal.\n\nBut after reading some other reviews on Yelp, I decided to shake things up and pair movie night with that very proper French meal - and boy was that a good idea! It was a Friday evening and I found myself in the rare position of not collapsing on the couch as I started doing once I passed the age of 27. I jumped onto OpenTable and easily snagged an 8:30 reservation. And things continued to be easy from there. \"Whoa, is this a parking lot?! Wait, is that an actual spot in their actual parking lot?\" \n\nMy husband and I walked into the cozy space, and it was packed - and much to my surprise, it was not at all a stuffy tablecloth kinda place. There was pretty loud music (but definitely at proper speaking-over-it volume), a bar with a few stools straight ahead, and a somewhat modern-meets-Euro decor that I found really refreshing. We weren't standing in the doorway long before the maitre'd greeted us - a handshake for my husband, and a Euro-double-kiss for me. This experience teetered just properly on the verge of awkward, setting the stage for the type of service we should expect - friendly and familiar. He informed us quite straightforwardly that they were running late (so much for that 8:30 reservation), but then returned moments later with two glasses of rose champagne - nice touch! I'm very pleased already, and have immediately cast aside concerns about our 10:15 movie time.\n\nFortunately, we didn't wait too much longer before we were seated at an intimate corner table by the window. I'd heard endless praise for the mussels and fries, so we had to order up the appetizer portion - holy crap, this is good. It's a good thing they refresh your bread basket every 5 minutes with that delightful fresh, warm, toasty baguette...because we were sopping up the cream sauce the mussels left behind like wild animals.\n\nThe entrees mostly kept pace with the appetizer - my Poisson du Marseille, a seafood dish in yet another cream sauce with leeks and other delights, was rich and excellent. My husband was less impressed by his roast chicken, but you know, ordering the chicken at a restaurant is rarely a good idea. The wines the kiss-kiss man recommended pairing with our meals were delicious, and the list is expansive for those of you who like to get your Napa on. \n\nI'm still waiting to savor dessert - we had to run out with a pear chocolate tarte to-go if we had any hope of catching \"Dark Knight.\" But I'm feeling pretty confident.  We'll definitely be back!\n\nNOTE: We did notice that...well, not every woman received the special greeting from said maitre'd - it seems there was some sort of, um, selection process.

The ride on the L was super fast and easy, and the restaurant is literally just a few steps up the hill from the station.  \n\nFrom the moment we walked in it felt like we were somewhere in Europe.  The chef/owner Nick immediately asked us if we had been helped.  While a table was being set, he poured us 2 nice glasses of wine for our wait.  They sat us a great table for two by the window and then the magic began.\n\nFirst off, the food is amazing!  I had the ravioli and my husband had one of their famous cassolettes with lamb.  Both her finger licking good.  Our appetizer was Ocuf Cocotte, which was the most amazing baked egg, truffle and bacon.  Even the bread was incredible, brought out hot and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

Our waiter, who was the perfect mix of helpful not hovering ended up bringing us 2 tarts, as well as a desert champagne cocktail that was to die for.  Before we payed, he gave us a tart for the road too.  I have had tarts in Paris many times, and the ones I had last night were better.  \n\nThe highlight though was when we were about 10 feet out the door, and Nick came running after us.  We had watched him make an effort to greet and say goodbye to every patron in his place, which I can tell you is rare for a chef.  The fact that he ran after us to say thank you, hugged us both, and wanted to make sure we had a good time, was priceless.

I have not had French food that much in the states and this is the first French restaurant I ate at after returning from my honeymoon in France. The only other French place I ate at was First Crush years ago and this was much more intimate and lovely than First Crush (more Californian French than real French like Chouchou). \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is small, about 12 tables on the first flower and a few two-seaters on the narrow balcony upstairs. The place is decorated colorfully (in a tasteful way) and the staff is nice without being haughty. The ambiance is what I prefer, close to business casual, no tank tops but no obligatory tie/suit jacket either. Being a more casual neighborhood spot, there were families with kids as well as couples.\r\nIf you want a more romantic aura, request the tables upstairs (that is what I will do next time). \r\n\r\nMy husband ordered the seafood cassoulette and as this was the first time either of us had had it, I cannot say how it compares to other places as another yelper said it was not as good as it was before. To us, it was very good. I ordered the standard steak and frites and it was great. The steak was good (I ordered medium rare) but the frites were fantastic! \r\n\r\nThe best thing really, is their bread and tartes. The pastry chef use to own a bakery in Paris and his breads, chocolate, and tartes were top-notch. Their bar is also wonderful! I ordered the Princess cocktail (infused with rose) and it was like drinking a pure, crisp rose petal. It was very delicious and the muscat that we ordered with the chocolate/pear tarte was the best we have ever tasted. Sweet and lush, with just the right level of alcohol (some muscats we have had at other places tasted more watery and had too much alcohol, overwhelming the muscat flavor). The tarte had deep flavors of chocolate, but in a French way that was subdued and not overly sweet like many American chocolate deserts. I ordered a cappuccino and it was good but not as good as their other stuff. \r\n\r\nThey also welcome customers/walk-ins to take home their tartes at $4 a piece.

Sitting in a little window booth by the front door has its advantages.  You get to see the staff greet each customer.  And because most of the customers are regulars...they're all greeted with kisses on the cheeks.  This was our first time here so we didn't get any kisses.\n\nWhat was wierd was that every other party had someone with extremely white...or no hair at their table.  I know that Laguna Hospital nursing home is across the street...but I don't think they let their residents out?  We were by far the youngest (mid-30s).  But enough on the irrelevant stuff.\n\nWe were told the menu changes every 2-4 weeks.  So what we describe may not be available when you go.  Make sure to check their website.\n\nWe started with mussels in a creamy broth.  It was accomapnied by a side of french fries.  The mussels were fresh and cooked to perfection.  The only place where I've had better mussels is at Plouf.  But what left me bedazzled was that they called them french fries.  Isn't it supposed to be Pomme Frites?\n\nFor entrees...we both got the \"You and Me Forever\"...aka rack of lamb with truffles and veges.  Do you remember the move Ratatouille?  When the critic Anton Ego put that first and every bite of the ratatouille in his mouth...it brought back all the rememberable moments in his life.  This was sort of the same experience I had.  Each bite was full of flavor.  Each bite was like a whole new experience.  I couldn't stop eating!\n\nCome dessert time...I was still at awe over my meal.  So instead of something sweet...I ordered another appetizer for dessert.  I had a mushroom tart.  The waiter gave me a look as to say \"really?\"  But I have no reservations about that decision and I enjoyed every bite of it.\n\nNeedless to say...I plan to be back.  And since I won't be a newbie here next time...maybe we'll get kisses on the cheeks.", "author": "Clayton N."}

He came up to us and talked about the food, and the future menu, without being intrusive or inappropriate at all. And my water glass was never empty for very long, either--he was very much on it!\n\nThen, the food was amazing. My steak was absolutely incredible, and the green beans were great in the sauce. The french fries were quite a surprise too--I've never had fries that tasted so naturally wonderful without having to put anything on them or dip them in anything.\n\nThen finally, we had a lovely chocolate pear tart for dessert, which even though we ordered around 11:30pm and the owner was the last person there besides us, he insisted that he was thrilled to serve it to us.\n\nOverall, it was an absolutely lovely experience, with a charming wait staff and truly great food, and very reasonably priced for the quality, on top of that!", "author": "Max K."}

The Yelp reviews were so great and I was so excited to find a new restaurant in a new neighborhood.  I think I had too high of expectations and set myself up to be disappointed.\n\nFirst off, I made a mistake in not reading the reviews closely enough to know that this is NOT a romantic restaurant.  It's a very loud and bustling bistro atmosphere and it is best enjoyed with a group rather than on a date.\n\nThey have a nice wine list, and a very good selection of half-bottles, which is more rare than it should be.  \n\nThe tuna tartare appetizer was very good, but very small.  Only a couple bites and the tuna's gone.  The trout entree was good, but salty and not a whole lot of flavor.  The lamb shanks with polenta was amazingly tasty.  The meat fell of the bone and melted in the mouth.  But, as lamb shanks are wont to do, it became much too heavy to finish.    \n\nThe service was mixed.  On the one hand, the manager was very friendly and stopped by a couple times. On the other hand, the waiter was too busy flirting with the girls at the next table to pay much attention to us.  The wine pours came as he fluttered by our table on his way to his love next door, with the wine dribbling down the glass and across the table with the rushed pour.\n\nOh, and they have a parking lot.  Not that you really need it in this neighborhood, but, wow, I don't know that I've ever eaten at a restaurant with a parking lot in SF.\n\nOverall, the food was good but I didn't feel like I got my money's worth.  There are better neighborhood French places (my favorite is Cote Sud).\n\nUPDATE: The manager sent me an e-mail the day after I posted this.

I had the duck with raisin fig sauce, and if I were home alone, I would have licked the plate!!!  \nA couple came in just for dessert, and I can see why!  The floating island was a mergue anglaise, and the strawberry bruschetta was divine!  \nI give this place 5 stars for incredibly tasty French Bistro style food, and 5 stars potential great romantic \"let's just go have a little dessert at a cute quiet place\".  \nI need to remember this place when Valentine's Day rolls around!  \nLove the ambiance, love that it's a bit unknown so go check it out before the secret gets out, and reservations are tough to get!!!", "author": "louis a."}

Unfortunately, when ours came, it was very gamy, and just overall disappointing.  The tart tatin and onion soup were both just ok.  My pork tenderloin was a little dry.\n\nThe meal ended well though, with the pear tart being the star of the evening.\n\nOverall, not a bad meal, but there other places in the city to enjoy more.", "author": "Brian C."}

Came here on a Tuesday night for the 1,000 points on Opentable.  Upon entering, you'll notice the brightly colored walls along the many tables.  There were 3 other tables occupied, and we opted for a table closer towards the inside and farther from the rest of the tables.  The tables are pretty close in proximity to each other, so I can see how it would dampen the mood when it's packed... you might as well join the neighboring table in their conversation. \n\nSadly, we were informed that they did not have the steak tartare nor the beef cassoulettes that night =(  Two of the things I wanted to try!  Luckily, there were plenty of other enticing options.  We started with the french onion soup and the homemade foie gras.  The french onion soup came in a small iron pot-like container with a nicely baked layer of cheese (YuMM I LOVE cheese).  It tasted sweet, a little too sweet for me, but it was still good.  The foie gras was something else... I've never had it like this.  It seemed like they had pureed it, and made it into a loaf with a sweet layer of apricots?? not sure what it was, but it was delicious!  Definitely different than the other foie gras I had.  It comes out cold with some dates that pair nicely with it.  For the entrees, we got the Ocean trilogy, which came with threee small portions of different types of fish, and the Filet Mignon.  The fish entree came with nice white creamy sauces, which were different in each one.  Delicious!  The filet was also very tasty, and came with potato au gratin.  For dessert, we got the mandarin orange chocolate tart. Like everything else, it was delicious!... so chocolatey!\n\nOverall, very good service, and great food.", "author": "Diane L."}

We had been really looking forward to this meal since we rarely go out to dinner anymore now that we have two small children, so this was supposed to be a big deal.\n\nEverything started off well enough with the mussels that everyone here has raved about.  These were good, but we've had much better elsewhere (such as at L'Petit Laurent).\n\nThe entrees were regrettable.  The duck confit was so dry and hard that it was literally impossible to cut with a steak knife.  The potatoes were really good, however, and the sauce was fine .  The poussin dish was also fair, though only one out of four shellfish was edible.  (Two were completely closed, and the third was MIA.)  \n\nDessert was on the house due to the aforementioned poussin issue, but we didn't bother to mention the duck since we already knew we wouldn't be going back and we were trying to be laidback about the whole evening.\n\nWe overheard that the owner/chef has recently hired people to \"help\" in the kitchen.

Yum. I was on a mission to eat foie gras at every place that had it because they are banning foie gras in SF soon!! It's not the best I've ever had, but it was good.\n\nEscargots \"a la Bourguignone\": Snails with roasted garlic, shallots, butter, red wine Parsley $9 : They served it in a bone (The thing that bone marrow comes in, yannoe)! Creative and fun (you get to dig the little escargots out of the bone like a game!). But don't be mistaken, there was no bone marrow inside. I've only had escargot twice, the first time they were giant black blobs soaked in butter, this had petite little escargots that were flavored and seasoned wonderfully. We loved it!\n\nSteamed Mussels Marinieres: With shallots, garlic, parsley, cream and white wine, Appetizer Or Entree size: $ 8.00 or $ 14.00: The mussels were huge, delicious, and juicy. Make sure you use the bread to soak up the sauce!\n\nSea Bass: It's not on their online menu! Just looked. It was a little dry, sort of wish I skipped it, but it wasn't horrible. I guess it's a good thing it's not on their menu?\n\nChocolate Pear Tart: I think since they saw that we barely picked at the sea bass, they knew we didn't care for it that much, the tart was on the house! The owners/waiters of this place really went above and beyond on service. This was a gigantic piece! It's literally 1/4th of a whole pie!

The evening started with a appetizer salad with a piece of foie gras, sliced duck, pine nuts in a subtle truffle oil and citrus vinaigrette.  We ordered the Duck Leg Confit, which was served With Sauted potatoes, the sauce was truffle based as well, the taste was simple, yet refined, the depth of flavors highlighted the fatty goodness in the duck, its crisp skin, who whole dish just worked...  We also ordered the chicken breast served over a bed of gnocchi and wild mushrooms in a butter shallot sauce.  I didn't think of this at the time of ordering, but would normally be a little afraid to order a dumpling that would traditionally be considered Italian, but still, for some reason, I had a good feeling and have a weakness for those little orbs of heaven....\n\nI am glad I followed my gut, the gnocchi (I think they were the potato type) had that bite that I love, it wasn't over cooked, they had a slight crust to them when they were cooked in that butter sauce, which had a nutty and savory aroma.  The chicken breast was a pretty nice size, and it was cooked with a nice outer crust with a much more robust flavor that complemented the sauce it was served on.  The chicken was perfectly moist, even to the edges on the breast!  We each had a glass of wine, I am not the wine connoisseur, but fortunately our waiter was and selected a glass for each of us which would be appropriate for the meal.  For dessert, the two of us were told that their tarts are fantastic, and was I blown away.  We had the Chocolate Pear tart, but it was very hard to decide upon with the triple chocolate, apricot, & berry.  (I have to come back, the tart alone was worth the trip.)  It came in with a small drizzle of raspberry sauce and fresh cream, you really didn't need any of it, the chocolate was rich, dense and decadent, a hint of pear provided a nice acidic break in the flavor.    The tart's crust was also chocolate, but was still had a crisp bite and had a slight buttery/bitterness to it, I was blown away by it.  \n\nParking was a breeze for us, we got lucky and got a spot right out front.  The staff was extremely warm and friendly, and checking in on us to make sure everything was to our liking.  The first thing you may notice is that the place is small and narrow, but because they decided to keep the center open, they knew the customer would feel much more comfortable and not so claustrophobic for the sake of making more money when the restaurant fills up.  I did notice a narrow upstairs section, Im not sure if it's for looks, but that could be a fun spot to eat if it isn't....  I'll definitely be back soon!", "author": "Chris T."}

Escargot: My first try at these slimers.  Um... buttery and quite carmalized.\nEntrees - Pan seared rainbow trout: An entire deboned fish served on a bed of orzo and vegies.  The filet was moist and flakey.  The orzo was a buttery and the lemoney sauce rounded out the dish well.  Rather refreshing!\nDuck Leg Confit: So happy this was my plate.  I am a huge fan of opposing textures in food so the crispy skin with the juicy, oily meat was great.  The potatoes with truffle oil almost stole the show.  That truffle oil was fragrant and should be a permanent part of my pantry now.  \nThe Cassolette:  A sort of amalgamation of different meats stewed with white beans.  I think it was rather salty.  I didn't try the sausages, but it looked to be a unique dish.\n\nI cant believe this place isn't in the middle of the theater district or in a trendy neighborhood!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-01-26", "description": "This review is actually for 21/2 stars but Yelp only believes in  integers....\n\nI have driven by this place plenty of times and have heard great things about it. Since Chapeau was fully booked for an appropriate dinner time, it was my Mom's 70th Birthday, and my dad always complains about the distance of the restaurant to the house, I chose this place. \n\nAs soon as we walked through the door, the owner or executive chef greets you in French and shakes your hand individually. I was thinking \"Wow!!! How neat was that!!!\" Since we were a bit early for our reservation, our table was not ready and this was obvious because it was a packed house and a small one at that. He told us to have some drinks at the bar (a very puny bar) while we wait for our table. The bartender was quite cordial. My brother ordered a Kronenberg beer which wasn't bad. I had a Mango Lemon Drop, which was very tasty and inventive. Actually, they use Soju Vodka and pure mango puree. Yummy. We ordered my mom a glass of expensive champagne which was very smooth and fruity. It doesn't burn your throat and isn't so bubbly that the air runs through your nose. I don't remember the name, but it is $13.00.\n\nOur table was ready by 7pm, the time of our reservation. We were escorted to our table and they pulled out the chairs as best as they could (it is cramped in here so they actually have to pull out tables for you to pass, I have never been to France, but is this how it usually is?). From here is where it all goes awry. \n\nFirst of all, there weren't enough place settings and we had to request some... maybe a simple mistake so it might be excusable. I can't remember the order of things from here, but I'll try my best. The waiter takes our orders after we have been sifting through teh menu for about 15 minutes. I decided not to go with the specialites of the restaurant (The Clay Pots and the mussels). I ordered the lobster ravioli appetizer, duck confit and a side of pomme frites. I requested a wine that goes well with the duck and the waiter was nice enough to oblige and just take care of it. My dad ordered the mussels, my mom orderd the french onion soup to cure her laryngitis and the grilled salmon, and my brother order the rainbow trout, a side of sauteed garlic spinach, and a 1/2 bottle of wine to pair with the trout. Okay so it seems all good as we are starving and completely inhale the french bread and butter (all served cold). I do love the butter. I haven't had real butter like in ..... NEVER. \n\nHowever, we had to repeatedly ask the bread to be filled. It was not done automatically thourghout the night. The waiter served the wine immediately. My brother's 55 dollar wine was damn tasty (it had mango aromas and flavors... again quite yummy). My red wine was perfect. Not too strong, smooth, and didn't burn. However it took a half hour for our appetizers to be served. By this time we had already gone through at least 3 1/2 loaves of bread. My dad started devouring the pomme frites to quell his hunger until the entree. The lobster ravioli only came with 3 and there was 4 of us. It wasn't good though. It needed a better sauce and the salt could have been cut in half. My mom didn't comment on the French Onion soup. Other than my mom, who is a slow eater, we were done in 5 minutes. \n\nOnce they cleared hour plates it seemed like an eternity before our meal arrived (actually another 30 minutes or so). My dad was already complaining, we had finished another (3) 1/2 loaves of bread, and my brother and I had almostly completely wiped out our entree-complimenting wine. We all instantly dug into our food which was the following:\n\nPositives:\n1) Mussel sauce/broth was good. Not too buttery and not too salty.\n2) Rainbow trout was a whole fish.\n\nNegatives:\n1) Both fish and duck dishes were extremely salty.\n2) Both the mussels and the duck were overcooked.\n3) The grilled salmon portion was so small that the frozen packaged ones from Cosco are double the size of what my mom ate.\n4) The spinach tasted like spinach...sans the garlic.\n5) We all devoured our food and were still left so hungry that we were ASKING for more bread. \n\nDessert came pretty quickly. Even though we had a scrumptious cake waiting at home, we still ordered one tart b/c it is supposedly one of their specialties. They didn't even have the one we wanted (Chocolate/Almond) so we had the triple chocolate. I thought it was very good b/c it wasn't too sweet and it came with some whip cream, but my mother wasn't very pleased. I also ordered a cup of coffee which was completely regrettable and forgetable. My brother ordered the Mango Lemon Drop for himself which wsa quite strong in comparison to the one I had earlier. \n\nThe ambiance was good, but it was a bit on the noisy side. The staff is friendly as well. The best advice is the following: Don't come on a weekend or busy night. Otherwise dinner is 3 hrs. long and the food isn't cooked well. And stick with the specialties.", "author": "Lorna D."}

If you haven't tried cassoulet before and decide to order it here for the first time perhaps you'll walk away thinking it was a creative rendition of pork and beans.  The desserts which the Spanish waiter bragged about all night wasn't even worth the calories.  Go to Cafe Claude instead.", "author": "Amber L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-01-28", "description": "One night, the BF and I were waiting at the Forest Hill Station for the 43 Masonic to show up to take us home.  While we were waiting, an acquaintance and his GF showed up, all spiffy and looking energized.  They recognized us, hailed us, and said they were walking just around the corner to dine at Chou Chou, the cute little French patisserie/bistro that we had seen plenty of times from the windows of our bus.  \n\n\"You gotta try it!\" they said, and after we bid our goodbyes, they sailed out the station, around the corner, looking forward to their lovely French meal.   \n\n\"It does look romantic,\" I said to the BF, when the bus finally came and we watched the restaurant as we passed it by.  It looked charming, homey, bright, and was full of people.\n\n\"Let's try it one night,\" the BF suggested.  \"After work.  It will make coming to the Forest Hill station a little more pleasant.\"\n\nSo we did, last Friday night.  We really really wanted to like it!\n\nBut we didn't.  We just won't be going back.  We'd go to Chow instead and have way better service, much better atmosphere, and most importantly, much more awesome food.  Our criteria was a neighborhood gem that wasn't overpriced for the food, and could be that comforting place you go to with your friend to get consistently yummy food and friendly service.  Chou Chou isn't going to be that on our list, and we're a little sad about it, because it IS just on the way home!!\n\nHere's the why:  the tables are way too crammed together.  You can't help but hear the obnoxious conversation of the older man sitting next to you bragging to his trophy date that he is a \"v.i.p.\" there and then sniping about his salad and then his wine.  And then the waiter, who is alternately friendly and then frigid (!) keeps *bumping* into me while reaching to serve others who sit on the banquette side of the table.  Then the bread comes, and it is delicious with butter, and I wonder if they bake the bread there.  Salads are fine, nothing to rave about.   The BF's choice of steak and frites is smart, b/c the steak and frites are done very well, but overpriced at $21.00.  My choice of one of the Chef's Specialities is the Chicken Grand Mere, which is admittedly beautifully presented (the waiter cuts out the top of the pastry lid and reveals a drumstick and some part of a thigh simmered in a wild mushroom sauce, with some peas).  However, the sauce isn't very special-- it tastes like something I might whip up for myself quickly for supper after a long day and I don't feel like cooking.  The pastry lid is leathery!  I guess I was looking forward to more of a flaky crust.\n\nWe sip our glass of Cote du Rhone, which are very nice and reasonably priced at $8 a glass.  We look at each other over the table and kind of wish we were having a nicer dinner.  Okay, we were wishing for a fabulous dinner, but still, we had gone into it halfway sold!\n.\nDessert, which usually can rectify most situations--did not.  We ordered the creme brulee, the sugar top was almost burnt (a no no) and then the custard was alternately chunky and then runny on the bottom, warm and then cold.  My BF surmised that it had been made earlier and sat for a long time b/c all the vanilla bean specks had sunk to the bottom.  Sigh.  And I do love creme brulee.\n\nWe had to wait a long time for our check, and in the  meantime listened to some conversation from fellow diners that put me not in the mind of charming French colloquies, but rather smug, post-yuppie comments that made us very happy to leave and wait in the chilly station for the 43 to swing around and take us home.", "author": "Corii L."}

I was the last one to join the group and I think I had been cursed because I had to sit a couple of feet from the goddamn entrance door which was constantly open: people came in or got out but nobody cared to close the door so try to imagine the winds from the North Pole behind you as you eat your dinner and you'll get the idea of how much I enjoyed my dinner. I ordered Mussels Marinieres, Moulard Duck and Vanilla Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e (erroneously spelled Vanilla Cr\u00e8me Brulee on the menu). The mussels were tasty but rather light for my taste. The duck was not bad at all. The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was tasty but it was extremely sweet, so sweet that by the time I got halfway eating it, I was nauseated by it. Overall, dinner was discrete but. What ruined my night out was the door behind me and the people constantly coming in and out. Paying more than $40 and having to go through that was probably not worth. The place is fairly small and tends to get noisy and overcrowded. The waiters are distracted and you really need to make an effort to attract their attention, even when they are taking orders (they speak with other people and turn around, very impolite indeed). In addition, people waiting stay between tables so you have no privacy if you are near the entrance door. If you plan to visit, make sure you get a reservation. Be careful with parking. In the private lot, space is limited.", "author": "X. Y."}

I'd bookmarked ChouChou for awhile now but was wondering whether they serve brunch and they DO! It was 1:30pm and I made a reservations on Opentable for 2:30pm eventhough the hours of operation said 10am to 2:30pm on Sunday. In any case, there was an open slot for 2:30pm so we drove over to Market St, pass Twin Peaks and eventually ended up on Dewey Blvd! Phew, that was a long 25 min drive for brunch. There were ample parking spaces in the adjacent lot. We walked in to find the place empty with only a table of two ladies finishing their lunch/coffee? We walked up to the counter and said Hello to the server and informed her of our 2:30pm reservations. She was stunned and told us that they were closed but we insisted that we have a reservation made online. She went to check with someone else and few seconds later, a nice gentleman returned which we assumed could be the manager or host who warmly welcomed us. We were afraid that lunch items might not available since we are so late but he reassured us that they have everything on their brunch/lunch menu and we can sit wherever we wanted.\nWe sat by the window and chatted and then placed our orders for a Parisienne omelette of gruyere cheese and ham, onion soup and Croque Monsieur. Soup and omelette was tasty however the Croque Monsieur had too much cheese and was lacking the ham but was decent. However, we were starting to run low on water and ketchup and signalled for some attention and the host apologetically returned and filled our water glasses and brough additional ketchup. We also had a wobbly table which the server tried to fix but it was still wobbly. She suggested that we could move to the table next to us but when bf checked the stability of that other table, it was also wobbly. what's up with all these wobbly tables?! We stayed put on our same table. \nOverall a nice late brunch experience but perhaps we have to make it in earlier the next time and also try the tarts. :)", "author": "Yan M."}

There is adjacent parking spaces but it was full when I arrived.  Street parking is quite ample.  By the time I got to the place my friends had been there for quite a while and polished off several rounds of good, crusty French baguettes (from ACME?).  Service was attentive and the waiter didn't seem to mind when we asked for our 5th round of bread.  \nAs for the food:\nHomemade French Onion Soup Gratinee: hot and steamy, covered with melty gruyere/fontina.  Good of the chilly weather.\nSteamed Mussels Marinieres - passable mussels itself with 1-2 tasting not so fresh.  The star is the leftover white wine broth which we sop up with the bread.\nPan Seared Local Veal Chop: tender and not gamy, but lacks overall taste even with the demiglace.  Hedgehogs mushrooms with fingerling potatoes accompanied the dish quite nicely but still needs a little extra flavor.  \nAll Natural Local Duck Confit: skin is crispy, and the meat falls of the bone, but the taste lacks that depth and complexity that I was looking for.  The chorizo, butterbeans and huckleberry gastrique were interesting on their own but did not really bring the dish together.\n\nDAT menu looks fairly depressing, but the dungeness crab salad with watermelon radish was surprisingly good in that the amount of crab offered was large but lemon aioli may had been a little too creamy.  The entrees DAT menu include roast chicken and salmon both of which did not look that exciting.  2 of my friends got the salmon which seemed like nothing to write home about.  Creme brulee was standard, with the sugar topping nicely caramelized.  The table behind us got the banana flambe with tableside service which looked like it would be good for birthdays...\n\nOverall the place looks very homey/comforting with the food quite lackluster.

I kept saying, \"That little french restaurant is always packed, we should try it...\"We decided to take advantage of the Dine About Town dinner which, in itself, is an amazing deal and wonderful way to check out several restaurants while saving your hard earned cash. Take a friend or two and order different items so that you can taste a bit of everything. For 35 bucks you get a three course dinner. I think it is about $18 for lunch at participating restaurants: http://www.onlyinsanfrancisco.com/taste/dineabouttown\n\nFirst Impressions\nWe were greeted at the door by the chef/owner Nick. He shook my husband's hand and gave me a kiss on both cheeks. He seems genuinely happy to see you, and greets you as if you are old friends coming to his home. The staff is lovely, our waitress Aiya (sp) was knowledgeable about the menu and suggested a perfect pairing of wine our dinner. \n\nThe Food\nThe food here is not in a hurry, and you shouldn't be either. Much like a restaurant in Paris, the staff will not rush you to leave, the idea is for you to enjoy the company you are with and have the food compliment the experience, so bring someone you like, order a nice bottle of wine, be prepared to wait, and know that it is worth it.  \n\nFor starters, I had the onion soup and my husband had the frisee salad, the soup was delicious, and the frisee was delightful, the egg on the salad was prepared perfectly and just a nice little bite. Both were just enough to enhance our appetite and prepare us for what was to come. For dinner ordered the filet mignon and my husband ordered the lamb. Both were prepared perfectly and the taste was sublime. My filet came with with butter spinach, polenta-goat cheese mini cake in a shallots-red port sauce. A perfect combination of flavors, not at all overly rich as these sauces can sometimes be. My husband raved about the rack of lamb and loved the fresh Chanterelles and potatoes \"rissol\u00e9es\" and a rosemary-thyme sauce. For dessert, I had a medley of red fruits with ice cream and shaved chocolate, and my husband had the pear tart of the day. Both were just a perfect way to end an amazing and memorable date-night meal.\n\nSurprise\nThe surprise here is that the owner was not originally the chef. Our waitress told us that he bought the restaurant a little over a year ago and the chef quit, so the owner thought he would \"give it a try\". The result is divine. \n\nThe Downside\nThe only \"problem\" with Chouchou is the location....it is on Dewey across from Laguna Honda hospital. Not a problem for me, as it is right down the hill from where I live, and clearly they are not suffering from it, as I said, the place is always packed, and you MUST plan ahead and make a reservation if you plan to come.  If you live outside of the Sunset, take the Metro and get off at Forest Hill station, it is a short walk from there. Make the effort, you will not regret it", "author": "Michele D."}

Dining at this restaurant has left a bitter taste in my mouth, not because of the food allergies that came from it, but because of the way it was dealt with afterwards.  I did not expect anything from Chouchou after the incident.  It was just a bad experience and to share it with the fellow yelpers to take as they may.  However the restaurant's manager, idea of reconciliation was basically to claim that the restaurant was not at fault and that it was solely on non histamine tolerating self.

I love food. My father has a culinary degree and a lifetime of experience in cooking under his belt and from that I think that it is safe to say that he also loves food too. When we arrived we were surprised by the hospitality. We sat right next to the glass refrigerator with their famous desserts. I remember that we first had their onion soup and that hit the spot. Perfect for a chilly day in San Francisco. Next we had their mussels. The mussels were done right and the broth that they bathed in was delicious. Just remembering dipping a slice of the baguette into the broth and tasting the delicious combination together just makes my heart race. The food was not served too early that we did not have enough time to talk, but it did not come so late that we were waiting for it. \n\nHowever as we all know, one good deed does not forgive a series of wrong doings. My last series of visits, each one consisting of me praying for my first glorious experience received from Chou Chou's, failed for a pleasant evening. Each time my food was either under or over cooked and when I compared quality/quantity to our previous bills, the quantity/quality were dropping and the costs kept rising, I'm guessing their local fame allows them to keep this never ending slope. Therefore I have finally decided to stop returning to Chou Chou's, for they have embarked on a dangerous and predictable story. A story that tells of a restaurant with great ideas, succeeding, and growing, unfortunately the owners get greedy. They make the chef's put less care into their dishes because they force them to feed the hundreds of people flowing into their doors. Well then the owners figure that they can get more money by serving less food, so people don't need to spend time as much time eating, and there can be even more customers. However the increase in customers will make the chef's put even less care into their masterpieces and the food will begin to deteriorate in quality. Finally people will start to notice the change in the quality of food and follow my example of not returning. \n\nBut there is a simple remedy to stop this horrid slope is this, take away tables, lower prices put more food on the customers plates. The demand for the seats will rise, Chef's will be able to put more care into their dishes which means higher quality, and more people, will come/return due to the restaurant's higher portions. The restaurant will still receive profit and more people will be able to know the blessed feeling of good food and it's glorious effects of delivering each diner a warm dummy.\n\nWould like to note to any readers that I again am a High school student, so I have had very little time to finish this review. Also The last time I went to Chou Chou's was over four month's ago, so ownership or chef's may have changed, but if they haven't, I hope they read my review.", "author": "Jason D."}

We came on a Wednesday night and there were only a few tables occupied so our waiter gave us a very nice table by the window. My bf and I both had the pre-fixe menu. For starters, he had the zucchini soup while I had the escargots. I'm not a huge snail fan.. in fact I've only had it once before, but I figured I should be adventurous and give it a shot. The snails were baked nicely in garlic and olive oil and tasted a lot like a mussel dish I had recently. I just kept telling myself that I was eating mussels and not snails so I was able to get through the dish. It was good, but I don't think I'll be ordering escargots again. Anyway, for the main dish we both had the lamb casolette. It's a really warm, comforting dish that is very filling. The flavors were right on. My only critique is that I wish the carrots had been cooked a little longer, it was a bit crunchy for my taste.  For dessert, I had the triple chocolate tarte while my bf had the tarte aux pommes (apple tart). My chocolate tarte was very rich, but really delicious. I felt so guilty finishing it because I can only imagine the number of calories that goes into something like that.. oh well. \n\nOverall, I thought the food was very good and the service was great. The manager was nice enough to even give us complimentary glasses of kier royale at the end of our meal. Yum. \nI will definitely check out this place again.", "author": "Andrea G."}

The waiter was attentive and the food was fair.  I was ready to be wow'd after reading the Yelp reviews and have to say,  I've had better food elsewhere.  \n\nThe halibut and seafood dish was good.  The crust on the beef stew  was hard as a rock and could not be consumed.  We ordered dessert and found the tart too soft (kinda like a brownie not baked through).  I would def not recommend it.  \n\nI did notice that the Manager or owner (not sure which?) would stop frequently at most of the tables to check on how dinner was going and then, entirely overlook customers seated at adjacent tables.  It just make it more obvious since it's a very small restaurant with tight seating quarters. What a business faux pas ....thought it was kind of rude not to check on all the tables especially, when he continually returned to the same tables over and over again.  I also found it unusual that he seemed to sample the customers wines at numerous tables as well.\n\nI gave the restaurant three stars for the seafood, halibut & the waiter however, I would not return again.", "author": "c v."}

Falls off the bone, has the most delicious flavor -- like braised for a long time -- savory with the sweetness and tang of cherry tomatoes...mmmmmm!\n\n I had called twice Thurs   to make reservations for 6 that night -- no one answering when they open at 5? \n\n Finally left a message about 4:45 saying PLEASE Call me back to confirm  (messagehad said they would). No one ever called.  I phoned about 6:20, said I'd called -- \"oh yes, we heard your message!\"  (Hunh?  so why didn't you call?)\n\n  Said we'd be there in half an hour. There were  25 people in restaurant.  No one at the door.  One woman at the tables and finally saw one busboy.  She handled ALL the tables ALONE al night.  very nice pretty French woman, don't know how she did it.  Didn'dt even seem that frazzled.  We were talking, so I didn't mind the service being a bit slow (I prefer that to being rushed).  I ordered off prix fixe menu (3 courses, $36)  Salad was good, duck was FABULOUS,  My friend ordered off regular menu -- his brussels sprouts were great -- onion, bacon, etc.  Not full sprouts or even halves and presentation was not attractive but  they were delicious. \n\nhad ordered the pear chocolate dessert when I placed my dinner order.  When she came back to ask about dessert, I reminded her.  sorry, none left.  But -- I ordered it...?  Oh well...she came back with a plate of 3 pieces of chocolate torte. I love chocolate but they were all very dry and not very interesting.  We each had a glass of wine.  Bill was $101 for the two of us.  Still like the place...my friend thought I was unfair when I said that standing at the door for 4 minutes with no one even noticing is NOT good -- but I'm right.  Last week, the owner was there and he was quite charming and fun.  Definitely go for the duck and brussels sprouts!  Also, it's a quiet little out-of-the-way spot.  I was just with a platonic friend but -- would be a great spot if you needed some place \"discreet.\"  Despite the shortcomings, I'm still a fan.  I'd go back a third time -- even this week -- for that duck\n\nDon't know if someone didn't show up last night or what -- not calling back for reseravations and the one woman suggests that.  Everyone has \"off\" nights -- but it sounds from the reviews that if he would just put that much more effort into smoothing things out, he could really raised the place to another level.", "author": "L M."}

We had 7pm reservations for a Thursday night.  We were a tiny bit late, but still had to wait for our table.  Well, I was a tiny bit late.  Pam might have been there on time since she got there before me, but she was still waiting inside the door when I got there.  It was really packed inside, but it's a small restaurant.  When it was finally time for us to be seated, we were led all the way to the back, up a set of stairs, through a kitchen-like area, through a curtain, and out on the balcony where there were four tables of 2 set up along the walls.  It's nice and I can see how it would be very romantic, but the whole walking through the kitchen thing was a bit weird.  And the light on the table was an old desk lamp, which was also weird.  Aside from that, even though we were up in the balcony, our server was very attentive and stopped by frequently.  The chef/owner stopped by a few times.  The first time to give me a hug and the cheek kisses.  I'm not big on PDAs and especially not with people I don't know, so I could probably pass on that in the future.  But he stopped by very often to check in on us as well.\n\nFOOD:  LOVED the Goat Cheese Tart.  I'd probably go back just to have that.  It was really yummy.  I also had the Niman Ranch Top Sirloin Steak.  I asked for medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  For dessert, I asked for the Mixed Fruit Tart since that was what the server recommended.  However, she came back very apologetic and said they were all out and instead gave me an extra big slice of the Pear Tart.  Super YUM!  \n\nSo, very cute restaurant.

We tried the mussels, the vegetarian ravioli and the salmon. The flavors were subtle and exquisitely blended. It rivaled meals I've had at Boulevard and Aqua at a fraction of the price. While Chouchou is definitely not a \"kid\" place, if you have well mannered foodie kids, this is a great place to bring them. My 10-year old loved the salmon with mushrooms and our waiter graciously arranged a half order of the ravioli sans vegetables for our 6-year old. (There is no kids menu.) \n\nWe recently went back a second time and I just had to upgrade my review from 4 to 5 stars.  This place really is as good as it gets.  The pan seared sole was devine and any place that has my 6-year old asking for seconds on brussel sprouts - well that says it all. ... Not to mention that we can actually afford to take our kids with us when we eat here.", "author": "Dawn S."}

And perhaps also orgasmic. But I steered more toward wonderful since I was having dinner with my mom. It is a diamond in the rough. With the rough being our economy right now and the diamond being something that has great atmosphere, warm service and suprisingly wonderful food at such a great value. \n\nWhen you walk in, you instantly feel welcome not only by the staff but also by the soft warm colors and spring pastels. Beautifully hand blown lights reach down to each table offereing another dimension of color as well. A few round tables fit snug around the front of the restaurant and brown banquettes line the back of the restaurant with the middle left open to give it a very welcome airy space not found in many smaller restaurants. \n\nWe started with a French Onion soup that was off the charts. Smaller cup size offered pieces of bread flowing out of the base, not unlike Mozza ball and bubbling Swiss cheese scented the palette. Then we had the mussles with fries which was done with standard grace. I had a dish soon to be taken off the menu called Ouef \"cocette\". A great appetizer I would imagine eating in a Marseille brasserie. Soft baked/poached eggs with bacon lardons in truffled cream sauce finished with frisee salad. I was starting to make the O face. No dont do it. For mains, we had the seafood Cassolet which was a wonderful version of french shellfish potpie. A little bit salty but a very welcome aspect that wasnt touched upon on the meal yet. And I had the organic pork with mashed taters. A simple dish taken to the next level with what seemed to be sauce of corn, tomatoes and fig with the classic French wine reduction. Wonderful.\n\nOf course the service and timing were excellent as well as the wine list and 'Soju' inspired cocktail menu. A very creative and welcome key to San Francisco dining. Much like this restaurant. Wonderful.", "author": "K K."}

We went for Dine About Town....\n\nService-Definitely the best part of the dining experience. Even though they lost our reservation, we were seated promptly. While we waited we were each given a complimentary glass of champagne. :) The waiter also carried my heavy bag to the table. The exceptional service continued throughout the meal. Great timing, made great recommendations and again another complimentary glass of sangiovese for our steaks. I noticed that people arriving were often being hugged by the head chef-who greeted everyone and all the tables, and initially I thought They must come a lot, but upon leaving we also received hugs! He even gave one of tablemates a kiss on the cheek after  a compliment was given to the steak! Very intimate, felt very family owned (which I heard they are)  and friendly. Superb service-that alone would send me back. \n\nAmbiance/Atmosphere-Very small, everyone was packed in tight but the restaurant itself was packed too and remained busy even after we left around 9. Obviously doing well. There was a guitar duo playing from the upstairs and I don't know how often they play, but it only added to the nice atmosphere.  Everyone who worked there spoke French and had thick accents-only made me like it more knowing it's owned by a french-speaking family. \n\nFood-Very yummy! We tried the warm goat cheese tart-I don't normally like tomatoes but the whole thing was very good, even with them. The french onion soup was also tried and it was delicious too. We all had the rib eye steak- I wavered between that, the mussels and the souffle but the waiter recommended the steak without any hesitation and since it's dine about town why not get the steak?! It was excellent, very tender and the jus was great. It came with the best au gratin potatoes I've ever had and green beans. I don't normally like green beans but they had such a good flavor that I nibbled a few. For dessert, I had the triple chocolate tart (recommended of all the tarts)-very good, any chocoholic like myself would agree. My dinner partners had the floating island (and loved it) and the strawberry bruschetta-both of which were not offered by dine about town but were accomodated within the set price range.  \n\nDEFINITELY would go back again. Food, ambiance and service were all absolutely outstanding. Even without the 2 complimentary glasses, it was such an intimate and delicious dining experience, it only makes sense that they were so busy! Oh, and Thursdays is free corkage!!", "author": "Kelly T."}

I had the duck confit and found it to be perfectly prepared.  My boyfriend had the pork dish, which was in a delicious mustard sauce and, secretly, I coveted his meal.\nHowever, we stood at the door for over 10 minutes waiting for the host to acknowledge our presence, despite the fact that he made eye contact with us many times.  Once we were seated, service was good and fairly attentive.  And, although this is not the fault of the restaurant, I was distracted by the obnoxious yuppy seated next to us who loudly announced the price of his ridiculously overpriced (and ugly) shirt multiple times, as well as how much money he makes and the homes he plans to buy.  Then, making eye contact with me as I glanced at him (i couldn't help it-he was so loud!), he threatened to kick my ass if I didn't look away!

I will give a five star review for their Bastille Day menu, a menu and celebratory ambiance well worth the visit.  \n\nThe space is fairly modest, tucked on the corner of Dewey and Laguna Honda.  Noise levels are moderate to high, their upstairs seating is cozy and intimate which we had the pleasure of being seated yesterday.  Kudos to the friendly staff, they'll make you feel quite comfortable.\n\nSo Bastille Day came complete with hay covering the floors, balloons, and costumed staff presenting peasantry to royalty, with nice live music.  And the food was great.  \n\nTheir five course prix fix started with a foie gras and goat cheese 'mouth amuser'.  Nice.  The goat cheese coulais with mixed fruit was awesome.  We tried their porcini caviar tart and tartar trilogy with ahi, salmon, and halibut complete with complementary sauces.  Kudos to the tart, a wonderful pastry-like combination of mushroom and cheese.  Entrees we shared were the sea and ocean trilogy and duck in bacon.  Three wonderful sauces to complement the salmon, sea bass, and scallop; plum and zucchini respectively.  The bacon brought out flavors well on the duck with calvados sauce.\n\nWe chose the chocolat fondant and brandy marscapone for dessert.  Cherries and marscapone, can't beat cherries and marscapone.  Okay, the chocolate fondant was killer too.\n\nNicely done, and thanks for a wonderful dinner.

Duck and Lamb were dry and some of the condiments were burnt. Scallop was so so and the halibut was actually the better one of the three.

I ordered the duck which I thought was well prepared, however, I did not care too much for the flavors.  But I could tell that it was carefully crafted so I appreciated that.  My date had the lamb cassoulet and that was pretty unique.  The flavors were complex but again, I could tell that a lot of care was put in to it as we mopped up all the sauce with the extra bread.  But the kicker was truly the chocolate/pear tart as recommended by other Yelpers.  It was a perfect balance between the richness of the chocolate and the sweetness of the pear.  This was not specifically listed on the menu so you might have to ask for it.  As we left, we had a conversation with the owner who is definitely passionate about his restaurant and his work.

I felt that the choices were too limited to local selections.  If you've read any of my reviews you know that I like French onion soup (regardless of where it's being served) and it's great at Chouchou.  The escargot was also enjoyable.  Main courses were also quite good with the pear tart creating a very nice finish.", "author": "Ryan P."}

I had the mussels as an appetizer - yummy broth with not too much garlic.  The lamb cassoulet is amazing and the pastry \"lid\" is carved for you tableside.  Great wine list and very good service.  You even get a hug from the owner when you arrive and just before you depart.  There is no shortage of French bistro fare in the Bay Area, and Chouchou is a standout.

Bay Area. He called it \"Chow Chow\".\n\nWe were seated immediately and given a moment to look over the menu and wine list. I decided on the pork tenderloin and a glass of pinot noir and the BF went for the new york steak with frites. I realized the depth of the \"Frenchness\" of this restaurant when this exchange happened:\n\nWaiter: How would you like your steak cooked?\nBF: medium\nWaiter: Medium rare?\nBF: uuuhhh\nWaiter: The chef recommends it medium rare.\nBF: uuuhhhh ok\n\nWhy even bother asking how you'd like your steak cooked if they're gonna tell you how it SHOULD be cooked?\nHe then suggested that we get the butter lettuce salad to share since the entrees would take a while to cook. I was kind of turned off by his pushiness and I know we could have just declined but we gave in. We were then presented with 2 salads and I was worried that we would get charged for both when we only asked for 1 but we ate them anyway. I'm normally not a fan of wedge salads but this one was pretty good. Their vinaigrette is really tasty.\nA few minutes later the head waiter arrived with our dishes, steak and frites for the BF and duck confit for me. Wait a minute, I ordered the pork! This is when the dinner really turned around. He apologized profusely and brought me a glass of rose champagne. Since it would take another 10 min to get my entree he also brought me a frisee salad so I wouldn't just have to watch the BF eat. When the pork came out it was totally worth the wait, tender and juicy and soo delicious.\nThe BF was thoroughly enjoying his steak also and it  was cooked perfectly medium rare.\nThey also refilled my glass of pinot noir. I felt bad because I couldn't even finish all the wine they gave me!\nFor dessert we had tarts, he the plain chocolate and me the pear. They were out of the chocolate pear and the chocolate mandarin. The plain chocolate was sooooooo goood!\n\nI would give this place 5 stars based on the food, atmosphere and proximity to my house but since I was turned off by the pushiness of the waiter at the beginning of our meal, I'll knock it down to 4, for now.", "author": "Melanie V."}

Through the magic of Opentable.com we got a reservation for Chou Chou at about 5 PM on NYE.  We always drive by it and were curious from the get go by it's inviting looks.  \n...After drinking about half a bottle of wine before dinner, we were already both 'happy-pants' upon sitting down.  On one side was a table of about 10 scantily clad gay guys who kept us entertained all night.  On the other sat a couple, who from eavesdropping we could only guess were just plain bitter about not having significant others/dates.  So bitter in fact that they gave us the stink eye all night, and believe me, we are not particulary PDE-types, so we were giving them anything to talk about.  Anyway, the NYE menu was pre-fixe and delish.  I'd love to do it again this year...\n    Our next visit was my birfday.  The food was again great.  One of our servers was so French that he couldn't understand us, was very ssllooowwww, and slightly rude.  Hey, it's good for the authentic feel of the place.  However, another server, the same one we had for New Year's, and, who is a look-alike for Clarissa Explains It All, saved us.  She just plain rocks.  \n    We also visited for bruch on Father's Day.  The coffee was so good I way overdosed on it, consequently I talked about 1000 words a minute for a few hours post-meal.  \n    The food and the atmospshere make Chou Chou a shoe-in for one of my top places to eat in out great city.", "author": "Jeffrey F."}

The Maitre d, Tyler, who I believe was the owner, was very accommodating. We were running late and needed to move our reservation an hour back and he did it with no problem. When we arrived, Tyler informed us in his French accent that there would be a bit of a wait and was nice enough to surprise all 7 of us with complimentary glasses of rose champagne. Because the place is small, there wasn't a bar to hang out at while we waited, so we just stood around in front of the entrance sipping our free wine. It was a little awkward b/c we were literally standing 3 feet away from all the guests who were actually dining. We waited so long that all of us finished our free wine, and Tyler, as smooth as he was, ended up surprising us with a 2nd round of complimentary champagne. That was nice of him, but I was starving and anxious to try the food, so I was growing a little impatient. I was starting to think maybe we did him a favor by moving our reservation back an hour. Haha!\n\nAnyhow, when we were finally seated, everything was fine. The service was great. I chowed down on the bread b/c I was so hungry, which btw, was nothing special. Most of us ordered from the DAT menu, myself included. My appetizer was Sauted Escargot \"a la Bourguignonne\" Vol au Vent (snails with roasted garlic, shallots, butter, parsley and puff pastry). The escargot had a zesty lemon flavor that was pretty strong, but I liked it. But then again, I love anything with tons of lemon, garlic, and butter. The puff pastry that was served with the escargot was a nice compliment. It kind of helped to soften the strong lemon flavor. My entre was the Pork Chop (marinated pork chop served with ragout of lentils, sauted vegetables, pork sauce). I didn't like my entre. The pork chop was dry and not well marinated. I had some of my friend's seared tuna and felt that it lacked flavor and freshness, but it was still better than my pork chop. One of my friends ordered mussels and I tried one, which was delicious. If I ever go back to Chou Chou, I'm ordering the mussels. For dessert I had the crme brulee, which was soft and light, but the glaze on top of my crme brulee was a bit over torched b/c it was kind of bitter. \n\nOverall, I liked the dark ambiance of the place, the great service, Tyler, the zesty escargot, and the juicy mussels. For that, I think it deserves 3.75 stars, but unfortunately Yelp doesn't offer partial star ratings. And I like Tyler too much to give it 3 stars, so 4 stars it is. =)", "author": "Linda N."}

I almost always get duck confit when I do French food and theirs was no disappointment.  Well cooked and tasty.  The reason I waivered between 3 & 4 stars was more about the setting & service.  The restaurant is a bit larger then it looks from the outside but they have it absolutely jam packed with tables.  It was such a tight squeeze between tables that we had to actually pull the table out in order for two of us to get in to the chairs along the wall (otherwise our butts would be in our neighbor's food as we scooted by their table).  Even just taking one or two tables out would make a huge difference.  When it was time to order, our server suggested that we order our entrees at the same time as our appetizers as their kitchen was really backed up.  We had a few questions for him about dishes and his reply was, \"I don't know, I was off for a few days and this is my first day back.  I'll have to check with the kitchen.\"  Shouldn't he have gone over the menu with the kitchen BEFORE he started out on the floor that evening?  While we were eating, the table next to us ordered the Crepe Suzette which the server made at the table.  Later, the next table over ordered it and the host prepared it.  I overheard our server tell his table, \"we all make it differently here ... \"  Shouldn't the menu be created by the head chef?!  How can they get any consistency if everyone is making it their own way?  It was a small thing but I thought a bit unprofessional.  So, food - very good.

At 7pm I still couldn't get this little french restaurant out of my mind, so I decided to return to the city and have dinner there. Was I in for a treat... \n\nFirst off, all of the raving about the staff is true. The chef, Nick Ronan is every bit (if not more) personable and affectionate in person as people say. He welcomes everyone into his restaurant with open arms and a huge smile. The servers are very warm and conscientious as well. \n\nI ended up ordering a multitude of courses, each paired with a different wine. I had only started eating foie gras a month prior, and was still unsure how I felt about it. After devouring a large portion of the lightest and most buttery foie gras, I saw what the fuss was all about. I went on to have several more courses that were all delicious. \n\nThis is not fancy, over-the-top french cuisine. This is more like french bistro/french provincial in style.

Putting bread on soup makes bread soggy.\nThen we got the goat cheese/tomato/onion[shallot?] tart topped with pancetta. The crust was pretty tough.

I had really been looking forward to dinner at Chouchou, having reserved a table for 2, 3 weeks prior. Upon my punctual arrival the French-seeming host (owner?) greeted me nonchalantly and proceeded to scan the computer for my reservation, which they clearly had not held. He then asked me (9 months pregnant, BTW) if upstairs would be \"okay.\" I doubtfully agreed, and was lead up a narrow and steep staircase, which lead to a tiny, stuffy eating area, with barely enough room for the table and chairs. I politely told the host that I preferred downstairs after all, to which he huffily replied \"That's why I asked you in the first place!\" Excuse me, this is my first time here, mister, how was I meant to know your upstairs was actually a glorified attic space? He then lead me downstairs and told me to wait at the bar for a tiny table in the corner, where the diners were nowhere close to being finished. My husband arrived, and we waited for ten minutes, without being offered a drink. I observed many people waiting for food, and not being waited on, along with rickety tables and an overall awkward atmosphere. We got up to leave, and the host did not even care - thanks, but no thanks - we ended up at Pasion on Irving, and had a great night.", "author": "Katherine G."}

Since my friend who decided on the place lived in the SOMA, I was thinking that this was a new hotspot in the neighborhood.  Close. Walking distance.  But then when I found out the restaurant was actually out by Laguna Honda in Forest Hill (and had been there for over 5 years at that), I was like \"Great.  Long drive. (OK, only 7 minute drive, but still)\"  But after dining at Chouchou, I have to say that it was definitely worth the trip.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were immediately greeted by Chef Nick, a super amicable frenchman who immediately shook my hand.  It took a little time for us to be seated (6 of us), since the place was packed (but in my mind, this was a great thing, since it was a Sunday night and a packed restaurant is usually a good sign).  \n\nFor the appetizer, I had the mussels with the side of french fries.  Awesome appetizer.  Mussels were plump and fresh and the broth was buttery and full of flavor.  Plus the bread they served on the side was perfect for dipping in the broth.  So good!\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the coq au vin (chicken marinated in red wine).   This dish was fantastic.  The chicken was roasted perfectly with a tasty and rich red wine sauce that covered the carrots and potatoes on the side.   The flavors were intense, full of so much flavor.\n\nFor dessert, after staring at the dessert menu indecisively, Chef Nick took over and hooked us all up with a sampler of all of his homemade tarts, which were awesome.  The tarts were not overly sweet,but still chock full of flavor, which was a great thing, considering how rich the prior dishes were.  Great way to end the meal.\n\nWhen we left, Chef made sure to give each of us a hug and handshake, which was pretty cool.  That is what I like about these smaller restaurants. The owners/chefs make a real attempt at making sure you have a great experience and this place was no different.  Chef Nick definitely sets the bar for hospitality and quality of experience.

I made reservations through the DAT program, and I'm sad that I didn't come in sooner.\nAs soon as you walk in the door the owner greets and hugs and kisses you on the cheek. Though I was mildly surprised by this instant affection, my friend who has come here previously said that is one of the main reasons they have so much repeat business. Service is very friendly and efficient. They give you just enough time and politeness, I hate when restaurants make you feel rushed or bothered for having to wait on you.\nI had their goat cheese tart - which was delicious - nice, warm, buttery tart dough with the tomato confit on top that blends nicely with the goat cheese. For my entree, the steak-frites - though not Bouchon spectacular it was close and the frites were plenty- no way one person can finish that serving. For Dessert the chocolate tarte was TDF!!! I couldn't finish it, as I was pretty stuffed but the creamy chocolate with a huge mountain of whipped cream - my mouth just drools thinking about it.

It's a Friday night around 8:30pm, with less than half the restaurant occupied. \n\nI feel compelled to write my first review because I think this place is highly overrated. \n\nBottom-line: If you want attentive wait staff, excellent service, and outstanding food, _skip this restaurant_. For quality food, remarkable service, and pay about the same amount by the end of dinner, head on over to Chapeau on Clement St. Now _that_ is a better \"hidden gem.\" \n\nAlright, so the details on Chouchou:\n\n- Our waiter Damien was inattentive, just as the rest of the wait staff. \n- We asked for a recommendation for our fish and he paired it with a red wine. The wine was too acidic and overpowered our fish (bass, salmon, and cod).\n- Wine and water glasses were completely empty and we had to request for the wine menu again AND refills of water.\n- The wine menu never came (even after waiting 10-15 minutes) and we had to request for it a second time. Don't they usually ask you whether you'd like another glass of wine when your glass is empty anyhow?\n- When asking for another wine recommendation (redemption really), he asked, \"what did you order again?\" Forgivable, I suppose. But after we tell him, he hesitates and stutters -- and then goes on to recommend a white wine...after we just finished a red. A lack of knowledge of the restaurant food and wine on-hand is unacceptable.\n- It took an hour to receive our main course, no apologies or anything.\n- When the food came, he gave me the wrong dish. Forgivable I guess...as the food was ordered an hour prior to delivery. \n- The three fishes were nothing extraordinary. In fact, they were all on the dry side. If you want a melt-in-your-mouth fish, _don't_ order the bass, salmon and cod (same dish).\n- For dessert we ordered the chocolate pear, as everyone had recommended. But I'm not sure what is appealing about an old, hard, dry brownie -- with two pieces of sugar-glazed pears. They could have at least warmed the brownie to make it softer, or drizzled it with a little fudge? I dunno. _Bake your own brownies, from a box -- and they'll still come out ten times more tasty._\n\nI don't know what went on at the restaurant tonight. Maybe I had a one-off experience, but the food isn't memorable and the service was absolutely appalling. I do not recommend this place, as there are other French restaurants in the city (i.e. La Folie, Chapeau) that are much better.", "author": "L C."}

Also done medium instead of med-rare.  A roast pork tenderloin was also dry, leaving only the salmon as the saving grace.  Very good and moist, great mushroom sauce with white wine.\n  \nWe waited a looong time for the dessert menu though we were sitting by the showcase deciding.  The chocolate tart was, as someone else noted dry and flat tasting, yes like a teenager's try at home without mom coaching.  The Fruit (pear) tart was better but not special, and a creme brulee was just good.\n\nService?  Well we too were all greeted with kisses and warmth on a blustery night and sat near the bar and desserts.  So any waitperson could see when we ran out of the bread, waters sat unrefilled until I asked, and the slow dessert end of the meal.  And it was fairly noisey as the room filled up. (give it three plus bells)\n\nThe parking lot is  beside the leaking of old milk products of the adjacent store and the muni only parking signs intimidating.\n\nSo the evening was not really enjoyable and the over $200 tab rubbed that in.

Underwhelmed is the key word for the other night. I don't think they were anticipating the volume of customers; there was one person fronting the floor, which made for slow service. We began with the Fourme D'Ambert tart ($9.00) which was smaller than a frozen mini pizza; I could've eaten one by myself. Heirloom Tomatoes ($9.00) followed. If you stacked up the individual slices, it would have equaled about one third of a regular tomato. Michael chose a Renard Viognier ($48.00) which was outstanding and complemented everything. I'd seen the Mussels ($15.00) on the last visit and had to have them with the accompanying frites. It may not have been the best time to order them as they were very small and tasted off for the most part - didn't Anthony Bourdain say something about seafood on Monday? The Frites were about as good as what I had in Paris - thin, crisp and with a note of rosemary. Michael and Christine both had the Halibut ($19.50 each), which they said was quite good. For dessert, we had a Walnut Chocolate Torte ($6.00) that Christine said was nothing special, and two of the Floating Island ($7.00 each). The server said it was a 'meringue' in sauce with almonds. Well, it wasn't the kind of meringue you get on a pie. It was more like one of those yolkless omelets that come in a milk cartoon, with the egg white flavor dominating. At least the espresso was the right price ($2.00).  With a couple of Sauternes ($17.00), out total came to $176.86, plus tip.", "author": "Chili Bill E."}

The last 3 reviews are definitely not the norm.  People speak about a waitress, I've been this place a ton and never seen a women working there, so she was obviously extra cover for the weekend. Service in this place on any other night apart from the busiest night of the year for restaurants is not slow, no way, never. Unless of course you want it to be, I've been in there for 3 hours before, sitting, drinking, relaxing. Mmmm\n\nNow the actual review....\n\nI've been dreading doing this as I really want to say horrible things about the place so it stays less busy - but I can't do that to Nick (the chef/owner)! Looks like below everyone is making a big deal out of Nick. Yes he is very friendly and French. The most important thing to know about him though is that he is working his butt off to make the restaurant successful and he really does give a crap. If you do go to ChouChou (which I hope you don't lol!) you'll see what I mean and in the unlikely event things aren't absolutely amazing talk to Nick (or Emmanuel, or Anatoli!!) - I guarantee you they will try and fix it. And to be honest you can't ask for more than that.  \n\nThe food is perfect. If you like the following then you won't find a better place in the city to get this style of food: steak tartar or foie gras for a starter, steak and frites for an entr\u00e9e, tart for dessert, and a ton of red wine, go home and nap.

I thought it was on the late side for dinner so I was surprised to see the place still packed and quite a few groups waiting to be seated. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were directed to the chef (at least I believe so because he was wearing a chef's jacket) to check in our reservation. He gave us hugs and kisses, a nice and surprising welcome, even though it was rushed and practiced. But I can't blame the guy; the place was so short-staffed, he was running around the whole restaurant, welcoming guests as well as bringing them to their tables. I'm not sure if they overbooked but I know there were a few other groups waiting with reservations at 8:30pm. Because of that, we weren't promptly seated at 8:30pm, more like 8:45pm. No biggie, we just chilled in the middle of the venue and took in our surroundings. \n\nThe venue itself could use some improvement. The lighting is rather dim and I saw a few people using their cell phones to illuminate their menu. They have a quaint little upstairs but as a whole still pretty small and I wouldn't recommend for big parties wanting to sit together. Everything was cramped together with a mess of people just standing around in the middle because there was no waiting area. The music was loud, bordering on obnoxious. It didn't annoy me so much but I think it would have been more enjoyable if some classy French music was on to enhance my French dining experience. \n\nThe same chef came up to us to offer his apologies that we couldn't be seated immediately, promised we'd be seated in the next 3min (but it took more like 10min...) and gave us 4 glasses of champagne, on the house! I thought that was a very lovely gesture. \n\nOnto the food. Verdict = excellent!! I started with the Frisee salad, with a poached egg and pancetta -- yum! One friend had the French onion soup -- very tasty! The endive tart tatin, endive stuffed with goat cheese and caramel -- a bit unique for my tastes but still interesting. For my entree, I had the filet mignon with a polenta-goat cheese cake -- it was delicious!! Oh my goodness, I don't know if it was because I was so famished since I waited so long to eat or because it really was that good! I had my filet mignon done medium, so juicy and tender, I was so sad that it was gone in a matter of minutes. The mini cake was surprisingly good! I'm not usually a fan of goat cheese but it went very well with the polenta. For dessert, I had the triple chocolate tart. I love chocolate but this tart wasn't what I imagined. I like rich chocolate and this was too doughy for my tastes. The whipped cream (from a can, I might add) redeemed the taste slightly. As you can tell, I wasn't as impressed with my choice of dessert but my friend's pear tart was fantastic!! It had real pears on it and was very tasty. We all also enjoyed a bottle of wine, 2006 merlot-chardonnay (I forget from where) -- very yum and it topped off the evening. \n\nMinus one star for not having a proper waiting area. Even though the service was a little rehearsed and phony, at least they tried and I appreciated that. I had a good dining experience and will be back again!", "author": "Cynthia W."}

As you turn the corner and enter the restaurant, it could easily be a scene from any cozy village restaurant in the hills of France. You are promptly greeted by the chef/owner with a warm \"Bon Soir!\" and the French dining experience begins. The ambiance is warm, but the food even better. I recommend the cassoulet - with it's authentic sesame crust, it smells and tastes as if it came from a French grandmother's oven.", "author": "C L."}

The ambiance is great, the servers are energetic and enthusiastic (without being obnoxious), and the food is simply delicious.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of french food. I've been to Fleur De Lys (supposedly the best french food in the city) and it was OK, but definitely not worth the price. Chouchou is excellent at any price, but as an added bonus, its not even that expensive.\n\nThe first time I went was for Dine About Town. I had the escargot appetizer (first time eating snails), duck entree, and one of their famous tarts for dessert. Everything was perfect, especially the escargot. My girlfriend got the gem of the night though - mussels in white sauce. This is the best mussels dish I've ever had, anywhere. We went again last night and got the mussels again.

One person didn't like the skate and, for the first time in his life, sent it back.  He had a crab appetizer instead because it was quick to prepare.

The entire experience was best summed up by Katy Perry - \"you're hot then you're cold, you're yes then you're no...\" and the song goes on. First we waited at the table about 20 minutes before we even got our menus (cold).  When we finally got to order, they brought some delicious warm crusty bread (hot) which they kept bringing since we probably ate an entire loaf while waiting for our appetizers (cold).  Most of the appetizers we chose were excellent.  Goat cheese tart, and fois gras pate were beautifully presented, and delicious (hot).  Escargot in red wine sauce was not that exciting (cold).   We ordered mussels and the niman ranch steak as entrees.  The steak was ordered medium rare, but came to the table very rare (cold).  We sent it back for a little more cooking, but of course it came back over done (still cold).  Then the dessert tarts - the fruit tart was quite delicious (hot), the chocolate one was not (cold).  I do have to say though, our waiter was always very pleasant and friendly, and had very good wine recommendations (hot).  Overall, too many hits and misses for this dining experience.

At first I thought he was slightly inebriated because he was so friendly, but luckily it was proven to be part of the restaurant's charming personality. Our group of five waited by the bar because the house was so packed. While we were getting warmed up to be seated, the host/server/bartender made us complementary mixers out of wine and sparkling water. After short 15 minutes we got seated by the window and ordered our wine, appetizers, and entrees. We split a large bowl of mussels with fennel/dill cream and a side of herbed fries which were great. I ordered a lamb cassoulet, a potpie type of dish with a bread-like crust-Chouchou's specialty. When the cassoulet was brought in front of me the Chef came over and asked if he could open it. He cut through the thick crust to smell the cassoulet, and told me to stick my head closer so I could do the same, which was pretty funny. It was filled with root vegetables, potatoes, and a good portion of lamb. I am typically not a huge fan of this type of food, but it was really good. We finished off the meal with a sample plate of chocolate and fruit tarts. To no surprise it was great.\n\nI have never seen chef and his staff so interactive with the dinners before. At the end our meal, the Chef sat down with us and we friend initiated a guessing game naming the herbs he mixed with the fries.

I am actually something of a foodie and appreciate unusual, complex flavors, but the heavy caramel with bitter endive at lukewarm (room) temperature was pretty narsty (both my fiancee and I agreed on this point).  We asked to have our appetizers replaced with a bowl of soup... and the chef proceeded to grill us as to whether we \"even knew what a tart tatin was,\" etc., etc..  (We said, yes, we do, incidentally, but these flavors don't work, please can we have some soup).  He left- then returned to argue with us AGAIN about whether we knew anything about food and kept correcting us (\"the flavors don't work FOR YOU, you mean\").  He never apologized, asked what he could do to help, or even brought our damn soup!  (much less bring something complimentary).  He was so rude and condescending (and the endive pile was so unappetizing), we put $40 on the table for our wine and left.

First of all this place is as much a hidden gem as is their parking lot. I missed the turn into the parking lot and ended up driving some where far without a U-turn. Got a little lost, but found one of the many parking places dispersed in the lamp-lit neighborhood. Very busy place as you enter through the curtains at the front. Haha, that just reminded me of ASIA SF which is a completely different class of entertaining dining. Anyway, Chou x 2 was awesome. From having Kronenbourg 1664 for $3.50 to having a funny waiter try to hit on my friend constantly throughout the night, this restaurant has a ton of character. I really think the waiter we had is almost as synonymous with the restaurants atmosphere as is the wonderful selection of French food. I tried the escargot which was sooo flavorful I forgot it was a sea snail. The cassoulet was new to me but I am sure was the best in its class. The dessert was great, too, and hey, if you ever want to order some tarts and stuff from this place you can order on line! I had an awesome time here especially because we reserved a table of four for three people. The fourth seat was occupied by a picture of my friend who wishes he was there with us. He got the most attention, aside from my other friend who got hit on by the waiter, by the tables sitting adjacent to us. His picture got hit on by two people!!

We arrived on time and there was no one else in the place.  Of all the tables in the restaurant, we were shown to what we considered the least desirable table, squeezed in between two larger tables in the middle of the empty restaurant.  Two couples came in afterwards and were seated at roomier window tables.  We ordered our appetizers and gave the waiter our wine to be opened.  He commented in a smirkey manner that our wine looked \"interesting\" (it was an expensive bottle, not 2-buck Chuck, so not sure what that was about).  As we were sharing our appetizer (a delicious sounding but ho-hum beet salad) and waiting for the second appetizer to arrive, our waiter told us we should order our entrees.  We said we were taking our time, and he said we should be mindful that the entrees might take 15-20 minutes.  We felt a bit rushed but ordered the entrees (she had chicken that was great, I had lamb that was mediocre at best).  Entrees arrived fairly quickly and before we were even done he asked if we wanted dessert.  As we ate dessert (good but not memorable, except that one of the two raspberries on my creme brulee was moldy) our check arrived.  As soon as I paid the check it was whisked away and the waiter gave us a look that said \"hurry up\".  Then the manager came over and asked us to leave because it was a Friday and, as he was sure we knew, they were busy.  We won't be going back or recommending this place to friends.  Go to Zazie or Chez Papa for better food and you can eat your meal at your own pace (I mean, it is a French restaurant -- and the French invented the leisurely meal!).\nOn the positive side, the prices at Chouchou are good.\n\nCorkage is $18 but they will waive if you purchase a bottle of wine with dinner.", "author": "Katie B."}

Although their cassoulet was actually a cassoulette, i.e., no beans but rather a lusciously complex lamb stew en croute, he was more than delighted.  I had the potato leek soup that was so like velvet in texture and wonderful on such a cold night.  On the first taste, I felt like the snide food critic from \"Ratatouille\" --- won over totally by the sheer wholesomeness of a simple  soup.  A nice plat de fromage as an appetizer and the walnut chocolate tart for dessert. An unpretentious and affordable Louis Latour chardonnay --- all heavenly.  Emmanuel the maitre-d' and waiter was incredibly attentive --- providing us both with a warm welcome and excellent service.  We both wanted to take up immediate residence at this bistro!  The only negative note was my entree: the vegetarian manicotti provencale with spinach, cheese and tomato, which was overcooked, not interesting, and complicated with some acrid variety of olive.

For dessert, I ordered the chocolate almond tart--I was a little disappointed because I have had better but it was still good. After dinner was over, we got to hangout a bit when everyone left and they let us chat. That was cool. Definitely come here for a dinner party (which I did!) and enjoy the company of good friends, conversation over a nice French meal! Great little hidden find!", "author": "Mel P."}

There's equivalent or better French food in San Francisco for these prices at other restaurants where you can eat in a more enjoyable atmosphere and not be dealt with in a fake and thus insulting way by the manager.  ALSO, the music was excruciatingly loud disco with a thumping beat that somehow clashed horribly with the escargot :)  When we asked our waiter to turn it down a notch he did, only to have the manager turn it up even louder two minutes later.  The waiter then confessed that he has this same war of the speakers almost every night with the manager almost always winning out over customer requests.  OY...

My friends Patric and Diana were in the country from Mexico, where they now reside. The friendliness and at homeness are the first things one notices as you are greeting upon coming into the restaurant. The service is superb, and our waitress Aya, was ever friendly, informative and engaging, the food was perfectly presented and cooked, and the ambiance was most enjoyable. Patric and Diana have been to Paris many times and upon leaving remarked, \"we are definitely going to tell our friends about this restaurant\". We brought our own wine, shared it with the maitre 'd as well as with our waitress Iya, and had a most wonderful meal. I highly recommend this moderately priced French restaurant to anyone wanting a good meal, to those who love French cuisine, or to anyone willing to venture into another land and experience. The wine list is a bit pricey, but most decent restaurants now overcharge for their wines. Their sparkling wines and wines by the glass are fairly  reasonable, but bring a good bottle if you don't mind the corkage and ensuring  great wine with your dinner.", "author": "daniel k."}

Very good left me wanted it more. I had the fish tartar which was Tuna, Salmon and Hallibut. The first two delicious the hallibut but disappointing, watery and flavorless. I had the trout which was fine, nice memorable, my partner had the duck which was so though that it was almost impossible to cut. Almost uneatable. The dessert was very good. We strongly recommend the tarts. Their wine selection was good and affordable. We sat upstairs and we wished we had sat down instead.

We got the floating island and apricot tart for dessert. The apricot tart was DELICIOUS! I thought it would be too sweet or dried apricots but it was fresh apricots and if I wasn't so full I would have eaten a whole tart pie. The floating island dessert was good because it was something different and we couldn't stop eating it, either. Before that, we had shared the PEI mussels which were good and filling! You can just share that as an entree, they come out with a heaping huge bowl FULL of them. The chicken liver salad and the frissee salad were good and flavorful, too. We ordered the crab stuffed raviolis which were very rich but tasty. But pretend you are in France and aren't in a hurry to get service because they aren't very efficient and attentive here. Due to the nicely tiled floor, our table was wobbly. Instead of fixing it, they just handed me over a napkin for me to do. Until I was tired of trying, then someone came over to fix it. The speed of when food comes out is a bit fast, too. And they kept running out of stuff: spinach, pork, etc. even though we weren't eating at 10pm or anything. Go if you have the time but save room for the dessert because that was the best part of the meal.", "author": "Vivian L."}

For entrees we had the halibut and cassolette, which were both cooked perfectly.  For dessert, we shared the creme bruelee which had great texture but was a little too sweet for me (admittedly, most desserts are too sweet for me though).

We were going to a movie at the Empire but had 2 hours before the flick. We had reservations and they sat us promptly. The place is cozy- tight tables, lotsa boisterous laugher so be prepared for that- very lively place!  We were seated upstairs which was more intimate and less noisy which was better for us. I would give the food a solid 3 stars.  Nothing was out of this world and there were a few misses.  The mushroom tart was ok but seemed to be lacking something.  Boring romaine salad with cherry tomatoes that were not ripe.  The rack of lamb was cooked very well but lacked flavor/ sauce/spices. My potatoes au gratin were undercooked and the potatoes were still crunchy.  The brussle sprouts were good.  We had a wine snafu- requested a nice bottle of Pinot Noir and picked out a pricey French bottle recommended by the French waitress. Neither of us liked the bottle and the hostess agreed to sell it by the glass and let us chose something else.  This is pretty amazing because you are really only supposed to send back a bottle if it is corked- not just because you don't like it.  So we picked another bottle and then the big guns came out.  A big British guy came to our table and although we felt at first we were the problem children now relegated to the dog house- he turned out to be very nice and helpful and wanted to make sure we were getting what we wanted out of a wine we chose so he walked us thru a different wine. The wine we got was quite good due to his recommendation.  The problem lies in fact that the wine list is lack-luster and a waitstaff who does not know or seem to care much about the wine part of the meal- except for the British guy.  Since wine is such an  important component  to our meal it was a bummer.  Our waitress was very lovely but clearly she was stressed and overworked and it showed.  Service was shall we say- more European in nature- so if you have been to Paris you know what I mean.  The hostess from Spain is a complete doll and so sweet and accommodating and even gave me a big hug as we were leaving.  Maybe it was an off night. Busy Friday nights at 7:30 I'm sure are hard.  They did surprise us with a free lovely dessert tart.  Maybe they know our experience had some challenges so I commend them for that and I think I would  like to give it another shot and hopefully be able to give them another star.", "author": "TravelBug W."}

We had not gone for perhaps a year or so and went this week with 2 friends who had been there recently and told us later they felt the quality had changed for the worse.  This was a Saturday night, but they were not overly busy. The service was friendly and competent.  My husband and I shared the frisee with lardons and poached egg salad.  It was more like a dish of lardons with a little frisee and though the flavors were basically good, the odd proportion of frisee to lardons and the very heavily drenched dressing made it unpalatable.  We also each had the tuna entree which was a large portion but sitting on a Jackson Pollack drip painting of balsamic vinegar with scattered black olives and some kind of stewed cabbage (?) hiding underneath.  All very syrupy vinegary, too salty and nothing fresh to balance those flavors.  The fish flavor was entirely overpowered.  One wondered if the chef had tasted his/her dishes at all.  We declined dessert and our check came with a few gift slices of apricot tart which turned out to be tasty.  I would not go back, nor would our friends who were equally unhappy with their dinner. Perhaps other items on the menu were more successfully executed, but no menu, especially one as small as ChouChou's should contain such disappointments.  I think it is somehow worse when a restaurant of a certain quality, whether by accident or design, allows that quality to drop dramatically while presenting the same name and face to the public.  We need all the good eats we can get in West Portal so this is a real disappointment.", "author": "ann m."}
