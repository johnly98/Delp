This place was pretty cool and cute in the Financial district. What got me were the glass bottles. I think it has been over a year or two since I came back, and recently this place has changed a bit. They still have the glass bottles, and same menu but I think the food menu has changed a bit and maybe owner? But anyways all in all this place is great, their teas are fresh and I like the glass bottle that goes with it. I also like their tapioca, its made pretty good, as some places tend to leave it out long and its very hard and chewy. Unfortunately its in downtown area, so I cannot make my way here as often. This place does get busy, and parking can be a pain depending on time of day. It is on the pricyer side for teas so I cant say I would come back here everyday. Service is great and quick would def recommend everyone to come here and try it out if they have not already. \n\nMy favorite drinks to order are the : Mango green tea w/ lychee jelly, peach green tea, matcha latte (really good), lavender lemonade, and their house milk tea. Also a good thing about the glass bottles are you can re-use them and bring it back.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

Well, when the wedding reception you're going to in a block or two away, why not?? To say the other wedding guests were excited then upset that boba wasnt actually being served is a bit of an understatement. Everyone loves their boba lol...\n\nBut anyway, about Plentea. I thought the quality of the tea was pretty apparent in the taste. The jasmine tea scent was sooo fragrant and obvious in taste. I'd say it's one of my favorite jasmine milk teas I've had. The boba was also chewy and fresh and tasted like it was sitting in honey too. I ordered the matcha tea latte and that was also delicious! They use all organic teas and milks which I can really taste. And the cute glass bottles are of course another great marketing point (reduce plastic!!) and was actually quite convenient to cap off when I needed to store my boba away for a second. \n\nDrinks run about $5 or more if you add boba but if you buy two drinks and check in on yelp, you can get 15% off!

As someone who has really aesthetic friends, Plentea really helped me flex on them - \"yeah your nicely edited photo of your latte and laptop at a coffee shop is aesthetic but have you ever had Thai milk tea in a glass bottle?\" I'd like to think that when they saw my photos of my bubble tea in a glass bottle they whispered to themselves \"damn I need me one of those\".\n\nAnyways.\n\nGenerally, bubble tea makes me feel bloated afterwards. I realize this is because they probably use powder, or because their tapioca comes from some questionable source, who knows. With Plentea's drink offerings, it tasted clean and like real tea and milk, which is something I appreciate a lot and I'm willing to pay the premium if I know what I'm drinking is not powder. I can even see the staff make my drink in front of me, which is more reassuring than the places that have someone take my order, disappear into the back, and come back with my drink. \n\nI've had here the Thai milk tea, Nutella milk tea, and the roasted oolong milk tea. I thought the Nutella milk tea would be too sweet and my friend who didn't wanna take risks didn't order it, but it was actually really pleasant - not overwhelmingly sweet, it just tasted like a nice milk tea with hints of Nutella. My goal is to try everything on the menu before I leave SF.\n\nAnd again... glass bottles. You don't even pay more than you would at other popular bubble tea shops... maybe a bit less actually. Maybe I'm a sucker for these novelties, but it's what drew me in and the quality of the milk tea is what kept me coming back.", "author": "Calvin Z."}

I'll be honest (and tacky): the only reason we decided to go here instead of the billion other boba tea places in SF was because of the milk jars these guys sell their tea in. Usually shops make you pay extra for glass jars, at least here in LA. \n\nI had the original black tea blend with boba and my husband had the strawberry banana smoothie with boba. We also went back to grab tea before departing SF and he tried their pineapple infused jasmine tea. \n\nThe wait is a little long considering how many employees they have working, but all of the staff were very friendly and we didn't receive any funky, messed up orders. \n\nThe black tea was really delicious with a deep, rich flavor that was perfect with half sugar. Like their signs say, it does come with a noticeable hint of chocolate which I loved. The boba was chewy and not soggy at all; ya just can't do soggy boba unless you're crazy.\n\nThe smoothie was just okay, it wasn't anything special, but the pineapple green tea was amazing. It came with little chunks of fresh pineapple and somehow both the tea flavor as well as the pineapp flavor were very much there. Usually these \"infused\" teas from other shops are kind of watered down or tastes like fruit syrup so the one from Plentea was a pleasant surprise. I wound up taking so many sips of this one that my husband ended up asking if I'd like to switch...\n\nThe $5 a tea price tag is fair for what you get even if other places might sell for slightly cheaper.

It looks really nice from the outside and inside.\n\nAt first I thought it was going to be pricey since they offer the glass bottles but it is very comparable to the other boba places around the area that give you the normal plastic cups. I ordered the peach oolong green tea with boba. I like that they add real peach bits in there and surprisingly unlike some of the other reviews I saw, it wasn't too sweet at all. Actually a little on the 30% sweetness level which is how I like it. The boba could have been a little softer but when I am craving it, it's not a big deal.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but if I were walking around and close by I would definitely visit again.

I purchased the sea salt cream oolong tea and a matcha latte. I must say, this was one of the best matcha drinks I've ever gotten from a tea shop. I watched the matcha being made with the traditional Japanese tools, and how she layered the drink- it's so pretty and smells so good freshly made! I highly recommended this place! Their boba is really soft and thankfully not overly sweet, perfect to leave more emphasis on the tea. The combo of the refreshingly well done tea and overall aesthetic won me over.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-30", "description": "Plentea is another popular Boba Milk Tea place in FiDi. Unlike the other places, it is open late, which has got me here a couple of times. The menu here is simple consisting of Classic Milk Teas, Special Milk Teas, Cold Brewed Teas, Ice Blended Drinks and Hot Teas. For milk you have options for both dairy (Clover whole and half-and-half) and non-dairy (Silk Soy and Califia Almond). For toppings you have boba, aloe, grass jelly, lychee jelly, chia seeds and egg pudding (50c each). Sweetness can be customized to your liking (100%, 50%, 25% or 0%). It seems to cross all boxes as far as options are concerned.\n\nOver a period of time I've tried most of their Classic and Special Milk teas. One thing that distinguishes Plentea from other boba tea places is their insistence on using glass bottles instead of plastic cups, supposedly to help the environment. In today age when you can get fully compostable cups and straws, insisting on using glass bottles for protecting the environment is just wrong. Let's call it what it is, a marketing ploy that positions Plentea differently from their competitors. Goes without saying I am not a fan of these glass bottles as they feel heavy and makes holding the drink painful. I would prefer if they give you a choice of getting a glass bottle rather than palming them off on everyone. Anyway let's move on to the drinks.\n\nThe short and simple review would be that their drinks are good not great. It took a little trial and error to get to my customization right here. I started by getting my drinks 50% sweet, but found that for my taste I needed their regular sweetness (but that would be a little sweet for most people). Then I replaced whole milk with half-and-half as whole milk tended to undermine the tea taste and lastly getting less ice prevented the teas from becoming diluted with time.\n\nFrom the drinks that I've tried, I like their Jasmine Green tea and Nutella Milk Tea. The Jasmine tea has a strong Jasmine flavor that shines through even at 100% sweetness. What I didn't like was the Matcha Latte. It was pretty weak and needed a lot more Matcha powder to give it the bitter sweet finish.\n \nMost of the teas are just under the $5 mark which with toppings will put you about $6 a cup give or take, which is in line with what you would pay at the fancy Boba Guys but 10% more than what you would pay at i-Tea just a block down. In my pecking order for Boba tree places in FiDi (or at-least the ones that I've been to) Plentea lies in the middle of i-Tea and Boba Guys, with i-Tea on top and Boba Guys at the bottom. During normal hours I prefer to go to i-Tea and end up coming to Plentea only for a late night boba fix.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

The drink list got smaller and even the signature drink bottles changed a little with the caps being a hard cap that you can screw on versus a flimsy plastic cap. \n\nHowever, the drinks are just as mediocre. The tea flavor from the drinks aren't that prominent and the flavor itself like they advertise like mango aren't that prominent either.

Generally, Plentea isn't my number one option, but I needed another one of their cute jars after mine had broken so that took me and my friend here!\n\nI think San Francisco has at least 2 different Plentea locations, and the one on Kearny was the closest one to us. Unfortunately, the parking here is especially horrendous since it's between Chinatown and the financial district, so you may have to loop around a few times or double park.\n\nBut after you find parking, you'll walk into a different world, a more beautiful world without walls separating people~ Plentea is known for its aesthetics and you see it right when you pass through the door. There's beautiful lights all around the ceiling and walls, there's cute plants on shelves, and the atmosphere is overall cute and welcoming.\n\nSo how do the drinks stack up? Plentea has your average assortment of boba drinks; they stick with what's popular like jasmine milk tea, oolong, and black milk tea as well as matcha. When we came here, my friend got the original milk tea and I got the oolong. Pro tip: do not swap out the milk base when you order; I've heard it doesn't taste was good. \n\nDrinks came out a few minutes later in their cute jars, and after taking our instagram pictures, we dug in. My friend loved her milk tea and thought the boba was amazing. I'm a huge fan of oolong and thought that my drink was good, but watered down and a bit too sugary. However, I finished that thing quick cause it was still good! \n\nOverall, I enjoyed this Plentea. The tea was okay even though mine was way too sweet because the taste was decent and the price was not bad for the fact that you get to KEEP THE JAR!!!, but I wouldn't come here above other places in the Bay.

The poor guys managing the counter at Onigilly must get excited when someone approaches the entrance just to lean against their shop windows, waiting for a shot at Plentea.\n\nIt's 15% off of 2 drinks if you check in on Yelp, and in an attempt to be environmentally conscious, 10% off if you bring your glass bottle back. We got a sea salt creama oolong and strawberry tea, both with tapioca, and were pretty pleased. While waiting in the cramped shop (hey folks, there's lofted seating upstairs!), I watched them make the strawberry tea and leave it sitting on the prep counter for five minutes while my oolong was ready. With four people making drinks at the same station, it gets busy back there. It would likely be more efficient if they had someone also calling out order numbers, as some people are reeeeeally slow at picking up orders.\n\nIt's weird that they used bottled waters to make their teas that didn't look like they were glass, but I invite them to prove me wrong on that. We can at least taste the difference in quality, so er...taste buds 1, recycling bins 0? I didn't see a place to recycle the bottles either, so I think it'd be more in line with their mission and other glass-enthusiasts like T.epiphany if there was an option to give the bottles back.", "author": "Gwen W."}

However, it's definitely not my favorite boba place in the area.  I suppose I'm turned off by the slightly higher prices and less variety.  It doesn't taste horrible or anything... I'm just not amazed.  I literally only came here recently because it was the only place open later at night (besides Boba Guys, everything closes before 9 pm).  \n\nBottom line: go ahead and try it out if you've never been.

The tea flavor is lacking. The boba is just ok - not really chewy. Also I feel like the amount of drink they give you is a lot less than other places. The drinks did have fruit in them - bits of strawberry and orange peel, which is a plus. I like that they have the glass bottles, even if we have to pay a little extra for them. But I don't live close by so I never remember to bring the bottles back. They're open pretty late, which is good when you're in the area, craving boba late at night and other tea places are closed.

It looked good and I hadn't been in about a year so was excited to try it after it had been a while! \n\nI got the roast oolong tea ($4.50 + boba, 50 % sugar, less ice )while my friends got the Nutella milk tea ($4.95 + boba) and oolong salt cream ($4.95 + boba)! You get 15% off 2 drinks (doesn't apply to roe than 2 drinks) if you check in. \n\nHonestly the texture of the boba was excellent (think better than some of the boba guys places I've been before, much improved since the last time I had been) and I could tell how fresh the milk tea was! Roast oolong had the perfect creaminess to it with the whole milk, so 5/5 would recommend! Friends like their drinks, and noted that the Nutella milk tea was slightly less sweet than it used to be, and almost like a chocolate milk!\n\nWe also got free cups of water when we asked so don't be shy if you need some too after drinking all that boba! Price point is pretty good especially since you get to keep the bottle and can bring it back for a discount- and they have new metal lids instead of plastic! \n\nOverall, great and will be back again soon! \n\nPS they redid their counter set up so that you pick up the boba on the side instead of the front like before!", "author": "Kristie M."}

I came around 5-6pm on a Saturday evening. I was very surprised to see that it wasn't packed but there was a few customers ordering. The last time (and first time) I came, it was quite crowded with music pumping. It's nice to a peaceful and calm vibe sometimes at boba places but I'd rather it be more alive...ESPECIALLY on a Saturday. \n\nThere isn't PLENTEA enough of drinks to choose from their menu but still enough choices to pick out a drink. They offer milk teas such as Jasmine, Roasted Oolong, and Earl grey. Plentea also has hot drinks such as Hot Oolong milk tea and cold brewed teas (Peach oolong, Premium mountain oolong, etc). They're are mostly known (in terms of drinks) for their Sea Salt Creama which I recommend to those who haven't tried it yet. I'm not a huge fan of Taro Milk tea but for all those Taro lovers out there, Plentea doesn't offer Taro Milk tea.\n\nThe guy who took our order was very quick and attentive. He was really informative by letting us know that the sweetness of their Thai tea cannot be adjusted. Kindly, he offered us a sample to see if it was too sweet for my mom's liking. Once we got our drinks, the person who made my drink even asked me to tell him if I needed more sugar in my Jasmine Milk tea! After that, I was highly appreciative of their amazeballs customer service. Rarely any places I try out, gives us a sample when we ask if one of their drinks are too sweet before we order. That's mostly why I was really impressed with their customer service. Y'all are doing that portion right for sure. \n\nI ordered the Jasmine Milk Tea with boba (surprise surprise), my sister got the Matcha Milk Tea with egg pudding, and my mom got the Thai tea also with egg pudding. Can I just say, Thank you Plentea very MATCHA for that Jasmine Milk Tea. It was definitely one of the best Jasmine Milk Tea I've ever tasted in my mouth. The tea was just as strong as the amount of half and half they put in. The creaminess of the half & half and the brewed taste of the Jasmine was just BOOOOOM. They also put in the matcha in front of you if you order the Matcha milk tea which creates a cool ombr\u00e9 mixed effect. That adds on even more to this Tea place that just shouts aesthetic. \n\nThe guy who took my order was even considerate enough to ask me if I wanted whole milk or half and half with my Jasmine Milk Tea. I didn't catch his name or the one who made my drink but I thank them for making my second experience here more enjoyable.\n\nI'd give this place 4.5 stars due to the fact they can't adjust the sugar for some of their drinks like the Thai Tea since it's pre-made.", "author": "Danielle A."}

I was drawn to the place because of the unique mason jars that they use for their drinks. It is a very cool concept and different from a lot of the other boba places I have visited. Honestly though, the only good thing about this place was the mason jar concept. I ordered the oolong milk tea with tapioca, but I could barely taste the tea, and it seemed like it was pre-made because I didn't feel like the tea had been freshly brewed and mixed with the milk tea. The tapioca was also very small in size relative to other boba I have tried. I wish the tapioca was a bit bigger and had a sweeter taste.\n\nI also think that the volume of the drinks are not that much, and the jar deceptively presents the drink to seem like it is a large quantity for the same price, if not more relative to other boba places. I was not that impressed, but it was very cool that they didn't charge extra for the jar and let you keep it as well.

The glass bottles looked so hip, the drinks so perfect for summer.\n\nI've been here at this job for a year now. The bottles no longer seem as hip (perhaps the 30-strong bottle collection at work has something to do with it), but some of the drinks here can still be good. In direct comparison to my first time at Plentea, today was cold, rainy, and windy. The bf was in town after a business meeting so we stopped here for a quick drink. He got a strawberry black tea with boba. The strawberry flavor was reminiscent of Smucker's strawberry jam, but less sweet, with a strange, unnatural aftertaste. Boba isn't as chewy as I'd like it to be.\n\nWhat I'd recommend getting here are the ice milks (yum!). Pro tip: If you're trying to watch your calories, drink half of it (and all the bobas) and put it in the freezer for another day! What I also like about this place compared to iTea and Boba Guys is that there's actually a place to sit (a cute little alcove upstairs!). \n\nI've also had some of the foods-- the smoked salmon salad and tiramisu.

The menu includes classic milk teas, fruit milk teas made with real fruit, blended milk tea, and iced teas plus a small assortment of small plates that range from sweet waffles to fried fish balls. They also have a specials board with rotating seasonal teas and offerings.\n\nI immediately went for one of their specials: sea salt cream oolong tea. Sea salt cream is my absolute favorite but not many tea houses carry it, so when I see it I have to order it. My girlfriends ordered the black milk tea and the almond milk tea. We all added boba, of course! The sea salt cream oolong tea was good but not the best I've had. I really liked that the tea wasn't overly sweet and I could really taste that distinct oolong profile, but the sea salt cream wasn't well balanced. It leaned a bit too much on the salty side and the consistency could have been more on the meringue side rather than melty. If you love sea salt cream, you know what I mean. \n\nI tried my friends' drinks and they were good but nothing to write home about it. Though major points for not being drenched in sugar; I hate it when tea house do that. The cute glass jars can go home with you or can be recycled with the shop which I thought was really cool for those of us that have an abundance of cutesy mason jars from other foodie adventures (guilty!).\n\nThe service was friendly. Just a note for debit/credit card users they only accept for purchases $10 or more which I can know can be annoying but I'm used to this with tea houses. We also used the 15% off check-in offer on Yelp with no problem, they just let us know that it would only apply to two drinks which was fine with me.", "author": "Stephanie P."}

This is one of those boba places going for that natural/healthy angle, so there aren't that many drink choices. I liked that they use actual fresh fruit for flavoring in a way that compliments the drink and doesn't just garnish it. I didn't adjust sweetness and found it just right when most other boba places make their regular orders syrupy sweet by default. I had the peach oolong and liked it, but thought it was a little funny that it's actually nectarines in the drink and not peach. Don't think they need to change the fruit in the drink, because that's what I liked about it, but... Overall, a thumbs up on quality and taste.\n\nOn the other hand, not so much a fan of the prices or the practicality of the glass bottling. It's cute and novel at first, but that 10% discount for bringing back the bottle only amounts to quarters. I hope that they actually reuse/wash bottles customers bring back and don't just recycle them, because if it's the latter, then the glass bottle is not environmentally friendly at all (recycling uses markedly more energy than reusing since it involves destroying the bottle and repurposing). As for practicality, what if you're just walking by on the way to somewhere else? The glass bottle (whether full or empty) is heavy and impractical to carry with or without a bag. I kept mine and am reusing it, but for frequent customers I imagine few keep all the ones they've bought.\n\nSERVICE// The girl who took my order was polite and friendly.

If you don't want to take one home, you can leave your empty bottle in the tub next to the straws; if you want to take it home, grab a cap (also located next to the straws) so that any remaining liquid doesn't spill out while you're in transit.\n\nThere's usually a line out the door if you go during peak social hours (i.e., weekends, weekday evenings after work) but it moves fairly quickly. There are some seats on the ground floor, but there's also a cute seating area upstairs that's a little more secluded.\n\nStaff is super friendly. You can get 15% off of two drinks if you check in on Yelp! And if you don't like the way that your drink turns out, they're happy to make another for you.

Came on a weekday afternoon and the line was still way out the door, about a 20 minute wait. \n\nFor a tiny boba shop in the heart of SF, Plentea's not bad when it comes to interior ambiance. While the loft seating is commendable, the layout of the bottom is just a bit disappointing. In the name of aesthetics, the already scarce amount of space is further reduced; I was sitting with my friend on a side table waiting for our order, but as more people ordered after us and took a seat as well, we were basically locked in and had to ask each and every person who sat down to move for us to go back to the front register. \n\nCustomer service was a mixed bag. While the guy who took our order had a pleasant attitude, I honestly didn't feel like he gave us truthful opinions about the menu. We asked several questions, only to hear very generic responses that basically meant \"everything is good, everything is popular\". While arguably a smart answer, it just seemed like a copout to me.\n\nThe peach green tea my friend got was pretty refreshing and didn't scream \"I'M MADE WITH SYRUP!\" thanks in part to the bits of peach on top. My mango milk tea was a bit disappointing though. I already had my doubts with a fruity milk tea, because when I've ordered it at other teahouses in the past the flavoring and creamer starts separating after a while. I had to learn the hard way that this place is no different :( On the bright side, the very aesthetically pleasing glass jars are included in the price!\n\nOverall, not a bad place; just be prepared to wait, not have good seating, and be careful with what you order LOL.", "author": "Vincent L."}

Yes, it was \"strong\" tasting but the kind of artificial flavoring you get in the instant coffee mixes. My boyfriend didn't even finish his drink. The creama tea was made from oolong tea.

For locals, it's one less glassware I have to buy at Ikea. It does up the price of the average milk tea to around $5 and that's before the toppings/boba is counted. But then again, you're in SF and most of the trendy boba shops are that expensive these days. \n\nI had the CoffMilk which was a coffee milk tea and I was disappointed that it didn't look like what was pictured on the menu with the swirls of white and dark brown floating down to the bottom. Instead, it was already all mixed in and looked similar to a Starbucks Frappuccino bottle. Taste-wise, it was just as similar to the Mocha Frap you can buy at Safeway although slightly more diluted with the ice. \n\nTea-wise, I'm not blown away. I wouldn't fork over my $5 for it on any occasion except for when I'm needing a new bottle or have a friend visiting from out of town. I do think the experience of coming here is unique because you can watch them make the drinks and they use a funnel to pour in the boba into the bottles. It definitely beats watching the boba cup sealer machine (although that has its fun at times). And who can resist the allure of having your own Plentea bottle to keep?\n\nImportant Tidbits: Make sure to get a plastic cap for your bottle. They're at the counter. But they aren't 100% seal proof so don't put your full trust in it. There's a Yelp check-in offer for 15% off two drinks so check-in on Yelp. Credit card minimum is $10.

But she refused to make it sweet, and said if I want more later then they will add it. \n\nAt first taste, it wasn't good, it was tasteless. I asked the worker to make it sweeter and he kindly did. The experience was definitely cool, I love the reusable bottles, but this really isn't my cup of tea (literally). I've had better in the city, but definitely worth a try!", "author": "Cindy D."}

The place was pretty packed on New Years Eve, but service was pretty quick!\n\nDRINKS: I got the strawberry fruit tea with chia seeds.

I always get 0% sugar, and it was hard for them to give me no sugar. It isn't a problem, since I understand that a lot of boba spots pre-mix or prep their teas (like taro tea is notorious) beforehand. So I wasn't bummed, but told them that I didn't like my tea too sweet. \n\nThere wasn't a long line, but we waited for a while...10-15 minutes for two drinks. Their glassware truly makes the tea seem very special, but once you strip that part away...their bubble tea is very creamy, milky, and on the sweeter side :\\ I'm a big fan of Taiwanese style boba, and plentea just didn't do it for me. I could see why millenials love this place (snapchat/insta purposes), but their quality of tea barely had a tea flavor...and I wouldn't go out of my way to (impossibly) park near Chinatown to get plentea.

Their walls use to have see through bars where you could sit and see everything from downstairs. Now they put a concrete wall where you can't see anything at all when you're sitting down.

I'm a sucker for reusable shizz-nizz and you'll get a discount the next time you bring the bottle back. Save a little bit of moolah and save the earth a little by throwing less stuff away. Lightweight Win-Win.\n\nFirst time I came in they were out of bottles, I was sad, but they gave me 10% off to compensate. I ordered the fresh fruit tea--mango black. $4.95 oh snaps! and that's just for a regular size. I know its SF but dang! Herra pricey. I could almost get 2 drinks at Tpumps for that price! They better be using the highest quality ingredients. If I'm paying $5 for some boba that stuff better be ORGAN-NIC! But anyways, the drink was good, refreshing and boba balls were on point. LOL. Mango bits on the other hand were hard tho...\n\nI tried their hot pastrami waffle sammie with mixed greens on the side. Sandwich was good but needed more melted cheese. Salad needed some dressing tho. I gave it 2.5 out of 4 noms.\n\nCame back on another day and yessuh, bottles were back in stock (best to come the first half of the day to ensure you'll get a bottle). I ordered the fresh fruit tea again--strawberry black. Under $6 with bottle, not bad not bad (I mean you get to keep the bottle). Again, drink was good, refreshing and boba balls were topnotch. \n\nOverall I give them 2.5 stars. Drinks are good, but not really worth the price...even with the 10% discount. Might as well buy the bottle everytime, it'll only be a dollar (plus change) extra... Drop the prices down a dollar and I'll be here all the time.

Since I was going to be in the city for a brief moment and it was a 5-7 minute walk away from the Montgomery BART Station, I figured, why not come a little early and grab a drink before my 11:45am meeting.\n\nWell they open at 11am which was perfect. They're located north of Muracci's Japanese Curry which getting full as I passed by on Kearny. It's a small little spot though looks are deceiving. There seemed to be a second floor where you could hang out, though the downside is that they don't have a public restroom and downing a large drink...you're going to need a restroom as I needed it after my 1.5 hour meeting...I know TMI. \n\nThe drink menu is over the kitchen/register area and they have a range of drinks from teas, milks, teas with fruit pieces etc. The drinks range but expect to spend about $5-ish dollars esp if you're going to be adding some toppings like honey boba, pudding, lychee jelly, etc which are $0.50 each. There are some hot drinks though I don't think they put those in the glass bottle, which gets me to their \"thing.\" They put your drinks in a glass bottle which you can of course take home and thus the premium though I feel that it's a worthy price considering a lot of boba places charge around the same price and you don't get a bottle to take home with you. Another plus is that you can bring the bottle back and get 10% off your next order. Either way you're getting a snazzy little bottle which I am now using as a water vessel.\n\nThey also have food on a chalkboard menu on the wall. It looked like they had waffles as the bread and some fillings. I wasn't really focused on it, I was there for the drink.\n\nSo I ordered a Premium Mountain Green Tea (which you can get oolong and black too which I was a bit confused about...) with honey boba and got 20% sweetness. To be honest it wasn't sweet so glad I got at least 25%. The honey boba had a good chew but there was no honey taste. So I've had honey boba at Half & Half in SoCal and that is honey boba. You get the taste of the honey which I actually don't like too much, but it does give it a bit of sweetness. \n\nWas the tea mindblowing? No. For me, the boba was fine they did okay with it. To me it's like your typical boba place but you get a nice little glass bottle takeaway. Would I come back? I'm curious about the milks and the creamas so I'll be back to try them at least. Also note, there's a credit card charge for any charge under $10.", "author": "Carolen M."}

That's a good thing because (as I've heard) its ridiculous during the week. There was a good selection to choose from, I was overwhelmed and looked on yelp for assistance (read some tips). The menu looked typical for the most part - then the \"pudding\" caught my eye. Who doesn't want to try boba with flavored pudding?! \n\nCARAMEL ICED MILK WITH TARO PUDDING - the drink was served in a glass jar. The caramel iced milk tasted like boba but instead of those fruity flavors it was a milky caramel flavor. There were two options for the pudding, I chose taro because it sounded more interesting to pair with the caramel iced milk. I was not disappointed of my pickings and it definitely satisfied the sweet tooth. It is a bit strange to be sucking purple pudding through a big boba straw. Imagine a big blob of pudding at the bottom of your cup and the straw just sucking away at it. The soft silky blobby texture of pudding was different than the tapioca balls and jellies that are usually served - my palette was not bored.\n\nWill I be back? Maybe.

There is no Rewards System because they give you the glass jars and returning with the jar gives you 10%, pretty sweet deal if you frequent Plentea often. Cash/card accepted. There's also a limited menu of food items (sandwiches and waffles) as well, and although the drinks are slightly pricier, I don't mind the glass jars for my drinkware collection. \n\nOverall, the teas are authentic and pretty decent. My mistaken Oolong Milk Tea was pretty tasty but it wasn't what I wanted. 50% Sweet was sufficient; 75% Sweetness is probably my max (25% - 100% Sweetness level offered).

I liked how each of their teas come in a cute glass bottle to take home n it's reasonably priced. (looks like an old style milk bottle.) if u come back with the empty bottle for them to refill the next time, it's 10% off. \n\nI ordered an Almond Milk Tea with 50% sweetened. it was WAY too sweet (he didn't even want another sip of it.) n I really couldn't taste the tea flavor in it either. there should b a balance between the tea n other additional flavors n not just an over abundance of the latter. however, I'm interested in trying their other crema drinks so I'm willing to give Plentea another shot.

The line was out the door, but didn't take long to get to the front. Maybe 5 minutes and another 5 minutes to get our order.\n\nSadly, the tea here is average at best. However, they do come in some pretty cool mugs (jars?)! Consolation prize, but at least it's not particularly expensive for a jar of tea. About $4.50-5.00 for a bottle. Not including any toppings at about 50c each.\n\nI opted for the Almond Milk Tea but was right to be cautious. It tasted very creamy and like it was made from powder. I know a lot of places opt for the powder almond, but I still don't know why. It just doesn't taste nearly as good as the syrup form and the texture is just weird in tea form.\n\nOn the other hand, the Sea Cream Tea that my friend got tasted pretty good. Not too sweet and didn't have the texture issue that I had with my Almond Milk Tea.\n\nIf you're in the mood for milk tea and want something nearby, by all means, stop in.

I ordered the strawberry smoothie and my total was a little over seven bucks. There was nothing particularly special or different about the experience other than the bottle, which is admittedly cool, but there's no justification for the price, sorry. The smoothie was at least delicious, made with real strawberries (leaving chunks of berry in my drink, which was great) and a great combination with boba, and I think it's nice that you get a 10% discount if you bring your bottle back on your next visit.\n\nPlentea gets an extra star for the pretty cool space, which has a loft area above the registers and has a clean, open, airy interior.

I give the actual bubble tea 3 stars but I added another star because I liked the jar so much. The milk tea was a little sweet in my opinion, and the bubbles were kind of small and not too flavorful.

Obviously this was so I could more fairly compare it to Bottle Zup, which is a very similar boba shop. I also wanted to go running, but needed a motivator, so obviously the solution was to make a bubble tea shop the destination and boba my reward.\n\nUnfortunately (for those who may have been pedestrians between my apartment and Plentea), I did not have the opportunity to run over a mile back home carrying a bottle full of boba in one hand and a bubble tea straw and my phone in the other, as I did when I visited Bottle Zup. This is partly because I was feeling lazy and the Montgomery Muni stop is nearby, and partly because Plentea only gives a plastic cap to cover the bottle, and I was afraid it wouldn't hold up under the stress of my running home.\n\nAs for the drink itself, the boba had a nice chewy consistency to it and was slightly sweet, but I am not a fan of the matcha latte. It wasn't too sweet, but the blend tastes more like jasmine green milk tea than matcha, but I am not a fan of the super-blended, mild-tasting matcha. I like my matcha strongly-flavored and textured, so this didn't quite hit the right note.\n\nThis place is pretty overpriced--I paid nearly $6 for my drink after tax, and had to pay in cash ($10 credit card minimum) which is a pain because it meant that I had to carry cash there while running and carry change back! The glass bottle is sturdy and slightly bigger than the one from Bottle Zup, but even if I bring it back for the 10% discount, I'm not sure it's worth it. I like the novelty of the glass bottle, but you could easily get the same for slightly better tea at Bottle Zup. The one thing Plentea does have going for it is that it stays open so late (until 11pm) which is super convenient in a city where so many places (specifically boba places) close so early.", "author": "Stephanie H."}

It seems a tad bit out of place in the more oldschool neighborhood as a shiny cafe boasting large, clean birch planks and a minimalist logo in an artsy font.  The birch accents extend to the interior, and together with the menu written on the chalkboard, the high stool seating, and half second level layout, it gives off a very clean and modern vibe.  \n\nPerhaps an advantage of the chalkboard menu is that they can raise prices easily, because when I went the prices were slightly higher than what I had seen on Yelp.  Paying almost $5 for milk tea is pricey, but you are buying drinkware as well.  Service was alright; it had a hint of that hipster edginess and they didn't ask me about ice/sugar level preferences when I forgot to ask.  Also, be sure to grab a cap!  It's quite useful for the future use of the jar.\n\nI got the iced milk tea with black tea, which turned out to be good but not all too amazing--it might have been the creamer, but I thought there was a bit of a strange taste to the milk tea overall.  At least the jars are large size so there was Plentea of tea.

The hot milk tea was actually not bad. Nothing stand out, but not bad. Still insanely expensive though. Was about $4.50 for one.\n\nThe second time I went, I was determined to do it right, so I got a pearl milk tea. First of all... at $5.44 who has the money for milk tea that expensive??? I'd rather go down the street and at least get high quality pmt from Boba Guys or something. I get that part of that money is paying for the bottle, but when the milk tea is really mediocre, $5.44 is ridiculous. Honestly it tasted like $1 pmt you can get in Richmond. Tea itself was very dilute and flavorless and the pearls were clumpy--i.e. you'd bite down and find your teeth stuck. No bounce at all, no flavor. At least I got a bottle out of all of this?\n\nI will say they have some interesting dessert options, so if a friend ever wants to try the place...

The sea salt foam was really good, slightly salty and slightly sweet.  However the tea was awful.  Was I even drinking tea?  It has literally almost no tea flavor!  Maybe there is too much sugar (even though I got reduced sweetness) to even taste the tea.\n\nTo add to this the service is lacking.  I get that you are busy, but if you can't multitask correctly then maybe you should stick to doing one thing at a time.  The dude picked up a phone call in the middle of my order.  So when he asked if I wanted boba in my drink, which I repeated before and after his call, he must have missed it.  My drink was lacking boba, and when my friend told a different guy, he said he can't add it.  Then the original guy said he could, but after he takes my drink says it's 55 cents.

I wasn't too amazed by it since the flavors were okay. My egg pudding was kind of off though? Everytime I took a sip and consumed egg pudding, these white little small crumbs I guess were on the egg pudding? Not sure if this is because it was old or not. I finished the drink tho without any issues.", "author": "Jayson M."}

First off, there are two stories to Plentea, which allows \"plentea\" of room for hanging with friends or getting some work done. Personally, I just order and go since parking isn't exactly the greatest during most hours.\n\nI've been into the Honey Lemon Green Tea trend recently, so I obviously got that while I was here in Plentea. I was actually really happy to have ordered it because it's so good! It has the right balance between the honey, tea, and lemon! I think this is sometimes a hard one to make since a little too much lemon will make the whole thing too sour, or a little too much honey would make it too sweet. But Plentea's got it right! I think this is probably be my go-to drink, for now, until I find something even more refreshing.\n\nOverall, definitely worth a visit if you haven't already.

You can also get milk tea with soy milk for those that are lactose or allergic.\n\nHONEY LEMON GREEN TEA - It doesn't have a prominent tea taste, which is what I was hoping for but one good thing was that it's not overly sweet.  A decent honey lemon flavor with a lime squeezed and put on top.  \n\nBOBA - Their boba is on the smaller side but it was chewy, which moved it up to 4 stars.

I went to boba guys the day before and the next day I went to Plentea. \n\nThis place is a bit bigger than the boba guys I've been to and also it has seating. It also had a upstairs seating too which is good for studying. \n\nI'm more drawn to this place because they give jars. I like collecting jar even back in LA. I got the Sea Salt Crema Sweet Crema Tea for $5. I like how there's a separation with the creme and the tea. It wasn't too sweet and it taste like creme with a bit a sweetness. It had oolong tea in it I believe mixed with the creme on top. My boyfriend got a Mango Fresh Fruit Tea for $5, but then they ran out of Mango bits so they were gonna replace it with Honeydew bits. He ended up getting a Honeydrew Fresh Fruit Tea, but he was fine with it. The taste of the tea was overpowering the honeydrew in the drink. The bits were really random which made some pieces stuck to the straw, but that's cause we used a small straw later on. It wasn't sweet at at all. I didn't get to try any boba, but next time I will. \n\nI would come back just for some jars. You also get 15% off two drink when you check in. It cost $10 for two drinks.

Besides, I was just there for that glass jar...I mean, the bubble tea.\n\nI ordered the favorite, an Oolong cream tea and added egg pudding (you can get boba, tapioca or taro pudding too). \n\nThis drink epitomized what I like about most Asian desserts; it wasn't too sweet. The cream float at the top may have been lightly sweetened too, but that could have just been me thinking about how well the flavors worked together. The egg pudding slurped up my straw like a salmon in a fish cannon. \n\nWhen I was paying for it, the price was around $5. I asked her if that was all, and she looked at me quizzically. I told her that if we offered glass jars where I'm from, it'd cost more than that. She said that she thought $5 was too much, but I disagree ;)\n\nBring back your own glass to get re-filled, and you get a discount on your next drink.

This was my first time here so I kinda wanted to play it safe and ended up getting what I usually order at Tpumps, which is peach green tea except I was able to add aloe and tapioca. It was really light, refreshing and I liked how the peach flavor wasn't noticeably syrupy. I also loved the bursts of freshness I'd get from biting into the aloe and fresh peach chunks. They aren't stingy with tapioca so the the boba to tea ratio is good, I ended up having leftover boba once I finished the tea. The tapioca texture could be a little softer though.\n\nMy coworker recommended the brown sugar milk tea with egg pudding and tapioca, but it sounded a little daring to try for my first time. I soon regretted not getting it after trying hers. The milk tea wasn't too sweet at all and the egg pudding was a nice, soft add in. I'll probably be back to get that one.\n\nIt is a pretty pricier than normal boba spots, but like most peeps said the extra is paying for the reusable glass bottle which is pretty neat. $13 sounds a lot for 2 drinks here, but I wouldn't mind having it once in awhile since I'd most likely only get it if I was around the area.

Just a few hours earlier I had One Plus Tea House's version which made it clear how Plentea's quality was far above the many copy cats out there. The tapioca was perfectly cooked and the egg pudding was standard but good. The tea is good, not quite as strong and bitter as boba guys. I asked for 50% sweet and it was the perfect sweetness. \n\n* ICE MILK (BROWN SUGAR) (~$5.50) - 3 STARS:\nI expected the ice milk to be akin to PK or HH but really it left me wanting more. It's not as rich and creamy, and way too sweet (make sure to ask for it 25-50% sweet).\n\n* PEACH FRUIT TEA ($4.95) - 3 STARS:\nTheir fruit teas are merely a black tea with a fruit syrup mixed with fresh cut fruit. The peach tea was way too sweet for my liking.\n\nI enjoyed my black tea crema and the perfectly cooked tapioca balls. Despite the price, I could see myself coming back if I needed an emergency boba mid work day.

Serving boba in a glass bottle is getting people in the door.  Right as 11am hit this morning, the line was already forming and as soon as its door opened, line went out the door.  I know we're in the FiDi and all, but I was quite shock everyone was getting their boba fix so early in the day.  Mind you, they only serve a certain amount of drinks in their glass bottle each day which may be the reason people are flocking here right when they open.  It's a cute bottle to keep but if you bring it back during your next visit, you will get a discount.\n\nDrink menu is quite extensive, they offer a variety of different options aside from just your usual flavored milk teas and green/black fruit teas.  They also have iced milk w/ pudding (brown sugar or caramel) as well as fruit smoothies and fruit milk (strawberry, blueberry, peach, mango, honeydew, avocado, etc.).  They even have a seasonal section for their taro milk, matcha green tea, lavender lemonade, matcha slush, etc,)\n\nGranted they serve these drinks in a glass bottle, but at their price point, you are not getting much drink in return for the cost.  My Brown Sugar Iced Milk w/ Pudding was tasty, but at $4.95 + tax ($5.38 total), one may reconsider.  The drink barely made it back to the office after only a few sips.  It's crazy how even boba made its mark in the FiDi to charge such prices.\n\nI did not see anyone order from the side menu, but they do also offer an array of savory waffle sandwiches and Belgian waffles, along with a few other dessert items.  \n\nPlentea is spacious and there's a good amount of seating both upstairs and down.  However, this is only a good place to stop by if you are in the area or works down in the FiDi.

The teas still hold their real tea flavor while complimented by a sweet flavor. They also have real cut up fruit pieces in the tea. The honey lemon was average, something you can easily make at home. \n\nAlso, I'm sure you all know by now that you get to keep the bottle it's served in and you can bring it in on your next visit for 20% off your next drink.\n\nI'll be back to try other things on the menu like the blueberry milk..

So bad that it drives me to places that I try to avoid, like the Financial District.  Nothing personal, but I left that career path decades ago.

Not my proudest fashion moments, but there you go.  \n\nAnywho, something about getting tea drinks in a reusable bottle speaks to my inner sustainable-life self.  I wish all places did this, because we don't need more landfill, seriously.  I love being able to bring back these bottles and get a discount on my sea salt crema oolong tea.  Even my family are into it with their mango tea with lychee and boba or strawberry tea with boba.

It's giving false hope because some faithful customers might actually come back the next day.\n\nHere's a review of their drinks: The drinks come out within a few minutes no matter how long the line is so that's a huge plus. The bottles are so cute and they come with a cap so you can take it to go as well. \"Sweet milk tea\" is the best description I can give. You can taste the milk, you can taste the tea, and it's very sweet. The toppings are also very sweet but I enjoy the sweetness. If you don't like your milk tea sweet I'm sure you can ask for less sugar. They have very unique flavors and I still have to try a lot of them.

No other tea place can compare to the bottles, minimalistic walls, and (small) upstairs section with a nice loft-style view of the downstairs. The most Instagram-worthy cafe there is out there. It is kind of small though so I assume that it can get crowded at times, but everything else about the shop aesthetics is 5/5.\n\nNow, on to the tea. So I have not tried much from the wide variety of their menu, but when I tried the Fresh Fruit tea (peach), the tea was comparable to my all-time favorite tea shop, Fantasia. The flavor was strong enough and not extremely artificial, so 5/5 on the tea. However, I would say that the tapioca is a little more harder than I wanted but still decently chewy. 4/5 for the pearls only because I am biased to Fantasia's incredibly soft, chewy ones.\n\nSo overall, I would give it around a 4.75/5.

I thought they were.. they resemble them but they are more square-ish shape. Real milk jugs back in the day were circular...but it's okay! I'm still going to use them to drink milk! If you want a plastic cap for your milk jug, it's in the basket on the table where you pick up your jugs. Also, if you bring back your milk jug, make sure it's clean b/c they don't wash it for you! And 10% off your drink for saving the environment?? Yes, yes? I'm hoping that's their initial motive for this milk jug! Haha, or if you don't want a milk jug to begin with, just tell them you want it served in a regular plastic cup and they'll subtract 10% off the expensive price for not buying their milk jug hahahaha \n\nLine seems long because they work slow and the place is short so it goes out the doorway. there are tables on both sides to sit and also an upstairs lounge area (look nice too)!\n\nTaro Milk: THIS IS NOT TARO MILK TEA OKAY? THIS IS NOT TEA. I REPEAT!! This is REAL taro chunks served with MILK only!! No tea in it! Different from the regular use of taro powder with tea. It tastes different but good because it's real taro for once! And it's white... remember... taro is not purple.. it's white... so don't be fooled.. \n\nBlack Milk Tea: very good classic milk tea. cannot go wrong with any of their milk teas! they have black, green, oolong, and one more i forgot.. their honey boba is actually sweet and chewy! i approve :) \n\nCreama Oolong Tea: Delicious and looks flattering for pictures! do not mix your jug! it will start to mix on it's own.. just leave it be :) You can also order it with sea salt, but i personally heard that sea salt makes it too salty.. i'll try it next time but it's yummy the way it is!! :) \n\nPros:\n-cute milk jugs with their name engraved in it.. i finally understand..

Parking is pretty available after 6:30pm.\n+ Nice service: The workers have always been nice, friendly and happy to make any suggestions. Can't ask for much more than that. \n\nCons:\n+ Pricey: Meh, drinks are around $5 which is a little expensive for what it is.

She was nice enough to still let me use my debit card and after the walk I was very appreciative of her letting that slide. The drink itself was quite good! It wasn't too sweet and it hit the spot. The tapioca was good, but it's not the greatest I've had. It came In a very stylish glass bottle that if you bring back to future trips saves you .10\u00a2. I had a good experience overall and will definitely come back to try their other flavors and desserts!", "author": "James R."}

Are you kidding me?\n\nPlentea is a milk tea place on that hipster street nearby Chinatown, and it's an interesting change of pace from the super Chinese milk tea places.\n\nThey subsist almost exclusively on their bottle gimmick. Order a milk tea drink, it comes in a bottle. You finish your bottle, cap it up, and toss it in your backpack and ruin everything. It's fun to do every once in a while, really.\n\nBut in all serious, the drinks are rather unremarkable. Everything tastes slightly watered down, but maybe I haven't been ordering the right things. I think the saving grace for this place are the milk drinks, since they're not half bad, but for the price, I'd really rather go elsewhere. I guess you do get the bottle with it.\n\nCome here if you have to show your friends to Bay Area milk tea. They honestly won't know the difference in terms of quality, since it's not THAT much worse compared to other places, but given the price, it really isn't the best deal you can get for your money. However, they will love the jars that come with it, and basics love jars.\n\nTIP: Sometimes they don't have the jar. Check Yelp for the tips to see if anyone has updated, and if they don't have jars, take your business to somewhere like Boba Guys instead.", "author": "Brian L."}

But the tea was too sweet, and the tapioca pearls really did nothing for me. They were gummy, bland, and entirely undesirable.\n\nFast forward several years to my first excursion to Plentea. I was with a group from work, and figured I would give boba tea one last try. The plan was to try the simple classic (black milk tea with tapioca pearls) and see how it went.\n\nDamn. That's good. \n\nIt's the kind of good that probably now has ruined me for almost all other milk tea I might encounter. But at least I now kind of get it.\n\nBecause more than a sugar bomb, this was about tea first and foremost. Tannic, malty black tea was the dominant flavor. And it was good tea. There was just enough milk and sugar to smooth out the edges. The tapioca balls weren't slimy at all. They were firm and snappy. Chewing on them was a pleasure, and the act of chewing helped to extend the joy of my tea and not diminish it.\n\nSpeaking of joy... it's hard not to be delighted by the visual appeal of this shop and its product. Count me among the many who have been charmed.\n\nGiven the high quality of everything else, I was only dismayed to see they were pouring Kirkland milk from Costco. This is San Francisco. It's Clover country. Get with the program Plentea. \n\nBut with lines out the door, I guess they don't have to change a thing.

My palate is probably not as defined as some others. In my honest opinion, though, I love this place.\n\nThe location is pretty central, the place is very clean and the interior is great. The downstairs is super packed, but if you're looking for a more peaceful place, I recommend going to the top (stair case towards the back left corner of the room). You have some really comfy chairs, and you can see below. \n\nThe boba is tasty and really chewy, while they have great drink options. It might not be quite as expansive as some others big chain boba places, but for me, they are great at what they do. Otherwise, why would they have such a long line all the time?\n\nSpeaking of lines... If you're looking for a quick boba fix, do not expect to get that here. The wait for this place was super long, even in the morning. I arrived around 11:30am, 30 minutes after opening, and the line was out the door already. I think I waited for about 30 minutes minimum to even order a drink. The wait time for my drink was probably about 15 minutes long.\n\nAlthough the line was massive, the reason I really like this place is it has great seacream drinks. It's not as epic as 85 degrees, but it's good. A lot better than what I can normally get (I'm from Sacramento, so we have disappointing or no sea cream for the most part). What's also great is the pricing. I know that an almost $5-$6 boba drink is expensive, but they give you these adorable glass bottle! They are reusable and if you bring them back in, you get a 10% discount on your drink. I think for the higher pricing, it all works out for the bottle. I would repeat visit this place if I lived closer. Most good boba is in the $4-$5 range, but you don't get a souvenir keep sake. This place gives you that, which is well worth the value. The drinks are good enough to keep me coming back, even though it's a huge wait.\n\nI think if they could somehow get through the line quicker, I would bump them to 4 stars.", "author": "Li S."}

In my opinion, anything above $4 for a regular-sized drink (without boba!) is pretty expensive and the drinks here are at least $4.50 on average. I see that they serve their drinks in glass milk bottles, but my friends and I went later in the afternoon, so we didn't get them. I think I could justify paying more for the bottle, but otherwise $5 just for a boba-less drink is far too much.\n\nAnyways, I got peach milk with honey boba. It was pretty meh; I have DEFINITELY had better. I mean it was literally just blended up frozen peaches...with milk. The honey boba was nice, soft, and sweet though. I forget what my friends got, but they seemed to enjoy their drinks. They have a small lounge area upstairs, but there seems to be no air conditioning up there so it was a little stuffy. Service was fine and the drinks came out quickly.\n\nHONESTLY, you should just walk over to Union Square where Boba Guys is, in my opinion.

I'm actually not a big boba fan so can't offer any input on that but I always get lychee jelly in my drinks and this place is up to par. The glass bottles come with a plastic cap so you can seal your drink when you're done with it. They're also very big head-turners. I always get people asking me where I got my drink if I'm walking around FiDi with it. \n\nThey do have some cons though. They have a minimum $10 credit card charge so sometimes I have to buy 2 drinks so I can use my card when I don't have cash (which I guess isn't entirely a bad thing cause I get an excuse to overindulge). Their drinks are also kinda pricey compared to other boba places (albeit you are partially paying for the glass bottle).

For add-ins you get to choose from: taro/egg pudding (my must-have!), tapioca (boba), chia seed (for the health nuts), lychee jelly (fruity peeps), grass jelly (yum), red bean (for the sweeties), and aloe (light jelly/texture).

When the barista was making the drinks I saw her adding whole milk followed by some half and half. She then exchanged a look with the other barista (male) and smirked. The guy then looked at me and my friend, as if he wanted to make sure that we didn't see what they were doing. There weren't any other customers, but I wasn't sure if she was making our drinks so I didn't say anything. After me and my friend tasted our boba we were certain that there is definitely half and half in our drinks. I should've went back and ask her about it but I didn't feel like it. It was very bizarre. I couldn't figure out why she would do that. Did they run out of milk? Was she taking some kind of pleasure in adding half and half into people's drinks? Was she simply trying to make it taste better? Idk. One thing I'm sure tho, is that I am not going back again. It's such a shame, because me and friend really liked this place.", "author": "Tinaa T."}

Plus, if you decide to keep it and bring it back, you get 10% off your drink.\n\nBut, unless you work in FiDi and remember to grab your bottle on the way out, it's highly unlikely you'll be scoring that 10% discount on a regular basis. Unless carrying heavy glass bottles in bags is your makeshift workout. Which seems intriguingly dangerous.\n\nNevertheless, the prices of the drinks here definitely absorb the cost of the branded glass bottles, running you around $4-$5 for your drink and an additional $0.50 per topping.\n\nThat is steep.\n\nI usually get their fresh fruit teas, $4.95, with tapioca for an extra $0.50. They use a fruit pur\u00e9e instead of syrup, which I enjoy, and you can customize the sweetness and ice as with any other chain milk tea store. The pearls are chewy, the tea is smooth, and they use crushed ice--aside from the price, they're doing it right.\n\nPlentea is among plenty of milk tea options in the city.

The other day, I went back with some coworkers and I ordered my usual w/ tapioca, and it was literally the worst boba drink I ever had in my life! a Huge glob of honey that was just sitting on top of the tapioca made the drink rather bitter, as I could not stir it enough to actually mix the drink sufficiently with just my straw. The tapioca balls were hard as rocks, instead of chewy like they were suppose to be. And the drink itself tasted like it was made out of the powdered crap that Quickly uses. For a $7+ drink after tax, it was definitely not worth the premium price. \n\nPros:\n-Clean Store\n-Friendly staff\n-Plenty of indoor seating, including an upstairs balcony\n-Durable, aesthetically pleasing, reusable glass bottles\n\nCons: \n-Difficult parking. There is a parking garage one street down.

Paying $5 to carry around a heavy jar of mediocre boba tea really makes me question whether to kick my own ass or to just recycle the glass jar and call it a day.\n\nI would have tried to do both but I'm not as flexible as I'd like to be so in the meantime, I'm tossing the jar into the recycle bin and will work on my flexibility so I can kick my own ass the next time I let another hipster talk me into drinking boba tea from an establishment where impractical vessel for tea is more important than crafting the taste of the tea itself.", "author": "Taffany H."}

Completely tasteless. Their menu says 'honey flavored boba'. Yeah that's not right. \n\nBeing 100% honest here, the bottles aren't even really free. Their drinks are about $1 more than other spots.

As someone from Taiwan and have had a ton of different bubble teas, Plentea is a great option in SF. I've only had the iced milk green tea so far, but I was really happy with it. Got it with bubbles and less sugar. If you're someone who enjoys a more fragrant tea taste in your drinks then definitely get green tea over black tea. The glasses they use are also super cute and it isn't plastic, so if you bring it back to reuse, you get 10% off. Only complaint I have is its quite pricy for bubble tea.

Creamy and fruity, it makes for a sweet treat that's different from anything I've gotten from any other milk tea place. I can't really speak to any of the other drinks, but all of them sound interesting!\n\nThe decor in Plentea also adds to the experience here. Plants are lined up against the side of the counter and in a corner high up on the wall, and the wood furniture and chalkboard menus make it feel cozy and home-y. Staff is also very friendly!\n\nThe drinks here are pretty pricey, but that also includes the glass jar that you get to keep, which you can bring back for 10% off your drink. But what I wish they did was give that same discount for anyone who doesn't want a keepsake jar and would rather just have their drink in a standard plastic cup. I'd rather have that option than to keep collecting jars, just because visits can be spontaneous, as I don't always plan out my SF outings to include a trip to Plentea.

They serve their drinks on 50's milk bottles and craft their specialty drinks utilizing the glass bottles for their transparency. \n\nThey do milk teas, fruit teas, smoothies and specialty drinks. They also offer some great meals and awesome desserts. It's not a big place but it does have a 2nd level where you can lounge and enjoy your order. Of course there is an up charge.

I ordered the cold taro tea flavor with boba and my girlfriend got the cold Nutella bubble tea without boba. Both of the drinks were pretty good. Definitely would order the Nutella again. I have no idea if this is intentional, but all the bubble tea on the west coast that I have had ends up with a gritty consistency.

I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nI saw my friend post pictures on Instagram about Plentea with the milk like jug bottles and I was like, \"oh myy I have to stop by.\" Little did I know I stopped by the same night after dinner in Japan Town.\n\nIt is on Kearny, a little bit past the financial district and next to Chinatown. Google maps actually got the directions wrong (wanted me to go on the behind street) and I eerily missed it because where Plentea is located, there are no streetlights there and it looks dark as hell. Add to the fact Plentea didn't really looked opened so two clueless idiots drove right by then looked back and said \"ooooh I think that's the place\"\n\nWe ended up parking around the corner and walked there and I was surprised there was no line on a Saturday night. I mean there was clueless idiots standing around debating what to order but it didn't go out the door. Approaching the counter, we ordered the Thai tea with egg pudding, Green Milk tea with Boba and Oolong milk tea. \n\nAfter reading some of the reviews I was concerned I couldn't get the glass bottle especially since it was at night also, and when they called our number, I took a glance and I was so overjoyed. They had the glass bottles available even after a full day of orders on a Saturday. You'd expect them to be out. \n\nHmm maybe that's why they looked closed so they don't have sell to more customers. Just kidding. We took the bottle caps for our three drinks and some straws and headed back to the car. The green milk tea was a delivery for another friend and she said it was good. My friend that ordered the Oolong was very happy with his choice. He claimed it was, \"the best milk tea evarrrrr\" to which he continues with its better than a lot of places he has been too. \n\nCurious I tried mine, as I went for the Thai Tea with egg pudding. First thought was it wasn't overly too sweet and that is a quality I like. You can taste/smell the Thai tea aroma, and it was silky smooth tasting oh so fresh. The egg pudding? Quite wonderful.\n\nAs much as this place makes it to one of my top spots in milk tea spots, I really hope it wasn't just a fluke when I went in that evening and it tasted good. \n\nIt looks like they take all major credit cards but have an outrageous 15 dollar minimum. If you have the glass bottle save it after you're done! You get a 10% discount if you bring back your bottle.\n\nI must try the other flavor drinks and the food.

It comes in a glass bottle with the logo on it - very cool \"green\" way to serve up a beverage.  Unfortunately the tapioca was a little overdone, making the very outside of the boba too soft and the inside overly chewy.  The tea itself was ok but was exceptionally sweet.  Since the sign near the register said to tell them about any drink that isn't perfect, thankfully my friend took the bottle out of my hand and told them it was too sweet (I was thankful that she was so bold).  It came back with more tea in it and much better.\n\nShop: Cool shop with places to sit.  Clean and trendy, steps above the old boba tea shops from a decade ago.  Nothing incredibly special about it though.\n\nOverall:  With just 3 visits to Plentea and Boba Guys, I have to say Boba Guys has this place beat.

My drink was $4.50 which is pretty pricy for milk tea but I'm sure I paid for the jar more than the tea. \n\nThey don't accept credit card transactions less than $15 so bring money!

Yeah well that's not true). That one is definitely a winner! Great tea flavor, not too sweet, and real strawberry bits contained within. \n\nThe turkey club waffle sandwich was bland. No taste to the waffle, I tasted more avocado than pesto, and correct me if I'm wrong but I thought clubs had bacon? And for a waffle sandwich, this thing tasted healthy.

If it weren't so expensive it would be 5 stars!\n\n-----\n\nWe first came upon Plentea when we were down the street at Sushirrito and spotted all these people with glass bottles of tea in their hands. Curious, we went to investigate and soon spotted a long line of people going out the door waiting for their tea (a very common occurrence as it appears in boba-crazed SF). Since we've been to our share of disappointing boba places in SF (T-pumps, I'm looking at you), we had really high expectations going into Plentea. However, after two visits, I think it has passed my litmus test!\n\nTHE TEA: Plentea's tea is actually really tasty. I've tasted all three of their main selections so far (black, green, oolong), and each possesses the delightful fragrant aftertaste lacking in many mainstream boba places. This definitely gets a pass from me.\n\nTHE BOBA: This is waaay harder to get right than the tea, and several great boba places have been undermined by their poor quality boba (Tenren is a great example of good tea but bad boba). Plentea's boba is perfectly chewy and really tasty (probably because it is drenched in honey, haha). Combined with the tea = killer combo.\n\nPRICE/PRESENTATION: This is my major gripe about Plentea and the reason why it's really only 4/5 stars. They are simply too expensive. Case in point - I got a honey lemon green tea with boba and ended up paying $5.44 - at Teaway, this would be in the neighborhood of $2.20. Yes, I understand you're giving away a glass bottle with purchase, but that doesn't mean you can jack up the prices to almost 100% extra! Also, the glass bottles are smaller than the normal plastic cups, so they're reaping even more profit. If it weren't for the fact that the tea+boba is so good, this would essentially be a naked money grab. However, kudos for Plentea for being so creative and thinking of this gimmick that is so successful with customers.\n\nBottom line, great tea+boba that comes in a glass bottle. Genius move on marketing, and combined with the quality product I can see them continuing to be a very successful business.\n\n(Here's what I've tried so far -- all have been excellent:\n\nPeach black tea\nOolong tea crema\nHoney lemon green tea)\n\nps.

But that is probably the only reason why I came here. The drinks offered here are by no means bad though! All the drinks I've tried here were delicious. (If I remember correctly, I've tried the peach black tea, lavendar lemonade, and the sea salt crema). The drinks were also very photogenic? Each bottle deserves a picture!\n\nBut it's not worth the 4$+ that I had paid for it, maybe it was the first time just for experience sake. Bringing the bottle back for that discount doesn't really make it any more worth it. You can save maybe 50 cents? Because this is on the pricier side, and I personally think there are good alternatives at a cheaper price elsewhere in the city, waiting in line for this place is not worth it after two or three visits. One time I came and there was absolutely no line, but right after I went in, a line suddenly formed and it was out the door! Maybe you just have to get the timing right. I've also gotten the bottle for all 3 times I was here, again it's all about the timing. It is a good place to take friends who are in the city for the first time though because it is a pretty cool place, they can even get a bottle as a souvenir.\n\nThe atmosphere upstairs wasn't bad though! It wasn't paticularly crowded one time I was there. Upstairs was a nice place to sit down and chat with friends (and also maybe a place to look down on how ridiculous the line can get).\n\nThe waffle sandwiches here look phenomenal though!

Really?! \n \n*No bathroom... (not all places in the financial district or downtown area have one, get over it! Go to Starbucks!) \n\n*Limited options or adjustments to the menu...( they've only been open 5 days!!! The people who work there are only getting acquainted with the amount of items they have on the menu. It takes a few times to get it down. How do I know? Because I'm a chef! Repetition is the key, not to mention the owner is still trying to get feedback about his products. I spoke to him tonight, i told him the smoked salmon waffle was good but the salmon was a little too salty since the slices are big.) \n\n*Steep pricing... $6.50 for a pint (2 cups exactly, yeah I weighed the shit out with a measuring cup) of milk tea is not bad when you're smack dab in the middle of downtown. The bottle costs $4 retail by itself, which means the cost of your tea is about $2.50 including tax besides that it's all about the location. You want something cheap go to China town or the Sunset. \n\nI usually don't like reading comments nor ratings because a lot of you guys are so subjective. It's annoying as hell! But anyhow I'm giving this place 5 stars. Great location and good hours (finally good boba around downtown and open till 12am), flavors are spot on and well balanced (I've had 4), lovely interior and straight forward menu (better because it doesn't confuse the consumer plus too many options gets overwhelming e.g t pumps/teaway), Waffle options are fun and the waffle itself was perfect in texture and sweetness (Had smoke salmon, it was nice the owner wanted to give you more  but it gets to salty because of thickness. He took note of it and graciously thank me for telling him what my thoughts were). STAFF was very warm and friendly. Hope I gave the owner some justice. It's a cool concept no doubt! My pastry team's guilty pleasure.... \n\nFlavors I've had:\nBrown Sugar- taste like maple... Perfect amount of sweetness for using brown sugar. For that person who was complaining about how it taste like sugar milk, guess what it is! That's why it's called FLAVORED ICE MILK!!!\nOolong Tea with Strawberries/Green Tea with Peaches- not too bitter and too light.

The only thing really keeping this store going is the fact that it comes in a Plentea glass milk bottle. Taking away the bottle, the actual drink is most definitely not worth the $5 + dollars that they charge here.\n\nLike any modern day boba connoisseur, I like to judge a store based on the classic black milk tea with boba. I ordered a black milk tea with boba and a fresh milk with pudding drink. And both were equally disappointing. The milk tea was bland with little black tea flavor. It was very diluted. However, the actual boba was okay, but not anything special. The fresh milk with pudding sounded amazing and unique. However, the drink was overwhelmingly sweet with an underwhelming flavor. So much so, my friend and I made it a third of the way through before tossing it. The pudding made the drink look tasty, but that's just it, it was only contributed to the aesthetics. \n\nOn top of the overly hyped drinks, I found a tiny shard of glass as I was beginning to reach the bottom of the milk tea.

I have only had it twice but before I even got it the first time, I tried waiting twice before I gave up because my lunchtime was over. The first and second time, I waited in line for approx ten minutes with only one person in front of me and two to three people waiting for their drinks and both times, they didn't even take my order within ten minutes so I had to leave. Finally the third time there was no line and I went in to grab a drink only for them to say there was no bottles... I ordered a strawberry tea and it was so sweet that I would rather have gotten a strawberry soda... Cheaper and I would know what I was expecting from it.\n\nUpdate: since I obviously wasn't thinking straight, I gave them one last chance and I was unsurprisingly unhappy with my order.

In fact, I think Plentea might have been inspired by Boba Guys' Boba in a mason jar idea and low and behold, the Boba in the Bottle was invented! \n\nI was in the Chinatown area on Wednesday, 04/30 and desperately wanted to try Plentea so I begged my boyfriend to go with me. It was almost 90 degrees, my boyfriend was grumpy, hot and Yelp directions were leading us everywhere, so I knew that the only thing that could alleviate this situation was a nice cold glass on boba. When we finally got to Plentea, we were told by some guy on their second floor balcony that they were closed and that their grand opening is tomorrow, which I found odd because the store was open, pretty much looked ready to go, and there were 5 Yelp reviews raving about their boba. Disappointed, we took our business to Ten Ren a couple blocks up from Plentea.\n\nA day after their grand opening, my sister and I went to try their boba. If you plan on driving, then I wish you the best of luck because it is almost impossible to get parking near Plentea. Luckily, there is a parking garage nearby and public transportation is always available! This time, the shop was open and they were actually ready for our business! We ordered the Crema Tea with boba and the Iced Milk Oolong Tea with boba.\n\nIced Milk Oolong Tea with boba - Absolutely delicious! I say this a lot, but this could quite possibly the the best boba in SF. I like my milk tea creamy and smooth + strong tea is my favorite and Plentea does exactly that! The boba is chewy, yet very soft and actually reminds me of Fantasia's boba. It's not Asha's milk tea, but it's very close!\n\nCrema Milk Tea with boba - I honestly couldn't taste the difference except the Crema was a bit creamier than the Iced Milk Tea. Overall, it was a nice drink to have if you want a creamier consistency milk tea.\n\nThe total was around $11 and yes, it was pricy, but worth it!

It took my friend and I about 20 minutes to get to the front to place our order.  While in line, a representative from Kash, a new app designed to skip over transaction processing fees for retailers (while rewarding points to customers who use it), told us that we could get $10 off our order if we paid with it.  Heads up, y'all!  There must have been a huge catering order right before us, because I saw one of the Plentea employees wheeling out crates of drinks.  Next thing I know, the cashier calls out our order number and tells me that... they've run out of boba.  You what?!  The cashier was really apologetic, asked us if we wanted to just substitute something else or get our order refunded altogether.  Though my friend and I wanted boba, we opted for new add-ins.  I went for taro pudding for my taro milk tea, and my friend went with aloe for her honeydew black tea.  Oh, the sadness, though!\n\nI am really grateful that they use real taro and real honeydew for their drinks, but I will probably never order the taro milk tea again.  Yes, the cashier warned me that it was milk tea with taro mixed into it, but I didn't realize that the taro would be so gritty.  That, plus the stickiness of the milk... not a very refreshing drink.  Oh well.  Live and learn.  My friend liked her honeydew black tea, but said that it was too sweet.  If you actually like to taste the richness of the tea, adjust your sweetness level.  \n\n7:30 PM - After grabbing dinner at Bun Mee, two of my girl friends and I headed over to Plentea.  I was a little wary after my experience earlier in the day, but when we got there, there were only a few other people in line ahead of us, and they had boba again!  Praise the Lord!  I went with their peach black tea with boba, and my friends got the sea salt crema with boba, and the peach oolong tea with lychee jelly.\n\nThe way their fresh fruit tea drinks work is that they're basically whatever tea you choose (black, green, or oolong), with minced pieces of your choice of fruit (mango, peach, honeydew, etc.).  The fruit flavor really isn't fully infused into the drink in the way that you might get from a syrup or powder, but then again, you get the benefit of knowing you've got fresh fruit in there.  The peaches were not ripe, though, so the bits and pieces were crunchy and super tart.  You win some, you lose some, I guess.  Between my black tea base, and one of my friends' oolong tea base, I'd probably try and go with the oolong, or maybe even green, next time.  The black tea almost overpowered the peach flavor, while the oolong nicely complimented it.  As for the sea salt crema... blech.  I've never been on that bandwagon, though, so take my comment with a grain of, er, salt...\n\nStill love the glasses here!

The first time I asked if they had fruit milk tea, they said no and that was the end of the conversation. So I ordered a blueberry milk with honey tapioca. I could pass on the tapioca, the blueberry milk was what you think blueberry milk should taste like. It is actually whole milk with blueberries.\n\nThe second time around I asked if they could add milk to their fruit tea. It took a while to get a definitive response, because that would involve going against the menu and being a little creative *gasp* I was told that they don't do fruit milk teas because they don't want to mix too many things together and flavors might not mix well, etc. However, they graciously decided to experiment for me and made what I requested: Strawberry Oolong Milk Tea w/ Egg Pudding (they ran out of grass jelly).

The other times I came by ... the lines were so long and ridiculous during the 2pm post-lunch time where the line was out the door and atleast 10 deep on the sidewalk. That is at least a 30 minute wait since it took a little more than 30 minutes last time I was successful when the line got to the door. \n\nAnyways. 2? yeah 2 ... that disappointed.\n-1 = price is a downer here. Yes, they give you a re-usable bottle and they give you 20% off when you bring it back. Great marketing technique to bring customers back ... but it should be an option to buy a glass bottle for those who want one and offer regular plastic / compostable cups if you wanna go \"green\"\n\n- 2 = the wait / line. There HAS to be a better way to regulate the wait and/or the line. You gotta have a better system in terms of when the customer walks in, orders, get the drinks made, then get them out. I hate comparing but,  check out Sharetea. They get your order, make it, then in 5 minute, I get my drink. \n\nLast the taste - the boba is actually GOOD and sweet. so if you want your milk tea not too sweet, order it LESS LESS sweet because the boba will actually sweeten your milk tea already. I had no idea my first time, and it was too sweet for me. \n\nI'd love to come back and give you another try Plentea (and to use my bottle) but every time I come no matter what time it is, the wait and the line is too long and AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT.", "author": "Kenny L."}

I'll have to come back again and see if they fill it the same way next time and inquire as to why it's less than others. I feel like I'm being skimped out on my drink. Oh, and people, in the milk drink...there is NO TEA. So people don't get confused. If you look at the menu it just says milk. When I asked for green tea she said that there isn't any. The girl at the register today though, she needs to be a little more outspoken, cheerful and nice. She was none of those. Soft spoken and can barely here her. You're the cashier and face of the place.\n\n\nTime: 11:14pm. Just tried the mango oolong tea with lychee jelly. SUPER DUPER SWEET! I don't know how anyone can drink something with that much sugar?!

But in the end, that's where the obsession stops. The milk tea itself is decent, the boba soft, and the bottle super cool. The menu is pretty limited, but that's not always a bad thing if it's executed well. We ordered the Coffmilk Tea and the Green Milk Tea. The coffmilk is just a coffee milk tea, with good coffee flavor. The green milk tea was decently strong in tea flavor. I just wasn't wowed by the flavor profile with either drink. I probably should have been more adventurous and gone for the sea salt crema tea or coffee, but I don't get to drink SF grade boba very often anymore, so I have to get my fill when I can. There's a yelp discount which was helpful, but I honestly hate places that charge for toppings. It just feels very stingy and the original prices really aren't cheap.

We were so excited to come here after a long day in Japan Town for the bottles and the drinks. I recommended this place to the others because my first experience here was good. When we arrived we asked whether they ran out of bottles and the cashier rudely told us that they're getting a new shipment and they won't have anymore for two weeks. It's an understandable situation, but did she have to explain it so surly? Geez. I just asked a simple question. She was rude to the rest of our party and then had somebody else man the cashier because maybe she couldn't handle being one anymore??? \n\nAnyway, the prices for the drinks are pretty expensive, but I don't mind since the bottle comes with it. And when they run out of bottles don't worry--you get a whole 10% off!!!1 That amounts to a whole $1.64 off a 3-drink $16+ purchase. The toppings cost 50 cents extra as they do in most places, but I should've been paying 5 cents for the 10 pieces of lychee jelly that they oh so generously gave me. The drink wasn't bad, but the cashier kind of ruined our experience with her whole \"charm.\" \n\nTL;DR: The cashier had a bitter attitude and the drinks weren't worth the price.", "author": "Megan C."}

Not gonna lie, that was probably the reason why I was attracted to this place after seeing pictures and reviews on yelp while visiting the bay area.  Located in the busy downtown of union square, you'd think that people wouldn't want to carry around a heavy glass of boba, but boy was I wrong! Even at 3pm, the lines were long, and I had to wait around 15 minutes before ordering.\n\nThey seem to sell not only bobas, but just regular tea (Plentea...hehe.) and some other yummy bites like waffles. I just went for the greentea milk tea with tapioca. \n\n-Greentea Milktea: I expected some kind of green colored drink in a bottle, but what I got was a coffee colored drink. Confused as heck, I took a sip to find out it truly was a green tea milk tea. I guess I was so used to the powder matcha flavored that I didn't expect the tea to taste actually, like greentea (which I appreciated)\n\nFor that I would give it a 4 star. Truthfully if it tasted like the regular artificial matcha greentea, I probably would have given it 3 star. But for sticking true to the flavors of the tea, I can appreciate it. :) Only downside is that it's quite pricey. $5+ for boba? \n\nYou can bring back your bottle and get 10% off next time. Again, didn't think people would actually bring back used bottles since it's located in such busy financial district area, but I saw a lot of business employees in line during their break to grab some delicious boba. Good for you plentea!\n\nTL;DR: Boba in glass bottle, kinda cool concept, expect lines, actual tea flavors, pricey 5+, cool if you're a tourist.", "author": "Tina Y."}

Since all the milk teas were pre-made, drinks were ready by the time you finished paying at the register. You could even see the storage containers holding all the pre-made milk teas behind the counter and the staff simply pouring them into the glass bottles.\n\nThe black iced milk tea tasted exactly what you'd expect from pre-made milk tea. The tea flavor was barely noticeable, and the drink tasted overall watered-down. I'll give Plentea credit for not serving diabetes in a bottle though like other shops.\n\nThe glass bottles are branded with the store name, and they're an interesting novelty in the plastic cup-domnated bubble drink scene. They're far from making up for the hefty price tag of drinks here though. The 10% discount for bringing your bottle back is hardly worth it either, as you'll still pay at least $5.00 for your drink. I'll be using my bottle to hold all my drawing pencils.\n\nI'm happy to have finally tried a boba shop everyone's been talking about, but I won't be going back.

It's mostly metered but make sure you read the signs about parking times because they WILL tow your car if you're not careful. But there is a parking garage right around the corner if you're into that kind of stuff. The line can get long, so if you have some where to be make sure that you plan out enough time.

However after the hype of the jar wore off, I was actually disappointed by the milk tea. It didn't taste enough like tea and was pretty plain. Quality was mediocre. It wasn't sweet enough or had enough tea flavor. I also tried the brown sugar iced milk which was def better in quality than the milk tea so would recommend that over the milk tea. It was thicker but had much more flavor. \n\nWouldn't recommended this place for the milk tea but would recommend if you want a pretty jar.", "author": "Tiffany S."}

I think it's time to purchase another cash register, how bout it? (I hate it even more when it's during school downtimes such as summer, holidays and what not because the lines would get even crazier). When I left the place, the line went out, turned and completely blocked baladie cafe.\n\nThey even added credit card minimum of $15 which I thought wasn't a very good idea considering their location in the FiDi district barely touching Chinatown. Their customer base are a bunch of office workers, and many can tell you they don't walk around with cash on hand; everyone in the area just swipes a credit card so adding this minimum was a huge disappointment.\n\nYes they are special that they have their own glass bottles but then... they only limit 200 bottles a day when they first opened until July, then they made it unlimited BUT then changed the bottles to have a bigger opening and only provided the bigger caps which no longer fit with the original bottles (and then they switched back to 200 bottles a day yet again). Initially glass bottles were great for customer retention but then it's like a slap in the face when they changed the bottles and the caps. So...what about the old customers? Are they no longer important? Now they have to dish out more money (as pricey as it already is) on another glass bottle. For those who like to collect these bottles as it's a trend, great for you but some of us don't really want another bottle.\n\nI've been there several times and always get their flavored tea's, mango, strawberry, and peach and they've all been great and all but all of that comes after the experience at the business and sadly in my opinion (and I say my opinion), I don't think it's enough to make up for the bad experiences leading up to the drink itself.

Rest assured, you'll get your average milk tea in a nice glass bottle in the afternoon if you choose to. If you're like the new customer I saw at the counter today who was shocked that you needed to pay more than $5 for a bottle of tea, then you can opt for the discounted drinks in the plastic cup. But let's face it, why are you waiting in such a long line if you're not getting the glass bottle?\n\nI tried the sea salt crema everyone raves about. Personally didn't think it was mind boggling. The tea flavor was lacking, covered by the cream. I prefer the classic black milk tea and less sweet. They have 25%, 50%, 75% sweet options so the mild sweet tooth can be satisfied. \n\nI stay true to my original review. I give them 2 stars for the average milk teas and nice chewy bobas with a nice bottle. Originally I was going to give this 3 star with the glass bottles there all the time but after trying the other drinks, it's truly a 2-star \"meh. I've experienced better\" rating. \n\nIf you are in a hurry, don't even bother coming. The line is almost always out the door. Sure it might be a short looking line but the wait is unexpectedly longer than you'd anticipate. If you're coming out of town just to try this, lower your expectations, have plans to stand in line with a friend who is fun and can keep you entertained, be prepared to pay about $5+ for a milk tea, and you'll be fine. I, for one, cannot justify standing in line for an overpriced milk tea during my lunch hour. On the rare occasions when I get off work early, I'll stop by again.\n\nBy the way, I think it was my first time seeing a cashier drink boba milk tea in the middle of taking an order. She had to hurriedly chew through the boba, covered her mouth before she could reply to the customer's questions. I'm all for drinking water on the job, that's fine and totally normal, but the quick chewing and attempting to speak that was quite a bit to watch.", "author": "Shirlene K."}

My friend got the strawberry one with oolong and the fresh fruit (mango) one.\n\nPeach - it tasted watered down and there were little Apple bits in the tea. I didn't taste any peachiness and it tasted really watered down! Cost 4.95 with Boba, which is extra 50 cents.\n\nMango - this is the most expensive at 6.50. We got one and it tasted like ice cream and couldn't even taste the mango. There was another fresh fruit drink with milk and that is.exactly how ours tasted like! With milk. So We asked them to make a new one. And while they were finally making it (after they made EVERYONE'S ORDER - they waited till there were NO MORE CUSTOMERS to start making it), we noticed they added MILK to our FRUIT ONLY drink! What the Heck!? When confronted, they said they always add milk to the drink.. I don't get it. I paid 6.50 for a 4,95 drink. We did not argue with them and just took it. At least it had more mangoness this time....\n\nStrawberry - this one tasted much better! I only had 2 sips, but tasted pretty good and sweet. Had bits of strawberry too. Why didn't mine have buts of peach instead of apple!? \n\nLastly... the \"honey\" boba was not sweet at all! I've had better making them. It was kind of hard and not as chewy.. must've been sitting there for a while because after the remake mango, that Bob's was softer and warm..\n\nSpent $13.54 for 2 drinks which tasted bad.

But the pathway is tapered off by a rail from the door to about 4 feet from the cash wrap, so it gets really crammed and awkward when you order and then get out of the way for the next person to order, but the pick up station is on the other side of the counter, so you have to nudge and mumble apologies to make your way to your drink then cross back over to get a seat so you can sit and enjoy your drink. Then when you're ready to go, disrupt more people to get around the rail and out the door. \n\nThe drinks are tasty, but they take for-eh-vurrrrr (sandlot impersonation). I get they're new, probably had to hire more people because of how popular they got, so that means more training... But geez. \n\nPoints for trend. Points for glass bottles.

There were \"Plentea\" of high school students lined up for milk tea. The line was out the door which equated to a 45 minute wait. The place exudes a nice hip vibe. There is an upstairs for lounging and they serve waffles in addition to milk tea.\n\nWhen we finally reached the line, I ordered a Oolong Tea Crema and my friend got a Black Milk Tea. It took a while to get our drinks after we ordered. We received our teas in nice tall glass containers that we get to take home. If you bring it back you can receive a discount on your next visit. After trying my tea, something was off. I wasn't able to immediately put my finger on it. I tried my friend's tea and it was 10x better. I took another sip at mine. By the time I got half way through I realized that my drink was not cold enough. It was about the temperature of tap water. I figured that they don't put ice in the Oolong Tea Crema, but after looking around and at yelp photos, all the drinks have ice. Well, except mine. The tea was a little weak and it wasn't too sweet either. The boba here was really soggy and didn't have a good bite to it.\n\nI like the concept of the place, but no ice, no flavor and over cooked boba is not impressive. To be fair though, my friend's black milk tea was decent. I would still not pay $5 dollars for it. Their small kitchen looks way to cramped for the amount of people back there. I think once they figure out how to be efficient with their space and staff the wait time should improve and their drinks will be more consistent.

It is overhyped and overpriced for its \"glass jars\" I have been here a few times and got around to try both their milk teas/teas (fruit tea, yogurt fruit tea, sea salt crema) and I must say they are pretty inconsistent and tastes pretty watered down half of the time. I do like their concept of 1. choose your fruit flavor (they even give you fruit bits!) 2. choose your type of tea 3. choose any toppings you desire. Their tea drinks are better than their milk teas though!! You can actually taste the tea flavor but it is not really that strong. My favorites are probably their newly additional yogurt fruit teas especially the passionfruit or peach. Their other newly additional milk drinks tastes more just like sugared milk so I would definitely not recommend it and their sea salt crema tastes extremely sweet (even after adjusting the sweetness level). Oh, you can definitely adjust your sweetness level here and you should!! Well, unless you have a super big sweet tooth. I always get my teas/milk teas at 50% sweetness. \n\n It is a great hang out spot since they have an upstairs with a couple of tables and a couple of tables downstairs as well. Plentea is pretty crazy during lunch time with all the FiDi people so you should definitely get there before 12p-1p or maybe come after 2p. You do get 10% off if you bring your bottle back but since drinks alone are already around $5 ($6 with toppings) so you don't really save much.", "author": "Shanna C."}

But what I didn't account for were two things - 1) the possibility that they would run out of glass bottles at a certain time and 2) that the tea might not be that good. Now, I'm from SGV so...I'm pretty used to decent milk tea and boba. I roll in at maybe 8/9pm and I note that there aren't any more glass bottles. Well, whatever, might as well try the hype. So I ordered the matcha milk tea because I figure matcha milk might be pretty good. But nope - the matcha flavor is pretty much nonexistent and the milk tea is more milk than tea. Oh, and as other yelpers have noted, the price is the same no matter if you get the bottle or not (to which I call bs).\n\nSo yeah, I would say Plentea is...not the business.

It's rare to find any milk tea place in FiDi, so I was pleased to find that the drink quality here is pretty good.\n\nIt is rather pricey, but I guess everything downtown is. There is an extremely long line, but I guess everything downtown has one. I am knocking a star for two recently implemented policies:\n\n1) Minimum credit card purchase of $15. This is just unreasonable for a place in the heart of the Financial District whose menu consists mostly of items around $5. How many people are going to wait in that long line only to get to the front and realize they can't pay for the drinks they just ordered? At least give the option of using credit card if we pay a transaction fee.\n\n2) Only 400 bottles given out per day (200 in the morning, 200 starting at 6PM). Considering that the bottles are one of their main marketing schemes, it's highly disappointing to arrive after they've reached their daily maximum.\n\nTip: Order your drink with less ice.

I wonder how many of Plentea's customers have said that.  Plentea offered much more of a selection than Boba Guys, for example, but I thought their boba was so-so.  I had the milk tea with lychee.  My boyfriend had unsweetened coffee with boba.  He said his was not flavorful.  My biggest complaint, being someone who doesn't intend to return given that I am hardly ever in the area of a Plentea, was that we were served our drinks in glass bottles with the Plentea logo.  This is a cute concept and great for returning customers, but for me, it was kind of a burden.  I'm sure the aim is environmental, but I would rather be charged less and get a plastic compostable cup (assuming the glass bottles cost more than those cups).  I am aware I have a slight hoarding problem for things like this.  I asked myself, \"Would I ever have the need for a glass bottle?  It wouldn't fit snugly in my car cup holder, and I don't know how tightly the free bottle covers are that Plentea provides, so would I ever want to use it?  It's also not very comfortable to hold, with no handle and direct contact with the cold drink...\"  Needless to say, I carried that bottle all the way to the Ferry Building with me, when I came to the realization (as did the rest of my group, one of whom had a Plentea bottle at his condo), that I would never, ever use this thing and it wasn't worth carrying around all day.  I tossed it, annoyed that I had carried it around while I walked, only to decide to throw it away.  And all for an okay serving of milk tea.", "author": "Christina G."}

The last time I remember having to line up for so long was during the peak of T Pumps in San Mateo. The store is located in a small building, with a second floor balcony overlooking half the store. It looks as if it had a little renovation done to it, giving it a more modern appearance with it's newly done flooring and bright digital menus. There were many choices of teas and toppings including Tapioca, which they said is honey flavored but I couldn't tell. If you were feeling like a snack the menu also had food and desserts to compliment your drink.\n\nThe drinks were served almost to the brim in the the milk bottles and definitely got 5 stars in terms of presentation. But, as bubble tea lovers know, it's the drink that really matters and unfortunately, this is where it goes downhill. We had ordered two fresh fruit drinks, and to their credit, they did have pieces of fruit floating in the bottle. They were not filled with too much ice, it felt just enough to keep the drink cold all the way to the end, a very big plus for me as I usually get less ice. The drinks were very sweet, and I think in all the excitement to try a new place, we had forgot to ask to change the sugar level -although it would've been nice to be asked while we were ordering. The tea barely stood out through the onslaught of sugar, and the supposed honey boba tasted like ordinary tapioca; nothing special at all. The egg pudding was pretty good and on point, but didn't stand out in any way. \n\nOverall, I was kind of disappointed with the drink. I felt like something in an awesome bottle should have been more memorable but the whole time it was just mediocre. I think at $5 a drink, not including toppings, it has some room to improve.", "author": "Yang L."}

The name initially threw me off, but as soon as my friends and I stepped inside, a smile crept upon my face.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is that the drinks are served in a fancy schmancy glass bottle. It's tall and awesome, and there are lids in the front where you order so you can cap it if you're unable to finish your drink (which is very unlikely).\n\nTheir drink selection isn't huge, but it's sure to please everyone who steps in through the door. I opted for the normal milk tea (black). The wait wasn't short, but my friends and I went upstairs to the 2nd floor to chill. Other people were situated up there and it had such a nice, buzzing atmosphere. Everyone seemed friendly and happy, some were also studying.\n\nThe drinks tasted great - not too sweet. Like I said, I paid a lot more for worse boba.\n\nThe cool glass containers, open hours and quaint atmosphere makes me regret that this visit was not going to be routine.

As expected there was a line of tweens out the door for the new boba spot but luckily the long moved at an even pace. I just went for the green milk tea with less boba though the fresh fruit drinks were enticing. The green milk tea was satisfying and actually tasted tea-like. I ordered less boba (I don't like the usual amount people add) and was happy to see the amount I was hoping for. My friend ordered the sea salt oolong tea which I wasn't a fan of, but some may like the flavor. The combination of sea salt with the oolong and milk wasn't right for my palate. \n\nDrinks also come in a Plentea branded glass bottle that's yours to keep. You can bring it back in for 20% off your next drink, but I'd prefer that they simply have a deposit that they refund upon return of the bottle like Juice Shop and etc. \n\nOverall I'd say Plentea is worth a try but not in the afternoon with the after school crowd.

I finish up at 6pm, so I always get here right when they get their deliveries for their fancy glass bottles. I have never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes, though for my first two visits, using card was fine - note that there is now a $15 minimum to charge, so be aware of this before stopping by.\n\nThe tea itself is all right. Over the last couple of weeks I had a plain milk tea with boba, a matcha slush, a lavender lemonade, and the brown sugar ice milk with taro pudding. Everything was generally okay except for the matcha slush as it didn't really taste like anything but ice, and it was really difficult to drink out of a glass bottle. Nothing really stood out to me in terms of taste - it is pretty much your run-of-the-mill tea, but dressed cuter. This would be the ultimate gift to give to someone when you're running late or want to leave a good impression on someone's mind - few things are more special than giving someone boba in a capped glass bottle and a smile.\n\nThe service itself isn't all that spectacular, I admit. Much of the time they seem flustered or aren't particularly pleased about giving customers more information about a drink or how to order. I imagine that on a bad day, this is not what you want to deal with - if you want a better drink with the same lackluster service, skip the fancy bottle and head over to pretty much anywhere else in the Inner Richmond, Sunset, etc. This may be the outskirts of Chinatown, but it's basically like you're in FiDi, which I think really makes for a better picture of this place.\n\nOverall, it's not bad. You get a discount for bringing the bottle back (which you will probably want, because even if you get two cups of tea/etc. beverage, it's probably not enough for that $15 minimum charge...considering that it's $5-6 a drink).

The bottle is a clever idea and definitely innovated to make me want to collect more (even though the purpose to come back and reuse the bottle to get a discount on your next drink... Nope. It's added to my bottles to put my juices to go)\n\nThe three star is for service and well getting our other drink wrong. My bf ordered their mango smoothie, with promises of using fresh ingredients. It took a loooooong time to get our drinks. And on top of that, if we weren't staring at the counter for our drinks, then seriously we would have not known our drinks was ready bc they never called our number or name or our drinks. Crunched on time, we grabbed and left bc we had places to go. Got in the car and then we realized, as wonderful as my drink was, my bf ended up with honeydew instead of mango and you would think... Wouldn't you notice the color? Yeah well when you're in a rush you don't notice a lot. Hopefully a wrong will be righted the next time we visit...

Honestly, I only go here for the cool looking glass bottles that I can re-use. My first time here was a pretty good experience, but my second time here I found a really sharp small piece of plastic in my drink. There was no way I could have gotten it inside my drink either because it was sealed and I had nothing plastic near me whatsoever. It's a good thing that I caught it before I swallowed it because it was pretty damn sharp lol. I brought it up to the cashier and he didn't really do much other than apologize, didn't offer to replace it or anything. \n\nIt's an alright place to go to if you're looking for a joint to sit at while you eat Sushiritto and if you want cool looking glass bottles.

The price of the drinks range from $4.25-$4.95. If you want toppings, it's another 50 cents. \n\nI ordered the Iced Oolong Milk Tea with honey tapioca. The tapioca was bland... just chewing on soft, chewy dough. However, I liked the milk tea.\n\nI also ordered the Strawberry Fresh Fruit Milk. I expected this drink to be sweet but it's very subtle. Some might call it bland but for the ones who likes it less sweet... you might like this. Besides strawberry flavor, there's many other flavors to choose from including avocado, honeydew, and papaya! Flavors you don't see everywhere.\n\nPer drink rounds to be $5. It is overpriced, and I can do without the glass bottle even if I get 10% off my next drink.

If not for the drinks themselves then for the ability to talk about said drinks afterwards.\n\nThe single defining characteristic of Plentea is the cute milk bottle they hand out with every drink. (I think I've accumulated four by now....) It's quite eco-friendly, and you have the added benefit of bringing back your bottle for a discount. (10 whole freakin' percent.) Although the general problem I've noticed is, I don't decide ahead of time whether or not I want Plentea, and by the time I pass it and decide that I do want something to drink... well, there's another bottle for me.\n\nThe drinks themselves are definitely solid, but not mind-blowing. I've had their regular black milk tea, jasmine green milk tea, and sea salt crema with oolong tea. I always leave satisfied with the taste of my tea, but as I mentioned earlier, the tea tastes the same as any other decently upstanding milk tea shop. At $4.50 a bottle for milk tea and $4.95 for crema, I would also be perfectly happy going to Sharetea, for example, and getting an equally good milk tea for $3.50 and creama for $4.25. \n\nGiving Plentea 3 stars for decent yet overpriced milk tea.", "author": "Dale W."}

The cost of drinks are a bit pricier, but it's just like any other milk tea spot since you're paying for the cost of the bottle in the price. \n\nMy drink was not sweet enough for me. Maybe it's because of the green tea but the pearls didn't help either (though they were the right amount of chewy). My boyfriend's honeydew drink was interesting though. There were pieces of honeydew in them!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-18", "description": "Was home in the Bay Area for July 4th weekend, and I saw all these AWESOME bottles on Instagram, so I was like I NEED THIS. Rounded up 4 other friends, so that we could carpool to SF just to try this new place, as well as get the bottle.  I read one of the earlier reviews, saying they arrived just before they opened since there is a limited supply of bottle to get one, and originally that was the goal, but two of my friends had a slight time conflict, and we ended up showing up around 12:45.  The whole way there I was actually semi-stressed because it's about a 40 minute drive from where I live, so I was like WHAT IF WE DROVE ALL THIS WAY AND WE GET NO BOTTLES. But, praise the lord, they still had bottle when we arrived haha.  I'm guessing because it was a Sunday that parking was extremely easy to find.  I parked pretty much outside the shop, and then walked in.  The decor was fairly modern looking, and there is an upstairs. However, I immediately notice a few drawbacks about the decor.  Somewhat tight, but it's SF, so what can you do, but this led to all the tables on the first floor seating only 2 individuals, so for a group of 5, we took up 3 tables.  Also, I had no freaking clue that to the right of the register was a huge chalkboard that had FOOD ITEMS.  I was so busy looking forward at the drink menu, that I never noticed this.  Such a shame because some of the items sounded really exciting.  I also believe none of my friends noticed the food menu either.  Since I commuted so far, I went what the hell, I might as well get several bottles... LOL. So I decided to try three different drinks.  I got the iced milk with brown sugar and pudding,  the green milk tea with pearls, and a strawberry smoothie with pearls.  All came out pretty quickly, and I was actually extremely satisfied with all 3 drinks.  The level of sweetness is pretty good. It's just sweet enough that you can still taste the drink flavor and flavor from the pearls, but not overly sweet.  Although I really do enjoy the drinks, the price was a little bit steeper than I expected.  Granted I knew I'd be paying for the bottle, but if I were to just get it in a plastic cup, it's 20% off, but most of these drinks were 5$ or more, so that's only about a dollar off, and I think the plastic cup size is 12oz, so yup quite steep.  But at least it's good quality pearls and drinks, so I guess if I were ever in the area again, I would be down to stop by and grab a drink.  Location-wise, I think it's quite good, as it's nestled close to Union Square and Chinatown, but I can see how during peak hours it'd be difficult to find parking.  I would recommend this place to my friends only for the bottle, or if they were in the area.\n\n\nP.S.  I noticed I keep talking about the bottle, and I'm sure if you see the bottle in the photos on here, you'd know what I'm talking about, but they have a disclaimer that they only give out 300 bottle a day, which is why I was in a rush originally! I'm not sure how long this promotion is going on for though.\n\n:D", "author": "Brendan D."}

I remember being slightly disgusted at how overpriced their drinks were. I have my share of favorite Boba spots, and this wouldn't be one of them. This last time I was highly-motivated to write a review, mostly because the chick behind the counter was ridiculously rude. If I'm paying $5 for a mostly-ice drink, atleast be courteous. I also ordered a mango milk with boba to-go to bring home to my kid who's obsessed with boba drinks. \nLet me start with rating my drink. I ordered a salted crema oolong milk tea with tapioca and taro pudding. The pudding was decent, the boba chewier than I prefer. They put too much ice considering how small the container is. And the drink itself was pretty gross. The combination of the saltiness and sweet was not a good balance and unusually love that combination!\nAs for the gal taking my order: I was obviously not familiar with the menu, and she was clearly very impatient and annoyed that she had to correct me. I also tried to discreetly let her know that it's unethical\nTo require a minimum debit card purchase amount. A minimum for credit card is legal, but requiring a minimum amount for debit is downright dirty. I was merely trying to do them a favor as I usually like to help asian-ran businesses to do well. After how rude she was, I am making an exception by writing this review. Instead of recognizing that my tone and demeanor was simply one of saying \"please be careful\", she mistook it as me blowing a whistle at her.

I ended up getting a Thai tea with pearls because I didn't wanna hold up the line and basically I paid for trash in a glass bottle because their Thai tea tasted like toilet water. I would've been more than satisfied with water instead inside that glass bottle tbh. what I'm trying to say is this place is all hype. it's just nice because of the bottle other than that not worth it. lol especially if you don't live in sf don't try this place out.", "author": "Jocelyn F."}

They didn't like the taste of their drinks, either.\n\nThen I gave it one more try with the plain milk tea (no bubbles!) and finally had a pleasant experience.

Location is great for financial district workers such as I am. \n3. Decent lunch/snacks options with their savory waffle sandwiches and desert waffle snacks. \n4. Drinks are served in glass bottles, when they have them available. \n\nThe bad:\n1. The shop seems to be run by very young kids who are still trying to figure out how the business should work and run. They do not run a tight ship and it can get annoying. \n\n2. They advertise waffles, but I have dropped by at least twice around 11-11:30 AM and their waffles are never ready around that time. They open at 11. When I walk into a shop and I see items advertised, I expect the shop to have these items available for me to purchase. If they are not going to be ready until a certain time, they should note this on their menu and not have customers waiting for 15-20 minutes with various excused: \"We just opened and are still getting the waffles ready, we just burned the waffles, we are short staffed, ...\". If you do not have something, don't have it up on the menu. If it is only available after a given time, note this clearly on the menu and other signage, so customers do not waste their time waiting. \n\n3. The cashier is clueless. There's no confidence in her answers. She seems very unsure and has to check with someone for the simplest questions. They should train their cashiers better and anticipate customer questions related to products and pricing that may not always be \"on the menu\". \n\n4. They will make your drink in the empty glass bottle you bring back to the store. However, if you just bring back your bottles to recycle, they do not give you anything for it. Places that are truly conscious about recycling (e.g. The Juice Shop, St Benoit Yogurt) incentivize customers by giving back the \"deposit\" (extra $ you pay for getting your treat in a glass/ceramic bottle) when you return glass/ceramic bottles to them. I hope they further research their business model.", "author": "Rindah L."}

While I can't comment on a comparison between that and the regular tea, I did quite enjoy it. It's not overly sugary like some other boba place, and walks the fine line between a nice treat and dietetic nightmare.\n\nSo why only three stars you ask? Well there's no public urinal at this place. Although there may be a reason why they let you keep the glass jug your drink comes in, there are certain societal expectations when one goes to a particular type of eatery.

I have never been to a place that puts real fruit in the teas and it's just an added touch of love to the things. My favorite is a toss up between the mango and strawberry. \nThe honey lemon tea. That's all. 10/10. Cute little limes floating in there really just help the citrus-y flavors come alive and is just a really awesome tea. \nFor the slushes, I've heard that you have to try the avocado, but I've only had the blueberry. SO GOOD. \nToppings: I love the aloe and the boba, but it's a real bummer that it costs extra:/ kinda disappointing since the drinks average $5 a piece. \nThe employees- AWESOME. I've never had a bad experience there and they are always so accommodating and nice! I've never had any sort of negative interaction with any of the people that work there. It's very inviting and makes it easy to come back(embarrassingly frequently). \nThis place is all around really cute, it's small but for a takeout tea place in the city you'd be crazy not to expect that. Parking can also be crazy, if you don't find yourself walking there nearby it's not good to go noon-1 on weekdays because it's the financial district and everyone insists on taking their lunch. But just about halfway down on the next block, there's a parking garage that's not too expensive and the employees there are very nice as well! \nOverall, a very awesome place:)", "author": "Nina P."}

It gets a star off for being on the pricey side of boba and for my first order, which was a mango smoothie that wasn't mixed well and didn't taste like mango. That being said, it gets 4 stars for my 2nd (and 3rd, 4th, and 5th) orders, which was a peach black tea with aloe and boba. It's absolutely perfect and comes with bits of real peaches; the boba is nice and chewy and the aloe is in delicious cubes almost as large as the boba! Heaven in a cup - I should probably try other flavors eventually but I can't resist getting this combination every time I go...\n\nThere's only one person taking orders so the wait is pretty long, but once your order is actually placed the drink arrives quickly. The glass bottles are also a nice touch and are useful around the house if you don't bring them back for a 10% discount. If you're like me and go get boba on a whim, or just don't want to carry the bottle back, you can also choose to get your drink in a plastic cup and get a 10% discount on the spot. =)", "author": "Stephanie C."}

Today, I decided to give it a try since I was touring my friends around the area. \n\nThe line was decent since the place is actually small. I love how cute the bottle is compared to other boba shops. \n\nHowever, the drink was a different story. I ordered sea salt creama oolong with boba while my other friend ordered passion fruit oolong with lychee jelly. The drinks aren't as great as other tea places. \n\nAlso, they gave me so much boba that I had little to drink with. They do offer adjustment to drinks but like most other places, it's mainly made from syrup. \n\nThe pricing for this place is expensive - only because you are paying for bottle. They have little sittings inside, but unlike other boba joints, they don't give you the password to their wifi. \n\nI would recommend going to ShareTea, TPumps or even Purple Kow if you are looking for a better tasting boba drink compared to the bottle that makes the drink look nice.", "author": "Wanda V."}

If you are one of those folks that likes to save 10% and bring your bottle back, be sure you wash and sanitize it before doing so.  In the past, Plentea would take your bottle, put it on a rack to be washed and make your drink in a new, clean, bottle.  Or so I thought.  I happened to be standing in view of them making my drinks today and watched the girl in the back take my dirty bottles, casually rinsed them and then reused them for my drinks (I had three of them).  When I asked about it and told them that the bottles were not clean, then just stood there staring at me with that expression like \"so, what do you want me to do about it?\".  And when I asked the cashier for a bag for my drinks, she said that would be 10 cents.  I then asked her if I could have my bag back that I originally brought the bottles back in, she said that she already threw it away.  i asked for a new bag and she still wanted to charge me 10 cents. I gave her a dollar and she asks if I wanted my change back.  Really???  I finally get my change and a bag and left, not noticing until later that she only gave me back 80 cents.\n\ni'm from the South Bay and whenever I get up to San Francisco, Plentea was the go-to place.

Got to this place at around 9pm and there was a small line. I ordered the taro milk without any addings and my boyfriend got the peach oolong tea. Unfortunately, they ran out of glass bottles and gave us the 20% discount instead. The drinks took about 20 minutes to make. As I take my first sip of my taro milk it was disappointment immediately! The drink was bland and grainy with a small hint of sweetness (not in a good way). The drink seemed to be composed of milk + syrup + blended taro + ice , something I can make at home for less than $5. As for the peach oolong tea it has a strong artificial peach taste to it. Disappointment all around .  I wouldn't be back again even if they cost less than $5 a drink.", "author": "Lucy C."}

I tossed the drink after a few sips.\n\nHaving tried all the milk tea establishments in the Bay Area, I would rank this place as below average.  Fantasia is still #1 for me.  Overall, the quality of the tea at Plentea just isn't there and the execution is unfortunately very inconsistent.  My friend has been here 4-5X and on days the owner is present, it is good and when he's not, quality is sacrificed.  I'm more than willing to pay the premium for a quality product.  But aside from the fancy glass bottle, there isn't anything special with the tea.\n\nPerhaps other drinks are better but if they can't get a simple iced oolong milk right, i'm hesitant to try others.\n\nIt's too bad given the place had good potential.  It goes with the trend to differentiate via the glass bottle but at the end of the day, if the quality of the end product isn't there, it'll be challenging for repeat business once the novelty of the place wears off.", "author": "Michelle C."}

I had to wait about 10 minutes to order a drink. There is a variety of menu on the board, i did not know which one i should get so i decided to try ice milk with caramel, which was the most popular drink there. I added tapioca and egg pudding into my drink and i was impressed by the cute glass jar when i received my drink. The tasted was really good and i really love the tapioca here. That's the best tapioca in San Francisco. Also, you can take the glass jar home, grab a cap ( next to the straws). You can get 10% discount if you bring your bottle at the next tome you visit. The price is not too high, almost $4 or $5 and add mote topping just 50 cents. The service is also good and fast. The only disadvantage at Plentea is that they don't have any restroom for customer.

Unfortunately I was not wowed by their flavors and limited selection of drinks. I got the brown sugar ice milk because they said it was one of their more popular drinks. I wanted to adjust my sweetness to 50% but the cashier recommended getting it at regular because \"it will defeat the purpose of getting the drink in the first place\" and he said it's \"not even that sweet anyway.\" First taste? pretty darn sweet to me! There wasn't anything unique about the drink that would want me to order it again. Prices are slightly more expensive especially since the drink doesn't come with tapioca. We ended up using the 25% off offer on Yelp which helped with the costs but probably would not place Plentea as one of my go to spots for milk tea.

Drinks start at $4.50+ tax for regular tea drinks without toppings and go up to $6.95+ tax for the fruit milk drinks. \n+Offers organic salads and waffles. Grand opening deal right now whereby customers get 25% off their lemon honey drink if they order a waffle. Waffles were about $7 bucks.\n\nMinus:\n-Ordered a mount premium tea drink which can be unsweetened. However, tell them twice because one of mine came out sweet and I did not know until I got home. They forgot what I told them!\n-Gals at the counter were not too creative and flexible with the menu.

This happens more frequently after leaving Plentea, where the blocky yet unique glass bottles don't give much room for anything but maybe water for a small plant. What a collectible. Actually, we DID find ourselves thinking we could use them for casual drinking glasses, something my grandma has a tendency to do after she uses a plastic container. I remember taking home leftovers from holiday meals in cool whip or potato salad containers. The label like a fading color in the bones of a family heirloom. I preferred them over the traditional Rubbermaid because I knew they were a time capsule from her. When I was five or so I'd also use pre-used cool whip containers to make mud pies behind the community pool fence at my grandma's apartment complex. I usually left them out to dry all night, and one day they disappeared: that first feeling that someone enjoyed something I had created so much they took it home, maybe kept it in the fridge, served it to ten-minute guests. Anyway, I told my girlfriend we should boil off the label to the Plentea bottles; she thought otherwise. There's a glass under my car seat even now. Emergencies. I'm sure that, when we get around to it, we'll drink something from the converted Plentea glass without the anxiety that we'll run out faster than we can enjoy it. But, alternately, I imagine myself forgetting about it and finding it years later when I'm deep into a thorough cleaning, which definitely won't happen soon because I'm too intimidated by California's drought propaganda to hose off the months of dirt and 65-miles-per-hour wind on my car.

I was kind of disappointed because it was really just lavender pieces with some lemonade and sparkling water. It wasn't really worth the line and the price but I did get the glass bottle.

It was no differently from Honey Boba and I wanted to try the Sea Salt Crema so I ordered a 5th one to go. I left it at the hotel frig and drank it on our way back to LA. We stopped at Gilroy and at that point started drinking the boba. IMAGINE my disgust while chewing the boba, crunched into something and I started spitting it out and while standing in front of the line at The Body Shop, the cashier handed me a trash can so that I can vomit what seemed to be broken glasses. I immediately called the Manager of Plentea and all I got was an apology. REALLY? I took pictures of the broken glass and inspected the bottle. It was intact and had no crack or chip, which only meant that the broken glass came from somewhere else. I will definitely consult with my lawyer and ask him what my rights are!!!

I'm sure the initial draw for everyone is the novelty of the glass jug, but I'm glad the drinks didn't disappoint.\n   We ordered the salted crema w oolong without hesitation, but wanted to get creative with the second drink but settled with the Thai milk tea w boba. The salted crema was different than other salted cremas and foams, as this one was like whipped cream floating on top, but it was so good. We did wish they had given us more of it, though, because it's just a small dollop of it and it wasn't the most easy thing to get at with the smaller opening of the milk bottle. \n   We also found out that the fruit milks use whole milks, while the milk teas use coffee mate or creamers, and you can sub for Soy Milk, except for the Thai milk tea. They also offer sugar level modifications, which is great. The Salted Crema Oolong was awesome with just 25% sweetness.\n   I was also surprised that this place opened late on a Sunday night, considering the surrounding location is pretty dead after normal business hours and days. They offer 10% off if you bring back your glass bottle to reuse, also a discount if you use plastic cups. The glass jugs are quite a waste of resources, but it is such a draw. It's highly unlikely that the everyday customer will have their glass with them on hand, unless they actually work in the FiDi or Soma area.

There was a long line so we got curious and stand in line. We learned it was a boba tea shop. Their hot unique selling point that drives people there is their drinks come with a cute glass jar and you can take it back for discount. Unfortunately the day I was their they have a shortage on those jug but they willing to give 20% discount off of the drinks. My husband waited in line at least 15 mins before we are up to order and waited another 6-7 mins for our drinks.  We ordered a fresh mango smoothie with boba and their famous ice salted caramel crema oolong tea. The drinks are good. I like the mango smoothie better then the salted caramel crema oolong tea.  The mango tasted very fresh and good tapioca boba. Nice rubbery texture and nice to chew on.  The salted caramel was little too salty for me. I don't think the Creme mixed too good with the salt since it wasn't too sweet or the texture is rich enough to hold up the saltiness.  I would go back once in awhile but not purposely just to make a trip there. Especially they don't have that jug. The people works there did mentioned the jug supply will be back to normal in July.  Until then.. Just need to go early to hope u get a jug after standing in line for 15-20 mins.....in don't think the place is at four star yet but maybe a 3.5 star.", "author": "Becky K."}

Mind you, it's so DIFFICULT to find metered parking around that place. So while I drove, my mom started to drink her boba and a couple of sips into her drink she found herself chewing on something crunchy in the tapioca. She spat out the tapioca and LO AND BEHOLD there were two small pieces of BROKEN GLASS INSIDE THE TAPIOCA that she was chewing on. \n\nWe didn't touch the other two in fear of chewing on broken glass. I tried calling Plentea to let them know so we don't have to trudge all the way back to downtown but they didn't answer. SO we're going to go back and return the drinks and hopefully get to talk to the manager or supervisor and show them the tapioca with the broken glass pieces and get a refund. \n\nI saw another review of a customer that was served with broken glass as well. \n\nThis will be the last time we're giving them our business.

The first time I visited, I wasn't sure what to get but saw that another yelper had gotten a \"salted caramel\" milk tea. I thought it looked delicious and decided I would order that. When I placed my order I was told that there was no such thing. The sweet cashier started listing off options to me and with some confusion I ordered, not really sure of what I would receive. What I got was the most delicious drink ever. A milky caramel drink with boba on the bottom topped off with a thick delicious cream on the top. Of course it was so good that I had to go back and order another a few days later. When I went to do so, I tried to explain to the cashier what I got the last time. She looked confused and what I ended up with was disgusting and nothing like what I got the first time. Unfortunately I was in a hurry so I just took it and left. That leads me to today. I was determined to get the drink of my dreams again and returned to attempt to order correctly. After standing in line, I tried to explain to the cashier exactly what I wanted. She again looked very confused, but was very sweet and tried to point me in the right direction. I ordered and when I received my drink I could tell just by looking at it that it wasn't the right thing. I wasn't worried though, because they have a large sign that says \"we will fix your drink if you don't think it's perfect.\" So without even touching the drink I told the cashier it wasn't right and asked her for milk tea on the bottom, not plain tea as I had been given. She sweetly listened and went to the back only to come back to tell me that her manager said if I wanted another tea I would have to pay for it. I asked to speak to her manager and was rudely confronted by her. She kept saying \"well what am I supposed to do with this drink?? I can't give it to another customer!!! I don't see what the problem is. What's your problem??\" Finally I was forced to read her sign to her, which she just happened to be standing next to. She finally conceded, and as she walked to the back THREW my drink into the sink in anger. (Remember, glass bottles.) I was made another drink that was closer to what I wanted but still without the creamy top that I asked for, but I was sick of arguing so I left. I'm sad. I really wanted that delicious drink again, but I guess I'll never have it, as even if I did decide to give that rude woman more of my money for her overpriced drinks, she still probably couldn't get it right. I just felt bad for the cashier who was very sweet and apologetic.", "author": "Lauren C."}

The same amount of time it takes me at other boba places. The boba was super chewy and soft, which is imperative because we've all witnessed hard boba and can officially say it sucks.

I completely apologize in advance for such a long review but it's an entire incident that happened.\nI was visiting SF with friends and when we first arrived there were only a few people but after we ordered people started flooding in. Thirty minutes after ordering, my friend and I still hadn't received our order. When we walked up to tell them they told my friend that they never made his drink because they got too busy and basically said that it was his fault for not reminding them to make his drink sooner. When I asked them about my drink the \"barista\" filled up a black tea for me real quick when I ordered a green tea and then handed it to me. I didn't touch it and told him \"Actually, I ordered a green tea\" and showed him my receipt. He set it down and continued with the other orders. I stood there waiting to talk to the cashier again and when I finally got his attention I let him know I got the wrong order. The barista came back to talk to the cashier and told him I was wrong... My boyfriend then came over to see what was taking so long and the barista looked at my boyfriend and told him this was my drink pointing at the black tea. My boyfriend picked it up handing it to me and I told him to set it down. Then the barista told me that because he touched it its now mine. The barista didn't stop there, he then held up another tea and said \"Look at this tea. This is what black tea looks like, does this look like yours?!\" I told him that I saw him fill up my bottle with the canister that said \"BLACK TEA\". The manager then came out and I asked for my money back but he wouldn't let me get my money back. Instead he continued to insist I try another drink. I then asked for a Thai tea to-go. The manager then said \"It is to-go, all the drinks are to-go, why do you think the caps are here!?\" At that point I was just shocked at the customer service. They cared more about being right than treating the customer with respect. He handed me the Thai and said \"Try it and make sure you like it this time\" ...Uh, the problem wasn't that I didn't like the drink, it was that they never got the order right in the first place.

When I got there, there was a line, but that's okay because tpumps was just like that when it had it's grand opening here in sf irving. Since it's gonna be pretty busy for awhile, they should make the drinks with a faster solution. The place is a bit crowded, especially the first floor. When it was my turn to order, the cashier was very nice and suggested me whats good. I got the fresh fruit mango milk drink with tapioca and ice milk with tapioca & taro pudding. The bottle caps, straws, etc were all placed neatly on the counter! I think my drinks came in no later than 5 minutes. The food there in my opinion is not worth it. Something they should improve on, is putting more ice in it. My fruit drink was cold yes but not cold enough. it was too foamy and needed more ice. The taro pudding is good!!! I am willing to come back to try more of the drinks. I would give this place a 3.5.", "author": "Josie D."}

My coworkers told me about this place and I've been here twice.  Maybe I'm order the wrong thing.  I usually go with just a plain milk tea with boba and it just doesn't hit the spot like other places.  I came in pretty late one night and only one girl was working.  She dispensed my milk tea from a large square cube and there was something so unappealing about that.  Decent service.  While I'm not totally against this place, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back since the quality just isn't there and it's pricier than other locations.", "author": "k h."}

Drinks are still very good and the quality of ingredients is excellent. I've enjoyed trying just about everything on their menu. They're a little faster than they used to be, and the kitchen looks much cleaner. Why I'm not bumping it to 4 or 5 stars: Still too slow! Last week there was a guy operating the register who slowed down the whole process by messing up just about every order, forgetting ingredients, etc. Another employee tried to take over but he said, \"no, I'm having fun!\" Would prefer he have fun when the line isn't out the door. Also, I find it annoying that they have a $15 credit card minimum! This is ridiculously high and is often what keeps me from going here. If they could speed up the order process (they're super quick with making the drinks, it's the register that's slowing them down), and lower that credit card minimum to $5, I'd be a regular customer.", "author": "Alison S."}

Listen, if you want to spend $6.47 for a Hazelnut Milk Tea (with two toppings) that will actually turn into Chocolate Milk Tea when your recieve your order, then by all means come here. That's what happened to me today and I dont like it. In fact, I'm tired of all these inconsistencies and drinks not being what i expect them to be half the time. And for the price of two bobas somewhere else?! Yeah i think I'll stop coming here. $6.47 psssh. To be honest, i didnt even realize i was spending that much because i kept throwing down a ten dollar bill and just never really processed it. This week all I had were ones so i was paying more attention to the cost. Last week my drink was $6.69 WITH a 10% discount for bringing back a jar for that coffee milk tea. hahahah oh god. Don't be fooled by the jars. They're basically sirens singing to your eyeballs. Passssss. BYE FUHLEESHUH.", "author": "Mila B."}

I've heard about this place before from a best friend of mine so I decided to walk in since I was so close. I love how they serve their drinks in such hip glass bottles. That's probably their selling point as I don't know any other boba place to do so. Drinks were mediocre; I ordered the iced Thai milk tea with tapioca and my brother got the oolong tea without boba. My Thai tea seemed to be heavy on the milk part but nonetheless good. Tapioca was chewy and not hard like other places. The one thing I didn't really like to much about Plentea, is the price of their drinks. A usual milk tea shouldn't be $4 almost $5, but I guess you are actually paying for a glass bottle too. Overall, everything was good, customer service needs some work but other than that, they are a good boba place with a novelty jar to take home!", "author": "May S."}

Glass was cool since I can bring it back for a 10% discount.  Otherwise if you have no plan too bring it back I don't think it's worth the added cost.  Prices are pretty high and they ask if its \"to go\" or \"for here\".  I said \"to go\" and was still charged sales tax.  It is up to the establishment to charge tax if the food is \"to go\" so I think it would help them out a lot with the pricing if they do not charge tax on \"to go\" orders.  Also, I know its the first day and it still took some time to prepare my drink even though I was the only one.  So be prepared to wait until they get up to speed.  I'll be back with my glass to try some other drinks.", "author": "Jason C."}
