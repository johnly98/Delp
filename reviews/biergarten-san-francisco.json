In their stead lie establishments such as Biergarten Hayes Valley! Pretty good and overpriced...\n\nLet me explain. I enjoy this place. The service was friendly and prompt. I got the burger with arugula Swiss and deli mustard, for $8, and a liter of German style beer for $20. That's right, each ounce of this beer cost me approximately $0.59. *sips slowly* Aaahhhh...\n\nThe burger was a slider. There's no way around it. My friend got a bratwurst which he described as a Costco hot dog in a sourdough bun that was toasted on the outside only, which was $11. I anticipate his review will yield one star if he doesn't pass out from hunger before posting it. I personally am having a friend pick up food for me so that I survive a bar crawl tonight.\n\nOverall, delicious experience for me, but the prices reflect a level of inflation we shouldn't hit for another 27 years. \n\nProst!", "author": "Richard J."}

I suppose if you really hate German beer and sausages and this is not the place for you, but even then it might be because you can still sit outside with your friends and eat pretzels and drink cider so really you have nothing to lose.\n\nAll of their beer is German beer which is important to know, but if you like trying German beers this is a great place to try a few different varieties. You can also get full liters (those big steines you think of when you think german beer) which is always fun. \n\nThey also have a bunch of different food including sausages and pretzels and sandwiches and pickles and other appetizers. I got the curry wurst last time which tasted like curry wurst! The pretzels were also quite good we also got potato dumplings which were quite tasty.\n\nThe best part about this place though definitely is that it's all outdoor seating. They have big long picnic tables by lots of people can sit outside in the sun. They also have some of them covered with a tent though so if you have a baby that needs protection from the sun like I do you're still set. I totally disagree that this place is bad for kids. Maybe not good for kids I suppose but fine for babies - I was not the only one there with an infant. It's easy to bring a stroller in too. Only warning here is that it is pretty loud. \n\nBe warned!

The knot is just a pretzel with something inside. This one had like a slice of prosciutto or something. It was terribly overpriced at $7 and not worth it. It should be like $4.50-$5.00 and no more than that. It is a snack and not a meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-12", "description": "There was a time when I lived in Hayes Valley.  My landlord, who lived on Upper Polk, had bought a condo on Page Street and when I informed her that I'd be moving out she said \"I was hoping that neighborhood would be better by now.  That was supposed to be my retirement home\".  \n\nThat was in the late 1980's, when a freeway ran right through the neighborhood and hookers solicited business beneath that freeway, at least on Page Street.  That landlord may be long gone but her dream of an improved Hayes Valley has arrived.  What a change 30 years makes.\n \nThough there's a million booze and food choices lining Hayes Street, Biergarten sits off Patricia's Green, hidden amongst the shipping containers offering coffee, juice, and ice cream.  Its popularity makes clear that it's no secret, but unless you're looking for it it'd be easy to miss.    \n\nThere's nothing here to go crazy over but the appeal of casual al fresco dining and drinking (especially in the heat of late) is attractive.  Having hit Berlin at the beginning of winter, when their biergartens had mostly moved indoors, Biergarten stood in as a worthy surrogate.  \n\nI sampled only beer, a warm pretzel, and potato salad ($6) and feel confident in reporting that Biergarten will fill your gut without raiding your savings.  It inspired my partner, with his 1/2 pint beer, to look around at the full pints and offer \"I'd like to come back here again\" (no doubt for more beer).  \n\nWith the picnic tables pretty full my 2-person party did little to skew the average patron age at Biergarten which otherwise skews young.  Still, nobody looked askance at those of us who remember this area from a time that pre-dates their birth certificate.  Despite the crowd, Biergarten proved to be good for all ages and, though I saw a dog there I notice that their web site says \"no pets\".  That right there might be the worst thing about the place. \n\nBier, filling German fare, and sunshine; what's not to like?", "author": "Tracey A."}

So when my friends started going to Biergarten (I pronounce it as Beer Garden because I'm not pretentious) regularly, life became absolutely wunderbar (ok, maybe a little pretentious).\n\nBiergarten was made for a degenerate like myself. It is a place of unadulterated drinking. Within its chic outdoor confines, no one judges you for indulging in a few extra drinks, because hell, their judgement is probably impaired! \n\nThere are a selection of about 5 beers. I forget what they all are exactly because when it comes to beer, I don't discriminate. The more important choice you have to make is choosing the size of the beer. DON'T GET THE SMALL ONE. If you want to be one of those \"I'm just here for the company\" people, then yeah go for the small one. No one will ever respect you, though. Everyone should get the large. It comes in a big ol' stein with one liter of goodness poured inside. As a punny friend of mine once said, it's outsteinding. \n\nMany a times I had held that sturdy stein by the handle with anticipation frothing in my mind. Holding heavy in my hands, the golden lager seduces my senses until I give in passionately to my urge. The soft white foam brushes briefly beneath my nose, like the ripples from a calm summer wave. Then a gush of cold, refreshing beer bursts through. Oh! So cold, so sweet, so satisfying! *Gulp* *Gulp* *Gulp* AHHHHHHH. So satisfying indeed. \n\nBut alas, I can no longer indulge in this fine pleasure from Biergarten. One fateful Friday night, when I was throwing down the last of my liter stein, I saw something that I simply cannot erase from my memory. Three little mice skittered nonchalantly around that one shipping container at the edge. I was a little intoxicated at that point, so it may have been three big rats (or Three Blind Mice) for all I know. \n\nI can't do it, I just can't. \n\nI still love beer. But I fear rats. I guess my fear of rats is greater than that of my love for beer. So then I guess maybe I am not a degenerate? Or maybe just a cowardly one.", "author": "Ringo M."}

I am a lover of all beers and delicious bar food and Biergarten delivers on both accounts. \n\n+ ATMOSPHERE: Outdoors, very hip, tons of picnic table style seating, twinkly string lights, and food truck-ish vibes. I've been here twice so far; once after work and once right when they opened on a Sunday. After work, it was CRAZY PACKED. Like brimming with techies and hipsters. EVERYWHERE. It's hard to find a seat. The other time, we got there right when it opened at 1 PM ish so it wasn't packed but it filled up within the hour. So definitely try to plan accordingly because it'll be hard to find seating unless you're lucky. Biergarten is very casual and a great spot to hang out with friends. It's sort of like someone's backyard hang out spot. It's chill. It's cool. I dig it.\n\n+ BEER/FOOD: The beer is expensive (typical of SF of course). Choices are somewhat limited. But very good beers. There are half liter and full liter options. I think most of the liters were ~$20 and half liters ranged from ~$8-10 each. Tons of food on the menu though! So many German food options! I ordered the pretzel because I wasn't incredibly hungry. It came with some spicy mustard and horse radish. DELISH. SO SOFT. I love soft pretzels. I wanna try the other food on the menu! My friend ordered the Guest Knot and he thoroughly enjoyed it as well. \n\n+ THE FINAL VERDICT: Biergarten is a great German inspired beer garden. I'm a fan of course, but mostly for the atmosphere. I love the outdoor seating and how everything's set up. It's a perfect place to chill and hang out with friends. Very casual and laid back. The food and beer is solid. There are more choices for food than there are for beers, which is a little upsetting because I love my beer -- but I can deal because I mainly come here to hang out.", "author": "Amy T."}

When the sun is out (and even when it's not), you can bet that people flock to this place to sit out in the sun and drink delicious beer. Biergarten is a great use of space, as they utilize shipping containers and make an empty lot a fun place for people to congregate. Their beer list is extensive and offers something for everything. And the food, omg, I absolutely love German food, and they do not disappoint. My favorite sausages are the Bratwurst and the Currywurst; they are both authentic and filling. The pretzels and pickled deviled eggs are great for sharing (although I hate having to share my pretzel). \n\nThe problem, you ask? That LINE. The line of all lines. In order to get a beer or order food, you have to wait in a line that snakes practically across the lot. And it's not a fast line either, especially when you're thirsty or your friends are already seated and waiting for you. I wish there was a better system for ordering; normally I would just order two drinks at a time, but the beer would quickly get warm sitting in the sun (and no one likes warm beer). So there you have it: a lively spot to meet friends, great beer and food, but the most buzzkill line ever.", "author": "Regina L."}

The pretzel had a nice tingly light salty taste to it; the dough was soft and warm! I was happy that it was freshly baked and it came with radish and mustard- definitely tasted like the pretzel I had from the Frankfurt airport I had a year ago :) Good memories. The German sausage came with a small serving of potatoes. I thought that it would taste amazing with siracha LOL. Coincidentally two German travelers sat next to us and we instantly got along. We asked if it tasted authentically and they actually told us it was really good!! I'd say this beer garden attracts the right crowd- friendly, fun, and adventurous people.

Now I'm not a beer expert, but I do have a fully stocked beer fridge in my bedroom so that definitely puts me in  the category of \"Someone who drinks a lot of beer\" (and a lazy ass, but that's besides the point). The best beers at Biergarten are definitely the darker ones (IPA, amber ale, Oktoberfest, etc.), but on a HOT ass day when I want to be outdoors, I don't want a fucking IPA; I want something lighter and refreshing and those kind of beers here are not my cup of tea. I mean whatever, I'll finish the gargantuan stein of lager because I ain't no lil bitch, but I don't enjoy it. And for $18/Liter, I want to enjoy it.\n\nAnother time I was like maybe I'll just drink 2 L of the Radler because it'll taste better and will be the alcohol equivalent of 1 L of its base beer (Helles), but nooope. It was even worse. The added lemon soda is almost chemical tasting and I didn't even get a good buzz :(\n\nIt can also get pretty crowded, but what do you expect?

Pretty easy and simple concept -- a stand to order beer and food and a set of picnic tables to sit on. The beer selection is kind of small, but still hard to pick from--always ask for a sample bc likely they might not have the beer you usually order as the menu changes. If you are staying there the whole night, I would suggest the ~20 dollar liter of beer, but the half liter seriously does the trick. They only serve beer and wine so go somewhere else if you really want to get turnt. \n\nWhat makes this stand out from other beer gardens is that it is purely outdoor (oh the Lights, yes the lights are beautiful) and it is very conveniently located to the freeway and other restaurants.

The requisite tree is in the center of the garten and additional vegetation is planted around the perimeter so it feels more green even though you're in the middle of a city.  The benches are exactly the ones they have in Bavaria (though they are spaced slightly further apart here since we Americans need our personal space).  We didn't try the food but I noticed they serve pretzels with obatzda, a cream cheese and paprika spread, which is surprisingly legit.  And of course the German beer list is solid (got your weissbier, lager, doppelbock, pilsner, and even a radler (50/50 Helles lager + sparkling lemonade) - but it's sold at American prices.  A half liter will cost you $8-10 (Schneider Weisse is $9 and their Edel-Weisse is $10), and a full liter costs double - so no cost savings for ordering the liter.  Besides the prices, the other thing that is very un-Bavarian is the line.  Germans hate lines and they really hate having to wait for their beer.  At Biergarten on a sunny Sunday afternoon we waited 27 minutes to order because well, San Franciscans love lines.  However the SF touch that I do appreciate is the blankets for when it inevitably gets cold and windy.  All in all, Biergarten is a very smartly executed concept which is why we continue to return.

We wanted to go somewhere with alcohol. Somewhere in the city. She then stumbled upon an article on Thrillist that mentioned something about beer served by the liter...and that's how I found myself at Biergarten. \n\nWe thought we arrived early. To our surprise, there was already a pretty substantial line of hipsters and it was a bit of a wait to find a seat. \n\nAdmittedly, I'm not exactly a fan of most of the beers they serve here (more of a fan of American craft beers), but considering the venue, I wouldn't want to drink anything other than German beer. They do have a limited tap list. You can probably find something you'll like, though. As for me, I was really looking forward to drinking a dunkel (dark lager) since I haven't had a dunkel beer in a while, but they were out. Ended up with a liter of Schneider-Weisse ($16) which was okay. My friend and I also split the pork belly sliders ($9). The bread was fluffy, buttery, and nicely done. I really am a stickler when it comes to choosing the right bread for a sandwich and Biergarten did it right! The pork was tender and pretty flavorful. I liked that red cabbage slaw too. Overall, it was a great slider but not very filling for the price. \n\nAs for the seats, unless you are in a large group, you're probably going to be sharing one of those tables with a group of strangers. \n\nOh. And if you want another beer or more food, you'll have to fall back in line...which wouldn't be that big of a deal if the lines weren't so long. \n\nAnyway, this place is pretty cool. I'll definitely come back for another liter and maybe one of those delicious looking prezels since the weather is nice right now.

I ALWAYS get the full liter beers so I don't have to get back in line (the lines can get pretty crazy)  to get a second one. I also always get a pretzel or two, not only are they nice and warm, but help to soak up all that beer. One thing about this place is that all the patrons are incredibly friendly. I don't know if it's the communal seating, but every time I come here I end up meeting someone new an have played games with other groups sitting at our table. \n\nI have never had a beer I didn't like here. I generally stick to the lighter stuff since I'm usually under the sun. Ordering can be a bit overwhelming if you don't know your German beers. The cool thing is they let you sample different beers before you get it and generally give good recommendations if you ask. If you are there later, they give you blankets which I thought was pretty cool. This is undeniably one of my favorite places in SF!", "author": "Thielson D."}

So come right when they open if you don't want to wait for seating!

Fair enough! Thanks Biergarten for being understanding :) \n\nI had the frankfurter and the cider since I'm not a beer drinker. The frankfurter was delicious and came with a generous serving of sauerkraut. I'm not usually a fan of sauerkraut but I found it to be delicious! The cider was not too dry and not too sweet, perfect in my opinion.\n\nThe service is prompt, the prices are reasonable, and the beer and food options are vast and tasty!

I would go again if my friends really wanted to go cuz the beer was good. But the lines are no bueno.\n\nFood:\nI had the golden wheat beer and it was really good. I liked it a lot. plus it was bigger than my head!! Paid $18 for a 1L beer in a big glass. That lasted me a while. But I'm not a fast drinker, friends had about the same though. My friends ordered the mushroom sliders which I got a bite of and it was pretty good, however it was $9 for two small sliders. A teensy bit pricey for not having any meat in 'em.\n\nAtmosphere: \nso basically this place is a chain-gated off area, and inside are two bungalows (1 to make the food and another to serve the beer) and a bunch of wooden tables with bench and a couple of string lights. I wish it didn't have the gates, it'd feel a lot better. It has such a chill vibe cuz everyones just having a good time cuz everyone's drinking. But if you think about it, they didn't put that much effort into making the place look very nice.  Also people just sit forever and never leave so be prepared to wait for a table! \n\nService:\nPretty clean tables. Some staff come around from time to time.

If you are hosting your underage younger sibling from out of town, this is the perfect place because they don't ID until you buy a beer! So they can sit, hang out, eat food, and not feel guilty for severely limiting everyone's activities.\n\n\"Garden\" is a stretch of a description, but it is a concrete garden smack dab in the middle of the city, with open seating and picnic tables blocked off by a chain link fence. The surrounding area (Hayes Valley) is fantastic, with many great options for dinner or brunch, cute clothing shops and dessert stores, and there is an actual green park area just across the street. Right now they have a giant wooden temple and an art wall there too, and sometimes there are pop-up markets, so walking around can be fun.\n\nPro-tips:\n1. Go early to snag a table -- they are hard to get. Don't be surprised if you end up sharing one with strangers.\n2. If you are meeting friends, the line is just for food/beer, not to get inside.\n3. If you're unsure about the weather, dress warm -- it's often chilly, and you'll be outside the whole time. There are no heat lamps, but they do have blankets in the storage container.\n4.

As a good German girl, I had to see for myself if this was a good drinking spot or not.\n\nThe good:\n- Conveniently located right off the Freeway - even if you aren't a city dweller, you can find this spot pretty easy. Simply exit at Octavia from 101 and you'll see it pretty quickly.\n- Parking is easily accessible, even on the weekends.\n- It's always fun drinking beer out in the sunshine.\n- Very good beer selection. Not too many choices, but the ones they have on-tap are pretty good.\n- Fresh baked pretzels to go with your brew. Yummy!\n\nThe not-so-great:\n- As with many outdoor patios, Biergarten gets pretty crowded on a relatively warm, sunny day in San Francisco. You definitely need to be aggressive when it comes to finding a seat.\n- Their Radler was disappointing. Having spent 3 weeks in Germany as an exchange student, I'm quite familiar with different varieties of lemonade/beer combos. This one wasn't good - way too sweet. Stick to the other drinks on the menu.\n- Once the sun goes down, it gets pretty chilly this time of year. Bundle up and bring a blanket!

The tables are really close to each other, so you can literally be trapped in the center with the tree if you exit the wrong way. Otherwise, I love the coziness of good company and warm yellow lights on a nippy evening. This really, is a biergarten.\n\nThe huge, glaring drawback is that the line to get into the place at all gets long. I understand that this must be nice once you're inside to not have people crowding around you for seats. But still. It's a funny situation. I felt like I was waiting at the border to go to the promise land and that bouncer was US customs. Either that or it felt like prison, but where being in prison was a good thing. Several other people from the inside were at the chain link fence consoling their friends on the outside. I know how this feels because I was on the outside.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

I had the Schneider Weisse, and it was my favorite beer ever.  It had hints of banana and some spices, and I would totally recommend it.  It's a darker color, but it does not taste like it at all.

The location is pretty sweet and, even though it's basically set up in a chain link fenced parking lot, they've done a good job of making it feel cozy. \n\nI don't get how they're so, so, soooo slow. This is BEER folks, which comes out of taps and bottles. It's not craft cocktails that take meticulous care and attention to detail to create correctly, nor is it a perfectly slow-dripped individual cup of coffee. Beer - the same basic stuff that's whipped up in seconds at any other bar. Maybe they don't have enough people behind the counter? After 5 visits, I still haven't been able to figure it out.\n\nAnother thing to be aware of, and I state it here because, given their location and lack of signposting, it's totally non-obvious. Biergarten DOES NOT allow dogs. That's right: even though it's outdoors and in a parking lot, they won't let you bring your pup in. I'm sure they have their reasons for this but, as a dog owner looking for a cool place to chill during a nice summer day, it's a giant downer that makes me feel like \"not fair!!!\"\n\nWith all of that, I'd have given it a measly two stars. There's good stuff too, though, bringing it to a solid three. The food and beer are delicious, when its cold and windy (which is pretty frequent), they'll bring along cozy blankets to keep patrons warm. Its location right next to Smitten, Ritual, and a wide variety of other Hayes Valley spots makes it a tolerable destination for even non-drinkers. Be warned, though: the Biergarten staff does not look kindly on bringing outside food in to the place. I've literally seen people get kicked out for nibbling on a slice of Pizza.\n\nSo, all in all - a decent place to kill a sunny Saturday afternoon in Hayes Valley.

Lines were out the door (or rather fence), but that didn't stop us.\n\nBiergarten is a very simple concept. You get your beer, sit down at a table with your buds, and simply enjoy the blissful world of Hayes Valley around you. Aside from lights and umbrellas, there's no decorations. \n\nBeer selection is minimal, but high quality. For Oktoberfest, they had around 5 different beers, including the famous but mediocre Hofbr\u00e4u Oktoberfestbier and the delightful Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest-M\u00e4rzen. $7 for 1/2L and $14 for 1L. Pretty decent prices for high quality beer. \n\nIn addition to beer, you get your choice of typical German street foods. Bratwurst, pretzels, deviled eggs, etc. It doesn't even compare with what you'd find at a festival in Germany, but it's good enough to balance out your beer. I got a Frankfurter, which is served with mustard and sauerkraut. Although it was pretty tasty, it's not worth $8. Most of the food items are heavily overpriced, so I advise you eat before coming here. \n\nThe venue gets crowded very easily, especially on a weekend or such a big holiday, so scoping out seats is a must. They could easily put more tables in here. Also, since you're outside, be ready for the temperature changes. \n\nOverall, a great place to enjoy one of Germany's most vital contributions to American society.", "author": "Dmitriy S."}

Maybe it's just my tastes from the hop filled hills of California but the three German beers that i tried all seemed to taste the same.  The bartender at the end of the night was even able to give us a try of the Octoberfest beer they were going to have on tap the next day as they were switching out the kegs but even that just fell a bit short of expectations.  The bonus of course with German beer is that everything is served in liter glasses. By the time my brain had figured out the conversion rate of liters to pints it was already too late for me. \n\nFood 8/10:  For such a small location the Biergarten manages to put out a good variety of traditional German beer house food. Pretzel rolls and sausages smothered in spicy mustard and kraut area a must.  My favorite thing was the potato dumplings and bacon gravy, it warmed my heart and raised my blood pressure.

The line to get the beer is long, especially on a beautiful Sunday when the sun's out for once.  I only waited for about 40 minutes (keyword: about).  My friends have waited for as long as an hour.  Sorta ridiculous to wait an hour just to get a beer to sit outside.  \n\nThey provide blankets if it does get a little chilly!\n\nBut I do get why people's willing to wait.  Having a beer outdoors is just so much more enjoyable, especially if you can enjoy it from a legit litre glass.  Only German brews are carried here.  I do wish that they serve a bigger variety but I guess they are staying true!  You can get the smaller size, but just get the litre.

The line goes all the way outside of the area, so much that when we first got there, I thought it was a line to get in. \n\nThe beer is good. You can get one of the large beers for about $16. There's also a bunch of different food here you can eat after drinking. I suggest having one or two people waiting in line. Once that person is close to the front, everyone needs to give their ID's to that person and they would just order all the beers. When we brought the beer back, we didn't give the ID's back to people until they gave us money for their beer lol. It worked out in the end since most people had cash. \n\nThere's a bunch of seating but it's good to get here a little early to have someone save seats, it does fill up fast. But people are friendly and don't mind sharing the tables with other people. It was sunny when we came here but there was a slight wind, which made it great. My friend told me on really nice days, this place gets crazy packed. Later on in the early evening it started getting cloudy and chilly. But that's SF for you, so be prepared. \n\nThe bathrooms are in the back. The guys restroom is just one room and inside there's the toilet seat and the urinal. The faucet is back outside in middle between the men and women doors. \n\nOverall, this is a great place to day drink, chill and enjoy the weather outside with friends.

My bf notices this and actually calls this DB out, \"hey man, are you with someone or are you cutting the line??\" bewildered man's response, \"oh um, i have friends inside...\" disgruntled bf: \"dude i've got friends inside too and i still waited in this line to get in.\"  so the guy actually acknowledged this and went to the back of the line...score one.\n\nso now we're at the front of the line, and it happens yet again...some b*tch just walks up and shows the bouncer her ID and the bf calls out this woman too... \"hey i just chewed some a**hole out for cutting in front of everyone...you need to wait in like the rest of us.\"  skank \"oh i have friends inside,\" \"WE ALL have friends inside dude!\" and the girl must've felt entitled and was like \"uh huh\" & whipped her hair at this and proceeded inside.  At this point we turn to the bouncer and ask if he's gonna keep letting people in and his lame response was \"we just opened a few days ago, we're still figuring stuff out...\" really??  i wanted to make the funny/dramatic point that society will start falling apart at the seams if he can't obey the rules of a line.  i mean really dude, DO YOUR JOB.  you're gonna have riots (not really,) and disgruntled patrons...this isn't cool.\n\nupon entry into the biergarten, we weren't 5ft in the door when it happened a third time and this time I was fired up and called them out...and yet again the response they felt justified cutting the line because \"we have friends inside.\" man i guess i should've just done that upon arriving too... i had friends inside too but i still waited! grrr...\n\nok enough ranting already... after all that hooplah, we still had a wonderful time.  beer line was awful so i can't wait for them to figure that one out.  i still would totally come back, i love the feel of this place.  yay beer n pretzels!

My friend and I made the novice mistake of commandeering seats and taking lavatory breaks and suffered the consequences: forty minutes in line waiting to order our drinks. The sun beat down on the back of my neck and ears, freckling my face in a very un-German way as I gazed enviously at the wise folks already sipping their authentic Bavarian brews from steins so full and so heavy they had to be lifted with two hands.\n\nDespite the wait, this place is glorious. Beer (German-brewed tongue-twisters in name and in flavor) comes in liters or half-liters, both of which stay surprisingly, blissfully cold no matter how long it takes you to polish them off. Traditional German fare includes pretzels with horseradish and sharp mustard, sliders, and bright, pickled seasonal things (eggs, grapes, carrots, and cabbage are common menu tenants).

They are currently in the process of expanding the business so expect longer hours during the coming summer. My friend and I had very fortunately stumbled upon Biergarten on our way to Chantal Guillon for macaroons, while waiting to be seated for dinner. Both of us decided to return after our dinner reservation for late night (~7pm) spirits and snacks. Although they were bustling with people around dinner time, the crowd began to thin down when we got there...so there was no line and plenty of blankets, seating available. And now I can proudly say that we were very happy with this decision!\n\nThere were 2 draft beers, 2 wines offerings that evening with several snacks. We decided on a white dessert wine, Pilsner and maple syrup bacon bread pudding to share. Everything was delicious, although the bread pudding was a little burnt at the bottom. Our Pilsner was big enough to be shared between the two of us. The warmly lit ambiance and complimentary blankets offered a nice shelter against the chilly winter night, overall making the scenery extremely sweet and comfortable...to the extent in which I ended up taking a short nap amidst our talking, snacking and drinking. Overall, it was the icing on top of great evening. Even though I didn't eat here...judging by the hungry bites my fellow customers were taking, the menus would definitely be worth exploring! The portions of their entrees may not filling enough for dinner but would serve as generous snacks to pair with drinks.

None of us had ever been, though we were all intrigued by the Yelp photos of mugs as big as our heads.\n\nWe got in line at about 2:45PM-2:50PM (right before they opened), and it had already just turned the corner on the block. They opened at 3PM on the dot, and people immediately either stampeded for the shady tables scattered through the courtyard or moved towards the beer line. By the time we got to the gate, most of the tables were already filled up, so we commandeered what looked like the only empty one left right by the gate itself.\n\nThen, we waited for our beers. It took us about 30 minutes before we even got to order. Not that I ever really mind having to wait, but I should be waiting for beers that I can't find anywhere else. The beers that Biergarten had on tap were ones that you could find at most good, local liquor shops. But whatever, we were here to enjoy the Biergarten for what it was.\n\nAt $7-10 a half liter and twice that for a full liter, and with food ranging from another $4-16 (from the knots to the baskets), Boyfriend and I ran up a $42 tab for a liter and a half of beer, a frankfurter with sauerkraut and a bratwurst with curried potatoes. Everything was yummy, but not mouthwateringly rave-worthy.\n\nOverall verdict: a very nice little spot with the potential to be very chill, but a little over-hyped.

There are plenty more bottles available if the beers on tap don't do it for you.\n\nAlthough when they first opened they did not have many food options they seem to have added to the menu. They have lots of small foods (pretzels, deviled eggs, chive bread, etc) to keep the beer company in your stomach. German sausages are also available if you want something larger but I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are looking for a meal though.\n\nThe line consistently looks long but it goes by really fast (5-10 minutes) and you can hop in line before you finish your last beer so you never go thirsty. The major downside is that it is not a very large place and the seating is limited so it can be tough to find a place to sit on a nice day, especially if you are in a group.\n\nClean bathrooms, pretty cool staff, descent crowd the times I went. Also, they have blankets to give out to people when the weather gets colder.", "author": "Frank J."}

And then they expect a tip!\n\nI'm Irish, so I know effective bar service and the duty a barman has not to make people wait. Employing some general efficiency in your work is a good start. And processing more than one order at a time is effective too; does however require the brainpower to remember more than one drink order.

But in the end, very few things bring as much joy as a liter of good beer with friends in the sunshine. In my book, all the beers are delightful. The razzler (a lemonade and beer mix) is a bit sweet and doesn't have enough alcohol content for me. Yes, this little girl CAN drink :)\n\nTip #1: If your doom is to wait in a line that wraps around the block (and I've been there before), make your time efficient by grabbing some snack foods from the snack stand (like a pretzel - they're pretty delicious) to make the wait go by faster. Also, waiting in line with friends is always a plus.\n\nTip #2: If you see that you have about a third of your liter beer left and you feel a tingling sensation in your bladder, be efficient with your time and drink the rest of your beer while you wait in line for the restroom. Sometimes the line for the restroom exceeds the line for beer!\n\nTip #3: SF weather is fickle. At 3:00, it may seem all sunshiny and warm, but when 5:30 rolls around, it'll be gray and cold, so be prepared and come with a jacket. If you forget and the beer isn't helping you keep warm, Biergarten staff goes around, handing out blankets! How awesome is that?!?!\n\nTip #4: Don't skimp on the beer.

It also reminds me of biergartens when I lived in Berlin. You order your food at the window and take it back to your communal picnic table. I always order litres or else I'd be made fun of. $16 for a litre of most beers and $8 for .5. They also bring in food from Suppenk\u00fcche from down the street. That's a huge plus.\n\nThe only drawback is the huge line. Since the place opens at 3:00pm, the line usually wraps around the corner by 2:50pm. The longest part of getting your drink will be waiting in line. If you come closer to sunset (also when it's colder), you'll get your drinks faster.

Cold SF weather. (insert something crummy about SF). Was I wrong!\n\nWhen I got here with my cousin and her friend I was expecting the line to stretch out into the sidewalk but it didn't, so the wait time was very reasonable. Also keep an eye out for a space opening up so you can sit down with your glorious liter of beer. When I went to order, the person working the taps was very friendly and helped me choose a beer, even offering me if I wanted to try some to make sure I would like it. \n\nWe all got a liter of Edelweiss and that was enjoyable. As for the food (I'm not sure if it was because I was hungry or not) we ordered the bratwurst with sauerkraut and that was pretty delish. Later we asked the server as he was cleaning up our trays what he would recommend. He said that the sliders (cow tongue and pork belly) were good. I was thrown off when he said cow tongue but I just bit the bullet and ate it. It was pretty delicious on my part. Never know unless you try...\n\nI also saw the reviews for Biergarten and saw some contradicting things. The one review saying they couldn't get a knife? There were knifes and forks a plenty! When we ran out of napkins we flagged down a server and he put in more napkins in the cup where it was organized with the forks and knives. And I'm not sick from the food...\n\nAlthough it was my first time there, some pro-tips to follow by the next time I go:\n1. Dress in layers (SF weather can get really cold and windy in an instant).\n2. If you start getting cold, they lend out blankets, but get them before they lend them all out! \n3. Just get the liter. Don't skimp out on yourself.\n3. It'll probably be better to come on a \"off\" day, as in Wednesday or Thursday probably when they open up or later in the evening.

But honestly, that'd probably fill this up really fast and there really isn't enough seats for such a big crowd.\n\nAs for the food... loved the bratwurst!  It comes with dijon mustard, horseradish that'll singe your nose hairs, and a giant heap of sauerkraut.  Though I was bit confused why it had sooo much liquid in the baskets it is served in.  That could be drained out a little better.  Brats are moist and flavorful.  The kraut was great!

The other beers are better. If you want to avoid the taste of beer, then the Radler is a nice compromise.\n\nAlso, cash only + the beer won't get you drunk.

We had an order of pickles and a pretzel while waiting in line, and later the sausages and sauerkraut. I'm guessing it was the latter that did us in. This is such a shame, because the food was surprisingly good. Fortunately, it was not too bad, and neither of us missed work.\n\nHad it not been for the incident with the food, I'd give this place 3.5 stars, maybe 4. The biggest problem is the lines. I don't mind waiting to get into the place (the guy at the door (the owner?) was really friendly and helpful), but you have to go back into that long line to order another beer, as there is no table service nor a separate line for customers already inside. I'd also deduct a 1/2 star for lack of variety. They had Schneider Weisse (yay!), but the other two beers were ok. The Radler is way too sweet for me, but that's a personal preference I suppose. Those were the only options the day we were there.\n\nSo my take on this place? If you don't mind the lines, this is a lovely place to spend a sunny afternoon. The communal outdoor benches are great. I'll personally avoid the food, but might be back for a beer. With Schmidt's and Walzwerk not far away, however, I might just go to one of those places to get a better selection of beer.", "author": "Brett L."}

The wait was well worth it minus the fact that they were out of 3/6 beers they had available. Given it is the end of Oktoberfest, they should have been more prepared especially since it was only about 6pm and they opened at 3pm earlier that day.\nAll that aside, I got myself a monster stein of Paulander Oktoberfest and I loved it. It's a pretty malty beer with slight hops, its an amber ale so expect it to be a little richer than a pilsner but less than a brown ale.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-05-13", "description": "Spent a lot of time standing in line for a beer whilst discussing San Franciscans predilection for standing in lines. Some places in this fair city are worth the wait -- Tartine and Bi-Rite Creamery come to mind -- but Biergarten is not one of them. While those other establishments create a product that is simply superior to other offerings in the city, Biergarten serves a limited selection of mediocre beer (it is German, after all) and good (not great) food. Special shout out to the delightfully pickled deviled eggs, and the pretzels are legit, but it's tough to justify some of the prices for the other menu items.\n\nI do really like the aesthetic of this place. Some people might get turned off because they feel like they're drinking beer in what amounts to a glorified parking lot, but I think it has an inviting, urban park charm. It benefits from a thoughtful, modern industrial architecture where the kitchen, bar, and bathrooms are all built in giant gray shipping containers (very cool), the tables are simple and sturdy, and the openness of the space affords ample people watching. \n\nBut man, that line! Would you go to a bar if I told you that you had to wait thirty minutes every time you wanted another beer? I doubt it. The food is better than the beers at this place, and the food line is generally short and easy to navigate, but you want your beer to keep flowing if you're settling in for an afternoon at a place like this, and it just doesn't. Some reviewers think it's a glaring operational problem, but I'm quite sure the management likes it the way it is. Why would they feel the need to change their service style if there is a never ending 30+ minute line full of patrons willing to wait it out? It undoubtedly creates turnover at the tables and helps to keep customers drunkenness levels in check. \n\nI love outdoor day drinking as much as the next guy, and there is obviously serious demand at this place. I just think I'll take my talents to someplace like Zeitgest or Lucky 13 instead and head back to order my second (much tastier) beer from the bar as quickly as it would take you to get one less flavorful offering from Biergarten.

I'm always in the mood to go to Biergarten, but then I see the line wrapping around the gates and I end up ditching that plan and going somewhere else. If you do manage to secure a table at Biergarten- first of all, congratulations. That's amazing. Secondly- yes, the prices are a bit steeper than one what expect for an outdoor bar, but the beers are good, the service is quick, and the pork belly sliders are delicious! Also- don't even think of driving here because you'll have better odds of winning the lottery than you will finding a parking spot in Hayes Valley. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, because the negative aspects of Biergarten (like the wait,crowds, lack of parking) are not really specific to the bar, but to the neighborhood itself.

They'll have something for everyone's beer taste buds from dark to light. It's a little lot but man do they know how to utilize what little amount of space they have, it's San Francisco so go figure! There's a bunch of picnic tables for you to sit at with friends with lights that they have strung over head for when it gets darker, there's something about those lights that makes sitting out more magical.

Yes they hand out blankets, but how can you hold a stein, a bratwurst AND a little blanket and not begin to question ... why the hell am I sitting out here? I would rather just go to Suppenk\u00fcche indoors where it is warm and the same super nice people are too. I know it's about being seen and people watch, but I don't need that.
