I was in SF for the weekend on the look out for anywhere with good music and a decent crowd, unfortunately in was a Sunday night. Walking down 16th street, Double Dutch was  the one place with good music bumpin. To be honest the bar was empty when I walked in with only a few people inside but as the night transitioned a few more people showed up and that's when the energy changed. It wasn't packed by any means but a couple guinea pigs were the first on the dance floor and before you know it there most of the people ended up on the floor. The DJ seemed to be practicing for most of the night but once people got on the dance floor, he picked up on the energy and matched the music with the dancers. This Sunday night DJ played roughly 1 minute or so from each track so on occasion early in the night there would be a transition from fast to slow that really interrupted the vibe. But...with the crowd on the floor he did a nice good of keeping the energy up. My Sunday night was shaping up to be pretty dull but Double Dutch was able to keep my Sunday night respectable among the many sleepy Sunday night bars I walked by on 16th.", "author": "Sean F."}

If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.\n\nI was out this past Saturday night with a group of friends and on a whim we decided to check out Double Dutch, HUGE regret. When we got there it was quiet, but within an hour the place was so packed that people were basically on top of each other/running into each other left and right. Let me start by saying-I am OVERLY careful with my belongings when I am out in public, so I am the LAST person this should have happened to. So credit to the real pros at double dutch stealing phones (which like many have said before, I wouldn't be surprised if it were the employees working there based on their lack of remorse and unwillingness to help). My phone was stolen WHILE in my possession, meaning there was not a single moment I set my belongings down.\n\nWhen I realized my phone had been stolen, I searched the place high and low to no avail. The DJ couldn't stop his set for 10 seconds to make an announcement because his boss would \"kill him\". The bartender responded with complete disinterest and said \"you can leave your number if you want but it's probably pointless\" and \"there's literally nothing I can do for you\". And the bouncer said it happens ALL the time and blamed me for not reading the tiny sign in the front window that says \"beware of pickpocketers\".\n\nDISGUSTING customer service, EVEN WORSE experience. I will NEVER be back, and I will warn everyone I know not to waste their time at Double Dutch. I hope this place gets shut down for unethical practice, pickpocketing happens all too frequently at this place and they have done nothing to prevent it from continuing.", "author": "Jenny E."}

I don't know how it's possible there are only like, 2 stalls when this place is consistently packed but if you can imagine how many people are going in/out there in one night I'm sure you can see why it gets so gross. There is a dance floor but it's packed to capacity most all the times I'm there and despite there being a couple fans around the room, the ventilation is almost non-existent.

I am a female and had previously been wearing a hat, but was told by the doorman that security \"may\" ask me to take it off inside. I took it off and eventually put it on back inside when I saw 5 or 6 other people wearing hats that security was not asking to remove. Some time goes by and someone starts flashing a bright light in my face, considering I was being blinded, I assumed someone was taking a video. My friend puts her arm out to block the light and the security guard proceeds to throw his arms up and sends my drink flying up in the air, causing it to dump all over me. He grabs my female friend by the right arm and starts aggressively shaking her. I yell at him to let her go and he turns to me and finally says \"No wearing hats in here\".  I tell him \"Okay that is fine\" and proceed to take off my hat. My friends and I immediately left the club, considering one of us was just physically assaulted by a security guard. My friend who was assaulted by the guard now has a giant bruise on her arm from where he grabbed her & I was covered in my drink after he caused it to pour all over me. This was my first time at this club, and certainly the last time.

Even at 12:30am they had a $5 cover charge. The security was very biased. Letting in friends without checking IDs, waiving cover charges in front of people waiting in line to pay. Holding up the line to say what's up to passerbys. It was a little disrespectful and made me want to take my business elsewhere. I know this kind of stuff happens everywhere, but you don't have to blatantly shove it in others faces that you're getting the hook up or preventing business from entering. \n\nThe place was packed so the dancing was very smushed. Some people like that, I don't. Drinks were averagely priced and pretty strong which is a good sign of a strong hand. Atmosphere is casual with the population about mid to late twenties. Decor is 80s Bboy, boomboxes, kangol hats and cardboard. It was well done to bring you back to a simpler time when disagreements were handled by dance battles instead of world star hip hop videos.\n\nThe music started okay. By okay I mean they had the good throwback jams that bring you back to a time before clubs were all EDM. It made you feel good and you just couldn't help your body from moving to the beat. Then the DJ starting doing shout outs and playing random songs nobody was feeling. Maybe he was trying to help his homie out by playing his new track, or he was trying to go underground. Regardless, it was apparent the DJ was not feeling the room and was just spinning for himself and a few friends. Eventually it was too much and we ended up calling it an earlier night.

I finally got the chance to go to this small ass bar and small ass dance floor since we had dinner at Picaro a block away.\n\nParking\nThis is located in the Mission and parking is friggin impossible. You literally have to circle for dayzzz but luckily me and two other cars were able to find parking. Trust but make sure you pick a restaurant and post activities in the same area because you do no want to repark.

He said cover is $5 and its after 11pm. When he said the time, it seemed iffy like if you made it a little after then it is ok or if the line is super long then maybe you have to pay? It seems all dependent on how happy he is that day haha.

There is no coat check so you have to hold onto your shit. I noticed a lot of people wear jeans shirts and jacket so it is a super chill setting where you dont dress up. I sorta felt weird wearing a skirt but thank you baby jesus I did. It is friggin hot on the dance floor. Sweaty sauna status where I had to go home and shower and shiz. It may be cold at night but you will thank me if you have a shirt and shorts or something. Even dudes can wear casual shorts.\n\nPlace/Crowd\nThis place reminded me of Raven..but a smaller version. You literally walk in and you can see the end of the place. There is a small bar area and you walk to the back to the small dance floor which is comparable to the Raven dance floor size. I guess I expected more of a dance club than a bar but obvs its a bar. There are stools at the bar and a few tables along the edges so that is nice. You can get some of that AC at the bar and some water from the bartender. The crowd is also mixed. I guess it is what you expect since it is located in the Mission. Since we got there sorta early, we were pretty much the only asians there but then filipinos and what not came in when we left. We sure do love our hip hop music. Which brings me to....\n\nMUSIC!\nUMPH. I love me some hip hop and r&b. Like I said, it plays similar music to Raven but it is more of the ghetto ratchet side with lil jon e40 tyga and stuff. The DJ...who will now be my best friend. I wanted to see if I could build a similar relationship to my Raven DJ who lets me request my usual songs but plays them a bit later. So I asked this guy if I could hear Too Close, Return of the Mack (and then he thought I was done but I thought lemme test this playa), Dont Tell Em, and Ayo. I was like yeahhhh thats a good set list. He said yeah I already play these songs and my eyes widened with excitement that we would be best friends. Just one song later, I hear Too Close and I obvs get super excited. I was like hayyyyyyyyy. Then right after was Return of the Mack and I thought, OH NO HE DIDNTTT. I expected him to mix it up and lo and behold Dont Tell Em comes on and at this point my heart is exploding. My friends and I are like there is no way he will do all four of my songs back to back....and we just waited to the end of Jeremih.......and BAM. Ayo comes one and I explode once again. I point my finger at the DJ and say thank you DJ!! Obvs he didnt hear me but I am sure he felt my happy good vibes. Umph. This DJ has a good memory or he sure likes to make his people happy.

If your itching for a low key club with tribute to early 80s Hip-hop, this must be it! Everything from the Photographs placed on the wall, to the decor of used boom boxes which have seen their lives come to an end, from a block party or Breakdance battle. The place is decent sized, drinks are modest at best. You are coming here mostly to dance with your friends, and listen to cool vibes and have someone spill a drink on your new shoes and it be partly crowded. This place is like the hidden gem, or little sister to the Milk Bar in haight street. Milk bar use to give off this incredible vibe that supported hip-hop without being too commercial or overcrowded. Ladies and Gentleman I give you double dutch. A place crowded enough on a weekend night, but still cool and laid back enough not to have any riff raff, or no nonsense.", "author": "Michael R."}

People at the door seemed cool... But the music wasn't. At least to me it didn't match the vibe of the place. I expected classic or golden era hip hop but instead it was all radio play & other Vegas club type music. So I was a bit confused on that... Maybe I came there on the wrong night.

The doorman's obligatory search of our bags was one of my favorite moments of the night.\n\nThe bar was small and a little dingy, but I liked the eclectic decor.  It featured walls covered in stereo facades, and plenty of neon and sneakers completed the consciously '90s vibe.  The music was sort of in tune with that aesthetic, and we left after a drink because the bachelorettes wanted more danceable music.  Fair enough. The dance floor was tiny and more or less empty.\n\nWe stayed long enough for me to buy a shot for one of our bachelorettes.  Two shots of well vodka cost $14, and they were served cold and smooth.  Not bad.  The bar also looked pretty well stocked, with a decent selection of most liquors.  Service was friendly and fast.\n\nI did not enjoy the cramped bathroom.  I am not super particular about cleanliness, but the floor was wet, and that is always disgusting when you're in a sliver of a room where all people do is release fluid and solid waste into the world.\n\nWe left pretty fast, but there was no cover and the bar was serviceable enough.

I'm too old to be cramped into a small, wet sweatbox with crazy dancing people who don't respect my personal space! Where there's a $20 minimum for drinks at the bar and just two co-ed bathroom stalls meaning a line spills out onto the dance floor. A dance floor where I'm TRYING to dance, because the music here is actually pretty sick and my friends and I stupidly went all the way to the back thinking there'd be more room there, but nope, it was just a 120-degree sauna, people up in my personal bubble, and folks waiting in line for the bathroom. If this place were bigger, I probably wouldn't complain so much. I love the hip hop music which spans several decades, as well as the clever interior decorating.

The dance floor is really tiny and there are only two bathrooms, but everyone makes it work. No one is pretentious or lecherous - quite the opposite really. I went hoarse from shouting \"I LOVE THIS SONG, THIS IS MY JAM, I LOVE THIS DJ\" for every other song because damn, I really loved the songs, they really were my jams from the 90s, and I did love whatever dj was spinning last night.

People were going out the back door and I opened it to let cold air in for 2 seconds then turned around to continue dancing with my friends. Next thing I knew I was being aggressively yanked and thrown around outside in the back by a bartender. I was not drunk, I was completely complying with him and he kept yelling and pushing me around. I currently have 3 large bruises on my arm from this man (he was maybe 5'9 and has a red beard). I am not a small man (6ft 200 lbs) but he was extremely abusive when I was not even fighting him back or anything. He continued to yell and push/shove me down the alley way until I was on the street. When I asked him why I was getting thrown out all he said was \"because you opened the f****** door\". If I would have known that it wasn't allowed obviously I wouldn't have done it. He could have pulled me out and said, hey don't open this door, and boom, guess what? I wouldn't have done it again. The staff needs to learn to not just assault people for doing such minuscule things.\n\nI understand that I am no saint in this situation, but for getting yanked/shoved/yelled at for opening a door that people were opening throughout the night was a bit ridiculous. The staff here needs to be taught that you can't just try to manhandle people for doing things that everyone was doing during the night. For anyone that goes to this bar, please be careful about the staff. They will take abuse you and no even second guess it at all.\n\nAnother side note: The bathrooms. I've been to many bars throughout Europe and America, this place is in a league of their own when it comes to a dirty bathroom. Easily the most disgusting bathroom I have ever been in. The floor was literally one giant puddle and I felt like I was going to get a disease just walking in there. Also, beware of pick pocketers.

I am on a neverending search in San Francisco for the best hip hop club or bar and I had been suggested this place a few times. \n\nI have to admit the music was pretty great and I did appreciate the consistency of the dj we had on a Friday night. The music ranged from old school hip hop from the 90's to some of the current hits of today without the constant EDM interruption that I am used to in SF clubs. \n\nA 5 dollar cover will get you in which is cheap as a guy in this city. There weren't a ton of people there when I went but I could see this place getting crowded and sweaty quickly. It was really cool to see people genuinely having fun in a place. Most clubs and bars people seem like they hate being out and are usually staring agrily at people while they drink. \n\nHere people got on the dance floor and jumped around which was great to see. \nThe biggest issue though is that dance floor. That is just too small for any functional dancing. They do embrace it there but its just too tight a space to really enjoy it for me. Some people like being that close to others and constantly banging into each other but I passed on that. \n\nEventually we left around 11:30 to check out other bars in the mission as this place didn't hold our attention for too long. \n\nIf you are into the dive bar feel and want to dance i recommend it. No club vibes here and no long lines and ridiculous cover charges and girls might actually not get hit on every two minutes here. Just not my favorite.", "author": "Nick R."}

Great music, cool spot, but don't go there unless you want to get robbed.\n\nThis past weekend, FOR THE SECOND TIME, I had my cell phone stolen out of my purse while on the dance floor at Double Dutch. The first time was around 4 years ago and I deliberately wore something much more secure this time - a zippered bag, right on my hip - but in the crush of the dance floor I still didn't notice someone unzipping my bag and removing my phone.\n\nLest you think I'm careless with my phones: in the 15 years I have been using cell phones, in which I have carried them all over the world traveling, the ONLY times I have had any phone stolen was these two times at Double Dutch! And after telling my friends about this I discovered that many of them have been robbed or nearly robbed at DD, as well. The management, when I went to ask about my phone, admitted that it happens a lot there.\n\nAnd of course I realize that the management isn't to blame for this. But they don't have a coat check so they're not doing anything to make the theft that goes on there harder to pull off.\n\nSuch a shame because Double Dutch is one of the most fun places to go dancing in the Mission. The DJs are always solid, the drinks are reasonably priced and the bartenders are really nice. But I'll never be going there again.", "author": "Allison B."}

Those days are long gone, but a trip to Double Dutch definitely took me on a trip down memory lane.   \n\nDouble Dutch normally isn't my scene as I prefer to go to more upscale lounges and places less crowded, however, it was the most FUN I've had in a LONG, LONG, LONG time.\n\nOn Friday, 6.3.11, my friends and I arrived a little after 11 PM. Parking in the area is HORRIBLE, so definitely carpool or take a cab. Double Dutch was packed and there was a line to get in. \n\nWalking into Double Dutch was totally nostalgic, from the graffiti painted walls, the wall stacked with of old boom boxes, B-boy pics and retro kicks on display to the Double Dutch Lite-Brite sign.  It brought back some embarrassing yet fond memories like being caught by my mom while lip-syncing Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" with my crop top, neon colored leggings and my teased bangs cemented with bottles of Aquaspray. Ahhh, those were the days. \n\nAlthough Double Dutch is small, narrow, and divey with just one bar, 3 booths and small dance floor it surely doesn't lack personality. The friendly bartenders made drinks that packed a big punch. It normally takes me about 6 shots to get a good buzz, but 3 Goose Tonics ($7 each) had me BUZZIN'!\n\nThe crowd was diverse, fun, and lively. It was like a melting pot of SF; you have your Marina Elites, SoMa Hipsters, Thugs and Asian Bookworms/Wanna-Be Gangstas/Fobs which was a welcome change from the typical Asian scene I'm use to where people huddle around in their cliques, camera whoring it with their double peace signs. \n\nThe thing that I absolutely LOVE about Double Dutch is the CRACKIN' MUSIC!!! The DJ was spinning Hip Hop and Throwbacks with some Top 40s thrown in the mix. My feet were killing me (as usual) but the music was so good it got me on the dance floor; well, actually my friends may have had something to do with it.    \n\nLately, I've been bored at clubs/lounges and end up wanting to leave even before last call. However, when the lights turned on at 1:45 AM, I was actually bummed it was almost time to go. \n\nOTHER THINGS TO NOTE:\n*No Cover\n*No Dress code\n*$20 Min for CC\n*One dingy bathroom each for ladies and men\n*LADIES: Beware of Creepers: Some guy massaged my head as I was trying to walk through the dance floor. Dude, we're not at a rave!\n*The bouncer is a power-tripping douche. Mr. X, Double Dutch is a bar not XS.\n*If you go out for fresh air or for a smoke, you will have to wait in line again.\n\nCheap, Strong Drinks, Great Music and Fun Crowd...what else more can a girl ask for?

In fact, when I arrived at the bar I thought it was really cool and authentic. He was Caucasian, bald with tattoos, fit, and around his mid-thirties. This man had a vendetta against me from the moment I walked into the bar. It was Wednesday, May 31st, 2017, and I was in San Francisco. He was rude to me from the beginning when I simply asked what beers were on tap because there was no draft list and I was having trouble seeing the handles! After receiving my drink from the mean bartender, I asked to close out my tab. He informed me that there was a $14 minimum when two minutes beforehand he had told my friend who was with me that there was a $12 minimum. I would like to add that I was 100 percent sober when arriving at the bar and throughout the evening because he was purposefully not serving me. His attitude towards me was that terrible that even my friends around me were astounded as to why he was acting that way with me and not them. After closing out my tab and walking away from the bar, he flicked me off with both fingers. I decided that I was going to leave after I finished my red stripe beer because he was making me feel so uncomfortable. After some time, I decided to go outside for a smoke with a friend of mine. When I started to proceed towards the door where I was going to put my FULL red stripe that I had just purchased on the ledge by the door, he grabbed me from behind with both hands, gripped onto my arms aggressively, took the beer out of my hands, and poured it all out into the trashcan. I was extremely frightened and startled, asked him, \"Excuse me, OUCH! Is there some sort of problem here?\" He told me to \"get the fuck out of my bar and to not come back.\" Even minutes after leaving the bar and standing outside, I could still feel his intense grip on my arms stinging and started to cry in front of my friends who knew how he had been treating me the entire time. I should have gone straight to the manager after this incident, but I was way too frightened to go back inside; afraid that he would put his hands on me again and that this time it would be worse. If anything, I should be refunded for the drink that he fully poured out for no reason and the manager of this bar should fully explain to me why a man so rude and violent is working at this establishment. Not only was I not causing any disruption, but I was nothing but kind to the people of the establishment. It is extremely unsettling that a bartender who is in the service industry dealing with customers day and night is treating an innocent, harmless, and sober guest this way.", "author": "Kelly K."}

Though it has many of the characteristics of a good dive bar (and I do love a good dive), it has somehow shied away from the dive bar aesthetic and become trapped in the hipster purgatory between dive bar and club. Instead of embracing its somewhat small, dingy space and providing good, cheap drinks, and good music, they've tried to class up the decor with hipstery 80's memorabilia, and a packed dance floor with mediocre music.\n\nDon't be fooled by the cover charge for guys and the occasional attractive lady standing outside; this place is still a sausage-fest (again, the cover charge puts this place out of dive bar territory, and makes it feel pretentious, but it obviously hasn't improved the bar's aesthetic or turned it into a fun club- its just somewhere in the middle). Double Dutch is packed to the brim on weekends (again, mostly with bros), to the point where there's very little standing room, let alone space to let loose and dance. Getting to the bar is difficult at best, and the staff obviously work hard to deal with the crowd, but the wait for a drink is inevitably long.\n\nI suppose Double Dutch isn't terrible, but its just not that great either. Personally, I think its neither a comfortable place to spend time, nor a fun place to have a raging night out, which means its just not worth the cover charge, or my time.", "author": "Zameer A."}

Any other day it's dead or overly crowded with poorly dressed men and women who can't dance and spill their adios' on you. \n\nCome in on a Sunday night - Walk in and turn up. Sometimes it's not that easy!! I've had several types of black-outs here:\n\n1. TRAP(shot)TRAP(shot)TRAP(shot)TRAP(shot)TRAP(shot) - leave.\n\n2. Fight a meth head, TRAP(shot)TRAP(shot)TRAP(shot)TRAP(shot)TRAP(shot) - leave.\n\n3. Pretend to be a lesbian, TRAP(shot)TRAP(shot)TRAP(shot)TRAP(shot)TRAP(shot) - leave.\n\n4. And hands down, my grandest black-out to date occurred here after The Do-Over this summer. HOLY FUCK!!!!!!!!!! LMAO. It went like this: Blunt(shot)TRAP(shot)Molly and repeat -_- Point is I fell asleep in the bathroom and lost my cellphone, wallet and keys. The bartender was so sweet and patient. I was a raging bitch, I don't know how I got home but I woke up in my bed fully dressed and accessorized, laying on a pile of  Dorito chip crumbs. \n\nA couple days later (after regrouping from embarrassment) I showed up at DD right when they opened and the bartender was happy to see me lol. After all the drama, he was glad I was alive and had all my belongings ^_^\nHe told me how it went down and we had a good laugh about it. So, I highly recommend this place. \n\nDo as I say, not as I do, kids. \n\n\nxo,\n\nTrap or Die.", "author": "Lydia L."}

Overall great place, nice people, but the bouncer was a true jerk. I have never been treated so rudely in my life.\n\n It was halloween, my birthday, and i had waited in line with some friends. The bouncer was hitting on my friend as we come through. After being there for over an hour my boyfriend and I step out for air. Upon attempting to reenter, the bouncer asks for our stamps (after having seen us come out earlier). We never got stamps for whatever reason. I ask the people in line if I came from inside, they agree. He says I snuck in, (which, first of all, means he isn't paying attention as bouncer). He asks the stamp person if he recognizes us;  the stamp person agrees we waited and paid, so he stamps us. When we attempt to come in, he stops us and forces us to show him our ids. As we hand them to him, I let him know that it is my birthday and I've been in there over an hour. He says I have an attitude and may not enter ON MY BIRTHDAY After being in there for over an hour maybe 2. He tries to kick us out, I let him know my I cannot leave without my card, which annoys him more. \n\nThe security pulls me aside and checks on me. He even apologizes, gets my card for me, and apologizes again as I'm leaving. \n\nAs far as I'm concerned, a bouncer should be able to easily located your id, not stare at it trying to figure it out. If you are so concerned about your ego, maybe get better at your job. If I snuck in with a group of people in a place with only one door, that means you suck at your job. Kicking someone out. Who never did anything wrong and followed all the rules, on their birthday and making them cry Is disrespectful. Even the rest of the staff felt bad.

On Friday, August 10th 2012 -- not so much. First off, $5 cover for the guys in our group of friends -- odd, but we'll let it slide. We get in, get some drinks, start dancing. It was probably less than 10 minutes when a fight broke out right in front of us in the middle of the dance floor. The music slowly faded but the fight continued -- where the hell was security? It took forever and by the time they arrived, it was 1 giant black dude and 1 midget Mexican bar-back/busser. The ruckus continued as security could not keep things under control and were having a hard time escorting the guys out -- not to mention, another fight seemed to be breaking out, or the previous fight was expanding to a larger group.\n\nSomewhere in the mix, my friend shouted that her wallet had just been stolen -- I asked her if she was sure and she explained she felt someone reach into her purse and quickly snatch it. She said he was heading out the door so I chased after him. Wouldn't you know it, security stopped me halfway telling me to back up -- I believe they thought I was trying to fight with the men being kicked out from the brawl. I explained succinctly that my friend's wallet had just been stolen and the thief was heading out the front door at that very moment -- his response? \"IT HAPPENS.\" I demanded he move out of my way, screaming at him to, \"KICK ME OUT, I WANT TO LEAVE, THROW ME OUT\" -- finally he obliged but by the time I got out there, my friend said she could no longer see the man who stole her wallet. \n\nThe security guard/bouncer and I got into it after that. I blamed him for lack of proper security -- I mean for hell's sake, I told him a crime was taking place inside the club he's supposed to help keep safe and instead of chasing after the thief or AT LEAST letting me thru to deal with it myself, he threw his arms up in the air and basically said, TOUGH SHIT. All he could keep doing is pointing to the sign posted outside of the club that said something along the lines of, \"PICK-POCKETTING HAPPENS HERE FREQUENTLY\" -- basically, you're at your own risk here. I didn't see the sign going in but if you don't see it, hopefully you see this review. Stay away. I believe 2 more fights spilled into the sidewalk/streets right after this -- one involving a girl getting hit in the head with a bottle and police showing up.

We are aware that sometimes this happens at certain clubs so instead of spending more time trying to convince the guy checking IDs to let her in, I suggested to my friends that we leave and find someplace else to  dance since it was getting late. Well this didn't sit too well with ID guy who first proceeded to enter our private conversation and then tell my friend that it was MY FAULT that we weren't getting in. I was confused by his absurd statement because first off I don't work there - I don't make decisions about who gets in, he does and secondly, he had already let me and few other friends in minutes earlier so I'm pretty sure I wasn't the reason for my friend getting denied. \n\nBut it gets worst because he then proceeded to yell at me as I was walking away that I had a \"big mouth.\" I was baffled.  My friends were completely baffled as well. I almost have to wonder if he was intoxicated because I've heard an employee say anything like that to me. I also have to wonder if he would have still said that to me if we were with guys (my guess is probably not). He was trying to intimate me which unfortunately for him, did not work.  As we started to walk away, he called my friend back and said he'd let us in. I think it's because people in line started to talk about what was going on....bad business 101.  \n\nI could  really care less about going in at that point however my friends really wanted to dance so I approached the ID guy to ask what the situation was. I proceeded to ask if were cool but before I could finish my sentence he literally yelled at me to \"shut the fuck up.\" Once again, he was trying to intimidate me and more thank likely feel like a big man since he had already made a huge fool of himself throughout this whole ordeal. I was baffled for the last time and walked away immediately. So in the end, 7 people who were willing to spend a decent amount of money on a good night out just left. \n\nThe owner or hiring manager of this place should be made aware that they are losing businesses because of this guy (small black guy checking IDs on the night of July 19th).

Somehow this concept is lost here. People were dressed to the OG's, drinking their usuals, but there is no lounge, no booths, no bottle service and the bathroom is completely blocked by the dance floor. The bartenders were dressed the way I'd expect, but white T's and white sole's had me on edge and hand on my edc pocket knife.

I wish there was more cooling near the dance floor.\n\nDrinks are well made, I feel like they're either perfect or on the heavy side with the liquor.  I haven't come on a night that I really liked the DJ, I prefer the music at Blondie's Bar and No Grill which is 16th and Valencia.  I normally hit up both clubs in the same night when I am out in this area.\n\nWhenever I come to Double Dutch I end up making new friends for the night, and I don't consider myself that talkative a person.  \n\nI give the place 3 stars because it can be fun, but it's hard to walk around, especially if you're trying to get back to the bar for another drink.", "author": "Dawn H."}

I did, however, swing by earlier this afternoon... and I had a fabulous time.\n\nFirst off, like most of the bars in the Mission, it's dog friendly. I think it's so cool that a majority of the dives in the 'hood let your dog hang with you while you get your swerve on. My pup is seemingly always the worst behaved animal in bars like these, but it's a new world for him and we're hoping he learns to summmmmmmma donnnnnnnn-NA sooner than later... but I digress.\n\nI'm going go out on a limb and say that Sunday and Monday are the two best nights to experience the 'Dutch. All day, they offer a pint of Trumer Pilsner and a shot of Jameson for $5. Really breathe that in and let it resonate for a moment, as $5 is a complete steal for two high quality products like Trumer and Jameson. Insane! \n\nThey also do Wii bowling tournaments on Sunday/Monday, and everyone who sits down at the bar gets a complimentary glass of crunchy Cheetos. What's not to love?\n\nThe bathrooms are pretty gross if you're a girl looking to reliever herself, but I'm assuming it's got something do with the NY, graffiti, hip-hop scene they have going on. I might be completely wrong, but I have a feeling the tagging was intentional to give it a gritty feel, so maybe it's not as bad as it might seem. Speaking of the hip-hop, break dancing vibe, you gotta scope out the walls and check out the old school boom boxes that line the interior. Either these guys scored big time on EBAY, or they raided Grandmaster Flash's storage facility, because these vintage stereos are dope! So jealous!\n\nI'd love to see what happens to this place on a busy Friday or Saturday night. From other reviews I've read, it looks as though the weekend warriors spoil any chance of a good time, but that's yet to be experienced. Wish me luck!", "author": "Ruggy J."}

So me and a group of friends arrive at this place on a Saturday night sometime between 1 am and 1:15.  There was a 5 dollar cover to get in.  Half the group was split on going in because of the cover (not because of the 5 but because of how little time we would have actually spent in there).  I was willing to pay it however my ride home wasn't. Fine OK at that point in the night a ride home is more important then going to another bar especially when you have to wake up early the next morning (which I didn't anyways).  So I step out of line to leave with a couple other people and next thing I know the bouncer is yelling at me where am I going why am I leaving.  Excuse me Mr bouncer who looked like he was actually just pocketing the cover himself that is none of your business and not professional at all.  Because of that I'm never going to actually come to this place and actually check out the inside of it.\n\nOnly reason I gave two instead of one is that from the outside I did enjoy hearing the music that was actually being played.", "author": "Ricky K."}

Likely a moderate amount of Fernet is in my system and I can hear faint hip hop in the recesses of my mind, like a siren's song saying \"Jusssttiiiiinnnn, come shake your asssssss... drink more tooooooo....\" \n\nSure, it is smaller and packed every damn weekend, but the vibe reminds me of house parties from back in the day so maybe it's nostalgia. 100 degrees, music thumping, and wall to wall people letting loose and dancing until the lights pop on. I know I dig this spot because every time those obnoxious lights do come on I'm genuinely bummed that it's over.\n\nI can't comment on the booze selection because frankly I'm toasted and focusing 100% of my remaining brain power on dancing with some fine ladies.

On some nights, you'll have to wait up to 20 minutes to walk into the door, and once you do, you'll be standing there the whole night due to the crowding issue. I refrain from venturing in any deeper than I have to, just  because I enjoy some breathing room. The \"dance floor\" is located in the back, but really, on busy nights, you'll only have enough space to stand and maybe sway back and forth or wiggle your arms a little -- not much dancing though. And whoever decided to put the bathrooms in the back..not very smart engineering. The time you can spend dancing is instead spent moving out of people's way as they walk to and from the very small and dirty restrooms. Word to the wise..get stamped and use the bathroom across the street at Elixir. \n\nGenerally speaking, their drinks are between $6-10 for mixed drinks or shots.

Rather, this place is the DMZ between drunk and blackout, and should be visited when strange and tiny men in fedoras seem manly and rugged, like Indiana Jones outpacing a giant rolling ball, and awkward women in too much melty make-up and too little clothing take on a sultry and mysterious mien. Otherwise--and I tell you this from experience--you will pass the bulk of your time sweating, and counting the sneaker-doodles on the walls, and waiting stoically at the bar in order to acquire as many shots as possible, to take the edge off being poked and prodded and stared up at by the improbable number of dudes shorter than me who are just sort of milling around and/or doing the sneaky backdoor grind-up on the five or six women churning viscously on the dancefloor. \n\nMy standard scotch ran me $10 and Don Julio tequila shots were $9 a pop. As I said, unless you are willing to drink endless cans of obscure two dollar beer--which, admittedly, many people were--this is not somewhere you go to get drunk. \n\nI'm sure Double Dutch can effectively facilitate dancing wildly to old school hip hop, while giggling, and intimately acquainting your buttocks with a stranger's groin or vice versa, but you have to have the right mindset for all of this, and that mindset is \"close to complete loss of brain function,\" which is not something that appeals to the all-new Laura Who Has Shit to Do Tomorrow Morning anymore.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTwo dollar beers.", "author": "Laura T."}

There was fighting then it stopped, fighting again, then stop, fight stop...where was security?  Barely making their way.  As we saw security arriving, my friend screamed that someone just took her wallet.  So my friends and I (boys and girls), tried to chase after the guy. But the security guards ended up stopping us.  They tried to kick out one of my friends who they believed was in the fight, but really was one of the few actually trying to stop it.  Then they got in a really heated argument with another one of my friends who was trying to pass by them to chase after the guy.

Within 2 minutes of being outside another fight shoots out from the Double Dutch doors.  This time a girl got a bottle to the head.  I'm assuming jealous girlfriends shit.\n\nMy one time guaranteed good time bar is now polluted with violence and misdemeanor.  I am officially retiring Double Dutch from my bar repertoire.

Double Dutch was filled with Mission hipsters and those who you could tell, did not live in the area (aka me). If you get here early enough you can score a table along the side or grab a seat at the bar.

Two, when its cracking in here, everyone is a Hot Mess because its too damn crowded. And three, there's usually one person I see wearing something I bought or at least considered buying from H&M at some point in my life.  \n\nBeing a former sneakerhead, Double Dutch immediately brought back a feeling of nostalgia and how much of a hypebeast I was not too long ago. Whenever I look at my black and red lowtop Jordan 1s, I think of the ones hanging over the bear next to the picture of two people in daisy dukes jumping rope. I also look at the very well painted mini mural of a collection of sneakers I wish I owned, from the Jordan 11s to the infrared air max 90s. Any sneakerhead would greatly appreciate this place for its novelty. \n\nAs for the place itself, it gets too crowded in here on a weekend. One minute you're outside taking in the cold San Francisco air with your hoody, and the next minute you walk into the bar and you're sweating like crazy. Hello sickness. The huge crowd is good for the bar, but there's hardly any room to move around. Having no cover and a casual dress code is a huge plus though. \n\nI can usually count on this place being a go to spot in the Mission when I feel like chillin in the area and not having to pay cover to a venue where some douchebag and a wannabe Asian thug fight over a spilled drink, thus closing the club down early. Then again the diverse crowd in the Mission could call for that too, but like I said, no cover.

I went a few weeks ago, and it was just packed to the gills with what I can only describe as B&T folks--and I'm from Berkeley. Anyway, the vibe was far from the chill, hip place I'd been to a few times previously. OK, I know, what should I expect at a Mission bar close to 16th St. But still, it was a pretty cool place just a few months ago. The point is, my girlfriend and I were in and out the door within 20 minutes.\n\nOne key problem: NO DJ!! On a Saturday night!! This problem is further compounded by the fact that this place still has one of the most amazing DJ booths in town. Note to the owners: having a DJ, not just a cool DJ booth, is really important for setting a party vibe, even if it's just for background music. Also, you should invest in a better sound system, because what you've got isn't hacking it at all.\n\nThe punch line is that I have to downgrade this place severely. Back to searching for a no-cover bar in the Mission to go to before the clubs heat up...\n\n****************************************************\n\nI've been here a couple times now, and I'd say it makes for a nice pre-game spot. As people have mentioned, it has an old-school hip hop theme to it, although you'd be hard-pressed to know that from the clientele. Cool layout, with a nice patio in the back. It is a bit strange that the bathrooms are right off the dance floor, so you have a queue set up right where people are trying to get their groove on.\n\nIt has the absolute coolest DJ booth of all time, with the wall of ghetto blasters behind it. Too bad they don't always have a DJ there, like the last time I went there. When the DJ was there, I was totally down with the music, but mostly because I was spotting all the tunes I had on my iPod (cool, I know this one...I know that one too...and that one...and that one!!). I think I was getting on my friends' nerves after a while of that. But I digress...\n\nDrinks were good and reasonably priced (relatively speaking, of course).

There's plenty of space in the entryway, the aisle down the bar is wide enough to not create a bottleneck, and a moderately sized open space near the back would be a great dancefloor.

On the weekends, Double Douche rears his ugly head. \n\nDouble Dutch: 4 stars \n\n1. Great decor and ambiance: Think of New York in 1984, when the b-boys and hip hop ruled. Classic Adidas and ghetto blasters adorn the walls, while neon chandeliers give the place a red/yellow hue. Makes you just want to lay down the cardboard and get down wit your bad selves Mr. Rogers style. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xatZgEZ62fU \n\n2. Bartenders are fast and attentive. Huge plus is that they will accept credit cards, which is great considering lots of places in the area are cash only. From what I remember, there was no minimum tab. One bartender has a nice dog that he often brings to the bar (yellow lab I think). \n\n3. Two coed bathrooms makes the one line go much faster. One thing though, is that the bathroom is right next to the dance floor, so you gotta be careful opening the door; you don't want to bump someone shaking their bon bon. Likewise, you don't want to be working it on the floor and bump someone in line for the bathroom. Generally this isn't a problem on weekdays. \n\nDouble Douche: 1 star \n\n1. Ugh...this place gets fucking packed on the weekends. Absolutely sweaty shoulder to sweaty shoulder. Either Double Douche is a spa/sauna, or they really need to install a ventilation system up in that piece. I don't like being turned away at a bar, but after Sat night, I know why a bar has to do it sometimes. Sometimes turning you away is a good thing. \n\n2.

I look around for her and some midget taps me, wanting to start beef. Seriously? Sorry your eyes fell in my line of sight as I look for my friend, get over it asshole.

But lately I've been more pleasantly surprised with some of the places with themes I've been to, like famerbrown (Southern US/Soul/Funk?) and Lola in Seattle (Greek) and I've noticed that the key to making a theme palatable is to be suggestive with it, infusing it lightly into most aspects of the experience, rather than trying to beat people over the head with it. \n\nSo I appreciated the relative sparseness of the theme at Double Dutch. I thought the Simon, Lite Brite and backlit period photos were suggestive, but that the bar retains enough generality that it's attractive to people who aren't necessarily looking to walk into a Brooklyn block party circa 1980. Which is probably a wise business decision in this neighborhood, where most of the bar crowd were in diapers in 1980, somewhere east of Oakland and west of the Hudson. \n\nAlso, I think the decor is quite crisp, and the physical aspects of the bar are incredibly well-designed.\n\nThere are many fantastic things about Double Dutch that will keep me coming back regularly (on uncrowded afternoons when the Daily Candy crowd is at the gym - Friday and Saturday nights are the same Amateur Night you'd find at any other halfway clean bar in the Mission.)\n\nFirstly (and I think it's been mentioned), the bar belongs to Mike, owner of Magnet in North Beach. Not only is he quite the young bar impresario, he's also easy to look at, and has an extremely fresh dog.\n\nWhich brings me to the second fantastic thing: the bar is very dog friendly (again, on uncrowded afternoons) and on my recent visit, there were many adorable canines enjoying the social hour.\n\nAnd thirdly, the bathrooms are new and clean and ideally suited to washing hands. Bar bathrooms that facilitate handwashing are princely, in my book.\n\nAnyway, I dug it. I'll be back on some uncrowded afternoons.", "author": "Megan W."}

Hearing this, I immediately thought, \"Cool, they've probably tagged all the walls up with graffiti and the place will look like a Queensbridge house party with Afrikka Bambatta behind the decks.\r\n\r\nWhat do we get instead? Several framed pictures of breakdancers and $7 drinks. If they spent more than $200 decorating this place, they got ripped off.\r\n\r\nIn short, we were only there for about five minutes before wondering what the next theme is that this bar will attempt. Perhaps they can turn it into a military themed breakfast place called 'Take Orders'. Oh wait, that was done already.\r\n\r\nWhat depresses me most about this place is that, knowing it will fail, the chances of the next incarnation of it having a better starting theme is probably about 5%, so the fact that they got this one wrong is all the more saddening knowing that in six months this place will probably be some jizz-bucket infested snobbitorium where the only theme is 'our drinks are ten bucks and up'.\r\n\r\nPass....the dutchie on this place.", "author": "Andrew L."}

I don't know how hip hop you are just because you like Lords of the Underground records or wear Adidas shelltoes.  I guess they feel they maintain some kind of street cred coming here.\n\nWith all that said, I do enjoy coming here and yes I do enjoy Lords of the Underground records. It's a pretty laid back atmosphere and I do enjoy the music they play here. It's fun to hear some of the older stuff that you may have forgotten about.  Prices for drinks are about average  but most of the times, service is pretty swift in getting your drinks.\n\nThe negatives here is that the space is pretty small and there are only 2 bathrooms which you may have to lineup for if the toilet is occupied.  Having to wait in line after a few beers isn't very fun as  most of you know.  The bathroom is also near the dance floor so you might have to dodge some people when waiting in line.  The place gets pretty packed on the weekend but I wouldn't say overpacked where it's just uncomfortable to be there.\n\nThe crowd here is pretty diverse and I haven't seen a fight here yet so I guess it's full of positive people.  The bouncers seem pretty friendly and don't really trip on what you're wearing.  I haven't had a problem getting in here.\n\nOverall check it out and make up your own mind.

These people did not love hip-hop nor  did they feel nostalgic about the  early days of b-boys and b-girls breakin' in 1980s Brooklyn. They were just looking for a watering hole.

Nice vibe, good music, with a mixed crowd of casual and trendy folks (and a handful of younger just-turned-21 folks too). When we got there around 11, people were already drunk as hell dancing their asses off to some fresh old school hip-hop beats. In the back, a well-ventilated patio serves as a hangout for the smokers (or people who don't want to dance and deal with the crowded bar). The lounge has white walls decorated with bboy photos and ceiling with tacky neon chandeliers. Service at the bar was quick, though they didn't have any more of my beer of choice. Boo.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty well-lit for a bar/lounge (I'm not too used to seeing people's faces so clearly) and the bar area gets really packed, and all you have is a narrow walkway with a couple couches on the side. People just end up standing around and you can't really move anywhere, until you suddenly realize it's actually a line for the restrooms (not good placement of the banos).\r\n\r\nI don't really know what I thought of this place.

The theme seems to be of the urban/hip-hop variety.  The walls are covered in faux graffiti, hip hop videos and break dance competitions play on the flat screens, big pictures of what look like mid-90's rappers and the like are plastered on the walls.  The only thing is, this place is so far from gritty urban scene it isn't even funny.\n\nMuch like how the Mission is full of hipsters wishing to be surrounded by urban grittiness but not really wanting to ACTUALLY participate in any of it (I think the big, fancy apartments, the pressed shirts and $200 jeans make you anything but gritty urban), Double Dutch an urban paradise, minus the grittiness and all the negative things that make 'urban' what it really is.\n\nIt's basically a bunch of people milling about in their 'I didn't think about this outfit at all' (but spent hours assembling it and a fortune buying it) kind of way, trying to talk to each other but not hearing anything over the blaring music (which, by the way, wasn't rap, ironically).  It's dark and cramped, so nobody is dancing, just milling.  This place falls squarely into my 'doesn't know whether to be a dance club or a bar' kind of place that I really don't like.\n\nEven still, it was worth two stars since the bar tender was nice, fast, and responded quickly (I didn't have to wait long at all, he took people in the order they came, not based on the amount of cleavage they have).

The bar is not the type of place you walk into and are immediately filled with any strong impression, I don't think they wanted it like that, but it is the kind of place that gets more exciting the further back you go.

There is even two light-brights, a couple of rubics cubes, and a Simon game strategically placed on the liqour shelf.  The place is just waiting for Mike D from the beastie boys to roll up in there and be like \"Damn, this place is DOPE!\" \n\nI think it's safe to say you'll find me at Double Dutch a lot from now on.

I went to a few others, and felt a lil out of place. \n   The bar was a little small, but adorned in a hip-hop theme, with posters of breakdancers from the 80's, glass cases with 80's basketball shoes, and a wall of OG boomboxes. I thought this place was pretty cool just by looking around. The people were a diverse crowd of 20-40 somethings of all walks of life. The music was raw hip-hop from the 80's to the present. The drinks were cheap, and the bartenders were prompt. \n   If you are in the Mission, and want to get a drink at a bar, and like hip hop, this would be your place. Only downside about this place, is how puny it is.", "author": "rich s."}

Maybe I like it here better because it's new to me, I've only heard of it recently. After it being suggested by friends, went for the first time this past Saturday for a birthday.\n\nRelative to its size, there's lots of room to sit at the bar and booths. The drink prices are standard. Small dancefloor, and it can get crowded- I was a little irritated at people who pushed through us to get a space. \n\nThe restrooms are NASTY (not in the cool way). Probably the worst I've seen in the mission. Swampy. Let's just say I was thankful to be wearing heels. Yuck. \n\nIf you  can avoid that, then the one thing I really, really, really like is the decor suited to its double dutch bus-ey theme. Very retro and funky! Of course, great old school hip hop, dance hall and new tunes to groove to. Graph art on the walls, a case with vintage sneakers (I wanted to steal the pair of blacknpurple cheetah pumas danget), and a collection of nice looking old school cassette boom boxes above the dj booth.

The place is small so when you hit the \"dance floor\" you are pretty much grinding up on everyone in the bar. But hey, who doesn't like to make new friends?\n\nThe drinks are reasonably priced, from examining the credit card bill the next morning. They had this one specialty shot thing that was an eerie green color, like coolant green. Can't think of the name as we had hit a few of the dive bars around the area beforehand so we were all slightly inebriated by the time we got to meet the bartender at this particular establishment, but it was strong and tasty.\n\nAlso, we bumped into some people we haven't seen since middle school, which was strange, and we witnessed a gang fight out on the street. Actually, it could have just been some people drunk-wrestling but gang fight sounds so much more exciting so let's go with that.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the place to be if you like art so much you'd enjoy people actually painting as a backdrop to your drinking strangely colored things as you rub elbows with strangers and bump into old acquaintances while gangs quarrel over territory boundaries outside.

They had beat boxes mounted on the wall, graffiti art, a b-boy break dance video playing on the flat screen and the DJ was spinning some old school jams. Double Dutch inspired a friend of mine to throw a early '90s rap and hip hop party which should be off the hook.\n\nIt was a fun night.

Real cool and attentive bartenders.  ALWAYS awesome music - i think i've heard Common's \"The Light\" EVERYTIME I've been there, and it's been mixed with a very different joint EVERYTIME.  Old school, but still trendy decor.  Break Dance videos on the TV are SICK and could be your entire night.\n\nMy only beef with Double Dutch is the crowd.  Not the fact that it's 'crowded' (which it almost always is), but the wanna-bees with  button-down dress shirts, spiked up hair, and lots of too-cool-for-school attitude.

I had seen the sign for \"hot cider\" on my walk back from BART and it left my mouth-watering in the cold.  The hot cider was really delicious and surprisingly strong - definitely worth a trip across the next few cold months.  As for the scene it was basically empty.  There were about 4 other people sitting at the bar and I think the bouncer was one of them.  The walls are lined with old stereo facades which are kind of cool and they've got some great old school pictures on the wall.  The music was awesome - which seems to be their high point after reading the other reviews.  I definitely left wanting to come back when it was a bit more crowded and there would be people dancing.  It is a pretty small and sort of grimy place, but I have no doubt it gets pretty fun at night.  If anything, I appreciated the hot whiskey cider and good music for an early Friday evening drink.", "author": "Elizabeth B."}

They do accept credit cards, but there is a $10 minimum and there isn't a coat check.  The people range from girls overdressed for the club to people in flip flops.  The bartenders are good, especially the tall guy with the buzzed head, his drinks are the best. During the week it isn't that crowded and on some weeknights they have local artist there. The weekends gets crowed and sweaty, but if you get drunk, it wont bother you that much.  The downside of this place, there isn't any room to dance, so if you're planning on showing off your b- boy or b-girl moves, go to a club, there isn't enough room for you at this bar.  If you're one of those people that like to sit most of the time, I would suggest getting there before 10 to get a seat. Overall, one of the best bars in the Mission.", "author": "Shamiya M."}

Culturally diversified, latin influences, different languages being spoken on each corner. And then, through the grapevine you hear of a small place on 16th, right by Kilowatt where I used to party when I was underage (yes, you read that correctly), Double Dutch. Supposedly an \"underground\" style hip hop club bumpin' beats from back in the day that make you move unconsciously from the passionate undertone that busts through the speakers around you. Of course, if and when anyone says that type of description to me I become immediately taken back to younger days in NYC and LA where we'd go into unmarked unspoken clubs spittin' the illest rhymes imaginable. Some of the only white people in those clubs we were, and it was a great way to grow up. These experiences definitely spurned my deep love and appreciation for the underbelly of hip hop and my love of the music and it's history.\n\nBut no, this was all frontin' hype about this place. Some quickly pasted up graf on the walls and some kitchy placed talk boxes in the back behind the D.J. Full bar, that's good, cause I NEEDED to a drink just in order to hang out there for the full forty-five minutes that I could take. My girl and I were stuck against the back wall, sitting on the bench in total and complete aghast of the uncoordinated hipster white people in their H & M outfits and too tight pants with their poser hightops. They probably didn't even know what those 200 dollar AF one's are all about, or why they're so coveted. There were only a few of us were gettin' down to the beats on the small dance floor at the back next to the urine infested reaking unisex bathrooms. The music wasn't bad, but it wasn't all old school, some pretty top 40 pop-ish hip hop came on, but I guess what are all those hipsters going to dance to if they haven't heard it on the radio yet right? If they hadn't played some fly beats I would have given this place no stars at all which I don't even know you can do. Anyways, us two were really the only ones who knew ANY of the words of the music comin' out of that place. Disappointing, just disappointing. \n\nBut the two best parts of the night (I'm being sarcastic if you haven't grasped that yet ya'll) were that:\n\n1. There were only white people there and you know how much I love a uniform ethic crowd. Nothing like having no diversity and no cultures up in the house. I love monochromatic anything!!!!\n\n2. I looked at my girl and we mutually agreed to bounce with no words exchanged when the guy behind me, doing some crazy (not even funny) version of the \"sprinkler\" said, \"Wow guys! Look how white I really am!!!!\"\n\nOh to be stuck in the back corner of a converse infected club posing as a hip hop inspired house of music. If you ask me, it was just like being in the marina, same mentality, same checkbook, just with more PBR and less good wine. Hey, at least they've got good wine and the view of the water over there.", "author": "Danielle S."}

Arrive before 10, this way you actually get to get in without a line, order a drink and dance a little before you get disgustingly sweaty\n2. Make an order of 8 $2 Olympias, works out perfectly to pay with a $20 plus tip (don't judge, there's no way I'd tip $1 a drink for someone to pop open $2 cans)\n3. Dance it up to some normally awesome mixes (I think they have improved their DJs as of late but it can be a little hit or miss at times)\n4. Get in a near fight. Double Dutch is good for getting some dancing aggression out and just cool enough that a fight never actually breaks out, I think everyone there is just having too good a time.\n5.

E was having a crappy work day and needed to vent. Earlier J and I had blown off our film class to get Goat Hill Pizza. Luckily, it was not their all-you-can-eat night, otherwise, my waistline would have been in big trouble. As we're talking, E looks over and suddenly rises to her feet. \n\nI gaze over at the focus of her attention, and see a guy has passed out on the floor. He's out cold. E and J rush over to him, taking his pulse, and attempting to revive him. I get him some water from the bar and ask the bartender to call 911. This guy next to him, who appears to be with him, yells \"don't, he doesn't have insurance.\" The bartender terminates his call. We revive him and with the help of others, attempt to help him off the floor. At this time, his legs buckle and the eyes in his head are rolling backwards and he starts foaming at the mouth. This time I'm like, \"Look buddy, insurance or not, he needs to go to a hospital.\" We gently rest him on the floor, against the wall, and he's conscious again. I get him to talk, asking his name and where he lives. He has no home, but couch surfs. I ask him what happened, and he says he'd performing some skate stunt, falls, and it feels as if his hip has removed from his socket. He continued to walk over here, but then felt woozy and passed out. So it must be the shock. Meanwhile, his \"friend\" and some other bar patron go at it due to the latter's comment about how this guy must be drunk and high. I'm not really sure what the real deal is, but he needs help. He is sweating like a pig, and I wiped the sweat from his brow, like Mary Magdalene. J looks at me frowning and whispers I'd better wash my hands after. She works in a hospital and knows the danger of body fluids. The most frustrating part is the lack of concern from other patrons. The three of us are the only ones helping. Even his friend doesn't seem to be concerned, but is more interested in starting sh*t with other people. The guy vehemently refuses an ambulance, stating he doesn't have insurance and can't afford $1000. I tell him he can't afford to be dead either and if he fails to seek treatment he may just expose himself to further injury that will cost him more later on. He doesn't want that. He wants to make a book of skate sculptures. He's 39 years old, homeless, and no insurance. I feel really bad for him. We convince him to accept the ambulance, which has now arrived, and wish him luck. His friend doesn't even accompany him. The bartender thanks us profusely and offers us a round of free drinks. We refuse, just wanting to get the hell out and pretend the night never existed. \n\nTwo stars for the bartender who a) let me sample a kick-ass rioja before purchasing it and b) his amazing ability to multi-task during a crisis.", "author": "Suzanne R."}

The dog is barking its head off, and now appears to be a pit bull.  The bartenders are calling 911 on their cell phones, which is good because the rest of the patrons are frozen in place, as we are.

The name was made with a couple lite bright machines.  They also had high top nike shoes hanging by the bar.  A plus for me was being asked for my ID, great way to guarantee a nice tip.  The bartendar was nice and he had that Benicio del Torro voice.  A plus was the Bob Marley music playing when we first came in.  \nThen all hell broke loose, we noticed a bunch of folks coming in and they had papers and books that said literary quake on them.  We had no idea what they were doing but soon we found out.   They stopped the music and started reading poetry, literature, what have you.  We where told to be quiet while this stuff was going on.  It was fun while it lasted but we decided to leave because it would be an hour of readings and we couldn't handle another 45 plus mins.

They mainly play 90s hip hop (Hypnotize, This Is How We Do It and Ain't No Fun), but I heard some music from the 00s (Lean Back and We Fly High) and a few newer songs as well. Drinks are decently priced ($10 AMFs) for their size, but they can be inconsistent. Got an AMF for our friend at the start of the night, and it tasted like pure alcohol. An hour and a different bartender later, I had probably one of the better AMFs I've had in awhile and a good buzz going on afterwards. There's no cover, which is always a great thing. The dance floor is tiny and it is CROWDED, so be prepared to get a drink spilled on you or drunk people flailing around you at times. I didn't see a coat check, but if you're dancing along the edge of the dance floor, there's a counter where you can pile your jackets and/or bags.

My other complaint...this place can get crowded....at one point I was trying to walk to the other side of the bar and said excuse me to some guy who in turn tried to start a fight with me....o well i guess, this type of thing could happen anywhere.\n\nOn another note the staff here is really friendly....we went as a group of 20 or so and the bartenders were attentive. The guy at the front door was cool too....great staff.\n\nThis place is legit and I would recommend it to anyone else.", "author": "nick s."}

Most places I've gone to when people bump into you or vice versa, they give you dirty looks.  Not this place.  People just smile and say excuse me or sorry.  The crowd is pretty friendly.  The music is pretty good.  There is a good mixture of hip hop, hip hop and hip hop.  The DJ did sneak in one INXS song, but it was a good one.  Some of the music brought me back to my younger days with \"Back to the Hotel\" by N2DEEP, and \"Diddy\" by Paperboy.", "author": "Philip L."}

We'd get loaded enough on $1 beers that we'd succumb after 8 and spring for one real drink each, which in turn got us drunk enough that we no longer minded the inevitable muni ride or LOOONG walk home (because we couldn't afford to take a cab...).

And what I mean by that is, those that are smart and plan to party in the Mission district have the chance to buy a drunken hot dog or burrito meal almost anywhere nearby after partying! Double Dutch is such a place located in the heart of the Mission. A quaint long bar with a 12 by 12 foot dance floor in the back, has the bathroom tucked away behind the dancing crowd and four wire-light chandeliers above that were bright but looked cheap. The drinks were average and inconsistent: I had the same drink thrice and for some reason some were harder than others. I saw Norm from the Real World New York in there, too, so I am thinking the place has some clout among the coolest of the cool in SF. I did feel a little younger there because of a higher perceived average age, but the crowd was pretty diverse as we danced, or fell off of chairs, to the bumping hip hop beats. And by the way, I know it is cold outside, so self-check your coat UNDER the bar countrer. There are hooks to hang your scarf, jacket, and your shyness. -Matt", "author": "Matthew C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-19", "description": "The main reason I'm down with Double Dutch is simple: the Wii.  A few months ago a friend and I stopped by DD on a holiday, not realizing that it would be virtually deserted.  The bartender had brought his Wii in and some of his friends were just hanging out there playing and drinking, and eventually I got sucked into Wii bowling and some involved shooting game [ok, I don't have a Wii, so ignore my ignorance of what I was actually playing].  And thus, I became down with the DD.  Granted, I probably wouldn't be able to point that bartender out in a lineup today, and I've never been back on another Wii night, but it has a special place in my heart now, if not for the cool people we met that night, then for the tunes, kicks, and boomboxes that it provides on all other nights.", "author": "Margie N."}

Bonus is that Brian the door guy is a sweetheart.  My friend K had her going away party here in August on a Thursday night. Great mixed crowd mostly locals.  Thursday nites are the best Friday and Saturday nite can be scary as in you drastically increase your chances of being groped, man/woman/trannie-handled ,stalked, harrassed or otherwise ass raped.   On the nite of aforementioned  party i have to say i kissed the hottest boy ever !!!!    Too bad i didnt get his contact  info just one of  the setbacks associated with being overserved is 1. elusive memory  retention and 2. diahrrea of the mouth.   I also made several  mind numbingly idiotic comments  like \"I'm  married\"  and then he  (apparently similarly afflicted ) made me attempt to pronounce his girfriends  unpronounceable name .  Im actually concerned about his welfare and considered calling SFGH and St Lukes for any hot male head trauma victims with  huge erections.   Lets just say at the end of the night hot boy and i were involved in a lot of  hair pulling, glass slamming (against the Pakwan storefront window) and serious ass groping  (my ass not his, please im not that kinda girl),and the next morning both my backside and my lips (the ones on my face get your minds outta the gutter) were seriously bruised.   Was the  closest I've ever been to having sex vertically, with my clothes on.   Seriously best kiss ive had so far.....Anyway now that my Porcelynne panties are wet...You get the picture, check out the DD for yourselves.  Sure their bathrooms are nasty but they pour generously and the eye candy here is normally worth the visit.", "author": "Ellie A."}
