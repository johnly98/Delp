My boyfriend and I came here at opening on a Friday and it wasn't crowded at all. The view was perfect and the wait wasn't long at all, it was the perfect time to pop in before our reso at Lolo at 5:30. Normally there's a bit of a crowd outside when waiting to ride the elevator; however, Friday at 4pm proved to be a good workaround for that. \n\nHH is from 4-6 and prices are amazing. The sangria and margaritas are to die for and they do $17 pitchers during HH.

The hostess are outside and you have the option of sitting at a table or stand up bar area. We definitely wanted a table and there was no wait! \nEntering the building, you would take the elevators up to the roof top which is where El Techo was.

Delicious\nMango - very refreshing, it also comes with cucumbers and something else, and sprinkled with lime, habanero, and some spices\nFried Plantains - SO GOODDDDDD!\nand Cookies w/ chocolate milk for desert - The cookies were alright but I thought it was cute that it came with chocolate milk :)\nSangria for drinks - I didn't have any of this but my friends finished it so I'm sure it was good!\n\n\nService was great, fun environment and food, nice views.

Located right on Mission, this Lolinda out-post is the fun, vibrant little sister. Very accessible by public transit, and kind of impossible by car (parking), but it's no matter because you should definitely enjoy a pitcher here!\n\nThis is a rooftop restaurant, but they've done an exceptional job sheltering the seating and providing ample heating. On the street, there's a narrow opening with a host stand. They only take OpenTable reservations  for Saturday and Sundays; Fridays it gets very busy, and if going with a large group, it is advisable to send a scout about an hour prior to put down a name and number. It's located on top of a residential building, so you may cross paths with tenants on the elevator ride up.\n\nThe food is of course, simply brilliant. Lolinda, for those who aren't familiar, is a wonderful very-established Argentine steak-house located in the Mission as well. El Techo is a more causal affair with the same standards of great flavor. My go-to is their Empanada de Maiz (corn empanada), and my favorite part is the lemon aioli that accompanies it. Unfortunately it's only on the evening menu, which I was bummed to find out when I went for brunch! A blessing in disguise though because I tried the Platano Maduro (fried ripe pantains) and they were delicious! They come with a side 'sour cream', topped with cotija (a Mexican cows-milk cheese) which truly upped the game.

You'd think these would be everywhere in SF but alas, no such luck. \n\nAnyways, I've been going through major summer rooftop withdrawals ever since I moved back from NYC so I was super excited to give El Techo a try. Not to mention, the menu itself looked delicious! \n\nI came with a group of four around 1 pm for a late brunch/lunch. It was fairly crowded upstairs so we had to wait around 15 minutes which wasn't bad at all. Once the hostess lets you inside you can either take the elevator or climb three flights of stairs to get to the roof. \n\nThe view from above was pretty great -- you can see the Salesforce Tower and the Financial District from one side and if you dip to another corner, you can get a glimpse of Twin Peaks as well. \n\nThe food itself and the drinks were good as well. The four of us shared a pitcher of sangria ($30) which was enough for each of us to have about 1 and a half cups. I also went with the Chorizo Scramble ($14) which was delicious and perfect for a brunch dish (with several generous douses of cholula). \n\nAll in all, I'd definitely come back!

We got there pretty early on a Friday and there was already quite a long line. I wasn't super clear on if we were supposed to talk to the hostess or just get in line, but we stood in the line and it was moving pretty quickly.\n\nWhen we got upstairs, I was a little bummed because the view was pretty obscured by the masses of people who were already up there. We were seated in the middle of the patio area but the tables nearest the edges were taller or people were standing so I couldn't get a good view. I was a little disappointed because the fog had finally burned off so I was hoping to be able to see the city. The roof has a party vibe with people ordering bottles of champagne, loud music and lots of laughter! GR people: Think Donkey patio at its peak.\n\nThe happy hour specials are really good -\u00a0$4 cervezas, $7 margaritas, $18 sangria pitchers, and a bunch of small plates for $5 each. We ordered a couple pitchers of sangria, chips and guac, some empanadas, and elote (from the regular menu). The sangria was great; not overly sweet and had a nice flavor to it. The rest of the food was decent, but nothing out of this world. The servers were doing the best they could with the crowd and keeping up pretty well!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-27", "description": "True rating: 2.5\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Yes, it's a rooftop, but when I went on a Sunday late evening they had a plastic tent up so you couldn't really enjoy the view. But I heard from a friend that they don't always have that up. Try going when it's not up, it really blurs the view and you won't enjoy it\n\n2. Yes, there will be a wait, unless you go really late. I went at 9pm on a Sunday and though there were tables available, there were no tables available right next to the view. \n\n3. The food is okay. I got the Empanada de Maiz, Elote, and the Chicharrones de Carne. My vegetarian friend really enjoyed the Empanada de Maiz. However, my friend did get a minor stomach ache afterwords. It had to be the Empanada de Maiz since that is the only dish he had and I didn't. Elote (corn) was dry and not fresh. Would not recommend. The chicharrones were good and the half pound could probably feed 2 people but not 2 hungry people. There are not many vegetarian options, fyi\n\n4. The drinks depends on what you get. The virgin Pina Colada was below average. For me, it was too sweet and lacked the genuine fruit taste. The margarita was pretty good though.\n\n5. The service was below average. It took forever for us to get our server's attention. It felt even more prolonged since we were trying to get the server's attention but couldn't because he is occupied chatting with another co-worker while leaning against the table top that connects the kitchen and restaurant. \n\nI would only briefly mention this place to a friend because it's a rooftop. The service and food isn't really worth the hype. I didn't really get the see the view because of the plastic tent and that seems to be the reason why people like this place. (but hey I get it, it blocks the wind) I guess my advice is go when the tent is not up.", "author": "Shin L."}

The Margarita didn't seem to have the flavor there was habanero tequila added in it. The Belafonte was refreshing, but too sweet to drink the whole thing. We got some chips and salsa. I saw they looked like they were made fresh so I figured we're have way there to a win. Salsa tasted heavy on tomatoes, almost like out of a can w/ some lime juice.

I'm always up for pre-dinner drinks, and was even more ecstatic when he told me it was a rooftop bar. Alcohol + sick Cali views = heaven for a Chicago girl like me who's been experiencing nothing but cold and snow on and off for the last few months! \n\nI arrived a little early and there was a hostess sitting outside the building on the ground level, who told me I could go up and find a spot to drink while I waited for my friend to arrive. Once inside, I had to take an elevator to the roof, and when the doors opened I basically bolted at the sight of the gorgeous hills of Northern California. You can see for miles and miles from anywhere you stand at El Techo, but I chose a spot right on the outskirts of the space, which had the best view in the house. But maybe I'm biased, because it was *my* spot!\n\nI'd also like to say that for such spectacular views, the drink prices aren't too shabby, either. I thought they'd be very expensive, but I ordered a sangria, which was only $7, and that was enough to get me very buzzed and ready for our dinner plans down the street. Our waitress was very attentive and brought us water, too, which was much needed. \n\nIf you're looking for a place to grab drinks before dinner or stay for hours, El Techo is reasonably priced, has a vibrant atmosphere, and provides incredible views.

Nice views of The City.\n\nVisited on a Saturday around 3pm, and there was a short-ish queue along the sidewalk. We waited a good while, maybe about 20-25 mins before we were let through to the elevator. It's probably best to come here with a smaller party, maybe 3-4 people, so that they can accommodate you faster.\n\nIf you can stand that wait, the actual rooftop is pretty dope. Space is kind of tight: you can tell they're trying to maximize the amount people they can shove into the spot. But it has good vibes, with nice decor and fun atmosphere. There's a variety of seating, including tables with large tents providing shade, high chairs and tables, as well as standing room with high, slim communal tables and umbrellas all along the outer edges of the roof. Cool. Definitely opt to stand at the outer edges to soak in them glorious San Francisco views.\n\nService was attentive and friendly. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, a perfect start for our party of three (enough for roughly 2 full glasses each), and subsequently ordered a pitcher of their La Paloma. Both were delicious and refreshing on the sunny summer day. We had to wait to order food: they didn't start food service until 4pm. All cool. We were able to order some chips, salsa, and guac to hold us over in the meantime. Chilled out with our drinks and chips for a little, then promptly ordered 2 of the Empanadas de Carne and 2 of the Empanadas de Zapallo. To our surprise, an order of empanadas came with 2 pieces, so we had 8 total, and they were a pretty good size. A little bit more than what we had in mind, but we gobbled them up nonetheless. I was expecting the meat empanada to be the winner, but the veg option was actually a little more tasty. Both came with their own unique dipping sauce for that extra yum. It can get quite pricey here, but that's to be expected.\n\nGlad I finally got a chance to visit this popular rooftop bar.

This was my first time here, so I didn't realize how \"hipster\" this place is. This is more of a hanging-out-friends than take-your-parents-from-out-of-town to eat type of place. That was my own fault because I didn't research enough. I was just excited to try it after reading they were named one of the best brunch restaurants in the US. \n\nI really don't like the tables or seats here. The tables were tiny and barely had enough room for two plates and drinks. The stools were incredibly uncomfortable. It's not like the food is cheap, so I expect my seat to be at least comfortable. Is it too much to ask for some back support? And there's nowhere to place your coat. I saw some people sitting on their coats, but I noticed their sleeves were touching the floor. No thank you! I had to eat with my coat on.\n \nI don't understand how this is one of the best brunch places in the country. From my one experience, the plates are a hit or miss. My mom got the huevos rancheros and they were super disappointing. If the food looks like something I can make (and I'm not a good cook), then it's not worth the money. It was basically black beans with a tostada, scrambled eggs, and a slice of avocado on top. Really?! I know they put their own spin to Mexican classics, but this didn't look like it was inspired by huevos rancheros at all. It was a boring and lazy dish. On the other hand, my huarache was fantastic. The meat was moist and tender, and I love how they mixed spinach and cheese into the tortilla. I'm confused on how one plate was super amateur and the other was amazing. \n\nI'm a big fan of the drinks menu and will probably come back with friends to drink. The bloody maria was a great twist to the bloody mary. No complaints in that department! You also can't beat the view from the top. Service was mediocre, though.

The server told us his manager wouldn't let him take off the margarita so he took off the guac which was under $10...the margaritas was like $36.....really bad service here and don't think we'll come back here.

Wait was only 15-20 minutes. We were seated at a 2-top, which was \"cozy\" but it did the job. \n\nThe views at this place are AMAZING, the ambiance is was nice, hipster/trendy crowd, filled with people itching to post to their insta-stories and snapchats (if that's still a a thing).\n\nDrinks: only ordered the Belafonte, very very good.\n\nLet's talk about the food. We ordered many items, the Chicharrones, ChorizoPan, Elote, and  Braised Pork quesadilla, and Flan. I was most excited about the chicharrones, good mixture of meat and fat but was very underwhelmed. Presentation didn't match flavor. Even with the toppings, it was very dry tasting and left my mouth dying for water. The tortillas were good though. Elote, was a bit too charred, and the quesadilla was OK. \n\nChorizoPan = great bread, chimichurri was good, I just wish they cooked the chorizo a tad bit more, it was a bit soft for my liking. Was hoping for more a snap when I bite down. \n\nFlan = probably the best Flan I've had in awhile. Light, airy, flavorful. Would def recommend.\n\nThe service was cool, our server went on lunch but never told us, but the lady that stepped in was very sweet.

Nice option to start or end your meal but not something I think you NEED to get. \n\n+ Benedictos -  So much yes! The chorizo is the perfect addition to this classic meal option.

Since we were going to a show in SF on Sunday, night as well stop by and try it out! Arriving at 6pm on a Sunday and find out there practically no wait is amazing. Getting off the Bart, we saw a line in the front and thought we would be waiting maybe 30 minutes but once we put our name down they stated we were first in line and the wait would be about 10 minutes. We were kinda confused but I think the people who were waiting in line were trying to get in the drinks only area and we were there for dining. \n\nTaking the elevator to the roof top you meet another hostess. We got seated after the first party got seated and luckily we go the view right by the glass barriers. We had a fantastic view of SF with the Bay bridge, Salesforce tower, and the rest of downtown. We even got to see the city scape change from sunset to dusk. \n\nWe ordered the ensalada de jicama, quesadilla, half pound of chicharon, and a couple of skewers (shrimp, chicken, and carne). All were really delicious. The salad had lots of thick chunks of jicama, like the size you purchase to-go in cups at the market. Wish they diced it instead. I liked the quesadilla the best and wanted to order more but we had more food coming out. I also ordered a Techo margarita and is made with Mezcal. It tasted really smoky and I would probably not order it again. \n\nThis is a great place to grab drinks and delicious food with a great SF view.", "author": "Avita S."}

This restaurant was recommended to me by a long time resident of San Francisco.  He warned us to arrive before 6pm if we wanted to get a table.\nHe also explained that the entrance is via a freight elevator in a building next-door to the sister Argentinian restaurant.  \n\nWe located the entrance, having arrived at 5:30, by asking directions from the restaurant.  There were a few people waiting in line for the elevator, including residents of that building.  When the elevator opens up on the rooftop the view of San Francisco will take your breath away.  It gets better as the sun sets and you get to see the vista of the city and the lighted Bay Bridge.\n\nCheck in with the host for a table, we were luck to get one of the last two four tops available by just a few minutes.  One elevator later and we would have been out of luck and would have to wait.\n\nThe servers were great and explained the menu and the various styles of margaritas that were available.  You can order by the glass or, even better, by the pitcher.  We got guacamole and chips to start and then ordered 1 1/2 lb of Chicharrones for three people.  It was more than enough.\n\nWe needed a few more tortillas and a refill of guacamole to finish the beautiful plate of succulent pork, black refried beans and grilled veggies.  After two pitchers, full stomachs, and the wonderful night views, we were ready to leave.  Down the elevator and out to the street and we were greeted by a long line of patrons waiting around the block to get in.  My friend was right!\n\nWe felt so lucky to have been able to experience this venue on such a gorgeous day and night.  \nI highly recommend the Chicharrones!

Super flavorful and delicious fall apart meat.\n\nI also got the pibil (pork) quesadilla and my friend got the ground beef empanadas. The quesadilla was also amazing with tender pork, an amazing salsa, and a gooey/salty cheese. The empanadas reminded me of homemade tacos growing up with a flaky/crunchy empanada shell. All of it was some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.\n\nFinally, the vibe was awesome. It was hopping even at 5 on a Sunday. They played great music, not quite a club vibe, but a good 80's-90's upbeat but not all pop play list, mostly good r&b stuff. The most important impressive though, was the view. El techo or \"the roof\" looked out over the city and it was a spectacular view where you see one of half of the city. I'd love to go back and will try every chance I get.

Must get this on the next visit. For my entree, I went with the huarache which is a spinach and cheese stuffed tortilla covered in brisket and egg and pickled onion. yeah. A stuffed tortilla covered in meat??? freaking amazing. I'm super picky about my eggs and these were cooked to perfection. The pickled onion really made the dish ten times better. I love pickled anything. I ordered a side of potatoes as well, not absolutely necessary because the meal will fill you up but these potatoes were delicious. Super simple roasted potatoes with olive oil and seasoning. I tried a bit of the carnitas dish and this was just as tasy. Such a big plate filled with delicious.

The bar seats are wobbly, and someone constantly walks by behind you and kicks your chair....\n\nWe orders a mango dish, which we thought was a salad dish but it was a few sticks of mangos, cucumbers and jicama.

No one came around to bus our table or check on us.  \n\nI don't know why this place is so crowded.  It is overrated; the food is just okay and the service is terrible.

I only made it to the front door. \n\nI was by myself on a Saturday afternoon (Maybe 3 ish?). After hearing great things about this place I figured it'd be a great place to grab a drink and kill and hour until I met up with a friend in the area. I told the hostess outside I just wanted to grab a drink. She asked if I was planning on eating, I told her no and that I just wanted to have a drink on the patio. She said they weren't open for cocktail hour yet and were only serving food. I asked if I ordered food, if I could go in. She said no because I was by by myself and the tables were all for groups. \n\nI didn't argue or ask again. I just turned around and left. I guess I'm just more confused than anything. I've never experienced being declined to dine/drink alone. If certain hours are restricted for certain dining types, it should be clearly listed on a website or something. I did see different Happy Hour & Brunch hours listed, but nothing that said if you're by yourself and just want a drink, you can't go in. \n\nI've never felt awkward about traveling/dining/drinking alone before... but this experience definitely made understand why so many people think it would be lonely. Maybe I'll try again next time I visit and make sure I am with a group of people.", "author": "Savannah J."}

I have had the Michelada, Margarita del Techo, La Paloma, and tried a sip of my friends pina colada. They actually make a good Michelada which is super hard to find here in the Bay Area. \n\nThe food we ordered was alright, definitely not the best Mexican I have had but for sure not the worst I have had. My friend and I shared the chips and guac, carnitas, and empanadas de carne. The empanadas were really quite good and served with a nice chimichurri. The carnitas were very greasy but had a good flavor especially the really crunchy bits, that came with corn tortillas and pickled vegetables. For the price the size of the guac was so-so and it was also a tiny bit browned on the top which was disappointing.\n\nOverall, it is a fun place to grab a drink and a great view.

A lot of my friends and family have been ranting and raving about this place for a while now and I haven't had the opportunity to visit until my friend wanted to have her birthday dinner here! \n\nWe got there about 5/530, we had to wait for a bit to get seated, but didn't take no longer than 10 minutes since we made reservations. Once they let you know that your table is ready, you take the elevator upstairs where the hostess will meet you to show you where you are sitting. Once seated, they all gave us time to look at the menu. We ordered margaritas by the pitcher. I recommend parties for more than 5 people to order the margaritas, it's easier to have your drinks right there rather than to keep ordering one drink after the other. The margaritas were tart, but they tasted really good. They were a bit strong, but that's not a bad thing :) \n\nAs for food, I ordered the Quesadilla de Pibil. When it was brought out, it was steaming hot! It smelled so good, I was excited to eat it until I burnt my tongue a little lol. When separating the quesadilla, you can see the cheesy goodness oozing out. I think they used a corn tortilla to make the quesadilla instead of flour, and to my surprise it went well with the meat and cheese! The pork was shredded and had a bbq taste to it. I only ate half of the quesadilla, surprisingly it was very filling! The servers were very attentive and listened to your every need. Even though they were super busy, it didn't look like they were even breaking a sweat! \n\nAs for the view, it's breath taking! To see all of the houses, stores, restaurants all stacked and staggered in all different sizes and colors. You can't resist to take some pics and selfies of the scenery. \n\nIf you are planning to spend a special event at this establishment, do call ahead and reserve your party. Everyone in your party also has to be there when checking in. I recommend everyone to visit El Techo whenever they're in SF, to catch great vibes, food, drinks and scenery!", "author": "Adrianna T."}

The fried chicken thighs were delicious, and we ended up ordering two of them because they were so good!

The pollo frito is essentially popcorn chicken, which I am never really a fan of, so I can't comment on that, but my friends went crazy over it (they actually finished 2 plates). My friends also shared the empanadas as they have beef which I don't eat, and they seemed to enjoy it.

It's located in the Mission area and drumroll...they take reservations for Brunch! Whaaaa? Unheard of really! \nI hear it's a little tough to get reservations as they fill up quickly especially for brunch hours- although when we went,  friend made them a couple of weeks in advance and we were good! She made the mistake of making our reservations then next week on out but they were still able to accommodate our party of five adults and two high chair kids without any issues.\nThe ambiance is really nice especially if it's a pretty day in the city as it's pretty much outdoors and offers surrounding city views. \nThe food is good---but honestly not rave worthy. \nAmongst the five of us, we tried a variety of dishes. My favorites were probably the most basic things on the menu like the guacamole and salsa, the mango and jicama with lime and a Tajin type flavoring sprinkled atop and the huevos rancheros (minus the brisket for me as I don't eat beef). I have to say the huevos rancheros were fantastic. My friends on the other hand said their huarache with the brisket was not so great because of their sauce --not flavorful enough nor enough in quantity and to me, their dulce de leche pancakes disappointed the most. They tasted like plain ol' pancakes, were not fluffy and how they related them to DDL is beyond me. They were so blah which is ironic bc I was most excited about this rare menu item. \nWe didn't have their cocktails but they did look pretty good. Overall, I'd definitely come back due to the convenience of making a reservation during brunch, the location as well as select menu items. Oh their service was awesome too.

At first, the portion size seemed a bit small, but I was quickly proven wrong. The food was actually really filling! The cornbread (rather than the traditional muffin) under 2 poached eggs was a nice surprise, and also offered a bit of unexpected heat. Absolutely delicious!! Who'd definitely order again, though it was a bit pricey at $14, I thought it was totally worth. Totally polished off the plate. \n\nThe chips and guac are tasty too, and the guac tastes perfectly chunky and fresh. The don't skimp on the portion size either! \n\nThe pi\u00f1a coladas are a MUST.

Didn't make you feel like you needed to be classy or dress up to enjoy the view, a great kick-back feeling. \n\nFood:\nEach person of my party of 3 ordered a dish and we shared everything +2 appetizers\nBuenelos aka beignets ($6): 6 small donut hole-like beignets. The Dulce de leche was bombbb and they were delicious but they were so small :(( wish I could have more. \nEnsalada de Jicama ($8): decently sized, not remarkable. Probably would not order again because it was nothing special \nCarnitas ($19): Definitely pricey.... but the carnitas were really on point. Juicy, crispy, and though it didn't look like much initially, I was definitely full! \nChorizo Scramble ($15)-the chorizo is delicious! Good quality and fresh scramble, good if you're looking for a dish with lots of different flavors. Potatoes were the highlight of the dish ;)\nBenedictos ($14): what makes these bennies special is that they're served over corn bread! Not personally a fan of corn bread but my friends really liked it! \n\n$30/person after tax and tip and splitting the entire bill in equal thirds. Might go back to try the cocktails, maybe not for brunch.", "author": "Leslie T."}

You go up this semi sketchy elevator to the top where you are greeted with an amazing view of the city. Most of the seats is covered by an overhang while some seats is exposed to the sun. Beware of days where it's windy. The wind blows extra hard on  the rooftop and blows your napkins, and food, while making everything bang against each other if they aren't tied down. \n\nI've been too both brunch and dinner and I think the dinner was much better. There is a wider selection of food and drinks that I missed. The menu is also seasonal so make sure you check the menu before you assume your favorite appetizer is still on the menu.\n\nFor brunch make sure you get a reservation and not wait in line. It takes a while if you don't have a reservation, especially if you have a bigger party. I made a reservation for 10 four weeks in advance. We were running late that day and I called in to see what's the last time to get seated.and the person who answered the call said it was 1:40 since brunch closed at 3 pm. However, they were seating people well past 1:40. \n\n\nThe drinks are always amazing! I would recommend getting the pina colada (best I have ever had) or the margaritas or even the Sangria.  They aren't too sweet but provide a good balance of flavors. \n\nThe guacamole is always a good choice for an appetizer. I ordered the carnitas for brunch and it looked very similar to what I have would of gotten at dinner. It was just as good as I would remember. The carnitas came with tortillas, a mound of carnitas, black beans, pickled vegetables, and lime. \nI had a bite of the techo ranchero and it was a burst of flavor with the guacamole, runny egg, and carnitas!", "author": "Brian N."}

Met up with an old friend I hadn't seen in over 10 years. I personally had never heard of this spot. It's a newer spot in the Mission only been up for a couple years. So, El Techo is a roof top experience hence the name \"El Techo\". My friend selected this restaurant because I am a very pick person & she had been here before & based off her last experience she just knew I would love it. \n\nWhen you're 1st coming into the building there's a hostess downstairs at the front door that assists you. Saturday was busy so there was a small 10 minute waiting period before we were buzzed and allowed to go the elevators to get upstairs. When you finally get pass the hostess and look straight ahead at what looks to be a dead end you'll see a green wall. If you look straight &\u00a0 to the left you'll see doors. Half way down the hall, before getting to those green doors, the elevator that takes you to the roof is on your left side. \n\nWhile waiting for the elevator my friend and I were having a really good conversation, as we're waiting I see this little Latino man dressed as a chef pushing a cart, I didn't pay him any attention at first, so our conversation continued. We got on the elevator letting the Latino man with the cart go first. Right before the elevator doors closed someone else that wasn't well kept got on with us. So my homegirl and I conversation continued. The elevator doors closed, I then looked to my left looking at the \"chef\" and what he was pushing in the cart. I was in the middle of finishing my sentence when I realized what I was looking at and said \"wait, our those f*c*ing tortilla chips?\" My homegirl then noticed and said \"oh my gosh, yes, those are the f*c*ing chips\"\n\nSo the \"chef\" had a cart with 3 different tiers/levels. Each tier had a big grey tub of tortilla chips in them. The 1st level had chips filled to the top with a damn dingy kitchen towel laying in the middle, whatever the towel wasn't covering was exposed to whatever germs. The 2nd level under it had the same set up. The 3rd tier (last bottom) didn't have ANYTHING at all over it\u00a0 so me and my smart mouth said \"oh gee, they serving us dirty chips, w/ a side of dirt particles that came off this guys Jean's, a long with the germs he just sneezed up and what ever spit particles came out of our mouths while we were talking\". Then I said wait, where did he come from with these chips?\n\nTo my understanding there's a kitchen downstairs that's connected to another restaurant that's behind one of the earlier mentioned green doors.which is cool but the chips were not covered properly. There at least should have been a layer of foil or plastic wrap covering those chips. When we got to the roof, I was totally disgusted about what I had seen. Now, the cooking area is a distance from the elevator, so the chef has to do a bit of walking through, passing up seated guest to get there. So that's more germs on top of those chips, plus the dirt particles & fibers flying off everyone's pants etc. \n\nWith this visit, I could not enjoy the food. We ordered a couple things, the skewer, & Mango. I did have some of what was on the skewer and I ate all of the fruits plus had a margarita, but I refused to have anything else. While we were having our sip, we sat and people watched, disgusted by how many people were eating these contaminated chips, wondering how often they transport them the way they do. \n\nI definitely won't be back to this place, EVER! Had I not seen that I would have thought this restaurant was top notch. Oh, and the roof experience isn't all that, Its very crowded they have entirely too many people crammed together at small tables and there are little bugs flying around that you have to swing your hand at from time to time to get them out the way.\n\nHad I not seen this, I would have thought this place was awesome.", "author": "Kenya S."}

There was a line downstairs in front of the entrance and as people leave, they let you go inside to take the elevator upstairs. \n\nIt's open seating, so once we arrived, we had to scramble to find a table. However, the view was spectacular. Along with the sunset, added heat lamps, and cocktails, I was actually pretty toasty for a spring evening. \n\nThey offer a pitcher form for the margaritas, and we ended up with the Margarita del Techo cause I love mezcal. Even though it was a solid margarita, the mezcal was quite lacking.\n\nWe also order some appetizers - the quesadilla, guacamole, and chicharrones de carne. I guess I didn't really read the fine print because the chicharrones de carne was not your typical pork rinds, but giant chunks of pork. It was tasty and well marinated, but I really wanted chicharrones of the pork rind variety.  I really enjoyed the black beans that they had though. It was just savory enough without being plain and the color was a little bit unusual and intriguing.\n\nCome early to this spot to meet with friends!

Dropped by around 9:30 pm on a Friday night for drinks and was met with a line as expected. It seemed to be going in pretty quickly so my friend and I didn't really mind the wait. Once we got upstairs, we were informed that the bar area was getting a bit too crowded and asked if we would mind sitting at a table. We didn't mind so we we hunkered down at a quaint little table.\n\nThis is where things really started to go down. Our server, who we had to prompt multiple times for water, essentially forgot about us after our first drink order. We were trying to flag him down for subsequent orders and eventually got so frustrated that we decided to leave rather than have more drinks. He spent so much time socializing with another one of his tables and even took a shot with the people there that it took him well over 30 minutes to get us our check once we were done. \n\nThe ambience here is great and the drinks are good, but the service was just such a turn off for me.

I mostly hate it because of the crowds now that it is THE cliche thing to do. \n\nThe menu was pretty solid. A few good vegetarian choices. Lots of random dishes with meat as well. The flavor was ok. Really lacking any spice, kick, flare. Maybe because they are used to drunk hipster bros and don't want people eating anything that'd make them throw up on the roof. I asked for any hot sauce and they had Tapatio. I dunno, something homemade would've been nice, even if I had to pay for it. \n\nThe Bloody Maria was so so at best.

It's reasonable though. Definitely reasonable. I wouldn't come here on a random notice to grab cheap Mexican food. But with friends, to introduce them to the city, or to celebrate a good feeling day, I wouldn't mind stopping by. You wait in line outside for the bar or sign up for a seated table at the hostess. Then, when it's your turn to enter, you respectfully pass through the apartment lobby into the elevator to EL TECHO (which means the roof in Spanish). It's really nice on the top. The view is wonderful. You can see a really nice city line view of Financial District. The rooftop bar is rather small though so it can feel a bit cramped. In the future, I'd probably stop by here with a reservation or something. Maybe, you could request to sit next to the edge of the roof so you get a fuller taste of the view. But I believe you can walk towards the edge to snap a picture of you and your friends real quick even if you're not sitting next to it.\nOrdered the chicharrones, empanadas and two cocktails. All of which were delicious. The salsa based sauce with the chicharrones is sooo good. Definitely compliments the dish completely. Drenched my tortilla + chicharrones in it. We ordered a half pound of chicharrones which totaled to $19. If you get full easily like me, this is enough food. But perhaps, if you have a bigger appetite, I would suggest ordering the one pound. Along with the empanadas, I was stuffed. There cocktails came out so pretty looking. I was impressed with the presentation. I ordered La Paloma, and mmMmmmmMm, so good and gives you that nice buzz from the tequila. You can order it in a cup or a PITCHER. THAT'S RIGHT. A PITCHER. When you order in a pitcher, each person gets a glass with an orange in it. Definitely a great place to grab a drink with friends if you reserve ahead of time. I forgot what my boyfriend ordered, but his drink was deelish too. \nIt was busy, so service was just okay. Took a while for them to get to us, and overall, they didn't seem super into entertaining us. But when the drinks, view and food are good. Then it don't mattaaaah.

When we got here around 2:50, there was already a line like around 5 parties. Right at 3pm the hostess started letting groups go up around every 5 minutes. \n\nWe started with chips and guacamole and a pitcher of margaritas. We wanted a side of salsa for the chips as well and got some but it came with more chips and they charged $3 even though it's not on the menu that they charge for salsa. \n\nFood: The guacamole was great, no complaints, but the salsa was one of the best salsas I've ever had!! Next time I would rather get chips and salsa, I feel like it goes better with margs anyways. Once 4pm hit, the kitchen reopened and we started with the veggie empanadas. They were delicious and were stuffed with sweet corn, spinach, and really good flavor. We also ordered the three skewers and got one vegetarian (for me), one meat (for my boyfriend), and one shrimp. (To split) Being a pescatarian, I actually liked the veggie skewer better, and my boyfriend did too!! The veggies were packed full of flavor! \n\nFor dessert we got the flan with pumpkin seed brittle on top. The flan was great and so was the pumpkin seed brittle but together it didn't work for us... would rather just have them both separate, so that's how we ended up eating it. \n\nService: Our service was okay. We started off with one server who was not the nicest... then when she was off, another server picked up our table and she ended up being very pleasant. \n\nAmbiance: The whole restaurant is outside on a patio overlooking the city! Our was amazing. We were right along the edge at a low table. This would be a cool place a night because you could probably see all of the city lights, and the patio is decorated in hanging lights as well.

At first we considered 620 Jones but decided against it since we knew it would probably be packed. El Techo was still new and poppin', so we decided to all meet there for happy hour. I was first to arrive around 5:00ish and took bart there on this particular evening. El Techo is located in the Mission district and is a convenient 5 minute walk from the 24th street mission bart station. I took the elevator up and arrived to the rooftop. When I walked out, I first noticed how busy the place was around 5:00 pm! I assumed that all of the locals and people working nearby were already here. All of the large tables were taken, but I spotted a a few seats on the ledge that was closest to the corner of the rooftop. The view wasn't anything spectacular, but it was definitely decent.\n\nI took a look at the menu and decided to try out the tostadas, chips and guacamole and a Margarita. The server greeted me when I first entered and dropped off some menus,  but it was very difficult to get her attention once I was ready to order. I waited for about 6 or 7 minutes until I was finally able to get her attention and put my order in. It seemed like they were pretty short staffed that night and they definitely could have used the help. As I waited for my food,I stayed on the lookout for a bigger table to open up. Naturally being from the east bay, I was freezing my tushy off. The winds were really whipping but the good thing about this place is that it comes equipped with heat lamps at the tables. \n\nMy Margarita arrived and the first thing I noticed was how much ice they put in it... a little too much. I took a sip and realized that it was watered down as well. Yikes, not a good first sign. One of my friends arrived, and sat with me on the ledge for a few minutes until  a table finally opened up for us. My food still hadn't arrived, and I asked the bartender what the status was since I noticed that a group of 3 that came after me received their chips and guacamole. She said that she would check with the kitchen to see what the status was. A few minutes later, she came back with my food and apologized for the long wait. I totally understand that things can get chaotic, so I really appreciated the apology. I bit into my tostada and it was cold. I think that she might have forgotten about my order or got confused when I switched tables? \n\nAs far as the taste goes, it was nothing special. It could have definitely used more flavor and the guac was bland and didn't taste fresh. The chips were good but tasted like they had been under a heat lamp for too long and were borderline stale. My friend also complained of her drink being watered down as well. We texted two of our other friends to\nsee where they were and found out that they were being held downstairs because the bouncer said that the bar was at capacity. Kind of sucked because several people kept asking us for the seats that we were holding for them. When they finally did arrive, we ended up having a fun night and made the best of it.\n\nWould I come to El Techo again? I probably would come back to give it another try,  but I will probably wait until the summer time when the weather is warmer and once they've worked out their kinks.", "author": "Shayla B."}

It's one of the most beautiful views of the San Francisco skyline in the entire Bay Area. I would highly recommend just coming for some drinks, because it doesn't get any better than getting your buzz on and basking in the sunset glow of our beautiful city. \n\nEverything else about the restaurant... food, prices, and service, is about a 3. I've been here multiple times and the service is pretty terrible. Customization on a specific order?--Forget about it. We simply asked for some sour cream and they had to go check with the kitchen to see if they could even do that. \n\nAnything you want that is not already out at the table or put in at the beginning of the order, you will likely not get. I wanted salt and pepper after my food was served--Fat chance! You want hot sauce--Sorry, sister!

Probably can only fit 2 dishes and 2 drinks, and that's after taking away the bulky utensil container.\n\nService: Our server was nice, but discouraged us (and tables around us) to order food.

When they finally opened, we weren't seated right away and instead, placed on a waitlist. We were probably seated around 11:30 and when we went up to the roof, our party of three was seated at the end of the table where two large parties were already seated and not to mention, underneath the sun. This was pretty ridiculous when about 70% of the tables (most with shade) were still empty. When I asked if we could possibly be seated at a table with some sort of shade (because it was HOT), the host kind of spazzed out and gave a huge and agitated spiel about how those seats were already reserved. I mean, I guess, but by the time we finished eating and left, there were STILL seats that were being held for reservations. I don't understand why we couldn't have just sat at those reserved seats if the party wasn't expected to arrive for another hour and a half.\n\nWith that weird start of our meal aside, the food itself was pretty good. We were only able to try the brunch menu, so I'd like to return one day to try their dinner. My boyfriend and I split the Huarache and a side of papas. The huarache was good and gave a decent portion of braised beef. I liked that it came with some shredded lettuce to give you a break from all the heavy carbs and meats. But it was nothing I'd order a second time. As for the papas - I've had better.\n\nChips and guac were good, but not good enough for being $10. Yikes.\n\nWe also got to try the carnitas, which were great but a little dry. \n\nWhen we were done, it took a while for us to track down our waitress. We could've probably been out of there 30 min earlier if the staff was a bit more attentive, which could have opened up a spot for another party earlier.\n\nMy rating is more a 3.5 than a 3.

So much so, we stayed for 4 hours! The drinks are fresh, and well crafted, especially when served with pebble ice. It's so perfect for an icy, refreshing drink without watering it down. We had the Hummingbird and Caipirinha drinks, one of which is a much smoother margarita than the traditional version. \n\nA HUGE shout out to our server DANIEL CHAVEZ (11051) who attended to us over the four hours, suggested the perfect drinks, and who provided the most excellent service. He was attentive, but not overbearing. And he continued his service even after presenting the bill never flinching when we started a new one. \n\nThe drinks and vibe were so good, we stayed! \n\nThe view is wonderful from the rooftop. And no worries about the cold and wind. They provide see-through wind screens when needed and heaters for a toasty time.\n\nWe dined on the Benedictos--the best version of eggs Benedict I've ever eaten. The eggs were consistent and impeccably cooked and the biscuits were to die for--toasty, yet moist. The dish was topped with chipotle hollandaise sauce which was light and not overbearing like some can be. For dessert, we had the Bunuelos, beignets sprinkled with powered sugar, and then we dipped them in dulce de leche--a smooth warm chocolate. The dessert is not too sweet but just right. The guacamole and stout chips are very good; however, next time I will ask for a bit of spice like jalapenos added to mine.\n\nWe had reservations and their website states that ONLY at brunch do they accept reservations. We were the first ones there and the place was crowded right away. It's a loud atmosphere no doubt charged by the several birthday parties taking place. Apparently, THIS is the place to celebrate.\n\nStreet parking is available, but it's less stressful to park at the public parking structure located at 3255 21st street. Rates are very reasonable.\n\nI was worried that there wouldn't be a lot to do in this area, but there are unique and hip shops located on Valencia to round out the day. Some are a bit quirky, which is why we like San Francisco.\n\nFor dinner we ate pizza at Beretta's nearby (See my review on Yelp), but I could have easily gone back to El Techo though we would have probably worn out our welcome. :)\n\nEl Techo is hip.

This is probably still the best rooftop bar I have been to in the city which provides great views of the city with good coverage from sun across the entire patio so you are not just sitting in the boiling heat. This place is fairly accessible by public transportation and has a ton of great eats right near it including Foreign Cinema which is what I was in the area for and figured I had 45 minutes to kill so why not the patio. This is my third time being here and I can speak to the happy hour specials they have going on and the drinks. \n\nThere always seems to be a line here to get onto the rooftop bar so readers beware to head there early if you want to grab a slot. I showed up at around 4:45 on a Friday and was able to find a spot on the patio where we ordered more than a few margaritas to enjoy the afternoon SF sun. Was able to order the guacamole and chips as well which was solid and of course we ended up devouring all the chips. The servers were moving as quickly as possible but the entire place was hopping so it took a little longer than expected. The drinks were good although not sure it was anything really special. This place is really to chill with a large group of people with a cool/hip vibe with amazing view of the city.

We drove 4 hours to visit San Fran for a birthday weekend for my roommate and I was trying to find a fun rooftop restaurant or bar that we could go to. This place had gotten so many good reviews and we waiting in line for over 20 minutes so I figured it had to be gold...unfortunately I was wrong. \n\nThe man working at the door was really nice and the hostess that greeted us at the top was extremely friendly but our server was AWFUL. I couldn't understand what the names for the items on the menu meant and so I would ask her a question about something and apparently I was just ruining her day with my curiosity. My husband didn't know what exactly he ordered because when she explained it to him she was very vague and super rude so he felt uncomfortable and just went for it. One of the cooks brought his food out asking if we had this and it didn't look like what he thought he ordered because everything seemed to come \u00e0 la carte and so the guy took it back. Well our server walks up with the same plate of food puts it in front of him and says, \"this actually is your food, trust me I know what I'm doing.\" \n\nWell then we waited another 10 minutes before the next plate of food arrived and then another 10 for the two others. By the time my friends received their food my husband and I were already finished and at this point our server had left for the night and said someone else would be taking care of us. \n\n\nI thought to myself, \"perfect!\" Maybe it'll actually be a better experience now! Unfortunately I was wrong. She barely spoke too words to us and acted as if we were such a burden for her. \n\nI kid you not I saw her turn around from a table with a massive fake smile and as she walked away she quickly scowled and rolled her eyes. Then she walks up to us to get the bill and my friend was holding it and says he has a question and she rips the bill out of his hand then asks what his question was. \n\nSeriously!? Was I at Dicks Last Resort or something? I actually think I had better service when I visited that place then El Techo. \n\nWe left still hungry from the extremely small portions of our misguided menu ordering, pissed off because of how rude the servers were and overall not happy.

Realizing that it is in Mission District, sort of a Latino low-income community, it seemed sketchy at first because of all the bums, but it turned out to be pretty cool. \nThis place so reminded me of LA, Echo Park area and the LA Arts District, very trendy and hipster.

It was good, but could have used a little bit more Chili. \nOverall, this place is great for a date (which there were a few there), hanging out with friends. It's a super trendy place.

Granted yes, the view isn't amazing, but also granted, there aren't many rooftop brunches around these parts, okay. I made reservations here via open table because the wait here can get crazy bananas. Street parking was scarce per usual as expected in SF. Once we found parking, we walked into the building and found two employees who let us know to take the elevator on up to El Techo. Shelby seated us right away and took our orders. We went with a number of items that I would get again:\n\nBunuelos (beignets, powdered sugar, dulce de leche): definitely a must get! Yum. The hot beignts with that sweet dulce de leche, I'm in love. These came out and disappeared in minutes.\n\nPan de Elote (jalapeno cornbread, pepper jelly): Very okay! It was good to try, but I probably would pass on this one because it was way too dry for me. The jelly was also really tangy, it caught me by surprise! \n\nHuarache (spinach and oaxaca cheese stuffed tortilla, tomato, braised beef brisket, fried eggs, pickled onion): The words stuffed tortilla and brisket was all I heard and I was all over it. The brisket was extremely tender and flavorful. \n\nTecho Rancheros (tortilla, pork, fried eggs, salsa verde, beans, guac) - looks and sounds different than the huarache, but while eating both of them, they tasted very similar. Not sure if that's good or bad, but I mean, it was delicious regardless. May possibly prefer the Huarache only because tender soft brisket over the pork in this dish, but honestly both are awesome. The rancheros are really moody from sitting in that sauce/broth! So if you're going with a friend, just get both and share!", "author": "Maleah M."}

We get there at 7:45pm and both a man and a woman were taking reservations at the door for rooftop dining; I called ahead of time and they wouldnt take reservations over the phone because it was Saturday. (Be warned if your whole party is not there, they wont let you go in). They have a separate area to stand in line if you just want to go upstairs to the rooftop for drinks. Gave my name, number for party of 3 and stood outside and waited a little over 40 + minutes until they finally texted us that we can go in. When we would check to see how long it would take, we were told: \"It shouldn't be long. You can go to our sister restaurant and wait until we text you. The party before you has already been seated and you are the only 3 party next in line. I'll check but its up to the lady upstairs how she decides to seat everyone\". Anyways, we finally go upstairs and yes the view is great - which is literally the only reason I gave it a 3. Imho I wasnt impressed and the hype was overrated. Our server literally checked on us once the entire time we were there and mind you our bill was well over $100 between food and drinks. When a crowd of men showed up, he was more focused on flirting with the men than he was making sure his other customers were okay. Take note that this place is not somewhere to go for dinner. This is more of a Latin/South American Tapas kind of place. Their sweet plantains were good. The carne asada skewer had 3 small pieces of meat and they were all burnt. The pulled pork quesadilla was okay. Their guac was good. Now comes the worst part of my experience. Handed the server my credit card for the bill and he turned around and walked straight to the table to flirt with the guys again, meanwhile not noticing that as he grabbed the check and card and walked away - he dropped my card! Thank goodness I happened to be looking in that direction, noticed my card on the floor and grabbed it. I was so angry because he was so careless and unfocused. What if he had lost my card? Id be stuck in a new city with no money and the possibility of someone using my card. So I sat at the table and waited to see what he would do. He checked his pockets several times, looked at the floor near the register/computer, walked around by the table where he was flirting, checked around our table then after everything finally had the nerve to ask, \"Excuse me, did you give me your card to pay your bill?\" I said, \"Yes and you dropped it on the floor\". Instead of apologizing and saying 'Im so sorry I dropped your card' all he said was \"Oh Thank God\" grabbed the card and walked away. At this point, I felt like he didnt deserve a tip; however, I still tipped him because I know many people live off tips and we never know what someone is really going through. I just thought to myself 'Karma' and considered it as a Pay It Fwd thing. All in all, aside from the nice view of the city at night, I have nothing positive to say.

Of course it's great to have brunch on a rooftop patio, but it can't be the only redeeming factor. The eggs benedict  was good and served on jalepeno corn bread, which was a nice change. The service was TERRIBLE!! After taking our order, our server was never seen again, until check time.

Go for the chicharrones, served with salsa, beans, tortillas and add a bit of lime. Delicious! A half a pound is enough for 2-3 to share. I also like the plantano maduro small plate, which are served with sour cream mixed with chili - again, add some lime to tie the sweet and savory flavors together. The Empanada de Carne is another good option - they have raisins which I usually don't like in empanadas, but the ones here aren't overpowering, and the chimichurri helps balance all the flavors.

I had read about it on Yelp and wanted to check it out. My mistake!\n\nAfter taking the elevator up, we were met with the hostess. She handed us the drink menu and said we can find our own seat. We were pretty confused because we didn't know if we had to order the drinks from the bar or from a server. We wondered around and walked to the bar. We saw two servers chatting and one of them saw us. Then with an annoyance said, Go have a seat and someone will take your order. He got even more annoyed when my friend asked him what was one of the drinks that was sitting at the bar. Without even looking at us, he said, third one from the top and went back to chatting. \n\nNormally, I would have suggested my friend to leave and go somewhere else. However, it was already late so we stayed. \n\nAfter finding a spot to sit, it took the server about 20 minutes to come to us. Once he came over, my friend asked for a recommendation. His reply was, didn't you ask me about that drink at the bar? I was thinking, yes, but we are asking for a recommendation, not about the drink at the bar.\n\nNow I'm annoyed and my friend said I will have whatever she (me) is having. We ended up getting 2 glasses of cava. Thanks for nothing!\n\nThen it took about 15 minutes for him to come back with our drinks. When we were ready to leave, of course it took about another 15 minutes to get the bill. \n\nThe only thing I liked about this place was the giant champagne flute they used for the cava and the heat lamps.

I understood why when I sipped my cocktail and took a bite of my food.\n\nI got the pomelo cocktail which was one of the best cocktails I've had to date. I'm a little picky about cocktails cause I don't like syrups and packaged mixes in them, just fresh ingredients and well mixed. THIS WAS EVERYTHING I DREAM OF IN A COCKTAIL. Not too sweet, perfectly mixed, and complex flavor, with all fresh ingredients. I'll be back specifically for that cocktail!\n\nOn to the food. I got the Benedict which was served on jalape\u00f1o corn bread and with and chili hollandaise. HOLY COW! I've never had such an amazing meal. The corn bread (which by the way has whole pieces of corn in it- YUM), with a layer of wilted spinach and then the perfect poached eggs with the drizzle of sauce. Perfection.

Like some of the other reviews, it is a little overrated.  We had to make a brunch reservation like 2 weeks in advance, and that to get a table at 1:00 PM.\n\nThe ambiance is what you would expect from a casual rooftop place with pano views of the city.  We didn't get a glamorous roof-edge table but rather one that was closer to the elevator.  I felt like I was basking in the sun though because my back and leg were not covered by the shades.  At first it was OK, but after a few mimosas, I felt like I was baking.\n\nFood/Drink wise:\n-Benedictos:  Not what I was hoping.  I thought the chorizo was going to be where the Canadian bacon would've been and not on the side.  The cornbread seemed like a good idea but because it's so much more moist than an English muffin, it crumbled more than hold each bite together.  I just felt like I was trying too hard to eat this.\n-Bunuelos:  Essentially equals beignets.  That is all.\n-Guacamole:  Seemed like they were bottomless???  But I wasn't sure.  Regardless, it was on point.\n-Mimosas with agua fresca were delicious!  I knocked by like two of them I think.\n\nOf note, one of the people we went with had ordered the Rancheros in the vegetarian option and got his with meat.

On a nice day, there will definitely be a long line of people on the sidewalk waiting to get in. Seating at tables is reserved for parties that are actually ordering food, otherwise bar-height seating it is. They do have heat lamps though, if it starts to get chilly outside.\n\nMy go-to drinks are the two tequila cocktails - la paloma and the margarita - which are both great and really refreshing!\n\nThe guacamole and chips make for a yummy snack but I''m actually not a huge fan of the menu. That's not to say that the food isn't tasty, but it just doesn't stand out to me that much. It seems to lie somewhere between bar food and classier Mexican.\n\nAll in all though, who doesn't love hanging out at a rooftop bar with some snacks and good drinks??

As a New Yorker I should've know that we needed to make a res during Saturday brunch. There was a line outside upon getting there and it look about 30 mins to get a table. I was curious as to what to expect from the outside - the front of the building is unassuming - I actually think it's on the roof of an apartment building. The space itself was larger than I thought, with amazing views of the SF skyline. The guac was decent and for my actual meal I got the chilaquiles - it was unique in that at least 70% of the dish was chips and the other 30% were basic scrambled eggs...honestly, my favorite part was the salsa on the chips. Probably wouldn't go back if I was in the neighborhood again, but once again, it's all about the scene I think.", "author": "Ali C."}

Didn't have reservations, but the wait that weekend afternoon wasn't too bad.  It's a little confusing on how they take you in - there was a line standing out front waiting and at the same time, folks were just going up to the hostess stand.  I walked up, added my name, and they told me to come back when my whole party was there so they could \"activate\" my spot.  They'll text you when your table is ready and you have about 10 minutes to get back there.\n\nYou take the elevator up a few floors and end up at their rooftop restaurant.  The top is covered, so you could still eat there on rainy days.  The view was alright - you could see downtown from far away and into the tops of the other buildings closer by.  Crowd was a bit younger - 20s/30s, so it's slightly louder (probably not a place to have any quiet conversations, though a few tables to the side might not be bad).  \n\nMenu isn't extensive for brunch/lunch - makes it easy to order, but selections are limited.  I decided on the french toast ($12), guac & chips ($7), and a sangria ($7).  I was a little disappointed that the sangria didn't come with chunks of fruit (besides an orange slice); have had much better sangria before.  The french toast was OK, not overly impressive, and I did feel it was a little pricey for what you got.  Chips and guac were OK as well.  Portion sizes were average - this is not the place where you'd have leftovers to take home.  Some of the utensils also looked a little dirty, or perhaps just not wiped off after washing.    \n\nService was OK.  \n\nI'm not sure if I'd be back - perhaps just for a small appetizer or drinks.

All ya got to do is gently flavor with fresh peppercorn, salt, or blend up some sauce or some dried rub on the skewers and it'd be completely transformed.

The flip side to this statement is that I find it nearly impossible to get in on certain nights of the week due to demand. I think it's more of a seasonal thing, since people in San Francisco have different definitions of cold than other parts of the continent. Usually there is a lineup outside, and it can get pretty lengthy. They'll take your number and let you know when your spot is ready (which allows you to hit up another bar while you wait).\n\nLast time I was here was during a downpour, but they had everything protected nicely with large tents inside, and a small canopy for the walk from the elevator. It was definitely an interesting view with the rain and tent combo at night. The best time for a view is definitely when it's still light out, and you can soak up all that sun on the nice rooftop.\n\nThe food I've ordered here has all been tapas style, my favourite being the guac and chips.

When we arrived at El Techo, our party checked in but we couldn't go up until we were called and until every person in our group was there.

I didn't realize that El Techo was related to Lolinda, and I had visited Lolinda for dinner only a few weeks prior. I heard about the awesome rooftop bar, so I was excited to have both drinks and brunch here.\n\nNina and I arrived for our 11am reservation, only to find a long line out the door. Apparently everyone was waiting to get onto the elevator. We didn't make it to the rooftop until around 11:20am. So much for making a reservation. Once we were seated, we were spoiled with excellent service by our waiter. I wish I could remember his name.\n\nWe started off with cocktails, of course. I learned a very important lesson that day. NTS: Do NOT order a Bloody Mary with tequila (called a Bloody Maria) because it is not your cup of tea. Stick with vodka. Nevertheless, we enjoyed a beautiful view of the Mission District. If you are looking for a good brunch place in San Francisco and it's a sunny day, come here and sit facing the city.\n\nWe split a Benedictos and a half pound of Chicharrones de Carne. The Benedictos was alright. I was not a fan of the overpowering jalapeno cornbread, but it's always fun to try new styles of Benedicts. The Chicharrones de Carne is a MUST. Another friend recommended them to me, and those made the whole trip worthwhile. #MEAT\n\nI would definitely come back here again, perhaps in the evening for a rooftop cocktail. I would also recommend any other brunch fanatics to add this to your list, specifically the Chicharrones!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

When you arrive, you first have to check in downstairs with a counter attendant lady before you can go upstaris. She is not the friendliest person. This is a popular restaurant, so there is quite a bit of a wait, especially if you have a large group. However, you can hop over next door to Lolinda's for drinks. There are two bars inside, one upstairs and one downstairs. If you don't finish your drinks by the time your table is ready, you can bring it up to the rooftop with you. There are heaters upstairs, so you won't freeze. The area is enclosed with clear covering, which blocks most of the wind, but part of the view as well. \n\nUpon arrival, we received chips and guac. The guac is really good. The waiter said the tostadas here was very popular, so that was what I ordered for dinner. It is a crispy tortilla with tomato braised beef brisket, pickled onion, cabbbage, queso fresco, and black beans. It tasted sweet. The pickled onion did not really taste pickled, but it was better that way. The pricing is not too bad too, it was only $8 for the tostadas, which came as a pair.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere and food here is great, but I didn't think the view was that spectacular.

My favorite was the pollo frito. It's meat from the thigh, but there are no bones. It was seasoned really well, and I really liked the sauce that came with it. \n\nThe ambience was just ok, as well.

A bit cray. Not really a place to relax, which is fine.\n\nThe wait outside can be long due to proximity of the space (small!) They can't let anyone in until someone comes out. So, that kind of blows. I think you can make reservations for dinner though but didn't find any section for it on the site, maybe you need to call? I highly recommend doing so if that's an option.\n\nANYHOW!\nI've been wanting to come for ages and glad I finally did but don't think I'll return.\n\nI ordered the chiccarones de carne that everyone raves about (half pound - for 2 people) and although it was good, I wouldn't come back just for it.\nThe meat was tender and easily shredded with a fork.

For starters, the view is seriously breathtaking and the rooftop life is just so great especially when it's a little sunny outside! \n\nIn terms of food, here are a few highlights (I also order vegetarian for everything, but bet it would be awesome with Meat): \n- Eggs Benedict - the Jalapeno cornbread is so moist and has such a great kick to it! \n-Techo Rancheros - I wish the fried egg was less over done, but the overall dish itself was super tasty and the hot sauce was great! \n-Scramble - just your regular scramble but so much flavor from the chipotle and roasted potatoes! \n-Guacamole and chips - I wish chips naturally came with your dish, but the guac had a great avocado and lime tastee!! \n-Bunuelos (Beignets) - Same consistency as a donut and that carmel sauce is so decadent! \n\nTop all this off with their really intentional servers and drinks - this is one of the best brunch spots in the city! Our server was super nice and always asked if we needed anything. In addition to this, the sangria packed a real good punch and was not too aggressive. I would come here again in a heart beat.

Rooftop dining and an affordable menu?! Yes, please! My boyfriend and I dined here on Valentine's Day. El Techo only takes reservations for their weekend brunch, unfortunately; but we only had to wait about 15 minutes and it was 7 pm! The restaurant's system texts you when your table is ready and you have 10 minutes to claim it. You take an elevator to the rooftop, where you are greeted by another hostess and taken to your table. As soon as the elevator doors opened, I was blown away by the view. The view was definitely the best part..\n\nOur waitress lacked personality, and it took her forever to come back to take our order, though we made eye contact several times. The other waiters/waitresses/busboys who we came into contact with, however, were so friendly and personable. This place definitely has a fun atmosphere! So much so that it was so incredibly loud.

Nothing makes me cringe like overhearing people simultaneously rave about and butcher \"el tecko.\"\n\nNow that I finally got that off my chest, this is about as good of a view you'll get in San Francisco with all the perks of outdoor drinking. For being such a beautiful city, there is literally an abysmal amount of rooftop bars. There are a couple of outdoor patio bars a couple of floors up and there are a few higher up indoor bars with great views, but El Techo is pretty much the only one that encompasses both.\n\nFormerly Medjool, It took a little longer to open the rooftop after it became Lolinda, so the first time I came here the windows were super dirty and sort of took away from the view. I didn't return for nearly two years, but now it's one of my go to spots for having a chill day or night. You get a gorgeous, north-facing view of San Francisco's famous skyline, all while getting to enjoy delicious bar bites and just as delicious cocktails.\n\nMy second favorite part after the view-- the selection of Latin American liquors. Mezcal and pisco are my poisons of choice pretty much everywhere they're offered, and El Techo de Lolinda has some great cocktails with both. Palomas are great tequila drinks in general, but I often sub in mezcal to cut the citrus with some smokiness. El Escorpi\u00f3n is a sweeter, bright pink mezcal drink with prickly pear and ginger... also very good. For pisco, I either get the chilcano or a good ol' pisco sour. Recently I ordered the carioca with Brazilian cachaca, and that was also very refreshing. Drink prices run $9-13, which is pretty average now for anywhere even slightly upscale in the city, but I guarantee they are yummy. They also have pitchers so you can share with friends (or drink more to yourself, who knows).\n\nNow let's talk food-- ceviche is a must. It's not quite as spectacular as the ceviche in the restaurant downstairs, but it's definitely a good filler with chips since they're pretty generous with shrimp. The carne skewers are also really delicious because they're grilled to juicy perfection and smothered in Lolinda's amazing chimichurri *droolz*. My friend got the chicharrones once, and it was a little overwhelming having a literal pound of pork shoulder to just dig in on. Instead, try the quesadilla de pibil for your porky fix because they're also bomb.\n\nTips: This place can get pretty busy on warm days (since those days are pretty rare), so brace yourself.

So when Mr. Sun decided to make an appearance this last weekend and I had a visitor in town, we made a run for El Techo. The brunch menu has just enough to give you variety without being incredibly overwhelming. There's not many sweet treat options (I think just one French Toast option on this particular day) so just note that if you're a pancake fiend. \n\nFor two people with no rezzys, we were still seated right away along the ledge (bar stools) with direct views of the skyline. We started off with some boozey brunch drinks (I recommend the Palomar I think it's called- tequila/grapefruit/lime/agave/soda) and my friend had a fresh squeezed pineapple mimosa. The ceviche was my least favorite thing we ordered, IMO it didn't taste very fresh and the portion was so tiny for $13 of chopped shrimp with small bits of barely existent avocado. I'd skip this next time.\n\nBut I was very pleased with my gallo pinto (the most tasty rice and beans I have ever had!) with fried eggs, fresh corn tortillas, and fried plantains. My friend had the eggs benny which come with a Spanish flare (I think like a chipotle hollandaise over jalapeno cornbread). Next time I want the side of cornbread instead of the ceviche.

Time flies! My biggest Yelp friend Mark A. recommended this place for my birthday dinner and it turned out perfect! \n\nI made reservations for ten and almost twenty people showed up. It was beyond hectic with a lot of my friends stuck downstairs by the elevator and the staff was doing their best to accommodate everyone. They did a fantastic job handling everything! The structure is kind of bizarre though considering its a restaurant/bar. It kind of has a club set up where people have to lineup downstairs and wait until people leave before they can take the elevator upstairs to the roof. \n\nI can't remember if I had it on a Friday or a Saturday but it was absolutely packed. Definitely try to come here early or make reservations for a table. The roof has a super trendy ambiance. Its loud, dark, and perfect for a birthday party. It was seriously the best birthday I had in my entire life. Food was great, ordered a ton of pitchers. Was never cold under the heat lamps except for when I had to go to the bathroom it was freezing around the corner. I would give it five stars but our tab was through the roof!

Our party of 10 was able to get a table closest near the view of the city, but the only thing was that we didn't have a heating lamp nearby, so most of us were pretty cold. I have to say though, never have I ate out on a rooftop before, so my first experience was amazing! The view of the city was SO beautiful, especially because the sun was setting and you were able to see the city lights, as well as the bay bridge.\n\nThe menu is very short and simple, which made it easy to order what we wanted to order. For my order, I ended up getting the quesadilla de pibil and the pamola drink (our whole table got two pitchers worth of it). I was also able to taste a bit of the chocolate tres leches cake and the flan.\n\nTHE QUESADILLA WAS AMAZING. The tortilla was thin,yet crispy. It reminded me of a pupusa  because of how it was made, but the braised pork was juicy and tender. The salsa that came along with my quesadilla had a citrus taste to it which actually went so well with it. Alongside the chocolate tres leches cake, I wished it had a bit more milk in it because it tasted like a chocolate cake with milk and coconut, but in the back of your throat, you taste a bit of sweetness from the condensed milk (but still pretty good!). Also, the flan was SUPER creamy. The custard itself was so light and airy, definitely felt like a cloud in my mouth. Lastly, the Pamola drink was pretty good! I don't think that much since I'm not much of the drinker, but the tequila wasn't overpowering and you were able to taste a bit of the grapefruit in the drink.\n\nMy dining experience was pretty great, but the only downside was that it took a while for servers to take our order since we were on the very opposite side of everything, there was really no space for us to move around a bit, and every single table had a heating lamp near them besides us. So, besides a few cons, I would definitely come here and explore their menu more.", "author": "Trisha L."}

Note that if you want dinner here, tell the person at the front so they can put you on the waitlist and you can go to other bars around the area before they notify that your table is ready through a text message. So my friend and I didn't have to wait long at all and immediately got to ride the elevator up within 10 minutes or so waiting in line.\n\nWe ordered their margarita and chilcano, with a side of their chips and guacamole. We also decided to try their carne empanadas and their chicharron later on in the evening. The chicharron was by far my favorite dish! It comes with tortillas, black beans, salsa, vegetables, and pork shoulder (you choose the portion size!) I loved the glaze and flavoring of the pork shoulder! The portions look small, but they got me pretty full by the end of the meal (my friend's a big guy, and he was full even with leftovers). All in all, it was a great experience! We were about to leave, but I wanted to stick around and enjoy the atmosphere of lights hanging above our heads, heat lamps, and the beautiful night view of the city.. so we ended up snagging a free-for-all table and enjoyed another round of drinks.

A carafe is $18 at HH, so we got three of them... There were four of us and we left feeling the perfect buzz. There are some bites during HH as well - Chips and Guacamole, Empanadas, and Chicken Fritters all for about $5, which is so much cheaper than their regular menu price. \n\nThere is a beautiful view of the city (especially because there are zoning laws that don't allow buildings higher than 40 feet in some neighborhoods) so we got a great view of the downtown skyline from where we were.

Neither of us were cold. \nThe food and service here is great! We ordered the Guacamole, Chicharrones de Carne, and the Shrimp Ceviche (?).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-27", "description": "If only more restaurants could follow what \"El Techo de Lolinda\" does, then we'd all be taking breathtaking photos. And the reason I say this is because the view of San Francisco from this place already had me sold. I'm a sucker for scenery and in this day in age where just above everyone is posting pictures on their Instagram, Facebook, and Yelp, we've all become talented photographers over the past few years. Well, I'm more going to focus on the food, service, and experience that I encountered here.\n\nLocated in the heart of the Mission District on 21st and Mission St's, \"El Techo de Lolinda\" is one of the trendiest Tapa rooftop bars in the city by the bay. I came here on a foggy (but rather cold) Sunday evening with my fianc\u00e9e, our friend, and his wife. Since I have never been to this place before, I had no idea what to expect. After we parked in the nearby parking garage, we walked to the front of the building where the hostess said there would be a little bit of a wait. Luckily it was only about 5 minutes and were proceeded to go inside.\n\nThis is where we took an elevator three flights up to the roof! Keep in mind for those that want a warm indoor dining experience; you will be sitting outdoors on a roof! However, the entire roof is shielded and protected by plexiglass as well as many heating lamps to keep you snug during those extremely chilly San Franciscan days (and nights). There are many tables situated throughout the rooftop as well as a separate bar area, a main kitchen area, and restrooms that are towards the rear of the rooftop. The main building itself looks as if there are several apartments that are below this place. I sure hope these walls are sound-proof because up top it gets awfully noisy!\n\nOnce all four of us are seated, we do notice how cramped everything is. I literally bumped into the person behind me when I moved my chair so it can get a bit claustrophobic. But overall, none of us were cold by any means even though the air temperature felt as if it was about 54\u00b0. Our server hands us menus while we all decide on what to order. Since this is a \"Tapa-styled\" place, they offer a nice variety of smaller plates. And the menu is very South American; much like what you'd expect if you were dining in Argentina or Chile.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I decided on splitting an order of their \"1lb. \"Chicharrones de Carne\" (for $22.00). This is essentially roasted and fried pork-shoulder belly chunks complete with their own house made tortillas, lime, salsa, and Escabeche (which is a type of marinade mixed in with the pork). We also decide on ordering a side of \"Guacamole\" (for $7.00) which included tortilla chips and Cotija cheese set over black refried beans. And since this was our last meal before heading back home (to Sacramento), we decided to skip the alcoholic beverages and settle with good old Mexican Coca-Cola. However, they do offer a very respectable cocktail bar which also includes an excellent amount of beer, wine, and sangria.\n\nAs busy as it was (every table was filled), our server was always upbeat and in a positive mood. Our chips and guacamole came out in less than 5 minutes while our Chicharrones de Carne arrived just 10 minutes after that. I've gotta say, the portions here are huge! The overall flavor was very tasty but a little bit on the sweet side. The meat itself was very tender, juicy, and had good consistency to it. Luckily we were able to spice it up with some green Habanero sauce. I definitely think this was more than enough food to feed 3 or even 4 people but I was quite satisfied with how this came out. \n\nI do have to say, if it wasn't for the rooftop bar as well as how positive our server was, I'd only give this place 3-stars. But the experience all in itself is what makes \"El Techo de Lolinda\" unique in comparison to other places I've dined at. If you're only going for small bites or even a light brunch during Happy Hour, then this view is worth checking out.

Plus, it's outside, which makes you feel all the more connected with the city~~\n(4) Yummy alcohol \n- get a pitcher of the margarita (La Paloma is about $10 cheaper and still very tasty) or the sangria! Yum. \n(5) Heat lamps on chilly days \n- very helpful for those random August Sundays when you thought it would be sunny and 80 but it's actually foggy and 60. \n(6) Gallivant around the Mission afterwards because it's the best neighborhood in town \n- Ritual for afternoon coffee! Bi Rite for afternoon ice cream! Valencia Street for afternoon window shopping! Dolores Park for afternoon lounging! The Mission is your oyster! \n\nWhat's good here: \n* Benedictos (two poached eggs, jalapeno cornbread, chorizo, spinach, chile hollandaise) = my favorite. You don't get a huge amount of food, but the jalapeno cornbread is to die for. \n* Chorizo scramble (roasted vegetables, chorizo, avocado, potatoes, chipotle, brioche) = quite a bit of food, if you tend to eat more. Delicious combination of flavors that doesn't leave you feeling like a blob of lard. \n\nTip #1: Make sure you watch the elevator button after you press it. For some reason, the last 2 times I've gone the elevator comes down but then just sits there without opening (the button light turns off). Then when someone else comes and presses the button and it opens, you feel like a complete fool. DON'T BE A FOOL! WATCH THE BUTTON!! \n\nTip #2: Want to take pictures of the fantastic view? Sure, take some in the main dining area, but there's an open area by the bathrooms (on the right side of the elevator if you're facing it) where you can take photos to your heart's desire without bothering other patrons of the restaurant.\n\nTip #3: It's pronounced El Techo. Like Te-cho with a ch. Not tecko. Yes, we're in the city of tech, but the origin of the name is from Spanish (el techo means roof).", "author": "Christine L."}

So El Techo has been on my list forever and ever, but the rumors of insane crowds and the booked-out-for-weeks reservations on OpenTable scared me off a tad. \nWe got extremely lucky and wandered up right before 3 p.m, when they turn over from brunch. We joined a growing line (seriously it felt like entering a nightclub, but the hipster sf version) and went up right away! Awkward gentrification guilt and moral panic aside, this spot is amazing. You can't beat the view of the city, and on a nice day you can see absolutely everything. \nWe didn't eat anything, and split a pitcher of maragaritas. I was surprised at how reasonably priced drinks are here, I guess even the hottest spot in the Mission is more affordable than a mediocre bar in FiDi or Soma. The margaritas weren't the strongest but they were tasty. \nThe service was great for us as well. Our waiter was really cool and suggested we go ahead and get a pitcher, since if either of us got a second drink it would be the same price. He delivered our drinks and disappeared until the literal second our bottle of water was empty. Replaced immediately, and away he goes again. I'm stunned at how smooth operations are here given how packed it is 24/7. \nOverall, this is a gem in the city. Knocking off a star because getting here is a pain, and if you aren't here at 2:40 you won't get in without a huge wait.

Thankfully I arrived early and got a table because they reach max capacity around 6pm. \nWhile waiting for my friends to join I ordered La Paloma, chip & guac and the beef empanadas. \nThe food arrived quickly and I made haste on the guac. Eventually I moved over to the empanadas. \n\nUnfortunately, there was an odd object in my empanada mixture. At first I thought it was bone while I was chewing and thought, yeah that can happen but upon further inspection the item was a twist of metal and looked similar to the twisted part of a wine cage for beer/sparking beverages. \nNaturally I stopped eating and after about 5 min of waiting for the waitress, I pointed out the object. She offered to take it off my bill and offered to replace the meal with the identical item. As a Chef the first thing I would do is remove that item from the menu. It would be 86'd for the evening. A hazardous item was in a mixture that is prepped out for many servings.\nOffer something else would have been acceptable but not the same item. It's careless to offer the item again and potentially have others experience this hazard. What's a couple hundred of dollars in food cost vs someone else finding that item again. Them choking in it. I declined the offer. \nAs I continued to sip on my drink I wondered if a Manager would arrive and apologize for the incident. Thank me for pointing it out and assure me that it was removed from the menu. Well that never happened. \n\nPerhaps 15 min later my waitress returned to say that something would be sent over and to not be surprised. I wondered again, why send something out before asking if I was allergic to anything? \n\nSo far it's a no on the return to el techo. \nOther issues: \nSat and 3 water glasses presented but no water. \nFinished my drink and was not asked if I wanted to order another.\nReceived an apology of sweet Fried Plantains. However it was to replace a savory item (Not a dessert fan) Why didn't anyone ask? \n\nIn the service industry when something unfortunate happens to a guest you try your best to make the experience better.

Avoid the wait, make a reservation! The place is constantly busy, so just don't run the risk of having to wait.  There's a host right at the door of the restaurant that checks you in and makes sure your table is ready. If all is good to go then you walk over to the elevator and take it up to the rooftop restaurant.  There's a host to greet you by the elevator and shows you to your table. \n\nService was pretty solid. Our waitress was nice, but hard to find sometimes. We had to grab her attention a few times for boxes and our check.\n\nWe started off with drinks, which I got the Michelada.  It was executed perfectly! I love Pacifico, so I was bound to like this michelada. They added the perfect amount of lime and chili. The rim was lined with a chili/salt mixture that was perfect to get a nice extra spicy kick from each sip. \n\nNow for the food:\n\nChicharrones de Carne (1/2 Pound $15): This was more than enough for the 3 of us. I had no idea the portion size would be that big. It seemed a lot more than 1/2 pound, but I'm not complaining! More leftovers for me! I've had all different takes on chicharonnes.  Whether it's all crispy skin or super crispy meat and skin.  This take was definitely more on the meaty side.  There was a good crisp to it, but still tender where you could pull the meat apart. It had a sweet and savory taste to it as if sugar was lightly sprinkled on top.  It was really delicious! They provide salsa, lime, and tortillas to go with it. They also provided escabech, which reminded me of Asian shrimp chips. \n\nCeviche de Camaron ($13): So glad I ordered this and not a full brunch entr\u00e9e after inhaling those chicharrones.  The ceviche was perfectly light and refreshing.  There were plenty of shrimp in there, so don't worry about them skimping you. \n\nQuesadilla de Pibil ($11): My sister ordered this and loved the taste of the pork.  It was marinated and braised to perfection. The tortilla they used wasn't too heavy and appeared to be homemade. If you're a fan of quesadillas then these definitely won't disappoint you.\n\nBenedictos ($14): Holy jalapeno cornbread! They literally put a brick of cornbread on your plate.  To me it seemed like a bit too much cornbread, but my cousin seemed to enjoy it.  He eats a lot, so that may explain it. I tasted some of it and I will say that the cornbread was indeed delicious! If you're going to order this, just be make sure your stomach is well prepared. It's a heavy dish!\n\nOverall, a great brunch spot! The rooftop was nice, but the view wasn't anything spectacular.  But, really? Can you expect to get a truly great view of the Mission? Also if you're not seated directly next to the edge of the building, you won't really see anything.  It's always nice to enjoy brunch outdoors though! And yes, the place is a tad bit pricey. But, I already looked at the menu and knew what I was getting myself into before I dined here.

I think we got there around 9-930. There was a ridiculous line for the bar, but if you go to the front and tell them you want to just eat at the restaurant they'll put your name down and the wait cuts down from an hour to half an hour probably. Haha no but really I think we waited half an hour to get in. \n\nBut their food is soooooo worth the wait. The chicharones!!! It's life changing. Their tortillas are thicker than usual but also soft, and SO delicious. The meat's super tender and smoky flavor to it. Their chile sauces and even their pickled side of veggies (cauliflower, carrots, peppers) that come with it. Everything about the dish was just so well put together and so good. It's the first food I was craving as soon as I got back to LA. \n\nMy friend says their drinks are also really good. Too bad I wasn't in the drinking mood that night.

I'd tried going to El Techo de Lolinda years ago, but it was a nice day and the wait was 1.5 hours. So I gave up and went to another destination. On Thursday, August 13th around 8pm, I decided to try again. We were a party of three and only waited about 15-20 mins in line. We got drinks and snacks.\n\nChuzos: three skewers ($19)\n*Carne (+$1): flap meat, onion, zucchini, panca glaze\n*Pollo: chicken, red onion, aji amarillo glaze\n*Chorizo: hand-made chorizo, panca glaze\nThe skewers had a nice char. The chorizo had great flavor and the chicken was tender. The steak was a little overcooked for me and too chewy.\n\nDrinks:\n*Sangria: red wine, brandy, citrus, pineapple ($25 pitcher)\n*La paloma: pueblo viejo tequila, grapefruit, agave, lime, soda ($10 single)\n*Chilcano: huamani pisco, lime, passion fruit, ginger, bitters ($10)\n*Tres amigos: ocho plata, victoria lager, house sangrita  ($10)\n\nI thought all of their drinks were kind of weak. The sangria was very light. I wanted it to pack more of a punch. I also ordered the Chilcano thinking it'd be refreshing, but it was very sweet. I'd definitely pass on this next time. I ended up trading drinks with a friend and drinking his La Paloma instead. A better balance of sour and sweet.\n\nEven though I love rooftop bars, I hate feeling like a sardine. It feels that way here. It's a little too crowded and unorganized. We were left roaming around trying to find a spot to sit.

I've been here on a few occasions visiting SF. I am sucker for a good view and this is definitely one of the best. I usually only come here for drinks and to see the city lights.

So grab a drink and chill. They sent a text once our table was ready and we were seated pretty quickly once we got upstairs. We ordered chips and guacamole to start and although I've heard complaints about the price, I rather expect to pay a little more in bigger cities so I didn't mind. Food is served tapas style and we ordered Tacos de Pescado and Pollo Frito to share. The tacos were bigger than most I've see at tapas style restaurants and we were very happy with the flavor as well. The Pollo Frito was tender and not overly fatty which can sometimes happen with chicken thighs. The salsa was good as well. Although it contained habanero it didn't strike me as being too hot.  I also ordered their sangria which is some of my favorite sangria ever. I highly recommend it.

Poor me. Jk it was good though. Our server was nice, but a little busy so she took awhile to bring the check.

The brunch menu was pretty limited FYI. I got the hurache, which I enjoyed a lot. The pickled onions were spicy though and an unnecessary addition. I also got the peppermint tea which was good and not too strong. \n\nOverall: I don't think I would go out of my way to come back here for brunch, but I've heard the pork quesadilla at dinner is amazing.", "author": "Jenna G."}

Seriously, it's good and will have your taste buds dancing. This is what you come here for and sure, yes, the view, but really, just the chicharrones y carne, por favor.\n\nThe wait is no fun to get up to the rooftop where the food and fun are located but once you're up there, the space heaters and selection of drinks will keep you warm, toasty, and buzzy.

Go to the sides of the restaurant to see the twinkling lights of the Mission.\n\nThe lines to get in can be daunting. There is a hostess counter at the entrance to the elevator that takes you upstairs. Once you get upstairs, you grab whatever seat you can get. Probably best to come with a group of four or less, if you're wanting to eat. It's a lively, bustling environment. All the food and drinks I've had there have been reasonably priced and tasty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-06", "description": "El Techo is like the touristy spot for locals--it's fairly well known by San Franciscans, loved on Thrillist, packed to the brim, and is among the most Instagramable places featuring gourmet grilled skewers and sangria on a rooftop bar over a view of Downtown SF (albeit an often foggy view).\n\nFor those like me who are not too familiar with Latin American food beyond Tex-Mex fare, I strongly suggest looking at pictures ahead of time, or else everything on the menu will sound similar and you'll spend too much time poring over the menu when you should be soaking up the view.\n\n(+) CHUZOS (mix n match 3 skewers for $19): Pricey but recommended. El Techo is affiliated with the famous Lolinda Argentinian steakhouse for a reason. Although there are more burnt parts than my OCD-about-carcinogens self would have liked, their grilling technique is distinctly delicious: flavorful, tender, and unbelievably juicy. The only problem is the same with all skewers i.e. how difficult it can be to get them off the stick (only here it's worse because it's pricey and it would be terrible if any pieces were to fall to the ground.\n\n(+) Camarones (white shrimp, aji amarillo glaze, salsa criolla, add $3): Price addition on top of the already pricey menu seems steep, but there will be no regrets. The charred fresh shrimp with the piquant sauce is very memorable, and the thick layer of onions and cilantro garnish makes it ever more interesting. \n\n(++) Pollo (chicken, red onion, aji amarillo glaze): Who knew chicken could be so juicy omg. This is magical.\n\n(+) Vegetales (zucchini, eggplant, onion, pepper, aji amarillo, minus $1): lol minus $1. Not bad and the chopped cilantro topping adds complexity, but didn't blow me away the way the shrimp and chicken did. Though I'm not a big carnivore, I would recommend the meat options.\n\n(++) CHICHARRONES de CARNE (roasted and fried chunks of pork-shoulder with house made tortillas, lime, salsa, escabech, half lb for $15): The fatty tender pork belly we enjoy in ramen, in roast pig form. It could have used a bigger container of the spicy salsa, but overall the tenderness and the seasoning with a big kick made this my favorite at El Techo. If I were omnivorous before, the chicarrones de carne would make me an omnomnomivore if not a carnivore. \n\n(-) SANGRIA (red wine, brandy, citrus, pineapple, pitcher $25): A pitcher lasts you awhile to enjoy the view, but was meh. Couldn't taste the brandy, no strong taste of infused fruit, and seemed a bit diluted; I personally prefer DIY sangria, but a cocktail pitcher completes the bar dining experience.\n\nPricey, crowded, and local-touristy, but definitely a bucket list necessity!", "author": "Edna C."}

It was a Wednesday at 5PM and I was meeting my husband and a friend on the rooftop for cocktails. They had been there a while already and told me just to come up. It was my first time at El Techo so I didn't realize there was a hostess sitting there that you had to check in with. When I walked passed her, she shouted at me to check in. I was taken aback because there were no signs or anything that say \"YOU MUST CHECK IN\" and normally, when you have friends at a restaurant already, you can just go straight in to meet with them. She then told me that I needed to have my husband tell the hostess on the rooftop my name and then that hostess would have to come down to her and tell her it was okay for me to go up. This seems kind of ridiculous, considering it was a Wednesday and there was plenty of space once I actually got in. I would understand if it was busy, but the hostess told me they were at capacity...which I did not believe. I was very confused and all she told me to do was stand at the nonexistent line and wait until she approves me to go in. I'm not sure if this is actually the protocol, but from my interaction with the hostess, it seemed like she was just making me do these extra things because she thought I was being rude when I walked by her and didn't check in. After 10 minutes of calling my husband, asking him to come down, I finally was \"allowed\" to go in. Needless to say, this put me in a very sour mood and I won't be coming back even if the views are great and the happy hour drinks are cheap.

Everything seems super fresh here. \n\nThe more recent time I came, tried one of the mezcal cocktails. The bartenders are solid and the service is really nice. We sat at the bar upstairs, and he was always attentive and quick. We had the braised pork belly and ceviche. Both were absolutely delicious. The pork belly blew me away both in flavor, presentation, and portion size. Something I'd definitely see myself ordering again. The ceviche was also top notch. Fresh, flavor was spot on and again to share between two people -- it was the perfect size. \n\nEl Techo is pretty grand inside with seating on the ground floor and huge second floor space with a nice sized bar up there, too.

We didn't arrive until 9:15pm but only waited about 20 minutes for a table. If you are only there for drinks then the wait is much longer and you have to get in line outside on the sidewalk. If you go for dinner they take your name and number and text you when a table is ready. We went next door to have a drink while we waited. \n\nThe views were pretty amazing despite the foggy night.

Such mixed feelings about this spot.\nIt is hard to find a rooftop bar in San Francisco hence the often MASSIVE lines outside of El Techo on a weekend when everyone in the Mission decides to go out at the exact hour.  But, if you're lucky and passing by with no line, El Techo is worth checking out.  I have been here three times and have always enjoyed the view/drinks but have not enjoyed the service.  Although they do make sure to not overcrowd this place the service is always lacking in the cocktail/bar area of the rooftop.  It seems the servers are often overwhelmed with far too many tables that you will get ignored for a long ass time. \nSo a few tips: know what you want to order right away because you never know when you'll see your server again.  Ask to cash out immediately, again, if you all of the sudden need to bounce you won't be able to find that server and cash out right away.  Order the pitcher of margarita.  On a nice day, lets the real, you're not just going to have that one marg so opt for the pitcher and this avoids needing to ask for more drinks, and more waiting. \n\n***Also, had an off-putting experience here this past weekend.  The server cashed us out on our card but accidentally gave us another guests credit card in our book... this makes me a bit nervous because if this card had gotten into a different persons hands they could have taken it and run but we returned it.

Its rooftop setting gives life in a way that you almost feel as if you're on vacation at an outdoor eatery in Mexico. Day or night, rain or shine, I have been here, and dining with a view of the city never gets old. On cold rainy days, they turn up the heaters and lower the tarps, so you can still get the outdoor rooftop feel while staying warm and dry. On a clear warm day it's just that much more beautiful.   \n\nThough the cocktails are not my main reason for coming here, they never fail to satisfy me, and why not enjoy refreshing libations outdoors? I have tried various cocktails on the menu, but my favorites are El Chilcano, El Escorpion, and La Paloma, all of which are mezcal-based. The cocktails are well concocted and strong (as tequila can be) but still blended smoothly. The liquor tastes high-end enough that the subtle flavors and aromas still stand out.\n\nA pound of the chicharrones de carne is all you really need to order here. I have ordered the sampler of skewers, empanadas, quesadillas, chips and guac, and ceviche de cameron many times, but the chicharrones de carne trumps all. If you come on a good day, that is, if they don't sell out of the chicharrones de carne and they've got all the thick meaty cuts to deliver, one will not be disappointed. The 1 lb. of chicharrones cut is huge and is seasoned with hints of sugar. The outside of the chicharrones is perfectly crisped, but contrasted with the inside being tender and juicy beyond comprehension. It really is perfect!\n\nEl Techo is just short of 5 stars due to the poor service and lack of accommodation delivered by the bottom first floor hosts and hostesses. As I have been to El Techo many times, the service upstairs (by both the waiters and hosts) is always great and they are friendly. However, the hosts downstairs, who greet you as you request a table never fail to be confusingly unhelpful, unfriendly, and on a couple of accounts condescending. For a restaurant that draws  long lines, the line management can be confusing, BUT, one would expect the line hosts to be more welcoming, personable and helpful.

This place is great spot for a sunny day or a cool evening, they just roll down the sheltering sides and turn on the heaters. The entire space is outside! \n\nSeems like if you are going for just drinks, you may be faced with a longer wait than if you want food. The line was super long, but since we wanted to eat, we only waited 20 minutes or so, it was great! I would recommend ordering a bunch of stuff to shared, kinda tapas style and of course a pitcher of margarita!!\n\nEven if you do have to wait, do it.

Food-wise it's a 2 max. drink-wise it's a 4 (beside the terrible Sangria).\n\nFirst, I must say that this place is OVER noisy. You can barely hear nor talk to someone seating at your table (and I am not exaggerating here. my throat was hurting after leaving the place from talking too loud).\nIt's a very trendy place where people are definitely here to be seen.\n\nOur (very nice) waiter took really good care of us. We ordered the deep fried pork, 2 quesadillas, jalapeno cornbread, sausage (I can't recall the last dish my friend ordered so I won't mention about it).\n\nFood pros:\n- Sausage: good. 3 stars. 1 Simply grilled sausage, on a stick. great taste.\n- Jalapeno Cornbread: (small starter or side) 4 stars. Very surprising. Sophisticated but simple. Jalapeno inside but also comes with an amazing chili jam!\n\nFood Cons:\n- deep fried pork...I didn't really get it. first it's coated with sugar. OK. But it's dry. And when you try to find the 'moisture\" in it you just taste oil. but like cheap oil that has been used several times, or just cheap oil, I don't know.\n- Quesadillas...ouch. Very cheap tasting thick corn tortilla. too dry, too thick. I took the mushroom one. There were not much mushrooms and under cooked veggies in it.\n\nCocktails: not bad, especially a HUGE plus for the Pisco punch (5 stars). A BIG minus for the sangria (1 star. bland? tasteless? guys...put real fresh fruits, wine and add a bit of brandy pls). The Bloody Maria is fun (4 stars for that one).\n\nTotal for 4: 130$ + tip = 160$.\nThe view is really great.\nit's a 2.5 stars food wise. +0.5 for our waiter and the cocktails.", "author": "Sylvain B."}

When in doubt, go up to the host/hostess and ask.  If you get called upstairs, but the rest of your party is not there yet, they will have to go to the back of the line.  Alternatively you can let others behind you keep going upstairs while you wait for your party to get there.  It's on a capacity basis so up to you.\n\n2) If you want a table for \"dinner\" you go up to the host stand and put your name and cell phone down. If you go upstairs for cocktails, and your party isn't there yet...you just have to let the host/hostess know when everyone is there (upstairs or downstairs) and then they will prepare your dinner table.  At that point, if part of your party is downstairs, they will yell their name and pull them out of line to come upstairs.  Phew.  confusing.\n\nYou can stand in the drink line AND put your name down for dinner.\n\nIn any case, the \"dinner\" menu is the same menu they serve if you're having cocktails, it's just that it's on a lower seated table instead of the unreserved high tops.  Most of the reserved tables can hold up to 6, but if you get lucky and get the bench tables you can get up to 10.\n\nOk, drinks - big menu...sangria, tropical fruity drinks, margaritas etc.\n\nSnack foods - guac, plantain chips, sliders etc\n\nDinner foods - carnitas, up to 1.5 pounds.  Yum.  A little bit fatty but still enjoyable.\n\nOh and of course, why everyone comes here - IT'S A ROOFTOP BAR IN THE MISSION.

EL TECHO IS GUAC-AMAZING.\n\n Make sure to make a reservation, or else, you will wait in a long line of people, and you're better than that. I made a reservation for my boyfriend and I and this dining experience was an absolute pleasure! Firstly, this place has a beautiful view of the city on a clear day. This view was aided by superbly crafted cocktails, probably my favorite in the city due to their Authentic flare and fresh tastiness. I ordered the Chilcano, which I called, 'orange juice on crack', it was TERRIFIC! My boyfriend and I both loved our dishes. I couldn't help but notice the entire menu thoughtfully incorporated Latin flare into regular breakfast staples. The eggs Benedict on jalape\u00f1o cornbread was so satisfying.\n\n The cherry on top of this meal, was that when I made the reservation on the phone, I noted that it would be my boyfriends birthday. Without ever saying anything at the restaurant about it being his birthday, we received an appetizing dessert and a Happy Birthday from the waitress.

This place already had a line forming outside when I came here at around 6:30pm on a Friday night. I absolutely enjoyed my experience here! The place is located on a very beautiful rooftop overlooking the beautiful San Francisco, although you can't really see it until you stand up (or maybe i'm just short). The food here was delicious and very creative! I tried the Quesadilla de Aceiga, Quesadilla de Pibil, Skewers, Chicharrones de Carne, & Chocolate Mousse. Every dish was very unique and had its own twist. \n\nQusadilla de Aceiga- consisted of kale, mushroom, & cheese with salsa verde provided on the side. I thought that the combination was very different, but it was really delicious! I would definitely order this again the next time I come here! \n\nQuesadilla de Pibil- consisted of braised pork & cheese, with salsa on the side. The pork in the quesadilla is so soft and tender, on top of that, the flavor were so bold. The braised pork is definitely the highlight for this dish; a great blast of flavor. \n\nSkewers- these skewers make the perfect snack when you're with a group. It's perfect to munch on in between meals. I found myself enjoying the shrimp skewers a lot, they were grilled to perfection! \n\nChicharrones de Carne- MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!!! OH MY GOSH THIS STOLE THE SHOW! The way the pork looked.. The way the pork tasted better than it looked... It was amazing.. I used the tortilla and added everything on my tortilla to make the ultimate taco LOL! \n\nChocolate Mousse- Very light and fluffy, MmMm! Order this if you still have more room for dessert! I was only able to eat one spoonful because I was stuffed.\n\nOverall I would definitely come here again with reservations of course!

Well actually this was thee nicest San Francisco weather I have ever experienced at night; it was perfect,it had to be somewhere between 75\u00b0 and 78\u00b0 F and without wind or rain. The weather made it ok but the little metal stool/chairs were freezing our butts lol\n\nAnyway, the food; it's all street food, yes a restaurant with just street food. Everything on the menu is exactly what it is, they don't let you make substitutes; you have the option to eat exactly what you order or get a few items off the menu to create your own meal at your table. \n\nFoods I've tried here:\nGuacamole and chips-good & fresh\nChicken skewer-delish\nPlantano maduro-loved them\nPollo frito-yum\n\nProblems/negatives:\n-We had things floating in our water in the first carafe they brought to the table\n\n-No substitutes, they have chicken, they have tortillas, but you can not order a chicken taco, it is what it is I guess\n\n-They put my food on the same plate as someone else at my table; they handed me the plate so I started eating my food. Meanwhile we were waiting for the other plate for the other girl, we found out what happened at the end when the bill came. They then claimed it was family style so her food was on my plate too, but the waiter didn't tell us and nowhere on the menu does it say family style. Usually when a restaurant serves family style it is stated. Also, my group was of 6 people, and none of the other plates that were brought to our table were put together and called family style, so this didn't make any sense to us. And since when do you eat street food in family style anyway, I've mostly seen family style in basque or Italian restaurants, not for street food. Basically they wanted to charge me for eating the full plate they gave me, and none of us saw that as being right. So the manager came to the table, he seemed to try to justify why I should pay but then in the end he took it off my bill. So even though he took it off there was still the slight smart ass attitude at first.\n\n -Tip: You won't get full off the small plates so just know to order more than one if you're really hungry.", "author": "Lina L."}

We started up with some drinks - I got the la paloma which is grapefruit juice and tequila. I do love grapefruit juice and tequila so it's the perfect drink for me. \n\nStef and I split the chicharrones which was definitely not what I had expected, but really good and something we super enjoyed. It's a great dish to share - it even comes with tortillas! We also shared the benedicts and I enjoyed it! I liked the jalapeno cornbread even though Stef didn't.  \n\nOverall, we got a great view of the city, pretty good food and drinks, just a little mishap with the elevator. \n\nProtip: brunch cocktails and chicharrones.", "author": "Nina Y."}

When you come up the elevator, if you get past the waiting line, it can get fairly backed up as it is a hip place to visit right now. The first thing you see is the  View of downtown, just breathtaking! \nSeating is very intimate, they have space heaters, very effective, you only notice when you leave and it's freezing outside. \nThe menu is a bit pricy, but understandable being a SF based business and a fairly hipster spin on Latin cuisine. If you go with a large party be ready to spend. The portions of shared could be considered more of tapas or appetizers to share. With our group of 5 it was a bit scarce. \nThe chiccharron was my favorite dish out of everything we tasted, well developed flavors, great balance. The tortillas that they make here have a spice to them, pretty tasty. Ordering the skewers is a good idea to taste the different proteins on the menu. Guacamole is spot on. Margaritas are quite tasty! We even went for a second round...\nOverall enjoyed the ambiance and the vibe throughout the establishment. \nGreat place for a date night/day the view alone will get some brownie points.", "author": "Sabrina V."}

I loved that perfect bite with a bit of escabeche (black bean paste), some salsa, a piece of the crunchy pork rind, and a nice juicy piece of meat. That was heaven in my mouth.

Apparently the salsa was super sweet and this wasn't very good either.\n- I tried some of my friend's 0.5 pound chicharrones (15) and the meat was so dry we didn't even eat half of it. And it came with a bunch of whole jalapenos that were way too spicy to eat.\n- Sangria pitcher (25) -- this was pretty good.\n\nThere was an accident in the kitchen that day and our food took super long to get to us. And lastly, on the bill, they're a little sneaky... they only offered 18%, 20%, or 22% suggested tip amounts, and they were calculated AFTER tax. Tip is supposed to be calculated before tax, so that you are tipping on your actual food and not tax (i.e. tipping on the SF mandate that goes straight to the workers?). So if you use their receipt's calculations, you are tipping more than you think (15% post-tax = 17% pre-tax).\n\nThe upside was that despite it being a really cold day, the heat lamps kept us sufficiently warm during the whole meal.

I have never been to a rooftop bar but this one has a nice view of the city :) We ordered guacamole and chips, platanos, the quesadilla, and mango platter all of which were devoured in seconds. They were light and refreshing, high qual small plates that went great with our sangria pitcher. My favorite drink was the Hummingbird Cocktail which had Pisco in it (south American brandy, this one was Peruvian). I drank lots of Pisco mixed drinks  when I visited Chile and this took me back for a few seconds! We will be back. Also a shoutout to Danny who wasn't our server but still provided us great service in giving recommendations, taking photos, and he was fun", "author": "Bijal P."}

The view here is no secret. It's pretty amazing, especially if you get a table on the periphery of the restaurant. Speaking of, it's tiny, making the booze-to-person ratio super high. We ended up foregoing the shots in hopes of not being too hammered to enjoy some time in the park, but we did get two pitchers of the La Paloma between three of us. Sufficient and we were still responsible enough to find our way to the park.\n\nWith bellies half full of tequila we dove into the following: guacamole (you really can't f--- that up), ceviche = YAS; it was heavy on the lime which I lurrrrvvvv, the techo rancheros, and (my fav) the matambre, which we got mainly because it had chimichurri. I will eat anything with chimichurri on it. ANYTHING. But this had a perfectly medium rare flat iron covered with chimichurri and fried eggs. I have my cholesterol in check so I didn't care about all the animal fats in there. Oh, there are also baby potatoes there that roll around in and soak up said animal fats--it made my newly atherosclerosed heart sing!", "author": "Christina D."}

The views of the city are amazing and on this day, the weather was perfect for watermelon mimosas and a Mexican style brunch. \n\nCraving some meat, I got the Chicharrones de Carne (1/2 a pound) that's basically fried pork shoulder, a nice serving of chicharrones with salsa, beans, and tortillas. The pork shoulder was delicious. Perfectly seasoned and extremely filling. I would definitely share this next time.

The servers are constantly running around and it's literally impossible to flag anyone down. Now onto the food. We ordered the Fish Tacos ($14), Chicharrones de Carne ($19/half pound), and Pina Colada (~$10). The Pina Colada was underwhelming and filled with ice but it wasn't blended. It's basically a liquid drink with ice, but the Pina Coladas I'm used to having are blended. The tacos were good, but it only came with 2....making each taco $7. A $7 taco must be the best taco I've ever had....but it wasn't. The best thing we ordered was the Chicharrones de Carne by far.

ALL of them. Not sure if it was temporary, but when we asked the waiter what happened to all the chicken + the other vegetarian dishes he said \"Yeah...we removed them. We no longer offer chicken dishes.\" We tried some of their new items, but we weren't pleased. Most likely because of our dissapointment.\n\nAs person who doesn't eat pork nor beef, we were so disappointed that we aren't planning on returning here again for a while...Customer service, ambience (especially on a hot summer day) and everything else are great.

She smirked and said once seated \"she could absolutely not move us\". The upsetting part about this was that the seated area (which we had just been called up to be seated) was less than 50% full. *shrugs*..... We took what we were given. We were squished into a end table that had a large party already seated. The next table over was a two person table yet we were not seated there. \n\nWe ordered drinks.... Then some food.

Luckily, while there are bar tops for two out in the sun, they do have plenty of tables with umbrellas which provide shade.  \n\nFirst of all, if you have a brunch reservation right at opening, you have to form a line on the sidewalk before they let you up.  Then you can either take the elevator which might take awhile to come, or you can walk up several flights of stairs to the rooftop.  Take your pick :p  Once there, you check in at the host stand and then are seated.  The tables with chairs that are not quite suited for hanging purses on have hooks under the table that you can use.  FYI tables are pushed together quite closely; luckily no one was seated next to us until much later.  \n\nAs for the food, I had the chorizo scramble and split an order of beignets for dessert.  I did not like the food at all!  Just did not taste good to me.  I did, though, like my pina colada.  So if anything, come here for drinks and the view, and I'm guessing their small bites which seem to be popular.  Eat a meal before or after coming here!  My sister liked her eggs benedict though, so maybe I just didn't order the right thing.  \n\nThree stars for my pina colada and the view, plus their service which wasn't bad.", "author": "Carnita M."}

(Not sure about wine, haven't ever ordered it here.) The food is very well priced for an SF restaurant, particularly since the quality and taste is so good. Keep in mind - these are mostly small plates so it's best if you go with  friends and order several dishes.\n\nThere is usually a long wait but if you get there before 6 PM on a weekday (or make a reservation on the weekends - you can only make a reservation for Saturday and Sunday brunch) you'll be fine. As with most restaurants in SF, they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived.\n\n\nAdvice:\n\n1) The host/hostess will ask you if you're there for drinks and appetizers or just for dinner. Tell them you'll take whatever is fastest. The servers don't care as the drinks are more expensive than the food (just don't be a dick - if you're in the dinner section at least order a small plate, like the guacamole and chips. You'll be happy you did :) The cocktail/apps section is self seating, so good luck with that if they're busy.\n\n2) If you've invited several friends, just saw you're alone and go to the cocktail/apps section, as you'll get a seat faster and can save seats for your friends once you're there (you can still have a full menu in this section if you want dinner). \n\n3) If you really want to come here and there is a long wait that you can't avoid, just put your name on the list and they'll text you when your table is ready. You can grab drinks next door at Foreign Cinema or at the bar across the street that provides free comedy acts (not sure of the name, sorry) while you wait.", "author": "Ashley M."}

We waited in line, before we realized the line was for the bar (I think?) as when went up to talk to the host he told us we could go up immediately to the restaurant. We ordered salsa and chips, Chicharrones de Carnes (1 lb), a quesadilla, 3 skewers (chicken, beef, shrimp), and a margarita pitcher. It was really loud, crowded and cold, which is a given to some extent since it's a rooftop. Everything was kind of underwhelming and overpriced. $5 for a tiny amount of salsa and chips? We asked for a refill of chips and never got it. The quesadilla was ok, but it was literally a 1 person sized quesadilla. For $13 dollars, that's ridiculous - not worth it, and I can make it for way cheaper. The skewers were okay as well. The only thing that might be worth eating is the Chicharrones de Carnes. Great flavour, but for $32 for 1 lb they don't give you enough. The service was not very attentive, but they look understaffed. Overall it was just okay.", "author": "Rebecca H."}

It was really crowded and really loud, but you have to remember this is a rooftop \"bar\". Lots of people hanging out with their friends and family came out yesterday. \n\nWe came at the perfect time. There was no wait, and we were seated immediately! We came 10 minutes before 4 pm, which is when they start serving food.  Having not eaten anything all day, we ordered a ton of food for just the two of us: \n\nFood: \nCeviche \nChicken Thighs \nEmpanadas\nElote \n\nAll of the food was really delicious! I had to check with my cousin to make sure I wasn't dreaming. I haven't been back home too long so my taste buds have been a bit off. I wasn't sure if I was just excited to have Mexican food, or if it was truly bomb? It was definitely bomb. \n\nThe elote was a little bit more spicy than I've tasted, but it was still yummy.\nAs far as the empanadas, they were good, but I still think my aunt's homemade Pilipino empandas with cream cheese inside beats El Techo's.  I am biased... \n\nDessert: \nMexican Cookies & Hot Chocolate \nLeche Flan \n\nThe cookies were super sweet, but oh so good! It was smothered with dulce de leche in the middle. The leche flan was also yummy, but I think my other aunt's flan is the best I've had ever. I prefer Pilipino leche flan over Mexican flan. Pilipino leche flan is much sweeter, which is probably why it's super good! \n\nThe food is good, the ambiance is fun (if it's warm out or if you're under a heater on a cold day), and the views are amazing. Make sure to bring a sweater or something to layer! It gets cold in the city.  \n\nWe knocked off one star because the service is SLOW! It was so slow!! I had to say that twice. We ordered a sangria, and the server forgot about it. He came back, and told us it was on him because he forgot and because it was so freakin slow! \n\nDespite the slow service, I would come back here. It's a fun place to hang out with your peeps!

Ever since I've moved to SF, I've heard from so many people to grab drinks at El Techo's rooftop bar for views of the city. I was also warned about the insanely long lines to get in, but I had a friend from out of town visiting and thought it would be great to check it out with her.\n\nWe got there at around 6:30 on a Thursday night and the happy hour crowd was already well on their way and beat us to the line. We waited about 35 minutes which I GUESS wasn't too bad. We took an elevator upstairs and were greeted with a lackluster view of the city. Not necessarily El Techo's fault, of course, but I wasn't very impressed considering how everyone said that it was a rooftop must. It was crowded with a pretty diverse crowd, which is always good, and the space was filled with high and low tables (high if you're grabbing drinks and apps; low if you're sitting down to eat) and heat lamps everywhere (thank goodness!). We got a table fairly quickly under the tent, right by one of those very necessary heat lamps. \n\nIt took a waiter about 15 minutes to get to us (womp womp) and maybe another 10 minutes just to get water. I get that the place was crowded but we watched as tables surrounding us got service even though they arrived after us. Sigh. The three of us ordered a pitcher of red sangria, guacamole, esquite (yellow corn, spicy crema, cilantro) and the Quesadilla de Pibil (braised pork shoulder, oaxaca cheese and salsa). This was plenty of food and drinks for our group. The sangria was okay (the best sangria I've had in SF so far is down the street at Cha Cha Cha's) and I liked the esquite for sure. But the rest of the food matched the view in its inspiration. The quesadilla was dry but I guess we were so hungry that we devoured it any way. \n\nI've had better food but I'm glad I at least gave El Techo a try.

They have a great big location plus a roof-top that is suppose to be awesome.  Unfortunately, you have to get there pretty early to make it into the roof-top area.  By the time we got there, it was a 30-45 minute wait to get into the roof-top area.  \n\nOur waiter was a little snobby and short with us, which was a bummer.  The place is so nice that you want to have a great experience to enjoy the whole establishment.  \n\nNevertheless, I gave it a 4-star, because I do believe it is a really nice place and would recommend it.

The odd thing is that the bar shares the building with an apartment.\n\nRight next to Foreign Cinema (also a great place to go to, see my review LOL), you'll see a tiny line on the sidewalk waiting to go to the rooftop bar of Techo de Lolinda. By 6pm, the line is damn near at the end of the block. Walk in the apartment building and take a hot, small elevator to \"PH\". You are greeted by a hostess and a loud atmosphere. \n\nHostess will ask if you are having dinner or cocktails and small plates. If you choose dinner, you're seated at a table, if you choose cocktails then you're at the high tables. We chose dinner and got a lovely table by the bar. We ordered 2 pitchers of sangria ($18) before happy hour ended (6pm). Later, we ordered the mushroom and kale quesadilla and the half pound chicharones. Both very delicious dishes. The meat was unbelievably tender and the quesadilla was perfectly cheesy. \n\nOverall, the rooftop has plenty of seating but gets packed as soon as 5pm hits. The view is beautiful when the weather is right. The service is very prompt and proper. The food is good. So why only 4 stars? Because in my opinion, the place is way too hyped for what it actually is. Take away the view and the fact that it's a rooftop bar, this place would be pretty mediocre. I wouldn't wait in line just for the food, that's for sure. Also, I'm pretty sure there are plenty of other places with equally as good, if not better, happy hour.", "author": "Jenna T."}

There seems to always be a line to get up when you get there but they are fairly organized. The line goes by fast, we were upstairs in less than 15 minutes. Although they were busy, we didn't have trouble finding a table to seat all of us. El Techo is a rooftop bar that offers food and drinks. Its open seating and the server comes to take your order. I wish i had gotten the name of our server because she was very attentive. She even played along and recorded a mannequin challenge for my gfs and i. \n\nWe ordered 2 pitchers of margarita (one of each kind). The margarita del techo hit stronger than the regular margarita. The price is a little bit higher than what I'm used to paying for for a pitcher but i guess with the view it comes with, it wasn't so bad. also love how there are heat lamps all over.

But since I just had weekend brunch with some friends, I'll write about the latest visit. We did some family style items and ended up sharing a bunch of our individual brunch items. \n\nMust try:\n- Chicarrones de carne: who doesn't love chunks of succulent + flavorful pork shoulder? Top it with the lime and salsa and it's a party in your mouth. Some pieces were definitely more fatty than others, but that can be easily removed if you're watching your fat intake. \n- Quesadilla de pibil: braised pork shoulder quesadilla with oaxaca cheese. I'd order this again in a heartbeat. The tortilla is super thick, soft yet crunchy on the exterior, super cheesy and the pork shoulder is to die for.\n- Techo rancheros: I wish i actually ordered this instead of the matambre. The pork used in this dish might be the same as the quesadilla de pibil. But whatever it is, El Techo does pork right. \n \n\nMeh/Standard:\n- Guacamole: the guac itself is pretty standard in flavor. The chips are extra crunchy and salty. It's a good starter for the table.\n- La Paloma: most of our table had their fair share in this grapefruit cocktail. I really can't justify spending $34 on a pitcher. Everyone seemed to like it though\n\nPass:\n- Matambre: grilled skirt steak, eggs, potatoes, chimichurri, and sliced brioche. All of which were mediocre at best. I was really looking forward to some flavorful medium rare (chef's recommendation) skirt steak. Instead, I got a half medium rare/half well done piece of meat. The beef was barely seasoned. It tasted like someone just threw a piece of steak on a grill for a few minutes. The charred taste was almost off putting. I had to drown it in some left over salsa off other dishes. Potatoes were drowning in grease and were poorly seasoned. I'll have to take a hard pass on this in the future.\n\nGiven that we had a party of 8+, the customer service was really great. They let us split the bill with however many cards we wanted. Our waitress was super patient with us and our needs and accomodating to our complaints about it being too hot. They rolled up one plastic covering for us to give us some fresh air.\n\nTLDR: during brunch hours, get the chicarrones + guac for the table to share. Order the techos racheros for yourself.\n\nPro tip:\nIf you're just trying to turn up for brunch, you better pregame on walk over from Dolores. Otherwise, get ready drop some serious cash on dranks.", "author": "Jessica L."}

My wife and I are tequila drinkers and were told this was a tequila bar. When I ordered Anejo, they delivered silver.  It can be an honest mistake and we very politely brought it to Chadd's attention.  Chadd literally laughed in our face, rolled his eyes several times and mocked us to other staff. In all my years I've never more disrespected. Eventually he proceeded to bring us the bottle that he says the tequila was poured from. He held the bottle next to my glass and held them side-by-side. It was extremely obvious that the glass they had poured me was clear in color and the bottle was dark as an anejo should be. Chadd had a poor attitude and made fun of us as he proceeded around the rooftop. We asked for a manager to alert them to the problem in a very polite way.

As soon as I recover from last nights hangover, I am totally ready for happy hour.", "author": "Karen G."}

The hostess wanted to sit us at a TINY table for two, about 2'x2', when there were at least ten 4-tops open. I'm 6'6 and it was about forty minutes to closing, no way that those tables were all needed for larger parties. My friend asked if we could have a bigger table and she actually told us no, that they're reserved for larger groups. We sat down at the tiny one, and I looked like a bodybuilder in a kindergartener's schooldesk. Finally, we asked another hostess for a larger table, and she was immediately accommodating. \n\nHonestly, it took me about 10 minutes to shake off my irritation at this. I grew up in my family's restaurant, and that's just piss-poor customer service and PR, that. When it's slow and you can accommodate a reasonable request, you just do. Especially one as simple as seating someone two feet south of where you had intended. But I digress.\n\nThe setting was beautiful, the view spectacular. The food was tasty, I don't know that I was completely blown away. The prices were a bit high, but you're paying for the aforementioned setting and view, I get that.\n\nAll-in-all, things ended on a good note. I'm not sure that this place would become a regular haunt... but I'd bring out-of-town guests here for the view alone.", "author": "Sean B."}

We got there around 6pm on Wednesday and there was plenty of seating and a great view of downtown SF.  Being a work event, we went crazy and ordered a lot of items and stuffed ourselves silly!  Some were great, some were good, and some were meh.\n\nWe started with the guacamole, plantain chips, and chicharrones.  The guacamole was fresh, nicely seasoned, and creamy and went perfectly with the side of tortilla chips  The plantains were very bland, but the avocado-tomatillo salsa's spicy and lime flavor were great.  And I don't dine on swine, but my co-workers said the chicharrones were delicious.\n\nNext, we ordered a round of empanadas, shrimp ceviche, and elotes.  While the empandas were hot and fresh, the braised beef was flavorless. The toppings on the elotes were good, but the corn wasn't sweet and was just kind of there.  But the star of the evening was the shrimp ceviche; big pieces of shrimp and just an overall big flavor from the lime and onion.\n\nWe were starting to get full, but had to try the chuzo skewers.  We ordered a variety, and they were delicious.  The standouts were the pollo (marinated chicken, red onion, aji amarillo) and the camarones (white shrimp, aii amarillo glaze, salsa criolla).\n\nLastly, we each ordered a dessert.  Everybody else ordered a grandizados snow cone, but I went for the Alfajores with hot chocolate.  The alfajores were delicate and slightly sweet, they were really good.\n\nThe stars of the evening were the shrimp ceviche, the chicken skewer, and the shrimp skewers.  Without those 3 items, this probably would have been a 2 or 3 star review.", "author": "Nadeem A."}

A couple blocks away from the 24th Street BART Station. To get to the rooftop, you need to go through a hallway and take the elevator up to the roof. When we arrived, the place was crazy packed, crowded, and loud. The place isn't too big, but has plenty of tables. My friend had booked reservations for our party of 7 about two weeks in advance for a birthday brunch. The day we went, it was pretty windy in SF, but so glad there were heat lamps to keep us warm! We started off with a pitcher of margaritas. And since we were a big group, we decided to ordered two of each small plates just to try a little bit of everything. \n\nFood- \nCHIPS AND GUACAMOLE - Guacamole was delicious and tasted very fresh!\n\nCEVICHE - Very generous amount of shrimp! Comes with a side of chips. \n\nEMPANADAS - One of my favorite small plates. The empanada had ground beef, potatoes, egg, raisins, and chimichurri. Super delicious!  \n\nQUESADILLA DE PIBIL - Includes braised pork shoulder. Super cheesy! Unfortunately, this dish was not too memorable in my opinion. \n\nBENEDICTOS - Two poached eggs on jalapeno cornbread with chorizo. Perfect combination. Loved the runny yolk on the cornbread.  \n\nONE & A HALF POUND CHICHARRONES DE CARNE - Huge fried chunks of pork-shoulder!! SO DELICIOUS. Crispy on the outside. Tender and juicy with each bite. Tortillas, salsa, and black bean paste (aka escabech) came along with the chicharrones. Tortillas were thick and soft.

I had to keep getting up to give names every 15 minutes! I couldn't sit and enjoy my party! \n\nThen the manager asked me if we were ordering dinner...\nUmmmm we spent over $300.00 combined and he expected us to order what????? I was so upset! At the end ... he wouldn't let my last guest up...although we had been there since 4 and spent plenty of money!\n\nI should had planned this better but I was told the day before they could accommodate me and my large party of 18.

After reading several reviews I was prepared to wait a good 30 minutes for a table but I was pleasantly surprised when my BF and I only waited 3 minutes for an elevator to head upstairs! Already a good sign.\n\nWe ordered the pitcher of red sangria; that's the ONLY negative I encountered. It was a smooth sangria but in no means the best I've ever had. \n\nCeviche as our appetizer. Taste was good. I expected a little more (quantity) for the price but it was decent. Served with chips, nothing to write home about. \n\nNow, the half pound of chicharrones is a whoooole other story!! From the freshly made tortillas, which I wish I knew how they're made because they're not grandma's regular tortillas. There's something else to it. The chicharrones were pure heaven! The flavor, the tenderness, the quantity, all spectacular. I'm almost glad this restaurant is located in SF and I'm in Fairfield because if not, I'd be going there weekly! Haha. We highly enjoyed this plate. See my pic! \n\nThen, the greatness continued...our waiter (which I'm sorry I forgot his name) recommended us a mixed rum drink with Modelo beer topping it off. But he described it so fantastically that he convinced us to try it. All I remember is him saying its a version of \"a naughty 45 year old woman with a high slit dress...\"  Omg he was too funny. \n\nOverall, this place is pretty great. The high top table we sat at was a little on the smaller side but the guys walking around pick up unused plates very efficiently so I wasn't overwhelmed really. And I won't discount another start for this but there were only two bathroom stalls! A little disappointing for such a popular place.

Everything was going well and he seemed okay until my bf asked for a new glass. Jeremy then said, \"Why, what's wrong with it\" which really surprised me because the way he asked was almost defiant and very rude. Besides, I don't understand why he wouldn't just give my bf a new water glass. My bf said \"It's dirty\" to which our server replied, \"Where?\" At this point I felt super uncomfortable and upset. Why was this guy trying to argue with my bf about something as simple as a dirty water glass? Jeremy then explained that it's not actually dirty there are just lots of scratches from the way the glasses are stacked and demonstrated by getting glasses and stacking like we were stupid...He then took one of the glasses he was demonstrating with and said \"Here you can just have this. There's no scratches\" and walked away. After that whole thing my bf and I were just staring at each other like wtf just happened...\n\nThe rest of the time he didn't check up on us once but checked up on the table right next to us 2-3 times (tables are super close to so he definitely could have asked if we were doing okay!!) He only asked if we wanted anymore food when we were clearly done and wanted the check and when he gave us the check he didn't say thank you or anything.

We also ordered the elote was great. The views fantastic. We came around 7:30 and after waiting in line on the steets we ended up at the penthouse around 8 when the sun was setting and the clouds very pink. It was just beautiful!\n\nI'm not giving el techo 5 stars because it's REALLY loud! Like super loud. Not the romantic rooftop place I thought it was be. :( sad panda.\n\nThe wait for the bar area is on the street. However, you can order food at the bar. Even though the host will ask you if we are there for drinks or dinner, making it seem that food can only be ordered when sitting at the shorter table but that's not true. \n\nIf you want dinner at the shorter tables then you go up to the street level host and tell him/her to put your name down for dinner and then wait for them to text you. If you wait in line that's for the \"drinks\" part which again you can order food too but it may be trickier to find a good table to fit your party.\n\nI still think it's a great place to enjoy a great dinner and drinks. Pi\u00f1a colada is very sweet. It's good. Not strong at all. My favorite kind of alcoholic drink :)", "author": "Angela K."}

Not all the good restaurants in SF are open for lunch so I was pleased El Techo was. I had been to the old Medjool before it became El Techo & remember the views were quite nice. I was able to make an easy reservation via Yelp for the two of us. Finding El Techo was sort of weird from the street as it's been a few years since I had been. Once we found our way, we had to wait with a group to get up the elevator. It's painfully slow to get up. Once up top, we were seated promptly & lucky for us the weather was perfect. El Techo also has heaters for chilly days. The decor is colorful & atmosphere is vibrant, casual, & fun. Pretty much exactly what I was hoping for. Our server came over straightaway & took our drink orders while we decided on food (service started off fairly good at least). \n\nI went for the La Paloma which is a grapefruit margarita - refreshingly delicious! I could definitely sit on that roof for a few hours & sip those babies. Their menu consisted of so many tasty items that we couldn't resist ordering a few items. I started with the ceviche & hubs had Chicarrones de Carne. Both packed immense flavor. We both loved that the chicarrones weren't your typical cracklin style, but showcased the flavorful pork & tortillas. The tortillas are out of this world, by the way. Super fresh. For our mains, hubs had the Benedictos & I had the Quesadilla de Pabil. The Benedictos jalapeno cornbread & chorizo went beautifully with poached eggs. The quesadilla was quite filling & loaded with more tasty pork. I decided to end our meal with one last cocktail - the Margarita del Techo. It was kind of a letdown after the flavorful La Paloma. \n\nIn the end, we were both more than satisfied with the delicious flavors of the food & drinks. I felt service seemed to slip after a while & not sure how we got lost in the shuffle of tables, but somehow we did. That's really my only complaint. The views are lovely & can see myself coming back for a fun brunch or date night.", "author": "Elena F."}

I heard so much about it, but wow, it was such a disappointment. Luckily we didn't have to wait long (about 15 minutes) at 4pm on a Saturday, but I heard it can get really crowded. The view at the top is nice, but I'm convinced that the rooftop view is the only reason that people go there.      \n \nWe ordered the pitcher of sangria first, and it was watery. We then ordered a pitcher of margarita, and they were really strong, so that was definitely worth the money. However, it tasted like straight up tequila so my friends didn't even want to drink it, but hey, more for me!                 \n \nOkay let me get to the food and service. Sooooo disappointing. All of it. We ordered guacamole and chips, and the table next to us got all 5 dishes that they ordered before we even got our guacamole and chips. I had to remind the waitress about 2 different times and even asked two other waiters. I understand that they are busy, but how is it that the people next to us received their food first and arrived about 20 minutes after us???\n \nThe guacamole was dry on the top, so it was definitely sitting out. The ceviche tasted like shrimps that were frozen from Costco, thawed, and then mixed with some lime juice, onions, and cilantro. The elotes were the only thing that were pretty good here. The flautas were ok. We asked the waitress for the pork quesadilla with steak instead (since my friend doesn't eat pork) and she said sure. She then came back 10 minutes later to confirm our order. I repeated loud and clear STEAK quesadilla as I was already pretty fed up with the slow service. Of course she brings out a pork quesadilla....?!?!?!?! She then explained to me that she didn't understand what we were asking and that they can't make it with steak. I told her that I don't really care about the reasoning, she just needs to take the quesadilla back and take it off of our bill.\n \nJust a note: she was a nice waitress so I don't want to bad mouth her, I'm just explaining that the service here was terrible. Also, the food is forgettable. The view is nice and the drinks are strong so I would suggest that you just go to the other restaurants that are authentic and delicious down the street and come to this place for a drink if you want to try this place out (but expect to wait a while for the drinks).

El Techo is a great place to come with friends for some drinks and food to share. I love their margaritas (both the class and the del Techo). The other drinks I've tried are pretty sweet (Paloma and Chilcano), but their margaritas are perfect for me. The food and drinks are pretty pricey, I came once with another friend of mine and we each order a pitcher of one type of margarita (oops) and spent about $90 just on the drinks alone. \n\n-Margarita del Techo: really smokey and really strong. I'm a huge fan, but a pitcher of this is significantly more expensive than the classic margarita. \n- Guacamole: SO GOOD. I've had my fair share of guac, but El Techo's is just thick and creamy and delicious\n- Chicharrones de Carne: must try - I get it every single time. They usually don't give you enough tortillas, but you can ask for more for free!\n- Empanadas: yum but really oily. The chimichurri sauce it comes with is good too.\n- Pollo Fritos: fried chicken bites. Everyone I come with always really loves this, but it's not on my list of favorites for El Techo. The salsa it comes with is really great though. \n\nI especially love the atmosphere and the see through canopy and heaters to protect you from the SF cold.

We showed up around 8:15 on a Tuesday and we got a table right away.  They sat us in a pub style table and were happy to move us to a regular (lower to the ground) table when we asked.  \n\nThe menu is very not super descriptively written, so we had a hard time figuring out what we wanted.  The server didn't seem particularly interested in conversing with us too much, so we didn't ask many questions.  We were surprised that about 3 out of about 6 or 7 of the small plate options had raisins in them.  Neither of us find raisins particularly appealing in Latin food so we were kind of at a loss.  We ended up ordering the Flautas (which had raisins) but we did not taste a single raisin in them, if there were  any, they were so few and hidden that they really shouldn't be in the description.  My brother really like the green tomatillo sauce on the flautas, I found it to be too sweet.  The Pibil quesadilla was pretty good, I don't usually like quesadillas so the fact that I enjoyed this one says a lot, my brother loved it.  The guac is super good, but it is a really small portion, you get a small handful of (really good, homemade) chips and about 1/3 cup of guac.  It's not enough for two to really get a satisfying helping.  \n\nIn fact, that is the case with ALL of the dishes.  The flautas comes with two very small flautas, each one is about 3 bites.  The Quesadilla is two small wedges.  I don't know how on earth you would come here with a group; you would have to order 5 of everything.  It's just way too expensive for the portions.  I guess you are paying for the atmosphere too.  We got two regular margaritas, they were mostly ice and a little on the bitter side, $9 for about 3 swigs of margarita.  The flan was OK, the passion fruit jelly is a little overpowering and the flan can't stand up to it.  \n\nOur bill was like $60, before tip, for two tiny dishes, a tiny cup of guac, two drinks and one small dessert.  I'm not saying that this is unbelievably pricey, but in order to get enough to eat, we would have had to order double the food. I understand the small plates thing.  The problem is not the smallness of the plates, it's the price of said plates.  It should be noted that the reason we didn't order more was because nothing else really shouted out to me.  The ceviche sounded good but I'm not paying $14 for two spoons full of ceviche that is more than likely not going to be as good as what they make at most taquerias.  I was confused about what the chicharrons were going to be.  It's described as chunks of fried pork, so they are not traditional chicharrons, but were they just going to come as a plate of meat chunks?  Eat em like popcorn?  And it's $15 for half a pound.  I'm sorry, I'm not a butcher, is half a pound a lot of chicharrons?  Cuz $15?? Really?  \n\nI heard that they have an amazing artichoke dish, but it wasn't on the menu.  Maybe I'll check this place out again in the summer.  But be prepared to break the bank.  \n\nShout out to the super friendly host who not only offered to take our picture, but even guided us to what he thought was the best view to take a picture in front of.

We made a dinner reservation and were told that there were 4 parties ahead of us.  In NY that usually means a decent amount of waiting time in a small restaurant.  However, much to our surprise we were called to the front fifteen minutes later.  \n\nThe restaurant is on the rooftop and is packed with with a 20s/30s crowd.  The prices are cheap and the food is delicious!

It's all about the rooftop bar ambiance and young professionals.\n\nI came across this place via a Yelp search as I was looking for drink places in the Mission District.  This district seems to be a little seedy, but it can be argued that it adds that much character to the area. \n\nThe restaurant/bar is located upstairs in which only 1 elevator goes up and down.  There may have been a staircase, but we were instructed to take the elevators.  The outdoor seating and glass windows facing out to the city is spectacular.  \n\nWhy I deduct 1 star is the service and the hours of service.  There's no formal bar service area, so you can't just go up and order a few drinks.  You have to be serviced by a waitress/waiter.  I found that kind of annoying because you're basically competing with those who are there for a dinner.  Also the closing hours is too early! Last call was at 10pm, and they close at 11pm.  Yes, it was a weekday but most happening bars/restaurants I know of in a major city close at midnight at least.\n\nThe drinks are moderately priced just like any other bar but definitely not too expensive.", "author": "Todd N."}

This rooftop bar located in Mission offers a stunning view of San Francisco decked off with a classy atmosphere and delicate string lights.\n\nI came here with my friends for National Margarita Week. There are two seating areas (one for just drinks and one for food+ drinks). Tip: If you opt for just drinks you might find yourself standing, especially if the bar is already full. \n\nThe drinks tend to be more expensive than most the food here (it ranges about $11-$12 for a drink). Their Happy Hour is from 4pm - 6pm and offer great deals ($4 for a beer!). We ordered a pitcher of Margaritas (around $30) and between three people were able to have about 2 glasses each. The margaritas were strong and deliciously lime-y. We also ordered guacamole and chips ($5 during happy hour). I was satisfied with both the food and service here.\n\nTip: If you're planning on coming here later in the night, be prepared for a wait! The bar tends to start filling up closer to 5pm. \n\nOverall, I had a good time at El Techo. If anything, come here for the view and experience.", "author": "Naveena S."}

We went to El Techo based on recommendation after not being able to secure a reservation at Foreign Cinema. \n\nTwo of us got to El Techo around 8pm and put our name on the list. We were #15 on the list and they do not quote wait times here since it can vary. We figured it would take awhile being so far down the list so we went to Lolinda's bar to get a drink. When we got to the bar and ordered our drink, our table at El Techo was ready - only 10 minutes later! I was surprised and caught off guard since I didn't expect it to be so quick.\n\nWhen we got to the rooftop, I was instantly in love with the environment, vibe, and views. This place is definitely a great place to meet with friends over drinks and small bites. It can get pretty loud though, so you will probably find yourself talking loudly.\n\nOverall, I thought the Food and Drinks were just okay - a few items were good, but nothing was outstanding to me. We tried their Ceviche de Camaron, Empanada de Carne, Flautas, Chile Relleno, and Quesadilla de Pibil. The only item that stood out to me was the Chile Relleno - this was delicious and apparently the first night it had been on the menu. The pork in the quesadilla was delicious, however, the quesadilla as a whole was ok - could've used more cheese and flavor. Our server highly recommended the Chicharrones, but since we were going out afterwards, we were trying to keep it more simple with the small plates. \n\nFor drinks, we shared their sangria, which was good, but not great. Cha Cha Cha definitely wins in the sangria category in the city.\n\nOverall, super fun place to go with friends and I would come back for the views alone. Maybe next time I'll try Brunch or come just for drinks and a few items. But for dinner, I'd rather go somewhere else for a full and delicious meal.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

We also ordered a few skewers of the chorizo and camerones. All of which were great and flavorful. Of course we were sinful and eating with our eyes so we had an order of the half pound chicarones de carne. THIS. IS. DELICIOUS. We definitely had left overs and over ordered, but I have NO REGRETS!\n\nI will have to come here next time with a bigger party to maybe try more tapas, but it was definitely a nice date night spot.

So in terms of atmosphere and location it gets 5 stars.  I came here on my birthday and we definitely all enjoyed watching the sun set over the bay. \n\nThe drinks are also good and though a little on the sweet side, they offer a wide variety for just about anyone's pallet.  Their drinks are a bit strong which is always a good thing in my books! \n\nNow, why the three stars you may ask? THE FOOD is not up to par with any other aspects of the restaurant.  It is extremely overpriced and not tasty or authentic.  I keep reading all these great reviews about the carnitas but we paid 30 dollars for sugar coated pork.  Real carnitas, coming from a Mexican, lean on the saltier side with sweet undertones but that's not what I got here.  Their beans were also not cooked thoroughly and tasted a bit sweet as well.  \n\nAll in all,  come here for the drinks and atmosphere but don't expect the best meal of your life.", "author": "Michael B."}

Also got the shrimp ceviche which tasted better than it looked. But this also got tiring to eat after awhile. Definitely makes sense to come with group and share little bites. Not huge meals.

I asked if I could put it to the side so it wouldn't go to waste, he responded rudely and would not allow it. I asked again if he could just allow us to put the drinks aside and the host acted as though I had brought in a picnic basket full of food.

Came here on a Sunday for brunch with a group of 7 to celebrate a bday. It's not too far from 24th st bart station so you can def avoid driving in the busy SF streets. Our server seemed very busy but managed to give us terrific service! He checked up on us often and gave us great food/drink recommendations. \n\nFor food we ordered small plates to share. Two of whichever small plate should be perfect for a group of 5 or more. We ordered two ceviches, two quesadillas, two empanadas, one order of the Benedict and 1.5 lbs of the chicharrones. The ceviche was  delicious with a generous amount of shrimp and a zesty flavor. I do wish it had more of a spicy flavor. The empanadas were also very tasty with a chimicurri-like dipping sauce. The quesadillas were also very tasty, super cheeesy!!!! They braised short rib inside was delicious!! The Benedict was also really good. The poached eggs sat on top of a cornbread accompanied by a chorizo sausage. It was bomb!!! I would definitely order that again for myself haha. Lastly the chicharrones were the star of the show. They came with tortillas, a bean pur\u00e9e and salsa which made for the perfect little taco. Delicious!!\n\nWe also ordered a pitcher of margaritas super yummy! I ordered a pi\u00f1a colada on the side which was also great but I will say it kinda took a whole to come out. I would definitely recommend this place!

Server took our order and although my friends drink arrived a few minutes later, they forgot mine and another 15 mins goes by before it arrives\n\nFood arrives and we have no silverware, we try to get our waiters attention. 10 minutes go by, food is cold and we finally have silverware. We explained to our waiter that the food is now cold and he said no it isn't and walks away... \n\nHe comes back about 15 minutes later and asks if we want another drink. We say no, just the check please \n\nCheck arrives. I put my card in it and place the little folder on the table. Waiter comes over and stands the folder up again and walks away. I let him know we are ready to pay and he says he needs a card. My card was placed in the check folder, which when he put it back up again the card fell out. We find the card on the floor and he proceeds to process the payment.\n\nMeanwhile someone at another table behind us starts to have a seizure and the waiter just stands there and stares while others look for a spoon and ask for someone to call an ambulance. People ask him to call an ambulance including myself and he does nothing. Thankfully the person having a seizure was fine and he left with his friends. \n\nThis was the worse experience at a restaurant bar I have had in my life so far. \n\nIt seems like a place that's trying too hard to be cool as well.

The manager deserves 5 stars, but our experience really deserves just 1.\n\nI understand there may have been miscommunication coming into dinner, but it's not right to treat customers the way that we were treated. The birthday girl called in the night before to ask if she can reserve a table for 18. They told her sorry they don't take reservations, but we can get seated when the whole party arrives together. The next day, my other friend arrived early to put our name down, but the hostess told them that the biggest table they had for us was a table for 12. This part may have been our fault for agreeing to that table, but when the birthday girl came to clarify that we actually have 18, the hostess gave us the same option only. Our table of 18 were waiting at the bar for 2 hours just to get seated somewhere. When the table was ready we got brought to the table of 12. I asked them if we could also take the empty table across/next to us, so that it would accommodate the whole party, and she said no sorry your friend told us 12. I was so mad because the whole 2 hours they knew that we actually had 18 not 12 anymore, so why not accommodate us or just tell us sorry we can't seat your whole party anymore, so we don't have wait 2 hours for no table... They tried to give us a table of 12 and just leave the rest of our party at the bar with no other options. If the hostess is going to tell us that that's the biggest table they have, then why didn't they tell us that when we called the night before to make reservations. Spoke to the manager, and he helped us right away. So easy!! We got the table next to us just like that.  \n\nAlso, coming in I gave the birthday cake to the hostess and said \"Can I give this cake to you, it's for lauren,\"  and she said, \"What do you want me to do with this?\" In a way that sounded like why are you giving me this.... I really wanted to say, what do you mean?!?! Have you never given a cake to a restaurant yourself before or do you guys not get cakes from other parties?! I asked if she can put it in the fridge and she said unfortunately we don't have a fridge for your cake, but I guess we can put it in the back office. Yes... whatever... PLUS we got charged a $15 cake cutting fee. If they have a cake cutting fee then obviously the hostess should have KNOWN what to do when I handed her a cake. So ridiculous... \n\nWe definitely made a mistake in coming here with such a big party, but we were already there.. They don't have to be like that.

We went up an elevator to a rooftop area overlooking the city.  There was a bit of fog covering the landscape, and the weather was actually pretty cold.  The ceiling heaters didn't really reach where we were sitting, so it was quite chilly while we were waiting for our food and during our dinner.\n\nWe weren't able to find a waiter very quickly, but once we ordered...the food came out relatively fast.  We ordered:\n\n1. The guacamole ($7).  The guacamole had a hint of lime and had feta cheese sprinkled over it.  It was very thick and very good.  I would definitely order this if you come.\n\n2. Ceviche de Camaron ($13).  Shrimp, lime, tomatoes, avocado, onions, cilantro, and cucumber.  I really liked the avocado and the shrimp together.  One of the reasons why I gave this restaurant three stars is because I got a stomachache after this dinner, and I think I got it from the ceviche.\n\n3. Elote ($5).  The corn on the cob with sour cream, chili, and lime was really good.  It came with three small corns on a stick (a little too small), but it was still delicious.\n\n4. Pollo Skewer ($7). The chicken skewer came with chicken and red onions.  I'm not sure if the skewers are worth $7 each.  There wasn't too much meat on the stick, and it was alright.\n\n5. Chorizo Skewer ($7).  I liked the chorizo more than the chicken skewer.  I liked how when you bit into the chorizo, there was a little 'snap' due to the crisp (like any good sausage).\n\n6. Alfajores ($6). House-made cookies and hot chocolate.  The hot chocolate was very thick and very chocolate-y.  The cookies looked like macarons.  Short-bread and caramel filling.  I didn't like the cookies too much, but I did like the hot chocolate.\n\nEl Techo de Lolinda is a cool rooftop area/bar/tapa place to go with your friends and hang out.  It was chilly and foggy that day, so I don't think I got the full effect...but it was still cool to come out to.

You now have el techo (no, not el techno...this isn't a rave brunch) has blossomed into a swanky tapas bar with a beautiful roof deck with panoramic views to boot. Prior to this past Sunday, I had only gone to the roof deck for drinks.... Hence the late(ish) review. Fun fact: techo = roof. Duh, right?\n\nWhile reservations are highly suggested, especially on beautiful sunny mission days, we were taken to the roof to see a halfway empty (or halfway full, whatever) roof space filled with tables. The sun was beaming, but we opted for a spot in the sun to get that vitamin D.\n\nDrinks: we ordered coffee and mimosas. Coffee was good, I'll give them that. For some odd reason, I was thinking they would serve some great high quality Cuban coffee but what I got was a little light and Folgers...ish. Not the best, but it did what it needed after 3 cups. The mimosas were a whopping $8 each and served in a fancy flute. When asked about carafe options, we were told it would come out in bottle form. Let's do the math, flute = 6 oz. @ $8. Bottle of champagne = 25 ounces. 25/6 = 4.16 x 8 = $33 for a carafe.. no thanks.\n\nFood: We started with the chips and quac which, coming from a non-guacamole lover, was fantastic. It was chunky, flavorful and the chips were perfect. As far as entrees go, while we may have been at fault for having a hearty eggy breakfast the morning of, we showed up to brunch not necessarily wanting brunch food. Go figure. I went with the Quesadilla de Pibil which was a quesadilla (duh) with braised pork shoulder, oaxaca cheese and salsas. While it's no El Farolito super suiza, it was a nice size and decently priced. I distinctly remember it being cheesy, just wish it had more meat. The salsa was the real MVP doe. We also shared the Tostada Francesa which was baguette French toast, berry compote and cream. This was our over indulgence, our cheat meal of sorts and it kind of fell flat. IMO, too doughy and not sugary enough (and you'll never hear me say that). Maybe we had high hopes, but we expected more for some reason; It just tasted like a sponge cake with light berry sauce. It's hard not to fault them for it, but we just expected more out of it. \n\nService: don't remember his name, but was wearing a black cap and had a septum piercing. Overall, fantastic. He was engaging, friendly, prompt and checked in to make sure everything was top notch. The service alone bumped a 3 star good experience to a 4 star, we will return experience.\n\nAll in all, we had a great time. You can't beat the million dollar views, especially on a nice day. We can't speak on the drinks since it's hard to mess up a mimosa, but the menu looked like it had a ton of great options with a  lot of nice beers to choose from. I'd suggest picking a few small plates to share. Oh, be sure to make reservations online.\n\nWould I go out of my way to come back, sure, but weather permitting with the right people.", "author": "Ryan L."}

Came here with a friend for a catchup dinner and though there was a line outside we were able to get a table immediately since the line was for the cocktail bar.\nYou walk into this semi-dark hall to take an elevator up to the restaurant which can kind of seem scary at first, but once those elevator doors open you will be amazed. Wooden tables, small stools, plastic linings as walls, lighted candles that dec the tables...a relaxing and lovely atmosphere! \n\nMenu was simple--2 pages for small plates/tapas and meats/skewers. The rest was a list if drinks/wines/cocktails. I got a Pina colada (I forgot what drink my friend got but it was pretty strong) because I'm a sucker for fruity/sweet drinks. My drink was perfect-creamy, milky, not too much blended ice, good balance of sweetness/acidity. Between us, we ordered the ceviche and half pound slow roasted pork shoulder to share. It was definitely more than enough and we even had leftovers. The ceviche was chilled and fresh--a mixture of picco de gallo/salsa and freshly peeled chunks of shrimp. Paired with the crunchy tortilla chips served along, it was a perfect intro to our heavier entree to come. The entree came with warmed up tortillas, baked black beans with a sprinkle of cheese, mildly spicy salsa, big chunks of slow roasted pork shoulder, and a big piece of fried pig skin w/ some veggies to top it all off. I kind of just wrapped a little bit of everything into my tortilla and ate. The pork was super soft, moist, tender, rich and flavorful. Non of that overcooked dryness/toughness, saltiness, or too much smokiness and oiliness. The baked beans added a nice smooth texture, the salsa a nice spicy, refreshing kick to a 3-dimensional flavor, and the pig skin a nice crunch in contrast the smoothness/creaminess of everything else.\n\nI was so full after the meal, and for the first time in a long time...didn't feel the need to order dessert to feel satisfied (though I'd be curious to try next time). Service was great--waiters were very attentive and constantly checked up on us, and minimal wait time for a table/food.

We were very impressed! The location is a very diverse one in the mission neighborhood of San Francisco, we took an elevator up to the roof and were greeted immediately upon stepping out of the elevator by a very friendly waitress. We were worried it was going to be a long wait to be seated but she identified a group that was sitting in the dinner area only having drinks and successfully managed to ask them politely to move to the bar area to allow space for my family. That was a huge plus in my book! We had a really nice view of San Francisco from the rooftop on a very nice warm day, and even as it got late we weren't concerned about San Francisco's typical chilly weather because they had heaters and the rooftop was designed to minimize the cold breeze in the evening. The food was absolutely delicious and  we highly enjoyed all the food we ordered. I have to say though you may enjoy the small tapas best during happy hour where you can get more bang for your buck, the sangria doubled in price right after happy hour LOL but everything was great so no complaints here.

To make a long story short I told our server we'd just be drinking and he wasn't thrilled either. I have never felt so unwanted somewhere. Seems like everyone who works at this place is a jerk.

It is absolutely beautiful up there and the ambiance is perfect. It was near 8, so the sun was going down and the crowd was lively. The view is also spectacular and it feels like a local spot. As we were waiting for our table, a hi top became available in the bar area--which is right next to the low top dining tables. If you get one of these tables, stay there. It was warmer and you could see the views better. But, to my stubbornness, we waited for a low top and soon regretted it. \n\nOn to the food and drinks. The margaritas are delicious and not too sweet. The guacamole was good, nothing to boast about. We got the pollo frito, which is fried chicken bits with a yummy habanero salsa--delicious meal! Then we got a 1/2 lb of chicarrones de carne ($19) tender pork-shoulder and house made tortillas. This was delicious and a lot of food for two! \n\nAll in all, it was not very great service for the price we paid (they lost our card for about 25 mins), but it was a great experience, and I would definitely go again.

The place is perfect in every way and I even had the pleasure of dining on the rooftop on one of our sunniest mornings we have had in a long time.  Sunday brunch is the BOMB!  Stellar service!  The view...the view...the view!  The beef empanada (small plate) was utterly sabrosa!  Yes, I had a margarita on the rocks at 11a and it was tasty perfect with a nice, high-end agave tequila.  (Hey, it was my first day off after a LONG week!) The Huevos Rancheros were deliciosa with the corn tortilla crispy (just like I like it) and the beans were large fava beans.  SUPERB!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOR A SUNDAY BRUNCH. \n\nFavorite side story:  upon arrival at 10:45 (I didn't realize that they open right at 11a) I walked up to a nice man sitting on a stool right outside what I THOUGHT was the entry to the restaurant.  But, it was not.  He was the door guard for a marijuana dispensary and we both laughed when I said I had an 11a reservation and he politely informed me that it was right next door and opened at 11.  Had a great conversation with him about his lower back pain as I told him that hot and cold packs on his spine might work as it cured me of some pain recently. Well, aside from what they had inside the dispensary where he works which is another type of treatment for pain.  Hehe.", "author": "Dana J."}

I put in a reservation for 4 which was around a 30 minutes wait on a Tuesday. Went upstairs and it was a rooftop restaurant/bar with a beautiful view of the sky and the city. We ordered many tapa dishes, desserts and a pitcher of margarita.\n\nStarted off with a pitcher of margarita and all our cups had salt rimmed on it. The pitcher was a bit smaller than a usual pitcher size and the salt on our cups were super salty compared to usual salt I've tried haha. It tasted good but with the ice it gets watered down quickly so enjoying it slowly will result In a more diluted drink. \n\nFoods:\n- guac and chips: guac needed a kick to it, like salsa or something spicy. It was thick and the avocado was still in large pieces. There wasn't enough chips to go with the guac, so we ordered more. \n- Platano Maduro: it was not as good as I hoped since I am a fan of plantains. It was too dry and overcooked and lacked flavor unless I dipped it in the sour cream.\n- Pollo Fritos: my friends were a fan of this dish because the chicken wasn't covered in batter but had more of the chicken instead. The sauce that same with it went very well with the fried chicken and a kick of spice. \n- empanadas: came in two but they were good! The sauce was too oily so I ate without. Very crispy outside and the pork had a good flavorful. \n- elote: the corn itself was sweet but the flavoring was lacking. I wish they put some chili powder top too.\n- Chicharrones de Carne: one of my favorite dishes of the night. We ordered a pound to share among four girls ($22) and the pork was delicious! A small Sweet kick to it and very soft inside. It came with tortillas, beans, and salsa to make your own taco. We used a bit of the guac from our chips and it was perfect! A must order here!\n\nDesserts:\n- alfajores: MUST ORDER!! The cookies are so delicate and delicious with the caramel in between. Took the waitress's advice to dip it in the hot cocoa and it was bomb! The hot chocolate was also unique in flavor! Different than your usual hot cocoa so order it and try this for sure!\n- dulce de leche flan: very sweet with a layer of creams br\u00fbl\u00e9e sugar on top and passion fruit jelly. A unique mixture with some sourness and sweetness combined but also very good with each bite and the crumbs. \n\nService was a bit slow due it being very packed.

Someone wanted to reach for the stars and go on a rooftop, and our Mission District acclimated comrade just bookmarked El Techo the night before. \n\nWith the combo of great service, bawm food, one of the best views of the city, and some fortunate timing on our part, this place is that top tier gewdness.\n\nSeemed like a very popular place, so we tried to get reservations, but with our late thinking, we weren't able to. There is a designated line outside of El Techo with a very friendly doorman / front desk assistant. He said that the wait for 6 was about 45 minutes, but since we arrived around the late lunch time, where people from the opening rush were leaving, we were seating about 2 minutes after we arrived. Sah-woop! \n\nThe menu is smaller than other places, but definitely makes up for the amazing quality of the food. the 6 of us shared a point of the chicharones, the ceviche (no avocado - I'm allergic!), one order of empanadas, the Rancheros, the benedict, and the chips with guac. For 6 people, this was just the right amount for all of us to try a bit of each dish, and feel very satisfied and full at the end of the meal. The highlights were the chicharones and the ceviche for sure. The ceviche was the perfect balance of tartness, fresh seafood, and spice, and the chicharones paired with the creamiest beans, bawm shallots, tortillas and salsa made for a perfect taco. \n\nAll together, with tax and tip, each of us paid $16 - we robbed them of delicious food, such a steal!\n\nThe service we got was phenomenal throughout our whole meal. Everyone was amazingly hospitable and made our meal that much better. \n\nI'm so excited for the next time I get to go to this restaurant - hopefully will get a chance to go here in the evening with some sangria.

My friends and I waited for about an hour before being able to go upstairs to go find a high-top table.  We had asked the server what he would recommend the 3 of us should do food-wise but we decided not to since one of my friends doesn't eat pork.  When we went to order the food, our server kinda seemed offended that we didn't take up his suggestion.  He even said to me, \"did you not hear what I suggested...\" and I was like \"we decided on something else\" and he gave me a look.  We all ordered a round of drinks, I had the pi\u00f1a colada and it was pretty good.  It was decently strong for the amount of foam that came with it.  My friend had the Paloma and that was pretty strong as well.  She enjoyed my pi\u00f1a colada so much that she ordered one for herself afterwards.  I wasn't too big of a fan about it, but then again, I'm not a huge fan of coconut to begin with.  We ordered some starters to share.  We had the corn one (elote)  which only came with 3 halves for $9, a bit pricey, but still delicious.  I had the quesadilla de pibil which was quite delicious but also pricey.  I thought the tortilla had an overpowering flavor though so it was basically like eating a tortilla with meat inside.  My group also shared the chips and guacamole.  You could tell they made the guacamole fresh because it was REALLY good.  My friends ordered the plantains and a skewer which I didn't try but it seemed like they enjoyed them.  The service was okay, he checked up on us a few times to make sure everything was okay, although it was a little difficult to track him down to grab the check.  The later it gets, the more crowded it seems.  When we were leaving, I heard a waitress tell someone that there were 25 parties in front of them (and this was at like 8:00).  I don't really understand what the hype is about this place.  It's a rooftop bar, but you can't really enjoy the view unless you get a seat near the edge (and even then, the windows are filthy).

That may sound a hyperbole, but it's not. \n\nTo make an incredibly long story short, I came to El Techo with a group of 7 friends. To clarify, we had all been there before, some of us over 5 times. This time we came for dinner, we ordered dinner, we ate no dinner. \n\nFor starters, we were told when we put our names down that there were 2 groups ahead of us and it would be a 20-30 minute wait. So we went to a bar next door to kill time. 40 minutes later we checked in with the hostess who told us the 2 groups were still in front of us and it would probably be another 30-40 minutes... Frustrated and quite hungry at this point we decided to just cut our lossss get food elsewhere. As we were about to walk into another restaurant, we got a call saying our table was ready, so we turned and walked back. \n\nIt was quite late at this point and we were worried that both the bar and kitchen would be closing soon, so we ordered immediately. We waited about 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive and with them came our apps and a plate of carnitas, a dish that we ordered 2 of... Red flag number 1. We proceeded to wait at least another 15-20 minutes at which point people that sat down after us had gotten their food. Our waitress then checked in with us and let us know that 1) the first plate of carnitas was a mistake And that we would still be getting 2 additional plates and that 2) the kitchen was now closed but we should rest assured our food would be coming out \"soon\". Another 20 minutes passes. \n\nThen, the kicker: our waitress comes up to our table and says \"I'm really sorry but I forgot to put in the ticket for your entrees and they will not be coming out because the kitchen is closed.\" She then walked away. \n\nYou can imagine how many jaws dropped. She let us know that they could probably bring us a few quesadillas and another pitcher of margs on the house. We sent one of my friends to go talk to her and request the entire meal be comped because this situation was utterly ridiculous. She proceeded to send the manager over to our table who tried to \"reason with us\". He said he'd be willing to comp 2 pitchers, the mistaken plate of carnitas, and a few of the chips and guacamole. We pushed back but eventually conceded because we were irate and starving and just wanted to get out of there. \n\nUtterly shocking that the manager couldn't recognize the future value he was losing by not comping our entire meal. Well, I hope they enjoyed their $74, because needless to say none of us will be returning.", "author": "Sophie H."}

I can then vouch for the Techo Rancheros as an entree - well portioned and filling.\n\nMaybe the food in a vacuum doesn't make me want to extoll its virtues and shout them from the rooftops, but it's hard to argue with the experience as a whole.

Let alone a rooftop bar. It's casually located next to the Foreign Cinema and as you walk up your greeted by a host/hostess on a barstool outside. The then direct you to the elevator where you take the ride up to the \"penthouse\" and once the doors open it's honestly (I guess literally in this sense) a breathe of fresh air. \n\nThere are tables on the left for a sit down experience and standing tables with barstools on the right for drinks. We were seated at the tables which are underneath a tarp that they let down when it gets really cold or windy. The fantastic part about it is all the panels are see thru so you're not blocking out those at the bar. There is a really great ambiance once the sun sets and both times it's been really busy the entire time I came (around 6-10pm).\n\nThe first time we made it for happy hour and got a few pitchers of Sangria which is pretty tasty and a great deal for hh and as a starter. For starters we ordered the Patacon, Guacamole, and Ceviche. If you like plantains I would definitely get the Patacon. It came out hot with I believe mashed black brand and queso fresco. It was great, not too bland for either the plantain or the beans. It was a great combo. The guac is guac, but very good guac nonetheless! My favorite starter was probably the ceviche. It had a lot of flavour and the shrimp tasted fresh with the right balance of the avocado, lime, and radish. I recommend the ceviche and Patacon.\n\nFor \"entrees\" (both visits) we ordered the Elote, Quesadilla de Pibil, the mix and match skewers, and the Chicarones de Carne. Oh my god, the highlight of my entire night was that Chicarones. You would be remiss if you did not order that. It was perfectly most and fell a part once the fork touched it. It came with tortillas and mashed black beans so you kind of build it together however you want. It was amazing. If you had to order just one thing I'd recommend that. The half pound is big enough to share between two people. I liked the elote, a bit messy but hey cant complain (bring floss though lol). The quesadilla was good, it had some great flavors but at the end of the day it was the Chicarones that stole my heart. \n\nWe managed to fit in dessert and went with the trust Alfajores which comes with hot chocolate. Both were perfect! The cookie was soft and powdery all in the right places and the hot chocolate was not too sweet with a great thick consistency so not watered down. \n\nI haven't been to too many rooftop bars in SF but El Techo is definitely a great time. They definitely take into consideration our bi-polar weather and the crowd is all around enjoyable. I'm sure I'll be coming back again, if not for that Chicarones!", "author": "Christine C."}

Service was shmeh.\n\nMy 2 cousins and I came on a Sunday afternoon for the first time without a reservation. We knew to expect a line so we didn't mind waiting. The host suggested we put our name down for a table so we did. We asked how long the wait would be and he said he wasn't sure probably 20-30 minutes but there were 3 parties in front of us so we had time to grab a drink somewhere and come back. He did notify us that we would get a text that allowed us 10 minutes to come back. We left to get a drink next door. We ordered our drinks. The time it took to walk next door to Foreign Cinema, get seated and order drinks probably took about 3 minutes. Two minutes after we ordered, we got a text that our table was ready. The bartender was already making our drinks so we didn't want to be rude and get up and leave but we were irritated that we were told 20-30 minutes and the text came less than 5 minutes later. Our expensive drinks came, we chugged them without getting to enjoy them and ran back to try to make it to our reservation. We got there 2 minutes after our 10 minute window so they gave up our table. We put our names on again and he said we would grab a drink and come back but we decided not to because of what had just happened. Thank God we didn't leave and GRAB A DRINK because we got a text that our table was ready 2 minutes later. \n\nWe went up the elevator and when the doors opened we were blown away. It was a perfect Sunday afternoon and the view alone made up for the minor infraction but that didn't last long. We got seated and a server came by and dropped some Elote off at our table. He said \"Elote for the ladies\" dropped it off and walked away. We were really surprised because we had never been to a place that gave customers complimentary Elote when they sat down. It turns out that they don't because another waiter came by and reprimanded us. He walked up to us and said\n\nWaiter:  Where did you come from? (very rudely)\nMe: I'm sorry???\nWaiter: I said where did you come from?\nMe: We just got-\nWaiter: Did you order that? *points to Elote*\nMe: No... a waiter came by and dropped it off at our table but-\nWaiter: So you would just put your hands on food that you didn't order? Who would do that?!\nMe: I'm sorry we didn't know. We thought he was just giving it to us because-\nWaiter: *picks up the Elote and gives it to the next table.\n\nHad he waited we would have told him we were sorry for the miscommunication and that we thought it was complimentary but since he didn't bother to wait for our apology my cousin looked at me and said \"That was rude!\" He turned around and proceeded to say \"That was rude?!\" My cousin looked at him and said \"Yeah..\" to which he just walked away. Accusing your customers of PURPOSELY taking something that wasn't theirs was rude. Honestly, I wouldn't have cared had he told us that it wasn't ours but the fact that he asked me \"Where I came from\" like I wasn't allowed to be there and then cut me off when I tried to explain myself, really ticked me off.\n\nI suppose to try and make up for it, he did end up giving us Elote, on the house, which we greatly appreciated. We wanted to try to let his previous attitude go because we felt like he tried to make up for it but we could tell through the rest of our stay that he didn't really like us from tending to other tables and LITERALLY looking over ours to having to flag him down to pay our check. One of our orders hadn't come to our table and it took us 20 minutes after our other food was already half eaten to even see him to let him know.\n\nIf I could give this place 5 stars on food alone I would. I'm not a fan of beans but the beans that came with the Chicharrones were killer and it may have converted me just so I can eat their beans again. The Chicharrones were amazing. When you look at the menu and try to decide between a half pound and a pound and you start to reason with yourself and tell yourself you can't eat a pound, tell yourself that your mind is lying because YOU CAN EAT A POUND. You won't regret it. It's perfectly salty with a little bit of sweetness that's really nice. We ordered another order of Elote alongside the complimentary one that we had and I could have ordered another one but I did not want to deplete their corn stash. I'm dreaming of it right now. We also got the Coctel Camarones and it was awesome and tangy just the way I like it. We ordered some pitcher of some kind of margarita that I can't remember the name of but honestly, any drink is probably good. We definitely finished every bit of everything we ate. The portions were good. The food was amazing. We loved ALMOST everything. Maybe it was just a busy day and the employees were spent but having worked in customer service for most of life in some way, shape or form, you know that how you make customers feel when they walk in and when they leave speaks volumes.", "author": "Jessica S."}

A bit disappointing that our waitress couldn't better advise.

One of my friends from Spain was in town so we decided to go topside to see what this was all about. I think the only drawback with this popularity is that you wait a lot. There's a line to get upstairs. Then you wait some more for a table. At least on the second part you can drink while doing it. Can't really drink on the sidewalk unless you're hiding a flask or a 40 in a paper bag. Once you get up, you get the view of the city which is rare for eating establishments. Started off with a pitcher of the Techo margaritas which has some mezcal (smokey). After we were seated, our group went with:\n\nPatac\u00f3n\ngreen plantain patty, black beans, queso fresco\n\nGuacamole \ntortilla chips\n\nCeviche de Mango\nmango, jicama, cucumber, lime, habanero\n\nCeviche de Camaron\nshrimp, lime, tomato, red onion, cucumber, avocado, cilantro\n\nEmpanada de Alambre \nbraised beef, pickled cabbage\n\nFlautas de Pollo\ntomato poached chicken, pickled cabbage\n\nElote \ncorn on the cob, sour cream, chili, lime\n\nQuesadilla de Acelga\noaxaca cheese, kale, mushrooms, salsas\n\nQuesadilla de Pibil\nbraised pork shoulder, oaxaca cheese, salsas\n\nChicharrones de puerco y pollo\n\nChoripan\nchorizo, chimichurri, red onion\n\nTres Leches cake\n\nEverything was solid. Sometimes even surprisingly good. THough I have to say I've basically eaten at every Paganini resto now and have had good experiences across the board. Drinks are also pretty tasty to boot.

I know they serve food, but we were there to grab a drink or two and just hang out for a bit. \n\nMediocre looks, lacking drinks and a HUGE issue with their bills/POS machine...\n\nLooks\nPicture a huge tent with tables and chairs underneath it with clear drapes that surround it so it's a semi-enclosed space but you still get a view of the city. Personally I think it's a waste since the reason you go to the roof of any place is to check out the view and the sky and just feel like you're outside. This place...not so much. I get it though....it's relatively cold in the city and they're trying to make it comfortable for everyone, but overall it sort of ruins the reason for a rooftop joint. \n\nDrinks\nHad a bottle of wine and a few cocktails. First, we tried ordering a Jack Daniels and coke. No Jack Daniels. We then tried ordering Johnnie Walker, same result. The waitress told us they don't carry mainstream alcohol.....lol what? But Lolinda does downstairs....? \n\nBill\nOk so our bill came out and it included a 20% gratuity which is fine since we had 6 in our party. We went on through the night and the next morning my gf checked the bill because she sensed it was off somehow. Turns out the bill didn't add up and we were charged an extra $6 somewhere. Yea, I know it's only $6, but it looks like it's an issue with their machine because it just adds up incorrectly. If that's the case, then everyone who has been there may have been overcharged as well. Girlfriend promptly called the restaurant to let them know and the lady said, \"yea we just opened so we're still working out the bugs\". She gave us the manager's email and she emailed  picture of the receipt and we're awaiting a reply. \n\nI understand that it's somewhat new and they're still getting their act together, but even if they fix those issues it just doesn't feel like a rooftop place that I'd enjoy with views of the city.

So yeah, one of those almost generic \"good, but not for that price\" sort of places. \n\nThe venue is superb, though.  Really great atmosphere and a wonderful view, and it would be an ideal way to spend a Sunday afternoon or something, if you had the money and calories to burn.  But the problem is that it's a pain in the ass to actually get to, and table management is pretty nonexistent.  That is, it took my group and I 10-15 minutes to wait in line to ride the elevator up.  I know that it was specifically to ride the elevator up because the person I asked said that it wasn't at capacity yet, they just needed to wait for the elevator.  What the fuck?  \n\nOf course, even \"not at capacity,\" it was still pretty full, and finding a place to have drinks and cocktails was pretty difficult.  We had to chickenhawk for about 10 more minutes before finding counterspace, and even then we didn't have seats, which sucked after a day of walking around the city and goddamn I just wanted a refreshing cocktail.  There was absolutely no system in place to distribute seats in an orderly way unless you were ordering meals, which would have been understandable if there hadn't been a good 10-15 minute wait to get into the damn place where they could do things like simple logistics.  But I guess the people at the front (ground?) door were too busy socializing with each other/their friends to do something about that.\n\nThat being said, the service was surprisingly fast given how unorganized the rest of it was.

Way to make money for a crowded ass night that you can't see the sight when is everybody standing.\n\nFood was mediocre. Better off somewhere else that has authentic Latin food. This is just very very bland for the price and portion. I don't even know I even had this bookmarks. Worst place I've ever been into. Worst than fuckin mcdonalds. I don't even know why there is so many good reviews about this place. It must be because people haven't seen the city on top of a roof before.

He rather than let him sit preferred us to leave. It isn't because of the service, cause the utensils are in a can and they only have paper napkins, nothing formal.

I have been here twice now-- once towards the end of the brunch rush and once at peak dinner time on a Saturday night. I preferred my brunch experience because we were seated almost right away. The drinks were really great (particularly the La Paloma). And I am a sucker for good jalapeno corn bread. I was with a group of 6 and we arrived late afternoon (around 3pm) on a Saturday. There is a beautiful view of the city from this rooftop location. And the food and drinks live up to the quality of the view. \n\nThe dinner experience, while still good, was a bit more of a production. The whole experience took about 3 hours. I came here with a girlfriend. First, we had to grab a spot to stand in the \"bar\" area. You are not allowed to order a drink at the bar but have to wait for a server to come to you. Good luck finding a table to sit at in this area-- you have to be pretty aggressive and vigilant (we got lucky about 30 minutes into our wait and found a high top for 2 people). We ended up waiting an hour and a half for a table. When we finally got seated we ordered 4 dishes: guacamole, fried chicken, street corn, and the ceviche. The street corn and the ceviche were my favorite dishes but everything was delicious. \n\nAll in all the experience was pleasant. The food, drinks, and view were really great.

Well, while this place also serves food (unlike those aforementioned bars), I still think this does place doesn't capture what a rooftop bar should entail. In other words, the views aren't that majestic and its way too crowded with tables/chairs/people. The point of having a rooftop joint is to enjoy whatever view it gives. There needs to be more space for standing and looking down at Mission St. Here, being up high is sort of pointless. You might as well just have a patio restaurant that's not on a roof.\n\nAt any rate, we ordered a few pitches of margaritas and a couple huge 32 oz. bottles of an El Salvadorian beer called Regia.

The food order was as follows: Ceviche de Camaron, Chicharrones, and the Benedictos. I'm not sure if I would order the ceviche again. It didn't have enough of a \"kick\" to it, but it wasn't completely without flavor. The Chicharrones were my favorite. They were so tender, and the tortillas and salsa that accompanied them made the dish even better. The Benedictos were good, but I wish there was more sauce on the dish. The view of this place is nice, and the service is pretty good too. I can't wait to go back for dinner and try a few items from that menu.", "author": "Jessika V."}

(repeat x10)\n\nSounds cool and it is pretty cool because how many rooftop bars have you been to?!? I haven't been to many so I thought it was awesome. To get to the bar, you go through some dimly lit hallway and make your way to the elevator to get to the roof. There are signs that point you to the right way so you won't get lost, plus it's a short walk. I thought the entire thing was cool because it made me feel special or something, like I'm going to a secret party where I go through a secret way into the secret elevator like in the movies... but anyway it was just a different way to enter the bar/restaurant. \n\nThe place isn't too big but there are plenty of tables. You also get a nice view of SF while drinking and eating. It has a nice chill vibe to it. You don't need to be extra fancy but it's also weird if you're super casual. They close pretty early, last call is at 12am and everyone has to be out by 1am since they sit on top of a residential building that pretty much forces them to clear out everyone to avoid noise violations. My group and I got there pretty late so we just got drinks. They have interesting drink concotions and I chose to get the Cuba Libre. I loved my drink! It was like a sour coke almost. The drink was lime, rum, and mexican coca cola! It was a nice refreshingly light drink and I drank it like it was water. I tried some of my friends drink and it was pretty good. A lot of sour/sweet combinations which I guess maybe is popular in latin american drinks? Not sure, but I enjoyed it. \n\nA great stop if you're in the mission!", "author": "Jennifer H."}

First time was the second night the rooftop bar was open, and I choice not to write a review until now since I know the first week can be hectic and unrepresentative of future nights.  But I recently came back and felt that not much had been improved upon.  We had to wait about 45 minutes to get a table, then another 20 minutes before the waiter even acknowledged us, and additional 30 minutes to get chips and guacamole.  Our waiter was super nice, and didn't bill us for the chips and guac because the wait was outrageous.  He told us the kitchen ran out of chips and apologized.  \n\nSo, there's a whole lot of waiting here, with one exception - drinks.  You can get a drink both with table service and in the bar area in about 10 minutes.  I would definitely go back for a drink, but probably not order food again.  Don't get me wrong, the food was great once we got it, but it just took forever to get.  The view is exquisite, and paired with an after work cocktail, is definitely worth a visit.\n\nThe only thing I would note for management is about adapting to demand.  We were chatting with our waiter and I was telling him how I had been there during opening week, and I expected them to have it together by now.  He agreed.  He told me that certain days of the week had been more crowded (we were there on a Wednesday and this was the case) and that management knew the previous Wednesdays had been crowded, yet no extra waiters or staff had been added to help with demand.", "author": "Stephanie V."}

Definitely not the place to go if you're trying to have a romantic dinner date as it gets REALLY loud, especially during happy hour. Needless to say, it's an excellent experience and place for tapas and drinks. I opted for a pina colada over a margarita as I haven't had a pina colada in a really long time before going here. Beware, the drink is really strong! Like, I'm almost sure the drink was 70% rum. It had a hint of cinnamon in it, which some people may not like. I also had the plantain chips, ceviche, and carnitas. All were excellent. The half pound of carnitas is a lot though, but I'm not complaining. Service is fast if you manage to wave down a waiter.", "author": "Jennalyn L."}

We absentmindedly joined it and overheard other people talking about whether they were eating or just drinking, so my friend went up to check with the hostess and told her we were hungry too. Somehow that allowed us to skip the line and take the elevator right up to a patio with great music and an amazing view. We quickly ordered a pitcher of margaritas and some appetizers to share. The fried plantains were delicious (if maybe served a little too hot) and the guacamole was good too. We were still a little hungry so we ordered a few more skewers of meat and another pitcher of margaritas. The margaritas never came, and when we asked our server about it, she said, \"you never got your margaritas?\" I'm not sure why she thought we'd ask about them if they HAD come, but eventually she brought out more.

I'll probably revisit in a few months.\n\nThe heavy duty tent-roof eliminates the wind/cold, but the resulting echo increases the decibel level by 15 points: be prepared to shout to your tablemates on a busy night unless you opt for the stools past the elevator (outside the heated zone but much quieter). \n\nWe visited last Saturday. The host said we could wait on those stools while a table cleared. The waiter serving that area told us we'd need to close our tab if we moved because the new table wasn't in his section. However, we didn't get the drinks until about 20 minutes later, well after we moved and had another server check in. The new table was ~15 feet from the stools. \n\nWe never saw the new server again, and the old one never closed out our tab as he said we needed to do. When we tried to order food the kitchen had been closed for 20 minutes-- about 30 minutes after we tried to get anyone's attention. \n\nThe pleasantly redeeming part of the evening was the host, who checked in on us a couple of times since the table was right behind his podium and he saw our efforts to flag someone down. He also delivered a round of tequila shots on the house as an apology for what he admitted was us \"getting lost in the shuffle.\" That's what brought this experience to 3 stars from 2. \n\nIt might help if the servers had a uniform of some kind (all one color/style or whatever). The hardest part about having to flag someone down (besides having to flag someone down for service) was being unsure if they were a server or patron.

One of the better restaurants I've been to in the city. \n\nChips and guac is something you can get anywhere, so it's not something to really be talked about unless it's extraordinary. This place...definitely had some exemplary guac (sidenote: I really don't like when people say \"guac\" out loud because it's just like come on just say guacamole, but it's a lot to type so I apologize to anyone else that is not so keen on the word \"guac\"). Sharing it between 4 people was hard because, well, I wanted all of it. Moral of the story: start with the chips and guac.\n\nDrinks, of number one importance obviously: \nWe ordered a pitcher of La Paloma which was bomb, I couldn't even taste the tequila (which is great, also dangerous). Our server comped us a drink because he spilled a tiny bit on his way to us, which earned him brownie points. \n\nFood, the second most important part: \nHighly recommend the Quesadilla de Acelga if you're a fan of Kale + mushroom. I happen to be one, and I was thoroughly impressed with this quesadilla from the Gods. If I could marry a quesadilla, it would be this one. \n\nAnother plate I recommend is the skewer combo, we did 3 - chicken, shrimp, and chorizo. All three were on point and it would break my heart to just choose one of the skewers, but if it was life-threatening, I would have to go with chorizo (for the people who just want one skewer and need to know which is the best one). \n\nWe also ordered the empanadas, and the Quesadilla de Pibil - both good too, but are not staple recommendations like the prior two dishes I demand that you order. The 4 dishes in total made for a very good sized meal amongst the 4 of us. \n\nWhat made all of this an even greater experience was the rooftop view - it's beautiful.

We arrived at 10:30 am (1/2 hour before opening) and were first in line for non-reservation customers.  However, when it came time to seat our group, they informed us that we could only have a high table as all the lower tables were reserved.  We said \"fine\" since we knew we were being seated as walk-ins.  What they didn't inform us was that the high table was outside of the main dining area whose only view was of the new, ugly condominiums to the south and of the restrooms.   Besides being segregated from the main dining area by partitions, it was also in full sun with no shade.  They had not provided silverware when our food was brought so I had to get up and go take some from another table.  I twice requested that we be given a table in the main dining area, but were refused.  Why a view restaurant would offer a table with no view to its customers is a mystery which I can only attribute to greed.    The food was OK - the eggs benedict however was mostly bread.  There was also a disconnect with the check-in downstairs versus the check-in upstairs.  Although first in-line, some non-reservation customers got in the same elevator with us and since they entered last they got to exit first.  This may have cost us a table in the main restaurant.\n\nThe most depressing aspect was that when we arrived there was no line for walk-ins yet at Foreign Cinema, one of the best brunch restaurants in the city.

I wish I could give it 5 stars, but it just had something missing for that perfect review. I haven't found a lot of rooftop places in the city and this one was great. I loved the view, the atmosphere, the ambiance - everything about the look and feel of this place was great! I thought that it would be really cold in the evening on a chilly friday night, but they've managed their heating very well so that it's not too hot or cold even though the place gets relatively crowded.\n\nI ordered the passion fruit and ginger drink because I asked the server to recommend a more sweet drink. It was good, but it wasn't great. A lot of people seemed to be enjoying the pitchers of margaritas, so maybe I'll try that next time I go. I also tried the sangria, which was also not the best sangria I've had - it was a little watery and tasteless. \n\nThe food was pretty yummy! I love spanish corn and they served corn on the cob with sour cream, mexican cheese, and some spices. It was delicious! I also tried the guacamole and the vegetarian quesadilla - both of which were average. The guacamole tasted like any other guacamole I've had and the quesadilla had a little too much kale for my liking. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this place just because the ambiance and the feel of the place. There was nothing wrong with the drinks or the food, just not 5-star quality, unfortunately.", "author": "Malika R."}

My four friends and I were on the hunt for Mexican food when we stumbled upon this restaurant. Outside the host was kind of snarky to us and we actually did not think about going inside but decided we would give it a try. She told us to take the elevator up stairs and to have fun. We were not sure what to expect. When the doors opened we found ourselves at a very fun and hip rooftop bar. The rest of the staff was very polite and helpful unlike the hostess downstairs. The food was even better then the service and we were very happy with it. My vegetarian friend ordered the ensuite and was quite happy with it although the portion was small. My carnivorous friends and I ordered the ceviche de pescado, torta de pibil, tostadas de alambre and carnitas. All of the dishes were exquisite. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "author": "Anonymous D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-30", "description": "3.5 stars.  I came here after work on a Tuesday and even though it was a chilly and windy day this place was packed.  After ordering drinks we had to wait forever for them to arrive which was annoying.  The drinks literally arrived at the same time as our food!  And after all that waiting the drinks weren't even good - all served with way too many melty ice cubes and the two mezcal-based cocktails lacked the flavor of that wonderful smoky spirit, overpowered by the other ingredients.\n\nBut although their service and cocktails were subpar, the food was actually good... just overpriced (as small plates tend to be).  I highly recommend the chicharrones de carne.  The pork shoulder was tender and flavorful, the deep fried pork rind contributed a great textural contrast, the corn tortillas were soft and homemade.  Finished with black beans and salsa, it was the perfect soft taco.  Our server told us that a half pound was a good portion for 2-3 people but personally I thought my group of 4 could have easily shared the full pound or even 1.5 lbs - that would've been much more economical too!  The fried chicken thigh was also well executed - crispy skin, spicy slaw.  We also ordered chips and salsa even though it wasn't on their menu and I do like the salsa - a tad sweet and not overwhelmingly onion-y.  Unfortunately the problem with small plates is that we each spent $25 for a drink and some food and left only half full.\n\nSo in summary - good food if you're into small plates, disappointing cocktails, and insanely windy despite all their attempts to provide some shelter.  I was one guy lose some cash because the wind blew it away!  This whole rooftop bar thing must be better during brunch but otherwise it's probably only a pleasant experience 4-5 evenings a year.", "author": "Beatrice W."}

We were coming from out of town and my friends were coming from east bay and the Richmond district. When we arrived, I was told by the door guy that they had tried to call the previous day, but because I hadn't answered, our reservation wasn't certain. Kinda ridiculous because, yes I got an unknown call but without a voicemail I didn't pay any attention to the call. Anyhoo, after 5 minutes he came over and said we had a table, but chastised me that next time I should answer their call  or else my table would  be given away and that I really needed to call them back. I'm 33, and I don't need to be reprimanded by a doorman at a tapas restaurant in front of my friends. Especially when I had a reservation!  If you don't think making a reservation through open table is sufficient, please don't use it for your business. Or if you need additional confirmation, leave a voicemail or send an email.\n\nNeedless to say, there will not be a next time.

And if it does, it's at very low quantities\n\n\nOverall, this restaurant is lucky they have the views they do because their food is for sure not worth coming for.

I love hole in the wall joints too, but if a restaurant has good food AND it's pretty, I just fall in love.\n\nSo after a day of shopping with my buddy, we accidentally land at El Techo de Lolinda. I saw that they had a rooftop section so we go to try it out.\n\nFirst a disclaimer - we went one a day that was raining in the morning so it was pretty empty. I talked to my friend about this place and he told me it is usually pretty packed. On that particular night though, my friend and I had the rooftop almost all to ourselves and it was beautiful.\n\nWe start off with drinks. I go with the Caipirinha and my friend with the margarita. Both are well made, delicious, and reasonably priced. We are still sitting wondering why this place isn't packed.\n\nThen come the appetizer - a fresh Ceviche to share. It's a little bit too much juice, but it's really tangy and delicious.\n\nNow for the main - Half pound of CHICHARRONES de CARNE ($13). This seems to be their signature dish, and rightfully so. These aren't the basic cracklins you get at the store. It's juicy with quite a bit of meat, with a crispy exterior, and a savory sweet flavor. I don't know what they do to the outside, but the hint of sweet really makes this dish. They also come with a side of pickled vegetables which go really well with the savory chicharrones. Half pound was more than enough for two girls. \n\nI thought the price was really reasonable considering the drinks we got and the deliciousness of the food. I'd like to come back on a clear warm day, but I am a bit scared everyone else would have the same idea :P", "author": "Julie K."}

Was seated in a low 2 person table crammed right between another table and the open kitchen. Plenty of other tables with views were available but having a reservation doesn't mean getting a good table. \n\nBloody Maria was weak and the pickled veggies didn't mix well with the flavors. Definitely could have used more of a kick and more tequila. \n\nOrdered the Matambre and had been looking forward to trying this for the last week. Asked for my eggs to be over medium and when the dish arrived, the burnt to a crisp two eggs were just a hard disgusting brown circle. Removed it and placed on a separate plate until the server finally came back, which was about 15 minutes. The 6oz skirt steak was pre-sliced under the eggs, which was disappointing. The potatoes were babies and cooked well. All of this was swimming in the Chimichurri oily mess. Should have been put in a side dish to drizzle yourself. The best part of the entire dish was the brioche. That's pretty damn sad. Finally got the eggs i ordered and they again had the dark brown edge but at least the yolks were runny. \n\nHusband had the 1/2lb Chicharrones de carne. Lots of burnt to a crisp pieces that were inedible and the whole dish was lacking flavor. Salsa was weak and the beans were just plain.\n\nOverall a very sad experience and wish it was a lot yummier.

I brought a friend with me tonight, anxious to share this special spot with him, and as we arrived at the door, the doorman told us they were at capacity and he asked us to wait behind the rope, which we did. While waiting, we watched approximately 10 people leave, and he never gave us the go-ahead to enter. We saw someone else come out of the bar and grab some people from the restaurant and take them back with him upstairs. The doorman didn't bother to explain, he just stared at us.

I went there this past weekend for brunch and was not too impressed.  The place is weird and quirky in that it's trying to be a Manhattan-style rooftop restaurant (in a city that doesn't have them for a reason..BRRRR) and yet maintain some casual tapas charm that the Mission is known for.  \n\nOthers have mentioned the drinks here and I have to tell you that they are not good.  The main reason is that they are all served in a big highball glass with tons of ice.  So if you were hoping to have some help removing the cobwebs, forgetting about your job or making the date you are with appear better looking, good luck.  It will take a bunch of these to make a difference.  I tried a caipirhina and it is definitely not authentic (agave was used, etc.)  I know this is being picky but it IS world cup season so you would think they would get this right.\n\nOn the other hand my meal was awesome...steak cooked perfectly and the egg was, well, a good egg on a good steak.  Again - not worth the elevator ride up.  (Did I mention the elevator???  Check it out..again, quirky.)\n\nAs far as the crowd goes - again kind of odd.  Imagine a Match.com crowd where only software coders and Europeans are filtered to form matches.  You get the idea.  \n\nGo check it out yourself and maybe you will have a different opinion.  If not, there is a great bar downstairs where you can grab some liquid courage before going across the street to buy some cowboy hats and ostrich boots.\n\nC.R.", "author": "Chim R."}

Until as of late sadly :( Besides the gorgeous view, the rooftop sold chicharrones which were one of the best things I've ever had!!! I'm not even a pork lover but these were legendary, everyone I took here to try these were immediately obsessed. Then we all noticed in the past couple months that they swapped them out for carnitas, which are still good but not anywhere close to the level of the chicharrones. Everyone I know and myself have agreed not to return until they bring them back, this was their star dish, their bread and butter, what they were known for and they removed it from their menu for something less. Without a doubt I'd give them a 5 star if they brought this staple back!", "author": "Ashley H."}

That's probably why there aren't much rooftop bars in the city. I've certainly never been to any until I went to El Techo. I went there with some friends just as the sun was beginning to set. The view was enchanting -- purple orange sunset, wind whipping in your hair while the heat lamps keeping you warm. It was a Sunday and the city had never looked so beautiful and still.\n\nWe had just finished loading up on tacos and margs at Tacolicious, so we didn't get to sample the food. I wasn't really feeling the Margarita del Techo, which used mezcal. I don't really like my margaritas with the smoky flavor that mezcal has. After one order of that, I switched to the regular margarita which I loved. Margaritas make me happy. And they did it right, which made me even happier. \n\nIt was a pretty chilly night (thank heavens for those heat lamps!), so I can only imagine how awesome it would be on one of those magical evenings when the weather is perfect. I hope this place is successful and I hope it encourages others to open up more roof decks. Surveying your beloved San Francisco from on high with a delicious cocktail in your hand -- life doesn't get much better than that.", "author": "Racquel N."}

The food and drink are top notch here, and that wow, that rooftop view! It's nice to escape from the hustle and bustle of the Mission and enjoy the scenery and city skyline.\n\nBut first, getting a seat here is admittedly a bit of an ordeal, especially on a nicer day. You get in line on the sidewalk to be let into the building, then you put your name down for a table, hang out at the bar area, and hope to be eventually seated. The wait is a bit hit or miss - sometimes the line does go down the block. I will say that the few times I have been here, the wait for a table once I got inside was not too bad (they've quoted me an hour or hour and a half wait, but then I get a seat within 10 or 15 minutes). And the cocktails here are top notch and will keep you company while you wait.\n\nIn terms of the food, the guac and chips, empanadas, and fried chicken are all solid options, but it's all about the pork shoulder here. Sooo tender and juicy (and fatty), the pork shoulder is served with beans, veggies, salsa, and tortillas. I think you would be forgiven here if the only food you ordered was the pork shoulder, it's that good.", "author": "Sidney L."}

Our server was great (really great and the main reason for the 4 stars) Drinks were great. Rooftop scene was busy and great. Being in an open area kept the noise down. Food was definitely good enough - I'd say above average. Nothing complicated which is the way I like it. These things didn't disappoint.\n\nHowever, as someone who never (almost never?) writes bad reviews it's somewhat unique that I have something bad to say here. El Techo starts your experience with a feeling of \"organized dining\" by forming a line prior to getting into an elevator, *being called up by the host*, and then again when waiting for a table. Great - they have a process! All the more reason for them to expect me to ask about my friend who is waiting for me and has given his name to the host (he had) and clearly stated that I was outside in line. The host, as far as I can tell, was standing there looking at people coming off the elevator (but not inviting interaction with them!), not really doing anything much because he didn't have to - the line was outside keeping people from overwhelming him. I confirmed this throughout the night by looking over to see that he was doing nothing most of the time.\n\nHis answer to my question about my friend? \"I don't have the time to remember everyone's name here tonight\". Not sure what that was all about, but way out of line for someone who is first in line as the \"face of the company\" and with such a simple job. My friend and I continued to note that others there, \"bus boys\", were unprofessional. They seemed to have trouble understanding the simple and *very short* conversation we would initiate (where's a good place to sit? for instance). I was left wondering if perhaps there was a sign I missed stating \"Please don't speak to the help!\".\n\nAgain our server was great - very pleasant and I wish I could remember her name. The rest ... many of these are people that seem to be over-valuing their importance as \"help\" and seem to think it's appropriate to take their problems out of paying customers. It wasn't cheap, so don't act cheaply!\n\nI'll go back, but next time with the understanding that there's no point in paying any attention to anyone but the server.", "author": "John A."}

I came here for dinner this past Friday. I got here around 7:45/8pm and didn't have to wait a second to get seated (short wait may have been due to the rain). Since it was raining, the restaurant had a cover to protect us from the winter elements without totally obstructing our view of the city. Before coming I was worried that I was going to get cold, but the cover really kept in all the heat. \n\nFood: We ordered the Ceviche de Camaron, the Quesadilla de Pibil, and the One Pound of the Chicharrones de Carne. This was way too much food for two people, especially considering we both had eaten a little something before hand. We would have been fine with just the Ceviche and Half a Pound of the Chicharrones de Carne or the Ceviche and the Quesadilla. All three of the items that we ordered were delicious! My favorite was probably the ceviche. I'm not much of seafood person, but I really enjoyed this dish. The acidity was just right, and I love having larger chunks of all the ingredients in the bowl rather than having the ingredients minced.\n\nDrinks: We ordered a pitcher of Sangria and two glasses of La Paloma. The Sangria was good, but it was nice ending the meal with the La Paloma. The La Paloma is a drink comprised of tequila, grapefruit, agave, lime, and soda. It was my first time having it, and I was not disappointed!\n\nService: Our waitress was really friendly and very attentive, which are my two favorite things that a waiter can be.

Starts included a pitcher of margaritas which only added to the smiles. We sampled tapas plates of Patac\u00f3n, Ceviche de Camaron, Sopes de Pibil, and Chicharrones de Carne. Tops on our list were the ceviche and the chicharrones, which are roasted and fried chunks of pork-shoulder instead of the usual pork cracklins. We'll definitely be back for some more of those tasty treats.\n\nAs you might imagine, the rooftop setting is a quite nice option in the mission. Glass walls knock off most of the wind and clear tents come down to help even more as the night cools off. So come, bring some friends, and enjoy the view.", "author": "Norman G."}

It's a perfect combination of ingredients and flavors, and also tons of food.

SF really needs more outdoorsy places and rooftop bars for the amazing views the city has to offer. Definitely worth going around sunset time. \n\nThe rooftop is pretty awesome. Lots of heat lamps, plenty of dining space area and high tables. The menu is different from Lolinda offering cocktails, beers, tapas and desserts. Every time I take out-of-towners, they absolutely love it.\n\nI recommend to drink margarita pitchers, Variety of Latin American beers, palomas. The beers are $5 and the cocktails are $8-12. As for the food, I highly recommend the carne skewers, cicharrones, quesadilla de pibil, empanadas de carne, ceviche, guac and patacon. As for dessert, you must try the tres leches! Being from Nicaragua, I was impressed with the variety of latin fusion their menu has to offer and hope to see more the next time I go.\n\nEl Techo de Lolinda will guarantee to have a fun great crowd, a beautiful panorama view, excellent food and tasty cocktails.

I'm a sucker for rooftops where I can soak up the sometime- SF sun like a lizard. That's enough for 3 stars. While I agree with other early reviewers that it's lame that you can't order right from the bar (they should change that), and that they ask you 3498574395 questions when you get to the top, and that they are NOT set up for scale given that the elevator takes forever to go up and down, I found 4 stars in one single element. I cannot possibly go below 4 stars because I ORDERED THE CHICHARRONES BY THE POUND.\n\nNow, for those of you who think chicharrones are those fatty crackers that kind of weirdly melt in your mouth, THINK AGAIN. Chunks of fatty, meaty, delicious pork shoulder, braised, then fried, probably fried again, and then rolled in SUGAR, served with DELICIOUS black beans and tangy salsa and housemade tortillas. My heart and soul delighted from this treasure in my mouth, I couldn't care less that they still had many many details to work out. \n\nMy best suggestion is to allow it to really behave like a Latin bar... let people sit where they want, order what they wish, regardless of eat or drink... even if it means replacing some of the low tables with more bar tables. Unbutton a few buttons, put on some cumbia, and serve those chicharrones like there's no tomorrow. Make it sexy without being pretentious. It's not like you're not going to make money.\n\nBy the way, the guacamole (expensive) was delicious, as were the chips (though those could stand to be cheaper as well). Shrimp skewer= yum. Beef sandwich=skip it and get more chicharrones.", "author": "Licinia I."}

They are few and far between; for that, I must express my appreciation. \n\nHowever... I do not think I will be back here. \n\nThere was a line to get in, which wasn't a big deal; it moved quickly enough. Once we got upstairs though, things felt chaotic. First, you can't order from the bar. Which would be fine if there were enough servers to actually serve everyone, or if there were some kind of organization. But we waited for about 20 minutes with no sighting of a server. I made my way over to the forbidden bar area, found a server, and ordered a pitcher of margaritas. I headed back over to my friends, and we waited about 15 more minutes before I walked back over to the bar, and found our server again. She promised the pitcher was coming - we finally got it about 5 minutes later. I don't like to write negative reviews, but really - 40 minutes for a drink is too long.\n\nThe pitcher was rather small for $30, but it packed a punch. If there are three of you, you'll each get a small glass plus a little extra; if there are four of you, I wouldn't recommend getting the pitcher. For the same price per person, I'd recommend getting one of their cocktails.\n\nWe'd asked two or three times for someone to turn the heat lamp on, but nobody did. We weren't the only ones who were getting chilly; a couple of people came over to try and light it up. We never saw our server again, so we asked someone else (manager?) for our check. It came around 10 minutes later. The server got snappy and defensive when my friend mentioned the long wait and the lack of attention to the heat lamp.\n\nMaybe on a colder day with less of a crowd, the service wouldn't be so disorganized and neglectful. But who would want to come to a rooftop bar anyway on a cold day anyway? Most likely you'll come here when the weather is nice, so I must say - prepare for a long wait, be ready to have to hunt for your servers, and try to be patient.", "author": "Ashley M."}

Maybe some of their other drinks might taste better, but my rule is if you can't nail the margarita drink, any thing more sophisticated will probably not taste as good. \n\n2) The Food: This is a tapas place so if you want a full meal - go downstairs. The food is pretty good but its tapas - can't really mess up tapas unless you really suck at what you do. Nonetheless, if you are looking for something to munch on while you slug down some drinks, their food is relatively edible and actually delicious.\n\n3) Location: Its on a rooftop therefore by definition its incredible.\n\n4) The individuals: pretty diverse crowd and lots of room to stand and sit (but be WARNED there is usually a wait bc this is a hip spot to be)\n\nTo conclude: great place to go on a Thursday or Friday night. Food good but drinks are just ok. \n\nHave at it!", "author": "Pablo P."}

We were just up for drinks, so only got the guac and the pulled pork quesadilla, but it was amazing. A thick, hearty hand-made tortilla wrapped around a seriously obscene amount of cheese and incredibly rich, delicious porky goodness. Wow. So good.\nGreat salsa too.\n\nThe new plexiglass barriers do a lot to help keep the wind down, and there is a lot more tent coverage than there used to be also, and heat lamps, making it a more reliably inviting environment.\n\nOne thing to be aware of - about 70% of the space is table seating for the restaurant aspect, and you can't just sit down for drinks. The bar space makes up the remaining area, and is mostly standing-room only, along with a few stools. So don't expect to be able to sit unless you're planning on eating.", "author": "Don H."}

We tried it after reading the reviews and had to make it in there to make our own judgement. It was a really cool atmosphere up on a rooftop with awesome street food. We had the ceviche, shrimp skewers, salsa/chips and the chocolate dessert with cayenne pepper. It was interesting because when we first got the skewers, they smelled horrible and I did not find the smell welcoming at all. However, once I tried them, I was like \"OH MY GAW\" they were delicious. The dessert was even better. Too good to type about it, you must try it.  This place is a must. I can't wait to visit again especially during the summer.", "author": "Hector C."}

Not to mention they have valet - which I guess they have to make up for not accepting reservations =\\ \n\nI have been here a couple of times - the ambience is always great. Its good for a date or group. Even came here once before when it was Medjol. WAY BETTER now. The host downstairs is a real cool dude. When you get upstairs, you will feel like you are in a completely different place. I have been lucky enough to be seated in the middle which means constant attention from the waiter/ess. What does suck is that the tables are tiny. One time it was a little difficult for us to fit all of our food on the table for 4 people. Try the pork shoulder, the skewers are great, I enjoyed the sopa de tortilla, and the ceviche is okay. I definitely recommend you try the Arreglado. \n\nMy over all suggestion: Food 3.5-4 stars, I'm not saying that it is bad, its pretty good. But it doesn't have that extra flavor kick that Limon Restaurant packs. If you have never been El Techo or Limon, I would suggest coming here first, then trying Limon on a later day. I wish I would have done it the other way to enjoy this place just a little more.", "author": "Leonel B."}

I know some people might say it gets crowded, you cannot make a reservation, etc, etc. But I can't help it. It must be the combination of an outdoor terrace - quite unique in the indoors centered US restaurant scene - great Mexican/Latin themed menu, original space arrangement and a relaxed atmosphere. It's like instant vacation, once you're there you can feel detached from the city buzz, looking onto the rooftops and sipping one of their spicy, zesty drinks or huge prosecco glasses. Almost everything I had there was high quality and very well seasoned, though rather not for the dieting type. My preference goes to the chicharrones by weight plate, guacamole and their perfect ceviche with rounds of crunchy radish and a lot of lime. You can't go wrong with their food ($7 - $14) and drinks ($7 - $12).", "author": "Aga K."}

Today (a Wednesday) we showed up around 6:45 pm and waited for ~20 minutes for the 'drinks & appetizers' seating (as oppose to formal dinning). When you go up to the terrace on a clear day the views to downtown SF are breathtaking. Add market lights and heating lamps, and you have your perfect hang out spot. On the down side, when the plastic walls of their tent come down the noise level increases exponentially. I came to Techo for a BIRTHDAY dinner once---  horrible idea. It was so rowdy that it was impossible to carry a conversation. It felt like we were having dinner inside a club. \n\nFood: 1-star\nWith Techo being more and more popular, I could assume that their food quality would drop, but today was an extra low.\n\n- The guacamole ($7) was literally just smashed avocados. It lacked salt, tomatoes, cilantro, onions, garlic---all ingredients that I expect to get with my already marked-up guacamole. \n- The ceviche ($12) was all water. Not impressed by the dainty serving size and the lack of lemon. There were shrimp, tiny pieces of tomato, cilantro, and onion---but it needed flavor! \n- Jicama salad ($12) was just as bland as the two above. It had a salad dressing that looked promising but in the end tasted like water and avocado. Small pieces of jicama, thinly sliced radish, squares of avocado.\n- No salsa with our appetizers. How can it be a Mexican tapas place with no side of salsa to add some spice/flavor to our already bland food? \n+ The only food order that I've had on other occasions that was filling, authentic, and well-seasoned was the pibil (seasoned pork). I'd order this over any appetizer, especially after today!\n+ The drinks are handcrafted, really strong, and all together tasty. I mean, they hold the salt to the rim by using real grapefruits! \n+ Get a pitcher!!!! Individual drinks are around $12 so you are better off getting a pitcher ($21-34/pitcher) for ~ 5 people \n\n\nConclusion: Good for drinks. Skip the appetizers!!", "author": "Marissa P."}

Gerald my buddy had the Sangria. I'm not going to lie, there was nothing to it. No fruit no wine, no flavor.

Warning - during \"happy hour\" there's standing room only if you get here around 6 or later and you're not having dinner. Service is also slow in the \"happy hour\" area. (I place quotations around \"happy hour\" because they don't have one where they cut prices - it's just their normal menu with normal prices and with snacks.)\n\nUpdate: I went there again with my friends and we told the servers we wants \"drinks and snacks.\" There was only one small table available in the happy hour area, too small for our party of four. We went back to the servers and told them we would have dinner. They seated us in the open area next to the happy hour high tables (not as much of a view, but a lot more room), and gave us the same menu as the happy hour area. So, essentially, if you're going to eat something - be it guacamole and ceviche or their pork - you can tell them you're there for dinner and have a lager table.", "author": "S O."}

However, at the end of the day is the view really better than what you'd get for free from Dolores Park? The ambience here is trendy, trendy, trendy. If you're young and in the SF tech industry, you'll see a lot of your friends here!\n\nFood here is decent, with a good selection of tacos, quesadillas, kababs, and other snacks. If you're looking for a full meal to write home about, though, be sure to check out the real Lolinda restaurant downstairs. Service is somewhat slow, even for a rooftop bar. Drinks are on the pricey side ($10 for a margarita, $7 for most beers). But I guess the trendy rooftop ambience is really what you're paying for. In all, this is a great spot for groups and especially for folks who are new to the Mission or San Francisco generally. I wouldn't recommend this place to locals, though, simply because of the higher price point and slower service.", "author": "David P."}

The guacamole had quite a bit of lime juice in it, which was refreshing and wonderful -- very very very very good.  The chips were fresh made and perfect in every way -- just the right consistency and tons of flavor.  We had the matambre (fabulous steak) and the pork and vegetarian quesadillas.  They called the quesadillas \"small plates\" but wow, they were huge and DELICIOUS.  Again, full of flavor.  I love it when a restaurant focuses on flavor.

If the sun would have been out I might have rated this place higher.\n\nThe food was better than average, but it didn't blow me away. We ordered the Ceviche de Camaron, which was light and refreshing. The shrimps were cut into pretty big chunks. Personally, I prefer them in smaller pieces, so they're easier to eat on a tortilla chip, but it was still pretty good. We also got the Empanada de Alambre, but that, sadly, was a bit underwhelming. It just lacked personality, and the flavor was kind of flat. We capped off the order with the Carne, Pollo, and Chorizo skewers. The best of the bunch was the beef skewer. The meat was tender and juicy, and full of flavor. A bit on the small side, but tasty. The chicken was next. Also, tender and flavorful. The chorizo, on the other hand, had a sort of a strange flavor and was a little on the dry side. \n\nPoints for having Pacifico on tap. And like I said, if you're here on a clear, warm day, the patio will probably be awesome. I'd say it's probably only worth it on nice days.

The event was featured in sosh and a dear friend suggested we scope the venue out. With zero expectations, how can anything go wrong, right?\n\nThe venue itself, beautiful. You have a view of the Bay Bridge and the awesome fireworks show. We paid $100 for unlimited apps and drinks featured on their menu for the night. Get this, although unlimited, you really need to consider how many platters and how often they actually serve these hors devours. Same goes for the drinks. After 12:15, no server was seen in sight. You practically had to beg for a drink, come to find that the only alcohol available was champagne. I'm definitely not a fan of the brut. The flyer featured the event to go from 9PM to 1AM. Lastly, the music. God, the awful music. I've never felt so inclined to write a review because of bad music at 0342 New Years Day! DJ Just time? Just thyme? I am no DJ by all means, but I know a good DJ has the crowd dancing hard halfway into his set and all the way to closing time. A DJ should also have social skills - he should be able to look up and see what vibe the crowd is giving off when dishing out the jams. The hardest song the crowd banged its dancing feet to was Beyonce's Partition; 1 of maybe 4 mainstream songs the whole night! His favorite featured song of all time - no one knew, no one cheered, and the dancing floor crowd was consistently not dancing. And the cherry on top, he was the only DJ for the night! What?! Who booked this fool anyway? This guy was off the stage by 12:40. \n\nUtterly disappointed. No thanks El Techo. You have my $$; I'm not coming back. Lolinda itself is a different story. We were home well before 1. \n\nMake the best of 2015 Yelp world! Happy New Year!", "author": "Denise N."}

Wifey and I decided to try this place out since we wanted something different for a Friday night and was were blown away!\nFor starters, you'll enter a building and wait for an elevator like waiting for a ride at Disneyland (measles free Disneyland) ;)\nAfter taking a short ride upstairs, you'll start to hear the lively crowds like entering a award show minus the red carpet treatment\nThe wait for 2 people on a Friday night wasn't bad so getting a table was semi-quick (we went at 6:30pm) i know when we left (8pm) it was packed like sardines in a tin-can\nMy wife ordered a Margarita and I had the \"Tres Amigos\" consisting of a shot, chaser, and a beer which to me was awesome sauce! \nAfter looking at their small menu, we decided to get the following items:\n1. Ceviche - 5 stars (shrimp was fresh and acidity was on point) comes with fresh chips to dip\n2. Fried chicken thighs with sauce to dip - 5 stars (I do not know what that concoction \"crack\" sauce is, but it was \"ohmygodletmehavesomemoreplease\" sauce)\n3. Pork Chicharron - 10 stars (5 stars is the limit, but this blew our mind!) when Chicharron comes to mind, it just fried skins, but this was far from it granted it did have some fried skins, but it had pork that makes you wanna slap you mama. Man, it was good! To accompany it with fresh, hot tortillas, black beans and killer salsa, you got yourself the best taco in this open world! \n4. To top it off, we got the cookies, and hot chocolate - 5 stars (we don't often get dessert, but the food was so good we needed to try another dish) cookies was divine  and dangerous. The hot chocolate (Mexican dark) was so effin good! That dessert was perfect to cap our dinner\n\nIf we had a 3rd stomach, we would've tried everything in my opinion ;) so if you are looking to have great food + great atmosphere + great drinks + great views, this is the place to be! \n\nYOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!", "author": "Sophana T."}

Not many places have rooftop restaurants with cool views, sunshine and a vibrant mood -- not to mention the good food. This place makes me feel like I'm on vacation - colorful tiles, open air bars, cocktails by the pitcher and sunshine in the Mission. What more could you ask for!? The food is yummy -- kind of a unique Mexican inspired take on brunch. Benedicts made with jalape\u00f1o cornbread, huevos rancheros, and really good guacamole. I came away a big fan and have been back twice since. The bloody mary wasn't my fave, but the other cocktails like the Paloma and Margarita, both of which are available by pitcher, are great! There is a lot of really great food in the mission, and I don't know if I can say it is THE best, but it is really solid and the environment is unbeatable. Overall, awesome place.

We made a reservation for 1 pm and we definitely needed it. It was a beautiful day and the rooftop quickly got crowded after we sat down. As someone from out of town the view from the rooftop was awesome! A very unique experience. We were starving so we started with the ch\u00edcharron, empanadas, quesadilla de Pibil And the mango jicama salad. All were good. The ch\u00edcharron was very different than what we were thinking we could get, crispy, but not very, and they were very meaty, a pleasant surprise.  The empanadas and The quesadilla were both a bit too greasy. For my entree I ordered the techo rancheros, lolindas take on huevos rancheros and it was good, again very different. The meat was flavorful and the tortilla crispy but they used navy beans instead of black or pinto beans which I was expecting. But it was good. One complaint I had was that I saw my dish sitting out for a bit before I was served so it wasn't warm, which was disappointing. For drinks I ordered the Bersa 95; pisco, dolin blanc, pineapple, lemon, sparkling rose which was amazing!!! One of my favorite drinks over ever had not too sweet and a little tart. Highly recommended! I also got the michealada which was okay it could have been more flavorful.

There was a bit of a wait outside to get in on a Saturday night. After about 15-20 mins, we finally got in. No cover; yay I love how chill SF bars are. You take this elevator up to the \"Pent House\" area, which is essentially the rooftop bar. To the left looked like more tables/seats for a sit-down meal. To the right looked more like just the bar area; so we walked toward the right and found a table. We waited for a waiter to come and take our order. We ordered the El Techo Margarita pitcher; that stuff was strong and almost tasted like roasted chipotle pepper. It was odd and quite difficult to down for a few of us in the group.

She was very pleasant and so was the other server, though they did have the typical overworked restaurant employee vibe. The only negative part was the girl at the front door (when we arrived)seemed very \"take it or leave it\" if you will, about getting in. She said she couldnt estimate the wait, and that was frustrating. I expressed my frustration and she became extremely pleasant(great job, not easy)Once we made it to the rooftop though we understood why she was being like that at first.

It took forever just to place our order and this was at 4:00pm on Sunday, i don't want to know what it is like at prime time. So we order and we are waiting and our food arrives...great...where are the drinks? Naturally the person who delivered the food was not our waiter and had no idea where the drinks were. So we kept eating and eating, and pretty much finished the entire dish before our drinks arrived---NOT cool. At one point we couldn't even locate a server in the entire dining area. \nSecondly, how many times have you ever ordered Guacamole and ran out of chips NOT guacamole? I know, right? Never. Well we did. Very chincey on the chip portion. We didn't even bother to order more because we didn't have an hour to wait for the refill. Oh, forgot to mention, two single bathrooms, unisex with constant lines. \n\nWhen will these restaurants get it? They can make more money if they improve their service. We were planning on having 1 or more drinks and spend some time hanging out. Instead we ordered one drink each and left. I really hope the restaurant looks at this review because it has so much potential. Provide some basic customer service and stop being so chincey.

I had heard of Lolinda before but I didn't realize this was a thing. It's a brunch spot on the rooftop. It was really something I didn't expect when I was riding the elevator because my girl decided to keep the brunch spot a secret until we arrived. The place is set up like a rooftop cantina with heatlamps and tents to keep warm on cold days which it was really windy. The heat lamp helped but you needed to have a jacket the morning we went. So bring one just in case if you decide to dine here. It was sunny when I went but still windy and cold so any other day in the city will probably be foggy and cold. We ordered the beignets with dulce de leche sauce which was fried well but didn't have much powdered sugar on it. Even when dipping the sauce on it which was pretty tasty but lacked sweetness, you felt like something was missing. We then got to our entrees I ordered a egg scramble which came with potatoes on the side which were all excellent. The scramble had fresh ingredients and it all worked well together. The potatoes were cooked well and weren't burnt or too greasy. It was a great filling breakfast of eggs, sausage and veggies. My girl got the chicarones which comes in a taco kit so you make your own tacos out of them. The smallest portion was large enough for her and it would probably be good for me but you can elect to get more. It came with black beans and salsa with the meat which was fried well and tender. I also ordered a cuba libre with mexican coke which was tasty but just a rum and coke and the girl got a agua fresca pineapple which was very very good but for the amount you get, not worth the price. All in all a lovely experience because of the rooftop setting, the good food but the service could use some work.", "author": "Jeromy G."}

I am such a sucker for a rooftop bar and El Techo didn't disappoint.  We waited in line briefly while the host radioed up to see if there was space. You go down this long hallway, take the elevator up to the top floor then exit to an area with tons of tables under a clear plastic tent. It was a gorgeously warm evening when we went, but there are lots of heat lamps and tall windows to block the wind in case its cold. It took 20 minutes to get drinks, but they were delicious once we finally got them. The view is gorgeous. You are in the mission so you get a great view of downtown San Francisco.

Drinks are overpriced and weak, and if you like sangria, DO NOT waste your money on the Sangria here, it tastes worse than the sangria you can buy in a bottle at the liquor store.

I'm a poor graduate student and don't usually splurge on fancy places like this, but I decided to take my friends since I was moving soon.\n\nService was incredible! Though I was the only one in my party to arrive on the busy weekday, they sat me right next to the window with the perfect view of Downtown San Francisco while I waited for everyone to arrive. I asked the waiter questions about the food and she gave me personal recommendations based on my tastes and food allergies. The servers were prompt and gave us food as we ordered each dish throughout the night.\n\nFood was great, albeit overpriced. I tried the ceviche, the chicken skewers, fried plantain, margarita pitcher, and the cookie dessert. Every bite was delicious and I recommend them all except the plantain, which wasn't anything special. I only wonder how much of the food cost is actually going to paying for the atmosphere and view instead of the food itself. For a place that calls itself \"street food,\" it sure was several times more expensive than what you would easily find on the street.\n\nGranted, I can't complain. El Techo de Lolinda serves a certain demographic not anything like the original Mission District downstairs. If I wanted real street food, I could just walk downstairs and skip the gentrified rooftop restaurant all together. But the experience was something I won't forget.", "author": "Darryl Y."}

Luckily we arrived at about five minutes past five, when they first opened, and only had to wait twenty minutes. (Yeah, seriously. We were there five minutes after opening and had to wait twenty minutes. No joke - get here at opening.) However, I understood once we were there why there was such a long wait.\nThe rooftop has a beautiful view of the city and is a great place to take family/friends from out of town. Ambiance is casual with the deck being covered in a white tent and the tables basically being patio tables, but somehow the place still seemed sophisticated. \nThis is not your run of the mill Mexican place. You won't find chips & salsa waiting for you when you arrive. It is a tapas place, and as such, can be a little expensive, but myself and my friends all found it to be well worth the price tag. We found all the food to be quite appetizing and before we knew it we had ordered more than just \"a snack.\" My personal best was the pork shoulder tacos. My husband's was the pork quesadilla, and another's was the guacamole. We also shared a pitcher of house margaritas which was loved by the others. I personally thought they had too much lime in them (something I thought I would never say!)\nService was slow, but in a place with a view and food this good, I can overlook it.

It is worth the wait for that amazing view and the food, but I feel like unless you keep checking with the host, they eventually forget about you. And if you make your way to the bar for a drink, don't even bother thinking your party will be seated - expect to stay at the bar. I like the space heaters for cold nights but wish they occupied more of the rooftop space to accommodate more guests.", "author": "Lauren F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-24", "description": "After 5 years of being curious about the roof-top bar, I went to El Techo for lunch today.  Overall, the experience was underwhelming.  They do not take reservations so you're at the mercy of the wait list, and this is a wait list with no estimated wait times.  As a result you wait not knowing if you're likely to be there 10 minutes (all fine and dandy) or 2 hours (totally not okay).  The wait list checker would only tell people that there were only a couple of groups in front of you, thus making it seem like there wasn't really much of a wait.  However, after 45 minutes of being told that there's only a couple of parties ahead of you, you start to question this. Once on the wait list, they will text you to say that your table is ready, so after getting wise to the \"only a couple of groups ahead of you\" some people went into Laszlo to get a drink and wait it out there.  Once up to the roof top bar, things aren't much better in terms of service.  We waited 20 minutes just to get some tap water, the server then proceeded to lose the ticket with our order on, was generally unavailable when we needed something, and took 25 minutes to bring the check at the end of the meal.  The view was good, but not worth the wait and mediocre service that a lot of these excessively popular SF spots seem to be able to get away with.", "author": "Rebecca N."}

We requested 3 extra tortillas to finish off the rest of the beef. We waited 30 min then asked the waitress again. she said she would check on them. 15 min later, we still didn't have them so our friend requested them from the chef. 1 hour waiting for 3 corn tortillas, and our food was now cold. \n\nWaiting for the check was also a very timely experience.", "author": "Tyler W."}

Unfortunately, the rest of our short experience was not. \nWe were a party of 7, who arrived as 5 while our other 2 (in a separate car) looked for parking. We put our name in, went upstairs right away, and checked in with the second host upstairs. He told us to wait in the cocktail area but to not go to the bar, \"because they'll come to you.\" Okay, I understand that...it seemed to be getting a bit busy, and they didn't want to have the bar packed. Too bad that after over 20 minutes, no one ever came around.\nStill, wouldn't have minded that so much if it hadn't been for their seating policies. When the last 2 in our group arrived, they called me down to vouch that they were in our party and let them up. I went, and after going in the super slow elevator, I got down and the doorman said I had to let the host upstairs know. Okay. I went back up to let him know, and he said our 2 friends had to wait downstairs until we were all seated, and that he didn't make the rules, he just enforced them. He couldn't let more people in because he \"didn't want people to have to wait 30 minutes for a drink in the cocktail area\" Wait...wasn't that what we just did, without ever being acknowledged by anyone?\nStill, ok... I could maybe understand this, it's cool, but could he perhaps give us a ROUGH estimate of the wait time so we could let our friends know, or go down and wait with them? Nope, sorry, \"people like to camp out here, so I can't tell you at all how long it will be.\" Sooooo..... we're supposed to wait, with NO idea how long it'll be (5 minutes? 2 hours?), without our friends, in a bar area that won't serve us? No thanks. We went and found another great place to hang out on Valencia.\n\nToo bad...this place is in a great location with a nice view of the city. Poor service policies, though, means we won't return. I only gave the extra star for the view. Too bad it's not a different restaurant with this location.", "author": "Marie W."}

Long wait to get in, then an undersized table without enough chairs, heat lamps not turned on, and food that is sub par.

As a Texan I was all kinds of surprised that they did not have queso on the menu of appetizers.. After a survey of my friends that are from here, I determined queso is a Texan thing..Any who. The food is good here I would not call it authentic, but tasty mexican, spanish fusion type food I guess. The white Sangria is um yes!!  One of my qualms about this place was the absence of Happy Hour!! What kind of spanish restaurant bar doesn't have happy hour?? And then most importantly, be wary if you are coming in a party of 6 or more, be advised that they charge you 23% on top of tax and your actual bill amount. Highway robbery. We each were charged an additional $7. That's some bullcorn...They write it real cutely in tiny little baby print at the bottom of their menus...Although I enjoyed my food and if I return it will not be with a big group!! That $7 is the cost of my BART ride there ugh....", "author": "Char I."}

Food is also very good but each plate was barely a single h'ordeuvre per person at a table seating 4.  I.e. One 6\" square plate came with 4 meatballs each sized a tad smaller than a golf ball.  Flank steak was delicious but came with 1 slice of French bread...why? Seriously, we split that little 4\" x 1/2\" wide slice into 4 pcs. Ceviche was a little more generous except for 1 small carrot that just begged for someone to eat it but but no one wanted to be the only one with the carrot and nobody wanted to try and cut a 3\" carrot piece into 4 pcs.  The prawns on the kebab were not deveined..ick.  We spent $130.00 with no alcohol and left a little hungry.  The food is overall very good but the presentation for portions was chintzy and even worse, you can't have a conversation, It was like dining on an airplane runway.  Dining out for us is a social experience nit enjoyable when you have to scream at each other.", "author": "Yumm Y."}

Came here on a reccomendation from a friend who had never been but heard good things. Got there around 9, no wait for a table really. Awesome view even though it was covered due to the cold (there's heat lamps too so it's nice and warm even in the middle of december). Awesome food. We tried the ceviche, skewers, elotes, empanadas, quesadilla and of course margaritas. Everything was delicious and everybody was impressed and really liked it. We had great, fast and friendly service. Not the cheapest place but I felt everything was worth it. Somebody else complained about the pitchers being watered down and too much ice, but ours were just right and a better deal than us all ordering individual drinks. I would definitely like to come back on a beautiful summer day to soak up some sun & I really liked the margarita with grapefruit.

I also order the pork chicharrones which were more akin to what I would normally consider carnitas, but Tomayto Tomahto....THEY WERE AWESOME. I honestly cannot wait to go back to this place and try some of their other menu items. Very hip.  They do have plastic tenting and heaters for the cooler nights and, of course in SF that means 350 days out of the year.
