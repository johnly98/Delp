It is a smaller quaint restaurant with very fresh options.  \nWe ordered the chicken and pulled pork salads.  First of all the portions are immense!  Easily for 2.

Mainly because it is loaded with tender rotisserie chicken, cheese and creamy dressy.  But also because the pairing is brilliant.  The chicken is a bit rich both in terms of umami and saltiness.  The bitter kale, sweet oranges and tangy pickled onions all do a great job of offsetting that intensity.\n\nLamb Sandwich: Their rotisserie lamb is so much better than that mass produced gyro-loaf which is sold at some many pita shops.  It manages to have crisp firm exterior and medium rare interior.  Also, love the doughy pita that is so much fresher than those frisbee-like pre-made pitas from a plastic bag.

The line moved quickly and I thought the atmosphere was trendy but in a casual way. I also liked that the menu was simple, making it easy to pick something out. There's pork, chicken, lamb, and a vegetarian option for your meat. You can either get your meat in a salad or in a wrap.\n\nI chose the pork shoulder salad ($13). All my friends will tell you that I am not a salad eater at all (I know, I'm bad!), but almost everyone in the restaurant was eating the salad instead of the wrap. However, I really enjoyed my salad. The lettuce was nicely dressed without being overly soggy, and the sweetness from the tomatoes and acidity of the red onions tasted great together. The pork overall was pretty moist, though some pieces were much more lean compared to others, making the texture not always the same. I love meat, but I have to say that the ratio of meat to lettuce was off. I finished all my lettuce and toppings (including every bit of that delicious feta cheese), but I had a bunch of meat leftover. \n\nMy friend and I also ordered greek fries with a side of garlic spread and they were also good. The garlic spread was divine, and the fries were crispy and light. However, the $5 price tag did seem high to me as a non-San Franciscan. \n\nTo finish off my meal, I ordered greek yogurt soft serve with wildflower honey.

I gotta say I was a bit iffy on the price since it didn't even include any sides (+$5), but it was surprisingly filling! The pita was light and fluffy and big enough to hold all of the stuff inside. Everything including the salty feta, pickled red onions, cucumber, and cherry tomatoes all added to the flavor and great texture of the wrap. They were also pretty generous with the amount of pork shoulder that was all throughout the \"sandwich.\" The meat was mostly tender (only slightly dry), but not greasy. For a carb meal, it's surprisingly light! I'm also glad they put their take-out in a box in addition to wrapping it in paper--if I was at the park, it would definitely be nice to catch all the toppings that fall as you eat (and maybe bring a fork). \n\nOverall I was impressed by the food here!

I was able to choose what I wanted within a minute or two.\n\nIt was a weekday at night and it was pretty packed. The cashier was super friendly which instantly brightened my mood. My friend and I were waiting for a table for the longest time since most people looked like they started eating. This was around 7:30pm. We got our food before getting a table, but the employees were really nice and tried to help us find tables. Shout out to the bus boy for cleaning efficiently once I sat down in front of someone's finished/ used bowl.\n\nPork sandwich ($11) - Absolutely delicious. The pork was seasoned and cooked perfectly. It was tender yet juicy. The vegetables were fresh - cucumber was crunchy and red onions were sweet. This was hands down the best wrap I ever had at a Greek/Mediterranean place. I was amazed,\n\nFrozen Greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey ($5) -  The baklava crumbs and honey adds a nice contrast flavor with the frozen yogurt. I think the frozen yogurt would've been too plain if there wasn't any toppings. The frozen yogurt has more of a milk taste and every bite with the baklava crumbs tasted like happiness.\n\nRecommended this place to a few of my friends and some of them already tried it and loved it. Definitely will be back to try their salads next time. Until next time!", "author": "Julian Y."}

Those two factors make me want to give this spot a 5, whereas the meal itself is also somewhere around a 3.5 for me. \n\nMy main issue with the food isn't so much of a problem, but rather lack of \"wow\" factor. It's solid food that I always appreciate, but it never fully blows me out of the water. The lamb is definitely the best meat of them all. The \"sandwich\" (really just a gyro) and the salad are about the same to me - I just get whatever I'm more in the mood for. I never feel bad about myself after eating this because it feels vaguely healthy and the portion sizes are just right. I also never totally feel comfortable with the $12+ I spend on a okay meal - especially when I could've had my socks blown off at a better, cheaper place in the Mission. \n\nMeanwhile, the frozen Greek yogurt (and the ease and proximity to my apartment) keeps me coming back here again and again. I am such a huge fan of the texture and taste (was a huge Go Greek when living in LA) of frozen Greek Yogurt, and Souvla does it so well. I like it all ways that it's offered - with honey, with olive oil & salt, and with the cherry syrup. My favorite might controversially be plain, though. I find the honey gets oddly hard when in contact with the cold ice cream and there's always a little bit too much salt for my taste with the olive oil. \n\nThe atmosphere is also really nice - casual enough to hang out with almost anyone while also nice enough to impress almost anyone. You could bring parents, Tinder dates, visiting friends, and work colleagues. \n\nAnyhow, I'll be back here again and again most likely. I'm still waiting to be impressed by the food here, though.", "author": "Jenny D."}

If you're looking for a fine-fast Greek restaurant, this is your place! I usually go to the one of Hayes Valley location, but being in the Mission, the Valencia Street location was more convenient to get to. We got there around 7ish on a Saturday night, and surprisingly there was no line and even open tables! I was very surprised as the Hayes Valley location always seems crowded.\n\nI usually order the chicken or lamb salad, but decided to try the pork salad this time around. The pork salad came with minted greek yogurt, cherry tomato, picked red onion, cucmber, and feta cheese. The pork was okay. I prefer the chicken or lamb as the meat seems more tender. The sauce on the chicken salad is their special \"granch\" dressing, and the lamb has a harissa-spiked yogurt. There is plenty of meat and salad portions in both the chicken, pork, and lamb options. And if you're not a salad person, you can have it sandwich style. I would also suggest ordering their greek fries which is seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, and mizithra cheese. Their fries are delicious, seasoned so well, and also goes really well with sprinking the fries on the salad ;D \n\nI have heard their frozen greek yogurt is delicious as well, but have yet to try it.\n\nIt is very cost affordable for SF as well. And if there is a line at Souvla and you don't want to wait, take it to go and eat it elsewhere with a good drink :)", "author": "Jackie C."}

As a fan of mediterranean/greek cuisine, I can say this place tastes very authentic. Their sandwiches are some of the best I have had. Definitely come if this kind of food is up your alleyway. Your taste buds will surely thank you!!\n\nEnvironment:\nPretty cozy little spot! I like the interior of this Souvla. It does not appear that spacious from the outside, but the restaurant is pretty deep. There is seating in the back and a bar section next to the cash register. There is also some tall tables outside the restaurant itself. The restaurant is quite lively and bumpin'. We arrived around 12:30 pm on a weekday and the place was nearly packed with people already. The lines moved quickly and people dined in a efficient manner as well. The restaurant itself looks very clean and polished. It appears to be quite busy too; waiters rushing around and people roaming around to find seats. Spit-fired meats are roasting in the background of the restaurant as well. \n\n~Chicken Sandwich (5/5) ~\nNo complaints about this sandwich whatsoever! The chicken is so tender and juicy--lovely flavor! I love the navel oranges that are added as well--certainly added an additional sweet and citrusy flavor to the sandwich. Love the mizithra cheese and also the fennel. Lastly, the pita wrap is so soft and fluffy! I am getting hungry writing this review...\n\nService: \nLovely service--the cashier was so efficient and accommodating. The waiter that brought us our food was also very sweet and warm. Our food arrived very quickly. The service is seriously great here considering the large amounts of people that trickle in all the time.\n\nLast Thoughts:\nI want to try their salad bowl next time and another sandwich order. I would definitely also suggest their greek fries. They are fried perfectly and are seasoned very well. Order those fries with a side of mint yogurt sauce--it tastes super fresh and refreshing! Whether you're going veg or carnivore, the options are plenty here. Sandwiches and salads $10-14, sides $2-6, greek yogurt $3-5. Simply lovely. I will definitely be back very soon.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

Nice crunch and flavor which  is a nice change from when you sometimes get soggy lettuce and mushy tomatoes in a gyro sandwich. They were also light on the harissa sauce. \n\nThe fries were cooked greatest, good crunch, and good flavor. I got the harissa sauce on the side and it was a nice complement. \n\nThe Greek yogurt was definitely the star and why I think this place has so many 4 stars. The tartness of the yogurt goes really well with the very sweet baklava and the baklava offers a nice contrasting crunch. \n\nIf I came again, I probably would just opt for the fries and dip it in the yogurt.

I guess there's a lot of hype with this restaurant, and after visiting I'll say that I'm a believer. The food is delicious! The menu is pleasantly simple: just choose a type of meat (pork, chicken, lamb, or veg) in your choice of either a sandwich or salad. Queue up to order and pay, receive a number to bring to your table, and the waitstaff will deliver your food.\n\nI got a lamb sandwich, which comes with harissa-spiked yogurt, cucumber, radish, pickled red onion, and feta cheese wrapped in soft, warm pita bread. Add some of their hot sauce (you can be liberal, it's not that spicy) and you're set. Despite being pretty crowded, we eventually found some space at their outdoor high table. Since it was hot out, I ordered their Greek iced tea to go with my meal. Refreshing! Some friends enjoyed their Souvla Greek beer, which came in a blue glass bottle. Cool. To finish off the experience, I fell back in line after the meal to order a frozen Greek yogurt with olive oil and sea salt. It was interesting and different, something I hadn't tried before. It was quite good, but I found myself fiending for their baklava crumble and honey syrup version to really satisfy my sweet tooth. Perhaps next time, I would definitely come back again.

The frozen greek yogurt here is also delicious if you have a sweet tooth and want to try something unique.\n\nI tried the chicken pita sandwich, which was fresh and delicious. The navel orange had a really nice bright contrast to the chicken, veggies, and creamy dressing. Not to mention, the pita was warm and super fluffy. My favourite part of the meal, though, was the frozen greek yogurt with baklava topping and honey. I'm a huge fan of baklava, so that's actually what made me decide to come here in the first place. The frozen green yogurt was perfectly tangy and rich to pair with the crispy, aromatic baklava crumbles on top. Finally, the honey drizzle on top sealed the deal to complete an amazing dessert. \n\nI came for lunch on a Sunday and had no problems getting seating. I absolutely love the interior design in here: super airy and bright, modern and inviting. You order at the counter and then seat yourselves, so this is a great place for a casual meal.

There was a line for Souvla that went out the door, but it moved quickly. In addition to their delicious frozen Greek yogurt options, they've got real food too, from lamb to pork, which can be made into a wrap or a salad. The price is also not bad at all, considering you get a heaping cup of frozen yogurt for $5, when a tiny little cup from Smitten will cost the same. \n\nThe yogurt has that classic tartness but is also thick, and combined with the sweetness of honey, it's a great refreshing summer dessert. I actually didn't like the baklava crumbles that much because they made my ice cream a bit too sweet - it actually would've tasted great without any add-ons.

Garlic fries: I've been avoiding fries for dietary reasons, but they came with the salad as a meal and I couldn't resist. Wow. My fry standards are pretty damn high and these were some damn good fries. And the sauces! I got one of each and they were all bomb.\n\n4.

I can usually save half of it for the next day's lunch too, which I think justifies the $13 price tag. I'll usually share the fries with my companion(s) and dip it in the \"granch\" dressing that I order on the side from the salad, so you don't pay the ridiculous extra $1 for a few tablespoons of sauce.

Crispy on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside. My fave. (5/5)\n\nThe soup was more of a rice porridge with a lemon zing to it. I probably won't order it again. I probably would had loved it without the lemon but that's me and maybe that combination is great to others.

Swoon. \n\nWhether you're going veg or carnivore, the options are quite similar - lamb, chicken, or pork is paired with greens, a bit of yogurt sauce, something acidic (tomatoes, pickled onions), balanced with a bit more dairy (feta, mizithra), if you're sans protein, sweet potatoes add substance and walnuts are thrown in for crunch - whether you have it as a salad or roll it in a pita, it's glorious. \n\nIf you're hangry, get the wrap, making the whole thing a touch heartier - or go for a salad +  juicy potatoes (drippings, starch) to ensure maximum fully belly, though the salads solo are relatively satisfying. The \"Greek fries\", while decent, aren't anything to write Athens abt. \n\nGets wild around peak meal times. Seating limited. For the win, take it to go and stroll to Dolores for optimal people watching, returning later for the Greek fro-yo, which has to be one of the best things I've put in my mouth. Ever.

But before I could get dessert my friend and I came here for dinner, which I think was even better!\n\nYou order at the counter and a server delivers your food, as Souvla is a casual Greek eatery with table service.  I ordered the Lamb Salad and shared Greek Fries with my friend.  Our food came out very quickly, and everything looked yummy.  \n\nWhat I was most pleased with was how much kale you get in the salad!  They definitely don't skimp out on the greens, so was happy to see they have quality greens in the salad mix, as there was romaine lettuce with kale.  The lamb was also very tender and cooked to medium rare, and loved how light yet flavorful the entire salad was.  I would happily order this again.  The Greek Fries were also good, as they were extra crispy and liked that they were handcut, with much garlic and lemon flavor.  The only minor issue was that it was a tad too oily, but nonetheless - it was still good.  And though we were full after our dinner we were determined to get the Frozen Greek Yogurt with Baklava, which was incredibly flavorful.  As soon as you take a bite you're immediately hit with how lemon-y the frozen yogurt is.  The Greek yogurt was very good, and highly recommend for anyone who likes Greek yogurt since it has that same distinct sour taste.  But have to say - the baklava with, was unnecessary.  It wasn't bad yet the texture was very grain-y and I probably would've liked it better had the topping been more mixed in versus scooped on to the side of the yogurt.  Next time - I most likely would get the yogurt by itself, as it's so flavorful on its own.  \n\nService was wonderful.  Our server who was also at the register checked in with us, as we were sitting at the bar next to the front.  He also saw me put my sweatshirt on when I was there, and said that he could shut one of the doors of the entrance if I was too cold, which was such a thoughtful gesture.  They also serve Greek wine here!  If I hadn't been drinking three days straight then I totally would've ordered some booze, but glad to know it's available for next time.

I got the Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup ($5).

The yogurt has the perfect balance between tart and sweet and doesn't have much of the overly sugary \"processed\" taste that I sometimes get at lower quality froyo shops. $4-5 for a coffee-cup-sized amount of frozen Greek yogurt might seem a bit pricey, but the cup is filled to the top and the yogurt is dense! Souvla also doesn't skimp out on the baklava crumbles, because I got plenty of crunch in every bite.

The also had a long counter which I appreciate since I usually dine solo at lunch. There was a glass window to see all the meats actually roasting too.\n\nMy co-worker went on their opening yesterday and suggested coming in. Today I went with a buddy during a rainy lunch. We both ordered the lamb sandwich which is served a decent sized piece of pita bread. The meat was a mix of juicy and somewhat dry pieces of meat but there were a lot of fresh tasting condiments in the sandwich liked pickled onions, yogurt, cucumber, and radish. The pita was a little on the tough side and I have a thought on that.\n\nSo my buddy ordered right before me and to his sandwich within a couple of minutes. So I figured I'd get mine in the same time since I ordered right after him. But I had to wait a good 10 minutes until my sandwich was ready. They did apologize and said there was a huge order that came in but I believe that affected the pita since it wasn't that warm and that's why it was on the tough side. It'd must make more sense to kick out the small order before the large one.\n\nIt was a bummer because my buddy was in a rush and my order made him on the late side. Finally, it wasn't cheap. The sandwich came out to $14+ with tax I didn't get a real value here.\n\n I'll definitely give it another try and I hope I they work out the kinks from the first days of being open.", "author": "Art O."}

But the food quality was so good, I'll just chalk it up to human error and ask for a Caviar refund, no sweat.\n\nIt was all so good, I ate it all before I thought of taking any photos. But it looked very edible and neatly packaged ;-) \n\nAvgolemono Soup (Traditional Greek egg-lemon soup with rice and chicken): SO GOOD. Delicious, homey, like something my grandma would make if she was Greek rather than Scottish. $6 for bowl (about 2 cups in container). \n\nPork Sandwich (American homestead pork shoulder with minted Greek yogurt, cherry tomato, pickled red onion, cucumber, and feta cheese wrapped in fresh and warm pita bread): A bit messy to eat as the thick pita couldn't contain all the inside goodness as I unwrapped the brown paper surrounding the sandwich, but OMG DELICIOUS. Very filling. $11\n\nExtra Yogurt Sauce: I tried all of them, Harissa, Minted, Granch and Garlic. All were good, Harissa has a surprisingly strong kick for being a little container of sauce... but the Garlic was THE BEST, I added onto the Pork Sandwich for extra delicious power. $1 each\n\nFrozen Greek Yogurt with Greek Olive Oil and Flaky Sea Salt: I was going to go with the Baklava Crumbles and Syrup version but I read another review that warned it was overpoweringly sweet. This olive oil and salt version was delicious, but weird, as I kept expecting it to taste a bit sweet because of my American programming that all yogurt is sweet. This is definitely not. It's a powerful combination of natural tastes and strong, fragrant oil with crunchy salt flakes. It is not at all delicate. Some may love it. I am on the fence ;-) $4\n\nGreek Rose wine (Skouras Zoe, Peloponnese 2014): Bottle (standard 750 ml) actually 2016 vintage for anyone who cares. Very light taste and pretty color. Went well with the food but mixing with the Garlic Yogurt Sauce was a bit of a weirdo mixer in my mouth. 12.5% alcohol.

The honey was extremely thick which made it hard to eat the yogurt as the spoon would constantly get stuck to the honey.

We ordered our food, sat down, the food came, we started eating.  In every other establishment I've been to, if it's past closing time, the wait staff would clean up around the guests and say, \"No rush, take your time.\"  But not here.  The hostess informed us that we'd have to leave soon.  Mind you, we weren't just chatting and lingering.  We were working hard on chowing down our food.  Unfortunately we had to get up and leave, while my friend was still chewing, and ultimately he did not get to finish his chicken sandwich.  There were still people in the kitchen, so it's not like all the staff had left.  May I suggest, if you're going to throw the doors wide open at 10 PM when it's 50 degrees and freezing outside and be generally unwelcoming to the late eaters, that you stop taking orders at 9:30 and change the hours on your website and door?

This really helps me or anyone who is indecisive when it comes to picking what to eat. I came here on the weekend at 6 and thankfully, my friends and I grabbed the last table before it got jammed pack. \n\nThe way this restaurant works is you order at the front first and then they give you a number and you can go and find a table. So maybe have a friend grab a table first while you order if it looks kind of busy--this way you'll for sure have a table to eat later, instead of standing. I love how you can either order what you want in a \"sandwich\" (looks like a wrap) or a salad. I got the lamb salad and an order of fries, but the cool thing here is they actually have an option where you could add in some fries to the salad as an extra topping to \"make it greek\" My salad was huge that I could not finish it. My sister ordered the chicken salad, also with an order of fries, while my friends ordered a lamb salad, wrap and chicken lemon soup. The soup was not for me because it was kind of tart. But the chicken salad was amazing. Normally, I don't like fruits in a salad or sweets mixing with savory because it throws off my entire pallet, but I tried a bite of her salad with and w/o the orange slices and it definitely tasted alot better with the fruits\n\n\nThe greek style frozen yogurt with baklava is a must try! I really wanted to try the Olive oil and honey lavender as well, but I was way too full at this point to engorge into 2 froyos. This was my first time trying baklava and it was super chewy and I felt like I was eating a thanksgiving pie--which I loved!

Came in at 8pm on a Thursday night, location was not busy.\n\nFirst time visiting, we ordered a pork sandwich, lamb sandwich, fries, and a beer ($42.00 w/ tip). All disappointing, but what should have been the highlight of the meal, the roast pork and lamb, was downright awful. In fact, the meat tasted foul and old - a little worried about food poisoning, but likely just poor quality. I'd guess that they roast meat in the nice rotisserie out front then take it back and let it sit for an hour or so, chop it into cubes, and stash it in a heated food prep tray where it dries out until served. The result is dry, old-tasting meat, but maybe doesn't explain the foul taste.\n\nOn top of that, fries came out cold. Feels like all the food is kept under heat lamps for a long time or maybe timing is just really bad.\n\nThe cashier was pretty icy and a little rude but I wouldn't have noticed as much if the food made up for the attitude.\n\nMy mistake ordering the 'greek' beer, can't hold that against them.", "author": "Arjun K."}

It's called Souvla, but they don't actually have souvlaki. It's supposed to be Greek but they don't have taziki. The chicken they do serve is rotisserie but it's pulled out of its original form by the time it reaches your wrap or salad, which tasted mushy and flavorless. There's oranges in your salad, but no olives..wtf? There's some kind of aioli in your wrap but no taziki. Huh? Your chicken \"souvlaki\" wrap is really just pulled rotisserie chicken with no apparent Greek spices or flavorings aside from the fact that it's in a pita (which is very good). \n\nThe lamb \"souvlaki\" was excellent, however it is actually more of a lamb gyro wrap. So, if you're headed to this place and are in the mood for something that tastes closest to Greek and don't order the lamb wrap and fries, you *may* feel very disappointed. \n\nMy experience: I'm Greek.", "author": "C K."}

The food wasn't *bad* but it just wasn't the high quality I'm used to from Souvla. I usually believe that Souvla's prices are justified, but with my experience at the Valencia location, my food definitely wasn't worth the price I paid. I was expecting to become a regular at this location, but I don't think I'll be coming back.", "author": "Lily C."}

Also shared a half pitcher of the rose with a friend, which we enjoyed. This is a casual and busy dinner spot. The fro yo is plain flavor and then you can choose one of the toppings. I enjoyed the wildflower honey and my friend liked the olive oil sea salt. Will be back!", "author": "Elisa T."}

The lamb sandwich was awesome - the meat is super tender. Definitely get the fries with the dipping sauces. Also the potatoes in rotisserie juices were super tasty. Totally stuffed, but still had to try the frozen Greek yogurt. Best I've had - very thick and creamy, loved the one topped with baklava and honey. Delish! Highly recommend Souvla!!!", "author": "Leslie C."}

(We're in Duboce Triangle.) Regardless, it was a very satisfying experience from start to finish. I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned packaging. It's sleek and functional and makes a great first impression. More importantly, all of the food was delicious. We ordered the chicken salad, the vegetarian sandwich, the lemon chicken soup, a side salad and some pita bread. The flavors and textures in every dish were excellent. Imaginative combinations of ingredients and generous portions put Souvla way ahead of the competition. Everything tasted fresh and not at all heavy. Even the pita bread was unusually soft and tasty. We did something we rarely do and also ordered two sodas, the Greek orange soda and the Greek sour cherry soda. They were great. Not too sweet and no high fructose corn syrup. We will absolutely order from Souvla again and look forward to visiting them in person. For those considering Delivery, the food arrived a few minutes earlier than the projected time, and the driver was friendly and courteous. It was one of the smoother deliveries we've had in a long time, and we order in a lot.", "author": "F L."}

For the complainers out there, they take any and all modifications, so tell them to hold the mandarin oranges or order the lamb salad \"set up\" with chicken instead of lamb. i cannot recommend this place highly enough.", "author": "rachel b."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-23", "description": "Nice clean environment. The menu is quite straight forward with options easily laid out. Tried salad and roasted potato in meat dripping. Salad came in a bowl with substantial portion. Flavorful and really enjoyable until the last bite. The roasted potato were alright, but I did not felt the meat dripping made significant impact to the taste.(it also cost quite bit) Will probably suggest to stay with just the salad. Worth trying the place out if you are still thinking about it.", "author": "J Y."}
