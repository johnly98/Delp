They give complimentary bread upon ordering with a single square of butter hidden under their fresh loaf of bread (I wished they gave more butter, but that's just because I LOVE Butter). The restaurant is very intimate so, it's not hard to get their attention if you need service/ \n\n[The Food] - WOWZA, it was DELICIOUS\n\n-Complimentary bread: crisp and chewy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. wish they had warmed it up though. \n\n-Spaghetti and homemade meatball special (it had a fancier name but since it wasn't on the menu, I don't know what it was called..it was a verbal special): Fresh tomato sauce was on point, loaded with delectable flavor and the meatballs were juicy and mouthwatering to the bite. The noodles were cooked al dente (Which I LOVED!) Price: 17.95\n\n-Linguine Alla Carbonara (with pancetta, cream, shallots, and garlic): rich, bold flavor of cream and pancetta with undertones of the garlic and shallots. Creamy texture topped with formaggio (Parmesan cheese). Price: 16.95\n\n-Wine choice of the night: Pinot Noir by the glass. Price: 8.95\nI decided asked for my glass to be split with my significant other so that we would each have half a glass, and it was just the right amount! I'm a light weight so when restaurants serve me full glasses of wine, I usually don't finish it on my own. \n\n-Dessert: Exotic berry fruit tart: LOVED IT! Beautiful presentation and wonderful raspberry chocolate sauce to complement the creamy custard and berries of the fruit tart. Very different and unique flavors compared to what I was expecting, but that's probably why I liked it. Price: 8.95\n\nOverall, a wonderful experience filled with flavors that made my tastebuds shiver. The ambiance was romantic and at the end of our meal, they gave us complimentary moscato shots. (I'm not sure if they give that all the time or because it was my birthday, but their moscato was delicious).", "author": "Emily T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-24", "description": "We used to go to Mescolanza when it was on Clement Street.  I was a very small and intimate place with a full-on Italian wait staff.  Food was fabulous with daily specials that were subtle and tasty.\n\nA while ago we tried to go there and found they were closed - I thought that gone out of business and was sorely disappointed.  Fast forward to this Friday when, traveling back to SF, we looked for a place to eat and found they'd moved to Geary Blvd.\n\nFirst off, the new place is much larger with two dining rooms.  We were seated in the side room (early seating - about 6:30) and immediately made at home by our server.  The tables no longer had tablecloths, a step down from the old place.\n\nThe room quickly filled up so by the time our salads arrived the room was full.  In the back a very boisterous group of early 30s women (on a night out) were making so much noise that our family couldn't hear ourselves think, so I asked to be re-seated and they immediately  accommodated us\n\n3 1/2 stars for ambiance and  service.\n\nThe food, alas, had suffered from the move.  Where once it was consistently light and interesting, now it suffers from highly variable quality - in the same meal we had some delightful choices, coupled with disappointingly  ordinary and even heavy handed sauces.\n\nFor salads we ordered Insalata Mescolanza and Radicchio e Gorgonzola Salad - both were good, staple salads - the salad dressing with the Radicchio was delicious, the salad presented as a set of radicchio flower petals centered around a small bowl of the dressing and gorgonzola cheese nestled inside the petals.\n\nFor mains we went with:\nPizzetta Pere Bianche - interesting combination of mozzarella, goat cheese, pear, walnuts, prosciutto - a nice combination of savory and sweet\n\nPasta Fresca - a totally uninspired rendition of the dish\n\nRavioli Di Verdure - a lovely light olive oil and garlic sauce over hand made ravioli stuffed with artichokes - this one was scrumptious\n\nAn item off of the evenings specials - Ravioli stuffed with artichokes and fish, completely smothered with a heavy tomato and cream sauce and the occasional pea.  \n\nWe didn't stay for dessert. \n\nWe didn't get any alcoholic drinks - total tab before service was about $114 for four people.  A reasonable meal by SF standards.\n\nOverall, a few years ago I would have rated Mescolanza a 4 on the food, now they've fallen to a 3, perhaps a 2.75.\n\nIncome averaging the ambiance, service and food I'll give Mescolanza a solid 3 in their new location.  In any other city this would rate a return, but with so many places to chose from, and so little time to try them out, I doubt we'll be returning here again.\n\nA note on my rating schema\nRating system \n1) I wouldn't feed a dog I hated here\n2) I'll give it a miss\n3) Good food - I'll definitely go again\n4) Really good - I'll recommend to business colleagues and connoisseurs of this cuisine\n5) Completely worth a trip - I'd book airplane and hotels to go there again.", "author": "Andrew N."}

They accommodated the large party well and were attentive. \n\nI personally tasted 5 dishes and I thought the flavors were on for typical old-school Italian fare but there were just slight misses. The pizza was a bit thin and soggy in the middle. The linguine was a little over and soft without any bite. The salmon we had was quite nice and balanced with acid and saltiness. \n\nThe main reason for the two stars is that my wife discovered a quarter of an Oreo in her Linguine Alle Vongole. It was clearly part of an Oreo, it looked like an Oreo and my wife said it was chocolatey and sweet. We pointed it out to the server and they took it away and said they would comp us for a fresh dish (we were halfway through), which we appreciated. Then the server came out and said it was not an Oreo, but sand. It was a black clump the size of a half dollar! We told them it was an Oreo, and they insisted it was sand. Then they came back again and told us they had no idea how it got in there because there are no Oreos in the kitchen. Then they said it must have already been in the clam. THEN THEY SAID IT MUST HAVE BEEN SAND. \n\nLook, it was gross and obviously part of an Oreo. We didn't make a big fuss. We appreciated the comped dish. Just don't make excuses and don't try to insist we were wrong. It's insulting and it's better to just own the mistake and move on.", "author": "Francis C."}

My husband can be a bit short with waiters especially if he's hungry and there's an unusually long wait.  The waiter brought us a complimentary grilled eggplant appetizer and a second beer.  And then we waited another 45 minutes for the entrees.   The waiter said the kitchen was very backed up though the place now only had a few tables in use.   He knew we were not happy and he offered desserts on the house.  The food was very good, though heavy on the garlic.  Bread, salad, dinners all very good.   The desserts were excellent, even better having them for free.   We told the waiter he had turned this experience around for us....he did just the right thing.

This place sounded wonderful. \n\nAfter hearing from the wonderful older gentleman, then the nice wait-staff lady about the Osso Bucco being sold out and informed of the specials, I was delighted how nice they were! Mescolanza is one of those places whose venue was probably 15 other types of restaurants before it, but I'm used to that in SF. The venue is not special. It is very convenient. We got seated right away and felt very comfortable. \n\nI had the linguine w/ baby shrimp, fresh peas, a very light buttery sauce with fresh pasta. No wine, as it was a Tues. I also had a primavera salad (spring mix, goat cheese and a nice balsamic dressing) and minestrone soup which was great. \n\nI tell you, the food tasted wonderful and I heaped accolades to the staff on its perfection. The total for two w/ no wine came to $37. \n\nThen the not-so-fun began. I have one, exactly one criterion which I demand before I give any place more than one star: that I do not get sick. I did, we both did simultaneously within 20 minutes of finishing our food then leaving. It wasn't fun, and I stayed up all night dealing with it. \n\nI wish it didn't happen, but it did. Restaurants these days are heavily reliant on the back restaurant staff who have to touch everything. They work fast and accurately. Working fast, accurately rarely has no impact on cleanliness or hygiene, towels don't get changed, gloves don't get changed, hand-washing or using lots and lots of hot water and vigorous scrubbing goes by the wayside. Food preparers are often magicians when you are lucky to get a chance to seem them work, but they do have to go to the bathroom. One time I went to a restaurant and saw a food preparer who was wearing several pairs of gloves go in, do his thing, very quickly wash his hands, then quickly leave the bathroom w/out removing his gloves, or even the outer pair. I saw him go directly into the kitchen w/out changing at all and begin touching surfaces. That was not here. But, what I'm trying to say is I doubt if the food itself at Mescolanza had anything to do with me getting sick. I really hope to go back to Mescolanza some day, but it won't be soon.", "author": "Kevin F."}

Authentic cuisine, nicely prepared and presented.  Cozy setting, but not sleepy, and it was perfect for our table of 4.  Sevice was attentive and prompt, but we never felt rushed to clear the table.  I got the artichoke ravioli (delicious) and 2 of my kids got the clam linguine (they finished it all).  Nice size menu - not too long, but plenty of choices for different tastes (even several options of ray vegetarian daughter).", "author": "Peter F."}

They were first on Clement and now moved to Geary. Same owner, chef, and staff. My favorite dish is their pesto gnocchi. It is absolutely superb, like fluffy pillows of clouds melting in your mouth delicious!\n\nWhen they closed their Clement location, we were heartbroken. We had just gotten engaged and wanted to host our intimate reception there. So instead we had to choose a different restaurant. Then, in June 2015, I received an email saying that they will reopen in their now current location on Geary. We quickly canceled our reception at the other restaurant and spoke with Veronica and Ruben (owner and chef) to have our October wedding reception at Mescolanza. Everyone was so accommodating. We went over seating and lucky for us their new location had two rooms, one with a gorgeous backdrop of the Trevi Fountain. They even ordered white tablecloths for us and printed our menus on gorgeous stock paper. We were able to seat 20 people, had a 6 course menu, and wine and beer all within budget. My relatives, avid foodies themselves, were so impressed with the dishes, especially the salmon that was cooked to perfection.\n\nI just want to give a shoutout to all the staff. You guys are so friendly and so kind. Our server had just returned from Italy that day, and at night was busting out all the dishes for their first wedding reception.", "author": "Mel Y."}

The first few were the best, hotter than H*** and smooth as silk. As they cooled, I just felt like I was eating raw dough. I couldn't really taste the spinach, and found them much better with heaps of parmigiana cheese. \nMy wife ordered artichoke stuffed ravioli, which I stole some of, and I couldn't taste the artichoke, but the fresh garlic on it was very dominate. I preferred these to the Gnocchi, though I didn't find the pasta covering all that great - it wasn't rubbery, the texture was acceptable, but not exceptional.   Wife said Bogle Cab was ok.   \nTried the Chocolate Flan for desert. More like loose chocolate mouse. The cookie on the bottom was soggy, maybe that is the way it was suppose to be.

The owners and staff are extremely friendly and accommodating. They are pretty fast and the food is very flavorful! The only downside was that apart from wonderful service, ambiance and good food, I did not feel that they were generous. Generosity is one of the main factors for me or anyone to be going back to a restaurant. The reason I say that is ... for a party of 5 people I would at least expect a basket of bread for 5 people and not for 2 people. Also, I ordered the seafood pasta that was on the new years eve special menu, and while the pasta was quite expensive (around 29 dollars a plate) it came with clams and just 2 pieces of shrimp and scallop each. I have ordered a seafood pasta before and it was indeed filled with clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops and small octopus with a price tag a lot cheaper.

Salads were also on the small side.\n\nThe gnocchi were delightfully light and fluffy as they should be, although the red sauce was rather bland. Portion was acceptable.\n\nOne thing we noticed when we entered your restaurant was the strong overpowering sweet odor of some sort of room freshener which is not at all appropriate for where one will eat. The odors when they eat. They belong solely in the bathrooms. The sweet odor lingered during the whole time we were there, and is definitely cause for us not to return,\n\nThe restaurant is pleasantly decorated.\nService to bring out our entree was very slow. We had to wait 1/2 hour after we finished our salads for our entree`s to be served and we were one of the first customers. Certainly made us antsy.\n\nThe next thing we noticed your bill receipt which gives examples of tipping percentages. This is fine, and helpful, however, they should not be figuring the percentages for tips with tax included in the calculations.  Tip suggestions should be based on the cost of the meal only. It is rude to expect a tip on taxes. \n\nDue to the sickening sweet odor, and the slow service is the main reason for us not to return. \nThe small portions are a secondary reason.", "author": "Girly Foodie F."}

However, the space is twice as large as the last.  The food, service, the same as always.  We've been  coming here since 1987, and they have maintained their consistency all these years.  Favorites,: Veal dishes, osso bucco( get on the call list when they have it available), Linguine vongole, carbonara, pizza,  For desserts, try their Chocolate amaretto,  or hazelnut flan.  Tiramisu is just as wonderful.  \nBut a true test to a kitchens abilities is in their salad dressings.  Yum.  \nOne more suggestion.  When you go, LIE and tell them its your birthday and you will be sung a wonderful rendition of Happy Birthday by their longtime waiter.", "author": "Stephanie M."}

We asked for bread six times before they brought a one thin slice for each of us!  We were a party of 12 with a long-standing reservation.  At 8:00 p.m., the restaurant ran out of minestrone and any other soup.  It was as though they didn't expect any diners to show up.  Oh, you mean people are going to come here to EAT??  The service was dreadful, not because of the waiter, who was positively heroic, but because he appeared to be working the entire restaurant alone.  \nAgain, the food was great:  Flavorful appetizers, including truly excellent bruschetta; perfect, thin, white veal piccata; home-made pasta, red and white sauces exactly seasoned; fresh vegetables cooked just to the point of tenderness; tiramisu to die for.  \nWe are coming back to this restaurant.  We are assuming last night's problems were just a fluke - waiters called in sick, someone spilled all the soup, maybe there was a disaster.  Let's give it another chance.", "author": "Marcia P."}

It's a nice Italian restaurant with great food and comforting environment. It really takes you out of the environment in the city, and it gives the vibe of a restaurant in a rural neighborhood, with a splash of modern. We had the Gamberoni (prawns) and carbonara, with the polenta as a starter. It's what you expect when you think of quality Italian food. I took a star away because it took about 10minutes to get the menu, and we had to flag the staff down to do so. Beyond that point the service was on point. The environment was really relaxed, and patrons took their time with courses and wine. Prices are really affordable 15-20.", "author": "Elton F."}

The food has always been outstanding.  The new restaurant has the same excellent food, but is missing the ambience and warmth of the old location.  The cold blue color, no table cloths and high ceiling make for a lot of noise, the door opens and shuts or stays open as people stand there with the noise and grime of Geary coming in.  The new room is gorgeous, but the big window with no curtain makes for a lot of noise.  For people who like a loud and bustling urban cafe feeling its fine, but I preferred the intimate and quieter space of Clement street.  Curtains on the windows and to close off the door, tablecloths, and a warmer decor would make a huge difference for me.", "author": "Karen M."}

As someone who used to love the older location and considered it one of my favorite italian restaurants in SF, I've been very underwhelmed with what I've had.  From a bolognese sauce that didn't appear to have any meat in one visit, to another dish that had woefully cooked gnocci, it hasn't been great. Will try one more time, they are fairly new to this location, so it's possible they're still settling into a groove.", "author": "Geri C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-08-29", "description": "The best thing about this restaurant was how easy it was to get in at 6:30 on a Friday. I'm afraid that was the peak of our experience and from there it went downhill. The food was nothing at all special and shockingly mediocre by San Francisco Italian restaurant standards. We had the artichoke and shrimp salad to begin. The shellfish we agreed was probably canned and the lettuce was soggy and wilted. For my main I had the tortellini in cream sauce with prosciutto and peas--not an inspired choice, I admit, but surely they could have made it less insipid. My son's pizza wasn't large but he couldn't finish it, which is also amazing considering an 18-year-old's appetite. \n\nOther things that put us off: we asked if they had San Pellegrino Limonata and the waiter said yes. What he served was soda fountain lemonade with San Pellegrino sparkling water added. Also, it took forever to get our food. At one point the waiter came over and apologized for the delay, which I took as a hopeful sign, but the food still didn't arrive after that for another 20 minutes.\n\nI went to Mescolanza at their old location 15 years ago and never went back and I won't return to this one. They seem to survive, though, so I guess we just aren't their target audience.", "author": "John P."}

The reservation was accepted and confirmed.\n\nWe arrived at 7:30 pm and could see the place was busy. We were asked to wait a few minutes. Not a problem, we understood if things were running behind, but about 20-30 minutes later we could see that the tables were not going to free up anytime soon. The hostess explained that they had had a two large parties that were late or still waiting for members to arrive.  She was apologetic and polite.\n\nWe were hungry and had a young toddler with us, so we bailed on Mescolanza when we found out Bella restaurant down the street had an immediate opening. \n\nWe had been to the restaurant when it was previously located in the Outer Richmond so I am certain the food is good.

We got an antipasta platter, which was artfully presented and was decent; the salami was very good.  I ordered a gnocchi special with Italian sausage  The gnocchi was light and airy.  My companions ordered the linguini and clams (which she thought was exceptional, with a well-flavored, yet not overpowering cream sauce) and the veal (which he enjoyed).

Was very impressed with the pillowy soft gnocchi paired with the yummy cream sauce.  Ordered a pizzete and it was crunchy and tasty. Veal was tender paired with a mushroom marsala sauce that worked very well with each other, a little salty but still tasty. Also had the other veal with this white wine sauce.  This one was lighter with a hint of lemon. The chicken parm was soft and juicy, not overcooked. The special was a salmon dish that looked really good but was unable.to get to cause it was at the other side of the table. Have previously been here but at the last location on Clement.
