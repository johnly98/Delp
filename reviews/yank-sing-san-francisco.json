We ordered very similar items and mostly everything was the same. \n\nWe ordered and shared the savory vegetable, mushroom, spinach, and pea dumplings. All the dumplings are great and have great texture, but the savory vegetable one stands above all. It is full of flavor, but not too spicy. I'd recommend not dipping it with any soy sauce or mustard that they give on the side because then you might miss the flavor. I also really enjoyed the mushroom dumplings - they are not as flavorful but the mushrooms are extremely juicy and still taste great. The spinach and pea dumplings are good too, but not as tasty (although they are a bit healthier). I would recommend dipping them in a little soy sauce or mustard. We also tried the eggplant Hunan sauce and it was super tasty. Again, not a fan of eating eggplant straight up but it was really soft and tasty. The sauce was also very flavorful, but a bit too salty and oily.  For dessert, I got the egg custard tart and ate it warm (although I prefer it a little more cold because it doesn't burn your tongue) and it was great. \n\nI liked this location a little bit more, but both locations in SF are great. Would highly recommend for some dim sum, but definitely have to make a reservation.", "author": "Sampath D."}

So bummed it seems they no longer sell it! \n\nBummers:\nNo peking duck available at 2pm. Another table asked for a different option that was also sold out.\nNever were asked about anything from the dessert menu after we were done.

Our server seemed to be pulled into napkin folding duty and left us hanging to the point we needed to ask someone for our bill. The damage was $80 for us and we did not leave ready to die with fullness, but it was a solid meal. \n\nFinal verdict: I'd probably try another spot next time, but wouldn't avoid Yank Sing by any means.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-02-16", "description": "I don't understand the high ratings for this place.  Not at all.  Upon coming to San Francisco I had raked through online reviews and hit up many of my friends who live/lived in the area.  Part of the reason for this weekend getaway was to get good Chinese food (something that's slightly hard to do in LV.)  So when everyone said \"Yank Sing\" I thought to myself well, we HAVE to go there.  I wish we didn't.\n\nFirst, the service is terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  We were sat by the manager who asked if I wanted tea.  Now, usually I do but we just didn't feel like it so we said no.  He asked again and again I refused.  Then he looks straight at me and goes \"No tea?  Huh?\" in an upset voice.  I almost ordered tea just to get him away from me. \n\nThen to the carts.  Now I love cart service.  I love how the ladies try to force you to get things.  This is part of the dim sum experience and I really do appreciate it.  What I don't appreciate is that the same carts were coming to our side of the restaurant.  It would be nice if all the different carts came around so I wouldn't have to ask for stuff.  Not that I have a problem with asking, but the service isn't good so it was hard to get what we wanted.  \n\nThere was one shining grace of a dim sum lady who helped us get the items we wanted and was very friendly but she was it.\n\nService problems aside, the dim sum wasn't even that great.  Most of it was lukewarm.  The flavor wasn't spectacular for the high high prices they charge.  I mean some of the items I feel like I could get better from a box.  The only one that I truly liked was the pork bao buns and that's because it was the only non soggy hot item.  The flavor of the turnip cake was great but again, I want hot food.", "author": "Christina R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-06", "description": "I came here with my girlfriend after a long day of adventuring SF and honestly, we were disappointed in this place for a number of reasons.\n\nYank Sing is listed among the top 25 best Chinese foods in San Francisco, according to Eater SF which caught my attention. It's always packed every day when I walk out of the office to get some fresh air. As a Chinese American and self-proclaimed dim sum connoisseur, I feel a strong urge to provide my insights for the sake of my fellow foodies and other diners out there.\n\nTo be frank, the pricing is a scam from my point of view. If you look at some of the pricing of their dishes and you've been to many dim sum places, it becomes very obvious. I feel as though this place is selectively jacking up the prices on items that are popular to people who don't know how to eat dim sum. Below are a few examples that support the pricing scam of certain items. \n\n*How are 4 sesame balls and egg custard tarts, $12.70?! It's just fried dough and flour! If you go to other dim sum restaurants like Dragon Beaux, it's $3.50 for 3 pieces of sesame balls. So at most, it should be $5 something for Yank Sing's 4 pieces of sesame balls. \n\n*Wonton soup for $14?! You gotta be kidding me, bro. I'm sorry but wonton soup is very simple to make but I guess they decided to charge higher because it's something a lot of Americans are familiar with. \n\n*More dishes that are popular in the American market when it comes to Chinese food: Honey Walnut Shimp ($14.70), Potstickers ($11.70), Shanghai Porking Dumpling ($14), 1 Peking duck slider for $7 each, and the list goes on. Now let's compare it to dishes that are popular to the Chinese market, which are priced lower ($5 something), for example, the turnip cake, chicken feet, steamed spare ribs, and taro dumplings. \n\n*A tiny cut of honey baked sea bass for $21.75?! Ok buddy, I can get a plate of lobster noodles for way less at another dim sum restaurant. \n\nNow if they used higher quality ingredients, a lot more complex cooking techniques, and outstanding service then I would understand. However, after tasting some of their foods, it does not stand out compared to many Dim Sum places I've been to. Read the other yelp reviews and you will notice a trend of yelpers talk about the pricing. \n\nThere's one major thing I learned as a long-time consumer and that's, \"more expensive does not mean that the product is better\". I cannot stress that enough, especially for food. I've been to restaurants that are priced low or fair but have amazing products, and I've been to restaurants that were overpriced and the foods were terrible.\n\nIf you want to enjoy dim sum to the fullest and love your wallet, I highly recommend going elsewhere.", "author": "Victor Q."}

After we were full, we noticed the fresh steam coming out of bamboo baskets as the lids were removed. Lesson learned!\n\nAlso by eating the dim sum at not an ideal temperature, the casings had completely adhered to the paper lining of the basket. I did enjoy the crab claw skewer which is not typically found in your average dim sum restaurant. There was another seafood skewer that was also delicious and again atypical for dim sum. Wasn't wild about their shumai and felt the har gow was just ok. However, the dessert of mango pudding and coconut rolls in mochi were well prepared. This is definitely a pricier dim sum restaurant.

The potstickers are, I guarantee, better then any you have tasted before, the soup dumplings are bursting with flavor and you will not be able to get enough, and the pork buns are so yummy and delicious.

I asked about our table and when we were finally seated, a server briskly approached me to order but most of our little party of three had disappeared to wash their hands. \n\nI ordered tea and water and asked for a hot towel for my hands (didn't they used to automatically bring those to the table, a little terry cloth towel on a plate?) The server seemed surprised but returned with a moistened cloth napkin she'd poured hot water on. Uh, ok.\n\nA steam cart came but before everyone was seated. It was 10 minutes before they returned and from a full cart loaded with bamboo baskets they showed us two items and annoyed, asked us which one we wanted (\"Uh, neither.\") I politely asked, \"What else do you have?\" and she was visibly irked and showed us two more selections. \n\nI was embarrassed for the out of town friend I'd brought, raving how great Yank Sing is and how it's written up in every epicurean magazine and so good. \n\nAdditionally, trying to order vegetarian dim sum for my friend was met with puzzlement from the staff. I thought they were confused we'd taken XLB and (very mediocre) \"spicy chicken\" from the steam cart so I explained that my child and I were meat eaters but my friend was vegetarian. They walked away looking not quite satisfied with my explanation as well as a little irritated.\n\nWe'd taken the Chinese broccoli offered from the cart but the the other 3 vegetarian dishes seemed to be special ordered from the kitchen, ones that are normally circulating on the cart (pea shoot dumplings and another steamed item with spinach). \n\nI guess because my friend hesitated that both vegetarian dim sum items had mushrooms (he doesn't prefer them) but then said good-naturedly, \"That's ok, I'll order them\" an assistant manager marched  over with a server a few moments later to confront us that \"Everything vegetarian has mushrooms. Everything.\" \n\nGeez ok, we hadn't made a fuss in the first place!\n\nThere was barely a circulation of steam carts, plates were brought by hand from the kitchen to surrounding tables.\n\nThey were out of Peking duck. And shrimp with chives and something else I asked for- and I had to ask, \"Do you have anything else with shrimp?\" as she'd already walked away.\n\nAnother manager formerly attired in a handsome blue suit walked around looking stern. I didn't see him approach any table in the dining room to ask, \"How is everything?\"\n\nIt was weird. This is not the Yank Sing I knew and loved.\n\nAnd it was the first time I really minded how expensive Yank Sing is (because you know it's going to be and just pay) and I scrutinized the check ($14 for XLB?)\n\nThe indifferent to nearly hostile service seemed to infect pockets of the dining room as if a married couple were fighting, turning the frequency of a dinner party from festive to toxic.\n\nIt may be another 6 years before I return, yikes.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

I've had xlb from other places including my go to spot Joe's Shanghai and these were right up there as some of the better ones. Food was pricier than normal but in my opinion worth it since the service was great. Loved how you could order whatever you wanted from anyone, they'd talk into a mic with your order and shortly after the dish would arrive vs at other restaurants you'd have to wait for the cart to wheel itself around.

I came here with a group of 14 people with a reservation from 1 week in advance. Within a few minutes of arriving, we were brought to our table in the outside seating area. We thought it was going to be a bit chilly sitting outdoors but there were heat lamps that kept us warm enough to not complain.\n\nAs we were still taking our seats, the servers immediately started rolling their food carts soliciting their food from one side of the table to the other. We said yes to about half of the food that kept on rolling by: shanghai pork soup dumplings, pot stickers, fried shrimp balls, snow peas, Peking duck, BBQ pork buns (steamed and baked), chicken satay skewers, chicken stuffed mushrooms, fried scallop balls, chicken feet, and last but not least, egg tarts. I'm probably forgetting to name some other dishes that we had ordered, too. This was all in a span of just 1 hour.\n\nOverall, this restaurant serves tasty Americanized Chinese food and it is located in a convenient location in the Financial District.

Interior is pretty posh and clean.  Service is usually ok if you can avoid the rush hour but note that the later you go, the less items they'll have to choose from- around 1pm, they ran out of Peking duck and some of the typical steamed items were low on stock.  They also have servers walking around with new dishes and will show them to each table to see if anyone wants it.  Note that this place does get REALLY LOUD.\n\nUsually go in a group of at least three and try to order a lot of variety: we usually end up ordering the shrimp har gao (4 for $6.50), pork and shrimp shumai (4 for $6.50), spinach dumpling (3 for $5.50), pork cha shi bao (2 for $5.25), Shanghai soup dumpling / xiaolongbao (6 for $12.95), Peking duck (1 piece with bun, sauce, and scallions for $6.05), and Chinese broccoli (plate for $6.50; note that this dish is COLD).  Sometimes you can ask for things like shrimp changfen (not sure what price is for this).  Dessert we usually get the fried sesame balls (4 for $11.10).  \n\nAs you can see, the prices can be a bit high for the amount you get.  I don't hate the food either- it's just not as special as some other places I've been to (but maybe I'm just spoiled).  \n\nIf my friends want to eat dim sum, I'd come back; I'd just have to mentally prepare myself for a higher-than-normal bill.", "author": "Audrey H."}

The restaurant itself is very nicely furnished, well-lit and fairly spacious. So no need to worry if you have a big group.\n\nMy only complaint is about the price. It seemed like a rip-off to pay that much money for the amount of food we got. Maybe this is due to the location (in all fairness, SOMA/FiDi land is pretty expensive), I cannot say, but please be warned about it.", "author": "Angel C."}

This place is located right adjacent to the financial district in a really clean and classy spot that's not too busy on a given weekend. It's bustling and there's a great crowd that comes in - and the dim sum carts seem to build your appetite as you're waiting to be seated. Once seated, the service is really great and the carts come around fairly often, but I sadly wasn't impressed by the quality of the food - from the sea bass to the xiao long bao, I didn't think the price justified the food. Honestly, when I got the check the first time after ordering everything a la carte, I was surprised, and not in a good way. It came out to $80/person for just enough food for 3 people. I think that I would definitely be happy to add this place to my list of go-to's if the price was half of what they charge. In the meantime, I'm happy to keep hunting for my next Sunday dim sum spot!", "author": "Marites S."}

The restaurant and overall experience exceeded my expectations. Yes, it was expensive at $200 for three people, but overall, the food was delicious and well worth the high price tag. I'd say it deserves the ranking as the best spot in San Francisco for Dim Sum. It was extremely crowded at lunch time, and we were glad we had a reservation. I wouldn't recommend going without a reservation unless you are prepared to wait.\n\nWe had 14 different dishes that came out rapid fire. My advice would be to pace yourself, and don't feel you have to order or eat everything that's presented to you, as more than likely, the item will be offered again a little later.\n\nSome of the better Dim sum items included the Shrimp dumpling, the mushroom dumpling and the spinach dumpling. We really enjoyed the Honey baked Seabass, it was probably my favorite dish. The Peking Duck bun was disappointing as the skin came off the duck, the bun was doughy and the duck was unremarkable. The Minced Chicken Lettuce Cup was equally as good as others I've had elsewhere. We ordered a vegetable dumpling that was yellowish in color that wasn't that great. Everything was hot and cooked well. \n\nMy niece had to try the Orange mellow and mango pudding for dessert, and both were a hit.", "author": "Emily C."}

Highly recommend as long as you're okay with the price.\n\nIt's quite interesting how inauthentic yet authentic Yank Sing is. The inauthenticity comes from the lack of many traditional dim sum dishes like cheung fun (rice rolls) for example whilst offering many non-traditional dim sum dishes like black cod or crab claw. Given that, you would expect their traditional dim sum dishes to taste very inauthentic, non-traditional, westernized BUT that is most definitely not the case. Their traditional dishes are SO authentic and taste so similar to how they do in asia! They're definitely the best in the area.\n\nI highly recommend their soup dumplings, lotus leaf sticky rice, shrimp dumpling, bbq pork bun, egg custard bun, shu mai. If you like hot sauce, try theirs - it's to die for!!\n\n-1 star for the crazy prices (2x the price of typical dim sum dishes), insanely long wait (they told us it'd be 1 hour and we waited for 2.5 hours), the mediocre service (not very attentive)...however, despite all this, I'll definitely keep coming here.

One person at our table even stated that he could eat it by itself--it's that delicious.\n\nThe pricing is a little out of control.... $16 for 6 Shanghai dumplings, $11 for a plate of potstickers, 1 peking duck bun is $6, 4 small pieces of jian dui are $11, and a small bowl of mango custard will run you $5.50. Traditionally, I'm used to rice and tea included in the meal but here it is a la carte, and adds to the final bill.

It ended up being a 1.5 hour wait but the food made it (mostly) worth. If you're going to walk in, you give them your phone number and they'll take you when your table is ready. They'll hold your reservation for 10 minutes so don't wander too far away. Another option is their take out store. It's on the side of their main store and its called Yank Sing 2 and it's only for take out.\n\nMost of their store is inside but during busy times, they'll seat you outside. If the weather is good, sitting outside is quite nice but when it's cold the heated lamps just don't keep you warm enough especially if the wind is blowing. If you come here during the winter and don't mind the wait, ask to get a seat inside.\n\nFor the food, this is pretty expensive dimsum. You're looking at $6-$10 per dish. Most dishes come with 2-4 pieces depending on what you order. For 2 people, we spent about $40 each whereas you can get just as much food in Chinatown dimsum places for less than half the price. Honestly though, I was pretty impressed by the taste, it definitely felt authentic. \n\nMust haves:\n- Shanghai Dumplings (their signature dish, very very tasty)\n- Egg Custard Buns\n- Mandarin Dumpings with Chives\n\nIf you're looking for cheaper dimsum, head up to Chinatown area.

Hot tea is not standard and you have to order (pay) for it. They bring the dim sum out by carts and you order what you like. I judge my dim sum by the standard of their ha gow (shrimp dumpling). There was a lot of shrimp in it but the taste was just ok for me. I prefer the skin to be more translucent. The rest of the dishes were good but not amazing. I did love the egg tarts, which was made to order (I think) and it was piping hot. Service was better than most dim sum restaurants. Prices are VERY steep.

Everything was perfectly authentic and I was pleasantly surprised that they did individual servings of Peking Duck with buns and Chicken Lettuce Wraps. I have never been to a dim sum place that does this and it really solidified my enjoyment of this restaurant. I think there was also a special set menu for Chinese New Year because one of the ladies pushing the dessert cart told me that the Milk Tea Pudding was part of the set menu. Upon seeing how sad I was about that, she still let me order a serving of it. The pudding was very creamy and the milk tea taste was strong and authentic. It was really nice of her to allow me to order it and I enjoyed it immensely. \n\nThis restaurant is definitely more on the pricey side though; for two people, it came out to be around $100! We each paid around $60, including tip.

We wanted a cheap and easy place to eat (but didn't want fast food), and quickly realized in the area we were in that was going to be unlikely. We stopped in here just intending to get an order of dumplings to go, but the waitress didn't really acknowledge that was an option and ushered us to a sit down table. Because it was raining, we accepted this fate. After giving le fiance a stern, we are only ordering two orders of dumplings look, we went for it. \n\nWe got an order of the soup dumplings and the siu mai. Both were delicious!! I saw some other reviews that they weren't hot enough but ours were fine. Super flavorful. You really have to watch them though, I saw them pushing their most expensive items multiple times (like that $17 sea bass). That didn't sit well with me - I like being able to relax when I eat, not be on guard that I'm going to be massively overcharged. Maybe people in the Financial District don't care.

But for the situation we found ourselves in, this place definitely hit the spot.", "author": "Courtney C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-14", "description": "This review is for the smaller of the two Yank Sings located just behind Market.\n\nThis experience has taught me one crucial fact about dim sum: it is best to brave the lines for an *earlier* experience rather than later. When the No1DP and I finally got settled in our tables at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon, there was only a limited selection of dim sum on the carts and it was best to pick off the menu, and even then it wasn't guaranteed that the restaurant would have the item. This is how I missed the baked BBQ pork bun; it was sold out at noon (restaurant opens at 11am).\n\nVENUE/SERVICE: White cloth fancy schmancy dim sum, a step up from the usual setting you would find in SF Chinatown and/or the Chinese communities in LA. Although the lady taking reservations took our names and phone numbers so that she could text us when a table would be ready, we never got a text. When we came back 30 minutes later per estimate she gave our spot away to another party. Luckily when we returned we were seated 5-10 minutes later.\n\nService was still on the busy side though customers stopped trickling after we were seated. At least they told us right away that they were out of an item immediately after asking about said item. They were also nice enough to hold onto a custard tart for me to eat later.\n\nTea served was jasmine tea served in a fancy kettle. Gotta look the part if you're serving fancy dim sum.\n\nDIM SUM: In general, mostly average and like many people have mentioned, you can get the same quality for lower prices elsewhere. \n\nMuch of the steamed items were available on the carts. Their signature dim sum is their \"Shanghai Dumpling\", which consists of their kurobota pork and is in the style of a xiao long bao. I had XLB before in NYC and SoCal and thought that their rendition was honestly forgettable, as was their scallop shu mai, which didn't contain much scallop. Their har gow tastes much like any other decent har gow. What stood out was the mushroom dumpling and the seafood basil dumpling due to their intense flavors in a small dim sum.\n\nThe only fried item we had was a Phoenix Tailed Shrimp. LOTS of bread filling but shrimp was scant. Not even the sweet and sour sauce can save this dish.\n\nMy two favorite dim sums were the desserts, the sesame balls and custard tarts. Sesame balls used yellow bean as opposed to red bean yet still tasted the same as red bean. The balls were cooked just right - light and crispy skin yet glutinous and piping hot on the inside that you need to slice the ball in half to eat it right. Custard tarts were served in flaky pastry shells and a little more eggy than creamy yet still delicious. \n\nThe next time I take the No1DP to dim sum it will be at a more price-appropriate establishment. At least this experience satiated my dim sum craving. If I were to ask Michael Bauer one question it would be how did this restaurant manage to stay on his list for so long contrary to public opinion?", "author": "Isabella B."}

I know the standard fare at most places. Yank Sing didn't offer much that was out of the normal scope with the exclusion of their soup dumplings. \n\nMy family and I went during the week and hit the afternoon lunch session. Service was good, our tea was always full and our water glasses were replenished mostly within decent timing. \n\nFood was good, don't get me wrong, just not $45/person good. Sorry. \n\nWe ordered 12 items between 4 people:\nCrab puffs (2)\nSoup dumplings\nTaro cake\nSaut\u00e9ed edamame \nEgg custard cups\nSteamed pork buns\nShrimp and chive dumplings\nSticky rice\nSesame balls (lotus)\nEgg washed pork buns\nCan't remember the last item\n\nOverall all items were good but nothing so exceptional to warrant the price tag. The egg custards were served warm which made them gooey and luscious in texture. The sesame balls were also warm and if you've never had a warm sesame ball you should fix that problem pronto. \n\nThey still do the carts which is rare these days and a treat to be able to see your items rather than ordering off a menu. They also walk around with some of their speciality dishes but none of which tickled our fancy. \n\nIt's doubtful I'll be rushing back with the plethora of delicious dim sum in the area at any price point lower than this and equally delicious food.", "author": "Mandy L."}

Now this dim sum spot is not in Chinatown just a little further away. We got seats right away before a big lined formed, now I wasn't disappointed in the food but the prices about 100 bucks for me and my wife WOW. I could get the same dim sum in the Chi for half that price with the same service. But the dim sum overall pretty good only thing that wasn't all that were the shui mai no caviar on top pretty average I've had much better. All the spring rolls I had were spot on the shrimp and taro. The fried prawns might've been my favorite thing there bomb, along with the Peking duck served with the traditional white buns and hoisen sauce on the side with carrots very good. Tea wasn't cheap good brand went well with the dim sum. Can't forget the soup dumplings I had there awesome one of my favorite dumplings anywhere they did a damn good job on those here. Overall nice place service was good too and it was very clean and lots of space. But the prices, I never think dim sum should ever be that expensive.

I can't speak to the authenticity of anything they serve, but I can say that I've eaten here 20 or so times in the last 5 years and the food is tasty and high-quality every single time. Their claim to fame is their soup dumplings, but all their dumplings are really quite good. Personal favorites are the shrimp dumpling and the pea shoot dumpling. (They have more and better vegetarian dumplings here than the other dumpling places I've tried in the city. There's a mixed veggie dumpling - but also a pea shoot, a mushroom, a spinach, and a curried veggie dumpling.) Other personal favorites include the honey walnut shrimp, chicken spring rolls, and mango pudding.\n\nThey also have a location at Rincon Center, but I prefer the Stevenson Street location. Rincon is a bigger space (especially when they put tables in the atrium) and you can usually get a table even on a busy weekend. That said, it feels pretty busy and the reservations don't usually seat on time. Food quality is the same though. \n\nOne con about both locations: If you get a seat that's outside the regular path of the carts, sometimes you have to get assertive about your dumplings.

I enter skeptically pondering what mega burrito joint I can hit up afterward for the \"full feeling\" factor, but leave clutching my distended paunch, swearing off all edible items.  How does this happen?!  One of the little mysteries of the universe, I suppose.\n\nAnywho, I was scheduled to meet up with my good friend, Jacque C., at around noon today.  I got there a little earlier and ended up in the line for Yank Sing 2... which is definitely not supposed to be confused with Yank Sing.  The former is their no frills takeout operation; the latter is for those who've got some time to sit and savor.\n\nAfter reorienting myself in the proper line, I was able to get seated right away.  Score!\n\nWithin moments of setting my stuff down, a waitress came by and asked me what I would like to drink.  I asked for chysanthemum tea (my favorite!), and she brought back a beautiful, large, clear glass teapot with the flowers sitting pretty in the central infuser.  Most places throw them into those metal teapots, so I really appreciate this elegant touch.\n\nThe plates, on the other hand, were pretty badly scuffed up.  Quality control seems a wee bit lax in that area.\n\nWhen Jacque arrived, we quickly filled our table for two with the following:\n\n2. Shrimp Dumplings/Har Gao (4) - 6.50\n6. Pork & Shrimp Siu Mye (4) - 6.50\n9. Shanghai Kurobata Pork Dumpling/Xiaolongbao (6) - 12.95\n33. Honey Walnut Prawns (6) - 12.15 \n\nI'll admit that I have a bias against frou frou/shi shi places, and I came into this dining experience ready to dislike Yank Sing because that's the vibe I perceived it to have... but the dim sum is pretty good and every waiter and waitress we encountered was very pleasant and attentive.  Yes, it's pricier than most other dim sum places, but let's think about the kind of rent they're paying for the spot they've got out here in the Financial District.  Yup.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't be against coming here again, even though I like to save dim sum for the weekends when I have time to stuff myself and really catch up with friends.\n\nBefore Jacque and I left, we noted that pineapple buns might be a good addition to their dessert menu.

When we walked up there was a long line to the front counter, which composed of people putting their name in, and people who had reservations. I feel like things would have been more efficient if reservation people didn't have to wait in a long line.\n\n3 things we ordered off the carts, 1 thing we ordered off the menu. From the carts we had the xiao long bao, pork potstickers, and bbq pork bun. Potstickers had good flavor, but were pretty cold. Not just sitting out for a bit, but on the cold side of room temperature. Still enjoyable but tasted like something off a buffet where the heat lamps were off and the door is open with cold air blowing in. In fact, that was happening with the front door here, and our seats were nowhere near the closest to the door, and we were still catching the occasional chill. Maybe the carts were catching it too.\n\nXiao long bao was fine, but was looking forward to something more special with all the raving reviews. It was also not steaming with hotness, which is one of the best parts about soup dumplings. Bbq pork bun was decent, also very middle of the road/standard flavors.\n\nThe shrimp dumplings we ordered off of the menu took FOREVER. We reminded them FIVE times that we had ordered shrimp dumplings, and we were ready to just pay when they finally brought them out. Shrimp seemed of high quality, but one of mine had a really hard gritty piece when I bit into it. You never want that moment when you bite into seafood/meat.\n\nAnd when we got our check (after asking twice), took them a while to pick up our CCs, and then they disappeared for 10 minutes. What?!

When they served us tea after it was nearly finished though, they just added hot water to the same teapot. As you can imagine, the tea was not so great the second time around.\n\nMy favorite here was the Signature Shanghai Dumpling. It's one of those soup dumplings they serve with vinegar and ginger.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-02", "description": "Yank Sing is the most un-Chinesey Chinese restaurant I've been to. Let me tell you why:\n\n(1) Civility. I don't have to get all savage status and clothesline people to get to the hostess stand or to the table. Didn't see any tables brawling to pay the bill either; probably because they didn't want to get stuck with a $100-$300 bill. \"Oh you got this? Why, thank you!\" *evil laugh inside*\n\n(2) They take reservations for dim sum. Don't come without one especially on the weekends and holidays. It was as packed as Koi Palace and Hong Kong Lounge on New Year's Day.\n\nFyi, don't think you're hot shit just because you're one of the few that can spit some canto there. It's not going to get you a table any faster. Trust me, I tried. Fail.\n\n(3) It's ridiculously expensive: $4 pp for tea...nearly $3 for a mini dan taat...$6 for one slice of duck?!?! *grabs ankles*\n\n(4) \"Omg, did the waiter just say, \"thank you\" and \"you're welcome\"? *gasp*\n\nCustomer service IS excellent at Yank Sing; a close second to the bougie Hakkasan. The entire staff is polite, efficient, attentive, and speak conversational English. Oh yah, and they actually smile.\n\n(5) Limited variety of Americanized dim sum items on the cart (no cheong fun--boo!) but high quality ingredients and minimal to no MSG used. I had no MSG after effects like I usually do with most Chinese restaurants. If you don't see an item you want on the cart, ask your waiter and they'll cook it to order for you.\n\nOnce you get over the culture shock of how un-Chinesey Yank Sing is, prepare yourself for some solid, high-quality yum cha grubbing. \n\nWe ordered 10 dishes for two people which was a lot but in true Yelp fashion, we always over order when we yum cha: http://bit.ly/1eY8QZm. Expect to spend about $50 pp before tip; the same amount that can feed an entire family of 4 including tip at other dim sum places.\n\nMUST ORDERS:\n*XLB (Shanghai Soup Dumplings - $12.95): The best? Nope, but pretty damn good with a thin skin, succulent filling and tons of broth. It's a step below \"world renowned\" Din Tai Fung's XLB.\n*Siu Mai (Shrimp & Pork Dumplings - $6.50): Super juicy and topped with a whole shrimp.\n*Pai Gwaat (Steamed Spareribs - $5.25): All meat and barely any bones.\n*Honey Baked Seabass ($19.95): Silky, flaky, savory sweet goodness. Worth the price tag over the Peking Duck.\n*Dan Taat (Egg Custard Tarts - $11.10): Umm, herro thunder thighs and muffin tops! Served hot, the crust is buttery and flaky crust with an uber velvety custard. When fresh out of the oven, it rivals Golden Gate Bakery's dan taats.\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of their steamed dumplings as they have the skin down to an art; perfect pleating, thickness (not too thick), and elasticity (didn't fall apart upon picking up). \n\nMake sure to use their housemade chili oil sauce and hot mustard for dipping. SO bomb!\n\nSkip the $6.05 a slice Peking Duck (skin wasn't crispy) and anything fried (they're known for their Wu Gok: taro dumpling though which was sold out). Their Fung Zhao: chicken feet was mediocre so I would also skip this next time.\n\nDon't bother with their takeout either. I use to regularly get their combo meals when I worked nearby. It sucks and the quality is not on par with what's served at the sit down dining area.\n\nI hear their Rincon Center location is even better. More spacious; fits 500+ people. More dim sum variety. Free validated parking.\n\nMe: \"Can you we go to Yank Sing at the Rincon Center next month?\"\nMr. NSS: \"The place where rich people have their fancy wedding banquets at?\"\n\nMe: \"Yup!\"\nMr. NSS: *grabs ankles*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Got the marquee Shanghai xlb (twice), shrimp crab claws, pan fried-turnip cake bbq pork buns, hargow (shrimp dumplings).\n\nThe food was authentic enough. Xlb had the requisite soup so you have to delicately pick up and display your chopstick skills to lift without tearing the skin. The shrimp crab claws use authentic crab. The turnip cake was \"meaty\" with materials (other places give more white turnip rather than mushroom, meat, dried shrimp, etc.). Finally, BBQ pork buns seem to use genuine char siu (not the leftover and not fatty). Hargow was okay.\n\nI seem to be saying the food is great. So why the 2 stars?\nWell, selection is pretty light. Regular items I expect were either unavailable, always out or delayed such as leaf-wrapped sticky rice, black pepper pork, chicken feet, tripe, and shrimp/beef/char siu wrapped rice noodles.  I think it is more the \"unavailable\" as I did not see any carts that carried 'em.\n\nThis place is definitely for folks who dip into dim sum but want a genteel atmosphere. As listed above, I listed some of the standard dimsum fare that were unavailable. And, I mean, they were serving mimosas with dim sum?!?! That's a new one for me. Whatever happened to tea (FYI, tea is suppose to help wash that all that good greasy dim sum stuff).\n\nI guess it is fine for business lunch--you wouldn't want yourself or your client spitting out bones from chicken feet, or unwrapping the sticky rice.\n\nThe service and the fees were what dropped it from 3 to 2. \n* Service was sloooow...we requested some standard fare (sticky rice) and it is \"getting ready.\" Arent' you ready for lunch crowds? Service was slow (yes I said it again). We had to wait 1/2 hour while we noticed there were four or five empty tables. Eventually they did use it (especially the one I noted was empty and talked internally...why aren't they using it).   Are they just trying to create a sense of busy-ness? It is !@#$$ cold to wait outside instead of being seated when there are empty tables!?!\n* Fees. The XLB was $16 a tray. Whoa. It is good but not THAT good. I've had better on Peninsular/South Bay that were less than half the price. Similarly, the real crab claws with fried shrimp priced the same (May be worth it since it uses real crab claws and crab meat, but I don't have a basis to value it..There were only 2 pieces too).  Perhaps it is the rent....\n\nIn any case, if you have business lunch and want to feel international, this may pass , as the few items that are made are really well. but expect long waits. Otherwise, take the trek to Chinatown (only about 3/4 mile) to build up your appetite and get more selection, faster service (note I didn't say faster, not better---you ARE dealing with real Chinese employees after all, so it's a free cultural experience), and a cheaper tab. (I forget but there is one I usually frequent that even FPOTUS Obama had eaten....Great Eastern was the name?)\n\nBut if you are into mimosas with dim sum, stick to this place....", "author": "Sonny W."}

The restaurant can be considered to be \"best-in-its-class,\" that is, a genuine gourmet restaurant.  The restaurant is typically packed in the mid-day hours, but the first time we had a reservation and the wait was only about 15 minutes.  The second time when I was alone the wait was only a minute or so.  Both times, I ordered a plate of shrimp and a plate of crab.  The breaded coatings on the shrimp and on the crab were very even, and the tawny color was pretty.  The meal was delicious.  \n\nOn my second trip, I also had an \"egg roll\" dish.  This is a fried cylindrical won ton with who knows what inside.  The server cuts the egg rolls in half with shears right in front of you, and the coating makes a crunchy sound when cut.   Although the egg roll might have been the best of all egg rolls, and although it might have represented the very pinnacle of centuries of refinement in the technology of gourmet egg roll-making, and although it might have been the \"Mother-Of-All-Egg-Rolls,\" it did not make an appealing part of my meal, since it really seemed no different from egg rolls from an ordinary neighborhood Chinese restaurant.\n\nDuring my first visit, my sister picked up the tab.

I find myself in a time pinch a lot and am surprised that this Yank Sing is not more of a default choice for me. After all, you have the buzz-saw line where you are met with the intentionally brusque staff dressed uniformly in their starched white shirts, their scarves peeking out from their collars, their drab brown aprons and their poker-dealer hats. This is definitely not the hippy-dippy staff at Peet's where they ask you how your weekend was or what your birth sign is. No, tell them what you want and just step aside.\n\nThat's it. Maybe it's the lack of love that makes me forget about this place since I could get yelled at on Muni or at work during a rough one-on-one.

A large version at $6.60 can be just as satisfying when I'm feeling really famished or depressed, take your pick.  Oh sure, I've had the dim sum of which Yank Sing is justly renowned, but those are bit too calorific for me these days.

When I was seated, a waiter asked me if I would like to order soda.  With dim sum?!  No, please, I'd like to get tea (which is usually complimentary at the yumcha places I frequent).\n\nAlas, tea here was almost $8.  Granted, the teapot was very cool and the tea was fragrant...but again, no.  I cannot justify spending this much for tea unless the leaves were picked from the heavens and brewed in angel tears.  And even then, I still don't think I'd pay that much for it.\n\nAs for the food...it was mostly good but NOT worth the price.  Highlights included the lettuce wraps with minced pork and the mango pudding.  But everything else was mediocre (not bad by any means, but not incredible either).  The absolute most disappointing thing was the xiaolongbao (soup dumplings with pork).  Anyone who says they're good is just...deprived.  Good xlb does not taste like YK's. I picked one up and the skin immediately broke.  Not well made.  Meat wasn't that juicy, skin wasn't thin and chewy.  There are so many other places in SF and in the East Bay that have way better xlb that charge less than half the price, so why would you eat them here?  Like another reviewer pointed out...if I'm going to be paying *this* much for dim sum, it better be the best San Francisco has to offer.  That is not the case here.\n\nI will say this, though: Yank Sing has excellent service, quite possibly the best I've ever experienced at a Chinese restaurant. I called the day before to make a reservation and was worried they wouldn't honor them (because, after all, it's a Chinese restaurant), but they did, and our table was ready before the expected time.

We sat down on the heated patio and not even a minute later, a server with a tray full of dim sum came by. Vegetarian options, baos, fried shrimp... It all looked very yummy! \n\nI had the snow pea & shrimp dumplings, hubby had pork bao, pekin duck and pork dumplings he loved. We finished by Lotus Seed buns and coconut rolls/balls. Super fresh and good.\n\nThe dumplings' price is around $7 for 2 to 4 pieces except the pork ones which are around $14 (and the duck), so the bill can easily get pricey. We actually looked at the menu AFTER ordering off the tray.

Because it was really good dim sum catered for Americans, and I can't give three stars to a place that left me satisfied (but I CAN deny it a five).\n\nI will say this...if you pay for it, you get the highest quality stuff.  The xiao long bao were quite good...not quite Din Tai Fung good, but good.  It's hard to screw up the old standbys of har gow and shu mai, and with the fresh ingredients that was never going to be an issue here.  Peking duck, turnip cake, sea bass were also pretty good.  Had some other stuff too that I have no idea of the name, but it was good.\n\nThe service was pretty good, very attentive waiters.  And I can't complain with the interior of the place, it was clean and very comfortable to enjoy some dim sum.

The only disappointment, it had a glue-to-your-teeth texture and not sure what the filling was but unimpressive. Then came steamed dumplings. Pork buns huge and you had to get two. I was getting full by this point, so got the smaller chicken/mushroom dumpling, also good. \n\nMy one criticism is that the timing of carts is inconsistent. When I first arrived they were wheeling carts constantly, then they slowed. I waited quite a time for steamed dumpling and then, when I figured I was done except for dessert, took a full 15 minutes and asking two people before they brought the dessert cart. It had been around several times earlier, but then disappeared. They did not have the egg custard tart, so I got the coconut cream cake, sort of spongy cake with filling. Not bad, not spectacular. \n\nBummer - they did not bring around the Peking duck until I'd had five things and was quite full. I had a sad since duck is one of my favorite things.

You really have to pace the food, because they will keep your table full and feed you quick if you let them.

So are the pork soup dumplings and the lotus leaf. You are a fool to not get the aforementioned items.\n\nNot a huge fan of the scallop dumpling as it is really dense and a lot to handle.

Between the vegetable dumplings and turnip cakes, my favorites were the spinach and the mushroom dumplings. \n\nDon't leave without dessert. The coconut roll is out of this world. Glutinous rice flour, slightly sweet, shaped into a roll and filled with coconut custard, then steamed and sliced. OMG I could have 10 of these. The steamed dessert buns took a long time to come out and in retrospect were out shadowed by the coconut roll, although still good. \n\nYes, some of the dishes are close to $20 so look at the menu before you start grabbing stuff off the cart.

Upscale at the very least (food prices reflect it), and situated in a random alleyway in the Financial District, Yank Sing is the kind of place that's reserved for fancy business meetings or special events (think birthday, anniversary, etc.). \n\nMy co-worker (fellow Yelp Elite Gold member Stephen D.) and I happen to drop in on this place randomly, having already scoured the entire FiDi for decent lunch joints. It was his first time here and after being seated (with less than 3 min wait time) in the outside heated patio, we ordered the basics: Siao Long Bao, Pork Spare Ribs, Jasmine Tea, Har gow and Pork Shumai, all of which were equally delightful. I can't name one complaint about any of the food. Service was quick; as soon as we were sat, ladies with carts of dimsum flocked around us, frequently offering their dishes. After a polite \"no\", they scurried away, tending to other hungry customers. \n\nAfter a brief 20 min. of discussing travels to Asia whilst devouring the food, it was time for the bill, which amounted to ~$46 after tax and tip. Considered it to be a bit on the expensive side, but what can you expect from a upscale Chinese restaurant located in the middle of the Financial District? A quick glance at the clientele eating here and you'd soon notice that, in the midst of European business suits and luxury apparel, a $46 lunch for two people is considered pennies.\n\nI'll rate it a 4/5 for awesome service, delectable food but overall pricey ($4 for a pot of hot jasmine tea?). However, I'll definitely be coming back for special events! \n\nDamage: $$$ ($25-$35 for a small amount of food)\nNoise: Medium (patio dining available)\nParking: Paid street parking\nDress code: Business Casual", "author": "Carloalexi M."}

The tables, chairs, utensils, sauce holders, walls....clean. \n\n2) Surprisingly attentive/quick/helpful/organized staff. After the many places I've gone for dim sum in my lifetime, I've learned that dim sum service can be long and annoying. This place however... Seems dedicated to ensuring that their customers receive any and all dishes they crave. The waiters/waitresses had a very convenient microphone attached to their shirt so any request we had was handled in a timely manner. (At a dim sum place?!?! Unheard of!) Each item we requested came out hot within a matter of minutes. (Except one which they completely forgot to bring...which worked out because we had ordered too much anyway) All in all, very impressive staff.\n\nIn all honestly the food was just ok. I thought the haw gao, sui mai, potstickers, shrimp egg rolls and spare ribs were sub par...I wouldn't order them again. The pork shanghai dumplings, dan taut (egg custard) sesame balls and fried shrimp with a dash of cilantro (no idea what it was called) were my favorite dishes. We also ordered these bacon wrapped pieces of shrimp that were pretty good. \n\nIf I recommended this place...it wouldn't be for the food, but for the experience of seeing what a higher end (and MUCH more expensive) version of dim sum is like. Our total was over $100 for nearly 10 little items and some sodas so it was pretty expensive for dim sum. Still I enjoyed it so I would probably go again and simply order other things.

Although we continually told the sellers who wheel their carts of ready made dim sum that we preferred seafood, veggie, or chicken, they were aggressive in trying to have us accept what was offered (mostly pork ). This is a place for tourists who have not ordered dim sum and are omnivorous but not for true foodies. The fried shrimp were slightly undercooked and the \"vein\" with its sediment had not been removed and the spring rolls were overbaked or overfried (looks like they were baked after frying - as a warmup? The pot stickers were nice and freshly prepared, the shredded cabbage was an  attractive cole slaw cone, delicious and a good contrast to the other foods. The asparagus dish was also innovative, but then the disappointment over some cold watery bok choi or other greens went uneaten by all 12 of us. Egg tarts as dessert  best cut in half and have another split dessert or no other- more than enough for 1 person.The staff was accommodating as to time and it was not crowded by a long shot, even on the day of the Chinese New Years Parade.

But, since ratings have been high and it appears on all the go-to lists in the city, I thought I should give it another shot.

I ordered the char chiu bow (pork buns) and they were OK, but just OK. Had better at most every other place we've been to. \n\nThe tsim so goong (bean sheet rolls) was the first really tasty item I ordered. Pork ribs had absolutely no taste. Finished up with mai gai ( flavored rice in a lotus leaf). It was passable, but not great.\n\nI expected more, much more, out of Yank Sing.

Too expensive, and many of the dishes that came around the cart were cold...\nAlthough the Peking duck buns were delicious, we got 7 slices of duck for $6.60 a piece! I could easily get 1/4 pound of duck on rice for $5-8 everywhere else in Chinatown. The Siu long bao (steamed pork dumplings) were tasty, but also overpriced. And 4 dahn tat (egg tarts) for $12? That's just not fair to people visiting SF that want to actually enjoy a Chinese dim sum meal. We bought a dozen egg tarts for $12 right around the corner from there.\nAnd there wasn't any variety of dishes circulating around on the carts, just the same plates of cold chinese broccoli, \"potstickers\" duck, shu mai, and a few more. The tea was nicely displayed and served.\n\nThey didn't even have \"ha churng\"(wide noodles), \"pie kwat\"(small square ribs), \"gnow chop\"(tripe)!!\n\nReally disappointed but at least we gave it a try.

Lucky for us, Ed was our go to person for the entire dining experience. Yes, we came for the food but Ed was so spectacular in his execution of service!!!!! He is meticulous and as I watched his movements on our table, he was motions of smooth magic like glass on a lake. ALL the service staff at Yank Sing was great but Ed was amazing. There were 2 tables he was attending to with VIP set up and as we were leaving, he apologized for being busy, it was kind of him to say but I understand this industry as I have been in hospitality for over 40 years. It is RARE to find the service perfection that Yank Sing offers and we will be back and make sure that ED is our attendee.", "author": "Veronica L."}

My brother and I debated which dim sum place to try in the area and somehow we settled on this one--could have been because we were too hungry.  At first glance,  it seemed like a good spot because it was packed and there was a wait.  I did notice that there were very few Asians dining here,  not sure if that meant anything,  but something tells me it did and not just about the prices. The food was mediocre to my well-versed-in-dim-sum palate. I've never had Americanized dim sum,  but I'm pretty sure what I ate was that very thing.  They did have the usual items such as shumai, ha gao, lo mai gai.... But I'll be honest,  the fact that they didn't have ha cheong was beyond baffling. My brother and I got various items from the carts and we both only really liked the siu long bao. Their tea was also enjoyable.  Before the  check came,  my brother and I guessed what the bill would come out to. Our average guess was around $60 however when the check came, it was about $94. We knew that it would be fairly pricey given what we read,  but we gave it the benefit of the doubt.  After all it was dim sum and we were just a party of two people. So price wise and taste wise,  this place did not meet our expectations.  \n\nFor what it's worth,  the servers were attentive and kept our table cleared.", "author": "Linda Z."}

Except a mishap in the end of the meal, the staff provides great service. While I may not love Yank Sing to death, I would definitely come back and recommend other Yelpers to visit this Chinese establishment.\n\nWhat makes Yank Sing awesome? \n1) Yank Sing accepts phone reservations. For me, this is a big plus, since I do not like waiting in line on a Sunday morning. \n2) Most dishes of Yank Sing do not have MSG, which is very rare for Chinese restaurants. I definitely recommend Yank Sing to individuals who are allergic to MSG.\n3) Yank Sing provides pleasant service, which justifies its slightly higher prices. When I asked for egg custard buns, the waitress informed me that these buns are made-to-order. After I ordered it, my friends and I got steaming hot buns! I have not had hot buns in dim sum restaurants for ages, and am glad to enjoy them at Yank Sing.\n\nWhat could Yank Sing do to make it more awesome?\n1) Although the dishes are authentic, some of them are lukewarm. Less popular dishes, such as Sichuan green beans, are almost cold. \n2) A server claimed that my friend's credit card did not work, and asked for two other credits. The last card eventually worked. My friend's cards, however, worked in other places we went for the rest of the day. My friend immediately got worried and called the card centers to ensure that he was not charged for the meal three times. Luckily, he was only charged once. Does the card machine at Yank Sing have issues? Or is the staff trying to steal information from his various cards? I would appreciate if the management of Yank Sing can look into this issue.\n\nOverall, my friends and I had a pleasant experience of dining at Yank Sing, other than the episode in the end. If you want to eat non-MSG dim sum at a clean restaurant, Yank Sing is the place for you!", "author": "May Y."}

Steamed pork bun was a disappointment since it didn't have the usual moist bun texture that I'm used to and prefer. Shape was a bit off too. \n\nHighlight 2: Peking duck with steamed bun: Sliced Peking duck with crispy skin, topped with slices of scallions and sweet Hoisin sauce wrapped in a steamed bun = heaven.\n\nLastly, dessert was egg tarts.

So terrified that still, to this day, I'm afraid to tell her that I just had dim sum for lunch at Yank Sing, and that it cost my lunch friend Sara P. and me $80.  Yes, you read that right.  $80 for dim sum.  For the two of us.\n\nNot bad food, but it's DEFINITELY not a place you want to go if you desire authentic, hearty dim sum at a fraction of the price.  This is clearly a place geared towards the business crowd who want to impress their fellow suits because the place is clean and service is attentive, which are two things that hole-in-the-wall Chinese places generally lack.  Take the trek to Lai Hong or the Richmond district for amazing dim sum without the frills.\n\nBy the way, if you're ordering boxed lunches for your office lunch, don't.  It was so greasy everything was leaking out and everyone felt incredibly sick a few bites in.", "author": "Tori S."}

I've eaten a lot of dim sum in my life both here in the US and in Hong Kong, so I'm nitpicking here.  The food here is good, and it's a solid restaurant in FiDi if you're not as concerned with value.\n\nOverall, decent dim sum at high prices (you can read about the $$$ hate in all the other reviews).  If I had a bit more time for lunch and wanted dim sum in FiDi, I'd go for City View (used to be Harbor Village) instead.  One of the HK Lounge branches in Richmond if you're not geographically constrained, and Lai Hong in Chinatown if you're looking for great value.\n---\n\nPhoenix Tail Prawns were the highlight.  Freshly fried and flavorful without tasting too oily and heavy.  Strangely enough, it didn't come with the tartar type sauce I expected, but a sweet and sour sauce.\n\nSiu Long Bao (soup dumplings) were good, but not the best in the city and most certainly not Din Tai Fung quality good (even their US offshoots) as some other reviewers have said.  The two orders were had both tasted a bit oversteamed, though the skins held up well, though the soup within the dumplings just wasn't very impressive.\n\nHa Gao (shrimp dumplings) were passable.  The shrimp ball was generous and the shrimp texture suggested it was fresh, but there wasn't much taste to it and the dumpling skin wasn't very well made - a bit heavy handed on the flour.\n\nSiu Mai (pork dumplings) were on the other end of the spectrum.  The four pieces in the steamer were stuck together, there wasn't much taste to it, and it just tasted overcooked.  True, they use a leaner meat than most dim sum restaurants, but there's better quality Siu Mai to be had all along Stockton Street for a fraction of the price.  \n\nTried the Mango Mousse based on recommendations on here and it was fairly good.  Light, creamy, and not too sweet.  Not sure why it was topped with a strawberry slice though.  The traditional condensed milk sauce would have complimented the mousse more, but this is something you can and should ask for.\n\nAlso ordered snap peas and string beans so we could pretend to be healthy, but they were both lukewarm, oily, and flavorless.\n\nTheir hot sauce is more of a satay / XO sauce than anything.  While good with dim sum since it's not as jarring as the garlic chili sauce you find elsewhere, you could find something with a bit more bite to it at any Asian convenience store or 99 Ranch.\n\nWeekday lunch crowd was fairly packed even around 1:15, but thankfully we had a reservation.  Service was brisk, but they are really heavy on the oversell.  Definitely a few instances where they started putting the bamboo steamers down before even getting a \"yes.\"   I'm not accustomed to having my dim sum introduced to me in English, though it sounded like the employees spoke Cantonese, so I'm sure you could ask about certain dishes in Canto if you found that preferable.", "author": "Lincoln L."}

A friend treated me to lunch there recently, and I'm not sure if it was something in the tea (which was very good), but somehow the meal ended up costing $120 for two. \n\nThe menu consists of some of the staples (har gow, siu mai, etc) but definitely lacking in the more exotic fare you can get in Chinatown. My friend ordered a lot of the fried specialty items and most of them were lukewarm, but the portions were large. Taste was mediocre, similar to the food court inside 99 Ranch. There's something about lukewarm dim sum that's just foul. The steamed items were large as well but also underwhelming in terms of freshness and flavor. The prices average out to about $5 per dish, which is about double that of other dim sum restaurants.\n\nThis is what I call \"Chipotle dim sum\" where the experience is sanitized and well executed given what it is, but completely lacks authenticity and character. At this price point, even if the experience is not authentic, I would have expected more decadence, but that doesn't seem to be the model of this place. To me, dim sum should feel like a warm family gathering, but this place feels more like a corporate function. This is the kind of face saving dim sum place for business folks who might have an important client in town and want to take them some place close by. But If you want to share in the camaraderie of the dim sum experience (fighting over dishes with other tables, figuring out who should get the last morsel, flagging down a waiter, piping hot dim sum, talking and laughing loud, etc..), get your butt over to Chinatown.\n\nFood: C.....not great, not terrible\nService: A.....perhaps too attentive, especially when hard selling big ticket dishes\nAtmosphere: B......nice and clean place, mostly people talking business\nPrice: Got an extra kidney to sell?", "author": "Stevey K."}

I think it's way overpriced for dim sum but hey theres not a lot of dim sum places in the fidi area so i get it.\n\nSo far I've only order the yank sing mini which comes with their chinese chicken salad, 2 potstickers and an eggroll. All for about $6 which is a good lunch deal considering its the fidi/downtown area.\n\nI never have to wait more then 10 min before I get my food. It's a salad and potstickers, it shouldn't take that long right? At first I was scared that the portions would be small considering its only $6 but I was pleasantly surprised that there is a good portion of salad with good flavors. The thinly sliced dark chicken meat with the pieces of fried wonton bits make this salad tasty. They do giving you a mustard dressing which is very light but Im not fond of mustard and I usually eat the salad without any dressing and it still has enough flavors without it.\n\nThe potstickers and eggroll are good as well just a little more on the greasy side.\n\nI would come here again just because its a quick and easy to go lunch option.

With the exception of the dumplings, everything was fantastic and piping hot.  The dumplings were a bit of a disappointment since they were sticking to the steamer, and every single one tore as we gently pulled it off, wasting all of the tasty broth.

The quality is good and refined without the grease, but perhaps overpriced for comparable quality and larger portions elsewhere.\n\nService is fast during lunch for dim sum with multiple carts being pushed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-02", "description": "I came here drawn by the B patisserie CNY special pastries. I don't usually love dim sum because it tends to be very lard heavy and greasy, but it tastes much lighter here.  Coming here, I knew to expect more expensive prices but wasn't sure what to expect for the authenticity of it.  To start, the front of the house was very friendly and polite.\n\nFirst off, there's no choice of tea, which was a little surprising for a dim sum place, especially as everyone who worked there was clearly Chinese.\n\nDishes:\n- Xiao jiao (har gow): shrimp dumpling - this was undoubtedly the best thing we had, and it's much better than most that I've had anywhere else. The outer skin was a good texture without being too thick, and it was generous on the shrimp inside and well seasoned\n- Shao mai: the pork and shrimp one had a lot of shrimp, and it was less greasy than usual, but it didn't have the usual fatty pork flavor that you go for; also, it had been sitting in the steam cart for too long and was dry\n- Scallop shao mai: non-traditional, but I actually really liked this one\n- Xiao long bao: with Kurobuta pork. It's quite fatty and has the soup inside but also doesn't have the usual pork flavor from XLB elsewhere\n- Mongolian lamb special: for new years; pricy at $12.88 for a small plate, but the flavor was really good without any gaminess, and the lamb strips were served with soft steamed buns\n- Lotus leaf rice: the filling was not what I expected - it was more dark and soy saucey than the usual version, but it wasn't bad.\n- Black sesame kouign amann: this was the reason we came. The inside was like a tang yuan with black sesame paste, but it was quite sweet.  The outer crisp layers were really good, and at $3.88, it's pretty reasonable. It's a bit much for one person, but it's good for sharing and with the tea, which got pretty bitter by the end of our meal.\n\nI'm not sure I would come here again for dim sum (except maybe for the har gow), but if you want a nicer, less loud/hectic, MSG free dim sum experience, it's a good place to go.  Plus, having the option of reservations is appealing, since the wait for dim sum is usually long.\n\nDefinitely make a reservation on Open Table, especially on the weekends.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

It does get busy so I recommend making a reservation. We had 11:30 reservations and were seated right away. Don't get the chicken satay. I was not a fan of the meat. Do get the pork bun. \nThe service is great, but almost too efficient. We hadn't been in our seta for more than a minute before a cart got there. This was nice except that we had so much food in front of us within 10 minutes there was no way to not feel rushed. I suggest making a concerted effort to take your time.

However, I was warned by many viable sources that it's not worth the hype.  I still wanted to try for myself but keeping in mind some reservations.  So, what's the verdict?  Yep, as expected....Good dim sum at best does not equal exorbitant prices.  \n\nMost memorable was the Chilean Sea bass, soup dumplings, and egg custard tarts.  I actually missed out on the Peking Duck Baos and glazed roast pork buns as they 86 certain items to control quality so nothing goes to waste.  \n\nLeast memorable were all the dumplings.  It was all the same shrimp stuffing either mixed w. basil, scallop, crab, chives and etc.  Mediocre at best.  Oh, and their green onion cake which we thought was a scallion pancake but no, it was more of a puff pastry.  It was def my least favorite.  \n\nFYI, 3 of us had about 12-15 items of so and the bill was around $150 so be prepared to pay if you really want to try this place.  How does this place compare to other dim sum places?  Somewhat the same type of over aggressive dim sum ladies but servers were much more attentive and professional.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-03", "description": "While everything we tried tasted great (the Peking duck, pork soup dumplings and steamed dumplings were my favorites with the fried spring roll being the weakest) I had sticker shock when the bill arrived: $55 for six items shared between the two of us before tip (we did not order any drinks). I would say the quality was a small step up from other dim sum venues I have frequented, but we paid approximately double what we normally pay for less food - the increased quality was not nearly substantial enough to warrant such a massive price differential. \n\nThere is a vast array of options and the food is more tame than other dim sum venues I have been (i.e. few items I did not recognize or that contained odd body parts). Good if you are not into challenging foods or are not familiar with this style of cuisine and want to ease into it but if you are seeking authentic dim sum you would be best advised to look elsewhere.\n\nThe food comes at a fast and furious pace; the first cart rolled to our table before I even made it back from a quick restroom pit stop. Each cart typically contained a few different items and a new cart approached every minute or two. Most items run $5 to $13 and have various quantities (i.e. the Peking duck was just one steamed bun's worth per order whereas the soup dumplings came with six). It would be nice if they toned back the pace some; within ten minutes we had all the food we would consume on the table and within fifteen minutes were done. \n\nService we also just a tad aggressive in that at times they started to put items on our table that we had not requested and had to stop them. If you are not assertive you may end up quickly having far more than you can eat sitting in front of you and wind up with a Great Wall of China sized bill. Tip: If you see something on the menu you want that is not brought by, ask any of the servers and they will notify the person with that cart to come to your table. \n\nIf you want a quick, casual meal and do not mind overpaying then Yank Sing is certainly a viable option for good tasting, approachable dim sum.", "author": "Erick N."}

However, the servers answered me in English, and I think they purposely placed my friend and me near the entrance, and me sitting behind the pillar, because they wanted to hide the only Canton speaking customer.\n\nSad to say, I'm so used to the cheap dim sum places where dishes cost less than $2 a plate, and if I didn't look at the menu... Once I looked at the menu after ordering a plate of the egg tarts, I basically flipped a lid, had dinner plate eyes and my jaw dropped SO far on the ground that I probably broke a few floor tiles along the way. (If you want to experience the same thing I did, $9.50 for a plate of four egg tarts.)\n\nThe reason why I gave it three stars is that I was slightly mad at the fact that EVERY single time I talked in Canton, I get a reply back in English. Really? I think only one person, who was one of the front servers, spoke to me in Cantonese when I asked where the washroom was. She said downstairs, and I was slightly confused as to why a restaurant would have a separate floor for their restrooms.\n\nI originally gave this place two stars and bumped it back up one because the decor was pretty nice, something you don't see too often in dim sum places. Then again, like my friend said, \"you're paying a high price on food for atmosphere.\" I rather just go to a take-out dim sum place, buy a few dishes, take it home and enjoy my atmosphere. However, the place was pretty small, so small that the carts had a racetrack down, to avoid bumping into each other.\n\nAnd I do give them points for having such a cool teapot.\n\nI was confused about a few of the dishes:\n\n- Soup Dumpling: I have never had them outside of Ding Tai Fung, and was confused as to why the soup was lukewarm, instead of piping hot and why the sauce we were given was a red one, instead of black. (I'm assuming it's the red vinegar, but I kind of wanted a more salty sauce).\n- Schetwan Chicken: This plate, we had to order it from a walking server without a car, and the dish was cold by the time we got it. I thought it was going to be a little bit warm, but I guess the plate was out on the floor for a while.\n\nI would probably not come back here because of the prices.

We went at lunchtime on a Wednesday and only had a 20 minute wait. The places was packed and we loved the ambiance. There wasn't really any explanation for how the system worked and at times it was very difficult to hear what they were offering, so we chose to be adventurous. At $84 for the two of us, it was very expensive for what we ate. There were at times long lulls in the carts coming around and we were sitting there hungry. It took a very long time and multiple requests to finally be able to order something special. The honey walnut prawns were DELICIOUS (albeit medium shrimp size) and we could have done without the cream cheese shrimp wantons (tasteless with a weird texture) and the mango pudding (somewhat bland). Potstickers and dumplings were yum. A good experience to try.", "author": "Jackie W."}

So the first thing I wanted to do when I knew that I will spend a weekend in SF was to go eat some awesome dim sum. Yelp had this place at the top for good ratings. I went.\n\nThe reviews said it is a bit pricey but since it is in a nicer neighborhood, I decided to go because I wanted to dine in more calm and chill environment rather than a typical chinese restaurant with rude servers and loud dining area. I WAS WRONG.\n\nThis is a small place so unless you make a reservation, or wait, even with a reservation, you have to wait at least 30 min until you are seated. But that's ok, it's a small restaurant. But what I want to point out is that the service is TERRIBLE.\n\nThe cart never goes around the whole restaurant. It starts at the same place, so by the time it came to my table, all the dim sums were gone. When I ordered something off the menu, it took very long for the food to come out. I asked the server when the food is going to be out, he kept saying he is checking, but never got back to me. The servers also had hard time explaining what dim sum is in the cart. \n\nBottom line, it is not worth the money to eat here. Go to other places in Chinatown for cheaper and better dim sum.", "author": "Ashley P."}

One thing I didn't know was that there is a HUGE difference in locations, according to her.  She had gone to the one on Spear street, and it was a huge difference.\n\nI dim sum with her a lot, and I was overwhelmingly disappointed with the food.  Most of the dim sum was cold/warm to the touch, the shrimp dumplings were sticky, pork buns were cold, there isn't even shrimp or beef crepe (churn fun) at this location, what a joke.  We ended up eating only random lukewarm dumplings here as nothing was appetizing, and ended up spending $130 on 10 dishes of dim sum.\n\nOne star for great service as food wasn't their fault, and one star for edible food, but it's far less quality than what they're charging you for.

Hope I don't ruin my Cantonese street cred by posting this review.  Mainly, we were going here because we needed a place that took reservations.\n\nYang Sing is a dim sum place that offers more than the usual Canto fare.  The atmosphere is okay, clean, but still bustling and crowded, and there are people who push dim sum carts around.  The staff is Chinese and they will speak Cantonese to you if that's your preferred language.  There were a few other Asians dining here, but most patrons were non-Asian.\n\nThe food was quality stuff.  We got 3 orders of Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai soup dumplings), each steamer basket only had 6 pieces.  They were very well made with thin skins, piping hot and full of tasty, greasy, flavorful juice.  Each one melted in my mouth.  It comes with the traditional red vinegar and ginger slivers.  Not a part of Cantonese cuisine, but I no longer cared!\n\nWe also tried some classics such as shrimp dumplings (har gow), which were filled with large, succulent shrimp that popped in your mouth.  Very fresh and it didn't leave you with a heavy MSG aftertaste.  The siu mi (pork dumplings) were also packed with flavor & the right consistency, sort of like a meatloaf nugget.\n\nThey ordered a scallop dumpling which was also good.  Gai lan (Chinese broccoli) was tasty, but served cold.  Interesting.  The lettuce wraps are decidedly a fusion dish (a la PF Chang), but surprisingly tasty.  It was a round piece of iceberg lettuce with some savory bits of ground meat, topped with pine nuts.  We tried the honey walnut shrimp, which was okay, but not the best I've ever had.  It was the tiniest dish I've ever had, though.  The sea bass was excellent: silky smooth and delicious.  I would never have thought about ordering this at dim sum, but I am not complaining!\n\nFor dessert, we tried the orange juice jello.  Basically, it's densely made jello that is poured into an orange half, then allowed to set, and cut into slices.  Cute, but not as cool looking as the picture on their website.  It tasted okay, however, it's not something I'd recommend on flavor alone.\n\nCome with an open mind and an open wallet.  It was $40/head and we weren't completely stuffed full.  You can feed your whole family authentic dim sum at other restaurants for $40 total!  The quality of the dim sum was high, but in my mind, not worth the incredibly high prices.

We spent a total of 40 minutes eating but took almost 30 minutes to get our bill, charge our card AND to get out! They charged us twice for two separate amounts because they mistakenly entered in the wrong amount the first time. It equalled out to the correct amount but it was quite annoying to wait that long when you only have a 1 hour lunch break.\n\nThe dim sum in general was very tasty. I loved the sweet sticky rice ball dumplings. We ordered two portions of the shanghai dumplings because it was that good! My bf really liked the su mai and the shrimp dumplings. Overall, I would have to say that the food was pretty good but super expensive in contrast to other dim sum spots I've eaten at.\n\nI also got to-go on a separate occasion and the chow mein was gross.

I base the reputation of a dim sum establishment on these two dishes because if you can't do those right it doesn't bode well for what is to come. \n\nNeedless to say, they were just A-OK. While nothing horribly offensive it certainly wasn't anything to wow over either. In addition to our meal, we ordered a plethora of items since my friend had never been, so we were able to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of Yank Sing. I throughly enjoyed the tea presentation and the flavor however, this was a first time I had to pay for tea with my dim sum but was worth it. \n\nOur meal ended up costing $96.63 before tip. While we did order quite a few items I believe that if we went somewhere else and ordered the same we would have paid a fraction of that cost and received better selection and quality. I was extremely disappointed that they didn't carry my noodle dish! \n\nOverall Thoughts\n\nAn upscale dim sum establishment with prices to match. The food lacked character and soul, certainly did not touch my heart.", "author": "Eddie W."}

It always tastes fresh, and unlike some other places the fried items are always served hot and crispy.  I cannot think of one item that I've ordered here where I feel like \"oh, this is not as good as that other place\".  Being an expensive restaurant they also have 'premium items' being passed around like Peking duck and Chilean seabass.\n\nService - great\nEven when they are full I never feel like I am waiting too long for the food to come out.  They are also wearing earpieces and microphones so when you want something just flagged them and they'll put an order in to the kitchen.  Also, they all speak good English and are patient to explain what everything is.\n\nAtmosphere - ok\nIt can get a little to 'corporate' and sterile in here.  Definitely not the kind of atmosphere I am looking for from a dim sum restaurant.  The place itself is physically nice though.\n\nPrice - bad\nThis is what's stopping me from giving 5 star rating.  They are expensive.  You can easily spend $30/person here without any alcoholic beverages.  This is an 'issue' because I relate dim sum with cheap meal.  Our 'other' place would cost us around $12 for the equivalent amount (not necessarily quality) of food that we get here for $30.  \n\nOverall this is a great place for special occasion dim sum.

Be forewarned as the servers slowly lower yet another small plate of yummies to your table that a group of three can easily tally $100 or more and a group of 5 or more easily tops $200 at this restaurant. Of course this is of no consequence if it's going on your company's tab.\n\nI've been to this location and the other 3 several times and the service is typically solid but today?

Really? Their thinking on that suggestion eludes me. In any case, we declined and eventually they managed to find a few tables to push together.\n\nThe servers missed a couple of drinks we ordered but they were quick to bring them once reminded. They put $15 to our bill for tea we never ordered and corrected the bill, after we pointed out their error. Yank Sing comp'd us nothing for their mishap with our table or the bill.

Tender thin and light wrap over a juicy succulent piece of pork. Very tasty! Also find the other dumpling offerings top notch, although a bit \"touristy\" in choices (egg rolls, char shu bao). Very very pricey so not a place I go to often but its fun for a splurge. Very nice dining room with white table clothes and upscale environment, but you pay for it. $83 for two for dim sum recently.

I like to spend my work lunches cheating on my ethnicity, but know that I go home everyday to Chinese food and a clear conscience. Dim sum is clearly the exception; it is comfort food to me and can be eaten any day at any time!\n\nLuckily, we have Yank Sing right behind our building to fulfill my undying craving for dim sum. Haven't quite had the luxury yet of being able to sit down at the actual restaurant and have fresh bamboo steamers delivered tableside for me to point and choose, but for a quick lunch pickup, they have a \"Yank Sing 2 Go\" store just next door. The line is typically out the door (there is no room for a line here anyway) but it goes VERY quickly. The ladies here work HARD! They take your order when the person in front of you hasn't even had the chance to put their change back into their wallet and your meal is prepared while you are putting your change back in your own wallet.\n\nYou can choose from their preset list of boxes (typically includes dim sum and either rice or noodles, a huge portion!) which are about $6-7, their special of the day about $5, or order a la carte. I definitely prefer a la carte because I only want dim sum, but it adds up. A siu mai is about $1.00 and both the sesame ball & egg tart are $1 and some change. It adds up. I'm not a light dim sum eater! Other than that, my only other gripe is that they do not offer the usual staples of dim sum here so it will only give you a taste for your craving, not satisfy it. You only have about five choices and honestly, pot stickers and egg rolls do not qualify as dim sum eats to me. Where are the deep fried taro thingy and steamed meat balls; just to name a few. Sigh.\n\nOverall, a decent place to pick up a decent priced lunch for a lot of food if you go the preset menu way, but a little risky if you go the a la carte way. I hope they expand their \"2 go\" menu a little more to offer a few more of the staples, I mean, they make it next door just make it available?

I first discovered Yank Sing before I moved to SF about 5 or 6 years ago when I came up to visit with my family from LA.  There was a HUGE group of us, and the overall experience was amazing.  Fastforward now to the last year and half, where Yank Sing is now right behind where I work, and where I'll go to splurge on dim sum. When my mom comes up to visit, she always asks to go to Yank Sing, so I've been here about 3 or 4 times within the last year.  In any case, this place is REALLY pricey for things that will cost a fraction up the street in Chinatown.  One of my trips to Yank Sing with my cousin and her boyfriend resulted in a tab that was about $115.  That being said, there are a few items that well worth the price.  The duck taco w/ plum sauce and scallion is absolutely AMAZING.  I get excited just writing about it.  The other thing that is amazing are the Shanghai dumplings.  My mom claims that they're the best she's had in the US, second to only what we got in Shanghai.  Everything else, (ie. shu mai, har gow, baos, potstickers, spare ribs, sesame balls, mango pudding, etc) is good, but something you could probably get for cheaper in Chinatown.  The other thing that is a pain about this place is that it is REALLY small, so there's always a line.  I'd expect to wait a good 25-35 minutes on a Sunday afternoon if you don't time it just right.

It's no better than panda express, but it'll do when you're in the mood for some Chinese.\n\nI ordered the express combo, which comes with a heap of chowmein, egg roll, pot sticker, and pork bun for about $7 after tax.  It's more food than you'll want to eat in a meal, and all of it is tasty enough to want to finish. \n\nChow mein - good flavor but the noodles felt too dense, as if they had been made too long ago and had been sitting for a while.\n\nEgg roll - solid.  I should have asked for hoisin sauce though\n\nPot sticker - really tasty, and next time I might order an extra.\n\nPork bun - The pork was delicious, and the bun was a good compliment, but it's too much bun.  I ended up scooping out the meat into the chow mein so I didn't have to eat too much of the bun.  When you have this much other food, you don't want to fill yourself up on bread.", "author": "Dave S."}

Sadly, the same care is not put into their quick 2 Go front which tastes on par with other subpar Chinese fast food joints in the FiDi.  Their service is crazy  fast for take out, but the cost is quality degradation.\n\nSpring Roll: Crispy, which is a good thing, because soggy spring rolls suck.  A little bit much on the cabbage, but the ground meat (pork?) added some good contrast.  Overall, too greasy.\n \nPot Sticker: Pork and scallion.  Disliked that the fried bottom was not crispy, a sign that it had been awhile since it saw the pan.\n\nSteamed Pork Bun: Overly bready.  The meat was in short supply, small pieces and had that funky day old BBQ taste.\n\nSiu Mye: Heavy on the shrimp which is always a plus.  Slightly cold which made the texture too dense.\n\nChicken in Foil: Nice marinade, very salty and soy intensive.  The meat was tough and just the fatty dark meat sections.  Normally not a fan of that cut, but it worked well as a small bite here.\n\nCustard Tart: Really flaky crust, good job!

Angry that I've discovered San Francisco has better dim sum than Los Angeles (San Gabriel, to be exact). As a matter fact, there was something about that meal, on that particular day, at that particular time, that made it the best dim sum. I. Ever. Had. \n\nThis place was a bit difficult to locate. There's a reason why there were a few signs out on the sidewalk. It's located in a shopping center inside a building past a fountain. \n\nThe decor and smell was definitely reminiscent of your traditional Chinese Dim Sum restaurant. The Jasmine tea came out in a very pleasant-looking clear teapot. There was also plenty of Chinese hot mustard and garlic hot sauce to go around, which is crucial to this meal. We ordered multiple servings of  Siu-Mai, chicken feet, black bean spare ribs, and Har Gows among other things. Each and every dish was extremely tasty and fresh. Something about it just made it that much better than the countless other places I've tried in the San Gabriel Valley. It's like I was trying Dim Sum for the very first time. \n\nThe place was not extremely packed, but there was a good amount of people. After all, it was a Wednesday. The lunch crowd started to usher in as we were about to leave, so I assume that would be a much busier time for them. This visit has made it a mandatory stop whenever I'm in the city. It was really one of the highlights on the wonderful trip to SF.", "author": "Randolph L."}

We'd vowed to do that version of the dim sum experience on this trip. And it is quite the experience.\n\nWe arrived about an hour before closing, so there crowd was spare. Our table was literally descended upon by cart after cart filled with dumplings, fried items, and other food. Our only request during the meal, baked BBQ pork buns, had sold out earlier in the day, unfortunately. But there was plenty of other choices.\n\nThe meal was fast. It probably took us longer to walk to the restaurant than it did to eat. It's easy to see how this kind of dining would be popular for a busy lunch crowd. It's also easy to see how it could quickly become expensive for people interested in trying one of everything: our meal was no cheaper here than at Wayfare or any of the other higher end establishments we visited, and I certainly didn't get the feeling like I'd been any more copiously fed than I had elsewhere.\n\nAnd I have to admit that, having done both now, ordering off the menu is probably my preference. I felt like I got more of what I wanted that way, and didn't feel as likely to make a $10 mistake like the shrimp balls we ended up with. It's my fault, really, since I was blithely pointing at things that looked good without looking at a price list or asking. But having a menu in front of me to order from would have definitely avoided the issue.\n\nMy favorite dish was the Shanghai Dumpling which featured minced Kurobuta pork and a small splash of broth encased in a dumpling.

Because they asian ladies are much more efficient than Chipotle and get your food fast.  \n\nDon't argue with me that Chipotle is faster with the comment that when you make your order, you would get your food faster through the assembly line.  That's a garbage arguement because if you include the amount of waiting time in-line at Chipotle, Yank Sing 2 Go is leagues ahead in speed.  \n\nAnother yelper here was complaining about the order system and confused about the call number.  Look at your damn receipt.  It says \"CALL NO.: XXX\".  I mean, how dumb can you get?  Never once has the worker messed orders up.  It would only be the customer's fault.  \n\nNow back to the food.  You get a ton of food if you order one of their set combos.  No matter what, it will be too much for you to eat.  I find it hilarous that people are complaining about too much food.  When you see how cheap the prices are, why are some of you complaining about too much food?  Nobody's forcing you to eat all of it, fatty.  \n\nIt is too much food for me, but you know what?  They have a smaller combo option displayed right at the cashier.  A: Pork chow mein + 4 potstickers or B: Fried rice + 2 shui mai + 2 fried wontons.  Either is for $4.95.  And either will make you filled (A will be more filling than B because the noodles are more densly packed and potstickers are huge).\n\nNow in terms of quality, it's probably at the top in the financial district vs. other chinese take-out places.  Is it greasy?  The noodles are, but it's not as greasy as other chinese take-out places.  So it's pretty normal in that respect.\n\nTo sum it up:  Value (lots of food for price), super-fast and tasty.  You'll see so many people come here during lunch time.  Obviously there's something good going on here.", "author": "Jon K."}

Most of the wrapped foods don't have a lot of excess wrappings so you don't have a lot of wasted portions when you eat here. The big problem with this place is the service is pretty bad. Depending on where you sit, you might get skipped A LOT as the carts empty up from other tables and you have to be a bit forceful if you want something in this case.

It's super over priced dimsum that caters to the business crowd or tourists. When I came here earlier today, I was a bit surprised to see that we were one of the 3 Asian tables there with the rest of the patrons being Caucasians. I have definitely had as good or even better at much cheaper dimsum restaurants and only go to this Yank Sing at the behest of my friend who is a big fan of Yank Sing.\n\nThe service isn't any better than any other dimsum restaurant IMO. We were having to wave down our server a few times to repeatedly inquire about the status of our order. The dimsum selection is pretty limited which is probably another reason why the Asian clientele is lacking here.

Came here since it was close to our Hotel and this ended up hitting the spot. Thought they could do better on variety and pricing is way expensive for dim sum, but there were a few standouts:\n\n-Shanghai Dumplings - of course, I've had better in Taiwan, but these are some of the better ones in the states. The dumplings have the broth inside and so yummy!\n\n-The sticky rice in lotus wrap - also some of the better ones i've had - the meat inside is super flavorful and saucy within the rice\n\n-steamed pork bun - they kind of skimp on the bbq pork, but the outside bread is nice and fluffy. very good.\n\n-Green onion pancake - this was the highlight. I've never had green onion pancake quite like this; it's flaky and pastry-like; not flat and panfried as i'm used to. You dip it in a peanut butter chili sauce which was unusual but super good. Truly unique.\n\nI would come back just to get the rice wrapped in lotus wrap, dumplings and ESPECIALLY green onion pancake. Just be careful bc they try to upsell you by walking around with an $18 piece of seabass! So easy to just say yes, not realizing how much it costs. Just be prepared to pay double or almost triple than what you would normally pay at a traditional dim sum place.", "author": "Erica L."}

They were fried some time before, not very crisp and stuck together from sitting around for awhile.

I ate 1 & reheated the 2nd in the microwave for dinner & it held up well to reheating. Would order again.\nEggplant w/ Hunan Sauce - the eggplant was drowning in the sauce & very mushy. Somehow, that combo worked well with taste as the eggplant had no taste except for sauce! Ate it all as there were only about 4 small-to-tiny pieces\nVege Chow Mein - hello entire container of fried noodles! Really could scale down on the amount they give you but not bad. A few veggies thrown in there for good measure - sliced cukes, carrots & bean sprouts. I ate 1/3 & had enough for 2 more servings later. Kind of held up when I reheated a portion later but I wouldn't get it again. \n\nShrimp Dumpling (4) - on recommendation from cashier. They were a bit gummy but you could see the shrimp. I think they were overdone & definitely didn't reheat well \n\nEmpanadas stuffed w/ Lotus Leaf - interesting but wouldn't buy it again. The crust was too much, not allowing the lotus leaf to have a flavor except for a paste-y texture inside your mouth.\n\nSesame ball - the real reason I went here. They were yummy...I'd buy a few of these next time, even at over $1/ball! Fried to a wonderful texture of gooyness/moistness with a coating of sesame seeds to balance the sweet yellow bean paste inside. They are a large size (as is all that's served here) so 1 was plenty for me. No reheating on this one! \n\nAs you've read, I reheated a lot because I got a lot & couldn't eat it all at 1 time.

From the hole in the wall, sticky table, sticky chairs, dirty chopsticks $1.50 for 3 pieces type of dim sum to this beautiful place of a great offering of dim sum and more!\n\nWhen I think Yank Sing, I think beautifully hand crafted, mouth watering morsels of food!  It is pricey however but the clean and upscale atmosphere, friendly service and amazing amazing dim sum makes it worth it.  And sometimes in life, you gotta splurge a little.  Definitely a place to bring the future in-laws, your best friend to say \"thanks, you rock\" or I guess.. even your employees to say thanks as 4 of my 5 experiences were graciously given by my old employer.  Oh, and the catering is good quality too!\n\nShanghai Dumplings - tender dumpling skin with a hot refreshing broth inside with plenty of pork filling with ginger and green onion.  the slight burn from the hot broth for those who can't wait is worth the experience and burst of flavors! It's no wonder they're known for this and that shanghai dumplings are a big deal all over the world..they aren't easy to execute like this. \n\nPeking Duck - who can resist?? Crispy, crispy skin with a bit of duck fat and juicy meat underneath with the perfect steamed bun, sauce and green onion?? Oh my.. I'm hungry! I think it's one of the best I've EVER had. \n\nTaro Root Dumpling - wonderfully crispy and not overly greasy i want to bathe in hot tea kind of deal here. \n\nGREASE - one of my main complaints about dim sum is the greasiness and how I feel gross afterward.  But it's not like that here! Really, it's good stuff. \n\nOK... i could go on and on forever. They have all your typical dim sum offerings and den sum.  All very succulent, juicy and flavorful.  A diverse menu and still plenty of offerings for a vegetarian as well.  I'm not a fan of getting chow fun, chow mein and things like that because I can get that anywhere anytime, so i'm not sure about that here.

Having a large party with us we were able to try everything from Haw Gow, Shu Mai, pork buns, and the sea bass.\n\nHaving a lot of people in our party also was a downside because this place is fairly expensive and the bill can add up fast.  I've had fairly good Dim Sum at other places with more traditional selection and less exotic ones and the price was reasonable.", "author": "Ritche C."}

I ask what it is and they say it is steamed pork, their signature dish.  I say sure, I will take that so I proceed to start eating it.  It is dim sum right - how expensive could it be?  My mistake, big time.\n\nAfter I have started eating it, THEN they give me the menu and I ask how much it is.  The say $11.90!  For 6 small steamed pork things!  These would cost less than $2 in Chinatown.\n\nI then ask for some tea and they give me a huge kettle of tea.  I ask if they have it by the cup and they say only the tea kettle, which costs $4.00!  I was eating by myself - why do I need $4.00 worth of tea?\n\nI then order Pork Shu Mai (4 pieces for $5.80, good but rip-off - they should be less than $3.00) and Chicken Egg rolls.  They say the Egg rolls are 4 for $5.80 but they can also do a half order.  I say half-order thinking it would cost $2.90 so they give me two egg rolls, cut them in half, which then becomes the 4 pieces for $5.80! Unbelievable.\n\nI order some Chinese Broccoli and half of it is inedible stem.  I ask and they say people eat the stems so that is another $5.80 down the drain, even though I could only eat half of the vegetable.\n\nAt this point I know I am screwed so I order two egg custards for dessert, which were another $5.80 (about $1.50 in Chinatown).  So my grand total at the end of the meal was just over $40.00.  I know the Financial District is a high rent area but they are making so much money off that food.  They were very sneaky about the pricing and I guarantee this same meal in Chinatown would have been under $20.  A $40 lunch for 3 regular/small servings of Dim Sum, 1 small serving of vegetable, 1 dessert and 1 tea.  That is ridiculous and I won't be going back!", "author": "Chris F."}

For your average siu mai, har gow and other little plates that I usually get for $2-3 per plate at those joints, I feel like Yank Sing was underwhelming and not worth the premium for comparable taste.\n\nService is excellent though, we didnt have to request to have hot water refilled for tea and food carts were always stopping at our table.  \n\nNot sure if I would be planning to spend another $30-40 on lunch here any time soon, I rather just take an extra half an hour and head on out to chinatown.", "author": "Yun W."}

Before you accuse me of being a banana or Twinkie, let me explain. \n\nBefore last week, I prided myself on the fact that I had never eaten at Yank Sing. In fact, I use to clown on Chinese friends who admitted to liking the restaurant by saying, \"That means you're white-washed. You're going to marry a gwai lo and join a country club. You're going to name your kids Adeline and Preston and they're going to suck at math.\"\n\nThen, last week, I ate at Yank Sing not once, but twice. And you know what, I liked it. I really liked it.\n\nThe first time, I went for a wedding rehearsal lunch. Their dim sum assortment was impressive and the food tasty. The carts, constantly zipping around the tables, offered the standards like shrimp dumpling, shu mai, and egg roll as well as the more exotic dishes such as Peking duck. Their xiao long baos were juicy and the skin just thick enough to prevent leakage without being chewy. The dofu fa was light with just the right amount of ginger and sugar syrup.\n\nThen this past Saturday, my friend's wedding took place in Rincon Center. The Yank Sing staff was able to quickly and seamlessly transform the atrium from restaurant to ceremony seating to 400+ guest banquet seating. As co-wedding coordinator, I was more than impressed with their efficiency and professionalism. In terms of the food, the 10-course banquet menu was not as tasty as their dim sum but everything was still above par.\n\nI still think that Yank Sing is way too overpriced and unless someone else is treating, I most likely won't be back. But I do feel like I owe my Yank Sing-loving, ABC friends an apology. By the way, I'm thinking of naming my kids Madison and Connor.

Let me first say I've never dim summed in Millbrae/Daly City, and haven't been to Hong Kong since I was 3, so I don't know if Yank Sing matches the best places in those hotbeds.

And their cooking is also better than that of any other dim sum joint I've been to - even the difficult items, like wu gok, were flawlessly prepared.

Here's what I remember having:\n\nwu gok - delicately crisp, by far the best I've had\nsiu mai - really good, salty and porky, among the best I've had not made by my Mum\nshallot pancakes - not something I usually have, very good as far as I can tell\nhar gow - good but should've been better if this was the dish they charged us $7.70 for; shrimp was fresh but not wow fresh\nspare ribs - just OK\nchicken feet - bad, spice was really toned down: why Americanise this of all dishes?\n\nAdvice: if you suspect something's expensive, ask the price.", "author": "Brad L."}

I tried to steer him towards Ton Kiang, the bf and I's favorite Sunday morning dim sum place, but he was adamant about Yank Sing.\n\nThe food was good (barring the grotesque, how can you ever hate dim sum?), and the atmosphere was nice.  However, nearby parking meant a quarter for every five minutes, and I was quite shocked to see our tab coming in around $120.  A gorging meal at Ton Kiang, without alcohol, usually results in about $30 for a couple of people.\n\nI have admittedly not sampled every dim sum joint in SF*, but I think one would be better off at Ton Kiang - if anything, I think the food at Ton Kiang is better, and it certainly is a lot cheaper.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-10-21", "description": "This place is superb it's no ordinary dim sum this is straight out of Hong Kong quality yam tza.\n\nI came up to the City this weekend from Palo Alto to visit my sister for the weekend. I have been to Yank Sing a lot since it is a family favorite. Not until recently did I have a chance to peek at the bill. wow, dim sum for 3 for $80.00!!\n\nHere is why its worth it:\n\nFirst of all, its in SOMA. I mean the Fairy Building serves fish and chips for $17.50.  So you got to expect the price to be high. You are in a nice neighborhood, it doesn't smell like china town with that odd mixture of rotting garbage and good food. It smells fresh, its in a  part of San Francisco where the some comes out a lot. Prices are going to be higher for that reason. I mean, there are million dollar apartments around you.\n\nAnd you have to talk about the quality of dim sum. Yes, I admit I have had better dim sum before, in Hong Kong. Each piece of dim sum is smaller then the dim sum peaces at places around the bay area. And you might be confused and start thinking that they are trying to rip you off  by using less filling in the dim sum. I can see that happening in this super sized culture we have created in the US. They aren't trying to cut the portions, its how dim sum should be. Tightly packed with pork or shrimp not filled with fillers like corn starch. The quality of dim sum is really high.\n\nService, last week I went to dim sum with a non-asian friend of mine. She asked why the waitresses were so rude. My simple reply was, \"it's dim sum you aren't paying for service, you are paying for dim sum.\" Well, thats not the case here! Excellent service, I mean really superb. They speak multiple dialects of Chinese and you don't have to worry about them not being able to make out your English like you do in China Town. There was an old Jewish couple at the table next to us and they got served just fine. Speaking of being served. The carts come fast, there is no waiting for the cart with the dim sum to come around to your table, it's there. And! if it's not? Every cart serves has a headset and you can ask them for whatever you want and the order goes through the headset and comes in less then a minute. Ridiculously awesome.\n\nThe place is clean, super clean. This is authentic Chinese fine dining-- no fusion involved. This is something you see straight out of Hong Kong, a restaurant equivalent to a nice steak place here, culturally different of course. This is why things are a little pricier, the dim sum places you find in China Town are equivalent to going to Denny's for steak or maybe at best Outback Steak House, you get my point.\n\nAnyways, enough with defending the price, here is my latest experience:\n\nIt was a nice Sunny Saturday morning here in SOMA, we were headed out for brunch then, we were going to head over the the fairy building for farmers market, we stuck to the basics:\n\nSui Mai - Har Gau - Lo Bak Goh - Wu Gock - Pai Gaut - Nua mi fun\nhttp://chinesefood.abo...\n\nThey also had these really good Taiwanese dumplings called - xiao long bao. Goodness I haven't had xiao long bao since I was in Taiwan.\n\nAnd to top it off we had some Pan Friend crispy noodle- which came with a generous portion of seafood, I mean, really good stuff.\n\nSatisfied we paid and bought two jars of their house made hot sauce and we were on our way, full and satisfied.\n\nSo there you go, $80 bucks, great service, superb food; 5 stars for sure.\n\nnote: Don't get me wrong, I love going to china-town too. I really am not all posh and stuck-up as this review makes me out to be, there just needs to be a clarification of what this place is all about.", "author": "Steve L."}

We brought friends and their kids here recently as a special treat.  We had a great time.  They have a house-special dumpling that is sort of a round shaped Fun Gor with a mini amount of won ton broth sealed right into the dumpling.  You eat it on a Chinese soup spoon so that you don't lose the broth when you first bit into it.  Wonderful flavors and texture and you wont find this at many other places if any.  Also the single serving Peking Duck is almost worth the price of admission.  4 out of the 8 in our party had some and it was hoovered down so quickly I barely had time to take a snapshot.  The Siu Mai and Har Gow were delicious.  As were the other dumplings.  We did not even get to try them all.  We also had a piece of baked Sea Bass.  Delicious.  And the Nor Mai Gai (sticky rice in bamboo leaf) was just a touch more refined and a bit more tasty than your usual.  Two orders of potstickers were consumed by the kids.  But nothing extra special about those.  We also had chrysanthemum tea with our dim sum.  And we finished with Don Tart - traditional baked custard tarts that were fresh out of the oven.  If you like Don Tart then you will love theirs.  As good as any you will get in town.  But if you are not a Don Tart fan already then you can pass.\n\nThis is a fun fun place to have dim sum, especially if you're enjoying a special occasion with friends.  And that we were.  Joy ghin.

And I wasn't impressed with Yank Sing.\n\nOverpriced dim sum that tasted fine, but nothing spectacular. I saw more creative / fusion-y dim sum dishes that I think would cater more towards an American crowd, but that's not what I go to a dim sum place for. My friends and I paid $18 per person for lunch, and we weren't even full enough. It's a good idea to check with the servers to see how much each dish costs before you decide to get it. Some of them are just ridiculous. \n\nI will say, however, that the service is great. And the servers can generally speak pretty good english. And they have nifty clear glass teapots. \n\nBut overall, I'd rather go someplace else with cheaper, better, more traditional Chinese food, even if that means a restaurant that's not as pretty with servers shouting in raucous cantonese.", "author": "Lisa M."}

We spent over $100 for 4 people on just dim sum alone? Yeah. Two times more than what we normally spend at a dim sum place.\n\nYou'll definately see unique items that you can't find at other dim sum establishments, but I can't say they're as authentic seeing as though they're trying to do the fancy fusion thing to please other crowds of people other than Chinese customers. Also, none of our dishes were hot, but rather at room temp, while others were cold.\n\nTheir banquet food is pretty good though. I've been here for two weddings and the food was quite tasty on both occasions. It's a nice set up for a special occasion esp w/the water coming down like a waterfall in the middle of the banquet. \n\nThe prices here are on the high end, but still worth one visit.

It is on my repertoire of take outs at lunch time, especially when i need a Chinese food fix (when feeling hung over/ tired/ feeling under the weather in general!).\n\nAs I partaked in some mid-week par-taying last night, today's YS 2 Go order was; \n1x small hot & sour soup\n1x YS Express pack - chow mien, steamed pork bun and pot sticker\n\nTo be honest the food isn't all that bad - have had much worst in rural towns of Australia - it is, however, Chinese for westerners.\n\nThe hot & sour soup is neither spicy or sour enough... it is disappointing since the US consumer has, generally, a preference for strong flavours! it could be such a big seller if they dial up the heat and use of vinegar!\n\nHot & Sour Soup is one of my favourite Northern Chinese cuisines  and have tasted many versions around the world (western and eastern countries)... the YS version needs a little more work. What they did get right in the soup was all the required bits floating in a gravy like broth... tofu, sliced fungi, strips of pork, bamboo etc.\n\nThe steamed pork bun I got in my lunch pack was so NOT a pork bun. The filling is too sweet (common westernised Chinese food problem) and the bread is definitely not fluffy enough... nor was it the correct shape.\n\nThe pot sticker was OK - the meat not moist enough. It is an item that really shouldn't be in a to go pack... should only be eaten when its still in the steam pot.\n\nThe chow mien... liberal use of onions and celery (very Chinese!). The flavour is good - I don't like my food salty and its the right level for me. They did give me the pack with 2 packets of soy sauce... can see many dousing the noodles with it.\n\nAs a whole - I am satisfied  with a full belly on this cold, wet Friday. It is a decent feed but no way I'll be taking my HK Chinese parents there (or choose to go there on a weekend).", "author": "Joyce L."}

There could be nothing so satisfying to start our food-filled weekend. This is worth the flight just for lunch at Yank Sing. \n\nRecommended by a former resident of the city, we arrived at 12 noon on a Friday, and realized we were right in the middle of the lunch crush of the Financial District. We were asked to wait 15 minutes, so we went for a short walk in the mist. When we returned, there was a line out the door. We had to wait for an additonal 15 minutes, but the smell of the food was intoxicating. We had picked out half a dozen items we wanted to try by the time our table was ready. The hostesses were extremely gracious, apologetic, and thankful for our patience. The service was prompt and very pleasant. \n\nThis place was hopping! As soon as we sat down, the parade of carts of steaming hot dumplings started whizzing by. We had to start refusing things, because within 2 minutes we had 20 dumplings on the table to consume, and we couldn't eat fast enough! Not only are there dumplings, but lettuce wraps, duck, egg rolls, and much, much more, all available to size-up before comitting to a plate of 3-6.\n\nThe highlights, the scallop dumpling skewers, shrimp and mushroom crescents, and their signature Shanghai dumplings, also know as the soup dumpling for the succulent liquid that envelopes the pork. Make sure you ask the waiter to show you the proper way to eat it, or it will end up on your lap!  Har gao (shrimp) were also filled with LOTS of perfectly ground shrimp. And the pot stickers were delicious with a perfect balance of steamy stickiness and crispy bottoms.", "author": "Joni J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-10-15", "description": "This dim sum establishment is widely reputed to be the best around; my visit failed to reveal the reason for this acclaim.  While the dim sum is certainly fresh (probably the key feature of good dim sum) and generally well-done, I found little to distinguish it from any number of places in S.F. or elsewhere.  Some dishes, such as soft shell crab, are unusual to find in a dim sum menu, but nothing to go out of one's way for.  \n\n  The quality was all over the map: the soup dumplings (aggressively pushed by the waitress as \"best in the house\") were an enjoyable version of a Shanghai staple seldom seen stateside.  Peking duck was also delicious, though the minuscule portion was a bit disappointing.  On the other hand, shiu mai, a ubiquitous dim sum staple, were bland, underseasoned, and totally forgettable.  \n\n  One category in which Yank Sing unquestionable excels is price: theirs are astronomical for a dim sum joint.  I had tea and dim sum.  No wine or beer.  The bill was sixty bucks.  Just for me.  I was dining alone.  It was sixty bucks.  \n\n  Now, dim sum is unusual in restaurant dining in that prices are generally not printed on a menu, but tallied at the end of the meal based on how many dishes you had.  Thus, price is truly an afterthought, unless you ask.  With the multiple dishes ordered from multiple servers in dim sum service, this would be unreasonable and annoying, so I assumed that their prices would be on a par with other dim sum joints.  I also assumed that the chunk of fish (\"sea bass\" or \"sweet bass,\" I couldn't be sure) I had wouldn't be anywhere near fifteen bucks.  Wrong again.  \n\n  In summary, Yank Sing serves B+ grade dim-sum in a nice setting, at unreasonable prices.  You can do better (or at least no worse) and have more fun for less money if you investigate some of the city's more hole-in-the-wall establishments, avoiding both the beaten path and the long wait for a table.", "author": "Nate S."}

But I found the service spotty.  When we first arrived, they carts came by about every 4 seconds making it difficult to make decisions and more importantly, difficult to eat anything.  Then, later on, when we were interested in getting more food, no one came by for 10-15 minutes.  I understand there were baskets on the table, but they were empty and we were still hungry.  Then, we specifically asked for several dishes, and it was clear that they forgot about our request despite telling someone to bring the dishes over into their little microphones (which I'm convinced are fake - they're just trying to look cool like Secret Service agents).  \r\n\r\nI thought the dim sum was good - but nothing above and beyond any other good dim sum place.  But clearly, the price is exceptional, and it's easy at dim sum to rack up a larger bill than you intend.  The sea bass was excellent, everyone raved over that one even though we almost didn't get it because it isn't typical dim sum.

She loved this so much - I am a vegetarian with shrimp allergies and I told her she would have to eat all the meaty type things or take them home because I wouldn't be able to eat them.  I thought she would get a takeout box BUT she ate everything that she ordered!  We had the Xiao long pao, 3 different kinds of vegetarian dumplings, the shrimp hakka, and the pork siu mei.  They also bring a fish dish by and try to get you to order it - it does look very good but if you are on a budget, keep in mind that it is a $22 dish.  The place is very clean, and if you don't have reservations, I suggest arriving before 11:30 am to get seated.  I liked that they have a huge selection of vegetarian dumplings and they have radios so they can call in what you want and whoever has that tray will walk by so you can order it.  While I eat dim sum fairly frequently, I don't go very often to yank sing simply because i usually go on weekends, and it's hard for me to get to the city on weekends and also it is on the pricier side so I would only go here with one or two other persons and not a big group (which is usually how our Saturday dim sum sessions work out),  but it's a treat when i do go and well worth it (especially when on the company dime!)", "author": "Bebe W."}

(If you're in Toronto, though, make sure you get to Shanghai Dim Sum in Markham!) \nHowever, we also had a lot of other dishes. The chive pancake was bland and disappointing, but most everything else was good or great, with the chicken skewers as a surprise hit. But not as much of a surprise as the bill. \nHoly Toledo! We had foolishly, very foolishly, not looked at the menu prices before eating. We go for dim sum a lot and in a lot of different places (Toronto, New York, Chicago, etc.) so we just assumed it would cost about as much as usual, maybe $10 to $15 per person. Oops!  This place is expensive. Moreover, dishes we're used to thinking of as fairly cheap weren't. $9 gets you a double portion (6) of pot stickers, but $12 only gets you four skinny fried shrimp rolls?

Growing up in Canton, I am a total dim sum snob and I went to Yank Sing out of its reputation.  It was a total disappointment.  It was very much Americanized (and maybe that is why many people think it is good).  If you want more authentic dim sum, I would recommend the Canton Dim Sum Seafood Restaurant down on Hawthorne and Folsom, much more authentic and good dim sum.  \n\nYes, the serving staff in Yank Sing speaks English, but so what, most other Chinese restaurants' staff do too.  If that is more important than food quality then you probably would choose Yank Sing (or better, eat at home and turn on your TV).  Yank Sing has relatively good ambience, but to me, it is a little over done and commercial.  It is in a good location, convenient for business lunch to please your clients.

I initially gave one star because I was so pissed about the bill and I am not used to paying so much for Chinese food.   But when you think about it, the food was great (and well made), the service was good, I loved the green tea and the restaurant is very nice... except the pricing which is not listed anywhere.

If the prices were right, you could have gotten 5 stars.\n\nI am a fan of this place but I cannot afford to eat there haha.  So I will probably not come back (unless my boss is paying) and instead go to Canton on Folsom street as usual.

Dim sum was great.  But when the bill arrived, I almost dropped my chop sticks!!! $99.60 for 3 people??? You must be kidding me.  I never paid 38 dollars (w the tip) for lunch in my life.  I would go broke if I had such lunches all the time.  \n\nBack to Canton Dim Sum on Folsom street.  It's only two blocks another direction (on Folsom between 2nd and 3rd).  We go there all the time but we were heading to Osha's on Christmas Eve to discover that they were closed, so Yank Sing was our random choice. We get take outs there sometimes (which are around $10)  but never dined in until today.  A big mistake!  Who can afford to eat there?

It's a great place to get a cross-section of the city's diverse population, and I think you'll feel at home, even spoiled by the staff.\n\nAdvice: go early, like others say, and pace yourself for heaven's sake. Don't get every single dish you lust after...but choose carefully or else you'll have a table full of half eaten dishes! Dim sum is best shared with friends so you can try everything that way too. There is an a la cart menu as well, so don't feel shy about asking for chow mein/fried rice if you really want some too.

What made it worse was the bill at the end and it just really wasn't value for money.\n\nHaving spent time in Hong Kong for a few years, I am pretty used to dim sum being pushed around on a trolley cart although it's slowing being phased out now. So I was kind of happy to see it still being done this way here at Yank Sing in San Francisco because I feel that it adds to the whole dim sum experience. However, I've not ever encountered being pushed to order food before. It's like the waiters here have been in intensive training in hard selling. I was barely able to eat and chat without a lady telling me how tasty everything was on her push cart. I think in total I'd ordered around 10 dishes or possibly even more, I'd lost count... it was like a blur... one minute I'd arrived and the next I had a table full of dim sum in front of me. Secondly, the food was mediocre at best, some of the dishes were just wrong. I enjoyed the glutinous rice and the steamed pork ribs (which isn't usually something I would order) but everything else was disappointing. The sea bass which was one of the dishes I was compelled to take was okay but pricey (I actually think I said no but somehow this meant yes here!). Some dishes looked over steamed. The texture to the Turnip cake and Siu Mai were just plain wrong.\n\nMaybe I'd just gone on a bad day as some people seem to really enjoy it and have given it a great review. I mean, some even claim it to be the best dim sum restaurant in San Francisco so I may have to give this another try in the future.

They all wear little ear pieces to communicate so they can be more attentative and work at a faster pace.  They come around once in a while and fill your tea pot and to make sure everything is ok. They pay attention to what you say cause I overheard a customer at a different table say to a server that he doesn't eat pork. The server immediately as he walked away quietly into his mouthpiece  and told the other servers that that table does not eat pork, so therefore, do not ask them if they'd like any dim sum containing pork in it. i thought to myself...WOW..thats so cool. it makes it so much easier for the customer. \n\nWe ordered sew mai, fong jow, chuarng fun, xiao long bao(shanghai dumplings...YUM), and  egg rolls.

You owe it to yourself as a capitalist to go there.  \n\nThe shangai pork dumplings (the ones with soup in them) were excellent and they give you about 5 per order, so that's not bad.  The vegetable dumplings are tasty as well as the chicken and mushroom.  It's a good place, and it would get 5 stars if it were in KC, DC, or Miami.\n\nHere are the problems I had:\nFirst of all, we had phoned in a reservation for a party of eight at 12:15.  Naturally, the place is packed, so we felt all smug for calling it in.  However, we had to wait an extra 35 min. before our table was ready.  35 min is a long time waiting outside, especially when they give you bullshit excuses like, \"the table is being set\", and it takes another 20 min.  \n\nSecondly, if you sit in the patio, after some of the lunch crowds leave, there's damn pigeons flying around everywhere.  I'm as serious as a heart attack.  One was flying around the restaurant and brushed the back of my neck with it's feathers.  I was lucky it didn't crap on me.  Then it starts eating the left overs on the table next to us.  Another one was feeding from another table.  Gross.  I would be forgiving, but the wait staff didn't care.

Not enough chives.  was a vaguely shrimpy paste. TEH SUCK\r\n6) yam wrapped cod:  eh, not bad.\r\n7) chinese broccoli:  SUCKED BALLS.  HOW CAN YOU SCREW THIS UP?!?!?!?  All you do is drop the frickin vegetable into boiling water, pull it out, and put oyster sauce on it.  This was COLD.  Not just room temp, but COLD, as if they did it intentionally, or they just mass produced it and put it in the fridge.  Chinese broccoli is more bitter when it's cold, ruining the flavor balance.  It also didn't have enough oyster sauce, and the oyster sauce HAD NO FLAVOR.  WTF?!?\r\n8) pot stickers:  bleh, below average, but not too bad.\r\n9) mango pudding:  SUCKED.  Not enough mango.  Tasted more like mango yogurt than pudding.\r\n10) Oolong tea.  BAD, but not as bad as teabag tea.  Bleh, more black tea like.  This is coming from a taiwan tea snob, and we love our oolong in taiwan.\r\n11) Jasmine tea.  BAD.  Why can't they just get some cheap stuff from Ten ren?  Dimsum is just snacks.  the whole experience is called YAM CHA = YIN CHA = DRINK TEA.  The measure of a good \"dim sum\" restaurant is the quality of the tea.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it.  AWESOME xiao long bao brings this up from 1 star (crappy food for high prices) to 2.\r\nif you want REAL YAMCHA, go to KOI PALACE in Daly City, or if you don't want to deal with the crowd, go to FOOK YUEN in Millbrae.", "author": "Fong L."}

The shrimp egg rolls were also a nice surprise with shrimp, potato and spices inside instead of the usual lettuce or cabbage.  They also had a really crispy shell that was not too greasy.\n\nThe service was great and the waitresses/waiters were very friendly and helpful. \n\nThe only down side to this place is that it was a little pricey for dim sum--it ended up being about $60 with tip for two.

They are obviously totally different experiences so I'll note both separately.\nDim Sum Restaurant:  Really, really good dim sum and by that I mean tons of volume so lots of fresh food, but if you like dim sum you know you are getting salt, grease, carbs - deliciously so, but it is what it is.  But the food and variety is outstanding.  I partciularly like the duck , the chicken lettuce cups and the Chilean sea bass, but of course like all the dumplings as well, especially the shitake mushroom steamed ones. Yum! These onion rings they have are just fab as well. The service is efficient, sometimes a bit alarmingly so, as they really try and move you through their fast. But for a business lunch that is generally appreciated.  Worth a lunch if you are in the financial district/SOMA area and a great place for a big group lunch.  Big lines without a reservation so plan ahead - and bring your wallet as it is NOT cheap - I never get out of here for less than $40-50 a head.\nYank Sing2Go: I must go here at least once a week.  They have 6 types of combos that include dim sum choices and either a chicken salad, chow mein or fried rice, plus a couple of a la carte items and soup.  Very simple and quick and good -- again you know what you are getting if you are looking for simple dim sum, so don't exactly expect the healthy option. But the food is fresh and quickly prepared and very, very reasonably priced.  The combos are $5-7 each and the additional items are $1-2 each. Well worth a stop in if you want an option different than sandwiches for lunch.  They have an outdoor heated seating area for the take out too, and obviously the way more affordable version of the dim sim sit down restaurant but don't expect the fancy stuff - dumplings, noodles and soup and that is it.  But  a great financial district lunch option for sure.", "author": "Kirsten M."}

The seafood and pork seemed more abundant and flavorful, and the vegetables, especially the snowpea dish, tasted very fresh. \n\nMy favorite dish was the shanghai dumplings. The lady showed me how i was supposed to eat it, with pouring the vinegar on top and all. And boy was it great. As soon as you put it into your mouth, the dumpling breaks open and the broth mixes with the vinegar to create a really tasty first impression. The pork was good as well, and the dumpling part was very well done, not too thick and chewy. Just right.\n\nI would probably come here again, as the food was pretty good.

I didn't have breakfast so I could eat and yes it lasted all day and ready to roll on my way home.\n\nThe dumplings are huge but it was a little bland. It did not speak to me like some of the dim sum I tasted before. I have been in both places - seat down, to go and brunch but for some reason, it was not as good as if I was eating inside. \n\nI've always ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and this one I love because the sauce is mixed with wasabi.

I don't even need to go beyond the shrimp dumplings to get my fix.  When I am in Hong Kong, my no-fail answer for \"What do you want for lunch?\" is dim sum.  So, I wanted to love Yank Sing.  I really did.  But, it was just OK, and really expensive.  The atmosphere was nice, i.e. the tablecloths were clean and it was well-lit.   The unintelligible and kind of cranky servers came around constantly, just like they do in Hong Kong.  But the variety was pretty limited and only one thing really stood out for me which was the steamed sea bass.  Which when you think about it is not very dim sum-y, so I don't know if I'd return just to have that.  I don't really understand the hype with this particular restaurant - maybe there were secret things I was supposed to know to order?  And why was the only vegetable offered pea pods?", "author": "Liz S."}

Perfectly made, served hot and fresh  and they offer vegetarian options. To some hard core dim sum-ers, this may not be an issue. But for me it is. I'm a texture guy and when I bite into dim sum that has foreign parts (like cartilage or bone) I'm immediately turned off. This place give you \"pure\" meat parts. That didn't sound right, but I think you get the idea. I've been to hundreds of dim sum places and it never fails that I end up eating something I didn't order. I'm also really allergic to shellfish (I know, sucks). So when I order a pork dumpling, I expect to only eat pork. Not always the case when entering a dim sum place.

There was a great variety to choose from and everything we tried was fresh, but it just didn't taste like anything special. It was just OK. As mentioned by others, you have to pay for your tea which is complimentary in most chinese places. The pot stickers and pork buns had more dough than filling and the shanghai dumplings were good but cost $10(!!!).

(IMO, a good dimsum joint does the classics well, and mixes in a couple of excellent signature items.)\n\nand yeah, it's definitely on the expensive side.  so you leave a little lighter in the wallet, but not sickly full of grease and salt like other dimsum joints - and to me, that's worth the extra cost.", "author": "brian w."}

But we decided to brave Yank Sing again at the Rincon Center and were very pleasantly surprised (at least until we got the bill). Now, we get dim sum every week or two, and it typically runs us about $25 to $35...from what I remembered of Yank Sing, I expected this bill to be about $50-$60 for the two of us. Uh, no.\n\nThe restaurant was already packed by the time we arrived at 11:30 on a Sunday morning. The setting was very nice if a bit sterile and corporate, and the servers were all uniformed in crisp, clean uniforms. The food was surprisingly good and arrived at the table piping hot (luckily, we were seated near the kitchen which in a dim sum restaurant is a good thing). Standouts included the haw gao, shiu mai, and steamed spareribs...all were seasoned perfectly and were impeccably fresh. The star of the show, however, were a relatively new menu item (they weren't on the menu the last time we were here)...the Xiao Long Bao (XLB). Now, there was no reason to expect that they would be very good here, which is really more of a spot for tourists and \"gwei-lo\" (white devils, lol). Furthermore, dim sum is a Cantonese creation and XLB are Shanghainese. Nevertheless, these soup dumplings were absolutely fantastic. The wrapping was properly thin, and they were burstingly plump with scalding soup. Absolutely delicious...we immediately had to order another portion (6 dumplings)! Yumm!\n\nThe fried softshell crab was less successful...it had to be special-ordered (and took quite a while) but still arrived lukewarm. I really did not care for the mushrooms stuffed with chicken, which were also cold but were flavorless to boot. We concluded with some beautiful mah cho, fried sesame balls filled with lotus seed paste. These were fresh from the fryer and still hot and crispy. Soooo good. \n\nUp until this point, we were thinking this was the best dim sum experience we'd had in years. The food was great and the service was actually friendly and efficient, a rarity in a Chinese restaurant. Then came the bill...WTF????\n\nShamefully, I am an illiterate ABC (American-born Chinese for you Gwei-los) and could not really decipher the intricate code on the bill. After extensive analysis, we concluded that the XLB were $21.50 each (!) and the crab was $17.50 (!). Gulp. \n\nOh well, lesson learned. We  had a delicious meal and wonderful service in an elegant setting. Yank Sing is the perfect place to take Americans who may otherwise be nervous about exploring the nearby Chinatown and the everpresent grunge. I found the dim sum to be far superior to Ton Kiang in the Richmond district, and the XLB was head and shoulders above that from Shanghai Dumpling King (this place has really gone down hill). Yes, Yank Sing is expensive. But for really good food, can't Junior just go to community college? I miss Harbor Village.", "author": "Jason K."}

But after that, take your time and consider what you want. Tea is lovely. My recommendations: sea bass (to die for), lotus chicken, the fried shrimp, green beans if you're in the mood for healthy eating....well there are many, many things that are good. Its expensive but worth every penny. Bypass the fruit, puddings, and sesame ball deserts and go for the incredible pistachio ice cream pie. Its incomparable. And another secret, the pie they carry around on the cart? its fake! \n\nIf there is something you want, just ask,  the staff is equipped with headset walkie talkies to put out an APB for the food that you desire :-) If you don't know exactly, you can use words like \"steamed,\" \"chicken,\" \"fried,\" etc. Service is generally kind, lovely, and friendly.\n\nThis place is a real treat.

The cabbage salad with candied walnuts and a light citrus dressing is a great way to start. I am a huge fan of the pork bun which is just perfect here. The rice squares, pork, spicy beans, spring rolls and pretty much anything fried is just a tasty treat.

A friend and I ate here once, and we had to watch our spending and didn't eat as much as we might have, and the bill was still about $25 per person, which is way too much for dim sum. They sell those nifty glass teapots, which is a good gift idea. They take reservations, which besides always being a good idea, are best made. The best things to order here are the char siu bao, the soft-shell crabs, and the Shanghai xiao long bao (aka soup dumplings). This place closes at 3PM, so no dinner. They have another branch in Rincon Center, at 101 Spear St, which used to be Wu Kong (quite large, enough for wedding banquets). Yank Sing was founded in 1958.

Although, this is a dim sum restaurant it is not the type of dim sum restaurant I am accustom to. I should have known when I walked into the restaurant and there were only a couple of Asian customers. The restaurant is super tiny and very very crowded with every race other than Asian. I still wonder how the employees manage to drive the food carts around with out hurting someone. It is a somewhat trendy atmosphere. The restaurant also has an outdoor seating area, but please be aware that along with the patio sitting you will have the ugliest crows eating with you. The crow situation is so bad that the employees kept apologizing for the bird situation. I was also unhappy that the employees pushing the dim sum carts were pushy. Five of the employees would bombard you at the same time and at times they would just place the dim sum on the table without you agreeing to accept the dim sum. Last, I thought it was over priced for just your average dim sum. I am very happy to pay good money for delicious food, but the food was average. I was disappointed when I asked for one tiny piece of fried duck. The small piece of fried duck was smaller than the size of a miniature hot wing and they charged me $5.00 for that one single piece. There was three of us for lunch and the bill came out to $130.00 and we had very few dim sum plates. I walked away still starving. Maybe, I am a little prejudice because I am a Latina girl married to an Asian man and he has taken me to the BEST dim sum restaurants in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. Unfortunately, that day my husband was not with me. I will never return to Yank Sing when I have many other authentic and delicious dim sum restaurants to choose from.", "author": "arlinda k."}

I wish I had discovered it before the last few months I had in the Bay Area before moving to Phoenix because boy, do I miss it now! Yes, it's expensive (my husband and I spent about $70 for lunch, including tax and tip), and yes, some of the dishes are not the most authentic, but every dish I tried was flavorful, savory, enjoyable, and delicious! The real standouts were the Peking duck (they give you pieces of duck with crispy skin, buns, scallions, and Hoisin sauce), the spicy green beans, the shrimp dumplings, the sesame balls, and the honey walnut shrimp (sounds typical, but the coating on the shrimp was extra crispy and not overly sweet, and the dish comes with a lemon wedge, which adds an unexpected but delicious twist). Another great thing about this place is that it's busy enough to have a sustained flow of carts going around with fresh, hot food; I personally hate dim sum places where the same carts go circling around and no new items come out in the 30 minutes to an hour that you're there.
