However, after visiting, I don't think that's the case. I came for breakfast/brunch on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, right when they first opened for the day (around 9 am). My server was attentive and friendly while dealing with multiple customers throughout my visit.\n\nI decided on the huevos rancheros (no beans) and loved it! The portion was large, every bite was tasty and the price was right. The eggs were perfectly cooked to over easy and nothing was over-salted (happens often with this dish). I highly recommend this meal to anyone. \n\nI had a 15 percent off coupon from the San Fran welcome center (food only), which was one of the reasons I stopped here and I'm so glad I did. Realistically, when the discount is only on food it took one to two dollars off of my meal, which isn't a big deal, but was enough to make me stop in and give this place a try. \n\nThe bathrooms are unisex and leave a bit to be desired, minor detail. This place is large and can fit a good deal of people. It wasn't busy when I was there, but I could see how it would fill up quickly on a weekend night.", "author": "Emily D."}

However, it only took 5-10 minutes for them to call us. We got a table outside by the boardwalk so that was very nice. (The only not-nice, but also uncontrollable part is that the pigeons were flying left and right). \n\nFor food, we each order the fried seafood combo ($17.90ish each (w/o tax), which comes with a cod, 3 shrimps on a stick, and a lot of calamari. With fries, a small side of coleslaw and 3 types of sauce for each of the seafood. The Asian chicken sauce (if you know what I'm talking about) was for the calamari. The cocktail sauce was for the shrimps. The tar-tar sauce was for the cod. Both the calamari and the shrimps' batter (outside) were very light, which is amazing. So you can really taste the meat. The fish was okay, not mindblowing. The tartar sauce was tasteless and I think it did a disservice to my cod experience. The coleslaw and the fries were also tasteless. So the tasteless things on my plate took out 1 star from my review. Out of everything on the plate, the calamari was my favorite.\n\nFor the drink, I ordered the Shark Bite and my friend ordered \"something California\" (forgot the name). These are from the bottom left corner of the menu. The drinks were good. I couldn't really taste the alcohol or feel it. The drinks are huge though, but it's nice and cool and sweet, a good combination with the food. \n\nThe service was great. They were attentive and came to check-in on us multiple times. We really enjoyed our time there.", "author": "Yuan Z."}

The bun was nice and soft, only thing was the inside of the burger kept slipping out every time I took a bite so I was looking like a hot mess with hella napkins around me lol. But it was pretty good, I killed the entire thing! \n\nThen our son had a slice of cheese pizza which he liked and ate for the most part. Nothing too fancy, just a regular piece of pizza. \n\nThere was a lot of seating area, table and benches. Napkin holders on each table. A separate small area with utensils next to the TO GO van.

It's something I'm getting used to while being in California. The Garlic Pizza Bread is a great tasting starter. \n\nFor my lunch I ordered the delicious Grilled Salmon Bowl. This was filled with fresh saut\u00e9ed veggies and get this- coconut rice, not plain rice, not brown rice but COCONUT rice. Do you see my amazement? Well, it's because anyone could've put this dish on plain white rice and called it a day but no the creator of the menu put some brains behind it and used his/her culinary degree. Who says tourist places don't offer good food? I beg to differ. This dish also had teriyaki sauce which offered a great balance. \n\n\n** just a little note** this whole area has great shops with good prices, live music, boat tours, retro/classic arcade, Seals docked and talking :) and a bus ride away from China Town.", "author": "Carrie K."}

We checked out the Hard Rock Cafe, but the wait was like ten hours, and the food was pricey. The Wipeout Grill was close, so we decided to check it out. It was a beautiful day in San Francisco, and it was summertime, so the Pier was packed with people. The wait time wasn't bad considering how many people there were. Atmosphere is fun and touristy. My daughter was taken aback by the bikini girl statue out front. \n\nThe service was pretty good, and we didn't have to wait forever for our food. I had a plate with fried calamari and fried fish. The sweet cocktail sauce was ok, but the regular cocktail sauce was great. The coleslaw has  pineapple in it or something, but it wasn't anything to Yelp about. Wife got the clam chowder bread bowl, she was quite satisfied with it. The calamari tasted fresh--it was tender and just the right amount of chewy. I chowed down and grossed my kids out at the same time. Son enjoyed the chili dog. Other son enjoyed the quesadilla. \n\nClearly there are better places for seafood around the area, but if you want some touristy fun on Pier 39, Wipeout will serve you well. I would go back there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-11", "description": "The colorful exterior, fun atmosphere, and obvious popularity of this place coaxed us into choosing Wipeout for dinner while visiting San Francisco and finding ourselves hungry while strolling around the area. \n\nThe location is great and easy to find, and the restaurant is huge, offering lots of seating. There is a prominent island-theme to the restaurant that adds to the fun atmosphere here. When we arrived, there were quite a few parties waiting outside so we anticipated a wait, but were pleasantly surprised when the waitress took us right back to a large booth. The menus here are pretty large with lots of food choices, but I will note that the prices were high for what you get. This being our first day of vacation, we decided to splurge on a specialty drink for $12. The drink was just okay-not very large and didn't taste very blended or smooth with not a lot of alcohol or flavor-a bit disappointing. Our food was okay also, but definitely not worth the high price as it really was nothing special nor large portions. \n\nOur server was okay, but could have been more attentive and friendly. He didn't seem to want to be there. My husband and I both ordered water with our meals and we noticed our server was the only one that served water in small/child-sized water glasses instead of the large/normal water glass. This was a bit frustrating, as we needed a few refills and always had to wait for him to not only notice our empty glasses, but it also took a long time to get our glasses back with the refill.\n\nOne thing it took us a bit to realize here was that there are no separate male and female bathrooms-just one joint bathroom. There was a long line of women for the bathroom we assumed was women's and my husband wondered around the restaurant looking for another (men's) bathroom, but after not having any luck, we realized men had now joined the bathroom line. This was confusing and could have been more clearly marked/labeled. I'm not a fan of joint bathrooms to begin with, but especially with how crowded the bathroom was, I would prefer them to be bigger and separate.\n\nFun atmosphere, but I don't think we'd return because of the high prices and less than friendly service.", "author": "Sarah K."}

It was a bit underwhelming though..the clam chowder wasn't anything special and the bread bowl wasn't fresh bread. Not a good bread:chowder ratio either. The fish and chips were standard. Cole slaw was good. The fried pickles were good but their \"chipotle ranch\" could pass as plain ol' ranch. One thing I did really enjoy was their chipotle hot sauce.

I'm not sure if I was just really hungry, but that was the best fish taco I've ever had, and that's comparing it to fish tacos in Ensenada. The steak was also pretty good, but the fish taco outperformed it so I didn't even care about the steak taco anymore. The beans were good, too. The rice, I wasn't too impressed with. It was probably the corn, but it tasted kinda sweet, which I didn't really enjoy that much.\nI wish I had ordered a drink because they looked delicious. They have these large drinks that are blended and are served sort of tiki style. I believe you can also order a drink of your choice and they still serve it in the same type of glass. I overhead a table next to mine ordering a Sex on the Beach and was served in that huge glass. Not sure if they made that request, or that's just the way they do it there.\n\nI wish I had also tried the fish and chips, too. They looked really appetizing, but I could only eat so much.

Were seated as soon as my name was taken and the waitress took our drink order right away. Then brought the drinks before any time passed. It was busy and most tables were full but the service was speedy without feeling rushed.\n\nBeing a bariatric patient, I almost always ask for a kid's menu and she happily obliged, no questions asked. Not many restaurants allow an adult to order off the menu without a long explanation or some sort of proof that one is on a bariatric diet or even at all. I immediately noticed that their kid's menu offered a grilled teriyaki salmon, coconut rice and veggie dish. How perfect is that?! I was leary though, as I've never had salmon but said, \"what the heck?! I'll try it\". I was NOT disappointed! The portion of salmon was tiny but enough to fill me up after a bite of rice and the veggies. I took most of it to go. \n\nMy husband and daughter both ordered the wipeout burger and upgraded to the blue cheese fries. They said it was all delicious and the patty was perfectly cooked to medium, just like they asked. \n\nMy son (mr picky) ordered their Cali burger (avocado, bacon and jack cheese) and upgraded to onion rings. He's never ordered a burger like this before as he's a bbq bacon type, usually. I was pleasantly surprised to see him enjoy that burger though. He said the bacon was perfect and he loved it all. \n\nThe burger and fry portions are huge! Definitely shareable for lighter eaters. Even my son, who cleans his plate (13 y/o), left food behind because he was so full. \n\nMy niece ordered the clam chowder in a bread bowl. She's also picky and only usually likes the clam chowder bowls from a little stand in Old Sacramento but said this one was amazing. She never finishes her food but scraped this bowl clean! \n\nOur drinks were never empty and our food was served surprisingly quickly considering how busy it was.

Very reasonable prices, great variety of foods for every one to select, quality selection of drinks. Atmosphere was great, positive vibes and great selection of chilled music, also we loved the colourful relaxed vibe of the restaurant. The welcoming atmosphere as soon as we arrived was great, the waiter/waitress named \"Dolly\" provided a great first impression, a very happy smiley face greated us with positive attitude to her job, gave us time to select what we wanted, always checked on table for extra drinks and to see if our food was hot and always ensured she checked on the table to see if we were all enjoying our meals. Coming from another country it was great to see someone do their job really and actually provide exceptional customer service and take pride on ensuring a great experience. Well done \"Dolly\" before we leave San Francisco we will be coming back to Wipe out bar and grill because of the first impression that was set.", "author": "Brett C."}

The staff was incredibly polite, and fast with bringing out our drinks and food. It was kinda busy, so we were super surprised to be able to eat so quickly. The food was absolutely delicious, and cooked to perfection. We had their cod fish n chips, which were a little greasy but sooo worth whatever the calories were, and a salmon BLT. It never occurred to us to combine our favorite fish with our favorite sandwich, but it was delicious and we're glad we ordered it. The staff was also super quick to refill our drinks, which is great. \nThe decor is funny, and very clever. From using surf boards as tables, to reusing Coors Light holders for condiments really reinforced the whole \"day at the beach\" feeling. The bathrooms were also great. Through a cute little beach tent, they have four unisex stalls (more like little rooms) which were very clean, and an area for everyone to wash their hands. \nThe only thing that kinda sucked, (pun intended) is that they use paper straws instead of plastic straws. While this is way better for the environment, and I dig that, they do kinda get soggy after a little while of drinking and need to be replaced.\nSo while the price is a little more then we wanted to spend, it is 100% worth it, and next time we visit San Francisco we will return here!", "author": "Jeremy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-07", "description": "When you have a tourist trap area like Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf in the most popular part of San Francisco, one might always assume that food & drink prices are absurdly inflated. Not to mention, some of these restaurants offer only mediocre quality food. Surprisingly, this isn't quite the case with \"Wipeout Bar & Grill\".\n\nAs far as getting to this restaurant (located in the heart of Pier 39), it is relatively easy to find as you will see giant wooden posts paired up with palm trees and surfboards, it almost looks like a place that should be in Malibu or Honolulu and not a cool climate like San Francisco. Forget about driving to this place; the parking garage is located a couple blocks away. My advice is to either walk, bike, take a cab, Muni bus, or trolley.\n\nThis is actually my second time dining here, however it is my first review on the place. I came here with my lady and our friend (who was celebrating her birthday over Labor Day weekend). We arrived around 5:30pm (on the afternoon of Sunday 9/4/16) and were told by the hostess it would be about a 35-minute wait. Unfortunately, this place does not provide the portable buzzers when your table is ready; nor do they text you. Not a big deal but staying near the restaurant hearing for someone to call your name can be challenging, especially since it is very loud inside.\n\nAnd speaking of the inside, you will find a fairly large and spacious dining area complete with a very surf-inspired theme to it. Some of the tables are even carved out as surfboards. And for the serious surf enthusiasts, there is also a chalkboard that lists the daily surf reports as well as shark attack reports. One thing I didn't really care for were the bathrooms. A restaurant this busy only had 3 toilets (with private doors) that are used by men & women while the sink is located outside. That's a bit odd if you ask me. The outside has plenty of seating to dine as well as fire pits for those cold, foggy San Francisco days.\n\nFortunately the wait time was only 20 minutes and we are all seated around 5:50pm. Our hostess (whom I forgot her name) was very friendly and had an awesome personality. We all ordered drinks, I was craving an iced cold beer so I went with a 20 oz. size of the Ballast Point Sculpin IPA. To eat, I decided on their \"Teriyaki Pineapple Chicken Sandwich\" (for $12.95). This consisted of a grilled chicken breast, teriyaki sauce, grilled pineapple and jack cheese served on a toasted bun. As my side of choice, I went the healthier route and went with a side salad w/vinaigrette dressing.\n\nAs busy as this place was, all three of us got our meals out in less than 15 minutes; I find that to be quite impressive. Now onto the food.. I actually enjoyed every bite of my pineapple chicken sandwich. It was flavored very well and was a very generous portion that filled me up very well. My lady ordered their \"Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl\" and she loved her meal as well. However, our friend (who wasn't that hungry) only went with the \"Coconut Fried Shrimp\" (which was priced at $10.95) and was not satisfied how small the amount of food was that she got. My entree (that was only a mere $2.00 more) had way more overall food. So it really depends on what you order that determines if you get your moneys worth or not.\n\nOverall, \"Wipeout Bar & Grill\" is a decent place that won't burn a hole in your pocket. They do serve breakfast, a huge variety of drinks (with a full bar & several beers on tap), and finally a decent dessert menu. And speaking of desserts, our friend (the birthday girl) had Happy Birthday sung to her and got complimentary chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. So all in all, its a solid 4-star dining experience, not the best place I've been to but far better than some of the other overpriced touristy restaurants in the area.", "author": "Donovan H."}

So, maybe it's unfair for me to review a place like this. I have no real complaints about the Wipeout Grille, but there's nothing local or special about it either. I could be in Galveston, Pensacola, or Virginia Beach and find a restaurant that would be indistinguishable from it except for the color scheme. The menu is long on choices and short on interest: burgers, nachos, pizza, tacos, generically Asian bowls, salads, sandwiches, and sea food all in one place. The margaritas are large and nicely priced. The beer is lowest common denominator. Our server, Jana, was attentive and helpful. The decor was predictably fishy. \n\nThe bathrooms were oddly unisex (toilets are private, with a shared wash area). Not a big deal, but I saw women in the line the first time and had that flash of terror a man has when he accidentally walks in the ladies room. \n\nI think I wanted something more distinctly west coast than I found here.

The coffee was super watered down, and the calamari was not the best, especially for the price.  The lava cake, you can't go wrong with though, that was good!", "author": "Precious Ethel P."}

The staff was very accommodating him to make sure we were able to see the beautiful day that was outside and all the bay's beauty. We were quickly ask what we would like for drinks, the server was back immediately with our order of iced tea and a soda. At that point our server asked if we were ready to order, as we were so we placed our order and in less than 10 minutes our order was at the table. \n\nThe food was excellent. The restrooms were very unique, but they were absolutely clean. The restaurant itself was well-maintained and clean. The staff was friendly, well groomed, and happy to be at work. We look forward to returning next year for San Francisco Fleet week.   So if you're in the area at the beginning of Pier 39, you must come here and either have breakfast lunch or dinner.

My boyfriend and I decided to visit Pier 39 and we actually walked all the way from Chinatown to the Pier (IT WAS A LONG WALK, TOOK FOREVER). Needless to say, when I got to the pier, I WAS STARVING!! Although I wanted seafood and a bowl of clam chowder, I decided to visit Wipeout because it was near me and I really couldn't walk any further before I put some food in my belly. The inside of the restaurant is very nice and close to the water, the tables were a little messy though because there were soooo many people! The place was jam packed with people that my boyfriend and I actually had to wait for around 15-20 minutes, which isn't bad. I ordered a strawberry lemonade because I am a lemonade FANATIC! My boyfriend ordered a burger, I forgot the name of the burger but it has avocado on top, bacon, and cheese. I settled on the BBQ chicken pizza and we also ordered the fried calamari. I am sooo sad that I forgot to take a photo of the fried calamari because the plate was HUGE!!! I am a big big fan of fried calamari and when the waiter brought the plate out, I almost fainted, it was pure bliss. I devoured the fried calamari, it was soooo delicious and yummy! When our entrees were brought out, I was already super full because of the calamari hahaha. My boyfriend gobbled up the burger in about 3 seconds, it was VERY TASTY!! The avocado and bacon really made the burger stand out. The BBQ chicken pizza was also REALLY REALLY finger-licking good, I would order both plates again. Overall, you can tell based on my gigantic review that I had a very good time at Wipeout Bar & Grill, and that I will surely be back! I highly reccomend this place people", "author": "Lulu T."}

The service was quite slow, even though they were pretty busy. However, we asked them for waters, but we didn't receive them til after out food came out, which also took a really long time. The server was not sympathetic, but it could have been because she was busy.\n\nI ended up ordering a Corona-rita (Corona beer with a margarita) and a half salad half clam chowder. The Corona-rita was pretty good. I have had it before at other places and this one wasn't as sweet, which I liked. Most places put too much sweet and sour and its like drinking sweet tarts. Yuck! The salad on the side was pretty lame, literally nothing special about it. The clam chowder in the bread bowl was ok, just like the rest of the meal, nothing special and a little bland.\n\nThe rest of my family ended up ordering some pretty yummy looking things.

With so many places to choose from we decided to give this one a shot. The spot is fun and has the quintessential beach theme to it. Our server was very nice and attentive.\n\nThe food, however, was forgettable.\n\nI ordered the salmon BLT that looked appetizing. Too bad there was barely any mayo on it, making the salmon taste drier than it already did. (Points for adding a nice portion of lettuce, so I could get some green in.) My husband did say he enjoyed his fish tacos.\n\nThe biggest disappointment came with our kids' order. The chicken tenders they got were so hard and over-cooked, I'm pretty sure the sea life wouldn't dare touch them. You could barely pull pieces of edible meat from each tender. Needless to say, our kids ended up eating our food.\n\nLike others commenting, it took a while to get our food and for the waitress to come back with check. I will say the waitress (likely a grandmother) did an awesome job of splitting up our kids' single meal on two plates, and bringing out their food before ours.\n\nMaybe this place had an off day.

I went recently and split the Blue Cheese Fries and some wings with my family (I think the wings were also blue cheese? Can't remember, but they were delicious and actually drumettes, which were fantastic anyway.) I'm afraid I can't say what beers were had because I wasn't paying much attention since I was happy with my Angry Orchard, but my brother really favored his and it was Magnolia something, I'm sorry I'm not very helpful but the staff was knowledgable so just ask them, depending on what you like. \n\nAlthough it was not the warmest of San Francisco nights, we sat outside people watched - they have a great little fireplace that kept us warm as well as our drinks! The fries were absolutely fantastic, unlike anything I'd had before, and the combination of green onions, blue cheese, bacon, and the rest of the toppings made it so delicious, couldn't complain. I also want to give props to our waiter Brian, who first off has some really cool tattoos. My parents were deciding between two beers and he offered us the ability to sample them, which was unexpected and delightful, and they came out promptly and were excellent quality. Brian also heard us talking about how it was my father's birthday and brought him a brownie and frozen yogurt, which was quite sweet, so just total applause to him, we really liked him. We also ordered the fries on his recommendation, so thank you Brian. \n\nAll in all, this place is a good place for people watching, drinks, food, and service without being ridiculously expensive or feeling too much like a tourist! The restaurant's theme was beachey and Californian without being raunchy, and had enjoyable music as well. I'd recommend!", "author": "Alina D."}

Extremely busy during lunch hour and they have all your standard Fisherman's Wharf favorites such as clam chowder in a bread bowl, but with the added benefit of some Mexican dishes. A little overpriced but that was expected since it's San Francisco. They have one large co-ed bathroom which I thought was oh so progressive; So if that makes you uncomfortable in your private parts, then use the facilities elsewhere.", "author": "Angela A."}

Spotted this restaurant as it is one of the first ones you see at the entrance to the pier. Decided to grab a drink with a friend while waiting.\n\nWas greeted (or not) by an un-smiling hostess. Asked if there was some room at the bar for 2. There wasn't, so we were seated on the patio where at least we could watch the passerby. We were handed our menus and didn't get approached for another 15 minutes. Finally placed our order for 2 drinks and the Bacon Blue Cheese Fries. Asked to close out immediately after as we were sort of on a time crunch. Food and drinks took literally forever to come out. And each time the person bringing whatever over seemed confused or lost. With both the drinks and fries, the server walked by us, looked around with a puzzled look on his/her face, and then finally set down whatever they had at our table. Drinks were extremely watered down, tasted as if they put a teaspoon of alcohol in it. The french fries, however, were very good, as I had never had fries with blue cheese and I LOVE blue cheese. Also, despite the fact that we asked for the bill immediately after ordering, that took another 15 minutes to get to us. And then another 15 to receive the copies to sign. We were also not checked on once. Overall, fries were good, drinks were watery, and service was just a no. Will most likely never come back.", "author": "Genevieve M."}

We decided to just check out the bars near Pier 39 and Wipeout had a pretty nice outdoor seating area so we decided to check it out. When we found out there was a wait to grab a table outside, we just went inside since there wasn't a wait. \n\nWe checked in with the host and told him we didn't need menus since we just planned on drinking. Then out of nowhere the host (some older Filipino guy) just went on a rant about how he has to give us menus if we want a table. He basically said this is how it works, you either take the menus or you don't get a table. Alright man, we'll take the menus...relax. He was speaking in such a condescending tone, almost like we offended him by suggesting we didn't need menus. I have no clue what this guy's deal was but he seriously needs to just chill out because his confrontational attitude totally killed the vibe. \n\nWhen we sat down at the table with the food menus we didn't need, not a single server even approached the table within the first 5-10 minutes. We were fed up and just decided to walk to the outdoor area and grab a few stools at the bar. For such a crappy bar, the drinks were expensive and pretty weak too. What a terrible combination. \n\nThe only bright spot in the whole time we were here were the amazing garlic fries. I'm a garlic lover and even I was impressed by the amount they put in there. There would just be glorious mounds of garlic and butter that I would scoop up with the fries. Seriously some of the best garlic fries I've ever had. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend coming to Wipeout. The rude host was such a turn off, and our laziness to find another bar was the only reason we stayed. The garlic fries were good, but even that couldn't salvage the rest of the experience. There's gotta be better places out there at Fisherman's Wharf.", "author": "Mike M."}

In response he said \"Well I already put it in but I guess I could go tell them to change it\". I was so confused at his rude response because it is not like the food was already made, it was literally just put in. Second, after dinner I paid with a $20 and was expecting around $3 back. Everyone at my table paid with card and got their receipt back with their card but i didn't get my change back so I sat there waiting to see if it was coming. I sat for about 5 min watching him to see and every time he looked at us he looked confused as to why we were still sitting there. I could not believe he just took my change expecting it to be part of his tip. I have never experienced a waiter taking the money expecting it to be theirs. It was late and i was angry and I didn't want to be a rude customer, so i just took the money back i had set on the table for tip and left.

This is common courtesy and when you are building a team and running a business there are things you do behind the scenes and not to deteriorate the ambiance of your customers experience with your business.

That's totally understandable since it was a crowded day on the pier and we had a group of 10. \n\nEverybody ordered their food; we were all really excited to eat and extremely hungry. I ordered the California Burger (guacamole, bacon, and jack cheese), my friends ordered clam chowder, the Hawaiian burger, salmon BLT, a regular burger, and fish and chips. \n\nIt all went wrong when every single person at the table got their food, but me. I obviously was pretty angry because well, everybody finished most of their food and my food STILL wasn't out. My friend asked the workers if my food was coming out yet, but they just said they would \"check on it.\" After 5 minutes, my food still wasn't coming out while people who came in after me got their food first... ok?? My food was obviously forgotten and the workers were obviously ignoring our table. 5 minutes later, my food FINALLY came out after a 20 minute wait. Oh, and the waiter also forgot my friend's order of French fries, did he not write ANY of the orders down, or...????\n\nMy burger was mediocre, tasted like a burger. There was nothing special about it, even though the price for it was pretty expensive.\n\nWhen the check came out, the waiter said he took my burger off the check. I felt bad for being angry, so I gave him a nice tip. But there was a problem with the check, and he ended up charging my friend's credit card twice... Which pretty much made me angry again because I gave him a good tip for being a lousy waiter. I didn't expect amazing service, but I expected at least decent service.", "author": "Julie N."}

I'm in San Francisco on the water. What better place to eat fish? The menu said fresh Alaskan cod. The waitress said they're great so I get them. It comes deep fried in these awkward oblong shapes. I don't do fried fish. Fresh does not equal fried. Specify that in the menu. Also this shit looked like it came straight out of a freezer bag and dumped into a deep fryer. To me it was inedible. I didn't eat it. I tried my rice and beans-- I bit down onto what was raw crunchy rice mixed in with cooked. Can you imagine eating this? It was actually painful. I pushed my plate away and tried my daughters food. A teriyaki chicken bowl with rice and veggies. To my surprise her kids meal was better than mine, and a great portion so it was enough for us to share and be satisfied. If you're in pier 39 and looking for a place to grab a bite, keep walking.

We would have done the to-Go option right next door, however there was no place for our party of 6 to sit outdoors.\n\nMe: Chili Bowl with Cheese and Onions on the Side + water\nGuest 1: Cheeseburger + soda\nGuest 2: Hamburger + soda\nGuest 3: Chili Cheese Fries + soda\nGuest 4: Chili Bowl no sides + water\nGuest 5: Calamari & Fries + water\n\nTotal: 100 some odd bucks (GEEZ!)\n\nThe chili bowls were okay, nothing special but better than diner chili in my opinion. I would order it again if I was craving it. Guest 4 didn't enjoy it so much, and only ended up eating the bread bowl. Guest 1 said the cheeseburger was fine, not bad. Guest 2 said the same thing. Guest 3 didn't think there was enough cheese on the fries. All who ate fries thought that they were too oily, and leeched a puddle of oil on the plate. And guest 5 thought his calamari wasn't very good, rubbery with a bouncy ball like texture. I later found out that this person also got food poisoning from the calamari. That sucks.\n\nSERVICE IS VERY POOR. You will have to hunt someone down for anything. It took me a good 20 minutes to get one person to tell our waiter that we needed a refill.\n\nBreakdown:\n\nService: 1/5\nFood: 2/5\nCost: 2/5\nOverall Value of Visit: 2/5\n\nif I go again then it'll be the to-go option.

There Menu consists of Burgers, Salads, Pasta and down to Fish and Chips which included a little of seafood given thats its along the pier. I had ordered the Fish Chips as well we ordered an appetizer of calamari to start off with. It didn't take long for us to receive the appetizer which was a plus but for our drinks it took them awhile as we didn't get what we had asked. There calamari was a very tasty, batter was crunchy and served hot. When I had received my main entre, it was served in large portion. 3 Pieces of fishes and a large portion of fries at the bottom including cole slaw on the side to balance your palette. And so simple meal turned out to very good. I can't say much about the drink being served off.. given that there food was very good.. So again ..

My boyfriend and I first walked by this place and were intrigued by the way it looked. I loved that 6-pack beer carriers were the holders for condiments! So creative! So there's a to-go window and an actual restaurant seating area, as well as a bar. There is inside and outside seating. Follow the signs if you want to reserve your seat at the restaurant! We finally saw the host and they said it would be 5 minutes for 2 people. We preferred outside seating. Right next to the hostess area are knick knacks for tourists, such as magnets, heats, shirts, etc. We then got seated right away and looked at the menu. The tables outside are picnic like tables that are pretty sturdy and clean from what I saw for our table.\n\nNow, we both really wanted fish and chips and we know for a fact you can get it better somewhere else, such as the stands at Fisherman Wharf, but those go for about the same price as everywhere else at the pier due to the high amount of tourists that come through! \n\nOur waiter was really nice and prompt as we were both ready to order right away. I ordered a tall Anchor IPA and Fish and Chips($13). My boyfriend ordered the Wipeout Combo that included fish, calamari and coconut shrimp($15.95) and fries (or \"chips,\" lol). Our food came out quick and crispy! My boyfriend and I really liked our food. If you're into Malt Vinegar for your fish, you have to ask the waiter because they don't leave it in the condiment container at your table. Our total came out to around $45, a little pricey, but understandable because we were at the Pier.

We were a family of 10 and four of us wanted our own checks. Our waiter, Wilfredo, complained vocally by his constant irritated sighs. It's not something new that we've all done in a restaurant. Whenever there's been a group of us, we've always had separate checks and it has never been an issue. We told him on more than two occasions that there was going to be separate accounts so why he sounded irritated was unexplainable to us. Another complaint we had of his service is he then did not ask us for refills nor how our food tasted. He was happily attending consistently the two tables by us, so it seemed as if he was ignoring us. We had to ask him over to our table and ask for refills, which then he snidely remarked that one of our drinks was not a free refill. We knew this already before asking him for a refill but the tone he used was inappropriate. Then when we received our checks, we used our 15% off coupon from the aquarium and he got more irritated and told us he could only allow 1 for the entire table--it says nothing on the coupon that there is a limit per table. We had all gone to the Aquarium, so we each had our separate coupon. He later came back and gave us the 15% off, but it seemed as if a coworker or supervisor had to direct him how to do it.\nIt seems as if this server was new, and if he isn't I would like the manager to at least consider retraining him. My family and I aren't from San Francisco and had little time in our hands. We somewhat regret not asking for the manager when we were there, but we had little time to enjoy our time in the Bay and we also didn't want it to ruin our evening. This occurred about 10 hours ago and we've all had time to calm down and think back on the experience. We all still agree the service was horrible and will more than likely not return.\nAgain, food was great, but the service (at least from one individual) needs improvement.", "author": "Andrea A."}

Went with a tourist friend and noticed that they don't tell you about any extra charges for substitues\nSalad for fries because of allergies (shellfish in same fryer) if drinks are refill or not. When you order a drink they get you the largest size not regular and don't tell you that. Once you get the check when you mention it to the waiter he was extremely rude to my friend, said \"I dont know where you are from but thats how it is here in San Francisco restaurants\"  which is when I stepped in and said I was a local and they should have mentioned all the extra charges on my bill. He said he was sorry and he was going to fix it but instead just charged my check dropped it off running and left. When I mentiond it to the lady at the front desk she was somewhat polite said they were sorry and that in SF they charge for drinks( refills) everywhere and substitute for salad instead of fries. This is just bad, I feel bad for all other amazing restaurants in the city that are not like that at all. Our city maybe expensive but not as unreasonable as they made it sound.

We were ignored for 10-15 minutes while the bartenders were closing out checks (must have been busy before we got there) so I was a little more understanding that we may have to wait.

The cheesy bread appetizer (that currently comes free with check-in) was good, as was the coconut shrimp plate and clam chowder. All good, not anything to rave about.\n\nThe Hawaii 5-0 pizza has a doughy crust and really basic ingredients. My son liked it but the doughy crust just wasn't my thing. I ordered the fish & chips and did not finish the fish because it was terribly bland. The waiter was great at comping us for these issues. I love how he was quick to make the situation right.\n\nI got a free birthday dessert of a lava cake and ice cream! That was awesome!\n\nOh...and the bathroom is unisex.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-03", "description": "After a day of playing tourists in the big city, we went to the biggest tourist trap that San Fran has to offer:  Pier 39.  You've got the lounging sea lions, Alcatraz as your photo backdrop, souvenir shops galore, and of course, over-priced restaurants serving mediocre food.  The one we finally decided on was Wipeout, mainly because they were cheaper than their upstairs neighbor Eagle Rock Cafe (which has the better Yelp rating).  \n\nThe place, inside and out, was packed.  The vibe is casual, loud, and fun...something you might find on the Santa Cruz beach boardwalk.  Surprisingly, they sat us inside right away.  Not much of a view of the marina, but they had giant TV's all around the place.  So it's actually a good place to catch a game.  Their menu consisted of specialty pizzas, 1/2 pound Angus burgers, tacos and burritos, salads, the usual bar appetizers (chicken wings, nachos, calamari), clam chowder, and some seafood items.  They also offer 23 oz fruitty, blended drinks ($10.95), that appropriately get served with an umbrella of fruit.  I likey!\n\nWe started off with some perfectly fried and seasoned onion rings that were lightly battered in panko, no heavy flour batter.  I thought the seafood platter ($15.95) would be a great choice consisting of calamari, coconut shrimp, a thick piece of cod, and fries.  The shrimp and fish were ok but I didn't like the calamari at all.  It had a thick batter and pretty much tasted like it came from a frozen bag.  Luckily I ordered a cup of clam chowder ($4.95) as an afterthought (we are in San Francisco ya know!) that was filled with clams and had a nice consisitency and mild flavor.  That chowder and the onion rings saved me from a disappointing meal.  Our table also had a burger that looked amazing, a fish sandwich that was tasty, and a big carne asada burrito, which unexpectedly had lots of tender and flavorful diced up meat.  \n\nService was very good.  Our server was friendly, helpful with the menu, and prompt.  Our food and drinks came in a timely manner.  For the place being chaotically busy, I honestly didn't expect that great of service.  The one thing I didn't like was that they charged $0.75 for a side (tiny plastic cup) of pico de gallo!  Seriously?  Our server should have mentioned the extra charge when we asked for it.  Aside from that, Wipeout was an above-standard choice for a casual SF touristy meal.\n\n**oh, side note:  one unisex bathroom with 4 stalls inside the restaurant only.  a long line, and a little awkward, but clean and convenient.", "author": "Carol P."}

The place was packed but we were able to get seating right away. They have a pretty extensive menu. My niece loved her carnitas burrito - it was huge! And since I'm doing low-carb, they replaced the rice in my Shrimp & Steak Bowl with double veggies. The food was delicious but a bit overpriced. (Location, location, location.) Service was excellent though and I was happy we ate here. On another note, I loved their bathrooms! They have a common area for men & women to wash their hands and individual unisex bathrooms -- this makes the line equal! Yay!", "author": "Linda J."}

Nonetheless!--\n\n5/5: we were immediately greeted by the hostess, who told us our waiting time would be five to ten minutes. Turned out to be only two minutes, and we were called up to our table.\n\n5/5: food was amazing. I posted up pictures already; the only thing that I thought that needed a bit of work would be the chicken penne. But this place is a grill, so I don't really know why I would choose pasta here (but I did). Their burger, says my brother, was amazing. Their taco, says my sister's boyfriend, was delicious (the best, apparently, was steak). I tried the pulled pork taco- it was pretty good. We also had the nachos as our appetizer- pretty good, and my younger sister had a fish and sticks meal (she really liked it as well).\n\n5/5: service, I will have to say, was amazing. The waitress came back with our food within ten, fifteen minutes, and was very friendly and kind to us all. She refilled our drinks constantly and checked up on us every once in a while. The manager, whose name I believe is Chris, also visited our table as well- it was pretty cool. He was extremely friendly and welcoming to us, and I thought that this made the meal even better.\n\nAll in all, I loved it!

People watch while you drink your specialty drink or beer and hope you don't get pooped on by the birds. LOL  We started in the sun and as time went by the tarp shade came out little by little-just like magic till the patio was totally shaded.  We ordered our drinks- a tall beer and a Mai Tai.  Nothing better than being on vacation with a frosty beer glass with ice cold beer to drink.  Sigh.  \n\nThe BF and I thought we would share two dishes so we ordered the BBQ burger with crispy onions and the chicken sandwich with pineapple and teriyaki.  The burger was much better than the chicken as I can remember feeling like I was on a commercial eating it when the bbq sauce dripped from the burger.  Charred to perfection.  The chicken sandwich was really messy and the bun a little soggy from the teriyaki but not too bad.  My daughter ordered the mac n cheese with fries.  The mac was straight out of the old fashioned Kraft box...it always amazes me that they would serve that at restaurants and charge the prices they do for it.  Anyways, she was fine....just like good 'ol mac and cheese from home I guess. haha\n\nThe atmosphere is exactly what you expect being in California.  Totally chill, good food and drink, great customer service and enjoying the fab Cali weather!  The d\u00e9cor is a beachy-surfer theme with cute little signs that make you laugh.  Get your pic with the surfer dude statue in the front for giggles.  Even if I lived in San Fran I would still visit Wipeout on occasion.  Sigh....I wish I was still there.", "author": "Carissa C."}

They do have at least one restaurant personnel in the restroom facility at all times to ensure cleanliness and to assure patrons that it is a boys' and girls' bathroom, haha.   \n\nThe wait time wasn't that long for a Saturday night.  I think we waited for about 10 minutes?  The hostess was nice and our server at first was also nice however, during the middle of our meal, there was a server exchange due to her lunch so what I heard from the group was that the replacement server was rude and plain out sucks.  Fortunately for her, I wasn't present or else I would have said something.  \n\nI knew I wanted clam chowder because I'm in San Francisco and it's a mandatory soup to order especially at the pier and I did but I refrained from ordering it in a sourdough bread bowl because I did not want to consume over 800 calories and over 70g of carbs, not to mention over 25g of fat in a soup - SOUP!!!  Plus I was spending money left and right that weekend so my soup costs just $4.99.  I can spend lavishly on myself when it comes to food but I have a finance conscience, however.  \n\nWhat I really wanted to order was the taco salad which looked fresh and ginormous but I didn't want to spend $12.95 on a salad.  I can be cheap but this is where I regret not ordering that because I really wanted it *sad face*  At least I made up for it at Chocolate Heaven afterwards.  I devoured 3 chocolate covered Oreo's in less than 2 minutes.  \n\nMy sister and her friend ordered the Wipeout Fried Combo ($15.99) and it's a fried fish, fried calamari, and coconut shrimp platter.  It looked rather appetizing but I didn't want to try it because I don't know about them but I hate it when people want to try my food or share.  \"Get your own, dude\".  They also ordered The Jalapeno Burger ($12.50).  The burger was brought out cut in half already per their request and it looked deliciously medium rare but if it was my burger, I'd order it rare.  \n\nKevin ordered a pizza and added his own toppings.  If I recall correctly, he opted for bacon, chicken, and pineapple.  He raved about it but I personally didn't care for it (had it as leftovers the following day).  It was on the dry side.  Meh.  \n\nI left before we paid because the kiddo started to act up.  Instead of allowing him to be loud, cry, or scream... I took him out for a walk (Chocolate Heaven) and to listen to the live music that was right in front of Hard Rock Cafe.  I didn't return to the group but when I came back in to wait a bit, the hostess remembered me and validated my parking ticket.  \n\nThe food is ok and the service can definitely improve (the server).", "author": "Tram N."}

My friend and I each got a bowl and then split the fish and chips combo with calamari, coconut shrimp.  The portion was HUGE!  At first I thought it was a mistake and we somehow got double, but it was not.  It was definitely more than enough food.   The clam chowder came out super fast!   I was impressed by how quickly we were able to get in and out.  The only thing food-related I didn't really like was the coconut shrimp, it tasted like sunscreen to me.  My friend liked it though. \nOur server seemed annoyed with us the whole time, and while she wasn't rude, she definitely wasn't friendly or engaging.  At the end of the meal when we were paying I asked if they validate parking and she said \"if you parked across the street we do\" as she was walking away. Cool.  Thanks.   I had originally rated this experience higher, but thanks to that little ending piece, it changed it completely for me.   At first I thought yeah I wanna come back again for this amazing food, but this service really put a question mark on that for me", "author": "Karsyn M."}

There are no words to describe this place except \"gross.\" My fiancee and I had just gotten off the boat from Alcatraz and we needed lunch. We started hunting around Pier 39 and settled on Wipeout because we did not want seafood again and were craving Mexican food, so this was as close as we could get to what we wanted on Pier 39. Plus, there were a lot of people here and that is usually a good sign. The entrance is super confusing as there are two and we came in behind the hostess stand. The first thing said to me was, \"You need to come around and get in line, there's a line.\" Because of the warm welcome, I honestly felt like leaving right then and there. So, we finally get to the hostess stand and are told that we would have a 5-10 minute wait, but then the hostesses get into an argument with one telling us to wait while the other telling her she has a table for us. After the exchange between those two, we are seated at the window with a bay view, which was awesome. My fiancee and I ordered chips and salsa, nothing amazing or bad about those. Both of us ordered chicken burritos. My burrito was watery. The chicken inside was bad quality, a lot of fat and a lot of gristle. I just stopped eating mine because I was so grossed out by it, I didn't want to get sick. It also lacked a lot of flavor, it was pretty tasteless. The server was friendly, which was a plus.

It was a bit on the sunny side (at least in the morning), so we wanted to do something. We decided to go to Pier 39! \n\nCouldn't really decide where we should eat. Picked a couple places & just went with the one with the shortest wait..considering that it was a Sunday, Easter, & a tourist spot all day every day. The winning restaurant = Wipeout Bar & Grill.\n\nWhile I thought I'd have a good day (I mean..it was Easter!), the moment I went to up to the hostesses, I was automatically in a bad mood. I originally went up to the hostesses to inquire about the wait time for 4 people. They kind of just stared at me for a while, which made me feel uncomfortable. One woman asked, \"Do you have a preference?\" First of all, preference for what?! When I didn't answer right away, she looked at me like I was stupid, which I did NOT appreciate!! I think that's what ticked me off. She still didn't clarify her question, but I had figured out what she was asking me. But already from that point, I just didn't want to deal with her anymore. I almost wanted to tell my brother to let's go somewhere else, but I knew everyone was hungry. \n\nThey told me about 20-30 minutes wait time, so my brother, his girlfriend, & their daughter wandered around the area a bit. I decided to stay behind just in case we were called. They called my name (which they got wrong btw. I'm pretty sure 'Jessica' is a pretty common name) & I told them that I had to get the rest of my party. They were very IMPATIENT & quick to grab someone else. Like seriously?! They kept pushing me to hurry up basically & that was NOT okay. \n\nAfter getting horrible hostess service, I was hoping that the rest of the experience would make up for it. Our waitress was really nice, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1 star. As for the food, that was alright. Here's what we ordered...\n\nTeriyaki Pineapple Chicken Sandwich ($12.50) - I'm cutting down on my red meat, so I decided to get chicken instead. It was okay. The bun was way too small for the chicken..or the chicken was too big for the sandwich. The teriyaki & pineapple was good, but definitely made the sandwich messy to eat. Towards the end, I ended up using my fork & knife to eat it. It was just okay though. It also came with crispy fries, which were good. I probably wouldn't order it again.\n\nThe Hawaiian Burger ($11.95) - My brother got this. He was craving a burger, & was satisfied. Also came with crispy fries.\n\nFish & Chips ($13.95) - My brother's girlfriend got this. She liked it..oh, my niece did too. \n\nOverall, I'm not a fan of my experience at Wipeout Bar & Grill. From the beginning, my experience started to go downhill. If I'm back at Pier 39, I would rather take my services elsewhere.", "author": "Jessica A."}

I'm learning that I can't judge a business so harshly based on one person that works there. So here's the rundown... It was myself, my boyfriend and another couple. So we ordered drinks and she checked our ID pretty standard. Received our drinks and they were good, big, and cheap! We asked for some suggestions and they all sounded good. we told her he has a nut allergy and she said he would be fine. She suggested a Carne Asada burrito for my bf so he went with that. When all of our food came his was the last to arrive. When he cut open the burrito and started eating it I realized it was carnitas and not the Carne Asada he orders. She apologized and took the plate back. She brought him the correct meal and a complimentary drink which was appreciated. On the low I told her it was his Bday and said they will take care of him. We were done eating and they brought out his bday surprise and sang. My boyfriend asked me if I thought there were no nuts in the brownie so I called her over to check. She took the spoon and cut the brownie open! I thought she was going to eat some lol! She runs to the kitchen and run back to the table, \"DO I NEED TO CALL AN AMBULANCE?!\" So that clearly means NUTS! I told her no as he didn't eat it yet. She came back apologize once again for another mix up and brought yet another drink. So although she brought out the wrong burrito and almost killed my boyfriend it was good nonetheless.

When it was our turn to get seated they sat us down outside between a couple and a family, it sucked because I could hear in both sides of the conversation.\n\nAnywho, lets talk about food. So, since it was my friend's Birthday the manager (I believe?) talked her into getting a beer, we didn't really pay much attention to what the name the beer was but he had told us it was from Hawaii, something Kona(?), it was alright it actually reminded us of a more fizzier Corona if that makes any sense, a glass of that was $8!!! \n\nI ordered the grilled chicken burrito, it wasn't all that great. It had bean, grilled chicken, and that's pretty much all I can remember (not memorable what so ever), it also came with some chips but no salsa! FAIL.\n\nMy friend had gotten \"The Beach Club\", which looked pretty good! It had 5 rolls of turkey, between sourdough bread, onion, tomatoes, lettuce... Additional avocado for $1 and a side of friends ($10.95), not bad for a sandwich especially for a spot like this.\n\nThe thing that really rubbed me the wrong way was that when the couple that was sitting next to us left, some random guy with a glass of red wine just walked up and sat next to us and kept staring at me when I was eating! It was really rude so I turned to him & asked him what he was looking at and his response was \"You have such a beautiful face and such a nice body\", I was like \"WTF?!\", he wouldn't leave me alone!!! My friend & I started telling him off but he just sat there smiling at me and looking at me as though I was a piece of carcass and he was a hungry vulture! Finally he got the point and walked off & our waiter finally returned & I had told him what happened, he told us that he'll make sure that guy doesn't sit there & as he left to go back to the kitchen the creeper came back & kept complimenting me! That was my last straw! My friend & I kept yelling at him & he finally left. UGH!!!!\n\nAnother thing that confused me was that they had given my girlfriend a Birthday dessert (usually restaurants give small ones for free) but I was charged $6 for that! If I knew it was $6, I wouldn't have even told him it was her Birthday since we were already getting irritated with this place!\n\nOverall, our bill came out to almost $50. We paid for my burrito, her sandwich, a beer and her Birthday dessert that we never even ordered. This place gets a 2 star. Decent food, decent price, weirdos, and sad that we had to pay for a dessert we didn't order. Never coming back.", "author": "Phoebe T."}

It seems they've earned their keep with friendly service, pretty good food and outside eating accommodations.\n\nIs this the place to get world-class oysters in a half shell or that \"fresh\" ahi tuna tar tar that sounds so elegant when you order it? No. But if you're in the mood for some tropically-inspired comfort food, you've got nothing to lose. They pretty much had me at Anchor Steam beer-battered fish 'n chips but I decided to get a turkey burger -___- (it was awesome though). Luckily I have an awesome girlfriend who got the fish 'n chips and after one bite, I was hooked.\n\nI can't speak on the rest of the menu, but the coconut shrimp were some of the best I've had that weren't in Hawaii and the turkey burger would definitely be something I'd order again if I hadn't known what their fish 'n chips tasted like.

We noticed that there was a 18% gratuity added on to it.  The manager came over and asked if everything is ok.  We asked why there was tip already included it. His response was that if there was more than 6 people tip is included. Well that means if it is 7 or more tip is included. We had 6 people. Most places advertise that if have a group of XX or more then tip would be added on. There was nothing indicating this.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying 18% tip, but the service would have to be great, not bad.

The food would probably be the only reason why I'd ever come back, but next time I would ask for take out because customer service was horrible. My family of ten and I went the Aquarium of the Bay so we all got the 15% off discount in our ticket. Our waiter was named Wilfredo. Before we even ordered our food, we had mentioned to him that we were going to have separate checks. When so, he signed as if he was annoyed. We only mentioned it once. I'm a cashier at a restaurant as well and I understand people have bad days, but it's still no excuse for you to rub it off on your customers especially if they don't deserve it. Anyways we finally got our food and like I said, I was extremely happy with my food! Not once did he come to our table to ask if our food was good or if we needed refills. Nothing, but he had no problem asking the tables next to us. When we were done and got our checks, we were each gonna use our ticket for 15% off of each check, and again he didn't hesitate to groan. We all got our checks back and only 2 of the checks were taken off 15% when it clearly said on our ticket..anyways I would definitely appreciate it if you retrain him for customer service because even if you have to fake it, you do it.

We were a bit confused on where the entrance was. There was a separate windows to place order to go. Then another door to the patio from the inside. The actual door for us to get seated was located at the very front.\n\nNot surprisingly, it was incredibly busy. I asked the hostess how long is the wait. She responded, \"10-15 minutes.\" \"Oh okay. Party for two (2) please.\" \"Sure.\" They started to call out names one after the other. So if you weren't around when they called it, you missed your chance at a table. They went through it quick. As if they didn't have patience. So instead of us waiting for 10-15 minutes, we only stood there for a few minutes. =]\n\nIt was a beautiful day; the weather was perfect. It was noisy but very relaxing. Our server was Breaker. He greeted us with a smile (plus!) and helped us right away. Gave us the right amount of time to pick out our entree selection and served us our drinks and food at a fair timely matter.\n\nI ordered the Grilled Salmon Salad (no dressing) and the Boyfriend ordered the WipeOut Fried Combo.

After checking out a few places, we decided to eat here (daughter HAD to have chicken tenders). \nThe wait wasn't to bad for a Saturday at 2:00pm, maybe 20 minutes top.

They did say that the fries were so-so, and I don't think either one touched their coleslaw - too bad, I liked it just fine. Our son had the chili cheese dog which he devoured within a few minutes (as like any other 17 yr. old would). The only issue he had with eating outside here, was that the birds were freaking him out, LOL!. \nI had the Sesame Seared Tuna bowl, which at $17-18, I thought was a little expensive for lunch. Then our waitress, Gabby, brought it out and that question left me as soon as I tried the wasabi aioli topped, ginger smothered, ahi tuna. It was all resting on top of stir-fried veggies and coconut rice. This dish was GREAT!!! The freshly cut tuna was perfectly cooked to just above rare, and the crust wasn't overpowering. I'm not a veggie/rice person, but they were well seasoned and the rice was just right.

Most taco salads have beans at the bottom this didn't. Although would love to have a bit more greens and sour cream in it but it was still great.", "author": "Rose S."}

The margaritas are fantastic ( I recommend  the patron margarita 23 oz. you'll feel no pain). The fried calamity  was edible at best. I've had better in worst places. however the fish and chips made up for it. Reminded me of the greasy type I used to eat when I lived  in UK. This is not heathy so don't try it if you're watching your cholesterol. My partner liked the shrimp and steak bowl. To me the coconut rice was good but the stake was a cheap cut with too much fat.. He didn't let me try the shrimp so we'll take his word for it that it was good..  I skipped Hard Rock Cafe cause it is too commercial n the menu is bland..

Loved how the game was displayed on a large screen which divided the restaurant into a bar and the other half was the seating area. Loved how this place has an outside seating area since they're located in the pier. \n\nTheir decor is so different and unique, def fits the name of being a wipeout bar! The bathrooms were even super cool! It was almost like being in a beach-y scene. \n\nAnywho, the Blue Moons were super, super good and large in portion. I only had 2 of 'em to get me feeling a little tipsy. Wow. I just ordered appetizers, popcorn shrimp, fish n chips, wasn't anything special.\n\nWhat I want to applaud is the excellent customer service. David was really funny and took great care of us even though I was just there to chill and watch the game, he didn't ever forget about me and if I needed anything. He was super funny too!

Spacious seating for ppl of all shapes & sizes. Kid friendly, handicap friendly, & senior citizen friendly. Armless chairs & all table seating; no booths. Indoor & outdoor seating.\n\nCUST SVC: GREAT friendly & helpful staff! From host/hostess, to our Waiter-Willy, to food server, to the next employee directing you to their uni-sex bathroom area or the host/hostess stand. I've been here now 2 times, & both times have been great cust service. Keep up the excellent work team ^_^\n\nVISIT: My cousin recently had a birthday & wanted to eat @ a seafood spot in Pier 39. It was a pretty crowded Saturday afternoon @ Pier 39. After viewing a few restaurants, pricing, spaciousness, & wait time, we opted for Wipe Out Bar & Grill. Wait time for party of 3 (me, sis, & cousin) about 15-20min...got seated in 10min dinning inside ^_^\n\nEATS: Overall, all our eats were quite enjoyable! Fresh & hot.

(It was only 11am)\n- Great and fast service! Michael was our waiter, he was awesome!\n- Indoor and Outdoor seating\n- Prices did not fit in with the Pier 39 ripoff theme, which was obviously fantastic.\n- Sourdough French Toast (3.5/4 stars) 4 pieces of inch thick and perfectly sweetened sourdough, it was delectable!\n- Carnitas Breakfast Burrito (3.5 stars) Yummy!\n\nCons:\n- The pieces of bacon that were served with our French Toast combo were obviously not cooked to order.

She took one look at me and our party outside and said \"no. You cant have strollers outside only inside\". I was surprised since outside was much more spacious than inside. When I explained that we preferred outside since my baby was sleeping she continued to give me attitude and say we HAD to move inside. Since our group was starving we caved. Let me tell you inside was extremely tight. They continued to get on our case because our strollers were in the way yet they were the ones who told us to move inside \"where the strollers belong\". Never have I seen such attitude in a staff. I understand that this location must be stressful but it's not okay to take it out on the customers. Everyones food was okay though I enjoyed my French fries which lets be honest you can't screw up. I would avoid the nachos here.

So I went in there for a few of my friends and ordered a burger. The meal was good however, our server was kind of rude to us.\n\nAfter our food she came with our cheque, we decided we wanted to pay separate so we asked her could we split the bill. Her reply to us was \"only if you want to wait\".\n\nI thought that was pretty rude. As I have worked in the food industry before as a server, I understand if she is busy, or if she is having a bad day.. However I saw her being super nice to other tables and I guess that's because, from looking at us, she knew she wasn't going to get a high tip from us as we are students. I don't think I would go back there again.\n\nThe food was good though. Pretty filling.", "author": "Emily I."}

As it is, Wipeout is merely adequate, but I liked my server.\n\nThe place has a very Jimmy Buffett/Margaritaville quality to it, which would usually cause me to start throwing condiments.  But thankfully, I heard not a single Buffett tune, so the surf motif gets a pass this time.  There is a fire pit outside, which looked like it would be a cool place to eat.  As I was dining alone, though, I stood no chance of dislodging the baby boomers crowded around the flame.  No matter.  I pulled up a picnic table.\n\nI started with a garlic pizza bread appetizer.  I was starving, so I needed something quickly.  The bread part of it was pretty good - light on the inside, crunchy on the outside.  But the sauce wasn't very saucy.  It seemed coagulated and dry.  The cheese was okay.  Still, I finished the plate.\n\nI ordered the barbecue burger with garlic fries.  For burger that contains fried onions, pepper jack cheese and bbq sauce, it essentially had no flavor at all.  But most of the food I've had in SF has been exceedingly bland, so maybe that's par for the course.  Thumbs down, Wipeout.\n\nThe garlic fries were actually pretty good.  My server initially brought my plate with regular fries, but quickly returned with a basket of the garlic version I'd ordered.\n\nBy no means should you make Wipeout Bar & Grill a go-to dinner destination.  But if you're looking for some decent appetizers and a good atmosphere for a few drinks, it may hit the spot.", "author": "Ben B."}

He loved it. Like romantically. Jru was our server again, and I remembered him from last time, and just as last time he was fast, quick, and speedy with the service, refills, and answers to any questions. He is still great with the kids as he made my infant son giggle like crazy. He also didn't mind that my son was making a full on mess on the ground, which I always feel terrible about, unfortunately he is 8 months old and still working on his dining skills.

Their Clam Chowder was good. Lots of clam meat in it, served hot at the right temperature. We had their Calamari, Garlic Fries and several entrees. My son loved the pineapples in his Chicken Teriyaki bowl. I ordered the Surf and Turf. The steak was cooked weird. I told them to make it \"medium,\" but it turned out a combination of three kinds. The left part of the steak was a bit medium rare, red juice dripping out from it. The middle part was medium, pinkish brown. The right part of the steak was medium well, totally brown with a bit of charred surface. It was uneven. It came with veggies and coconut rice. The shrimp skewers were great. I was not a fan of the coconut rice, though. It tasted a bit sweet for me. I didn't like sweet stuff in my gourmet food. The calamari was good.

We opted to park in the Pier 39th garage as we planned on doing a little walking around the piers after lunch. \n\nWe were seated right away inside (too windy for me outside!) and had a nice window seat with a view of the bay, after ordering we enjoyed our soda and laughed until our Chips and Salsa arrived, Taking into consideration that this isn't a Latin restaurant, the salsa was fairly good.\n\nOur food came out promptly even though they were fairly busy for lunch. \n\nMy dad had the Tuna Ginger Salad, the Tuna was decent, a little tough in my opinion, but had good flavor. \n\nMy friend had the BBQ Burger, she said it was good, but nothing to write home about. \n\nI had the Fish and Chips, I was disappointed. The fish was pretty dry and had very little flavor in the batter. I poured on the lemon and vinegar just to spice it up.\n\nOur server was fantastic! Polite. Attentive. Informative.

We sat near a huge window in the back and had a gorgeous view of the bay at sunset. We even got to watch a thunderstorm roll in. Much more fun to watch than walk back to the apartment in, by the way. It's touristy and full of kids, but it's on the Wharf, so what do you expect? We went during the playoffs and they had the Giants game playing on the big screen near the bar. Our server was friendly and attentive, but not to the point of being annoying. I had fish tacos and thought they were super delicious. The Baja sauce was yummy and the margarita I got was HUGE.

It's about the jerks that greet you and seat you at the front. One specific lady who was calling every Asian person waiting for a table \"Chinese\". The place had a lot of traffic. Mostly to get to the restroom which isn't too far away from the  hostess booth, so after I gave them my name I stood in front of the booth for a little while hoping for the crowd to move along so I can relocate somewhere not so in the way. I can hear everything they say. I ignore the cussing. Then I hear the dude host ask the chick about who's next and she looks at the Asian family in front of us and says \" those Chinese people\" so the dude laughs and the other young girl there kinda giggles. I'm like why was that funny, but OK maybe I missed something. Then I hear them call my name and this chick goes \"this Chinese girl right here\". With a sort of  annoyance in her voice. I hear the dude laughing again so I turn and reply yeah I heard you say my name and the young chick's eyes get big and they all start fidgeting. Then dude turns on his super fake charm as if trying to make up for his ignorance and brings us to our table. You know that feeling you get when someone is trying to kiss @$$ to the max? He was trying so hard it was almost awkward. Anyway I asked our really nice waitress if I can speak to the manager but my husband and my teen child just asked me to stay calm and not let them ruin our time together. So I eventually built a bridge and got over it. I just got reminded because I read this news article about Bo Brice being called a \"white boy\". Then I got all heated again and remembered I never did a Yelp review. Anyway I'm not Chinese. And if I was, I don't see anything funny about that. I have no clue why that hostess made that comment the way she did.She was just ignorant. She doesn't belong in a fine establishment like this.", "author": "A F."}

After a nice little walk on the pier we stopped in and was assisted at the front right away. We got a nice open table for 2 and down to the drinks we went. \n\nShe ordered a wipeout margarita and definitely enjoyed it. I ended up ordering a Giant 23 oz Shark Bite which at the time sounded manly enough to me: Cruzan raspberry rum, and pi\u00f1a colada mix, with a strawberry wave. When the drink came out it was an big hourglass shaped glass with a cherry, pineapple piece, and a nice fruity blend to it. At this point the man card had been left at the door. However, I did not let it phase me as I took a few sips and it was actually very good. Okay who am I kidding I positioned the glass closer to her as I took a few sips when no one was watching, it was still very good. I had to protect my manhood. As soon as it was close to being finished she said she will finish the rest I ordered a vodka pineapple \"in a regular glass.\" The waitress was having a kick with it and brought the drink and left a piece of pineapple on it for me. \n\nSo I really don't have an issue as I should've just read it clearly or there should've been a visual depiction of how the drink would look.

That's why we were suckered into going there. Has a cute surfer dude \"wipeout\" atmosphere, but the food was not up to par for a place that should dazzle its tourists.  I had the terryiaki pineapple chicken sandwich and the sauce basically disintegrated the roll.  I also thought it was WAY overpriced (hence, a true \"wipeout\") BUT if that's your thing, and you're not so picky, and you don't mind eating the run-of-the-mill bar/grill type food, you should go and try it. Fun atmosphere (albeit touristy), good for kids, sit outside if you can and enjoy that Bay Breeze!\n\nMy husband and I are also...light-walleted so to speak (that's what studenting and teachering does!), so that does have an effect on my review.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-08-17", "description": "Wipeout Bar and Grill is one of the restaurants on the list of places that gets you a 2 hour free-parking validation (after 6 pm) at the parking structure across the street ($8/hr after 2 hours or without validation). This was the primary reason we walked out of Boudin across the walkway, and walked into this mess. After that grave error, what did we expect? \n\nAfter the hostess seated us, we were forgotten about for about 15 minutes. We almost stood up to leave, at which point our super-nice server appeared and graciously apologized and took our order. \n\nWe got the chips and salsa, veg head pizza and fish & chips. Our food arrived in under 7 minutes - record time for pizza. I know, very fishy. There's no way a trendy bar and grill at Pier 39 is nuking food... right? Wrong. \n\nTo be fair, chips were standard, as was the salsa. They gave us an extra serving of salsa, which was nice. \n\nBut the pizza was just sad. Undercooked, bland and completely sub-standard. It didn't even seem like it had been salted, let alone other spices, that's much too ambitious. Where were the tomatoes I was promised on the menu? The cheese on the pizza was oddly melted and appeared hotter than the yet-not-cooked pizza dough (you know what that means). \n\nNow, I like pizza. Even crap pizza. But this just didn't make the cut, not even good enough to be pizza-you-can-chow-down-after-a-few-drinks. \n\nFish & chips were served with nearly stale fries and dry coleslaw. According to my boyfriend, it was like eating a donut-wrapped-fish. Sounds icky. \n\nThe extra star was for service, our server was amazingly sweet and very calm even with the misfortune of having a number of tables with camera-toting throngs of visitors screaming at her in various languages. Kudos for maintaining her cool. Food-wise, Wipeout was .... yeah, you guessed it, a massive wipeout.", "author": "Meg P."}

I went back this time because the last time I was there I had fantastic fried shark bites there. To my great dismay this time they told me that they had taken them off the menu. Something about it not being good for the environment to eat an animal at the top of the food chain. Bah! My answer to that is that I am at the top of the food chain. Oh well. \n\nInstead we got calamari and garlic fries, and a couple of margaritas. Great calamari, and the garlic fries are definitely very garlicy (though not as good as Gott's down at the ferry building). The margaritas were awesome. \n\nThere's a great outdoor seating area where you can get it some good people watching. If it's a little chilly, aim for the big chairs around the firebit. \n\nI think this is a great place to stop if you're checking out the Pier 39 area.

Kids are picky, and many don't like seafood, and most often you just want to get them something to eat to shut them up.  \n\nSo where do you dine with the kids at the Wharf without breaking the bank with overpriced mediocre food? Hard Rock Cafe...Johnny Rockets for a quick burger?  You can support these national chains for American food if you like.\n\nOr, you can support a local Bay Area joint with a warm beach-y, California surf-town feel.  \n\nWipeout Grill is a great place for families.  The atmosphere is reminiscent of beach-side dining options along the California coast with both outdoor patio seating on a warm day, or plentiful indoor seating either with a bay-side view or bar seating with TVs playing your favorite ball game, while enjoying a drink off of their extensive beer, wine, margarita and Specialty drinks menu.  \n\nComfortable enough for large parties, you don't have to worry about making a big mess since they welcome families of all shapes and sizes.  \n\nI dined here for a quick bite to eat awhile back after wanting sit-down service, but nothing too fancy.  We were quickly seated by the window and our server was efficient and friendly.\n\nI ordered the The Hawaiian Burger - I love cooked pineapples! Burger was topped with a  grilled pineapple, teriyaki glaze and melted jack cheese, served on a toasted bun. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iaKZgEBfD4Ak4OR2vNKFrg?select=xYSsntNQEH-2SNVmbYkfiw\n\nBurger was cooked to my request...Medium Well and the bun was nicely toasted and warm as described.  I'm not so much into a cold bun when eating a hot burger, and Wipe Out Grill did my burger nicely.  \n\nWe also ordered the Wipe Out Fried Combo - A combination of fried fish, calamari and coconut shrimp, served with a tangy sweet and sour sauce and side of cole slaw.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iaKZgEBfD4Ak4OR2vNKFrg?select=zJe_KOxH_YgW9m8d3GP4IA\n\nBatter seemed nice and crispy at first, but became soggy quite quickly.  But for the most part, portion size was decent. \n\nPrices are competitive for the rest of the Wharf area...with my burger being $10.95 and the Combo platter at $15.95. It's the price you way for choosing to dine at the Wharf.  \n\nYes, you can get better deals elsewhere, but this place is great with families who don't have a lot of time, but would like a decent sit-down service restaurant with fun beach-y California atmosphere and extensive food and drink menu.", "author": "Cass J."}

From the outside, I didn't expect much but it definitely exceeded my expectations. The menu offers a wide variety of things to please everyone. We all had a milkshake which was pretty good to start with however they took a long time to come. I ordered the chicken burrito which was surprisingly very good. It was huge and came with corn chips as well which was a nice bonus. Unfortunately, the service wasn't up to much. Our waiter was pleasant but seemed interested elsewhere. The service was slow even at a quiet time. It was a chilled atmosphere and is good for lunch but is a serious tourist trap with its connecting gift shop. If you need a casual spot for a quick lunch on Fishermen's Wharf this is the spot.", "author": "Louise F."}

I was tempted by the Steak teriyaki bowl served over coconut rice.  Though the steak strips were tasty and tender, they were literally floating in wet and soggy rice slurry.  This offering should not have left the kitchen, and I'm not tempted to return for another try.", "author": "Louis H."}

My boyfriend had a veggie burger, he loved it! I had the... breadbowl of chowder! duh! it was great! and I'm a chowder lover, so I know chowder. yummmmmmmm.\n\nThe waiter was super nice, and we got to sit inside and watch the sunset on the pier ! There's an outside seating area too, with a fire pit. At some point a homeless person came in and just sat at a table.

The place was hustling and bustling like I always saw and our party of 4 was seated almost instantaneously. The guy taking our orders didn't write a single thing down and didn't make a single mistake. (Huge props to him since I saw him help another 2 tables before running back). On to the food. Fish and Chips were completely average compared to others, but the price tag on it was insane ($15.50) compared to everywhere else on the pier ($6.50 - $8.50) the fish was a few pieces overly caked in batter and didn't taste very great at all. Tried my girlfriends calamari and  it was unbearably rubbery and didn't have much flavor. The worst part was the coleslaw. I have yet to have coleslaw that horrible. It tasted so sour and was so dry I wanted to puke. To top it off I ended up puking not too much later. The TL;DR. Service is great. Experience is pretty cool.

This location has two components; a dine in restaurant and a \"fast food\" style outside ordering window in the shape of a VW bus. \n\nWe ate at the outside quick location.  The menu was simple and varied, containing interesting and random items.  We saw various items such as Gnarley Garlic Fries, Teriyaki Chicken Wings, and a Chicken Quesadilla.\n\nOrdering was slightly awkward since one needs to lower themselves down to order.  Not a huge issue at all.  The concept is great and very \"California\".  The food is well priced, considering the nature of the area. \n\nThe food we received was average, with a few notables.  I ordered the Gnarley Garlic Fries, which were fantastic.  I'm a huge garlic fan and enjoyed the kick that they had.  I also had ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Wings.  They had an unusual flavor, not so much teriyaki, but more plain than anything else.  My friend also ordered the chicken quesadilla.  Nothing to write home about.\n\nOverall, a great place to pick up a quick bite while walking the pier or prior to jumping on a boat to Alcatraz.\n\n**Note - after my original post, I received a message from a manager of this restaurant who was genuinely concerned about customer feedback.

Why not go all the way right.\n\nThe fish and chips seems a little bland and I was a little disappointed in that.  Since this place is on the pier I expected an explosion of taste from the fish but it was lacking that.\n\nI can say the good thing about this place the servings were huge.  My fish and chips had 3 huge pieces of fish and I was like wooooo and the customer service was great.  The place was packed and I mean packed for Fleet Week and we went to tell them a party of 4 and they told us it would be about a 15-20 minute wait.  We said ok and literally 2 minutes later they sat us.  There is inside and outside seating.  We sat inside.\n\nMy burrito on the other hand was very good.  The shrimp was seasoned very well.  They were also very good in size. The burrito was huge.  I could only eat half of it.  My favorite part indeed was the rice and beans because guess what...they had CORN in it.  LOVED IT!!!!!!\n\nI decided to give it a 3 star because where the flavor in the fish fell short, it made up for the serving size and the burrito!!!", "author": "Sandra S."}

We came here because of some discount coupons I got from the CA Visitor's Center upstairs with my AAA card- 20% off or a free kid's meal. The food is excellent- I had the Teriyaki Pineapple Chicken sandwich and my kids had chicken fingers and pizza from the kid's menu. Large portions and tasted great. My only complaint was the service, after our food was dropped off our waiter never came back to check on us or refill drinks. Our cups were empty at least 25 minutes while we ate. I finally had to ask the hostess to bring my son some ranch. When we saw our waiter again he was bringing the check. As a former waitress I feel strongly that you need to check that your table at least has everything they need to eat their meal, especially considering it was not crazy busy.

We were hungry.  In the end, I left conflicted about our decision to eat here... \n\nI'll admit, they have a lot of delicious choices on their menu to choose from that will leave you at wit's end about which one to select. And the food is actually pretty good and they provide large portions. But I simply can't forgive the prices ($9-10 for most appetizers; $10-12 for most sandwiches,  burgers, tacos and burritos; $14-16 for most specialty entrees). The BBQ Burger I ordered was good but definitely not worth spending $11.  In my opinion, the prices for their items are too high for my tastes for what I'm getting, but to my understanding these prices are fair for Pier-39 prices. \n\nI did enjoy the surf-themed environment of the restaurant though.  We had a surfboard for a table which was cool, but rather unpractical since it was narrow making it hard to fit all of our entrees on the table and even harder for those of us sitting at the ends of the surfboards.  There are some televisions situated in parts of the room tuned to various sports channels and a full-service bar is available as well. \n\nI can find better places to eat for a lower or even decent price, so sorry Wipeout Bar and Grill... unless you have a change of heart in your prices, me and my wallet are not coming back.", "author": "Serena C."}

This seemed a little shady, but, whatever (again.) Again, normal at lunch in a tourist area.  We had been waiting about 10 minutes when I overheard the man seating us say to the hostess that it was going to be a LONG time before he could find seats for us.  It was also indicated that larger group seatings were being broken up to seat smaller groups (in fairness, I'm sure that this is much more lucrative.)  So I asked how long and he looked surprised that I could actually hear him from 3 feet away and a little taken aback that I would be so rude as to listen in.  Yeah.  That's me, RUDE.  He assured me 15 to 20 minutes.  I told him if that was in addition to the 10 that we'd already waited we'd be happy to find food elsewhere.  He managehed to find us a table in the next 5 minutes.\n\nLet me say, our server was fantastic!  She was cheerful and perky with the kids (who were tired from their great trip to Alcatraz.)  \n\nWe ordered and the food came up fast.  It was mediocre at best.  The kids enjoyed their corn dogs and fries.  My sister and I had the carnitas tacos.  Very little flavor BUT they weren't aggresively bad, just mediocre.  My brother-in-law said that same about his burger.\n\nWe went to Boudin the next day.  Much better taste.  Kids were happier and, no waiting...", "author": "Anne S."}

Hard to miss the place, look for the big surf board sign. Now I am sure that mostly tourists come here since its on Pier 39 but this place has a lot going on. They have some great craft beers, all were served really cold. I had fried food. Coconut shrimp and calamari...Both were really really good. They have a nice bar and some big TV's spread throughout with constant surfing videos streaming. The fire pit out front is great for those chilly San Fran nights.

My Fiance ordered the calamari as an appetizer, which was alright very panko and of course greasy. The fries I heard were not that great either. His brother ordered a beer and it came out last, after all our food and appetizer. Oh, and the appetizer came out after our food was already there. The waitress checked back many times which I really appreciated. He got the BBQ chicken pizza, which I thought was mediocre as well.

Great surf like environment on a sunny day. Surfer dude manikins with my hot bod flaunted my reflection, humorous signs, giggles and plenty of tables circled the joint.

Greeted in the entry area by a Sean Penn surfer statue/dummy lookalike...Funny, since he lives in the area. \n\nRating: 3.5 overall...Fantastic service...but formula food. Great for sports bar type of dining or for grabbing apps and drinks. Feeding the kid really quickly, etc.\n\nFood: Very well prepared and presented but just not anything fantastic...however a 4 for dessert. Even the fried foods are lighter than comparable places. Surprised by how light all of the meals were -- even the banana split was light vs. gooey. Very light, fresh salads with hearty portions. Easily share an app and a salad and call it a night. Chinese chicken salad more along the Thai peanut flavors lime flavors -- pleasant taste, but not what expected based upon the description (the ingredients were almost identical to a South Beach recipe we tried in the past). Kid's meals $5.99 inclusive of drink-- fish and chips (aka fish nuggets) were a hit with our stinky cheese eating bug. Fun wine selections and interesting drinks and \"spritzers\" to match personality of restaurant although the usual silly mark-ups.\n\nService: Fantastic service with on-the-nose recommendations and exceptionally fast response and food delivery. We were sitting by the server stations and eavesdropped on the fun, frustrations and interaction between the various servers and management running through the area. A favorite server from another restaurant was also working the dinner shift -- hopefully she's only there because the other place is closed for dinner on Sundays! For now, servers aren't spread thin around too many tables and there are many other folks ready to step in as necessary.\n\nReservations: They only take reservations for 6 or more, but when we walked in we were seated efficiently.\n\nDecor: Surfer, beach walk everything; even the little corner \"tourist\" gear store. Huge digital screens throughout the restaurant. The bathrooms are covered by a cabana entrance with a common sink area for both sexes -- so a good idea to go with your kids to use the bathroom. Outdoor bonfire with beach chairs is a cute touch although our little one asked if we could come back and make smores. \n\n$60+ for 2 adult entrees, an app, drinks and a child dinner?

He was fun, energetic, and the best part was, his awesome socks. I found his service prompt as well as compassionate when he was serving us as well his other tables around the est. That's a great quality to have in your waiter when out to eat. That quality service is getting harder to find these days. Who woulda thought, wipeout bar and grill would be the place to find excellence. Thanks for the great experience, we will be back. Also, Mr. Munn we will be looking for you especially.  So don't go finding a new job or anything...  thanks, and you have won me over. This place will see me and any visiting friends I have in the future. Pier 39, you are not justfor the tourists. What can I say, Good service is addictive. I will be back for sure.", "author": "Chris R."}

We then asked them if we could use a coupon for a free kids meal in combination with another 20% off coupon. They said no, but they would let us get an extra free kids meal with the purchase of the adult entree. So that sounded nice. When the food came, mine was the wrong dish, and my wife's didn't come right away. They sent my dish back to get me what I ordered, and then we waited while our friends were eating. When mine finally came it was good, but wife's didn't arrive until about when mine did(the second time)- it was soup and salad, so how long would that take to prepare!? We go to pay, and we notice that they only gave us 1 free kids meal, and when we brought their attention to it, they said that my wife's 12.95 soup and salad was not an \"entree\". I asked if they could make an exception, the server said she would ask a manager. She came back and said the manager couldn't do it but they were asking another manager. A little while later she came back and told us that this other manager said they can't do it, because the computer won't allow it. Lame excuse- really disappointed with their service.", "author": "Jason B."}

We were there mid week at around 3pm. They're was lack of communication with our server... not til we were about done did she check on us. Apparently I order an appetizer of a bread bowl and salad so I couldn't use my kid's eat free coupon. She could have told me that I ordered an appetizer since she knew I was trying to use that coupon before I even ordered! The management wouldn't honor the coupon after our served asked 2 managers. I would have totally ordered something else if I would have known! I think my order got forgotten cause I had to ask another server about it.  My food came out about 30 minutes after the rest of my party! So if I ordered an appetizer shouldn't my food have come out first? The only reason I gave 2 stars is because of the taste of my food.

It was one of those cold evenings at Pier 39, and we were super glad to be rushed to our seats at a warm table inside. \n\nThere was some sort of police/security activity going on when we arrived... it seemed like a few teenage girls were angry about a discrepancy in their bill from an earlier event. Why they couldn't talk to the manager without bringing in the cavalry is beyond me. Either way... it made the experience more interesting, and didn't take away from our enjoyment.\n\nThe initial service wasn't super fast. I had a feeling that the commotion up front had something to do with that... but either way, it was about 10 minutes before our server had dropped by to ask us for our beverage selection. Once we had his attention though, he was on the ball. \n\nWe started off with chips & salsa, but the \"roasted tomato salsa\" left much to be desired. It didn't have any kick whatsoever. We ended up dropping in a lot of Tapatio to spice things up.\n\nFor the main event, I ordered the California Burger that comes with a 1/2 lb burger, guacamole, bacon, and a gloriously toasted bun. It was super delicious. My wife ordered the Teriyaki & Pineapple sandwich, which she said was good, but she wasn't super excited about it.\n\nOverall, it was nice to get out of the cold and have a juicy burger lathered in guacamole.

With 2 entrees a beer and an Iced Tea, $32 isn't bad. This place is one of the first restaurants you see when getting to Pier 39.

If I lived nearby, I'd take him up on it. But given I only visit SF occasionally, I'm leaving it with my one visit for breakfast.

As I said, SF can be a bit pricey, the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl was $13.95, but it was okay because it was tasty!  The calamari was $8.95 so times two that's $17.

The bathrooms are like going into a cabana on the beach and then there's a bunch of flip flops stuck on the wall.\nWhat I really have against this place is the gall they have to charge $8 for a beer. Are you kidding me?! Granted, I think it comes in a liter glass instead of a pint, but still, that's beyond ridiculous.

Some say its a bit pricey, but what do you expect from a Restaurant thats at the Pier. Anyhoo, I ordered some Fish and Chips. Super good. My Fiancee always like the plate I get. He ordered a Burger with Pineapple and some garlic fries. Very good! Its a great place to hang out on a sunny day... Come and eat here when your hungry because the serving is BIG.

A beautiful summer day at the wharf, so we decided to sit outside.  The hostess decided it would be funny to sit us on the table where the sun would shine directly into our eyes.  After my adamant demands to sit on a decent table with some shade, she directs us to a dirty table, picks up the dirty cups, tosses the two menus on the table....not even wiping the table, mind you, or even moving the silverware from the skin cancer table to the decent dirty table.  Not that I minded the beast of a waitress too much.  They were like picnic tables anyway. Greeted by a nice lady in shades.  Asked her what drinks were good.  She recommended this one drink called a Sunset something....DELISH and dangerous. Had I had a couple more of those, I would've been buzzed enough to start surfing on our table.  Ordered a shrimp and steak stir fry with coconut rice and fresh veggies, and my taste buds thoroughly enjoyed their take on Asian cuisine.  Now I would have given this place 5 stars, but the bill came out and my tiny drink came out to $9!!! $9?!?! What the heck?? I should've worn my \"Buy me a drink, it's my birthday\" shirt at that rate! Service was decent except towards the end, I had to send out a search team to track down the waitress with our check and another worker for a box. Good to go at least once for the experience. Fun.", "author": "Chow Mein Ninj A."}

We stopped in to the Wipeout, not expecting culinary perfection, but at least on the level of perhaps a national chain such as Fridays, Chili's, etc. The mexican portion of the menu looked promising, so we ordered, beginning with a couple of margaritas. Big mistake. We would have sworn they were virgin drinks, absolutely no taste of alcohol whatever, and totally bland. After mentioning it to the server, he said he would ask the bartender. He returned and said the bar puts \"4-1/2 oz of tequila and triple sec\" in each drink. I've made plenty of margaritas in my day, and can promise you that was not the case. Rather than make the drinks decently, he offered to bring us something else instead. We ordered a couple of french martinis. They brought those out, and they were good, except for the fact the glasses were only half full. Just glad to get something drinkable, we didn't complain. Anyway, our food came-a burrito plate and a taco plate. Both were stone cold. In order for a burrito to get that cold clear on the inside, it would have had to have sat for at least 10 minutes or so. Anyway, after we complained, they took the food away, and in a few minutes brought out some warm food. The food was average at best, but once again we were just happy to have something edible. Anyway, at the end of the meal the manager stopped out and apologized for the cold food, and reinforced their claim that the margaritas have 4-1/2 oz. of alcohol. He said he took the margaritas off the bill, like that was doing us a big favor. When we got the bill, we were charged $16 apiece for the french martinis! Granted, we had ordered them with Grey Goose vodka, but still, I've never paid that much for a drink in my life, let alone a half full one! Ridiculous! After another complaint, he reduced it to $13 each, still not exactly cheap. Anyway, I suggest you avoid this place at all costs!!!!!!", "author": "John L."}

I have been here before and was not happy.. THIS TIME.. well lets just say NOT AN IMPROVEMENT. My bloody mary was made for a toddler, so not spicy like I had asked for it. As I'm eating my breadbowl a pigeon comes up and lands on it. I'm like great now i have nothing to eat. So i through the rest of the bread bowl and the pigeon (yaya your not supposed to but it wouldnt go away from me!) So this chick runs out and starts yelling at me to not feed the birds and I was like well seeing as it landed in my food, and was not  moving away from me it seemed like the safest thing for me to do. So then she sends out her manager who takes it off the tab. But the woman was so rude and offensive I had to write a review. Just a note to restaurant owners/managers you shouldn't hire people who make customers hate your restaurant because of this one persons actions. Proper training in customer service is a plus.", "author": "Katie M."}

Knew that most restaurants in touristy Fisherman's Wharf would be mediocre food which we were okay with.  Had out of town visitors so taking them around SF.  There was a short line to get seated, but because we had a slightly larger group, I asked how long.  Was quoted 10 minutes.  I asked the hostess if she was sure it would only be 10 minutes given our larger party, and told her we had young hungry kids to please be upfront about wait.  She reaffirmed it.  After 15 minutes, I asked a different hostess, and she said anytime now.  After another 10 minute wait, they told me it would probably be another 15 minutes.  I was not happy about it.  Totally understand that it's hard to tell how long, but they were confident in being able to seat us, and even after the much delayed seating, didn't even apologize.  Well, I suppose they cater to tourists and don't really care about being friendly.", "author": "Pete T."}

Mostly hamburgers, sandwiches, burritos, starters, maybe one steak on the menu and drinks.  The place was themed as a Hawaiian/Surf bar, but obviously a Pier 39 stage.   I went into the restroom and on the way out, I looked at what the others were ordering. Their customers mostly ordered burgers which I did not order after noticing how dry and home made they looked, nothing handpatted.  I decided to order a carne asada burrito but it was decent at best and gringo-ish.  Only the starters were a litlle better, their garlic fries was fair and their calamari.   The drinks were a bit pricey mostly more than half of the entrees.  My glass of flat tire was $8.46.  All in all it was your basic Pier 39, theme park food, decent but not worth the bill.", "author": "Foodie B."}
