Well, really, it probably comes down to proximity. But it doesn't hurt when the park is surrounded by beautiful architecture and breath-taking cityscapes. \n\nQuite obviously, Huntington Park's proximity to Grace Cathedral provides for an excellent place to rest your gaze. Between the cathedral itself, and all the people activity fluttering around it, you'll have plenty of reasons to look that direction. \n\nHowever, don't forget to do a 360 and take in the rest of the scenery. To the east is the Pacific Union Club in a charming old brownstone. To the south, you get beautiful views of the city (and those NEVER get old).  After your park time, you can also walk just a little further east and see the Fairmont (and maybe check out Tonga Room while you're at it.)\n\nFinally, unless you're coming from the most immediate (north) area, you also likely get a nice exercise walking up one of many steep streets. Not every steep street in SF leads to such a reward, so savor it and enjoy the park for all that it's worth.", "author": "Jon T."}

It's a true treasure, but note it's one of the smallest parks in the city! Yet, I adore this park because of how well maintained it is and how it's tucked between The Fairmont and Grace Cathedral. \n\nHuntington Park is a \"family friendly\" park and of course \"dog friendly\" too. There's a small children's playground at one corner and a couple of early art deco fountains to enjoy. The park was formerly the site of the mansion of railroad baron C.P. Huntington (yup him again, he also has a waterfall in Golden Gate Park lol); his mansion was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake, however, and his widow donated the property to the city to establish a park in 1915, hence the park's name. \n\nThis is secretly one of my regular parks that I truly enjoy. Maybe because I used to live just a couple blocks away and enjoyed Grace Cathedral too. I quickly became a regular to just clear my head and watch the dogs and dog owners. Enjoy the little ones playing and actually feeling safe! The park's location being on one of the highest points in the city probably discourages the homeless away. I mean if not riding a cable car who wants to walk up vertical hills just for a park? Sorry just being real. One thing is certain I love how intimate it is, just make sure your pooch is on a leash & you clean up after yourself...", "author": "Eric R."}

It's a little square of (some) green atop Nob Hill. There's a fountain, a dog park, some grass, and that's pretty much it. But it offers up a nice respite after a hike up the steep streets. The views of Grace Cathedral are great, as well as the Fairmount and other chic hotels atop the hill. And if you angle yourself correctly, you can get some slivers of nice views between the towers off down the hill in a few directions. \n\nWhen it comes to city parks, I like 'em big and green. So this underwhelms on that front. But no matter what time of day you roll through here, there are some interesting folks. In the afternoon/evenings, it's the dog people and maybe some tourists. In the morning, I find folks up from Chinatown using it as a calm spot for Tai Chi or calisthenics.

Oh sure, you'll hear the term \"Snob Hill\" thrown around from time to time.  Haters gonna hate.  I would advise that you're far better served to appreciate. \n\nLet's be honest.  The history of San Francisco and California is one of wealth.  You might not want to hear it, but this was a land settled by people who wanted to one day be the millionaires and billionaires.  People of all backgrounds came to take a run at the golden life - and for that matter, they still do today.  Standing at the top of Nob Hill, I think back to the titans of industry that created the San Francisco.  And, candidly, I think of the titans who continue to shape SF today.  Tech money comes and goes, but the fundamentals remain.  One fundamental that linked San Francisco to the modern world were the railroads.  It was a game changer to be able to come by rail instead of an epic ship voyage around South America, or a Donner Party like debacle in a wagon.  This park take its name from one of the Big Four railroad tycoons of the 19th Century:  Collis Huntington.  The park was donated by his widow in 1915, and it serves as a gorgeous spot to enjoy your day.\n\nThis is a relatively small park, basically one block on each side.  There are nice features like a central fountain, sculpture, benches, beautiful flowers and a nice playground.  But, it's the surroundings that make it.  Huntington Park is surrounded by such gems as The Fairmont Hotel, Mark Hopkins Hotel, Scarlett Huntington Hotel (yep, same Huntington), the Masonic Auditorium, Grace Cathedral, the Pacific-Union Club and of course the mighty California Cable Car Line.  This is an elegant little square that has played and plays home to some of the most important people in San Francisco.  Guess what?  You can come up here and be part of it.  I would contend that there are few nicer places to sit on a park bench and read a book, sip on coffee or just watch people playing with their kids or dogs while they pass through.  Take a few laps, look out over the vistas of The City.  Head whichever way downhill you wish, there are great places to venture off to.  Do yourself a favor - get a ride up!  It's steep hills on three of the four sides.\n\nIf you have never been to SF, I would put this on your list of places you should see if it's a sunny day.  Come and be part of history.  But, please, if you're taking the Cable Car up from downtown, don't do it at rush hour after work.", "author": "Adam S."}

Another thing that's irksome is that these \"regulars\" actually believe that they own the park, and will actually attempt to get rid of you if they don't like your face. Can you say, mob mentality?

You could sit on one of the many benches and read a book or work on your laptop without being bothered.  A few well-behaved, on-leash dogs made regular appearances with their respectful owners.  There was peaceful coexistence and mutual regard.\n\nSomewhere along the line, it became an (unofficial) off-leash dog park.  A lot of days there are more dogs running around than people trying to enjoy the park, which tells me the professional dog walkers have discovered this park and some of the locals have given up trying to enjoy it.\n\nSome months ago, the grassy areas were fenced off so that they could be re-sodded.  Then signs went up asking dog owners/walkers to keep their dogs on leash and off the grass, to not allow them to pee and poo on it, so that the greenery could thrive and the humans could enjoy the park to its fullest.  But none of this has been adhered to by the entitled dog owners/walkers.  Once again, the grass has that matted, burned out look from overuse and too much pee-ing and poo-ing.  The smell is horrific.  Too many of the dogs are off leash and very ill behaved.  They jump in the central fountain, then come out and shake themselves off, never mind if you are sitting nearby, dressed beautifully, trying with all your might to focus on your reading or your work or to just relax.  Forget bringing your laptop to take advantage of the public WiFi and to get some work done while sunning.  If you don't keep an eye on the animals, some of them will eventually run over to you and knock that laptop off your lap.  No one seems to be minding them.  Not their owners.  Not their professional walkers.  No one.\n\nThis is just a small neighborhood park.  There are frail elderly people, disabled people, and children trying to use and enjoy it.  A few weeks ago, I met a physically disabled friend there before heading off for lunch.  As she was waiting for me to arrive, several large, unleashed dogs approached her and jumped up in excitement and put their paws on her upper body.  It threw her off balance, and she had to struggle to remain standing.  We both love dogs, so we don't blame them.  But where were their owners/walkers?  Don't they realize they have a responsibility to the public to ensure their dogs don't hurt anyone and don't prove to be a nuisance to others?\n\nWhere are the enforcers of the leash laws?  Why isn't anyone in authority up there handing out citations at least twice a week and sending the professional dog walkers to larger parks that can handle that kind of dog traffic and off leash antics?\n\nI really don't like what has become of my formerly beautiful, peaceful park.  I feel very let down by my fellow humans and by the authorities who are supposed to be keeping them in check.", "author": "J D."}

It's not far but it's a climb up to this park.  \n\nIt has a decent fountain and park to sit and relax with a playground for kids.\n\nIt's next to Grace Cathedral, Huntington Apts? and is really a nice view of the city if you stand by the road.  Friendly residents sunning or tourists on the way up or down the hill are who you would see here.  It's also next to an old club.  Snobby hill is more an apt description of the area because of its former and current residents being on the wealthy side.\n\nIf you need somewhere quiet away from the hustle and bustle of Union Square and a higher view of San Francisco, this is a good spot.  Bring a sandwich and a drink and relax.\n\nThe climb down was much easier on this tired knees.  Next visit, I will bring Apricot and Brian up here for a nice break.\n\nOh and it is on a cable car route so if you can't stand the climb, take the cable car back down.", "author": "Melanio F."}

I have lived in Nob Hill for 6 years and its just getting worse.\n\nThere have been multiple incidents involving off-leash dogs biting, knocking down, and mauling both children and other dogs and neither the city nor the owners seem to care enough to do anything about it.  \n\nThe grass has to be constantly watered because the flood of dog piss is too acidic for it to survive.  The fountains have become a giant dog bath and are littered with fur and funk.  There is crap all over the grass that isn't picked up by dog owners who break the leash law.  It's just gross.  9 out of 10 times I ride the cable car I hear a Local describe Huntington Park as The Dog Park.  Awesome.  I see connections on Facebook who live in the Sunset and the Richmond district BRING their dogs to Huntington Park so they can run off-leash.\n\nQuite a shame, given the history and the location of such a potentially beautiful park.", "author": "Hannah A."}

They love to practice thai-chi and such.  Everyone is super friendly here, I've never really encountered any weirdos like some of the other parks in SF. \n\nThe park itself is directly across from Grace Cathedral, which is a pretty stunning looking building that looks gorgeous at night time. \n\nIf you like dog watching, I definitely recommend coming by Huntington Park, you will see ample variety of different kinds.  \n\nMy favorite memory here, a pug meetup with ~30 pugs playing with eachother.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-20", "description": "Situated smack in the middle of some magnificent turn of the 20th Century buildings- Grace Cathedral, Fairmont + Mark Hopkins Hotels, and the Crocker Mansion, this one block formal four square garden features a centrally located fountain, children's play area, lots of park benches, and good size grassy areas for sunbathing and dogs.\n\nThis park now sits where the mansion first owned by General David D. Colton, a railroad attorney and then by Central Pacific railroad baron Collis P. Huntington resided until its untimely demise in the Great Earthquake and Fire of 1906.  In 1915, the land was donated to the City of San Francisco to be used forever as a park which has seen numerous renovations but the well loved children's playground still has yet to be updated.\n\nOne of its centerpieces is the Fountain of Tortoises which is surrounded by many benches shaded by cherry trees.  It's a surprisingly quiet and peaceful place to read the paper and eat your lunch and people and dog watch as they strut by. Lots of dog owners come here to congregate, chat and let their dogs roam some.  Maybe because it was a warm day, a couple of cute and big Golden Retrievers jumped into the fountain to cool off and stayed in there forawhile.\n\nA fine patch of green to soak up the sun.", "author": "Jen L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-18", "description": "You can drive up, MUNI up, or Cable Car up, but I usually walk up to the park. From Mason Street, the hill is ridiculously steep, from Taylor Street, even steeper. So steep, there are steps on the sidewalk! If your legs and lungs can handle it, go for it. I grew up coming to this park, so the walk up is no biggie to me. My out-of-town friends were actually the ones who pointed out how abnormally steep the surrounding hills are. Still, I think the walk up is part of the attraction. When you reach the top, look back at what you've accomplished and you'll notice a pretty darn good view!\n\nAgain, I grew up coming to this park, so, I love it! It's small with a couple of playgrounds and a couple of fountains. I went from the little kids' playground to the bigger kids' playground. I used to climb around the fountains AND my Mommy used to let me!!! I recall staring at the many penises of the fountains and getting a kick out of it. I recall stealing coins from the large fountain, while trying to duck from my Mommy's view.\n\nAs an adult, after many years of not visiting the park, I went one night while drunk (seems like I used to do A LOT at night while drunk) and swung on the swings. It had been awhile since I even sat on a swing so you know I had a ball. We couldn't stop laughing...hard, stomach-crunching laughs! Of course, I've returned many times after that night. I can't recreate the laughter of that first night back, but I still have a great time each time. Ooh, I think San Francisco vampires congregate here! One night we saw a young woman floating by with a hooded black cape and a candle. She stared at us while gliding by...kinda spooky, but totally worth seeing again!\n\nAlthough fun and nostalgic, it loses a star for being located in such a boojie area. Not a lot of selection for food. Sometimes I like going to places and having last minute picnics. Not enough affordable options in the area for that. Boojie doesn't stop there...the No Ma'am Club that's located right by the park, ew! Beautiful building, but after working this many years with the homeless and extremely low-income population, seeing how rich folks spend their time and money kinda piss me off.", "author": "Helen L."}

Twice a year we visit Grandma and Grandpa in L.A. and the munchkin gets to experience an enormous backyard with fruit trees, grapevines, a gazebo, flower gardens and a fountain; for months thereafter I have to listen to whining along the lines of \"Mommy, I wanna move to Los Angeles!\" and \"Mommy, I wish we had a backyard!\"\n\nNow that she's getting older and wiser, she's starting to understand when I explain that, while we may not have our very own backyard, we DO have four parks within a 10-minute walk from home. So, in essence, we have FOUR backyards.\n\nThe most scenic of which is Huntington Park.\n\nHuntington Park is a postage-stamp-sized park at the foot of Grace Cathedral and the Huntington Hotel. The kid doesn't remember, but there are pictures of her in the \"baby swings\" at 8 months - all chubby thighs and new teeth and hanging on for dear life - then, 4 months later and just days away from her first steps, propped up against one of the fountains in her birthday dress.\n\nSince then she has grown to brave first the slide and then the jungle gym by herself. Most recently, a few days ago, she surprised me by going back and forth across the monkey bars with no spotter.\n\nRight now the trees are blossoming. In 6 months or so the leaves will turn. A couple of months after that the trees will be decked out with colorful Christmas bulbs...the big, old-fashioned kind. There isn't a day of the year when the park isn't beautiful in some way.\n\nLucky for us, it's practically right in our own backyard.", "author": "Valeria R."}

Since I no longer live near my beloved Golden Gate Park (or have rooftop access) I have found a new sunbathing haven which even tops my former beloved: Huntington Park!\n\n+ Grab a book--it's quiet enough to read here. There is a playground but there aren't enough kids here (or at least their Nob Hill-ite parents/ nannies wouldn't let their progeny run too wild) to make it irritating.\n+ Grab a blanket/ towel--or sit on one the MANY benches they have. The grass is considerably clean. I haven't encountered any poopies, cigarette butts/ roaches, or broken bottles of Steel Reserve (ahem, Dolores)...yet. This place seems too frou frou for any of that malarkey (I know that's not the correct use of the word but  it just sounds so good!). \n+ NO CREEPERS taking pictures of you while you sleep/ sunbathe (ahem, GG). Gross. I still shudder at the memories I've tried to repress.\n+ Great views (Grace Cathedral, cable cars, etc.)\n+ Dog-watching/ stalking (for all you pup-o-philes who aren't allowed to have their own at home)\n\nBask in peace at Huntington Park.

Thus these women substitute their dogs in place of their baby desires and dress their poor dogs in silly hats, jackets and bows. I believe I even saw shoes on a dog once.\n\nBesides the locals the park is very nice, although small. The park has a front and center view of Grace Cathedral.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-09-02", "description": "This is my favorite park in San Francisco. It is not because of the playground sandbox, and Cherry Blossom trees. But, because of the rich San Francisco history here. I love diving into history.  So ladies and gentlemen let's pretend this is the history channel for a moment.\n\nThis dog friendly park is on some of the original land owned by the barons who ruled over San Francisco, California, and the entire Western United States for that matter. They controlled the Transcontinental Railroad and as a result they all became very rich. They were called the Big Four and they, along with their attorneys, (yes it was even happening then), controlled the wealth. \n\nC.P. Huntington, Leland Stanford, Mark Hopkins, and Charles Crocker. These men played a big role in making San Francisco the New York City of the west.  Los Angeles was actually a smaller city during these times.\n\nThe land which Huntington Park sits on was owned by Huntington and before that the Colton family.  General Colton was an Railroad attorney who lived in style and splendor in a giant wooden mansion on this site until he died in 1878. After his death, his widow decided to close the house and move to Washington D.C..  \n\nIn 1892, railroad baron and one of the \"Big Four\" himself, Collis P. Huntington purchased the mansion.  Yet he was only able to enjoy this place for eight years, as he died in 1900. The mansion was later completely destroyed and gutted by the 1906 earthquake and fire. In 1915, his widow Arabella, donated this land to the city under the condition that it would remain a city park for perpetuity.\n\nHence, the birth of the Huntington Park.  A beautiful replica of the Roman Fontane delle Tartarughe, (Fountain of the Tortoises), which was donated by the Crocker family children in 1954, resides in the center of the park. The Crocker family once owned the mansion and land which is now occupied by Grace Cathedral.\n\nThe park is surrounded by both Grace Cathedral,  and the bizarre, \"eyes wide shut,\" Pacific Union Club Building, which was formerly the Flood Mansion. This building is now home to a private conservative club . But it is cool to note that the Flood mansion was the only one to survive the 1906 earthquake. When you get up close, you can see why.  It is a huge stone fortress. Creep up the steps and peer in the glass.  You might get a glimpse of Dick Cheney lurking down a dark hallway.\n\nHuntington Park is my favorite city park because when I'm here, I can sense all this city history. You can feel it in the gentle breeze. It also gets an ample amount of sunshine and is in close proximity to San Francisco's most beautiful hotels.\n\nMy routine is to stroll into the park with my morning cappuccino and take a seat by the fountain, while watching my chinese neighbors march and stretch out their morning Tai Chi, as the sun burns through the fog behind the Mark Hopkins.", "author": "Georgio N."}

GET YOUR DOG SOME TRAINING AND KEEP IT ON A LEASH IF IT DISPLAYS AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR.  \n\nJust so happens in one of my case law classes I've been assigned to a CA case about aggressive dog behavior and it being the OWNER's responsibility for ANY damage the dog causes.  So as I see it, you are liable for and can be sued for your dogs behavior...  See California Code of Civil Procedures 3342(a) - Just google it, you'll find it an eye opening read.\n\n*** Previous Review ***\n5 stars because of its convenience ~ that is, there are nights where I don't feel like taking the trusted friend out but know when I walk through my front door she is there a-waiting-n-wagging her big fluffy tail, happy to see me and especially happy because she knows within minutes we'll be on our way.  \n\nSo in short, our walks together are the highlight of her day and I hate to disappoint, so Hooray for Huntington Park as its a quick walk up the hill.  I'm happy, the DaWg is happy, and when my nieces come to visit, they're happy too.  \n\nYes, this park is more for the kiddies, but allows the doggies to play too.  And on nice warm sunny days you can find most people parked on benches sun worshipping as they read (or snooze) while their precious pooch plays with other pooches.  \n\nI hear that Thursday night there is a happy hour; suppose this is an excuse for me to drop by Le Beau before heading up and bring a bottle of vino on our next trip up the hill.  \n\nFridays are certainly happy hour, and not the kind of happy hour that you and I participate in.  But it is certainly happy hour for the pooches.  I was amazed how many folks, before heading out to dinner, etc., bring the pooches out for play.  It was certainly happy hour for the pooches and all played well together, rolling in the wet grass, and playfully bouncing on and off the benches, chasing one another all over the park.  Too darned cute is all I can say.", "author": "Cris B."}

After his death in 1878, his widow closed the house, then sold it five years later to Central Pacific railroad exec Collis P. Huntington, who resided in it with his wife until he passed away in 1900.  She remained in it until it was destroyed by the quake and fire of 1906. In 1915, Mrs. Huntington donated the land to the city with the stipulation it forever be a park. The classic square forms the heart of Nob Hill, and its many benches provide a place to catch your breath after the grueling hike up the California Street hill. The Fountain of the Tortoises, replicating one in Rome, features cavorting turtles and nymphs and is lit by eight underwater lamps that, during the holidays, are changed from clear to red, amber, and green. Since the late 1970s, the park has been overseen by the Nob Hill Association.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

But not so much that it taints the Huntington Park experience in any way. It's a very clean, unique and intimate urban park with the towering cathedral on one side and the old Flood Mansion on the other. I like this place in the late afternoon and evening, especially toward Summer and Fall when the sides of the buildings downtown reflect the golden sunset. Sit on one of the benches and meditate on the fountain in the center, then stroll over to Grace Cathedral and walk the labyrinth. Then come back and pet some dogs.", "author": "Roxmarie M."}

Located right on top of Nob Hill, it's the perfect berth to view multiple SF institutions 360 degrees around: the California cable car, Grace Cathedral, the Fairmont and Mark Hopkins hotels, the Masonic Auditorium, and let's not forget the views of the City to the south and east.  I don't know any SF park with as many benches per square foot.  So you're almost guaranteed a place to sit and relax.  It's the best on those warm SF days with the sun glowing and fountain flowing .", "author": "M A N I K."}

I like to sit on the grass and watch people as they try to parallel park their oversize cars in spaces too small.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-01-14", "description": "I work near Union Square and hike up the several blocks of STEEP hill regularly to eat lunch at this park. Walking up Taylor Street, you get to use the stairs that are built into the sidewalk, so that's a plus. This is a tiny, one-block park, with a lot of things going for it. First of all, for a lunch-breaker like myself, looking for a nice bench to sit on -- this park has dozens of benches. Which works well for how varied the weather can be. If it's cold, you can find somewhere to sit in the sun, and if it's warm and you're exhausted from hiking up the hill, there are benches in the shade. I don't like sharing a bench, and I've never had to, since there are so many. Then there is a big fountain in the middle of the park and some swing sets in the back. I haven't tried swinging yet... there usually are children back there with their parents. The grassy middle sections of the park are highly kept up, with everything looking perfect and maintained. On sunny days there are often a handful of people laying in the grass working on their tans, and on any day, there are a surprising number of people walking their micro-dogs in that park. I've never seen so many tiny dogs consistently in one location. It's a great people-watching park... most folks seem to be moderately affluent locals who probably live there on Nob Hill. (I've never seen a homeless person there, although I've never seen any police or security there either.) The view includes California Street and the cable cars, Grace Cathedral, the big hotels (Fairmont, Mark Hopkins, etc.), some great other historic architecture, and then also, when you look towards the east you can see the Bay Bridge. The perimeter of the park has some really pretty light-pink rose bushes, and are gorgeous when they're in bloom. It's just a delightful lunch spot, and worth the hike up there!", "author": "Zoe H."}
