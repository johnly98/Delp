Probably best Indian restaurant in the Noe Valley/Mission/Castro/Glen Park area.  Highlights are the saag paneer, the samosas, and the various naan.  The tandoori items tend to be a bit dry and once they got a little too aggressive with the meat tenderizer in my butter chicken.  But otherwise pretty solid.  They are very spice-forward, so don't expect too much delicate subtlety in some of the flavor profiles.", "author": "David O."}

No other customers.  Guy took our order.  Then proceeded to take phone orders, which he went back and prepared and handed to the delivery guys before STARTING our order.  Must have been half an hour when he finally brought out our fried eggplant appetizer.  Huge.  Inedible.  Stinking of rancid oil.  We left it on the plate.  The waiter spent another half hour in the kitchen.  Finally, we asked him to cancel half of our dinner and bring us what was already prepared.  More than an hour after we entered this empty restaurant he brought us our fish tandoori and rice.  The fish was edible, though the oil was again bad.  Rice was OK.  I immediately asked for the bill when dinner arrived so we could escape.  When he brought the bill, it still had all the items that we previously canceled on it, so he had to redo the bill.  \n\nI don't know how this place stays in business in the busy, competitive San Francisco restaurant scene.  Why didn't I do 3 minutes of research?  I'll never get that 90 minutes of my life back.  And for the first time in many, many years (10 years?  more?) I left no tip.", "author": "Greg S."}

They said the food came from India Clay on Church.\n\nMy Hyderabadi Chicken, though decent sized pieces, was tough and had  had ZERO Apricot's in it, not like what I'm used to. Yes it's not fair to blame one restaurant for not being as good as another but I do want to warn folk they are not INTERCHANGABLE. My husband's Lamb Jal-Frazie was good he thought, but we both agreed though having chosen mild, it was more like medium. Fine if  you want medium spice.\n\nAs our order didn't arrive until 1 hour and 30 mins after we ordered online via Grub hub. Indian food spiced medium-ish at 10:30...only if you are young or don't mind eating Tum's all night.\n\nOne thing better at this location, the N'aan is much nicer. More generous pieces and nicer texture, less grease. I wish I could have their bread at the other location but at the end of the day, the entree trumps all.", "author": "Susan F."}

There's this lady that lives in my neighborhood that is straight crazy...or \"eccentric\" if you're being gentle. She looks wealthy, loves to eat out alone & on some days is very nice & chatty, on other days, she's walking around leaving monologue style messages on friends' (imaginary I suspect) voicemails with tons of curse words...and she's usually screaming. Anyway, one day she was at the Clay Oven losing her shit & they would.not.kick.her.out. It took them like 20 minutes to make her leave.\n\nAnyway, order the tandoori chicken, the chicken saag, the okra dish, or the eggplant & you'll be happy as hell. Definitely get rice. The pappadum is better than the naan. The yogurt sauce is necessary if you get your food spicy. They also make an awesome hot sauce if you ask politely. Hell, you can yell at them, they'll still make it for you.\n\nThe lunchtime buffet is often quiet & has amazing food & a good price. I think it's $12.99 to fat it out & eat enough for a weekday food coma.\n\nWhite table clothes, adorable serving bowls (copper), very clean bathroom, beautiful painting on the wall & lovely service. Seriously, like \"I can't date you b/c you're too nice\" nice.\n\nTIP: I've only ordered from them once or twice & it was delivered fine & on time, but they seem to have issues with that, so walk or drive to pick it up.", "author": "Stephanie F."}

If you don't want to read this rantish paragraph.. skip to the next one! So I was supposed to go to Kome Sushi Buffet with my friends but the line was ridiculously long. I was so looking forward to eating lots of sushi!! After awhile we gave up and tried to go to Regent Thai and found out it was closed since it was Christmas week ): EVEN MORE DISAPPOINTMENT. So lastly... my friend suggested Clay Oven. I like Indian food and all but after looking forward to all you can eat sushi, I was still pretty sad ): Anyways...\n\nWe came here for the lunch buffet. There were only two other tables of people when we got there. The selection included lamb, tandoori chicken, naan, curry, some kinda rice, fried fish or calamari (I forgot what it was!) and some vegetarian dishes. Everything was just okay. The food was pretty lukewarm... I guess that's expected since it's a buffet... but still it made the food worse than it probably was. My favorites were the fried fish/calamari/whatever it was and the naan. I feel like those shouldn't be favorites at an Indian restaurant. Well except the naan I guess. It's just that everything was bland and just average. I don't think I'll be coming back.", "author": "Sandra N."}

But I was a bit wary considering every time I walked by, there were very few people actually dining there. First things first, it seems like the majority of people who eat here either order take-out or delivery. So don't be dissuaded on that front. I chose the take-out option. Bonus: Only took 10 minutes for my order to be ready.\n\nAfter reading mediocre reviews that kept me away, it looked like they were on the up and up so I decided to give it a try. My order: naan, vegetable samosa, chana masala, and rice. \n\nMy barometer for a good Indian restaurant is the quality of their naan. Hot and fluffy with just the right amount of crisp on the edges. I'm sad to say that their naan was lukewarm and kind of floppy. If I had to guess, they need to let the dough rise more and keep their tandoor at a lower temperature so that the bread has more time to bake without burning. Veggie samosa: just okay. Also on the lukewarm side and the pastry shell was kind of greasy rather than flaky. Chana masala: I ordered it medium-spicy and I like hot things. This was maybe a shade too hot. Overall, halfway decent and the curry was just the right consistency. Rice: Pretty much your standard basmati rice. Light and fluffy...and they gave me some fresh green peas as a bonus!\n\nEnd result: The food is merely okay. I didn't feel the need to spit it out, but I also didn't feel compelled to save the leftovers either. The person who took my order on the phone was very nice and the woman who cashed me out was sweet, which counts for something.

(Estimated wait time was 45-60 minutes.)  Needless to say, super disappointed.  After telling the driver it's been two hours, the driver assured me it won't happen next time, and I confirmed that it wouldn't... because I will never order from them again.\n\nFood:  Ordered nan, rice, lamb jal-frazie, vegetable korma, and chicken tikka masala.  The only good dish was the chicken tikka masala.  The lamb was not tender and actually quite chewy, and difficult to cut into even with a dinner knife.  Nothing special about the vegetable korma, but it wasn't bad.  What surprised us the most particularly was the nan, you would assume that it would be fully cooked...not the case.  The bread was still doughy on the edges.  I had to stick it in the oven for a few minutes to actually enjoy it.\n\nTakeaway?  \n- Eat24 did their best to follow up with the restaurant--I totally acknowledge that it's the restaurant that's to blame. I checked on my order using the chat feature in the app three times, the first time being at 75 minutes... 15min out of the estimated 45-60 minute window.   I tried to cancel my order about 90 minutes into it, but to no avail.  I went all through Eat24, and my only direct interaction with the restaurant was with the driver.  \n- If possible, DON'T add tip (as a prepaid function on Eat24--tipping before service) to your credit card order, because this service was NOT deserving.

Their main business at dinner, and their priority, seems to be take out. \n\nMain courses were OK (tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, hyderabadi lamb and palak-daal) but the naan was not the best which is bit of a deal killer in an Indian place. \n\nThe dining experience overall did not inspire confidence.", "author": "Anu G."}

You might be thinking that this is JUST a rare occurrence but I have given them quite a few chances and tonight is the last unfortunately. I called an hour and fifteen minutes into this current delivery nightmare and was told another fifteen minutes thirty minutes ago. So, if you want to go and dine-in here, this is your place. If you want delivery, I would pass. It's unfortunate because I really want to see them be successful. I'd give them four stars for the food but no stars for delivery.

Literally we four were the only diners for the first hour, and when we left there were maybe two other pairs of two.

They even gave us complimentary chai tea that was sooo delicious at the end of the meal.  So what's the kicker?  \n\nThe bill came, we paid, and were at that point so overfull we could barely roll out of there. Then, a cockroach crawls across the wall right over my friend's head.

It used to be really creamy and had a rich tomato flavor.  About 2 months ago it got really watery and started to have black flecks in it.  Last night it was yellow and thick.  Additionally there used to be cashews and or almonds in the sauce and cooked into the Kofta balls.  Lately they just started to put them in the sauce.  Now there is nothing.\n\nI used to count on this place as a sure thing.  Now even the delivery is spotty and late.  I've had wrong food delivered and had to wait two hours before...

Clearly a bogus review, but I figured maybe the business had made some changes and wanted to bump up their Yelp rating.\n\nFast forward to a couple of nights ago, and as I mentioned I decide to order from them.  I got the following:\n\nChicken Pakoras:  Basic, unseasoned chicken fried in an unflavorful batter.  The tamarind sauce is the only thing that even remotely saved them\n\nLamb Saag:  I love lamb.  I love saag.  I usually get some combination of the two or the two together every time I eat Indian food.  The lamb was OK, but the saag was a disgusting pureed sauce, not even reminiscent of spinach.  It's like they put the entire dish into a blender\n\nKheer:  Respectable\n\nUltimately, I would've liked to enjoy their food much more than I did, but I was completely unimpressed.

We found parking right out front, Indian tonight it is.\n\nWe ordered chicken masala, lamb and chicken korma, saag paneer, tandoori mixed grill, nan, and basmati rice. Seasoning and taste wise everything was delicious Although the chicken korma I felt was over spiced and the saag paneer is suppose to have chucks of cheese, we had only 3. Although the presentation was beautiful especially when they serve the rice in copper pots. Huge portions, we had enough left over for the following day.\n\nThere's a bar off to the side and looking at it I have to assume it's only for wines since I didn't see it stocked with the vodka, gin or other hard liquor.\n\nWalked in and was greeted and seated immediately. Candles were lit for a romantic feel as Indian music played in the background. The walls are a warm curry color with beautiful painted murals in the shape of windows as if you were looking outside. There were few tables for outdoor seating. Service was prompt and friendly. The prices are about $12 each but remember the portions are big.", "author": "Lola L."}

Of course, things will not be systematized and timing will be off.  It takes awhile to get everything working together. \n\nAlso: A lunch buffet would only be perfect on weekends (hey, don't you ever work?) \n\nQuality/Bargain: We had the coconut lamb curry and the tandoori chicken --- both excellent  and just hot enough at medium hot --- with basmati rice, cucumber, raita, nan and mango chutney and we spilt a 22 oz. Taj Majal beer.  The total dinner for two came to $36 and change.  We had to double check it.  Hey, that's what we normally pay, each of us!  I love Roti's Indian cuisine, but the check there is more often nearer $100 than not.  \n\nAtmosphere: Pretty pretty pretty! Elegant and romantic. We came late, so no screaming children  [N.B.to one reviewer:  A good way to avoid them is to dine later, like, you know, European adults.].  Positive sign: one of the other tables had real live Brits eating there, which we took as a good sign, as Indian cuisine is as ubiquitous in London and in England generally as Chinese is here.  \n\nService: Staff was pleasant enough, yet formal [Big plus for not telling me your name and stating the obvious i.e.,  that you'll be our server tonight] and the food didn't take forever.  \n\nAs a hoodie, I was thrilled to find that they also do their own home delivery, not Waiters on Wheels.  \n\nA real find.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-11-10", "description": "When a restaurant is called Clay Oven, my instinct is to try the tandoori, of course. And, our virgin night of take-out at Clay Oven did not disappoint completely as in some reviews below. We got the Tandoori mixed grill (it took 40 minutes to deliver, which is typical on a Friday night even in Noe). \n\nEach piece of shrimp, lamb and chicken was succulent, well-flavoured and I would definitely order this again. It was pricey if you go by the Indian-hole-in-the-wall standard of Pakwan and Shalimar which is supposed to be cheap. My one complaint for take-out was the very mediocre samosas which I consider a staple of Indian fast food/chaat/snacks. The dough was not crisp and came in on the bland side including the filling. \n\nWhich brings me to my observation during sit-down dinner last night: I was excited to see Palak Pakora (spinach fried in chickpea batter), but disappointed at the outcome. I really think that Clay Oven needs a new fryer or hotter fryer or something to that end. Even the Poori (a fried whole wheat bread) resembled a hot yet soggy pita. Not impressive. Cheese Naan was ok, but not enough cheese to hit me with that \"homemade cheese\" goodness.\n\nOur dishes: Shrimp Tikka Masala and traditional Lamb Curry were fair. The tikka sauce wasn't as rich as I usually have had, and the Lamb Curry wasn't spicy enough for my companion. Granted, he likes things spiced up, but when I tasted it it was very one-dimensional. Rice was good and came in the cute copper buckets--a highlight for my aesthetic sense. I ordered a kulfi for dessert, and it was very traditional which means while tasty and authentically tasty, it came sliced in blocks in a small bowl with spoon, a little difficult to eat at first. Once it began to melt, the nutty, creaminess endured and finished the meal well. Dinner for two with beer and wine was still $80 after tip.\n\nI live a block away so of course I'll be back.

Clay Oven in San Mateo was always a favorite in high school but the other San Francisco locations have been a mixed bag (India Clay Oven received high marks for papadum and some of the best chutney around, but disappointed with a chewy, gamey lamb dish; India Garden had great ambiance but lackluster food; Tandori Mahal just never really impressed). Despite the less than stellar track record, we were enticed by the entertainment rewards coupon and the convenient proximity of the Noe Valley location to give the Clay Oven folks another shot. Although not blown away, we were pleasantly surprised with the latest addition to the Clay Oven franchise.\n\nThe samosas were nice and fresh, but the chutney (at least the to-go chutney) was not nearly as good as the stuff that had wowed us at India Garden a while ago. The navrattam korma was fine. Nothing special but reasonably fresh tasting and better than renditions we'd had at India Garden and Tandoori Mahal. The Boti Kabab was the hit of the night though. At $12.95, this dish is a bit pricey for the serving size, but was really excellent. Perfectly cooked, tender, juicy, and exquisitely flavored.\n\nI don't know what accounts for the inconsistency in the Clay Oven franchise, but hopefully the Noe Valley location will keep up the good work. A little pricier than Zante's and overall, pretty similar quality. We'll likely be back for the nice atmosphere and that amazing lamb dish.

The naan was chewy as if it were undercooked.  The lamb rogan josh wasn't very good.  Usually the sauce is savory and creamy, this wasn't like that.  The punjab chicken was as spicy as ordered and the best thing we got.  I also ordered a side of rice pilaf, which I expected to be a basmati rice w/ saffron, cardamom and peas.  What I received was mushy, overcooked white rice w/ peas.  That is crappy.  There will be no additional delivery orders and the quality of food doesn't make me what to go in to the restuarnt either.", "author": "Heather S."}

Another favorite here is the palak dal and garlic naan.  \n\nThe atmosphere and cleanliness of this restaurant is also superior to their competitors.  This is one of the better, not as \"fast foodish\" as many SF Indian restaurants, and therefore, is a little pricier than average, but I also can tell they are using higher quality ingredients.", "author": "Carla K."}

Is Noe Valley THAT much of a yuppie guppie burb that a lunch buffet would be too passe? Well, I happen to like Noe Valley decently enough, and this restaurant does fine without a lunch buffet. \n\nI came here for the lunch specials, and I was only moderately satisfied with my order. Dinner was a different experience, though. I came here straight from home, wearing only sweats and a book as my only company, but I felt at home in the dim, classy surroundings. The staff could stand to be a little more outgoing, though --- sometimes I felt like they were hawks, waiting to unseat me just in case I might fly the coop. No \"how's the mushroom masala tonight\"? No \"ah, I see that you basically just rolled out of a late afternoon nap to have dinner at our fine establishment. Bravo!\"  Maybe I shouldn't have came in my sweats after all. \n\nBut the mushroom masala was good, and even better was the Kashmiri nan. I've never had nan of that kind before, and it was amazing... a bit sweet, though, and might work better as a dessert bread. (Also, the crust was a bit too burned for my liking. Work on that!) \n\nSpeaking of dessert, what did I do to deserve the tasty rice pudding freebie at the end of my meal? I didn't notice any other tables getting any. Were they trying to get rid of curdling leftovers and saw my youthful demeanor as an excuse to unload it on me? Eh, it was a nice surprise. No sense questioning kindness.", "author": "Joseph R."}

They always corrected the problem but never offered a discount or anything for free. We like the food so much that we put up with it.\nTonight we got the wrong food three times. After the third time I called them and after a little bit of a struggle with the owner/boss he promised a 20% discount and new food. However, they sent the driver without a new credit card receipt and even though he assured us it would be taken care of we decided not to chance it. We sent the food back. Called them and demanded a refund. Now we wait to see if the refund goes through. It was such a frustrating experience.

However, I felt compelled to share a recent experience a girlfriend and I had when we ate there a few weeks ago.  We ordered the homemade pickles appetizer (or something to that effect) and a while later (service was not great and we were the only customers there) we were brought some flatbread and a dish of what looked like some kind of chutney.  Forgetting that we had ordered an appetizer, I thought this was just what they brought to every table like bread and butter.  So we tried it and it was probably the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted.  I could barely swallow it.  We were so perplexed by how awful it was that we started laughing hysterically.  I almost complained but decided not to as we didn't want to offend them.  Everything else was delicious, thank god.  I had leftovers to take home and I noticed they had included the vile \"chutney\" with the rest of my food.  I asked my boyfriend, a chef, to taste it just to tell me what he thought and he could not even swallow it.  His guess was too much vinegar was used to pickle whatever it was (vegetables I think) and they did not taste it beforehand.  Poor quality control.  Of course, there is the possibility that that is how it is supposed to taste so if that is the case, I would STRONGLY recommend NOT ordering the pickles appetizer at Clay Oven.  You will thank me.
