Great me, and variety of offerings.\nI normally start off with escargot, served warm with tons of butter and white wine. It's silken,  it's fatty it's amazing.\nWhether you go for steak, or for seafood this place has the quality you can expect from a 5 star restaurant.\nDeserts-- don't skip it!

Ordered the heirloom tomato and melon salad, which was well presented and very fresh and yummy.  We each ordered mussels - mine with the wine and my husband got the chorizo.  There were a ton of mussels so it was plenty of food, but it didn't come with any toasted French bread as I would have loved for dipping into the sauce, and the bread basket bread was not warm or particularly good.

Such was the case tonight.\n\nWalking up to Gamine, I recognized it as the same location that I had the best dinner I've ever eaten, when it was Lipizzaner (long ago). It's a cozy spot, especially on a rainy cool night, has great service and a fun menu for tasting and sharing.\n\nThe 3 of us shared beef tartare, smoked duck salad, lamb sausages and Moules mariniere. The beef tartare appetizer portion was enough for 4 (but more of the crostini would have been nice). The duck fris\u00e9e salad was nice, but if one of my daughters liked beets, I think I would have preferred the beet and green bean salad. The mussels were good too. Didn't love the lamb sausages, but they were ok, I just wouldn't order them again. Plenty of other dishes to try next time.\n\nAdd a bottle of wine and it was a nice girls night out in the city.

From the bistro soundtrack to le handsome garcons posing as waiters to the perfectly cooked oeufs, it's as if you stepped right off of Union and straight into a Parisienne cafe.\n\nI've only been for brunch (they also serve lunch items during brunch) and I've only sat inside (as SF's dreary weather has one do), but both times were tres memorable.\n\nThe service is top notch. These guys may be French, but they are quick witted and ready to joke around if you're in a jokey joke joke mood. They also aim to please. If you have any dietary restrictions or picky eater tendencies, tell them ahead of time so the chef can adjust accordingly.\n\nA complimentary basket of bread and butter is brought to the table after ordering...always a nice way to start any meal. My mimosa was 2/3 champagne and 1/3 OJ, just the way it should be. My mom deemed her simple scrambled eggs dish the best she's ever had, and everyone else was smitten with their omelettes (fluffy and hearty).

They make great French gourmet burgers that are not like anything in Los Angeles. Los Angeles has good burger places too like Umami, The Counter, In N Out, but none of them are like Gamine.\n\nGamine is located on a busy street with a bunch of other restaurants and small, boutique stores. It's a fun date night area if you're into that scene. Gamine only has about 9-10 small tables, so there's usually a wait during peak hours. We arrived at 4:30pm (who eats dinner at 4:30) and there were about 2-3 empty tables. \n\nI usually get the classic burger ($12) with brie ($1.50). The meat patty is juicy and flavorful.

It's a super rare occasion that the hubby (who is an excellent cook and quite picky about food) and I LOVE everything placed in front of us- we did.  I had a small salad with pears beautifully prepared and dressed while he nibbled on some great French bread with butter.  Then out came his perfect French onion soup and it was super tasty.  He ordered steak and frites which also was delicious.  His steak was tender and the onions and sauce really well executed.  Loved the frites with aioli.   I ordered the roasted chicken and damn!!! That was awesome.  I can't remember the last time I ate chicken prepared perfectly and the juice gravy was so good with the sliced crispy but tender Yukon potatoes...  I'm drooling as I write this.  The service was quite attentive and servers helped each other with diners.  Loved having a bottle of water on the table as I hate to chase someone down for a refill.

Small, quaint and romantic with a comfortable ambient noise level. It gets louder throughout the night but for a Thursday night it was chill.  \n\nIt's a French restaurant so it shows that you have at least some class but since it's a bistro the prices aren't breaking your wallet. Waiters with French accents provide welcoming service. \n\nThe dishes are good for sharing. Here's what we had and I recommend the same. \n\nDefinitely order the STEAMED MUSSELS. $16.

Plus, this is my 100th Yelp review in the Yelp 100 Challenge. Only fitting. = ) \n\nDuring my last visit home, my sisters and I were out running errands when our belly's started to tell us it was time to stop for lunch. I've been craving a REAL burger after our disappointing experience at the Gordon Ramsay BurGR joint (http://www.yelp.com/biz/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#hrid:8hu0T6Fy6UXkQRU87KVAoQ). I was stoked to see Gamine received great burger reviews and was excited to give it a try.\n\nThe restaurant is very small and even though we arrived at 2pm, there was concern we would not be seated right away. We did find 3 seats at the bar overlooking the kitchen. Usually not be my first choice of seating but I was hungry and was really looking forward to the burger. Our waiter Alex probably could've sold us anything. Very approachable and had a great personality - perfect for the restaurant industry. \n\nThe minute he found out we were all craving a burger, he let it be known -- the best and only one was the Basic Burger with brie, bacon and an egg. My sisters went against the grain and ordered cheddar instead of the brie (SMH).  \n\nIt was really neat to actually sit at the bar and watch everything happening behind the scenes. Each were working feverishly around the kitchen and pulling out these amazing plates of food. I had to actually look down at the menu a couple of times to see what they were charging for some of these dishes because they were very pleasing to the eye. \n\nWhen we got our dishes, they did not disappoint. The burger was rather huge and had a very generous helping of shoe string fries. The fries were served with an aioli sauce that was to die for. If I didn't know the typical ingredients in an aioli sauce, I probably would've licked the entire bowl clean. I don't think my body needs an extra cup or two of mayo though...\n\nThe burger....let's just say it was A-MAZING! Hands down, the best burger I've had in a very long time.  I requested my burger to be medium and it was delivered as promised. The brie, arugula, bacon and the EGG....oh! it was magnifique!  I don't usually care for the artisian breads as my burger buns but this proved to be the perfect choice. It really allowed for the burger to stay together with each bite - never did it fall a part on me. It also soaked up the egg yolk and just kept all the flavors in. \n\nI jokingly asked Alex to save me a seat at the bar every day. Seriously, if I lived in the city - I would be here quite often. The burgers were that good and our waiter Alex was just that awesome. My burger was about $18 but let me tell you...it was worth it. If Gordon Ramsey can get away with charging the same price for a crappy burger, these guys can charge $25 and I wouldn't blink an eye.  \n\nI look forward to returning again soon. Keep up the great work!", "author": "Sharon V."}

M liked this one more than I did. \n\nFlat Iron Steak with Fries: Yum! We ordered the steak medium rare, and even though it came out closer to medium, it was still sooooo tender and juicy. I was jealous of M's dish. I would highly recommend this one.\n\nGrilled Merguez Panini: This was one of the best paninis I've had. I really loved the bread and how crispy it was on the outside and how gooey and soft it was on the inside with the gruyere cheese. I used to hate eating hot sandwiches with onions, and this has totally changed me! I will say that I wish there was more sausage, but just the bread and cheese and onions alone were great. \n\nMousse au Chocolat: A very generous portion to end a great meal. It was light, and not too rich, but still had so much chocolate flavor. Definitely share this one!\n\nI would not recommend this for a date as it was very very loud inside.

We went all out -- Onion Soup Gratinee and Baked Cambozola for appetizers, and Grilled Flat Iron Steak and Moules Louisette for our entrees.\n\nONION SOUP:\nProbably the best onion soup I have ever had. It's rich with flavor and comes topped with a melty cheesy mess that you can just dig into with your spoon. Too much soup for you? Dip a bit of the complimentary bread in, and you have yourself a whole new way of enjoying this appetizer.\n\nBAKED CAMBOZOLA:\nAt the recommendation of our waiter, we ordered the Baked Cambozola as well. He said it was similar to bleu cheese, which we were a bit wary of because we're both not the biggest fans of bleu cheese. But out came something that we didn't expect -- a small bubbling pot of melted cambozola with four toast points and a head of roasted garlic. Our waiter was even kind enough to squeeze the roasted garlic out for us to enjoy so that we wouldn't get our hands messy. This dish was absolutely divine. Rich and creamy but not overpowering at all. Take a toast point, pile on the cambozola and a bit of the roasted garlic, and you will be sooo happy.\n\nGRILLED FLAT IRON STEAK:\nA steak that literally melts in your mouth. We like our steak medium rare, and this steak came out just perfect. Tender, juicy, flavorful... I'm drooling a bit just thinking about it. The steak also comes with a massive side of fries.\n\nMOULES LOUISETTE:\nAfter eating mussels at Gamine, it made me wonder about how mussels reproduce, and whether or not they reproduce at a massive rate because Gamine serves these guys by the potful. And I mean pot. FULL. When I ordered the mussels, I didn't expect an entire pot of simmering steamed mussels to be presented to me. I wish I had taken a before and after picture so that you could see the graveyard of shells that once housed some juicy seafood. The Louisette broth was delicious, but I feel that one of the other mussel choices would have packed even more flavor. Next time, Gamine. Next time.\n\nIf we weren't so stuffed from these dishes, I'm pretty sure that we would have ordered their dessert, too.

And I dislike the attitude of the waiters. \n\nWith Umami and Roam within 2 blocks of Gamine, I would never come here for burgers. The burgers are trying too hard to be considered gourmet-Parisian and instead, end up falling flat on both the flavor and texture. \n\nThe fries are not crisp and lack any semblance of seasoning. \n\nThe waiters are pretentious with their noses way way up in the air. Just as a simple example, our company's CFO asked for a side of some ketchup when the waiter delivered him his burger. The waiter then snootily responded that it's tacky to eat burgers with ketchup when they are so French and oh so gourmet. He literally did not bring the ketchup!

Here's the link to my Chez Maman review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/chez-maman-san-francisco#hrid:9yXW3HWWyFTcCCArt-6MmQ However, there was a change of ownership in 2008. Although Gamine and Chez Maman still share similar menu with almost as equally delicious food, Gamine loses stars for their lackluster and cold service. \n\nOn Thursday, 7.7.11, my friends and I (party of 7) came to Gamine for dinner at 6 PM. I was fortunate to have made reservations (minimum party of 6 needed) the day prior. We had a last minute change in party size and they were nice enough to accommodate my request. \n\nF O OD\n*ONION SOUP GRATINEE ($7.50) - 4 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RM1ioN-76NzXDbfv63GhTQ?select=TbPvgxwYBrRu13JP-W_-Vw\nThe onion soup was deliciously hearty with rich, complex stewed onion flavor with just the right amount of sweetness. It was generously crowed with bubbling, oooey gooey swiss cheese which stretched and pulled as I took a spoonful of soup.\n\n*BAKED CAMBOZOLA w/ Roasted Garlic & Toast Points ($9.50) - 5 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RM1ioN-76NzXDbfv63GhTQ?select=XVPPnt7sll66Kh01lUnDMw\nThe crunchy toast points were the perfect canvas for the buttery sweet roasted garlic and decadently rich, melted cambozola which was ultra-creamy with a mild pungency. Each bite was sinfully good and let me wanting more!\n\nBEEF TARTARE (Entr\u00e9e Size - $17) - 3 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RM1ioN-76NzXDbfv63GhTQ?select=bh-D8gSVKLRpyQNwpdVYQg\nThough the tartare was soft and tender, it was lacking in flavor (i.e. tang). I think more Worcestershire sauce would have been benefited the tartare. \n\nBASIC BURGER w/ Brie, Bacon & an Egg ($12 + $1.50/topping) - 4 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RM1ioN-76NzXDbfv63GhTQ?select=kLmy1UufvB5sA9tG1puA9g\nThough a complete heart attack on the platter, I wanted to get the whole \"French\" burger experience so I decided to make my Basic Burger \"French Style\" by adding Brie, Bacon and an Egg. \n\nThe French roll was perfectly toasted creating a sog barrier which held the beef patty and all the accoutrements together well. Cooked medium rare as requested, the patty was tender, moist, and juicy. The heat from the patty gently melted the creamy and milky brie. The bacon was crisp with a nice porky smokiness. The egg, however, was overcooked and the yolk didn't ooze out as I expected. Completing the heart attack on the platter was the gentle smearing of garlic aioli which added a layer of creamy garlicky richness.\n\nI opted for the salad instead of the fries, though I regret not getting the fries now. The salad was just a mixture of baby lettuces tossed in balsamic vinaigrette which was nothing special. \n\nS E R V I C E\nBeing formerly linked to Chez Maman and after having a pleasant experience over the phone while making/changing my reservations, I expected the service to be similarly as good. However, our waiter had no personality and was cold in his interactions with us. This was a far cry from the charming experience we had while at Chez Maman.\n\nOur appetizers came out within 10 minutes of ordering, but there was a lag when it came to our entrees. It took over 45 minutes to get our entrees after finishing our appetizers. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nRustic and very intimate, Gamine is great for a small casual dinner (party of 2-4). The main dining room is small and can accommodate about 20 people. We were offered the private dining room upstairs for our group which I gladly accepted thinking we would have more room. But after being sat in the private room, I wish we would have sat at the main dining room instead.\n\nThe private dining room was small, stuffy, and claustrophobic. The ceiling was low but was made even lower from the burgundy curtain draping. There were fridges in back of one of the curtains which blew out hot air causing the room to be very humid and stuffy. We had to open one of the back doors and keep it ajar just to let in some ventilation. \n\nP A R K I N G\nStreet parking which was easily found before 6 PM, however, I know parking in the area can be difficult on the weekends.\n \nI initially was going to give Gamine 4 Stars but after pondering over it for several days, why reward a restaurant with 4 Stars with service that falls flat.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Both were mouthwateringly delicious.\nFor dessert, I had the creme brulee and hubby had crepe with creme fraiche and berries. The crepe was perfect. The creme brulee was delicious; however, I was surprised that it was served in a wide, shallow dish instead of the deeper soufflee cup that I am used to.... perhaps that is more traditional? I think I like it in the shallow dish because I got more brulee!\n\nAfter our meal, our waiter surprised us with two glasses of white dessert port on the house! \n\nThe whole bill, including a generous tip, came to $125 which I think is very reasonable for a nice dinner out.\n\nAs we left, the waiter came over and shook our hands, kissed me on the cheeks in the traditional French manner, and thanked us for coming in.\n\nI was so impressed with the whole experience!

We shared the Norwegian omelette and the French toast.  OK.  The omelette.  Stupid good.  Smoked salmon, goat cheese, dill, creme fraiche...seriously the tastiest omelette I have ever had in my life.  Unquestionably.  Rich, decadent, with such fantastic and surprisingly complex flavor.  The French toast was less nuanced but was one of the single best French toasts I have had in this city, maybe ever.  The mix of the two dishes was a nice mix of sweet and savory and we practically licked both plates clean.\n\nI had the brut champagne and my wife had the Lillet Blanc, which we both enjoyed.\n\nBread and butter are excellent as always (seriously, this place's butter is on another level), as is the casual yet romantic atmosphere.  \n\nNo wait at all at approximately 12:30 on a Saturday.

While the Basic Burger w/bacon and the Basic Burger w/egg were flavorful, the Veggie Burger and Basic Burger w/cheddar cheese were just okay. Seemed to be a bit of a hit-or-miss situation. Also, the aioli that came with the fries was too bland for my taste.\n\n     tl;dr - Meh food, good service. Would recommend for a casual weekday dinner but not for a special occasion.", "author": "Chelsea M."}

After being seated, we took a couple mins to look over the menu. Then we sat around for 5 minutes waiting for service while the only waiter present waltzed around serving three other tables without so much as glancing at us. So while he was rushing into the back area, we politely asked for service.  He answered excuse me, so I told him we were ready to order and that we had been waiting. His response?  \"For how long, an hour? You can leave if you want\". \n\nI don't know what his problem is, and this guy should not be a server here or anywhere. For a reputable restaurant such as this, I would think that the servers would know what they're doing. So if you must dine here, avoid the bleach blonde, fake tan middle aged male server with a French accent by all means because he's RACIST.

It came with crispy french fries which I have been dreaming about ever since.\n\nTo finish things off, we ordered the banana nutella crepe which was the only disappointing part of the meal.

The servers are extremely nice and they seat you as if they were playing tetris (fitting parties into efficient areas rather than per request). The restaurant also has outdoor patio seating which overlooks Union St. (Good thing Union St. isn't SUPER busy).\n\nFrench Onion Soup = bomb.com. It's a bit pricey at $7.5 but definitely delicious. They bake a layer of puff pastry over the soup so that you can drench the carbs with onion deliciousness. The cheese in the soup was a bit overwhelming and became annoyingly chewy over time. Overall the soup was good but not worth the price.\n\nI had been wanting the Grilled Pork Chop [apple-cider mustard sauce & steamed brussel sprouts] ($17.5) ever since I saw the picture on Yelp. Little did I know, they serve it medium rare! It's seared like Ahi Tuna and cooked to perfection. The sauce was delightful and flavored the meat well. I just thought it was a bit heavy and I definitely needed something else on my palette to even the taste buds out.\n\nMy date got the Steamed Mussels- Moules Catalane [ white wine, Merguez sausage, tomato, barissa] ($16) and it was DELICIOUS! The sauce was so good that I seriously drank it as soup. They overflow the pot with about 30 mussels (which is a super good deal) drenched in their delicious sauce. Definitely some of the best mussels that I've ever had.\n\nThis is more of a one-time try place and I wouldn't go back again.

We were seated without much of a wait, and ended up splitting a penne with salmon cream sauce, and a basic burger with brie.\n\nIf this is actually run by the same folks, I couldn't really tell, as the food here was not as mind-blowing as at Chez Maman proper. The penne was okay overall, but definitely on the bland side, even with all the heavy cream. Even the burger, which you'd expect to be the same, felt a little lackluster in comparison (flavors were more muted, and the bread was even more distracting here).\n\nService also came off as just a little unfriendly, and while it may have just been me, it was definitely less friendly than at Chez Maman.

I've known Stefan for years now, as my wife and I visit Gamine every chance we get. Never have I seen a restaurant owner so invested in making his guests feel comfortable. Never. Not once. In my entire life. When you see Stefan interacting with his customers, it's as if he's known them for years. And to be fair, he probably has because they're most likely regular guests who are just as enamored with Gamine as I am. But even if you stroll in for the first time, Stefan will make you feel like family. He is everything a restaurant owner should be.\n\nAs far as the food goes, it's also great. The onion soup gratin\u00e9e (French onion) is the best I've ever had and the warm goat cheese and arugula salad with honey vinaigrette is ridiculously flavorful (and it pairs perfectly with the Sancerre). My wife raves about the Moules Catalane (steamed mussels with merguez sausage), but my usual choice is the burger topped with gruy\u00e8re. And it's a damn good one. If you go for dessert, try the mousse au chocolat with some port. You won't regret it; well, at least until you realize that you're so full that the prospect of strolling home sounds hideous. Summon an Uber X and call it a meal.\n\nThe cozy, neighborhood feel of Gamine really makes this restaurant special. The servers are all fantastic and even though I've never been to Paris, Gamine makes me feel like I'm there. It really comes across as authentically French. \n\nI would absolutely recommend Gamine.

But I was browsing and saw that there were more than a few others that seemed to have similar experiences as I, so I thought I really wanted to write about it too.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were looking for a French Bistro and found Gamine and with all the great reviews... it was a given. When we stepped in, it was kind of busy - it looked like maybe there were a few parties waiting... so we figured why not. The French woman that came over at first was super nice. She said that someone will be right with us, so we waited. Finally the guy came over - sounds like he's the manager? Told us it was going to be about a 45 minute to an hour wait, which we were a little surprised by, but we said okay. He told us if we wanted to have a glass of wine while we wait just let him know.He sounded nice enough. \n\nPeople started coming in, and were getting seated in front of us... we figured maybe they had stopped by earlier to put their name down and came back, so fine. It was clear also that friends of the owner were also getting seated... which I also excused. \n\nThe manager was chatting with people all around - the tables, other people waiting. My boyfriend and I can be a little anti-social, especially when we get a bad vibe from people. He came over a couple times to ask if we wanted any wine before dinner... we told him no thanks, but didn't exchange anymore small talk.\n\nI observed him, and he seemed like the type of person that just always needed to be in the center of attention. He just had to be talking to people, making jokes, and having people laugh at his jokes and what not... - this was more important than actually doing his job. He would insist this on almost everyone there... and most of the times his jokes were terrible - but it was like he couldn't help himself. We were definitely getting a bad vibe from him the entire time we were there.\n\nFinally, after waiting an hour, we noticed a party of two who clearly walked in after us got seated before us... and that was it. We walked OUT.\n\nWe should had left earlier... but my bf and  just started going out at the time and neither of us wanted to seem like we were being weird about it when both of us really wanted to leave earlier :P  \n\nSomeone else mentioned this - but what is it.. like.. how does he choose who to seat, and who not to seat? It's like you walk in there and there are certain people he just doesn't like and so he does whatever he wants. Was it ethnicity? The fact that we were anti-social and didn't want to make small talk with him? Because we didn't laugh at his jokes? Because we didn't get wine while we waited? Does that make us not fun loving enough?\n\nIt just seemed like this guy has major control issues. He wants to be the center of the universe and his restaurant at Gamine allows him to do that. HE gets to say who gets a table and who doesn't. HE is the center of attention with everyone thinking he is the charming host... but only to the people he likes.\n\nIf you get seated promptly, I guess you got into the popular club at Gamine. If not, I guess you can join us nerds at Chez Papa Bistrot or Chez Maman (hopefully it's not true that they are owned by the same owners, because I actually like Chez Maman)", "author": "Bonnie H."}

We had a party of 7 and had an option of dining in the main dining room or a private dining area (upstairs), of course we chose the private dining area! Oh I forgot to add, there is a time limit of two hours for the private dining area. After your two hours is up they kick your ass to the curb. JK, I really don't know what happens if your dinner just so happens to go over the two hour limit. \n\nThe private dining room was very small, dimly lit and gave off a gothic vibe. =X The curtains draped over our heads and against the walls were dark red and reminded me of the inside lining of a vampire's bed (coffin). This area could have previously been used as a storage room and part of this room is used as a storage area, so you will have staff walking in and out through the curtains. \n\nAPPETIZERS\nBEEF TARTARE- hand cut high quality raw beef also served with bread. The beef tartare was good but I thought it was just okay and was slightly bland. \n\nONION SOUP GRATINEE- OMG the onion soup was really, REALLY good. It was cheesy and flavorful, what more can you ask for?\n\nENTREE\nGRILLED FLAT IRON STEAK- I want to thank the chef for cooking my steak medium-rare because most restaurants over cook the damn thing. The meat was very juicy and flavorful but I did not care too much for whatever was sitting on top of my steak and unfortunately I could not figure out what it was (was NOT caramelized onions). Accommodating my steak was a load of crispy fries, if you read some of my reviews before you'll know that I LOVE FRIES so that was a big plus for me. \n\nAside from the food, the service was not too great. It was VERY SLOW, the appetizers came out fairly quickly BUT when it came to the entrees it took at least 45 minutes or an hour to come out. In addition to the slow service I want to state how much I HATE when people reach across me to grab things, usually the waiter or whoever it may be would say, \"excuse my reach or excuse me.\" Not to come off as being a snob or anything but I do believe that you should excuse yourself! =X \n\nThough the food was good, the service kind of killed it for me and stopped me from giving this place 4 stars. That being said, 3.5 STARS!", "author": "Heather C."}

The butter garlic sauce is amazing. Their calamari was pretty good, nothing uniquely spectacular.\n\nOur party mainly ordered burgers and mussels, both of which is a must try. At first glance, you might wonder what's so great about hamburgers? But it's the toppings they offer that makes them so tasty. I ordered a fish burger, which turned out to be salmon. I gotta say, it's one of the top two best salmon burgers I have ever had and I order salmon burgers from every joint I go to that have them.

Made a reservation literally 3 hours before we wound up going there, and they were able to accommodate us just fine. Made the reservation for 8:30 but didn't get seated until 8:45 - not really restaurant's fault - we needed to combine 2 tables, and one of the tables was occupied by a couple that simply insisted on sitting and talking when there were tons of people waiting outside. But, the waiter did check in with us often, and did assure us we would be seated soon. \n\nFood was great! The burgers were excellent - they were very well seasoned, but also not that greasy, and very light. I didn't feel like my arteries were clogging as I was eating them. Fries are shoe-string style and very crispy/not oily but delicious! Would definitely recommend this case for those who are looking for something a little fancier than Umami Burger and Super Duper, but nothing TOO fancy, to celebrate an occasion or just go out with friends in the evening!

Out it came and he also suggested a sweet dessert wine to accompany the foie gras. I found it to be on the bitter side, almost reminds me of eating chicken liver.. not the usual buttery, melt-in-your-mouth duck liver. It was almost like a pate. (All I heard was foie gras.. Next time I should listen more carefully!)\n\nMoules Catalane (mussells with white wince, merguez sausage, tomato, Harissa) was good. The sauce was amazingly good that we were dipping the bread into the sauce, but the mussells didn't seem as fresh as it could be. There were several closed mussells and after hitting a couple bad ones, we just stopped eating it.\n\nThe grilled flat iron steak was great with bordelaise sauce. Loved the french fries.

It happened after watching a recent episode of Iron Chef America. It was Battle Mussels, and man, the dishes they were whipping up with those succulent mussels got the gears in my head turning violently trying to find a place that offered those delicious bivalves. \n\nFortunately we were going to be in SF on Sunday and Gamine was only blocks away from where we were at. It is an intimate, cozy neighborhood French bistro with a small number of tables. We were seated promptly at a two-top and immediately knew what we were going to order. I had the Moules Catalane, containing white wine, Merguez sausage, tomatoes, and harissa ($16). She had the Moules Mariniere containing white wine, parsley, and lots of garlic ($15). We also added the french fries with aioli ($5) to complete our Parisian-esque adventure. \n\nOur overflowing small cauldrons of hot, steaming mussels were presented before us. The Moules Catalane had a jolt of spiciness from the harissa and Merguez. The mussels themselves were juicy and absorbed all of the bold flavors of the broth. I got to try a few of the Moules Mariniere and the garlic is definitely intense, but it adds to the experience of having such a classic dish. \n\nAfter consuming all of the mussels, what's left is a spicy soup in which to get some crusty baguette slices and sop it all up. Even take a spoon and slurp up all of that concentrated ambrosia. Some might say that's the best part. I would have to concur. \n\nGamine was a great discovery with affordable prices on all of their selections. Will I go back to Gamine. That would be a resounding OUI!", "author": "Randy T."}

The smokiness of duck breast pairs with the poached egg, also there were a few bacon and croutons, although the croutons were very much soaked in the red wine vinaigrette, it was a bit sour for me.\n*I would also love to try the escargot and spicy lamb sausage next time! \n- Grilled pork chop with apple cider mustard sauce on a bed of brussel sprouts - very juicy! I don't usually order pork chop but this time I definitely love what i ordered.

We would have preferred a table but we were very hungry.\n\nFood: \n\n1. Basic Burger with gruyere cheese and fries - I never had a french burger before and this was a great introduction. The bread was perfectly toasted and the meat was a perfect medium rare. The patty also had some herbs mixed into it which made the meat extra savory. The Gruyere cheese was also an excellent choice.\n\n2. Lamb Stew Provencale - we were craving soup but we saw this and we decided stew would do. It looked fantastic and tasted good. The lamb was nice and tender but the soup had too strong of a wine taste and was a little too sweet for our tastes. Maybe ask them to go easy on the wine sauce. I also liked how soft the small potatoes were, onions were a little too sweet. \n\nThese two dishes were enough for us and we were very hungry after a day of hiking in Sausalito.\n\nDessert: Although we didn't eat dessert I'd recommend the Crepe Suzette. I believe this is the one that comes out on fire. We saw from the bar, they light some alcohol on fire and then pour it on the crepe and bring it to you, nice presentation!\n\nAmbiance: Has a nice homey, romantic feel. Nice lighting, very clean and upscale. We should have dressed up more but we found this place last minute while driving into SF. The owner/manager speaks french which also adds to the ambiance. \n\nWhat I'd do different next time: Probably won't order the Lamb Stew, sweet stews aren't my thing or my girlfriends.

I was in town to try Swan's Oyster Depot, recommended by Mr. No Reservation, but the line was effn long, so a friend recommended that I try Gamine because her past experience was flawless. So we decided to walk ... for a good half hour. When we arrived at the place, I noticed the place was quite small. Can't imagine how long one would have to wait on a busy evening. We were seated immediately because it was way past lunch hours. The owner was very generous and he spoke French to other French speaking customers. That's a plus in my book when one can actually create a conversation to the type of restaurant they operate. Psychologically, I can imagine the food closer to home.\n\nI ordered Grilled Pork Chop and it was ZEE BEST Pork Chop I have ever tried. Everything, from buttery sauce to the way the meat was prepared, was spectacular. It was so good that I asked for extra bread just so I can dip in the sauce and savor all the rich buttery taste in my mouth. It was so good that I wanted finish the meat that was stuck by the bone which was somewhat impossible with a fork and knife. Boohoo. \n\nIn the end, I am SO GLAD that I did not wait 2+ hours to be seated at Swan's Oyster Depot. If  Anthony Bourdain is reading this, YOU MISSED A VERY GOOD SPOT BUDDY. And please don't publicize it in your TV show, I would hate to wait 2+ hours next time I visit after thousands of viewers put it on their must-go list.", "author": "Paul L."}

The bad thing is that they don't have a waiting list where you could write it... instead you tell the owner and he \"remembers\" your place in line. Well, because of that, I took a star off. My party was there before the group behind us... and he even told us how long we would wait and everything. However, he seated the people that came after us... why? I'm not sure... it's either because they actually ordered drinks while they were waiting and we didn't or... he just forgot. Either way, you're going insist on remembering people... DO IT RIGHT. Worse part was when he finally seated us he said \"Sorry about the wait.\" So I'm not sure if he realized how he made me wait an extra hour or if he was just that oblivious... either way.... get a list where people could put their names down!\n\nSo after being seated an hour later.... shared the fried calamari and it was pretty good. I ordered the basic burger with the brie. The burger was pretty good and the french roll that it came with was thick at first but it made sense near the end of the meal since my burger slowly started to fall apart. The burger was pretty good though and flavorful. The fries were pretty well seasoned.... but I still wish I had ketchup. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to ask for it or if they even had it... since I didn't see any other table with ketchup while they were eating their fries. lol. My other friend got the pork chop and I tried a bit... it was decent... wasn't that great but it wasn't dry... so that's a good thing. \n\nThe meal was okay... it was kind of ruined by the waiting.

The brie + fried egg combo was recommended by our server but I'd disagree and pick another cheese. The brie was good but just didn't match well. Don't worry, Gamine has several more good cheeses for your burger. The roll is square and fairly large. The fries are herbed and just the right thickness and crispiness to be flavorful on their own or to soak up mussels' stock or egg yolk/burger au jus. \n\nSpeaking of which, the mussels are very good and perhaps our favorite dish.

It really is a perfect little restaurant, so out of lack of very many other words, allow yourselves to forgive my constant repetition of the word perfect in this review. The restaurant and the food are rustic and simple, but that does not take away from the boldness and perfect blending of flavors. I've never been to France, but the ambiance of Gamine is right out of a Food Network Show that's portraying the South of France. \n\nAll credit for us choosing this restaurant has to go to Yelp and it's reviewers. It was a cold, rainy day and we came running into Gamine, for a rather late for lunch around 1:30, and every table except 2 were occupied. We were seated almost immediately, there was 1 waiter for the whole restaurant. Granted the restaurant wasn't big at all, there must have been about about 8 or 10 tables altogether. \n\nI ordered a glass of wine, which my husband and I shared because we still had a whole day of sight-seeing left to do. For appetizers we ordered the Beef Tartar, which was excellent. It came with a little raw quail's egg on top, which I did not really fancy as I don't like runny yokes. But the beef itself, was perfectly seasoned and some of the best I've ever eaten. \n\nFor lunch I ordered the Roasted Chicken and my husband ordered the Grilled Pork Chop. Both dishes were divine! I mean absolutely outstanding. What a great way to kick off a vacation. Even the breast of the chicken was soft and juicy, and the whole dish was full of flavor. It didn't taste like a boiled chicken with sauce poured on top. The lemon did not overpower the chicken or the thyme in the jus at all, and the potatoes were perfectly roasted too, soft inside and crispy outside with just the right amount of salt. \n\nMy husband's pork chops were just as good. The meat was moist, flavorful and tender (something a lot of restaurants can't do right). The apple cider mustard sauce was impeccably balanced. The mustard wasn't overwhelming, the cider gave the whole dish a little zing and I have yet to ever eat a Brussels Sprout that I didn't like, so I don't really have much to say about them. \n\nThe portions were were pretty substantial, and we were both too stuffed to order dessert, unfortunately. The only thing that struck me as overreaching at Gamine was our waiter, I'm not sure if he really did have a French accent or if it was a put on, but it seemed he was trying really hard with it, and kept bowing to us whenever he said 'merci'. Again, I don't know if that is actually the culture in France or not, (please forgive me if and ignore all this if it is) but in what was such a perfect and simple setting, with the simplicity of flavor in each dish, the waiter seemed a little out of place.", "author": "Natasha P."}

I then ordered the croque monsieur and was surprised when the gruy\u00e8re was not burnt and hardened!

It was a bit small so I wouldn't go if you had a large party (though I did see a larger closed off dining area in the back that looked like it catered to bigger parties) but the decor was wonderful and had hints of a moroccan style in the dining area as well as in the bathroom.

No on wants to sit where people are going to be staring at you and their food. \n\nWhen he offered us the crappy table I said, \"May we please just sit at the bar instead?\" I didn't think this would be an issue since 4 out of 5 place settings were open. His response, \"I'm sorry, but two of those seats are reserved.\" (Please keep in mind that the other seats were set up as so: open bar stool - man sitting by himself - open bar stool - then the two reserved seats). I was so surprised by this because according to the restaurant, they didn't take reservations for a party of two. \n\nLong story short...I didn't even end up going to eat there. I do not want to give my money to a business that clearly doesn't value their customers equally. Enough said.", "author": "Holly F."}

My boyfriend and I arrived at approximately 7:00 o'clock and the wait was only about a half an hour.  Just enough time for my boyfriend to go to the corner store and drink a tecate tall boy (we're classy, I swear).  \n\nAnyways, on to Gamine.  I remember thinking the service was a bit slow initially, but we were sat in a wave with three other tables, so I can understand the slowness.  After that, however, the rest of the meal was spectacular.  \n\nFor appetizers, we had the beer tartar, the french onion soup, and the frisee salad.  After all the yelp reviews wrote about how awesome the soup is, I was a little underwhelmed with it.  It was good, but nothing extraordinary.  The duck frisee salad and the steak tartar, however, were unbelievably tasty.  \n\nFor entrees, we had the ravioli and the mussels with sausage and tomatoes.  The ravioli was pretty amazing. We don't eat much pasta (and I think that was my first time seeing my boyfriend order it out and about) and it was really delicious.  Super rich, but not overpowering.  My mussels were pretty awesome, although I wish the tomatoes were a bit more incorporated into the broth.  However, the portion size was HUGE.  I think we only ate half.  \n\nIf I could do it over (and I will), I'd ditch the soup and try a different set of mussels. :)", "author": "Shannon B."}

Seeing as how the only places i've had this was at places like Applebees, i figured this was a must. It was absolutely fantastic. Everything  tasted fresh and home cooked.\n\nAs someone who has never had steamed mussels, i wanted to be a little adventurous and ordered them. The server recommended i get some fries with it just in case i didn't like it. He also instructed me on how to eat them since i'd never had them before. They were great! the mussels were enough to feed a truck driver and came in an old school metal pot which i thought was perfect for the setting.\n\nThe service was top notch. Going in, i figured the stigma might stick being an American going into a French restaurant. I've been to 2 other French restaurants and was talked to like a child which was completely insulting. This guy, (blonde guy) was awesome. He made great recommendations, was always there to help us out, (my buddy dropped his fork not once, but twice), and saw that I was going for the french experience and told me that where he's from, they dump the french fries in the broth after and i should try them out. \n\nMe being the fatty I am, ended with a cup of coffee and some creme' brule'. Again, i've always had terrible brule' and this one even physically looked different then what iv'e had. It came in a medium sized dish big enough for a couple on a date. The top was a crystallized caramel that had been seared. It was nice and crunchy with a hint of that smokey campfire taste (I.e. Smores), with a nice creamy, milky pudding like substance underneath. \n\nAll in all, i made a reach going here and was blown away. Service, ambiance, and food was all 5 stars.

They only make reservations for parties of 6 or more so if you have less (we had party of 4), expect a wait (20-30 min for us).  \n\nThe service was really excellent.  The waiter let us know which table we were going to have and thanked us repeatedly for waiting.  Once we were seated, he recommended a few things and a second waitress came by frequently to take our order.  5+ stars for service.  \n\nI ordered the Grilled Flat Iron Steak with 2 dipping sauces and french fries while my bf got the Marinated Grilled Lamb Loin with potato gratin.  I usually order steak medium rare when really I want it medium cause they usually over cook it a little... but this steak came out MEDIUM RARE.  I was a little hesitant at first cause it was really red/pink but it was very juicy and CHEWY.  Perfectly cooked.  Considering I don't like lamb, it's a big statement to say theirs was pretty yummy.  Couldn't taste the game-yness too much (it was still there, tho) and it was also melty-chewy.  We also got escargot in butter sauce, which was perf to dip bread in along with fried calamari and aioli sauce.  \n\nThe food was really really good and service was dynamite.  The only complaint would be the long wait and small portions.  Then again, that's probably why the word \"petite\" is French... cause they know portion control.  \n\nI'd like to come back and try the burger.

It's perfect for a date or a great dinner with friends, especially in the secret back room where it's quiet, dark and candlelit around a square table. \n\nThe waitstaff might take some getting used to as they are pretty French.

I noticed that this place was also categorized under Burgers and I was a little confused since it was considered a French restaurant.\n\nI saw some people say it was good, so I had my mind set on getting a burger without stepping into the place yet.\n\nHad a taste of a few appetizers like the calamari, escargot and the baked cambozola.\n\nCalamari was okay, escargot was great and the cambozola was very unique and tasty.  It is like melted cheese and super soft roasted garlic that comes out almost like  a spread.\n\nI got the basic burger with brie and bacon, cooked medium.  I have to say that it was a pretty tasty burger.  Thanks yelpers!\n\nIt isn't your standard burger because it comes on a french roll and they must add some other stuff in the meat besides salt and pepper.\n\nOthers in the party had the pork chop, mussels, lamb, etc.  I had a taste of the others, but still liked my burger best.  \n\nService was attentive and very nice.

This is by far one of the most pleasant dining experiences I've had in the Marina, if not the city. If you're at all normal, you don't usually dig the obnoxious Marina crowd, but this restaurant makes me feel like I'm in a bistro in Paris, without the snooty French. ;) \n\nI had the french onion soup, garden salad (with pear), the chicken, and banana / nutella crepe. The soup and chicken were great, and the garden salad was pretty typical and nothing out of the ordinary. The banana / nutella crepe was good as well, but I think I've probably had better. Even though the food didn't blow me away, that doesn't stop me from writing a 5 star review..... the best part of this restaurant was how pleasant the workers were. The owners were smiling, chatting, and joking around with us and several other guests. This seems to clearly be a family owned place and they made us feel like part of the family.\n\nI'll definitely be returning to try some other dishes on the menu. :)", "author": "Kristina C."}

I recommend the beef burger with brie ($14) that comes with crispy shoestring fries. Also the mussels mariniere ($15  in white wine, garlic, parsley broth make for a great appetizer and a melt in your mouth dip. Last but not least, this is a busy restaurant, so I recommend that you call ahead. Don't worry I went last night (Saturday) and grabbed a table for four in 20 minutes. If you can reserve the back room for a quieter more intimate meal for up to 8.\n\nBottom line:\nWith awesome service, friendly faces, and the atmosphere of a real neighborhood dining spot, you really can't go wrong. Above all else though, the attention to quality ingredients and freshness was really what made each dish tasty enough to question why doesn't everyone serve food with this same philosophy.", "author": "Gregory I."}

EVER. \n\nA friend was visiting from out of town and suggested we have dinner at this place because it got good reviews on Yelp. That turned out to be a mistake.\n\nThe dining room is very small, and we were seated an arm's length away from the loudest, rudest party I have ever come across (and I've worked as a server for years, so I thought I had seen it all). They had already gone through at least one bottle of wine and were having a loud, profane conversation that was incredibly distracting. \n\nHow did the staff address this? By offering the rude table more alcohol! The other diners in the restaurant sat in uncomfortable silence for a while before someone finally made a complaint. When the party was asked to lower their voices, they began loudly insulting other diners, and proclaimed that they would never apologize for their behavior in a restaurant and that they spent a lot of money there and would therefore act as they pleased. They were absolutely obnoxious and the staff did nothing but indulge them, even as other diners were walking out. \n\nRomantic my foot! This is no place to go for a relaxing meal. The staff obviously do not care about atmosphere or service at all, only their bottom line. \n\nThe food wasn't even nearly as good as I expected it to be based on reviews. I was hoping that their appetizing dessert menu would make up for the lackluster appetizers, but our rude neighbors totally killed our appetite. This restaurant will definitely have to retrain their staff on how to deal with disruptive customers before I'll be back.\n\nIf you're rude, crude, and like French food, this is the place for you -- everyone else should skip it.", "author": "Laren L."}

Waited for at least 5 minutes at the door and nobody greeted us. We saw a waiter serving food but was ignored until a little later when he told us someone will be with us in a bit. Finally, a man who seemed to be the owner attended to us but never bothered to offer us a menu to look at while waiting.\n\nIt's not a big place, 10-12 tables max but they were severely understaffed. There were a few cooks, 1 waiter/bartender, and the owner/bartender. Given the situation, the owner should be expediting the food but instead he was serving his friends and enjoying a glass of rose with them. Not a very good impression if you ask me. I could barely flag down a server to attend to me because he was making drinks at the bar.\n\nThe food is A-OK. I had the pork chops with mustard sauce and everything was good except that the pork is raw in the middle. It was gross! I then asked the server, whom I barely saw, to cook it more but it still came out raw near the bone area. I literally lost my appetite.

The staff here is all French which was cool, but the food was lackluster for the price. The burger that so many people rave about did not really stand out for me. Gamine uses a roll, much like a baguette, for the buns of the burger, but this really does not work. The bread is so crunchy and dense, that it kind of overpowers everything in the burger (which is not much to begin with). The $12 burger comes with just the buns, and the patty, and two tomatoes and lettuce on the side. Extras, pretty much necessary for a burger as plain as this one, cost $1.50 a pop so after adding cheese and bacon, you're at a mediocre $15 burger. The patty was the only thing that was done well in this burger, but a better choice of bread would have highlighted this. In addition to the burger, I also had a chance to try the calamari and a bowl of muscles. The calamari was good, but I wouldn't go on to recommend it. I prefer calamari with more breading and seasoning and both were lacking. As for the bowl of muscles, the portion size was *very* generous but the broth was a bit bland for my taste. I personally prefer the muscles that Plouff in the Fidi offers.", "author": "Austin W."}

They have your typical French food of course, such as escargot, but other than that, this place isn't anything special. I ordered the lamb stew proven\u00e7ale and my friend ordered the grilled flat iron steak. I can without a doubt say the steak was a much better choice. The portions are so so for the dishes, and the lamb left me with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth... coupled with the wine... just did not do it for me. The steak was actually quite good though.\n\nWe also ordered some of their sides (the sauteed spinach) which also... wasn't that great... for $5... it could've been better spent. This is definitely an expensive place. I didn't particularly care for the wine either. Didn't get too much service either...\n\nThe bathroom is also weirdly outside, in the way back (people seemed to be taking forever too... too much wine maybe).

Excellent as well.\n\nTo follow we split a burger.  A little light on the patty but nuce soft french bread and tasty fries.  If your very hungry this alone is probably not enough food.\n\nWe were stuffed though from the mussels and soup so no room for dessert.\n\nOverall we really enjoyed the experience so for anybody considering dining here give it a try.", "author": "jeremy L."}

We rolled up at 6:30ish on a Friday night, and while all the tables were full, we only had to wait 5 minutes until we were seated.  The place is quite cozy, so if you're not into eavesdropping, 1) that's weird, and 2) I wouldn't hit Gamine during a mealtime rush.  \n\nWe started w/ the beet and green bean salad w/ pistou oil based on a recommendation from another Yelper and the standard green salad.  My beets were pretty good--the pistou was nicely flavored, but it all needed a bit of salt and the green salad was nice--nothing wowing, but fresh and simple.\n\nFor my main I went w/ the grilled salmon, which came w/ eggplant \"caviar\", a bed of sauteed fennel, and green olive tapenade-type condiment.  The fish was outstanding--a nicely sized piece that was cooked perfectly; however, the accoutrements were completely bland.  I was pretty hungry so I wolfed most of it down anyways, but was disappointed that such a lovely piece of fish was ruined by its dining companions.  \n\nMy friend went for the \"veggie burger\"...and we ate on Friday and she is still having weird stomach issues as a result.  When we inquired what type of a veggie burger a French place would have, our waiter described it as ratatouille on a bun, which sounded kind of odd, but we were feeling frisky and were kind of picturing ingredients from that formed into a patty and pan seared, which sounds yum.  What she got was a mush of tomatoes, eggplant, and zucchini (admittedly, all ingredients for ratatouille) with some unidentified white stuff mixed in, which I suspect was goat cheese on a soft French roll.  I tried some and it was...weird.  I really appreciate the effort, but it just tasted off, and probably wouldn't be an adventure that I would want to take again.\n\nGamine is completely fine, and like I said, my fish was really excellent (aside from its plate partners), and while I probably wouldn't go back (um, the French bread was totally subpar at a French restaurant!), it was cute and I can see that for a certain set, it's an easy dinner choice for uncomplicated food that is relatively reasonably priced.

The wait staff was very attentive and we appreciated that.\n\nThe food was great starting with the warm bread served nice and crunchy on the outside, soft and light on the inside. My bf had the burger which he thoroughly enjoyed on the unique French bread bun while my friend and I split the Ratatouille, mussels, steak tartare and lamb sausage. We also had the calamari as a starter for the table. Probably the least interesting of all we ordered was the calamari because there wasn't anything particularly unique about it compared to fried calamari at other restaurants but I did notice that the breading was very seasoned which I personally l liked. The lamb sausage was spicy, steak tartare well seasoned, and the mussels plentiful and served with a delicious broth. We were too full to order dessert. \n\nThe wine list has a nice offering of mid-priced wines for the table.\n\nGive this a try if you're in the neighbourhood.

The service was utterly slow and the food was not worth the wait.\n\nYes, the restaurant was full and busy, but it's a tiny place and many customers were already eating their meal. It had to have been close to 9PM when we sat down and it took our gar\u00e7on quite a good bit of time to provide us with silverware, water, and menu. When we were finally ready to order, he never came back to check on us until we flagged him over (since he was too busy chatting with his French speaking customers... he did this several times throughout the night).\n\nThe food was mediocre, and that's being generous. The bread was cold and chewy, smoked duck breast salad was nothing special, steamed mussels were overly salty, and our main entree--lamb stew--came out about 45 minutes after our appetizers... because our gar\u00e7on had forgotten that we still had an entree coming! He actually asked us if we wanted dessert after we finished the mussels!! When we said we still had the stew coming, but wanted to cancel the order, he said he'll bring it out immediately--we weren't even hungry anymore by that point, with all the waiting. Turns out the stew was a failure. The lamb was overcooked and the potatoes and carrots completely undercooked... not the least bit soft.\n\nGetting the check was also another long waiting game, because yet again, our waiter was too busy being friendly to his French speaking customers.\n\nI will never recommend this place to anyone.", "author": "Steph C."}

Even the Brussels sprouts which I'm not too big on were delicious when soaked in the cream based sauce on the pork chop. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the chicken which was also amazing.

Jumping to the conclusion that we wouldn't buy any food, the manager informed us in a surprisingly rude way--and I mean rude even for a stereotypical French place--that we \"can't sit here and just drink coffee.\"\n\nWell, we wanted food, or I have to say, we had wanted food. Not anymore, life is way too short to convince rude managers that you want to spend some money.  And even if we HAD just wanted coffee, maybe Gamine should realize that--as a small neighborhood restaurant (with a lot of empty tables)--they shouldn't turn away neighborhood clientele who might have a good experience and come back for dinner.\n\nFor the record, we got delicious food AND coffee that comes with very nice, welcoming service at Rose's Cafe down the street.", "author": "Soeren S."}

No big deal.\n\nHowever, it was a big deal when, 45 minutes later, we'd been consistently ignored by the owner and/or manager.  Not only did we get stiffed on the (what I would think is) obligatory \"I'm so sorry you have to wait, blah, blah.\", but he saw fit to seat a group of his friends immediately after they arrived even though the party literally overtook half the tiny restaurant and he could have, instead, sat the 4 parties of 2 that were all there before them.  Perhaps they had a reservation, but if I were running a restaurant, I would make it very obvious (if not directly stating it) that my friends that I sat before you and all the other guests waiting made a reservation. \nThe food here might be delicious, but I'll never know because I'll never set food in that place again.

But you aren't there for the setting, you are there for the food!  And in that aspect, Gamine does not disappoint.\n\nWe started with the escargot, which was drenched in this buttery sauce.  Although the flavor was not as infused into the escargot as I expected, it was still a solid preparation.  The plus side was we got to dip our bread in the leftover sauce which was delicious.  I went with the mussels in creamy white sauce with mushrooms and leeks while S went for the lamb stew.  My mussels were delicious, with plenty of sauce for dipping the endless bread.  Tender and tasty.  S's lamb stew was also extremely tender, rich and fall apart with your fork.  We finished the night with a chocolate mousse that was served in a glass.  The presentation was different than what you normally see and smooth and creamy were the only ways to describe it.  \n\nAll in all, great food and only down a star because the place is so small and you will typically have to wait!  If the place was a little bigger, it would be a 5 star.", "author": "Brian C."}

In our quest to check out new-to-us places in our own neighborhood, we dropped by this cute little bistro on a rainy Tuesday evening and were treated to a fantastic meal that far exceeded our expectations. Smoked duck breast salad - fab. Assiete de Marguez (spicy lamb sausage) - def spicy with an even spicier sauce accompaniment - yum.  Flat iron steak - cooked to medium rare, melt-in-your-mouth perfection.  I'm not generally into big pieces of meat...on a plate, but the flat iron was impressive as I wasn't expecting this cut of beef to be so tender and succulent. Grilled pork chop - less than dazzling, could have used a hint more flavor.

The atmosphere, while a bit loud, is decidedly romantic. Everything is very red.\n\nThe seven of us were seated in the cozy back room. It was quieter, but the restroom's location outside meant that people had to walk past our table for access.\n\nI shared the fried calamari and ordered the penne pasta with salmon cream sauce. The calamari were crispy and flavorful. The portion was suited for 2-4 people. The pasta portion was just right for me and I loved the salmon cream sauce.\n\nThe food, drinks, and overall restaurant experience merit four stars. The fifth star is for the owner, Stephen. I understand that one trip to a restaurant is never enough to have a full experience, but I believe he went above and beyond as a host the night we came.\n\nWhen Stephen came up to the backroom to check on us, he playfully chastised one friend for his Oakland A's cap and another for requesting ketchup for his French Fries. \"You would ruin my French fries with ketchup?!\" He then asked a mustachioed friend if his mustache was for Movember, November's prostate cancer awareness/charity event. Our friend replied affirmatively and was rewarded with free beer for the rest of the night. Our Oakland A's cap friend said he'd shave his full beard into a mustache on the spot for the same perk. Stephen came back jokingly with a kitchen knife to help him shave, but ultimately offered the following deal. If our friend came back the next day with his beard shaved off, Stephen would donate $1000 from the restaurant to cancer research. After Stephen left the table, we decided we could wait no further. We dashed to the liquor store across the street, bought a 99 cent razor, and got to work in the restaurant's restroom with nothing more than hot water and hand soap. After the task was completed, Stephen was duly impressed, taking pictures and informing everyone that walked by of his deal. His friend had recently lost someone to cancer and he said he'd uphold his promise. We certainly hope he did. To top off the meal, we received a plate of creme brulee and a banana/nutella crepe on the house. Final tally: one fresh mustache, $1000 to cancer, and seven happy diners.\n\nAn experience like that affirms to me that a little humanity can go a long way.

It came tucked in a french roll that was the perfect amount of soft-no rough edges to navigate so I could focus on the good stuff in between.  My first bite or so was just the egg, bacon and brie which was a pretty stellar combination. The yolk pops and coats all the other ingredients lending a buttery flavor.  Soon enough though you get to the highlight of the whole thing.  The beef has been perfectly seasoned with pepper, not sure if there is anything else in there but maybe a few sprinkles of magic??  Truly astounding.  I could have just eaten the patty by itself it was seriously awesome.  At some point I got all of the ingredients at the same time and I'm fairly certain that time suspended and I floated to heaven.  Unreal.  \nMy friends ordered the veal special and the salmon and we shared the fries with aoli and the Brussels sprouts.  The veal was great, the aoli delicate and not too heavy.

Not a big deal in the grand scheme, but it counts at the end when you're paying that kind of a bill.\n\nAll that said, Gamine has great food. I usually avoid mussels in restaurants (it's just too easy to cook them at home for a tenth the price), but they really do know how to dish out moules frites here. You get a serious portion of bivalves in a scrumptious, heady broth. The merguez appetizer brings a lot of bang for your buck. And the burger with brie and an egg is probably the best burger I've had in the city. Oh mama, it's good. (Or zut!, perhaps.)\n\nSo, yeah, great food. Everything we've tried here has been tasty.

At first, it was cute and funny but after the 3rd time, it was just plain annoying. At one time, we didn't see anyone come by for 45 mins and I really wanted a coke. When he finally came, I asked him for a coke and he said \" no,\" of course I thought he was joking and that he would bring it up but he never did.\n\nThe food was good but I was very annoyed with the service.", "author": "Anna T."}

The owner would stop over and chat, and both he and our oooh la la (read: hot) French waiter were quite welcoming.  \n\nI had the special - pan seared scallops with pureed carrots and potato.  YUM.

Like normal people.  We went out.  To a restaurant.  Where other people cook for us.  And we didn't have to do the dishes.  I know.  CRAAAAzY.  But it happens to some people quite frequently.\n\nWednesday was the agree-upon date and I'd been overly pushy and suggested this place.  It seemed to have a mix of everything.  Burgers, fries, french food, and, in smaller print, BEEF TARTAR.  I love raw food.  I would be the perfect raw food enthusiast except for the fact that \"raw food\" generally refers to vegetation and not beef.  So I'll start my own group.  Don't hate.  Hater-ade.  \n\nThe girls picked me up and off we went.  Around the Divis Hill from my house, there was rock star parking.  Right.  In.  Front.  We arrived a little after 7 ish.  Though the place was fully seated, it was not packed.  We got seats at the bar where it was warm and we could preview all the food going out.\n\nI'm going to start a self-help group that has to do with looking at food before it's served.  I can't stop doing it.  I want to know what it looks like, what the plating is, observe the texture on the fried calamari, etc before I commit.  This is inclusive of my bigger problem with commitment.  But in the mean time, I think some people out there also like looking at food just before it goes out.\n\nWe started off with a glass of Rose champagne to celebrate my Fall Externship.  Then we each got a delicious appetizer.  I got the warm goat cheese salad, M got the baked cambazola and J got the escargot.  OH THE ESCARGOT.  That is what I usually get.  But it's ok.  I did the butter snatcher thing.  The baked cambazola was similar to gorgonzola but milder, and there was a whole roasted garlic in the side to either squeeze into it, or pick it out of the bulb.  \n\nEntrees: \nM got the moule with the SAUSAGE (lamb sausage, perfectly seasoned, dense, flavorful, toothsome, i could eat this with bread and butter all day).  The broth had fennel, harissa (what is this?), something red, some saffaron, butter, more butter, cream, butter.  I think we ate a whole extra baguette just to soak up the slurp.\n\nJ got the tilapia served on a bed of spinach.  I'm sure it was good, I didn't try any because I was trying to attack my own little monster.  But she ate the whole thing.  This was a case where we each got exactly what we wanted and ate it all.\n\nI got the entree size BEEF TARTAR.  It was served with 2 quail eggs.  And mixed together.  Though the spice was well thought out, I would have liked some more mustard and some cornichons.  GIVE A WOMAN SOME MINI PICKLES!!!  THAT IS THE CARDINAL RULE!!  If you see a gaggle of women out, chances are that pickles will always be welcome.  Now, when you give me those cornichons, I will give you the 5th star.\n\nFries - what can you say about these?  They were very French and thin.  Thinner than ordinary shoe-strings.  And when they were hot, they were good.  Towards the end, they were still good since we couldn't stop eating it.  I think it would have been better with the burger.  \n\nThe burgers coming out of the kitchen were the size of an iPad and bursting with fries and yum and nom and drool.  And even though we were uncomfortably full, we wanted to try to the burgers.  \n\n1 glass champagne\n1 glass wine\n1 appetizer\n1 entree\n$60 each including tip.\n\n20% increase chance of getting gout.  Well worth it.", "author": "Christina C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-07", "description": "Went here with a friend some time back.\n\nHe had the onion soup and the penne with salmon cream sauce. I went for the flat iron steak.\n\nThe soup was unremarkable. Onions, bread, cheese: all there. Nothing wrong with it; just not particularly fantastic. The penne was heavily seasoned with dill. Despite this, the salmon flavor still managed to make itself known.\n\n(note: I am of the belief that dill is a spice that should be used sparingly; use more than just a bit, and it will drown out all the other flavors of the dish. But that's just me, right?)\n\nWhen I ordered the steak, the waitress asked how I wanted it cooked. I was about to say \"medium well\" when she suggested medium rare. Huh. Well, OK, medium rare it is. The steak actually came closer to rare than to medium rare, but I figured it was close enough. The meat had a good balance of seasoning, and was very flavorful and tender to boot. I think that vegetables or roasted potatoes would have been a better pairing than shoestring french fries. But of course that didn't stop me from scarfing them down anyway.\n\nCreme brulee for dessert; also a very tasty dish. Even had little traces of vanilla bean visible in it. I had Black Muscat, which was excellent: Viscous, the right amount of sweetness, and very jammy. It's how dessert wine should be made.\n\nThe service was very good, though we actually stood in the restaurant for a couple of minutes browsing the menu before we were noticed. We arrived before the place became crowded, and I think the waitstaff was still preparing for the dinner rush to start. I giggled each time the waitress said \"merci\" even though she was no more French than I am.\n\nThe lighting in the place is well-balanced, with a tea candle on each table supplemented by very soft overhead lighting. You can read the menu and see your food without feeling like you're in a museum. The climate control could use a bit of a boost, what with the front door being used as the primary cooling mechanism. The place went from very warm to very cool several times, as the door was propped open and shut.\n\nFor dinner in the city, the prices are very reasonable. There were 3 waiters working in a place that could have been served by just one or two (which is a good thing). The abundance of waitstaff results in them checking on you frequently. Getting their attention is also very easy.\n\nNote: if you are going here with more than 3 people, I strongly advise you make a reservation. The place is very small (seating for ~25 people max) and once it gets busy, a party of 4+ could end up waiting for a long time.\n\nSo bottom line:\n\nFood - very good\nValue - excellent\nService - very good\nAmbiance - very good\n\n4.2 stars.", "author": "Tim B."}

It's a french place, but there was a decorative buddha on the wall, which had a pretty calming effect-- made me feel at home, at ease.  I had to do a double take because I thought maybe the wine was making me hallucinate a bit.\n\nI'm not sure if they provide bottle service here, but I would look into it next time.  You don't want to be paying 40/bottle during this recession, although I guess it's not that overpriced comparatively.  \n\nBeing the carb queen that I am, the potato gratin was delicious, and I would definitely order it again.  The creme brulee was really good too!  But I wasn't a big fan of the salmon with olive tapenade , so I think I'll probably opt for a burger next time.  \n\nOverall, a great meal, and I'll be coming back really soon.", "author": "Tracy N."}

We looked for it at Bev Mo but they didn't have it, which was probably better. \n\nWe ordered the Ratatouille as a starter and it was great! Delicious. My lady had never had it but after she did it spurred us to make our own at home. Very tasty.

But I read another review that said, A GREAT BURGER NEEDS NO SAUCE, THIS PLACE HAS THAT! So i got a Bacon and Brie cheese burger. Not a HUGE fan of either on their own but man it was EPIC together.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-09", "description": "I think I may have just discovered the best gem in San Francisco. \n\nFirst, allow me to clarify the whole Chez Maman thing. This is the same restaurant by a different name in Cow Hollow. So be not confused should you call and they answer the phone in an unexpected manner, as I initially was.\n\nOkay, onto the good stuff. I'll start with the unpretentious yet authentic French service. It began when I first called just to find out if they accept reservations. I must have sounded like a moron on the phone, because I was like, \"Wait, are you Chez Maman?\" Anyway, they only accept reservations for parties of six or more, but the gentleman on the phone kindly advised me to arrive around 7 pm for a minimal (10-20 minutes) wait on a Saturday night. Turns out, we enjoyed no wait at all when we arrived around 7:15, and sure enough, the place filled up and there was a line shortly thereafter.\n\nThe maitre d  was very friendly, seating two of us before the other two arrived (we told him they'd be arriving any moment, which they did).  No attitude about allowing us to occupy a table - you know what I'm talking about.\n\nWe were not rushed through the meal at all, which featured virtually flawless preparations across the board. First, we enjoyed some sort of melted cheese delight with garlic and toast that I could have eaten by myself (though it wouldn't have been pretty). Alongside that, we had calamari. Now, I normally do not like calamari, but the sauce that accompanied it was so amazing I didn't think twice about consuming it.\n\nNext, I'd heard great accolades about the burger, so that's what I (and 2 others) ordered. HOLY YUM. This is a high class burger that still makes sense. Onions are grilled to perfection, all of the vegetable accompaniments are fresh, and the baguette is crisp, yet soft enough to chew without having to pull awkwardly at the bread and make a giant mess. The only slight (and I do mean slight) disappointment here were the fries. I'd heard they were superstar amazing, and they certainly looked like it - I love shoestring fries. But there was a flavor I wasn't loving. However, grain of salt, I am pregnant, and sometimes things taste weird to me - so I'm not holding it against them one bit.\n\nAs if we hadn't stuffed our faces sufficiently already, thank God for dessert. Chocolate Mousse, Banana/Nutella crepe, and Tarte Tatin - all perfection. \n\nService remained very friendly (though at times, admittedly a little slow - however, this reduced any pressure on us to scarf down our food and give up our table). And at the one point in a meal that no one looks forward to, I was stunned - $135 pre-tip for four people to consume all that I've described, plus a bottle of wine. Are you kidding me? AND there wasn't a douche in the place, which I found mystifying on Union Street. \n\nI should have kept this secret to myself.", "author": "Kiesha R."}

The Moules Catalane (white wine, sausage, tomatoes) has been my favorite so far. Last time, I got the Moules Louisette (cream,leeks, mushroom), which was good, but became a bit too heavy towards the end, especially because i was dipping so much of my bread into the sauce. \n\nThe beau got the Lamb last time, and it was pretty bloody. I believe the server did warn him about it being a bit on the raw side, but he didn't expect it to be THAT raw. No one's fault. Just a bit of misunderstanding. \n\nThe price is reasonable, and you get a decent portion. No question about whether you'll be full or not after a meal at here. The service here is really friendly.

Service was attentive the entire meal, and I love how it felt very French in that we were not rushed out of the place, even though people were waiting to be seated.  We were allowed to talk and take our time, which was much appreciated.\n\nThe waiter was helpful in making wine selections, and the wine he recommended to go with my burger was perfect.\n\nI ordered the famous burger with gruyere cheese and pomme frites, and I think I may have found a rival to my previous favorite (the Balboa burger).  This burger was served perfectly cooked, I ordered medium and it was still pink with a little juiciness to it, on a ciabatta-type roll that was toasted and delicious.  The cheese was melted just enough and not too much.  I'm starting to sound like Goldilocks, but seriously this burger was just about perfect.  The pomme frites were sliced thin and crisp on the outside, sprinkled with parsley and salt.  There was no ketchup on the table, and I debated asking for some, but I am so glad I didn't as I really didn't need it.  The meal was perfect just how it arrived.  \n\nMy friend ordered the roast chicken, which was served cut up with roasted potatoes.  I did not taste it, but he ate the whole thing and said it was delicious.  \n\nI had forgotten about this place despite living so close to it, but I will certainly be coming back here again soon!

Therefore I say with confidence and enthusiasm that this is far and away the most authentic French cuisine in the city. You simply cannot go wrong with any dish you order. The menu is deceptively simple: \"what,\" you think, \"is so special about a plain old roasted chicken?\" And then every morsel of it is so flavorful, so juicy, with such subtle flavors of herbs, butter, lemon, and who-knows-what-else, that you think it should have been called something different on the menu. Perhaps \"Roasted Bird of Paradise Bursting With Flavor, Whose Gorgeous Juices I Must Soak Up With My French Bread Ommm Nom Nomm.\" This is so for all the \"simple\" plates. \n     Fantastic wine list, too. And the owner, Stephan, is such an absolutely lovely, friendly, and charming gentilhomme that you will be tempted to walk past \"Gamine\" at all times of day just to receive his two kisses of greeting on your cheeks. His partner, too, is a beautiful brunette lady who manages to be at every table at once, almost single-handedly ensuring that the service here is also five stars.\n      Go. Vive la France.

I don't even eat beef, remember? That's how good this was. My bf said it was the best burger he's ever had. Here's the funny part because up til now it was no talking, all seriousness in love with food moments...the waiter comes and asks how we're doing and we say that is the best burger hands down. Ever. The waiter said. \"I know.\" Not cocky just simply agreeing in a sweet humble way. So it's handmade with love apparently.\n\nSecond time....the following year it was packed and we had to wait an hour in the cold outside. Not like anyone wants to wait in the cold but we didn't care. We were so happy to know that in one hour we would be sitting in this little romantic spot where greatness comes from. Must have been some word of mouth here cause it was so much busier this time. The owner was so kind and made sure to give us some wine while we waited and crack some jokes and kept checking on us.

I have to agree with other people who visited the restroom\nfacilities....nice.  It was like a completely different atmosphere\nfrom the busy front restaurant.   If the rent is good, I'll move in.\n\nAs a parting gift, two glasses of dessert wine arrived just before \nthe check.  It was a nice touch...totally unnecessary but very\nappreciated.

Every time I bring a Chez virgin here, they drool, commenting over and over again, \"Best burger I've ever had\".  \n\nI've found it hard to enjoy a burger elsewhere in SF without endlessly comparing. Even at some of the finer burger establishments (i.e. Bistro Aix, Barney's, Spork); I find myself dreaming of the soft/crunchy French roll, the perfectly cooked juicy meat, and of course: THE CHEESE. This is the secret recipe to the success of this phenomenal burger. I recommend trying either the gruyere and if you like strong cheeses, I say go for the roquefort (my personal fav). I would do it injustice if I didn't mention the aioli sauce. That is a incredibly nice touch to the masterpiece. The fries are small, crunchy, and scrumptious. \n\nThe best part is you can have any dish here and be impressed.\n\nNow, excuse me, but I'm going to grab a burger.", "author": "E. N."}

But what really makes this place special is the people that work there and run the place, so warm and friendly.

OMGoodness, who does this anymore? Warm, kind, friendly, not stuffy, lovely ambience and the best food in the world, who could ask for more, right?

The burger patty on its own is just so simple and juicy...you can just taste the purity of the beef.  But it just wouldn't be me if I didn't add bacon and an egg to it (I recently was worried about my cholesterol, but since it tested normal, I say bring on the fat!).  You can also add fancy cheeses to it.\n\nI also had the fish n chips, both of which were kinda bland.  The fish had more of a breadcrumb crust than a wet batter crust.  The fries were crispy but just didn't have enough flavor and the accompanying aioli which just tasted like mayo didn't help.  \n\nThe portions aren't huge and even though I was full, I just had to try a dessert crepe.  The waiter couldn't really explain to me what the chestnut cream crepe was like and recommended berries n creme fraiche, but I was too curious about the chestnut one.  The chestnut creme was not too sweet, a little gritty, and almost tasted chocolatey...very tasty.  And I thought the crepe had the perfect texture...a little undercooked.  A hand-held crepe should be dry and crispy, but a crepe eaten on a plate should be soft and melt in your mouth.  I'd like to try one of their savory crepes but they're only served for lunch (and brunch maybe?). \n\nI've passed by the tiny Potrero Hill location and read the reviews about its long wait.  There was no wait on a weeknight here, so I think it was worth the trip to the Marina.

My mom and I split the warm goat cheese salad. This was also excellent. I had bragged so much about the burger and mussels that we got both again, but we also ordered the pork chop which I was truly surprised by!

Now initially, I was skeptic of the idea; cmon now, French food for guy's nite out? I had only been to a French restaurant once, and that was in Paris. The rest of the time, I had only gone to establishments that serve crepes. Then again, it didn't help that Saturday was a scorching day in the bay area, which created massive traffic from the East Bay and probably 20 minutes looking for street parking. City folks: take the Muni or carpool if possible, as parking around here is pretty tight. \n\nVivid red outside decor which was easy to spot. Went in and surprisingly got a table instantly. Staff was very friendly and very courteous, sat us down even while waiting for our third person, not many restaurants do that these days.\n\nAs for the grub: my friend has the roasted chicken, the other had the burger, and I had the flat iron steak. Great dishes all around. For an appetizer, we had the calamari and escargot.\n\n-The calamari was well prepared and went well with the garlic butter and wasn't rubbery. \n-As for the steak, very tender and juicy as a medium-well cut and had some of the best shoestring french fries, also known as pommes frites. Paired with a spicy, but medium red wine and the meal was very good. \n-My friend really liked his burger, which is the signature dish at this palce. They have meat, chicken, and even salmon, so sophisticated burger \n \nAs for dessert, my buds had the creme broulee, which they enjoyed, was they liked since it was warm throughout and didn't need to be nuked or blowtorched! \n\nI give it a solid 4 because the steak was well prepared and the service was great on a Saturday. Didn't have vegetarian options, with exception to of a salad, so herbivores be forewarned. Not too many tables, and only one big round table in the back area, so might be tough for groups.

The fiance and I meant to just grab some cupcakes from down the street and head to Barney's for burgers - when something struck me to stop here. And I'm so glad I did! Usually busy which deters me from waiting, the wait wasn't really bad. Granted when we first asked for a table for two, it was a 20 minute wait - the already seated guest kept ordering desserts, coffee, tea or champagne which made 20 minutes a lot closer to 45 minutes.\n\nBut when diners sit over a nice glass of wine and enjoy their conversations after a meal, to me it is a testament of how comfortable the place is. Gamine (as it recently changed names) is nostaligic, comfortable and very intimate. The atmosphere created by the host and his partner is so inviting and warm, it's like they're inviting you into their home for a meal with friends and family. During out wait outside the Host stepped out to chit chat and was very friendly, his demeanor was caring and attentive to us and those waiting as he fills glasses with wine, and mingles with casual conversation. It was relaxing even before we got to our meal.\n\nFinally seated, he brings us complimentary apps for our patience, but it wasn't needed - the food here is worth the wait. I had the grilled flat steak with frittes, the fiance had the lamb and potato gratin made with lardon. Absolutely DIVINE. The steak was tender with a delicate bernaise sauce and the frittes with aioli hit the crave button on the nose. His lamb light and buttery dripping in a nice reduction and the potato gratin? Seriously some addictive bites there. The staff is uber attentive without being overbearing, and the Host said - he's not one to ever rush his guest, one should enjoy their food while dining with him. His partner inside exude that to the letter - while he host, she runs tables - together they made our meal one to remember. And did I mention, so affordable too? \n\nIt wasn't a night to celebrate anything, but it definitely made our night, warmed our tummies and put a big full smile to our faces.

This means that the money I save can be diverted to other causes such as being able to afford French Laundry.\n\nThe three of us came here on a Thursday evening and yes, trust the reviews that say this place is small. I didn't see the group section but the main area is about as small as a large bedroom. The tables are small and comfortably seat only two people at a time. We had to sit at the bar because all the tables were taken. This gave us the opportunity to see our food being made and salivate (not drool though) in the process. \n\nStarters: The French onion soup was good but there was a bit too much cheese on the top. You'd almost think it was a pizza. My friend ordered the poached egg and duck confit salad, which he said was good but could've used a little more flavor.\n\nEntrees: Two of us got mussels with fries (fries are not included in the entree's price) and one got the burger. There was nothing to complain about for all of our dishes. The fries are addicting because they are shoestring, which means they taste deceptively light. Luckily we shared the fries so no one person was burdened with burning off the calories of the fries. \n\nDessert: Let me start by saying of the group of three, two of us will choose a restaurant solely based upon the appeal of the dessert menu. While the dessert menu appears to be blah, let me tell you that the dessert was so good we scarfed it down even after we had said we were full. The chocolate mousse tastes light and has a surprise of a nutty crunch to break up the texture. The creme fraiche and berry crepe went well with the mousse. The crepe itself was not too \"doughy\" but held the berries well. \n\nThe total bill was quite reasonable for a French place. If there was a complaint, it was that we were served based upon French dining time, meaning our meal took about 2 hours rather than the usual sit-and-scarf 45 minutes places. We wouldn't have minded the lapse of time if it weren't for the fact that we were hungry coming in.", "author": "Gwen L."}

I know..I know...its just a hamburger, at a French restaurant, no less. How good can it be? Very good!\n\nThe burger comes with grilled onions, tomatoes, aoili (sp?) sauce, and for $1.50 more, some cool cheese/bacon. Since my plan to lose 7lbs in one month begins this week, I figured I'd go all out one last time. I ordered the burger with roquefort cheese AND bacon (as suggested by the nice waitress), and chose salad instead of fries. And a glass of red wine. Classy, I know. \n\nMy friend and I sat at the bar, so we got to watch the chefs cook, and the head chef/maitre'de speak french to ppl. It was awesome. One star off because the bathroom was scary.

The host was extremely accomodating and the ambience was a little loud but nice.  The wine list is a bit thin but there was no shortage of selections for dinner.  The baked camembert was excellent, the mussels were great (and a generous serving), and the veal was very good as well.  The location is good...just far enough away from the Marina bars so that you won't get caught up in a bar fight on your way out, but close enough that you can go get a drink before or after dinner.\n\nAlso, they have a table upstairs that fits about 10 people and is a really good option for a group dinner that doesn't break the bank.\n\nFairly romantic, very moderately priced, and good food.  Definitely better all-around than Choquet up the hill.  A little weird to see quesadillas on the menu at a French restaurant, but maybe it's a fusion thing.

It is hands down, the perfect dining experience, I've been there about a dozen times, so I know the food and service is consistant.  \n\nThe ambiance is a small room with about 10 tables, dark yellow-orange walls, small bar, nice soft lighting and incredible smells coming from the small open kitchen.  The host is wonderful and welcoming, we were on first name basis after dining there twice and he remembers me every time I return (as well as treating me and my date to free food/wine!)\n\n  I LOVE the mussels & french onion soup, but I've also really enjoyed a salmon pasta, ravioli, pork chop, brussel sprouts, salads and WINE! Oh, and the chocolate mousse is to die for.  The cream sauce is on the heavy-side, so if you like light cream sauces, you should probably stay clear of the pastas.  \n\nNOTE to girls:  One of the waiters is so gorgeous that it's worth going to eat here even if you don't like french food just to check out the french boy.\n\nNOTE to guys:  If you take a date here, she'll thank you for it later...

Well unfortunately, mediocrity killed the cat.\n\nOh hello interesting girl please seat us and not next to the ONLY other two people in the place....oh wait of course we must be forced to dine right next to them!  \n\nOnce seated she gave us a drink menu.  After the one minute it sat on our table she grabbed it and handed it to the table next to us (before we had even looked at it)?  Perplexed...um quite a bit.  Not to say she wasn't friendly, she just clearly doesn't know what she's doing.\n\nWhen I go out to eat, and the word \"CHEZ\" is involved in the title I have some expectations.  Mostly on the service side, but also what I'm forking into my mouth.  That being said you don't just snatch up the drink menu (when there are many more over there on the little service table and there is only one other couple in the place) and give it to the next table without saying a word.....mostly it's just awkward.\n\nThe good news is that the food wasn't a as disappointing as the service had been.  The salad, burger, and calamari were pretty good.  Seasoned well, cooked correctly, but not something I would come back for.  BUT...*redemption*...the Mussels Maman were very good.  I have actually thought about these a few times and have since found them to be surprisingly memorable.  \n\nThe biggest problem I really had with the food (and apparently service) is that the other server told us the creme brulee was \"excellent\".  This turned out to be a down right lie! This creme brulee BLEW.  More importantly it was the wrong consistency and they couldn't even correctly caramelize the sugar on top to create a crust.  The whole point is to have a thin layer of crackly goodness, and this was gooey caramel atop really funked up pudding....BOO.\n\nSo decent food with so-so service...maybe...but I'd rather go somewhere new.", "author": "Rachel P."}

Ambience is a homerun. \n\nFIRST TIME\nMy first trip to Gamines was with my wife. We walked through Union looking for a great place to eat. I remember seeing positive reviews of Gamines on YELP! and also hearing great reviews from a buddy of mine and his wife that go here regularly, so we decided to give it a shot. \n\nOur experience was bliss. The service was exceptional! The restaurant manager greeted us, our server walked us through the menu with energy and friendliness. \n\nWe tried out the french onion soup and our tastebuds were not disappointed! Then I went with their burger, hearing such great things about it. I dare say you may not find a better gourmet burger in town. And the skinny french fries with aioli were addictive! My wife ordered the New York strip, and it was loaded with juicy flavor. This restaurant also does quite well with the pre-meal bread offerings they provide. Very tasty! We wanted to stay for the Banana Nutella treat at the end, but we were simply too full, and the evening was perfect for taking a walk. A great evening that had us thinking warm & fuzzies for Gamines! \n\nA great place to grab a bite for a casual date -- and there's even this awesome back room you can reserve in advance for a larger group! Good ambience! \n\nSECOND EXPERIENCE: \nStill pumped about this little place, we decided to take my brother and sis-in-law here (it was her birthday). The manager again greeted us, and without a reservation on a busy Friday night, he was able to accommodate us inside. It was a late dinner (8pm) and everyone was really hungry. We also had our adorable 3-year nephew with us, who is pretty well-behaved for settings such as this one. The young guy who served us turned out experience around: condescending and rude. I don't know if the kid bothered him, the fact that no one wanted drinks, or if it was just a long night for him, but I was slightly embarrassed at how the interaction was going with he and my family. When asked questions, he was short. The birthday girl, when ordering the NY Strip Steak, asked a question that is a \"no no\" in culinary practice, she asked if she could get her steak well done. Now, my sis-in-law is 6 months pregnant, and is very careful about it. I've also heard this question handled very well in the past \"I'm sorry, our chef can serve it medium, and if it needs to be cooked further, we can accomodate.\" Something usually along these lines. We got, instead, something just short of an eye roll and an exclaimed reply with brows furrowed: \"Well done?????\" My sis-in-law turned red and everyone was uncomfortable. Then my brother ordered the burger for his son and asked if they could cut it in half when it was served. The reply? \"You have a knife, you could just as easy do it yourself!\" I was appalled. Cut the dang steak, dude!!! We are your patron, not someone inconveniencing you. I was embarrassed. After talking the place up, my brother and sis-in-law were not having a good time. \n\nIn fairness, the food was great that night. Everyone was pleased. The service just put a damper on the evening and had us rushing to get out of there. I would have shared with the manager, but doing so in front of the server seemed to be too much confrontation for the moment. The manager did check on us and ask how our experience was, to his credit. \n\n(Our poor b-day girl compounded her frustrating evening by walking into the men's restroom! That was a hoot!)", "author": "James S."}

How do they do it?  The ambiance is warm and inviting in a \"I can't believe I found this wonderful little restaurant\" kind of way.  The waiters are classy, professional with just the right amount of charm to guide you exactly where you want to go.  If you enjoy French classics plus and don't want to be bullied by food critics that tell us we have to eat sushi, sushi, sushi and that's all there is, well then this is the restaurant for you!

For those of you who have not had it, to me, the escargot kind of had the texture of clams, and tasted the way potting soil smells..\n\nThe leaves in the arugula salad were each covered in dressing yet remained crisp and fresh.  The bleu cheese, which normally has a flavor much too strong for me, actually went very well with the salad.  It had a nice mild flavor  with a soft and light texture.\n\nThe MUSSELS were delicious.  I got the mussels in tomato sauce with sausage.   It came in a big pot, and each mussel was steamed just-right, not oversteamed, and no unopened mussels.  Only thing was that the tomato sauce was too watery. Though it was GOOD, I would much rather recommend the mussels in white sauce with mushrooms.  The cream sauce was amazing, and really brings out the flavor of the mussels better than tomato sauce.  That and the mushroom flavor really adds to the cream sauce and all in all, that makes it a delicious combo. \n\nLast but not least, was the berry crepe in creme fraiche.

I found Gamine searching the web & an acquaintance recommended it as well. We had lunch on Sunday and loved it. It is charming, the service was attentive without being overly gratuitous, a nice brunch and lunch menu & even though they were busy and the bistro was full, they did not rush us out. I ordered the frisee, smoked duck breast & poached egg salad & the mussels. he salad was quite good, but I prefer duck confit to the smoked duck breast, so might try a different salad next time. My partner had the onion soup gratinee (amazing!) and the grilled flat iron steak and fries. The food was really wonderful. For dessert we ordered the tarte tatin (quite good) and the waiter brought out complimentary glasses of muscat...nice touch!  The only reasons I did not rate Gamine a 5 are the chairs could use a good cleaning (the wood slats between the chair legs were pretty dirty and not very appealing) and that the tarte tatin was not perfect.  I am being pretty nit picky here and that being said we can't wait to go back.!  PS...we drove from the central valley and will GLADLY drive almost 2 hours just to dine at Gamine.", "author": "D P."}

It is very casual and has a very friendly and warm energy. The whole place is inundated from the kitchen sumptuous aromas of the dishes they're preparing. If you're into escargots, this is the place to order them in San Francisco. They're simply outstanding and a delightful culinary experience. Anyway I have been coming to this cozy restaurant every now and then for the past few years and I can't stop recommending it to all my friends. As a matter of fact last year I laughed at a review written by Phoede L. on 7/4/2014, who didn't even eat there because \"waiting for 5 minutes\" was unacceptable for her and therefore she \"judged\" the waiter as being \"racist with a French accent\". This is absolutely ridiculous and it's telling more about her character and her review is totally irrelevant in my opinion. I highly recommend this restaurant and I sincerely can't praise the delicious food they serve in a homy atmosphere. Bon appetit.", "author": "Keith D."}

The waiter was very cool, from france and gave us pointers  on which towns to visit.\n\n**Update: Finally made it back there for dinner.  the panini was not on the dinner menu anymore, but we ordered calamari, a burger with goat cheese, and the flat iron steak with frites. The calamari was excellent and the aioli it comes with is rich but I can't get enough of it!  The steak was cooked how I asked, it was very tender and the aioli and black pepper sauce was delicious.  The burger was very good too, ordered with a healthy serving of goat cheese.  The prices are reasonable for French food.  The service was excellent, they were very attentive, friendly and efficient.  The seating area is small, so be prepared to be sitting very close to the people at the next table.  It's dimly lit and perfect for a romantic dinner for two.\n\n\n***Update #2\nI really love this place. First of all, it is totally cozy and cute and you forget you're in the Marina.  The staff there is friendly and service is great.  This time we had the french onion soup (shared by 2) and I ordered the roast chicken.  I guess the roast chicken isn't just roast chicken because it comes with a sauce.  But that sauce is so delicious, two pieces of chicken, a thigh and breast.  Breast was a little dry but thigh was excellent.  Accompanied with fingerling potatoes, the portion is great too. The fries that come w/ the burgers are crispy and consistently good too.

It is a funky area draped with red but it gave us just the privacy we needed to have a grand time.  The wait person was very good to us.  \nFood - The French Onion soup was perfect. We shared orders of the merguez sausage, smoked duck and an entree sized order of mussels in garlic as appetizers.  All were good, mussels were outstanding.  Hunks of bread were used to sop up every last drop from the generous portion.\nFor mains we ended up with multiple orders of the lamb and the flat iron steak.  Steak was excellent but not what I was expecting - it had almost a gravy on a sizeable thick cut of meat where I thought it would be a thinner drier cut and preparation.  But delicious nonetheless.

I was slightly annoyed that the waiter didn't even give us plates since we were sharing the salad. Did he really expect us to eat off the one plate and make a mess?

It was plated neatly as a \"pattie\" on the plate topped with a dabble of cream sauce with four pieces of thinnly sliced, toasted baguettes. The steak was fresh and tasty. Pretty good.

Mason online, so when we got the event it was sold out. I had to sell my tickets (because I took my own advice), and sulked the rest of the day about how I was supposed to be giant beer stein in one hand and bratwurst in the other screaming \"PROST!\"\n\nIn any case, we arrived at Chez Maman, and decided that if we're going to eat, this place seemed alright.\n\nThe decoration and ambience of the restaurant is very Parisian. Having been there, I distinctly remember the lighting, seating and earthy colors of most Parisian cafes and restaurants, so this felt familiar.\n\nWe started with calamari. My gf and I were feeling a bit daring, so we ordered a beef tartare appetizer. it was my first time trying ground beef tartare (I'm used to the Asian thinly sliced raw beef), and it was a pleasant experience.\n\nMy gf ordered a pork chop, and I thought it was strange that the waitress asked how she would like it cooked???... I was always under the impression that pork had to be cooked all the way through for fear of getting food poisoning, but after discussing this with a friend of mine who is a chef and restaurant owner, he said that technically, once you cook the meat up to a certain temperature (I think he said 140 degrees or so) that bacteria could no longer survive in it. I don't know; the thought of a RARE pork chop does not seem appetizing at all to me.\n\nIn any case, I ordered a burger, which was cooked perfectly, and was served with some of the most incredible French fries I've ever had. The sauce that came with it all was spectacular, and I used it on everything.\n\nThe price for the food was nominal, and was an even trade for food and service provided.\n\nKudos to Chez Maman.

First off a Bistro is generally a small, unpretentious restaurant that serves small reasonably priced meals. Perhaps I'm missing something  but my burger came in at $15.50. That just doesn't seem reasonable to me. Additionally, when I asked for catchup for the fries I was told that  they didn't have any. Then the person, who I believe was the owner, returned with catchup but then went on to tell me not to ask for it again or the chef would get mad (excuse me chef but if I'm paying 15.50 for a burger I'll  order some f-ing catchup if I want to.) Not sure about  you but the whole \"we don't have catchup because we're French seems a bit pretentious.

We're talking the perfect balance of sweet, salt, and tang.  The lemon and thyme come together nicely to make this amazing chicken-stock-based liquid that is possibly the best glaze I've ever tasted.

I've only been here once, but can I confess to you: I'm totally planning our next SF trip around this place. No lie. It was THAT pleasant.\n\nThe bf, college friend ('sup Victor B.), and I came here after having dinner at Kasa Indian Restaurant just a few strolls down. The bf and I also had just experienced Ghirardelli Square's Wine Festival earlier that day, so we were having a lovely day, to say the least. It was late, but the place was paaacked (it's the size of a thumb, really, so it being super-packed shouldn't be much of a surprise). We waited about 15 minutes to be seated at the bar, which turned out to be a fun experience because we got to watch the cooks make all of the food that we would possibly order on another night when we weren't already stuffed. We each ordered glasses of wine and commenced wonderful conversation among each other, as well as with our server -- a beautiful French woman who also happened to be part owner (? if I remember correctly). She explained to us that the large group seated behind us was the other owner and his party of fellow restaurant owners and friends. They had just hosted their annual charity golf tournament that day and were now celebrating with rounds and rounds of delicious food and drinks. Lots of drinks. At one point, the whole table (which took up the entire left side of the restaurant) broke out into a jaunty French song and I ABSOLUTELY FELL IN LOVE. It was so much fun! Everybody was so jolly, and it seemed like the owners knew at least half (not including the large party and employees) of the people in the restaurant, which was basically all 6 other people besides us.\n\nWe ended up staying at the bar for longer than we had anticipated, mostly because we were having such a great time, and also because not a single person made us feel rushed and anxious to leave. In fact, after telling our hostess that we were only there for dessert and drinks, she took the liberty to pour us free dessert wine. Furthermore, I think she was telling us about the wines and sharing with us her own tastes. If I were just a little more sober, I would have remembered -- but that just goes to show you how great of a time we had there! I even tried out my French as we were leaving: \"Bonjour! Merci!\"\n\nWill definitely, DEFINITELY be coming back, hopefully for dinner.

Well, it is if you're in Paris, but not if you're in San Francisco.  \n\nWhat Gamine manages to do is hold true to its roots.  It's French, so the service has attitude, the experience is meant to take time, and the food needs to be mopped up with a baguette.  If you're expecting fast service with \"the customer is always right\" attitude, then you've come to the wrong place.  If, however, you know better than to expect your lunch or dinner to take a minimum of 2 hours, then Sweet Jesus, you've found a piece of Paris in San Francisco.  \n\nHow the hell did it find its way there?  Excellent question.  It has had predecessors that have done well, but Gamine branches out.  It has not tried to cater to San Francisco, in fact, it has practically thumbed its nose at the city.  It has flair, attitude, and real Frenchmen working the scene (for better or for worse).  \n\nThe menu is French bistro fare at its finest.  There's an assortment of appetizers worth experiencing, including the escargot, which are cooked in a stick of butter and are the tenderest, most delectable morsels of snail-y goodness that you're likely to find.  If you've been waiting to experience this dish because you haven't had the stomach for it, this is the place to suck it up and give it a go.  You won't be disappointed.  The warm fris\u00e9e and duck confit salad was excellent, and the shredded duck meat was cooked perfectly - moist and tender - while the fresh cooked egg on top was spot on what you'd hope for from this dish.   The calamari were acceptable, and cooked perfectly in terms of consistency, but they were on the greasy side and mostly something to whet our appetites.  \n\nFor main courses, the pork chop was good - recommended by our waiter - and while I agree that it's preparation did allow for a full experience of fresh, juicy pork, and the apple cider mustard sauce was an excellent complement, I still was not sold on the brussel sprouts .  They needed to be cooked with some of the pork juices, in my opinion, and they weren't enough of a side to stand up to the pork chop by themselves.  The mussels were very good, but I've had better.  (I still think Plouf can boast the best in the city.)  The frites were excellent, and were we not stuffed by the end of the meal, we would have ordered another plate to dump into and soak up our mussel broth - THAT'S the way to eat mussels.  Had we more diners, I would have insisted on trying one of their assortment of burgers.  They offer a variety, and from the looks of other patrons' plates and faces, these were delectable - just the right size, weight, assortment of toppings and (according to our waiter) freshness, as they don't even have a freezer on the premises.\n\nWe ate lunch at one of the three tables outside and had the pleasure of dining leisurely for two hours.  The inside, were it filled to capacity, would likely have been boisterous and cramped, but that's what an authentic French bistro SHOULD be, damn it.  This is a wonderful, quaint neighborhood spot that is perfect for a lunch or a dinner where you plan to spend time talking with your companion or date.

All of these fire on all cylinders at Chez Maman in Cow Hollow.\n\nThis was a first visit at the suggestion of friends I was dining with (truth be told it was Plan B after learning of the two-plus hour wait at SPQR).  Couldn't be happier about the change of venue.\n\nAfter a bit of the expected raised eyebrow from proprietor Stefan for admitting to a veg + seafood-only diet, I settled on a salad of beets, haricot verts, and feta cheese (fantastic...I don't even like beets!) and the pan-seared salmon with fennel confit and tapenade (also very nice).  I had brought along a couple of bottles ('04 Burrell School Pinot and a '04 Soquel Vineyards Reserve Cab) so I didn't select any from the house list.  Chez Maman is very much a neighborhood bistro - Stefan is very welcoming and seems to be old friends with most of the patrons (mine from that evening included).  As it was, he ended up spending spend much of the evening at our table.\n\nAnyway, if great food and great service in a cool little neighborhoody French Bistro with a kind of - je ne sais quoi - streets-of-Paris (or Marseilles) atmosphere sounds like your notion of a good time...please go.

Small, intimate, not at all pretentious, and - most importantly - amazing food at a great price.

I decided to binge on fromage and make a meal out of french onion soup and a fried goat cheese salad, both of which were excellent. I also ordered the baked cambozola appetizer to share with the table. Stinky cheese fondue served with a head of roasted garlic and toast points = heaven on a plate!

Hubby and I took his parents to celebrate their 48th wedding anniversary.  It is NOT easy to get my father-in-law out of the house so I was sooooo happy this place delivered...and that all of you yelper reviews were spot on!\n\nVery small place.  There were 6 of us so we took up a big portion of the space in here.  As soon as we walked in, we felt right at home as the owner greeted us.  This is really not a great place for kids due to the size and of course no kids menu but if you come early, before 6, it's doable.  A group came in while we were dining and they had a very young one with them...the other customers did not look so pleased at the noise, lol.  Mine are 11 and 7 so they know how to behave.\n\nAnyway, here is what we ordered:\nFried Calamari with aioli\nFrench Onion soup\nRoasted beet salad\nFlat Iron Steak \nHamburger\nGrilled Salmon \nRoasted Chicken\nSpaghetti w/ butter and cheese\n\nOk, the spaghetti was a special order for my son...the kid eats nothing!  The food was extremely delicious.  The roasted beet salad was mixed with this creamy goat cheese, fabulous.  The fried calamari came with a garlicky, slightly spicy aioli that was delicious.  My only complaint was the calamari was too overdone.  My husband said the french onion soup was good.\n\nHubby and I had the flat iron steak, medium rare.  It came with bearnaise sauce and aioli and french fries.  Could NOT get enough of the aioli and its garlicky creamy goodness!  Dipping the skinny, tasty little french fries in...heaven.  The french fries were an amazing mix of crispy and soft.  I personally like my fries on the skinny side. Daughter had the hamburger with nothing on but cheddar, and they also put more of the aioli on it.  It comes on this homemade bread and she had it with those yummy fries.  I had the chance to taste it when she got full.....I have never had a burger so incredibly tasty as this.  Ever.  Mom-in-law had the roast chicken.  Now, I would never myself order roast chicken in a restaurant, I tend to get the more \"complicated\" dishes...but holy wow, it was so tender, juicy, and the sauce had this incredible flavor!  Father-in-law had the salmon.  I'm not a fan of cooked salmon but it looked wonderful...and he cleaned the plate!\n\nFor dessert we got an order of Crepes Suzette....which comes to the table still aflame, lol.  A chocolate mousse, and a banana and nutella crepe.  It was all....exquisite.  The texture of the crepes were like fluffy pillows!\n\nI highly recommend this little local gem, I know we can't wait to go back there and order some hamburger and Roast Chicken for ourselves!", "author": "Rachel C."}

I found parking across the street from Gamine, yelped it and decided to give it a try. \n\nIt's about 12:30 or 1pm now, so the place is slightly crowded, but there were open seats to be had. We walked in and waiting at the front. A couple walked in behind us a few seconds later and were waiting behind us. You might be asking yourself why I'm telling you that. Well, the waiter decided to literally walk around us (it's a tight entrance, so its impossible to have not see us?) and squeeze by my girlfriend to ask the couple behind how many guests - and proceeded to show them their seats. *My girlfriend just about blew up, and I just about walked out. Thankfully the couple was decent and told the waiter we were there first. *Strike one. I know I'm young, but come on...or maybe he had a little Hitler in him. \n\nOn to the food. The food was okay. Nothing special. We had the lamb sausages which were quite good. It didn't have a gamy (spl?) taste to it and the sauces complimented it. The chef apparently dropped half of one, so we got an extra piece. Okay, so they might be climbing back up from that earlier blunder. \n\nWe also had the prosciutto pannini and a Eggs Norwegian. \nBoth dishes were okay, the smoked salmon on the eggs was pretty good actually. The sandwich , well...I've had better at a.g. Ferrari foods for a lower price. \n\nGamine lost more points on their service yet again. When we were finishing our sausages, two ladies sat next to us for some lunch. The waiter took their order and left with our empty plates. I kid you not, the next time we saw our waiter, he brought out their food. We sat there wondering if they had to slaughter the pig and age the meat for our sandwich. 5 Minutes pass, and we still don't have anything. We inquire with our waiter who then goes to the kitchen and checks. Food comes out 10 minutes later. Great. By now the ladies next to us are paying and are on the way out. We just had a group sit down and leave before us! We we in Paris while they were in SF? I mean, French people eat slow. I get it. But why the long wait for us and not them? \n\n\nSorry guys, I won't be coming back anytime soon. From the start, they messed up. I'll spend my coin down the block at the other restaurants. \n\nI'd stay away if I were you. 4 stars - overrated.

I swear I had eaten at at least 50% of them living in the city for a few years but I'm near positive I haven't even gotten to 30%.  My old friend came back into town this weekend and he took us to this spot on Union Street.  It's a small little rustic french restaurant, definitely not too pretentious.  The ambiance along with the wood decor was very casual but upscale.  There is even a cute bar in front of the kitchen if you want a quick bite.  We barely waited on a Saturday afternoon (maybe because of the pouring rain) but the place was full.  We got a nice table for 4 by the window (so we could enjoy aforementioned pouring rain).  We sampled the escargot and french toast for an appetizer (yes french toast for an appetizer!).  The toast was nothing out of the ordinary but still delicious.  The escargot was rich and buttery and tasted great with the crusty bread they give you to dip.  We each had the burgers which was an excellent choice!  The fatty boys I went with topped their burgers with everything the place had to offer while I just chose the goat cheese.  I could've done without SO much goat cheese but at least the portion was very generous for the price.  Great little saturday afternoon lunch and I will definitely be back!

Great staff, cozy setting, patio seating if it's warm enough, excellent food, delightful wine - what more could you ask for? Perfect neighborhood spot.\n\nUPDATE - So after going here with friends I learned Chez Maman's greatest secret - their boigah. Get it on the rarer side, with bacon and roquefort, and come with an appetite. With the Kronenberg  1664 (or as the husband orders seize soixante quatre) or one of their billion magnifique glasses (hell, bottles) of red, can't be beat. We now come minimum once a week, drink too much, hang with all of the fabulous people from the chef to the line cooks to the waiters to OF COURSE the fantastic owners, and have a blast. Just what you're looking for in your neighborhood French bistro.\n\nUPDATE -\nI just have to say, we went in here last night with my family - my Dad and Stepmom had just gotten to town, and so we came down here with them and met my brother and sister-in-law there - and boy did we have a great time. My folks have been dragged to a large chunk of SF's best of the best - from neighborhood favorites to the 5-star establishments - and I don't think they've ever raved so much about a restaurant here. They LOVED the food - the calamari, mussels, cambazola, roasted garlic, burger, frites, onion soup, goat cheese salad, crepes, etc. - LOVED the setting, and LOVED the service from Stefan. They've insisted we go back every trip and couldn't stop talking about it today at lunch. SO - if you're looking for that perfect spot to bring your family to linger over wine for a couple hours and catch up, somewhere lowkey where the food's great but it's not stuffy, and you can get there when you get there after the airport, this is the spot! It's already in our near-weekly rotation but now it's definitely a confirmed out-of-towner favorite as well!\n\nUPDATE - The folks are still talking!

We grabbed some coffee and headed back. When seated the waiter rudely told us that we had to get rid of our coffee despite telling him we were happy to buy more once we finished the ones we just got and no one else being there. To avoid trouble and because the waiter was an ass about it, we gave him the coffee and ordered. We should have left there and then. We both ordered the fish burgers and they were not cooked through. We got no service despite it being clear that we were not happy with our meals. Eventually we had to ask the manager to send out meal back to the kitchen and cook our burgers through. The whole experience was ruined and we won't be going back. Even after everything that had happened we were not even offered an apology.\n\nThe food was terrible but not as bad as the service. I will actively be recommending people avoid this place since there are so many better places in that area.", "author": "Nicholas M."}

Imagine a decorative rooster for sale in a store featuring \"Provence decor\" painted in the brightest red imaginable and that's the red,  a pure celebratory red.\n\nChez Maman's hardwood floors and bright acoustics amplify the sounds of silverware, conversation and cookery, and create a lively atmosphere.  In the midst of this din, it's easy to have a romantic conversation and feel totally private even though the next table is only 6 inches away.\n\nExpect less than perfectly attentive service, as there is typically only one waitress attempting to handle all of the tables.  She is competent, but it's a lot to manage.\n\nI have to admit that I have not been thrilled by the food at Chez Maman.   The salmon burger was overcooked and dry and served on bread that can best be described as a soft hoagie roll.  The Chicken Panini was also somewhat dry, though flavorful, and the French Onion soup was great the first time and mediocre the second time I had it.\n\nI have had a bite of the famous burger, which tasted delicious, and of the Fish and Chips.  The fish was delicately breaded and elegantly presented.\n\nSo I'll be back, but more for the atmosphere than for the food.  If I had to guess by reading the reviews, I'd have to conclude that the food can be excellent but tends to be a bit inconsistent.  For a safe bet, order the hamburger (which comes with your choice of some incredible cheeses, etc.).", "author": "Matt M."}

When I was searching for a really nice French restaurant, I came across of Gamine here in Yelp. First I want to say that all the staff members in this restaurant are genuinely wonderful. I originally reserved the small private room on the second level but when we got there, we realize that seating on the first level near the entrance has more natural light than the reserved room. So I requested to change my reservation on the spot, the manager was very accommodating and there were no fuss with the staff. They immediately set the long table for our group since we were one of the first customers who arrived early. They were so helpful with our questions and gave us really good choices of food to order.  Our top choices -  The Grilled Pork Chop with apple cider mustard sauce was very tasty. The Chicken Burger was good and moist, the Fried Calamari was very good (we had three orders), Escargot was awesome, and the Grilled Flat Iron Steak was seasoned very well. Salads were delicious as well. The food is really wonderful! The place was small but very clean. We will definitely need to go back for dinner.", "author": "Des M."}

I asked the shop's owner Brian Williams which restaurant he liked, and he immediately recommended Gamine, saying the food was very fresh, and very reasonable.   We walked down the street, checked out the menu at Gamine, then continued to look at a few other places, before returning to Gamine.   What we encountered at Gamine was a super friendly hostess, a cozy environment and one of the most fresh and satisfying meals we have had in a long time.  We started off with the Calamari which had a very crispy and flavorful crust (not greasy at all) and tender like butter not one piece was chewy.  I had the Roasted Chicken with potatoes and the accompanying sauce was just like my  mother makes; she is Swiss and is the best cook I know.  My wife had the pasta with Salmon in a creamy dill sauce.  She loved it and the salmon was perfectly prepared again melt in your mouth good.  We ordered the crepe with berries and cream which was also delicious although probably a little heavy after the amount of food we ate for dinner.  The waiter was efficient and helpful in suggesting a delicious glass of Cabernet that  went well with both our dinners.  The portions were hearty and generous not chic and sparse like you might find at other French style restaurants.  They have a  private room with a big square table that sits 8-10 that we have reserved for another time to bring our children and my wife's parents for a special dining experience.", "author": "Markus A."}

I had the Frisee and duck breast salad while my mother had Crepe Savoyard. We were both very very happy. The window seat we had was very quaint and the service was very good. The only disappointing part of our meal was the Chocolate Chaud which to the best of my knowledge and the French trained chef I work under Chocolate Chaud is traditionally very thick. The one we ordered, to be honest, tasted like hot chocolate made from a packet. Overall the experience was great and I will definitely go back next time I'm in San Fran.", "author": "Mckenzie H."}

Best eggs I've ever had, very rich. I felt like I was in a little cafe in France, super quaint and cozy ambiance. Really small place though, only take reservations for 6 ppl or more. If you are having that size group, go into the back room. It's a velvet, dark, romantic  sort of room, perfect for an intimate gathering with family or friends.", "author": "corrie c."}

It was served on a bed of leek fondue which I could have eaten straight it was so good. The Onion Soup Gratin\u00e9e was one of the best I've ever tasted. And they brought us 2 spoons without having to ask for an extra one. It was very cheesy (baked) with not too many onions in a flavorful broth. The prices were reasonable. Walked in a little before 6 pm on a Thursday night and was seated immediately. There is also seating at the bar that looks into the kitchen. Tried to eat here once before on a weekend and the wait was too long as they don't take reservations. Saw 6 young children (approx. ages 4-7) that were being accommodated. They have burgers and pastas too. There are at least 3 more entr\u00e9es on the menu that I'd like to try: Saut\u00e9ed Tilapia, Roasted Chicken and Grilled Pork Chop. If you speak French, the owner will converse with you. Loved the antique faucet in the women's restroom. The server was attentive without being stuffy or intrusive.", "author": "C V."}

We had the private table (upstairs in the back), which was a nice introduction to the restaurant. A friend had been raving about the burger for almost a year now, so I had to give it a try and it didn't disappoint. The bun was french style, but super soft and not hard or crunchy. The burger itself was on the rare side, definitely to my liking and the choices of cheese only add to the tasty experience. The fries were the real deal as well, crispy and flavorful. We also had the calamari and one of the selection of baked cheese (served with garlic), both were delicious. To finish we had the creme brulee (hard to mess that one up) and the chocolate mousse (even better than the brulee) along with a glass of dark muscat. The owner took care of us, so the service was obviously top notch and a nice surprise...", "author": "Nicolas H."}

Great little (and I mean little) restaurant tucked in at the very end of the Union St. craziness, which is nice since that way you can avoid most of the annoying Marina crowd.  Since I was there for a birthday dinner for a friend, we had the back room.  Which by the way I'm not sure many people know about on first look at Chez Maman.  Anyway, the back room is very nice with a large table for bigger groups.  However, because the bathrooms are also located in the back of the restaurant, people pass threw this semi-private room while you are dinning.  If they could come up with some other way to avoid this problem I would give them 5 stars.  So why 4 stars you ask? Well, I would give 4 stars simply because of their roasted Chicken! It was out of this world.  But I am also giving 4 stars because of the amazing service and of course the wonderful wine.  To top it all off at the end of our birthday dinner celebration they gave us complimentary champagne for the entire dinner party.  Such a nice touch! Un magnifique restaurant!", "author": "Amanda P."}

Friends had highly touted this restaurant and insisted we go there on a recent business trip to SF, overriding my desire to try Cafe des Amis down the street. Based on my (our) experience, I am trying to figure out all the rave reviews that exist for this place. Sure, the staff (including the owner) are friendly, but who cares when their incompetence level is so high? Being greeted at the door, which took a long while to be noticed, with \"Bonjour!\" at 9 PM should have tipped me off that this is not a real French bistro. The cons: limited menu, very average wine list, three pasta dishes are inexplicably the only things listed under the \"Pate\" heading on the menu (WTF?), attempting to get a glass of wine or anything else requires a lot of arm waving or shouting \"SIR, CAN WE GET YOUR ATTENTION FOR A MOMENT?\" which isn;t  justified in such a tiny restaurant,  And then of course, is the food itself, which proved almost inedible to me. I started with the \"Steak Tartare\", a bizarre interpretation that was watery and so laden with spicy horseradish (or was it mustard?) it had me running for the Zantac almost immediately - zero flavor to the beef, only the heat from the horseradish. What happened to the traditional capers, parsley, and shallots used with prudence? To it's credit, it did come topped with a small raw quail egg. Then the second courses, First, the escargot, which consisted of six tiny morsels - tender enough, but sitting in a very spicy butter which must have been doused with tablespoons of white or cayenne pepper and adding more heartburn to my already churning stomach. Perhaps the \"French\" chefs visible in the kitchen, (Ramon, Juan, and Jorge?) were trying to impart some good ol' south-of-the border heat into classic bistro fare? The other dish, the arugula and goat cheese salad was flavorful enough but there was far too much arugula itself, and it was compressed into a cake-like mass complete with a myriad of tough stems. My friends both had one of the three mussel dishes offered, and seemed to be fine with their choices, although the owner suggested an overbearing California cabernet sauvignon to go with the mussels - a truly incomprehensible suggestion. All in all, I would never suggest this place to anyone and can only warn you that this is one strange place.", "author": "Richard H."}

The owner was French and so was our waiter, but the decor and the food were missing that certain je ne sais pas! I had the green salad with poached pears. Too much leaf and too little pears. Next I had steak-frites with a bernaise sauce. You can't go wrong thought I. This after all is the classic French bistro meal. It was not wrong but it was not right either. Just nothing special there. But what really sealed the deal for me was the dessert. I ordered the Tarte Tatine. I asked for vanilla bean ice cream on the side but they don't have a freezer so no ice-cream. The TT was limp and tasteless and probably the worst TT I've had anywhere in the world and I doubt the ice-cream would have salvaged it for me.  So French yes, but memorable no. I'll try somewhere else next time.", "author": "AntonEgo C."}

An hour later, the restaurant was filled and there was a birthday party in their private room.  We ordered our dinners and we started with some french bread which appeared to be day old.  I was hoping that this would not be an indication of what the dinner would be like.  That was the last glitch in the meal.  My wife and I split a salad of Arugula and Goat cheese and it was excellent.  The Goat cheese was outstanding, the dressing very good and it was a generous portion, easily enough for two.  I had Grilled lamb loin with a potato gratine and it was outstanding--cooked perfectly, flavored very well and a good portion.  My wife had the salmon and it was fresh, tasty and cooked to perfection.  This was a wonderful dinner.

Very welcoming staff and the food was just right. The french fries were actually some of the best I've had anywhere- light as air, crispy, oil-free and accompanied by a delicious aioli. The duck confit salad and the goat cheese salad were both perfectly fresh with nice dressings. The escargot were hot and buttery-garlicky, as they should be. The mousse au chocolat was light and tasted fresh.

Appetizers were tres bien:  baked cambazola accompanied with a head of roasted garlic as well as beets & goat cheese. Everyone enjoyed both dishes as we devoured it with baguette. Entrees didn't disappoint either: the rack of lamb, the pork chop, the salmon and the camembert ravioli all were done beautifully, everything was well seasoned. Seemed to be the right amount of food as well. The waitress recommended a great bottle of French red wine. We split a berry crepe for desert between the four of us. Everyone was stuffed and happy. The bill came out to 40 bucks per person with tip which seemed fair for the amount of good quality food. I would definitely go back in a heartbeat. This may just become a Sunday evening tradition!
