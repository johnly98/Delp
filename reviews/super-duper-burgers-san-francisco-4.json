I became vegan in a small beach town in FL that was more famous for producing world champion surfers than innovative veggie burgers.\n\nFast forward many years on & I am now living in the SF Bay Area. I was already a fan of Super Duper Burgers after visiting their branch in Berkeley so found a similar experience here in the Castro.\n\nI recently went to Super Duper Burgers in the Castro. They have two locations in the East Bay & six locations in San Francisco along w/ a dozen locations in the SF Bay Area. The location in the Castro is a short walk from the Church St MUNI for those w/ the car-free lifestyle like myself.\n\nThere motto is \"Fast Food Burgers, Slow Food Value\". They use artisanal buns, homemade pickles, organic, & 100 percent compostable packaging. \n\nThe staff was helpful to help me navigate the vegan options on the veg-friendly menu. Enjoyed the veggie burger, fries, & homemade pickles. Solid meal that was satisfying on the surprisingly sustainable eco-conscious menu.\n\nI pretty much ordered everything that was vegan. My Veggie Burger was an organic patty w/ hummus, cucumbers & omit the super sauce to customize it vegan. It comes w/ lettuce, tomato, & red onions. Be sure to also ask for grilled onions, pickles, & jalape\u00f1o peppers if you are okay w/ spicy. I also had them add avocado & roasted portobello. The avocado was a small portion yet still enjoyed the veggie burger. Kudos for using quality ingredients!\n\nI paired the veggie burger w/ french fries & loved the homemade pickles as they are quite alright. I like that they use Sir Kensington's ketchup & mustard which is quite alright. \n\nThey do have organic straus shakes along w/ soft serve yet it would be nice to have a vegan option.\n\nI have had better veggie burgers before yet this one was solid. I appreciate the care to use quality ingredients along w/ being eco-conscious. \n\nAll in all a positive experience here & look forward to returning.", "author": "Shane S."}

Oh, and a side of fries of course. My favorite part about coming to Super Duper is THEIR KETCHUP!!! It is soooo good.

One burger, we added roasted portbello mushrooms and the other an egg. \n\nOur first problem was the cup they gave us for the drink. It was dirty and had scraps of food attached to it. Yuck? Gross? Do the cups not get washed?\n\nOur second problem, we got the burgers and the one with portbello mushrooms didn't have any. They showed us it was under the patties at the bottom of the burger and there were only a few slices so they gave us some \"extras\". Why am I paying an extra $1.25 for 2-3 slices of portbello mushrooms??? \n\nThen when we finally got settled to eat the burgers, it was just disappointing. It tasted healthy but it's not...wait no bland would be the better word for it? It just didn't give you the taste or satisfaction of a burger. I much rather prefer a Mcdonalds burger over this.

And we all know how firsts aren't always the best experiences... \n\nSo, after multiple visits to the Castro location (which is the OG location that started it all BTW) I'm officially a fan. I think it may be because everything in the Castro is just \"happier\"! That was my attempt at being pretty and witty and... well you know the song.\n\nIndeed their burgers taste great because they use fresh ingredients from local suppliers and sources. Their beef comes from humanely raised cows that are fed a vegetarian diet, the buns are made by a local artisan SF baker, and the cream for their ice cream comes from a farm in Tomales Bay.\n\nDue to these fresh sources, their burgers are not cheap... And one of their slogans is that a burger should not cost $3. Mostly agree, with the notable exception of that place with no heat lamps...\n\nTheir Mini Burger with cheese, a burger with a 4-ounce patty, costs $6 and their Super Burger (two patties) with cheese will set you back $8.50. However, I don't mind paying more because I see nothing wrong with paying extra for quality. There's a reason that if people had the budget, they would choose a Lexus over a Kia anyday. \n\nThe regular fries ($2.75) are good, but I recommend splurging 50 cents more for the garlic cheddar fries. Another car analogy here... why settle for the LX when the EX comes with leather seats? You can thank me later. \n\nBut the real reason I keep coming back to Super Duper is that I'm addicted to their free pickles. Seriously, these pickles are what makes Super Duper, super duper and duper super. The free pickles are like getting AWD for no added cost... like a Subaru. Score!\n\nI'm rounding up and giving them 5 stars because they are planning to open 2 new locations in the East Bay in Concord and Berkeley. \n\n* This flagship location is in the process of super-duper-sizing because they are taking over the former Check Cashing store next door.", "author": "Richard K."}

For one, this is a lot of food for one. The burger comes with two juicy patties stuffed with tomatoes, lettuce, red onions, jalapenos, grilled onions, and their special sauce! Just a warning that this burger is super greasy --but hey! The best type of foods are the heart-clogging ones, yum! On top of that, the garlic fries here are out of this world.

They have a nice setup where you order and pay for your food, and then you are given a buzzer and can find a seat and wait until your order is done without having to line up and stand at the counter to wait for your food. The service was pretty fast as well.\n\nI ordered the following:\nMini burger (one 4oz patty, $5.50): I decided to go with the mini burger because I didn't think I was hungry enough for the super burger, which has two parties instead of one. I'm glad that I did, because the mini burger was pretty much the size of a standard burger (despite the misleading name). You can add on a bunch of toppings for free (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, grilled onions, jalape\u00f1o peppers), but cheese, bacon, avocado, mushrooms, and eggs cost extra. The burger itself was quite good, although the meat was packed more loosely than other burgers that I have had. I like their special sauce and the grilled onions added a nice texture and flavor to the rest of the toppings.\nGarlic fries ($3.25) with 3 dips ($1.50, comes with super sauce, mayo, and chipotle): the garlic fries were just okay, in my opinion. The garlic flavor was really strong and pretty overwhelming, and my breath smelled like garlic for hours afterwards. The garlic flavor is so strong that any additional dipping sauce is overpowered and too much. I actually felt pretty heavy and greasy after eating this.\nStrawberry shake ($5.75): the shake was very good! Super creamy and rich, and with a strong strawberry flavor. I really liked the tall glass that it was served in, which added presentation points.\n\nOverall this was a decent burger place, but wasn't mind-blowing.", "author": "Amy C."}

I found this place just walking around the city so decided to stop by. \n\nSimplicity at its finest. Nothing over the top seasoned or special but a simple burger makes a good burger to me. All burgers are cooked medium so it tends to make the burger juicer and a little messy (I never complain about a messy burger). I ended up getting the super burger, which is 2 4oz patties and you have many options to dress your burger how you want to. I do recommend trying their super sauce, it is what they are known for and I think it tops the burger off. Also their shakes are really good and I did see several people just coming for the shakes.", "author": "William W."}

More like greasy and overcooked. \n\nOn the menu wall there is a misleading sign that reads \"our burgers are cooked medium and are very juicy... could be messy business!!\" This sign should really read \"our burgers are well done and soaked in grease... will be messy business!!\"\n\nThat's right, the burgers are soaked in grease, not juice, and there's a big difference. That liquid film you see on your patty, buns, plate, and all else is not the juices from the meat itself, the patty is way too thin and overcooked for that to be the case. No, this liquid is from the grill/place the meat is being cooked. It is either due to a large amount of oil being used, the chef deciding to pour oil on top of it while it is cooking for some odd reason, or, more likely, the stove/grill is not cleaned.\n\nSo my burger came dripping wet in grease that clearly was not juice from the meat, and the patty itself was overcooked as well. It was well done, not medium. Honestly, if a chef at a burger joint doesn't know how to cook a medium burger he should get another job. This isn't rocket science. \n\nThe fries were good.

After two recent visits, I am pleased to report that this is not the same Super Duper Burgers I have avoided all these years! The food and customer service has greatly improved with friendly staff and cooks that actually put some effort into the food. The new expansion is great and offers ample seating in a bright clean space with large windows through which patrons can enjoy the sights of the Castro District. On a recent visit, Luigi was the only counter staff and a master of multitasking answering phones as well as serving walk-in customers. He was welcoming, polite, and very efficient. I ordered a double burger combo with soda, fries and enjoyed every bite, especially the fries! They still offer what's best described as a 'loose meat' burger which gives it a homemade feel. Historically, the burgers were haphazardly prepared and heavily salted causing me to throw the whole thing in the trash which thankfully, was not the case during my last two visits. Similarly, I found the fries to be dry and inconsistently prepared in the past but thankfully, that too was no longer the case. However, I was a little bummed that there were only a few unappealing pickles floating in a container on the condiment counter which clearly needed to be replenished and kept me from including them with my meal. My lingering complaint is the floor in the original section of the restaurant that chronically looks dirty. Perhaps it's the choice of tiles or something else but I've always found it to be unwelcoming. For my money, the best Super Duper Burgers has been the one by the Metreon. The staff have been consistently efficient, the space clean even though it is often inundated with customers, and the quality of food excellent. Thankfully, with all of the upgrades at the Castro location, I no longer have to travel downtown to enjoy a great burger in a comfortable environment!", "author": "Thatwasme T."}

You probably know what you should get: burgers and fries. \n\nThe burger was nicely presented and fair to the palate. Be careful of how many patties you want: mini burger is one patty, and super burger is two patties. Customize your toppings are be the best by getting everything.\nWe ordered garlic fries. Fries are topped with garlic and shredded cheese. I wish the fries were actually tossed with the garlic for better flavor and taste. \n\nBig plus: the pickles!

We went around 5pm on a Sunday after a Giants Baseball game and I'm not sure if it was busy because of that or maybe the extremely small location made it seem like everyone was sitting on top of each other. We luckily ordered within two minutes of walking in and decided on the Super Burger and Mini burger with a side of garlic fries. There was little to no seating so we had to sit next to a stranger in an extremely close proximity. I mean, my boyfriends elbows were almost touching the man next to him. The food came out very fast for how busy they were so in that aspect I was impressed. The burger overall was decent but in my opinion a little too soggy/messy for me. The garlic fries were amazing and made me have a change of heart about this place but the homemade pickles they are so proud of.... can't say the same.

I've been to Super Duper tons of times to both the downtown and Marina locations but service at the Castro location could definitely use some improvement. I was in there this afternoon for a burger and fries and was served cold, gross, greasy garlic fries. I brought my fries to the tall, blonde woman that was working the front counter and before I even ask, she sees me & the fries and barks \"What is it you want?!?\" I politely asked if there was any way I could get a fresh thing of fries since they were really cold and greasy. She rolls her eyes, takes them from me, shouts at the men in the back to get me a new order. She stands there looking extremely annoyed while we wait and a minute later just puts the new tray down in front of me. No \"sorry about that\" or even \"here you go\". Terrible customer service!!! When I get back to my seat, I realize they'd totally botched my burger order as well (sauce on a no sauce order, charged me for bacon but there was none on there). After the \"warm and helpful\" tone they'd had with me before at the front though, I wasn't about to make a peep and kicked myself for not noticing from the get go.

It made me smile. \"Hey guys, lets go to Super Duper Burgers!\" is just kind of fun.\n2. I saw a previous location in the financial district at lunch time, and saw a big ol' line out the door and down the street. Now that's a good sign. \n\nI played parking meter roulette when coming to this Super Duper. I was happy to find no line, and ordered a standard favorite burger of mine, double meat, double cheese (here a Super Burger) with bacon and grilled onions. I was also able to get garlic fries, which in my book are an insta-order any time I see it on a menu. \n\nI was so stoked to see my order come out quickly, and be MASSIVE. The patties were bigger than I expected, cheese not junky american grade, onions freshly grilled (and red), and finally bacon crispy. The patties were also still pink, so any fast burger that gives me a medium/medium rare patty already gets a leg up. \n\nEating the burger was defiantly great. While it was not an earth-shattering burger, considering the price, and speed, it is quite hard to beat. Quality meat and ingredients with friendly fast service goes a long way. The garlic fries were super tasty, and made me feel guilty of whoever I was going to sit next to on the impending plane ride. I wish there was some minced garlic on them and not just oil, but that's just being picky now. \n\nI even oppted for a dipped cone afterwards. The soft serve was nothing special, but the dark chocolate dip was for sure above average. \n\nAll in all, no parking ticket, a great last SF meal, and a place I would be happy to take friends back to next time I visit the bay.", "author": "Joey T."}

I received a burger with everything on it (including onions and sauce) and looked on my receipt and I guess the cashier didn't enter in my lettuce and tomato only request. Minus 1 star for me. I had to pick out the onions and luckily I was okay with the sauce so I just didn't bother with asking for another one. The burger itself was good. Very greasy but good. I could do without the sauce though which seems like some mayo sauce. The garlic fries were good but they look like they're sweating oil which I don't personally like. I liked the texture of them though! \n\nMy boyfriend's take: He got the regular burger with everything on it and jalape\u00f1o peppers.

The clean, fast, and friendly environment makes the extra Muni ride it takes to get there instead of the downtown Market Street location totally worth it! \nObviously Super Duper burgers, fries, and shakes are unparalleled by any other burger spots in the city so this review isn't exactly for the food quality. I've thoroughly enjoyed the Super Burger with everything on it and the garlic fries every time I've ordered it. I had it yesterday and am already craving it again. This review is for the awesome atmosphere at this location. \nFirstly, they renovated and expanded their space to better accommodate the large crowd this location draws. The seating area is always spotless and maintained much nicer that you would expect of a \"fast food\" joint. I've never had to wait around for someone to clean a table as I have in other locations. \nSecondly, they are always speedy and accurate with my order. Always. Sometimes I order with no bun, sometimes with an egg and no cheese, sometimes with everything but sauce. And they get it right every time. No having to bring my tray of food back for them to correct the order. Greatly appreciated! \nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, this location has the friendliest staff around. Every time I go, there is an amazing cashier, Madalena I think is her name (spelling might be off,) that perfectly embodies GREAT customer service. She just knows her stuff and always has a smile on her face while still maintaining an efficient ordering experience. I think she is Brazilian or something because she also has a cute accent.

I enjoy Burgermeister, have indulged in Barneys, tasted the Umami, but no one makes a juicy, moist (yes, MOIST), and savory burger like Super Duper.\n\nI tend to get their 4-cheese mini-burger. The Castro location is one of the only locations in the city that advertises it. You can ask for it at their other locations, but it has to spelled out. The 4-cheese just has all the cheeses on their menu: Cheddar, White Cheddar, Parmesan, Gorgonzola. I tend to go with the mini due to the amazing bomb this already is with the cheese. Plus, their regular burger size is a hungry person size, so unless you're starving, the mini is the way to go.\n\nThe Castro location is great, but it does get a bit crowded. You may need to go during off-hours to enjoy a seat, but the staff is always awesome.", "author": "Steve R."}

Think spiked milkshakes, organic ice cream, dirty fries and free huge ass housemade pickles. \n\nThe outside of Super Duper kinda reminded me of Shake Shack in NY. The decor and vibe is very similar. But of course, pricing here at Super Duper are unbeatable! Just like Habit Burger.\n\nI had the mini combo meal meaning I had a regular 4oz patty burger with all the fixins, some garlic fries and a drank (which I just got my usual water). When our food came out, I was pretty astonished at how neat everything looked. Not messy, not greasy. Garlic fries were bomb and plentiful. My burger was quite juicy and surprisingly, even though I cant stand sesame buns, this one was pretty amazing. Wasn't soggy from all the sauce inside the burger, yet was still soft and airy.\n\nI also had a sip of the SBBF's double chocolate milkshake. It was bomb dot com right thurr.\n\nThe place was uber packed on a Saturday afternoon, but why wouldn't it be? Burgers and ice cream in the city for a cheap price? Hellz yeah! I'd be there every weekend. \n\nThere are a few other locations within SF. I'm glad we chose the Castro location. It's a great spot to gay-people watch.

First of all to make a great burger you need great meat and bread and Super Duper has both. The meat is flavorful and juicy and comes in 2 4oz patties. You can also add bacon,eggs, and avacado in addition to the standard lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and jalape\u00f1os.  On the side pickles are free and plentiful.  But the garlic fries covered with aged white cheddar is a must. As for beverages kids and adults alike can be happy with soda, beer, wine,,and delicious shakes.

Super Duper is a nice twist on the traditional fast food burger joint. They serve fast food style burgers, fries and shakes but with great quality and ingredients. They have super burgers (8 oz.) and mini burgers (4 oz.). Regular fries, garlic fries, and fries served with house dips. I LOVE it when a restaurant creates their own house sauces, it just shows that they really care about the details. Not only does this place serve burgers but they also serve chicken sandwiches and have vegetarian options.\n\nI ordered the Mini Burger with everything on it (Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Super Sauce, Jalapeno Peppers, Grilled Onions, Pickles) and the French Fries + 3 Dips (Super Sauce/Homemade Mayo/Chipotle). The burger was probably one of the juiciest burgers I've had. The dipping sauces that came with the fries were also very tasty, my favorite being the Chipotle. Kudos to the owner for going with 100% compostable packaging, saving the environment one order at a time.

They claim that they use organic beef and ours were cooked perfectly. It was tender and juicy goodness. The veggies might not matter to people, but the lettuce on ours were fresh and crisp. \nTo come and think about it.. There is actually nothing special about this burger.. Pretty basic ingredients plus the super sauce.

Never again. The burger was awful. I didn't ask for lettuce or onions, so they gave me a burger with cheese and nothing else. They didn't even include condiments. And the burger was dry. I usually have to use many napkins while eating at the restaurants, so i very surprised to find a dry burger. I emailed Super Duper about this experience, along with Doordash, and got radio silence on both ends. I won't be back.", "author": "J B."}

However, seeing as it was hot yesterday, and they must have been slammed, I don't feel right subtracting a star.

I'm glad that disclaimer exists because they weren't kidding. The burgers are insanely greasy and oily due to the melted cheese. Basically from the start, keep the burger wrapped in the paper, because, from an engineering standpoint, they aren't soundly constructed.\n\nThat being said, the flavor of the burger was absolutely delicious. All elements, so long as they're wrapped in wax paper and surrounded by extra napkins, come together in a perfectly tasty tapestry of meet and veg. \n\nWhat sent this place over the top though was the shake. I haven't had an authentic malted shake in a while and this one was perfect addition to this burger on a rare 90 degree San Francisco day. \n\nThe menu is a simple process of how many patties and what you want on it. Do you want fries? How about a drink. Basically a little simpler than In and Out. \n\nThe only reason its not a five star review is that from the first bite of the burger, discharge landed on my pants and I've not been able to get the stain out.

Those garlic fries everyone raves about?  Yeah, not a fan. But that is simply because   I prefer my garlic cooked. Generally speaking, garlic fries from anywhere are loaded up with nearly raw garlic, which just does not taste good to me.  But that is a personal preference. \nIf you're a fan of gobs of raw garlic, these fries are for you. I got the mini (that's a single burger by any other standards) with cheese & an egg. I was hoping for a runny yolk but didn't get it, which means I could have done without it. \nThe homemade pickles are ok. I prefer my pickles with more kick, so that didn't go as planned either. \nAnd finally, I wanted a spiked chocolate shake, but we orders to go and you can't take alcohol outside in SF.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-11-04", "description": "I have never had more fun having my food order completely butchered and blown. My cousin and I laughed for days afterwards. We laughed about this fuckery all the way home. \n\nMy cousin and I were actually on our way to Orphan Andys as we were craving food and milkshakes. On our way we happened upon Super Duper, took a look, and decided to try something new. \n\nOk so we both ordered 4 oz. burgers with our own specifications, then shakes, hers a child, mine NOT, and some fries to share. The order comes up and I realize there are two child shakes on our tray. I walk back to counter and let them know, they take back the child shake and make a regular sized one. Later I realize the milkshake was probably the wrong flavor, long story, but I think so too.\nThen I check out my burger. *sigh* All I wanted was lettuce, tomato and pickle. What's in my burger? Mayo (bleh), onions and tomato. I decide I can pull out onions, wipe off mayo, but did want my lettuce. I ask for it, get the tiniest piece, then go start to eat. I bite into my burger and it is pink. Not medium pink, medium rare pink. My cousins was a nice pink, mine was moo'ing pink. Not to mention there was a piece of, uhhh, I don't honestly know what it was, looked like an old piece of bacon, but my cousin and I think it was an old piece of burned egg. It was stuck to the side of my burger. Gross. I decided I can't eat it, let them know, and take their offer of making a new one. The cashier and I CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY go over my order, I say lettuce and tomato only. Why no pickles? Well I realized that they have a jar of their home made pickles next to the condiments. With all the issues that we had already, I didn't even BOTHER asking why pickles weren't on the original burger. They're on the menu as a topping option, and even if they are only at the condiment table, no one told me, not to mention they are spear shaped so they don't even go into a burger. Whatever. \n\nSo I make my remake order simple, tomato and lettuce. He's nice, apologizes, takes order, says he'll bring it to my table. As I wait we just laugh, it's crazy how much has gone wrong with such a simple order. Even my cousins burger didn't have lettuce, which she had order, but she just let it go. Ok so my burger arrives and it smells good, has no mayo, no pieces of egg, does have it's tomato, but has no lettuce. *we laugh* Ok look I don't ask for much on my damn burger, but lettuce is one that I absolutely want on it. I go up and ask, laughing because either I laugh at this lunacy, or I am going to flip the fuck out, this food isn't cheap for them to be blowing it this much. I ask for the lettuce and learn they ARE OUT OF LETTUCE. Were they hoping I just wouldn't notice?? OOOHH and my new burger had TWO PATTIES! LOLOL was that my substitute to lettuce?? I mean wtf, I don't want a double burger, I had fries, a shake, I can't eat that. I had to take a patty out and it got thrown away. So I go sit down and just laugh and laugh and laugh because this is fucking ridiculous. WHY WOULDN'T ANYONE TELL ME!? \n\nI just feel like everyone dropped the ball all over the place, the kitchen as well as the FOH. Kitchen wasn't paying attention to their shit, cashiers weren't communicating to me or kitchen, it was a mess. Did I mention another customer was complaining about something right before me? I couldn't hear all of it but my cousin had the better view and said customer looked very unhappy and I heard the cashier say \"refund right away\" at one point. So it was a bad night for them. Unfortunately I doubt I'll come back. I mean it was just too terrible yet hilarious for me. I should have just went to Orphan Andys.", "author": "Reyna O."}

With so many locations throughout the city, there's really no excuse. Super Duper perfects the balance of quick service yet still maintaining somewhat of a sit-down restaurant feel. \n\nI can't stress how juicy and flavorful the burgers are. THEY'RE SO GOOD. The juice spills out with each bite you take, and it becomes hard to stop the juice from dripping down your arm. But at the end of the day, guess what? You don't care!!! All you can think about is the happiness and deliciousness you get from each bite. The fries here are also on point btw.\n\nI was never really a fan of pickles until recently...but honestly, I credit Super Duper for my sudden love for pickles. The pickles here are homemade, and best of all...wait for it....THEY'RE UNLIMITED. So yes, even for you people who hate pickles. I beg you to at least try the ones here because they'll be unlike any other pickles you've had.\n\nOne last thing that I love about Super Duper? Their soft serve. Mmmmmmm. Few places have both great burgers AND great soft serve. A cone of soft serve ice cream (when dipped in chocolate, even better) is the perfect way to end a great meal.\n\nThis place lives up to its name. Cheesy? Maybe.

It is easily one of the best chicken sandwiches around -- but be sure to stock up on napkins, because it's messy. Tasty, perfectly cooked chicken, lettuce, tomato and melty jack on toasted ciabatta might be good on its own, but the chipotle aioli in which the sandwich is smothered is what really makes it stand out; it adds so much flavor, and it's the perfect balance of sweetness and spice.

I get the super burger while adding on bacon and an egg with a side a french fries. The special sauce along with the patties make the burger extremely flavorful. The service is quick and they usually have your order ready within minutes. And what better way to end your meal after inhaling a fatty, juicy burger by getting some ice cream. \n\nThe only downside is that there are no drive thru! All the super duper locations in San Francisco present challenges when trying to find parking. However it's all worth it when you get your hands on one of these bad boys. Definitely recommend going here and I hope super duper rapidly grows their locations so they are more accessible.", "author": "Vincent C."}

We came in a little before the noon lunch crowd and it wasn't that packed yet, but people started to trickle in around 12:30. \n\nI decided on the chicken sandwich with chipotle aioli and added avocado and an organic egg for $1 each. Other toppings for $1 are: grilled peppers, roasted portobello, and cambozola blue cheese. Lettuce, tomato, red onions, super sauce, jalape\u00f1o peppers, grilled onions, and pickles are free. \n\nThe bf settled on an 8 oz \"Super Burger\" with $0.50 for cheese and a $1 for bacon added. He had \"Everything On It.\" Then we also ordered garlic fries for $2.75. He got a regular fountain soda for $2 and I had a \"Super Shake\" of chocolate and fresh strawberries for $5.75. Our total came to about $30. It was pretty pricey for fast food, but they obviously use organic and fresh ingredients so it's worth the price.\n\nThe chicken breast they use is \"100% free range\" and that's a plus. You can taste the difference. The bread was a sort of ciabatta bread and it was really good. The chipotle aioli was very tasty and the lettuce, tomato, and avocado were very fresh. The organic egg went perfect with everything even though it was messy. \n\nThe bf thought his burger was really really good. Slightly better than a burger at Pearl's. He liked the garlic fries, but I didn't care for them. There was more parmesan cheese than fresh garlic. Also, I was disappointed with my shake. I should've just had a regular chocolate shake because the strawberries didn't really add much to it. The bf thought their homemade pickles were alright. They weren't crunchy like he thought they'd be. \n\nOverall, great food and a good first time experience. The ambiance is ok. But, beware of the flies hovering around. I'd suggest skipping on getting two drinks, if you don't mind sharing with your significant other to cut costs because there are free refills for the fountain sodas. The chocolate and strawberries milkshake wasn't worth it. Everything else mentioned was.", "author": "Fallon P."}

They even have homemade pickles that are deliciously brined and crunchy, now if only they would monopolize on the whole artisinal sauce market. :P\n\nAlthough it is a chain, Super Duper offers much better value than other burgers located in SF that cost a premium to enjoy, especially when they are listed very bare-bones minimally on the menu (usually a patty, buns, and onions and lettuce), and all the fixings are only available as an additional request which can easily become absurd.", "author": "Ty T."}

They especially love burgers and we were in the area so I took them to Super Duper. \n\nI ordered the Philly Jalape\u00f1o burger (I saw it described on a list when I got to the register) and an order of garlic fries. Came out to be a little less than $10. Still kinda pricey butttt I liked my order. My friends got their own custom mini burgers.\n\nI had no idea that Super Duper had their own type of burgers so I was stoked when I saw the Philly Jalape\u00f1o burger. Sometimes, you just don't want to think about what kind of combo you want, you know?\n\nPhilly Jalape\u00f1o burger (pepperjack cheese, jalape\u00f1os, roasted red peppers, other things I don't remember) was delicious. There was nothing about it that I didn't like and for this reason, I believe that it was worth the price. \n\nThe garlic fries are delicious. I've had them before and each time I've ordered them, I've enjoyed them. Super Duper makes their fries skinny which I enjoy because they're the crispy type and not the fat mashed potato type that you get from steak fries. This works especially well with the garlic cheese topping. I usually have a good amount of control when I eat but I found myself munching on these garlic fries like my life depended on it.\n\nMy friends really enjoyed their food as well, which I am happy about.

They offered to make us another order free of charge which was cool but... Like I said.. The chefs go ham on the oil here. My bf's burger was so oily it fell apart quickly. I could tell he did not like it after his first bite. He ordered a super duper burger with a sunny side up egg, we thought the egg was the culprit to his distaste but it wasn't because my burger was super oily as well. I didn't even add an egg.

The rendezvous was well planned and had the approval of all parents involved. We had a very nice time while wandering around Chinatown and I was impressed on how well these young adults had chosen their friends. \n\nAfter we all parted ways, it was time to walk back to BART and head home. We were both a little hungry and I was also in the mood for a beer and a chance to sit and relax. As we walked down Kearny and into the Financial District, I noticed that the choices were somewhat limited as fewer places are open at the end of the workday. Those that were, didn't seem to fit well for both a Dad and his Teenage Son. Or as my Kid clearly stated as we considered one local pub, \"I Don't Belong Here\".  However, as we arrived on Market Street, I noticed the Super Duper sign at a distance, and knew that this place would make both of us happy. \n\nSuper Duper also has a comfortable retro charm, a faux Midwest feel, friendly service, and uses all the right sustainable and organic buzzwords. However, Yupscale Burger places can by a tad pricey (at least by this Iowan's Standards). The Kid had a double cheeseburger, while I had a single, and we shared an order of garlic fries. After my beer and his milkshake, the bill came to about $26. That's significantly above the cost of a McDonald's value meal, but the food was really really good. I'm sure that if we're in the neighborhood again, we'll stop by.", "author": "Eric B."}

One girl I saw a few days ago working at a popular North Beach bakery dining at the somewhat newest burger joint with her boyfriend. \"Damn, that was disappointing to see that she has a man!\"\n\nWith the World Cup tournament in progress and the nice warm weather around the city, the burger joint was obviously packed during noon time. With long lines and many people dining there in the somewhat large dining area, eating in and stuffing the burger in my face would be near impossible. \n\nLooking at the huge menu posted on the wall, all burgers are made from the highest quality Niman Ranch Beef. Not much of a menu, but just burgers, chicken and even a vegan option for your customized sandwiches. There are no combo deals here and every item(s) are sold separately. So I ordered the Super Burger. And for an affordable $4.75, the burger patty is made with the high-end meat and comes with melted Cheddar Cheese and the usual condiment. I also got a side of Cheesy Garlic Fries for another $3.00. And the restaurant has beer on tap with a choice of five beers, in which I took the Racer-5 IPA for $5.00 in a tall 22oz glass. The burger was very greasy but tasty and the fries were loaded with garlic.

Had been to Roam recently as well, and this place was SO much better ,(and quite a bit cheaper.)\n\nI opted for the grilled chicken, but did steal a few bites of my hubby's burger. Both were juicy and delicious. Grilled chicken sandwiches are often dry and bit bland, but this was fantastic. Very flavorful, very moist, completely satisfying. We shared an order of fries, which were good but not great. If i ordered them again, I would ask for them extra crispy.\n\nI don't know how this compares to places like Five Guys or In 'N'Out, have never been to either, (nor will I.)

In a foodie town like San Francisco, the burger spectrum can run the gamut from Pearl's and Mo's on the bargain end to the likes of Slow Club and Zuni Cafe on the other. In-N-Out and Nation's would be in a parallel universe covered in spandex and jug wine. Super Duper would be a lost asteroid hovering over a black hole. And when is Duper ever not Super? Perhaps Mediocre Duper would be more accurate. \n\nI was gobsmacked to find out that this place is owned by the same people who brought us Starbelly, Beretta and Delarosa. I don't see the family resemblance. This is a retro-modern place that's probably closest to Taylor's Refresher (or Gott's Roadside, whatever) in flavor and decor, even the same brushed aluminum trays. The service is on the pedestrian side with the young servers making their personal ennui evident to the customers around them. The menu is extremely limited with three burgers to choose from in single and double variations, chicken and veggie options, some fries, some shakes some desserts. The end. \n\nI went nuts and tried the $6.75 Super Duper Double. Meh. It was swaddled in butcher paper like a Taylor's burger, and the Niman beef had a strangely mealy consistency. Jamie W. was more modest and ordered the $4.75 Super Duper Single, and that's when I realized that the meat patty itself was quite flat and on the paltry side. The less-than-fresh fries were equally disappointing with the $3 Garlic Fries way too moist with the garlic mix globbed onto the already flimsy shoestring potatoes (see photos). There's also an obscure jar of pickles next to the condiments. I'd avoid them unless you like the taste of really sour pickles. Refills are free though. \n\nFOOD - 2 stars...decidedly mediocre burgers and fries will only satisfy those who couldn't wait for the F-Line to get to In-N-Out \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...retro-hip fast food in need of a McDonald's happy meal \nSERVICE - 2 stars...too young to care (...I'll always remember the look of indifference on the server's face when I picked up our burgers) \nTOTAL - 2 stars...disappointing...I might as well be ignored at Slider's for the same price", "author": "Ed U."}

The service could be improved, but I'm certainly not going to chastise them on that since they've only been open for one week.  I had a relatively early lunch around 2:30 PM and noticed this place is already very popular.\n\nAfter a quick glance at the simple menu posted on the front door I walked in and headed straight to the cashier station where I ordered a Double Cheeseburger, a plain Fries and a fountain soda for ten bucks and change.  The burgers are cooked to order so do expect a bit of a wait.  While waiting I noticed that the restaurant uses mostly sustainable / compostable components.  For that simple fact I don't mind paying a little bit more.\n\nIf you're dining in the food is served on cool, lightweight aluminum trays lined with unbleached paper.  There is a mason jar filled with homemade pickles at the condiment / napkin station that you can help yourself to.  Metal tongs are provided so you don't have to dig your fingers into the jar.  I love pickles, and these were very good.  I didn't have anywhere to put my pickle so I put it on top of my big order of fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hXeusGZQvH5oMxaR6XgYwA?select=xDGTPePW59mlBF3bAz9xaw).  The pickles were very crunchy and not very salty.  I should have had more.  \n\nMy fries weren't cooked to order.  In fact I got a mix of limp, chewy, stale fries mixed in with some fresh, crispy, meaty fries.  The fries are natural, skin-on shoestrings that definitely taste better fresh than stale.  You probably already know that however.\n\nI loved the burger.  My Double Cheeseburger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hXeusGZQvH5oMxaR6XgYwA?select=h5WDOeQrDK9mnW6VF9L_aQ) was delicious.  The burgers here are fairly small in size but definitely big on taste.  The super soft bun was moistened with a bit of the Super Duper Secret Sauce which looked like mayonnaise but tasted more inspiring than just plain mayonnaise.  There's lots of cheese on top and in between the burger patties.  Lactards, bring your Lactaid!  The juicy beef patties are cooked medium and tasted like high quality beef.

We were quickly greeted by the man behind the cashier, but we took a couple minutes to peruse the menu.  We decided on:\n\n-Chicken sandwich ($6.50) for me: the chicken sandwich was okay.  The chicken was a thin, even piece that spanned most of the length of the bread and sandwich was doused in a chipotle aioli sauce.  The sauce was leaking out from the a hole in my bun and became quite messy.  The bread is a little bit chewy, like ciabatta, and was okay.  Overall, I'd probably order a burger instead of this, if I make another visit.\n\n-Super burger ($6.50) with cheese ($0.50) for him: my friend devoured his burger; I'm assuming he enjoyed it.\n\n-Garlic fries ($2.75) to share:  the fries are a bit on the crispy side and topped with a fair amount of shredded cheese.  I wish it were a little bit garlic-y-er, though.  Still, the portion size was just right to share between the two of us.  We actually had some fries left over.\n\n-Organic iced tea ($2.25) for me:  Very average, it was fine.\n\n-Fountain drink ($2) for him: Free refills, they have coke zero too.\n\n-Homemade pickles (free): These can be found at the condiment/utensils station.  I don't really like pickles, but I gave them a try and they tasted fine.  My friend was really excited to try out the pickles after hearing so much about them- he said they taste like any other pickles.\n\nOverall, the food is decent.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-20", "description": "As a Castro local, Super Duper is definitely one of my regular food joints (I come here at least once a month). This place is sure to satisfy any burger craving!\n\nThe menu is fairly simple, so I pretty much always order the same things:\n\nMini Burger with Niman Ranch Beef + Cheese ($4.50 + $0.50): Don't be fooled by the name \"Mini\". This is actually their \"normal\" burger (Super comes with 2 patties). It comes with 1 4-oz patty, yummy melty cheese, and a bunch of free toppings if you desire (lettuce, tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, super sauce, etc.). I get it simple with extra lettuce, tomatoes, and the super sauce, which is similar to the thousand-islandish sauce that In n Out uses. The burger always comes out super juicy and full of flavor. Veggies are always fresh, and the cheese is melted perfectly over all the meat.\n\nGarlic Fries w/Parmesan Cheese ($2.75): Yum, definitely a staple for me. Fries are usually really crispy, but the amount of garlic/cheese fluctuates with every visit. More often than not though, the fries come topped with a ton of garlic and parmesan cheese. So much so that your breath ends up smelling like garlic for a full 24 hours! But who cares about bad breath when it's delicious while you're eating it!\n\nThe bf usually gets the Super Burger; like I said, the only difference being the 2 meat patties instead of 1. \n\nThe food here is really solid and consistent. Never had a bad meal here! In my opinion, this is definitely one of the better burger places in the city in terms of taste/price, especially compared with the other local Castro/Mission ones like Burgermeister (expensive for what you get) & Urbun Burger (meat was a bit dry). They also have soft serve here for dessert! Hand-dipped cones too!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

The burgers come in two sizes (mini or super) with the option to add free and premium toppings (egg, bacon, cheese, avocado). They also have shakes (malts and spiked shakes too), salads, chicken sandwiches, and veggie burgers. For dessert, you can choose from homemade pie, cookies and Straus organic soft serve ice cream cones (dipped or not). A kid's menu is available. \n\nLove that they make their own pickles at the condiment station. \n\n* Mini burger ($4.50): neatly wrapped and carefully put together, the patty was very juicy with a lovely char, the veggies (a leaf lettuce - not iceberg, yay, red onions, tomato) were fresh and bun was warm and soft. Their secret sauce, a mayo based concoction, didn't add much to the burger's flavor.\n* Garlic fries: thin, lightly crispy, right amount of salt, sprinkled with parmesan cheese\n* Dipped cone (Straus soft serve vanilla ice cream, chocolate shell, cake cone): wonderful, will bring back childhood memories, it's very messy and it's much bigger than DQ's version\n\nDriving by their giant soft serve cone sign always makes me think of fro-yo.", "author": "Lolia S."}

Which kind of makes sense because I feel this place is like a cross between Pearls and In N Out. But its WAY than Pearls. I read other reviews about the grease factor- I did notice it, but it wasn't overwhelming. The patty was also a perfect medium, and had a good flavor. It tasted more fresh than In N Out beef. \n\nGarlic fries- again, way better than Pearls, but In N Outs fries (plain) are still superior. I'd get garlic over regular, and they give a normal portion size, so thats a plus. \nPickles- these were too sweet for me.\nSmall chocolate dipped cone- delicious! The cake cone tasted like a rice krispy treat!\nUNLIMITED COKE ZERO REFILLS- I'd come back just for these alone. \n\nOverall, Super Duper really surprised me.

Tonight's episode was even worse (Upper Market location.)  When my burger arrived the wrapper was just covered in grease. I picked it up to take a bite and grease just POURED down my hands. I held it out over the tray and just watched as grease trailed down off the burger and puddled on to the tray. I tried one very tiny bite and immediately pushed the tray away and said \"no way.\" My friend had ordered garlic fries and there was grease puddled at the bottom of the little paper tray they serve in, and his burger had the same issues mine had with the grease. I have never just pushed an entire meal aside like that, but I knew I couldn't do that to my body! I appreciate a good burger with some juice, but this was DISGUSTING.

Like I could imagine it on one of those old faded ringer-tees. \n\nThe super hamburgers have a nice simplicity to them as well. Although you can dress your burger up in all kinds of things like portobella mushrooms and grilled onions, it's the beef that really stands out in these burgers. It's not often that I can sit there and really enjoy the taste of the beef in a burger, but that was the case when I bit into one of the super burgers here. A juicy medium-rare, with a solid slightly charred crust on the outside. Topped with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, sliced red onions, and cheese, it was an extremely satisfying burger. It's size doesn't quite match up to some of the other burger joints around, but the taste definitely does. I could do worse for $7. Extra for some of the special additions. There's a smaller slider-sized burger, which is essentially the same thing. I think that would be plenty for me next time. \n\nThe fries here were decent. Nothing that special. One of my friends was disappointed that they use garlic powder instead of real roasted garlic on the garlic fries. The dipping sauces for the fries are pretty good, though. Mayo, chipotle, and super sauce. Not sure what the super sauce is, although I'm thinking that it's some thousand island knock-off. A big bonus is the homemade pickles. They are delicious. And I'm not regularly a pickle person, but the pickles they make here are snap-crispy and have a tangy/zesty brine to them. \n\nI wish i'd had room for some of their soft-serve cones. I saw a ton of people eating them and I so wanted one. Next time. They also had a cookie and cream shake that I would be interested in trying. A little pricey, so we'll have to see if it's worth it. \n\nEven though the place is not that big, it was surprisingly easy to find a table.

Often garlic fries can be overpowering with garlic (Gordon Biersch, for example). This had just the right amount -- present enough to remind you you were eating garlic fries, but not so much that you have no chance of some make out time post Big Red chew. The parmesan cheese was a nice touch, though they could've added a bit more.\n\nThe soda - well, c'mon now, that's pretty standard.\n\nOverall, a good meal, and a nice alternative to some of the other fast food joints around. The In-N-Out comparison for burgers is valid, though these are a bit smaller. \n\nI'd go back, for sure.", "author": "Jonathan M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-12", "description": "For me, a 4 star review means there wasn't anything terribly wrong with the food, but it also wasn't particularly spectacular, nor did it have that first bite wow factor that causes you to dream about it. And this seems to be the general sentiment amongst the early reviews for Super Duper.\n\nThe place was probably 50% full at 2pm for lunch. It was obviously still under construction when I got there, with plywood lining one of the walls. There were a few tables outside on Market St. Inside you had about a dozen tables including 1 large communal bar/table.\n\nI ordered a Superburger (4.75), garlic cheese fries (3), and a strawberry shake (3.5).\n\nThe shake was excellent, with plenty of fresh strawberries you could taste. The consistency was definitely more 'milk' than 'shake', but not a bad thing if you want a shake you can drink instead of scooping out with a straw. \n\nWhile I was waiting for my burger, another person ordered a choco-dipped cone (4) and disappeared so the worker asked if I'd like to have it. Normally I wouldn't want to ruin my appetite with dessert first, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try another item on the menu, especially since the milkshake was so good. And good thing for greediness because the cone was absolutely delicious. It had vanilla & chocolate swirled frozen soft serve inside of a chocolate shell so there was chocolate everywhere.\n\nThe burger took about 10 mins to come out. The bun was soft, the meat was fresh, albeit a tad small (slightly larger than your typical In&Out patty?). The extra $.50 to get lettuce and tomatoes was a little annoying but not a deal breaker. I didn't taste any of the 'super sauce' so maybe that's why I didn't think it was anything special. The first time I ate at Trueburger in Oakland, I bit into a burger, got a mouthful of their garlic aioli sauce and thought 'WOW,' but nothing like that here at Super Duper. The fries were your typical shoestrings, tossed with invisible garlic and dusted with parmesan. The fries were pretty good and large enough to share with 2-3 people.", "author": "Cristofer P."}

However, I think it was the chicken sandwich and he got the vegetarian burger. His burger was the size of my hand, which isn't that big, thankfully I thought to myself I got the chicken sandwich because it was as big as his hands, which are big. \n\nI remember my sandwich good but I'm not really sure about my bf's food, he didn't seem too pleased. It's expensive for what you get, I mean I understand they try and use organic stuff and buy local cage free chicken and free range cow meat but at least give me a little more food. I love to eat, lots of food. And you have to order fries seperately??? NO. I want my fries to come with the burger, but alas I had to order the fries otherwise I'm sure I would have left with an empty stomach. \n\nDon't get me wrong my sandwich was yummy but not enough for me to go back.

Thankfully the cheese was a sprinkling of parmesan on top of lightly garlicked fries.  Didn't see any saut\u00e9ed garlic so it must have been a drizzle or dusting of garlic.  Was yummy though.

My friends and I have come here many a night after Happy Hour at Badlands or the like.  A burger from this place is not small --  so it gets the job done. Also note that this place is one of those Hangover cure places.  I attribute this to the fact that... well... you're eating beef wrapped in grease.\n\nAmbiance:  What can I say about Super Duper?  It's a burger joint, but with an oversized menu and a pleasurable color scheme.  The menu is pretty extensive. What happens upon entry is that you get to choose between a small or larger sized burger.  You then pick individual ingredients to add to your burger, such as bacon, avocado, etc.  It's not unlike The Counter a la Santana Row and other locations. There is also a self-serve soda machine and the bathrooms are relatively clean for a fast food restaurant.  I found it enjoyable.  \n\nService:  Like many a fast food restaurants, this place has you order at the front from the oversized menu overhead.  You'll then have your name called and they'll hand you your tray when you come up to get it.  Beyond that, don't expect much service.\n\nFood:  The burgers here are probably nicer in presentation than anything you'll get at Burger King or McDonalds.  I enjoy coming here over either of those places, but it still doesn't really stack up to In n Out in my mind.  That being said, such a comparison is based on TASTE.  If we're going for simple size, I dare say that Super Duper burgers are bigger.\n\nTIP:  This place can fill up, so if you're with a friend, have them sit down while you order.\n\nTIP:  Both the garlic fries AND the sweet potato fries are worth trying.  Try the three-types of dipping sauce too.\n\nTIP:  If you're really watching the calories, the chicken option is worth exploring.  They ALSO have a Vegetarian option, just in case your or one of your friends doesn't eat things that used to have heartbeats.  \n\nTIP:  A link to the current menu! http://www.superdupersf.com/pdfs/SUP-Menu-1011.pdf", "author": "Bryan H."}

I don't think I've done that at any place in the world besides my own house! As much as I love Sushi Zone, the wait is way too long for even twice in the same week. Txoko is my new favorite \"formal\" sit down restaurant but it's pricey and parking is horrible. Super Duper is cheap, right in my neighborhood and is the best burger I've ever EVER had.\n\nSorry to In-N-Out, Burger Bar, Umami, Bradley Ogden, McDonald's, Pearl's Deluxe, Hall of Flame, Burger King, Jenny's, White Castle, Shake Shack, etc. you guys just don't compare. Yes, I've eaten a lot of burgers and those are just to name a few.\n\nI was actually not impressed the first time I ate at Super Duper but this was when they first opened. Since then, they've redone the recipe for the hamburgers and bless them for it because it is now not only SUPER DUPER juicy, but has just enough grease to make the delicious beef flavor linger in your mouth. It's a hot mess with special sauce AND melted cheddar cheese dripping down. The toasted bun and accompanying lettuce, grilled onions and tomatoes are fresh and play wonderful supporting roles. You never think wtf there's too much lettuce, I can't taste the meat! \n\nFries are amazing too and I'm not just saying that because I love their burgers so much. They're thin cut with the skins left on and always hot and fresh. You need to get an organic soft serve Straus vanilla cone after your meal. Coming from an \"ice cream over soft serve\" kinda gal, this says a lot. They're also open until 11PM EVERYDAY. And if all that wasn't enough, everything they serve the food with is COMPOSTABLE! YAY for being good to the costumers AND to mother earth. \n\nI LOVE YOU SUPER DUPER! You know this is for real because I haven't used this many caps in a long time.", "author": "Julia T."}

No fancy restaurant for me. Their burgers, fries and soft-serve are made with all natural ingredients and no junk like MSG or high-fructose corn syrup.\n\nThere are a few tables out front on the sidewalk and it was a nice evening so we took our meal out there. That's when the doped-up dude came along and showed us Mr. Wang.\n\nHe stared at me first and smiled, seemingly mesmerized by my good looks or something. Then he stumbled toward us and all I could think was, \"No dude, please go away.. don't talk to us, we're having such a good time and you're just going to frack it up..\"\n\nHe was about 25 and dirty, with a closely shaved head and clad all in black-leather except for a pair of loose-fitting jeans that found their way down to around his ankles as he walked up. He didn't seem to be aware of it at first and smiled like a little kid as he approached and waved at me. \"HI!\" he said.\n\nIt was disconcerting to have this guy's dick within about two feet of my wife's cheeseburger. I don't really think that's happened in our twenty-two years of marriage and it's a stretch even for San Francisco. Hell, even for The Castro District. Usually the standard naked guys don't walk up and wave their wangs at people having a meal outside, but as I said, this guy didn't seem to be aware that his pants had fallen down.\n\nHe must have seen the expression on my face, which probably looked like I was about to remove his appendage with my knife if he didn't do something about it right quick, so he glanced down and then yanked his jeans up while apologizing. Then he sat opposite us and stared at my wife.\n\n\"Please don't join us,\" she said. \"You weren't invited.\"\n\n\"Oh I'm sorry, I was just waiting for a friend!\" His eyes grew big as if he'd just been scolded by his grandmother, then he looked at me and smiled again.\n\n\"I'm really, really sorry..\" he stammered. \"But you look like Jesus.\" Then he turned back to her. \"So you must be.. MRS JESUS!\"\n\nJust then a door opened next to our little sidewalk table and a guy came out. \"There you are!\" he said to our guest. Come on up..\"\n\nThey went through the door and headed upstairs, with Mr. black-leather dude glancing back a couple of times while continuing to smile as he tried to convince his friend that Mr and Mrs Jesus were sitting there eating cheeseburgers right by the front door.\n\nIn LA we once had a homeless guy come up and act like a dog. He begged for a bite of my burrito and then lifted his leg and peed on the bush beside me. In San Diego I once had a bum give me change, saying that I looked like I needed it more than him. \n\nAt Disney World, my wife was stalked by an autograph hound who thought she was Shelley Duval, and while in a restaurant in Medford Oregon one evening, someone sent a bottle of wine to our table because they thought she was Alanis Morrisette.\n\nBut only in San Francisco have we been flashed and then mistaken for Mr and Mrs Jesus. God, we love this city.\n\nFour stars because the burgers and fries were pretty good and the floor-show was quite entertaining. But the soft-serve was kind of runny that day.

They were very warm and helpful in helping us decide what to get, because it was all of our first times at SDB. I enjoyed the friendliness and helpfulness we received.\nWhen we got our food, I was uncertain about whether I would get full off my 6 oz. burger. The guys all got 8oz burgers and for a moment I regret not doing the same. However, more than halfway through we all felt very full. The little burger was so dense and compact that it was more than a meal itself.\nMore onto the quality. The patty was very juicy indeed. They usually cook their burgers medium rare but I asked for medium well. The cheese is additional (typical at most burger places but I never understood why). And I also added avocado for $1 which is reasonable. The overall taste was great. The aoili complimented the flavor of the burger very well, as well as my pint of Great White (my favorite!)

Decided to give it a try. It's right next to the mall, so it's not a big journey after a shopping trip.\n\nFirst off, the decor is pretty cool and modern, similar to the feel of a chipotle (purely on decorations). So it feels very inviting to crowds today. The flow of traffic is a little confusing for new customers, and I mean a little, not impossible, but I was a little confused in getting my food at first.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple, but because it is labeled \"Organic\" it is pretty pricey, making it lean toward medium priced food. Certainly similar to what you'd pay for at chipotle [purely on price]. When I try new places, I always try to get the most popular menu item at its most \"Vanilla\" state, so I got a regular super burger with cheese. It didn't take too long to be ready (wasn't too crowded when I got there).\n\nThe burger was pretty good, definitely comparable to other burgers in the same price range. I can compare it to Habit and Smashburger in taste and quality. Oddly enough, they're all pretty evenly greasy. What set this apart from the other two is the \"Special Sauce\", no idea what's in it, but it's good.\n\nMy friend got the ice cream cone, once again, pretty expensive because of the \"Organic\"-ness of it. Strictly his opinion, it was alright, nothing special. I haven't tried it because I couldn't really afford to buy it.\n\nIn conclusion, if you haven't tried Super Duper yet, it's definitely a good burger joint, but it's definitely something that I would get from time to time, purely because it's a little expensive for my pocket.

This meal comes with some mighty fine thin, crisp fries in a little basket.  I usually order their housemade ginger lemonade which is so good, and they keep large jars of house made pickles that are delicious for the taking.  \n\nThey make some fine milk shakes and floats as well as offer smoothie type ice cream and home made cookies and desserts.  The staff is always friendly, helpful and attentive, the place is kept clean and stocked with all that is needed to make the best impression on their customer and they have well thought out indoor and outdoor seating that can make for some nice people watching along Market Street across from Gold's Gym Castro location.

I like that you can customize the burgers and I don't eat very big portions so I liked that they had a mini option. The only downside to the burger was that the bun was really small?  My boyfriend got the super super burger and added an egg which he said was really tasty but the bun didn't even cover the meat. Everything was spilling out of the burger?

Not overcooked.  Not tough.  Not the most flavorful bun I've ever eaten, but it wasn't unpleasant or distracting in any way. \n\nSpread - I guess it was some kind of special spread.  It was actually really delicious.  Tasty, but not overpowering.  I couldn't put my finger on what exactly it was, although it was definitely mayo-based.\n\nLettuce - A leaf of butter lettuce, not too big.  I hate when places put the thickest, worst tasting leaves of iceberg they can find on sandwiches.  This was not that.  \n\nOnion - Not a fan of uncooked red onion on burgers, so I took them off.  I can say they were thinly sliced, which I appreciate. \n\nTomato - A nice slice of a good tomato, cool but not cold.  Soft, but not falling apart or hard. \n\nCheese - A pre-sliced cheddar.  Nothing spectacular.  Melted well, not to the point of liquidation but thoroughly melted through.\n\nBeef - Very good.  They advertise the quality of their meat pretty frequently, and it's true.  Their beef is good.  They cook and season it well, although it might have been a tad salty.  Not sure if it was the meat or the spread.  Either way, it was a quality burger. \n\nThe most interesting thing about the burger was that it was a \"smashed\" burger, which means they put a ball of beef on the grill and smash it down as it cooks.  I love burgers like this, because you know it's not a frozen patty, and the cheese melts into all the little nooks and crannies in the meat. \n\nBun - See bun.\n\nVerdict - One of the best \"fast food\" style burgers I've ever tasted.  It's also a \"smashed\" burger, which really is great.  I think those are awesome.  It's on the small side for a burger that costs $8-10, but there's a lot of meat on the super burger and it doesn't need to be any bigger.  I was pretty full after the burger, half of my fries, the cone, and some lemonade from my house. The quality of the meat really comes through in the taste.  One bite and I was going, \"Oh, yeah.  Yay.  Yes.\"  \n\nFries - The best way I can describe the fries are if In & Out and McDonald's had a fry baby.  They're AWESOME.  They're the same quality potato as In & Out, with the skins attached, but they're a little bit greasier and saltier, like McDonald's but not as gross.  Definitely recommended. \n\nVanilla chocolate-dipped cone - It's good for soft serve, but it's still not real ice cream.  Pretty standard for a dipped cone.\n\nOverall verdict - If you like no frills fast-food style burgers, this is likely going to be one of the best ones you'll eat.  Their fries are great.  Prices are reasonable, but not bragworthy.  I saw a LOT of people drinking the shakes when I was there and almost all the reviews mention them, so I imagine they're good.

The price is right, the quality is top notch.  I mean, I can't think of any place - high end or low brow - that serves a burger AS HOT as this.  I don't mean spicy hot, I mean fresh off the mother-f**kin' grill HOT, like TEMPERATE, like wow that s**t is HOT.\n\nFirst off, big bonus points for ANY burger joint that allows adding a Fried Egg as an option.  I'm a big fan of this, big proponent of the marriage of egg and burger.  \n\n[side note: in France, they call a hamburger with an egg on top Steak Hache (like hash steak) avec (with) Oeufs (eggs) a Cheval (literally on a horse.)  No, it's not horsemeat you loud American.  The egg is \"riding\" on the hamburger, like a jockey on a horse, capische?]\n\nLove the fries, love the secret sauce, like the option of grilled onions or raw onions and really love the buns (an oft-overlooked aspect of fine burgerlery.)  \n\nMy only complaint - and I'm not usually one of these guys who cares at all about atmosphere - but it is F**king LOUD in there!  I mean, Kee-Ryst it's noisy.  As if it was DESIGNED to be echo-y.  I cannot imagine someone walking in there with a bunch of kids, forget it.  Maybe if it wasn't all metal and concrete the noise level could be more livable?  Maybe it was a conscious decision on the part of the owners to get people in and out quickly?  'Cause I guarantee you, when I'm done eating, I am getting the HELL out of there just so I can hear myself think.  \n\nThe pickles?  Love that they're free, but they are too sweet, too sugary for my taste.  I prefer a more traditional (German / Jewish) salty or vinegar-y pickle.  Their pickles have that sort of classic Vlassic flavor, which I'm sure appeals to Southern Baptists and the like, but it ain't floating my boat.  But, hey, they're FREE, right, so I mean, quit complaining already.\n\nShould you go?  You should go.  You should eat.  You're looking a little thin.", "author": "Invisible J."}

I don't need any fancy schmancy burger menu with things in French or words that I need to Google in order for me understand what it means.  I just want the basic components that make up a delicious burger.\n\nThe Super Burger (8 oz) is comprised of 2 patties.  I added cheese and bacon which cost a bit extra.  This burger is really juicy and moist which made it delicious.  At the same time, it's greasy as hell.  I'm assuming that they're using 80/20 ground beef (80% meat, 20% fat) which would explain why it's so juicy & greasy.  The patties were cooked perfectly, not too pink and not over done.  Overall, a good burger.  The fries were fries, nothing to comment about.\n\nIf you look at their menu, it says \"Our burgers are cooked medium and are very juicy . . . . could be messy business !!\"  They are on point with this statement and I 100% agree.", "author": "Suzi K."}

It always caught my eye just cuz it stands out just like a pink umbrella in a sea lion park. As I hauled my drunk ass past that ice cream cone of craziness night after liver killing night, I realized that I just *needed* to figure out what was up with that restaurant behind the sign.\n\nI also need to say that I'm not the biggest burger-at-a-restaurant guy. The biggest reason why is because I can make some impressive panty dropping patties on a grill if I find myself behind one. So, burgs at 'straunts have a pretty high bar to jump over. However, just like a spandex clad olympic gymnast made out of silicone, the super duper burger slides right over the competition and into first place.\n\nIts hard to describe what made the burger so awesome, but it was really just a perfect blend of flavors. Nothing stood out, nothing was silent. It was one harmonious meat chorus playing at my lips and down into my stomach. The bun was a perfect pairing - not too boring, not too crunchy. In a word, LOVE. Probably the best burger I've ever had in SF (yes, even beating out my own).\n\nMaybe it also had to do with the infinite homemade pickles (win!). Or maybe it even had something to do with the fact that I walked out of this place for under $15 for an epic meal (burger, fries, and beer).

Well, it wasn't my first choice but when you are with a group, sometimes you must go with the majority.  But most if not all burger places have a veggie option, so I knew I would be ok.\n\nI will say the place is cute - and as some others have commented, the simplicity of the menu is very much like a higher end in -n - out.  Plus, they have organic soft serve, which I am a huge fan of (even though I didn't have it this time....)\n\nso, my friends order their beef burgers and a friend and I each order the only veggie option, which is a deep fried portobello mushroom burger - not the most healthy option, but I AM in a burger joint so I just give a little slack.\n\nSo - when I am ordering I ask the person taking my order if there is a side salad, or a different side option than fries.  I was happy to hear they did have a side salad so ordered it along with my veggie burger.  The person then told me they had a chicken caesar, but then even commented - oh, you don't want meat ,right?  To which I answered - yes, veggies only please.\n\nSo - nice self serve soda section, quaint seating area.  Then the food comes out - my mushroom burger was good - crisp but not oily and certainly was a nice change from the normal veggie or boca burger you find elsewhere.  \n\nBut here is my issue - the salad.  I am eating my salad and after a few bites, something tastes weird...I cannot figure it out, but not right.  I take a few more bites, and start to literally pick the salad apart trying to figure out what was wrong and what do I find in my supposed veggie salad - BACON!  WTF!!!  \n\nNow - I am not the type of veggie eater that does it for humanitarian reasons or anything, I am doing it purely for health reasons (I know the mushroom was deep fried, but really was my only option - hence why i skipped the fries!).  But COME ON - when one orders a veggie burger, and a side salad and even COMMENTS that I do not want meat - don't you think you should MENTION there is BACON in the salad.\n\nSigh - in hindsight I should have said something at the time - but I didn't want to look like a complaining bitch and we were in a hurry to make a movie.  \n\nSo - recommendation - please mention there is bacon in your salad - because it may be a surprise to those who do not want to be consuming meat product with their supposed veggie side option!\n\nJen", "author": "Jen R."}

The decor is also nice and the whole restaurant was clean.\n\nThis restaurant gets 5 stars alone for the amazing service; the worker was sweet, helpful, and knowledgeable about the products. I ordered the mini burger with cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and their super sauce which is a mayo based thousand island dressing sauce.

My boyfriend and I waited for about 10 minutes before receiving our food which the worker brought out to us (unnecessary, but thank you!)\n\nThe grass fed vegetarian patty was cooked medium rare and was surprisingly very good! I usually like everything well done, but this wasn't too bad. I couldn't really taste the super sauce they said that they put in the burger and the bacon wasn't as crispy as I thought it would be, but the burger as a whole tasted good. The fries are just regular shoestring potato fries. The sauces, however, are nowhere near regular. The chipotle was nice and spicy and was very flavorful. The super sauce was also very flavorful and, when added, complemented the burger. The homemade mayo was my favorite! My boyfriend looked in disgust as I dipped my french fries in this wonderful creation. It was a little on the thick eggy side though, but I thought it was delicious!

The egg leaked throughout the burger, rewarding each bite with its infusion.

The thinness of the fries made it incapable of soaking up too much artery-clogging oil, and as a result, tasted light and appropriately salted.  \n\nSuper Duper's fare was definitely tasty, but the cost of the meal, necessity to shout over the rest of the restaurant to have any conversation, and questionable service prevent it from being a reliable option.", "author": "Andrew M."}

On the rare occasion that an order has been wrong, they have no issue making it right.\n\nThe burgers themselves are visibly good; the burger looks perfectly engineered to fit the toppings, the bun and the paper it's wrapped in which also keeps the abundant moisture in; these burgers are dripping with just the right amount of fat that they taste fantastic but don't make you regret eating them, and let the bun stay intact.\n\nThe garlic fries are insane. These things have a really intense garlic flavor, and are not for someone who doesn't really like garlic.

There are a lot of good topping options you can pick from too. The 4oz burger was PLENTY - so even if you're starving (I was) don't feel like you neeeeeeeed the 8oz burger.\n\nThe garlic fries - super good. Tons of parmesan cheese on top and pretty greasy. Probably not the healthiest thing in the world, but I can dig it.\n\nMilkshakes - MMMM, I got the cookies-n-cream milkshake thinking it would be basically an oreo milkshake.... it's not, it's actually their vanilla shake with their own homemade cookie mixed in.... not what I expected, but I did enjoy it.

I paid using my credit/debit card. The bill was $14.00. However, my checking account shows a pending charge of $16.80 (which is the bill of $14.00 + a 20% tip of $2.80. I did NOT add a tip to my credit card slip, and I don't appreciate a tip (20% at that) being added automatically for a counter-service burger joint. I am not sure if this is something your computers do automatically, or if it was the employee serving me, but either way it is DISHONEST and I won't EVER be eating at your restaurant again. My friend who had lunch with me also had the same thing happen to him. \n\nI have written to the owner/manager at the email address listed on their website this morning and am waiting for a response. I have tried to call Super Duper, but their answering machine won't accept messages.  Since I love reading reviews on Yelp (and often do so before trying out new places) I figured I'd repay the favor by warning people about this.\n\nI'ts too bad...the burger was good...but I won't be going back.\n\n*****Edited on 6/10/10: I received a response from a representative of the restaurant who explained that in the restaurant environment, the cc merchant processor authorizes transactions for 20% more than bill (for tip purposes) and based on our conversation I am editing my comment, although I have never had this happen to me before (and I always use my debit/ccard) so I am questioning why is that? Wouldn't it happen EVERY time I used my card at a restaurant? Actually, I should clarify, the only time this has happened to me before was when a server fraudulently added a tip to my bill (and was subsequently fired as there was proof of this). So you can understand my concern over the \"extra\" 20% showing up as a pending charge. It just rubs me the wrong way that a presumption is made that a tip will be added to a bill at a fast food joint, especially when there is a tip jar on the counter.", "author": "Elle F."}

When my girlfriend first told me about Super Duper, I expected it would be like Burger Meister or Burger Joint -- a burger shack that makes me feel like a San Franciscan eating a hamburger.  \n\nThe first time we went, it all felt regular. Grass-fed meat, old-timey font with futuristic tables, eat.   It was cheap and small and I liked it. We ate, and then I forgot all about Super Duper. The next time we went, I expected to eat and forget about it again. \n\nThen my life changed.  The guy at the counter said, \"Do you like cheese?\"   Oh my gosh, I LOVE cheese. He showed me this crazy secret menu (which has since been incorporated into the regular menu) with bigger burgers with even more precious combinations of items. I got a four cheese burger -- jack, cheddar, blue, and parmesan.   And I got a Racer 5 while waiting.  Best Freaking Burger Experience Ever. \n\nSometime at one of the next twelve-times-in-two-weeks visits,  I asked my girlfriend very seriously while waiting in line, \"What happens if I eat these all the time?\"  \"What do you mean?\"  she asked.  \"I mean, like if I eat a four-cheese burger every week? Is it bad for me?\"    \n\nYes, it might be bad. It might be horrible for my health and it might make me fat. I'm not going to think about that now. I am going to go there whenever I feel like it -- often -- and drink Racer 5 while waiting for my blue cheese burger to come out.  So far I have not gotten tired of this blue cheese burger.

I don't need frills, and by frills I mean, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle....BBQ sauce, avocado, sprouts....and anything else you can slap on a burger. There seems to be a problem with burger places thinking they need to get real messy with a burger (i.e. Burgermeister).\n\nGive me bun, meat, cheese, maybe a little special sauce, then bun. I want to taste the quality of the meat, the cheese, and the sauce you've created and that is what Super Duper does well. Fresh ingredients, simple menu, not $10 for a burger, and they serve beer. Sure, there are a few things that need tuning up (like teaching their staff how to pour a pint), but that all comes with opening up a new place. Oh, and the fresh pickles in a jar...they are amazing, but I don't see that lasting long.

The bread isn't really spongy, it's sort of \"light\" in that you can just pinch a piece away and the rest stays super airy.... I like a heavier bread with my burgers, so this didn't work for me.  The meat was fine though.  The fries tasted a bit like it was time to change the oil, and weren't hot.  This made me quite unhappy, I decided these burgers are not for me.\n\nThe third time, went with the soft serves again, they sputtered out of the vanilla for the swirl, so it was heavy on chocolate, and a bit melty... unhappy.\n\nDecided to try a fourth time (since the third had been the charm, I was thinking this would be lover-ly again.)  Wanted to try the chocolate dipped cones.  First, they said the machine was running a bit spotty (oh noooo, AGAIN???) and then they offered to put the soft serve in a cup with chocolate and cone.  I decided to go with the suggestion, forked over the $8 for two chocodippedsoftserves, and waited... and waited.... and waited... They were apparently running behind somehow someway, everyone was coming back to the counter to check on their orders, and finally after 15 mins (honestly, i was looking at my watch), I got the two soft serves... they were soppy and soggy, and I wished I had just kept my $8 and left.  \n\nHow difficult can it be, with such a small menu, and an emphasis on soft serves on your outside signage, to keep your machine working?No more, I'm over these guys, they suck.\n\nhttp://dph-extranet2.sfdph.org:7777/pls/eeop_htmldb/f?p=132:2:3055030610926135::NO::P2_LOCATIONID:62358", "author": "I Love S."}

I believe that it is, indeed, fresh daily-ground, Niman Ranch beef.  The fries are average on the pretty good side of the spectrum.\n\nThe Bad - You know you're in trouble when you touch your burger and the first thing you think is, \"where the hell are the napkins\"?  These burgers are Greasy!!!  And it's not the good kind of grease oozing out of the meat or the cheese.  This is some kind of artificial butter/grease to make the burger taste better....and it's all over the burger on the outside.\n\n...And The Ugly - I felt a little stomach discomfort from the burger afterwards and I attribute it to that mysterious and omnipresent grease.  All in all, it's the grease that has left the indelible imprint in my food memory and that's why I'm giving this place three stars instead of four or five.  They are tasty though; no getting around that.\n\nHowever, my vote for the best burger in town goes to either Annabel's on 4th Street/Mission, Bistro Burger or Ziggy's on Drumm across from the Hyatt in The Embarcadero.\n\nDrop me a line if you find a better burger...\n\nThanks in advance.", "author": "Rene H."}

It's certainly not the best burger I've ever had, but for a late-night meat craving, it sure hits the spot. Still, I think there's lots of room for improvement here. \n\nThe restaurant itself seems unfinished, or finished terribly on the cheap. One wall is clad entirely in bolted plywood, and the entire place itself is very scaled back and bare. It almost made me wonder if the owners (who also run the very nicely decorated Starbelly and Beretta) were waiting to see if the place makes it a bit before adding some more decorating flourishes. \n\nThe menu is pretty simple, which didn't bother me. Still, the notion of charging extra just for veggies on a burger is a bit weird. Also a bit annoying was how the woman taking my order kept trying to upsell me--\"Want lettuce and tomato?\" \"Want something to drink like beer or wine?\" She seemed almost rebuffed when I skipped the veggie$ and just ordered an i\u00a2ed tea. Sorry ma'am... as if you couldn't tell, I've already had some beer and wine.\n\nAs for the food, I thought it was pretty good. As to the greasy comments people have made... well, um, it's a fried burger. If you want it more well done, I suggest trying one of the charred briquettes over at Sliders. The cheese-garlic fries were a letdown tho; the cheese was more a sprinkle of Parmesan with some garlic. When I asked it they could make REAL cheesy fries with some cheddar, I was told no. Boo. (The regular fries were pretty decent tho.)

The milkshakes looked delicious and I would have gotten one after dinner if the line hadn't been out the door.\n\nI think my experience was somewhat marred by the fact that I was hoping or expecting a big, fat, juicy burger. Instead, I basically got a higher quality version of In-N-Out. Don't get me wrong, I love In-N-Out and the burger was definitely good, however, just off the mark of being amazing. Condiments are limited (ketchup and mustard) but they also have what I believe to be homemade pickles. The price is totally right on.\n\nThe regular fries were pretty decent, skinny and hot (like how I like my men... zing!). The garlic fries were cold :( And the cheese was like crumbly parmesan. I would have brought them back but I absolutely hate wasting food so I just dug through for the crispy ones instead.\n\nIf I'm in the neighborhood, I would come back and it's definitely worth a try for anyone that loves a good burger.\n\nThe nice employee was just as charming when he was cleaning my table and almost made me bump it up to 4 stars.

The veggie burger was really tasty, it had a really fresh, \"healthy\" flavor that I appreciated (rather than the greasy ones you get in most places). The portobello burger was also a hit. It doesn't say on the menu, but the portobello is breaded and deep fried, so it's crispy and meaty rather than runny with juice dripping down your hands. Somehow it wasn't greasy either--the most \"healthy\" tasting deep fried thing I've ever had without sacrificing the flavor. The blue cheese on top was perfect, totally worth the extra buck.\n\nThe fries on their own were okay, but the three dips were really tasty (all mayo-based). Also, they have home made pickles available at the condiments counter (amazing!). \n\nAlso, I like that everything is organic/local/etc. but it doesn't comprimise the taste, and the decor of the place is super hip rather than the usual hippy granola vibe of similar restaurants.

A Niman Ranch burger will set you back $3.75 and a cheeseburger is $4.25 (add $2 each for a double). Fries are $2.25 and milkshakes and ice cream are also available.\nSuper Duper Burger also has something you'll never find at In 'N Out: a couple of well-selected beer taps. Granted, the beer variety isn't as extensive as Burger Bar's, but the light, refreshing North Coast Scrimshaw pilsner and the piney Racer 5 IPA from Bear Republic are more than adequate. You can eat inside the cozy restaurant or, on a sunny day, sit at an outdoor table.\nWhether you're in a blue state or red state, conservative or liberal, evangelical or atheist, burgers are as American as the 4th of July, diners and barbecues, and it's no wonder they are such a great match with American ales and lagers. Unlike mass-market American beers, which only add cold and wet, American craft beers like Scrimshaw and Racer 5 offset the savory umami flavors in the burger.", "author": "chuck l."}

Superburger is neither. The sparseness of the decor reflects the sparseness of the menu which, in turn, reflects the mediocrity of the food. Not that the food is bad at all, but I would not pass up Urban Burger or Barney's, for example, to go back to SD. In fact, I think a lot of regular restaurants in the Castro have much better -- and more substantial -- burgers than SD.\n\nI did appreciate that the burgers were not greasy and that the Double gave the option for a decent size. The garlic and cheese fries saved the day. The staff got the order in front of us wrong, as well as ours, even though it was not at all crowded.\n\nSo next time we have a quick burger fix in the 'Stro probably will just go back to Sliders.", "author": "Eric P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-12", "description": "BurgerQuest 2010 - The adventure continues. Maybe I should just put my weight as the lead line on these burger reviews. You could tell by the rising number when each review was done in relationship to the next. No, no, I'm not doing that. Yikes. \n\nHaving grown up in SF, I'm mentally prepared for when she throws a summer heatwave fastball at me but 85 out of the clear as a muthafuckah blue? I'll take it and a bike ride for burgers with the best gal. Some places get good and bad reviews for the major moves and missteps. Super Duper scored its stars with the little plays that don't show up in the boxscore (as the sportswriter cliche goes). \n\nTo wit: \n\n-Menu items including tax and totaling up to nice even amounts. Why doesn't everybody do this? Crikey. \n-That same menu being simple and clear (if cribbed from In-N-Out) \n-Self serve homemade pickles were sweetish but a nice waiting nosh \n-good friendly service and sensible basic seating/deco \n\nThe burger itself was also in the In-N-Out mold which is not a bad thing and a borderline great thing for a serious city dweller who doesn't venture out to the chain world very often. Be aware this is a smaller sized burger. A lot of people have had their appetites desensitized by the Fuddrucker/Red Robin/$6 burger monstrosities out there. This is a good, sensibly sized burger with excellent proportions of meat-veg-cheese-bun-sauce. By fast food standards this would be much less, better quality meat, more, fresher veg, and way less sauce. The whole thing was a nice little ensemble. My only critique would be an option to have the patty cooked to order, both our burgers were uniformly medium and for good beef like that I would have gone medium rare. But I quibble. \n\nRegular fries were skinny, tasty not of the overly soft In-N-Out style (a good thing). The garlic-cheese fries were not my thing but She dug them, the cheese is more the shaker style Parmesan than melted cheddar or nacho or whatever else you might be used to in your lactose fry condiment. The garlic is lighter than what I'm used to but sticks to the \"moderated palate\" thing these guys seem to be going for. Lemonade and ice tea were nice, under sweetened which was awesome and you could really taste the citrus. We split a soft serve cone for dessert and it was the bomb dizzle. Puts a crappy McD's cone to shame (I know, gross, but where else does one get soft serve cones readily these days?). I'm assuming the shakes would be equally thick and creamy with this soft serve as the base. \n\nOverall, a very solid, reasonably priced option for your burger fiending. If I find myself hungry in that neck again I won't hesitate to trade my currency for their tasty goods. \n\nThe missus wanted to ding them a star for their lack of Tabasco sauce or user accessible condiments in general. I held her off this time but, guys, get some more sauce options beyond ketchup, yellow mustard, and chipotle mayo por favor.", "author": "Milk N."}

I wasn't sure if It was food or not so I just waited. after 20 minutes I go up and ask if he can get us some sauces ready to throw in our bag so we could leave and salvage our lunch time. He asked me for my name and looked at the bag and hands it to me. Im staring at him like \"what the hell dude\" and tell him its been sitting up there for ever and is probably cold and soggy now. He didn't seem to care so I left with my co-workers. We get all the way back to the store and find out that each of our burgers is WRONG! \n\nBy that time I had enough. I marched my little self back down there and asked for Jessica who my receipt said placed my order via the phone.\nI very calmly and respectfully explained that my order was wrong. She IMMEDIATELY gets defensive and says \"Well what do you mean? I repeated it back to you on the phone.\" In a snotty tone. I just looked her dead in the eye and calmly asked \"Then why is it wrong?\" she got more of an attitude with me, trying to say its what I wanted. Then her bosses jumped in and apologized and started talking to me and told Jessica to go ring in other customers at the register next to us. As Im talking I look over and I see Jessica starting to cry while talking to a customer. Then 10 seconds later she is full on sobbing. Im standing there thinking \"Are you serious?!\" as she excuses herself in the middle of someones order to go break down in the bath room. I was extremely calm while interacting with her, even though I was throughly pissed the hell off and was even more enraged when she tried to argue with me.

My husband ordered the chicken sandwich.  We both got fries and drinks.  Tab came to just over $20.\n\nThe burger was good.  Not fantastic, but good.  The girl at the counter cautioned that they cooked their burgers medium and asked if that was ok.  It was fine with me, but they might want to recalibrate what they think is medium.  Mine was medium well at best.  Still moist, but not medium.  As others have noted, the super sauce is nothing to write home about.  My husband said the chicken was really good - very spicy.  I'll definitely give that a try next time.  And they keep a jar of pickles next to the condiments, which is nice.\n\nOne thing I really like about the place is that everything is either reusable (aluminum trays) or compostable, including the cups and straws.  This place is definitely doing the right thing when it comes to materials.  \n\nBottom line - the food's on par with most diner burger joints.

Easy to get to via public transportation, walking or driving. There's a plethora of things to do before and after dining or lunching here. This area is an oasis for social living.\n\nSpace: This decor of the place is very modern while simultaneously reminiscent of a high school cafeteria. It reminds me of a trendy cafeteria-style restaurant in New York City. The actual arrangement fo the tables is kind of awkward. There are rectangle tables, round tables and high tables and it's kind of really awkward to navigate through. This is specially inconvenient since you have to go pick up your food once it's done.\n\nAmbience: Gays, gays, gays are more gays. Didn't see many lesbians. But did I mention that its packed with gays. I think this is the high school experience these gay boys never got to experience because this place if full of \"clics\". You walk in and people stare you down, there are conspicuous whispers followed by group chuckles. Only this time they're not laughing at your effeminateness or your homosexuality, they're laughing at your underdeveloped pecks, lack of abs or bad haircut.\n\nFood/Drink: This of the burgers and fries from In N' Out. That's exactly it. Only there are two difference. One, all the food here is organic, locally grown and free range. Two, it's more expensive than In N' Out. While it's more expensive for the exact same taste, I do appreciate the local quality of it rather than giving it to a Jesus-Freak of a large of corporation. The burgers are generally good and the fries are fantastic. Not much in the drink area outside of soft drinks.\n\nService: Cute.\n\nOverall: Awesome place to stop by, get judged, judge and get a quick, delicious meal.", "author": "SF N."}

Tho the guy at the counter was friendly, he immediately told my friend and I that the hamburger and cheeseburger were sold plain, nothing on these, and I didn't even attempt to order yet.  Nevertheless, I ordered the Super Duper Burger (which I told was with 1/4lb of beef) with bacon, an order of garlic fries and a drink. The food came out quickly and looked good, however, the burger looked awfully small.  Actually, the meat was McDonald's hamburger size, with no flavor, and watery-juicy.  I did think that the garlic fries were good, though. I'm not a fan of shoestring fries, but they were good with lots of garlic and Parmesan cheese. \n\nAfter our meal, my friend ordered two soft serve sundaes from the menu. I opted for the sundae with crumbled chocolate chip cookies and bacon . Once ready, it looked fabulous, however again, it was not what I expected. The vanilla soft serve was quite tasteless, as was the chocolate chip cookie. The bacon was the only thing I could actually taste. \n\nThis place wasn't the best, but I will not make a trip back.

I was expecting much, but the burgers were surprisingly good. \n\nIt was a little confusing because I asked for a cheeseburger and the waiter responded, \"you know the cheeseburger doesn't have any lettuce, tomatoes, or onions.\" So of course my response was, \"Can I get it with LTO?\" He said... \"that's the Super Burger.\" SO I got the super burger and I loved it. Very clean tasting, and easy to eat without everything falling apart. The fries were also golden brown, very thin, crispy, and lightly salted. Yummo.\n\nIf you're ever in the Castro, it's a good place to sit outside and enjoy a cold beer with some friends.", "author": "Tracy L."}

BUT.\nI saw this place when I was walking home from work, so I persuaded \nsome work mates to try it for lunch a few times. Like I said, good food. No problems. Then I stopped in after work for a cone. The machine was on the fritz, so I had to get chocolate instead of vanilla. No big deal; it was great. A week or so later I stopped by again after work for a cone. The counter guy took my order and my money, served someone else, ate something, went in the bathroom, then walked out the door. His replacement began taking orders. The cones and such are made by the counter guys, so I figured no big wait. I sat right up front, facing the counter. A big wait. The new guy was making cones and shakes the whole time, though I could see that the machine was on the fritz again. It got to the point where I wanted to see if I'd ever get my cone, but after the first guy came back-- he'd been on a break, apparently-- I finally got up and mentioned that I'd been waiting 15 minutes while other cones were flying out the door. The other guy said 'gosh' or something and rushed in back, apparently to fix the ice cream machine, but the one who'd taken my order still acted like I didn't exist. Finally he said, 'what did you order?' like he'd never seen me before. Then he got the cone-- smaller than usual, but I chalked that up to the fritzy machine. Then, miracle of miracles, he gave me my money back. \nIt seems that it should be easy to find job candidates with good customer service skills in this economy, but that hasn't been my experience. I wonder why that is.", "author": "Robert C."}

The patty was thick and juicy.\n\nS.Heart and I also shared garlic fries.  The portion was small for two people, and being $2.75.  They were truly delicious, though.

The fries were tasty but a little cold and soggy. \n\nNow for the service. There was a male employee who looked young, was wearing jeans that kind of were slipping off his hips (I could see his underwear clearly), put his foot on a chair while wiping down a table, and picked up dirty customer's cups by sticking his fingers in them when clearing tables. Oh, and he didn't wash his hands afterwards. He also bumped into me several times as he squeezed by our table to get through when there was a clear path on the other side of the restaurant. I put my leg out to deter him from crossing again and again, but instead he just decided to step over me several times and stick his ass in our faces as we ate. RUDE. He had no problems yawning greatly through out our meal and just looked like a lame employee that didn't know what he was doing.\n\nThere was a manager there, but he didn't do anything about it. \n\nI will go back for their cheap and ok tasting burgers, but I'm getting it to go next time.", "author": "Foodie F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-30", "description": "I work in the Castro, and the usual places for lunch and occasional dinner were getting old.....Being a huge fan of the cheeseburger (if my body would let me I'd have one every day), I was happy to see there is a new place. Sliders got gross, Harvey's always overcooks their burgers (medium rare is always charred and never pink inside- I'm someone who never returns food but twice I've had to return the burgers for being charred well done when asking for medium rare), the Cove is good if you want a more home cooked thicker patty....Super Duper is great for when you're craving In n' Out, but don't want to go to the wharf of Daly City to get one...and it's got organic ingredients, so you may be having a sinful meal but at least it's not that sinful.....\n \nThe beef is Niman Ranch (no hormones, antibiotics, family ranchers own), and the burgers have that classic fast foodish taste- very close to In n' Out. The cream for the soft serve cones (I think they even have chocolate dipped) and milkshakes is Strauss ...organic from Petaluma. The lemonade is real lemonade, sweetened with brown sugar (more sour than sweet) ....They have portabella mushroom burgers and chicken sandwiches too. They even make their own pickles. They've got nice and salty fries, and offer them with parmesan cheese and garlic. You can also order a Racer 5 beer or another quality microbrew (in a pint glass on tap). The odd thing is that you pay 50 cents more for tomato, lettuce and onion, rather than cheese, so make sure you actually ask for those things because they don't come on the regular burgers or cheeseburgers. \n\nI've seen it be compared to Pearls and not fare that well in comparison...but as someone who loves Pearls and lived down the street for it..when I moved away three years ago I was spending around $20 on a buffalo burger fries and shake (and I'm sure by now the price has gone up), so I don't think it's fair to compare it to a place that costs quite a bit more. Also, i've seen a complaint or two about the employees not asking how the customer wants their meat cooked....If you don't take initiative and tell burger places how you want it cooked, it's standard to make them medium. So it's not the burger place's fault for not asking, if they don't ask, you should tell them, not blame it on them.\n\nI love this place and recommend it to my clients on almost a daily basis.    The staff is friendly...I still have to exercise a little self-control and not go that often because the burgers are dripping with grease....but I'm so happy this has moved into the neighborhood. The reasons I give this place four stars rather than five is that it is greasier than any fast food burger I've had, I've had once where my order was completely forgotten (but they were very apologetic about it which is what keeps me coming back and recommending it), and I still have times where people with identical orders get theirs first, which I find odd...on a lunch break from work I've got limited time....But I think that the ordering things are improving and will be fine as the place is open longer. I also was unaware of the 20% tip surcharge on card orders (I already tipped in cash, which means I tipped 40%!), and I think that the tip surcharge should be posted so we are aware of that- I understand why they do it (because some people are cheap and don't get how tip earning jobs work because they never had one)...it's just uncool to not notify the customer that's being added.  Yet, as I said I love this place and highly recommend it for it's food and friendly service.", "author": "Nick M."}

So lets rank this;\nThe shake came out first, and it was very well done. It taste like mushed up cocoa and thick milk thrown together. Its perfect, and a very nice introduction. \nThen the burger and fries came out, not a long wait at all. The burger was very greasy, a bit too much as your hand will defiantly get soaked. But nonetheless it was very well cooked. Its hard to criticize it, other than saying a little more seasoning would have helped. But unless you've had the best burger in the world you wouldnt have noticed.\nThe fries were nice as well, although a bit salty. Like near McDonalds salty, kinda much for a well done place. Also i tasted the cookies' and cream shake, and it tasted relly bad. Like just milk and weird chunks, wasnt thick enough. It could've just been that drink, and not all of them though. But i drunk my own shake around the same time and it was nice and thick so i doubt it melted.\nSo overall, if it werent for the bad cookies and cream and overly salty fries i'd give this a five star rating.", "author": "Darrell O."}

The fries are better, especially the garlic parmesean Yum!  Since i'm vegetarian I went with the portebello sandwich but it looks like a burger. It was not as good as shake shack's shroom burger in NYC but much healthier, and larger portions. I thought their brown sugar lemonade was a bit sweet, and have yet to taste their pecan pie but it sure looks nice. There is an upstairs and downstairs, and although there is a lot of seating, it fills up quick. I love their fresh home made pickles too! The place is pretty modern and aesthetically appealing, bright colors,  vintage prints, stainless steel and wood, kinda like chipotle but with more americana. I like the music here too. The only thing I would change are the paper towels, they are the harsh brown ones custodians use to clean up with, not good for wiping the corners of your mouth ouch, their manual ketchup pump was a bit overzealous, you pump it 2 or 3 times and it comes out with a vengeance when the pressure gets high enough. The staff were pretty friendly. I gave it 3 stars because it doesn't beat shake shack, mostly because their cheese didn't melt on the fried breaded mushroom and the cheese isn't as good and gooey as the one at shake shack, and I had to pay extra for that disappointment :(\n\n*************NO LONGER SELLS PORTOBELLO SANDWICH********************\nI told my friend in december that I liked super duper burger until they stopped selling their mushroom burger.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-14", "description": "Before we get started, I have to qualify this review by saying that Super Duper gets four stars for some things, but two stars for others, giving it an overall \"I'd go back\" for the things it does really well, and I'd opt to skip the rest. Here's the long and short: if you're hungry for a well crafted, relatively inexpensive burger accompanied by crisp, truly flavorful fresh fries for about eight bucks in the Castro (where you can also dine al fresco) then go for Super Duper. You can add bacon to any sandwich.\n\nWhat you'll get is a pink (not gray) in the center, juicy burger crowned with fresh snappy lettuce (as well as the rest of the usual topper options) sandwiched on an unrepentantly white starch, sesame studded bun. The burger isn't as big and flavorful as one of those out of control Mission Burger burgers, but this is a quality burger, not the dumbed down, dreaded hockey puck. Many people have compared SD to In N Out, but I would propose that Taylor's Refresher is a more apt comparison, and SD is less expensive. Only one piece of advice: skip the unfortunately namby-pamby iced tea and do the lemonade. They're both house made. Finally, take the overly assertive home-cured pickles under advisement, they're a little too fermented (mine were almost fizzy). If you want more detail, read on. Keep in mind, your choices for burgers in this price range in the neighborhood mostly SUCK by comparison (e.g. Bagdad Cafe, Cafe Flore, and that crazy place with the merry go round grill on Castro street that I've never tried but I've heard isn't very good).\n\nMany reviews have compared this restaurant, unfairly in my opinion, to In N Out. This is not a chain, and there's a lot of care put into what they do. A more apt comparison, I think, would be Taylor's Refresher.  Brought to you by the same folks who put together Beretta and Starbelly, SD is taking a whack at the road side burger stand that none of us can actually remember, but we're all sure must have been there at one point before the big chains ruined it for everyone. I had a very good burger: it was a perfect medium, actually pink in the middle rather than the uniform grey we've been led to expect, and best of all, it was full-fat juicy.  It's not the most flavorful beef in the world (compared to many of the other double digit burgers at Mission Burger, Starbelly or Chow) but then again, it was only four bucks! \n\nI also loved the fact that all the disposables at SD are compostable. Meals are served on (Taylor's Refresher-style) aluminum quarter sheet pans lined with parchment instead of throw-away plates. They use compostable corn-plastic cups, the fries are served in those familiar, joyous red and white paper french fry trays that I never get tired of. The ketchup and mustard, which you pump yourself, goes into equally compostable tiny paper cups (the kind they use in prison to organize medications). The napkins aren't napkins, they're gas-station paper towels, which is fine with me if it's better for the environment. All the trash bins are green.\n\nMy biggest disappointment was the iced tea and pickles. I should have gone with Coke, which would have been appropriate to the restaurant's vibe, but unfortunately I would have had to pump is out of one of those detestable 7-Eleven style soda fountains. If I were SD, I would consider glass bottles and frosty pint glasses. Or at least find a soda fountain that isn't made of black petroleum products.", "author": "Benjamin K."}

I live in the neighborhood and I think this is a very welcome addition.\n\n My dining companion and I had read the reviews here before trying it out, so we came in with a healthy critical eye. We both had the Superburger and the regular fries. I thought the price was really good for the quality of the meat, and the burger was well constructed. As a pretty big fan of In-N-Out (the only burger at this price point that I will eat) I couldn't help but compare. This is a more straightforward burger than my Animal Style at In-N-Out, but the flavor was fantastic. The Superburger also had probably double the meat, which made for a better flavor profile-the meatiness is central.  It's a very classic, nicely crafted cheeseburger that's honestly more comparable to and probably better than Taylor's (or whatever their new name is) than it is to In-N-Out, but at an In-N-Out price. We ordered two cheeseburgers, two orders of fries, a beer and an Iced Tea and it came to just under $20. I like that!\n\nThe fries were tasty and hot, but seemed like they had been reheated or overcooked as they were a little darker and crispier than they should have been. If the fries could be made fresh, there is nothing I would change about the food. It was that good. \n\nThe place definitely seemed unfinished design-wise, but I like what they've got going on so far.\n\n!!!!***Two bonuses: fresh housemade pickles! and beer on tap!!!!***\n\n I like the direction they're going and I'm glad they're in my 'hood.", "author": "C Z."}

There was a group of 5 toddlers enjoying their soft serve ice creams right next to us. I started it off with the portobello sandwich with aged jack cheese...um yum! And my bf had the house special, the super duper burger and an order of the regular fries. My meat eater of a boyfriend tried my portobello and actually thoroughly enjoyed it! SHOCKING I know! I liked the size of the burgers as it wasn't overwhelming and left you feeling satisfied not stuffed...but then came dessert.\n\nThe super duper friendly manager/maybe owner? Luis brought us out two samples of the desserts. Which was awfully nice of him! One was the pecan pie soft serve sundae and the other was the strawberries and honey soft serve sundae. Both were scrumptious and made us want to order a dessert of our own! Dang you Luis! So I had the vanilla and chocolate swirl soft serve cone dipped in chocolate and the bf was a little more adventurous and went for the chocolate chip cookie and bacon sundae. In his exact words of why he tried it: \"I love bacon, I love ice cream, and I love chocolate chip cookies\". Haha. Mine was good, but definitely not worth making an extra trip back for. And his bacon was a little burnt so it didn't have the salty taste that it should have had. But when he mentioned that to Luis, he showed up with another sample serving of the bacon sundae with the bacon cooked just right! Now that's customer service! And sure enough, my guy finished that serving as well.... because hey, it would be rude not to, right?!\n\nAnywho, I highly recommend this place if you're craving a healthy style burger!

I was not excited about this at all, but the way it was breaded really made it feel more substantial than your typical veggie sandwhich. I still wish they offered a good homemade veggie patty though. There aren't many options for cheese and things like that yet. My milkshake was tasty but not thick at all, closer to strawberry milk as another reviewer has stated.

The prices were good. $4.25 for a cheese burger however if you want lettuce and tomato you pay extra .50 cents ( I thought lettuce and tomato was a staple in the burger?) The fries were $2.25 . Didn't wait long at all for my order.  Both the burger and fries were very tasty and you get lots of fries. They also serve beer and ice cream for desert. I had burger , fry and ice tea for under $10.00 not bad. They stay open until 11pm.  I am sure they will receive lots of hungry people that have been drinking at the nearby bars. It was OK, I don't know why they displaced Pasta Pomodero that place was always crowded. I will go again if I am in the neighborhood.", "author": "Susie S."}

I've been there three times already, twice for burgers and once for a chocolate dipped cone.\n\nFood/Drink:\nThe burgers are great, I usually get the double. They're cooked perfectly and even the double doesn't make me feel \"gross\" like a lot of establishments that specialize in burgers. \n\nThe fries are mighty tasty and I enjoy the parmesan cheese variant. \n\nThe ice cream is stellar. The soft-serve choco-dipped cones are to die for and the sundaes are spectacular too. \n\nI love that they have beer on tap. I've had the lemonade once, wasn't quite sweet enough for me, but wasn't half bad. \n\nThe Service:\nExcellent. The manager/owner dropped by last time we were there and asked us how everything was. After we ordered sundaes he brought out a small sample for us to try of the third type of sundae which we hadn't ordered, it was as tasty as the other two. The second we left I looked back and they were already cleaning our table- don't understand the cleanliness gripes from other yelpers.\n\nThe Decor:\nIt's easy to order and we've never had a problem finding a seat. I really don't understand the people knocking this place on the \"plywood\" style walls. It's an interesting choice and I don't think it inhibits the experience. If you're looking for something a little more classy, why not try Berretta or Starbelly, which is right across the street.

I ordered the Mini-Burger combo - but the burger really isn't Mini - think more of a standard 1/4-1/3 pounder and you'll have a better visual.  They have a double version of this, but that is more food than I need especially after a workout.  So let's start with the burger -  toasted bun, very good, meat - thick and juicy and each one is hand made  - they said expect a 10 min wait, but mine was up within 3-5, so the must have had some ready to go, still a really good made-to-order burger.  Think 5 Guys, which I haven't seen yet in the Bay area, but I was a loyal follower back in Ohio.  You can choose what you want from a decent list of toppings including Super Sauce - probably like Big Mac, not sure what was in it.  For $1 more you can get more things added and there is also an up-charge for cheese (I went without) to get the real taste of the meat.  The combo comes with regular fries, which looked homemade, but they were a little card-board like - not bad, but I've had better at both 5 Guys and In-n-Out Burger.  Even McDonalds are better.  You can also order some dipping sauces for these for an extra $1.  I saw a lot of the garlic and cheese fries coming out to tables and if I go back (and I will) I will make sure I order some of those - the garlic smell was very powerful and they just looked great.  It seems SFO like their garlic as we are close to a city that has a festival every year.  Diet Coke from the fountain rounded out the combo.  Napkins are like something you might see in a cheap washroom, kind of scratchy, but they did the job.  I'd like to try their homemade lemonade on the next trip with brown sugar, that looked really tasty.  Seating area is crowded and not very fancy, but that is the whole experience, it's really about the burger, nothing about the experience in the location to talk about, but the lines to get in and find a seat say this is worth a repeat visit.", "author": "Steve A."}

So I checked my online banking statement and low and behold the ass behind the counter did the exact same thing to me.  DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE STOLEN FROM. Even if you pay in cash , you are supporting a group of thieves. We don't need to support dishonest merchants. I hope the Castro Merchant's Association catches these guys in their game soon.

And you know how on most burgers the avocado falls off and or there isn't enough by your last bite....not true here. My brother had the 8oz with bacon. The natural juices nice, warm, and  perfectly clear! A wonderful piece of meat. I have not eaten meat for a about two months. This did not hurt, turn, upset my tummy or give me any sort of sickness or discomfort. This was a perfect place to go to get my 1st bite of meat after not having any. \nThey have two beers on tap and a few options of wine.(better get enough for your meal as the line is consistently thick) But the selection compliments their burgers very well. \nI had the opportunity to speak to one of the owners. The meat is brought in everyday. The sauces are homemade & the only thing not made in house is the soft serve ice cream. Everything else is in house.

Decadent, guilt-producing indulgence in the form of a Super Duper Burger with shoe string fries and fresh lemonade or a milkshake for ultra-decadent guilt.  The Super Duper burgers are flavorful and delicious, the lemonade ideal, the milkshakes to die for and the french fries perfect!  (Familiar with the book \"How to Read a French Fry\"?)  The portions are generous for the price.  (I can't even finish a Super Duper burger in one sitting.)  The place is impeccably clean, including the lavatory, and service is friendly and prompt.  If you have a hankering for a good burger, it's worth the trek across town and close to Muni!", "author": "Tug M."}

Well, the burger is on the small side, maybe I should of ordered the double \"duper\"; however, with the single I wasn't completely impressed.  Mind you, it is decent, but does not match the name of the joint.  At the same time, their fries are YUMMY - and it's a generous serving!  I also ordered their shake which was also good, but on the skimpy end - volume-wise.  All in all, I like the place - it is on the tiny end, but there is limited sidewalk seating which will be great when the days are super warm.  Lastly it deserves good marks because it's very economical during these tough times it nice to see establishments offer a good meal for a reasonable price - and Super Duper Burger does just that.  I'd also recommend this joint for a first date, hell if the date is going south, one can always scope out the boys leaving Golds across the street.  Next time, I'll try their chicken sandwich.

My husband and I came here today despite the weak reviews to try the place out. I order a \"Burger\" with everything on it and no tomato. He ordered a \"Super Burger\" with extra grilled onions and bacon. What we received was, Me: A \"Super Burget with extra grilled onions and everything on it, including a tomato (to which I am allergic)\" and Hubby got: A \"Burger\" with lots of raw onions. When I complained that they messed up both of our orders, the girl at the counter looked at me blankly. They gave my husband a new burger, or rather took off the raw onions and added grilled, but still no bacon in sight. OH! and refused to give him the \"Super\" he ordered, because they mistakenly made mine a \"Super\". I was forced to give him one of my patties. Nonetheless, I am never going here again. Waste of $20.", "author": "Gabriella M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-23", "description": "Great burgers! Very tasty and innovative food combinations, fast & friendly service. Yes, the food is more expensive than McDs, but considering the prime ingredients used I think the price is very reasonable - less than a burger at a restaurant ,such as a Zuni burger - another of my favourites. The complimentary homemade pickles are a nice extra touch. I had a memorable fresh strawberry shake and some garlic fries as well.  My girlfriend had a chicken sandwich which she said was great.  It was almost like a blackened chicken sandwich with a Mexican marinade and served with some fab chipotle sauce.   All in all, everything far exceeded our expectations especially for such reasonable prices.  I think the only thing that is a concern is that parking in this area can be a pain at peak hours.", "author": "John H."}

Luckily I had a half of a tomato in the fridge to augment the otherwise plain (I think there was some \"special sauce\" on there, but the amount was so minute, I'm not sure) and greasy burger. I know that a previous reviewer said the greasiness that many wrote about came from the cheese, I have to disagree. Orphan Andy's delivers a far superior burger and fries!", "author": "Jennifer K."}

Its simply really nice to have a decent burger place with moderate prices that has really great customer service. Nothing is better than being greeted and noticed by the cordial girls always taking orders. They always check in with us half way through to see if everything was ok, which I love. The only thing I might advise is if you are looking for a huge man burger, you might want something else. The burgers aren't huge, more they are appropriately sized. Overall lovely fun experience.", "author": "Jay S."}

Its surprising considering how long the lines are out the door to this place. i wouldn't say this food was horrible tasting but there is nothing special about it at all. i would have rather gone down the street to burgermeister on church. they make a decent burger and have a lot more selection for a chain restaurant. we also ordered the garlic fries which were nowhere close to a place like gordon biersch for garlic fries. actually, i've even had better garlic fries at smart alec in berkeley and those are baked and healthy for you. overall, I don't think I'm going to be coming back here when I have so many other choices in the city for food. I'm glad that they serve alcohol. maybe that will make the food taste better for me next time! I didn't try the milk shake even though I heard some reviewers rave about it. I gotta say the prices were not too bad for a \"so so\" meal. More than anything else, I'd rather have gone to In-n-out for a much more satisfying burger experience.", "author": "Bryant L."}

I do however, as much as I enjoyed my cheeseburger was very disappointed in the actual size of the burger.  Seemed to be about the size of something I could get at a fast food outlet. It tasted very nice,  I also was not sold on how super the Super sauce was,  not much there.  I should also add that I thought that the service was fine,  and enjoyed the space.", "author": "tom s."}

For what it claims to be, a basic burger barn, it's fine.  I had the small basic cheeseburger and fries, both of which were very good.  The burger is small enough to eat handily without it exploding everywhere.  Who says portions of everything have to be gargantuan...that's why America is so fat now.  The French fries were hot, crispy, and delicious, AND...they even have milk (not on the menu, but if you ask for it they will provide.)  It offers a great value for the money and an alternative to McDonalds (at one end) or Burger Bar (at the other end.)  It's almost like a neighbourhood In'n'Out.", "author": "Tom R."}

The Fries were a total loss, they tasted like all pre frozen fries which are heated just before serving. The outside was crisp and the inside was overdone yesterday.Making real fries would totally change the feeling of the food. Ill try it again but it feels like a fast food palace with nowhere to go but downhill.  Ill go back for the beer!", "author": "carmine g."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-05-16", "description": "Superduper might have chosen their name more carefully.  There is serious room for improvement.  The atmosphere feels strangely clinical and unfinished, yet modern.  The highlight of the meal came with the efficient service and the tasty pickle.  I was a little distraught that they did not keep mayo out for fries.  My partner and I both ordered the Double Superburger.  It was greasy as many others have said, and I don't mind greasy.  The bun was the biggest problem having zero character, and additionally, it was not toasted which might have helped balance the grease.  There was very little sauce that I could discern, and so the burger had to basically stand on it's Niman ranch legs and they were not strong enough to hold it up.  The garlic-cheese fries were also not something particularly good.  The fries were cooked correctly from what I remember, but there was very little garlic, and the parmesean tasted pretty cheap and was way overdone.  Honestly, the entire shop stank of that cheap parmesean giving it a slight funk.  I'll admit that I didn't try the soft serve, but I've had Straus soft serve, but it's not necessarily something unique to this establishment.", "author": "Chris F."}
