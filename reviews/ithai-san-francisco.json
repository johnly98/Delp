The soup was pretty good. But the at the price of $17 (including tax) for one order of soup, the prices definitely do not match what is displayed on their website! \n\nThe next time I ordered pad thai, Penang curry with short rib (per recommendation), papaya salad with crab, and again the same soup. The food was nasty and mostly ended up thrown away! The pad thai was noodles slathered in oil but no actual sauce of any kind. The Penang curry nuts that had rotted!

Their food always tastes good and portions are always big. Thai food is usually overpriced but I think this place has it at a decent price. The reason why I'm giving it three stars is because of the service I encountered today. My friend and I walked in at an awkward time around 5pm so there was literally no one in there. When we walked in, we weren't greeted or anything, nor did the lady in the front acknowledge us till we said hi. Ummm what the heck??? She then told us to sit wherever we liked so we sat down and she brought the menu over to us right after. I already knew what I wanted and so did my friend, so we waited for her to come back to our table to take our order. I literally had to say three times \"I'm ready to order!\" for her to come to us. I have no idea what she was doing because hello, we were the only ones in the restaurant until later. Besides this rude service, I enjoyed the food like I always do!! I will of course still come back because it's my favorite Thai restaurant. It's just weird because service is usually on point besides today.", "author": "Lisa W."}

Also, this place is super dark on the inside. Feels like I'm at the club (there's also a small stage in the rear of the restaurant). I could barely read the menu. What I could read resulted in me ordering the fish cakes appetizer and shrimp pad Thai. I didn't like the fish cakes. The texture was a bit too soft for me, and a bit, well, FISHY! \n\nThe pad Thai was alright, but they put dried shrimps in as well, and I found those to be a bit chewy.

I got the drunken noodles with chicken and those noodles were absolutely devine, perfectly cooked and just too good. The Thai iced tea was pretty standard but an excellent compliment to an otherwise fantastic meal. My friends felt the same way, I'd definitely come back. I wish I lived in SF so I could get this stuff more often. The menu states specific meats but like most Thai places they make it to cater to the customer. Don't be afraid, ask for spicy!", "author": "Rohit S."}

We ordered and got it very timely.  Everything was fresh and good.  Had tofu triangles-the sauce was a bit too runny and was just about the same suace we had with our curry- I guess I was expecting more than just bland fried tofu, they should cook it in a seasoning. \n\n The roti (which was really Indian paratha) was very tasty, flaky and chewy!  The green veg curry was great.  I only thing I forgot to request was extra bowl as we were in a hotel and didnt have any dishes.  Totally recommend.  Thank you", "author": "Kimberly C."}

We're pretty obsessed.\nAnd this place is where the thais go around here.\n\nI started going through their menu one by one, and I was blown away. I still haven't eaten them all. Because I liked some so much I just kept ordering it.\n\n\nHere's some tips:\n\nTheir Giew Tod was extra crunchy, and goes pretty darn well with the noodles.\nTalking about noodles, the soup of their Guai jub was a very pleasant surprise of rolled noodles with crunchy pork bits, and their Kao Soi is great if you want a taste of curry on your noodles. It's a dish famous in the northern parts of Thailand.\n\nI love their Ka moo, It's juicy pork leg on sauced rice. (you can probably ask them for more or less fat pieces if you prefer) It's also a good indication that their \"Kao na ped\" will taste pretty good.\n\nKao mun gai, It's chicken with flavored rice. It's the thai street food we grew up with. This and the Pad Krapaos are the \"I don't know what to eat\" standard dishes.\n\nHungry and need something fast? Their pad see ew moo gets done, It's practically our fast food dish. it's lightly seared soft noodles flavoured with sauce and pork.\n\nI really like their pork lately, It's not dry like many other places, So I'd recommend their pork fried rice, too\n\nFor less \"usual\" things, Their pla duk fu is crunchy and classier than most of the pla duk fus i had.\nAnd if you want beef, Their Sur rong hai is tasty as heck.

We sat at 9:15pm and they were really nice but, it took a while for them to take our order ( there was maybe 6 tables and a lot of to go orders lined up for UberEats).  When they did take our order, we got our drinks right away.  The egg roll appetizer came at 9:40.  The problem came when I asked at 10:15pm if the food was coming.  The first girl said she would check but never came back to us to give a reply.  So at 10:20 when we got the wings we ordered, I asked the guy who brought it out about the rest of our food.  He went to the back and didn't return without the food. At 10:30pm, we received the fried rice that we were anxious for.  It was horrible.  The rice was cooked with too much water so it had a oatmeal consistency and there was no seasoning at all.  Not sure what happened tonight but, we paid quickly and left. They didn't charge us for the rice but, we certainly were not happy to have wasted so much time waiting for that!

They cut it into six small pieces, and the filling would come out when you pick it up. The sauce that came with it was overly sweet. Missed the peanut sauce.

SO good. \nI haven't had Thai food in a while and I've been craving it and I got the perfect meal. Only $20 for mixed veggies (perfectly cooked), egg rolls and Kao Mun Gai Tod. It was a crusted piece of chicken over some white rice. And it all came with some sweet and spicy chili sauce. I was in heaven. The delivery was quicker than expected (40ish minutes). \n\nThe best part was that they knew what they were doing in delivery. My chicken was breaded and usually when you get delivery on a breaded item, the steam get trapped and makes everything soggy. But their genius idea was to cut a hole in the top of the cover and it was perfect! My chicken was still crispy and delicious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-29", "description": "Filipinos, come eat here. Startup workers and post-hipsters, come eat here. Ghost of Steve Jobs, come eat here. This place certainly has the \"i\" part down, with the brushed aluminum on white themed interior and OS X window buttons on the menu. The music is largely straight-up club, and there's a curtained stage at the back as a hint of the future of this establishment. Bring your air guitar.\n\nThe menu has items you've seen at other Thai places. Two sections that may have surprises for you are \"Something Specials\" and \"I'm Adventurous\". Turns out that being adventurous means being Filipino, with regard to the chicharr\u00f3n fried rice and the bagook x green mango dishes. At least, those were the images that came to mind when reading over the descriptions for \"Kao Pad Kark Moo\" (\"Ultimate iThai fried rice with crispy pork skin, carrots, onions, and egg\") and \"Kao Klook Gapi\" (\"Shrimp paste rice with side of sour mango, sweet pork, egg strips, sun dried shrimps\").\n\nThe KPKM pork skin was less rind and more skin + fat layer + meat, kind of like bacon's older brother who happens to play varsity football. Cucumber slices garnished the plate, but the carrots, onions, and egg were absent. Since we'd only ordered this dish to try the pork skin, perhaps it's better that no other ingredients got in the way.\n\nThe KKG shrimp paste, nam plik, was a subtler and less salty version of bagook with the tiny shrimps ground up. Rather than a tongue assault like Korean saeujeot (which primarily isn't intended as a condiment anyway), the nam plik was dippable, spreadable, and overall more approachable as a table item. The sour mango was pickled, which was a new concept to me - I thought it would be green (unripe) mango.\n\nWe also had \"Keaw Wan Roti\" for some Indian influence, and its curry unexpectedly included makla (likely incorrect spelling), a small and round Thai eggplant.\n\nRounding out our set was a carafe of \"Cloudy in Bangkok\", similar to Korean yogurt soju. Ordering the carafe instead of a glass seemed like a good move because the contents were somehow just enough for the accompanying cocktail-sized cup. But how big would the glass have been? If the glass would've been similar to the cup, we shouldn't have opted for the carafe at twice the price. You may want to ask to see the vessels before making your choice.\n\nOur meal was interesting and our servers were friendly. Oddly enough though, for being named \"iThai\", there weren't a bunch of outlets for plugging in MacBooks to work while eating. All in all, this is one of those places that I want to rate well because I liked it but want to rate poorly so it won't be popular and overcrowded next time we go. I can picture it filling up with Academy of Art students.", "author": "Dan B."}

What I do know is.. they are one of my fave thai food to go :) \n\nKao Mun Gai Tod: Crispy fried chicken over garlic rice with sweet chili sauce\n- The garlic rice itself has this authentic Hainanese chicken taste. I'd definitely order this when I have cravings for hainanese chicken cause it's the closest taste to the one I had in Singapore. \n-Crispy chicken could be a little more tender but its ok since its always crispy when it arrives.\n\nCrab Curry: Yellow curry with crab.\nMmm because its creamy for sure! Its a little sweet but not bad. I love how they add egg. They add a reasonable amount of crab. A hint of spicy would make it more awesome! \n\nPad See-Ew Moo: Pan fried white noodle with thai black bean sauce. A pretty perfect balance between noodles, chinese broccolli, egg and pork. Its very flavorful but it does get a little salty after awhile but still really good! \n\nKha Soi: Red curry with marinated meat. \nBeef or chicken? I say chicken cause the beef is not as tender and a little too chewy for me. The noodle and crispy noodle is really delish! I'd rather eat this with rice than actually eat it like soup because the curry acts more of a gravy. \n\nLast but not least you can never go wrong with thai ice tea :) \n\nAs long as they're nice when they deliver and they don't take more than an hour for delivery then yes I'll mos def order here again!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-21", "description": "I decided to try iThai again a couple of weeks ago after not eating here for several months.  When I stopped coming here, renovations to the places had recently started and the quality of many of the dishes had gone down to my disappointment.\n\nI told myself that I would eventually come back to see if the quality improves, especially since there were a few items that either they offered only, or did better than other Thai restaurants.\n\nI've been here about 5 times in the past 2 weeks trying (again) some of the dishes I was found of here.  The verdict?  Quality has much improved.\n\nOne of the first things I ordered was Kao Mok Gai (Herbed chicken with curried rice). The flavor was about as good as I remembered it should be, the only difference is the chicken is boneless now, which I'm a little bummed about since I like gnawing on the grizzle on the bone (must be the Asian in me).  I see few other Thai restaurants serving this dish as well.\n\nSecond visit was Yum Pla Dook Foo (Crispy catfish salad).  Nothing wrong here. Good vegetable to fish ratio, fried fish didn't get soggy quickly, and seasoning was great, though I could have gone spicier.\n\nAlso, ordered was Gui Chai (fried chive dumplings). This dish has always been good. It doesn't taste like it's burnt or been cooked in old oil like some other places.\n\nThird visit was Kao Pad Moo Kark (Fried rice with crispy pork skin). This was one of the dishes I initially liked most because the only other place that I've had it is in Thailand.  It's actually a pretty simple dish; well seasoned fried rice with crispy pork skin... and some pork belly.  Mind you, the emphasis on this dish should be on pork skin, not pork meat.  And really no one should be complaining that they got served only pork skin.\n\nThe dish was almost as good as when I first ordered it here.  My main complaint is the rice was a bit on the greasy side, even for a dish that is basically fried pork skin and fried pork fat.\n\nMy latest visit here, I had Koh Moo Yang (pork shoulder w/ tamarind sauce).  Nothing necessarily wrong with this dish, I just wasn't very impressed with it. Perhaps, I just wasn't in the mood for this dish like I thought.  The pork had good flavor and was tender.  The tamarind sauce was a bit sweeter than I expected and not as spicy as expected either. Maybe that's why I'm indifferent toward this dish. Anyhow, not a bad dish, just not my dish (at least not on that night).\n\nOther thoughts?\nThe makeover is nice.  The chairs are much nicer and more comfortable.  Some items have been removed from the menu, like Bamee Jup Kang (an egg noodle soup with pork), which I'm disappointed about.\n\nOverall, I'll probably continuing coming back here (again).  And they still have late night karaoke, and a live band on Fridays which is another thing I like.", "author": "Dennis Z."}

I had to order a side of rice just to finish it. And afterwards my mouth still felt a salty after taste from the dish.", "author": "Jon C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-11-17", "description": "iThai suffers from being the new kid in a neighborhood, with a confused concept and a dozen or two other Thai restaurants in the neighborhood.\n\nFirst the food, which is the standout. All of the dishes I've had here had decent ingredients and were well prepared, with a complexity and depth of flavor two notches above a basic neighborhood Thai spot: the sauces were not sweet or gloppy, the noodles not overcooked, the seafood tasted fresher, and lots of stuff had a good sear on it and was prepped by somebody who knows how to use a knife. The menu is extensive and varied, not just the usual stuff: a whole large wok-fried squid, pork shoulder salad, beef stew with tamarind broth, interesting stuff.\n\nAlthough priced at or lower the more popular places nearby, with better food, it's not as busy as it should be, I guess they haven't got the message across yet. The name and sleek-ish decor are on obvious homage to Apple, I think they're trying unsuccessfully to appeal to a young urban crowd. But then there's a stage in the back, little used, that seems setup for karaoke or something. A few months ago they wisely took all the English names off the menu, painful attempts to be cute, and replaced them with proper Thai names. Whatever it is, it's not unpleasant but I'm just not feeling it. Oh well, they're friendly, the price is right, and the food is very tasty, that's enough for me.", "author": "Gil S."}

This restaurant was near the hostel I was staying at, so I walked in after trekking around in the rain for somewhere to eat, preferably something savory. I asked the hostess if there was room for me, one person. From what I saw, it was hopping but not packed like sardines. She said yes and took me to an empty table. I sat down and waited for a server to come over to ask what I wanted to drink. A couple of minutes went by and nothing, so I pulled out my phone to entertain myself until somebody came over. Five to ten minutes later, nobody came over to my area, so I left. This was one of the worst customer service experiences that I had.", "author": "Gloria A."}

So I live in San Jose, and the first time my cousins and I came here, it was just a place we stumbled upon. At first we were headed towards Farm Table, a small and very expensive (although very good) cafe just a couple doors up Post St., but for being a little too expensive for a small portion, some of us didn't buy anything and some did but were still hungry after. So we decided to go to iThai. That was all it took for us to like this place.....\n\n\nSo yesterday, our whole family decided to go to SF and to see if this place was really a good and consistent place, we decided to go here again. Parking of course was nonexistent and eventually found some 2 blocks up Post. Anyway, this is what we ordered (well what I tried anyway): \n\n-spicy basil chicken: I order this one, I asked for medium spicy & sub minced meat for pieces of meat. This was by far one of the most delicious basil chicken dishes I have had. The chicken was tender, the sauce was delicious, the peppers were cooked very well. The only downside is that it wasn't medium hot in which I had to add more chili.\n\n-tom yum chicken w/o coconut meat: I also ordered this one, which I asked for medium spicy as well. Again it wasn't medium spicy or spicy at all, but it was very delicious. It wasn't too sweet or too tart. I've had better but this came really close. \n\n-papaya salad: First off, I never liked papaya salad, but this one changed me. Very good. \n\n-Pad Thai thai hot: my mom got this one and she said it wasn't at all thai hot, which she then added loads of chili. She said it was too sweet, and that it had too much fish sauce in it, but was good. \n\n-Pad Kee Mao: This one was good. The bell peppers were really soft and tender, the basil made the dish. \n\n-Kao Mun Gai: The rice was very good. \n\nOverall a very excellent thai place. The spicy levels needs work, but I definitely recommend trying this place if you ever go to SF and are tired of the same pier 39 foods. :) \n\nP.S You should come to San Jose! We need a good Thai place! You would have a regular. :D", "author": "Jennifer G."}

You read right, the glasses were dirty. Starving and unfamiliar with the restaurants in the area, and parking meter ticking, we opted to put our disgust aside and hope for good food.\n\nWhile waiting for food I visited the restroom, which was fair on the cleanliness scale. That's also when I discovered, entering the hall to the restoom, sat glasses of water on a tray, ready to be served. They weren't near the restroom, but it's still gross.\n\nThe food took at least 30 minutes, despite there being only two other parties of two seated during the wait. Not only that, but several minutes passed between the first dishes brought out and the last. In fact, my meal was last, and nearly 8 minutes behind the first plate. Since their food was getting cold I insisted the others begin.\n\nThankfully, my dish of chicken on garlic rice was hot and tasty. In all the food was good, with the exception of the beef in the curry dish, which was described as rubbery and unedible. The presentation was also very good.\n\nDespite the food being a mostly good to very good,  the other factors ruined the experience.

There was a menu posted to the right of the door so I browsed for a few minutes to decide what I want to base my review on, tough between my favorite pad kee mao or the enticing lunch specials for dine-in only (11-3pm daily including weekends!).\n\nFinally I walked in to be greeted after 30 seconds by staff inside the kitchen. I was going to get take-out and eat in the mall but I sat down and ordered the lunch specials anyway. My meal was the $9.95 lunch special-\n1) appetizer: chicken satay (2 skewers)\n2) spicy basil chicken with rice\n\nThe order was taken down on an iPad, very fitting. And there is free Wi-fi.\n\nA Yelp check-in entitled me to a free Thai iced tea. I was delighted to drink that in addition to the house soup included with the lunch special! The soup was a bit cold, probably because it was sitting out but it contained a good combination of broccoli and pepper, at least. Because I was the only one there, the food came out in a timely manner, roughly 5 minutes after the soup. The mini appetizer was served on the same plate as the entree.\n\nThe chicken satay skewers were yummy and the peanut sauce was not overpowering like other Thai establishments. I hoped for more meat or one more skewer for an appetizer but oh well. The spicy basil chicken was flavorful with the white rice. The portion size was appropriate but isn't enough to fill my stomach. However, I am on a smaller diet so it's justifiable this time.\n\nThe restroom was pretty average. Another Yelper mentioned usage of LEDs but I didn't see any at first.

The deal is $24 with two cocktails, one appetizer and two main dishes.  Pretty good!  So we decided to check out this place.  \n\nWe came here on a Tuesday around 5:30pm and we were the first table there.  I thought it was kinda of early but we left at 7pm and the restaurant was still empty.........\n\nThe service was pretty nice.  The girls were very friendly and helpful.  \n\nWe ordered:\n\nGreen papaya - Very standard, nothing special.\n\nPo-Taak (Soup) - Spicy and sour soup with assorted seafood, mushroom, basil, and lime.  We asked for mild and it was not too spicy.  It tasted good.  The seafood was mostly calamari and mushroom.  \n\nPumpkin Curry -  Red curry with prawns, pumpkin, bell peppers, and onions.  This was my favorite dish of the night.  The curry was very creamy and flavorful.  \n\nKao Na Ped - Roasted duck over rice with brown gravy sauce.  The duck was good.  Very tender but the rice was little bit too soft.\n\nWe also ordered two cocktails (forgot the names) and the drinks were not impressive.  \n\nSince we ordered one more dish, so we needed to pay full price for the extra dish.

The only reason my post was so short, was because the experience was so... for lack of a better word... disgusting, that I didn't care to post more.  Here was my old post \"I really wanted to like you because I live so close... but gross. Sorry.\"\n\nSo you want more details of why I gave you only one star, well here you go:\n\nMy boyfriend and I went into the restaurant because the place had opened down the street from where we live and it looked cool.  The colors/decor were neat and it seemed to be a quite popular with a full crowd.  Alas, like many restaurants who are... as Cher would put it \"a full on monet,\" we waited for the hype to calm and decided to try the food.  Here is what we ordered:\n\n1. Tom Yum Noodle Soup.  It was bland and not at all favorable. The fish balls were tough and honestly uneatable.  The broth was super boring and I felt like the quality overall was a one star on a grade of 1-5. I ate only two bites of it and had had enough. It's VERY RARE that I order a dinner and can't muster myself to eat more than a couple of bites.\n\n2. My boyfriend had the iThai Seafood Noodles.  The mussels were small, dinky and frankly we thought the quality of them might make is ill.  We tried it anyway and confirmed our initial conclusion - they were gross. Secondly, the shrimp - omg where did you get the shrimp?  It was SUPER tough and flavorless. My boyfriend and I both tried a couple of bites and had enough.\n\nThe server was SUPER sweet however, and we kindly asked for containers to-go. We packaged up our food and gave it to a homeless person on our way out.  We then proceeded to another restaurant to order dinner AGAIN!!! What a waste of money.  I honestly even felt a little bad giving that food to the homeless man.\n\nI guess my point here is that I didn't want to spend the time going into why the place was gross - it just was.  Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes?  Look, we walk past your restaurant multiple times a day - there is a reason why it is always empty.    \n\nI'm sorry iThai.  I'm a legitimate customer with a legitimate reason to post what I posted and what I'm posting now.  People deserve to know if they're going to spend $40+ on a dinner that is flavorless and poor quality.  Hey - at least our beer was good = 1 STAR.\n\nIf you want to receive better reviews, then fork out a little more for better quality.  THEN we might return and THEN I might change my review - which I have done for many other restaurants in the past.", "author": "Noneya B."}

I ended up placing an order for their iThai Seafood noodles, an order of Kra Tiam Nuer, and a portion of Jasmine rice. I placed my order at 9:56 PM on a Saturday night, and received it a little over an hour later.\n\nWhile I was a bit disappointing in the time for delivery, the order arrived complete, the delivery guy seemed friendly enough, and the food piping hot. Out of the whole order, I enjoyed the seafood noodles the most. I'm a really big fan of garlic and the noodles hit the spot; the clams and shrimp were also cooked well and the basil added an interesting flavor to the garlic noodles. As for the beef dish, it was a bit blander than my liking, but it went down well with the jasmine rice. \n\nOverall, the delivery experience was pretty straightforward.

This time, I really wanted vegetable curry, because the description of mixed veggies sounded far more enticing than the other, but I asked the server if it was possible to get chicken in with it. After a bit of careful questioning and explaining, I ordered the veggie curry with chicken and learned it came with a variety of mushrooms, eggplant (holy moly the combo was good this round!), red peppers and other your normal usuals, like bamboo shoots, green peppers and tofu. The serving of chicken that came with it was bountiful, and I was bit surprised and elated. I ordered hot tea as usual and what a flavor and color, amber orange with a delightful, robust flavor. Even the rice came on a separate plate so nicely shaped: it looked like a tower. All of the flavors felt and tasted fresh and nourishing.

I also got some spring rolls, I really don't like tofu and I'm used to getting Shrimp fresh rolls but these were just okay they are made so that they fall apart after one bite and it's mostly full of noodles so not much flavor.  If they added more cucumber and less carrots and some shrimp they would be much better.  I also like peanut sauce over tamarind but had to pay $2 extra for it and got more sauce than I had rolls for all I wanted was a tiny side to dip in.  Everything else here seemed really good.  only thing I have yet to try are their curries but I assume they will be good.

I have been craving sweet sticky rice with mango, and took a chance on this place instead of ordering from After Osha like I should have (best mango sticky rice ever for the same price). They called a bit after I placed my order to let me know they didn't have the garlic noodles I ordered, which was the chance to cancel my whole unfortunate order that I missed. I also ordered gai [chicken] satay and an extra cucumber salad. Those were fine but the chicken itself was a little off. What upset me the most is that the boxes inside the bag arrived completely soggy on the outside to the point where I had to use several paper towels and wash my hands repeatedly to deal with it. The mango on my overly firm rice was overripe and totally mushy; I took a few bites and was done. :( :( Oh also the guava juice I ordered had some very strange never before seen chemicals contained in the can, and I just wish there had been an option for some type of fresh juice, which I would have been happy to pay a bit more for.", "author": "Kate R."}

Nicely offset by a sweet sauce with a touch of spice. \n\nFresh Rolls: 2/5: Yeah, it's not like I expected an explosion of flavor from these rolls, but they were pretty snoozeworthy. Fresh? Yes. Something I would order again? No. Maybe more kick in the sauce would help? \n\nPad Thai: 3/5: It's a solid Pad Thai. The noodles were nicely cooked, the portions were generous and it wasn't overly saucy. I asked for medium heat and I didn't really get any heat at all. Maybe next time I would push the service and really ask for some fire. \n\nI can see why iThai gets some love - it's a good meal for a fair price.

Omg,probably one of the best wontons I've ever had. It was so crunchy and flakey,meat perfectly cooked, but the sweet/spicy sauce was amazing! (Couldn't help but sop it all up with our leftover rice) The chicken skewers were also perfectly cooked and had (another) tasty sauce,along with some charred bread. For a main course my bf ordered a beef plate which came with rice and veggies, while I ordered the silver noodle soup. Broth was perfect. Everything was so flavorful and looked appealing. We shared some soju which was interesting,in a good way? I'd never had it before,but tasted like a warm beer/wine. Tasty. Lastly we ordered her recommended dessert.

Overall my experience was good will definitely come back, plus they also do free delivery with minimum of $20, so this is a plus.", "author": "Eva E."}

The food is good, the service from the waitresses is great, they always seem really happy. Being an international student I have so much work that I can't cook for myself and eat at Ithai. I can count on my hand that I have been to Ithai more than 3 times a week, with my friend, and also bringing other people as well. However, I will never be going back to Ithai again after how rude one guy who worked there (we think it's the manager). It started when my friend ordered food and I decided I wanted to eat at Ithai. He picked up his food and we sat down to eat. The guy who was serving us seemed to be in a very bad mood. We ignored it and sat down. I ordered food and we started to eat. The waiter/manager, was upset since my friend sat down with his take out food and not a plate, so he decided to put it in a plate which was ok, but they way he went about it seemed like he was upset. The whole time we were there the guy didn't ask us if the food was ok, if we needed anything, nothing until we were done eating. After we were done eating the check was about $8.70 and I used cash and gave $9 because of the bad service. We walked outside and the next thing you know we see the waiter/manager, coming up behind us holding the change from the check and saying \"No you need this, take it\", \"you need this more than me\". He then put the change in my pocket without me allowing him to. \n\nMy friend and I were so shocked we thought we were dreaming. The actual tip for him would have been 70 more cents, and he could have easily just said I need just a little more change please. I didn't give him a good tip since the service was poor. However the service was one of the worst, and no matter how good the food is and the service from everyone else (the girls), I will not be going back there again. It's not the customer's fault that your having a bad day. If he is the manager than he needs to treat people with more respect and with a better attitude. He was unprofessional, and didn't not act like a manager by coming out of his store to give us the change.  I recommend this place for the ok prices, and the good food.

With their flashy expensive lights I was drawn in, and my boyfriend and  decided to venture to have a nice casual quick dinner.... Nice... not so much, casual... yes, quick... HECK NO! We left the house at 8:40pm and (it takes 2 minutes to walk there) we got back home after 10! Upon arriving at iThai we were surprised by the number of people inside... of course the logical thought was, \"oh it must be good! It's packed on a Sunday night!\" WRONG! The place, we later discovered, was packed because  half the people were not being served correctly or were waiting for their food. \n\nSo, a two minute wait before getting seated.. No problem. \nWe sit down with our menus, and within 5 minutes both my boyfriend and I know what we want. He wants to order the Pad Thai, hot sake and the Satay appetizer. I want to order brown rice, yellow curry and a Thai iced coffee. The problem, where's our waitress? So we wait... and wait.... and wait... and after 20 minutes I'm fuming at the table. No one approached us, no one said  \" Hey i'm here to take your order!\" I finally had to holler down one of the girls and she comes by. So, I tell her we have been waiting 20 minutes and she writes down the order, repeats it twice and scurries off. Less than five minutes later they bussle out the Satay, the pad thai and my brown rice. Now I don't know about you, but it's kind of weird when one person gets their food before you... let alone with the appetizer! So we eat the appetizer, I stare at my brown rice, he stares at his pad thai because he doesn't want to eat without me and since I don't have my curry what am I supposed to do with the rice!???\n\nSo we wait..... and wait.... and guess what! We WAIT SOME MORE! Behind us I overhear a customer get up, go to the counter with his bill and say, \"Yeah, I'm not ok. You're charging me and I never got my food!\" and stormed out! This guy was sitting before we got seated so how long was he waiting!??\n\nSo finally, I'm super upset. At this point I almost wanted to just walk out, but instead I hollered again and the second waitress stops by. I say, \" We don't have our drinks, I never got my curry, and my rice is cold!\" and she asks, \"Oh did I take your order??\" THERE'S  20 PEOPLE IN THE PLACE! ATLEAST LOOK AT A CUSTOMER! So she apologizes, runs off and brings our drinks. About another 10 minutes later, I get my curry and warm rice... The boyfriend ate his Pad Thai cold. I ate half, and I usually don't waste food, but we wanted out. Risking the \" Can I get a to-go box?\" question probably would have set us back another 45 minutes. So upon receiving the bill we didn't even allow the waitress to run off. It was a \"CHARGE IT AND LETS GO!\" move. So we get charged.... with a \"sorry we screwed up please come back and don't write a mean review on Yelp\" discount and walk out totally disappointed. \\\n\nPlease... If you go, dedicate 2 hours of your life at a minimum. \nAnd if you don't go.... good for you, because I know I won't be going back.", "author": "RP S."}

The crab curry and th Pad Thai were excellent as was the service.  They were friendly, and we will for sure be returning to this nice place.   The prices could have been a bit cheaper, but we enjoyed it all the same.", "author": "george i."}

The food here is great its pretty authentic (except for a few dishes) and I'm Thai so I would definitely know. The first time i was here they had me sit on these fold out chairs which i was so confused about. A definite minus on the ambiance. But i was just here yesterday and saw that they bought new wood chairs and decorated just a little more. There's not too much to say the waitresses were nice and served the food promptly. The only downside is the parking which can be kind of tricky. I circled around about 5 times before i found parking. Oh yeah i forgot. They do karaoke here on certain days i think. Which i actually find annoying, I like being able to actually talk to friends while having dinner. So yeah thats a downside too. Luckily there wasnt any when i went in. If you dont like loud karaoke definitely make sure to call and ask if they there is going to be any on the day you come in.", "author": "Sara S."}

This fried rice plate with meat that was very good. Waiters were very quick, glass was always topped off and very reasonably priced. Also, the sink in the bathroom is amazing, you just have to see it.", "author": "Ameer A."}

The environment is also a bit strange. The cool minimalist aesthetic is fine but the place seems to need a little sprucing up and better attention to detail.", "author": "Geoffrey U."}
