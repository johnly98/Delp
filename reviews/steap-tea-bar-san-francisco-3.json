What's not to love about a boba joint who can deliver that? \n\nSteap stands for a myriad of things: steeping tea, the 'tea' homophone, and perhaps most importantly, how ridiculously steep the hills of Chinatown are. Just off the well-worn tourist path on Grant Avenue hides Steap, which feels like a teeny-tiny studio apartment bursting with flavor. It's a bit of a hike but it's pretty rewarding when it comes to thirst. There are dozens of drinks on the menu and it appears all of them are high quality.\n\nThe mango paradise drink is awesome. It's so fruity and light that it'll make even the gloomiest of San Francisco days brighter. I got mine with a large helping of honey boba, which while plentiful, were hard to fish out of the ice because of its competition, the mango cubes. Steap is very good about maintaining sweetness levels -- 75% sweet should not taste like a sugar bomb, as it often does at other boba places. If you're particularly picky about being able to taste the different flavors in your tea instead of sweetener, Steap is the place to get that. \n   \nWiFi here is fast and doesn't require a password, thankfully. But it's way too loud to work here, because the staff blasts music like it's the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. It was largely EDM when I visited, which is not kind on the ears when reading spreadsheets.", "author": "Gwen W."}

But I guess I expected too much. \n\nOctober 13 - Sometime around 8pm. The main disappointment was that the boba was not good. It was soggy and had no chew nor any taste of being marinated in honey/sugar. It was very similar to the boba you can buy at the supermarket and make yourself. If I had known, I would not have paid the $0.50 to add it to my drink.\n\nAt $6 for a large sized drink, anyone would expect it to be good. I ordered the Matcha after the cashier's recommendation that it was made out of real whisked matcha powder. While it was good, it does not compare to what I could get at boba guys for the same price point. Also, the bad boba really downed the quality of the drink as a whole. My friend also got the lychee drink and said it wasn't good.\n\nMaybe it was an off day for them.. but I don't think I would be coming back.", "author": "Tina O."}

Disappointed that I was convinced to come here after seeing 4.5 stars. \n\n*Our drinks were pretty bland and lacked tea flavors. The Thai tea was not your conventional Thai tea. Although the menu tells you the ingredients, which warns you it's not your ordinary Thai tea ingredients, it just did not satisfy us. The roasted tea was same. Not your ordinary roasted tea and lacked tea flavors. Both drinks however were sweetened well. \n\n*I give this place 2 stars because the boba and tea jelly was not bad. Maybe milk drinks are not the specialty here and I shoulda went with a fruit tea drink. Sadly I don't think its worth it for me to come back to try.

I wish I lived in California so I could come back to try their other toppings like lychee, hibiscus, hemp drops and activated charcoal!  How cool!

My friend and I were pretty much whatever at that point and got the drink to say that we tried it. The drink itself was honestly whatever, although it does make a pretty picture with the powdered marijuana leaf (slightly misleading though...) In regards to the taste, there was nothing too memorable about it and for $10 I expected more than 6 drops of oil .. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't order this drink again.

It did have the cbd flavor but I highly doubt it is enough to actually relax you. The drink was almost $10 with no boba. The flavor was only ok... the lemon made it weird. Also they would run out of the foam and you have to wait forever for them to remake it.

They play decently loud/hip music: I think I'd be slightly annoyed with it if I was trying to have a conversation here (because I'm old and cranky).\n\nThey have your typical boba options + tons of toppings, along with some specialty CBD drinks (!!!). They also have a clean (gender-neutral) bathroom, good amount of seating, and free WiFi. The password is displayed above most of the outlets among the wall. \n\nSo I got the Black Milk (black milk tea + boba) -- a medium is $4.50 and a large is $5.50. For some other drinks, a medium is $5.00 and a large is $6.00. This place is pricey! Above the average compared to other boba shops, and spending $6 for just a large drink (although it does include toppings) is ridiculous to me. \n\nThe boba was soft and chewy, a good texture, with slight hints of sweetness each bite. I found 25% sweetness to be the right amount. However, I was unimpressed with the milk tea: I didn't think the tea taste was strong enough or present, and it was watery and not creamy enough to me -- tasted more like sweetened tea-flavored water.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-09-09", "description": "Really disappointed in this business's practices, misleading customers into thinking their Green Queen (or was it Queen Green?) drink has any level of CBD in it. For the record, they use hemp seed oil not CBD oil due to a health code violation (this was told to me by their cashier). I guess previously they were serving CBD but have decided to not publicly let their audience know and still capitalizing on this idea/previous marketing. \n\nFrom the start...\nI walked into this cute boba shop yesterday around 3pm. It was busy but not so bad, there were still some seating options. My friend and I played with this ipad display on their wall (it will take a boomerang like video for you) and began to wait in line. There was about 7 or so parties ahead of us but the line moved fairly quickly. \n\nWhile waiting in line, I asked 2-3 questions to the male worker about the Green Queen drink (there was 3 workers total, 2 female and 1 male). I came here just for that drink after some of my friends told me about it. I asked \"how many mg is in each drink?\" \"can we add extra CBD oil?\" His responses \"it's about 10-15mg of CBD in each cup\" and even added that I could add an extra dose for $3 or add it to any drink for $3 if I didn't want the Green Queen drink itself. GREAT! I was so excited! \n\nWe waited and get to the front of the line to order. My friend places theirs and I go second. I asked if they could add extra CBD to the drink and my cashier informs me that it isn't CBD, they cannot sell that bc of health code violations, and that they use Hemp Seed Oil...ok...so why did your employee tell me it was CBD oil less than 5-10 min ago? Why do you have a matcha marijuana leaf design on the cup? Why do you not publically advertise anywhere on your website that you no longer serve CBD? Why are you misleading your customers? \n\n...I was really confused...\n\nHere's my issue...\nGoogle Steap Tea Bar and the first few articles is about \"CBD Boba\" or, vice versa, Google  \"CBD Boba\" and Steap Tea Bar will come up. They have many articles about their CBD boba and how they add CBD oil to their drink. I couldn't find anything that told me they recently switched to hemp seed oil. (Additionally, their employee confirmed it was CBD oil the day I was there, yesterday.) \n\nFor those of you that do not know, hemp and marijuana are NOT the same thing. The plants are in the same \"Cannabis\" family but aren't the same plant nor do they hold the same \"medicinal\" properties to it. Think of hemp like cotton, usually it's used it to manufacture clothing, paper, etc. Yes, there is hemp seed oil but the only nice thing about hemp seed oil is that it'll give you some omega 3's. \n\nMarijuana contains THC and CBD. THC is the stuff that makes people \"high\" and has the psychoactive effects people associate with marijuana. CBD is what holds the \"healing\" properties people speak about and gives you a \"body high\" that basically feels like your body is relaxed (no psychoactive effects). \n\nOnce I learned that it was hemp seed oil, I obviously didn't want the drink anymore. Why would I pay 9bucks for a drink (11 ? for a large) I could get for $3-5 somewhere else + just take a fish oil pill for the same effect? \n\nHowever, my bigger issue is, why would I want to support a business that is lying to their customer base? I saw at least 3 cups of their \"CBD Boba\" drink in the store while waiting. Did the cashier proactively tell them it was hemp seed oil? \n\nPersonally, because there's so much hype and news coverage around their CBD boba, I believe they should proactively tell the community they no longer serve this specific drink. Put a sign up, add a one liner to your website, tell your customers if/when they order, etc.\n\nVery disappointed because the employees were very kind and a lot of their other drinks are fairly prices and sounded delicious. I just can't support a business that straight up lied and continues to lie by not educating their audience properly of a change. I did tell the cashier that I didn't appreciate being mislead or that their employee told me false information. She apologized. What else can she do? Sad the owners would put an employee in that position to have to lie and deflect.", "author": "Cindy M."}

The cereal milk tea stood out immediately and I needed to try it.  They have three different types, one with lucky charm like marshmallows (what I got), cinnamon toast, and cocoa puffs. To my surprise they fit through the straw! I got a regular sized drink and had mixed feelings about it. The quality of tea seemed decent, but I didn't care for this specific flavor. Tasted like cotton candy. I added boba with the free topping Yelp check-in but wasn't a fan. The pearls were quite smaller than normal and were flavorless. Texture had the right amount of chew though. Also the cereal just floats so you have to either fish for them or deal with having a bunch of it leftover after you finish the tea. Drink prices here are around $4-5 at the time of this review.\n\nLooks pretty and seems like a cool idea, but didn't really deliver for me.", "author": "Brian G."}

One of the better boba/tea shops Chinatown has to offer, and though it's not a bad shop, it kinda just ranks as an okay for me.\n\nMango Paradise with Lychee Jelly ($4.50)- I enjoyed the drink, and I could definitely taste the subtle notes of mango green tea. Though the mango green tea taste wasn't super potent, it was pretty refreshing.\n\nLychee Love ($4.50)- Really weak lychee flavor, and while I didn't hate it, I don't think I'd get this again, as I could barely taste any lychee in the drink. Most of the lychee flavor that I did taste was primarily from the jelly, so I was slightly disappointed in that.\n\nPink Kitty ($4.50) - Supposedly a mixture of Strawberry, Lychee, and Lime, to me this tasted a lot like pink lemonade/sour cotton candy. Though refreshing, I don't know if I would come back for this again.\n\nService was very friendly and approachable. Even after messing up my drink order (they gave me the wrong toppings for my first drink), they gladly redid them, even though they seemed backed up by other orders.\n\nFree Wi-Fi, charging stations, and an adorable photo station nestled by the front corner of the store, which honestly helped push the rating from a 3 to a 3.5 leaning towards a 4, though not quite at that point.\n\nSteap for me would be a 3.5 leaning towards a 4. While I do appreciate the quality ingredients used in the drinks here, flavorwise I wasn't particularly excited, and it doesn't really compete with my personal favorite drink shops.

The drinks here are priced around $4-6 and on M-F, you can get a free topping by checking in on Yelp!  They also have a loyalty rewards program so you can get points for your drinks.  The staff are friendly and the place is very clean and modern.  There's a decent amount of seating and free wifi.  They also have a photo printing station that used to print out photos that you tag their Instagram with, but now it creates an animation.  My drink is usually ready quickly, but it does get busy at times!\n\nSome of my favorites are the roasted milk tea with grass jelly, the lychee love, and the purple rain.  The roasted milk was really good and I finished it in less than 10 minutes, so I have to order a large next time.  The grass jelly was easy to drink as the chunks weren't too large.  The lychee love is also very refreshing!  Purple rain has butterfly pea tea in it, so it results in a pretty purple-pink color.\n\nI'm not a fan of Tony's tea, which is a green lemon tea with mascarpone cheese top.  I don't think the cheese and lemon should go together.  It tasted like a sour yogurt drink.  I actually couldn't finish it and threw it away, which I never do to my tea!  What a disappointment :(\n\nI wish their sealing of the cups were more secure and strong.  Some of my tea got all over the film lid.  Also, I would probably adjust the ice level if you could.

My first review was strictly for the MealPal experience, which is all valid - however, today my company was having lunch catered and I really needed to use up my meals so I rather lose out on some of the value and get something than let my meal go to waste so I decided to give this place another chance - especially since the owner had taken the time out to respond and offer to make it right. \n\nToday's offering: Roasted Milk Tea with grass jelly \n\nThe store had one customer ahead of me, and I showed my phone and silently waited for my drink. Emil was working at the counter and started asking whether I wanted something different than what was being offered on MealPal. I responded with no, it's okay. He started talking to me about MealPal and said that there had been a review and I cut him off and said \"HI SORRY THAT WAS TOTALLY ME\".  Instead of being upset with me because I had wrote a meh review, we got into a conversation about my perspective as a consumer and I explained to him how MealPal worked and why the regular sized drink isn't the best value option for someone on MealPal. During our chat, he said \"Hey, I said I was going to make this right and said I'll give you a free drink so tell me what you want.\"\n\nGenuinely surprised that he remembered everything I wrote and what he said and offering me the free drink when I didn't even bring it up. Instead of dismissing me, he wanted my feedback and see how he can make my experience better. I chose the Mango Paradise and added aloe. Emil insisted that the barista making my drink give me samples so that I can taste my drink and make sure it's truly perfect before he'd let me out the door. My drink came with ice this time and a slice of lime inside - It's the perfect blend of mango and green tea. (The first time was made by a girl with no ice - and no lemon) \n\nI'm super happy that I gave it another chance. Emil is genuinely so nice and try to talk to his customers to understand how to better improve. So while the regular size is definitely not worth my MealPal meal - I would definitely go again if I was in the situation where I absolutely had to use up my meals and didn't want food.\n\nI'd definitely go and buy the drinks as a regular customer.  Solid A+ for customer service, I normally don't go to bubble tea joints for customer service since I'm used to Asians screaming my number when my drink is ready, but this place is above and beyond. \n\nI learned that they have a rewards programs via Square - Every $27 you get $6 off? Or something like that...\n\nTLDR: Give this place a shot! Excellent customer service. They really will remake the drink for you if you aren't happy with how it tastes.", "author": "Judy H."}

The lemon they added with it actually kind of takes away from the taste of the lychee, and it wasn't all that great of a combination.\n\nThe boba itself is rather boring, and I don't think this place is really known for it. It was chewy in some forms, but it wasn't all that flavorful or sweet, lacking the honey boba taste of many places in the area, as well as the nice well made execution of say Boba Guys.\n\nOverall this would be a pass in my book.

Right when you walk in you can tell this is a quality boba shop that really cares about the ingredients that go in their drinks. Nothing is from powder, and they make most everything in house including toppings like their jellies and boba. \n\nThey have a selection of fruit flavored teas, milk teas, and also non tea drinks. I went with their most popular fruit tea.. The mango green tea and added their house made grass jelly. Their teas are actually a lot less sweet than other boba shops which I really like. Less sugar = less guilt. You can adjust the sugar levels but their normal is like 50 percent sugar at other boba shops. \n\nIf you want to sample a tea just ask them. The servers are really nice and ask if you want to sample anything. They also have random samples made right when you walk in the door. Also if you don't like how your tea turned out, you can ask them to remake it to your desire\n\nI liked my mango green tea a lot!  The tea flavor comes through!  The grass jelly was super soft and flavorful. It almost melts in your mouth!  \n\nOne of my favorite things is that they have this awesome photo booth feature where it prints out photos you upload to Instagram using their hashtag #steapteabar.  How cool is that!  \n\nThis place also has a table with bar stools and outlets at every station if you want to work/study there.

Their roasted milk tea is really good but my favorite is the charcoal almond milk tea with boba. You don't really taste the charcoal but it gives it this great grey color. \n\nSteap also offers non-tea or decaffeinated drinks, in case you want something caffeine-free. Their Pink Kitty and Purple Rain are my favorites. \n\nLychee Love is a non-milk drink that uses green tea - really yummy. They also make something with passion fruit that is good, too. \n\nI really like that they make their toppings in-house. They make their boba every three hours or so so that it's fresh. Its a little on the sweet side, but I like it! The texture is great, too - a little dense and really chewy. \n\nThe decor is nice and simple.

She walked us through the different types of drinks and most popular choices. They even offer samples of certain drinks to help you make your final boba tea decision. I was debating over fruity drink or milk tea. I ended up with the matcha latte with grass jelly. Loved it! It wasn't chalky or powdery. And they make it with almond milk love! I always ask for milk substitutes whenever possible. If you had authentic matcha you know the taste difference compared to a syrup or other matcha flavoring powder. This was authentic match powder. Grass jelly was nice and soft. My bf had their roasted milk. Also really great flavors! Very smooth and creamy. No artificial sweeteners or chalky powder residue. I really liked that that start their sweetness levels at 50% less already. I didn't have to reduce the sweetness level at all. \n\nIt's a long narrow space with bar seating against the wall with charging stations. It was well kept and clean.

Also, eating a lot of heavy matcha snacks makes you thirsty for something cool and refreshing!\n\nI ordered the Green Queen, since my lactose for the day was done at 4:00pm.  This was a mixture of lemon, matcha, mint.  I was a little apprehensive about the drink since I've never tried that combination before, but I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor.  It tasted like a very refreshing non-alcoholic mint mojito.  I wanted to try the CBD cream top but there was no way I was going to pay an additional $3 on top of my $5 drink (I could probably buy an actual mojito somewhere for that price....).  \n\nI really want to go to the Chinatown location and try their other popular drinks when I'm not lazy!", "author": "Shirley C."}

The quality of the milk teas made it seem like the case.\n\nAs of yesterday, I have now been to this location 3 times, and is now my main alternative for tea near my workplace whenever iTea has a long line (which is nearly all the time now). One of the things I noticed about this place, other than the immaculate space for seating, is the clear windows on the counters, which allow you to see the ingredients and tools used in making your drinks. This is a huge contrast to your average milk tea places, as they usually make them in a separate room, or on the counter with partitions to hide what they're making. To me, this sends a message to the customer that the ingredients at Steap are indeed freshly made and drinks are handcrafted. Any milk tea business can claim fresh ingredients, but Steap is not afraid to show it. \n\nMy usual go-to drink is the....*looks at menu right in front of me at my desk* Almond Milk Pearl ($5 for 12oz, $6 for the 18oz cup), which consists of Taiwanese green tea, almond milk, non-dairy creamer, cane sugar, and boba. There are multiple points where you can modify your drink, from amount of sweetness and the type of sweetener used (cane sugar, honey, or regular sugar), level of ice, type of milk used (although if you go with the aforementioned drink, you sort of have to go with almond milk, right?), and toppings. \n\nI opted to go with agar boba in place of regularboba, and loved the result. The flavor and the level of sweetness were perfect to my tastes. No powdery taste at all. And while the price point is a little more expensive than at most places, the freshness more than makes up for that. \n\nOh, and they actually encourage patrons to send their drink back if there's something you don't like. They are actually WILLING to make it again for you! Amazing!", "author": "Viet N."}

Of course, I get to choose what I put in a plastic cup that suits my fancy.\n\nHerbal: chai\nSweetness level: medium\nSweetener: cane sugar\nMilk option: almond milk (I'm lactose intolerant)\nTopping: chia seeds\n\nI had to skip step 3 which contains fruit flavors, less of course you had to be a rocket scientist and choose a lychee flavor to the mix and it might taste weird.  Anyway, my chia-chai is remarkable and impeccable!  Know why the tea flavor is appropriate to its topping.  Aside its light and smooth cup, notice the difference between my chia seeds and everyone's favorite pearls.  Mine float at the top of my drink while their pearls sink at the bottom like sunken treasure.  I wasn't much of the fan of bubble tea.  If blocks of ice didn't get in my way, I still end up taking the last of the pearls.  Here's another thing to let you know.  When I tried to sip the last content, I suck the air from the plastic cup, making it crumpled before it reforms back to its original shape.  Reminds me of VITASOY.

For one the line is not horrendous and they use high quality ingredients.  Interior is small and minimal, perfect for grabbing some boba while you explore Chinatown.\n\nThey're quite generous with their toppings, and you can definitely taste the quality in their teas.  They use local organic milks too - one of the few boba places that I know of that offers organic almond milk, so woo!  They also have some interesting trendy toppings I haven't seen at other boba places like activated charcoal.\n\nWish they had a location in south bay, but I'll be back when I'm in SF!", "author": "Helena Q."}

As someone who is commonly called an ABG (Asian Boba Girl), this is probably my new favorite place. Not just because of their drinks but also because of their superior customer service. \n\nI have been here about two times, and each time I got a little confused about where it is. This store has a black banner with no words on it and the only way to identify it is their little stand-up sign outside the door (which can be a little hard to see if you're not walking down/up on Sacramento where you would be facing the sign) but don't lose hope and put in the extra eye effort to find this place! \n\nThey take every form of payment possible (Card, card, Visa, Apple Pay... ) which I love because I hate digging into my bag for my wallet and then my card. They're a part of the 5-star rewards program and everything is highly customizable here. From your sweetness level, ice level and even what type of sweetener you want (honey, cane sugar...regular sugar)\n\nNow onto their drinks, I have tried the Mango Paradise and the Roasted Milk Tea, both of which I highly recommend. You can definitely taste the tea in their drinks and it doesn't taste watered down or drowned in sugar.\n\nBoth times I been here I got top notch customer service. They have a 100% satisfaction guarantee, and that means they will make a whole new drink for you if you are not satisfied. I asked for more sugar in one of my drink and instead of just adding the sugar in like most places, the barista kicked up a new one for me even when I was low-key begging him to just add it to my current one (like seriously, I felt bad because he warned me that their sweetness level tends to be lower than most places and I didn't listen) Second time I was here, they took a little longer than usual to make my order and they upgraded my drink to a large without even asking. (and it really made my day because I had a pretty rough day today)  \n\nTLDR: Good tea with a high range of customization.

And unlike most of the other boba places around it, it was founded by an American who didn't grow up drinking boba. He just found it and fell in love.\n\nWhat Steap does is find a way to build off of the renaissance of bubble tea started by Boba Guys, and expands it further, bringing it to an even wider audience. Emil cares about every single cup created and wants to see it made exactly how the customer wants it. Turning it almost into a Chipotle, but for boba, it really allows you to get the drink how you want it, and is very welcoming to newer people to the drink than the more traditional boba joint is. Everything is fresh and carefully sourced, so really be creative. It isn't your traditional bar, but a place to really enjoy the drink.", "author": "Griffin S."}

I was pretty excited that day especially since I had just walked about a mile to meet a friend. I tried the Almond Milk Pearl and my friend tried the Just Peachy. \n\nI thought that my Almond Pearl was a bit bland/too much ice. The tapioca was soft, but was a little on the sour side. Maybe the taste was a little off because it was towards the end of the day? My friend thought her drink was okay. \n\nHonestly, the price is a little on the expensive side (for Chinatown). For $5-6 bucks I rather just walk a block and a half to Boba Guys (organic milk and ingredients) on Stockton.", "author": "Bianca C."}

There's been cases where patients have used this to cure some diseases/malfunctions through natural consumption. \n\nI don't know a whole lot about it besides that (and I may just google it and find out more and try the drink next time) but it's definitely the first tea shop to use it and that's great exposure for MJ.", "author": "Hiro D."}

For the two times I've been here, the staff have been really friendly and knowledgeable about the drinks. Today, I waited in line for about 5 minutes+ because they had a large catering order ahead of me. Wasn't really an issue with me since I wasn't in a hurry but the staff apologized and gave my friend and I drink upgrades to the large size. (I've waited in long 30+ minute lines at certain other boba shops and didn't get treated this nicely!)\n\nAs a lactose intolerant person who loves going to boba shops, I was happy to see many non-dairy milk tea options on the menu. There was a great mix of fruity drinks as well as milk tea with non dairy creamers and almond milk. I decided to stick with a fruity drink and got the mango paradise ($4) with grass jelly +.50 cent toppings (grass jelly was freshly made in-store!) The drink was good, although I wasn't really a fan of the organic lime they added in which made it taste a bit less sweet and added a slight sourness. Maybe they should make that optional. Another thing I noticed was that they use flavored syrups and no bits or chunks of real fruit added in which would have made it better. Loved the grass jelly, which was really smooth and soft and worth the extra 50 cents. My friend got the matcha green tea latte, which was non-dairy. She liked it, but said it tasted a bit too overpoweringly matcha-y.

We arrived 20 minutes prior to closing and noticed someone mopping the floor and the chairs packed up. We peeked in thinking that we will have to return another day, but the friendly staff welcomed us in! Of one the women introduced the menu to us, sharing her highly recommended drinks and alternatives. \n\nWe ordered the Almond Milk Pearl, Mango Paradise, Jasmine Milk Tea, and Kumquat Green. Every drink was a hit! The refreshing and clean taste of the drinks reflect the fresh ingredients used. The price for a medium (16 oz) was only about $0.50 more than other boba places in the city, but this compensates for the fresh ingredients used. Better yet, you know every ingredient that goes into your drink because it is listed on the menu. Steap prides itself on using the highest quality ingredients and less sugar. These are a plus, as many boba places use powder instead of fresh ingredients and are way too sweet. \n\nI truly appreciate how considerate the staff are in regards to satisfying our needs. Before serving us the drink, they poured out a sample in a small paper cup and asked if we liked the taste or if we would like to adjust the sweetness. One of the staff even remade one of our drinks because she was not satisfied with the end result! We also later learned that the man behind the counter was the owner, Emil. He seems very passionate about his craft and ensured that my family and I had a great experience. We will surely return to fulfill our boba cravings. The best part in discovering Steap? We can now enjoy boba feeling (slightly) less guilty!", "author": "Alyson S."}

Not only that, they proudly talk about the utmost quality in the various teas and ingredients they offer, coming from Thailand, Sri Lanka, Japan, and Taiwan. \n\nAbout the owners: These guys have an incredible, friendly outgoing personality, with a wide range of background experience working in server and barista roles. They gave an exceptional quality of service that is competitive  to one of the top coffee places, Philz, but even more personal and better. They offered me to try out their drink samples, and a proportionate amount of their homemade, delicious sample of Taiwanese Styled Grass Jelly (which is close to authentic!). Before leaving the store, they made sure that I am completely satisfied with my drink! \n\nCons/Minor Improvements: I hope that there will be more toppings, types of drinks (smoothies, tea mixes, cocktail dessert frappes), snack foods, desserts, and maybe even a small area for gaming entertainment for both older adults and younger people like me.

Despite it having free wifi, there isn't really any tables for you to sit comfortably with a computer. There's a bar with swivel stools but it's also where people line up to order, so it's a bit uncomfortable. I like their teas, although it's on the expensive side but then again, it's practically Boba guys' pricing. I usually get the Jasmine Milk Tea with boba. No need to get less sugar. There really isn't the need for adjustment since it's a low level of sugar. Besides the traditional tea bar options, they have healthy styled drinks, sort of detox and smoothies.

I discussed this sign with the owner. He truly wants every customer completely happy with their drink. I love this attitude (he was sincere, chill and really nice).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-11", "description": "I've only been here once so far, but I have to say the service alone garners a five star rating. I went in a week ago and ordered a regular size \"custom drink\", which was a black tea base, regular sweetness, strawberry flavor, with a mixture of almond and skim milk, and boba. I know, not terribly adventurous, but I felt \"basic\" that day. I almost didn't get the strawberry. Anyway, I get my drink some moments later. The gentleman told me to let him know if my drink needed to be modified. I walk back to my seat, tried my drink and didn't think it was sweet enough. I really hate feeling like I'm bothering someone, but he did ask and the drink was quite pricey for it to just be ok. I told him that I liked it a bit sweeter, to which he graciously replied that he'd make me a new drink in a couple minutes. By that point, a number of customers have trickled in, so he was busy making their drinks. Surprisingly, he let me keep my old drink, which I just gave to my sister. After he mixed my new drink, he checked to see if it was to my liking, before sealing it. How thoughtful! A moment later, I was presented with a new, now large, drink! Honestly, the best service I've recieved at a boba shop... and I've been to several. I'm a bit of a milk tea connoisseur. The gentleman then left for the day. I appreciate that, even though he was on his way out, he still took the time and care to ensure that I liked my drink. And as we were leaving, the other gentleman apologized for \"messing up\" my drink. They are just too nice here! No one messed up anything, I just have a sweet tooth. \n\nApart from the fantastic service, the tea here is good! My sister and I both enjoyed our drinks. She got the iced matcha. I tried it and it's definitely real matcha. It has a bitterness and is a bit earthy, so if you want more of a dessert taste, get extra sugar. My (new) drink was nicely balanced and perfectly sweetened. They do have some unique and interesting creations here, so maybe I'll be more adventurous next time!", "author": "Vanessa U."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-18", "description": "I was addicted to boba tea for a few years, but stopped drinking it because many places use too much sugar and even when you can order it unsweetened the non-diary milk options were not good, like maybe a non-diary powder creamer or soy. So then I would order no milk, no sugar and just tea with grass jelly or boba, but after getting rid of sugar and milk you really taste the tea and most places had crappy tea. Really glad I walked past Steap Tea and that the ingredients here are really good. I especially love the homemade grass jelly! Also, love the hibiscus tea and all the green milk teas which are awesome with almond milk, hot or cold. Absolutely my favorite tea place in SF!

At the time, I was contemplating either ordering Roasted Milk Tea or Jasmine Milk tea, but I ultimately decided on Roasted Milk Tea because I decided that JMT could be found practically anywhere. Their cashier who took my order was really nice and friendly and the music (Drake) made for a really chill and hip environment. Unfortunately, when my drink came out, I found that my milk tea was pretty bland-- with only a hint of roasted tea taste-- and their organic sugar reminded me of Stevia or some kind of fake sugar. In short, it tasted like water to both my friends (who tried my drink) and me. \nI even tried my friend's Jasmine Milk Tea which also tasted like water... I saw that they had a sign in which they stated that they would be willing to fix your drinks if you didn't like it, but the only other drink I wanted was Jasmine Milk Tea so I refrained from changing my drink. \n\nOn the bright side, the boba was delicious and I love how the photo booth would instantly print any picture you wanted on Instagram.\n\nIf I were to come back, I'd probably try their non-milk drinks because those seem to have better reviews...", "author": "Winnie L."}
