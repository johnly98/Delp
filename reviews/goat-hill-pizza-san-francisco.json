Light, soft and fluffy..it's bomb af. I try to eat as many as I can, but realize there's pizza to be consumed as well. \n\nI've had their Chicken Florentine, Hilda's fav (pesto pizza), California, special combo and meat lovers. All are good, but I say Chicken Florentine and Hilda's fav get my top vote. 3 or 4 slices, the pillow bread and a few cups of water and I'm gouda. Pizza size ranges from small to extra large, and they even give you a guesstimate to how many peeps a certain size will feed. My office and I usually have the pizza delivered and recently dined in rollin' 8 ppl deep. We ordered 2 extra large pizzas, cheesy bread and salad and had a good amount of leftovers for later. \n\nGoat Hill pizza is pretty unique compared to other pizzas I've had. They have a wide array of pizzas to choose from, as well as a few pastas, sandwiches and salads. I always get excited when there's leftover pizza from them in the office fridge. They never disappoint! Good eats and reasonably priced. Definitely give them a try!", "author": "Vicky L."}

It was against my little daughter's judgement to not go there, which I wish I had listened. \n\nI was served by a guy with greasy hair, sweaty too perhaps. He asked me if I had seating preference. I said no, he sat us right in the front area where the pizzas were made. I thought we would get better service since he would pass us to get to other tables. \n\nTook him 15 minutes to take our order. He didn't ask what kind of sauce  we might want or even size of the pizza. When I asked him about what the meatballs were made of, the explanation was a slur that i had to figure it out myself. \n\nSo we ordered 1 appetizer and 1 small pizza. I didn't like the vibe already. My pizza took a long time than usual to get to our table, served by the cook, which came before the appetizer. I had to wave the guy who was 'serving' me asking for the wings. He took it from the counter and gave us. God knows how long it had been sitting there, but it was still hot. He apologized for the delay cos it was 'rush' time. \n\nHe never once asked if we needed anything else, or water refills or anything. I had to get my own 'to go' box and walked to the front to pay, of course no one was there. A lady finally came and i told her my displeasure and how unhappy i was with the service. She meekly said sorry....more like a whisper...unapologetic. \n\nI didn't tip. I felt that I paid too much for a small pizza and some wings. Really disappointed with the service, felt very undervalued.

This isn't even the first time that we've come here where it was like this...it's always lackluster in the service department. Maybe understaffed? Maybe need to get new staff?

At that time, on weekdays, it's super mellow.  I usually sit in the back room, near a window, and it's just chill.  Only a few customers in the room, if any.  I just love it when I want to relax away from work.  But, the real thing we have to discuss here is that Goat Hill makes custom slices of pizza.  I don't think anyone else is doing this in San Francisco?  You can order a slice with whatever you want on it, as opposed to most places that sell slices where you need to pick from whatever they have made.  I just love this about Goat Hill, because I usually like combos that most by-the-slice places don't sell. Chicken sausage spinach or bacon meatball mushroom or whatever I feel like coming up with.  Custom pizza slices AND table service?  Consider me a fan for life.", "author": "Dave M."}

We were greeted and sat down immediately which was nice. The waitress handed us menus and gave us water. \n\nThe pizza was superb for about 35.00 we got half meat special and half goat cheese and tomato. It was delicious and the crust was soft, chewy and crispy all at the same time. \n\nMy only critique is the wait time. We were literally the only people there but we ended up waiting for over 40minutes  for our pizza, which just seemed a bit too long. The waitress explained there was a mix up with the back house when the cooks switched chefs but to be honest since the cooking area is opened the chefs were the same. And it looked like they were just goofing around and didn't see our order for the first 20 minutes we were sitting there... \n\nThis place would have definitely been 5 stars for me, if their service was on point.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-12", "description": "I am delighted to have FINALLY found this place, despite its long history as a Potrero Hill institution (opened in 1975!). I can't speak to how the current establishment compares to the pre-remodeled ways; however, my experience since coming here 3 months ago has been nothing but ADDICTIVE. \n\nFirst, service is efficient AF. Regardless of what time of day or day of the week, the servers are attentive. The manager, Lily, is both amiable AND competent. She clearly knows how to captain this ship and is always such a pleasure to encounter at dinner time. Her superior managerial capabilities are especially evident on busy nights. Being a hotspot for families with small children means that occasionally the staff can be a tiiiiiiiiny bit grouchy (but honestly who wouldn't be after an entire week of screaming mini-humans). But regardless of their moods, the staff is always quick and attentive. That's phenomenal management. \n\nFinally, their food is obesity worthy. I kid you not. I come here as often as I one can before one's body starts to rebel. Their pizza crust is crispy on the bottom, chewy in the center, and both on the crust. The sour dough elevates all the flavors of the pizza to a different level. Other pizza joint ain't got notthin' on Goat Hill. I also LOVE LOVE LOVE that they offer daiya (vegan) cheese for those of us that are lactose intolerant who are looking to enjoy a pizza gas-free (sorry I'm not sorry) without compromising on flavor. And for those judgy-mc-judgers who think \"EW Vegan?! No thank you\" I'll say it had my family fooled. And, because their pizza dough is vegan, everyone in the family, regardless of dietary restrictions (even the salad options are great for Gluten-Free peeps), are able to come here and have a killer time. 10 points for Gryffindor!\n\nSince I discovered this place I've been going almost every other week and the pizzas just keep getting better an better. The Californian is my fave -- add mushrooms and olives and it'll give the opioid crisis a run for it's money (sorry too real?).\n\nThe place can be a little crowded but honestly what great place isn't.

Only to let us know they're out of goat cheese. \n\nFine - totally get it we'll take what's available. So we ask for a substitute for ricotta (plenty in stock). Here comes the surreal experience I mentioned earlier. She charges me $33 for a medium \"custom pizza\" when we ordered the Hilda - more than willing to take the cheese they had on hand. Mind you a medium hilda is $23.95. So she clearly charged me more than $8 more to accept an ingredient as a substitute for something they ran out of.

We ordered the caprese salad and the garlic bread with cheese for starters.  The salad looked pretty but tasted basic.  Thankfully they provided our own bottles of balsamic vinegar and olive oil, cause it needed a few dashes of each. The garlic bread wasn't toasted enough so it wasn't crispy.  Tasted ok, but I was expecting more from it.\n\nWe got the combination pizza with the hopes of it tasting fantastic but again was just pretty average.  The crust was a bit too hard for my liking and after having a piece I was already wishing we would have got the meat lovers.  The side of marinara helped slightly but not much. \n\nService was good though, but probably won't come back.  Just being honest.", "author": "Nyla K."}

I have come here for many years on Mondays and have always loved it! It's usually a great way to taste many different kinds of pizzas for a great price. However this past Monday we were made to wait an average of 20 minutes in between tiny slices of pizza. Usually the slice size is fine because they come with a good frequency, but this week it seemed like they wanted to wait and see if people would leave so they wouldn't have to feed them that much. It was quite a disappointment. I left after an hour and a half of mostly waiting and I only ate about half as much as I would have normally...(which I guess wasn't the worst thing for my health... but who goes to all-you-can eat for your health anyway?)\n\nThere were not many customers here on this night which might have factored into the slower service. But it seems to me like they should have a formula down to ensure that the frequency of pizza offered remains consistent no matter how many people are there.", "author": "Ryan F."}

I got the impression that our large-sized pie was not fresh, perhaps because the slices were dried out. At the edges, their sourdough crust is thick, doughy, & had the texture of being somewhat undercooked, but thankfully, was thin & nicely cooked where the toppings lay. \n\nWe ordered: \n-- 1/2 order of spaghetti & meatballs: did not try, received a lukewarm, \"it's okay\" from dining partner \n-- 1/2 porky pie (bacon, red onion, roasted garlic, garlic cream sauce -- needed more sauce, was not as garlicky as the ingredients led me to believe) & 1/2 special combination (think: typical combo of meats & veggies -- toppings were not evenly distributed, nothing special about this special combo.)\n-- root beer \n-- Total: $41 not including tip (which is much, much more than I'd like to spend for this quality.) \n\nWe're not shy about polishing off an obscene amount of pizza, so the fact that there were 4 of the 10 not-so-large slices left is an indication that there will be no repeat visits in the future. \n\nI will say -- service was friendly & food arrived quickly.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

It was homey, neighborhood pizza restaurant that wasn't pretentious and served great pizza. I loved to go for the all-you-can-eat Neighborhood Night on Mondays when servers carried whole pies around and you could get a slice of whatever toppings appealed to you. It was a great way to try different combinations. I would always go with a friend and be greeted Jorge, who always knew we wanted a carafe of the house wine. We'd get our table and head for the salad bar for some pre-pizza ruffage. Goat Hill closed this summer for renovations and re-opened last week. We went in tonight for Neighborhood Night and found the renovations to be rather insignificant. Someone apparently spent several months finding every possible way to remove all of the charm and warmth of what made Goat Hill welcoming, leaving a plain, nondescript echo of its former self in seafoam green. Jorge was nowhere to be seen, nor any other familiar face. When someone got around to coming to our table, we asked if the restaurant had changed hands and were surprisingly told no. They've expanded the kitchen in front to obviously cater more to take-out and delivery and put up an odd, cheap wall to separate the dining area. The salad bar is gone, replaced by unlimited salad that is brought to your table with a selection of all the salad bar toppings. This seems like a huge waste since I can't imagine anyone likes every topping on their salad, thus resulting in the leftovers needing to be thrown out.  Wine was no longer available by the carafe, but rather by the bottle. We begrudgingly ordered a bottle and asked for the salad. When asked what dressing we wanted from the usual Italian, 1000 Island, Blue Cheese, & Ranch varieties, we asked for just Balsamic. The young woman serving us said \"we don't have that yet\". Wha?! I'm thinking she doesn't know what Balsamic vinegar is and just said no rather than asking. At this point the number of detractors of this \"new\" Goat Hill had been enough. We apologized and told our server we changed our minds.  I doubt very seriously that my review will be the only negative review to come out of the destruction of what had truly been a wonderful family restaurant.  RIP Goat Hill.

Always.  Always, that is, except when it's from Goat Hill Pizza.  The toppings are fresh, and you can do creative by-the-slice while you're sitting at a table enjoying the lovely view.  I've never had the pasta, but the salads are good as well.\n\nIf you're eating in, it can take a while for anyone to notice you're standing there like you're supposed to.  I don't feel like enough of a regular to just plop myself down in the back dining room, but I'm getting there.  Oh, and choose the back if you've got a choice.  Unless you can sit on the tiny side facing Connecticut Street.  Then choose that.  But only if you've got kids with you, because then they'll be as far away as possible from me.\n\nOnce you're seated, the service is excellent.  I've only had one vaguely bad service experience, and it wasn't really her fault because some muckety-muck was muckety-mucking everything uppity-up.  And there were tons of brats that day.\n\nI like the old-timey piano, mainly because it's out of tune and constantly stacked with neighborhood flyers and circulars.  I want my cousin Greg to come one day just to play it.

I've been here about five times, over about the past eight years, and it never improves, and never impresses me.  In fact, the only reason I ever go here is because it is a favorite of two friends of mine who insist that we go here on Monday nights for the all-you-can-eat deal.\n\nFine.  I like my friends.  I don't generally care for their taste in food, and this is no exception.\n\nThe pizza crust is cardboard-y, flavorless, and there is seldom enough cheese on the pizza for my taste.  The sauce is just average, a bit too heavy on the tomato-paste-flavor for my preference.  I prefer a lighter, more fresh-tomato-y, less acidic sauce...and I prefer less of it on my pizza in general.\n\nThe toppings are fine, although I am someone who prefers plain cheese or margherita pizza.  They get very intricate with their blends of toppings on Monday nights, but honestly?  Unless you're omnivorous, you'll starve long before they walk around with enough flavors that you like.\n\nThat's the other thing that bugs me:  The all-you-can-eat deal is kind of, well, cheesy.  Or not, depending on how you look at it!  Here's the deal:  you get seated only if you have your entire party present, a server takes your drink order, and then you simply wait until servers walk around with different pies and offer you a super-tiny-sliver of a slice.  The plate they give you is paper.  No, I'm not kidding.  Yes, this is tacky and wasteful.  If I wanted to eat off of paper plates, I'd just order a pie to go, and go sit and eat it in Dolores Park, away from the uber-loud din at Goat Hill.\n\nSimply put, there isn't enough pizza to go around.  As they get busier, it seems that the servers walk over to your table with less frequency, and so you sit there, hungrily awaiting the next slice of pretty much ANY kind of pizza, because at that point, you're starving.\n\nAnd since the crust is so awful, you have to wrestle with your voice, who insists that if you don't like something, you don't have to eat it...but then you remind yourself that you don't know when (or if!) the next slice might arrive, so you should eat anything on your plate to ward off starvation.  Given the crust to rest-of-slice ratio, you'll be eating a lot of bland, empty carbs.\n\nIf you're like me, after a while, you get tired of waiting for a slice of something you'd want to eat to actually pass by, and eventually the noise gets to be too much, the chair gets too uncomfortable, and you just want to leave.  So you pay your $12.95 plus tax and tip, and head out...and realize as you walk out the door into the blessed fresh air and relative quiet that for what you paid for those 5 tiny little slices that maybe amounted to a real slice and a half of pizza, you could've bought an entire pizza somewhere else, wouldn't have had to wait for each bit to be doled out, and would've left without a headache from the noise.\n\nSeriously.  I don't get why grown-ups who don't have kids and have access to neighborhoods other than Bernal Heights would pay $13 for this experience, unless they are endlessly patient, and have such a huge appetite that they somehow manage to eat their money's worth!\n\nAs for me?  Next time my friends invite us to join them for \"pizza in the city\", I'll cajole them to let me choose the place...after all, after 8 years, haven't I waited my turn?!", "author": "Amy L."}

Since then, I've returned over and over again, and -- whether for the pizza buffet or for one of their thin-crust pies -- it's always been reliably delicious.\n\nAs a pescetarian, I particularly appreciate the range of vegetarian-friendly options offered during the Monday night pizza buffet. Last night I had 13 slices, 12 of which were different types of veggie pizza, including toppings like sun-dried tomato, artichoke hearts, spinach, green olives, goat cheese, bell peppers, and more. The non-vegetarian slice included veggies and anchovies -- perfect for a pescetarian like me! For the meat eaters, there also were several options available, including pies with lingui\u00e7a, bacon, or chicken, as well as a meat lover's pizza.\n\nRounding out the Monday night menu is a salad bar with options like pepperoncinis, bell peppers, black olives, chickpeas, and onions. While the veggie quality/variety is nothing special, the salad bar offers a nice counterbalance to the pizza onslaught.\n\nIn my experience over the past decade, Goat Hill has been a consistently solid spot for pizza -- it's truly a neighborhood gem for Potrero Hill residents, and the perfect place for anyone looking for all-you-can-eat pizza on a Monday night.", "author": "Eric L."}

Even if you pass on it another pizza will be proffered momentarily, all different and no duds unless you count that one covered with hot peppers which was too much even for this heat-a-holic.  \n\nWhat I particularly liked about this AYCE pizza thing were the slim slices.  Were they offering the large slices you get when you order a single piece elsewhere you might not get to sample much or feel like you got your money's worth; these slim slices allow you to try many slices and many toppings.  Win-win.  \n\nThis isn't fancy pizza. I doubt that people who scout out top pizzas will come here and decide that Goat Hill's are tops, but they're satisfying; I liked 'em.  And I really liked how the pizzas kept being offered, even when I'd started refusing most which walked by.  They might not tell you about the salad bar with its old-school iceberg lettuce but it's there, in the back room, and makes a perfect pizza accompaniment.  \n\nA mellow glass of house red wine ($4) was even better when ordered as a half carafe ($8.50).  It came to almost 4 glasses.\n\nGoat Hill's Monday night well-priced AYCE is perfect for those times when you're actually hungry and a bit thirsty too.  \n\n*  Monday night AYCE runs from 4 - 10 p.m.\n*  AYCE for kids ages 5 - 12 costs only $6.95.", "author": "Tracey A."}

This place makes me look forward to Mondays with their all you can eat! \nWhen you're seated, you're given a paper plate and immediately the servers come by with their pizzas. It's like dim sum style where they walk around and come by your table and ask you if you want a slice. There are a lot of varieties and I can go through the whole meal without repeating a slice with the same toppings. There is usually a good number of people so the pizzas are always piping hot with a crispy crust. Delicious! The slices are tiny but the servers keep your plate full so you get to try many kinds and no waste. There is a mediocre salad bar in the back but I ain't here for the salad.

Don't get me wrong, this pizza is good, but it's not one of the most amazing pizzas I've ever had. There was something missing and I can't put my finger on it. I came here late on a Saturday night as we were the only people in the restaurant (I guess pizza is more of a to-go kind of food). We ordered a medium half veggie and half hilda's favorite. My favorite of the two was the veggie - the vegetables were fresh and there were so many of them piled on the pizza. A medium was a good size for 2, we had 2 slices leftover which was enough for one person's lunch the next day! This pizza was good, but nothing exceptional and unfortunately this location is kind of out of the way for me so I don't know when I'll be back. \n\nI can imagine that this restaurant is good for larger parties because they do have a lot of space in the back!", "author": "Malika R."}

No, I didn't eat ALL this food, saving half of the pizza for my dad's midnight snack.

I love different cheeses, and the creaminess, saltiness, silkiness, and bite of that pizza was pure foodgasm.  It was an experience similar to when your mouth is overcome with water when you initially bite into something sour, or when you crave a certain food and your mouth all of a sudden floods.\n\nThe other pizzas here were just as great.  I had a meat combination pizza, a standard slice of cheese, and a roasted garlic w/ bacon slice that for any pork fat lover like myself, I could've hidden in a dark corner and just savored for all of eternity.  \n\nChasing them down with a pair of pitchers filled with Stella Artois and then transferred to my ice cold frosted mug was just heaven.  It has been a long time since I've had an opportunity to just sit down and appreciate a good slice of pie; this certainly made me check this box off!\n\nThe restaurant itself is riddled with local art that can be purchased if you wish.

I've never ate that much pizza in one seating in my entire life. Yes the slices is thin but if you joined them together I believe I may have eaten a whole medium size pie! Just $11.95/pp for the Monday night buffet, what a steal! Came at around 6 and was seated within 5 mins. Sat there for an hour and within that hour they had more than 15 different kinds of pizza! The servers came around fast. The one Mexican server with the heavy accent is very friendly and funny, making jokes. The only thing I wasn't really liking were the topping selection. Each pizza had 2-3 toppings if you don't include the cheese. So they were pretty boring. But if you want AYCE pizza this is the place.

To me that's one of the first things I think of in my beloved city besides Dungeness Crab And mission burritos.  \n\nSo Goat Hill has the right idea to me.  Pizza authentic to the Sucka Free, specializing in the thin but not too thin sourdough crust.  The dough has a different texture.  Different from any other pizzerias.  A nice change of pace.  No need to try and be like Delfina or Tony's.  Goat Hill got it going on.  And they have all-you-can-eat mondays!?!?  Look out all you two slice eaters!  Big Daddy is gonna come Monday and put a hurt'n on some sourdough pizza.  \n\nAlong with the pizza, I had the ravioli entree, some of the salad my sister ordered, and tiramisu.

This:  A consultant just flew out to my job this week, she's from the Midwest.  And the thought came to me, and I told it to her:  It's Monday night, and if you want to see the real San Francisco, don't go to Fisherman's Wharf, go to Goat Hill.  And I described the pizza, the all-you-can-eat, the scene.  She didn't go, she had to take a nap.\n\nBut the more I thought about that exchange, the more I realized that Goat Hill's Family Night is an authentic San Francisco experience.  You park on the street and traverse a hill, and 18th Street can be steep.  You walk into a narrow old building crowded with locals.  The skyscrapers of the Financial District offer a great view if the sun's up, or shine their beautiful lights if it's nighttime.   The pizza?  They do bring around old standbys like pepperoni and ham & pineapple, but also \"only in California\" combos like spinach & feta cheese and barbecued chicken & sun-dried tomatoes.  I once took my sister-in-law and my wife's BFF, and they loved the experience.  Unfortunately, we parked *down* 18th Street . . . they don't have hills this steep in Southeast Texas . . .\n\nNow, about the pizza:  Small but delicious.  Perfect for the discriminating taste-tester.  Creative combos.  But sometimes it backfires on them:  one waitress was begging people to take this unappetizing `za that was requested, and he was the only one who ate it!  Might have been liver & onions or something.  I set my record here - 20 slices in one sitting - but a long-time waitress told me that the most she saw was 30.

Not only is there a salad bar included, but the chefs throw together all sorts of combinations that are off the menu. My tip: Don't eat all the crust so you can save room for maximum variety. Corkage is also only $5.\n\nAfter rejecting the servers who \"just have\" pepperoni, you start to feel bad and hope they don't take it personally that they got saddled with a boring pie. Don't feel bad though: the employees are generally thick skinned and can handle your pizza put downs. There's one employee in particular that always has a smile on his face and a song in his heart. He makes it all worthwhile.\n\nThis place is consistent and has the right blend of ingredients to cheese ratio. It's refreshing to have a few places that have gone against the Neapolitan style (which I do love too) so you can actually hold a piece in one hand. It can get a bit pricey when ordering a full pizza, but the taste is great and well worth checking out.", "author": "Brandon K."}

The servers come out with different pizza types, tell you what it's got, and you can choose to accept or refuse a slice. This cycle repeats, and repeats, and repeats, depending on how much pizza you can eat.

The second guy was nice and made sure we were taken care of.

There can be a long wait if you get there late and there's a better variety early on so shoot for early evening. Salad bar is uninspired but to be expected at a family style pizza joint. The pizza itself is good, close enough to great. But the selling point for me is the variety and inventiveness. It seems they give the cooks a lot of creative control over the types of pizzas so I always leave there having tried 10 or so types that I really enjoyed. I also invariably end up eating far more than $10.95 worth of food.\n\n   I give them a few points for service as well. They generally aim to get everyone enough pizza, which can be tough when the place is packed and you only have but so many slices on a pan. Got there near the end once and was mistakenly told there would be a lot more pizzas coming out. A pair walked in 5 minutes later and a different host instructed them to not pay for unlimited because they wouldn't get their money's worth.

This review is in no way reflective of anything that happens here between Tuesday and Sunday.\n\nWith that said, let's talk about Mondays at Goat Hill:\n\n1) It's not your typical AYCE pizza joint. Instead of a buffet line, the servers consistently stop by your table to drop off small slices. Think of it as dim sum for pizza. It works really well because they have a lot of different pies.\n\n2) It gets very crowded so either come early or come late. I usually have a drink or two at Thee Parkside before trudging up the hill for a late night feast. I think they stop seating at 9PM, but I could be wrong.\n\n3) Total cost for unlimited pizza and salad is $10.95. Not bad, and they have reasonably priced pitchers of good brew. One more thing to note: If you go on Monday, you can only do AYCE. They won't let you order from the normal menu, so don't bring friends with small stomachs.\n\nAside from Anchor Brewing, this is possibly the only reason to climb Potrero Hill (I used to live there so I can say this).

Love how pizzas aren't just sitting around under a heat lamp, but servers actually bring around the pizzas so they're relatively fresh (not so much towards the end of the night as people start getting full & picky, which is unavoidable).\n\nSalad bar = meh. Not too many choices, not super fresh. From what I can remember off the top of my head: lettuce, chickpeas, kidney beans, american cheese, onions, olives, tomato slices, a few dressing choices.\n\nCrust = inconsistent. Some were really hard, some were more dough-y. I really like corn meal crust in general and when we got  a fresh slice done well, it had just the right amount of crunch with a soft almost gooey inside. But many slices were stale (inevitable), and some and a crust that were almost burnt (that IS avoidable).\n\nToppings = a lot of the same ingredients in different permutations. Many had garlic (so strong! loved it), pesto, cream, mushroom, tomato, artichoke, pineapple, spicy peppers. Anything with pork (ham, salami, pepperoni) were all WAY too salty. The spicy ones were legitimately spicy.\n\nPizzas we tried (ranked by my taste):\n\nGoat cheese tomato pesto\nSausage pesto tomato goat cheese\nTomato basil garlic\nPesto roasted garlic & tomato\nOnion garlic\nCheese\nArtichoke feta tomato\nCream & mushroom \nBacon roasted garlic & basil\nGreen onion/ red onion pineapple\nMushroom\nTomato & cream sauce\nSalami pepper mushroom\nChicken pesto black olive\nGreen olives, feta, tomato, onion\nSpicy Hawaiian\nHam pineapple\nPepperoni\nHam & cream sauce\nGrene & black olives, artichoke hearts\n(no, I do not have superhuman memory)\n(yes, I was the Yelp nerd taking notes during dinner)", "author": "Ziyan C."}

When it came though, it looked pretty good so we were like, whatever. It was $8.60 but the salad was huge. Could be a meal for two. Ingredients were pretty fresh but nothing to blow me out of the water? Standard salad.\n\nPizza: Got HIlda's Favorite. Pesto, goat cheese. $16 for a small sized pizza (about 6 smallish-medium slices)... seemed kinda overpriced since the pizza looked kinda flat and .. standard.. then again, it's only pizza right? I've had better still.\nThe pesto or goat cheese didn't wow me. But it was what you'd expect. They say they make their own sourdough crust? I guess it was pretty good (the crust) but I wouldn't rave about it?\n\nOverall: decent pizza if you're craving it and in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.\nHowever, service here is great since it's a small place.

It's simply the best pizza buffet I've experienced. \n\nAt $12, you get unlimited pizza and a salad bar. You wouldn't expect much from a pizza buffet, but Goat Hill Pizza does it right. They bring around their fresh made pizza and give you slices, instead of leaving them out under a red light. It's kind of like a pizza dim sum, for comparison. Also, they don't seem to make \"worse\" pizza for the all you can eat night. \n\nAs far as taste goes, their dough is thin and crispy, just the way I like it. The crust is good too, but I chose not to eat too many of mine to save space for the more delicious parts. I was particularly fond of the pepperoni and mushroom pizza. The ones I did not find good was the chicken garlic pizza. I thought it would be a nice white pizza with subtle flavors, but it was actually kind of over the top and too heavy tasting. I was also weirded out that they didn't really have sausages on their pizza, but they had ground beef on them. The ground beef wasn't exactly seasoned any way, so it just tasted like cooked ground beef. \n\nIf you have a large group on monday(over 10), you may need to get split up. It gets pretty packed during the peak time.", "author": "Julie K."}

These days, you can find almost anything sitting atop artisanal pizza creations like edible flowers, cracked eggs, kobe beef, et al. But with so many boundaries being pushed, it's nice to reminisce about a simpler time when there were only three major networks on TV, and home cordless phones were considered edgy, progressive and cool. \n\nGranted, there's more to Goat Hill than simple ingredients. They certainly have recipes that rival the creativity of any fanciful parlour in the city... but they still do the basics quite well. Pepperoni pizza, sausage pizza, veggie pizza chock full of every green, red, yellow and black vegetable available... and a handful of gourmet creations like goat cheese with pesto and the Mediterranean special with sliced red onions, feta cheese, rosemary and thyme spices. \n\nIt's not the cheapest skate you'll ever have, as a small pizza rings in at around $13, but once you take a bite it's all water under the bridge. Throw in some classic table settings, friendly faces and a guy playing a piano as you enter the facility... and you've got yourself a pretty quality dinner date with a hearty side of nostalgia. \n\nIf you're a big eater, you'd be remiss not to hit their Monday all-you-can-eat pizza and salad night for $10. I can't say I'd ever be able to take full advantage of a deal like that, but it wouldn't be a bad way to round out a weeklong fast, I suppose.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

More syllables and more words, but more to the point. All you can eat pizza! And they can even do it sourdough. If your San Francisco foodie quarter chub or femmeboner isn't in full effect right now, then you my friend are no longer thinking about a pizzeria so delicious you can smell it a block away. That's Goat Hill. \n\nPotrero Hill is an accurate name for the neighborhood where Goat Hill lives. I don't know how many times I've been out of breath walking up all the hills to get to All You Can Eat Pizza Mondays (I'm capitalizing it because it should be a city-recognized holiday). It's always worth it. When you're disgustingly full or perfectly happy depending on your approach, you'll relish the fact that you get to walk down hill home.\n\nIf you were to imagine Pizza Heaven (which why wouldn't you?) then it might feel like pizza and beer here. It's a real pizza joint with a good staff. The experience of all you can eat Monday is made possible by the staff. Without all the obnoxiousness of people in bow-ties waiting on you food, these people regularly handle walking to every table--every server has a different pizza pie--and asking you if you'd like a slice with a solid attitude and even better product. \n\nI don't know where else I can eat 10 different slices of pizza at once. Do you? If you do, give me a call, but I probably won't pick it up on Mondays. #ColinFarrellGetatMe", "author": "Danny A."}

(Cue mid-1990's image of Goatman from SNL)\n\nI don't get out to the Potrero very often, but this is one place that I would actually go out of my way for. We started out with the meatballs appetizer. I think we got 2, maybe 3 meatballs. Although they were juicy, tender, and really flavorful, the best part about the meatballs was the tomato sauce they were sitting in. I don't even like tomato sauce that much. But I doused every bite of meatball in the tomato sauce. It was sweet, and not at all tart. After we finished the meatballs, I finished up the tomato sauce with my spoon. Don't fAAAAAAAAAAult me for being a beast. (Although if you called me a goat, it'd be pretty appropriate in this instance)\n\nNext, we each had the $5.95 lunch special: a slice of pizza and a bowl of soup.  You may select up to 2 toppings on each slice. My boyfriend ordered chicken/artichoke and I ordered pepperoni/onion. I was worried that this would not fill me up, but it was surprisingly satisfying. The sourdough crust was AHHHHHHHHHmazing and did me proud as a goat, oops, I mean girl, born and raised in SF. Truly one of those pizza crusts where you actually look forward to eating the crust and not merely as an afterthought.  \n\nFor the soups, we had split pea with ham and garlic shrimp. Both soups were really, really delicious, fresh, and hearty. \n\nI came \"this close\" to giving Goat Hill Pizza 5 stars, but I'll save that for when I come back to try their all-you-can-eat-pizza on Monday nights.", "author": "Monelle A."}

Not very impressed by the typical pizza parlor decor and menu, we walked back out and consulted Yelp.  Shocked that we might be missing out on something ULTRA TASTY based on the rave reviews, we immediately turned around and marched back in.\n\nWe got a small POTD (pizza of the day), which was ham, mushroom and jalapeno.  The small had 6 slices, of which we polished off 3 and packed the leftovers.  The sourdough crust was chewy and slightly crunchy, and we were seriously enthused by the freshness and quality of the sauce, cheese and toppings.  The cheese was stringy and melty beneath the clearly freshly sourced mushrooms and jalapenos.  The combo sounded tasty and was even better than we expected.  I was initially skeptical of the idea of sourdough crust, but the crust had more of the texture than the sour taste of sourdough, which was exactly what the pizza needed.\n\nWe're HUGE Little Star Pizza fans ourselves, but that's much more of a gourmet one-of-a-kind don't-even-call-it-pizza experience.  Goat Hill Pizza is classic pizza... just exceptionally well-done.  Can't wait until the next we're looking to get dinner near Potrero Hill... Goat Hill, for sure.

Came in here with interns and some of my supervisors for lunch. Got some ice water and there were a plethora of pizza toppings and other item opinions to choose from. Robbie didn't like mushrooms and I didn't like grapefruit so we didn't get any of those toppings (thank god they didn't have grapefruit as a topping). We ended up getting an X-large, half meat lover's, and half \"special of the day\" which was bacon, artichoke and tomatoes. Wasn't really too long of a wait. The pizza came in smoking hot and SMELLS SO GOOD. GOD it smelled delicious. \n\nMy first slice was of the meat lovers. Sausage, salami, and pepperoni. Mmmmm so meaty and juicy. The salami and pepperoni melded together to from an unearthly fusion of hot fatty meat juices that exploded in your mouth. The sausage was chunked into large pieces too. After a couple salty savory bites of the pizza, you'd bite into a really big piece of yummy sausage. Quite tasty. The special of day was better though. The artichoke and tomato complimented each other well with their slightly sour refreshing juices. The crust held up nicely against the wide array of toppings. And the bacon... oh yes. Usually bacon is cooked limp and chewy on pizza, but this one was nothing like that. The bacon was crispy..CRISPY BACON ON PIZZA. And the fat wasn't even completely rendered! So you'd have an amazing bite of the crispy fatty bacon followed by several refreshing bites of the tomato and artichoke. Fantastic.\n\nBut the best part was really none of these toppings. The crust was superb. Crispy sourdough crust that could withstand all the sauce and toppings without drooping down or getting soggy. And at the end, when you finished all the sauced parts, a fabulous crust end awaits which was just as good as the rest of the pizza you had just ate. Yeah that crust was gooodd. They had some cornmeal on the bottom and the crust was a deep brown and slightly charred on the bottom. Good flavors.\n\n5/5 the crust was really really good.", "author": "Ernest C."}

The spot is located in a cute neighborhood on a hill so be prepared to parallel park or park at 90 degrees on a very steep hill.\n\nI had only heard about Goat Hill from 2 friends so it sounded like a good place to try.\n\nWhen you're seated they give you a paper plate for the pizza and there are actual plates for the salad at the bar. The server come around with different pizzas and as if you'd like a slice. Sounds cool right?\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of waiting, we finally started to see pizzas coming out the kitchen. I guess when we arrived a new batch had been put in. You never know what you're going to get offered and there is not set menu per say displayed anywhere.\n\nWe had the following pizzas today:\n\npesto and chicken\npesto and cheese\nsun-dried tomato and pesto\nchicken and mushroom\nartichoke and salami\nbacon, olive, tomato, and green onion\nham and sausage\npineapple, olive, and green onion\n\nAlso going around today was salami and sausage, ground beef and ham, pepperoni, plain cheese, and lots of other combinations.\n\nPersonally, a good old Canadian bacon and pineapple would have been great.\n\nThe reason for only 3 stars is the following:\n\nThe pizza itself doesn't jump out with fireworks sparkling on your taste buds. Moreover, the dining space is very cramped and it gets kind of crazy when there are large parties surrounding you. Since it was just my friend and I, we were smashed up pretty close to another 2 person party and 2, 10+ person parties. In addition, when large groups are being seated they all tend to crowd your eating space. Not the best way to enjoy a meal.\n\nHowever, the decor is really cute. There are paintings done by local children artists and the bathrooms are full of framed place mats diners have designed.\n\nAnother reason for the 3 stars is false advertising on the website. It says $10.95 on the website for the all you can eat, but it's actually $11.95.

I also tried their spaghetti with meat balls and the sauce was really good.  It was even better the next day!  \n\nThey are also great with their dine in service.  Two summers ago a bunch of my cousins and I dined there after a SF Giants game and they were able to provide us with an \"all you can eat\" type of dinner where they brought out pizzas as we consumed them (the pizzas were pre-ordered/picked by my wonderful cousin who coordinated our dinner there) and Goat Hill just had them ready to go.

You can pass on the ones you don't want to try but I say be adventurous and try them all.  The slices are really small.  They're actually half slices.  Plus the crust is thin crust which helps so you try more pizza. \n\nDon't mess with the salad bar.  Don't waste room with salad.  Just stick to the pizza.

I arrived at 5:00, expecting to have something while I waited for the rest of the party, who would not arrive till 6:30 or 7:00. I easily found a seat - it was early, and the place was 2/3 empty - next to a friend who was already there, having some wine while they waited. We talked; the place gradually filled. People sitting at tables next to us began to be served their dinners; but it was over 45 minutes before anyone asked if I was going to order. Then, they told me that they couldn't serve me, I would have to wait till the entire party arrived. They said I could  talk to the manager, and I said I'd like to. Another 20 minutes went by, and finally that personage appeared.

Super fresh ingredients and really fills you up if you don't think a slice of pizza and hearty soup won't do.\n\nNow, the downside.  It gets pretty darn crowded during lunch time like most places in the area so I suggest taking your food to go.  The place looks small from the outside but it actually has a huge back room.  It always seems like they don't have enough waitresses during the lunch hours so service can be somewhat slow.  If you plan on eating in during peak hours, be prepared to take a 1.5 hour lunch.\n\nAlso, parking pretty much sucks.

We got a large California, which had a chewy crust, was flavorful, and didn't skimp on the toppings.  The only thing that would have improved the experience for me if if the cheese was more uniformly spread across the pie.  A couple of slices were sorta half-cheesed only.  The side salad was better than expected because it included some garbanzo and kidney beans along with the lettuce.  Cheesy garlic bread was MMm MMm cheezy and garlicky -- definitely worth a try.  \n\nFinally, my favorite thing about GHP is that it's really convenient to order pizza online.

It's the table for 2 right at the entrance of the kitchen where the pizza comes out HOT and WHOLE. Whatever's coming out of that kitchen, we got offered first. And they just KEPT ON COMING!!!! I had to turn down a few because my pizza plate was full of pizza that I couldn't eat fast enough.\n\nSO MANY FLAVORS:\nThere were sooooooooooooooooo many choices of pizza. There were jalapeno pineapple ham/pepperoni, hawaiian, mushroom pesto, garlic mushroom, spinach salami, goat cheese mushroom, artichoke sun-dried tomatoes, chicken spinach, green and black olives, and so many many more I can't even remember them all. \nThe best part was that the crust was really thin and crispy. I hate it when the crust gets all soggy and mushy when you bite into it.

Freshly chopped tomatoes on top of sourdough (I think? It didn't seem as chewy as French bread) drizzled in a lot of garlic olive oil. Whatever the choice of bread was, I loved it because it was crisp on the outside and soft in the side, resulting in a satisfying crunch that didn't hurt my teeth.\n-Porky Pie Pizza: Holy cow, this thing had a ton of bacon and roasted garlic. Delicious although maybe not the best choice for a date. We ordered a medium and ate all of it (it was a pretty excessive amount of pizza for two people though). The day after, my stomach is currently hating me for consuming so much roasted garlic and bacon, but it was worth it. Sourdough crust was tasty and had good texture (not too chewy, not too hard).\n\nOther details:\n-Restaurant was busy, but not TOO busy.

Our server didn't know that the Scoutmob deal was also valid on paper, and he seemed a little pissed that he was not informed about that detail by his manager.

A very long time ago I used to be a staffer for a San Francisco politician, and one afternoon following a community meeting at the Potrero Hill Neighborhood House some of the fellow staffers and our interns decided to drop in on Goat Hill Pizza to gather our notes and unwind for the rest of the day.  I fell in love with this place back then, and I've been eating here ever since.  I haven't been dining here as frequently as I like as of late, but I've recently adjusted my lunch time stops and I'm planning on coming back more often now.\n\nI love their pizza.  The Chicken Florentine is probably my favorite with chicken, spinach and mushrooms.  I sometimes will substitute the regular tomato sauce with pesto sauce and have garlic added on.  I like their crispy chewy sourdough crust, and Goat Hill is very generous on the toppings.  Goat Hill's small is the perfect size for me to devour in just one sitting.  Free refills on a large soft drink means I'll always have something to wash it down with.\n\nRecently I tried their pasta for the very first time.  They only offer a spaghetti, a ravioli and a lasagna with your choice of sauce.  I had a ravioli with meat sauce and a salad.  The salad was a good mix of fresh, crunchy iceberg lettuce, spinach leaves and assorted greens with kidney beans, garbanzo beans, black olives and a single banana pepper on top.  The ravioli wasn't extraordinary but was good.  Their pasta sauce with meat is a bit on the thin side and the meat is ground up too fine to really distinguish it as meat.  The pasta came with two enormous slices of fresh garlic bread baked in the pizza oven.  The crispy and chewy garlic bread is excellent being very buttery and very garlicky.\n\nIn addition to coming here on my own, whenever I volunteer with One Brick at the San Francisco Food Bank located nearby this is the go-to place afterwards for cold beer, a vast variety of pizzas and socializing with other volunteers.

The hostess at the front was really nice and patient and really made sure that we would all be seated together. The aroma that comes from the inside of this place is amazing! It was my first time there and I thought it was pretty good.\n\nWe were seated in the back corner of the restaurant which I didn't mind. The only issue I had was with the salad bar which really only had one type of salad mix and a limited number of toppings for the salad. The waiters and waitresses constantly came to the back with pizzas that were fresh from the kitchen! I read a couple reviews talking about the wait for service and pizza but let's be honest...that's just how their system is. My friends and I got a lot of pizza and there was only two times when we would be waiting a couple minutes before another pizza came by. I'm sure I had about 16 slices of pizza.\n\nThe pizza was delicious! The sourdough crust really adds something and I must admit that all their pizza combinations were delicious! I'm sure I had a slice of at least everything they offered! My personal favorite was the Porky Pie with bacon, roasted garlic, and a garlic cream sauce!\n\nOverall, I had a very positive experience at Goat Hill Pizza.", "author": "Mark L."}

They sell pitchers of beer at a reasonable price.  What else could you want?  \n\nTheir delivered pizzas aren't as good as those eaten in house.  I think the in-box steaming  ruins the crust.

So you can imagine my disappointment when it didn't meet expectations.\n\nFirst, we ordered a minestrone soup to share, and a med combo pizza. We waited about 15 min before our soup came, now you would figure with all that time, they would have spent it heating UP the soup....but NOPE! Soup came lukewarm. Although the vegetables were plenty and fresh, it just didn't taste as good when it's not piking hot.\n\nThe pizza was good, but I definitely had better elsewhere.  All the ingredients on there made the pizza soggy and soupy in the middle and it was salty as hell.\n\nAnd worse yet, the SERVICE SUCKED!! Since it was so salty, I drank my entire glass of water quickly. No one came to refill it and I had to wave at least 5 times to get anyone's attention. Even then, the waitress never came by with the pitcher. Finally, my husband had to get up to grab a pitcher off the counter. You're better off bringing your own bottle of water, otherwise, be prepared to be thirsty.\n\nI hardly ever leave a small tip, but I did this time. I'll never come back anyways. I'm also glad I used a groupon because I sure as heck would not want to pay full price for this.", "author": "Jenny T."}

Boy, was it amazing.  Amazingly unimpressive and overrated, that is.  When I first entered the restaurant, I really liked the home-y feeling of the place.  The atmosphere is extremely family-friendly so it's quite noisy in there, but hey, I don't really mind that as long as some good food accompanies it.  \n\nNope, that was not to be.  Our party of three ordered a large pizza, half Mediterranean, half Californian.  The wait was maybe 10-15 minutes.  We kept ourselves occupied so it was  fine, but when the order came, we realized the kitchen got our order wrong and our half Californian turned into half Hawaiian.  The lady who we reported this to just kind of took the pizza away and then that was it.  After flagging down our waiter, he offered us complimentary garlic bread.  I don't know whether they were reject garlic breads or what, but I think even I can make better garlic bread than that.  It was soggy and soft and not appealing at all.  \n\nWhen our pizza finally came, along came my disappointment as well.  The Californian, which contained artichoke hearts, tomatoes, and garlic was bland.  I just ate this last night and to tell you the truth, I don't even remember how it tasted like cuz I simply didn't care for it.  The Mediterranean was slightly better.  It had a bit more flavor, maybe due to the feta, but that was pretty much it.  The crust was too chewy for me, but that really depends your own individual tastes.  By the end of our dinner, my friend found a fork brushing the top of her hair inches from her face, because our waiter accidentally dropped it as he was cleaning up our table.  He was probably nervous cuz he sensed our frustration.  Poor guy.\n\nOne more thing: I really like to drink my water during a meal and I would appreciate it if they had refilled my water when it was just sitting there empty for the majority of the meal.  Maybe I would've had a better experience if I came with children but you probably won't find me coming here again.", "author": "Vanessa C."}

How could I choose? The biggest plus, I think was the fact that they will add chopped garlic to any pizza for free. Mmmm...garlic automatically makes everything better.\n\nSo I ordered for delivery a large pizza with chicken, pesto, and chopped garlic, and a side of wings. This was a dinner for two, so don't think it was all for me. The pizza was so big! And as for the taste...amazing! The pizza came piping hot and they even give you paper plates, utensils, and napkins. Apparently, they do have the hearts of starving and lazy students in mind.\n\nI ordered from them a second time and did chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and of course chopped garlic. They did not disappoint. Except this time, I had to fork over the money for the pizza. And although $25 for a large pizza sounds like a steep price to pay...it's pretty well worth it.

However, when we were done, we asked for the check and our waiter said he'd be right back with it. 15 minutes pass by and we're still waiting for our check. One of us goes up to check on what's going on and they tell him that our check is coming. and we wait another 10 minutes. Another one of us checks again and still no check.

It wasn't a Monday night, but we loved it anyway. The pizza was great, the service was excellent, the views of the Bay were nice and it really had that neighborhood pizza parlor vibe that only a place that's been around for over 30 years can have. We quickly learned that their takeout is as good and that, of course, Monday-all-you-can-eat nights rock. \n\nGoing every Monday night for three years probably did contribute to the 10 or so lbs I put on...but I couldn't stay away from Andrea (or big mama as we affectionately called her), Jeff, the dreamy motorcycle-riding host who is no longer there but who would always manage to seat us loooong before our table was really up in the queue, or the guys in kitchen who knew to put three orders in when they'd see us walk in (one of hawaiian, one of sauceless pizza with feta cheese, and one of ground beef and chives--weird, yes, I know but delicious). \n\nOn summer nights when there's a long wait, it's fun to grab a pitcher of  something to enjoy while you wait. \n\nThis is the place where everyone knew our name and thanks to Monday night pizza, I now eat pizza with almost any kind of topping on it. Having all the wacky random toppings to try on pizzas, broadened my horizons and checked my preconceived notions as to what could be good on a pie. From the sourdough crusts, to the ranch dressing...  oh yes, it's amore.", "author": "Dee I."}

It's not necessarily bad pizza, but if this place was a delivery chain or something, I would definitely not choose this place over Round Table or Domino's.  \n\nGot a pizza that was half chicken florentine and half combo.  The chicken was kind of dry and that part of the pizza was really soggy.  The combo side was not as soggy, but the sausage had no flavor.

Did not know that Monday is Neighborhood Night, which means all you eat pizza and salad for $10.95, and if you get there after about 6:30, expect to wait a long time. This all you can eat deal is great idea if you're on a budget or have trouble focusing, since it means you can get 1 small slice of 10 different kinds of pizza and it adds up a quite a lot of variety. Crust is semolina on the bottom, kind of crunchy like home-made (in a good way). Salad bar was ok, nothing great. We got a pitcher of Lagunitas for an additional $10. Reminded me of my grad school grease-eating days. In support of this hypothesis: guy next to us was talking about his science projects to his eating partner, who clearly believed every word he was saying (he was overselling it, in my opinion). \n\nThe service here was harried but friendly. I wonder what it's like on a regular night, since the Monday night roundabout requires them to run back and forth calling out the names of the pizzas, in little circles all night long.

My boyfriend got a small jalapeno/pepperoni/roaster garlic/grilled red onion pizza (a make your own) which ended up being over $17 which is a lot of money for 5 slices. The roasted garlic was excessive, something like 25 whole cloves, maybe that would mean impressive to some, but I wasn't that into it.\n\nI ordered the half order of spaghetti and meatballs ($7.95) because I was feinding pasta all day...face it, January 1st=carbo loading. It was a little too close to a Denny's experience for me. Not fresh pasta, the bolognese sause was way too chunky and just dished like a half cup on top. The meatball (ya, one, singular) was aight. It was a lot of food for the price, but dude, I don't know who could eat a full order, I bet you could feed 2 people easily with a half order. Oh, also, the table next to us ordered a bottle of their house red and it was Crane Lake...like the $2.99 bottle, like shit I wouldn't drink in college...this is California, San Francisco no less, I think they could do a little better quality.\n\nThe ambiance is cute and quaint, red checker plastic table clothes and kid's art everywhere.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-09", "description": "I talk about Goat Hill Pizza all the time and I'm always surprised that not more people know about it.  Or maybe they've heard of it, but have never been.  Or maybe it's just that most people I know are normal, not insatiable, raging fat-asses like me.  But gluttony is in my blood.  I can't help it if I start salivating when I hear the words \"all-you-can-eat.\"\n\nGoat Hill holds a special place in my heart, and not because the last time I ate there, I ended up outside on the curb, puking obscenely mere minutes before I was forced by an evil ex to board the 22 for a 45-minute nightmare ride back to the Richmond instead of just taking a cab (one of the few instances I would have been okay paying more than $2 on transportation).  No, I love Goat Hill because their pizza is magical.  My instincts tell me that this is because they make the crust with sourdough, and trust me -- my instincts are awesome.\n\nEvery Monday, Goat Hill hosts \"Neighborhood Night,\" which means for $10.95, you get all the pizza you can stomach from 4pm-10pm, as well as unlimited trips to the (delicious, btw) salad bar.  As soon as you're seated, servers begin coming by to offer mini slices of fresh-out-of-the-oven pies boasting different toppings, some expected (pepperoni and black olives, anyone?) and some not-so-expected (anchovies, garlic, pineapple and linguica?  Pass).  Also, for those of you not super into eating the animals, there's always plenty of veggie pies making the rounds, so you have no excuse for being lame and not going.\n\nYou won't get seated unless your entire group is there, but you can buy beer and drink it outside while you wait -- pitchers of Anchor and Sierra Nevada aren't too shabby at $9.50 each.  You classier folk can get wasted off a liter of wine for only $11.25 (or drink even cheaper wine out of a travel coffee thermos -- my favorite trick -- on the bus ride over).  Be warned, however, that the ingestion of alcohol will leave less space in your body for food.  It may also cause you to do something you'll regret, like getting vajazzled. \n\nTo maximize the enjoyment of your Monday night experience at Goat Hill, I suggest going with several friends and challenging them to a down-and-dirty, no-holds-barred, all-you-can-conceivably-stuff-in-your-face pizza-eating contest.  Just don't tell anyone that the \"prize\" for the champ is spending the rest of the night crouched over the toilet clutching his or her distended belly.  Oh, and it's absolutely non-negotiable that you come wearing elastic-waist pants.  High school gym shorts are preferable in case you get sweaty.  Eating is a sport, after all.\n\nHow many places can you go, spend $10.95 on pizza and salad and be so filled with food and happiness that you'll probably throw up later?

The chef's salad was equally as good with plenty of ingredients to fill you up if pizza is not your thing. But let me tell you - I devoured two slices of the Greek pizza!

Mondays are a good day to come here when you're really hungry and you want to make good use of your money. If you're down for some pizza $10.95 will get you satisfied. The \"Neighborhood Night\" allows you to get all you can eat pizza and salad for just half the cost of ordering an XL pizza at any other joint.\n\nGreat place to eat out with some buddies and best yet, you don't have to argue with each other on what to have for toppings. Everyone can be satisfied with all veggie pizzas, to all meat pizzas. I personally like every single pizza that comes out. Although, when I see a veggie pizza I hesitate because I don't want to fill up on veggies when I can on the meaty ones. Sometimes I give in though to the temptation because the veggie ones look the most colorful... and you know what they're actually really good and flavorful, but I want MEAT! \n\nOther than that the pizza is not fantastic, but on a Monday night it's well worth it. The crust and cheese is what it's all about when it comes to pizza and I feel like the crust just have the texture I would like, but to each their own.\n\nSlices are cut small on Monday nights (my pics you can check out) , but at least you can try all different types of toppings and different combinations of pizza.", "author": "Michael J."}

They oblige and I was satisfied - a plus!\n\nBut for the life of me, I cannot recall what was on the pizza.  Silly, but I think it was a sausage with various vegetables on it.

Yeah, there's an all-you-can-eat pizza night on Mondays, i know, i know, but eh, I wasn't impressed.  You get herded to the back like cattle where you and your friend are placed in a very loud, crowded atmosphere and really cannot enjoy a moment  (even with the beer) because you're getting elbowed every 5 minutes if you want anchovy and pineapple flavored pizza.  Plus, you cannot carry a conversation without the feeling that the world is eavesdrooping on everything.\n\nYou get these slices that wouldn't be large enough to fit a toddler's hand and then you take two bites and, like indian scalps, you toss them on your plate like a bunch of wartime kills.  The experience was a bit barbaric come to think of it.  Ironically, every fifth or six free pizza was a politically correct veggie pizza. Awe.\n\nThe good was that with the all you can eat pizza is a salad bar option.  The beets were very good..the lettuce was rabbit or turtle fodder at best though.\n\nThe beer selection on tap was horrible.  Where was the budweiser pitchers for $4.50???  I was forced to order these weird naming home brewed stuff that wasn't very good.  So what.  You call it amber instead of beer.  Where's the budweiser or miller?  I mean, if you're trying to lure in customers by having an all you can eat night..which implies the place is catering to cheap customers like I met then, why the hell are you going to sell overpriced foamy puff-stuff???  It really didn't make sense.\n\nThe service was so-so.  The bearded dude dishing out beer was an aquarius like oasis in that he got us our beer right when we needed it.  The friendly, homely hostess was ok too.  The pizza servers were hit or miss...I felt like a seal being fed sardines at a waterworld show or somethun....\n\nIn the end, this all-u-can-eat experience cost $10/head.  Which means in the end, you're paying Xtra large pizza prices at a fraudulent discount.  Once you factor in the overpriced beer, you're looking at $35-37 bucks again.  The same as any old pizza joint.\n\nNow if it's $5/head for all you can eat and $1/head for all the beer you can drink, then, and only then, would I give this place 3 or 4 stars.", "author": "Tony U."}

Goat Hill uses sourdough for their crust and I like this because it adds a little crunch factor to their pies.  I usually stick to my normal ingredients of pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, salami.  They do have their own custom choices, however, including a Californian, a Mediterranean, a Portuguese, a Hawaiian, and a Greek.  They also offer an all-you-can-eat option on Monday nights.  Sadly I've yet to partake of this, but I fully intend to one of these days.  We used to get Goat Hill catered at work (from the other location) a lot, but not so much anymore.  What I've learned is Goat Hill tastes the best when eaten fresh.  Usually I'm a fan of cold or day-after pizza.  Not so much for Goat Hill, though.  I think it's something about their cheese that gets clunky when it's cold.  But if you do happen to end up with leftovers, my advice is to pop that bad boy in the toaster oven for a cycle to get the crust back to crunchy, then nuke it for a few seconds to get the cheese soft again.

And I like pizza, so that's saying a lot. \n\nAfter working in Bayview for 6months (which doesn't have very many dining facilities), I ventured out to the goat. BEST DECISION EVER. The pizza was awesome. We got 1/2 Mediterranean, 1/2 special (sausage, onions and mushrooms- such a good combo)! \n\nWhen I picked up my slice, the tip didn't droop, the toppings didn't slide off. Is this b/c there were too few toppings? NO! it's b/c they know how to make a fantastic crust that can withstand the pressure of pizza toppings! The cheese was delicious and the crust was fantastic. (Why do I suddenly want another one??) \n\nThe pizza was delicious! I could have eaten much more than I did, but tried to save my waistline a little bit... we all make sacrifices. \n\nI can't wait to go back for my next pizza! But the big question will be: should I get the deliciousness from last time or try something new? \n\nGo and enjoy- you wont be disappointed.", "author": "Jennifer K."}

The bacon had a good meat-fat ratio.\n\n- The chicken + spinach pizza was also fantastic.

It is kind of the pizza version of dim sum and it works. \n\nThe staff here is very courteous and friendly.

The crust is a medium-thickness, not paper thin, but not chicago-style either. Good balance of cheese and sauce. The toppings are top-notch quality and fresh. They have some unique topping combinations and the pizzas are reasonably priced. The pizza is no Little Star, but it's solid and the atmosphere makes up for it.\n\nIf you get a chance, do the pizza buffet. on Monday night.  I've done the all-you-can-eat pizza buffet on Monday nights a few times and it was amazing. They bring around different creative pizzas dim-sum style and you just pick and choose what you want to eat. Be warned however, that if you show up after 7pm, prepare to wait for an hour outside. Bring snacks. They have good beer selection, which is nice during that wait or with the pizza. They also serve pitchers. On buffet nights, there's also a small salad buffet with basic salad fixins- iceberg lettuce and various vegetables. The salad is nothing special, but then again who goes to a pizza buffet to eat salad anyway.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice- it's very family-oriented and I usually go with a group between 4 and 6 in size. The wait is usually reasonable unless it's Monday night. It's usually really warm inside. Sometimes a little too warm.

(A+!) \n\nTo the important part - THE GRUB! \nBrushetta - OMG.. SO GOOD. I could have  had brushetta all night.. it was seasoned so well. The bread was nice and crunchy, the tomatoes were fresh and .. MMM.. damn.. so good. \n\nCaprese Salad.. well, we were given olive oil and vinegar (on the side)with the salad, but we ate the salad without it.. because we thought it was already seasoned.. but after we all tried it.. we realized it had to be seasoned ourselves.. lol. So it wasn't a big hit, but that's cuz we didn't know any better hahah. \n\nI ordered a small vegetarian pizza.. I was trying to stay away from the saturated fat in pepperoni, although I LOVE me some pepperoni :( \nThe pizza had the perfect amount of cheese, sauce and toppings. It would've tasted |_____| this much better if there were tomatoes on it! My fault, should have  asked. \n\nJo ordered a full order of spaghetti w/ meatballs. The meatballs were yummy.. I tried the meat sauce.. it wasn't thick or meaty as I normally would like. So I personally wouldn't order the spaghetti here. I would stay safe and get the pizza. \n\nAdam & Mike ordered a XL manly pizza.. manly meaning the toppings were sausage, mushrooms, black olives and pepperoni. I tried a slice of their pizza and DAMN it was SOOO good. I was glancing at my vegetarian pizza a little sad, but happy that I had made a healthier decision.. haha. And then I grabbed another slice of their MANLY pizza. \n\nWhats even cooler, is they have a \"Bakers Dozen\" card. If you buy 12 pizzas, you get one free. Whoa..

I figured that the pizza would be out of this world so I soldiered on, mentally.\n\nWe had the caprese salad, which was ok but I could have made the same thing at home.  The pizza we had was half cheese, half med.  The med was better but too heavy on garlic.  The cheese side had a slightly overpowering taste of oregano.  The texture of the pizza and crust were good.  I had high hopes for a very sour, chewy sourdough crust but it didn't have much zing.\n\nOverall a fine experience.  I might try take out or dine in on a weeknight.

When I was wee lad, my family would order from the local pizzeria every Friday.  It was called Guy's Pizzeria.  They made one thing there: pizza.  It was owned by Guy DiMaggio and his wife.  Guy would flip the pizza dough into the air.  He was an immigrant and spoke broken English.  My father loved the dude because he was salt of the earth.  If Guy ever came to San Francisco he would be disgusted with about 90% of the pizza here.  How do I know this?  Because I am disgusted by 90% of the pizza here.  \n\nGoat Hill does not disgust me, but Guy would still be disappointed.  The pizza here is thin crust, but not truly Neapolitan.  The toppings are not overwhelming, but there are still too many.  I have never, and I mean never, understood why San Francisco pizzas are so overloaded with toppings.  Goat Hill has too many for a native East Coasters, but not as many as most California pizza places.  \n\nWhat I did like about Goat Hill is that it is a pizzeria and not a pizza restaurant.

I think you have to understand the atmosphere to get the most out of it, though.

And the dining environment is cozy and lively (i.e., loud at times), but that's part of the fun.\n\n2) You can't wait for the perfect pie.  -- The wait staff will bring out pizzas in pretty random order.  There are plenty of vegetarian offerings if that's your thing, but aside from that, try not to be too discriminating about toppings, because you'll never get fed.  All of their pizza is good, so just keep trying things as they come around.\n\n3) Plan to spend some time. -- The pizza slices are small, so if you have an appetite like mine, you really need to just make an evening of it.  :-)  You can ask the waiter for two slices at a time and they'll oblige, but that might be considered impolite, so I stopped doing that.   Just order a pitcher of beer, sit back and enjoy the experience.\n\n4) Don't forget the salad!  -- They have a table set up with salad and lots of fresh \"fixins\" (olives, tomatos, etc.) that should not be missed.

The hostess also sat us in the bay window, telling us it'd be quieter there and giving us a knowing look, but I still didn't get what she was talking about.  Finally, after about 20 minutes I heard an ear-piercing shriek, and it dawned on me: there are children here!  And not just one or two: it was pretty much families at every table.  I guess for me, children are not to be seen until heard.  Why is Goat Hill the happening family spot?  Beats me.  Maybe P-Hill is the new Noe or something.\n\nAnyway, the pizza itself is delicious, and I especially recommend the linguica, a portuguese variation on pepperoni that's full of spicy, earthy flavor.  The pizzas are deceptively dense and filling, too.  The wife and I split a 12\" which looked almost too small but, in fact, we could barely finish it.

First however, I will join the masses: yummy! Crust is the foundation for good pizza and this one of my favorites. Chewy but with a crunch, distinct but not overpowering sourdough flavor.\n\nNow, my 5 cents (you've heard they might be eliminating the penny, will all advice be worth more now?). As a lactard, I order my pizza sans cheese. Which unfortunately is not an option when you order by the slice. Here the cheese is a mozzarella/provolone mixture, provolone being an aged cheese, therefore less lactose (um probably not much of a difference but I will rationalize where I want to ). Also the amount of cheese is fairly light compared to many pizzerias. \n\nWhat else can I say? The lunch specials are a great deal. Slice (cheese plus two toppings) and salad is what, 5 bucks? The iced tea is amazing! Now that we've gone enough the waiters just know to bring us a pitcher. The one negative: I might bring a sweater, even on a warm day I feel like I'm sitting in a fridge.

Nothing spectacular, but if I'm not in the mood for either searching for parking or the huge calorie load that Little Star entails, this totally works.  We request the dough be thinner and cooked extra crispy and this gives it a great crust (I'm a fan of either super thin or ultra deep dish, crusts in between just bug me, but luckily this place will customize for you).  Theirs is actually a sourdough crust, which is sooo San Francisco.  The salads, bruschetta, and eggplant parm were all tasty too.  Medium pizza and a 32 oz Rogue were $32.  Not the cheapest place around, but decent.  The wait staff is really small, so it's not the speediest service, but once beer is in hand I'm not really minding a wait....

GHP also offers a wide variety of toppings, and the permutations and configurations of toppings is seemingly endless(I suggest the roast chicken with homemade pesto and sundried tomatoes and fresh chopped garlic, and the ham, mushroom, and sweet red onion).  The choice is yours, and choose wisely.  That said, if you can't choose, ask about the pizza of the day, it's usually a three topping combination offered which is a good default option.  \n\nGHP also offers on their menu some standard Italian cuisine fare, from pastas to italian sausage sandwiches, and some appeasing appetizers, but I recommend you stick to the meat and potatoes of the menu, figuratively speaking.\n\nAlso worthy of noting is the Monday all you can eat special, it would be wise to come early and hungry, as the line of eagerly waiting patrons can become substantially long as the night goes on.  But then, as a wise man once said, good food, including pizza, takes time.  Plus, if do you have to wait, just across the street is Delirious, where you can pick a new pair of kicks, which makes the wait seem not all that bad.", "author": "Michael P."}

I went to my first neighborhood night last night still a little stuffed from lunch but I figured I should just get it over with so I can finally say I've gone to one.  There was a bit of a wait at the door, but nothing outrageous.  We came at 7 pm and for a table of 2, we waited about 15 minutes.  \n\nI loved it!  I forgot about how full I was from earlier that day and I swear, I had like 10 slices.  No need to worry though, the slices are about half the slice of a regular one.  So in all actuality, I had 5 slices.  That's like eating half a pizza!  And a salad bar?  All for $10?  So I have to admit the pizza on Monday nights isn't as good as all the other nights - they don't serve their specials, like my fav - the Californian.  But it's instant gratification and for what you pay, I think it's a steal.    \n\nI have been here on other nights and for lunch during the day.  They have a pretty good lunch special - a mini pizza (which I can never finish) or a pizza and a salad deal all for about $5.  Service here is okay, nothing outstanding.

I recommend bringing a bunch of friends and making a nite of it. It's unhealthy and fun at the same time. We tend to bring a sharpie and tally who can eat the most slices (crust not included). Get there early to partake in this, as there's always a line and hard to get seating on that particular nite. May be because it's only $10.95 to partake in such goodness? The servers walk around with slices of various pizzas and you can just pick and choose as many as you want. It gets pretty filling by the end of the nite. Perhaps wear some pants with stretch in them as your belly will be full. This nite also includes an all you can eat salad bar. \n(Imagine all you can eat pizza & beer. I wish. That would probably make for a mess, as I'm sure people would be wasted and make the bathroom all icky.)\n\nAnyway... from having tried many a slice from the all you can eat goodness..my favorites are anything with linguica.

How much f-ing pizza do you really need? He got mad at me.\n\nThat aside, I liked the place a lot. Lucky we got there at 5:30 and were seated immediately; by 5:45 there was a line stretching all the way down the block to the Pets R Us on Potrero.\n\nThe pizza? Delicious. Sourdough crust. Pungent sauce. Piping hot. Cute servers come by every 2-3 minutes offering you a slice of the latest pie to pop out of the oven. Artichoke with garlic and tomatoes. Chicken with green olives and feta. Salami. Plain cheese. Pesto. And they had the foresight to make the slices small, so you can chill out at the restaurant for a while, rather than fill up too quick. So it takes you more like 40 minutes before you feel like you're going to puke your stomach out, not 5.\n\nAt one point a server came by with \"pepperoni\" but it sounded to me like he'd said \"mac and cheese.\" Wouldn't that be cool? Pizza with mac and cheese on it? I think so.\n\nSalad bar: great blue cheese dressing. Atmosphere: crowded, loud and very cool. Service: fast and friendly. Pitcher of Anchor Steam we got: only $9. That's rougly $2.25 per pint. Hoorah.\n\nI do recommend this place. Just get there early, and you'd be loving life if you came after getting high. Yeah -- I mean high on life!", "author": "Dan N."}

Three kinds of meat, distributed liberally but not overwhelmingly across the pie.\n\nOn Monday's, Goat Hill has a special all you can eat night. They bake a bunch of different kinds of pizzas and carry them around table to table.

I've gone several times now and I have to say that its been a pretty mixed bag.  Sometimes the food & service is great.  Other times, I'm extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with the service.  Here are some examples:\n\nOnce, I went there and there was a group of us.  The waitress was very abrupt and it was hard to get service.  We waited and waited and this was during our lunch hour.  When, we finally got the food, we were starving and gobbled up the food.  Later, when we went to go pay the bill, that too seemed to take an eternity.\n\nAnother time, I ordered the pesto pizza.  The order was wrong so I sent it back to the kitchen.  The waiter apologized and then not more then 3 minutes later, the slice of pizza returned with a big glob of pesto slathered on top.  Somewhat naive, I thought oh maybe they just picked up the wrong one.  But, when I bit into it, it was clear that it was the same pizza I had sent back with cold pesto paste slapped out on top.  Boo.\n\nStill, despite all my bad experiences, somehow I just keep finding myself back here, mostly because my friends love it.  I do have to say the meatballs are delicious.

Nice of them.  So, I had to try it, since what did I have to lose, right?\n\nI've been to the restaurant on Potrero Hill, so I have some idea of what their pizza is like.  But, (there's always a \"but\" right?!!?) I'm an east coast native (first 25 yrs of my existence), I am a self-proclaimed pizza snob.  I have lived in SF for 20 years, and mostly have sworn off pizza, cuz most places -- and I do mean *most* -- are downright awful.  Californians simply don't know how to make a great pizza.  I'm talking about pizza from a pizza joint, btw not some froufrou pizza that costs $20 and barely feeds one person.\n\nSo, with that as a preface, I give Goat Hill's delivery in SOMA 2 stars.  The service on the phone was excellent...took my order and got it right.\n\nThe pizza arrived well ahead of schedule, the delivery guy was professional, and the pizza was piping hot.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nThe pizza itself was ok.  Not great, not terrible either.  The toppings I chose were chicken and artichoke hearts.  There was a decent amount of chicken, but the 'chokes were all but non-existent.  I also ordered soy cheese on one half and mozzarella on the other.  (They got this right, too!)\n\nBut what they heck is it with California pizza places and not putting tomato sauce on pizzas as standard fare?  For the life of me, I do not understand this.  Tomato sauce is not a topping!  It's part of the 3 required components of a great pizza -- dough, cheese and tomato sauce.  Sigh.\n\nIn the end, the 'za was ok, as I said already.  The soy cheese was good quality.  The crust was by far the best part.\n\nWould I order from them again for delivery?  Only if I was having company who insisted I serve pizza.

Plenty of choices on the menu and the usual choice of toppings\n2. You can choose between thick and thin crust which is nice - I'm a thin crust kinda guy\n3. Service was very good and all food items were served in a timely manner\n4. Good wait staff who come by frequently to check if we need anything else\n5. Cheap prices (large pizza + garlic bread + 2 beers = $35.00)\n6. Great views from that side of Portrero Hill of downtown SF and nice location for a post meal walk to work those calf muscles!\n\nCONS:\n1. It does border on greasy (Mind you, this is after I've been to Pauline's Pizza and am saying it with that perspective)\n2. Parking can be tough \n\nAll in all, neat place. Pizza is not a regular part of my menu but I'd be up for hitting this with friends after a long day or on a nice warm summer night to grab a slice on my own.", "author": "Amit S."}

The lunch combos include a slice of pizza with your choice of two toppings and a salad.  With 22 different pizza toppings, we're talking combinations galore--and there is no way that they would be able to get you in and out of the place in under an hour if they had to custom make every pizza.  I'm not exactly sure what their technique is, but it must include building a base cheese pizza and reheating with the toppings before serving.  \n\nA bit generic, though I would bet the Monday night pizza buffet feels more homemade since they can turn out whole pizzas at a time.  \n\nSometimes my pizza comes out cold..major bummer.", "author": "Monica T."}

An event always popular for my pizza-loving, cheap-date guy friends.  And one I don't mind tagging along for, since (1) pizza is one of those things you crave once in a while, (2) On Monday nights, you get to sample a bunch of different kinds of pizza, dim sum style.  The slices are small enough that you can sample all of their concoctions, traditional and non-, without stuffing yourself silly. \n\nI had the same thought as another reviewer...at times it seemed like some of their creations were just an attempt to \"get rid of our leftovers!\" (Asparagus on pizza?  Sounds weird, but not too bad!)  But generally, they were all winners!  As part of this deal, you also get an all-you-can-eat salad, but I didn't find their salad bar all that impressive - their vinaigrette was a little too oily for me, and it seemed like there was more iceberg than not.  But for $9.95, beggars can't be choosers!\n\nThe best time to go is right when they begin at 5:00p.  You wait for a short time for a table, and you'll get to see the first circulation of pizza pies. However, if you want seconds of something, it is a bit of a gamble, since what comes out of the oven is pretty random.  I found the wait staff pretty friendly, and since the place is so neighbor-hoody, the overall energy is good - you'll find people enjoying each other's company.\n\nI would totally recommend this place for: People on a budget, families, hanging out with friends, pizza lovers.\n\nI would not recommend it for people who are about to go to the 7p salsa lesson at Cafe Cocomo.", "author": "Gail O."}

You see, I believe that Pizza comes with the three major food groups, cheese, tomato sauce and pepperoni.  Oh hang on, I forgot the all important ranch dressing food group (check the USDA pyramid, its on there, at the top) to dip the crust into.  Goat Hill never disappoints, they use a sourdough crust that is easy on the sour but never short of crunch, beautifully thin but it holds up perfectly under the weight of the toppings.  \n\nWe regularly get pizza delivered which comes from a different location but the quality is consistent whether you dine in or take out.  The best thing about Goat Hill is that it doesn't try and emulate the pies found on the East Coast but also resists the temptation to Californicate the ethos of the dish as dictated by the Italians.

Along the way, I managed to pour a handful of unlabeled dressing which strangely resembled pure olive oil and exclaimed \"CRAP!\" while the guy behind me laughed. \n\nThe layout is dim sum pizza style for a FAT fee of $10.95. Trays and trays of different types of delicious hot slices of pizza were brought by your table and you get to say \"yay or nay\" to it. To pace myself cause my eyes are always bigger than my small tummy, I kept asking them for a small slice. Of course, after merry-go-round of small slices, the only evidence of the meal were the leftover crusts. Total slices inhaled by me-6. Mike was smart, he left no evidence. \n\nOne of the server lady was sweet as pecan pie and was calling everyone \"honey\" and \"darling\" which made the whole place even more quaint. On the walls were multiple pieces of art by a local artist and if you know of anyone interested in showing their pieces, you can call in and put in a request. \n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this place. It's cute with great service and great choice options for everyone. Totally against any type of diet out there, but life is short and an occasional carbfest never killed anyone....yet.", "author": "Sophie C."}

I'll have to find and try that someday.\n\nThis place reminds me of some of the pizzerias I used to go to as a kid.  Casual dining, plastic table \"cloths\" and the whole joint smelling like a giant pizza.  Luckily the pizza is a lot better than those places I used to go.  It also tends heavily toward that family dining atmosphere, so you might want to avoid coming here if you're really wasted.\n\nIt was Friday night.  We were seated quickly and received our pizza in about 12 minutes.  One thing I instantly noticed is the crust.  It's almost, well... perfect.  Yeah, it tastes like regular old pizza crust but the ratios are perfect.  The pizza wasn't thin crust but at the same time, didn't feel like I was eating a bread boat with each slice.  The toppings and cheese were well portioned as well and one bite didn't result in my ripping the cheese off into my lap and me cussing like a sailor.  In the end you feel like you've had some good pizza and not half a loaf of garlic bread.  \n\nI thought their cheapest salad left something to be desired.  I know it was only $4, but I've had more bountiful pre-pizza salads for cheaper, although the kidney and garbanzo beans were a nice touch.

However, we seemed to arrive right at the moment they were slammed, so while the staff was all very nice and friendly, service was extremely slow and not attentive. We waited about 30 minutes for a table, and were seated with no menus and no drinks. We waited about twenty minutes before someone passed and noticed we hadn't been helped. Finally, our waitress took our orders for drinks and dinner. When another waitress returned with drinks, we realized we had forgotten to order an entree for one of the kids (!) and placed our order then. Then we waited, and waited. They initially forgot to bring water for everyone, and only brought out beer and wine; we had to ask for water again. Then our late-ordered pasta entree came out, ahead of all the other food (including our appetizer) that we'd ordered. Fortunately it was for our son who was at the end of his rope waiting for dinner. 15 minutes later we had our appetizer and water, then finally, another 10 minutes or so, we got our pizza....after the people at the table next to us, who were seated after us, got their food. Despite the chaos, all the food was very good. The bruschetta is three *huge* pieces of soft yummy Italian bread topped with generous chunks of tomato. We got the Hilda's Favorite and Portuguese pizzas, which were also very good. My son loved his ravioli and meatballs.

You know that feeling when you're extremely tired, but you know that lying down will just induce....something quite unpleasant because your tummy is jam packed?  Well, that's me right about now.  Waking up for work tomorrow is going to be a nightmare.  Ugh.  BUT, this is not to say that I won't be returning to Goat Hill Pizza.....\n\nCame here tonight for the first time with some friends per DC and his wifey's recommendation (great pick, D & W!).  Monday nights are the way to go with this place, as it's all you can eat pizza and salad for around $10 (the bf asked why I had even bothered gymming prior to all you can eat pizza, and I replied, \"Duh!  So I can eat all you can eat pizza!!\")!  Show up early, as the wait can be hit or miss (thanks, T, for arriving early and ensuring the rest of us scavengers a seat!).\n\nSo here's how it works: this place is like a dim sum joint except instead of serving dim sum, you get pizza (duh)!  Waitstaff, each with a pizza tray in hand, float around the restaurant, visiting table to table, offering hot, slim, thin crust sourdough (I normally am anti-sourdough, but this place was yum!  I couldn't even detect any sour-ness in the crust!) slices of deliciousness.  And what's great about this pizza buffet is the various toppings that make their way onto numerous pizza combinations.  There's cheese, feta, pesto, garlic, tomatoes, onions, red onions, bell peppers, black olives, green olives, artichoke, spinach, mushroom, pineapple, jalapeno, hamburger, ham, salami, pepperoni, linguica, and sausage (did I get them all?).  Out of the twelve slices I ate (remember, the slices are cut small, so you can try all the variations..and I didn't eat my crusts), my favorite was the pesto tomato black olive.  Then again, by the sixth or seventh slice, I had already begun to lose track of what I had eaten.\n\nService was very friendly.  The employees were unfazed as ravenous patrons thrust plate after plate into their faces.  After we left the restaurant, a couple employees were outside on their breaks, but still thanked us and said bye.  They even cautioned against getting cramps as we trekked up the slight incline on Connecticut, heavy stomached, back to our cars. \n\nThe only con I noticed was that when we first sat down, it was as if the employees were tag-teaming each other, approaching us every couple of minutes with new pizza offerings; the pizza seemed limitless.  However, after these first few rounds of pizza slices, there was a huge lull.  We sat around for what had to have been at least 15 minutes before the next pizza began circulating the restaurant, and even then, it was another 5 - 10 minutes before the pizza after that arrived.  As I sat there waiting for more pizza, my hunger slowly disappeared (in hindsight, maybe this was a good thing, since I am still so stuffed right now).\n\nOh, yeah, the all you can eat salad bar?  I didn't even bother taking a peek at it.  It was a very tiny bar, with, I'm assuming the regular fixings...but who wants salad?  Bring on the pizza!!", "author": "Mel T."}

I heard about it a couple of times by a couple of friends. I was meeting a friend out for dinner and said let's give it a whirl.  The neighborhood is nice, easy parking. The place looks kinda cool on the outside. You walk in and it starts looking more like a run down pizza parlor chain.  I read many reviews on here about how the wait staff was wonderful. Well, our waiter was far from good, and even seemed to have trouble taking our order, and I think I\"m being nice in leaving it at that.  We got a half and half pizza, plus garlic cheese bread. The bread came out and was abundant but nothing fantastic.  The pizza came out and looked pretty good but after biting in it just seemed average at best.  The crust was nice and crunchy, i like that, yet it seemed so manufactured and almost too perfectly even all over. The view from our table was nice. I'd say the view was the only great thing in the place.  It appears that this place is well thought of for their Monday night all you can eat. Well, I have never seen real high quality all you can eat anything except maybe an 80 dollar buffet in Vegas and even that wasn't true high quality if you ask me. So, if you want to stuff you face with avg pizza and feel like you're kind of in a brightly lit fluorescent cafeteria that hopes to fill it's seats with screaming kids and cheap parents,, then this is your place.

Whoever the manager or owner is, should be aware that terribly rude staff members do your business harm.  No one wants to be treated poorly... especially as a paying customer.  Very unfortunate.

I have a feeling if I hadn't taken that precaution it would've arrived a bit soggy.  There was plenty of cheese, but it was pretty flavourless.  So there you go in a nutshell.

And she made a good point: a plain cheese pizza is the test of whether a pizza is truly good or not, because there's no hiding the quality of the dough, the cheese, and the sauce under lots of toppings.

So anyway, I came back for a slice a few times in the past few weeks, since this pizza place is near where I work. I had actually missed my T-train and another one would cause me to miss my Ferry back to Vallejo, so anyway had to call the hubby and have him pick me up. Meanwhile, I was ravenous and decided to take the 22 up to 18Th street and scope out some grub. I didn't want to spend a lot so I went with Goat Hill pizza, and got myself 2 slices while I waited for him to arrive. I had a mushroom and pineapple and a garlic and olive slice. Boy where those good and BOY do they ever pile on that garlic. I have to say the wait was long and I felt kind of ignored even though I was sitting there ready to order. So so much for quick service. I also didn't;t enjoy having to sit there by myself since I felt like all the rich \"yuppies\" were staring me down along with the ditsy blonde's who apparently have no other worries in their life, besides trying to decide on what to order. But overall, not a bad pizza place at all, in fact it's my 3rd favorite in the city, and love how crispy and thin the crust is. My only recommendation is, don't eat in unless there's someone with you, or you'll feel rather ignored and stared at.", "author": "Petra S."}

I was super excited to eat my presumably delicious slice of pizza. There was plenty of sausage, which tasted pretty good, but the pizza itself was kind of whatever.  I have a feeling my slice might have been sitting around for awhile before they reheated it again for my order. There was barely any sauce and the crust was lacking flavor.

The service was friendly and efficient. The only thing was the slices were pretty thin so I didn't feel like I was getting a lot. But our tab with tip was just $9 each. Excellent deal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-11-03", "description": "This past weekend some friends and I were in the hood and decided upon Goat Hill Pizza for a late lunch (~2pm).  We got in, and while waiting to be seated (per the sign), noticed that 3 staff members were carving pumpkins for Halloween.  Okay so these guys have spirit, i thought to myself - great!  We were seated after a few minutes towards the back half of the seating area, and there were about 10 people in the restaurant at that time.\n\nA lady (owner maybe?) came to take our order and my friend (mistakenly) asked how large the pizzas were.  Instead of giving us an answer, she rudely replied \"It's written right on the menu\".  So we checked the menu again and couldn't find it - and maybe we're blind - but I think that as someone in the service industry, she should have just given us a polite answer instead of pointing to the menu.  That was strike #1.\n\nSo we ordered food, and ice teas and lemonades (which are supposed to be bottomless) and got the drinks after a few minutes.  But the bottomless part never happened.  Strike #2.  In fact nothing after receiving the drinks ever happened.  \n\nMaybe we were too patient... but after 1/2 hour we realized no one had been back to our table... no drinks, no food.  And by this time mind you, the restaurant was completely empty of patrons.  So no real excuse to take that long, right?\n\nWe kept talking amongst ourselves and at 50 minutes, my friend got up and asked the guy at the back of the kitchen who was sweeping up about our order.  He had no idea about our order and summoned a younger female waitress who came to our table and said, \"oh let me check on your order, it should be out soon\".  Then she went up and consulted with the (owner?) lady who started to check her computer for the order.  (i mean, really?  you need a computer?  it's a small place, there are no other customers, and your entire wait staff is at the front making jack-o-lanters instead of pizzas... it's not that hard to keep an eye on your only outstanding order, and your only foodless table).  She said the order never made its way to the kitchen blaming the computer for the glitch and apologized.\n\nNever in my restaurant-dining-life have I experienced placing an order for 4 people in an EMPTY restaurant and have it (1) not be put through, and (2) not have anyone attend to us, even to refill our drinks if nothing else!!  We were completely ignored!!!  Strike #3.\n\nSo we upped and left in search of actual food.  We offered to pay for the drinks and she said don't worry about it (which was nice i guess), but after having waited over an HOUR, that was the very least she could do.\n\nWhile this may have been a one-off experience, there are far too many AMAZING pizza places in the city with good customer service and ATTENTIVE wait staff/owners to bother coming back to one that has such abysmal customer service such as this one.  Also, judging by the other reviews, it seems that there's a pattern of rudeness and nonchalance by the staff here, and since we never got to try the pizza, that's really all it boils down to in this case.\n\nNeedless to say we won't be going back there again.", "author": "Ani S."}

You could order a pitcher, garlic bread for 3 people be stuffed and have a $40 bill... just don't get stuck in the front!\n\nI'd give 4 stars if I didn't have to sit in the front sometimes, and if they weren't so rude to me on my birthday the first time I came here! I might go 4 stars eventually if I have some good repeat experiences", "author": "Brian E."}

It was really crunchy and had a nice, but not overpowering tang to it. The toppings, though, didn't really do it justice. We got the day's special, which was eggplant, pesto, and tomatoes. I don't know what I was expecting, but the tomatoes were NOT good. They were the barely pink, tasteless grocery store kind. The other toppings were better, but nothing special. I found the cheese quantity to be bordering on excessive, and I really like cheese. Nothing was WRONG exactly, but the crust was really delicious, and the toppings could have been on your average late-night delivery pizza.

After moving away from the Hill, my only option is to have my pizza delivered from the SOMA location. So I called last Friday for a delivery, but it never showed up. I called and talked to Roger about an hour after my initial order, and he assured me that it would be arriving any time since all pizzas had gone out, and didn't bother to ask me any details before he hung up on me. About an hour later I called back and he tried to brush me off, so I yelled at him and he then became a little more agreeable. He told me that the driver gave my pizza away to someone in Potrero Hill. I didn't know they delivered to Potrero Hill. He didn't do much to assuage my anger, other than to offer to bake another pizza. I didn't feel like waiting another two hours so I said no thanks. While he supposedly refunded my credit card, he didn't seem to concerned about customer service, and whether or not I'd ever order from them again. \n\nIf this review was only about the pizza, I'd give it 5 stars. If it was just for the poor service from the delivery, I'd give it a negative star (if we could do that).

Soup and pizza shouldn't be too tough, right?  The sourdough crust was great, but the sauce overpowered the lightness of the toppings (we got the greek) and cheese (half regular, half soy). And the minestrone soup was way too garlicky for my taste (but it was vegetarian!). I think I'll stick with Pauline's, Gaspare's, and/or Pizzetta 211 for now.", "author": "Bee H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-03-30", "description": "Update: Went to Goat Hill this weekend and was sadly disappointed. The slices were about half the size they used to be, the toppings were pathetic (literally 3 very thinly sliced, small pieces of mushroom and about 4 or 5 small pieces of onion...come on!), and the crust was burnt. Maybe it was just a bad day? Alas, one star gone...\n\nWhy oh why does no pizza place in California seem to know how to make decent crust? I've asked myself (and friends) this question on more occasions than I'd like to remember?! Is it the climate? Doubt it. Is it the lack of good ingredients? Nope, don't think so. Do Californians really PREFER soggy, doughy crust (this was my friend's hypothesis)? Somehow I'm not buying that either, though.  Whatever the reason, six years of living in this city has taught me that, when eating pizza, unless you are ready to shell out some cash at a real Italian restaurant or lower your expectations significantly, you're going to be disappointed. That said, when I do try to, shall we say, adjust, my expectations, Goat Hill Pizza is the place I choose.  \nThe toppings are fresh, the sauce is flavorful enough, and while the crust is certainly not what I would call wonderful, at least you don't feel like you've just bitten into a piece of microwaved styro-foam. The salads are pretty decent too.\nSo...leave behind any expectations of crispy crust or east coast pizza and Goat Hill should do the trick.", "author": "SL N."}

I didn't get a chance to act until last Saturday, when I was in the neighborhood taking photos and hunger attacked.\n\nSo, I thought of Goat Hill Pizza - with such a cute name and such high praise from Yelpers -- how could we go wrong?  We should have stuck with the plan to go to Chez Maman. Seriously.  \n\nThe experience was just okay.  First of all, the wait-staff were slow and indifferent - especially considering it wasn't busy when we arrived!   When we first walked in and the hostess finally noticed us -- she waved us off and said she'd be with us in a minute.  Normally I would have waited, but we were cold and hungry, so I asked if we could just sit at the counter.   When a waiter finally showed up to give us our menus and then when we finally took our order, we chose the Mediterranean salad and a medium pizza (1/2 Hawaiian and 1/2 Gourmet Greek).  \n\nIt took more than 45 minutes after we ordered for the food to arrive.  The salad was okay -- iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, red onions, salami, etc  I was unimpressed with the choice of iceberg lettuce.  The pizza was mediocre -- the crust wasn't that great and the flavor was pretty boring (I expected garlic on our Greek Gourmet pizza) -- I only had two pieces because it wasn't really worth it.  It was pretty late in the day and I would rather go home and have something better.  We ate, paid our bill, and left.  The whole process was way too long and not worth it.  \n\nNext time - if I am that close to Chez Maman, I am going there instead!", "author": "Sadie S."}

Allow me to elaborate....the way the restaurant is set up is a little strange.  There are 3 different dining areas.  There is one when you first walk in, the back dining room, and in between those areas is an awkward hallway with tables, where, in my opinion, tables shouldn't be.  This is where they sat us. Also, when we were about 3/4 done with our meal, a waitress sat a family of 4 right next to us, practically on our laps, while almost the whole dining room behind us had many open tables.  The tables are really close to each other, too close for comfort.  I felt uncomfortable to even continue having a conversation because all of a sudden I had 4 strangers listening.  I really don't understand why servers do that.  Do they not think people are going to care?  I could understand if the place was busy and there was nowhere else, but that wasn't the case at all. The restaurant is also very kid-friendly so if kids being kids isn't your thing, you'll want to order it to go.\n\nBut with that being said, the pizza is really freaking good with a slightly upscale appeal but it's really not that type of restaurant.  I like how a small is big enough for two people. My only complaint would be that its slightly on the bland side but I added a little salt and it was perfect.

Husband and I went here and ordered an order of the chicken wings, 2 slices of pizza and a spaghetti with meatballs.  The spaghetti was pretty bad.  We didn't even take the leftovers home (and it was mostly leftovers).  That was pretty expected though since most pizza places don't have good pasta but the hubby can never resist spaghetti and meatballs.  The pizza was decent but not excellent by any means.  I got a slice with pesto and sausage and the husband got sausage with jalapenos.  Don't get me wrong, they were above average but not by much.  Maybe it was because we didn't get a whole pie, just individual slices so maybe the pizza had been sitting out for awhile and then reheated.  Especially since my company orders this pizza all the time and I remembered it tasting better.  Surprisingly the chicken wings was the standout item!  They were baked instead of fried and came with some delish ranch dressing on the side.  YUM!  Overall a great value for $15 (groupon + tax and tip).", "author": "Susan L."}

Red or white house wine is available by the glass, half-liter, or liter, and Anchor Steam, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Gordon Biersch Marzen, and Lagunitas Pils are sold by the mug, pint, or pitcher; bottled beers are also available.

Portrero Hill was once called Goat Hill and sometime in recent history someone started this urban delight and started selling some damned fine pizza.  Really good ingredients, fine staff, good vision and delivery and a commitment to the neighborhood and city, along with human values make this a really fine community partner for many causes they support in many different ways.  I stopped by last week and ordered a sausage and onion to take home, and read the paper while waiting, the local paper from the hill, and damn if when I got home they'd made a mistake or I mad and it was a mushroom and onion pizza with at least a pound of really fine shrooms, great crust, sauce and cheese, blistered just right and crunchy, crispy the right way.  I wanted to cry because I hate shrooms, but it was too late to call back and exchange it, they'd closed.  Still my SF favorite for many reasons.", "author": "Stu S."}

Naturally, the first thing I thought was not, \"Why is the word 'BUTTS' written on my arm in sharpee,\" but \"PIZZA!!!!\" I sauntered over to Goat Hill were I was greeted by the most delightful gent. He was tall and classy and looked like the sort of man who knows all the lyrics to \"Puttin on the Ritz.\" He seated me promptly at a table overlooking that glorious city that had wronged me so. Suddenly, I remembered that I was lactose intolerant and said \"FUCK!!!! FUCK\" really loudly. My dear host rushed over to ask what was the problem and how could he solve it. I told him my digestive troubles and he said, \"Why, we have soy cheese here at Goat Hill!\" I smiled and clapped my hands and we did a jig. My pizza was so delicious, it was if Julia Child came back from the dead and cooked it herself. And it was all mine. Greedily, I scarfed down the entire thing, along with a pitcher of Anchor Steam.

April is pizza month so I thought I'd try something new and a little out of my bubble. Goat Hill is mainly known for their all you can eat Monday special but I didn't want to fight the crowd so decided to check this place out on a slow Sunday night. The wine selection was small and mediocre. They did have some decent bottles of beer by the bottle. We started off with a salad which was chock full of tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, feta cheese.  The garlic bread that came with the salad was warm, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. We ordered the specialty pizza with everything on it. What was great about this pizza was that it was filled with toppings and the crust was not too thick, not too thin and super crispy --- even on the bottom.
