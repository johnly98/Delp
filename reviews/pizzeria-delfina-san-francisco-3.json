I've been meaning to try Pizzeria Delfina for years, but never got around to it. When I moved in right down the street, it was fate.\n\nEven on a Tuesday evening, the place is bustling at dinnertime with a line out the door. There were only two of us, so we chose to sit at the bar and avoid the longer wait for a table. Our server was so friendly - she let us taste a couple of wines to help us decide, and we chose the fantastic Nebbiolo.  We ordered a classic margherita pizza, which just melts in your mouth and the crust is unforgettable. One pizza was more than enough for the two of us. Though we were full, we couldn't help but order the chocolate mousse for dessert. \n\nThe place is busy, but the ambience is comfortable. Overall, it was a great night with fantastic food.", "author": "Apoorva A."}

Very salty capers anchovies olives. The tomatoes were bright and tasty. She said the tomatoes were from cans\n\nWe were befuddled tho, because we couldn't taste or see cheese. I flagged the waitress down. She confirmed there was no cheese. She said \"oops sorry\"\n\nWeird, since she was the one who  talked us into ordering the cheese!\n\nAlso they added a $3.50 sf mandate fee to the bill.   This means for everyone at your table, they pay $1.75 each.  It adds up!!!\n\nSo watch it when you tip. There's lots of added fees and taxes to the grand total.

Customers who came 15 mins after us had to wait. \n\n*Food came out quick and service is good\n\n*Crust was one of the best I've ever had with a perfect crisp, tomato sauce tasted so fresh\n\n*Other toppings were good to me but not the best I've had. We ordered a Margherita Pizza but the waiter brought out a pizza and said it was 4 cheese. When we said we ordered Margherita he said \"oh yes it is\". It didn't look like a typical Margherita but we took it anyway. The arugula and prosciutto pizza was messy to eat but I guess there's nothing you can do about it unless you want to fold the slice in half. I'd like to order the Margherita again since my bf had it prior and said it looked different. Regardless, what we got was good. The crust and sauce sold me. I'd also like to try the clam pizza next time!", "author": "Sarah W."}

We were hungry and still had to drive back to San Jose. We stoped by this place and put our name on the chalkboard. A group of 10 were ahead of us and were instructed where their table would be once it opened up. 2 tables had opened up, one of which was to be ours and our host confirmed. That party decided to just sit and take the 2 tables that opened up. The host (may have even been the mgr) apologized to us. We were finally seated and ordered. \nWe were greeted with a wonderful salad complimentary from the kitchen. We thanked the host. I don't like tomatoes, but these were the sweetest ones on the block and I devoured almost the entire plate single-handedly. I would have loved to save those tomato seeds to grow back home in Hawaii. I ordered the Napoletana pizza as I adore anchovies, olives and capers. I was concerned that the crust was super thin, almost wafer-like. Wrong. The flavor is insane and intense. Best pizza hands down. The man got 4 Formaggi and he and the teen wolfed it down. We ended the night with a dessert similar to pudding but butterscotch, again, compliments of the kitchen. Not overly sweet but hit the spot. Yes, we tipped heavily but the service was exceptional and they kept checking in on us, knowing we had a grueling day. And the food was beyond delicious. Beyond. I have not read reviews on this place as we were in the area and other restaurants didn't seem to catch our eye.

The tables were close together and there were little tables outside. The staff greeted us, and quickly seated us. They explained the menu and gave us a chance to review the menu. The people next to us were enjoying an appetizer, and a salad, and had their pizza delivered while we were thinking about what to order. They definitely over ordered, so we decided to share a pizza. We ordered the prosciutto pizza, and it was topped with an arugula salad, so it was the best of both. The pizza was big enough to share and packed with delicious flavor. The crust was thin and chewy, and a great base for the simple toppings. I love prosciutto and the arugula complimented it so well and balanced the saltiness. We enjoyed every bite and had room left over to try ice cream for dessert.... check out my other review.", "author": "Sandra V."}

While this location can get busy for dinner, pick-up times are fairly quick (lucky for us locals). The location is great - right off of Fillmore and right next to Smitten (wink, wink).

Staff was friendly and attentive.\n\nOrdered the standard margherita. Asked the difference between dop and standard margherita and it was the tomato and cheese. Dop used buffalo mozzarella and San marzano tomatoes. We also got a side dish of fresh dried oregano, chili flakes, and parmesan. We also had some tableside thin bread sticks. They are passable unless you want something to tie you over.\n\nThe margherita was delicious and crust nice. Tomatoes were sour and had more of a tang with the mozzarella being very mild and bland. My friend got the Dop which I was able to try a slice. The pizza was totally different and I would have much rather gotten that one. If eating here I would 100% say to pay a bit more for the Dop. Tomatoes were much sweeter with less tang and mozzarella seemingly having more flavor. Was a yummy pizza place and would go again. Love the Neopolitan style.", "author": "Kimberly Y."}

Highly recommend.  2) The pizzas are just \"OK\".  I don't like pizzas without tomato sauce, and many of them don't come with tomato sauce.  If you like white pies, you may enjoy this place more than I did.  The margherita is decent, and I like the pizza with cherrystone clams. Salsiccia pizza is loaded with too much sausage for the delicate crust, and fennel flavor was overwhelming for me.  Sometimes the crust on pizzas is soggy, if they overload it with toppings or sauce.  3) Mussells with lemon and garlic are good.  4) Deserts aren't anything special.  Smitten, Salt and Straw, and Sift Cupcakes are all close by though.  \n\nOverall the food and service are good.  However -- the wait can be long.  There isn't a comfortable place to wait for a table, so people pack the front entry.  They have a bar area that's too tightly packed and not comfortable at all - they need to remove a chair or two.  I feel like I'm eating with t-rex arms so I don't bump the person next to me.  The tables and booths are better, but is loud at peak times.  \n\nIt's not crazy expensive, but for the money, you can get a higher standard of service and a more comfortable visit (try the Elite Cafe around the corner).", "author": "Holly P."}

I liked their ambience and the service overall was great. The pizza itself was what I had to give 3 stars to. \n\nNow, I am someone who can never finish their food and always asks for boxes to go. This pizza was one I devoured and was still hungry after... I ordered the Margherita pizza which came with 6 slices and it was composed of thin bread, heavy crust, a lot of sauce and blocks of cheese ($16). There wasn't really anything too crazy special for me. I loved the fact of how greasy and thin the pizza was, but that's about it. When I was biting into the pizza, the cheese would slip off and I was just basically eating bread and sauce. Perhaps I need to order a different one next time that's more loaded with toppings. But it's a once a month type of pizza because the price is not cheap.\n\nP.S.: It's worth pointing out that they don't carry Ranch... not a huge deal but some people (like me) grew up dipping their pizza in ranch so I was pretty sad about that.", "author": "Joscelynne R."}

Our server did an excellent job making recommendations to tweak the pizzas and red wines to pair with the dish.

As a fan of pizza of all kinds though, this had been on my radar for awhile. We finally got around to coming in this past Saturday for lunch, as it was a perfect day out for pizza and sparkling wine and the restaurant was not insanely busy (surprisingly!)\n\nWe were seated immediately when we got there and munched on free breadsticks that were already at the table when we sat down. It was a hard decision, but we decided on our own pizza each instead of sharing an appetizer and one pizza between us. We chose the Panna for myself (I was intrigued by the addition of cream as a topping) and the Prosciutto for my partner. \n\nBoth pizzas came out at the same time in about 10 minutes (give or take a few minutes). They were steaming hot, requiring us to wait a minute or two for them to cool down just enough so we could dig in without burning our mouths. These were worth the wait though! The sauce was bright and flavourful, the addition of cream added so much richness, and the strips of parmigiana were just enough salt to round out the whole thing (on the Panna pizza). The Prosciutto came out covered in so much arugula, at first we thought it was a salad, but underneath were thin strips of ham, along with delicious fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. We paired our pizzas up with a glass of sparkling wine and a peach bellini (which isn't as sweet as you think it would be). \n\nWe managed to finish off everything without leaving any bits behind. The price was pretty fair considering the location, quality and quantity of the food.

It's simply their pizza with their delicious tomato sauce and any three vegetable toppings (I opted for broccoli rabe, roasted red pepper, and red onion). Outstanding.\n\nOnly one downside:\n\nI do not like that they add a line item charge for their SF healthcare expenses. This is as inappropriate as adding a line on the bill for their taxes, wages, rent, electricity, dishwashing, etc. and I generally do not like to patronize or revisit restaurants that pull this scam.", "author": "Veg V."}

When the pizzas came of course there was no space on the table because of the salad and plates, so she was pushing us to finish the salad. Seriously? Since you made us sit on tiny table we can't enjoy our food and finish whenever we want? Salad is terrible for $15 and pizza was just average.

I'd give this pizza a 3.5, with an extra bump to 4 for the efficiently of their staff and good service.\n\nTonight we had the Salsiccia sausage pizza and the clam pie. I liked the flavor and copious amount of topping on the sausage pizza, while I thought the clam pie was a bit sparce. I wish it would have been more clam-forward. On the flip side, my boyfriend thought the clam pie was light and crispy while the sausage was overly loaded. My second slice of sausage pizza did get a little bit soggy in the middle from the loaded toppings. The crust was a little dry and bland for me, but that could just be because I am comparing it the memories of my last pizza. The pizzas both came out super fast - good if you're hungry, but slightly bad because it got cold faster.\n\nI do appreciate that the staff was very efficient and we got good service from our waiter.

I wasn't planning to be in San Francisco that day, but this and that made us change plans and go there. Eating there still never crossed my mind until someone asked the sales assistant in the Rag and Bone boutique where Pizzeria Delfina was; suddenly my eyes darted in the direction she pointed to, and I saw that bright yellow sign. Ah, it was surely destiny.\n\nWhen we entered at four in the afternoon on our way back from a tour of the Fillmore Street shops, we were led straight to an open table - no waiting. Score! The waitress was super friendly; service throughout our meal was stellar. The saffron arancini were like no other version of that dish I've ever had: They were tiny little... I want to call them \"popcorn arancini.\" The rice had a vivid saffron color and that distinct taste (though not too harsh) with little bits of molten cheese inside. Ah, just delightful, especially with a pitcher of cold Peroni Nastro Azzurro. The Margherita DOP is a version of the venerable Neapolitan standard made with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella di bufala, and other ingredients sourced from Italy. The buffalo mozzarella didn't melt as nicely as I would have liked, but the flavor of the pizza was fantastic. The lasagna di Mezzogiorno was rich and lovely, heavy with cheese and sausage between the layers of spinach pasta, while the \"Sunday supper sauce\" had bits of slow-cooked pork in it. I was crestfallen to hear they had just sold the last butterscotch budino - I haven't had it since a really rude host at Pizzeria Mozza caused me to start boycotting that place nearly a decade ago, so I was really looking forward to it - but the silky, clean buttermilk panna cotta with blood orange and almonds was a wonderful consolation.\n\nI loved the bustling little space that's not overdesigned or uncomfortable (although I concede that, had one not been as fortunate as were we to slide right into a table, one might not be quite as sanguine about the whole experience as were we). Pizzeria Delfina feels just like what a fun, hip city restaurant should be: good food, refined but not too conceptual, in a vibrant-but-relaxed environment.

Located in Lower Pac Heights, this location like the others is always bustling with a line out the door of hungry customers drooling over the wood fire pizza cooking in the back.  My fiance and I arrived a bit earlier than my parents to put our names down on the busy wait list - a pretty simple chalkboard system and the host/cashier at the counter keeps track fairly efficiently seating parties to the best of their ability.  Expect a wait of 30-45 minutes for a party over 2 as the seating in here is pretty limited but you can grab a beer or glass of wine from the counter to sip on while you wait.\n\nWhen our name came up on the list, we were seated in a nice cozy table in the corner and the server greeted us immediately bringing waters and grabbing out bottle of wine to enjoy.  Delfina does cater to vegans with an option of getting a plain pie (no cheese) with a choice of three different toppings ($17).  Between the four of us we shared three pizzas, a vegan special (arugula, olives and mushrooms), a simple margherita ($15), and the broccoli raab ($17.75). Perfect to share between four people. The pizza came out within 30 minutes and was fresh, hot and not overly oily.  The crust was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked and reminded me of the east coast style I am used to from back home. \n\nIn all, a good experience at this location.

I was super hungry when we finally got seated. We ordered the crispy pig ears to start, which were really great! Perfect texture and a nice start. We also ordered three pizzas: the salsiccia and two of the specials they were having that day. The crust were perfectly how I like them. I can't remember the name of the specials, but one of them had a bunch of fresh cherry tomatoes on the taste which were amazingly sweet!

I've been meaning to go to their Pacific Heights' location ever since they opened, but never really had the opportunity. On Tuesday, October 6th, my pizza craving and the roommate's affinity for take out brought me here for dinner. I placed an order online at their website around 5:15pm. It was ready for pick up at 5:45pm when I got to the restaurant.\n\n*Belfiore Burrata ($12): w/arugula, crostini & extra virgin olive oil\n*Neapolitan Meatballs \"In Sugo\" ($16): Pork, beef & veal meatballs w/ tomato sauce & crostini\n*Margherita ($14): Tomato, fior di latte mozzarella, basil\n*Salsiccia ($18): Housemade fennel sausage, tomato, bell peppers, onions, mozzarella; add Arugula (+$3)\n\nI adore thin crust pizza. Especially if it has a nice chew. Luckily, that's what you'll find here. I loved that they packed the arugula separately so it stayed nice and fresh. Went well with the Salsiccia. Their Margherita was good as well, but I wish it had more basil. Since we got take out, the crust in the middle of the pizzas suffered a bit and were soggy. The toppings kept sliding off. Still, they were some of the better pizzas I've had. The Burrata was amazing! Rich, buttery and creamy! I ate the whole portion myself! The Meatballs were a touch dry, but I loved the sauce. Yum!\n\nOne of my favorite thin crust pizza places close to home. Pizzas do suffer a little from take out, so I'd suggest eating the pies there! Next time, I know I will!", "author": "Elena N."}

I was worried about coming here particularly because I think pizza can be overhyped (see my Seniores Pizza review). This is not the case with Pizzeria Delfina.\n\nWAIT TIME: The place was packed on a Monday afternoon at 1:00pm. However, the servers are hustling and the turn around time is fast. We opted for inside seating and if you want to get seated quickly, I'd pick the bar seating. Our wait was probably 5 minutes max. \n\nFOOD: OMGGGGZZZZZ Food is insanely good here. It may have been because they served dishes I like - Either way I thought their 'Cold Tripe' starter ($9) and their Funghi Pizza (~$19.50) was one of the best dishes I've had at an Italian restaurant. The Cold Tripe is not for the light hearted if you're not into weird foods. The taste is light with the right amount of salt, citrus, oil, and chili. They make it super interactive by allowing you to mix your desired portion of salt, oil, and lemon into the dish. I thought it was genius. the Funghi Pizza is one of their seasonal pizzas with hen of the woods mushrooms. I love mushroom pizza and really appreciated they did not just go with run of the mill crimini mushrooms. The flavors were on point and the crust was thin, light, and hot (temperature). I couldn't have asked for a better meal.\n\nSERVICE: Excellent. The place was packed but our waters were refilled and the waiters/waitresses were excellent at checking in. We felt very welcomed there.\n\nOVERALL: Go on off times (early evening, late lunch, weekdays). Order the cold tripe and funghi pizza. DO IT. I'm still dreaming about it.", "author": "Nicole J."}

The two of us shared a panna pizza - tomato sauce, cream, basil, cheese ($14) and it was enough food since we weren't too hungry. Its one of my favorites on their menu.

The pizza deities were watching over me.\n\nTricolore salad: A dish of arugula (green), radicchio (purple red), and endive (yellow). A lemony dressing was pre-mixed into the salad, which went well with the peppery arugula and slightly bitter radicchio and endive. The leaves were in their prime and gave a crunch with each bite. The salad was topped with rectangular slices of grana padano, an Italian cheese with a flavor similar to that of parmesan. I appreciated the simplicity of the tricolore, but felt that it could have done with even less of the dressing.\n\nSalsiccia pizza: This pie had a thin base upon which the ingredients were built. The crust was charred and slightly puffed. The tomato sauce easily fell off of the pizza and onto our hands as it was topped with but a few melted bits of mozzarella cheese. Taken together, the thin base, charred crust, and tomato to cheese ratio kept this pizza refreshing bite after bite. Atop the cheese were thinly sliced red and yellow bell peppers that gave the pizza a both savory and sweet addition. The ground sausage was kept moist by the underlying tomato sauce and packed some mild heat.\n\nIt gets very busy in the restaurant, so you may need to flag your server down if you should need anything.", "author": "Cici T."}

Why but why did he keep taking about italian cuisine and imply that the recipe is italian...why pepper your demonstration with italian this...italian that.  The recipe may be your recipe..call it californian, call it what you want, but please don't call it italian.  He literally drawned the grilled asparagus in butter and garlic.  The authentic recipe which is a northern recipe does not include butter.  In fact, italians do not drawn ANYTHING in butter or garlic.  Garlic is only used in southern cooking. The lemon is added at the end \"al freddo\" after you take the asparagus off the grill.  \n\nWhy is every chef in California compelled to brand anything and everything as italian?  First he talked about how the \"gas\" ovens try to imitate the wood oven in Italy..and then went on to say how they are better.  Why compare? Who are you trying to convince?\n\n I think that my biggest frustration is that he was trying to \n\"educate\".  Please do not educate people do don't know any better what is authentic or italian and what is not.  And Tuscany is not in northern Italy, it is in central Italy.  Northern italian cuisine does not include garlic and there is no such thing in authentic italian cuisine as a recipe that includes ground up garlic.  When garlic is used in Italy, they smash it, add it to the sauce, or oil and then they promptly remove it.  So your garlic information under the \"italian education for cooking\" was also wrong.\nWhy can't you guys call what you do Californian.  Own it as your own.  Do NOT sell it as Italian because it is NOT.

Thin crust was nice, red sauce mediocre, 1 1/2 pieces of arugula woohoo! There was a good amount of prosciutto though but come on put some arugula on the damn pizza people. Two stars are fair and it was pricey for a medium size pizza. Try somewhere else.", "author": "Gary E."}

I think it would have been even better if I had added sausage. But overall a pretty tasty pie.\n\nClam pie: 3/5: I read rave reviews about this pie. First bite it kinda surprised me by how clammy it was. The sauce and the clams had an overwhelming clamminess that I didn't really like. Don't get me wrong, I love clams but I wasn't the biggest fan of this clam pizza. Would not get it again.\n\nOverall a decent pizza place.

Not joking! \n\nA small, family oriented, homey, and welcoming restaurant with big flavors! We visited the restaurant today for lunch, and when we arrived around noon, it wasn't too busy which was very nice! We ordered a number of places to share: the Citrus & Walnuts Salad, the mussels, meatballs, the Panna Pizza with sausage and the Salsiccia Pizza. All ingredients were very fresh and flavorful. Everything was amazing! I honestly have no complaints about any part of our visit to this fine establishment! The only thing I will say is that it is slightly more on the expensive side, but I believe this just comes with the territory. The customer service was friendly, warm, inviting, and prompt.

She also mentioned that they didn't have the artichokes, which we didn't want anyway. But, I thought it was good that we were informed. \n\nWe decided on the \"Clam Pie: cherrystones, tomato, oregano, pecorino, hot peppers\" and the \"Funghi: Hen o' the woods mushrooms, panna, fontina, nepitella.\" Our pizzas came out in about 20 mins...\n\nThe clam pie was alright. It wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. At first bite, you don't really taste the heat from the hot peppers, but it does creep up on you slightly. I prefer the clam and garlic from Golden Boy because the garlic adds so much flavor. \n\nI had a slice of the mushroom pie and I liked it a lot better than the clam. The mushrooms were tasty and the fontina was nice and gooey. The crust wasn't overcooked. \n\nOverall, I had a good first-time experience here and don't feel the need to try their other locations.

I was part of a party of 9, so we waited about an hour for a table. The food was delicious and didn't weigh you down like other pizzas do. I didn't feel lethargic after eating it or feel the need to take a nap. The service was good and pretty fast, especially for how busy it was. It is reallllllllly tight in there but not as bad as other places in the area. \n\nFOOD: 5 stars.\nFor 9 of us we ordered 5 salads to start and then 8 pizzas. We probably ordered way too much food, but after a day of traveling and waiting an hour for a table, it was perfect. The Margherita pizza with arugula on top was delicious. Thin crust and everything tasted very fresh. We also ordered the Prosciutto pizza with arugula and prosciutto on top and that was also excellent. I think we ordered each of the 3 salads they had on be menu and each of those were delicious. A little heavy on the salad dressing, but I'm someone who doesn't like dressing on my salad haha. \n\nSERVICE: 4 stars.\nKind of slow, but expected with how busy it was. They were all very friendly and down to Earth. \n\nLOCATION: 4.5 stars.\nThe space is very tight but it works. It's right next to Smitten's, so it definitely attracts a lot of people. I would recommend getting here early because we waited a loooonnngggg time when we arrived 20 minutes after they opened. \n\nI'm not a big fan of pizza and having lived in NY, I feel like I am a very tough critic. This pizza was well-crafted and not too heavy. The toppings were very different and unique so I feel like it is very customized to this place. I would recommend making it a point to come here if you're in SF and looking for amazing pizza!", "author": "Zoe Y."}

It wasn't busy. \n\nSo, I walked in to this place because apparently this pizza place serves one of the best pizzas in town, so I decided to give it a try. I ultimately was here just to try out Smitten Ice Cream, and I was so pleased, I was wanting to hit the next best spot down the block, which was Delfina Pizzeria! \n\nWalked right in. Ordered a Salsicchia to go, since I was stuffed with ice cream already, and headed out to walk on Fillmore and window shop, since the pizza would be ready in 20 minutes. Came back. Waited in total, about 30 minutes. Pizza was done, smelled great, looked amazing, and headed back to my car. \n\nMy boyfriend and I had to get a taste before we drove off bc the car was filled with this amazing aroma of tomato and sausage, bell peppers and more, so we dug in for a slice. Thank GOD all my toppings fell off because, low and behold, THERE WAS A SMALL CURLY HAIR UNDERNEATH THE TOPPINGS!!!! I almost hacked and threw the pizza back into the box. My boyfriend ran back in and told them about it, with the hair still there, and they just said, oh sorry about that. You'll have to wait another 20 minutes for another one. REALLY?! I was so upset. They couldn't even offer to give it for free or offer some sort of courtesy discount or even a free dessert to make up for that? To make matters worse, the replacement pizza had a lot less meat on it. So I get less of a pizza for the same price and had to wait even longer for this 2nd pizza? Wow. \n\nWhenever I find hair in my food, especially on a 1st visit, and there was no remorse for it, that is unacceptable. Sorry Delfina. You just lost a possible repeat customer. But I will come back to the neighboring ice cream spot! Smitten gets an A+!", "author": "Leah G."}

A few of my friends said Pizzeria Delfina is the best pizza place ever and a lot of the reviews on here say the same thing. I had very high expectations for Pizzeria Delfina. \n\nAtmosphere/Decor:\n\nThe restaurant is very small and cluttered. Everything is way too close to one another. You fill totally boxed in. I didn't like the set up of the restaurant. When you enter the restaurant you'll see a chalk board on the left which is basically the menu and the waiting list. I waited in line for about 10 minutes before one of the employees told me I had to write my name on the chalk board. I didn't like the chalk board waiting list concept at all. I saw a lot of people that were unaware of writing their name down on the chalk board.  \n\nFood:\n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered our own pizzas. I went with the Salsiccia (house made fennel sausage, tomato, bell peppers, onions, mozzarella). The Salsiccia pizza was mediocre at best. There was nothing spectacular about it. It barely had any mozzarella cheese on it. The bell peppers weren't even cooked. They still had a hard texture and tasted like a raw vegetable. The only good tasting thing was the house made fennel sausage. Everything else was pretty weak.\n\nMy girlfriend felt the same way about her Margherita Pizza. She didn't really like it. The dough was really soggy and the tomato sauce tasted kind of weird. We weren't a fan of the pizza crust as well because it was so burnt.\n\nService:\n\nI thought the service was pretty bad from start to finish. Like I said previously when we got there I had to wait in line for about 10 minutes until an employee told me I had to write my name up on the chalk board in order to be seated. It seemed like everyone working there was too busy to acknowledge people waiting in line. I thought our waitress did an okay job. She took our order and that was really it. We didn't see her or hear from her until she dropped off the check. She didn't even check up on us throughout our dinner or ask if we liked the pizzas. \n\nOverall:\n\nI don't understand how people on here can say that the pizza crust and ingredients at Pizzeria Delfina are the best they've ever had. They must not know what really good pizza tastes like. Tony's on Stockton Street is way better and blows Pizza Delfina out of the water. Don't waste your time at this place. Hit up Tony's instead. The wait is actually worth it there.", "author": "David R."}

It was very watery and greasy from the sauce (although the sauce was good) and the excessive amount of guanciale they put on top. It was my bad for ordering their guanciale special, but I also just didn't expect it to have giant chunks all over the pizza. The mozzarella was also not very good. Aaaaand the pizza also could have used another minute in the oven, although it still burned the roof of my mouth! My sweet server warned me, but it still did it! No food for me today as it's still singed off. $27 for a personal pizza after tax and tip. No thank you!", "author": "Jen B."}

I was craving pizza and Pizzeria Delfina came to mind.  What?!  They have one on Californa street?  Sweet, we're going.  \n\nWalked in, scribbled my name on the chalkboard, and waited for about 20 minutes.  We were seated inside, thank God.  As lovely as it was outside, I'd rather enjoy a nice meal indoors.  Ordered the classic margherita pizza and the argula and prosciutto pizza.  Complimentary bread sticks kept us busy while waiting for our pizza.\n\nMargherita-  Now I know why this is a classic.  Tomato, mozzarella, and basil.  The simplicty of this pizza reminds me of comfort food.  \n\nProsciutto Pie-  Of course we had to get one pizza with meat- I'm not really a fan of sausage so prosciutto it is!  Wow.  That's all I could say.  If you hate veggies, your first impression might be \" Wow, that's a lot of arugula.  But after the first bite, it all makes sense.  The arugula and mozzarella helps balance out the saltiness from the prosciutto.  \n\nRoot Beer Float-  I'm not a fan of soda, but if you're gonna go all out on the food, you might as well go all out on the beverage as well.  \n\nEach pizza includes 6 slices.  Between 2 people, you could easily finish 9 slices.  These pizzas were thin, not on the heavy side, and the freshness of the ingredients really brought out all the flavors of each component.  It's a little on the pricey side- $50 including tip but it was worth it.  Excellent service btw.", "author": "Linda N."}

If you're looking for a thick doughy crust, wrong place. It's nice crispy, airy, and light. Their sauce is very flavorful and I like that they use freshly grated/sliced cheese. Not the typical shredded cheese at your typical pizza place. They have a good variety of pizzas, not too overwhelming, perfect for me cause they all sound so good and I can never choose. Of course you can always add additional toppings/create your own pie. We got the Margherita, which you can never go wrong with and the Prosciutto Pie, very good too. The prosciutto added a perfect amount of saltiness to the pizza and the arugula added some texture to it too. It all came together perfectly.\n\nThey also give these super addicting breadsticks too.

Though the meatballs were so tempting; I had a feeling we'd be so full because they were huge and filling, so we went with the squash arancini ($10) for our appetizer and the Prosciutto pie ($17) for our main.  The squash arancini came out quickly and were perfectly golden brown.  You can't go wrong with cheese and fried balls, right?  I love squash, but the cheese did overpower the squash.  Onto the Proscuitto Pie next!  Lots of fresh arugula, yummy pieces of well balanced proscuitto,  with three cheeses: caciocavallo, mozzarella, panna.  It was a white pie.  Slightly burned in the crust, but nowhere else.   The crust is thicker here than most similar pizzas.  It was an excellent pizza though more porscuitto would have been an added bonus since we are pork  lovers.  I can see why it's their most popular pizza.  \n\nWe enjoyed the service from our waiter and the gentleman that brought us our food.

The hostess or manager or whoever she was is extremely rude and tried to push us out of our seats after 1hr 15 min - coming back to our table (oops I mean bar seats) when we hadn't put our cards out yet and clearing away the salt and pepper shakers and the bread sticks (yes honey your point taken, we won't elongate our stay by eating a breadstick or sprinkling salt and pepper on your bar). If you spend $100 on pizza can't you let your clientele stay more than 1 hr 15 min so a glass of wine can be finished? Absurd.

Arrived and found street parking right in front of the pizzeria, which is rare for the area because parking around here sucks. We walk in and ask for a table for 2 people and they say they have seats at the bar, so we decide to sit there. They have breadsticks for everyone to grab and enjoy while perusing the menu which were tasty little bites. \n\nI ended up ordering a beer from the menu, we got a margarita pizza and one with fennel sausage. My beer came out and apparently the beer was one that came with sort of a champagne top and the guy opened it and it was literally all foam. When I poured it into my glass it pretty much exploded all over the table because of an air pocket or something from when the guy opened my beer. I was not happy with that. Then when the bill comes it's a fricken $16 beer! What gives? That was ridiculous. That's the only reason they are demoted from 5 stars. \n\nThe pizza came out and it's on thin crust and it was warm and delicious looking. Took a bite of the margarita pizza and the fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce on that cracker thin crust was amazing. So tasty and the ingredients were all high quality. Same with the fennel sausage pizza, the crust was just heavy duty enough to hold up to the ingredients on top but also wasn't to the point of being a cracker that messes up the roof of your mouth. I appreciated that. We came to get the margarita pizza because 7x7 said it was on the top 100 things to eat and it was pretty tasty.\n\nWe ended our meal with two scoops of gelato, one scoop vanilla and one scoop of cardamon plum. Gelato is made in house and it was creamy and had great flavor. The cardamon left a pleasant aftertaste in my mouth that was a great way to end the meal. I would love to come back again and try their clam pizza. Will not be getting a fricken $16 beer, that cost more than one of my pizzas!", "author": "Jeromy G."}

I didn't care too much about it before but this last experience made me certain that I will never go back to Delphina's.\n\n1/ the staff was rude to me and my friend from out of town. They barely looked at us when we came in and it was not that busy. When I decided to go to one of the girls and ask for a table (since there was one available right in front of us), she snapped at me that I had to go write it on the empty board with no names on it... I complied and waited. \nAfter maybe 5 other minutes of nobody looking at us, one of the hosts(/waitress?) looked up and asked if we had been helped. I told her that we hadn't and that we were 2 for lunch. She wanted to sit us at the bar but since it was pretty empty I asked if we could get the table instead. \nIrritated she answered \"sure! Let me prep it!\"\nThe table was already cleaned but apparently putting some silverware on top of it can be pretty annoying.\nSo we finally seated and then service became normal again. \n\n2/ the food was nothing but mediocre. We ordered fried okra that tasted more like oil than anything else and the prosciutto pizza which really wasn't tasty. The crust was thin and good but the toppings were bland and didn't make for a good pizza. \n\n3/ it is way overpriced for pizza. One pizza and one appetizer with no drinks should not cost over $40 I'm sorry. \n\nDelphina is a typical place suffering the SF fame fever. Arrivederci NOT!", "author": "Cemeldosce M."}

Initially, we were going to be seated inside the restaurant which is part of the same establishment... but our goal was PIZZA and then main portion of the restaurant doesn't offer any pizza. Hence, why we ended up at Pizzeria Delfina. No regrets!\n\nFirst, we started off with the meatballs.The presentation was very rustic, served to us in an iron type mini skillet with slices of bread to accompany it. It was delightfully juicy and incredibly tasty. There was so much flavor in that thing, I could have shamelessly licked the skillet. Next came the pizzas.. We ordered the MARGHERITA pizza. The ingredients are so obviously fresh that its mouthwatering. They're able to extract every last inch of sweetness from whatever lovely tomatoes they use in to the sauce and onto that piece of pizza. It's magical... and on top of that the fresh mozzarella just melts. Our second pizza was the SALSICCIA, and we didn't think it would get better but it did. Doesn't it always get better with meat? :) The sausage was perfect.. a bit spicy, a bit sweet, but overall very savory. We ended the night with the cannolis which came with a slight lemon zest and sprinkled pistachios. Very decadent, but not too sweet. The cappuccinos were amazing as well!! SUCH an amazing way to end the meal! \n\nI absolutely want to come here again just to pretty much order the entire menu.", "author": "Mariko M."}

Golden.\n\nStarted off with a Margherita Pizza ($13.00), which was excellent by traditional-Margherita-standards but, because I love ooey-gooey cheese, this was slightly disappointing in the drippy & stringy cheese department. The pizzas are big enough to share, even though I'm sure they would love you to buy one per person (the server acted hesitant when I asked if they were big enough for two).\n\nFor dessert, I had the Amarena Cherry Sundae ($7.50), which was definitely the highlight of the meal. It came with 2-3 scoops of delicious vanilla gelato and was topped with halved cherries, pistachios and whipped cream. They give you a side of chocolate sauce and, by the end of it, I was eating the chocolate straight-up with a spoon. Yeah, I'm not proud. But it's that good.\n\nThe atmosphere is perfect. The restaurant is bright and airy, which is definitely a fresh and modern take on your typical Italian establishment.\n\nI would have appreciated a little more service. My table, which was comprised of all girls, was definitely not given as much attention as the table right next to us that was comprised of all guys. We had a female-server who enjoyed joking and flirting with the male-table, but never really paid attention to my table. Oh, well.

While the food was still good, I was really surprised at the sass my friends and I received from the staff. Most of it was sort of \"you had to be there\" moments because their tone/eye rolling was painful, so keep that image in your mind. First, we walked in and my friends were finishing up ice cream (like... one bite left) and the person at the counter says we aren't allowed to sit because they have food. So they finish their food in about 5 seconds, and we are instructed to put our name on the list (just for context, it's about 4pm saturday and about half the restaurant is empty, AND the outside heated area is deserted). We are told it would be about a 20 min wait, which I'm confused by. I ask if I can just place an order to go, which I do. I tip like I would for any normal sit down order. \n\nWhen the pizza is ready, after a bit of back and forth, I ask if it's ok to sit on the heated patio because it was about to rain and was very chilly, so we didn't want to sit in the \"public\" area. In the waitresses words: \"ohh.... no, sorry, those are reserved for people who, like... TIP.\" \n\nEh? You saw my receipt, you saw I tipped... if it's because you want to keep it open for people dining in (even though people were avoiding the patio because it was FREEZING outside) then fine, but why phrase it that way?\n\nAll in all, the snark and condescension from the entire staff was really shocking because I only have had great experiences here.

I moved from SF a few  years ago but my husband and I were recently back and decided to make a stop at Delfina.  It continues to impress me!\n\nWe started with the burrata, served with crostini and arugula.  The crostini was pretty oily but, other than that, it was a delicious starter.  We used to always get the marinated olives that never disappointed.  It doesn't sound that inventive but they are marinated in orange rind that imparts the most amazing flavors.  \n\nWe followed with the broccoli raab pizza.  The pizza was, as always, perfect.  The crust is thin, fluffy and crispy all at once - very Naples like.  There isn't really any sauce on the pizza but the broccoli raab is flavorful enough that it would take over any sauce that was there.

We ordered two pizzas - one with speck and the other with broccali rabe - neither of which you could actually see sauce on.  Both pizzas were rather underwhelming in flavor, and the speck one had speck lazily tossed on top (which made eating it difficult).  We considered getting an appetizer, but the menu was really small and not that inspiring.  Some people say this pizza is as close to pizza in Italy as you can get in SF, or even the States.  I'm not sure where the hell they ate in Italy, because that couldn't be further from the truth.  I say this as someone who has lived in Italy twice, and visits fairly frequently.\n\nAs for service, we called ahead to check the wait, and were told it was half an hour if we just showed up.  So we took the five minutes to get there, and ended up waiting for almost an hour and a half to get seated.  Once we did, we were seated outside, where people who were still waiting for a table kept crowding ours.  The waitress didn't show up to give us menus or take our order for another half hour.

Luckily, this pizzeria was up the street from our hotel in the Fillmore district. We were able to be seated immediately at the bar and set to ordering. \n\nWhile waiting for the pizza, which was only a few moments, we were able to get a great view of fresh mozzarella being pulled and formed into perfect balls at the counter. We struck up a conversation with the mozz-er and turns out he was from Philly originally! We bonded over east coast memories, he recommended some places to go, and even gave us some gratis mozzarella. The mozzarella was chewy with a great texture and fresh, clean flavor. Eating it plain allowed us to enjoy it even more when it arrived on our pie shortly after. \n\nThe pizza had interesting bubbles formed around the edges. They were charred so much that they disintegrated when you touched them, but they didn't hold the bitter taste that burnt pizza dough usually has. \n\nWhile the delectable ingredients piled on the Salsiccia lent moisture to the dough, it wasn't soupy in the center as other Neopolitan pies we've tried have been. The dough held its own and supported the toppings, but easily tore and had a great chew to it. My favorite thing on the pizza were the peppers, which had a great hot sweetness to them. \n\nThe decor is nice and airy. They have plates of oregano (dried there), chili flakes, and cheese at the table and the layout is open.

Delfina is the BEST pizza in town and if I ever leave San Francisco, it'll be one of the top things I miss. \n\nSo yes, the restaurant is almost always packed but if you can muster the courage to wait, it's worth it. My favorite pizza is the Panna w/ sausage. The tomato sauce is perfectly creamy and savory and the fennel sausage really gives it the kick of flavor it needs to make it a complete pizza. Imagine your favorite sausage pizza-- well THIS IS TEN TIMES BETTER. Their pizza is thin but not cracker thin which is an important detail to note. It's crunchy where it needs to be but still soft in all the right places. It's the type of pizza that turns you into a loyal customer and the type that refers friends in town to Delfina when they ask for recommendations. \n\nDon't leave w/o trying the sorbet trio.

We live up the street so we decided to walk on over with the hopes of being seated rather quickly. We show up, put our name on the board, sit on a chair on the sidewalk, and wait. It wasn't until an hour later we finally got seated (outside) and then another 15 minutes before we ordered our food. We finally ordered the broccoli rabe pizza along with the speciality speck pizza. \n\nThe food was dry. I mean, desert thirsty for some sauce and some flavor. The broccoli rabe pizza had nothing other than the pungent sting of rabe. The speck pizza was lazily tossed together with an overwhelming amount of garlic and the most bland mozzarella I've ever tasted. What more, the speck was just tossed on top. Cool, a long slab of speck slaps my chin with the first bite of each slice until I rip it off and have none left to enjoy. \n\nThe atmosphere is a bit much. Almost every party there was enjoying a bottle of wine to themselves and having a grand time; I don't have a problem with that. What I have problems with are people were shouting, slurring, stumbling, and being straight up obnoxious while I'm trying to enjoy my meal. What more? The music was booming and I couldn't hear my dinner companion from across the table. I felt like I was at a frat party (only there were no hot men, just gaggles of women). \n\nI was astonished that people could eat this pizza and rave about it so freely. People compare this pizza to the pies they've eaten in Italy; I'm not sure what part of Italy they've been to, but I can tell you the pizza there is infinitely more flavorful and delicious than this.   \n\nI could go on about the lack of menu items but instead I'll end my rant here. I would honestly love if people took a step back next time they visit Pizzeria Delfina and really think \"is what I'm eating great pizza?\".

Could use some more herbs. The dried oregano we got on the table was an amazing addition to every bite of the pizzas we got.\n\n* Margherita (Tomato, fior di latte mozzarella, basil) - very good.. like I said above, the crust could be better but the sauce is great. Not quite enough basil. I would also say the cheese squares they add are a little too thick and not very fresh, as when you take a bite from the middle of them they stretch out way wayyy too much. They should be much more fresh and melted and break off more easily.\n\n* Broccoli Raab (Star Route Farms broccoli raab, caciocavallo, mozzarella, olives, hot peppers) - we were forewarned that this was going to be bitter, but in a good way. We got mushrooms as an extra topping which went really well. And we'd ordered extra sauce on the side which really enhanced the flavor in my opinion. \n\n* Meatballs - wow. For me, this was the star of the meal. The meatballs were so succulent and soft, slightly pink in the middle, piping hot, juicy. And my complaints about the pizza sauce - it's like they made ALL those improvements in the meatball sauce.

Neither one of us can ever say no to pizza, especially when it comes from Pizzeria Delfina.  We've had a number of dates here, so when it came time to leave Pac Heights and start our new life in a new neighborhood, we felt that it was necessary to have our last dinner here.  The wait wasn't very long, although being that it was a Sunday, there was still about a 20 minute wait for a table inside.  Feeling a little adventurous, we ordered the special appetizer of the night: Baked Lumachine with Sunday Supper Sauce.  The dish was basically a rendition of Mac n Cheese and it was oh so delicious!  Seeing the bubbly cheese in the red sauce made those calories worth every bite.  We've also had the meatballs in the past, but this definitely takes the cake on best appetizer!  For our pizza, we ordered the Margherita and added the Fennel Sausage and Fra'Mani Salami Piccante.   Both Greg and I like our pizza pretty straightforward so while I wanted to try the Carbonara, this was a safe bet for him.  We also had a bottle of the Piedirosso La Sibilla Campania to go with dinner.  I want to take off 1/2 a star for the service we had when the wine came; someone just dropped it off on the table without allowing us to try it.  It was a good (and reasonably priced) bottle, but that seemed a little rude.  Our waitress was really nice, and while she wasn't all that knowledgeable on the type of wine we should have with our meal, she was really attentive and made sure we had everything.

Don't get me started on the crust.  Both crispy and chewy, as you've probably heard.\n\nI was disappointed to come out on a Tuesday to find the restaurant closed, so be sure you don't make the same mistake I did.  If it's your first time coming in, be sure to put your name on the board.  If it gets really busy, there's a possibility the host might miss you.\n\nA total plus that these guys take phone orders.  Although the pizza is best when served fresh, you can easily throw it in your oven to reheat.\n\nI'll definitely be back...if not to eat in, definitely to go!\n\nBuon appetito!", "author": "Anna V."}

The taste is amazing and I didn't even mind eating the crust!\n\nWe had to order  3 pizzas (napoletana, clam pie, salsiccia)   but the clam pie was definitely my favorite!

Don't get me wrong, I loved all three pizzas but my fave is still the clam pie. \n\nThe affettati was good. I wish I had more. The meatballs in sugo? Oh man. I was hoping they were some huge meatballs because they were $13 but they're small and you only get 5 of them. HOWEVER. They are the best, tenderest, juiciest most flavorful meatballs I have ever had in my whole entire life. GOOD BALLS. MMMHMMM go for it.\n\np.s. It gets really busy and crowded here.

The wait was just ridiculous.  We were about the 5th party waiting, and we had a party of the three, something they're probably not use to.  Seems like you either have a party of two, or a party of 4+.  Now I understand that they want to serve all their customers, but if someone is called and they are not there, just cross them off, and move on.  People who have actually waited the entire time should be seated in a timely manner.  \n\nAnother thing that just ticked me off was the fact that they smashed three people onto a table made for two.  Now I get that this place is small and they try to save the booths for bigger parties, but shoving three people on a table the size of a desk is just bad customer service.\n\nNow, the food, probably the only thing that saved them from a 1-star.  Had the roasted corn with lardo butter, absolutely amazing.  The butter was so creamy and rich, and the corn was so sweet.  If only Hawaii had good tasting corn the way the mainland does.  If I ever do come back that is the only thing I will be getting.  Next, I ordered the margarita pizza.  Maybe it was just me, but I thought the sauce to be very watery, and the cheese and toppings just fell off onto my plate.  A bummer there.

We started with the Roasted Mariquita Farms Carrots, with cumin, ricotta, and wildflower honey. They were sweet and savory and cooked well. Next was the Neapolitan Meatballs in Sugo (red wine tomato sauce). The meatballs were flavorful and tender, and it's a generous serving (three sizeable meatballs served with two slices of crusty toasted bread). There were three of us, and I'm not sure we even finished them. For our pizzas, we went with the Salsiccia (housemade fennel sausage, tomato, red bell peppers, red onion, and mozzarella), and, at the server's suggestion, one of the specials, which had house-cured lardo, cippolini onion, tomato, arugula, and black pepper. The Salsiccia is a perennial favorite. It's hearty and flavorful, and the sausage is amazing. The special was surprisingly bland. How is something with cured pig fat bland, you ask? Beats me.

Don't bother asking anyone to turn it down. In a nutshell - might not be ideal for a first date. \n\nStart with the Insalata Tricolore ($8.50) - it doesn't sound very exciting but the taste is dynamite. One pizza can easily be shared between two people, and if there are even more of you I recommend getting a bunch of different ones to split. As a vegetarian I have sampled the 4 Formaggi, Margherita and Panna, which are all sort of similar and range in price from $10-15.

We lucked out and found street parking around the block from the restaurant. There was a line out the door and I knew it would be quite a wait.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty small, especially since it has a huge following, but I guess that just adds to its popularity. Walking in, there's a giant chalk board that lists the menu and the day's specials. It's also where you write your own name on the waiting list. To the right there's a few chairs to grab a seat and you can even order a drink (beer/wine) while you're waiting. There's seating at tables and seating at the bar overlooking the kitchen. There's also a couple outdoor tables, which aside from being cold during the middle of winter, it can also be awkward because of all the people waiting for a table only 2 feet away from you. \n\nWe ended up waiting about 45-60 minutes to finally get seated. The waitress was nice about it and assured us we would be seated as she write \"CLOSED\" underneath the wait list.\n\nSince we were anxious to eat,we sat at the first place that opened up -- the bar. Right as we sat down, one of the cooks in the back was throwing a fit and arguing with a waitress... AWKWARD. At the bar, they had breadsticks and a plate of seasonings for our pizzas (hot peppers, cheese, and oregano?). I got the Salsiccia, as did one of my other roommates, and the other roommate got the Prosciutto Pie. Our pizzas came out about 10 minutes later and were perfectly cooked. The flavor combinations were quite tasty and I loved the thin crust. I even ate the ends because the dough was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, without it being too much. My roomies split their pies half an half and said the Salsiccia was better than the Proscuitto. \n\nFor about $15+ per pie, it's pretty pricey, but the neighborhood is nice and trendy, so it should be expected. The clientele is the young, well-dressed, and successful 20-30 year old crowd, but there are some hipsters. I mostly saw couples or small groups of people.

With his help, we settled on the brussels sprouts as an appetizer and a special vegetable pie, with 2 farm eggs on top along with a garlic and anchovy aioli. There are few places I would even consider having a pizza with eggs on top, but it definitely was the best choice - an unusual textural combination bursting with flavor, laying a top a perfectly fired pizza. The brussels sprouts had some lime and chili in it, as well as some arugula and a lemon vinaigrette and altogether formed a just right combination of heat and flavor. Pizzeria Delfina obviously pays attention to the measurements for their concoctions because they were all perfectly balanced.\n\nFinishing off the meal with homemade mint chip and coconut gelato were the cherry on the sundae. This is California pizza at its best - creative, local and fresh and full of flavor.

We came at peak lunch time and waited for about 30 minutes to be seated. It was packed!\n\nThere were a few incidents with our service at the beginning of our meal that rubbed me the wrong way but I just brushed it off to them being quite busy and needing to serve a packed room. However, towards the end of our meal when the restaurant had mostly cleared out, we still were not attended to and the servers were downright rude.  2 stars for service.....and that may be a bit generous.\n\nAs for the food....it lived up to all of the hype. The bf and I shared the Insalata Tricolore and their Salsiccia pizza. And although I ordered the Insalata Tricolore thinking it was something else, I enjoyed the light salad with endives and arugula.  However, it was the Salsiccia that was the show stopper---and to me, it was all about the crust! Thin but slightly chewy in the inside and crisp on the outside. Granted, I have never been fortunate enough to visit Italy but I can only imagine that this is what authentic pizza tastes like. Delish! 4.5 stars for food. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wPJjpOZ0mnsajJLBkWUnwA?select=JxuDiXnWMRWCWiFmPbZm-g\n\nOverall, I give Pizzeria Delfina 3.5 stars. It's unfortunate that the service really took down my overall rating because the food was stellar. Perhaps I'll go back again to see if my experience was just an anomaly since other Yelpers seemed to have had a different quality of service that we received.", "author": "Nam N."}

But for now, I will review based on my short to-go experience.  \n\nSeeing Pizzeria Delfina on the 7x7 Big Eat, and not really wanting to cook on a Sunday night, my boyfriend and I called in an order for a margherita pizza around 6:00 p.m.  The restaurant said it'd be about 25 minutes, so we got in the car and headed over.  We quickly found free street parking about a block away and when we walked into the restaurant, the pizza had just been boxed.  The single pizza came up at just over $15 and the cashier was very friendly.  He gave us cheese, peppers, and some herb/garnish to put on our pizza.  We asked if they had any paper plates, they didn't, but the cashier offered us some flat to-go boxes to use as plates.  \n\nAs for the pizza, it's pretty much as good as I imagine a margherita pizza can be.  The tomato sauce is very fresh tasting (not overly heavy at all) and the mozzarella was great.  There are a few basil leaves and overall, the ingredients were perfectly complimentary.  The crust was also very good.  My boyfriend and I were impressed that it was thin crust, but still had a nice chewiness to it and was quite substantial.  The edge/upper crust area had a nice cooked, wood-fired look to it and the crust had a nice flavor overall.\n\nI'll be back soon to dine-in.\n\nNotes:\n-The have some temporary tattoos by the cash register.  I grabbed a couple, just because. \n-The area is pretty busy, but on a Sunday evening, parking was very manageable.", "author": "Samantha L."}

I walked in as a single and spoke to the first person that greeted me. I asked if I would be able to order and finish my pizza in 45 minutes since I had a doctor appointment nearby. She said yes and I then asked where I could sit. I mistakenly thought she said anywhere including the booth since there were plenty of other tables or the counter. I placed my coat and umbrella in a booth and went to the restroom. When I returned another woman evidently the hostess said I couldn't sit in the booth which was meant for a larger party. Which makes sense and totally understand. I mentioned to her I thought the person who I spoke with (evidently a waitress) said  I could sit anywhere but I was fine in moving. What got me upset as she was walking away she muttered that the waitress never told me that.  Basically calling me a liar. I know she hadn't asked the waitress. I summoned the waitress and asked if I misheard her. She was courteous and said she didn't offer the booth and was just miscommunication. I told her even though I was in the wrong the hostess didn't need to have a condescending attitude and should learn some customer service skills and tact. I have been to this particular location many times and have always enjoyed their pizza and service.  She said she will mention my feelings to the hostess. Other than that the waitress who did serve me provided excellent service and the pizza was great as usual and served quickly. It's a shame that the first person a customer usually see first is the hostess and that greeting can help or ruin the entire dining experience.

I personally liked the prosciutto pie a little more because it didn't have tomato sauce and I love arugula and prosciutto, but the margherita was also really good. I recommend both! I love how their crust is thin, but still soft at the same time. It seemed like a lot of food, but we actually probably could have finished it all in one sitting if we didn't stop ourselves.

Well, I got the chance to do that today and although their pizza isn't bad, it certainly doesn't live up to the hype. I've had better pizza at Pizza My Heart for less. They only have one size that you can order here. It's about the size of a large plate. The crust is thin and chewy but the pizza isn't as savory as I expected it to be. I was expecting more fennel in the sausage. I didn't taste it at all. I got the salsiccia pizza for $16.75 plus an extra $6.00 added on to that just for adding speck (smoked prosciutto) on there. I wasn't aware of how much that cost until I saw the bill and one of the employees there pointed that out to me. Wow, even if it was imported, charging $6.00 just to add a few slices of fancy ham to my pizza is a rip off!\n\nAnd it wasn't even as good as the speck that I've had in Italy! I also got the arancini balls. They're pricey at $1.00 each, and much smaller than they appear in the pics on here. It was just OK. My total came out to be $31.75 (that included a diet coke with free refills) just for me! I sat at the bar since all the booths were taken at that time.The guy who was my server was nice and attentive at first. He asked me if I wanted refills on my diet coke often. Well, I got annoyed near the end since he almost took away the pizza dish before I was done with my last few bites! He didn't even ask me if I was done or apologize for his mistake! I had to put my hand down and push the plate back towards me. Awkward!\n\nHalf way into my meal, the place became practically empty. I counted a total of SIX people there including a kid with her mom! So, why were they so eager to get me out of there so fast? It's not as if anyone is waiting for a table! Also, I overheard him talking to someone about leaving in 15 minutes. Apparently he was in a big rush to go home and was afraid that he'd also miss out on his tip if I didn't hurry the hell up! Well, I would've left a better rating for them, a 3.5 instead of a three if I wasn't so rushed! He undid all the good he did by rushing me! I still left him a tip, but it was slightly less than 15%.

Okay, no worries, things happen, I wasn't mad...then the bill comes for my Brioche with ice cream. Well, I guess that is fair, but what is this? My bill was $8 for a $6 scoop of gelato. What? There was a fee on the bill named coperto. What's that??? I later googled it... It means \"bread and cover\". It is a fee just to sit in the restaurant. The thing is, there was no bread!!!

Going early, before 6pm, and visiting the California Street location (larger than Mission) proved a winning formula for scoring a table.  By the time our meal hit the table, alas, the blackboard had a long list of names and a crowd of eager, expectant loiterers had gathered on the front sidewalk.\n\nOur pair of appetizers were a celebration of simplicity - a beautiful-to-behold insalata tricolore and a delightfully creamy hand-pulled burrata.  Together they likely had less than 10 ingredients, all phenomenally fresh, robust in flavor and paired to perfect synergy.  The grana padano atop the tricolore, itself mixed gently with lemon vinaigrette, was divine, and the burrata was among the best we've tasted, and we've had it our share of gastro-havens.  The grilled bread with the burrata, with a crisp, fresh-off-the-fire smokiness and a super-soft inside, could produce addiction.\n\nMost of the pizzas sounded tempting, and choosing only one was an arduous process.  Luckily we landed on 4 Formaggi (four cheeses), and somehow every square inch of our pie had a magically-balanced blend of each of the four (mozzarella, fontal (fontina), pecorino, and provolone).   With this rich array of cheeses and the blissfully blistered Neapolitan crust, we had found a few little slices of heaven.", "author": "Derek W."}

The Allesandro was good as well (4/5).\n\nDespite my desire to order the margherita, we ordered one of the daily specials which was the Purgatorio. If you've never had egg on a pizza, you're basically ruining all future experiences by starting with this. Take Delfina's crispy crust and put a spicy tomato sauce similar to arrabbiata sauce on top. Now add a healthy dose of pecorino romano cheese. Now add two farm fresh eggs with slightly runny yolks.\n\nThere is something to be said about the creaminess of a yolk cut by the mild spice of the sauce on top of the crispy crust. I've never really experienced this before but you must try it.\n\nI'd like to come again to try the things that are on the 7x7 list before I give up a 5-star rating. $40+ for pizza and salad is a bit steep, but it was good and pretty much worth it.", "author": "Dave K."}

One of the employees was always bringing more before we even finished what was on the table - definitely a win in ANY book.\n\nWe ordered a whole bunch of pizzas - the clam bake, some sausage one, the broccoli raabe, and the margherita. They were all superb. I think the definite winner at the table was the sausage one - everyone just couldn't stop raving about it! The broccoli raabe was definitely super interesting. Usually when they put greens on a pizza you dont get any taste from it, but this definitely tasted \"green\" - and was a nice break from the heavy toppings we are used to having on pizza. Definitely refreshing. We were talking about it and if you shared the broccoli raabe and the sausage pizzas you would be all set.\n\nI also ordered the tricolore salad. It was nothing special. Not a salad you can really share, even if you are just using it as a small app or a side dish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-10", "description": "I'm not into spicy food. My face turns red and my lips swell. So I was discouraged that the menu was full of items with chili oil and red peppers. Not just because I don't like heat, but it indicates one-dimensional cooking. I was even more discouraged by an exhausting 35 minute wait for two people arriving at 6:55P on a Monday.\n\nThe \"roasted corn starter\" was corn on the cob with a thick, slobberingly-succulent slathering in butter/pork fat. The corn also had chili oil which I didn't like and even worse, the chili oil was not mentioned on the menu. Had I known, I wouldn't have ordered it. The corn was high quality and perfectly cooked.\n\nThe thinly sliced eggplant parmesan had more breading than eggplant. The best part was the bright red and simple tomato sauce. The unflattering end result was breading getting soggy in sauce.\n\nThey also used the same sauce on the Margherita pizza. Unfortunately, the pizza had a burnt crust (I don't understand why it's become acceptable to burn food) and three small leaves of basil. I ended up using the table condiments to better flavor the pizza which I rarely do at any restaurant. The crust was thin and held up nicely, but lacked flavor.\n\nThe fried pig ears had a coating that was greasy and gummy. Thankfully, the chili oil was on the side, as was the lime.\n\nThe wines offered were a limited and lowly list of affordable Italian wines. I ordered a bottle of the Ciro rosso classico for $40.\n\nMy final point of frustration came with the bill which had a $3 \"coperto\" surcharge \"to support SF employer mandates.\" Whether it is a valid charge or not, it's distasteful to itemize your employee costs (payroll tax, disability, insurance, health care, etc.) on the bill. I'm just going out to eat - not hiring a contractor to renovate my house and require a line item budget. So if the restaurant owners want to play these games, how about I play a game where I consider the coperto the tip?

Glad to say they open exactly at 11:30am, on the dot!\n\nSince we had a large group, we decided to order a few things off the menu and just share everything.  We were able to try 4 types of their Neapolitan-style pizzas, as well as a few appetizers!\n\n+ Margherita - tomato, fior di latte mozzarella & basil.  Delfina has definitely got margherita right!  Great tomato sauce with a great crust and fresh mozzarella is definitely the way to go!\n+ Broccoli Raab - broccoli raab, caciocavallo, mozzarella, olives & hot peppers.  This is definitely a pie that's more for the grown ups.  Brccoli Raab has that distinctive bitter flavor, which I do like a lot.\n+ Prosciutto Pie - prosciutto di parma, caciocavallo, mozzarella, panna & arugula.  I was afraid of prosciutto being skimped, like many places, but no worries about that here!  Arugula is loosely topped onto the pie once it is baked.\n+ Salsiccia - housemade fennel sausage, tomato, bell peppers, onions & mozzarella.  The housemade sausage is definitely the star.  I can probably just eat the sausage by the spoonful.\n+ Chilled Tripe \"Tripperia Style\" - chilled tripe served with salt & chili oil.  Some people will be turned off by this, but it is a really really refreshing dish.  Squirt some lemon over the tripe and drizzle a bit of the oil, with a dash of the salt, and it's a cool flavorful party going on in your mouth!\n+ Mozzarella in Carrozza - super tasty but super oily.  They put a fun spin on a classic Italian dish.  Mozzarella is stuffed inside bread from the famous Acme Bakery, then deep fried in this light tempura batter.  Of course when cheese is friend, it is melted and turns into this orgasmic gooey mess.\n\nNothing wow-ed me but the pizzas are just solid at Delfina!  I'm a huge fan of margherita pizzas and Delfina has a great one.  I also like how they change the menu up with seasonal ingredients and the appetizers we tried were all tasty.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very comfortable too, with lots of day light coming into the restaurant.

And to top it all off, the trendy / hipster vibe they're aiming for somehow actually works.\n\nHere is my recommendation if you want to indulge in the ideal meal at Delfina:\n\nFor an appetizer, whatever their version of a mozzarella stick is, it's a gift from the gods.  They take some of the freshest motz I've ever had, fry the shit out of it, then douse it with some kind of wonder sauce.  For $7, it's perfect for 2, but if you're dining with 3 or 4, it's a perfect treat that everyone at the table can try.  In addition, their special artichoke appetizer was sensational, although I can't remember for the life of me what the hell it was called.\n\nPizza is obviously what the show is all about at Delfina, and you'd be well advised to try out a couple of their pies while you are there.  The Margarita is the biz, very olive oily taste and the tomato sauce is so fresh you'd think the server picked the tomatoes and made it for you personally.\n\nAfter you're done stuffing your face with delicious thin crust pizza, don't be that boner who passes on dessert because you have a pint of Ben and Jerry's sitting in your freezer at home, Delfina's post-meal treats are excellent.  The gelato is oh-so sumptuous, and when you mix it with their fried pizza dough (Zeppole di San Giuseppe), you feel like you won the food lottery as you sit fat and happy trying to figure out how you're going to find the will to stand up and exit the building.\n\nNot the best pizza joint in the world by any means, but as wonderful a food experience as you will find in Pacific Heights.

No other restaurants on Filmore street had a wait, so we figured that this was the best place around, and we were right! We ordered glasses of wine while we waited, which made the time go by. The turnover is really fast and they try to seat people as soon as possible. \nLoved the hole-in-the-wall atmosphere and cozy feel of the restaurant. I wish that they served real bread instead of the breadsticks because we were starving, but I guess that doesn't coincide with authentic Italian cuisine. We ended up having to Google a bunch of words off the menu because we had no idea what the ingredients were. We finally decided on Pecorino Lucano for an appetizer and Salsiccia for our pizza. And YUM did we make great choices! I highly recommend both. The appetizer came with a lot of cheese and it was a great pairing with the fava beans. The pizza was cooked perfectly and had just enough spice. The sausage, bell peppers, and onions were a great flavor combination and I would definitely order it again. Perfect size for two people.

Long wait!\n\nI think that sums it up.\n\nI visited with two friends and showed up around 8pm for dinner on a Tuesday night. We waited about 30 minutes for a table for a party of 3. Luckily, we were able to order a bottle of wine while we were waiting, however, this place is pretty small and seats are only available for diners so there was no place for the bar for us to have our drinks. If you have drinks, you aren't permitted to sit on outdoor public sidewalk area either, so we were in a weird limbo standing in the waiting area drinking our bottle of wine...but whatevs, it was better than nothing.\n\nEventually, we were seated at the bar which was a great vantage point of the prep area for desserts and all other non-pizza related foods. Immediately, we saw some sundaes being prepared and they looked soooooo good. We knew we had to make room for dessert before even looking at the menus! \n\nWe ordered the proscuitto pizza, sausage pizza and the broccoli rabe pizza. The proscuitto and the sausage were our favorites. I really liked the broccoli rabe pizza but they weren't the top pick for my friends. \n\nBeing a self proclaimed pizza aficionado (like everyone else in NYC says they are!!!!), I was really impressed with this place!!!!! The crusts were cooked perfectly, and even though the sausage pizza was pretty wet, the bottom of the pizza was not overly soggy and did not fall apart. The toppings were really authentic and I'll recommend this place to my friends from NYC visiting SF.\n\nOur server was really helpful and did a great job considering how incredibly busy this place was. He was wiping down the counter as he was clearing our plates and accidentally spilt my friend's glass of red wine over and was insanely apologetic, even though it wasn't a big deal. He offered multiple times to pay for her dry cleaning (she was wearing old jeans and a t-shirt so NDB) and comped us an extra sundae. Another employee, I'm assuming a shift supervisor or manager, came over and also apologized and offered to pay for dry cleaning. The staff were REALLY nice about this incident and I was impressed at how quickly and, above all, professionally they reacted. \n\nNext our cherry sundaes arrived with fresh whip, cherries and vanilla bean gelato. Awesome!!!! Very tasty...we were planning on sharing just one (and it would have been more than enough after 3 pizzas) but since we got an extra one on the house, we stuffed ourselves silly.\n\nIt was a great experience - I'll be back the next time I'm in town!

I've been wanting to try Pizzeria Delfina for a while but never had the chance.  Came here on a Saturday with a friend and was told the wait was going to be an hour. I just paid for parking too! So walked around the neighborhood but wasn't in the mood to try any other place. Came back and decided to order a pizza to go and eat in the car. \n\nI originally wanted to order the pigs ears but they were sold out. The lady suggested I order the fries with eyes. For some reason when she was explaining what they were, I kind of zoned out. I assumed it came with fries but I was wrong. It was just deep fried fish. It reminded me of deep fried fish you could find in chinese restaurants in hong kong during dim sum but with aioli sauce. I loved it but the portions were a little small and it was pricey. I also ordered the 4 formaggi pizza which was a little salty. I ended up not eating the crust because this was the chewiest pizza I've ever had. My friend and I both skipped out on eating the crusts because our jaws started hurting from just eating the pizza. \n\nThe place was a little pricey and the food was not worth the hour wait. Luckily I ordered togo and waited 15 minutes. The workers were very friendly and the menu is pretty diverse for a pizzeria. Might come back and order the pigs ears to go next time but don't think I'll be coming back for the pizza.", "author": "Sean W."}

It's the thin, Italian kind which is just simple and delectable.  Who says pizza has to be heavy to taste good?  But, here you do have to eat it quite fast because it cools fast and ours got soggy in the middle from the sauce.  The fior di latte mozzarella was so fresh and I loved the fresh ingredients (parmesan, red chili peppers, etc.). on the table too.\n\nMeatballs were a bit on the salty side.  BUT if you can just alternate between eating that and the crust of your pizza, it's quite good.  It comes out REALLY REALLY hot.  Believe me, they did not let it cool a second before they brought it out to us.  You get 5-6 hefty meatballs with a crostini that I'm assuming was baked with it because it was so crispy.  It's perfect for dipping into the sauce which we actually devoured.  \n\nThe wait is still ridiculous.  I finished eating and left at around 10 p.m. and there were STILL people waiting.  But it's totally worth it.  I recommend sitting at the bar; there's better lighting and you can get a glimpse of the action from the kitchen.\n\nOn a side note, they were playing a lot of Tupac (and similar music) the night I dined here.

Panna - Tomato sauce, cream, basil, shaved parmigiano\n\nMy favorite was definitely the Salsiccia. The sausage had a ton of flavor and was cooked to perfection. The panna followed as the large shavings of parmigiano and basil added a ton of flavor. And the broccoli raab was good, though compared to the other two, it was definitely my least favorite.\n\nThe table also ended up getting the meatball calzone which for many turned out to be the best thing they had the entire night. Definitely give it a try!\n\nNot yet ready to leave (at this point we'd been there for almost 2 hours...I understand the why the wait is so long now...), we looked at the dessert menu and ordered the fried pizza dough with mascarpone cream and gelato in 4 different flavors (favorites being the thai iced tea and the toasted almond)\n\nAnd 3 hours later, we walked out as we literally shut down the restaurant. Not once was the wait staff curt with us for that (granted we kept ordering food, but we stuck around after we paid for a good 45 minutes) and was incredibly helpful in deciding what to get as well! I love this place and I hope I never have to wait in line so I can continue enjoying it the way I did. Some of the best pizza I've had in the city, hands down.", "author": "Aditi R."}

Everything was average and highly overrated except for maybe the prosciutto pie. It was pretty good, but that maybe bc of my love for proscuitto. \n\nI love pizza.. all pizza - thin, thick, chicago, new york, gourmet, meaty, veggie, cheese.. everything. I'm not picky. Unfortunately, this place does not live up to the hype. Maybe it's because there is way too much hype, but the bar is set too high and this place can't live up to it. At least in terms of the food. \n\nThe staff DEFINITELY needs work. I live around the corner and it was my first time there. I wasn't sure how the \"name on the board\" system worked and I could barely get the waitstaff to explain how to put my name down for a table. Multiple waitstaff would walk by, make eye contact, and then look away and walk away. They aren't friendly until you are sitting at your table.

Was sorely looking forward to trying the famous Margherita pizza, having seen it on 7x7's top 100 list.  \n\nGotta say...big letdown.\n\nThe restaurant itself seemed a pleasant enough space, and I can see myself returning here to dine in.  The service was average, not exactly friendly, yet prompt.\n\nNow on to the pizza!  I'm a big fan of a good margherita, and I've had some winners.  As mentioned, my engines were revved, looking forward to this one.  Got it to go in-box, with pepper, cheese, and dried basil.   \n\nOpened the box, and...first impression....where the hell is the basil???  There were 2, count 'em, 2 measly pieces of basil cooked onto the pizza.  How would this happen?  Basic food prep tells you to spread the toppings in some semblance of evenness over the pie.  Strike one.\n\nBut it smelled so good, so I was looking forward to savoring the wonderful cheese and tomato sauce.  I grab a slice, take a big ole' bite, and....the cheese comes completely off the slice in a single bite, dragged off by my teeth.  This means the cheese is undercooked and hasn't melted enough.  Interesting, considering the outer edges of the crust were blackened.  So the pizza was cooked unevenly.  Strike two.\n\nHowever, the pizza did still taste pretty darn good, and it was obvious that fresh, quality ingredients were used, saving this poor, deprived, malnourished, underserved pizza from the dreaded single star review.\n\nPerhaps this was an off day, or the wrong location to get Delfina's best pizza, or...perhaps the cooks here are just inconsistent. \n\nEither way, I'll give the Pizzeria Delfina in the Mission a shot and see if they can serve a better pie.\n\nFor now, I walk away still hungry, disappointed, and wondering where my basil is!\n\nTaste: 3.5\nPreparation: 1.5", "author": "Ethan R."}

But at Pizzaria Delfina, the chewy smokey, delicious crust is just too good to share. Sorry Simba, but dog biscuits for you today.\n\nI've been out to the one in the Mission dozens of times, but just the thought of trying to find parking near 18th St makes me cringe. I was in the Richmond so I decided to give the Lower Pac Heights location a chance and drive by. \n\nRockstar parking right in front of the restaurant? CHECK. A ten minute wait? CHECK. Honestly at this point I was wondering why I keep going to the Mission location (then I remembered that Bi-Rite ice cream and Dolores Park were located half block away).\n\nThis was a my first trip to this location and it was considerably bigger inside than the Mission spot. There was a small group of people outside waiting for tables, but nothing unreasonable. And so much less foot traffic than 18th St which makes Simba less nervous.\n\nI decided to be adventurous and get the special on the board, the Baccla pizza: salt cod, potato, panna, tomato, and oregano. Like every thing I've ever had at Delfina or the Pizzaria, the taste was stupendous! I thought the salt cod at first was clam (which I LOVE on pizza). The potato was a fantastic compliment to the salty flavor of the cod. It just worked. A little drizzle of red pepper oil would've made it perfect.", "author": "Cristofer P."}

They were the perfect amount of crisp and spice combined. For our entree, we ordered the four cheese pizza and the tricolore salad. The salad dressing was a divine lemon vinaigrette. I could order 5 of those salads and eat them all...and I'm a very picky salad eater. It was also topped with fresh cheese. On to the pizza...incredible! It was so crispy and the sauce was so pure and sweet. For the first time, maybe ever, I could legitimately taste four different cheeses. We ate everything. I also must mention that when you order iced tea, they bring you a small personal pitcher. Love this idea. Although we didn't eat dessert this time, we plan to try one of their freshly made gelatos. And when it's not raining outside, we will surely return with our dog and sit outside on their heated patio. I'm ready looking forward to our next outing at Delfina. P.S.

Don't show up on a completly empty stomach because you will starve in the meantime. Bring a snack in your purse or man satchel.\n\n2. Parking absolutely sucks! You're lucky if you can find street parking but it is $3.75 per hour so bring lots of change. Parking a few doors down in the California Ave lot is ideal  but waiting around stalking people to see if they will leave their spot can be a pain. If you're meeting people for lunch or dinner I'd recommend carving out at least 15-20 minutes to find a parking spot.\n\n3. Pay in cash! I used my credit card there once and was over-charged. We split the bill in half but I was charged the full amount and the person I was with was charged zero even though both cards were swiped and we both signed the bills. The manager was lovely though and remedied the situation when I called on the phone and was apologetic and profesional. I think they've had issues with staff not processing credit card transactions correctly.\n\n4. Overall, I love Pizzeria Delfina, it's one of my favorite pizza places.

The ensalata tricolore is radicchio, endive, and arugula topped with a simple lemon dressing and parmigiana reggiano. My friends didn't enjoy the ensalata tricolore as much as I did but I personally loved the bitterness of endive mixed with the nuttiness of arugula. \n\nThe only reason I took a star off is because of the service we received during our recent visit. We ordered the margherita, the ensalata, and meatballs. Usually the meatballs are one of the first things to come out but by the time we finished our pizza and salad, our meatballs still hadn't arrived. I asked our server to check on it and she said they usually take a long time (lies) and were being cooked. 15 minutes later, she came back to say the chefs had forgotten to make them and the meatballs just entered the oven. So she pretty much completely lied to us the first time she \"checked\". 5 minutes later, meatballs were finally on the table. Mind you, we'd already finished eating the rest of our meal.

From the Funghi Misti appetizer on, each meal is amazing. This dish is probably one of the finest starting courses I have ever consumed. Delicately fried Chanterelle, King's, and Oyster mushrooms from local farms are plated and served with a Meyer Lemon Aioli on the side. This is truly a wonderful dish; the perfect opening round.

One of the best is the Salsiccia, topped with house made fennel sausage, and mild peppers and onions. The crushed tomato sauce and beautiful Mozzarella cheese does wonders to bring out the other ingredients. Then, there's the crust, a perfectly made boundary within which the other ingredients await your sampling.\n\nGoing away from the delicious offerings for a minute, Pizzeria Delfina also has an excellent service staff and a price tag that matches the food being given out.

My friend and I ordered their \"Magic\" pizza (which is essentially their Panna pizza with sausage) and their Clam pie.  The Magic was of course.. magical.  The Clam pie was of course.. clammy.. but in a good way.  It was like tasting the goodness of the ocean with every bite.  The crust was thin with a thick doughy edge.  The staff was very helpful and attentive.\n\nOverall wallet damage for 1 coke, 3 beers, small salad, and 2 pizzas came out to roughly $64 (or $32 for each person).  Kinda hefty for lunch, but heck..

The wait at 6:45 on a Sunday night for 3 people was almost an hour!!! But we got a nice booth in the back. Ultimately, I think the food made up for it. We got two pizzas: the Proscuitto and the Salsicca. Both were excellent, but I was partial to the Proscuitto with its generous sprinkling of fresh arugula on top. We also got a side of the grilled asparagus, which didn't disappoint. It was generously covered in lardo butter and topped with crispy breadcrumbs and more proscuitto. Yum. I could eat this alone...maybe they can turn it into a pizza? :) We ended with some of their homemade gelato: hazelnut and pistachio hit the spot. I liked the fact that they include whole pistachios and hazelnuts in their ice creams. I would return, but probably with only one other dining companion in order to speed up the wait. Or, maybe I'll just get takeout, which half of the diners seemed to do. I'll definitely keep this place in mind the next time I'm in Pac Heights.

The Broc Raab was great with copious amounts of broccoli on it.  It wasn't over salted, which is often a mistake made in Neapolitan pizzerias.

And god forbid we should share. Four steaming artisan pizzas found their way onto our tables and our butts.

I have to say the food is consistently very delicious and well executed BUT, and this is a big but, we had a terrible service experience when my boyfriend and I took our two friends for dinner there last night. \n\nWe ordered two pizzas, a salad and a pitcher of beer a few minutes after sitting down. We got our beer about 10 minutes in, and then continued to sit there drinking beer... waiting... waiting. A neighboring table who ordered after us recieves their food. Our waitress comes backs, asks us if we would like another beer and a couple of us say yes. At this point, we are getting very confused about what is taking so long to make a salad.\n\nAlso, it's a Monday.\n\nThen, about 30 minutes in, she returns and apologetically tells us she has forgotten to put in our order at all. We are slightly annoyed but figure she is going to put it in \"on the fly\" and it should be out in a few. About 15 minutes after her update, we receive just our salad. 20 minutes after that, one pizza. ANOTHER, 10-15 minutes, the last pizza. Seriously, you didn't even put a rush on it after forgetting about our food for 30 minutes? It became obvious she didn't talk to a manager about her mistake.\n\nWe had originally wanted to get one of Delfina's awesome-looking desserts but decided against it after the outrageous tenure of our dinner and the thought of waiting another 30 minutes for that.\nObviously frustrated when she returned to ask us about the meal, she continued to make small talk and said \"thanks for being understanding\". We are like OK and continued to be polite, figuring she might take care of something to make up for the 50 minutes it took waiting before we got a pizza.

You'd think we'd have a system figured out by now, but after all these years, we still go back and forth quite a bit with suggestions.  So, when we quickly (for us) settled on checking out Delfina in the Mission, it's like it was meant to be.  Well, sorta.  It certainly was meant to be...just not the one in the Mission!\n\nAfter calling ahead to find out how long the walk-in wait would be, we were glad to find out that it hadn't really changed by the time we had showed up.  A wait time of 20 minutes?  No problem compared to the 90 minutes or so we were told for the Delfina in the Mission.  Plus, it gave us time to browse through the menu and scope what other tables were having for their dinner.  And boy did the food look good!  When it came time to order, we went with the the Salsiccia pizza (housemade fennel sausage, tomato, bell peppers, onions, and mozzarella) and the P.E.I. Mussels.\n\nThe pizza is pretty solid - similar to a combination type of pizza with a nice crust.  I wouldn't call it thin since it wasn't exactly brittle and crisp, but it wasn't thick either.  Somewhere between pan and thin, but it was great.  The fennel sausage was the best part of the pizza though, and not just because I love sausage on my pizza.  Delicious flavor with just a touch of kick form the spices.  Not always a fan of bell peppers, but these were okay, which says something for me.  The mussels were pretty solid, but a couple of pieces weren't as flavorful as others.  Not bad overall, but I wish they gave more of that buttery toast for that great wine sauce.  The breadsticks on the table are not bad, but can only hold so much sauce!\n\nOne thing that's pretty cool about Delfina is that they offer Dublin Dr. Peppers, which is sorta like saying a Mexican Coke.  Except in this case, it actually tastes better than its famous cousin (I don't get the appeal of Mexican Coke).  Our server was a pretty friendly guy and was nice enough to tell my friend and I to hold off on ordering more than we did.  The ambiance is pretty chill, though it can get pretty loud for conversations...especially if you happen to be sitting near the front by the crowd waiting.  Considering my previous failed attempts to check out Delfina, I'm glad to finally check it off of my \"to eat\" list.  I thought the food was good overall and that the service was great, though the volume level at times was what made me round it down instead of up.  The best part though is that my friend seemed to enjoy her meal as well, so maybe it'll be easier for us to choose where to eat next time!", "author": "Mike L."}

They should post what $ they took in and post where it went if it is truly for the employees which I am 100% for. Otherwise just raise the prices and put the $ in your pockets honestly.

Well, it was the end of a debaucherous weekend, we still hadn't been to Little Star, and they're not open for lunch. My friends had a flight to catch so a Little Star visit was out of the question. One of my roommates raves about Delfina so I decided to take my friends here instead. \n\nNow I don't think the pizza itself is as good as Little Star (the comparison might not be fair though since we're talking two completely different styles of pizza), but it's still delicious and five star worthy in my opinion. \n\nIt was pretty busy when we came in, and the place isn't that big, but we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for four. The restaurant has a really cool, unpretentious, but still a little classy feel to it. \n\nWe started with two appetizers. The fresh, stretched mozzarella, which was fantastic, as well as the spicy cauliflower. The mozzarella comes with a couple of pieces of crusty bread as well as a bed of some sort of greens that were yummy! It's lightly drizzled with olive oil as well. The appetizer was a little small to split amongst four people, but it's a good size to share with one other person. The cauliflower was delicious. There was nothing about it that necessarily blew my my mind, but it was spicy, which I liked. \n\nThe two pizzas we went with were the four cheese as well as the panna, which had a little cream on it (sounds kind of weird, but it's REALLY good). Both pizzas were excellent. The cheese and sauce on both tasted very fresh, and neither pizza was very heavy. The pies aren't huge, but a good amount to split amongst two people. \n\nEven though the restaurant was busy our waitress was very attentive, and knew the menu well when we had questions. The prices here are reasonable, with most pizzas costing between $10-15 and most appetizers under $10. I'll definitely be back!", "author": "George A."}

Sound crazy? Well, of course it does....\n\nThere's not much I can say about their fine array of delectable, artisan Italian pizzas that you haven't read previously, but for the vegan types out there who still like to join their pals for a gluttonous night on the town, don't let a stop through this particular pizza parlor leave you with the desolate, sexless option of eating nothing but garden salads and crushed red pepper. \n\nUpon asking my lovely server if they could whip up something that'd be appropriate for precocious youngster who doesn't animal byproducts, it was no sweat off of her perty little brow to recommend a vegan pizza consisting of spicy marinara, broccoli, mushrooms, and fresh basil. Once piping hot and sitting in front of me, the flavors worked so well together, I honestly think the presence cheese would have been a bit of a deterrent. It was easily one of the best vegan pies I've ever consumed, and it totally beat previous vegan versions I've consumed with that strange synthetic soy cheese alternative that most other pizza joints use in lieu of actual Mozzarella for difficult eaters like myself. Of course, that's not to say I'm complaining about spots that substitute Daiya cheese or some other cheese-but-not-really-cheese product, it's just that with ingredients this good, all you need are the plant based goods for a remarkable creation. \n\nWhat makes it even better is that the pizzas are small enough to where if there's any contention over which pie will arrive on the table, it's quite possible for each person to order their own individual pizzas and avoid a crisis. If you've worked up a pretty mean hunger, it's easy to pounce on a whole pizza just by yourself, but if you're more sated half way through, you'll walk out with a couple of slices to heat up in the company communal toaster oven the following afternoon.

I eat a lot of pizza. No, we're not talking Round Table, Pizza Hut, Costco or other chain pizzerias; we're talking real Italian pizza. I work in Italy every summer for roughly two months (I'm an archaeologist) and I eat Neapolitan pizza two to three days a week while I'm there. Thin crispy crust topped with buffalo mozzarella cheese, prosciutto, mushrooms, corn ... you name it, I've had it. When I come home to California, I don't want to eat pizza or pasta ever EVER again. I also can't stand to be in the freezer section in the supermarket, but that's another problem.\n\nI am ready to eat pizza again after my tomato, basil and garlic detox is complete sometime around November . When I want an authentic pizza, I head to Pizzeria Delfina. I only go for lunch because I don't have the patience to wait for a table during their dinner rush. If there are more than three parties on that chalkboard, I'm moving down the street to another establishment. I unfortunately don't live in San Francisco anymore, and Pizzeria Delfina is on the list of places I eat when am back in town.\n\nThe fried pig ears are amazing, and my favorite pizza on the menu is the salsiccia. A few times I've had one of their rotating pies and I haven't be disappointed. The place also has Peroni on tap, the best accompaniment for a fine slice of pizza.\n\nIf you like Chicago, New York, or other heavier pies this place probably won't rock your socks off, but I hope you try it and appreciate the differences between the two traditions.", "author": "Victoria K."}

Fresh globs of mozzarella, amazing sauce, and a crust that was so delightfully thin and chewy and crispy at the same time that I ate all my crusts. ALL! Salsiccia is your typical sausage/bell pepper/onion/mozzarella pizza, but the fennel sausage really makes the pizza outstanding. Tried the Capricciosa which is not on their regular menu.

The buttery bread that came with it was absolutely divine!\n\nStaff - Awesome!

This place would be a 5 star minus the never ending long wait!\n\nEvery item that we tried was easily 4-5 stars!  SO DELICIOUS\n\n1. Fresh-stretched Mozzarella  8.25 - 4 stars - the unfortunate part of this was that they ran out when we ordered but they brought out a fresh batch for us as long as we didn't mind it coming in the middle of our dinner.  it was GOOD but it wasn't as stretchy or as tasty as i imagined.  maybe i like baked mozzarella more?  i expected more flavor to come out from the pieces of mozzarella.\n\n2. Margherita - Tomato, fior di latte mozzarella, basil $13.00 - 5 stars - SO AMAZING!  every bite is a mouthful of juicy cheesyness and tomato flavors.  typing right now makes my mouth drool.  this is my favorite pizza here, hands down!\n\n\n3.  Salsiccia - Housemade fennel sausage, tomato, bell peppers, onions, mozzarella - $15.75 - 5 stars - if you love MEAT, this is the item to order.  Every bite guarantees yummy housemade sauce.  It's a little on the salty side but really, if you're ordering sausage that's exactly what you expect. \n\n\n4.  Neapolitan Meatballs in Sugo - 13.75 - 5 stars - my absolutely FAVORITE.  sometimes i wish they provided more bread so you could scoop up every little bit of sauce that comes with the meatballs.  very smooth creamy taste and the meatballs perfectly complement the taste of the sauce.  definitely a splittable dish.  \n\n5.  Prosciutto Pie - Prosciutto di Parma, caciocavallo, mozzarella, panna, arugula = $17 - 5 stars - like the concept of a pie but i still prefer the pizza over the pies here.  the prosciutto is very fresh and the presentation is absolutely stunning.  taste is GOOD but not my favorite.\n\nAdd a pitcher of beer and the total came to $120 with tip.\n\nnegatives:  SUCH A LONG WAIT!

We got there around 11:30am today, and were shocked that we got a seat immediately, since we always see lines every other time we drive by.  We started with the grilled asparagus special, which came topped with lardo butter, bacon, and bread crumbs.  Amazing!  I'm sure all the other stuff cancelled out the healthiness of the asparagus, but I'm still glad we started with veggies.  However, the crostini, fried asparagus, and arancini also were very tempting.  \n\nWe followed that with the Salsiccia pizza and the meatball calzone.  The calzone was just perfectly cooked, warm, gooey, and cheesy on the inside, with a nice light, crispy shell.  The meatballs were delicious and not too dense.  We had the Margherita and Salsiccia pizzas last time, and both were good, but the sausage was definitely the most memorable.  Today, the sausage was again super good, and the pizza had the just the right amount of toppings on a perfectly crisp and chewy crust.  It was just right.

I've had some nice sides/salads/antipastas, too... especially love their olives (served warm!). \n\nPizza aside, I like the ambiance.

Luckily, a lot of people put their names on the chalkboard and went down the street for a drink...and their names ended up getting called pretty quickly. The estimated 1 hr wait ended up being 20-30 minutes. There isn't much of a bar area for people who are waiting for their tables, but it's probably worth staying close to the hostess in case your name is called.\n\nI started with beet salad and the large meat platter which was probably a bit aggressive. The large meat platter was great - a wide selection of salamis, pepperoni, proscuitto...the works. The beet salad was hearty and heavy on the beets (which isn't always the case with beet salads!).\n\nI ordered the broccoli raab and olive pizza, though I probably should've gone with my first instinct in ordering the margherita as the olives were just too briney for me. My friend got one of the special pizzas of the day that had sausage and a bitter green - that was quite tasty.\n\nI'm not a dessert person but as we were sitting at the bar, I saw them making this amazing looking dessert that looked like a version of a funnel cake (but instead of strawberries, cream!) - the zeppolino (or something like that). That dessert probably single-handedly moved my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars. Delicious.", "author": "Wendy L."}

I waited almost an hour for both locations and it definitely sway my opinion of this place.\n\nPros:\nAwesome thin crust pizzas for a reasonable price.  \n\nNapolentana: This one has anchovies and olives with a tomato base sauce.  You gotta be careful because the olives and anchovies flavors are very strong.  People who hates anchovies will definitely hate this.  I liked it.\nSalsiccia: It's like a combo and is definitely the star of the night.  I love their tomato sauce and fennel sausages.  Topped with green bell peppers and mozzarella.  Must get.\nMargherita: The basic pizza and also very delicious.  It's gotta be that tomato sauce.\nCalzone: A non tomato sauce with Nettles, Ricotta, Pinenut, Cacciocavallo.  This would be my favorite if not for the smaller size.  Who said size doesn't matter?  I want more of it.\n\nFinals:\nDue to the wait and horrible parking situation, I can only encourage people to order takeouts.  Pizza is not worth standing in some cold windy weather for an hour.

I've tried this place twice, once with my boyfriend a few months back and another just this past Friday with my coworkers for lunch. \n\nThe first time going, I ordered a Margherita and Salsiccia pizza and started with a ciccioli. The ciccioli was described to us as mozzarella sticks battered with pig fat and that was exactly what we got. The first two bites were scrumptious and definitely FATTY. As it started cooling down, I just felt nauseous. *shiver. Never again.\nOur pizzas came and the portion was just right. The crusts are thin and pizzas simple and bare. The pizza margherita definitely needed more than the few slices of fresh mozzarella on it. I guess that's how they make it and it's not what I was expecting. The Salsiccia was good with a perfect and crispy crust... But other than that, i feel like I've enjoyed better. Our first impression of the restaurant didn't leave a lasting mark. \n\nThe second time going with my coworkers, it was a light lunch. Started off with a delicious and lightly battered Sand Dab. That was good with lightly sprinkled lemon juice, olive oil, and dipped in aioli.  Then shared the broccoli raab between three of us. First thoughts? The broccoli tastes exactly like the leafy and bitter Chinese broccoli I eat at Chinese restaurants down to the bit. Just covered with cheese and with some sprinkles of salty olives.

We (my sis, bro, and myself) got seated by the window and the waiter brought us our glasses of water.  We were settled and ready to order after a few minutes.  A waiter approached us and instead of taking our order, he asked us to move to a different table.  WTF.  They wanted to accommodate another party that just walked in.  Seriously RUDE.  Being too damn nice for our own good, we said fine.  \n\n2. After moving, the waiter finally took our order.  We decide on a special they had for the day, which included mushrooms.  The other pie was the \"Salsiccia\" with sausage, tomato, bell peppers, onions, and mozzarella.  The pizza finally arrives and we're irritated & hungry at this point.  The first thing we notice is that the crust is BURNT.  We take a few bites and realize most of the bottom of the whole damn pie is BURNT.  I've had enough thin crust pizza like this all over NYC and SF to know that these pies are messed up.  Crispy thin crust pie should not be burnt, especially for an establishment with such rave reviews.  But again, we're too nice and hungry and just keep eating. Also, the \"special\" pie had about 4 slivers of mushrooms and it was about $17.  Such a rip off.\n\n3. The entire time we're eating, the waiter doesn't come by ONCE to check on us or refill our water.  It's a little past the lunch hour so it's not super busy in there.  Also, we're seated right by the register, where all the waiters are standing around CHATTING and being lazy.  \n\nI haven't felt so irritated in a restaurant as I did here.  Just because you have lots of reviews on Yelp, doesn't mean you can serve burnt pizza and slack off on service.", "author": "Cynthia H."}

As a devout pizza lover and East Bay resident, I was not sure how high the quality would be across the bridge!\n\nWe started with the mozzarella in carozza which had great texture but was a bit bland.  I decided to save mine to eat with the sugo that accompanied the AMAZEBALLS, ahem, meatballs.  These meatballs were exactly what a meatball should be: moist, flavorful and absolutely delicious.  They alone cinched a repeat visit.  And I was right, the sauce on the mozzarella improved it dramatically.  \n\nLest I forget, we had a tasty roasted cauliflower with dried capers and peppers.  I'm not a fan of the vegetables generally but this was good and assuaged my guilt about the other items.  \n\nFinally, the pizza.  We ordered the prosciutto pie and it was very good!  The arugula on top could use a bit more flavor in its dressing if it's going to be such a prominent ingredient but otherwise it was great.  Excellent crust, cracker crisp on the bottom.\n\nOur service was absolutely lovely and very attentive.

After the first few months of it being open, we actually stopped bothering because of the crowds of people shrouding the doors. Unless you're eating at off-peak times, prepare to wait - even for an outdoor table on a foggy night. That being said, they have overhead heatlamps that make the outdoor area quite cozy.\n\nOne semi-foggy Saturday afternoon around 4pm, we walked by and saw that all of the outdoor tables were open, so we figured why not.  Having already stuffed our faces a few hours prior, we opted to only get pizza and wine - no starters. We got the pizza special - cherry pie - marinated cherry tomatoes, ricotta salata, basil, and olive oil. This was THE perfect pizza pie. The combination of the toppings with the juiciness of the cherry tomatoes was deeeelicious. I even ate the crust.\n\nNow, we were only going to eat the pizza, but as our server listed the gelato flavors, we were very intrigued by the blueberry swirl.  Oh yes, we caved in and got dessert. There wasn't as much blueberry as I'd expected, but mmm mmm mmmm, dessert was good.  This was quite possibly the most perfect meal we've had in a while. The best part is that it was so unexpected.\n\nWe will back, Pizzeria Delfina....and hopefully a lot sooner than another 3 years from now.", "author": "Lisa C."}

Our bread sticks was refilled before we even had to ask and our orders were taken without us needing to waive our server down. Throughout our entire meal, various servers came over to check up on us without being annoying or pushy.\n\nThe pizza needless to say was divine and no better than the Mission location but the obvious difference between the two locations was the service!

We were greeted promptly by a friendly server who put our name on the blackboard and offered to take our beverage order. The friendly service continued once we were seated and throughout the meal. The varieties were innovative without being pretentious. I didn't need to use the Google Italian-English translator the way I do at certain competing pizza establishments in the  city. The thin-ness and crispiness of the crust, the tanginess of the tomato sauce and the fresh creaminess of the cheese all jived with my hardened New Yorker standards. The only regret of the experience was the Zeppole di San Giuseppe we ordered for dessert. Zeppole are by definition balls of fried dough - a spherical cousin to the beignet. At Pizzeria Delfina they are thin flat rounds of pizza dough that have been deep fried and adorned with a mascarpone-based icing. The taste was decent, but they were not hot enough (possibly attributing to the time taken for decoration) and they definitely were not zeppole. Next time we will skip them.", "author": "Keith R."}

My brother said that Delfina is his favorite pizza place so we decided to try Delfina in Pac Heights. The place is a bit small so although my name was at the top of the list, we had to wait a while for a table for 5 to open up. The server apologized saying that people have paid but are just chatting. Finally, 2 tables for 2 that were next to each other opened up so they pushed the tables together and sat us there. It was very tight and apparently the old Caucasian couple seated to the left of us kept making snide remarks about how close we were sitting to them. My mom moved in closer as much as she could (we didn't ask to be seated in a tight space) but the lady kept making comments like, \"she's practically sitting on my lap\" (we could've actually fit another person between them!), and about us being Chinese. So they paid and got up to leave, and the lady rudely told my mom to move over. Sigh, I thought San Francisco is a diverse and progressive city. \n\nI know this isn't Delfina's fault; their pizza was delicious and the staff was great.

There always seems to be a wait, which is worth it for up to 45 minutes. They should, however, have a better waiting area than the small bench at the doorway. Too many people there makes it an uncomfortable wait.\n\nWent to this place twice in the same week unintentionally. Loved their root beer and Tricolore salad. Not too in to the fennel veggie dish just because it was too salty and made an unsuccessful attempt to be zesty. Ordered it because they ran out of their special salad.\n\nNormally not a fan of thin crust pizza, but I would come back for Delfina's pizza. For dinner #1 the pizza was a 4 Formaggi. Tasty. \nThe choice for dinner #2 was the Salsiccia pizza. Warning: spicy sausage! I prefer to be warned on the menu, folks. Also, just an FYI, they do occasionally fall victim to the charred edge of the thin crust.\n\nWould I go back there? Sure. I like their interior color scheme and the food is fresh.

Pizzeria Delfina was definitely able to satisfy my hunger.  I read the reviews before going and many people said that there was a wait so before going I called to see if there was a wait and if so if I could make reservations.  Unfortunately, I was told it's first come, first serve.  We decided to go for it anyway and when the three of us arrived, we were told the wait was for about an hour.  We decided to wait it out and they have a chalk board where you write your name and the number of people in your party.  We ended up waiting for at most about 45 minutes because three seats opened up at the bar/counter.  If we didn't take those seats, the wait for a table was about another 10 minutes.  Service was good.  All the staff were attentive and nice. The food came pretty quick, which is what I would expect because this place is not too big and there were a lot of chefs in the kitchen.  I got the margarita pizza and it was very good.  The size was good.  I was pretty hungry and ate the whole thing myself. I highly recommend asking for olive oil so you can dip the slice of pizza in the olive oil because it adds more taste.  Speaking of taste, I could really taste the quality and freshness of the ingredients. The one negative I had with this place was the music.  They unnecessarily blast rock music through the speakers so we all kind of have to yell to each other.

I've heard so much about Pizzeria Delfina, but never had the chance to try it until my most recent trip to San Francisco.  40 minute wait be damned, I was gonna try it!  \n\nWow~!!!  The Purgatorio pizza was fantastic!  Spicy, meaty, with EGG!  Who would have ever thought that pizza and egg would be such a fantastic combination?  The egg yolk was purposefully runny, mixing perfectly with the thin crust, spicy tomato sauce, and spicy Italian meats.  Probably the best pizza I've ever had!  I would have loved to try the other pizzas, but there was only 2 of us and we had only a limited amount of stomach space. \n\nMy friend and I are fairly adventurous eaters so we also ordered the Grilled Fennel with shaved bottarga & lemon oil dish.  What is bottarga, you ask?  Why it's dried, cured, fish roe!  It adds a nice sea brine to the fennel.  Combined with the lemon oil, it was a fresh, tasty, and light dish.  Yum!\n\nLastly, we tried the grilled sardines, which was also very good, but not my favorite of the evening.  I wish it had more flavor.  \n\nReally wish I had dessert there too!", "author": "Annie L."}

Delfina puts out a neapolitan pizza in style with the addition of more inventive toppings than tradition.  My fav!  The crust is thin and perfectly 'burnt' on the edges and bottom.  The toppings are ideally portioned to not overwhelm, but definitely get taste with every bite.  \n\nThis night, we went with the broccoli raab and hen of the woods mushroom pies with a side of the braised kale, currants, pine nuts.  We had the side come out first (salad kinda) and it was marvelous.  They went a little overboard on the olive oil, but amazing none the less.  Both pies were delicious and a favorite couldn't be decided on.  \n\nThe service was really awesome as well.  While waiting, the girls at the front counter made recommendations on wine and let us taste a couple pours before making our final decision.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-01-20", "description": "I love Pizzeria Delfina. I've been here three times in as many weeks. Twice to grab a Margerita pizza to-go and once with my sister for a sit down dinner. \n\nI've been to Italy a couple of times and their pizza comes about as close as America gets to a true Italian pie. Crispy but not crunchy crust and the perfect sauce to topping ratio. It's the kind of pizza that makes you want to eat an entire pie by yourself. No shame: been there, done that.\n \nIf you're in a hurry or don't feel like waiting forever for a table, I would recommend getting your order to-go. It's much easier and the pizza is still sizzling by the time you get back to your apartment. But if you intend to sit, plan your arrival for a lull in the dinner cycle: late enough to bypass the early birds but early enough to avoid the dinner crush. I think my sister and I got there around 7 PM. \n\nOur server was really sweet and gave us good suggestions about what to try. We had the insalata tricolore, spicy cauliflower, and prosciutto pie. The salad was great with just the right amount of shaved parmesan on top to offset the bitterness of the radiccio. The spicy caulifower was good, but only if you ate it quickly and had the pieces that had been fried the most. It was just on the cusp of being too crispy to have been cooked all the way. The prosciutto pizza was excellent, but a word of caution: it is difficult to eat and you will look like a fool trying to do so. But don't let that dissuade you from ordering it.", "author": "Meredith D."}

The best pizza of my life last year still prances around in my dreams...a place called Keste in NYC--they specialize in neapolitan style pizzas.  But this isn't about them.  It's just a preface.  As a result of that one fateful pie it's been a difficult journey back to the west coast where pizza is, at best, average.\n\nThank God someone brought us to Pizzeria Delfina.  The food was quite delicious, and it's certainly among some of the best pizza I've eaten in California. The tri-color salad was exceptional from its crispness, composition, and just the right amount of dressing.  The pizzas, well, let me just say.  I wasn't that hungry when we stopped in here, and neither was the rest of my party, but somehow we wound up ordering our own individual pizzas.  That was definitely the right move!  The pizzas all had really excellent flavors, although there was a lot of mess involved in their consumption.\n\nI hate waiting to eat at restaurants, and seldom have to back in Santa Cruz.  Had there been much of a wait, I might have reconsidered.  We were lucky to get seated almost immediately...and I'm spoiled.  Service was fine, if unremarkable. \n\nPrices?  They were ok too.  Not a steal, but not outrageous, either.\n\nMy only complaint, and hence the reduction of a star was how incredibly burnt the crusts were on our pizzas.  Now, if you're the kind of person who never eats pizza crust anyway (I don't really get that, but ok), then this doesn't really apply to you and we can all pretend I gave this joint 5 stars.  For the rest of you who like to eat their entire pizzas, I understand the need to fire these babies to perfection, but last time I checked charcoal wasn't on the ingredient list of any of these pizzas.  Right?\n\nOkay, so anyway, bottom line: eat here.  It's so good.", "author": "Daddy O."}

We waited... and waited... and waited... 80 min later, we were finally seated. I realize this is a popular joint, but 80 min? That's a bit ridiculous. At least we had time to discuss what we wanted to order...?\n\nWe settled on the fresh stretched mozzarella appetizer, and 3 pizzas: the margherita, prosciutto pie, and one of the daily specials. I think it was called gianci? Something with spring onions and fatty pork. \n\nAMBIANCE: loud hip hop music was played throughout the restaurant. It could've been turned down a notch as our group had a little difficulty hearing each other during some of the songs. The space is smallish, but has a cozy feel. The tables are a comfortable distance away from each other so that each group is distinct.\n\nSERVICE: Our waitress was friendly, but didn't check in on us very often. Despite receiving 2 bottles of water, they often went dry for long periods of time.\n\nFOOD: While the pizzas were good, they're weren't SPECTACULAR as so many people have said.\n- mozzarella: very fresh, paired perfectly with the crostini, olive oil and greens. Just wish there was more crostini!\n-Margherita: Yes, like everyone else has noted, the sauce was REALLY good. It was so fresh and bright, and the simplicity of the pizza really let the flavors shine. This was by far my favorite pizza of the night.\n- Prosciutto Pie: Good, but so difficult to eat. I felt like this was slightly bland because of the panna base (instead of tomato). The prosciutto was layered on top of the dough in large strips... it was extremely difficult to separate onto slices, and also to take individual bites of. \n- Daily special: Not special. I thought the flavors were super super bland. Nothing popped. This pizza had green onion on it, but I couldn't really taste the fresh, spring onion-y-ness. I wish we had ordered the Salsiccia instead.\n\nOVERALL: Pizzeria Delfina was good, but nothing I would go out of my way for. I can see how it could become a staple if I lived in the neighborhood and could just stroll on over whenever. If I do find myself here again, you can be sure it will only be with one other person instead of 4.

The cheese wasn't all that mouth watering either, and they put literally two pieces of basil on the whole pizza! Now they can't be that cheap.

We were seeing a show at the Fillmore so just happened in here looking for something fairly close to the theater to eat. The line was really long, especially for a Sunday night! You put your name on a chalkboard, and we got lucky, because a lot of the names ahead of ours hadn't bothered to stick around. So we got into eat fairly quickly (about 10minutes). It is a pretty small restaurant, and I felt a little cramped in the seating area. It also was pretty loud. The music was a bit too loud, and that caused the general din in the dining room to be kinda loud, but we were there to eat anyway! \n\nWe started with ciccoci (I'm butchering that spelling). It basically is cured pork jowel, that you spread on bruscetta. So porky, and delicious. A good app to split due to the richness of the dish. \n\nThey have several different pizzas to choose from and we ordered a pizza with guanciale, Romano cheese and 2 eggs on top. It was a bit spicy, but the warm runny egg yolk was absolutely delicious! The crust was thin, crispy, slightly charred around the edges, just the way I like it! They also had Peroni, my favorite Italian beer, on tap, which is really hard to find! Their menu changes slightly from day to day, and they have several \"daily special\" pizzas on the menu. \n\nTheir dessert menu isn't too special, but we did have a couple of scoops of gelati, which hits the spot after a spicy pizza pie. \n\nSince we were going to a show afterwards we didn't want to order 2 pizzas, so we just split one. We split an app, a pizza and a couple of scoops of gelati, and that was the perfect amount of food for me and my husband (he has a pretty healthy appetite!).

We made quick friends with the other ladies at the bar. So yes my voice was loud in order  to speak to my friends sitting 4 seats sway, and the other ladies sitting at the other end. The the waitress told us to be quiet and it totally put a damper to my mood and my experience. I was not maliciously trying to be loud, I was being friendly with the other patrons. I'm at a bar seat having a good  time until I was told to be quiet. From then on I felt uneasy unwanted and hated all the food. This is not a place to go if you want to be friendly with your neighbors. This is a place to eat, stay still and not be friendly because the hipsters feel like you're intruding on their environment because you're having a good time while their working. The meatballs are verrrry good. The pizza with anchovies can use more anchovies and less capers. The service sucks because they obviously want you to shut up and eat and get out. The manager told me we were annoying other customers, but I doubt that. The music was so loud of course I had to be louder than the music to speak to my friends.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-06-01", "description": "A-OK is the descriptor for 3 stars.  I'm giving it 3 stars but in this instance, that's not \"A-OK\".  Not even close.  Cannot go 2 stars because it's not \"bad\", but it is also not $30 for 2 pizzas.\n\nEDIT NOTE: I changed my mind, I'm going 2 stars.  Still good pizza, but they are selling \"the experience and novelty of good pizza in SF\" which should not be charged for IMO.\n\nI'm not going to turn this into \"East Coast/West Coast\" ala Biggie/Tupac.  But come on San Francisco.  Yes, we have great eats here (although recently I am definitely on a dead streak with the exception of Dosa) and yes our city is expensive for a lot (and some wrong) of the right reasons.  But pizza SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT be one of them.  There is not good pizza in this town.  There is only OK pizza across the board.\n\nSo Delfina steps in and does something good: They created decent \"fancy\" pizza in San Francisco.  But let's put things in perspective: You can eat on the water, at a nice restaurant (READ: nicer spot than what Delfina is trying to be), in Venice, Italy for cheaper than what you pay for an individual pizza at Delfina.  In Venice.  Italy.  I get that may come off as something other than \"cool\", but damn if it isn't 100% true.\n\nIf you want great pizza, go to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn Heights next time you are in NYC.  I guess to summarize this, I'm not going to get too many helpful recommendations with this review.  And I probably shouldn't unless you are comfortable with understanding my message and what I am trying to say here: That this is decent pizza that is expensive and IMO is more expensive than it should be.", "author": "Matt B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-11-21", "description": "I am a big fan of Italian style,  thin crust, wood fire pizzas. You can eat a whole one without feeling bogged down, a low-carb alternative to the traditional pizzas. Delfina is famous for these super thin crust pizza, so thin the pizza collapses if held by the crust. They have a great char to their crust and I have to say it is hard to find someone else that does it better. Toppings are very gourmet like prosciutto and basil that work very well with the rustic crust. \n\nHere's the dilemna:\n\nYou have to eat in and straight out of the oven or the pizza loses its structural composition once it cools. If you get take out, it also gets cold quick which makes it soggy and comparable tasting to the box it is in. This means you have to eat in and with the limited seating and massive crowd waiting for a table, you better be patient or you might want to head to Dino's next door. Factor in prices where you can get a couple large pizzas elsewhere for a personal size Delfina pizza (low carb also means less content) and it makes you think how much has to go your way to truly enjoy this place.", "author": "Ed L."}

The main thing I like about Pizzeria Delfina is that I really don't feel guilty eating there. Everything is very fresh and prepared in a healthy manner.\n\n I had an amazing citrus and fennel salad. The dressing was so simple...just olive oil which mixed with the natural juices from the citrus fruits in the salad...it was incredible!\n\nWe also had the broccoli rabe pizza...fabulous. The crust was perfect...not soggy at all inspite of the veggies. We also got a bowl of sauce to sop the crust. It was sooo good...and a HUGE bowl. Enough for leftovers for pasta at home. I had it with a sparking Lambrusco, which is now one of my favorite reasonably priced fun wines to drink casually. You can buy it at Traders Joes for $5 per bottle or another version at Whole Foods for $14 per bottle.\n\nI'm probably giving them 5 stars because I live in the burbs now and there just isn't anything remotely as good as Pizzeria Delfina anywhere near where I live.", "author": "susan c."}

But even at that early dinner hour the place had a 45 minute wait. \n\nBut to help ease your pain of waiting in the cold there is the option of buying a pitcher of beer or some wine to drink while you wait for a table. So that is a definite brilliant idea. \n\nWhen we finally got our table, everything just got better. Service was excellent and being outside with the heat lamps was just perfect. And of course the food was fantastic. We had the meatballs (5 perfectly cooked meatballs simmering in a tomato sauce that is perfectly seasoned!), and the fried pig ears to start off with. We ordered the pig ears assuming that since they were fried they would have to be good. I had envisioned ears coming out on a platter, fried up. But no, they sliced it up so thinly and then fried it so delicately, that you couldn't even tell what you were eating. If you hadn't heard us ordered them you would just think we had gotten some sort of fried heaven, maybe shoestring onion rings or something. And they tasted so yummy. \n\nThis is not to overshadow of course the pizzas itself. Any pizza you order here, you're going to love. The thinnest crust possible, freshest ingredients and each one tastes so great you cannot possibly choose a favorite. :) \n\nThe menu changes I think seasonally and even though there are tons of restaurants in San Francisco to choose from, make this one your regular spot!!! \n\nAlso the guy that was helping seat us was incredible, he kept on checking in and letting us know status, and squeezed us in the moment he had a chance to. He was part of what put us in such a great mood despite the long wait!", "author": "Denise B."}

I was happy with the pizza produced (had the salsiccia and prosciutto) so that is the reason for the 2 stars.\n\nOtherwise, the service was not good. Small seating area not good for groups. Had to wait awhile because we wanted a table and the table took way too long to simply get set. Our waitress seemed offended by some of the basic questions asked by our table and even went as far as saying \"this isn't that kind of place\" as a response. I don't care what kind of question is asked, a simple \"I apologize we don't have that here\" will suffice. We then asked about the coperto (extra service fee); I lived in Italy for awhile so I obviously know what a coperto is but had not seen it in SF restaurants and was interested. Again, seemed offended and gave an inflated response.\n\nI suggest getting take out of the pizza and sitting at the public tables across the sidewalk in the sun without the hassle of the service.", "author": "Adam Z."}

The crust is light and airy and the toppings are fresh and tasty. For instance, the Hand-Stretched Mozzarella is extremely fresh. The server explained that the cheese is made in-house, and you can definitely taste this in the quality. I enjoyed this appetizer, but I wish it was served with more crostini. \n\nThe pizzas are small, but large enough for two moderately hungry people if you eat the crust and order an appetizer. I went last night with a bunch of friends. I think there were 12 of us total and I saw a lot of leftover crust. I ate my crust, but the majority of my friends opted out of crust eating. I think this happens often. Perhaps Delfina should consider extending the toppings to the very edge of the pizza. This would prevent future generations of crust waste. Just a suggestion. \n\nDelfina's pizzas are on the gourmet end of the pizza spectrum. It's not greasy-lets-have-a-few-pitchers-and-some-meaty-saucy-pizza pizza. It's more delicate than that.

Since we were starving we decided to leave and I smiled and said thank you \"we are going to leave.\" He then responded with hella attitude saying he is giving us options and trying to help...blah blah I looked at him and said thank you fine we will stay but I was thrown off by his attitude and tone of voice. Didn't want spit or anything in my food so we decided to leave. It was mostly his stank attitude and tone of voice accompanied with my hunger that caused us to leave. I will honestly never come to eat here but I will probably continue to order to-go or just not do that at all.

Great place to bring friends, your significant other, a casual date, dinner with a parent or relative, its just awesome for so many occasions. Price-wise its pretty average. You can get a great meal for under $40 including a couple glasses of wine or beers. It's a bit loud but a fun vibe and I love that they make their own ice cream!! What a treat. \n\nMy suggestions for dinner are the Pizza Napoletana, the Meatballs, the Collard Greens, Fried Asparagus or Fried Mozzerella, and the Ice Cream. \n\nThere is always a wait (up to an hour) but you can drink while you wait ad it can be cramped inside but they have heaters on the outside and it's sortof nice to work up an appetite. Don't come here if you're starving because it'll be a while until you eat. It's for a more social occasion. \n\nI've never ordered take-out but thats something I have seen people do often. Great pizzas and salads and better quality than Dinos or Amicis, etc that deliver in the area. \n\nParking on California Street at night isn't too bad and there is a small, inexpensive outdoor garage across the street from Mollie Stone's that really close to the restaurant. \n\nI've been to Delfiina, the more upscale restaurant managed by the same people in the Mission. Pizzeria Delfina is MUCH better and less expensive. It's great if you're craving some gourmet pizzas or if you just want some casual Italian fare. I prefer this place to A16 or other similar Italian locations. Next time I am going to try a pasta dish!", "author": "Pilar P."}

The pizza with egg on it.... purgatorio, usually available upon request if its not on the menu.  \n\nThere's typically a long wait at the door but always a fun choice for when you're shopping or walking around the neighborhood.  The tripe appetizer with lemon, chives, and oil is a fresh twist on the otherwise unappealing and chewy piece of whatever part it comes out of a cow. They also have a great ginger ale to washdown the pizza.

A couple of slices of the 4 Formaggio hit the spot.  I think the pizza was hot and fresh when I picked it up, but since my long lost roommate and I had to do some major catching up on the phone, by the time I was ready to eat the pizza, it had cooled off; putting it in the oven didn't fully revive it, but I could tell that it was still better than the crappy places I had gotten pizza from in the rest of the city.\n\nOne added bonus---I get to pass by Pets Unlimited on my way there, and was lucky enough to make friends with a cute little dog!", "author": "Danielle B."}

That was an experience -- the entire kitchen is open, so it was interesting and educational to watch the workings of every order that came through.

Our drink order was taken immediately and service was attentive, if not doting, throughout the 3-course meal.  \n\nAll I can say is that the pizza is authentic and mouth-watering, with a thin yet crispy crust, succulent sauce and a mouth-warming smattering of fresh mozarella.  We were so convinced that, following the meal, we immediately order a salciccia (homemade sausage) pizza to go.\n\nA nightly special was the roasted brick-flattened half chicken.

We were seated soon enough and that experience made up for the unfortunate front of house experience.\n\nDeciding on wine would have been tricky, were it not for the Illuminati Montepulciano d'Abruzzo on the menu, which called out to me - and turned out to be rather tasty. \n\nOnce the wine was decided on, we ordered a fritte  and a salad. The arancini - saffron flavored balls of cheese and risotto were fried deliciousness. And a tasty heirloom tomato salad - it's tomato season, and these tomatoes lived it up.\n\nI wish I remembered more details on the pizza we ordered - it was a special and it was good, and that's about all I can say. The crust was warm, slightly crispy, slightly chewy, and tasty dipped in a bit of extra olive oil (do ask for this!). \n\nFor dessert we had the fried dough, which was light and crispy, and served with a marscapone pastry cream sauce which was a nice cooil counterpoint to the hot dough.\n\nSo, despite the rather unhappy start to the night, I was pleased with the overall experience and will go back (or order to go!)", "author": "neil c."}

It is a great tasting pie and easily worth the ten bucks.  I had the Broccoli Raab, which was tasty.  Thin crust but the outer ring is pleasantly doughy and charred nicely.  A decent size to eat all by yourself or share with someone.  \n\nOther menu items - Didn't try appetizers, salads or dessert, but will do so next time.  Mozzarella in Carozza looked amazing and gelato list was also intriguing.\n\nService - fast and friendly; the dining room is very small, but tables turned quickly, even on a holiday weekend.  Waited about ten minutes after putting our name on the board.  Our server recommended some off-menu special items, but if we hadn't asked, I'm not sure we would have learned about them.  Not an unusual practice, but one to be advised about.\n\nPrice - not bad; the simple pizzas start at 10 bucks; specialty pizzas are close to 20 bucks apiece, which seems bit pricey to me for a personal pie.  Worth it for a pizza splurge, though.  2 pizzas, 1 draft beer, 1 coffee was ~50 bucks which included 20% tip.  \n\nBottom line - This place gives me hope in my neverending quest for Bay Area pizza that doesn't suck.

The salad was actually quite good, but I came here for the pizza, which was just OK.  It had decent flavor, seemed like it was made from fresh ingredients, and the crust was fine, but nothing about it blew me away.\n\nI've definitely had better.

I will disclose up front that I am slightly more of a fan of Zero Zero, for a few reasons: the margherita pizza was better there, they had a great caesar salad (Delfina doesn't offer one), and the environment was more conducive to conversation. We came here based on the 7x7 recommendation for the margherita pizza so it was a little disappointing that it was somewhat flavorless and the cheese was a little chewy, not melt-in-your-mouth. But overall way better than average with great crust. I definitely recommend the sausage pizza. Our tri-color salad was pretty bad though. There was some sort of shaved bitter vegetable on top that was unedible. \n\nDefinitely very loud with the open kitchen and tables 6 inches apart. We would sometimes just sit there and listen in on the first date going on beside us. A little pricey, as we spent over $100 for a bottle of wine, 2 pizzas and a salad. Overall great place to venture to - be aware of no reservations, so put your name on the chalkboard and wait awkwardly in the entryway.", "author": "Natalie H."}

The sauce, however, was entirely too sweet and mixed with the bland fresh mozzarella made for an overall meh pizza. There was also little to no basil- maybe 2 pieces.

It was plenty to feed 5 hungry ladies before our happy hour escapades. While taste wise of both pies were perfectly balanced, especially the blending of the bitterness of the arugula and saltiness of the Prosciutto in the Proscuitto Pie, the crust on both pizzas were very burnt and I had to cut off a tumor-sized burnt bubble in one of the crusts. It was my first time eating at Delfina, so I'm not sure if that's normal but I feel crusts should never have multiple black burnt spots larger than a Sacagawea coin. \n\nAlthough I was disappointed by the crust, I was impressed with the little details that Delfina has to offer. They have these breadsticks that look like table decorations and a little plate of spices to sprinkle on your pizzas. The waitress also leaves the water in a tall narrow-neck clear bottle which was very cute.\n\nService-wise our waitress was immensely helpful in recommending wines even going as far as letting us sample some to make sure we are satisfied with our selection!

We ordered:\nMargherita pizza: the crust was thin, chewy, tough and lacked flavor.  The sauce was good but did not make up for the crust.  The cheese was very fresh and tasty.  It saddens me that so much amazing cheese is wasted daily on this pizza.\nDaily special: basically the Margherita pizza with an an egg on it. So... great cheese, chewy, flavorless crust, good sauce, and an egg. (it's hard to screw up an egg)\nFried chili lime pig ears: I was very excited about these after reading the reviews. Since I love pork rinds, I thought this would be a winner. They had a really nice flavor however, the texture was repulsive.  Yes, there were some yummy crispy pieces in there, but then, the chewy mouthfuls of soft fat in the shape of sliced pig ears really turned me off. I guess I should have seen that coming.\nOverall, this place invests in high quality food, but does not know how to cook it. This explains the high prices.

It was simple - not a ton of sauce, perfectly seasoned and a thin, tasty crust that is slightly burnt and chewy at the ends.

Love the fact that it's in my neighborhood, where the vibe is casual and unpretentious, but people still look like they took a little care before stepping out. In fact, I found it to be a cute date place (and would recommend it as such). There's a lot of energy in this smallish restaurant, activity from the wait staff (who were very friendly and efficient) and the chefs behind the open kitchen.\n\nWe were seated at the counter facing the wine so had privy to special views. Lots of wine from smaller name vineyards (at least lesser known to me) and I liked that. You could see sous chefs dipping bread in olive oil and grilling them, or plating pasta and salads.\n\nSince we came to the pizzeria, we had to have pizza of course. The Salsiccia ($15) called to me because of the sausage toppings. Served fresh and hot, the crust was on the thinner side with a nice crisp bottom, and some nice dough at the edges. Cheese was the right amount but the toppings of sausage and peppers were a little haphazard in placement so that slices didn't have fair distribution (making you vie for the loaded ones). \n\nAlso tried the Baked Ziti ($13) which is just long penne pasta with meat sauce, topped with cheese and sauce, then baked. It's a simple dish, and was tasty. I liked it but could see that the portion could be a little small if you were a bigger eater.\n\nSo overall, liked the ambience, the homey food, and the pleasant staff.

My server seemed to be M.I.A. for most of the time that I was there but the entire staff was super friendly and attentive. I had at least 3 different people check up on me, take my drink order, bring me the check, ect. so I can't complain and say that I was ignored or treated poorly. It was just weird that I never really saw the person that I ended up tipping. \n\nAs for the food, the panna pizza here was pretty much the same as the ones I've had at the Mission location but the crust was a little thicker and there was way more pepperoni (YES!!!). As much as I love Pizzeria Delfina in the Mission, this one is closer to my apartment and is just as yummy so I might be coming here from now on for my panna pizza fix!", "author": "Amanda R."}

The other time was with a party of 8 for a birthday dinner.\n\nI should preface that I just lived in NJ for the last 5 years and I've never had any pizza better than the thin crust at DeLorenzo's Tomato Pies (sorry NY - you don't even compare).  My boss (a NJ native) took me here since he said it's the closest he's found to pizza back there.\n\nThe time we went was this summer.  We shared the tricolore salad and each got our own pies.  I had a summer special that had ricotta and sliced cherry tomatoes on it.  It was AMAZING.  Not quite DeLorenzos, but good enough to not make me care.  The boss also let me in on the secret that you have to order the extra sauce on side (it really does take the pizza from very good to amazing).  \n\nThe second time we went back there was a much longer wait, but you can order wine inside and drink it out front while waiting, and one of the waitresses kept bringing out the breadsticks for us to munch on.  About 45 minutes later we were seated outside.  I must say, I preferred outside a great deal cause it's always SOOOO hot in there, and I'm the kind of person that's always cold.\n\nWe shared some tricolore salads and each had our own pizza.  I got the prosciutto pie, which wasn't great.  It just didn't have a lot of flavor (or sauce - it was kind of dry despite my drenching it with a side order) and I kind of wished I had tried something else.  Everyone else loved their pizzas (mainly margharita and salsiccia).\n\nI'll still be coming back though.  Service is always quick and friendly and the food comes out quick and is consistent.  Good wine list and beers to boot.  Not too pricey for the size of the pizzas and how tasty it is.  Just get there early since they won't take reservations.", "author": "Kirsten M."}

However, the mussels that we started with, along with the fried young favas, were utterly delicious!\n\nThe time before that  we had a so so Margaretia pizza, but a totally mouth watering appetizer of grilled fennel.\n\nWhen it's in season the roasted cauliflower with calabrian chilies is also a must order item.\n\nAnd as I said the pizzas are still pretty good themselves. Abby and I have especially enjoyed the Sausge pizza (the pig should be proud) and the Brocoli rabb pizza with toasted tomatoes. The only fault of them is that the crust can tend to be a bit too soft and floppy on the bottom, I like it a bit crispier down below.\n\nAdd to this that its always easy to grab a drink while you wait, the wine list is very affordably priced, and the fact that they have Sudwerk on tap, and you have your self a four star review!", "author": "Alex D."}

The one with the two eggs came out exactly as I had hoped for, but darn it I wish that for $15 that there was more to it. The Proscuitto was actually really good but became really salty and i wished they had better toppings to balance it out with. The calamari appetizer was also a fail.

Was never too loud and the bar seats offer a nice pre-meal ogling at the chefs preparing your starters.  Speaking of the bar seats... bravo on providing back support and hooks for your purses.  \n\nService was pretty shotty... we had a very late afternoon lunch where the dining room really wasn't that crowded.  Our wait staff was very flighty and never seemed to check on us.  We had to flag down others a few times. \n\nFor a starter we ordered a fried dough filled with mozz, sausage and something else.  The names on the menu will always require a translation so I forget what this dish was really called.  It came piping hot as 4 little dough balls on a bed of homemade marinara sauce.  Awesome.  Truly mouthwatering and worthy of a place in the entree section had the portion been doubled.  The mozzarella is fresh and rich as was the tomatoey marinara.  It wasn't greasy either... just nicely crisp.  \n\nFor the pizza we ordered the one with clams on top.  It sounded and looked great, until we popped it into our mouths.  Holy cow... salty enough to slightly burn my tongue raw.  What a huge disappointment.  The crust was paper thin, but got very dry when we came to the end piece.

Mainly because I'm lazy and it's in my hood, and because my ass was on the line as the first reviewer for this place. So this review is gonna be deeetailed. Get out the spreadsheet baby.\n\nLet's start with the food. The Tuna Conserva appetizer was a mixture of lightly poached tuna, silky extra-virgin olive oil and creamy cannellini beans beside a bed of watercress topped with a lemony tweeest. It was a pleasant blend of tuna & bean richness with an acidic watercress & dressing foil. I could've only liked it more if the tuna were raw and served with crisps rather than watercress.\n\nAdding more fiber to the meal we sampled the tricolore salad, a mixture of endives, greens and grana padano cheese. It was refreshingly bitter, lightly dressed with EVO and surprisingly complimented the tuna.\n\nNext we shared a sausage pizza. The crust was sooo thin, and crisped to perfection. I couldn't get over the sweet sauce with fresh mozzarella swimming in pools of tomatoey goodness and zingy fennel sausage. While in truth this sauce was a tad salty, it was tempting enough to drink like a soup. And how about that dough - crisp, crackly under the topping, bubbly and chewy at the end. Gimmie some more sauce to dunk that golden handle in, mmmm!\n\nFor dessert we sampled pear and caramel gelato. The pear was fragrant and deceptively sweet. The caramel didn't work so well, although it played games with my taste buds - for some reason it tasted like rootbeer float!\n\nI loved all the special touches to the restaurant. It felt unique and well designed. The old Zao's noodle felt awkward and cheap. They did a *great* job on the remodel. PD is warm, inviting with a mural of the Bay on the wall and elegant wood seating and tables. I know I'll come by to eat at the bar sometime soon. The chalk boards by the entrance are clever, and encourage diners to add their scrawl to the mix, keeping the waiting list and wine list clear for the day.\n\nThe service was full of smiles and attentive. Small touches like magically refilled water carafes and replaced dropped nakins made my night. The only hiccups were orders got mixed up a couple times - our tricolore salad almost ended up on another table, and we almost got someone's Spicy Cauliflower. Waiting for our check took a bit long too, but considering how packed it was getting around 7pm our servers were pretty efficient. It'd be nice if they turned down the music volume a bit - [John McCain voice] I'mmm getting old and crotchety!\n\nPer my last review, while I didn't end up slathering myself in sauce (even though the taste merits it) or running through the kitchen naked (I'm sure my restraint was appreciated), I can't wait to return again and again. For the quality of food at a fair price PD is a great value. I just wish they served tiramisu!\n\n4.5 * stars", "author": "Brady K."}

It tasted fresh made but satisfied like a good frozen pizza (if that actually exists).\n\nService was good which helped after the 50 min wait on a seemingly quiet Thursday night.  The cute presentation of the herbs is nice but not nearly enough for two, let alone four people.  They are quick to replenish supplies when asked.\n\nOn balance, it's not bad if there's no wait, otherwise I'd say skip it and get some good pizza elsewhere-- there's no lack of venues in SF for such.", "author": "Vinjah A."}

We shared the hot marinated olives, which were highly recommended by my buddy Sheila who was there the previous week..  They were great and so was the house salad.  We loved the broccoli rabi and prosciutto pizzas.  It's not thin crust but they are very good.\n\nI am not sure I like the chalk board and having to wait for a table.

My friends and family have been raving about the crust, saying it's one of the best in the city. Well, I tried it today and do not agree. At all.\n\nSERVICE - (2 Stars) It all started off great. We arrived for lunch within a few minutes of opening, were greated by a friendly smile and professional attitude, and promptly seated near the kitchen. Once seated, we were serviced promptly and advised of the special and also a modification to the daily menu. A few minutes later, we placed our order for our salad, two pizzas (pies), and two beverages. About five minutes later, we received our salad. After we finished our shared salad (which took about 6 minutes), the salad serving plate was cleared. But this is when the service started to turn... We had noticed that the table next to us (who had been seated after us, and had their order taken just before ours), had already received their pie, eaten what they could (at a leisurely, Fillmore-District-pace), and had their leftover piece boxed up; Before one of our pies was delivered to our table.\n\nPies were flying out of the kitchen. I appreciate their team delivery service. The chef yells \"RUNNER\" and one of the servers acknowledges for presentation to the table.\n\nIt was over 15 minutes from the time our salad was cleared until our first pie arrived. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it does not take more than 10 minutes to bake a Delfina pie. I will admit that one of my pies had sausage and I will give them the benefit of doubt that it takes longer to bake a pie with (raw?) sausage, but I don't know if they use raw sausage for their pies. But the other pie had prosciutto. I watched them make it... and that one should not have taken any longer than a meatless pie.\n\nWhat they should have done was managed my expectations better. They should have advised us when our pies would be at our table, sooner than when they did. (Our server actually said to us that our pies would be out in \"two minutes\", after we had already waited over 10 minutes; but the pies did not arrive in two minutes). Advice to all restaurants... NEVER LEAVE A PATRON WONDERING WHEN THE NEXT EVENT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.\n\nAMBIANCE - (4 Stars) I had a great feeling walking towards our table. It was a fresh, open-air dining area and the kitchen and prep areas were open to people walking towards the back/restrooms. Cool UK alternative music was playing on the audio system and a wide range of customers filled the area with excitement. Our table was clean and presented in a minimalist, yet functional arrangement, complete with tasty breadsticks.\n\nFOOD - (2 Stars) This is where I wish I could give a higher rating. We started off with a \"gem?\" salad that consisted of romaine hearts and avocado. The dressing was very tasty and had a hint tarragon? I would eat a gigantic bowl of this salad if it were given to me. Then we had the prosciutto pie and also the salsiccia pie. My first bites of both of these pies TASTED AMAZING. But that's where the \"amazing\" stopped. I ended up eating 5 slices of pie within 10 minutes. Each bite was less enjoyable than the previous, because the pie crust was getting more chewy. By the time I had my last bite, my jaws were really tired. It still tasted good. It was still hot. But the texture just killed the enjoyment.\n\nVALUE - (1 Star) What does $70 get you for lunch for two? Breadsticks, two pies, a salad, a hot tea, a soft drink, and a pile of disappointment. I can get over the chewy crust and give it another shot. But waiting and waiting for food, when others are served quickly really kills it for me.", "author": "Ray C."}

I know, the horror. I'm correcting that now.\n\nTonight was a reminder that a healthy yelper can go too far in his or her quest to be healthy. Sometimes you just have to let it go, and enjoy all that the chef intended to be on your plate.\n\nMuch to my delight, my dining partner so loved his first time here earlier in the week that he wanted to order the exact same thing - splitting the lemon-infused salad and a prosciutto pizza. My first thought was, well, not a big ham eater, but breaking the routine is good, and as usual, I'd have my half without cheese.\n\nThat last part was met with a slightly puzzled look on the waiter, who had to double check if this was even doable. He came back saying it was not, which typically means a few less stars on the review. But with my friend effusing how awesome it was, and me still in a celebratory mood from a four hour dance fest the night before, I said what the heck, let's do it.\n\nIt turned out to be a wise, wise choice. What an amazing pizza. We scarfed down the three slices each in no time, and the mix of prosciutto and cheese on what might be the world's best crust was indelible. Two hours later, all I can think about is how I want another round.\n\nA few nice extras - the skinny breadsticks are perfect for munching, and the heat lamps made eating outside on a February night a reality.\n\nAnd do save room for dessert - the house gelato was marvelous, and I think our choice of chocolate and caramel paired well.\n\nPizza Delfina is right up there as one of the best pizzas I've ever had.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-22", "description": "A few weeks ago, I had a chance to try Pizzeria Delfina.  After hearing rave reviews from friends, I expected big things from the pizza.  The pizza was certainly good but the cheese and sauce was not as flavorful as my favorite pizza place in the city, Pazzia.  If you like a doughy crust, you might love the crust at Pizzeria Delfina but I prefer a crunchier crust.  There were also a few inexcusable flaws with the pizza that made me want to give the pizza an overall rating of  a two, but that would be too harsh.  The pizza was served warm and not hot.  Also, the pizza was burnt, so it shouldn't have been served to the customer.  I was attending a concert after dinner, so I didn't want to send it back.\n\nIf the pizza was served hot and not burnt, the pizza might be more like a 4 rating, but it's just hard to fairly judge a warm burnt pizza.", "author": "Josh K."}

Although bigger than the location on 18th, this Delfina isn't big enough to accommodate that many hungry diners. Four of us got to the restaurant a little after five. If we had arrived any later, we would have had to wait. Sure, the waiting list is super cute where you write your name on a giant chalkboard that also serves as the drinks menu on the wall near the entrance. But judging from how large that chalkboard is, and how cramped the little entrance is when you stuff 20 adults and kids there, it's really more fun to sit at a table than to wait. \n\nBeing in an adventurous mood, and really a dangerous one, we ordered the Clam Pie and the special Winter Chicories pizza. Clam Pie was very very salty and spicy. You won't even notice or care how many clams were on the pizza at this point. All you can think is what in the world am I eating? \n\nWinter Chicories, a slightly bitter green, felt like lettuce in texture, kinda slimy and slides off the thin pizza as you bite into it. Not a pretty scene. Glad I wasn't on a date. The sunny side up eggs were good, but the whole thing is just, strange. Perhaps a bit too avant garde for my taste. \n\nFortunately we also ordered two good dishes. 4 Formaggi, which I have had at the 18th St location, is delicious as ever. We probably should have just ordered three of those. And the special calamari and chickpeas salad dripping with olive oil is quite tasty. \n\nWaitress very knowledgeable about wine, and service was efficient. \n\nThere were surprisingly a lot of kids there. I can go on and on about \"when I was 5, going out for pizza meant Round Table and not posh Delfina\". But we are talking about food here, plus I am really not that old.

I'd only been 1 time before that and thought the pizza was sub-par and frankly too flimsy, but given the reviews and consistent crowds outside I figured I'd give it another shot. To start off, they erased our name from the self-service chalkboard so we sat outside for almost 2 hours until I noticed that they were seating people that had shown up after we had. When I approached the hostess after I figured this out, she unapologetically and rudely responded with \"I didn't erase your name but I'll get you a table after I sit this party.\" SERIOUSLY? If that's your method of tracking your wait list, stay on top of it or take responsibility when you mess up. And the fact she made us wait until the next table opened instead of sitting us before the party she had is absurd. When we did get sat, our waiter was hardly concerned we'd been overseen and it took a good 7 mins for him to even take our order, mostly because he was socializing with his friends that were seated at the table next to us (this went on all night).  We ordered a pizza, mussels and the romaine salad. I asked if we could have the lemon salad dressing instead of the green goddess dressing that usually comes on the salad - simple request in my opinion - and our waiter responded that the kitchen really doesn't like to make substituions. Again, SERIOUSLY? Unless they pre-dress their salad (which would be gross), I can't imagine why this was such a difficult thing to accommodate. So we went with the salad that came with the lemon dressing, which was good, but then they dropped off our pizza (literally - didn't even stop to check if we needed anything) and didn't give us new plates. For a place that charges $16 for a pizza that barely feeds 2 people you'd think they'd give you new plates before they served your main entree. Our waiter then completely forgot our mussels and never came back to ask how things were. So my mom had to get up and go ask another waiter where they were. They arrived a couple minutes later (no apology) and had hardly any broth so many were dried out. To top all of this off, they started playing gangster rap over the loud speaker!!! My mom ended up complaining to the manager, who really was the only saving grace in the entire situation and was extremely sweet. She gave us some extra wine and a dessert on the house and comped our mussels. Still, after tax and the comped mussels, our meal was $90. It was a disaster and I wil never go back.

Off the bat, I was feeling the vibe and look of the place. Not to sound like I know anything about NYC, but it definitely reminded me of places in SOHO. Contemporary interior, hipster servers and \"comfort\" foods priced just high enough to make you think \"crap, i hope they take credit.\"\n\nThe menu is fairly straight forward although the pizza's aren't as down-home and hearty as I had imagined. As expected, all the menu descriptions were SF-sized with a range of cheeses, italian meats and obscure vegetables that I can't pronounce. Their salads were also just as out there. In the end, we tried the tuna salad and the sausage pizza (no idea what the real names were for either). The salad was overly deconstructed (thanks Top Chef for adding to the vocab) but still tasty. The pizza was also pretty good. Thin crust but deceptively filling and good enough for two. \n\nOverall, the food and service are great and, minus the $50 tab at the end, its definitely one of those places to add to the repeat visit list. Important to know (and not so obvious for first timers) the waits are long and the sign-in list is maintained on the chalk board. Ignore the people standing at the door and head straight to the board so you don't get dicked over while waiting. Also, gentleman please be careful leaving the bathroom.

I just love the vibe in this area of town.\n\nI have never been to Delfina in the Mission but my girlfriend assured me the pizza is amazing... so true.\n\nWe got there around 6:30 and put our name on the list.  Noticed that most of the tables are two tops so we had to wait an extra long time (20-25 minutes or so) for one of the 2 (I think) booths that are available.  I guess this is more of a \"date night\" place perhaps?  Strange cause I did see a lot of kiddies around.\n\nWe finally got seated and I looked over the wine menu -- it was chock full of exotic sounding Italian wines... as a California wine gal, I only recognized one, the sangiovese!  So, I ordered it and it was perfectly juicy & yummy.  We ordered the olives & the blood orange salad to start.  I have never had olives served warm, but I approve!  They were tasty.  The blood orange salad was small, but a nice taster for the 3 of us.  I do wish they had more salad choices... perhaps a chopped salad? \n\nWe ordered the special pizza of the day which included some kind of pork (the server said it was pork \"jaw\"), shallots, and I can't remember what else but it was delicious.  We also ordered the broccoli raab pizza with olives... cheesy goodness!  We could have easily ordered only one pizza and been fine to share, but it was fun to have leftovers.  I am a fan of the flatbread style pizza - they do a great job of making the crust perfect -- flat style, but substantial enough to feel like you are getting a meal, not just ingredients on a cracker.

One salad on a small oval plate, with three matching plates to serve on.  Our pizza arrived, apparently also to be eaten on the small plates delivered with the salad.  The mussels special was brought to the table as almost an afterthought, with barely any broth -- had they been reheated under the salamander?  Again, luckily we had the small plates to serve the mussels on.\n\nIt seemed like a good idea to have a word with the manager.  She was lovely, and apologetic.

If you ask for more, they return with a tiny dish of a similar amount of pepper. And if you ask again, they again return with the same amount of pepper. And so on.

We both had to try the blood orange mimosas too!\n\nThe salad was a good choice to balance out the heaviness of the other two dishes but all in all, I don't think it was worth $8.50.  The margherita pizza was also a little disappointing personally because the whole pizza had maybe 4 pieces of basil in it.  I loooove basil and I loooove it when they pile it on.  Maybe it isn't authentic and that's why they don't add more but maybe it's they're own thing.  There's a little dish on each table where you can add some dried basil (plus the stick pieces), pepper flakes and I think parm.  Dried basil to me just isn't the same but I threw it on anyways.  Now, on to the star dish of the night.  The dun dun dun, MEATBALLS!  These balls were delicious!  haha!  They came in a small casserole like dish swimming in some tomato sauce and two pieces of butter soaked toast.  We polished that off!

I knew we were at a pizza place and there were a lot of people who looked very \"Thursday night ready\" (quite a contrast to my \"Post-Yoga Sleepy\").

My husband did not enjoy his prosciutto as much, but that just seemed like an inferior order to me anyway...\n\nLove the bottomless breadsticks, the friendly waitstaff, the casual chic space, and the nice wine list.

He's always talking about how good they are and I always ask him if he's found one. So he finally takes me to this joint on California Street. We go there on a Friday in the early evening around 6p. Folks are already getting their dinner on by then so we were asked if we would like to sit at the counter. We want a booth so we waited for about 15 minutes as the chalkboard sign-up was getting longer and longer after our name. As soon we're seated we order a Salsiccia (housemade fennel sausage, tomato, bell peppers, onions and mozarella) and a Margherita (tomato, fior di latte mozarella, and basi). Since the joint was a bit busy the pizzas took about 20 minutes and they got to our table separately.\n\nOverall, it was okay. A bit on the bougie side for me. A bit pricey but the service was good.

Everything was fresh but I would rather go to Pizzaiolo, which is much closer to me, for this type of pizza.\n\nFirst warning - this place is better suite for groups of 2 -4 people.  Ideally 4 so you can order a couple of pizzas to share...we had a group of 5 and had to wait nearly 2 hours.  That being said, the 2 top tables (put 2 together for the 4 top) are so small it makes getting any more than 1 pizza with water glasses and 1 wine glass on the table.  If you want to minimize the wait (at least on a Sunday evening) go around 8 pm - the wait was very short at that point.\n\nNow on to the experience/food - after being seated, we ordered the insalata tricolore (radicchio, endive and one other bitter green w/ lemon vinaigrette), meatballs in sugo, sausage pizza, funghi pizza and  prosciutto pizza.  The meatball dish was an appetizer so we assumed the salad would come, followed by the meatballs, then by the pizzas.\n\nWell the salads came (we ordered 2) and we split them up.  The 3 bitter greens together were very fresh but too bitter.  Even the acid and citrus from the vinaigrette couldn't offset the overly bitter quality.  We did finish the greens and just as we finished...the meatballs arrived and all 3 pizzas.  No room for all 3 - we all had 1 wine glass apiece.  Fortunately (or unfortunately) the prosciutto pizza was not pre sliced so we had to send it back which gave us a couple of minutes to wolf down a slice and consolidate the remaining funghi and sausage slices on one pie tin.  \n\nAs for the pizzas - the housemade fennel sausage/red onion pizza was the favorite on the table.  Best balance of ingredients, the sausage was tasty, the pie could have been cooked just a minute longer but a nice crispness nonetheless.\n\nThe prosciutto pie, interestingly enough had large pieces of prosciutto and large arugula (not baby arugula) which made it difficult to take a bite without all of the arugula and prosciutto coming off...also the prosciutto was not very crispy on the pizza and extremely salty - and I am a salt aholic.  The last was the funghi - mushroom/white sauce - pizza.  I loved it but was in the minority at the table.  Most found it just too rich.\n\nThe star of the show was the meatball appetizer - rich sugo, tasty meatballs...we should have ordered 2.\n\nThe wine list was found and had many interesting regional Italian wines.  We ordered 2 under $50, both were very tasty and went well with the food.  interestingly, one of the bottles came out room temperature (read too warm), while the other came out cool to the touch as if it had actually been stored in a wine cabinet (read mid 60's).\n\nService was personable, knowledgeable and professional despite the rush to get food on the table - although I suspect that is more the kitchen's fault than our servers.  \n\nProbably won't go back unless we order to go...much prefer Pizziaolo, Pizzeria Picco and Dopo for this type of pizza.", "author": "Tony V."}

I did appreciate being able to dive right in and put our name up on a chalk board rather than push through people to find a hostess.  I knew that we'd be facing a wait, though time flew as we sipped our wine on the sidewalk.

I found parking quickly and less than half a block away and the wait was only five minutes on a Sunday night at 6pm.  The menu here is a little more extensive than the pizzeria in the Mission.  We started off with the small Affettati (charcuteries) plate and the Hearts of Romaine with Green Goddess Dressing and Hazelnuts salad.  The Affettati plate (despite the cool name) was just a selection of cured meats, good, but nothing you can't get at a good grocery store.  The salad though was delicious.  I never thought avocado dressing could be so good and the use of hazelnuts is so perfect.  I'd order it again without hesitation.  \n\nWe had our standard Margherita pizza with Bubalis Mozzarella di Bufala.  Perfectly salty and olive oil drenched as usual.  For something new we tried the Neapolitan Meatballs in Sugo which arrived bubbling hot!  The meatballs were delicious nearly melted in the mouth.  The sauce was also perfect to dip the crust of the pizza in.\n\nTo finish we had a scoop of the Strawberry and Chocolate Gelato and coffee.  Hoi was extra happy about the lattee served in a tall glass cup instead of a mug or bowl.  Good simple stuff to end the meal with.", "author": "Edgar C."}

It's double the size of the Mission restaurant but we still waited nearly 30 minutes for a table at 8 pm on the Saturday after it opened in Pacific Heights. We did notice that if you held off till 9 pm, people were seated wait free.\n\nWe scored a booth and started off with a delectable, lightly fried mozzarella  and anchovy sauce appetizer before devouring the broccoli raab pizza [broccoli raab, ricotta, oven-dried tomatoes and mozzarella] and the 4 Formaggi [Mozzarella, fontal, provolone and pecorino] both of which stayed true to the PD tradition of delicate, flavorful thin-crust pizza with plenty of leftovers for the next day.\n\nThe service was attentive and friendly, happy hipsters flooded all the tables, and the food was great. (Though I have to admit I think their bursting-with-flavor appetizers outrank the pizza.)\n\nWe're thrilled to have Pizzeria Delfina open three blocks from our apartment - this will be our regular pizza haunt from now on!", "author": "Sharand N."}

EVERYTHING was uber delicious! I just love their red sauce in the meatballs.. the meatballs were super tender, moist, flavorful, pizza was just yummm! I wanted more! The mussels were yummy, but I was expecting more of a garlic flavor, however, the broth had sliced jalepenos! yum! the broth isn't spicy/hot unless u take in a jalepeno. The escarole salad was tasty however, it was lacking something... it was dressed in lightly but a little to salty, definitely not bland. I wasn't ever a big fan of canelones, don't know why, but I did enjoy Defina's canelones, the cheese was stringy, cheesy, and the pasta was delicate yet still had a bite to it. \n\nI wasn't fabbed by the waitress only b/c my friends and I did most of the work there.

The pizza had 2 pieces on it. And I am not exaggerating (usually I do exaggerate, but not this time). And the basil tasted a little weird, In fact we don't think it was basil at all. It kinda tasted like what one would smell walking through hippy hill in the park. Hmmmmm.....It was very strange. Is the pizza made in a smoke fired oven?\nThe also was not much cheese on it and the mozzarella that was on it, was not really melted. But overall, it was not bad.

Immediate seating for 2 on a weeknight.\n* Very helpful order taker guy. I didn't study Italian, I had no idea what the fried things were. he listened to what we didn't know, and educated us, vs those waiters that assume we have 0 idea about everything and start launching into a canned speech about \"this Italian wine comes from the blah blah blah region\"\n* Fresh ingredients (which better be a default)\n* Bright, clean surroundings\n* Crisy bottom crust\n\nCons:\n* LOUD music, which when combined with the clean colors gave the atmosphere a college dining hall aspect. Very hard to talk to my date.\n* Too much edge crust! I know this is very subjective but it was almost like an extra set of breadsticks. I should've asked for some balsamic vinegar & olive oil for dipping those chubby edges.\n* PUSHY WAITRESS. At first we just thought she was eager & perky (ahhh, youth). But when the following 3 things happened (and there were no other parties waiting for a table), she passed over to the pushy side. (Note, she was not our original order taker, who somehow vanished.)\na) We were not done eating, had some slices on the main serving plate, and she asked if we wanted it boxed up. (Nope, thanks, still eating.)\nb) Another 'how's everything?\" check in while we were eating said slices.\nc) I was still eating my last slice (my date had finished), and she literally took my plate out from under me and cleared the table. WTF?\nd) No mention of dessert, and then the bill. Again, no one was in line. (Is she working on some sort of \"# of turns per hour\" commission???)\n\nHell, I don't mind getting pushed out of my table at a divey Chinese restaurant...but I'm not paying to be treated well and a waitress at a dive isn't trying to be perky, either. \n\nBut here, I paid a lot more than a cheap Asian dive (and they add $1.75 per person for the SF employee cost), and in other cases it'd be comical.

My personal favorite is the one off-the-menu they call \"magic pie.\"  Ask for it.  It's amazing.  The only annoying thing is that just like any other great restaurant in the city, wait is long and they take no reservations, but the wait time at this location is usually shorter than the mission location, parking's easier, and food's just as tasty.

Perfect thin and tender crust, fresh home-made mozzarella (stretched on site).  Delish!  Even the soda was fabulous.  Home-made and freshly squeezed juice with sparkling water in a carafe for only $3!  Bargain.  I think we both made it out of there for ~$20 each and had a fabulous meal.  I love SF!

What tasty little morsels they are!\n\nI can't leave out the delightful limonciata, which is made to order. It's perfectly sweet and tart, and arrives in an individual carafe.  So refreshing!\n\nWord of caution: Unless you visit during off hours (not sure when that is), don't come to Pizzeria Delfina if you're absolutely famished and must eat right away.

Headed out on a Tuesday night and there was a line and about a 45 minute wait.  Thankfully my friends and i were patient but we still didn't sit down to eat until 9pm.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful.  All her recommendations we tried and were not dissapointed.  Salad with shaved tuna hearts, FANTASTIC!  I could have eaten the whole plate myself.  Deep fried sand dabs were moist and crisp and the crispy parsley was a nice treat.  The aioli that accompanied it was like butter, mmm.... :) I would have preferred larger portions for the prices we paid for those two items.  $10 for 4 small fish pieces?  8 would have been better considering they were the size of my finger.  Onto the pizza: Calzone special with Salami, ehhhh...not a fan.  too juicy and would have preferred the salami to have been seared or crisped instead of steam cooked inside.  Margarita pizza was our favorite.  Perfect balance of thin crust, sauce and cheese.  Sausage pizza was good as well but the Margarita was the best.  And the piece de resistance...the dessert...Zeppole di San Giuseppe...fried pizza dough.  It was described to us as an italian funnel cake, and did not dissapoint.  Save room for it, its TOTALLy worth it.  And this is coming from a non dessert eater.  Overall i really liked this place and will definitely come back, minus one star for the line (not really a bad thing) and the price to food ratio (give us a little more for that price, not much, but a little bit bigger portion please, lettuce is cheap).", "author": "Susan Z."}

We also ordered a tricolor salad with raddichio, shaved cheese and greens topped with a light olive oil dressing.  The sausage pizza was plentiful with roasted red peppers, tomato sauce and spices plus the requisite cheese.  We didn't feel rushed even though the place was humming with business.   The selection of wines mostly were from Italy.  Our waitress recommended a great red and proseco.   The water bottle was refilled without asking.  The one challenge at Delfina's is the noise level can tax conversation and the house rock music that blasts out of a speaker over the entry grew annoying while we waited to be seated.

I was so excited to check out the new Pac Heights location. I'm very sad to report that the food was not good. I ordered the funghi pizza (it was a special) and it was almost uneatable. The crust was so thin and completely undercooked. When I picked up a piece, it literally fell apart. The crust was doughy and there was barely any cheese on top. but the cheese that was on it, was almost a liquid and slid off. In addition, the pizza had 0 flavor. A Tostino's frozen pizza or even Domino's (which I think is gross) would have been 100X better. They need to fully cook the pizza, add enough cheese to actually cover the pizza, which will hopefully give it some flavor. \n\nI asked the waitress for wine suggestions. I requested something smoky and earthy, not sweet. She brought a sweet, fruit forward option 1st and then brought over 2 more tastes of wine either worse or the same as the first. I was going to go with the lesser of 2 evils, when the waitress finally asked someone who knew wines and she brought out a perfect red. Management definitely needs to have a wine tasting event for their staff to familiarize them with the wine menu. \n\nI'm going to give it another chance in a few months and hope this experience was just a start-up hiccup. I would definitely wait until the buzz wears off to try this place out bc it is definitely not worth the wait. I left the restaurant and went across the street to eat afterwards.", "author": "Sally F."}

The atmosphere at Pizzeria Delfina on California could not be more different than the 18th street location. It's louder, larger, a different crowd, but the same great food. Service was attentive, with excellent wine suggestions. My only complaint is that a host should be keeping an eye on the folks awaiting a table. We were seated at a cozy spot directly on the opposite side of the partition wall separating the waiting patronage, ending directly at the intersection where patrons enter and exit (in fact, sticking into it a bit even). With a table situation right there, it's pretty annoying to have wait list folks nearly leaning on your back while you attempt to enjoy your food. It's also hard when their elbows are leaning next to your temple, and their glass of wine is dangerously close to the edge of the partition, right above your lap. On the other hand, the guy who was on the other side of the partition who decided to lean over, staring as us and the rest of the dining crowd like the captain of a sea vessel, literally less than six inches directly next to me, was charming as all get out.

If I didn't know it was opening night (and mind you, we came towards the end of the night when the staff might otherwise be plum tuckered out) I would never know it- that is just how smooth everything was. \n\nI appreciate the range of wines made available by the glass. While waiting for our table, the hostess suggested a wine which (bonus points) was very reasonably priced at $6.50 per glass and was super tasty. My dining mate ordered some antipasti while I was trying to decide which of the tasty sounding pizza's to order. We ended up with a tomato salad and a roasted pepper with tuna dish. Both were yummy, the red peppers with tuna was very memorable. In fact, I would go back just for that antipasti dish! I finally settled on a broccoli rabe pizza. It was a white pizza (which, had I paid more attention to the description I might have realized) without tomato sauce. Just for kicks, we asked for a side of tomato sauce. Our cheerful waitress simply brought us some with zero questioning or explanation that our pizza was in fact meant to have no sauce. Turns out they were right and the pizza is much better without the sauce, but it was still great for dipping the thin-and-bubbly-crispy-on-the- outside-whilst-perfectly-chewy-inside crust. \n\nFinally, despite a full belly, we had to at least try the home made gellato. I liked that the stawberry tasted very much like fresh fruit, not just overpowered by creaminess and sweetness of the dessert. \n\nI will definitely be back here and often. Love the decor, friendly people, the food, the wine selection, and the price point. My only concern is that this spot will always be so busy that I will never be able to get a table for myself! \n\nPS: This is one of those restaurants which does not accept reservations, so just be prepared for that. I personally don't think this is too big a deal as long as you're prepared. Hopefully, you'll bring good company along to chat with while waiting and enjoying a glass of wine, but if not, I wouldn't be surprised if the rest of the folks waiting with wine make for some friendly conversation as well.", "author": "Jennifer E."}

But I do not think the ice cream is special as well as the wine list. They used to have better wine. And last night, I asked for a bottle of San Giovese and they took me another wine claimed that was similar. But it was bad and very far to be similar to a san giovese. Honestly the service in Delfina (in Mission) is much better and if they do not have another one but ask if you want try a different one. Anyway, if you want a good italian pizza, delfina is the the plave where to go.", "author": "Antonino S."}

The first time I got the basic margherita pizza which I've had at the Mission location and liked. i can't get much else bc I don't eat pork. Anyway, our pizza did not have enough cheese. The table next to us got the same pizza with twice as much cheese.  I feel like maybe there should be some standardization of this.The second time I got the tuna salad for a light lunch. It was swimming in oil...so much so that I couldn't finish it and I normally like greasy food (see not enough cheese comment above). I think the $1.25 charge per person really adds up (especially during lunch). I would prefer that they just raise their prices slightly on some stuff or make the charge a percentage of your bill but when I'm getting a $10 salad and then you add the 10%  health care cost plus 20% tip it just starts to get ridiculous. I will say that the service at this location is much better than the mission location with the rude and moody hipsters serving you. I hope that last phrase makes it on a t-shirt. I think Delfina can be really good but sometimes they just drop the ball.", "author": "mazzy s."}

It was amazing to see a line out the door and at least a 40 minute wait by 6:30pm.  The bread sticks waiting for you are absolutely wonderful, and it's damn near impossible to stop eating them until your pizza arrives.  We sat at the counter, and it was fun to see the pizzas being made.  Although we didn't have salads, I noticed they top them with huge parmesan shavings.  The salsiccia pizza was great...light thin crust, a tangy yet sweet tomato sauce, and perfect dollops of mozzarella.  Oh yeah, and the swine, too.  My friend had the Margherita pizza, and that too, despite its simplicity, looked fantastic.  As if each of us inhaling our own pizza wasn't enough, we split a dessert consisting of fried pizza dough, dusted in powdered sugar, and then drizzled with sweet mascarpone...call it an expensive version of elephant ears at a county fair.\n\nAll in all, delicious.  The only thing I'm wondering is: when is Dino going to come over and punch out Delfina's owners for taking all of his business away?", "author": "Ilan K."}

You can eat a whole one and not feel sick and full like after a few slices of other pizzas. My favorite is the broccoli raab pizza. I am not usually a fan of white pizzas or pizza without red sauce, but this one has just a light layer of cream, and it is the perfect match for the broccoli and black olives. Very tasty. The margarita is also excellent, as is the prosciutto pie. My husband really likes the clam pizza as well. Sounds weird, but he says it's good. \nThe salads are really good, but I think they are overpriced. I'm willing to pay the price for the pies, but I usually opt out on the salads unless I'm dining in. I do usually always go for the daily greens though. Always yummy.\nIn my opinion, go for lunch at an off time or order out. It's insane there during dinner hours, and it's so small, you can easily feel cramped.", "author": "Jaime S."}

I have found Pizzeria Delfina to be close to the type of pizza that I enjoy.  Apparently, Little Star is fantastic for their deep dish pizza.  But here, at Delfina, I believe most of their pizzas are thin (or thinner) crust.  Pizzeria Delfina is popular for their Margherita pizza, but I usually like more toppings so I first tried their Salsiccia pizza (housemade fennel sausage, tomato, bell peppers, onions and mozzarella) - it was pretty good.  But on my second visit, I tried their Panna Pizza (tomato sauce, cream, basil, shaved parmigiano) with sausage.  The shaved parmigiano on this pizza makes a big difference - for cheese lovers, this is a great touch.  I recommend the Panna Pizza with your favorite topping(s).  I also tried their Grilled Asparagus (w/ lardo butter and breadcrumbs and bacon) and their Amarena Cherry Sundae (Vanilla gelato, chocolate sauce, pistachio, and whipped cream) - not a big sweets guy, but the cherry sundae was pretty awesome.  4 stars.", "author": "Mark K."}

When he took our order, he didn't provide any explanations when we clearly were confused about certain things....when we asked if he thought we had ordered enough for four, he just said \"no\" and didnt offer any suggestions and became impatient while we tried to figure out what else to order....there were a few more instances of his crappy attitude and rudeness that night, but I want to keep this review short.\nDespite the waiter, the food was excellent, which is the most important thing....so Id definitely be back, although i'd probably ask for a different waiter if i got the same dude.", "author": "Rachell K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-12-08", "description": "I heard great things about this pizza, but when the box came home, and the lid was opened, I was in shock.  CRUST EVERYWHERE.  The 2 or 3 bites you get of the good stuff per-slice are okay, but man o man, most of the slice--most of the pizza---was crust.  My girlfriend, a fan (but admitted to the over-abundance of the outer pizza regions)  likes the sauce they use on the pizza...and she likes the salady-concept they have come up for a pizza (she defends this pie, it should be known).  But I much prefer when she makes her version of it, because you actually get to bite into something--there is more topping and hers has much more taste (yes, I am a lucky man).  The Delfina MIGHTY crust, by the way, is very good as a dog treat.  Let it stand for about a day, and then it is better then a bone for your furry friend.  It is actually the best feature of an otherwise underwhelming experience.  For thin slice pizza, Gaspares or Georgios might not be as trendy...but are their pies ever better.  Trend versus pie...you make the call.", "author": "David K."}
