My party of 4 was seated right away, and were served food immediately -- this restaurant isn't cart style, but \"tray style\" (waiters come around with trays of dim sum). However, when we left around 11:30, the restaurant was about 80% full.\n\nOut of everything we tried, the char siu cherng fun was my favorite, along with the lo mai gai (sticky rice in lotus leaf, though it didn't have enough meat and other fillings inside). They also had xiao long bao dumplings, which were pretty good too but lacked a good amount of soup in some of the dumplings.\n\nOverall, service was quick, food was better than average, no wait, and ample parking. I'd come here again if I needed a quick dim sum fix!", "author": "Victoria L."}

One thing that was really unexpected was how much this place caters to tourists. Menu was completely in english (so I got really confused trying to read it) and they would speak to you in English first too. \nBut to the food. \nLo mai gai was not great cause there was way too much rice and not enough filling so the rice was kinda hard and bland. \nThe chicken feet was pretty good. Wasn't super saucy and was flavorful and meaty. \nSome of the other dumplings were good, but the Shanghai dumpling was not. It was semi cold, skin was hard, and didn't have the runny soup in the center. \nSo the dishes were kinda a hit or miss for me.", "author": "Rachelle C."}

When you enter the restaurant, you can immediately see how crowded it is but there's also seating upstairs. The waiters/hosts are attentive and quickly talk through their walkie-talkies to see how long the wait is.\n\nFor a table for 3, we got seated within 10 minutes upstairs. We also preferred eating upstairs because it was more open and less hectic. Right when we sat down, they asked us what type of tea we preferred (good customer service). There's a menu on the table that shows some dim sum you can ask to order immediately, but there's also people walking around with various dishes. \n\nWe ordered a total of 7 dishes (siu mai not pictued), and the dishes were more expensive than I thought. Their portion size was also smaller, esp their custard tarts (3 small pieces). After tax, the total was $40.50 and while that was enough to leave us satisfied, I've been to many dim sum places that cost way less. While most of the dim sum tasted normal, I feel like the rice noodle rolls lacked flavor. Despite having the soy sauce, something else was missing. Also, they were cut into weird sizes (wasn't even fully cut. I feel like it's usually just half, but this one was into quarters too. \n\nOverall, while this place had decent dim sum...I would not come back because of their portion size and price.", "author": "Aileen J."}

We ordered a variety of dishes about fifteen in total. The vegetable dishes were cooked well, but the popular dim sum dishes: sui mai and chicken feet were disappointing. I've had better. The sui mai just didn't have the flavor profile like it should and the chicken feet were undercooked. The meat should fall off the bones, but it didn't.\n\nMy favorite dish was the har gow. The wrapper was thin so you can taste and enjoy the shrimp folded inside. Unfortunately I don't think I'll be returning here. I have to give it to them though when it comes to service especially for a Chinese restaurant. I'd rather eat on Clement Street which has lots of yummy dim sum delis.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-16", "description": "Le bf and I came here on a Saturday morning at 9:30am. After reading the mixed reviews on Yelp, I still hoped that I would have a good experience here. There was only one other person in the restaurant and plenty of street parking, right outside of the restaurant. When we left, an hour later, about 80% of the tables were occupied. \n\nBetween the 2 of us, we ordered:\n1. Shrimp dumpling\n2. Shrimp and chive dumplings\n3. Potstickers\n4. Scallion pancake\n5. Baked pork buns\n6. XLB\n7. Sticky rice in the lotus leaf\n8. 2 orders of the shrimp crepe\n9. Tea for 2\n\nWe ordered a total of 9 items because we saw at the bottom of the dim sum side of the menu that if you ordered 9 items, it would be $45. It isn't much of a discount, but it was still about $1.75 discount for us. But at the end of the day, the lady who gave us the bill didn't give us the discount. There is something a bit shady about that. Our total came out to be around $65 for the 2 of us (including tax and tip), so not exactly cheap. We did leave with a few leftovers, but not much.\n\nBack in the day, I remember when all the dim sum/Chinese restuarants used to provide tea for free (shows how old I am). Nowadays, it feels like every Chinese/dim sum place charges for tea. It was $1/person, so not much at all, but still, when you grew up getting it for free, it still feels weird to pay for it. The tea was also not as fragrant as other dim sum places. \n\nI think the biggest disappointment was the scallion pancake. My dad makes scallion pancake so I know how they should taste, and this one lacked flavor and didn't have those layers that you would typically find. Feel free to skip those. \n\nThe potstickers weren't pan fried for long enough. There was barely a sear on ours. Flavor wise, it was very meh. Edible, but would skip the next time, if there is a next time. \n\nOut of the 4 XLB, only 3 had soup in it, and le bf didn't think the XLB were worth ordering again. It was edible, but out of all the XLB he has ever eaten in his life, these quickly made it to the bottom of his best XLB list. \n\nI really enjoyed both the shrimp dumplings and the shrimp crepes (2 of my favorite dim sum dishes). Though the shrimp dumplings were on the smaller end, I liked how there weren't many fillers in there (like those cheaper dim sum places). I also really liked how the shrimp crepe had very thin skin and filled with a lot of shrimp. I would definitely recommend you get these 2 items. \n\nBf is a huge fan of baked pork buns. Though they were small, he liked how they brushed honey on the top and said it came out super hot. He thought they tasted good at the restaurant, but he said the real test would come when he would eat some cold ones, so verdict is still out on the buns. \n\nThe shrimp and chive dumplings were very small, compared to what you get at other dim sum places. I enjoyed them, but boy were they small. \n\nI thought the sticky rice had flavor, but le bf disagreed. The sticky rice was barely sticky, and there weren't real chunks of anything in there (like shrimp, mushroom, meat). I think I would have preferred 1 big one instead of 3 little ones. \n\nOverall, the food wasn't that good. There were a few things that I really enjoyed, like the shrimp dumplings and the shrimp crepe, but everything else was kind of underwhelming. I guess the only positive thing about this place is that there aren't long lines on the weekends, unlike places like Hong Kong Lounge 2. I wished that this place was a hidden gem, but it wasn't. I don't think we would come back. I would rather pay a bit more to get better food.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

If I had to describe it they are like soft, mini pancake pillows. Pancake because they are lightly browned like pancakes, not even sure how they prepare this. Anyway, when you bite into one, it is soooo soft, almost like mochi but has the flour like element, like a pastry. The inside is soft custard with just the right amount of sweetness.

It wasn't bad, but it was very mediocre. I think a part of it is also that the food is taken out on a tray from the kitchen, so as servers make their round thru the restaurant, the food gets a little cold.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-23", "description": "The pros and the cons of TK revolve around the fact that caters more to non-Chinese diners. On the upside, the servers are exceedingly polite (and speak English), and the interior is clean, comfy, and calm. On the downside, it is pricier for what it's worth, and the menu is more restricted since there is a significant portion devoted to Americanized items such as crab claws, egg rolls, pot stickers, and fruit salad.\n\nNonetheless, the dim sum is decently authentic, with enough variety that there was no shortage of items to order. In a blind taste test, I think some of the more basic dim-sum-cart places would be superior, but TK is good enough to satisfy my expectations (which are rather high, thanks to my many dim sum excursions in Hong Kong).\n\n(+++) Shrimp dumplings (\u8766\u9903) | $4.50: Mmm, explosively juicy, meaty shrimp. Probably my favorite dim sum here.\n(+) Pork dumplings (\u71d2\u8ce3)  | $4: Quite good, but I've had better. I think it needs more broth.\n(+) Chinese broccoli (\u82a5\u862d) | $6.25: Nice crunch, fresh veggies, but a bit too oily.\n(+) Stuffed eggplant | $5: Tasty, but the eggplant soaked up a lot of oil.\n(-) Beef crepe (\u725b\u8089\u8178\u7c89) | $4.50: Probably the most unimpressive, the texture was the beef seemed a bit like meatloaf. Also, the rolls were oddly very flat.\n(++) Dried bean curd roll (\u9bae\u7af9\u6372) | $4.50: Delicious, though the pork seems fattier than other places I've had this dish.\n(+++) Wasabi mustard sauce | I'm almost never a fan of sauces, but this was a highlight of the meal! The wasabi was strong, synergized well with the mustard, and was an excellent addition to essentially all of the dim sum.\n\nTK is not as gimmicky as the juggernaut Koi Palace/Dragon Beaux duo, whose multicolored XLB and the like may be more appealing to foodies/Instagrammers. TK is halfway between upscale fancy d down-to-earth good food, resulting in satisfying dim sum in a cozy environment but at slightly marked-up prices. \n\nThe verdict: 4 stars for those with a YOLO'ers, hard-core foodies, and rich people who work in tech; 3 stars for anyone on a grad student budget like myself :3", "author": "Edna C."}

Out of all the things, my favorite item was probably fried shrimp balls that were served with a crab claw handle. It was clever use of what would normally be throwaway claws, but who am I to say it wasn't throwaway in the first place. All other items we ordered were bland and the signature items felt like they were frozen and not fresh. I ordered Chinese donut wrapped in rice paper that wasn't available in the carts the dim sum ladies pushed around and that really disappointing. The donut was overly fried and had way too much oil remnants. \n\nFor a Saturday brunch, it ended up costing about 90 dollars for 3 people. Even for San Francisco standards, that seemed a bit excessive to me and they likely had an up charge for the weekend.

Came here for dinner with my family on a Saturday night.\n\nParking sucked. Had to park a few blocks down, so make sure to have someone drop in and get a reserved seat.\n\nWhen we ordered, our waitress was super rude when we were asking what was popular. It seemed like she didn't want to wait up for us to order, which I get, but at the same time she showed no willingness to try to be patient at all. \n\nEverything came out after 1 hour of waiting. \nIt was really frustrating because during that 1 hour of waiting, we weren't brought water or checked on by the waitress. So we pretty much sat there almost completely ignored by the staff. Note, there were 6 of us. When we finally tagged our waitress down and asked if we could have waters for all of us, she came back with 3. We thought she would come back to give the rest... but she didn't lol. We had to tag them down again to give us the other 3 water glasses. When we asked the waitress if our food would be ready soon (after already 40 minutes of waiting), she said it was coming. We asked the manager after 50 minutes where the food was, and he was pretty much saying he was busy and pointed us to our waitress. After an hour, the food started trickling in. The dishes didn't come together though, it was plate-by-plate. We got our vegetable dish first, then 5 minutes later another dish, then 5-10 minutes another dish and so on. So we didn't even start our meal or get everything until an hour or more later. And it was not even very busy, there were definitely some empty tables so we had no reason why it took so long.\n\nThe food itself was mediocre. Nothing exceptional about it. We got fried rice, crispy noodles, spinach, Mongolian beef, broccoli beef and walnut shrimp. Portions weren't the biggest. The noodles were actually pretty good, but everything else was overpriced for the portion and quality of the food. The walnut shrimp did not even come out until we were already finished with our food (one and a half hours in). The walnut shrimp was also super disappointing. The portion was super small (half of a large sized plate), and it seemed poorly prepared. The taste also didn't offset the poor quality in presentation or the long wait.\n\nOverall; I could understand if they were understaffed, if the waitress had a bad day, or if the managers were really just busy. But some things could have been avoided... (3 water cups for a family of 6- really?)

We stuffed ourselves until we couldn't see straight and the bill came to about $25 each. \n\nWe got a lot of different dishes, and while we aren't dim sum experts, most was quite tasty and well prepared, we thought. The servers don't come around with carts, but with trays holding, usually, several kinds of dishes. \n\nOne piece of advice would be to not fill up on the first things that come around. There were some scrumptious-looking dishes that didn't show up until we were too full to get more. \n\nI read the reviews saying this place was a little pricey for what you get. I think it's not pricey considering we didn't have to wait an hour to get in, which is common on Saturday mid days. And I didn't think $25 per person was bad at all for the quantify and quality we got.\n\nWe also found the service to be fine. Most of the servers don't speak a lot of English, but it's enough, especially considering that the food is right there in front of you. The floor boss speaks good English if you have special questions. \n\nBottom line is we would go back happily. The second floor also features a large bay window that gives an airy feeling to the place--very pleasant even if you aren't right by the window.\n\nNote that a party of 6 is optimal. Many of the dishes come in 3s, which the server has scissors to cut the bun or dumpling or whatever in half, giving you six portions. And with 6 you can try a larger variety of things. \n\nOne of our group was a vegetarian+seafood eater and he was able to stuff himself as well, though he complained about the \"seafood\" mostly meaning \"shrimp.\" Which he likes, but he likes other kinds of seafood as well. There was a scallop dish that we didn't try. \n\nIs it Americanized? Not as far as I could tell, and I have eaten in the other dim sum joints in Chinatown. Maybe in the sense that nobody came around with the things that most Americans won't touch, such as chicken feet and jellyfish/sea cucumber dishes. But there was still vastly more variety than a party of six could sample in one sitting. And the dishes they did have, including the traditional sticky rice with bits of meat wrapped in a banana leaf, seemed pretty down home to me (unless you insist on thousand year egg being in it). \n\nAnd the location is great for going to the attractions in Golden Gate Park afterwareds--the De Young Museum, Academy of Sciences, Botanical Garden Etc. We parked in the park on the main drive at around 23rd Ave., walked to this restaurant, then to the De Young, then to the car. Long walk but hardly a death march.", "author": "Lee T."}

Came to try this place after seeing how many reviews there are on Yelp. We walked in around 2 PM on a Tuesday and there was a fair amount of people. All of the waitstaff were able to speak both Cantonese and English and were friendly enough. Upon looking at the menu you could tell that this restaurant is very Americanized. The menu for dim sum was not very extensive and was in the same menu as the normal dinner menu. They didn't have different types of tea to offer either- which I thought was odd since most dim sum places do. I thought that the flavors of the dishes we ordered were okay, some dishes were more flavorful than others, but it wasn't bad. The prices for the dishes wasn't bad either, the total for the 5 of us was about $60. The good thing about this restaurant is that dim sum is served all day, so if you are ever craving dim sum at 7 PM- this is the place to go. All in all I thought this place was okay but not great or memorable.", "author": "Ashley W."}

So we literally ordered shrimp (minus one plate of calamari) in so many different ways. We got shrimp dumplings, shrimp fried balls, shrimp flat noodle, and their honey walnut prawns. Ordered appetizer calamari and rice too. SO MUCH FOOD but we were absolutely starving. Ended up finishing everything actually... Lol back to the food, calamari was delicious. Their honey walnut prawns were good but it kinda looked like we got skimp cause there were 4 of us and we only got 2-3 prices each. They separate the walnuts and the shrimp on the plate, which was beneficially since I don't like the walnuts and two of the other eaters loved them. Made it easier to access and easier for me to get away from. The dim sum was the typical, nothing amazing but not gross or bland either. One thing that was disappointing was that they didn't give us the rice till half way through out meal so we were kinda passed that point and over eating rice. \n\nWe got there at about 3:30 and they were still open and taking orders for dim sum. As many of you may know, not all dim sum places are open all day or serve dim sum all day so that's a plus! I'm assuming that they do the dim sum carts during the morning but only take it by order during the day. At least that's what it sounded like when we spoke to the waitress. \n\nThe food is good, it's clean, and service was nice too.

Anyway, here's a run down of pros and cons I made while eating here:\n\nPro #1: It's open from 9 to 9 (well, 10 to 9 on weekdays), which means it's open during that dining twilight between 2:30 and dinnertime, when Hong Kong Lounge is closed.\n\nPro #2: The staff all speak great English*\n\nPro #3: Restaurant is very clean*\n\nPro #4: Service is good/attentive*\n\nPro #5: All but one dish we got was served piping hot, a pretty rare experience for me when I'm not ordering dim sum off the menu\n\n*NB: In comparison to other Chinese restaurants only\n\nCon #1: The best dishes were things that appealed to a more American palate, such as the shrimp paste ball stuffed with a crab claw, or the shrimp paste ball stuffed with scallops. The classic dim sum items (dumplings, chicken feet, etc) were more disappointing.\n\nCon #2: Not super cheap...definitely not expensive, but not as cheap as I would have liked.\n\nObservation #1: When I came here, majority of the customers were non-Chinese (take from that what you will).\n\nA good summary would be that Ton Kiang is fine, but probably best for those just getting introduced to dim sum. For those of us who prefer better (and cheaper) food at the expense of service and cleanliness, there are plenty of other options in the Richmond area.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

Unfortunately after trying half a dozen dim sum places in the city from fancy to ordering at the counter and going home with a plastic bag of dim sum TK didn't impress.  It was no better than the latter.  There are two places in the city we go for a quick dim sum if we don't want to wait for hours in Chinatown and Richmond.  TK isn't any better.  It was nice that there is virtually no wait.\n\nI was nostalgic for the carts that go around the tables which seems to be disappearing. So when we got to TK and saw that they go around the tables with a tray of dim sum but without the carts I thought I would like it but I find that I actually don't.  I guess I'm a convert.  Food arrived cold.  I guess ordering from a list and them making it is best because they can make it to order and it arrives pretty warm, less waste?  The downside is you don't get to see the dish before you order, so you have to know what your ordering or know Chinese.  Either way I think i like ordering from a list if my food arrives warm or the temp its best served.\n\nFood is actually not bad but comparable to cheaper places not worth it.

When I see them cutting those beauties into fourths, I have to smile because I know my dim sum meal is ending perfectly.\n\nI'm not sure if its a San Francisco thing, but being raised on the hot mustard, vinegar and soy combo that is the wasabi of the SF dim sum world, I find myself at home at a place with these accompaniments.  I usually get a dirty look when I ask for hot mustard in Vancouver B.C. (maybe its an insult to the chefs, drowning out the delicate deliciousness of a perfect dim sum, but its how I came up in dim sum loving San Francisco.)\n\nThe service here is not super friendly, but its mostly efficient and things move fairly quickly (with the exception of special orders off the menu, so order kitchen items early, if you want those not to arrive too late in your meal.).

It was good, and I'm sure it still is, but the reason Jamie W. and I came back after all these years was to try the $10.50 Ton Kiang Steamed Salt-Baked Chicken (see photos). Now I may be the only person not Chinese, not a grandma and under eighty who likes to eat steamed chicken. That's at least what they tell me at Hunan Homes, but this turned out to be a specialty dish at Ton Kiang.\n\nIt was pretty good, just not great simply because they lacquered a sesame oil on the skin which for me, defeats the purpose of ordering chicken steamed. It was tasty, but the ginger-garlic sauce on the side would have been enough for me. Jamie preferred the $10 Chicken in Curry Sauce with Green Peppers, though he wasn't shouting from the rooftops about it (see photo). It was certainly hearty enough with plenty of peppers and onions along with the stir-fried chicken. He's definitely not an eighty-year-old Chinese grandma. It was another split decision when it came to the $11.50 Spinach with Pith of Bamboo Shoots and Golden Mushrooms, which was an odd concoction served on a glass pie plate (see photo).\n\nThe spinach was covered in a gooey mix of the bamboo shards and wood mushrooms making for an odd consistency. We were more generally satisfied with the $10 bowl of Wor Won Ton Soup, which was abundant with pork and chicken as well as won ton, bok choy and snap peas (see photo). There was barely enough room for the broth in our bowls, but we had no complaints. We were certainly sated after four dishes, but we were a bit meh given my fond memories of their dim sum selections. Guess we'll just stick to those the next time. The place is certainly popular with families on the Friday evening we went. Hope you don't mind a sometimes chaotic day-care ambiance while you dine.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...their dinner dishes don't match up to my memories of their dim sum\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...pretty standard except when the toddlers run riot in the aisles...where are their leashes?\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...surly sometimes but the dishes came out like clockwork\nTOTAL - 3 stars...guess it's back to Hunan Homes for my steamed chicken", "author": "Ed U."}

The service of dim sum is traditional in a sense that the servers bring around the plates and you signal to receive the one's you want. \n\nQuality of the dim sum is decent compared to other places I've tried.

Being ethnic Chinese in the area, we mostly ended up frequenting other dim sum places local to the area because the wait used to be insane at Ton Kiang.  Well...we decided to finally come by here on a whim a few weeks ago on a Saturday morning/afternoon. The biggest thing that stood out was its clientele.  You have two dim sum restaurants right beside eachother, and you can see a distinct difference in the patrons between the two restaurants, even though they're essentially serving the same fare.\n\nOk, I'm going to come right out and say it, and then I'm likely going to regret it as soon as I hit \"Post\" on this review.  Ton Kiang caters to a predominantly large non-Asian clientele, whereas all the Chinese are going to the dim sum place right next door.  This isn't a slam against the food, but I think it's largely due to how this restaurant has been marketed thanks to Zagat and Frommer's and newspaper reviews and whatnot.  The light and bright decor and restaurant design is also atypical of your usual dim sum joint, so I'm pretty positive the restaurant itself coupled with good marketing is what is driving its predominantly non-Asian clientele.  I mean...for once...I'm pretty positive our little table of asians was outnumbered by the number of non-asians in a Chinese restaurant.  (My aunt, who lives a few blocks from this place, said all the asians were next door.)  \n\nOk...before this review goes any further downhill and I get clobbered for seeming racist, let's get to the food.  The food was ok!  Selection was decent.  The restaurant is prepared for those unfamiliar with dim sum, so it has a pictorial menu to assist.  The dim sum wasn't large by any means, but it was still tasty.  The food is reliable, prices are ok (although you'll find cheaper dim sum elsewhere), and the service was good.  The restaurant is also quieter, so if you want to avoid the loud aggressive Cantonese banter in typical Chinese restaurants, this place will be less of an assault upon your ears.", "author": "Viva C."}

The location is perfect, there is plenty of parking on the street. Usually easy to find a spot. It's a 2 story restaurant so there's plenty of seating. You have to go on a weekend day when they are serving dim sum with the push carts and trays. It's much quicker and you get to see everything being served where as with menu ordering during the week, you don't have a visual. Only hang up they have is they do not like to be asked for forks. I asked for a fork for my little one and the server huffed and puffed the whole time. Really??? Just bring the damn fork. No big deal. Sheesh. When busy it's a little hard to get a drink but eventually it comes along. Other than those minor set backs it's a great dim sum place to visit. Everyone is nice and attentive for the most part.

Sure enough, we walked right in and were seated immediately. (An hour or so later, the place was totally packed, so I guess our timing was auspicious!)\n\nHaving had some of the best dim sum that Los Angeles has to offer, I have to admit that Ton Kiang leaves them all in the dust. \n\nI mean, the sheer quality and variety of the food can't be topped. Everything was delicious. \n\nA week later, here's my recollection of the dishes we liked best:\n- Pea shoots, simple and garlicky\n- Scallop and shrimp dumplings\n- Lotus-leaf-wrapped rice parcels\n- Rice noodle rolls filled with shrimp\n- Salt-and-pepper shrimp, deep fried with their heads and tails still on (crunchy!)\n- Succulent roast duck\n- Sweet buns filled with condensed milk\n- Mango pudding\n.... and several more items. \n\nThere were three of us, and the per-person total was only around $30. What a deal! \n\nIf only LA dim sum were quite so dependable. \n\nNote on parking: I didn't find any free parking, though if you're patient enough, I'm sure you can. Instead, I parked at a metered spot, and had to keep running out and feeding the darn thing $2/ hour (thankfully, Ton Kiang was nice enough to change as many dollars as I could hand over to them; clearly, giving customers change for parking was a regular courtesy).", "author": "Suzie Q."}

The ambiance inside is nicer than your average hole in the wall dim sum spot...but if you want the real deal chinese dim sum dishes I wouldn't necessarily pick this spot. They have the standards...steamed noodle roll dishes and the regular dumplings which aren't bad at all. But when we went, I was looking for the chicken feet, the tripes, the pineapple buns, etc...and all that kept coming to our table was tray after tray of eggrolls that we kept having to wave away. I have never desired to eat eggrolls in my life for dim sum...but hey if that's what your other customers like..then whatevs. But that poor waitress offering the eggrolls...she made a lot of rounds only to be turned away with every attempt. That's not to say they don't have other offerings...maybe they did and they just never came around or maybe they just didn't have them that day. But compared to other places, the selection here was not as abundant, nor did they frequently come around to offer stuff like they would compared to other dim sum spots I've been to. We felt like we were waiting a lot for specific dishes that never came out or that they didn't even have. On the plus side, there was no wait time on a Saturday for lunch so at least we didn't have to wait around for an hour to be seated. The service was friendly, too, so I'll give them that.\n\nWith so many other options in the area, I probably wouldn't frequent this joint again given the types of dishes I look for in a dim sum experience.

We felt so out of place and thought we were in an alternate universe. I think this is geared more toward a white crowd as it was all white. The portions were small and it wasnt as jam packed with MSG so it was definitely not as Asian as it could be. It is straight up Americanized up here and when my friend spoke Canto, I think the waiters were confused since they are so used to speaking English..I derno. I was just looking around the room for days trying to figure out how this place has over 1k reviews. There is an upstairs but I didnt see that area. There are no pushy carts but people walk around with dishes. The ones that threw me off were the green onion pancake, potstickers, cucumber slices, and the friggin fruit salad. I knew I was screwed then. Well we got the basic dishes like shrimp dumpling, noodles, pineapple custard bun and the usual. Nothing stood out as being good.

So I was on my trip to SF and I made it a mission, dim sum on Sunday! Unfortunately we all know how hard parking is when it's Sunday and you're trying to park in Chinatown. So I looked up multiple restaurants, decided to give this place a try. WORST DECISION! So we got lucky found parking on the street from across the church. Walked over and was seated fairly quickly. The food is mediocre, I've had way better where I'm from (Hawaii). I was hoping to see some carts but it's fine they all go around with trays and put them down. Similar but not that usual carts with all the steamers in em. ANYWAYS back to my experience. First off my gf wanted tea so we got her tea. I didn't touch it (but I still got charged -_-)\nThe dim sum like I said was okay. Then I needed water. They did not bring me or my gf any water! I had to ask for it at least 10x (literally no exaggeration) \nTHIS IS WHAT PISSED ME OFF!!!\nSo I asked the lady for water, she said okay. I got nothing. I brush it off. Then I ask another waitress who tells the same lady and she looks at me. STILL NOTHING. 4 other parties come in and they all get water. Okay now I'm fricken pissed! 20 minutes later and asking pretty much the whole staff. I finally get some damn water. And mind you it's a tiny glass -_- I like how they judged me based on my appearance and did not even care to pay any attention to our table. THANKS! And you know what took the cake. When it came time to pay and get the check. The check came I put down my card, not even a minute after, the lady is more than willing to come by and run my credit card. Un-freakin-believable!

The sesame balls and egg custard tarts were actually warm and tasted as though they were just made. This especially surprised me because I had NEVER tasted these things warm before. (After consulting my Chinese friends, these are supposed to be warm and fresh!) Because of this I am going to say that Ton Kiang is the first place that has given me really GOOD Chinese desserts, and for that I have to give them my highest praise.

The majority I noticed were non Asian folks.  Throwing out the obvious, \"nothing wrong with that, but...,\" the disappointment on my visit to Ton Kiang left me with major buyer's remorse.  I'm not saying it wasn't good for that reason.  Establishments such as Yank Sing cater toward more a non-Asian market, yet provide a slightly more than delectable selection of dim sum.  My only qualm with Yank Sing is the identity per se.  Ton Kiang attempts at the same appeal but misses its mark like a blind folded archer who hasn't ever shot an arrow before.       \n\nAt this point in juncture, I would run down highlights of what we ate.  That is, if there really was.  Burn... Most of the food was very plain.  Lacking quality, the portion size which usually compensates didn't.  Since much of the same dim sum was brought out over and over, \"sesame balls? sesame balls? sesame balls?\" (Multiply that 2 second loop to what seemed 1,000 times), freshness took a big hit.  I felt bad for the unknowing guy that ended up with them.  He just came in and wanted some sesame balls.  Just didn't know...  \n\nThere were a couple things that are worth mentioning.  In a semi-desperate move due to hunger, took the fried calamari.  While greasy, It was the best of the meal.  Other positive traits were the service.  They were accommodating to the customer and friendly as well.  \n\nI see handfuls of people coming here still.  I don't really get it.  Am I the crazy one?  Is there something great I'm missing?  I doubt it.  I rather wait a year in line at Hong Kong Lounge than come back here.  Over the course of time, did authenticity slowly wane in turn deteriorate quality?  I can't really give a fair assessment on that since my other visit was too far in the past.  My guess presently is Ton Kiang wasn't that good in the first place.", "author": "Arnold T."}

(Another head to stare down.)\nWhole lobster in a garlic butter sauce.  The lobster meat seemed a bit dry, and seemed insufficiently integrated with the sauce.\nBok choy and mushrooms.  Bok choy, however tender, is perhaps a bit difficult to deal with without a knife.\nPeking duck, with excellent fluffy buns, but Julienne cucumber slices instead of the traditional onion brushes.\nSea bass.  Star of the show, in a lovely sauce.  When I get back here, this will be my entr\u00e9e order.\nSeafood fried rice, served only at the end of the meal.\nMango pudding; very nice, with crunchy chunks of fresh, tart  mango, and a light  cream topping.\n\nService (a single waiter for all the tables) was competent and unobtrusive; replacement plates just materialized as needed, and leftovers from the lazy Susan were moved to smaller plates as needed to make more room.\n\nLiquor menu was a very limited wine and beer selection.

The food here was consistently average at best. The portions were small much like dim sum in Hong Kong (but this is America). The \"Pu Er\" tea was tasteless but a tad better than a packaged Lipton tea. And $64 for two people (9 dishes and a salted fish fried rice) is really breaking the bank by dim sum standards.\n\nSiu Mai - Tasted like an over-steamed pork ball (at the very least it was warm); however, it just does not taste like a bundle of juicy spare ribs.\n\nHar Gow - I must say this was probably their best dish. The shrimp was steamed right and had the right crisp and neither did the skin rip apart.\n\nShrimp Chang Fun - The noodle was just not fresh and neither did it have the chewiness that I was accustomed to eating. It was pretty much confirmed once the cover was lifted off that this dish was going to be an utter failure.\n\nFu Pei Juen - I love eating meat but I'm accustomed to eating this dish stuffed along with mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and wood-ear (mu-er). This dish was just the cousin version of the Siu-Mai but wrapped in tofu skin. \n\nDeep-Fried Salt and Pepper Shrimp - Tasted like shrimp deep-fried from the night before. It was literally served cold. The shrimp was a bizarre combination of mushiness and dryness. Even if it was not deep fried the night before, serving a deep fried dish thirty to forty-five min after is just going to taste like crap.\n\nSalted fish and chicken fried rice - This dish was average. It wasn't bad neither was it good. The presence of salted fish can improve this dish a lot; however, they were diced into tiny pieces and were very much hard to taste. So they were pretty much missing the uniqueness of the dish (salted fish).\n\nAs for the other dishes that we ordered, they were decent and average.\n\nI'm pretty sure there are some better dim sum places in SF, but it is difficult to fathom the attention that this establishment was garnering (SF Weekly, Zagat, Travel & Leisure).

Well, dim sum can be best described as bite-sized portions of delectably savory food served in baskets/steamers. What makes dim sum unique is the way it is carted/carried around to all the tables, and you choose what you see before your eyes. Don't like the way a dumpling looks? Choose the basket next to it instead. \n\nThe dim sum here is very reasonably priced. Now you can try everything. Score!\n\nDIM SUM FAVORITES:\n- Char siu bau - steamed fluffy white or baked golden-brown and filled with delicious, tender BBQ pork\n- Har gow - steamed dumpling filled with shrimp, thin skin\n- Siu Maai - steamed dumplings filled with pork and/or shrimp, slightly thicker wheat skin\n- Lo Mai Gai - sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf and steamed with pork, chicken, egg, mushrooms\n- Lo Baak Gou - pan-fried turnip cakes mixed with daikon radish\n- Mango Pudding - one of my favorite desserts EVER (I've had this at various dim sum places, and this place gets it right)\n- Egg Tart - flaky crust with egg custard filling\n- Dou Fu Fa - very popular sweet soup of soft tofu (This may be an acquired taste item, but I recommend trying it for a taste. Maybe you'll like it!)\n\nDINNER FAVORITES:\n- Peking duck - This is served dipped in a special sauce that makes the crispy skin absolutely delicious. Typically this comes with white buns that you put the meat in along with some hoi sin sauce.\n- Lobster - You get quite a large portion of quality lobster meat here. The lobster comes still shelled, but broken into manageable pieces. It is served in a buttery-garlic sauce. Mmmm... \n\nThe peking duck, lobster, and 1-2 vegetable dishes are more than enough to fill up 5-6 people. \n\nTIP: This place gets packed and parking is tough (as always in the Richmond district), but it's worth the wait. Another option is arriving later for the dim sum (closer to 2-3 pm on weekends).\n\nTIP 2: You can ask the waiters if you can order from a menu.

I see it as a trade-off between bland dim sum without waiting for a table or good dim sum but waiting in long line. \n\nI was a little grumpy at first at Ton Kiang because their so-called dim sum menu only got 10 items on it, and it is by no means a regular dim sum menu! They got people carrying trays and walked around with foods and bothered us each time they walked by our table. Many of the items are the same. Foods don't taste good and doesn't seem fresh neither, and a very limited variety to choose from. I am disappointed at what they offer there. \n\nPros: No waiting for a table. My boyfriend doesn't understand Chinese, and the people there are more English friendly because they call out dim sum names in English. It helps him in choosing what foods to order. Most of the dim sum restaurants call out dim sum names in Chinese, and it is hard to know what you are eating sometimes. \n\nCons: average and bland dim sums. Prices are relatively higher than other dim sum restaurants that have better foods. So pricier and not-as-good dim sum is what you will get.  \n\nWell, if you don't feel like waiting an hour (at least on weekends) for a table and still satisfied with average dim sum, give it a try. \n\nI'd rather wait a little and hope the line move quicker next time for a delicious dim sum lunch. Not worth going back to Ton Kiang for dim sum.", "author": "Lena H."}

Chinese chicken salad was sickly sweet; I would not order this again.

There were 8 of us on a Saturday mid-morning.  We were all seated promptly and were met with very polite servers who brought us hot tea and cups.  Then the real fun began.  I had never had dim sum before, so was not sure what to expect.  My boyfriend is pescetarian, so he was really wary of trying anything, unless he could be assured there was no meat in the items. He was not disappointed.\n We started out having a dish of greens that had halved garlic cloves fully roasted.  It was phenomenal.  Next came green beans lightly seasoned which were also just fantastic.  So far, so good! By the time we left we had tried so many dishes that my head was spinning.  I probably looked drunk walking out of there; I was so full!  We loved it so much that the following weekend we dragged a friend with us just to visit again.  Both times we were not disappointed and are already looking forward to our next visit.\n I believe the prices are very reasonable.  For our second visit, for three people, we had so much food that they had to push another table to us and our bill was just over $100.  They mark the items you receive (when they are bringing items table to table) in categories of how  much each item costs.  So, for the entire meal you too can follow the bill and stop when you see the figure is reaching the point of no return.\n\n Food Hero Tip: Do not leave until you have had the egg custard buns.  SIT BACK DOWN!  Order those buns STAT.  Side note? They sell them to-go as well.  Yeah, there may have been about 6 of those bad boys in my car for indulging later.  :)", "author": "Melissa T."}

The visitors from out of town/out of state are either easily impressed or weirded out by such things as chicken feet and semi-authentic Chinese flavors. Asian reviewers often neglect to mention you need to order in Mandarin or Cantonese. Some regulars don't mention that a place is only take-out, which is fine if you live in the neighborhood, but not worth crossing the city for. \n\nThat said, Ton Kiang has decent dim sum, with their basic offerings leaning heavily to shrimp dumplings and things stuffed with shrimp. \n\nThe setting is a pleasant restaurant in the Richmond, with white tablecloths and fairly pleasant service for dim sum. Most of the customers are non-Asian, with some mixed groups. Staff mostly speak English. The logo represents it as Hakka cuisine, though we couldn't identify anything specifically Hakka on the dim sum menu. \n\nThe asparagus was probably the surprise standout: braised or steamed with a touch of sesame and garlic and served cold, great complement to the dumplings and duck. The soup dumplings are cooked in individual tins; this preserves the soupiness but leaves the dumpling wrapper more doughy and less slippery. I liked them but it is a variation from the classical soup dumpling. \n\nThe rice noodle with beef was deliciously chewy with a hint of cilantro.

There was actually a moment in the restaurant where I thought I was going to cry. The restaurant is very disorganized and dumpy inside. Some times a dumpy interior is offset by awesome food but that was not the case here. Also, their online menu is inaccurate and many of the cool dishes online are not available (ex. Spicy Szechuan Chicken with Red Chili Peppers).\n\nWe ordered the veggie dumplings, bbq pork buns, shrimp stuffed eggplant,  salted fish fried rice, peking duck.\n\nNever had a chance to eat the pork buns or the duck.\n\nThe veggie dumpling filling was a very strange texture. Couldn't really identify what was in it. something stringy. The shrimp stuffed eggplant had an awesome looking sauce on it but it was pretty flavorless, i guess the oil they use is rarely changed so the dish just tasted like old grease. The salted fish fried rice was okay. It was the only dish of substance we received. very boring.\n\nThe server basically refused to give us the pork buns we ordered and the peking duck.  I asked why we never received ours, yet everyone around us who ordered after us did and they said they weren't going to give them to us. 1.are you kidding me? 2. why did you even take our order? Peking duck was brought to our table but the server made a mistake, took it away and then never corrected it. Sat there for about 2 hours \n \nServer never checked on our table. Just occasionally came by to bring us the wrong order or lie about what was happening to our orders.

Why not!\n\nI know that authentic and legit dim sum places are in the morning/lunch time, but you know, sometimes you just want dim sum at night.  A little shrimpy dumpling or a bbq pork bun is a good night cap.\n\nThis place does serve up dim sum at night by menu.  While we stumbled into this place after we discovered that Shanghai Dumpling Kind was closed, it ended up workng well.\n\nIts the general dumplings, and there are no carts for you to order from, but you can get the basic ha gao, bbq pork bun, sticky rice, shu mai, and that taro cake thing.

It's a quiet sit down restaurant that serves dim sum all day so if you're in the mood for dim sum during non-brunch hours this might just be the place for you. When sat, my friend and I were given a couple of menus and some tea. They have a menu that provides pictures of all the different dim sum options and they break up the different options by category. You have baked, steamed, pork, seafood, etc. They also have a smaller menu that is specifically just for dim sum and tells you what all the options are and provides a picture next to each option. This is actually separate from the larger menu because the larger one also includes all the other non-dim sum options that they have including fried rice, etc. They're very quick to take your order here. This isn't one of the rolling cart places so you won't get that instant gratification of having a steaming small tray of dim sum right in front of you after you order. In fact, even if you order all your dumplings at once they will still bring them out to you one by one. This style of serving and eating makes sense to me at Italian restaurants maybe but for dim sum I like to be able to eat from different dishes in one large course. The pork buns were delicious. The sesame balls included a lotus flavor as opposed to the red bean flavor that I initially asked for. The sui mai's flavor was only just ok. The shrimp dumplings were quite small and they didn't have very many sweet options including no taro buns. Again, this is definitely more of a starter dim sum place and if you're bringing someone who has no idea what it is or what to expect they probably won't be disappointed but if you're a seasoned dim sum goer I would probably recommend exploring a few more options in the area. What's one great thing about this place? The price! My friend and I were super full after having our share of dim sum and our bill totaled to $20. We were in and out the door pretty quickly. Cheap prices and dim sum served all day are probably the best aspects of this particular dim sum place.", "author": "Julie H."}

My wife is Chinese and she really didn't like the restaurant at all. We were greeted by a command of '2nd floor' then we had to squeeze through tables on the first floor to get to the stairs of the restaurant. I'm surprised the Fire Department allows them to have no clear path to the front door. If there were a fire, people would have problems to get to the exit. \n\nDuring our lunch, two waitresses standing next to our table were talking about who had got fired because of something.  One of them was trying to pursue more information even though the other one said let's talk later on. \n\nOne man (did not serve us at all) picked up the check pad right in front of us to find out how much tips we left and then we notices there was some kind of body motion to express his opinion about the amounts of tip in the pad. \n\nThe Dim Sum came out of the kitchen was carried by hand instead of carts.

It has an open and clean dining area and a lighter vibration than most Chinese restaurants. It's not a spot to go to for candlelit romantic atmosphere but it's definitely an upbeat, interactive dining experience. Great place to go with a group of friends, perfect for sharing. \n\nPeople complain about some of the recipes lack traditional techniques but for me, this place serves delicious food made with fresh ingredients and each bite is packed with flavor. The trick is knowing what to order. \n\nMy must haves are the baked bbq pork buns, which are just the perfect amount of sweet and savory, and the fried shrimp balls. In terms of dumplings, I favor siu mai pork, spinach & shrimp, and scallop & shrimp. Definitely also some of the best potstickers and egg rolls I've ever tasted as well. I typically order a side dish of vegetables.  My personal favorite is bok choy with garlic. \n\nI always finish off the meal with the egg custard tarts. Warm, delicious custard within a stiff but flaky crust. Only downside is their miniature size. Excellent portions for a dieter, a calorie counter, or a model but not for a foodie like me. \n\nNeedless to say, I'll be back soon.", "author": "Ruby G."}

As an international traveler, Yoshi had been all over the world including many countries we have yet to visit such as Norway, Sweden, Vietnam, Thailand and Spain. His passion for food is great and we did not want to embarass ourselves by providing him with mediocre food. \n\nWe arrived on Sunday just soon after the restaurant opened. Everything that we tried was served at the correct temperature after coming fresh from the kitchen. Because this restaurant is not huge, they don't push steam carts around. Instead, they carry up to six servings of one or two items on a tray as they go around. \n\nThere were three dishes that I don't remember seeing at dim sum before. The first was a cold asparagus dish. Long spears that had their outer skin peeled off leaving just the tenderest morsels, lightly seasoned served over a lightly pickled julienned carrot and daikon salad. Perfect way to start a meal. Second was a dumpling filling with chicken and veggies. Our dessert was a small sculpture of cut fresh fruit including grapes, watermelon, honeydew, pinepple and mango. \n\nService was quick and efficient. Empty plates were promptly removed from the table and the stream of fresh dishes from the kitchen was non-stop. The only misgiving that we had was that the steamed oysters on the half shell came out after we had our fruit.

They have a large selection of dim sum, especially seafood. If you don't see what you want being brought around ask for it, and they'll make it fresh. Some of our favorites: Steamed barbecue pork buns, foil wrapped chicken, green beans, crab claws and spring rolls. Don't miss the warm walnut cookies or mango pudding. The fresh fruit bowl is quite refreshing.\n\nTry to go on off-peak hours as it's easier to get a table. Parking in the area can be tricky, as it's a busy part of the Richmond.

I would definitely go back.  Loved the sesame donuts, custards, the leaf wrapped sweet rice, the har gaw and actually each and every thing we ordered (about 7 dishes).  The only other not perfect pieces were the shanghai pork balls which seemed to be lacking soup inside and wasn't served with ginger or any of the other stuff which makes it so perfect.

We ordered fried squid, greens beans, wor won Ton soup and beef chow fun. Normally when you order food at a Chinese restaurant, it comes out steaming hot and is always so impressive and delicious. This was not the case at all at Ton Kiang. It seemed like we waited for our food longer than usual and when the food arrived, it was not hot...at all.  None of the dishes we ordered were temperature hot. The server just dropped the food down and never came back to check on anything, NEVER!!! The reputation and high prices should have secured excellence but that was not the case at all. We had dined at Yank Sing the week before and they were FLAWLESS in every way, food and service. When the check came, they gave it to my guest and my name was on the card...female name hence I should have gotten the credit card signature voucher. No acknowledgment at all.

Gai Lan is a \"must have\" for me any time I am eating dim sum. This place cooks the broccoli perfectly. Al dente. Only *heh* is that the oyster sauce is served in a side dish. I like my oyster sauce served on the gai lan as soon as it's done cooking, so that the heat from the vegetable heats up the sauce, so you do not have cold sauce on hot veggies. Make sure you add a bit a chili oil. \n\n2. BBQ Pork steam buns, pot sticker, prawns w/ glazed walnut : Standard. No complains, no raves. \n\n3. Fried rice: Has a lot of flavor. It's worth ordering. \n\n4.Hai Kim (Shrimp Stuffed Crab Claw): The meat inside is flaky, not soggy and very hot (to the touch). Be careful when you bite into it. The outside; very crunchy. Overall; Pretty good.   \n\n5.Shrimp stuffed eggplant:\nThis dish is very good. The skin on the eggplant is thick and a little tough and hard to cut with your teeth. Make sure you get both the eggplant and the shrimp in one bite. The two together taste very unique and very good; sweet from the eggplant and savory from the shrimp. On their own, the eggplant is eggplant and the shrimp is shrimp. Again, very hot, be careful. \n\n6. Vegetarian Egg Rolls: Slightly Below Average. These are extremely hot when you bite into them if they have cooked them fresh. I burnt my tongue. Whoops! They are also very greasy. I've had better. \n\n7. I was not impressed that this place did not have a birds nest.\n\nService and Tips: Slightly below average.\n~ The waiters are not as fast as a traditional dim sum place with carts and what not. \n~ Order as many dim sum dishes as you can and try everything. \nAsk for as many dishes of chili oil before you get your food.

One thing I noticed about this place asides the awards placarded up which boasts their inclusion in Michelin reviews along with awards they've won for former consecutive years, is that the service is absolutely exceptional.  The waiters make their rounds in evenly paced increments, and the water is always being topped off endlessly.   \n \nI was happy with the selection they had, which is modest in comparison to some bigger places but still is diverse in the range of items offered.  The only disappointment today was the Filo on the pork pastry was really doughy, and not baked long enough.. However, I don't think i'll hold it against them because everything else was so tasty.\n\nI realized when writing this that I was probably in the mood for shrimp today seeing as my top picks mostly have shrimp in them.. \n-Ha Yeung -Shrimp Balls with crispies \n-Gao Choy Got -Green Chive & Shrimp Dumplings\n-Hai Kim -Shrimp Stuffed Crab Claw\n-Don Tahiti -Egg Custard Tart", "author": "Ty T."}

All very safe tastes and textures. Deep fried this, steamed that, shrimp this, and stuffed veggies that. It's safe, a tourist/hipster hotspot, they all speak English and not a single Chinese family in sight; which equals expensive. $90 for 6 people (not including tip) and still left hungry! At any other down home authentic dim sum house that would be a feast. \n\nThe thing I love about dim sum is the adventure. I love the classics (gold mountain), the old school (Asia pearl), the new tastes coming from HK (Koi palace) and the downright kick ass dumplings (kingdom of dumplings). I love the energy of a good dim sum house; family centered, loud, pushy, the clink of tea cups, and rattling of carts, the yelling of dishes in canto and everyone eating while keeping an eye out for the next dish or what everyone else is eating. \n\nTon kiang does not have the energy of a dim sum house. It's quiet, only English can be heard, everything is the same but packaged differently, staples aren't offered (hello where are my chicken feet?) and people are like super excited to try deep fried squid. Let's go to Pier 39 after this kind of folks.  \n\nThe veggies were on point, the dumplings were average, duck small for the price, deep fried shrimp were good and xlb sadly lacking any soup inside (one big ball o' meat). \n\nThis is the place to come if you're a novice, scared of squiggly bits, are insecure about ordering at a traditional dim sum house whether because of language barriers or tastebud barriers.

They did have chicken feet( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/amU3hEJke5anv35WJ6zwnA/l ) which I finally tried, and I must say I'm not a fan...its just a bunch of chicken skin with bones....I'll pass.\n\nI was very disappointed in the Shanghai pork dumplings( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/KAITYSAwXty5ILsmIrWdTw/l ).  The skins were too thick, and there was barely and juice inside.

After waiting 10 minutes and wondering if they would come outside to call our names, they eventually did and sat the three of us at a huge round table all by our lonesome selves. \n\nWithin *seconds* of sitting down, a woman approaches us and asks \"fried calimari?\" Yes, please. \n\n5 seconds later: \"Pork buns?\" Yes, please. \n\n25 seconds later: \"Eggrolls?\" Yes, please. \n\n1 minute later: \"Shrimp (something)?\" Yes, please. \n\nDim sum was invented for hungry and open-minded eaters. Everything came in quantities of 3 or 4 so they're the perfect size for small groups. A bill stays on your table that they mark every time they deliver a dish so you can keep track of the total as you go. \n\nThe variety here was pretty great. We only saw a few repeats go by; otherwise everything was new and fresh. But of course soon as we pay and get up to leave, they start busting out some crazy fruit dishes and fried shrimp. Where were those earlier, Ton??\n\nI wish there were more sauces at our disposal (Sriracha, Hoisin, Plum) but we only got small amounts if they were paired with the dish we selected. \n\nI also wish they kept the front door closed. After much deliberation, I realized the gusts of wind weren't coming from between my legs. \n\nAnd I wish they sent me home with someone.

Table cloths are white and has a upscale without being haughty ambiance.  Most of the clientele here were westerners (not a lot of Asians), and the menu somewhat reflected it.\n\nWaitstaff was friendly and polite, but not too helpful in selecting dishes.  But food did come out fast and hot.\n\nThe dishes were good and tasty, but lacked the fresh ingredient taste I appreciate with living on the coast.  We ordered their seafood hot pot which did come out good, but again tasted as if it was taken out of the oven just a bit premature (food was cooked well, just lacked the taste throughout all the ingredients).\n\nVegetables were tasty and cooked very nicely, and probably was the best cooked dish here (hollow heart vegetable or on-choy).  The rice here was excellently done and came out hot and fresh for us.\n\nPrices were a bit on the high side, but I think they can justify it due to the name recognition this place gets.\n\nOverall a good Chinese restaurant that you'll probably get what you came for, but given the tons of other options in the area I'd personally prefer to go somewhere else.", "author": "Andrew Y."}

There was a little card in the middle of the table explaining what each dim sum dish was. Call me an elitist Chinese dim sum eater, but that card with the explanations just destroyed any cred this restaurant had in my mind.\n\nThe food itself was okay, I'd give it 2.5, maybe 3 stars.

The problem was that halfway through my supper, two MORE groups of white people walked into the restaurant in succession, so that ruined everything. zero stars.\n\nNow that I've summarized 90% of the yelp reviews for this restaurant, let me just say that the food here is pretty darn good. I should mention that I've never actually ordered Dim Sum here. I usually stick with the seafood options, and they're all great, especially the squid. They used to pair that up with hot peppers in szechuan sauce, but I like the XO sauce/snow pea option that shows up on the menu now instead. The clam, fish and prawn dishes are all pretty amazing as well.\n\nYes, the prices are a touch higher than your typical place, but that's a reflection of the quality of the ingredients, especially the seafood. And you won't see any \"NO MSG\" signs anywhere.\n\nI realize that this is not one of the trendiest restaurants in San Francisco (thank you, Michael Bauer), but if you're more interested in getting tasty seafood than name-dropping restaurants on your match.com profile, give Ton Kiang a try.", "author": "Owen R."}

Unless you come in early, there's usually people waiting outside on weekends.\n\nAll the wait staff speaks English. And most (+90%) of the customers are non-asian (don't let that deter you). In the past most servers were bilingual (chinese/english), but recently I found that many of the new servers don't speak ANY chinese. This could be a problem for customers that don't speak much English.\n\nPrices are expensive, and all Dim Sum items and portions look small (demure) in comparison. But the quality of the ingredients is usually much better (sometimes less greasy) than many other places. I'm not going to say that every dish is the best, because that's not the case but most have been good. I find that it's also a good place to bring people who have never tried Dim Sum before. Note that the most expensive Dim Sum plates are the vegetables (long beans, chinese broccoli, asparagus, etc.) because they are supposedly the most tender hand picked pieces. They also have a regular menu in case you want to add items like chow mein, roasted duck, etc.\n\nIn my opinion this is a good choice to celebrate special occasions. We came here to celebrate Mother's day last Sunday. The criteria used to select this Dim Sum place was:\n\n- don't want sticky tables\n- don't want to squeeze thru narrow spaces or constant bumping into people\n- nice decor and clean location\n- professional and pleasant service AND good tasting food\n\nMost asian customers prefer to go to places like: House of Banquet, Lee Hou, Tong Palace (all on Clement street), because of their cheaper prices and more authentic experience.

And if I hadn't, I might have rated Ton Kiang four stars--I didn't sample enough really to rate Ton Kiang five stars confidently. But I'm going on Ming Tsai's word that this place is better than Koi Palace. \n\nAnyway, so yes, as other reviewers have noted, there were an awful lot of white folks for a good dim sum restaurant. I mean, when I'm more Asian than most people, that's a bad sign. I also saw Ton Kiang featured once on Martha Stewart, the whitest woman on the planet, and that did not bode well. BUT, it was 3pm. A time when no self respecting Cantonese is going to go for yum cha. (It just fit my schedule to meet a non-Asian friend then). Because it was so late, we planned to just order off the all day dim sum menu--and did, before we realized that the server was STILL coming around with dim sum plates. I was impressed. I've been seated at Koi Palace at around 1 (having arrived sometime hours earlier) and had them stop coming around with dim sum. And what we did have was good. Unfortunately, there were just two of us, which meant we tried fewer items. I particularly enjoyed the don tot and cha sui bao. \n\nIn case you are not as big of a Ming Tsai fan as me, he's the chef owner of Blue Ginger in Boston, one of the original Food Network chefs before the Food Network stopped caring about trained chefs and invested only in home chefs with a taste for diner food, and now has a PBS show called \"Simply Ming.\" He's also a contestant on Next Iron Chef. Anyway, after he sat at the table next to ours, I got up the courage to go up and say \"hi\" (without having the courage to ask for a photo) and in the minute or two while I stammered something about my mom being a big fan of his and trying for years to get a reservation at Blue Ginger, I learned that 1) Blue Ginger just expanded to double its size and 2) Ming Tsai really enjoys the dim sum at Ton Kiang and prefers it other popular places in the area. (On his way out, he stopped by our table and said, \"Say hi to your mom.\" That made my mom's day). \n\nParking is also good in the Outer Richmond (although you'll need to get up to feed the meter) and I found the prices reasonable.", "author": "Susan S."}

A couple of stops there, and they'd scurry off with an empty tray. Every time we ate something, we'd have to wait and wait for a server to pass with something we wanted to eat (that wasn't donuts, egg custard tarts, or mango pudding!). Eventually, we managed to order a few dishes, for which we waited over half an hour before giving up. Over the course of more than an hour, I don't think we had more than 5 dishes.

Instead, waiters who carry around items will set down what you want if it's on your ordering sheet. Otherwise, you just have to wait. So all I ask is, what's the point of pre-ordering if I'm just gonna wait until the ladies come around with their trays? In the beginning, we had a small wave of food that came. And then nothing....for a while....until we asked...and waited...and asked again, and waited again. \n\nMaybe I went on an off day but when I eat dimsum, I like to have a plethora of choices in front of me.

While there were many places to choose from, many of the highest rated places were take out style establishments that really looked like a hole in the wall.  That's all well and good but we wanted the sit down experience.  We opted to try a place called Ton Kiang which was on the way from our hotel in SOMA to Muir Woods were we planned a hike.  The place was easy to find and we got there right after they opened.  After we sat down we were really disappointed to see that this was a \"no cart\" dim sum place.  We decided to be good sports and ended up ordering from the list of dim sum left at the table.  The food came out quickly once we ordered and WOW was it great.  I've never had dim sum as fresh as what I tasted at Ton Kiang.  As we got through our first course of both steamed and fried shrimp and pork dumplings, we noticed that people were steadily streaming into the place.  As the place got busier, so did the servers.  They started bringing out platters of dim sum and offering (with an explanation) what they had.  This was sort of a mini cart style service to me.  I noticed that much of the food offered on the platters was not on the menu.  Together with what was brought on the platters and what was on the menu, Ton Kiang offered much more variety than what it seemed when you look at the reviews and menu on the internet.  \n\nThe quality of the food was so great we ordered a lot more than we needed in fear that as the place got packed (and it's a small place) the service and quality would go down.  This never happened.  We noticed that every dish was carefully inspected by an older gentleman that sat near the kitchen door.  He later turned out to be the manager and clearly had an eye for quality and made sure that everything stayed on par as the crowd picked up.  The servers stayed attentive which is not always the case at most dim sum places.  \n\nThe prices were reasonable especially considering that we were in San Fran and the level of quality the food was.  \n\nWhile there are several larger, and much more crowded dim sum places in the city that are popular with visitors I really can't stress enough to not overlook this little gem of a place.

When we asked our waiter about tea it took him 15 minutes and a reminder from me to bring a full kettle. He didn't even say 'Sorry'.   Next day our guests that came from Europe ate lunch at Ton Kiang. They had shrimp dumplings which they liked and ordered 2 more portions. 20 minutes later only one portion was delivered and it was completely cold.\nOur guests didn't realize that tips aren't included in the bill, they paid the bill and left. Waiter ran after them to the street and created a scene trying to explain what happened and insisting on tips. Our guests couldn't understand what the waiter wanted from them due to the lack of English.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-27", "description": "Recently I've been on a quest to find a dim sum sit-down restaurant with good prices and quality and fairly easy parking.  We saw a write-up in Zagat that said Ton Kiang was a good dim sum restaurant and we decided to try it. It was adequate and appeared to cater to tourists and Westerners, but it is probably not someplace I would want to frequently visit. \n\nWe arrived about 1100 on a Thursday morning and there was adequate seating. It quickly filled with patrons.  We noticed that customers did not appear to be locals, but tourists and light-weight eaters.  The restaurant is clean with white tablecloths (probably a mistake on their part).  The waiter came by and brought us tea ($1/person) which was essentially a pot of hot water with a few pieces of leaves. It was pretty weak tasting.\n\nServers were woman who carried trays and announced the offerings in both Cantonese and English.  Most of the items were in the $4 to $5 per plate item.  We started off with the typical har gow (shrimp dumplings) which consisted of 4 pieces for $4, siu mai (pork dumplings), also 4 pieces for $4, and baked pork buns 3 pieces for $4.  The dumplings were good.  The baked buns had a sweet glaze on top, which they could probably do without, but not much meat filling.\n\nOur second round consisted of noi mai gai (sticky rice and chicken with lotus leaves).  This consisted of 3 small pieces for $5.  It had a smoky flavor (probably from the lotus leaf), but the filling consisted of mostly rice with small pieces of unidentifiable meat.  The server stopped at our table with some egg custards, but they look pretty dinky and we passed.  We finished off our meal with chive dumplings (shrimp and green onions), 4 pieces for $5.  They were round and pan fried and then steamed.  This was good.  However, it is a little misleading as it advertised chives, but consisted of green onions.  This dish was flavorful.\n\nAll in all, this place is okay - rather blah and sterile.  I would stick with the dumplings as that seems to be their best dishes.  We are still looking for the ideal dim sum restaurant.", "author": "Robert J."}

I probably went for the first time 10 years ago and been there 5 times over the years. We were a bit worried when we checked on yelp to find the reviews had turned lukewarm. This place used to have lines so long in the weekend mornings that if you didn't get there before 10am, you really should anticipate a 45min wait. But, we had to see for ourselves if the reviews were really correct. \n\nOh man... we weren't even seated yet and my gal pal was already frowning. She is Chinese so she's our authority in the dim sum category... first of all, there was a line - not as long as memory recalls but that's good for us. However, the lady taking down the order of diners took another guy out of order in front of us and then just assumed we were with the guy. She was miffed. Then she called him first after she had corrected her and they followed her along their merry way. Nice. It kinda went downhill from there. We probably waited about 20 minutes. \n\nSo to check out if the food is great according to Asian standards, one must look for the number of natives, ie: heads with black hair. Sad to say, the ratio of Asian folk to non was about 10% vs. 90%. The food was just ok- I'd give it a B. We had a variety of dumplings - shrimp with chives, shrimp with scallop, shrimp with something else, and shumai. Gai lan was good but who can screw that up?? Little spareribs with black bean, salt and pepper shrimp and finished with mango pudding. I don't know if they just don't put as much care into each dish anymore but it was just okay. Doesn't justify the prices either. \n\nWe're sad to say we agree with a lot of the reviewers in that it's just not as great as the days when they were featured on the Martha Stewart show. Those days are gone.  \n\nThere was a long line on our way there along Geary at some place with an orange awning called Hong Kong something so maybe we'll go there next time.", "author": "Kuishingal F."}

Dim sum in San Francisco is just like Toronto....ya don't go dim sum in San Francisco proper, ya gotta get yourself out of dodge, (Daly City) in SF, (Scarborough/Richmond Hill) in Toronto.\n\nBut, if you're okay with mediocrity or just have that craving and can't make it out of town, then I guess you're stuck with Ton Kiang or Yank Sing in SF. \n\nBummer. Ton Kiang is a very non-descript, small restaurant in Outer Richmond (west side). It is mostly frequented by non-Asian's who want to experience dim sum but perhaps don't want to deal with the bustle and commotion and abrupt service that most quality dim sum places have.\n\nNonetheless, the dishes are carried out on trays. The waiters, who are quick to give an English name, seem confused when I had to ask what it was in Cantonese. Most of the stuff is cooked fresh but it is not high quality (read possible previously frozen). Your staple har gow, siu mai were just barely ok. Nothing really to say but just disappointed because I expected something half decent given the raving (written by non-asian) reviews. \n\nI don't want to be too harsh but I want to make sure my fellow dim sum loving brethren don't get fooled.

If you have experience eating dim sum or are not afraid of more authentic places, you should not eat here. Hong Kong Lounge a few blocks away is much better.\n\nIf you have never had dim sum before and are a timid eater, this place will be good for you because they have fluent English speakers to walk you through your meal and their menu is limited to the less \"exotic\" dishes so nothing will freak you out (except maybe the chicken feet).", "author": "Alex P."}

But I also go with a small group of 4 and if we go early enough during the week (by 12:00) we get in pretty quickly. There are certain dishes we love so we ask for them instead of waiting for the cart to arrive -- for example we like the fried taro root dumpling. \n\nWe also go for birthdays, Christmas Eve and when a special friend is in town for a visit. Those days are usually weekend celebrations, so we sometimes hit a line.\n\nI also like to go to Ton Kiang at night alone or with a friend. The dinner hour is for regular dishes from a menu.

Yes, the crowd.  You can tell this restaurant is top-of-the-line when it is bursting at the windows, doors, and walls.  Hakka Chinese cuisine boasts a sweet to savory array of deliciously authentic dishes, without a hint of doubt.  If you are craving these treats from the East in the best of the West, read the following suggestions:\n\n-Wherever dim sum is served traditionally, be mindful of having to wait your turn.  In any business, that's just the way it is!\n\n-Food a bit costly, yet you actually do get a lot!\n\n-Crowds, crowds, crowds.  You may need to think twice before ordering dim sum during lunch hours as Ton Kiang tends to be subject to outside queues at this time; on Saturdays and Sundays, you have a full half-day in which you can enjoy other tasty wares, so what's the rush?\n\n-Everything is made from scratch using only fine ingredients, such as meats, seafood, and vegetables.  The ma-po tofu, though spicy, is definitely a must-try as it is healthy.\n\n-The building is uniquely San Franciscan; however, inside is a whole new story: the atmosphere is exotic and serene as are the wall murals.\n\nDon't complain if Ton Kiang becomes one of your favorite restaurants!", "author": "Mancala P."}

It's also my favorite place, hands down.\n\nI remember thinking that the portions were smaller and the prices higher than other places when I first went there, but quickly decided that paying a little bit more was an even tradeoff for the freshest tasting dim sum I'd ever had. I love the sauteed pea shoots, gai lan, scallion pancakes, and, above all else, the siu mai. I judge a dim sum place by its siu mai, and Ton Kiang's is the best: a good, flavorful and succulent blend of pork and shrimp. I could be very happy eating only the siu mai, but it would be very difficult to pass up the chive and shrimp dumplings, char siu baked baos, foil-wrapped chicken, and spareribs in black bean sauce. \n\nPrices are still higher than other places and portions have seemed a bit smaller the past few times I've been, but it's still worth it--even if I have to circle around for 15 minutes trying to find a parking place.", "author": "Julie K."}

Our choices were my staple Golden Mountain in Chinatown or something new. He suggested Ton Kiang since it was Hakka cuisine and we wanted to try something different!\n\nFirst off, the parking and the wait are major drawbacks. I dropped off my friend to get a table since there was a sizable crowd waiting outside the restaurant. I circled the neighborhood for almost 30 minutes before finding a spot, only to show up and wait another 10 minutes before we got a table. Apparently the restaurant staff had told him the wait was only 20 mins, so double whatever time they tell you.\n\nSecond, as a Chinese person, I tend to take stock in the crowd at a restaurant. It was pretty much all non-Asians dining at Ton Kiang. This made me slightly hesitant, but I also noticed that the restaurant was clean, spacious and bright and the staff spoke pretty good English, which is probably more helpful for non-Chinese people who want dim sum..\n\nThen I finally got to try the dim sum. It was alright. Not bad, but certainly not the freshest or best dim sum I've had. There were very few \"different\" (Hakka) dishes and there were quite a few white-washed items like fried calamari (which tasted bland, so don't order it). My favorite was the shrimp and chive pan fried dumpling.\n\nSo Ton Kiang wasn't bad, but it wasn't good and it was quite pricey ($45 dim sum for 2). I'd much prefer my Chinatown staple which has waaaay better dim sum. I wouldn't come here again for dim sum, but I'd be interested in trying the Hakka dishes at dinner.", "author": "Wendy T."}

There are large group of families, small groups of friends and the BEST dim sum!  \n\nWe came in from the cold after finding FREE PARKING (how cool is that?! I ask you, when was the last time there was free parking in SF?! --maybe when you had to use a whip and a pooper scooper!).  We had walked down the other side of the road to get some goodies from the Russian Bakery, which we stowed in the car.\n\nWalking into Ton Kiang's was a warm blast of humanity.  The head waiter sized us up and sent us upstairs.  We got a table in the corner and said yes to just about everything that came our way:  foil wrapped chicken, plates of green beans and rabe, beef stuffed noodles, shrimp stuffed mushrooms, sesame balls, egg custard cakes, shrimp stuff crab claws, mango pudding (ok, twice).  I know I am forgetting something, but I was busy slurping and chewing and enjoying the scene.  The tea was a jasmine that got darker as we went along.\n\nServers kept coming by with more, but at some point we got a little pickier and said no to the tofu dumpling and crab and pea cakes.  Finally there was no more food on the table, we had slurped down the second and last mango pudding and we decided that we had to leave before we exploded.  Luckily, we had enough time for a walk at Sutro's before getting in the car to leave.  \n\nOne of the things I like about Ton Kiang's is that although the price is higher than most other dim sum places, the ingredients are fresh and of much higher quality.  It does make a difference.  If you have ever had a char-sai bow (pork  bun - not in evidence this afternoon, but I probably could have had some if I had requested them) here, you will never be satisfied with them made anywhere else.  They are so fresh, they need to have their mouths washed out with soap!  ::Laugh:::\n\nMy family loves to eat at Ton Kiang's and there was the night of DIM SUM MIRACLE where my brother Pat and Dr. R. found a place to park Pat's Expedition (not a small feat in and of itself, but it was towing a uhaul trailer AND it was that drizzly-cold night).\n\nI take off a point because of the prices (but hey, fresh is worth it) and the spotty service (but hey, it was Christmas afternoon).", "author": "Kelly B."}

They are more-or-less an unfortunate byproduct of efficient cognitive processing. It all boils down to the fact that we're hardwired to be lazy and use as little information as possible to make daily decisions and judgments. Can you imagine the otherwise \"paralysis through analysis?\" For many, some of the operative stereotypes when choosing a Chinese/dim sum restaurant are:\n\n- Lots of White folks eating there? = Bad\n- Does the place look sterile? = Bad\n- No dim sum carts? =  Bad\n- On the pricy side? = Bad\n\nMy brain immediately activated these thoughts as I walked into the bright, pristine dining area of Ton Kiang with its huge, pretty red signage. However, since I trust the taste of my companions, I tried to cast these heuristic traps aside and judge the food solely on its own merits. Fourteen different orders of dim sum later, I was able to independently conclude that this was some light, tasty, refined dim sum. Others have alluded to this, but it's worth repeating. You may walk out stuffed, but it most likely won't be that heavy, greasy, \"WHY do I do this to myself?!?\" feeling.\n\nNow, I will freely admit that I have never earned my Chinese card, despite my quarter-blood Chinese heritage, so I don't have a hard-line standard for authenticity (or much facility with the \"real\" names of dishes. Bao = round things. That's about it for my repertoire)...but I do know \"yum\" when I taste it. I appreciated that Ton Kiang had a wide variety of dim sum, with many items a change of pace from the usual fare at your standard Cantonese joint. Here are some standouts of this dim-sum-a-thon:\n\n- Sticky rice and meat wrapped in banana leaves: this is one of my favorite dim sum dishes. I get it every time. My friend, who is a much more legit Chinese person than I am, shared that this is one of her benchmarks for a restaurant's dim sum quality. What is the texture of the rice? Proportion of rice to meat? What did they stick in there? Ton Kiang's version passes the test, using a wonderful glutinous rice that allows each grain to be differentiated, yet coexist amongst each other without becoming too mealy. Not only was the chicken/pork mixture tasty, but they included salted egg! Joy!\n\n- Chive & shrimp dumplings: it is wonderful that the robust chives are the star of these dumplings and do not play second fiddle to the shrimp. \n\n- Scallop & shrimp dumplings: it's a fat shrimp wrapped by a huge scallop, served with a light oyster sauce and peppers. Damn, this is like dim sum livin' large.\n\n- Eggplant & shrimp: I love eggplant. I love shrimp. With that tender, fiberous eggplant wrapped around that plump, juicy shrimp watch out because I might steal your share from you while you're not looking.\n\n- Foil wrapped chicken: would've passed this up if it weren't for the urging of another friend. Glad we didn't because this sizzling hot chicken was tender, yet crispy with a strong garlicky marinated taste. \n\n- Mango pudding: refreshing, with plenty of fresh mango chunks. Perfect palate cleanser.\n\n- Egg custard rice cakes: held in the palm of one's hand, this tiny, warm, pliable package evokes images of childhood - of innocence - of safety and comfort. Upon consumption, the rice cake gives way to cascading custard creaminess, eliciting grunts and groans from every one at the table. Close your eyes and take in the full glory of this unassuming but rapturous dessert.\n\nNot every dish was as much of a visceral experience, and though none were really \"bad,\" I feel a Yelper responsibility to note a few misses:\n\n- Scallion pancake: cardinal sin of scallion pancakes - too gummy, not flaky. \n\n- Duck: skin was a bit thin and chewy, not crispy. Order is quite large, but the unimpressive salty taste isn't really worth the stomach space. Skip it.\n\n- Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings): ok, it's not a Shanghainese place so expectations should be low. But we were a table of social justice-oriented psychologists trying to shatter stereotypes, so we decided to give a try. There wasn't even any soup inside the dumplings! (it had all been soaked up by the meat). Wrapper was floury and gummy, meat inside nothing to write home about. Blech.\n\nAfter some rousing discussion of lighthearted lunch topics such as racism and Asian American identity, we all agreed that, on the whole, Ton Kiang is the kind of establishment that defies some people's stereotypes of what a \"good\" dim sum restaurant should be. Good food is good food. Remember: stereotypes are powerful b/c we tend to pay closer attention to information that confirms our preconceived ideas. So, next time you come across a place that doesn't seem to fit the \"mold\" of what is \"good,\" it might be worth it to give it a shot. Continuous, conscious efforts to seek out information that contradicts our preconceptions are the most effective way to break down stereotypes.\n\nThank you for your time. *steps down from soap box*", "author": "Steph P."}

I had been several times before and knew what to expect from a dim sum banquet. It meant I was going to be fucking stuffed! If there's one thing I love it's dim sum. The only thing I love more is dim sum when someone else is buying. Well, besides the wife, kid, family, blah blah blah. Anyway, back to the food.\n\nWe started off with a kind of Chinese antipasto platter which was made up of cold sliced meats, a jellyfish salad and some little brown things which I couldn't identify but ate three of in an attempt to convince myself that I liked them. I'm half Chinese, dude. That means I have a genetic predisposition to eating weird shit that's dried, salty or generally considered inedible in most cultures. Can you think of any other cuisine that utilizes chicken feet? Yeah, I didn't think so. What followed were courses that are typical of Chinese banquets; gai lan, pork spare ribs, Peking duck etc. Although these dishes are ubiquitous at Chinese restaurants I found their preparation at Ton Kiang to be more refined and elegant and devoid of excessive grease and gluey cornstarch-thickened sauces.\n\nMy uncle came around to the table near the end of the meal and asked, \"Hey, did you like the duck tongues?\"\n\n\"Huh? What?\"\n\n\"The duck tongues. Those little brown things on the first course.\"\n\nWell, actually, no.\n\nThe dim sum is the real star of this place and if you prefer the instant gratification of pointing and grunting at the passing carts then you won't be disappointed. This stuff is delicious. Ton Kiang is fairly clean and a little pricey which makes it accessible and inviting to most white folk. DON'T BE PUT OFF BY ALL THE WHITE PEOPLE, the food is actually really good.\n\nAs much as I like eating dim sum I usually don't opt for Ton Kiang as I am half Chinese and therefore cheap. Oh, and yeah, you can probably pass on the duck tongues.", "author": "Josua P."}

The difference however is quality.\n\nThe key to dim sum is the feeling you have after you leave. Cheap Chinese dim sum will leave you feeling heavy and bloated. Good dim sum will leave you wanting more. Ton Kiang definitely falls into the latter category.\n\nMost Asians will knock down stars for the price -- hell, for my dad, the cheaper dim sum is, the better it tastes to him... Some Chinese will knock down stars for them not being Cantonese. Unlike most other dim sum places in the City, Ton Kiang is Hakka, versus Cantonese. (Both come from the same province in China, but they're distinctly different peoples.) Hakka cuisine can be differentiated -- it's less fried, not as heavy and greasy. \"Dim sum\" is a Cantonese phrase, but they hardly monopolize dim summery -- not by a long shot.\n\nThe biggest problems with Ton Kiang are the lack of parking and the waiting: an hour to an hour and a half on the weekends. If you show up by 1pm, forget it -- the selection will be very limited by the time you're seated.\n\nMany of these reviews who give Ton Kiang low marks I think have a Cantonese bias, and Ton Kiang is definitely not Cantonese in flavor. Some also knock Ton Kiang for having a very large percentage of White patrons -- I assure you they only discovered this place after some slanty-eyed fellow like myself dragged their pale butts in here and made them eat.

I'm Korean, and even I was super confused. We were laughing our heads off.\n\nAtmosphere: the place is way cleaner than a place like shanghai dumpling king. Probably not as loud as most of your canto-ed out dim sum establishments. Lots of natural light in the dining area upstairs and the place is not crowded.\n\nClientele: we look around and see why everything was so off base here. There were groups of white folks everywhere, or there was one token white guy who happened to have a Chinese wife, and the family decided to go have some Americanized dim sum. Or a group of friends together but then they have a couple of token white washed Asian friends. I'm assuming that this is their niche (dim sum for non dim sum eaters) b/c at your table, they have these 2-D line drawings of the dim sum plates with the Romanized pronunciations of the dim sum. Seriously most bizarre experience ever.\n\nThe food: portions where small, prices were high (most plates were like $4-5), there was NO SOUP IN MY XIAO LONG BAO!!!!!!!!!!! This place gets an F for allllll eternity in my book. Absolutely black listed. $4 for 3 potstickers (that were cold)?!?! we were still hungry after we finished our dim sum, we had to get the menu and order a plate of gravy noodles with beef and veggies ($11.50 and it was SO salty). i felt so raped after I left this place. 5 people and our bill came out to $116 before tip. Worst dim sum I've had in my life for the highest price per person I've ever paid in my life. And what's up with the calamari being passed around as dim sum? That was a first. \n\nThen the long walk back to my car, and we notice all the happy Chinese people still lining up at mayflower, eating their yummy dim sum, and probably not getting ripped off either. Walk of shame. \n\nP.S: The napkins at ton kiang were exceptionally thick. Maybe that's why the dim sum was so expensive....", "author": "Irene C."}

When I was first to arrive I was seated upstairs and the waitress offered a vase with water for the roses I had brought for my grandmother. The service was excellent and the food was better.\n\nFirst off I love any restaurant with a lazy Susan. With any kind of family style restaurant it is a must. We started with a some dim sum, won-ton soup, and the Tom Kiang seafood platter. My mom normally mixes the won-ton soup and seafood platter together when at home but both dishes are delicious separately. We ordered up 6 of the hot dishes and enjoyed every one.\n\nThe total was very reasonable for the amount of food we ordered up.

I've been eating here for 15 plus years (we used to go to the old location as well) and have had many a wonderful meal. \n\nOthers can argue all day about whether it's authentic or not, too many white people or not, expensive or not and on and on, but I could care less - the food is damned good! And how can you beat being able to order the your Dim Sum favorites at 8:00 at night? It's Dim Sum on demand!\n\nWhat works for me is to go in the evening after the dinner rush has died down, sit downstairs and order all my favorite morsels. No lines, no crowds, just me, my family and friends and some Dim Sum love.  I tend to stick with the shrimp and chive dumplings, shrimp and pea tip dumplings,  sui mai, baked or steamed pork buns, shrimp and rice noodle, and the BBQ pork and curried beef pastries, which are not actually on the evening Dim Sum menu but can be ordered by those in the know. I also love the desserts - the flat custard cakes, egg custard tarts, walnut cookies, and mango pudding (with extra condensed milk of course).\n\nThe regular food is also good. I know this is going to sound like the most whitebread comment, but they make the best sweet and sour chicken I've ever had! The chinese broccoli and other veggies are usually tasty, and the minced chicken in lettuce cups is always a crowd pleaser. Their fried salt and pepper squid is horrible however, I wish they would figure that out because that can be a truly great dish when it is done right. We ate there tonight and tried the onion chicken with chinese sausage in claypot dish and enjoyed it a lot. My mom is a Peking duck fiend (we get the half order) and it was particularly good tonight with extra crispy skin, steaming hot soft buns, and crunchy cucumber and green onion. (This is beginning to sound like food porn).\n\nWe usually get good service, but that may be because they know us by now and are used to the massive amounts of food we order. As far as the authentic argument goes, I lived right off Clement Street for 10 years and tried every hole in the wall Dim Sum place, and there is much to be said for the cleaner environs and much better food quality at Ton Kiang. I don't miss the lovely sensation of biting into a piece of mystery meat gristle or seeing a whole piece of vein in my sui mai that I've experienced many a time at the cheaper Dim Sum places. And you absolutely see large Asian families eating at Ton Kiang - especially at night when the fuss has died down.

It seems that the reviewers who give this place anything 3 stars or under have the following problems: it's not as dirty as what they're used to, the service is actually good, the food is not as predictable, and the price is a little higher because guess what - they use better ingredients at Ton Kiang.

Not terrible, considering the crowds I see outside of it. Parking was luck-of-the-draw (on Sundays, good luck in the Richmond).\n\nSo, one asks, why the crowds? I think it's because this place is just not intimidating like other Chinese restaurants can be. There are pictures. There are English translations (that are not in Chinglish). Enough said.\n\nBUT, you can also get the hardcore stuff too (or at least what I consider hardcore.). See the chicken feet below.\n\nShrimp and Chive Dumplings: good. But at $5...? ehhhhhh\n\nChicken Feet: yay! (Apparently, I am super Chinese. Even my mom won't eat chicken feet.). These were done pretty well. Pretty easy to figure out that they are not on the menu (intimidation factor, remember?), so I had to ask for it. Of course they made a few of them, gave one to us, and then tried to shill the others out to the rest of the tables, with no success. And then they came back to our table, asking if we had ordered more.\n\nBeef Balls, Pork Spareribs: Standard stuff.\n\nSoup Dumplings: where did the soup go!? Also, I really hate the red vinegar (something off-putting about it) but I will forgive in this circumstance. Overall, mediocre. \n\nBeef (Long) Noodles: I don't know what the translation is, but in Chinese it's \"Long Noodles.\" The rice noodles are wrapped around beef. I like these better than the others in general (shrimp, dried shrimp with green onion, etc). Again, pretty run-of-the-mill.\n\nFried Taro/Pork: There was a serious lack of ground pork filling in these. \n\nWe didn't get a lot of the standard stuff (ha gao, siu mai, etc), but that's because I have limited real estate in my stomach and there were only two of us. Food was about average overall...I'd say a 3. Service was good, especially for yum cha/dim sum. The servers spoke English (actually, most of the time, they didn't even bother with the Chinese).\n\nThe thing that really got me: They charge $1 per person for tea. I'm sorry, but how do they get away with this? I think it's ridiculous. Is it just me? Serious minus points here. AND they didn't even bring the right thing!

Not necessarily because it's that good, but because Shanghai Dumpling King has gone from bad to worse and because Ton Kiang delivers. So, for all these months I've been specifying that I don't want any MSG in any of my food and they've been saying OK. Last night I placed my order and the guy says that all of their dumplings are already made with MSG and there's no way to remove it. Umm. OK. So for all this time the Ton Kiang people have been lying about their food on the phone by telling me I wasn't getting MSG in my food. No more, Ton Kiang. Not only is the food barely mediocre, but they serve shark fin soup--a definite no no for anyone who has any sense of moral or sustainable eating.", "author": "Amy B."}

I prefer to sit upstairs in the main dining area round tables, as they have the best light, and the lazy susan, perfect for sharing. \n\nIf you're there while they are serving dim sum, you are in for a treat. Typical to any dim sum, they walk around serving specific dishes and you can choose if you'd like it or to pass on it. It's really an experience, especially if it's lunchtime on a weekend. \n\nMy favorites are the bbq pork buns. To die for. But everything you can get here is delicious. I am not a big sea food fan, but everyone who is seems to particularly enjoy it here. If you're not there during dim sum, order the chicken chow mein. Also so yummy! \n\nThe only other con is that, when it's busy, the actual wait staff is spread thin, so getting refills/beverages/ordering anything can take some time, especially if you're in a corner. \n\nOverall, this is one of my very favorite spots in SF.

Quite frankly, I was doubtful about this place, having read fellow reviews.  \n\nMaybe it was the recent storms which scared people away, but we were sat within ten minutes and upstairs which was great.  \n\nThe dim sum was excellent!  We began with a dish I've never had or seen in Chinese restaurants, green tea salad.  Jeff W. correctly identified this dish as being Burmese in origin.  It's delicious!  A mixture of fermented tea leaves, chopped tomatoes, toasted sesame seeds, peanuts and finely shredded cabbage with garlic and green chilies gives this salad heat and taste.  The sticky rice is also very good.  We feasted upon veggies like dao mao (sweet pea greens) and gai lan (Chinese broccoli).  The roasted barbecue pork was a tasty mixture of fat and pork.   Other dim sum dishes like the shrimp and spinach rolls were hot and yummy as well.\n\nUsually I skip dessert at Chinese restaurants as they're just bad.  This time, a server went by with walnut buns.  Think a triangle shaped bun, golden brown with a half walnut in each side.  Inside, is a delicious walnut paste.  One bite and we ordered two more of these dishes to take home!  They're that good.  Another surprise was the mochi with custard inside.  The mochi has been lightly fried so on each side, it's golden brown and filled with custard which is warm.  The sweet chewiness of the mochi along with creamy custard made for a great mouth feel and taste!\n\nService was fine.  I find that in dim sum places it pays to be attentive and directive with the servers.  We always got what we wanted and then some.  Water and tea was refilled without our requesting it.

We went with the classic wedding set menu and switched out the whole steamed fish for fried fish pieces (she says that a lot of people don't like the oil/soy sauce that it sits in, too greasy) and the squab for something else I can't remember (everyone likes to say \"that's just a fancy word for pigeon!\"). The food was all very tasty and there were quite a few very picky foodies there who said the same. That made me happy. \n\nWhat didn't make me happy was:\n1. they only had 2 servers assigned to us and only one of them was \"offically\" ours. So that meant service was slow.\n2. the kitchen seemed to have their timings off. The head table (us) wold get something and the last table would get it roughly 20 minutes later.\n3. the parking just sucks ass! Nothing new there I realize but because it sucked so badly we started an hour later than we had planned. \n\nBut really despite all that, it was nice and it went off well. I would happily go there for dinner again but with a much smaller group of peeps.", "author": "cyndi L."}

From what I heard I expected something that was close to what you would get in Hong Kong for dim sum with a great variety.\n\nWe got there and the wait wasn't too long. About 15 minutes. The decor looks much better than most dim sum places I know. \n\nTon Kiang primarily caters to non-chinese patrons. Most of the servers don't speak Cantonese which was difficult for my parents since my Dad doesn't speak English. This added to a weirdness in the ambiance for me. \n\nThe selection of dim sum that they have is very limited to the standard items. The size of the dim sum is very small, but you can tell they take time to work on the presentation of the dim sum. \n\nOverall the dim sum is ok but pricey. I also realized I miss the typical ambiance I would expect in a dim sum joint and also a chance to flex my cantonese.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-14", "description": "Regardless of whether it serves authentic Hakka cuisine or not, Ton Kiang does serve some really good dim sum.  My family was here recently for a dim sum lunch and we walked away pretty full and happy with our choice of restaurants.\n\nI did miss the rollicking atmosphere of most dim sum places, where there's steam carts full of hot foods ready to run you down, pushed by old Chinese ladies yelling out what they have.  There's nothing like it here, where the old Chinese ladies and steam carts are replaced by trays handled by young Chinese ladies genteelly listing what they have to offer.  OK, so the clientele is also not what you normally see at dim sum places - along with one other table, we were the only Chinese people there.  But, really, the food is what matters right?  And the dim sum here at Ton Kiang is pretty darn good.\n\nTo start off, we had the ha-gow, which were a little on the small side, but filled with a good-sized whole shrimp, and the siu-mai, which were also small, but good.  I like the fact that the pork fat, which can sometimes be very evident in the fillings, were not really detectable here.  We then ended up getting things like spareribs, chicken feet, deep-fried shrimp balls, shirmp stuffed crab claws, stuffed eggplant, crispy calamari, deep-fried scallop/shrimp balls, shiao long bao, shrimp rice noodles, and sticky rice.  The chicken feet were excellent- very tender and flavorful, as were all the shrimp items.  The only disappointing items were the calamari and the shiao long bao, which had no soup at all inside, and the filling was a little mealy, rather than being firm.  The calamari was crisp, but oily and missing the kick that usually comes with the diced jalapenos served with it.  \n\nThe service was good- my water glass and tea (the one we ordered, hurng peen?, was really good) were always re-filled promptly and the food came out in a nice, steady pace.  Yes, the portions all tend to be on the small side and it is a little pricey, but the food was good.  Nothing was really overwhelmingly fatty or greasy, even with all the deep-fried items we had.  I just wish that Ton Kiang would have a larger dim sum variety, such as tripe, beef stew, daikon cakes, and pork blood, which admittedly is hard to find and would probably freak the non-Asians out.\n\nOverall, a good bet for dim sum.  Parking was not difficult, at least if you get there early and we were seated as soon as we got in.  I'll definitely be back for more dim sum, as well as to try the dinner selection of Hakka specialties, to judge for myself, whether its authentic or not.", "author": "Angela H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-09-18", "description": "I've always enjoyed Panda Express' orange chicken but at the same time, I've always had two questions in regards to the chicken.\n\n1.  Is Panda Express' slogan \"Gourmet Chinese Food\" really appropriate?\n\n2.  Is Panda Express' orange chicken really the best?  \n\nTo answer these perplexing questions, I had a chance to try the gourmet (the waiters wear fancy shirts) Chinese restaurant, Ton Kiang's, orange chicken tonight.  Finally I would be able to at least know if Panda Express' orange chicken rang supreme, and if it truly had the same taste as gourmet Chinese food.\n\nThe Scorecard based on Gourmet (1. Freshness, 2. Quality) and Taste (1.Texture, 2. Flavor) was as followed:\n\n                           Panda Express          Ton Kiang\n\nFreshness                                                  x\n\nTon Kiang tasted like it was freshly made where I've seen the Panda chicken sometimes hang out in the tray for about as long as it takes me to run a half marathon, and no, I'm not Kenyan.  Panda's orange chicken occasionally tastes like it has been sitting in the tray for some time as the sauce is no longer a smooth glaze but rather almost entirely absorbed in the chicken.\n\nQuality                                                         x\n\nAgain, this is one of Panda Express' weaker categories.  I'm not saying the quality is bad at Panda's but I don't get the impression that it is good quality either as it's probably best to eat the chicken with your eyes closed instead of analyzing the type of meat inside.  Ton Kiang served quality slices of chicken that appeared to be all white meat.\n\nTexture                        x\n\nThis is where Panda turns it up a notch.  I like the crunchy texture of Panda's orange chicken.  It's like KFC popcorn chicken meets sweet orange flavored sauce and has a beautiful child Orange Chicken Jr.  Ton Kiang's texture was a let down as the chicken was too lightly breaded and the chicken swam in the sauce.  Panda's more heavily breaded orange chicken absorbs the sauce enhancing the flavor of each bite of chicken, breading, and sauce in unity.\n\nFlavor                          x\n\nI liked Panda's sauce a lot better.  Ton Kiang took a little creative license and made a spicy orange sauce but the mixture of spice and orange didn't win me over.  On the other hand, Panda takes a sweet orange sauce approach to their dish that is delicious.\n\n\n\nFinal Results:  \n\nWhich is more gourmet?\n\nPanda's Express' slogan \"Gourmet Chinese\" food seems a little far fetched since Ton Kiang just seemed much more gourmet, and it wasn't just the fancy shirts the waiters wear at Ton Kiang.  The restaurant scored significantly higher in both the freshness and quality categories.\n\nWhich tasted better?\n\nAs far as taste, Panda Express' orange chicken still ranks supreme with me scoring superior in the texture and flavor categories.", "author": "Josh K."}

I think everything on the menu was a mockery of  the very concept of kosher.  Pork this, crab that, shrimp EVERYTHING (or so it seemed)... but the food was reasonably tasty, and while it was overpriced for what we received, the experience itself was fun.  In retrospect, the food was like most other greasy Chinese take-out places I've tried.  Certainly nothing to write home about.\n\nMost of the dishes ranged from $3 - $4.75, but a few were $5.75.  One of which included some wok-fried baby bok choy.  How in the hell does a pork dumpling cost $3 but some green veggies cost double?  Someone clue me in on that one.  The total cost of our meal for three, including two hot tea orders was  $54.

I know for sure there are other places in San Francisco that probably have better dumplings, but for a neighborhood pit stop, Ton Kiang hits the spot.", "author": "Mirabella C."}

In its heydey, it would have a long wait out the door for its scrumptiously delicate dim sum that came hot of the kitchen. The last time I experienced that level of food was in June 2008. Sadly that is no more. There is no wait and because of that, the same food rotates among the one floor (not the usual two floors) that is open. The selection is significantly limited and gone are the special items I raved about such as the large steamed oysters and the fried tofu. I have moved on to greener dim sum pastures where the dim sum quality makes up for the long wait.", "author": "Gwen L."}

I love the way that they prepare their fried rice, it's more moist than the other fried rice dishes I've had at other restaurants.  \n\nThis place is always packed, but it's a two-story restaurant which makes the restaurant deceptively larger than it seems when peering into the window.", "author": "Amy T."}

Greasy!!!\n--Don Tah (egg custard tarts):  Yummy!\n--Jin Doy (sesame balls):  So sweet! \n--Nai Wong Siu Ben (egg custard rice cakes):  Surprisingly, my fav.

The waitstaff is very friendly and speaks English a lot better than one would imagine.

Eating these was most likely how Buddha got fat.  The $6 order consists of two claws (not sure what kind of crab, not Dungeness) dressed in a generous globe of chopped shrimp, and a lightly breaded, delightfully deep-fried coating.  The first bite gives one (ME!) the perfect contrast of sweet crabmeat with savory shrimp, and upon my last visit for some to-go dim sum, had me happy tooling down Geary Street with steering wheel in one hand, napkin in the other, and crab pincers coming out of my mouth (have you been to this area?

Suddenly, my son developed hives all over his face and neck.   We assumed that it was something that he ate (he hadn't eaten anything that day until the restaurant).  I rushed him to a drugstore for benadryl.  After taking it, we returned to the restaurant.  I approached the owner--he is the one who stands at the cashier area--and told him I'm a frequent visitor to his restaurant.  I told him what happened and asked him about the ingredients because it would be good to have some idea of the allergen, e.g. was it the shrimp, do they use oyster sauce, do they put crab meat in some of the diim sum items?  He seemed put off but answered my questions.  He didn't ask exactly which dishes we ordered, which could easily be done by checking our bill.  (I had to ask him to look at our bill to see what dishes we ate.)  I was shocked that he never expressed any concern about my son, and even though I asked him to talk with him directly about what he might've eaten (my son was sitting with my mother in a booth), he refused to leave the cashier area.  He said, \"he can come to talk to me.\"\n\nHe didn't show a shred of concern about the health and welfare of a customer.

I've not been to TK in several years but suffice to say it has always been an old standby for my family, greatly appreciated and enjoyed.   As I sat myself down for a much anticipated meal, I cracked Yelp to glean some current commentary which I now know was a silly and useless move.  I was bothered to see a number of more recent and harsh 1 and 2 star critiques that makes the present day incarnation of this restaurant seem as though Rome has fallen on Geary Street.  I  write this review as I eat my meal, and for the first time ever (regarding Yelp) feel the need to counter the aforementioned opinions with just-plain-fact.  As I do so, I'm reminded of two universal and ever-more-apparent truths: 1) Democracy is best executed without involvement of the masses, and 2) Opinions are like a**holes. Everyone has one.  \n\nHere is the truth.  The restaurant serves food today that is as tasty and high-quality as in ANY previous incarnation / dynasty.   I have eaten here off and on for many years, and know of what I speak.  Further. The service is stellar, with kind waiters and servers eager to please and respond. Turnaround is quick.  Lastly. for all the negative reviews which I assume has helped to direct the hoards away from TK to Hong Kong Lounge nearby (lines used to be out the door, with 20 minute waits not uncommon,) one now has a chance to be quickly seated and enjoy a meal that remains stellar.  The negative whining reminds me of why the opinions of many current San Franciscans - on ANY TOPIC OF IMPORT - should get a unanimous half star vote as it's own Yelp category.   Give these guys a break.  EAT HERE.  You'll be glad you did.", "author": "Brad S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-25", "description": "Today is a Sunday and I just came back from eating dim sum here. We couldn't decide between this restaurant or Hong Kong Lounge. We haven't tried either before. We drove by Ton Kiang and saw that there was nobody waiting outside the restaurant, which we thought was a bit strange at 10:30am on a Sunday morning. We decided to drive over to Hong Kong Lounge and there were about 30 people waiting outside, mostly Chinese. We thought, \"Hong Kong Lounge MUST be good if there were so many people waiting.\" However the wait was 1/2 hour-1 hour so we decided to just go back to Ton Kiang since it got good reviews on Yelp and we had to be somewhere else by noon. We were seated immediately at Ton Kiang. As soon as I sat down and looked around, I already had a bad feeling....\n\n1) I am Chinese and realized that we were the ONLY table of Chinese people seated on the upstairs level. And that is not an exaggeration. 80% of the tables were filled with Caucasians, while the others were Japanese, Filipino, and Hispanic. I don't have anything against other ethnicities at a Chinese restaurant but when there are NO Chinese people at a Chinese restaurant, ESPECIALLY a dim sum restaurant, that is a red flag...aka TOURIST restaurant. \n2) We would see the same food every 10 minutes.\n3) The waitresses shouted out the food names in ENGLISH. BIG red flag. This is the first time I've seen this at a Chinese dim sum restaurant and another sign of a tourist restaurant. How weird to hear things like \"Soft Shell Crab and Tea Leaf Salad\" which are not traditionally dim sum and not even traditionally Chinese.\n4) There was a limited selection of dishes, maybe only 20 different dishes, so I had to special order some that were typical dishes such as taro cake, shrimp dumplings, egg custard tarts, and service was VERY slow to bring out those dishes. We wanted egg custard tarts for dessert and I had to ask 3 different waiters to remind them, and half an hour later and still no tarts, we were impatient and decided to just ask for the check. It wasn't until after I had received the check that they brought out the tarts so we said forget it.\n5) They took away our entire teapot half an hour before we left and never brought it back with tea. It wasn't until the busboy started to clean our table that he noticed we had no tea at all.\n6) On our way out, we noticed that the downstairs level had more Chinese people, so we wondered if they seated on the English speaking customers upstairs where there are English speaking waitresses who shouted out dim sum in English *shakes head.*\n\n\nSo how was the food? It was only okay and I've had a lot better. The Xiao Long Bao, or the Shanghainese dumplings did not have any juice in them, the onion pancake was underfried, and the shrimp cheurng fun had tiny pieces of shrimp. I have had better dim sum from a dim sum bakery. \n\nPrice of dim sum: $3-$6 per dish. We ordered about 12 dishes and our bill came out to $43 pre-tax.\n\nWould I go back? No, probably not. Going to try Hong Kong Lounge next time.\n\nWould I recommend this place? Chinese people would be disappointed. I suspect this place has a lot of reviews and many which are good because the people here on Yelp are not elderly Chinese grandparents who've truly eaten and know good dim sum and the qualities of a good and authentic dim sum restaurant. Tourists or people who don't speak Chinese would probably enjoy this restaurant a lot more. By the time we left the restaurant at 12, all the tables were full but still no wait for tables.", "author": "Erika C."}

Where do I start?\n\nFirst of all, you know it's strange when you go to a dim sum place and half the patrons are white.  That's a bad sign already.  Usually, you know a chinese place is good when it's filled with asians.  Not to be racists, but Chinese people such as myself -  1) Know good chinese food and 2) are cheap and will go to places that are either a good value or so good that they can overlook the price.\n\nWhen I go out for dim sum, I want good food at a decent value.  I don't go to a place because I hear that it's the happening place to go for dim sum.  That said, the dim sum at Ton Kiang is actually pretty good.  The prices are pretty outrageous for dim sum if you order individual items ($5 to $7 a dish), but it's more affordable if you pick their set of 9 items for $38.  You get to select any 9 items off their menu, and it even includes items not on the standard menu, but then you have to ask for them specifically.  For example, chicken feet and shrimp rice rolls and included, but you need to ask for it.  It's still on the pricier side for dim sum, but it's do-able.  Definitely go with at least the 9 course, because you'll need to eat at least that many dishes to be full.  The portions are pretty small here.  The har gow (shrimp dumplings) taste good, but they're only half the size of Hong Kong's Lounge's same dish.  The other dumplings and dishes are the same story; everything is tasty, but a smaller version of Hong Kong Lounge's dishes.  Some things actually taste a little bit better here, but I kinda feel gyped when it costs more here and is smaller.  After all, there are also other dishes that are better at Hong Kong Lounge.  \n\nOther than the dim sum, we also ordered half of a Peking Duck.  The skin and meat of the duck tasted very good, but there were so many crushed bones everywhere!  I don't mind bones, but when it's all crushed and chopped, it's hard to separate it from the meat and inevitably I bit into a few bone fragments.  Last time I had Peking duck somewhere else, it was boneless, and for a place like Ton Kiang that caters to Caucasians, I expected the duck to be boneless as well, lol.", "author": "Tyler C."}

They mix it right at the table.  But their more traditional dim sum are average--not bad, just not outstanding.  If you're in the city and want a sit-down dim sum experience, Ton Kiang is fine.

I think it's worth the wait.  My favorite dim sum item is the stuffed mushroom caps.  Delicious.\n\n***Edit***\nAvoid the salt-baked chicken.  The menu claims that it is a specialty, but it's bad.  The chicken skin, which is is very limp and fatty, features much too prominently.  Plus, I hate to be a spoil-sport, but I think they should season chicken with more than a dump truck load of salt.", "author": "Joe R."}

I love the stuff, and have eaten it from countless sources throughout my life. I've had it from street vendors, bakeries, low end dives, and fancy palaces of dining. None come close to Ton Kiang-- the most delicately prepared, tasty, clean dim sum I've ever eaten.\n\nThey offer a wide variety. They serve it at all times, so even if you come at dinner time you can order it. They don't have leftovers sitting around, either-- they make it fresh to order.\n\nMy online moniker, Peasprout, was chosen due to the deliciousness of Ton Kiang's preparation of the vegetable of the same name.\n\nIt can be difficult to park in the area on a busy morning, and you can sometimes be forced to wait some time for a table, but piffle I say. I'd wait twice as long, and walk twice as far from the car to eat this stuff.\n\nI seldom order anything other than Dim Sum, but when I have I've been pleased. The steamed fish, always a good indicator of a Chinese restaurant's worth, is spectacular.", "author": "Greg G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-19", "description": "When I stepped into this joint, I thought to myself \"Awesome! Hakka cuisine! My people!\"  I've never been to a restaurant that serves Hakka food.  Only authentic Hakka I've ever had was when I visited relatives back in Taiwan or in the comfort of my mom's kitchen!\n\nSo what IS \"HAKKA\" food?!?!\n\nWith the help of my mom's expertise in this subject matter, I'll help you understand!!   Chinese cuisine 101!  So different cuisines of Chinese food represent people from different geographic areas.  As most ppl know, Schezuan is an area where the people like to cook things really spicy!  Guangdong food is your well-known dimsum.  Shanghai food tends to be sweet.  So what about Hakka?  Well, Hakka food tends to be salty with low fat/oil content.  Hakkas value simplicity in their dishes so you won't be served a dish with too many ingredients.  Historical reason for this was that Hakka ppl were nomadic and poor so they only could eat simple things and flavor their food with salt.  So for example, a good dish is eggplant w/ fresh parsley.  Unlike schezuan eggplant where it's drenched in a thick starchy spicy sauce, the hakka version has a very light sauce over lightly sauteed eggplant seasoned with salt and fresh parsley.\n\nOK, now back to the food at Tom Kiang.  True hakka cuisine has no dim sum.  Why...is there dim sum here? And why are they known for their dim sum?  My parents were totally puzzled.  Instead of ordering dimsum, we ordered their traditional Hakka dishes.  Beware that not all their entrees are Hakka!  Only a hand full of them are authentic Hakka.  **EDIT UPDATE: Dad came home and was able to help me out remembering some of the dishes.  1 dish was the Braised Meat-Stuffed Tofu.  It's authentic Hakka and it's pretty good.  Another really tasty dish was the Orange Chicken.  It's deliciously crispy, but it's not Hakka.**\n\nMy parents and I really liked the food here; the quality and authenticity was really superb.  We all rated this place 4 stars.  My 2 friends who were also with us did try some dimsum (just the shao mai); they were ok.  (What's cute was that for their dim sum menu, they have cartoon figures of the different dimsum items so you don't have to know their names.  You just point and order.)\n\nI have two noteworthy complaints about this place:\n1) WAY too overpriced for their small portion sizes.  This applies to both the entrees and dimsum.  You might leave hungry still if you're concerned about not spending much money.  Chinese food is supposed to be cheap; Chinese families are traditionally poor and huge.  Need more food to feed everyone without going bankrupt.\n2) Parking sucksssssss.", "author": "Michael P."}

Very rarely does a restaurant excel at both, and Ton Kiang is one of those exceptions. We had a large group of people and ordered a lot of food. The boys loved the General Tso's, and Sweet and Sour Chicken (I didn't taste it -breaded and fried chicken is not for me but I trusted everyone else loved it because they were just about licking the plates clean). The beef with green beans was great, as was (surprisingly) the tofu and eggplant veggie dish. But my favorite was a dinner special, prawns with sugar snap peas.

How could something that (literally translated) means 'to touch your heart' end up crushing my spirit? This restaurant is messed up on so many levels. \n\n1) $3, $4, $5, $6--are these prices for real?  I read that this place was \"overpriced,\" but if I knew I would pay $6 for two servings of lo mai gai (chicken w/ sticky rice in lotus leaf) I would've brought monopoly money because this is clearly a joke. $1.00 for a cup of tea. $.50 for water. WATER. Who charges for water?? I should've gone into the bathroom and drunk from under the faucet for free. \n\n2) Make no mistake, I am not a cheap-o. This review isn't just about the price. Had the food been DOUBLY good, it would've been worth it. But was it doubly good? No. Was it even good? N-O. In general, the flavor was mediocre. Chicken feet was alright, though excessive use of cornstarch made it gooey. Fried squid was cold. (Isn't that an oxymoron?) Cold dim sum is a nightmare. I was pleased to discover they served wu gok (fried taro), but the meat filling was scant and the taro bland. \n\n3) Am I a giant, or did the food suddenly shrink? I laughed when I saw the gau choy gwor (chive and shrimp dumplings) because they were about the size of quarters. Cute miniature edibles include: baby tomatoes, brussels sprouts, and mandarin oranges. Never dim sum.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-04-25", "description": "Correction, that's actually 0 stars. Or negative. I could go that way too. There is WAY too much hype for this place. Before I left in disgust, I had four frowny points. It wasn't bad execution, its just bad basis. (note: this review is for people who have had dim sum before. if you have never had dim sum and Asia seems like a crazy exotic land, hey, you might enjoy the dim sum here. As we were walking out, my boyfriend noted to me that the owners must be evil genius masterminds to have had such great reviews, which we verily assumed were written by people who do not frequent dim sum restaurants often...if ever.) \n\nFirst impressions and Points:\n1. Wow, pretty clean. Wait, is that a wine bar?! What the heck Chinese restaurant sells wine?! hm. something seems off. I tell the waitress two people (in Cantonese no less) and she tells me \"Upstairs\". No wait? No frantic yelling of numbers and nosy parents peeking at the list? Hm.\n2. Sit down at a table, look around. Hm. Is it telling that we're the only table of Asian people here? Where are all the carts?\n3. Gah! It's a continual carousel of English-only ladies carrying trays of food. They perch their tray on our table every 30 seconds and ask \"Shrimp dumpling? Steamed Asparagus? Tea Leaf Salad?\" While trying to hold a conversation we have to keep stopping to say No thanks, no thanks. \n4. After we had ordered two dishes, we were still waiting for someone to ask us what kind of tea. I finally flag down a waiter, and he drops by the table. I say \"Tea, please, I'd like to order some Bo--\" \"Just green tea\" and zip he's gone. What the hell? Come back dude, I didn't tell you what kind I want. Green tea?! What?! It took another eight minutes for him to come back with a teapot of green tea and a dish of chinese mustard and salsa verde. What?! Salsa? Where's my tortilla chips? I'm so confused.\n5. Ordered a plate of shrimp wrapped in rice noodle sheets. (haw cheung fun). She stamps it in the $5 category. No freakin' way. $5 for a dinky plate? Ugh, plus we found a hair steamed into the rice noodle. We called the manager over and she replaced it with another one. That was nice, but still ew, a hair in the noodle?! I'd expect the same dish maybe $3 or $4 at other places. When you order a lot of dim sum, that dollar difference really adds up.\n6. The dim sum was okay, nothing fantastic or terrible. If anything I was mystified by the offerings. Vegetarian egg rolls? Steamed asparagus? Tea leaf salad? (i know burma superstar is popular but really now...) There's standard fare, but the plate of four small steamed shrimp dumplings (har gow) was $4. We ordered five dishes and our bill came to $23 plus tax and tip. \n7. Are they playing bamboo flute music in the background?!\n\nUgh. I do have to finish up by saying that I don't think these are all awful things. I don't reaaally blame the restaurant. I blame Yelp and the SF Chron, and other food reviewers, and my own gullibility. I was the one who chose to come to this restaurant. I just don't think its the right place for me. I prefer Cantonese Dim Sum places that are boisterous and loud, full of rolling carts and hostesses with walkie-talkies in hand. Delicious dim sum that will totally fill you up for just $8-11 a person. A choice of the tea, and mustard and chili sauce. Traditional dim sum and new innovations for dim sum like shrimp and mango dumplings. \n\nHowever, if you do not know dim sum at all, or you want to really slowly bring some new sheep to the fold, or being in a restaurant full of loud Chinese families scares you, this is probably a great place for you. No, seriously. There's a picture menu with the dim sum in english and chinese, there are lots of english-speaking waitresses who come to you, who you don't have to wave down half the room away, and you can pay the high price and feel good for trying something new. \n\nJust don't go if you're someone like me, who likes the old traditional way of dim sum.\n\n*Granted, I am saying this as a second generation Cantonese-speaking lady who has had experience with fantastic dim sum in the city. Go to Clement Street, or Daly City, or anywhere. Eat more dim sum!", "author": "Jade L."}

It was super clean, to the point of feeling sterile. It was also quiet enough to hear a pin drop. We felt like we had to whisper to be polite. Anyone who has eaten *real* dim sum knows the overall environment is part of the experience. It's supposed to be loud...and moving really fast around you. There was no life here...and it was jarring. \n\nFood:\nI can deal with an \"off\" environment if the food knocks me out, but it didn't here. The dim sum was mostly lacking in flavor - I think salt specifically. The only thing that was good was the chicken feet. Our guess is it was ultra fresh since 95% of the diners were non-Asian and unlikely to order this dish. Sounds stereotypical, but no one had this dish except us, so call it real life market research.  Oh did I mention its a bit spendy too? All that aside, one good dish out of 10+ is really unfortunate.  We were so bummed when we left, we went to a couple places on Clement to get *real* dim sum to make our drive out to the Richmond semi-worth our while. \n\nService:\nService was fine, but very strange. The poor wait staff is forced to speak this very uncomfortable English to everyone. My wife even ordered in Chinese only to be responded to in English. WTF? She commented we were being served by Stepford Wives, which pretty much hit it on the head.\n\nAgain, I have no idea what the hype is about, and even more confusion how this ends up on the Chron's Top 100 every year. Maybe this is a decent starter dim sum place for those who may feel intimidated or overwhelmed by most other dim sum houses that are way more hectic and frantic?

Alas, I was equally hugely disappointed.  Mediocre dim sum, sloppy service, excessively high prices - in a word, go somewhere else.\n\nThe problems started at the door - three different staff people asked us how many were in our party and then disappeared.  After several minutes a fourth person asked us the same question, then took us upstairs, where we stood around for another ten minutes before a fifth person (I kid you not) finally seated us.  Our waiter then took the order of the party that was seated *after* us before taking ours; got said order wrong (bringing both a dish we hadn't ordered and Diet Coke instead of Coke); and seemed to think his incompetence was funny (he had a really irritating giggle which was apparently his attempt to compensate for a limited vocabulary) rather than reprehensible.\n\nOK, it was a busy night in a popular restaurant; much can be forgiven if the food is outstanding, or even good.  Alas, it wasn't.  Not even close.  Several items were fine, but no better than at many other dim sum places in SF, and significantly more expensive; some were not only more expensive but distinctly worse.  I was especially keen to try the roasted oysters (on the regular menu, not the dim sum) because it's a dish I love that I've had many times at my favorite dim sum place (MFDSP), and my friends (who've also had them there) swore that Ton Kiang's were as good or better.  Wrong.  They were almost cold, rubbery, tasteless, and $13.  At MFDSP (oh, all right, it's Happy Garden on Clement), they've invariably been hot, crisp, delicious, and $8.50.\n\nJustice requires that I report that Ton Kiang was packed to the doors the whole time we were there, so they're obviously doing something right by somebody.  Not by me, though.  And, not to play the race card, but nearly all the customers (my party included) were visibly non-Chinese.  If you think there's a correlation between a restaurant's success in cooking the food associated with a particular ethnicity and its ability to attract customers of the same ethnicity, then you may not be surprised by what seems to me to be Ton Kiang's regrettable failure on both counts.\n\nsee you at Happy Garden.", "author": "Steven B."}

No one here seemed to speak ANY English, which was fine by me - more authentic that way. I kept waiting for someone to bring me a menu, but instead all of these women just kept coming over and offering me things. Things I had never seen. Things with dubious ingredients that looked much too much like they did when they were removed from the animals they were attached to. Being a polite Indiana boy, I took almost everything they brought me and tried it. Then they kind of stopped coming around and someone brought me the check. HOLY CRAP! How in the hell did I spend that much money on lunch? I thought it was like a buffet - all you can eat for one price! Wow, I guess not.\nThat was my first dim sum experience. I have since moved to sunny California and embraced the tradition that is dim sum. Ton Kiang is a great, reasonably priced place to go in the city if you want good dim sum.\nThe food is good- really good. I especially like...well I like a lot of things that I know how to say phonetically, but will not butcher their names here trying to spell them.\nIf you go, try to sit near the kitchen, especially when its busy. If you are to far to the front, everything you want is gone by the time the girls make it back to you. \nParking is really difficult. Try to take the 38 bus if you can.\nAlso, they charge PER ITEM! It is not all you can eat! :)\nCheck it out.", "author": "Jamie M."}

He told me that Ton Kiang serves \"THE BEST\" dim sum he's ever had.  I was suspicious at first, but he persuaded me that with his upbringing in Marin, he was exposed to ALL sorts of extraordinary Asian food, and he KNEW dim sum.\n\nFirst dish he ordered - potstickers.  I knew that I was in trouble.  Not a type of trouble that I could casually eat my way through.  I was in DEEP DOO-DOO.  As I sank deeper and deeper into my vinyl chair, depression set in.  How was I going to get out of this while gracefully convincing him that I deserved a second date?  After all, he was a nice-looking guy who seemed genuinely interested in impressing me.  Sigh, the romantic dance that we all engage in.  Don't really want him, but want him to want me.\n\nPotstickers weren't so bad - IF THEY WERE GOOD.  Unfortunately, they were not.  The little lump of meat inside was securely wrapped in a THICK inpenetrable layer of panfried dough.\n\nIf you don't know the difference between a good potsticker and a bad potsticker - the dough is supremely important.  You want the dough to be thin and translucent yet strong enough to hold the filling.  Same for dumplings.  If the dumpling looks like the delicious filling inside is about to burst through its skin, then that's a SUPREME dumpling.  Where is the art in having such a thick dough that NOTHING (not even a hammer) will pierce it?\n\nLong story short - I never went back to Ton Kiang again.  And I couldn't contain myself.

My first impression was this is not our type of restaurant, there weren't any Chinese in there, don't get me wrong, but when Chinese people eat Chinese food, they usually go to places where there are tons of Chinese sitting, eating and jabbing.  So we ordered the braised pork, their specialty chicken, which is frozen chicken and a dish of veggies.......I did notice that the place was kind of packed, and that almost every table had dim sum, I thought that was kind of cool, and this is at 9:30 at nite.  Waiters were same as any other Chinese palces except that the vests they wore were much cleaner...lol, aside from that, this guy and girl waiter were speaking in Chinese saying they charged someone $10.00 for candles and started laughing....I guess they forgot we were there, anyways, I feel sorry for the customer that got stuped into paying that......", "author": "Leslie Y."}

Though not extremely recent, I believe that it is relevant. \n\nOriginally Review: 6-13-06\n\n\"Took the wifey and 3 yr old after reading numerous reviews raving about how good this is. Was disappointed and underwhelmed by our experiment. Should have listened to my warning bells when we sat down and realized that the restaurant was clearly not marketing to the Asian demographic. The Dim Sum was above average but certainly no where close to being the \"best of the city\". It lacks true authenicity due to its leanings toward a more Western palate. Service was outstanding, as was the ambiance / dining area. The bathroom, though better than average for a chinese restaurant, did not match how nice the rest of the restaurant is. The restaurant has a premium aire, with premium service, and premium presentation. Unfortunately, it also comes with a PREMIUM price. The 3 of us left hungry after paying $50. Its a good restaurant to come to if you're looking to impress people who have never had dim sum. But for the experienced, this restaurant is simply an expensive meal for only average food.\"", "author": "Dennis Y."}

The won ton noodles in my soup(which used to be the best in the city) were smaller and more doughy.  The sticky rice had no essence of the leaf that was surrounded the rice.  It took 1 hour for a shrimp dumpling to come by the table.  I had to actually flag down one of the servers as she passed our table with a cart like we werent even there.  Not a single plate was picked up the whole time we were there and of course the water cups stayed empty.  What a shame that what used to be such a solid dim sum place has fallen so far.

But waiting to be seated is a pain because of their \"seating\" strategy (big party has the priority and there are not many small tables).  Reservation is not available for two people.   So if just for two people, a wait for at least 30 minutes is normal during the weekend lunch hour. That is the only reason I take off 1 star.  The dim sum is delicious and worthy of the wait though.  We like the \"pea tips shrimp ball\" which has snow peas inside the shrimp ball.  IMO, it tastes better than the regular shrimp ball with vegetable add-ins, fresh, crispy and not so meaty.  A few more good choices include \"egg custard rice cake\", \"Mango pudding\" (as dessert), \"BBQ port bun\".

The first time I went there was in 96, and it did live up to its reputation. Let me go through one by one why it doesn't make the cut.\n\n1) Harkow - shrimp dumpling. As a dimsum addict, let me divulge a little secret of how to judge a good dimsum place. Order Harkow as a test. A good harkow should encompass chewy, juicy shrimp in the RIGHT proportion with bamboo shoots, and most importantly, the transparent skin in which the content is wrapped has to be thin and elastic, so that when you pick up the shrimp dumpling from the bamboo container, the skin MUST NOT break. If it breaks, try another dimsum place next time.\n\nWhy is this so important? I am not being snobbish, but Harkow cooking skill is the single most applicable platform for making all dimsums. If you don't get Harkow right, you won't get shiumai right, nor will you get chuengfan (rice rolls) right. \n\nWhat happened at Ton Kiang? Harkow is most definitely a disgrace, the skin is broken before my chopsticks touched it. That means, when steaming, the juice evaporates and my shrimp meat loses its flavor! As expected, everything in that arena came out sub par.\n\n2) BBQ Buns - Cha Shiu Pao. What makes a good BBQ bun? The right fermentation to make white, soft, sublimely sweet flour bun wrapping the RIGHT amount of BBQ pork in its own sublimely sweet and salty juice. What can break it? Bad bun that is not properly raised, or BBQ pork that was left over from previous nights. That was exactly what I got at Ton Kiang.\n\n3) Pork and shrump wrapped in tofu skin - this is a category by itself because it involves another type of skill, steaming tofu skin wrap. This  perhaps sounds easy, but since tofu skin has a certain firmness, and if you oversteam it, it tends to fall apart before getting into your mouth. You also need to make sure that the content within the tofu skin is cooked just right, because the textures of tofu skin is obviously different from that of shrimp and pork meat, so pre-treating one element before the other is very important. Hence, when steamed, both the tofu skin and the content inside can arrive the desired tenderness at the same time. Ton Kiang failed in this miserably.\n\n4) Steamed beef ball - This is a highly desired delicatessen if you do it right. The beef should NOT be all lean, some portion of fat needs to be  mixed in to give it tenderness, and careful beating of the beef patty is a requirement to force air into it so that when steamed, the beef ball will expand, allowing more air particles inside to make it taste softer. Last but not the least, it should only be steamed to the extent that the outside is fully cooked while the core is just a tad bit red, a tad bit, so that the outside is crunchy while the inside is, well, tender. \n\nTon Kiang cooked the beef ball as if the it was boiled instead of carefully steamed.\n\n5) This category will be the least concerns for all non-Chinese. Chicken feet. You dimsum fanatic out there must know what well-cooked chicken feet are. Ton Kiang overcooked them too much that the steamed chicken feet came swimming in a soup of themselves decomposed to the extent of beyond recognition.\n\nI live in South Bay, and I find Ton Kiang's reputation as the best dimsum restaurant in the Bay Area to be completely bogus. We have plenty of much more superior dimsum places in the South Bay, Hong Kong Flower Lounge in Palo Alto, Dynasty and Joy Luck Place of Cupertino, ABC Seafood of Milpitas, just to name a few.\n\nThe recent visit I paid to Ton Kiang will very likely to be my last.", "author": "Jessy S."}

Today, I decided to give it another chance.  It was even worse than before and I can say without a doubt that I will NEVER go back again.  The absolute worst Shanghai dumplings that I've ever tasted - thick dumpling skin, dry/no soup inside, might have even been frozen/from the store.  Subtracting one star.  \n\n----\n\nIt is with some sadness that I write this review.  I've been a loyal customer of Ton Kiang for years.  Today I had, without a doubt, the worst meal there I've ever had.  The recipes for a number of my favorite dishes appeared to have changed - for the cheaper.  There were fewer black mushrooms in the green bean dish and the BBQ pork buns had almost no filling...and what there was didn't have much flavor.  It's almost like someone in the back office finished their MBA and decided to put all that good book larnin' to work by cutting back on the quality of the product in a bunch of \"small, undetectable ways\".   Well, I for one noticed.  Maybe there is a new owner or they lost their best kitchen staff or something but, whatever it is I'm not going back.  This place has totally jumped the shark in my opinion.", "author": "Joseph S."}

However, my experience on New Years Day was excellent.  The Dim Sum was very good, the service was responsive. Here's the lowdown:\n- Sticky Rice with meat wrapped in lotus leaf -- good quality leaves made the lotus flavor subtle -- highly recommended\n- Pork Buns -- very light and tasty, many places get these simple buns wrong (meaning the dough is too heavy, resulting in lost flavor) - highly recommended\n- Dumplings: shrimp with chives, shrimp with shitake mushrooms, pork \"cups\" ---all very fine quality\n- BONUS -- the green chile sauce was excellent and they happily made me up a little bit to take home with my leftovers\n- dessert -- the sesame balls were good, although I like them a little more \"toasted,\" the rice flour pastry covered custards were fabulous...like little marshmallows filled with custard -- pretty decent tapioca too -- all of this is gravy, since most dim sum places the dessert is best avoided. \nAll in all, very good.

Admittedly, there may be (probably are?) better dim sum joints in town, but I go to Ton Kiang.  The food is good, the servers are nice and that's enough for me.  \nToday, my mother-in-law and I went for the parade of food and I noticed something.  The second floor dining room is a disaster: a nursing-home stench, peeling paint, unpainted patches of spackle and just an overall rundown appearance.  The first floor is decent, but the top floor is a hot mess.  I was reminded of that wreck of a singer, Amy Winehouse.  She stumbles onto the stage, high on crack and with scratches, bruises and track marks all over her body and then just starts belting it out with this amazing voice.  The second-floor dining room is a little like that: it looks a mess, but the food is still really good. \nMoral of the story: if you're trying to impress someone (but not that much), jockey for a table on the first floor.  If you just don't care and want yummy dim sum and swift service, eat on the second floor.  The food still tastes good up there, too!", "author": "Lauren M."}

However, we still have not made a dent in the vast number of dishes at Ton Kiang, so I need to get back there and try the rest very soon.

I also like the dim sum sized plates of steamed vegetables, and the plates with fresh fruit.  The vegetables and fruit are a nice contrast to all the dumplings, buns, and noodles.  I am not fond of Ton Kiang's pot stickers, or their pork sui mai, nor do I like their spinach and shrimp dumplings.  The meat in the pot stickers was minced too fine, and seemed  undercooked.  The pork sui mai had more shrimp than pork in its filling.  At every dim sum restaurant, we always ask, and are always told they have pork sui mai, but I have not tasted a real pork sui mai for at least 20 years.  I am not sure what happened to that traditional pork dumpling, but it seems to no longer exist.  I have yet to find a spinach and shrimp dumpling that can hold a candle to the one made at the Empress Pavilion in Los Angeles.  The egg puffs rolled in sugar (they call them donuts here) were served so cold, that I thought they might have been chilled.  Most of the dim sum is acceptable, it just is not memorable.", "author": "Vicki T."}

However, \"the best dim sum in San Francisco\" it is NOT. Ton Kiang is more popular with non Chinese or those who grew up outside of Hong Kong or China. It is non-threatening and offers a sort of comforting assurance that if you do not speak the language, you'll still be okay here. What stands out with Ton Kiang is that during dim sum it offers many small platters of otherwise a la carte menu items for patrons to sample. It is easier to just 'taste' a small plate and leave it if you don't like it, but to order an a la carte item you have no prior knowledge of? Many sauces are offered also for your dim sum (definitely NOT traditional, but I guess that's not Ton Kiang's intention).

We were hungry and almost decided to turn around and leave. Finally we saw someone pulled out of a parking spot one block away. We rushed to the restaurant. The first floor was almost full and someone was waiting for a table. The staff asked if we would mind being seated upstairs. Of course we didn't mind. Food was our priority. \n\nOn the second floor: The smell was good; the waiter was professional and friendly; the ambiance was-- extremely noisy. Since it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese restaurant, we chose to ignore the noise. The dim sum menu looked lovely but it was late and we wanted something warm and filling. There were several dishes that looked good at the time; we finally decided on mu-shu pork, crispy gray sole (whole fish), braised oxtail and brown rice. Everything was fine but not great: The mu-shu pork was salty and had a burnt flavor, three of the six wraps were torn before we opened them up (a sign of previously frozen?); the gray sole was a little bit greasy, and the oxtail was too sweet for my taste. I don't know if we were just too hungry or were in a very good mood, even with all the imperfections, we still considered it a pretty decent dinner and plan to go back for their dim sum next time (we think the kitchen might slip a little bit on Sunday night and we were willing to give it another try.)

The rice noodle was the perfect thinness (sign of good quality), but TK used green onion (ugh!) instead of cilantro in the meat mix.", "author": "Eating Sleeping T."}

She wanted a dim sum fix and I just wanted food. We were seated upstairs in the back room, which sort of sucked because it felt like we were stow-aways at the back of some Chinese restaurant. The servers came swiftly and constantly almost to the point of being obnoxious because I could not eat since I was too busy saying 'no thank you'. The main hostess was very friendly though and was good about refilling our waters. I was surprised by how expensive the dim sum was. But to be fair, the food was quite good for dim sum and I grew up on the stuff. What will keep me from returning? The price. It was just way too over-priced for what we got. There are many other options in Chinatown or even nearby on Clement St.", "author": "Janelle C."}

In the ongoing war of whether or not white people can pick a good dim-sum restaurant, I'd like to throw in something a little different.

Now, sure, you may be reading this, and other reviews here, thinking \"hmmm, but the chronicle said...\" or maybe you always go to the same favourite dim-sum place? and you just want to try something different? Listen to me. I was thinking these same thoughts before I went last week-end. And I went ahead and tried it. And I was very, very disappointed. Do not go. It is not worth it.\n    Let me explain. If you read other reviews here (but don't. Just read this one, and decide to go somewhere else), some people may say \"for dim-sum virgins\". This is accurate - but just in case you are a dim-sum virgin? Still don't go here. Why would you want to spend that magical time with someone who didn't care whether you had a great time, or even if you ever came again? You shouldn't.\n    And for some thing concrete, about the food etc. The food is uninspired, small, lacking in taste or texture. Sometimes it was cold, because they don't use the heated carts, but rather the girls carry trays. The prawns they used were cheap and sad affairs. The dumpling skins were really thick and gungy.

It was like we had wronged one of the many forms of buddha and he had forgotten his own lessons on compassion.  I think the most shocking omission was the absence of chicken feet on a day when we were feeling adventurous (side note: we were hoping there would actually be a platter of feet - pigs feet, duck feet, etc.).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-15", "description": "Ton Kiang has been a fixture in my life since the very beginning, back when it was located in the location next door to its current building. As a child my sister and I would spend the first 10-15 minutes with our noses glued to the fish and shellfish tanks, watching the crabs clamber over each other and the fish swim in circles. Finally we'd be ushered back to the table to settle into our meals, which became quite routine, although we would mix it up from time to time as well.\n\nAlthough Ton Kiang is classified as a dim sum restaurant here, and it does have excellent dim sum, I mostly have visited it for dinners. The Hakka cuisine has a lot of yummy choices, and they also carry the more 'traditional' (air quotes!) Americanized Chinese dishes, too. Our regular menu includes the delicious Salt Baked Chicken, a nice portion of Won Ton soup with bbq pork (very tender and flavorful) and stuffed tofu. I'm not a fungal fan, but my mother and sister swear by their mushroom plate, and the various sauces (mustard, hot sauce, an amazing ginger dip) help you complement the flavors of the food.\n\nAlthough it can be a busy restaurant (especially for dim sum), I do find that the service is crisp and generous, but sometimes you feel a bit forgotten upstairs. I prefer to sit downstairs anyways, as that gives you a better opportunity to watch the scene and see people coming and going. Some of the wait staff have been around for 20+ years and still tease me about the glasses I used to wear as a child. Great and personable service, especially if you are a regular (or a lifer, in my case). \n\nThere are a few bumps, but frankly I am not going to let them affect my 5-stars. Nevertheless, do know that they do not take reservations for small groups (I think the cut off is 8+ or 10+), parking can be a real pain (my father once famously gave up trying to find a spot to park after dropping us off, and ended up driving home in a fury instead - he still asked for us to bring home some food for him though!) and there is only one bathroom each for men and women, so there can sometimes be a bit of a wait. Also Ton Kiang is not the cheapest Chinese restaurant in the area, but I have no qualms whatsoever about paying a bit more for this experience. Finally, in response to one of the reviews that remarked on how distant Ton Kiang is from Chinatown (and the presumed impact that this distance had on the food's quality), there is in fact a very large Chinese community based in the Richmond, and in fact it is larger in numbers, if not in national recognition, than Chinatown itself!", "author": "Richard N."}

We saw several people that 1) had called and made reservations and 2) came after us but got seated before us because they don't seat in order of when you get there, they seat by table size.  So, if a table that could seat 6 opens, they will seat a family of 6 even if they have waited 2 minutes and the party of 4 has waited an hour.. kind of odd.  Our friends had a plane to catch, we had to rush to eat so that added to the mediocre feeling.  After we had filled up on what had come around, better things came around maybe after 30 minutes so I was disappointed that we didn't have a wide variety at the beginning.

Maybe it's because this restaurant serves more unique dishes than I usually see, plus it's been favorably  reviewed in local newspapers and, as my mom says, is \"fancy\" because it has cloth tablecloths and cloth napkins. I liked it but my mom whose favorite hobby is comparison-price shopping, thought it was too expensive. 6 dishes and tea for $28.00. Dishes were $3 to $5, compared to $2 to $3 like my mom is used to seeing in Chinatown. I felt bad so I had to stop ordering since my mom was paying. (What was unusual was that next door was another dim sum place, with much lower prices - starting at $1.80). Half the clientele in Ton Kiang was non-Asian, which may have been another clue as to why it was more expensive. I've been to \"dive\" dim sum places where my friends are the only non-Asians there.

Have been here several times for dim sum for lunch/brunch, but not for dinner (that's just wrong!). For dinner, it's much, much better to have their Hakka cuisine, which is what Ton Kiang specializes in. Hakka (Chinese pinyin: ke4jia1, literal meaning \"guest families\") are a Han Chinese people whose ancestors are said to originate from around Henan and Shanxi in northern China over 2700 years ago. Their ancestors migrated southwards because of social unrest, upheaval, or by invasion of foreign conquerors since the Jin Dynasty. They speak their own dialect of Chinese, which is why Ton Kiang, which means \"East River\", is not written as Mandarin dong1jiang1, nor is it written in Cantonese as dung1gong1. The best dish to order, and my favorite, is the Ton Kiang Steamed Salt Baked Chicken. Order some dou miao as your veggies to go along with this dish; it's not on the menu, but any Chinese restaurant will have it. Or order kong1xin1cai3.

All of the dumplings and crepes are extraordinary. the service is wonderful and the food is sooo good i dont mind waiting in line  for a table (which is a common occurance). to agree with one yelper, it is a bit expensive as you have to get a number of little dishes to be  satiated, but i think it's worth it. i was soooo lucky to have born and raised 4 blocks from this Chinese treat!  :)", "author": "Hillary C."}

San Francisco is supposed to be where dim sum restaurants originated, so of course i had to try one. We went to Ton Kiang. I know everyone wants to eat this stuff in chinatown, but it's pretty touristy over there and besides all around me is like chinatown, so this seemed a better bet. and i was right! i actually went there twice. the first time we got there around 2 and it was very busy. we didn't have to wait long, only maybe 5 or 10 minutes, and got seated upstairs. the second time, we got there probably an hr later, and it wasnt busy. we were seated right away, downstairs. either way, the service was great, people carrying most of the food on trays instead of wheeling them around. there were tons of dishes, lots of variety, and the stuff came very frequently. I do think there was a little bit more variety the first time, probably because we were at rush hour. I've never seen so many dim sum dishes though! Everything was good! We went a second time only because we didn't have room in our stomachs to try everything the first day. Some of the dishes are a little expensive, the oysters drove our bill up the first time (i dont eat those they look scary). I know there are cheaper places here, like there were in boston. Still, $45 for three people isnt that bad. And mmm those potstickers and dumplings!!! Definitely go here. The dishes are not cooked in peanut oil like we've been warned some places might do (me and my roommate are allergic). i'm going to try another place for variety next time but you have to go here if you haven't.", "author": "Merredith L."}

We are locals and this is in no way an overrun tourist trap.  This is not a fancy, trendy restaurant but rather, a restaurant that focuses on the food and service.  My husband, sister and I went on a Friday night and were immediately sat. (This is after driving around the block, up & down Geary for about 45 minutes trying to snag a parking spot) And boy were we hungry when we sat down!  No wait.  We were immediately given the regular menu and Dim Sum Menu.  Husband & I did the dim sum for 2 plate- PLENTY of food.  You get 9 options on the dim sum menu and there are 3 of each item so this was 27 individual items which ended up being the perfect amount of food.  My sister ate the Mongolian Beef and it was tasty and tender meat.  We ordered Won Ton soup for a starter and it easily fed 3 and could have fed more.  Each dim sum item was great- all the different stuffed dumplings, pork buns, and of course the sesame balls as dessert.  We were very impressed with the food and the service was also great.  We asked our waiter to recommend some of the dim sum dishes since we had never had any before and he was helpful and attentive throughout the meal.  The prices were very reasonable as well.  The bonus of this place, on top of the awesome dim sum, is that it serves dim sum all day and night, until they close.  Most SF dim sum places only serve this for brunch/lunch.  The *one*  thing missing this night was the traditional dim sum cart they normally push around but who cares if the food is good!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-08-09", "description": "I used to often eat at Ton Kiang when they were still at the Geary and Spruce, pre-dim sum location. And I was happy with what I thought was the city's best dim sum when they opened the current space and for a long time after that. In other words, I've eaten well there for more times than I can count.\n\nA couple of days ago, we decided that we'd go there for dim sum today. It had been awhile since I'd been there, so I decided to check Yelp and a couple other places to get the current word on things. The word was unencouraging and we almost didn't go. But we decided to give it a shot since we'd eaten well there so many times in the past. It wouldn't have been fair to them to write them off based on other people's words.\n\nThe Yelpers were right, sadly. The meal was not just disappointing, it was awful. The chinese broccoli and pea tips were cooked fine, but coated with a thick and bad tasting oil. The XLB was OK, but not distinctive. Same goes for a couple of the shrimp dumplings and a few other things. Other items were just greasy and bad. At first, I wondered if it was just me, that maybe I'm just not as into dim sum as I once was, which happens to be the case. But then I compared it to things I've eaten at other dim sum places over the last months, places I wasn't even that crazy about, and they were way better. Even some take out that I had from Ton Kiang earlier this year was fine. This was the kind of meal that not only wasn't satisfying from a taste standpoint, it made me feel like I had grease dripping from my pores on top of it. I wanted to turn back the clock and go elsewhere. Not a good place to be.\n\nMy wife is convinced that there must be new ownership. The difference is too extreme for any other explanation to suffice.\n\nIt'll take some convincing to get me back there, again. What a disappointment. I can't think of many situations where the same place had such a sudden and dramatic fall off in quality. Yuk.", "author": "Jim S."}

The food was excellent. The pot stickers are crispy with a wonderful ground pork, onion (instead of cabbage,) and ginger filling. The egg rolls are crispy and greasless with fresh vegetables with a well balanced sweet and sour sauce. The beef with snow peas in house chili sauce is excellent with tender melt in your mouth beef with stewed snow peas as opposed to stir-fried in a tongue tingling but suttle chili sauce. The Ton Kiang crispy noodles are crispy with a plethora of beef, barbecued pork, squid, scallops, prawns, and bok choy in a light gravy. For dessert, the egg custard pancakes are soft and chewy at the same time with a light, sweet, but rich egg custard. The service is very friendly, the waiters explaining what you are getting aned not coming around to refill tea, water, clear dishes, and ask hiow everything is not too much or too little. I will definitely have to go back for dim sum and inner again. So, for excellent Hakka cuisine at reasonable prices with great service in a traditional atmosphere, Ton Kiang cannot be beat.

We've since moved from SF to the north bay and still return to Ton Kiang every so often for a special treat.  We were there on Tuesday Dec. 29 for lunch and sure enough, there was a line.  I guess everyone had out of town guests!  Surprisingly there were no folks of asian appearance in the line.  After waiting about 1/2 hr.  we were shown to a table on the 2nd floor right in front of the window.  Seeing that there were only non-asians in the restaurant I was apprehensive about what we would get.  Unfortunately my fears were confirmed.  The waitresses had changed to younger, english speaking young ladies who were bringing around trays of pedestrian dim sum that you could get anywhere for half the money.  My son wanted some roast duck and after waiting some time for it to come around we asked for it.  We kept getting promises that it was \"coming\" and 45 minutes later it finally appeared, when we'd already given up hope and had eaten our mango puddings.  Amazing since the duck is bought/prepared ahead of time and all that they have to do is cut it up.  They never brought around anything but the most common dim sum and we never did see the waiter for our table.  Ton Kiang has gone over to the \"Dark Side\", that is, they've sold out authenticity and freshness for the quick buck and catering to those who don't know quality dim sum.  They've lost this long time family for good because it's not worth the drive, the parking hassle and wait, and the cost for this mediocre experience.", "author": "Jenny F."}
