I placed a to go order (large mixed pizza, 1/2 quart spaghetti 1/2 quart spinach ravioli, tossed salad, and garlic bread) and instead of waiting the proposed 30 minutes it took an hour. \n\nYes, it was overpriced for the quality. The pizza looked good but tasted bland. The tossed salad was a handful of poorly cut lettuce, along with matching pieces of tomato, and a ton of olives. The garlic break was extremely burnt and hard/broke to eat. The spaghetti was soggy and tasted like aluminum. The ravioli was the best part and tasted better than it looked. Our total was $50. Way too much.\n\nThe lady working there was nice and appeared to be trying her best to rush the order. I don't understand how the place can handle a busy night when just one customer took an hour. \n\nOverall, I won't be back and I won't recommend trying this place out. I give this 2 stars instead of 1 because like I said, the lady was nice to me and the venue itself looked pretty decent. Place just has a long way to go to start satisfying customers.", "author": "Kristy F."}

I walk in this restaurant and it looks like it something that would appear on Gordon Ramsey's show Kitchen Nightmares. Where do I start??? HM! maybe when I asked for a water and she gave me a bottle of arrowhead water AND CHARGED ME $1.50 for it! Not only was I mad about the price, but ARROWHEAD. The nastiest bottled water ever. But after ordering THE STAR FLEET PIZZA, I realized I wasn't on a television show...I was in hell. Hell. This pile of greased was literally dripping and oozing from the za getting all over my new trousers. After eating a slice, I called it quits and pulled the trigger in the bathroom. And no, it was not time to rally after. So once I check out she swiped my card and there was only three options to tip: No tip, 18%, or 25%. And she was HOVERING over me while I decide pressuring me to just click 18% and gtfo of there. Taraval was cool in the 50s, but gawd damn it's over!

When you entered the place you'd be met by the loud hustle and bustle of happy families enjoying dinner! The kids would be watching pizza being made in the front and you could even get a handful of pizza dough to play with! That was THE BEST! The wait for a table would be long and there were times we even avoided the place because it was so crowded. I've had so many fond memories playing with my friends here after a game or for birthday parties! \n\nI came in today and was quickly heartbroken at how it looks now. The place is falling apart. It was completely empty. There were holes in the ceiling and junk in the back. The oven was off and it just looked so lonely in there, the magic of the 80s and 90s gone. Only a mere shell left. \n\nThe lady who ran the place was quite warm and friendly though! She treated us like we were guests at her house. She was the only one there.\n\nBut because she was the only one there (and another party had arrived) our food took forever. \n\nAnd when it came it was completely burnt underneath. This made me soooo disappointed. The nice lady offered to take 10% off our bill. But we were only able to eat half of the pizza. I literally SCRAPED the toppings off the crust. I normally wouldn't even eat it but I'm SUPER pregnant and I was sooo hungry! \n\nI just have to leave my beautiful memories of this place in the past.", "author": "RACHELLE T."}

When I made it, it was a true pie, it was hearty, it had weight and mass - I'd say now they are putting less than half of the amount of well-balanced ingredients we used to put on them.\n\nI think this place could change its image slowly for the better if it just paid attention to making a more generous pizza for starters.  \n\nOtherwise, this 40-year sunset institution is probably going bye-bye fairly soon if nothing changes - a business can't survive too long with this kind of online reputation i'd imagine.", "author": "John H."}

I was at Pirro's last night for a post baseball championship victory and the experience was damn near perfect for a party of 30.  I will start by saying that the 8 X- large pizza's we ordered were all delicious and there weren't any leftovers.  Now, acknowledging that not all pizza lovers enjoy the same kind of pizza, not all pizza restaurants will appeal to everyone right?  If you are a fan of thinner crust and don't like globs of tart pizza sauce, then you, like me will probably like Pirro's.  \n\nAs far as the overall atmosphere I agree that it can use a facelift.  But do I really care?  No.  If I wanted atomosphere, I sure as hell wouldn't drive out to the 7-11 on 32nd avenue to get it.  It was clean, nicely dim and felt kind of old school.  I can say with 100% certainty, having grown up 2 blocks away from Pirro's, it has not been updated at all since the 1980's.  But seriously, I'm not sure of all the criticism considering that it is in the middle of nowhere.  What are people expecting on 32nd and Taraval?  \n\nHistorically, the service at Pirro's has been hit or miss.  Last night it was pretty exceptional.  We did drop by before the game and talked to the owner.  So, she had warning that a team of fired up 6th grade boys were coming for a victory dinner.  She actually, started making all the pizza's in advance and began cooking them when we called from the field during the last inning.  When we arrived, she lined up all the tables in back for our party, repositioned the big screen TV and was friendly to everyone including a bunch of loud, rowdy tween boys.  Maybe she reads her reviews?  Not sure, but the service was great.  No complaints.\n\nLastly, for the reviewer who felt it necessary to point out the race or ethnicity of the ownership.....really?  It says a lot more about you than it does about this pizza place.  I'll put money down that you wouldn't do that if the racial background of the owners was one that you might feel intimidated by.

I got an expensive ($4.50) slice of sausage pizza here and my friend got a vegetarian slice ($4.50 also). I say expensive because aside from the awful taste (my tongue!!!), old dough (it was a dark grayish color) and skimpy toppings (about five little sausages), it was thin and pretty small in size. I don't even want to imagine how much whole pizzas are and how big (or in this case small) they are.

It was called the Pirro's Special. It was delicious. It had the best sourdough crust, lovely fennel spiced Italian sausage, and great sauce. I saw this place slipping away because the pizza started to only be good if a certain cook was there. NOW this place has gone to hell. I knew immediately it had gone there when I ordered my Pirros special and the crust was now no longer sourdough. Also the sauce had changed, yuk. \n\nBut check this out. It was the seventh game of the World Series so I know I'm not cooking. Game starts at 7:00pm so I call to get two large pies to be delivered. I called at about 5:00 or 5:15. The lady (Korine) takes my order, says it'll be a half hour/forty five minutes. I say perfect. So along comes 6:15,6:25, at 6:30 my boyfriend calls and asks what's up and offers to pick up the pies. She says,\"Oh no, your pies are in route.\" We say fine. Along comes 6:45, no pies, World Series about to start. At 7:00 we call her and say what's up. She says, \"you said you were picking them up blah blah blah\" My boyfriend and I hop in the car and fly down there. I am hot because now I'm missing the game and my pies are sitting around getting cold. I figure she'd throw in a couple of sodas for the trouble but no. I was too mad to go in so my bfriend goes in and Korine says, loud, \"what happened!?\" Now she's blaming us, we are missing the game, and the pizza's cold. No apology nothing. Asks us what happened. On top of that the pizza was garbage and not cheap. That was almost $60 worth of pizza.\n\nI tried going into the place once on a Friday night to eat in. What I saw was the final straw. Korine is the only employee there so she cooks and cashiers. She was taking money and then bare handedly making pizza. No she didn't wash her hands in between. The only people that ever go in there are a couple of old men. They always sit there at the same table and get drunk. Not very appetizing. Never again. I'm sad.", "author": "Hope C."}

Somewhere between my lusting for an Arby's Value Meal, I got a hankering for some pizza. I boarded the L Taraval and while traveling towards Thirty Sixth Avenue, I saw a sign that said pizza but, the exterior of the restaurant looked like a tavern. I allowed my curiosity to get the best of me so, I got off the LRV and decided to walk back and see what the 411 was about this place. As I approached the door, I noticed they had a menu posted with prices included, The prices seemed appealing and I saw that it was crowded so, I decided to go for it, \n\nAs soon as I walked in, I felt a sort of dinginess to the establishment but that was not what bothered me. It was so noisy as there was some sort of sports team having dinner. It was so noisy that even though I was underneath the television, I could hardly hear it nor could I hear myself talking to my other dinner guest. As soon as we came in the door, we noticed a couple empty tables by the flat screen television that was mounted above the last table. We were told to sit there and within two minutes, a menu was dropped at the table. A few minutes later, our order was taken and we were given our two sodas and this was at 6:45, After that interaction, we did not see our waitress until she literally \"dropped\" the pizza on the table and left which was 45 minutes later. \n\nFor forty five minutes we were not acknowledged or offered any water or a refill of any soda. Granted, she had a party of people but she was circulating the dining room and she took several minutes to relax so, this was no excuse. \n\nThe only time the waitress came by to ask if everything was alright was when she was picking up the bill from the table behind us. She saw our soda glasses were empty and she did not offer any more or even offer us water or more napkins which we could have used. I am a grown boy and I can ask for what I need but when I go out to a restaurant, I should not have to. \n\nThen after sitting there for a bit, she dropped the check off at the table without asking if we needed anything else. Of course, as we were getting ready to go, the theatrics came on and she was so friendly... I know this game... the insincere sincerity will not cloud the fact that you offered no service and are now expecting a gratuity. In all honesty, she provided some of the worst service I had in a long time and I eat out frequently. \n\nAs far as the food, the pizza was actually quite good. The toppings were plentiful and the cheese was just enough. As far as the crust, it was crispy yet chewy. So, I would give the pizza cook 3 stars for a well made pizza. However, the wait service was extremely poor and neglectful. \n\nWould I come back here again? In all honesty, if I saw this waitperson were not here, I may give it a try but would I go out of my way to go there just to go? I think not!", "author": "Tony M."}

They use tiny frozen raviolis. How do I know? The pasta was uncooked.. and the filling was dry. When we brought it to the server's attention, we got no apology, but just asked if we wanted anything else instead. I decided to just get some Spaghetti instead.\nSpaghetti: at least the noodles were cooked. Unmemorable. My mom makes better spaghetti sauce that doesn't taste like it came from a can.\nDessert and Coffee: Never got it. She did ask me, but she phrased it in such a way that I thought I had to pay extra. Since it was advertised to come with the meal, I figured she'd just serve me or asked me to choose from a selection. By this time I just wanted to cut my loses and get the hell out.\n\nService: Service was okay until a softball team of about 15 people came in half way through our meal. I tried to be understandable of the stress the only server would feel, if only she wasn't so rude and at least tried to be polite I would have given her a better tip. I swear she was answering phones, making pizzas, taking orders, and everything on her own. She ignored me and my bf as soon as the large party came in, surprising since our table was literally right next to them.\nWhen we asked for the bill, I was shocked to see that she had the ravioli dinner written down. I went up to tell her I didn't have the ravioli since we sent it back, and she briskly said she charged me for the spaghetti dinner but just didnt change it on the bill. At this point we just wanted to the the hell out, so we paid and left ASAP.\n\nBY THE WAY, PIZZA SAUCE OR SOUP COME'S FROM A CAMPBALL'S CAN. I SAW IT.\n\nOverall: Maybe pizza for pick-up ONLY.

It is family run and has the red-and-white checkered tableclothes that one can expect from the archetypical american pizza place.  The service is brusque but friendly; it is almost like you are old family friends where empty pleasantries are no longer necessary.\n\nAs for the pizza: it is very very good.  The ingredients are fresh and the meats are top notch.  In addition, they consistently bake the pizza to a perfect crust (deliveries don't count).  There is nothing extraordinary about the pizza, but it does the ordinary combination pizza (Pirro's Special) a service well worth talking about.", "author": "Mark K."}

We convinced her to let us sit at the two top near the door...obviously, no one ever sits there because there was a layer of dust on the seats and on the table. Mistake #1 was thinking that we could get good Italian food at a Chinese owned and operated establishment. Mistake #2 was NOT ordering pizza....I ordered a chicken parm sandwich and it was literally a perfectly round breaded frozen chicken patty on a hamburger bun. When I ordered, the server asked me what kind of cheese I wanted on my Chicken Parm sandwich! WHAT?! It's a Chicken Parm sandwich for crying out loud..how about mozzerella cheese?! When it was served, it had the chicken patty and red sauce on one half of the hamburger bun and shredded pizza cheese on the other half. My boyfriend ordered the ravioli with meatballs (which is a weird combo in itself if you ask me!)...He described it as being so chewy that it was like \"meat flavored gummy bears\"...it was gross!
