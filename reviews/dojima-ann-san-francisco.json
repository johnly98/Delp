Score! You order and usually less than 15 minutes later they come slam the food on the table and scurry back to the kitchen. \n\nY'all ready for this?!? \n\nBOMB! The food is great, you are enjoying every bite and they bring you more whatever/beverages but you don't push for anything else because you learned your lesson at the front door. You eat up, get the handwritten bill. You get up and pay thinking \"do they really deserve this tip?\" And still hit that 20% anyway because this is your investment in the next time you didn't mean to be there and also that chef is back there working magic with that spatula so you don't event feel bad about it.

We decided to go because we were hungry and wanted to eat a light tasting Japanese cuisine in the middle of the financial district (so we weren't feeling ramen). \n\nThe food is very delicious. I ordered the niku udon set, which came with the mini eel don. The beef slices were paper thin, so it was very easy to cut and chew. It was great to eat with the udon noodles. The noodles were cooked just right, so it was chewy but also tender. The broth was delicious too and I almost drank the whole thing. \n\nThe dinner experience would have ended with a good note, except for the service. \n\nThere was a young couple who sat next to us, who apparently have been there before us. One of them have ordered a nabeyaki udon, which was also what we have ordered. Less than ten minutes after ordering the older waitress came in with a nabeyaki udon and served at our table and left. We were surprised at the speed of arrival, but moments after taking two photos of the dish and taking a bite of a vegetable, the same waitress returned realizing she made a mistake. The order was for the neighboring couple.\n\nThis, of course, brought a strange little tension between ours and the other table. \n\nThe waitress then came by the couple's table three times, once to deliver a free potato salad (in which the awaiting and probably hangry customer didn't even touch), second to apologize and to let them know that the food was coming soon, and the third to apologize yet again because it ended up that all of our orders arrived before theirs.Each time, however, the waitress gave a head nod toward our table. \nFor our point of view, it gave us an impression that it was our fault that they didn't get their dish in time. Would we supposed to apologize to the couple and give the nabeyaki udon that we have eaten a bit of the Chinese cabbage over to them? Surely, they wouldn't have liked that either. Throughout the time, the older waitress gave us no attention. \n\nEither way, the service here gave an uncomfortable time. We felt a similar unfriendly experience on our first visit here too. \n\nThis will probably be a place I will return maybe five years or so, around the time when I have forgotten about this event.", "author": "Mito I."}

My friend and I arrived a little after 7 pm on a Tuesday evening and were able to get seated immediately, though I think we might have grabbed the last open table. It's not a big place so I can see there being a short wait during peak times on the weekend.\n\nI love oyakodon (chicken and eggs over rice) and hadn't had it in a while, so when I noticed it was on the menu here, I knew I had to get it. But first, I decided to give their cream croquette ($8.95) a try as I was familiar with potato croquettes but not cream ones. One serving came with three pieces and were perfectly crispy on the outside and deliciously creamy on the inside. I loved the cream filling and tried to figure out what it was made of but it didn't taste like anything I recognized. Definitely recommend this appetizer even though it's a bit pricy, as it's a very unique dish I haven't seen elsewhere.\n\nThe oyakodon ($11.50) was a huge bowl of chicken with sort of runny eggs, and while it was enjoyable, the flavor was on the blander side. The chicken and eggs were good to eat on their own but with the rice there just wasn't enough flavor to make the dish work. A little bit more salt would have gone a long way here. They give you a lot of rice, but I ended up eating only a little over half of it.\n\nService was a bit slow here as I didn't see too many servers. That was fine for us as we weren't in a rush and could use the time to catch up, but if you're in a hurry that's something to take into consideration.\n\nThe shape of the restaurant is long and narrow, so everything feels a little bit cramped together.

I am not very claustrophobic, but still felt a bit uncomfortable.\n\nThis is the most expensive bento pricing I have seen. For close to $20, you can order a 2-item bento box. You do get a hefty portion with your two items, plus it comes with salad and miso soup. The main item entrees tasted quite fresh as well. I also enjoyed that the tempura udon was not overly salty. Nonetheless, other places serve up better tasting food at a lower price point. This place does win with location, being only a short walk away from Union Square.\n\nWalk or take public transportation here.

The pork cutlet was moist and well fried, and I enjoyed the Worcestershire dipping sauce on the side. This dish also comes with a complimentary miso soup and green salad.\n\nI still feel the food is a good portion, you just pay a slightly higher premium due to its downtown location.\n\nJust a quick note on the SERVICE -- we walked in around 5PM on a Saturday night and looked like we beat the dinner rush. However, it still took the hostess a few minutes before greeting us and taking us to a table. Our food arrived ~25-30 mins after ordering, so they do take some time in preparation.", "author": "Bonnie Z."}

I can say that (i) their food is good and reasonably priced, but their service (or lack of it) deserves no more than 1 star. \n\nFirst visit:\nMy girlfriend and I stopped in here for a quick lunch (see http://places.singleplatform.com/dojima-ann/menu?ref=google for their menu on a third party website). I had the fried aji (horse mackerel) lunch special, and my girlfriend a bento with pork katsu and croquettes. All the food was fresh, authentic, and more than adequate in quality for the price. The breading of the fried aji was too thick to my liking, but it's a small issue. If anything, I had more issue with the service or lack of it. It's probably a cultural issue, but I found the staff to be all VERY unfriendly. So, no more than 3 stars even with the decent quality of food and the reasonable prices. \n\nSecond visit (December 2017):\nSame with the first visit: decent food but the service was terrible/unfriendly. This time, we had to wait for about 15 minuets before being seated (see my practical tips below). My son ordered the kakiage (\"stirred\" tempura) udon. I liked that they served the kakiage on the side, which is normal served on the udon.  \n\nPractical tip:\nIf there are more than 2 people in your party, be ready to wait to be seated. Most of their tables can seat only 2 people. Unless you're willing to sit at different tables, you would have to wait until two tables next to each other become available. Don't forget to put your name on the waitlist.\n\nNote: I found their food to be very authentic. However, this place is run by Chinese people in case you care about authenticity. I'm Japanese born and raised there, but I thought their food was very authentic.\n\n******************************\nIf you found something useful in my review, please hit \"useful.\" Your feedback helps me improve my future reviews.

It's a place that I've been always curious to try because every time I walked by it, there was always a long wait line.  I came in for lunch with fellow yelper Elena N. on a Monday and it wasn't too busy when we arrived so we got seated right away.  But as expected, the place got crowded just a few short moments afterwards.\n\nI came in pretty hungry so I started with their Sake Nigiri (http://bit.ly/2e9SYrP) and then since I've been on a mad hunt for awesome beef bowls lately, ordered their Gyu-Don (http://bit.ly/2e9PHIO).  The Sake Nigiri was fine I guess.  I don't really have much of a distinguished taste when it comes to sushi, but the pieces did look a little underwhelming to me.  They tasted fine in the end though.  The Gyu-Don though I really enjoyed.  It was a huge bowl of simmered beef and onions and it definitely filled me up to get me going for the rest of the day. \n\nBeing that Dojima-Ann is in Union Square, I guess you can call it somewhat of a tourist trap, but the food is pretty decent, moderately priced and it's probably one of the better Japanese food options in that area.  The proof is in the long lines.  I'm just glad to know that there's a decent spot in Union Square where I can enjoy a hearty beef bowl.", "author": "Rodney H."}

The soup and salad were standard. I find salad dressings at japanese restaurants a little sweet for my tastes, but this one wasn't too bad. The fish itself was good, but the size of the pieces were a little small. Since I don't like a lot of rice in my nigiri, I didn't mind the baby pieces of rice. The fish itself was cut a little thinner than I'm used to, but the price of the nigiri wasn't too bad for the items I ordered. I tried a bite of Rodney's bowl and it was pretty good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-10", "description": "I was on the 38L Muni returning from viewing The Madeleine Albright collection aka \"Read My Pins\" at the Legion of Honor when the hunger hit me real hard. I was in the mood for Japanese food and need to eat like ASAP--like NOW. When the 38L made one of its limited stops, there was Dojima-Ann right there and I was near the rear bus exit. I immediately hopped off of the bus and rushed inside. I was taken aback by the small size of the establishment when I briskly walked in. Even a bit more jarring, there was a sign-in sheet. Okay, the heck with claustrophobia and the sign-in sheet, I am hungry, dammit! Yup, definitely hangry. So I signed my name in on the sheet. \n\nFortunately, I did not have to wait long. I was escorted to a table for one and I caught sight of a corner table. I inquired if I could sit there instead. So I got my choice of the corner table. Not a good choice as the first seat against the wallI sat in, it was tres smelly. Must be a plumbing or ventilation situation between the building and the street. I chose to sit on the other side and all was all right. I was lucky to be situated near a pokestop to load up to catch them all. And I caught a few of the pokemon critters too that popped up on my screen.\n\nI looked at the menu of the various offerings ranging from bowls to bento box combinations to sushi and sashimi dishes. I decided to combine the litmus test with avocado sushi, pork tonkatsu and shrimp tempura bento box accompanied by a side of tamago sushi. My order came out in a reasonable amount of time as Dojima-Ann was getting less crowded. I was finishing up the miso soup when my order arrived. The tonkatsu and the tempura were virtually not greasy--crisp to the bite and to the teeth. The tamago was moist and juicy on a mound of perfectly cooked sushi rice.\n\nWhat bugged me a tad was waiting quite a bit in having to have my water glass refilled. Along with air, water is an essential for me--a definite le must while eating. Should have just left a water pitcher and carafe for me.\n\nI had to wait a bit at the till to pay the bill. I was feeling a tad bit claustrophobic along with my usual self being in a royal hurry to leave. The manager was a tad bit gruff with a server at the till yet when he rang my bill up, he was pleasant to me.\n\nDojima-Ann sure killed my hunger/hanger pangs and pains, I felt like I was restored and refreshed to my civilized self. The food was pretty good and the service was all right. Just did not quite like having to wait to have my water glass refilled, short four-ounce glasses. And while I was contemplating about Japanese food and restaurants, Dojima-Ann seems to resemble authentic Japanese restaurants I have read about and discussed with people who have travelled to Japan--something I still have yet to do. If there is another opportunity to come back to Dojima-Ann and if the hunger is really killing me on the way back from my museum trips, I definitely shall return.

The only good thing about it was the ginger and wasabi and soy sauce. I wish that I could give this place less than one star but Yelp won't let me.

At first I was really happy to be seated in 5 mins despite the line but weird things happened. First off, the restaurant is EXTREMELY tight and cramped. I wouldn't be surprised if we were over the maximum capacity because I see a huge fire hazard problem. The guy sitting with his friends behind me had to squeeze through the chairs to get all the way to the bathroom! Later on in the dinner, a waitress spilled hot soup on a child which was kinda sad but more an annoyance because of the kid's yelling. Plates were broken 5 minutes later in the kitchen. The waitress (I think she's the owner actually) yells at customers for not listening to her...omg\n\nI'm very tempted to just give 1 star but the food wasn't bad. I got the eel and rice donburi which tastes really yummy and my bf's beef rice was good too! We got the mini udon but it wasn't very flavorful. The fried chicken was really crispy but honestly we couldn't finish it because the rice and udon were very filling. \n\nBottom line, I wouldn't come back. I'll never forget the dinner though hahaha", "author": "Tiffany E."}

The una tama don was on the sweet side but was still tasty, it came with a side of miso soup.\n\nService was standard however I wished the waitress would have been more attentive to our drinks. I did have to repeatedly ask for water refills. The waitress also weirdly asked one of my friends to pay with cash but allowed the other to pay with card.

I happened to be at union square buy I've never quite found delicious food nearby except for elephant sushi which is very delicious but it's not exactly described to be something near Union square. I ordered a bento box with terriyaki chicken and California roll. I was disappointed by it. The total price is 13.95 not including tax and tip. The portion was severely small, chicken was pretty dry, terriyaki sauce was good but I mean.. It's like putting ranch in fries, there's nothing wrong with the ranch. There was quite an abundance of rice, two slices of orange, and some small California roll. The wasabi that came with it was definitely not enough.

I love the ease of just popping in for a quick meal when I'm running errands in town. The value for money is pretty good here. Although it's not exactly a mind-blowing culinary experience, there is a real value in having a quick and authentic Japanese food available right at the city centre. This place reminds me of cafeterias in Japan in many ways. I guess it's the casual vibe and the pretty generic and all-encompassing menu. You get noodles, sushi, tempura, rich dishes from the same place. It sounds like a good deal to me. They have sushi too but I usually go for rice dishes for the value of money. (Calorie intake per dollar, basically) \n\nIf you study the menu carefully, you will find that there are many ways to get some extra carbs for hungry bears; like extra mini udon noodle for $2.95, or go for a mega combo for $17.95. \nI ordered a tempura rice with mini udon noodle. Both tempura and udon were good! I would have liked just a little bit more sauce on the rice. But it's just my weird personal thing. I like my rice drenched in sauce :) Udon broth was warm and refreshing. \n\nOn a completely separate note, I've believed this establishment was called \"Osaka\" until very recently, because that's what it says outside the entrance in Japanese! I only know this now because I wrote this review. It was kind of a clue when a search for \"Osaka, San Francisco\" didn't get me any relevant result. I still think Osaka would have been a catchy name though.", "author": "Leo U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-06-09", "description": "The basis of my review is solely on customer service. I wish I would have gotten a chance to try the food but we had to walk out of this establishment due to the crass and rude nature of one of the female waitresses (black hair, ponytail, with glasses).\n\nAnd let the record show that if I could give this restaurant a rating of lower than one star, I would. Customer service is key anywhere and everywhere!\n\nWe walked in and the waitress seated us quickly. We got less than 2 minutes to look over our menus before the waitress rushed up to us asking if we were ready. My mom had a couple of questions about the portion size of the meals. The waitress let us know that the bento box was large, and pointed to another customer who was eating that very meal. The box was huge! So we decided to just order a soup and a bento box to start off our meals, and we asked to keep one menu to order more later into the dinner. For some reason this pissed off the uppity waitress and she let us know that we all had to order our own meals. My mom was confused and asked the waitress why, if she had just stated that the bento box was large. The waitress dismissed what she had just said a mere 5 seconds ago and began to belittle us claiming that they were \"running a business\" and that by ordering a bento box and another entree item for starters was apparently \"not acceptable\". My mom continued to try to reason with the waitress letting her know that we would order other items but wanted those for starters (hence why we wanted to keep one menu). The waitress clearly didn't like our dining plan and sauntered off before taking our drink orders. At this point we were all ticked off. The waitress was so hostile, rude and generally unpleasant overall (she radiated negative energy). I don't know why she was so upset with us. As the customer we have the right to order what it is that we want to eat. There were no signs in that particular establishment that claimed that we all needed to order four plates to start off our meals. Eventually we flagged her down for our drink orders (four teas) and she came back five minutes later with ice waters. We let her know that we ordered four cups of tea and this irked her even more as she rolled her eyes and walked away. After another five to eight minutes of waiting for our teas it became clear to us that our waitress had no intention of bringing them to our table. We hailed down another waitress for our teas and after a couple more minutes of waiting, we decided to cancel our order and leave the establishment. We understand that the waitress is \"running a business,\" but as a customer we have a right to take our business elsewhere. Although I don't know much about business, all logic points to not pissing your customers off. In the end, business is better than no business!\n\nTL;DR - I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone. Unless you don't care about how you're treated, then go ahead and dine here. I hope this waitress manages to turn her nasty aggressive attitude around. Just because you're having a bad day doesn't mean you have to take it out on other people. You also can't dictate what people can and can't order or how they want to order. Management should deal with this issue before this particular waitress drives customers away.", "author": "Nicole M."}

Lots of different tastes, smells, and textures. The portion size was great too! I had enough leftover donburi to take home a box and eat the rest cold for dinner, and it was just as delicious. \n\nService:\nThe service was pretty good! The waiters were accommodating and constantly available, and while it wasn't the level of service I saw at Lark Creek, it was definitely up there in terms of attentiveness, especially for such a cheap establishment. \n\nEnvironment: \nI'm not sure if some lights were off or something, but the restaurant felt unintentionally dark. It was a little below street level so the windows were smaller than normal, and there was very little additional lighting to contribute to a brighter environment. There was a TV mounted in the upper corner towards the kitchen side of the restaurant but it seemed to be more for staff entertainment than guest entertainment. It was also difficult to tell the intended ethnicity of the restaurant from the environment too! Most of the staff was Chinese even though it's a Japanese restaurant.\n\nRecommendation:\nRegardless, the environment was friendly and comfortable. Staff was nice, and food was great!

They also added some chicken breast chunks which were pretty well seasoned and juicy. A raw egg is also added to the bowl right after cooking stopped, so really soft even I waited till I fished most of the food.

Went for lunch ordered a 2 Bento boxes with chicken and tempura.   Waited about 10 minute to receive the soup.  After another 10 minutes one of the bento boxes arrived the other did not.  As we waited another 15 minutes the server not the one that took our order came over and presented a salmon bento box which was not ours. Apparently they gave that to another table who ended up eating it even though they ordered the salmon.   We waited another 30 minutes for the 2nd box to arrive.  Upon receiving the check we informed the server that took our order that we were not happy and felt that 1 order be complimentary.   She took the check back and then the server who made the mistake came over and started yelling at us that it was her error and we should have cancelled the order if we weren't going to pay.

I tried the chirashi (very pricey -- $18), which was not as good my local place, but was pretty close quality wise. I tried the tempura shrimp/veggie rice bowl. Not very good. I also tried an appetizer of shredded yam with raw tuna. They had the photo on the wall but it didn't arrive at my table looking like the photo. There was a raw quail egg on the tuna. I asked where the yam was and she said it was in there... looked like the white part of the egg. I tried it .... just slimy. Awful. I ended up just eating around the raw egg. \n\nIt's hard to get a table if you're a big party unless you go during non-peak hours. I went with my family of four early for dinner (5:30) and didn't have problems getting seated. I've gone several times by myself (seems like many do) and never had to wait.

I wouldn't say they serve the best japanese food I've ever had but everything is very comfortable. I love the gyudon(beef & onion over rice) and the udons. I thought the beef & onion don is far superior to the beef & onion noodle soup, but that might also be because i love gyudons. Their chicken kaarage is still a favorite if I don't mind eating deep fried foods =P \n\nThis restaurant is also fairly decently priced for having an awesome location.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-26", "description": "Common problem for vegans:\n\nWe can't have udon.\nUsually.\n\nThe reason is simple. Most of the time, the broth is meat-based, and unless we want to pay $8 for water broth (and subsequently it tasting bad and still risk it having fish sauce or meat seasoning/bouillon in it), we just avoid it and happily eat our avocado rolls.\n\nWell, I was on a quest to change that. Never have I eaten Udon in a restaurant before, but I was craving it. Dojima-Ann is near where I live so we went to check it out.\n\nHere, they actually offer their miso broth as a vegetarian-friendly option to all their soups. so throw your hands up and eat that udon and soba!\nYou can enjoy it with vegetable tempura or Sansai (which is what I went for), which is described as 'Japanese Mountain Vegetables.' It is a combination of several types of mushrooms, and green bean looking stuff. It was actually quite enjoyable! Loved the taste of the miso and the textures of the vegetables put together. I bought the lunch portion, which was enough to fill me up!\n\nOf course, they also have your standard basic veggie rolls and appetizers, if that interests you.\n\nHowever, why the 'meh' stars? Because we received some of the worst service here.\nWe walked in, and they pointed to a table at the far corner, the only one open. We got excited and sat down and started looking at the menus. And that's what we were left to do for 10 minutes. No one greeted us or anything. In fact, they literally forgot we were there as they tried to seat ANOTHER party at our table! After that mistake, we assumed they were going to come around and take our order, but NOPE! In fact, the table next to us got up and left, and they started cleaning THAT table, when we had to flag them down and take our order.\nWe asked for water and waited. During this time, the 2 tables next to us were now empty and clean, and got re-sat. What happened next? Those 2 tables got greeted right away and the best part? THEY WERE SERVED WATER AND TEA BEFORE WE GOT OURS!\nOnce again we had to FLAG someone down and ask for water. Finally they got us water (not until I saw them serve a newer table water first!).\nWe brushed it off to the fact that it was busy. But we couldn't comprehend how they could serve the 2 tables directly next to us beverages first and overlook us.\n\nAfter our [delicious] meal, our unhappy-looking server came around to clear our dishes. She never said a word, but we expected the check. We saw checks presented at every other table, but ours. Finally after waiting and basically being forgotten again, we came up to the register to pay.\n\nThey lost our ticket. In fact, it was as if we never dined there to begin with. we technically could've walked out, but instead they had to take out an order pad and ask us what we ate so they could charge us! Ridiculous.\nI have absolutely no idea what happen, but we literally were forgotten and I felt invisible.

But at least be happy Dojima Ann is offering this stuff in reasonable quality. It is actually way better than the counterparts offered by Chinese and Korean run Japanese restaurants that are prevalent around the city (or should I say, \"chitty\"). And definitely better looking than what \"Miyabi Tei\" would offer in the food court of Mitsuwa Supermarket in San Jose. \n\nI did look at what customers were eating that day. The look and feel, and presentation and execution, at least looked pretty legit.\n\nAnd the regular menu didn't seem terribly interesting to me.\n\nThough the white board wall specials did look very tempting, so I went with them.\n\nAnago tempura don - OK first of all we don't have a tempura donburi specialist place like Hannosuke in Los Angeles, but what I ended up with I would say is as close as we will ever get. Two humongous pieces of sea eel with several pieces of vegetable, all tempura battered to a very tasty consistency, and fried in sesame oil (yes you can smell it), along with a unique tempura don sauce that is very Japanese in look/feel/taste. Best of all, no vegetables that don't quite belong (e.g. broccoli....that does not exist in true Edo style tempura)\n\nIt doesn't look like much but once you take your chopsticks and dig in, then swipe some rice into your piehole, it hits da friggin spot. The problem is most of you have not been exposed to proper tempura, and got so used to eating crap being passed off as tempura, that this may taste weird to you (hopefully not). But rest assured that it is LEGIT, down to the smell and taste. Of course, don't compare it to high end Michelin star tempura restaurants in Tokyo that have lighter batters and super refined execution with high end seafood... \n\nAnd sharing is caring....so go check it out before they switch it up to something else!\n\nGrilled Bluefin tuna collar - Toro sashimi? YAWN. Bluefin sashimi? Please. BLUEFIN TUNA COLLAR (salt grilled). Now that's a rare part!Hamachi Kama? It has been overplayed. How often do you come across part of a Bluefin tuna that is not used for sashimi? Hardly ever? At around $12 to $14 this was a steal. Though I was not enamored with the way they did grated daikon....it was way too coarse. Other than that, a very decent job with the gas grill (it was not charcoal for sure), and ponzu + lemon helped take off some of the edge.\n\nDefinitely worth your while exploring the wall specials when you come in...expand your horizons (and without the use of recreational drugs)!", "author": "Ken K."}

I got a bento with two items and the Plus One got some kind of egg and chicken donburi and mini udon. Well, I tried the chicken and egg don, didn't tickle my fancy or trip the lights fantastic but it wasn't bad.  I did like the salmon and tempura though. Salad was great, there were two kinds included. Nice blend of flavors. Mini udon was sad, soggy noodles and weak broth.  But it was better when consumed with my tempura, so I dunno.

The typical tourist glitziness tends to repel me, but Dojima-Ann is a restaurant that stands out from all the ridiculous light-up signs and weird people standing outside with menus trying to lasso you into their establishment. It has legitimately good food, a great menu, and friendly service. \n\nGo for any of the specialty rolls, they do not disappoint. I'll recommend the Dragon roll -- indeed it's at every sushi restaurant in existence, but only certain places get the ratios right; a hefty slice of unagi, a good amount of avocado, significant crunch and all rolled up tight = success. \n\nBefore trying this place out I heard that their soup is where it's at, so recently I had some of their chicken & egg udon. The noodles were terrifically lovely, and the broth was savory, piping hot, and supremely satisfying, and the portion was just right. \n\nDojima can get crowded, but if there isn't a party of 10 ahead of you I'd say it's worth the wait -- there are few sushi joints in the downtown area that exist on the same level.

Don't really recommend when you have a time limited on breakfest, lunch or dinner.\n\nLike I say on top it's full of tourist and it's pretty busy, customer service is not that good.

It was okay and understanding if it was busy, out of control. I just wanted my money back so I called them. The first reaction from them I expected was \"We're sorry\" but the first reaction I got from them was \"You guys are friends, right? Just get back your money from your friends. And if you still want to talk about it, you should call us back during our break time which is after 3pm. We don't have time to talk to you right now.\" So, I called them back at 3 ish, but they never responded. I just stopped going there, but after few months, I went there again. And I went there Feb 21 around 7pm, it was not crowded, and not lots of people were there which means they were not that busy. We were 3 of people so we put our 3 cards, and each of us paid $18.41. Two of us paid 15% tips on card, and I paid $3 by cash, which was about 17-8% of tips. And after that, guess what? My account was charged 15% of tips as well.  THEY CHARGED ME 15% OF TIPS WITHOUT TELLING ME WITHOUT MY SIGNS. What is the problem with this restaurant? This is the worst experience ever ever never from all over the restaurants in San Francisco.

Japanese food is long known for having a deceptively complex flavor set masked by a startling simplicity. Dojima does not fail to recreate this ideal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-12-06", "description": "I first discovered Dojima-Ann in January of 2010, when I was preparing to take the MCAT. I was walking around Union Square, looking for a place to eat, when I noticed the unobtrusive sign for Japanese food on O'Farrell. I looked into the restaurant and it didn't seem too full, so I walked in.\n\nIt's never been the same since.\n\nI consider Dojima-Ann one of the most authentic Japanese teishoku-yas I've been to in the United States (especially comparing across Boston, SF, and NYC). In Japan, a teishoku is a set-meal served on a tray, generally comprising of a main dish, a bowl of rice, some pickled vegetables, and a bowl of miso soup. They were amazing when I studied abroad in Japan, and memories of consuming steaming rice and awesome tonkatsu or grilled unagi in the middle of January in Tokyo are among my fondest memories. In general, I like to compare teishoku-yas to the equivalent of American diners, since I think they're pretty comparable in terms of the service, occasion for dining, and price point.\n\n(incidentally, \"Ann\" means a shack, generally made of grass, or the residence of a Buddhist monk. it can also be used as a humble form to refer to one's own residence. this kind of suffix is seen in some teishoku-yas or smaller restaurants in Japanese that emphasize homey, unembellished cooking)\n\nI highly recommend Dojima-Ann's combo with mini-udon. You get a small bowl of their udon namesake (it's just noodles in a plain broth with some spring onions sprinkled on top, but the noodles are the right chewy texture and the broth is never too salty) along with a rice dish. It's a great deal for $2 extra, but warning: it is quite a lot of food so be prepared!\n\nI've been carving away at their combos, and these are the ones that are particularly noteworthy:\n\n-Kaki fry (fried oysters set) - HEAVENLY. You must try if you like fried oysters, and you get a very ample serving too.\n\n-Unagi-tamago don (eel with eggs) - the smoothness of the eggs really compliments the flavor of the grilled eel - this dish is full of the Japanese mirin-savory taste if you enjoy it (if you ever had an oyako-don, it's that taste)\n\n-Oyako-don (chicken with eggs) - same as above\n\n-Kitsune-udon (udon with a piece of fried sweet bean curd) - this is a very traditional Japanese noodle dish, and Dojima-Ann captures the flavor perfectly.\n\n-Nabeyaki (udon with an assorted mixture of meat, vegetables, topped with shrimp tempura and served in a steel bowl) - this is also extremely authentic\n\n-Sushi - they actually have very good sushi, but since it's much harder to get a good donburi (rice bowl) or teishoku (combo) IMO, I usually opt for a rice+noodle combo, but their sushi are pretty awesome as well.\n\nThat said, here are the things that I found were medicore:\n\n-Deep fried (tempura) dishes - their tempura has this really interesting greasy aftertaste in my opinion, which I was disappointed to find out, given how strong the rest of their dishes are.\n\n-Chicken karaage combo - don't get me wrong, the chicken karaage is fantastic, but the sheer amount they give you makes you kind of sick at the end because of the grease, unfortunately :(\n\n-Price point - I consider Dojima-Ann to be rather pricey, unfortunately. Luckily, the quality of the food more than makes up for the price.\n\nGoing here has always been a highlight of my day and I will continue to be a loyal customer! :)", "author": "Chris S."}

We came on Friday at lunch hour and we were seated within 5 minutes. It is pretty busy, but not ridiculously busy where you won't be seated for a long time.\n\nFor an appetizer we got the grilled whole squid - so good! It was probably my favorite thing. It was served with lemon and sriracha sauce - good addition. The appetizer was about $9.\n\nI got the shimp and vegetable tempura udon with extra noodles ($11). It's a lot more than the regular serving, which would have been $2 cheaper, and was very filling. The tempura was served on the side which was nice. The udon was tasty and so was the tempura. It was a nice fulfillment to my craving.\n\nI also got 2 orders (4 pieces) of the ika (squid) nigiri - $9. Not very cheap, and it was a really weird texture. This was the least favorite part of my meal. And I actually could have done without it because the udon was so filling!\n\nService was a-ok. We were seated pretty quickly and served in a timely manner as well.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back here for another udon serving since there aren't many other udon places I found in the area.

She suggested curry, and I wasn't in any mood to walk ALL the way to Japantown for some good ol' Japanese cooking.\n\nWe stopped by a Starbucks and decided to Yelp a place nearby. (Thank you Yelp application for saving our lives in finding a nearby Japanese restaurant!) Do note that a lot of places were closed on a Saturday at prime dinner time. My assumption was that we were in the Financial District, and since people who usually eat at these places work Monday-Friday, 9 to 5 job, these places wouldn't make any businesses opening on a weekend.\n\nAfter a phone call to make sure that this place was opened, we decided to walk the two blocks and eat here. We waited not too long, despite the fact that it was prime dinner time and the place only seats 40 people at a time. (I counted the seats as we were about to head out the door).\n\nI had a really hard time deciding what I want besides something warm. Finally, after we got seated I looked towards the restrooms and saw three pictures slapped on the wall with the words \"Today's Special\" plastered across the middle one, the tonkatsu donburii and tanaki udon (for the non-Japanese speakers: pork cutlet rice bowl and tempura droppings rice noodles).\n\nI was quite amazed by the presentation of the dish, for such a good deal, it seemed like they went all out on the cleanliness and simplicity. My friend ordered the curry croquette dish, and was surprised that the dish came with some side orders too.\n\n- Tonkatsu donburii: I had my share of this dish (from Daikokuya, from Mitsuwa Marketplace, and possibly a few more), but this place made the pork so moist and tenure that I was shocked that tonkatsu can taste something like this! I believe it had to do with the extra moisture in the rice, which kept the tonkatsu flavorful, rather than the usual dried out odd tasting that I'm used to getting.\n\n- Tanaki udon: I was hoping for something MORE meaty in the dish, but what could I expect from a combination dish? The broth was delish, and the tempura droppings were good too. Kind of wished it wasn't so simple, but again, it was in a combination and the soup was warm.\n\nWasn't too pricey, like I thought it would be. However, be careful about coming in too late. My friend and I somehow got into this place in the nick of time, before there was a line forming.\n\nAnd a funny side note, I think the couple sitting next to us, at least the girl, is a Yelper too.

Psychologically I have wanted to re-establish my connection to the the country where we lived for three years and whose culture I hold in unrivaled esteem.  Though it in no way benefits the people suffering in Japan, going out to eat foods familiar from those days is the surest way for me to reconnect.\n\nI was so psyched to discover this Japanese eatery down the street from my hotel here, as it is so typical of the many places we used to go out in Sendai when a meal was had on the run or at the end of a busy day.  Japanese restaurants in the U.S. and certainly Washington, DC are exponents of sushi and all power to them!  But the variety of food in Japan goes so far beyond raw fish and rice!  It's not surprising in the least that San Francisco has a place like Dojima-Ann right in the middle of a major shopping destination, as this city has decidedly strong Asia-Pacific cultural leanings.\n\nYelping \"Haven't had the 'mother and child donburi' (oyako-don, i.e. chicken and egg) in over a decade. High hopes here!\" as I checked in yesterday, I was not disappointed in the least. I also heard a lot of Japanese spoken, though mostly by the patrons and not the staff, who seemed to prefer speaking English even to Japanese customers.  The oyako-don tasted just as I remembered and brought back so many sense memories.  I get choked up just thinking about how devastated the region where we lived has become.  And yet I have nothing but mad respect for the strength of the Japanese character and the resilience of a people who have come back to prominence following so many other unspeakable tragedies.  I'm going back to Dojima tomorrow for the tonkatsu-don (fried pork cutlet over rice) and I can't wait!", "author": "Sean M."}

I like my food steaming hot, especially when it comes in a soup.  So that was a no no.  The donburi was...a typical donburi.  Nothing orgasmically good about it.

Their pork was a bit hard, possibly over cooked.  While I like to have green onion cooked with onions and eggs, they just sprinkled raw green onions on top.  Everyone has their favorite type of katsudon, so some people might like Dojima Ann.  As for myself, I thought that katsudon at Maki's in Japantown was much better.\n\nPROS:  Dojima Ann is a handy place to know if you want an inexpensive Japanese lunch when shopping in Union Square.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

You have so much to do around here from Fisherman's Wharf, Downtown, and Golden Gate Bridge... what the hell am I talking about. Don't you hate people giving their life story??? Just kidding. This is suppose to be a review right? Anyways...\n\nSo me and Mona checked this place out since I transferred back to the city and I work downtown now. I only had an hour for lunch so this was the spot we chose. Dojima-Ann is only of the few Japanese Restaurants that is located in the Downtown area. It's pretty hectic down here everyday so it's hard to find parking unless you go to the parking garages which aren't cheap anymore. This restaurant can also get busy at times as well but I don't know what's the hype since IT DOESN'T EVEN TASTE THAT GOOD!\n\n[M] Wayne ordered the Beef and Salmon Teriyaki Combination Bento Box [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cseyjQ0XIp6dwC0_TcaMOg?select=IV_moeIwmpx1XdWq-ibxFg] and I had their daily special. [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cseyjQ0XIp6dwC0_TcaMOg?select=EoOpLJtNUE6dgCalyHomnw] We also ordered a California Hand Roll and the Philidelphia Roll. \n\n[W] Ok, let's start off with the bento box. My beef teriyaki was over cooked so the meat was all dry. Normally, the beef should be a little moist but even all that teriyaki sauce did it no justice. The salmon teriyaki was ok as well. I guess I just had to keep dipping the meats back into the teriyaki sauce to add more flavor and let it be a little more juicy. It also had a side cantelope and some salad. \n\nThe Miso Soup [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cseyjQ0XIp6dwC0_TcaMOg?select=DFGtF0AzMxtGi9cyOtPf1A] that came with the meal was overly salty. It kind of tasted like it was some packaged Miso Soup that I can just buy at Ranch 99. \n\n[M] Their daily special was Tonkatsu Donburi and Tsukimi Udon. [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cseyjQ0XIp6dwC0_TcaMOg?select=EoOpLJtNUE6dgCalyHomnw]\nThe Tonkatsu Donburi was hands down the best I've had. The rice was steamy hot and flavorful and the cutlet was crispy good. It was extra saucy too so that is an extra plus for me. Can't say the same for the udon. The broth was a too bitter and salty for me to enjoy.\n\nOne thing that I couldn't overlook was how bitter their tea was. Wayne said it tasted as if they served us the bottom of the pot and just kept refilling hot water to dilute the tea. Tasted more like \"Fu Cha\" to me. This definitely goes on my list of one of the worst teas that I've ever had.\n\n[W] Moving on to the California Hand Roll, [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cseyjQ0XIp6dwC0_TcaMOg?select=OWab8EzMavz3fACgw3kOYQ] they might as well call it, \"We Didn't Even Bother To Try\" Hand Roll. Normally it should be some sort of effort in making it, such as having the crab meat peeled and rolled nicely. But it basically was some seaweed wrap, a imitation crab stick that was literally right out of the box and rice. I'm like, seriously??? I can just buy my own ingredients and make it myself with plenty left over! Not worth paying $4-5 dollars for. But then again it IS downtown so they have to milk their tourists somehow right? And if you're a tourist, DO NOT EVEN THINK this is good Japanese food. You don't even know haha.\n\nService overall was fairly slow as well. Their dining room isn't that big either and they usually have about 2-3 servers. That's a pretty crappy job in my book if 2-3 girls can't even handle 20 people. We were waiting for our check while the girl at the counter was just counting up her tips. I think their little register should be facing the dining room floor instead of the entrance so they can actually see if customers who need to be serviced. \n\nThis is one of those restaurants that doesn't get anything done unless you flag them down. They're very good at taking your order and disappearing for the rest of your meal until they're ready to collect your money. I think I get better service at Burger King. Lines are quick, and I can have everything my way.", "author": "Mona C."}

And sure, Dojima-Ann is like a 10 minute drive from work and I have to call on my famous parking karma to score a spot at a meter and not have to lot it.  But it's worth it!  Seriously, I've been here a few times and not once have I been disappointed with the food here.\n\nFirst things first.  It's small and can get crowded, so walk in and put your name on the list at the cash register.  Some people do not know this and the staff are too busy to monitor who's standing at the door.  (Yes, I learned this the hard way.)  This is one of those places that can only seat about 30 people so I'd suggest going a little early to beat the rush.  My regular is either the Oyako Don or the Katsu Don.  Both HELLA good.  I love the flavor of their sauce and LOVE how the egg is nice and gooey.

I'd say if you're at Macy's or H&M shopping and hankering for some Japanese food, make your way to Dojima-Ann.  I'll admit, I was pretty surprised how good the food was here.  I'm not sure if the staff or even the cooks here are Japanese, and I know some of you have biases about that.  But I've been back a few times (peep the check-ins) and have never been disappointed.

Flavor was perfect, nice and sweet.  The mini udon accompanying the donburi is average, and the broth is a bit too salty.

It also comes with salad, miso soup and rice which is a bargain for the price especially in downtown SF. \n\nHowever, what Japanese visitors and locals alike flock here for is their noodle soup. I will have either the chicken & onion or beef & onion soup (you get a choice of udon or soba noodles) when I get this dish on occasion and it is absolutely delicious. I like the soba or buckwheat noodles as I don't usually like udon or thick rice noodles for some reason. \n\nIn the rare times that I have ordered the sushi, it has always been fresh and tasty. The service can be a bit hasty at time especially when they are busy, but don't come here for the service, come here for the food.", "author": "Jared C."}

We arrived 9:30PM when they close at 10PM, and the place was still packed with a line outside the place. The food was really good. Had the rainbow roll and nabeyaki bowl, both recommended. My wife had the  special katsu don, and that was great as well. Three of the people that helped us were helpful and friendly. The only room for improvement was that our gyoza appetizer came at the end of the meal (they forgot), and I never received my hot tea. This happened with the first lady that helped us once we were seated. She was the least friendly, did not apologize when she came with our gyoza. The rest of the staff was so good, that they came by several times to make sure we are okay, and they even came around to all patrons one by one to let us know it was last call, and imagine this the man packed our food to go (no one does that anymore! i sure miss full service. hate places that hand you boxes and expect you to do it yourself then get upset their tip is not as much). As for the lady that was not as friendly as the rest of the staff, With that said, she provided okay service, everyone else was fine and the food was great. So overall good experience and we would go there again...maybe the one lady will be more friendly as she gets to know my family :-D", "author": "Manny P."}

This time around, we also wanted to stop by the Macy's Christmas Tree. Anyways, as we started getting hungry, I said I wanted something light since Thanksgiving (and the days after) pretty much made my tummy in a very anti-heavy foods mood. I wanted a sandwich or salad, but since it was pretty cold, we decided to get Japanese - something light yet more comforting.\n\nWe decided on Dojima-Ann since the bf had been here before and we were nearby. When I saw the menu, I knew it was a good choice since they offer your usual simple Japanese dishes - sushi, rice bowls, noodles/noodle soups, combination entrees, etc.\n\nOn a Sunday night around 7PM, the small restaurant was packed. I liked the feel of the restaurant - semi crowded, vibrant, small shop. Service is good here - attentive, quick, and food comes out fast. The food is also decent here - exactly what you would expect from a casual Japanese dining spot. We ordered the Nabeyaki Soba, Combination (with sushi and Saba Shioyaki), and also an order of Tuna and Hamachi Nigiri. All of our dishes were good - standard tasting Japanese food. I especially enjoyed their Saba Shioyaki.\n\nPrices are good here, however my only gripe is the pricing on their combination orders - the rice and noodle bowls are around $8-$10, which is a great price, but my combination box was $17.50 - a little too high I think.\n\nOverall, good spot if you're looking for a casual Japanese meal.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

A quick disclaimer: even though we were on vacation, my family was trying to save money wherever possible and we weren't willing to splurge on meals.  Luckily for us, we found this restaurant by chance while walking around Union Square. \n\nWe grabbed an early dinner around 4pm and it was packed!  Because the restaurant is pretty small, I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups (our party had five people and the restaurant staff had to move two tables together to accommodate us). \n\nAs for the food, it was not only delicious but very affordable (especially for the location)!!!!  I ordered a combination meal with teriyaki salmon and tempura.  It came in a cute bento-style box and included several other small sides and a bowl of miso soup.  For under $12, it was definitely a good deal!!  My brother and dad added on a bowl of udon to their meals and both enjoyed it.  I'd say that most dishes were in the $8-12 range.  \n\nThe staff was very nice and provided excellent service.

Dojima-Ann was a block from my Parc 55 Hotel and had pretty good reviews so I strolled over.  The place is small, about 40 seats, but clean and comfortable.  The service was perfect.  There when you need them;  gone when you don't.  \n\nI started out with a sashimi (Maguro) appetizer and was very pleased to be served five quite large (and thick) planks of maguro.  After the appetizer I wondered how much room I'd have for a meal and decided to go ala carte with a bowl of soup.  I'd read the raves about their Udon noodle soup and chose the curry beef.   Outstanding!  And a HUGE portion chock full of noodles, beef and some veggies.  The bowl was seriously the size of Bruce Bochy's baseball cap.  \n\nNeedless to say there was no third course.  The appetizer and the soup had me stuffed and satisfied.

They were really good, and the best part was that dinner for 2 came out to about $25! Crazy deal, especially in the city.", "author": "Stephen L."}

Really, that many people want udon and curry tonight? We decided to be patient and wait because there really wasn't anything else around. \n\nThe space is tiny and you won't have too much elbow room but we were lucky and were seated at a booth near the back.  We had the standard fare, udon and curry. The curry croquette was o.k. it just needed some flavor so I ate it with a lot of the ginger to give it extra flavor. It actually tasted better the next day. The udon was good but wasn't anything to write home about. \n\nWe tried to chat but our waitress polited told us we had to scoot as there was still a line outside at 9:45pm when we left and she needed to seat those hungry folks.

My boss has eaten here several times and introduced me to Dojima-Ann when we dined there together.  He even had a plan for what we should order, so I graciously  let him take the lead.  I played my part by selecting the sake. \n\nWe started off with the shrimp and vegetable tempura and a plate of cold soba noodles.  I loved how the noodles came with a small speckled quail's egg to crack over the noodles!  The tempura was light and crispy, and the shrimp were massive.  The noodles were simple and nicely cooked.  Everything worked really well with the dipping sauce.\n\nFollowing these as an appetizer, we ordered one of the specials - grilled tuna collar, or hamachi kama. Essentially, this is the part of the fish that is harvested after the head is chopped off.  It's the region right behind the gills.  My boss referred to it as \"seagull's food\" because you have to pick at it with your chopsticks to get all the tasty bits out  And, BOY was it tasty!  To me, some of the meat tasted sweeter in some areas of the collar than others.\n\nBe forewarned, this place is not very big but is very busy (and with good reason).  Venture a bit off the beaten path (i.e. eat stuff besides sushi and udon), and you'll be pleasantly surprised!", "author": "Christine G."}

I'm glad we stumbled across is in our touristy wandering around SF.\n\nI decided what I wanted to eat when walking past all the rest of the patrons and spying on their food. So many people had the large, steaming cauldron of Nabe Yaki Udon that I knew it's what I had to have. The table next to us also had the tempura appetizer and it's been so long since I had tempura that I was lured in. The boyfriend ordered the special, which was a bowl of tanuki udon (crispy tempura bits), and a bowl of pork katsu over rice.\n\nThe nabe yaki literally arrives in a cast iron cauldron which you're cautioned not to touch. There is a raw egg dropped in the top which is perfectly cooked by the time it arrives at your table. I popped the yolky goodness and stirred it into the udon. The broth is not as rich as other places I've been, but what it lacked in bone-broth flavor, it made up in accompaniments: tempura shrimp, tempura crispies, sliced fish cake, shredded seaweed, and slices of chicken.\n\nThe tempura appetizer was excellently crispy and satisfied my need for deep fried happiness. It came with two shrimp, a couple of green beans, a slice of eggplant, mountain potato or boniato, yam and broccoli. The dipping sauce had freshly grated ginger in it.\n\nThe tables around us also had sushi, which looked pretty, but it was chilly enough outside for us to stick to the boiling liquids. The flavors were not complexly layered in any of the dishes, but it was solid and well-portioned for the price.", "author": "Julie C."}

The chicken and egg donburi is only $8 something. The 6 piece classic sushi rolls are around $6 and up. \n\nHowever, it only gets 3 stars from me because the two times I had their rice bowls (first time the unagi don and beef udon set, second time the chicken and egg donburi) they left a weird taste in my mouth, I believe it's the taste of MSG? They tasted great but that weird aftertaste made me feel like I ate something bad.  The third time I had their sushi roll (rock and roll and hamachi roll). The size of the rolls were ok, but the rice was very mushy, and a bit on the sour side. Not sure if it's just a mistake on that day or what.\n\nHaving been here for 3 times I feel that I can give it a fair assessment, which is you don't need to go all the way out here to try this place. Not worth your time. But if you happen to be around the area for lunch, you can give it a try if the line isn't long.", "author": "Peggy M."}

In such a ramen-focused era, it was nice to see a large Udon and Soba menu.  I wasn't overly impressed with any one dish, but the soups were good and worth exploring more of the menu for a winner later on.\n\nGyoza: Typical.  Mild minced meat inside.  Steamed on one side, pan fried on the other.  The dipping sauce was colder than room temperature which put a damper on the normally steamy experience.\n\nTori Karaage: It feels like they're cheating!  They took larger pieces of chicken, deep fried them and then sliced them.  I was definitely missing out on some the normal crispy surface area.  Also, their mayo was so miserly dabbed on that it was gone after the first piece.\n\nNiku Udon: Low on ingredients (beef & onion), but high on taste.  Maybe its the pho lover in me, but beef makes such a savory soup base.\n\nNabe Yaki Udon: Bland soup base, but almost everything in the house thrown in.  Very thinly sliced fish cake yielded subtle bites that weren't too fishy.  The raw egg was a nice touch, but I felt rushed to eat it before it solidified.  Way too much cabbage, I know it is cheap and all, but not the best thing en masse in a soup.  The chicken bits were hard and dense, probably boiled too long.  The one shrimp tempura dropped tasty fried batter bits into the soup as I let it seep which helped evolve the soup over time.", "author": "Adam B."}

Since I didn't have a preference, my friends chose this place for dinner in Union Square based on the positive Yelp reviews. I took the Caltrain and walked the ~15 minute trek to Union Square. Note to self: always bring a warm jacket. It unexpectedly started to drizzle and my track jacket wasn't quite enough.\n\nI arrived at Dojima around 7:10 p.m. and the place was full. It's not a huge place to begin with so it can fill up pretty quickly. Since some patrons come in to grab a quick meal and head out, we were able to get seats within 5 minutes. Given that it was chilly outside, I opted for the Udon (with Beef and Onion). The hot soup broth really hit the spot and I was pleasantly surprised to find the generous portions of beef in my dish. I also ordered the hamachi roll, which was only around  $5 for 6 pieces.\n\nOverall, the value was good as I was expecting to spend more $ for dinner. Most udons are only $8 to $10. So for less than $15, I admit I was pretty full. The service was quick and attentive and while some hungry guests were waiting for a table, the wait staff did not rush us in any way. \n  \nThe restaurant is one block away from the O'Farrell/Ellis Parking Garage in the heart of Union Square, which makes it a convenient and easy place to find.", "author": "Chris L."}

When the food finally came I forgot all about the service and paid the bill.\n\nI am going to admit, I did not tip the 10% because I did not think they deserved it.  I tip based on service and not because the food is good.  Here is the good part...the waitress came back to me with the bill and TOLD me you have to give $2 more tip.  I looked at her and said \"oh so you tell your customers what they should tip you\".  She said no but you have to pay 10%.

Thanks Yelp for recommending this tiny-small space without the heads up! \n\nSo we were in the Westfield Shopping Center, when we were craving for Sushi for dinner. We've never really had any in the area other than the one in the food court. So I decided to look one up walking distance in the area on Yelp. Dojima-Ann came up with good reviews, and for pricing. My boyfriend is a SF local, but I'm from the East-bay, and we met up with his brothers who are from SF, and our kids. So we did need to accommodate for a larger group....When we arrived to Dojima-Ann we were a little disappointed to find it quite small. \n\nA lady welcomed us, but tried to split our group in 1/2, which we did have 4 little kids with us, and 4 adults. My boyfriend is stationed in Hawaii, so he hasn't seen his family in over a year...So breaking our group into 2 tables across the room from each other wasn't going to workout for us. We asked the male hostess, who seems like he would've been the owner if he can maybe try to accommodate us somehow, and even if we came back in 15 mins. He said NO we don't hold tables, and wasn't really trying to work with our situation, came across somewhat rude. So we decided to leave, and instead we went around the corner to Hana Zen...Yes, it was a little more pricier, but we got what we paid for. They had no problem accommodating our group, and Sushi was fresh. A great experience! \n\nWill we ever try to dine at Dojima-Ann again...I think not!", "author": "Leah B."}

I do think they are Kansai (western Japan where Osaka is) style though...  Kansai style has less soy sauce flavor and more Dashi (fish broth) flavor than Kanto (east Japan where Tokyo is).  I can make better Udon at home with my own broth, but Dojima-Ann is handy when I'm near Union Square.  Also I am very happy that they have extended lunch hour which ends at 5pm (I usually eat lunch after 2pm...) . \n\nFor Katsudon, they are too sweet for me.  Kansai/Osaka style usually uses more sugar and/or Mirin (sweet cooking rice wine) in their cooking.  I like Edomae (Tokyo downtown style) better for Katsudon.\n\nFor me, good Katsudon have to have \n1. Rice have be on the hard side.  Not too wet to accommodate the moisture from the broth.\n2. Katsu have to be freshly fried.\n3. Pork have to be thick enough but not hard nor dry.\n4. Sliced onions have to be cooked just enough in the broth before adding Katsu.\n5. Eggs have to be still soft and not cooked all the way through.\n6. Mistuba or Negi (Japanese green onions) on top\n7. Have to be served with Misoshiru (miso soup) or Suimono (simple fish broth soup) and Tsukemono (Japanese pickles) .  PLEASE do not call Misoshiru (Miso soup)- Miso.  Miso is soy bean past used to make Miso soup.  It's like calling clam chowder -clam or calling tomato soup -tomato.  Miso is a name of paste not a soup!\n\nDojima-Ann's Katsudon is not bad and they do come with Misoshiru and Tsukemono but I like Katsudon at Sakana (lunch menu) and Katanaya better.

I asked Waitress B if they could just add an egg to my dish and she said no but I could just order the unagi tororo don. Really?! Order another rice bowl for 2 people? Waitress B leaves and a few minutes later Waitress C comes over and asked me if there were any problems. I explained to her what happened and she had to go to Waitress A to talk to her about it. She returned with the same answer: you can order the unagi tororo don or just eat the unagi donburi. \n\nWaitress A never came to talk to me when it was her who took my order. WTH?! Why didn't she just come over instead of playing telephone with the other waitresses?? I was so mad and my mom was going crazy. (You know Chinese people resort to yelling in these situations). I did order the wrong dish but the waitress told me it came with an egg. So I was under the impression that my dish came with an egg. I didn't want to be \"one of those customers\" so I just gave up after trying to explain to two different waitresses that my waitress misinformed me about the dish I was ordering. \n\nThey didn't even try to make the situation better or alleviate my frustration. Our tea was never refilled and they never checked up on us. If you don't care about your customers, that's fine. We won't care to return.", "author": "Judy H."}

It's just that when almost half of the sushi joints in the downtown area are all shi-shi and far from where I work, I make myself walk over here because the rolls are affordable, food is decent, and it's just a nice place to be in. \n\nIt's pretty much a tourist magnet since it's on the outskirts of Union Square and H&M (ha!), but I really just like coming here when I eat lunch alone because most of the people who go there eat lunch by themselves, too. It's like our own personal hang out.\n\nBut as for the food, I really do enjoy their version of the 49er roll, which has shrimp tempura in it. Love it! Also if and when I do order entrees from the lunch or dinner menu, I love that there's always some great bento deal or whatnot served with miso. Almost everything comes with miso. The one thing I would most definitely stay away from: the Rainbow Roll. Not. Good. Their tempura is always delish, and I always found it interesting that they served their tempura over rice with the sauce on it already. Saves dipping time, I suppose. \n\nThe staff is always nice and friendly, which is also something noticeable. I actually sat at the bar one time (Which I have to say, was not pleasant because I was right near the drink case and radio nudged in a corner. Suuuucked.), and they were pretty slammed with customers, and the waitresses were working their butts off and still managed to provide me some excellent service. \n\nAll in all: good place to go for lunch, and also if you usually dine by yourself.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-05-15", "description": "Seriously, this place is a major no no. I like to read reviews on yelp, but never did I write one.. What brought me here?\nHere's what happened.\nMy sister and I were craving Japanese food after going shopping in the city, we randomly stopped by this restaurant. \nHowever, as soon as the waitress came to us, there was an inevitable feeling of uncomfortableness due to lack of a positive attitude.The Korean waitress was neither friendly, nor helpful even for a slight second. She couldn't even get the basics of being a waitress: not explaining the meal options properly, or doing a simple task of tilting a jar to fill our empty glasses. Although it wasn't great, I didn't give a shit because I had a great shopping spree the whole day. After finishing  our meal, which seemed overprice compared to the lack in quality, I asked for the check. \nWhen it came to the table, I simply placed my credit card and the waitress took it back to the register. While I was waiting for the return of my card, I wondered how much tip I should leave regardless of the rude behavior of the waitress. When I thought the night was all over and we could go home, the best part approached me along with my credit card: the receipt. The line where I was to write the tip, was already filled in with dark, finely pressed, black ink.\nThey decided to tip themselves! ...like WTF? \nWhen I called the same waitress and questioned her about the written in tips, rather than apologizing she said if the other server did not say that the tip could be included, that would be her fault. Unless I have some mental memory problems, I absolutely doubt that I said anything even close to that. Actually, neither did I say anything nor did the other waitress tell me when she took my check, she surely wasn't the \"talk to your customer type\". Claiming that I said that, she kept defending herself that it would be her fault not herself only if she didn't.\nThis is when my temper started to rise. Is writing tips in for your customer some kind of new thing that I've missed? Let me just make a point: I am not a stingy tipper, but a waitress that tips herself... Are they evaluating their service quality? Like, \"Oh~ I worked hard today, I should get this much tip from her, and this much tip from him and blah blah blah.\"  \nIf you neglected to read any of the things I've written above, just read these two sentences.\nFor your own healthy mind set, don't go to this restaurant. The waitresses are a two second meal ruiner. \n\nAnd just in case that girl that calls her waitress reads this, this is my message to you:\nCustomers evaluate your service, not you. I honestly would have given you much more tip than what you've put down yourself. But doing what you do, and being what you are, you don't deserve a single penny from ME or from anyone else. I guess that you thought of us as tourists because I spoke Korean to you. And you assumed that your services won't matter since I'm only traveling. Well, I'm not a tourist. Here's just a Korean to Korean advice: If customers don't give you tips, you don't write it for them, but fix your fucked up attitude:)   \n\nDefinitely be cautious of where you go, and who you are served by.", "author": "Narae Y."}

After a several decade run of good food, d\u00e9cor and energy - maybe this was it for Dojima Ann.  But yesterday we stopped in after a day at SFMOMA and Macys and Dojima Ann had the magic back.\n\nThe crowd is usually good - the place was packed on Friday after work with the usual mix of European and Asian tourists from all the nearby hotels, especially Japanese tourists from the Nikko practically next door - interspersed with shoppers like us, nice.  The place looks spiffed up, new floors, all the nicks and scratches buffed or painted out, and the kitchen was rocking.  The wait staff was good, attentive; include new lighting and it looks like the improvements all really paid off.\n\nThe layout has always been cool, very narrow and unusual in that it has 2 levels about a foot or two in height, apart - this gives a neat perspective to the place which is sort of cosmopolitan Tokyo hip in design - modern, not traditional, no shoji screens, etc.  \n\nThe menu is big; I think it's been expanded to include the whole spectrum of Japanese cuisine from sushi to teriyaki.  We had the tsunomono which is unusual for Japanese restaurants here - a sweet vinegary sauce over cucumbers and raw octopus and cooked shrimp with wakame (seaweed), pretty good.  \n\nMy wife's curry udon - she loved as did I my curry rice which comes with a salad and small bowl of udon - it was scrumptious.  The curry rice was loaded with thin cut beef, onions and the usual mystery chopped sweet pickle of neon red takuan - it reminded me of dishes I had in Japanese train stations and airports - you can get it most anywhere in Japan.\n\nI hope Dojima Ann can keep it together like this.  The location is unparalleled and the fast urban crowd/environment is paced by the quick city food Dojima Ann makes.  One of our old favorites has been successfully resurrected!\n\n(Groups:  As a review mentioned Dojima Ann is not large group friendly - because of the dividing wall the ability to seat a large group is diminished)", "author": "Alan O."}

In my estimation, there is a shortage of karaage in the world, but that is still no reason to settle for less than perfect karaage.  This is traditional karaage exactly the way you remembered it in your fondest memories of childhood.  It looks as good as it tastes.  And it is sad when you consume that last morsel.  The batter is light and never oily.  It is the perfect balance of salt, pepper, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and potato starch that is rarely achieved anywhere else in the Continental United States.  Many establishments simply do not serve it.  The chicken is tender juicy, cooked to perfection without excess fat.  The skin is removed, battered, fried, and served separately for those that are health conscious.  For those that love the skin, it is a nice surprise waiting for you beneath the stack of perfect morsels of tori karaage.  \n\nWhen I think of San Francisco, I think of Tori Karaage at Dojima-Ann.\n\nNote: The only other place that I can give 5/5 stars for a non-traditional tori karaage is Raku in Las Vegas (review pending).", "author": "Paul Y."}

I was seated after a short wait and ordered. For a time though I was bothered by the fact that nobody brought me any tea. I got more worried when a lady who came in later than I did got her food first. I was not even provided the miso soup and salad which usually comes first. All was well, I guess, when I made a quick inquiry with the owner because by that time I forgot which waitress took my order.\n\nMy sashimi combo dinner again come out pretty good. There were more pieces and more variety (six types) than I recall from the past, and all were pretty fresh.  The soup and salad came right before the main plate (maybe as if the waitress was making up for not bringing them earlier). The soup was soup but the salad was disappointing in that there was no dressing. There was a time when they served it with a good vinegar dressing. (Minus one star for this.)\n\nOn a side note, I saw a big time Yelper there, and in fact sat next to her.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-24", "description": "I stopped in here for some udon because on the sign outside it has 'OSAKA UDON' (Osaka being a city in Japan well known for its udon) written in Japanese. Having read the sign, I was hoping that udon was the specialty , so I ordered accordingly, opting for a cold udon with tempura, the cold udon due to the current unseasonably hot weather in SF, and the tempura due to the fact that I was not-a-little-hungry.\n\nService was quick, and I found myself with a nice, standard-looking set of ten-zaru-udon sitting in front of me. Generally when I go to a restaurant there are a couple things I look for to see if they are doing a good job on their soba/udon. The first thing, naturally, is the noodles themselves. In this case, the speed of the service was about as fast as could be, leading me to suspect that the noodles had been pre-cooked and possibly the tempura also- according to my father, a fairly common tactic for noodle restaurants everywhere. Live and let live, I say---at least as long as it doesn't affect the flavor or my digestion. In this case, the udon tasted fine, and I was hungry. So there we go, no problems. \n\nThe second thing, however, and this is where I begin to justify the middlish rating, was the tempura. 2 shrimp, 1 pumpkin, 1 eggplant, 1 potato, 1 red pepper, 1 pimento and 1 broccoli (well, actually, 'broccoli' is plural, so I guess it should be one 'broccolo').  The tempura was filling, but that is about all I can say for it. I came in for the 'Osaka udon' and make no mistake, I never got served no BROCCOLI  in Osaka. But fair enough, this is the USA, and we are a melting pot, and I don't begrudge people their broccoli tempura, if it is nice and fresh, which this wasn't particularly. Not bad, not good.\n\nFinally the last thing that I tend to look for when eating any kind of cold soba or udon has to do with the sauce for the noodles, which contributes greatly to the flavor of what are otherwise basically flavorless noodles. In this case, the sauce was fine, but the raw quail egg served with it was less than totally fresh- it took quite a bit of mashing with my chopsticks to get the yolk to break up. I hope that leaves a nice image in your mind.\n\nSo what have we learned from this bit of dining experience of mine? I would submit the following things in defense of this restaurant: it is conveniently located. The portions are good. On the flipside, the food is marginally authentic, and it is not cheap. If you are looking for a place to eat Japanese food and happen to be in the area, it's not horrible, but neither is it a place that I would rush to eat at again. In all, a great dining conundrum in restaurant form- so it goes.", "author": "Daniel P."}

Note that I say \"most\", not \"all\" since I have not tried all the places yet. Still, I was irritated by how popular Dojima-Ann seemed (it filled up quickly even before the usual dinnertime of 6pm), yet the quality of the food was mediocre and the price was just too much for the food.\n\nFor $17.95, customers can order two entrees with rice, salad, and miso soup. Sounds like a good deal, right? Not to me; luckily I wasn't the one paying for the meal last night (early birthday treat from a friend), but I still felt bad that the value of the meal was so poor. I ordered tonkatsu (fried pork cutlets) and potato croquette for the combination; probably not the best combo to have when I'm trying to limit my intake of fried foods. \n\nThe presentation of the food was decent, Japanese-style; the tonkatsu seemed a bit tougher to chew than normal. I was disappointed with the small amount of sauce they provided for both the croquette and tonkatsu. The salad and miso soup were typical to most other Japanese restaurants.\n\nService-wise, the servers were attentive: they made sure to refill our tea in a prompt manner and bring us water when we requested it. The clientele of Dojima-Ann last night consisted of Koreans and caucasians. My friend stated there were no Japanese in the restaurant, which may indicate some lack of authenticity at Dojima-Ann (or, it could just indicate that Japanese want to eat elsewhere in the Square or go to Japantown instead).\n\nThe daily specials seemed like a better deal, but still, I had an issue with the price. The dinner at Norikonoko cost about the same, but there was a larger variety of food available in the meal than at Dojima-Ann. Also, I've had combo meals at other Japanese places for less money and more food.\n\nNot the best place to go to in general if you're craving Japanese food and a good bargain. You might be better off going to Katana-ya on Geary or go for non-Japanese cuisine in the Square.", "author": "Helene K."}

He ordered a dragon roll and couldn't eat more than one slice.  I thought, \"It can't possibly be that bad.\"  I tried a slice and there was just something off about it.\n\nI ordered the bento box with beef teriyaki and tempura.  My beef teriyaki was very tough.  I could only eat a few slices before I got bored with it.  The tempura was fine, but as with most fried foods, tempura is a little harder to mess up.  I don't like the miso they use.  My mom seemed to like the tonkatsu but probably wouldn't say it was the best ever.\n\nWe also shared an appetizer of agedashi tofu which was good.

Happily, Dojima-Ann serves it too, and its tasty, although the broth is just a wee bit watery. The sansai (mountain vegetables) are perfectly cooked, slightly crunchy and fun to eat. I like it. I also like the rice cakes filled with salmon - two generous triangles with a seaweed wrapper for a mere $3.50. The tempura looks worthwhile, although I have yet to sample it myself. Tables all around me were scarfing it down.\n\nIt's a clean, airy space with a nice view from a window seat for leisurely gazing while you enjoy your lunch.

It was a bit busy, but service was fast.\n\nFood: The food is probably a three stars. Minus 1 star for not even having a dessert menu. I was pretty shocked that they didn't even have mochi or green tea ice cream or any other type of \"Japanese\" dessert. I ordered the dinner combo with sushi (half a California roll and a couple other pieces of sushi/raw) with miso soup, salad, and chicken teriyaki. I have to say that the rice was pretty good. The chicken was a bit dry, but overall the portions are moderate especially considering the $17.99 they charged for the dinner combo (I got 5 pieces of chicken literally). Even though I was already stuffed since I can't eat a lot, the portions are small relative to some of the other Japanese restaurants with the same offerings. The soup was pretty good and they added bits of bean curd/tofu bits which is a bit different than the standard miso (more unique in my book).\n\nCustomer Service: Service was pretty good. The waitress was pretty fast. She came by a couple times to see if we were ready to order. \n\nAmbiance: It's a bit cramped though many restaurants in Japan are a bit crowded due to space limitations (perhaps imitation?). It's located in a busy part of town so you'll always see a crowd. It's quaint for a small place, but not a place for a quiet convo with a friend since there are many people and a small room.\n\nPayment: They do take credit card (several types including VISA, AMEX, and the JCB-Japanese card).\n\nParking: Parking is a bit hard though not impossible at night especially if one is good at looking for street parking. There's also several paid parking lots - though expensive within several blocks.\n\nOverall, it's a good place to dine especially because it's so central to all the shopping, Union Square, bus and other transit lines. However, I've been to other Japanese restaurants that are around the same cost/type and their food and portions are a bit better. I would probably give the food here a 3.5, but the lack of a dessert menu and the crowdedness made me give it a 3 versus a 4 for star ratings.", "author": "Tina C."}

Of course not but it does get the job done. Case in point, their hamachi sashimi wasn't the freshest of items served to me on my visit but once doused in a little wasabi/soy mixture, I could really give a s**t. Bonus points that this place was still even open and willing to take our group in at 9:50 pm on a Friday night.

It was getting kinda late and I was in the mood to eat something.  I like to eat sushi almost every week, so I made up my mind that I'd go to a sushi bar.  At first, I thought this place was primarily a sushi bar, from the first impression of the restaurant but really, it is a Japanese restaurant that carries dishes such as curry udon to tempuras.  I must admit I was tempted to order other dishes but I was really in the mood for some sushi so I stayed with that. I had my usual assortment, which was shrimp nigris, maguros, shrimp tempura roll, and spicy tuna roll.  You may find my choices as common or bland but it's what I liked the most, although I forgot to order some sea urchins.  :)  I also had the miso soup, which was very good and flavorful except for a bit too much of seaweed in it.  The maguro tuna was very good too and was cut large enough to easily span over its rice, as it well should be.  Waitresses was attentive and friendly, easily struck me as Japanese.\n\nThe place is small and cozy in space, so it wouldn't be such a good idea to bring a large crowd of starving people, as seating will be limited and you'd feel a bit crowded in too. Good to dine alone or bring a date.  The rest of other menus looks good too, that I am eager to try.", "author": "Nathan K."}

Japan is a nation like any other and its restaurants have a range of quality.  This is a downmarket, inexpensive (for Union square) restaurant, and your expectations should match that.  Think of it as the equivalent of the McDonald's in a tourist area of Shanghai.  That said, it's the cheapest Japanese food that I've found in the Union square area. I had Donburi and it was great.\n\nWhen I visited there were several groups of young Japanese tourists.  This further confirms my impression of this restaurant as a relatively inexpensive, tourist-oriented place.  \n\nAs a final note, while a correct Romaji spelling of the name may be Dojima-An, my receipt quite clearly spells it Dojima-Ann.

Something has changed, and not for the better.\n\nDojima-Ann used to be a place i used to eat at for lunch when i worked on Maiden Lane, right off of Union Square. It's one of the few relatively authentic Japanese restaurants in the area. Note: i said \"Japanese restaurants\" and NOT sushi. If you want sushi, go somewhere else as it's not their specialty even though they have a huge sushi menu. Besides, if you're REALLY an authentic sushi eater, you'd agree with me that any Japanese restaurant that doesn't have a sushi bar does not specialize in sushi. Great authentic sushi is supposed to come direclty from the sushi chef's hand and onto your plate and into your mouth within seconds.\n\nBut i digress.\n\nNow that i've clarified that I'm not going to talk about their sushi, I will say that I used to really like their various donburis, their udon, and their small dishes. It's not the best stuff out there, but it tastes more authentic than most places you'd find. The chicken karaage used to be crispy and tasty with just a little squeeze of a lemon, and their udon was light, yet tasty. You can get a natto maki there, and even maguro yamakake. Pretty O.G. \n\nBut when i went there last week, things were definitely different. The waitresses were new and didn't speak Japanese, when they've always spoken Japanese for the 10+ years i had been going there. The udon was different, the karaage was in bigger chunks and came with japanese mustard and no lemon. And service was terrible. I had to ask 2x to get a beer, and the food came all at once when we specifically asked for the appetizers first. This in itself wouldn't be surprising, but it has NEVER been this way. There is something wrong. I wonder if the owners changed hands? There was a sign up in the window that was a copy of a health inspection report. I wonder if they had to post it due to a change in ownership? I might be completely wrong, but something has changed.\n\nI will give Dojima-Ann one more chance before i give up on them completely, but the change was just too dramatic. It just isn't the same anymore. Does anyone know what happened? I was going to ask, but i couldn't get the help of a waitress, even when i was leaving.\n\nOh, and those fellow Yelpers who say it's a tourist trap? Yes it is, FOR JAPANESE tourists who are looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant. If those are the kind of tourists that eat there, there's nothing to fret. Most times i'm there, the place is packed with 80% asian people, and half of them are speaking Japanese and carrying maps. Call me crazy, but wouldn't you want to eat at the burger joint in Japan where the Americans are at since Americans would know a good burger?\n\nNet net, Dojima-Ann used to be a great place, but it has gone downhill.

A minute later, another person got seated at the empty table next to me, and the both of us proceeded to wait, first to get our orders taken, and then for water/tea to be served. My order was taken about 15 minutes after getting seated. My initial good feeling went away as the wait time drew out.\n\nTwo waitresses were available, with a third (the manager/owner perhaps) coming on to help when he finally realized the two could not keep up. However, just watching them running around made me realize that they were not very organized nor good at multitasking. (I've worked in the restaurant business before so have experience with this.) Either they need a better set game plan (server A seats the table with menus while server B get the water/tea and vice versa depending), more wait staff during the lunch rush, or those who are available need to step up and take off their blinders (I mean, it's not hard to pick up payments ready at tables in their path of travel as long as one saw them). There was another table who got seated with no menus, and it took the waitresses about 7 to 10 minutes to realize it. The person who sat them should have realized it immediately! Luckily, the patrons had their to-go menus to look through while they waited and were able to put their order in when the server showed up with the actual menu (I could tell that they were -not- going to let the waitress get away or they'd be waiting even longer just to order.)\n\nThe food itself was not bad, though I did not venture beyond the bento as they had a selection available that I had a craving for. I might go back there to try the sushi, but only during off-hours to see if the service improves. As for now, I'm avoiding during the lunch rush.", "author": "A. C."}

After a fast investigation of the sushi places in the Union square neighbourhood, I came back and joined the queue. Let me say, I have got some excellent deluxe sushi: melt-in-mouth albacore, red tuna, scallop were my absolute favourite together with some amazingly juicy sea urchin.  I asked the waitress to have spicy tuna instead of the ordinary tuna roll. After a little mumbling, she agreed (thanks God, flexibility  is always highly appreciated in those cases) and this gave me the chance to taste one of the best spicy tuna I have tried in a while.  Even the miso soup was better than the average, in particular thanks to the tofu pieces that had been fried instead of boiled.

I like their donburi's, especially the katsu-don (fried, breaded pork cutlet, eggs, and onion over rice) and tendon (fried shrimp tempura and sauce over rice).  They also have unagi-don, or unajyuu, which is eel over rice.\n\nTheir udon is also authentic. It's hard to find a really good nabeyaki udon here on the Monterey Peninsula. Dojima-Ann presents a good version of it (which is Japanese noodles - udon - cooked in a hotpot with egg, seafood, and veggies).  It's only $8.50.  They've got lots of other Japanese noodle dishes, including kitsune, wakame, natto (fermented bean curd for those adventurous enough to try it.  I use to eat natto toast with ketchup...!), and so on.  \n\nI eat sushi here, but only on the side.  For me, this is not a go-to sushi place.  They can make sushi that's not on the menu.

Did you guys order the udon?\n\nI came here with the boyfriend on a Saturday night.  We were holed up in a nearby hotel doing thesis work and wandered around to get some study fuel.  I knew I'd food coma after Dojima Ann,but I went anyway.\n\nHe had the curry tonkatsu which I didn't try because I dislike curry, but he absolutely loved it.  It came with a side of hot udon and he was slurping it down like it was from heaven.\n\nI had the tempura udon which was soooo good.  Believe what everyone says about the broth in this place:  Their udon broth is some of my favorite in the bay (the other being Norikonoko in Berkeley).   Hot udon on a cold night..ohh it was fantastic.  Just the right chewy texture in the noodle and enough scallions for each bite.\n\nWe also had sushi on the side because I can almost never just have noodles.  Always need something to switch up the taste.  We had the tekka maki and hamachi nigiri.  Both were great and the hamachi was surprisingly buttery.  \n\nIt reminded us of the standard restaurants around Japan.  No frills, just food.  They do have the California pre-requisite roll menu, but I wouldn't really bother with that.\n\nThey also have some combo specials (with hot udon and soba + unagi and rice...all this stuff) for really good prices.  Places like this make me so sad to live in the suburbs with bland food and inflated prices.\n\nWill definitely come back if I'm randomly craving Japanese around Union Square.\n\nP.S. Not sure why everyone goes into Japanese restaurants looking for chicken teriyaki and expecting it to be good.  REALLY?  I mean, really.  And then these restaurants get reviewed based on chicken teriyaki?  ARE YOU KIDDING ME.  It's cooked chicken drowned in teriyaki sauce.  It's like the culinary eyeroll to Japanese cuisine and it is by no means the measure of a restaurant.  You can tell a Japanese restaurant is good more by their miso soup than their chicken teriyaki.  ok /end rant.", "author": "J C."}

I always passed by thinking it was some touristy Japanese restaurant, until last year, when a friend came into town for her business trip and she wanted to go here because her clients from Japan would always take her here every time they're in SF. To my surprise, food here is great and very affordable price. Rolls are great (small amount of rice, perfect way to go) and soba is awesome. For a small restaurant, this place gets packed but they have enough servers to tend to everyone, always with a smile. Recently, I got here a little ahead of my friend, but the server sat me down anyway (most likely because it was just for a table of two, not like 8..so that's why it didn't matter everyone was here already..) but my friend ended up getting a lost a bit, but the server never rushed me to order or nothing.  Note: entrance is a bit tough to find for some reason (thus the reason why my friend got totally lost although she works in the area). It's on O'farrell between powell and mason. This is definitely my go-to spot if I want good Japanese food in downtown/union square area. Great service, Great food. Always see/hear plenty of Japanese from the customers..which is definitely a great sign. I'm not sure how good their sashimi quality is though, but based on the rolls, definitely great, but I'm not a sashimi snob so you can be the judge of that. 4 stars only because I've had some amazing authentic Japanese food in Japan before so I can't give 5, but in my book, definitely a great place to go :)", "author": "Karen H."}

My boyfriend, two friends, and I decided to try this sushi place out. We soon found out that not only was it conveniently located down the street from H&M (our next destination) but also a great place to grab great Japanese sushi and cuisine!\n\nThe place is small and was packed when we first stepped through the door. Luckily as we were coming, many patrons had finished their meals and were leaving. The four of us were seated within 5 minutes. We were quickly served piping hot green tea and for the dehydrated ones - iced water. I ordered a large bowl of soba noodle-udon-style soup with tempura and a salmon skin hand roll on the side. My boyfriend ordered the dragon roll, a tuna roll, a hamachi roll and a salmon skin hand roll as well. Our two friends ordered a teriyaki chicken bento box and chicken tonkatsu. We waited for less than 10 minutes before our food was served. My items were great. The soup broth was tasty but not too sweet. The noodles were cooked just right. I guess you can't really go wrong with soba/udon-style soup. My only complaint with that dish was that I ordered the one with tempura. I assumed it was going to be tempura vegetables and shrimp of some sort. Instead I got crumbs of tempura sprinkled on my soup. By the time I had my first spoonful of noodles and broth, the tempura flakes had already soaked up the broth and floated soggily on my noodles. Who really likes to eat soup with soggy flakes of tempura? I would suggest to order another noodle dish without the unnecessary tempura flakes. My salmon skin hand roll was tasty although it lacked sprouts and cucumber (it would have tasted better with these two ingredients). My boyfriend's hand roll had cucumber so a bit of inconsistency there. I tried some of my boyfriend's dragon roll and it was pretty good. \n\nOverall, the service was attentive and quick. Our tea and water were replenished at the right time. The food was tasty and \"hit the spot\". The prices were decent and lower than most Japanese sushi restaurants. Since it was technically a hole-in-the-wall eatery, there was little room for ambiance, but given the circumstances, Dojima Ann served our needs.

It is close to Union Square though, so hey, that's expected.  I had some sushi here, and it was pretty good.  Had some beer here, and it was also pretty good.", "author": "Sarah F."}

I feel that the food is good; it's not great and it's not bad.  However, what holds me back from going more often is the wait time.  The wait time is unbelievably long and I am not really sure why that is.  Every time that I've been there, I felt that the wait time was wayyyy too long.", "author": "Max M."}

It's a little tiny place, it has no atmosphere, but to me, the food is amazing, especially the chicken katsu meal.  The portions are perfect, the food is simple but absolutely delicious.  It's like a home cooked meal (if I cooked Japanese!) Everytime I've gone there it's packed, so that says a lot.  The prices are reasonable and it's in a good area of SF.  It's perfect for lunch, probably not dinner though.", "author": "Liz V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-07-16", "description": "This is definitely a place for Katsudon (pork)or Oyakudon (chicken).   They make it just like the ones in Japan.  But besides the cooked comfort food, I don't think much about their sushi or soup......\nThe combo is definitely good if you are hungry.\n\nJust keep in mind \"cooked\" food is better in this place.  Otherwise the price is okay, not cheap, but not outragous for it's location.", "author": "Millie K."}

They put a lot of effort into it, the cold soba comes with a quail egg, they have natto and other stuff you won't find most places.\n\nMy favorite thing there is the curry rice, I've had the tonkatsu curry twice and it's the closest curry to Tokyo I've had in the city.\n\nFor this price don't expect much in the way of ambiance or even legroom but the food is so good who cares?", "author": "James D."}

And when you're extremely hungry, or craving a bit of udon along with your don katsu, you can add a mini udon for $2. You can have a very filling and tasty japanese lunch for about $10 and change. It's one of the best taste-to-dollar ratio in the city.", "author": "Daniel C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-10-09", "description": "Being Japanese and being constantly disappointed by tourist traps in the city, this is a real authentic Japanese restaurant. Its decor is not anything to be wowed by, and it's service is also not 5-stars, so if you're looking to be impressed by the surroundings, this is not the place. However, if you'd like noodles, they are al dente like they should be, whether you order udons or sobas. Also, if you like Tonkatsu, then Katsudon is the best in the bay area and I agree with someone that said that it beats some mediocre katsudons in Japan. The menu is odd, in that it has almost everything for everyone, but overall, this is real casual diner food in Japan, and if you're Japanese, you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Mori K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-02-25", "description": "My family and I had a terrible experience with our waitress at Dojima-Ann last night. I ordered Today's special, changing Katsudon to Tentoji. Instead, Tanin-donburi came. So, when I told her that I had ordered Tentoji, she insisted loudly that I ordered Tanin over and over, and she said that I could get Tentoji if I pay $2.00 more. She was very rude. It made me really angry, and wanted to talk to the manager, but she refused. In the end I got what I wanted, but the experience made us very uncomfortable. I do not want to go back there. It is unfortunate because I like their foods.", "author": "Kaz J."}
