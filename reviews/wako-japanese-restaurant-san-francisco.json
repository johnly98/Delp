Out of this omakase geographic monopoly of NorCal, I've relieved I chose this destination. \n\nThe ambiance was intimate and our service was informative with each selection and unrushed at a later reservation time. I wish we were able to snag seats at the bar so we could make conversation with the chefs, but we had good seating nonetheless. The deluxe omakase was nothing short of fresh and just ethereal.. I've never been so FULL from omakase and I can say with confidence, I felt like we were spoiled by each taste that came out! It was all timed perfectly with palate cleansers here and there. Everything was absolutely toothsome and I'm here for this establishment striving off their quality.", "author": "Vivian T."}

There are a lot of pieces included in the prices, but their sizes are on the smaller end for omakase pieces.

This is the essence of Wako, where the cordial head chef, with photogenic pieces of nigiri as his instruments, is a near-flawless conductor.\n\nDiners may opt for the 10 piece nigiri omakase or the slightly elevated 15 piece set. But either way, each bite is delicately crafted and well, the pictures speak for themselves. Sitting at the bar is an experience in itself. The attention to detail is both mesmerizing, and salivating, to watch. And by sitting bar-side, you also receive the more senior of the two serving chefs, so I highly recommend doing so.\n\nSlightly lackluster for a meal of this stature ($135 if you opt for the premium option) are the appetizers and transitional dishes. The dishes, which consist of pumpkin tofu, cooked mackerel, and dashi soup may be plated phenomenally but are forgettable backdrops. So unless you are accustomed to a luxurious lifestyle or are simply a sushi connoisseur, justifying the price tag will be necessarily difficult, if not impossible.", "author": "Anderson H."}

His Foodie IQ is off the charts, and he is able to articulate his experiences in eloquently written and entertaining reviews.  Yelp is fortunate to have him as a 6-year consecutive Elite contributor!!\n\nEvery single course from our 9 course ($135.00) Chef Tasting Menu was excellent, both in taste and presentation.   The other omakase option is a 7 course for $95.00. Most impressively presented was the first course (see pic.), which was the perfect preamble that whet our appetites for the 8 other courses to follow.  All of which did not disappoint.  The only item I didn't care as much for was the fish miso soup, which I found overly salted with over done bits of fish.  If I were given a re-do, I would opt for the vegetable miso instead.  \n\nThe pieces of nigiri were my favorite.  Every bite so perfectly fresh.  I especially enjoyed the fatty, melt in your mouth Blue fin tuna belly with caviar, the Hokkaido scallop, and the live sweet shrimp, which we ordered as an additional item.  Additional nigiri is available for order.  You may opt for a nigiri that wasn't included in your omakase, or perhaps you  want more of a specific nigiri that you loved, that's an option as well.  Note that the prices on the nigiri are per piece. \n\nAnother highlight for me was the deep fried small fish.  It was described by the server as a sweet fresh water fish.  The bits of the whole fish was fried, in addition to the bones, including the tail (see pic.).   I commented to my friend that I could literally indulge in a small bowl of just the fried bones and tail, the way I do potato chips.  Incredible!\n\nWhat a pleasure to experience a true authentic Japanese restaurant, amidst the omnipresence of Chinese and Korean owned ones throughout the Bay Area.  This was evident in the high level of care and attention given to the high quality food, presentation, and service, which was well executed from start to finish.  It was so authentic that it was a little difficult at times to understand some of the servers with accentuated Japanese accents, but I'll make that exchange any day.\n\nHaving been on an \"omakase crawl\" with a friend for quite a few months now, I've had a chance to experience a wide variety of spots, including Hashiri, Kusakabe, Omakase, and Wakuriya, just to name a few.  Wako ranks right up there.  Perhaps a very very close second to Kusakabe, which comes with a little more upscale setting, but also with a little higher price point.  \n\nThe 4.5 stars out of 5 based on 440 reviews on Yelp don't lie.  That's no small feat, and definitely well deserved.  Definitely looking forward to return visits sooner rather than later.", "author": "Lori N."}

It's well balanced but definitely on the higher end of the \"balanced spectrum.\" and definitely stronger than japan, but that might be because a lot of the fish did have to endure an 11 hour flight from Asia. \n\nOverall a lovely experience in an intimate setting.

My friend and I wanted to celebrate our birthdays together, and chose Wako as our celebration restaurant. We made reservations on a weekday, and when we came in got seated immediately. There wasn't too many people so it was nice to enjoy the food, see the chefs at work, and have good convos. My friend and I sat at the sushi bar, so we were able to see the real deal, and have our sushi made by the owner himself!! The owner is super sweet, explains all the dishes he presents, and is an amazing chef!\n\nWe first started with an appetizer, which was absolutely beautiful. Then we got 5 Sushi pieces, an interim dish, and then another 5 sushi pieces. We decided not to get the extra 5 pieces as we were already feeling pretty full. We added on an extra piece of uni though .. so delicious. Literally melts in your mouth. And the night ended with an aged miso soup, and some yummy dessert. The Sushi dishes that were the most delicious we're definitely the toro and uni! \n\nWe also ordered a sake per recommendation of the owner, and it was so smooth and delicious as well.

I was particularly thrilled to taste the barracuda, (dense yet light and meaty and flavorful) and the Hokkaido uni!

Wako came up one day and I jumped on the opportunity to try this place out. \n\nFor those of you who live under a rock, omakase is literally a meal consisting of a variety of dishes selected by the chef. During the experience, you have the opportunity to order different items at the end but the actual experience is all selected by the chef, so be prepared to eat anything and everything! \n\nWako is one of those small joints that only offer omakase. There's a sushi bar and a handful of tables so reservations are almost required. There are 2 omakase offerings, a $95/person and a $135/person. The difference is an extra 5 pcs nigiri set and a dashi soup for the higher priced set. \n\nI loved how the sushi chef and staff was so thorough with what item you were eating and from what region in Japan the fish came from. The dishes were well thought out and intricately created. Flavors were bold and full of life, sushi was super fresh. What an experience! \n\nIn one of our courses, my friend noticed a little hair in the dish. Bringing that to the attention of the staff, they showed extreme empathy and gave us a bottle of sake on the house. That was super sweet of them and really appreciated. Overall, I had a fantastic time there and can't wait to return. Thanks for the amazing service and food, Wako!", "author": "Rockne H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-15", "description": "I have a soft spot in my heart for Wako because it was my first Michelin-starred restaurant and my first omakase menu when I moved to the Bay Area three years ago. I loved everything they served at that time, including my first monkfish liver and an extraordinary chawanmushi (also my first) topped with uni. As a result, I was afraid to go back for fear that things wouldn't be as good as I remembered them and I would be horribly disappointed. Thankfully, I was wrong, and when I went back at the end of June it was just as good.\n\nAmbiance and Service: It's a small, warm space, with lots of wood. Welcoming and relaxing rather than intimidating. We were a few minutes early for our reservation, but were greeted and seated immediately. I prefer table seating because I don't like making conversation or reacting to food in front of the person who prepared it (just in case something isn't great). There's also a bar for those who prefer to watch the chef at work. \n\nThe staff is friendly, deft, and efficient, working as a team to quietly tend to things before you even notice you need something. There was even a designated server whose job appeared to be just keeping an eye on things and swooping in to replace dropped napkins, etc. Again, all without being overly precious or intimidating the way upscale dining can be. My partner secretly told them it was my birthday, but they didn't make an embarrassing scene, which I hate. Instead, they simply wished me a happy birthday by name when placing the dessert, and threw a small handful of birthday confetti. I appreciated the reserve. \n\nFood: We ordered the #2 tasting ($135 per person) and added on the wagyu beef with summer truffle. Once again, everything from start to finish was delicious, artfully presented, and interesting/varied. I won't go over each course in detail (see pictures), but in terms of the sushi, I particularly enjoyed the chance to try barracuda, which was a first for me, and, predictably, found the red nose amberjack, uni, blue fin tuna belly with caviar, and the add-on wagyu beef with summer truffle particularly enjoyable, although all the sushi were high quality fish, well prepared and presented. The chef dabs each piece with the perfect complement amount of wasabi and soy as well.  \n\nI also want to take a moment to mention the warm dish, which was a Japanese sweet fish with fig and pickled Japanese ginger. I was somewhat nervous when it arrived at the table because it included the fish tail and skeleton, fried. I've had a similar warm dish at Kusakabe and found it wasn't enjoyable eating the tail fin, etc. (it was dry and the flavor was also underwhelming). This fried tail was crunchy and flavorful, the fish meat bundles were juicy and warm, and the fig was an unexpected and delicious accompaniment. The pickled ginger was also an elevated version of a palate cleanser to the dish. \n\nOverall, Wako continues to offer a pleasurable, memorable, and superior dining experience for a surprisingly good price, especially in comparison to other SF omakase spots.", "author": "Katherine A."}

We went with the second Omakase option and by the end of the meal, I was so full.\n\nLet me just try to list my favorites here - The Firefly squid in the appetizer kinda set the expectations for what the rest of the meal was going to be like. Boy has squid ever tasted this good. Each and every single nigiri I had was out of this world - the red snapper, the striped jack, the barracuda, were all absolutely amazing. The chef also hit it out of the park with the Anago sushi. The A5 Kobe beef tasted as good as I had always dreamed it would. \n\nBefore I move on to my most favorite part of this meal, let me talk about the one puzzling part of my experience here - he order in which the nigiri was served. The chef didn't serve us all in the same order. He always kept serving us in different orders. It did affect my experience a little bit. \n\nNow with that out of the way, let me talk about the delightful Shirago. It tasted kinda like goat brain if you've ever had the pleasure, but only it was much much better. It was so good I had to order it again a la carte. It was then I realized what Shirago actually is - cod milt; yeah, look it up :( But never the less, it tasted like an umami cloud.\n\nIf I only made more money, would do this at least once every month.

It's easy to make reservations on their website or OpenTable!  If you request to sit at the bar, you'll have to call them to let them know & they call you a few days before to confirm it. \n\nParking- Plan to come early because parking is difficult. After circling around many times, the waitress told us to try parking on 8th street between Clement and Geary, which is only a few blocks away. We were able to find parking there! \n\nThey have a 9-course and 11-course omakase. We got the 11-course ($130) because we thought the extra items would be worth it! What I like about this place is that they give you the a la carte menu in the beginning so that you can follow along and see exactly what you're getting. \n\nThey give 4 nigiri at a time and separate that with other items! I loved all their nigiri and I was so surprised that they included blue fin tuna belly, Wagyu beef, and uni! Most places I go to, they don't include all of them and if you want it, you have to pay for it separately. Their toro just MELTED in my mouth, even their chu-toro (medium fatty tuna)!! The wagyu beef was not bad, it was a little too torched for my taste, but it was still good! \n\nThe a la carte menu is different every day, and if yours has a negitoro hand roll, I recommend getting it!! Instead of the toro being finely chopped up like other places, the toro was actually in pretty thick cuts. For $7 that was a steal! I definitely will order more of that next time! \n\nOverall, very friendly and helpful staff. I like the ambiance- they play music, which makes it easier to talk with your party.

This place really exceeded expectations and 100% deserves its Michelin Star for interesting, creative, authentic, gorgeously delicate food.\n\nWe went with the pricier omakase which included an extra hot soup and 5 more nigiris than the cheaper omakase.\n\nAbove all the overarching taste of the meal was light, delicate, nuanced, but very balanced umami.  For me personally it turned out to be the perfect palate.\n\nThe standout dishes for me were:\n1) Appetizers combo which were a super interesting mix of flavors/textures, each perfectly executed.  The most delightful piece was the cream cheese with tomato (which doesn't really taste like what it sounds).\n2) bluefin tuna nigiri marinated in jalape\u00f1o soy sauce.  Surprising taste but it works soooo well.  Very creative.\n\nAlso very good:\n3) sakura mochi with tiny ground chicken bits in clear dashi soup.  I've had similar dishes at other restaurants but this was fluffier and just better done.\n4) horse hair crab with crab miso nigiri, served in a little bowl.  Very crabby and fresh.\n5) green tea gelatin dessert was so delicately made it looks like it was made under a microscope.  Very light taste but not simple, a bunch of different things going on in the dish.\n6) seafood egg cake was perfect balance of savory and sweet.\n7) wagyu beef nigiri, with spicy daikon topping.\n8) another nigiri piece (I forget the fish) that tasted like it had light ume (plum) sauce.\n9) simmered yellowtail - pleasantly lightly sweet.\n\nThe only piece I liked slightly less was the sea eel, which I felt could have used just a little more sauce/flavoring or slightly less eel so it doesn't taste bland.  Also was not a huge fan of their sushi ginger, which seemed a bit too sweet / reminiscent of cheap sushi ginger to me, compared to what other high end sushi restaurants serve.\n\nOn a stand-alone basis there are sushi restaurants that serve better fish or showcase better knife work (even though these guys are also quite good!) - but their kitchen dishes are amazing, and I love that they take risks - and delight - with unconventional things like jalape\u00f1o shoyu.\n\n5/5 highly recommend.", "author": "Sallie D."}

Wako's 9-course omakase does not excel at everything but that didn't matter when it came to the nigiri. The nigiri was so incredible, blasting your senses with so much flavor and life that nothing else in the world mattered except you, the rice, and the fish. Seriously. \n\nWild red snapper from Nagasaki - This had to have been laced with Hogwarts floo powder because I felt like I was being taken on a culinary adventure through the Japanese landscapes in 5 seconds. How does a piece of fish make me feel like this? \n\nWhite squid with sea urchin - Fantastic blast of flavor from the urchin complimented by the blandness of the squid. Best uni I had since Jean George's.\n\nFlounder - Great. \n\nSeared Scallop from Hokkaido - The best scallop I've had my entire life. I envisioned a bunch of scallops relaxing by the seashores when I ate this. Am I really saying all of this in a Yelp review? \n\nMackarel - The juiciest mackarel I have ever had. My dad (aka lover of all mackarels) needs to eat this once in his life. \n\nSea urchin from Hokkaido - Tasted like a fresh breeze from the sea. How is that even possible? It's yellow. \n\nDietary preferences - Very accommodating. My dessert was a lychee shaved ice that was light, crisp, and refreshing. \n\nBirthday - Celebrated it at the chef's counter. Chef Tomoharu Nakamura prepared all of our nigiri in front of us and was the friendliest host I've ever interacted with. Thank you for welcoming me and making me feel special on this occasion. \n\nMost Michelin restaurants are worth one try and then on to the next. Not this one. We will most certainly be back for more.", "author": "Ee Vonn Y."}

I've been to other Omakase places with really stand-out (and large) pieces (the shiroyaki at Kusakabe or A5 wagyu at Akiko's) but Wako provides an amazing variety of fresh fish and flavors.

We were able to get a spot pretty easily since it was a weekday (called in about 1.5 wks ahead of time). The restaurant itself is very small (sushi bar + ~4 small tables). Service was nice but not on the same caliber as other Michelin restaurants I've been to where I feel like I'm waited on hand and foot (not that that's a bad thing, if anything I felt a bit more relaxed). They were very kind, explained each item well, and made sure our food came at the perfect pace.\n\nOur meal included the following:\n1) Firefly squid: The miso brought a nice zing. Crisp blanched asparagus went well w/ creamy insides of the squid. (3.5/5)\n2) Various small apps: Gorgeous presentation. (4/5)\nItems included:\n-Seaweed w/ strawberry vinagrette: tartness of the strawberry went really well w/ seaweed's oceany taste and slimy texture was fun)\n-Sesame tofu w/ wasabi (tofu had almost mochi like stickiness w/ deep bitter taste from sesame\n-Cream cheese/shiso/tomato: Japanese cream cheese so it had a nice sweetness\n-Wagyu croquette w/ red miso: Croquette ok but sauce was great.\n-Deep fried sea eel/shiso/uni butter: Uni & eel's flavors came out but needed a bit more salt\n-Sweet egg\n\nVarious nigiri courses. Loved their combos. Very unique compared to other spots I've been to. Quality fish, rice could've been a bit more flavorful. Pieces on the small side but w/ everything I was at a light fullness so I'm happy. (4.5/5-5/5)\n3) Red snapper w/ cherry blossom, lemon, rock salt: Fruity flowery flavors paired well w/ the tender snapper\n4) Halibut w/ spicy daikon: The oil on top was delicious but fish a bit chewy\n5) Ink squid w/ uni: 2 types of creaminess came through w/ the taste of those dried squid snacks + an extra kick\n6) Striped Jack w/ ginger: Fish had almost a scallop-like texture\n7) Seared scallop: Bitterness from the char went well w/ sweet sauce\n\n8) Sakura mochi w/ braised chicken, bamboo shoots, & sansho leaf: Chicken a bit dry but mochi was delicious & not pounded completely so still had some grain texture. (3.5/5)\n\n9) Red nose amberjack w/ yuzu: Also had scallop-like texture but less oily than the striped jack\n10) Barracuda w/ ginger: Fishy taste but w/ texture of light whitefish\n11) Bonito w/ chives, daikon pulp, garlic chip: Super light piece w/ garlic flavors enveloping it. Loved it\n12) Mackerel w/ sea kelp: Had rounded sweet taste and brine from kelp cuts through the fishiness\n13) Cold Cherry Smoked salmon: Smoke brought out salmon's natural sweetness.\n\n14) Steamed mackerel w/ snaps peas, clams, spinach: Most average dish. Fish was mostly tender. Broth was good but nothing special (3/5)\n\n15) Horse hair crab w/ crab miso & ikura: Crab envelopes all your senses thanks to the crab butter. Very compact and smooth texture\n16) Hokkaido Uni \"taco\": Everything was sweet, even the seaweed.\n17) Bluefin w/ caviar & gold: Almost like melted butter. Very few tendons so it was extra smooth\n18) Sea eel w/ sansho: Leaner saltier flavors. Slightly gritty\n19) Wagyu: Extra peppery (which I love) but still has a chew. Imagine the best burger you've ever had condensed into one tiny bite. Amazing\n20) Seafood egg: Like cross between egg and and cake. Salt & sweetness both very prominent.\n21) Cherry blossom tiramisu: 1 of 2 dessert options. Wasn't a huge fan of the hard candy on top. A bit too sweet for me but interesting (3/5)\n22) Panna Cotta: 2nd dessert option of the night. Good but standard (3.5/5)\n23) Housemade Chocolate: A nice little extra for the end of the meal.\n\nOverall my friend and I both really loved our meal. Everything was tasty, intricate, and unique. Price was also better than Omakase and overall taste was better too. Would definitely come back.", "author": "Vivian C."}

But seriously, when I last came here in 2014, I didn't feel like the menu tasting, ambiance, and/or food quality was at the level of a Michelin Star restaurant (or the hype!). \n\nFortunately, my BFF forces me to be more open-minded, and at the recommendation of 3 other friends, I FINALLY decided to give Wako another try tonight. And man, have you guys grown! \n\nFirst of all, we sat at the bar in front of the head chef. I had bad flashbacks of the awkward dinner here three yrs ago, but it was quickly dispelled with the humorous and attentive head chef. We quickly went over dietary restrictions and preferences. He noticed the BFF was left-handed and made the necessary serving adjustments (served her nigiri facing the other way), and checked in on us throughout the course of our tasting.\n\nThere's 2 tiers (9 course for $90ish and 11 course for $120ish). We went with the 9 course, but ended up adding in two more pieces of nigiri...which equated to the same price as the 11 course anyways. The servers were extremely knowledgeable about each item being presented. You'd think this would be the case at every restaurant, but it's not true. Plus, they quickly refilled our teas throughout the night, never allowing it to get past lukewarm. \n\nWako, you've won me back over. Michelin Star well deserved.

I used to love love love Wako when it first opened and have recommended it to so many friends.   \n\nThe restaurant has drastically increased its price, almost doubled!  which is not a major concern to us if the quality and service meet expectation.  Perhaps this is the reason the restaurant was not full(used to be always full).  Unfortunately other than most of the nigiri, The hot dishes and desserts have became nothing but blanded taste.  Sooooo disappointing as I have always looked forward to their creative hot dishes and the pannocotta dessert.  This time the hot dishes were extremely fishy, nothing special.  The pannocotta was nothing but a few pieces of fruits topped with lime shavings...barely any mouse on bottom. \n\nService, the tallest Chinese waitress was just too tired of her job.  She has been with the restaurant since it begun.  Not once she made us feel welcome.  This time was even worse.  She brought our dessert and said:\"someone's birthday?\" We said \"yes\". She then quickly sprinkled some birthday sparkles, said \"happy birthday\" then walked away like wind.  I am not exaggerating, who thing was about 2 seconds!!! OMG!!!! If it was sooo much of an obligation for you to say a heartless congrats...please don't do it to ruined our mood!!!  \n\nOne nice thing worth mention was there's a Japanese waitress, we think she is new, and has always carried a very sweet smile each time she came to our table. Which was pleasant.\n\nValue....totally not worth it like it used to be. $360 without any drinks for 2 with this type of service, and not so wow food, not worth it!", "author": "Kelly L."}

I had been scouring lists after lists trying to find something quiet, intimate but high quality food when I stumbled upon Wako. \n\nThe interior is pretty small and the decor is nature/minimal. We opted for the grand omakase which I feel like was a greater \"value\" for the food we received. If we had gone with the regular menu, we would have probably ordered extra or the same amount of money as a grand omakase. I prefer my sashimi on the buttery side so I preferred the later half of the menu. I never knew sweet shrimp or sea eel could taste this good. Out of the entire menu, we ordered an extra order of sea eel. It's $12/piece but it was worth it. The A5 wagyu beef didn't even taste like beef. Just pure goodness. \n\nService from the server could have been a little better but having the chef in front of us was a nice treat.

I've been here a few times for omakase and just dinner. The atmosphere is intimate, clean and pretty. The service is ninja like in the sense that they attend to your needs quickly and quietly. The fish is fresh (obviously) but my favorite part is how different it is every time I go. It's like real omakase where the chef actually just gives you the best that's available. That means in-season and they need to recreate and season pieces according to what is the best available. Each nigiri is creatively prepared and then they mix in a few kaiseki courses for a nice balance. \n\nI sometimes feel kaiseki courses are included to fill stomach space or skimp on quality but not here. The kaiseki courses are just as interesting and deliciously made with quality and rare ingredients. The price ($95 or $135 pp) especially for a Michelin in sf, is very reasonable and probably adds to why I love it so much.

I recommend you try to reserve early and get bar seating because you can see the chefs make your pieces carefully.

Basically half of the meal was sushi or sashimi and these pieces just tasted average to me. During the sushi course, they hand out menus for you to add additional pieces if you are still hungry.

From a fish stand point, Wako is more about the sushi experience (the rice to fish ratio, the combination of flavors, the order in which the food is served). So if you came here for good, real sushi, you came to the right place.\n\nService here is top notch. Attentive, knowledgeable and calm, they really payed attention to our table and the pace we ate. We also ordered hot sake and the presentation was beautiful (not to mention practical since it actually kept our sake warm). The ambiance is also very charming and contemporary, but space here is SMALL. There was only seating at the bar and a couple tables available (which can't accommodate more that a dozen people or so) in the entire restaurant. Talk about exclusive. Important note: get reservations! Parking here is also a troublesome issue. You're only chance is street parking (you'll eventually find something, even if it's three block away)\n\nFood wise, the 9 course omakase included everything from multiple appetizers, grilled dishes, nigiris, soup and desserts. Every fish that they served included where the origin of fish came from (ie. Spain, Japan, ect). My personal favorite was the Uni but if you're not a sea urchin fan, pass it along because this has all that seafood-y goodness. My date's favorite part of the night was the Wagyu beef (which my vegetarian self had to hand over to him). Pace yourself, because you're not just enjoying your meal, but you're enjoying the experience. I thoroughly loved it here, and while I can't dine like this every night, it was for sure a treat.", "author": "Rebecca L."}

Each dish was also creative in its own way, and left your taste buds raging and wondering what it would taste next.\n\nI sat at the bar, and talked a little bit with the sushi chef.

While I have had TONS of sushi in my life, ranging from cheap-ish to expensive and reservation required, this was actually my first foray into a full on Omakase. Many people have detailed what goes into the meal so I won't delve into all of the details but here are some highlights and notes. \n\nThe service is immaculate. Very attentive yet perfectly paced, they pay close attention to how slow or fast you're eating and bring the dishes at a good speed. My date and I went with the 9 course and I really enjoyed every component. We ordered a hot sake and it came in the coolest case that kept it warm and felt fancy. \n\nAll of the fish was insanely fresh. It had the cleanest most pure taste imaginable and sometimes was very surprising. The tuna felt richer and more fatty than I'm used to and the salmon was leaner and tougher than I expected. It flipped some of my assumptions based on where the fish was caught and how it was treated. Without a doubt one of the best bites was the seared scallop - so succulent and beautiful. \n\nI was a bit disappointed that the nearly $100 fixed meal didn't include the Waygu beef nigiri but we had try it and each got a piece at $12 a pop. Not something I would do all the time but worth it for a celebration. \n\nThe most underwhelming part of the meal were the deserts, both of which I thought were just okay. To be fair that's not why I'm there at all and there's always ice cream at home. Bonus fun fact: the bathroom is insanely cool.

I highly recommend ordering a full bottle, then after dinner making your way to the bookstore down the street to do some damage!\n~ Parking can be tricky in this area, so come early to be safe\n\nPRO TIP:\n- Don't be that guy who brings a DSLR, sits at the sushi bar with his date, and tries to document every single piece (or attempts to Snapchat it all, moment by moment).

I would definitely recommend this restaurant over Kusakabe in the Financial District.\n\n[Food]\nThe nigiri used in the 9-course omakase was pretty standard, but I felt full at the end. I actually enjoyed the Mushimono (steamed egg) the most. Given that I normally hate steamed egg, I was surprised how I fell in love this dish. It was fluffy and didn't taste like egg at all. We also ended up ordering the Wagyu and Uni nigiri pieces as add-ons at the end, and both of these off the a-la-carte menu were fresh and flavorful. \n\n[Service / Decor]\nThe restaurant is small, with limited bar seating and tables. There was only one four person table. My only issue with my meal started at the beginning. The 4-person table ahead of me ended up sitting at the table for way longer and ran into my 8:30pm reservation (that I had made 3 weeks in advance). Given it was already so late, I wished the server had spoken up and asked the party sitting there to leave. We ended up waiting another 20 minutes before being seated. If you can, try to get a bar seat! The sushi chef is amazingly skilled and it would be fun to see him craft the pieces right in front of you. The servers explained every piece and dish that was brought out.

I enjoyed that Wako's omakase meal was more than just pieces of nigiri but was more like a multi-course kaiseki meal that included things like small bites and soup. There was definitely a good variety of interesting dishes served. \n\nIf I'm being completely honest though, a lot of what I was served wasn't exactly my cup of tea. Don't get me wrong though. It was all done well! But I'm pretty sure there's no way any chef will ever be able to prepare cod milt in a way that will make me crave it. (Cod milt is fancy code word for cod sperm. Yes, you read that right. Sperm. What.) I'm also personally not a fan of baby eels swimming in egg yolk, abalone, monkfish liver, or firefly squids. Again, this is all personal preference. I'm sure everything was done well. I'm just kind of picky sometimes. :/\n\nThe service was great though! It basically felt like there was a 1:1 ratio of diner:staff which was definitely noticeable. My napkin slipped off my lap three times (every time an accident!) and each time it was replaced quickly and with a smile. \n\nWould I recommend Wako? Yep. It's a unique and interesting meal.

You have the option to add on nigiri or a few kitchen items after the sashimi round, so we added on grilled calamari and the wagyu beef nigiri. \n\nEvery single item was unique and satisfying in its own way. My standout nigiri were the six-hour smoked Scottish salmon, torched scallop, and Wagyu beef. The uni with salmon roe was delectable and the warm egg custard was perfect. I liked everything in their own way and I wish I could eat like that every night! \n\nThe service was on point as expected. We were sat at the sushi bar, which made for a tight space for servers to bring and take away plates but also allowed for an amazing experience, being able to watch the sushi chefs in action.

First of all, when one goes to a Michelin star restaurant, there is a certain set of expectations we might have. Perhaps wrongly, but one expects upmost creativity, a unique ambiance and to be impressed by the unusual and mysterious side of food. Wako was none of that, thus I am not sure it deserves that Michelin star by today's standards. Then again, referring to the Michelin guide, one star signifies nothing more than a \"very good restaurant in it's category\". It's not a restaurant you would make a detour for (2 Michelin stars) nor a restaurant worth a special journey (3 Michelin stars). By this logic, one star is fitting. You can see why this review is tough now... They do have excellent quality seafood and some great combinations. Staff are wonderful and extremely attentive.\n\nThe tasting menu covered a variety of dishes, several were served either sashimi or nigiri style. Simple, fresh and presented nicely. The fish is excellent and cuts are perfect. If you are a sushi fan, this really is an amazing spot. But then again, there is so many phenomenal sushi spots in SF area and Wako did not distinguish itself a whole lot. I liked it, but left unimpressed and a bit hungry. \n\nAs far as the ambiance, i feel like it's a trick on the Michelin star name. It has this casual sushi joint vibe, lots of wood, but also lacked in creativity or uniqueness in my opinion. Basically, don't go here to impress or get impressed, that's not what this restaurant is about. This is a spot for a genuine sushi lover, who is ready to drop top dollar for the freshest fish and enjoy it in a chilled out atmosphere.", "author": "Alex P."}

It had variety of small dishes, nigiri, sashimi, miso soup and dessert. I love how they had a menu on the side where you can see where each fish came from. My favorite was the home made ikura with uni (from Russia) and also the abalone, the sauce was the abalone's liver, super interesting! All the fish were pretty fresh, however I felt there were some nigiri that didn't deliver. The otoro was seared, but a little too over cooked and just didn't melt in my mouth at all. The waygu A5 beef was not impressive, it was kind of dry. The eel nigiri was pretty fishy tasting, I was not feeling it. \n\nAt the end, they are very sweet and lit up a candle and had a card that said happy anniversary. The dessert was OK, didn't quite like some of the tastes. \n\nOverall this place is decent, but I prefer Kusakabe more. It delivered, but not to my expectation as a Michelin star.", "author": "Natalie L."}

When one of them performed one action, the other would help out simultaneously automatically. And they often alternated their task between dishes. It was almost like an unstated performance.\n\nUnlike Wakuriya, I actually enjoyed the food here. Wakuriya's dishes were fancy and exotic, but they weren't comforting. It was like eating non-functional art. In contrast, I enjoyed nearly every dish at Wako simply for the taste & texture.\n\nThe sashimi here was by far the best I've ever had. A lot of it had to with with the smooth, almost smokey, wasabi that lined the sashimi like a film. The wasabi film that was around each piece of sashimi that gave them a firm, yet super smooth and perky texture. Each piece was an orgasmic delight.\n\nI definitely want to come back soon.", "author": "Nathan Y."}

The first one was at Kusakabe, which is an impressive sushi meal.\n\nI heard a lot of good reviews about this restaurant, and hence the expectation was quite high. Compared to Kusakabe, this restaurant is more traditional, I suppose. The flavour is more subtle in most of the dishes, more conservative. The fish on average is really good but not mindblowing except for some (uni, shima aji, otoro) which are amazing. \n\nMy issue with the sushi served here is the amount of rice is just not enough compared to the fish. I and my friend agreed that we could barely detect the rice on the sushi - almost like we were eating sashimi. This experience just emphasize to us how important the balance of fish and sushi rice is. \n\nAlso, in general they tend to put yuzu zest or shiso leave on almost every items. Sometimes it is great, but some time it distract from the main ingredient. For example the uni served with shiso leave, which I am not a fan, since the uni flavour is very subtle, the shiso leave just ruined it. Having said that, sometimes it can be great, for example, the ikura served with yuzu zest - a very good combination. \n\nThe service is flawless. The restaurant is nicely decorated. The only flaw of this restaurant that I can find is the balance of the sushi - which is ironically the most important thing. I would rate this a little below Kusakabe. Maybe a 7.5/10 and Kusakabe 8/10.\n\nI almost feel bad to deduct a star from this review, but for the price that I pay (~180 inc wine tax, tip), I kinda hope they give more rice. So yep, the food is 5 stars but considering the price, it's a 4 star for me.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's the note I took during the meal \n\n- Salt cured fish eggs with such radish, edamame and flowers.\n- Appetizer:  seaweed salad with strawberry and cucumber; ankimo with Dicon paste and ponzu sauce, edamame, miso cheese with cherry tomato, deep fried yam, bluefin tuna, and corn fritter. The Ankimo (fish liver) is amazingly creamy and sweet. \n\n- 1st Sushi course : \n- Madai with yuzu zest.\n- Ichidai -wasabi is little strong.\n- squid with uni and yuzu zest. Squid is very good very tender.\n- Hair crab\n- Eel daichi soup with water shield.\n- Sashimi - chutoro, prawn, kanpachi\n- grilled ayu stuffed with tofu inside, sea urchin, okra, eggplant. I don't think this dish is not constructed well flavor wise, in my humble opinion. All the item are sweet making the disk too sweet.\n- 2nd Sushi course:\n- Shima aji\n- Smoked king salmon - very good smoke salmon. \n- shinko\n- bonito with garlic chip and spicy daikon paste\n\n- tempura dish sea eel, prawn head, plum salt - very good. The eel has a very nice texture, wrapped in shiso leave impart a nice flavor. The prawn head is really good\n- 3rd Sushi course:\n- uni hand roll with shiso leaves. I think the flavour of shiso interfere with the uni too much. It's a nice idea though, but I'd prefer not to have shiso leave here.\n- otoro with caviar and gold leaf. Toro is superb! Melt in the mouth. Caviar add the saltiness\n- anago\n- A5 wagyu beef \n\nExtra order: Ikura with yuzu zest. Great combination.", "author": "Thanapat W."}

My girlfriend and I had a reservation for dinner at the sushi bar (I definitely recommend sitting at the bar vs at a table since I enjoy watching the sushi be prepared and getting to chat with the chef). The omakase is picked by the chef and if you want you can order more pieces at the end of your meal. The menu changes throughout the year so what you might see in one review might not be what you'll get upon visiting but I can say that this place has earned my trust as every piece was delicious. In terms of the type of sushi, this place is more traditional (compared to a place like Robin which has more innovative offerings). I prefer the traditional to the hip so I quickly fell in love with each bite. Along with the sushi, I enjoyed a few glasses of sake that I chose with the help of the staff's recommendations. Each glass was enjoyable and offered different tasting notes while still going well with the sushi.\n\nService-wise, I felt the staff was extremely knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. I couldn't have been happier with the service I received and felt that they added to the meal with their knowledge of the food and drink recommendations.\n\nIf you are looking for a high end, traditional sushi spot and don't mind the high end prices, I definitely recommend Wako.

Probably only seats about 20 at most. You have the choice to sit at the sushi bar where some chefs are making food, or one of the tables. (Must decide for reservation).\n\nMENU: They hand you a small menu right when you are seated. It only has two pages that describe the 9 course and the 11 course meal. You can order more nigiri that they have during your meal. They will hand you another small paper menu that describes what nigiri they have for the day. \n\nMY EXPERIENCE: We came here for me and my boyfriends anniversary, and we were pleasantly surprised! Being a couple that usually eats fried food and boba ever other meal, this was a huge step up. LOL. We were at first a little intimidated, but our server described every course that they placed on our table. \nWe chose the 11 course meal (130$ per person). Everything was AMAZING! Such great presentation and memorable taste. Their portions are definitely small, but everything tasted so fresh and great that we literally did not care because our experience made up for it. \nPersonally, I'm not that big of a nigiri person. After a while, the raw food was a bit overwhelming for me but nonetheless I thought everything was perfect. I just wish I had a better stomach for it. My boyfriend is literally obsessed with nigiri so he was in heaven. LOL. All the seafood was so fresh, never had anything like it. \nTheir fried food.... ahhhh I'm crying a little just thinking about it!! So unique in flavor. The grilled fish with ginger on top was my favorite. :') \n\nAnd their Ama Ebi fried head was THE best I have ever had. Worth every penny. \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: They were attentive, informative, and kind. Thank you to the chef who greeted us upon entry and exit! \n\nCONCLUSION: We will be back!!

I loved the ambiance of the place, it had a very clean rustic feel to it with all of the wooden accents. I'm used to omakase where it's mainly nigiri, however the omakase here is a bit different where they will bring out a lot of random dishes (kind of like kaiseki style), and serve the nigiri near the end. I thought the nigiri pieces were extremely small, probably half of what it usually is compared to other omakase restaurants.

BUT I didn't think any of the nigiri really needed either for the flavor, so that says something.\n\nAll the nigiri was great, but there were a few stand-outs.

We love sushi but never had omasake for an unknown reason. While in Japan we got to eat a Jiro and since then we were wanting to have omasake here to see and compare but never really got a chance til now.\n\nI made reservations online because I thought eating at a table would be more intimate for his birthday, plus we have sat at the bar at Jiro and seen it all (you need to call in and request bar seating).I honestly thought sitting at the bar here would be as intense as Jiro but from what I saw it didn't seem like it at all. If you've seen the Jiro documentary you can understand why you would feel nervous. However it wasn't until we got there is when I became aware that the main sushi master (is there a formal term for this?) makes the dishes for the people at the bar and his apprentices are the ones who makes the dishes for those at tables.. shucks!\n\nThe main difference is that here at Wako the courses included a soba noodle soup, shredded tuna, lotus chips, etc. it was not all nigiri besides the egg dessert which is what I was expecting because that's how it was at Jiro. At one end I'm glad because it had us try things that we normally wouldn't ever order ourselves,  but on the other end of the spectrum I wish we had more nigiri because that's the best!\n\nThis was our first time trying the cod milt and oh my goodness was it so f*cking delicious.

Glad we did because as other reviewers mentioned, you do seem to get better fish and of course more since it's 12 pieces of nigiri. \n\nSo many courses it was hard to keep track but I did take pictures of each nigiri. Some of my favs were the Otoro (omg melts in your mouth, I had to have a moment where I just closed my eyes and tuned out the world), the cherry blossom salmon, the wagyu beef (never ate raw before but it's such high grade it's like sushi) and the sea eel (not like what you typically expect at all. Super soft and buttery, not fishy like eel is). For the starter, there was ice fish which I wasn't a big fan of because of how strange it looked (clear transparent fish with little eyes) and a bit fishy but good to try.

Some pieces were amazing, others not so much. The appetizers and small plates were..... interesting. Ginger strawberry seaweed was fun. A few bites were questionable.

As I've only been to a handful of these kinds of places, I was eager to try it.\n\nWhile small (~22 seats, split between 9 bar seats and small tables), I wouldn't describe it as intimate. It had some \"bustle\" to it. Appropriate for the city, perhaps?\n\nService was quite good. Since the place was pretty full, servers were all over the place. Took an extra moment or two to ask for more water, for instance. Everyone was friendly and as attentive as they could be.\n\nThe food (why we're there, after all) was fantastic. Sushi and sashimi were amazing, and a real pleasure to watch (from our seats at the bar) being prepared. Cooked dishes were presented with equal flair and equally great results.\n\nAll in all, a great experience.

The bar is the place to be, you can watch as the chef warms the rice and fish to prep your nigiri so that the fish fat just melts in your mouth. Here's a pro-tip: eat the fish as soon as the chef plops it in front of you to get the full flavor of the fish fat.\n\nSome variety of fish I hadn't tried before, ever try parrot fish or cured barracuda?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-05", "description": "Wako is one of the best sushi places I have ever been to and was an absolutely delightful dining experience. I came here with my friend on a Tuesday night and we had reservations at the bar. We both got the omakase nigiri sets.\n\nFOOD: The omakase nigiri set comes with small plates, 12 pieces of nigiri, soup, and dessert. The small plates were exceptional and varied. There was a fresh persimmon salad that was inside a hollowed out persimmon, fresh tuna, croquette and other bite size appetizers. All of them were great but the main attraction was of course the nigiri. \n\nThis sushi was the best I have ever had. I was sick with the FLU and super meh feeling and this STILL tasted amazing. First, the sushi rice was actually sushi rice which is already a huge plus compared to most places. It was soft and pillowy. What was even better was that the rice wasn't just sweet but also had a bit of saltiness with it.\n\nAll of the fish was exceptionally fresh and melt in your mouth. The fish came from all over the world and were definitely higher quality. Since the chef chooses and makes each piece individually when you are ready, I ended up eating many uncommon fishes such as abalone and clam. Surprisingly, they were amazing! My favorites were the otoro and yellow tail belly but I even loved the Uni which is normally dislike! \n\nThe miso soup and dessert were fine. A great end to the meal but nothing super amazing.\n\nEXPERIENCE/ATMOSPHERE: Sitting at the counter is great because you get to see the chefs work and they are very attentive in carefully spacing out your meal. They are happy to answer any questions to have about the fish. There is plenty of time to leisurely chat with your dining partner so make sure you like each other's company!\n\nThe restaurant itself is very intimate and small which I think allows you to really get the whole experience of enjoying the preparation. However, it would not be suitable for a big party. \n\nThere were two chefs who both were Japanese. They seemed like they were trained in Japan and very passionate about making their food taste great but also look beautiful. Furthermore, the chefs were very kind and engaging!\n\nLOCATION: This place is located on clement in the Richmond. There didn't seem to be any parking issues when we went.\n\nPRICE: The particular omakase I got was $100 per person which is quite pricy. An individual piece of sushi ranged from $6-8 per piece. Therefore, this place isn't cheap. However is it worth the price? If you are just looking to stuff your face with sushi then maybe not. However, if you are looking for a complete experience with sushi quality above most restaurants, even those on Japan, then I would really recommend checking Wako out. Again I was sick and this place was still enjoyable and was the best sushi I have ever had!!! I definitely would go back again!\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: I see some complaints about the size of this sushi compared to other places in japantown or Irving. Personally, I do not think this is comparable to those places. Although the pieces are smaller and more expensive, the quality is much better (and I say this as someone who loves sushi from Irving and jtown.) This sushi melts in your mouth and taste so fresh, the quality is definitely a few grades above. Also, it is authentic compared to the places I have been in Japan. Yes there are some places in Japan that have cheaper and bigger sushi like the quality in your run in the mill sushi places in sunset but there is also higher end sushi like that found in Wako. If you are willing to spend more for amazing sushi then I would really recommend trying out Wako. Its Michelin star was well deserved!", "author": "Jocelyn K."}

I did a search around the city and figured I might as well go for a place that has a Michelin star. I had made a reservation online and decided to call in later that evening to try to get the sushi bar seating. It worked out well as they were able to accommodate us at the sushi bar seating at an even better reservation time. He changed it on open table for me as well.\n\nWe both ordered the $100 12 pieces nigiri option, which also came with a few hot dishes as well. I don't think I've ever exclaimed \"omg\" after taking a bite of anything, but this happened a few times that night. Our favorites were the filefish with filefish liver on top, smoked cherry salmon, blue fin tuna, and wagyu beef. The marinade and toppings on those were minimal but the flavor and texture combined were amazing. Everything was great, but we both couldn't stop talking about those four for awhile. The cool thing was that the chef also showed us the certification on the wagyu beef to show authentication. \n\nWatching the chefs prepare the nigiri was a treat as well as you can see all the effort that is put into  each piece. He also checks on you to see how they taste, of course my response was always a succession of nods and exclamation of how good it tasted, which probably made me look like a bobbling idiot. \n\nI don't think I was a big fan of the hot dishes except for maybe 2, one being this warm savory egg custard dish that had a surprise in every bite. It was literally something different each time I went in. The nigiri were the highlights so I'm glad I did not choose the cheaper omakase option which would have featured less nigiri.

I also wished the sauces were more different between the different fishes to distinguish each nigiri piece from the other. \n\nAnother miss was the ratio between the fish and the rice for the nigiri pieces. The rice was the right size, but the slices of fish were a lot smaller (barely covering the rice) even for Edo-style sushi. Portion size was way off and be forewarned that you may leave feeling a little hungry after the meal.\n\nKnifing skills also needs some work. The otoro was not cut properly because there was a stubborn muscle/vein right in the middle that neither my date or I can bite off. This is a novice mistake that you would not see at Kusakabe or at Uni Sushi (before the chef retired).\n\nOh, and also docking a star for lackluster service.\n\nIn summary, if you are looking for a traditional sushi restaurant away from FiDi, Wako may be an option.

We came here about 4 months ago closer to the time Wako opened up and the experience was equally excellent. \n\nWako offers one of the best Omakase offerings in SF and at $76, I think they provide a fairly good value for what you get.

As an avid omakase frequenter in the city, I was thrilled to finally get a reservation for you as you are right by my house and your prices are decent considering other prices for omakase in SF. \n\nAnd I will say the service by your wait staff was great, the interior decor was charming and welcoming, and the sake pairing we had with our meal was fantastic. Even though I thought the chef put too much wasabi on the nigiri, the selection of fish was fresh and I thought the rice was perfectly seasoned on the nigiri. The snow crab chawanmushi was also one of the best I've ever had. \n\nHOWEVER, I did not appreciate being treated like I was inferior to your regulars. You know it's bad when I've had six glasses of sake and I immediately rush home to write this review because that's how upset I am. It's freaking 10:45pm on a Tuesday and it's Valentine's Day and I'm sitting here typing away like a madwoman. \n\nFor a 10-seater sushi bar, it's inevitable that you see how your fellow diners are treated. We had the misfortune to be seated tonight next to some of your regulars. Right away they were greeted and treated differently by the chef and the staff. That's fine - our service and treatment were great and it's understandable that a restaurant would treat its regulars differently because hello they're regulars - the special treatment is probably in part what keeps them coming back. Who doesn't like feeling special?\n\nHowever, as the night progressed, I started seeing notable differences between the regulars and the rest of the customers. Larger portions of fish, extra gold leaf and caviar, and what really pissed me off, the option to order extra items a la carte at the end of the nigiri service that wasn't offered to anybody else except your regulars. \n\nTo not even offer the option to order more nigiri to your other customers as we watch you lavish your regulars with extra pieces of uni, toro, and wagyu is completely UNACCEPTABLE. It's a NUMBERS game. If 75% of your restaurant are first-timers and their initial feel of your restaurant is one of favoritism and inequality, then you've alienated and lost a substantial customer base. You can make your regulars feel special and cared while at the same time not alienating your new customers. My boyfriend and I would have gladly ordered extra pieces, which in turn means more profit for you. By not even offering the option to your other customers LITERALLY means you are turning away money. \n\nWhen I'm paying over $250/pp and the feeling I walk away from your restaurant is one of disrespect, there is a serious problem. Wako, you've lost my business and what's even more sad, you've completely neglected what true sushi-yas are all about - that feeling of welcome, of strangers coming together into your home and sharing that warm feeling of delicious food and the love and care you've put into making it. I'm truly disappointed by this experience and am so mad at myself for choosing you to celebrate a special occasion.", "author": "Kaisi G."}

Unfortunately we were unable to reserve seats at the bar for the full experience, but nonetheless we both found Wako amazing. \n\nThe setup of the restaurant was as expected of a high-end sushi restaurant--intimate, clean, and modestly decorated. The noise level was minimal and perfect for conversation, and for a high-end restaurant, the atmosphere was not overwhelming or intimidating. \n\nWe chose the $92 9-course meal and did not get the sake pairing. Sitting away from the bar, the courses were brought out and explained by a waitress. Regarding the food, this was both our first omakase experience and it was simply amazing! The food and presentation were mind-blowing definitely exemplified the chef's creativity and skill. \n\nThe service was okay. Our food was brought out in a very timely manner, but we did have to prompt our waitress a few times for more tea as we ran out of a few times. It was also hard to hear the waitress at times (warning: courses may be inaccurate or missing details, I stopped asking her to repeat herself after the first few times).\n\nThe courses:\n1) Seaweed with vinaigrette\nRefreshing \"shot\" of seaweed to start the meal.\n\n2) Assorted appetizers\n4 small appetizers bites with very cute presentation. We really liked the eggplant and the fish skewer. The other 2 were oyster and veggies that were okay.\n\n3) Sashimi\nSmall bowl with 2 types of sashimi was perfect. Only wish we were given more sashimi!\n\n4) Potato and fish soup\nThis was my least favorite course. The fish had little pieces of bones in it that I assume was intended to be chew-able, but I personally was not a fan of the little bones. I had one bone (or fish scale?) that surprised me with the first bite. The soup still tasted great and my boyfriend had no complaints about the fish bones and loved it.\n\n5) Nigiri round 1 (4 pieces)\n6) Nigiri round 2 (4 pieces)\nWe were brought 8 pieces of chef's choice as well as presented with a menu to order additional individual pieces. They were all delicious and with great rice to fish ratio. The rice had a really good consistency and texture. Flavoring for each piece was done by the chef and generally was great. The wasabi was a little bit heavy on maybe 1 or 2 of the pieces though (on the salmon nigiri, I teared up a bit and trust me I love wasabi). \nWe also ordered the wagyu nigiri as recommended by our friend and this piece was the absolutely most delicious thing I've ever taste. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the wagyu nigiri!!! Hands down, our favorite chosen by the chef was the scallop nigiri, which I also recommend.\n\n7) Mackerel with daikon\nPersonally I had some reservation with this dish due to the tiny fish bones in it, but besides the bones everything was amazingly delicious. Presentation was very nice.\n\n8) Miso soup (option of red or white)\nWe both chose red miso as the waitress describe this as \"richer\". Loved it.\n\n9) Dessert (option of persimmon or strawberry lychee pudding) \nWe got one of each types of pudding. Overall they were not that memorable, but we still finished both cleanly.\n\nOverall this was a phenomenal first omakase experience.

Based on fellow Yelpers reviews, Wako sounds like a solid choice. Went and ate, did not disappoint a single bit.\n\nMade a reservation for three for a Sunday dinner at 8:30pm. Sat down and went straight for the Omakase 7-course. (The dishes didn't come in exactly 7-course style - I guess it has to do with chef's arrangements about what to eat first, what to follow, etc)\n\n#1st course\nCherry Blossom Shrimp Seaweed Salad, plus some small fish/scallop: A.\nOne main reason I am giving it an A for these slightly ordinary dishes is due to the fact that the presentation was super nice. (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Hf2ofAbVdZ0F6soFHvXKtw&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw) Especially that small pea plus scallop ball thing... very cute and you can tell how much time the chef put into making this omakase a perfect experience. The choices of those ingredients made this course a very nice start of the dinner.\n\n#2nd course\nBlue Fin Tuna and Sea Bass Sashimi: A-.\nThis was probably the best blue fin tuna I have ever had. Very fresh, and definitely tasted like some premium fish. The sea bass was very good too. These two kinds of fish are not my favorite so I might be a little biased here but even so I enjoyed the freshness a lot.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CxIYljpHTRWnInvXmHTFcQ&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#3rd course\nRed Snapper, Lotus Root and Braised Seaweed: A.\nThe red snapper was slightly grilled - the time and temperature must have been controlled very well, which allowed the snapper to keep its juice inside the meat while its slightly crispy on the outside. Brilliant.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KXiIVnQGP2YpV1DmunNlSQ&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#4th course\nTempura, Ginger Marinated Tomato, and Green Tea Soba etc: A.\nAnother presentation-win here. Those little tempura pieces were perfectly fried. Green Tea Soba was very refreshing after the grilled red snapper dish, and matched the tempura super well.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7YDvrNnKM1goSEPYULHjAw&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#5th course\nMackerel and Amber Jack nigiri: A.\nI never knew raw mackerel tastes that good! With the special house sauce the chef put on both of these fish, my mouth was very satisfied.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_bkCDlfpBupJy5DTUYrVtg&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#6th course\nSalmon and Spanish Mackerel Nigiri: A.\nKeeping it up the high bar! Both were very fresh of course. Very heavy salmon taste which you can never find from local Gaijin sushi joints.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qdtri84cFgMCKffuKDLBbQ&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#7th course\nAbalone nigiri: A+.\nI was blown away by this. Super fresh abalone, super nice texture and again the house sauce really enhanced the overall feeling of the nigiri. Wow.... very good.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=AiEw225cNY25wma1q1z7lA&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#8th course\nAyu fish nigiri: B+.\nDon't get me wrong, this dish would probably receive an A in other typical sushi restaurant but the standard is too high here. \n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gebJHt2r-YxJzkWWNKMW9Q&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#9th course\nSnow Crab nigiri and Tuna Belly nigiri: A+.\nAnother mind-blowing dish. The tuna belly was super, SUPER good. Completely feeling the fat. Snow crab was handled very nicely - didn't have the sea salt water taste whatsoever but with heavy, HEAVT crab smell and taste to it.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2SN8vfWMUkYXiNKPThjJGw&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#10th course\nRed Miso Soup: A-.\nPretty good. One of the friends got regular miso and he tried ours, and said he regretted not getting red type instead. It's got a pretty unique flavor in it in a good way.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RKCUJUmJ1GVz1Pb__g6BjA&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\n#11th course\nAlmond Ginger dessert: A.\nEven the dessert received tons of attention! Looks like a 6-star hotel high-tea dessert, this almond ginger pudding-sort-of dish was a nice way to close the dinner. Heavy almond and ginger taste. With all the kiwi and berries added, very enjoyable.\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=K0hc8lccRf35Naw94YmGaQ&userid=Juh-g9sATZppHvMmNmHfFw)\n\nWith all of the above, 3 bottles of beer, and 2 bottles of sake, it came out ~$120/person out of the door. This price tag could easily be 1.5x elsewhere with this quality and quantity of food.\n\nI love Wako. There will definitely be a second time, or even third, fourth, etc.. No doubt.", "author": "Simon C."}

I made reservations for Mother's day a couple days beforehand and was glad I did - the restaurant only has 4-5 tables and bar seating. I would have preferred sitting at the bar but they only had a 5:30 reservation for table so I took that one instead. They do take down a credit card number in case you flake - so make sure you are going to go before you make the reservation. \n\nParking in the Richmond district is always tough so make sure to come early - we were stuck in SF traffic and called to let them know we were running a bit late. The restaurant was very gracious and understood but wanted us to keep in mind that the next table seating was at 7:15. Anyways, we actually arrived on time so it was fine. \n\nMy mom and I both ordered the 7 course omakase for $82 - the omakase nigiri for$100 would have been overkill - though, the 7 course didn't come with the wagyu onigiri so I was a bit bummed - should have done better research beforehand. \n\n1) The first hot dish was my favorite. There were five items - fried squid and tuna with caviar were my two favorite items. This dish comes out shaped like art. \n2) Sashimi plate - not super fresh... I've had better. \n3) Vegetable dish - they do have fava beans - which are a favorite of mine. \n4) Tempura - fish cake tempura, tomato, and green beans. I like fish cake...but that was about it for this dish. \n5)  Onigiri - the squid and toro onigiri taste the best. Drooooool. The others are average. They do tell you that the sauce is already drizzled on the fish so no sauce is given. Although I do like the high grade ginger they gave us. \n6) Hamachi dumplings - this was an extra dish I ordered - very average and fishy, I was expecting something else.. these were more hamachi balls rather than dumplings. \n7) I was SUPER excited for the dessert given all the reviews - they had green tea mousse w/ a blackberry on top... unfortunately I'm allergic to blackberry so I asked if there were any substitutes.. none :( The desserts were all premade. \n\nHmmm, I noticed a lot of people said they prefer Wako to Kusakabe but I liked Kusakabe a looot more and the service was much better. Oh well, at least I tried it and could compare the two.", "author": "Annie L."}

This is definitely one of the newer omakase places but it's still pretty decent for being in the Richmond district. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here almost a year ago to try the omakase and we chose the 7 course omakase I believe. \n\nWe started off with some warm dishes such as tofu and some other dishes that were standard. The best part was obviously the sashimi/ nigiri portion. The Chu toro and Uni were amazing to me! The Uni was the  right consistency with no fishy smell or taste which is good. I've had some Uni where it tastes extremely fishy and it was gross. But this Uni was good! I don't remember all the other fishes but I do remember that they were decent and not bad at all. \n\nAnother highlight was the dessert! It was a peach panna cotta, it had a strong peach taste which was not too sweet but delicious! It was the perfect ending to a good meal. \n\nI would definitely come back again to try omakase to see what other new fishes are on the menu.", "author": "Stella J."}

We are sushi lovers and have traveled all over to find the best bites. The sushi at Wako varied tremendously. The best pieces (tuna) were amazing, but in-between there were several dishes we were underwhelmed by. This is a pricy place $240 for 2 and we expected the best in the city, but we have had several other sushi dinners of similar cost with better quality and quantity sushi all around.", "author": "David A."}

Each piece was carefully prepared and a completely different experience than the last. Even my boyfriend, who is not usually a fan of sashimi, loved the experience and is excited to go again.\n\nTips: Get a reservation. Get the pricier omakase (it's worth it). Try to get a seat at the bar (we sat at a table, but will definitely shoot for the bar next time). Come hungry (you will be completely stuffed). Get sake to accompany your meal (if you drink).", "author": "Yanni L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-04", "description": "We sat at the sushi bar and we each got the 7 course meal.\n\nThe first course were several small bites that included a seaweed salad, firefly squid, fried scallop, egg cake, and house made tofu.  Decent, but nothing incredible.  The second course was tuna and halibut sashimi. Very fresh and tender.  The third course was a cooked fish that was just a tad overdone to my liking.  Flavors were okay.  The fourth course was fried baby fish with seaweed. This was my least favorite course. The fried fish had a strong off putting flavor. Tempura was decent, but again not mind blowing.  Overall, I was unimpressed with the warm dishes we received. I found them to be just average, and would have enjoyed the meal more if I had just done the nigiri omakase. \n\nNow on to the nigiri. We were served atka mackeral, ink squid, chinook king salmon, scallop, blue fin tuna in a jalapeno soy marinade, uni, toro, sea eel, and tamago. We ordered blue shrimp and snow crab in addition to the pieces we received. \n\nEach piece was delectable and melt-in-your-mouth fantastic. My favorites have to be the scallop, uni, toro and sea eel. Ahh, and the tamago is a MUST. The fluffiest I've ever had. It tasted like pound cake, especially since its served warm. \n\nWe were then given miso soup and desserts. My favorite of the two desserts was the panna cotta. \n\nService was friendly and attentive!\n\nMake reservations to sit at the sushi bar to really get the best experience!", "author": "Noelle H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-03", "description": "TL:DR: 4.5 stars. The restaurant itself is comfortable, cozy, and unpretentious. Very creative nigiris, amazing desserts, and overall great value! \n\nReservations at the sushi bar were surprisingly easy. I called on a Wednesday and was able to secure a reservation for 7pm that same Saturday. Never mind that I had omakase on Tuesday and already had plans to eat it again the next day. Omakase all day every day!! Or in my case, every other day. I really hope mercury poisoning is not a real issue... \n\nTomo has an air of dignified reserve about him. He's not flashy but you can tell that he knows what he is doing. It almost reminded me of Jiro and his understated dedication to his craft (To be fair, I've never actually been able to secure reservations at Jiro's any of the times I've been to Japan. This statement is made purely off of what I've seen in the documentary and from stalking the front of Jiro's restaurant, catching glimpses of him, and hoping desperately that he would invite us in). Not to say that Tomo's not funny when he wanted to be! The other sushi chef, Atsushi, was equally great, very sweet, and consistently checked in on us to make sure we were enjoying our meal. \n\nIn my opinion, Wako stands out from the other omakase places in the city for a couple of reasons: \n\n1. Interesting marinades and toppings \nExample 1: Raw abalone with ground up liver sauce \nExample 2: Cold smoked cherry salmon \nExample 3: Blue fin tuna lightly torched and then marinated in jalapano soy \n\n2. Appetizer/warm dishes are very flavorful and well-balanced. \nExample 1: Uni Chawanmushi. The egg custard was exceptionally flavorful. You can really taste the dashi stock, which in my opinion, gives it a more umami flavor and really underscores the taste of Japanese cuisine. \nExample 2: All the fried stuff (fish, potato ball with wagyu, lotus root, octopus) were lightly battered, fried, and just really well done. \n\n3. Last, but definitely not least, AMAZING desserts made by one of the waitresses. I think the desserts alone are worth coming here! We had two different types of panna cotta esque desserts (blackberry currant and green tea with white choclate) that left me speechless. \n\nWhat prevents this from being a 5 star review is because: \n1. The rice was a bit too soft and sweet \n2. The temperature on some dishes and the temperature change between dishes were very extreme. For example, the anago (Japanese eel), is heated in the oven and comes out blazing hot. Not only was this bizarre for nigiri, I actually burned the top of my mouth slightly!\n3. Wagyu was not as delicious as at Kusakabe", "author": "Xinxin W."}

I like this place, but seriously  400+ bucks to eat here.

I feel i always walk past this place and i never take notice.  i came here with my friend and we both got the 7 course omakase.    The waitresses here were all so sweet and helpful.  They answered all our questions.   So allow me to describe each dish in order\n\n1)The first dish that came out had 4 small plates. which had a squid dish, sesame tofu, oyster and a warm egg.  All of it was so good and super tasty!  You can tell just how fresh everything was!  \n\n2) The second dish was the sashimi.  It was two slices of tuna and two slices of butterfish (which is my fav!)  Super fresh as well and you don't even need the soy sauce. \n\n3)Dish number 3 was a dish with pink sticky rice on the bottom and salmon baked with something i forgot on top.   The sauce that went with this made it outstanding.   you will be licking the plate of that sauce.  \n\n4)Dish number four was my #2 favorite of the night (i'll get to #1 soon).  This was a fried shrimp with green tea salt powder.   It was amazing!  I wish i had more of this.  The green tea salt powder was powerful enough to make this dish stand out.  \n\n5) The plate of nigiri came out with 8 different choices for you .   I don't remember what they all were, but i enjoyed all but 2 of it. \n\n6) For your 6th dish you have an option of the regular miso or the red miso.  My friend and i both got the red miso.   It comes out in black and red bowl so you can't even tell what color it is.  It does taste different. It's not as salty or as tofu-y (if that is even a word).  My friend described the taste as it having an herbal taste with a hint of seafood  taste\n\n7) For dessert we had the passion fruit parfait.  Super light and tasted very tropical \n\nand finally my number one favorite dish.  We ordered this in addition, to our omakase.  As egg lovers, we just had to get the tamago.   It wasn't just any tamago it was the one without rice, just the egg itself.  When it came to our table it looked like a pound cake.  When you eat it, it sure taste like a super moist pound cake.  This was my #1 favorite dish from this place.  I feel Wako is underrated.  This place is one of the best Japanese place I've been to outside of Asia.  I highly recommend this place if you are a huge sushi lover.", "author": "Belinda C."}

It is fairly easy to get a reservation using Opentable, but do call if you want a seat at the bar. I tried calling on a Wednesday but the bar seating was already full. Nonetheless, still a great experience. \n\nThe restaurant was small with maybe four or five tables and a bar. It filled up quickly. For two, we decided to order the $100 omakase nigiri set. In addition to the set, there were several extra items from the chef sprinkled in with our meal. At first, I thought the pace of the meal was rather quick, with dishes coming soon after we finished the small plate/box appetizer and first 3 piece nigiri plate. I was worried I'd be hungry after! But the pace slowed down significantly after the first two. We ended up finishing our meal after two hours and felt full and satisfied.\n\nBlue fin tuna belly with caviar and edible gold, uni with salmon roe, anago, and wagyu were some of my favorites. Really delicious and beautiful food presentation! Compared to Kusakabe and Sushi Yoshizumi, I would say Wako had the most comfortable, laid-back atmosphere. Service was also excellent. Definitely deserving of their Michelin-star, and a great place to go for birthdays or a special occasion.", "author": "Christina G."}

After tailgating Cherylyn N's (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg) tour of Japanese, specifically omakase,  meals, she named this as a must try destination.  With an upcoming birthday for my pescatarian friend, I made an early weeknight dinner reservation in early December.  A tad late due to the horrendous City traffic from downtown, we were seated at the rear table near the kitchen.  The dining room, comprising of around six tables, was 2/3rd full while the sushi bar was fully occupied.  The menu is pretty simple with an extensive selection of sushi, sashimi, and small plate choices.  There are three omakase menus: a nigiri sushi and sashimi exclusive one, nigiri only, and a seven course mix of these with cooked and raw small plates; we chose the latter.  \nBeing exhausted from the hectic journey here, I wasn't fully focused on itemizing our courses, given the wide variety of fish in various sashimi and nigiri form. \nHere is a summary of the various offerings in our meal:\n\nThe two specials on the menu were the striped jack (sashimi) and the golden eye snapper. \nYellow tail baked apple and scallop bites were delicious as well as the fish cake tempura, as a different take.  The nigiri offerings included salmon, scallop, and yellow tail as one course and saba, king crab, and otoro as another course.  \nWanting to explore a bit more, I added yellowtail dumplings as a supplement.\nWe were offered the option of red or white miso soup (I had the red).  \nThe dessert was not memorable except that it was topped with a chestnut.\n\nThe restaurant is not very large and the tables are pretty close together so hope you aren't shy about sharing conversations.  I tried to add the abalone as another supplement, but they had another party waiting for our table so will save it for next time.\nThe consensus from my other Yelp friends who've reviewed this place is a rousing five stars (4.5 by Cherylynn, but rounded up).\nJust don't walk in here expecting a budget dinner or, as Ken K. dubs, \"jive ass rolls\" (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DS0Idr2XDhz5e7ZfSy0dYA) or bento boxes.

But I think the service at the sushi bar was what just put the cherry on top.  Our chef was very friendly. He mastered the \"have enough banter with customer while making sushi to make them feel welcomed but not enough to over power/hinder customers' experience\" - if you catch what I mean.   Our server was astute, agile, and personable.  And together, they really made the customers feel comfortable. According to our chef, anago (salt water eel) is Wako's specialty and was most definitely my personal favorite at Wako.  My husband loved the otoro (fatty tuna) and wagyu beef as well.  \n\nThe aesthetic of the restaurant is minimal and clean - quintessentially Japanese.  The wood provides a warmth, while the steel and concrete/tile keeps the place feeling understated and allows you to focus on the food.

Parking on Clement can be insane especially during peak dinner hours. Be prepared to circle the block multiple times as even an illegal space was hard to come by!\n\nD\u00e9cor is typically Japanese with judicious usage of modern plank-wood on the walls, wooden furnishings and a pretty sushi bar. The vibe was chic and contemporary and more importantly, giving the restaurant a clean look.\n\nAs we wanted to try a good cross section of the menu, we opted for a table.\n\nSUSHI:  Wako is high-end. I savored each piece of fish in one mouthful with slow, deliberate bites, as there would be no reruns. Breathe in the pristine freshness, relish how each piece was delicately seasoned and sauced by the chef and notice the textural difference between each fish. Close your eyes if you must lest you might be distracted! Ala Carte nigiri prices are steep. The menu prices are priced per piece, not a pair and you can spend a pretty penny in a hurry! \n\nHere's a low down of today's nigiri specials and every fish was divine!\n\n1. Hirame (Halibut $6) : a very popular white fish with light and delicate flavor.\n2. Shima Aji (Striped Jack $6) : delicious, like a cross between kanpachi (amber jack) and hamachi.\n3. Kamasu (Japanese Baracuda $6) : like hirame, it was soft, juicy and light.\n4. Kinmedai (Golden Eye Snapper $8) : its texture was not too soft or too crunchy, with a slight sweetness and not fishy.\n5. Akamutsu (Rosy Sea Bass $8) : a rare find, not to be missed! A white fish that tasted like toro! (fatty tuna).\n\nThe kitchen entrees were equally glorious with some minor hiccups. Even the soy on the table was doctored for better taste. Presentation was the essence.\n\n1. King Crab and Baby Scallop Tempura ($12), light batter and the King Crab were beyond delicious! One piece was given the \"isobe\" treatment using roasted seaweed (nori) for added flavor. (5/5)\n2. Kaisen Chawanmushi ($9 Savory Egg Custard) made with jidori eggs (from specially raised chickens but who cares?). I appreciated the uber smoothness of the custard and the snow crab. But a dollop of uni? Didn't blend so well to my liking with egg custard! (4/5)\n3. Blue Fin Tuna cheek on Hotplate (14) was just so so as I preferred my tuna raw. But this was just me! (3/5)\n4. Grilled Ink Squid Legs ($8) was nicely salted and crunchy (4/5)\n5. Simmered Golden Eye Snapper Head (9) was a delicacy although your cat would love it too! I would have preferred it to be served warmer (temp-wise) and was too sweet  for my liking. (2/5)\n6. Grilled Sanma (pike mackerel) with Matsutake mushroom was definitely a work of art! The fish was completely deboned and the mushroom and sweet ginger complemented the umami flavors. Well done! (5/5)\n\nThis is the place to come if you are a purist seeking out authenticity and traditionality. I can see careful attention was given to every detail. The server was young, very pleasant although not quite as professional as I would have expected at a high-end place like this. All in all, we had an enjoyable evening!\n\nGochisosama deshita!

Very silky and there was a hint of sesame taste to it.  The giant clams were not very giant. I would not recommend it. The egg topped with sea urchin was mediocre at best. The monkfish liver also had an almost bland taste to it, even though the texture tasted like it was meant to be more creamy. I was a fan of the tuna cheek steak however! It was a very interesting dish. You can really taste both the tuna and steak to every bite. I don't remember which nigiris we got, but I know that each piece was either $9 or $10. For that amount of money for ONE piece, it was not worth it in my opinion.  I also enjoyed the green tea mochi as a dessert.", "author": "Janel L."}

However not all the fish tasted fresh, but there were many other dishes that were tasty.\n\nThe regular Omakase:\n- appetizer with 4 cute mini dishes: one of my favorites of the night\n- amberjack & red snapper sashimi: fresh and got me excited for the rest of the meal.\n- fried fish ake and veggies with lotus veggies fried: also yum!\n- baked yellowtail apple bottom and egg: unique dish and very rich in flavor\n- halibut, salmon, stripe jack, and scallop nigiri: everything on this dish was good, but nothing unique in flavor.\n- Tuna belly & bluefin tuna: yum\n- crab and salmon roe nigiri: decent\n- soups were a little too salty - both kinds\n- sweet egg cake: very sweet but too full at this point to finish\n\nThe chefs Omakase:\n- Barracuda, golden eye snapper, red snapper, stripe jack, giant clam: everything was decent, some had the fishy taste which I wasn't a fan of, but the snappers were my favorite on this nigiri dish\n- abalone, yellowtail, gizzard, and uni nigiri: my favorite was the yellowtail and uni on this dish. Usually I'm not a fan of uni, but it was super fresh that I didn't taste the fishy/oceany taste!\n- Otoro from Spain: Otoro is always super soft and melt-in-your-mouth :D\n- Anago: cooked fish was tasty - mom loved it\n- A5 Wagyu: Delicious as well!\n\nThey provided my mom a panna cotta dessert for her birthday which they did it pretty cute because they came with a few confetti pieces that dropped all over the dessert before placing the dessert in front of my mom. It was indeed tasty and we all ended our meals with a piece of chocolate.\n\nThe meal went from super tasty to decent which it should have kept up the tastiness, but the fish probably wasn't too good that day.

For Wako, I will make the trek across town and deal with it.  It's worth it!   \n\nThe other half and I arrived at 6pm on Saturday evening, having made a reservation.  The waitress immediately lead us to the sushi bar where we met Atsushi-san and Tomo-san.  The sushi bar seats 10, making it a very intimate experience.  Throughout the service, the patrons at the sushi bar talked and toasted with Atsushi-san and Tomo-san.  They were so personable and made us laugh with their lighthearted conversations.  They introduced themselves to everyone and asked us our names.  It was a joy to watch them as masters of their craft of preparing authentic sushi by showcasing knife skills and displaying culinary creativity.  We even got to practice speaking a little bit of Japanese with Atsushi-san.      \n\nWako is a small space with a pleasant, modern-sheik ambiance to admire.  The wood sided and tiled walls are simple and classy.  You can appreciate the thought that was put into designing the interior.  Besides the sushi bar seating, there are small tables available as well.  \n\nThe service is impeccable.  Besides having Tomo-san and Atsushi-san taking care of all the sushi bar patrons, all of the waitresses are incredibly attentive, professional and friendly as well.  Whenever a cooked course came out of the kitchen, the waitress would go into detail on what she was serving us and teach us how to eat them.  I really appreciated the extra effort.  Our plates were removed promptly.  Our glasses were constantly being refilled even if they were still half filled.     \n\nThe other half and I wanted to try an array of what Wako had to offer, so we both ordered the 7 course omakase ($68 pp).  It included 3 small plates, 4 pcs sashimi, 1  bincho-grill, 3 tempura, 7 pcs nigiri, miso soup and dessert.  I won't go into detail about everything that we ate, but I will confirm that everything was exceptional!  In terms of quality, presentation and taste - 5 stars for sure!  I've never had such exceptional tempura.  All the cooked dishes were simply amazing.  Grade A fish selection was melt in your mouth goodness.  They also have real miso soup offered in white and red.  We tried one of each and they were equally delicious.  The omakase was filling and we certainly great value for the price.  Our total tab of 2 omakases and an order of hot sake ($15) came out to $200. \n\nWe already plan to return to try the beef tasting course.  Next time, we'll opt to order sashimi and nigiri on the fly.  The market selection changes daily, so this will surely keep us coming back.  Also, will be happy to see Tomo-san and Atsushi-san!

Amidst the cockfest of douchebags and losers, there's a real gem...somewhere. If you look hard enough that is. That gem is Wako.\n\nQuietly opening on May 27th, Wako took over the old Murasaki spot and is the 4th high-end sushi restaurant to open in SF after Akiko, Maruya, and Kusakabe. Wako's opening was not published anywhere and I happen to stumble upon it on Yelp after going through 100+ of sushi listings. My friend had mentioned that Clement doesn't need another sushi restaurant. I initially agreed with her but after thinking about it, Wako is one of the few authentic, Japanese owned and operated Japanese restaurant in the area (Okina is another). \n\nHailing from Sanraku, Wako's owner and sushi chefs serve up traditional Japanese fare. On the menu are nigiri, maki rolls (no dragon or gross bukkake rolls), binsho-grilled items, and izakaya dishes. All nigiri is individually seasoned and sauced so no soy sauce or wasabi is provided. Beware that the nigiri is charge by the piece and not by the pair so your bill will quickly rack up if you order strictly nigiri. Expect to spend about a $80-$100 pp. \n\nThey have an excellent sake and beer menu. Our waitress recommended a great junmai (I forgot the name but it was $10/glass) which I guzzled down. She also recommended the best beer I've ever had (and I don't usually like beer): http://bit.ly/1xOAq1R. It was pricey at $9 a bottle but I've never seen this banana beer before. It was smooth and light with a nice, sweet banana finish. Get this!\n\nAs suggested by the sushi chef, we decided to go with the smaller omakase so we can add additional a la carte items from the menu. \n\nOmakase Option #1: Two small plates, 1 binsho-grill, 7 piece nigiri & 1 miso soup for $43 or you can do the Omakase Option #2 that adds sashimi, tempura & dessert for $68.\n\nOMAKASE OPTION #1 ($43)\n*Braised Eggplant  & Housemade Sesame Tofu: http://bit.ly/1ubIk0t\n*Gindara: Grilled Black Cod: http://bit.ly/TNYXoa\n*Nigiri: Tai, Aji, Bonito, Canadian Salmon, Uni (Hokkaido), Otoro & Anago: http://bit.ly/1xOdM9W\n*Miso Soup: http://bit.ly/1lq9n7i\n*Complimentary Matcha Dusted Chocolate Truffles: http://bit.ly/1xOjSXE\n\nThe eggplant and tofu were great subtle openers. Loved the custardy texture of the tofu. As most of you know, I despise cooked fish but the generous portion of gindara was perfectly grilled and the flesh was super silky and moist.  \n\nThe best part of the omakase (as always) was the nigiri. The progression was on-point: from light to fatty fishes. The fish was pristinely fresh and each nigiri was individually seasoned and garnished with items that best complement the fish. Our favorite was the otoro; it's like sex in your mouth!\n\nWe had a choice of housemade miso or red miso for our last course. We received one of each to share. The red miso is a lot saltier so I liked the regular miso soup better. It was a bowl of comfort with velvety cubes of tofu.\n\nThe complimentary housemade matcha dusted chocolate truffles were like crack! They need to package and sell these babies!\n\nA LA CARTE ITEMS:\n*Tempura ($12): http://bit.ly/1jmvAz9\n*Gindara Tu Nasu: Braised Miso Black Cod ($9): http://bit.ly/1s8taNT\n*Chawanmushi: Steamed Egg Custard w/ Uni ($8): http://bit.ly/1iqJEr8\n*Ankimo w/ Ponzu Gelee ($8): http://bit.ly/1pnYPcc\n*Otoro ($8/piece): http://bit.ly/1hRfcMd\n*Matcha Daifuku: Matcha Mochi w/ Red Bean Paste ($4.50): http://bit.ly/SCIQIX\n\nBecause no Japanese meal is complete without tempura in Mr. NSS' eyes, we had to get an order of tempura which was one of the best I've had. The batter was airy and super light. The gindara tu nasu was bowl of savory, umami goodness and would have been perfect with a bowl of steamed rice. I loved the silkiness of the chawanmushi but the uni was a bit too brown for my liking. \n\nBack to cold dishes, the ankimo was deliciously buttery. Not Ino-san status but still very good. I liked the nouvelle touch of the ponzu gelee. The second otoro piece was sexlicious as the first. This is a must order!\n\nDo order dessert here as everything is housemade. The matcha daifuku was bomb! It had a fantastic chewy, carblicious mochi exterior with a delicate matcha flavor and red bean filling. Lolia S. would definitely approve. \n\nThe staff is sweet, attentive, and friendly. Feel free to chat it up with the sushi chefs as they're super nice. \n\nReservations are recommended as Wako only has 10 seats at the sushi bar, five 2-tops, and one 4-top. Do sit at the sushi bar for all the nigiri making action: http://bit.ly/1ljg5fR.\n\nParking in the area sucks so it's best to come on weeknights. \n\nHaving previously lived in Inner Richmond, Wako is breath of fresh air to the plethora of pseudo Japanese restaurants in the area. *ahem Ichiraku ahem* Just be prepared for the sticker shock for the area. Well, I guess that's what the ramen budget is for. It's gonna be ramen bowls for daaaayyyyssss now... =/", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The interior's tight with high ceilings.  The first impression was that it was new and intimate.  As I sat down, I immediately noticed how cold it felt inside: cold enough that I had to keep my jacket on whilst eating.  The 2nd thing I noticed was the loud sound acoustics inside.  It's not too loud that you cannot have a conversation but the sounds bounce around enough so that the surrounding conversations are distracting.\n\nTo make matters worst, the music which was loud instrumental drum beat music that I'd never heard of which kind of distracted the vibe of a place that's supposed to be an authentic Japanese restaurant.  I would've expected more peaceful sounds or softer, less invasive music.\n\nEven with all those distractions, the quality of what was served seemed pretty decent.\n\nFor around $80, you can order a 7 course meal that comes with an appetizer, a sashimi dish, 8 pieces of sushi, a cooked dish, tempura, and miso soup.\n\nLet's analyze the 7 course meal (which changes monthly):\n\nPlate #1.  Fried fish ball (tasted like a tater tot: 3 stars); Fried calamari (not bad but the squid was stringy: 3.5 stars); Fish mixed with salad (3.5 stars); and white yam cubes and okra (excellent: 5 stars); a sort of Toro Tartar (4.5 stars)\n\nPlate #2.  Four pieces of two types of sashimi: a smoked yellow tail (4.5 stars) and red snapper (4 stars)\n\nPlate #3:  Cooked yellow tail with veggies and a sweet sauce (similar to teriyaki): 3.5 stars, the cooked meat seemed a little fishy.\n\nPlate #4: 5 pieces of tempura: 2 were scallop cakes wrapped in shiso leaf (5 stars); green bean (4.5 stars) and bamboo shoot (4 stars) with an orange bell pepper\n\nPlate #5:  sushi platter #1: ika sushi (5 stars); spanish mackeral (5 stars); red snapper (4 stars) and amberjack (4 stars); then sushi platter #2: toro (5 stars); salmon roe (5 stars); hotate (scallop) (4.5 stars); smoked wild salmon (4.5 stars);\n\nPlate 6: I had the red miso soup (5 stars).\n\nPlate 7: Dessert, a green tea sort of pudding with a black berry (4.5 stars).\n\nAll in all, for a 7 course meal, you get a lot of items.  Although I'd probably come here again, I cannot say I was \"wow'ed\" but did enjoy certain things a lot.\n\nThe service was good.  The atmosphere could be improved because of the temperature inside.  It was too cool at times and then at others too warm.  The circulation needs to be improved so that eating and socializing is the only focus while dining here.\n\nThe background music needs to be improved too.  The drum beat and noise of the music went right to my stomach.\n\nWill give this place a try again but had higher expectations.  Still decent quality..", "author": "Tony U."}

Over the summer I was in Tokyo and basically wanted to continue my high of quality sushi. When the date finally came to have dinner here I was more than excited. Stepped into a beautiful, cozy restaurant wrapped in wood. The decor in the place was completely inviting and intimate. The place can only sit about 30 people (you must make reservations and they book up pretty fast..). I really wanted to sit at the bar but it was completely booked even with calling 2 weeks in advance. \n\nWe decided on the 7 course omakase which was comprised of  3 small bites, 1 piece of grilled fish, 7 piece nigiri, 3 small pieces of tempura, miso soup and dessert. \n\nCompletely FRESH AND SIMPLE. Nothing too intricate or bold just simply delicious quality flavors that stayed true to their ingredients. I have to say the sushi nigiri pieces are VERY SMALL; even to Japanese standards. They were probably the smallest pieces of sushi I have ever had.. Even after the 7 courses we were still hungry so we ordered the kaisen chawanmushi - a small hot pot of jidori egg curd, snow crab and uni... AGAIN absolutely delicious but soooo small!! I was still soooo hungry. After dinner  I wanted to run to Genki for a crepe! \n\nBottom line this place is OK.

We requested seats at the bar (by phone only) and the chef was very friendly and explained things just the right amount.  Definitely get sushi bar seats!\n\nWe were debating between the 7 course and 12 piece nigiri omakase. I went in thinking I only wanted sushi, but I'm glad we did the 7 course because their cooked foods blew other places out of the water.  The 12 piece nigiri option gives you some more luxurious items like anago, marinated maguro, wagyu, and uni.\n\nTheir sake prices are actually pretty reasonable and come in glasses, 250 ml, or 750 ml options. The pairing is $60/person, but we went for two 250 ml bottles, instead, which worked out well.\n\nTo start: small plates (I love the presentation of very carefully selected dishes).\n- Blue fin tuna tartare with caviar: super smooth, good flavor\n- BBQ eel with celery cucumber, tomato, mango: perfect for summer. The bbq eel had an a really good char on it\n- Deep fried river fish and giant clam with edamame: the giant clam was really good, but the river fish was basically fish skin, which I didn't love as much\n- Shigoku oyster with yuzu pineapple sauce: the sauce on top was really good and unique\n\nSashimi: you're first presented with a little dish with gold flakes and their house blend soy sauce, which is probably one of the best flavored soy sauces I've ever had.  The sashimi is on ice with seaweed, shredded daikon, edible flowers, a lemon, wasabi, and most importantly the fish.  We got 2 pieces of blue fin tuna (so fresh and so good) and 2 pieces of kampachi (I liked the yuzu on it).\n\nSeasonal warm dish: Grilled swordfish in the center (super tender) and this almost gravy like mushroom truffle butter sauce that was very rich without being super heavy. It was a beautiful dish with different colors and textures - shimeji mushrooms, enoji mushrooms, okra, shiso leaf, edible flowers. This was a very impressive dish that I did not expect to come from a sushi place.\n\nSeasonal tempura: I thought - how good could tempura be? Their batter (not panko) and selection of things they fried were really unique, and the green tea sea salt for dipping was awesome.  We had pike eel, brussels sprouts, a fig, and a cluster of corn kernels.  Probably some of the best tempura I've had (including in Japan).\n\nNigiri: (* = favorites)\n1. *Kelp marinated halibut with shiso: the kelp marinade added so much flavor\n2. Shiro ika: white squid - tender, but the texture is not my thing\n3. Giant clam (from Washington) with rock salt and lemon: this is a hard one to come by  \n4. Wild king salmon with yuzu and shiso: super smooth salmon\n5. Aji with chives\n6. *Ikura: house cured, wrapped in special seaweed from Kyushu - loved this\n7. *Bonito: cherry smoked (with almost a bbq sauce flavor) with a garlic chip that's interesting for texture and flavor. I usually prefer my bonito a bit torched, but this was very interested\n8. Chu toro: super smooth, melts in your mouth\n\nAdd ons: a la carte prices on the bill didn't perfectly match with the menu, but it all more or less evened out\n- *Blue fin tuna in jalapeno soy marinade - slightly torched, great flavor\n- Kohada (gizzard shad)\n- Kampachi\n- *Tamago: like dessert for me; I love this \n- We also got extras of the bonito and ikura\n\nWe finished with red or white miso soup (they gave us one of each). The red one was interesting and was very rich in flavor.\n\nDessert: they gave us one of each.  They did an impressive job with desserts since it's usually not the focus at a sushi restaurant.\n- Coconut mango mousse cake with raspberry: a great fruit dessert\n- Green tea and white sesame mousse cake: I love green tea and sesame, and I would have definitely paid for another one of this.  The cake was very light, and it had lots of beautiful layers.\n\nThe chef told us that they actually change the menu every month, which is a lot of work, but it definitely makes me want to go back more often!", "author": "Marilyn T."}

Came here for my cousin's 23rd birthday. I hadn't even heard of this place until she mentioned it. We made reservations for the sushi bar (you have to call for this) at 8:30 on a Thursday and arrived to a packed restaurant. The dinner is long and we were the last ones to leave but never felt pressured to. \n\nYou can only do the omakase at the sushi bar and we both opted for the $100 option. I also got a bottle of nigori and my cousin got some sochu on ice. We started with some cute tiny appetizers that took me back to Nishiki Market. Then came 12 pieces if nigiri you eat with your fingers. They give you this cute little finger wipe and a big serving of ginger to cleanse your palate between each piece. My favorite was the gold foiled toro that melted in my mouth. Gold foiled seafood is apparently a specialty of the city of Kanazawa, just south of the Noto Peninsula. Fun fact! You also get to pick between yellow or red miso so we got one of each and tried each others. I'm glad my cousin got the red one because I didn't like it and she loved it. Dinner ended with a piece of tamago (meh) and your choice between two desserts. I got the pan cotta and my cousin got the chestnut cake. Oh and you also have the option to order additional nigiri's after. \n\nI loved the sushi chefs and they were very nice. They spoke to my cousin about her time in Japan and recommended other sushi restaurants to try. I can't imagine having as good as an experience if we just sat in the regular table and ordered a la carte. I also added up the pieces of nigiri and it came out to be $98 so the $100 omakase is a pretty good deal considering. \n\nThis has no bearing on my rating but service could have been more attentive from the waitresses. Its a small restaurant and I had to ask for my water to be refilled multiple times. The overhead lights here were also way too bright.

The focus here is on exactly that. \n\nSo if you are used to eating yada yada whatever rolls dripping in mayonnaise, thousand island dressing, and Sri Racha sauce, deep fried and covered with onions and other ingredients to mask the old, inferior, and chopped up bits of run-of-the-mill fish, don't come here. In fact stay away. Instead, check out your local Gaijin (\"foreigner\") owned/staffed Japanese-in-name-only Korean/Chinese restaurant for your oyster shooters and Gaijin Rolls.   \n\nWako is a smallish restaurant on the busy Clement street restaurant corridor in the Richmond district of SF. It is pretty new, opening in 2014. The owner/Head Sushi Chef is Japanese. In fact, most, if not all the front end staff, is Japanese. The seating is limited, and is focused on the Sushi bar. There are other small dishes, but mostly it is all about the sushi, not hot pot, sukiyaki, izakaya, ramen, kushiaki or any other Japanese food genre. \n\nWe came here to try Omakase (Chef's choice) Nigiri (single sliced fish on a sushi rice ball).  We sat in front of Nakayama Tomo-san, the head sushi chef/owner. He was born in Shikouku, and got his Sushi experience in Kansai (western Japan) in Sakai-Shi (where the famous 16th century farmer-turned-Shogun, Hideyoshi came from, near KIX int'l airport). Here in the Bay Area, he worked at Sanraku before opening Wako. \n\nWe were served a steady supply of various Nigiri, 14 to 20, I lost count. They were smaller in size than a traditional Japanese Nigiri from Jiro, but this has become popular in the US by people like Nobu in L.A. and other higher end sushi makers, to allow for greater variety for the diner, and perhaps a little more profit for the restaurant. \n\nWe ate all of these Nigiri in a more traditional way, without wasabi mixed in small plate with soy sauce. Rather, we ate them exactly how Tomo-san served them, with a dab of wasabi under the fish, as is custom. He cut all of our fish and served us individually. \n\nWe had a nice small 250 or 300 ml cold sake, (about $38), but I forgot which one. They have several to choose from. \n\nYou should expect to pay about $100 per head for this type and quality of sushi, which is typical for real Japanese sushi establishments with good fish and rice.\n\nI really enjoyed this restaurant and would like to return soon.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

But I have to.  Everything was the just perfect.  First the food.  We ordered the nigiri omakase which our friends recommended over the other one.  It was a work of culinary art and precision. My mouth was in heaven.  I asked my friend where the soy sauce was and he told me the wasabi, soy sauce and all the other flavors are already combined in the sushi piece so all I had to do was pick it up and eat it.  He was right.  Each sushi piece was an adventure with distinct taste.  I love each one.  I especially love\n- starter course of monkfish liver, salad with Apple, even the fish cakes with lotus roots. \n - the scallop which was lightly seared. It is a perfect balance to its natural sweetness\n- the fresh water eel was the most moist eel I have ever had.  \n- the Hokkaido uni was amazing in taste and texture. We ordered another round after the omakase. \n- the ink squid had a great crunch texture.  Never like squid before but loved it here. \n- snapper, halibut, toro, yellowtail all had its unique flavor.  We savored it all\n- the wagyu beef nigiri was even tasty. \n\nWe also ordered the following extras\n- monkfish liver Loved it. \n- steamed egg dish- I forget the Japanese name.  This was divine with uni, fish and mushroom. \n- fried clams.  Yummy\n- grilled glazed cod.  Tender and tasty\n\nWe finished with red and white miso soup. I loved the white one.  Hubby loved the red. Then finished with two desserts mix - I liked the lighter fruity one.  \n\nWe drank sake and hot tea throughout.  The sake I would recommend are the one that is gently fruity and the otter festival. \n\nLastly I loved the setting, it is bright but not too bright, very homey and comfortable.

However after watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi on Netflix my boyfriend had dreams of one day Sukiyabashi Jiro. Since that's not happening anytime soon we ended up looking for Michelin star omakase spots. After discovering omakase, I can say that my thoughts about raw fish have most definitely changed and now we've spent the last few special occasions finding different omakase spots. We went here for my boyfriend's birthday and it's definitely our favorite spot of all the places we've been to.\n\nTo start things off I placed a reservation a few weeks in advance. If you want to sit at the sushi bar they recommend you make an opentable reservation (to secure a reservation at the restaurant) but you must also call in to request the sushi bar. Luckily it was available for my reservation! Wako is on a cute little street near a residential area. Parking wasn't too bad on a Wednesday night. Our reservation was at 8pm and when we arrived we were greeted by a small restaurant nicely decorated with wood panels. The restaurant fits a very small amount of people but it creates an intimate feel.\n\nIf you sit at the sushi bar you are required to order their omakase. We went with the 12pc nigiri option which was a good choice since we still got a couple of hot dishes but the main focus was on the fresh fish. Some of the standouts include toro with caviar and gold flakes and tempura fig. The sushi chefs were very knowledgeable about the fish and would describe where each piece came from. Our items came from Japan, Turkey, and even locally from Santa Cruz! When presented with the wagyu beef towards the end of the meal we got to see the certificate of where it came from including the little cow's nose print, his name, and his parent's names (they showed me this after I ate it, thank goodness!).\n\nOverall this was a great experience and well worth the price. It's less pretentious than some other omakase spots and the intimate yet casual feel allows you to really enjoy the experience. We've also been to Kusakabe and Sushi Yoshizumi. I would say Wako and Kuskabe are our favorites (Wako slightly more because we like the atmosphere more) and Sushi Yoshizumi was my least favorite.", "author": "Sarah C."}

Sooo good.\n\nThe one we both really didn't like though-the clam. Could do without this one.\n\nWe ordered all four desserts for the night- black sesame mochi, matcha mochi, matcha mousse, and coconut mousse with banana. My favorite was the matcha mochi! Best mochi I've had outside of Japan. The black sesame mochi surprisingly had a whipped cream like center. \n\nOverall, a cute little Inner Richmond place that doesn't even make you feel like you're on Clement!

Buuuuut all hype was false unfortunately. \n\nFor food, we ordered the 10 piece nigiri omakase and the kaisen chawanmushi to share. Food is mediocre at best. Average. Nothing stood out to my friend and I. Maybe just the seared scallop nigiri, but that's out of 10 pieces of nigiri and a small plate. \n\nAs for service, we never got a refill on our tea. However, I noticed that the table next to us got an entire pot of tea while we just had a small cup. No one ever stopped by to ask us if we wanted a refill. Also, once the place got busy, we barely even saw our waitress unless they were giving us our food. Even then our food came out pretty fast.\n\nOverall, our experience here was definitely lower than what we had expected. The quality of food is so-so and just average. We were hoping that Wako would prove us wrong, but instead, they proved us right that their food indeed is just average. I'm not saying Wako is bad, but there are definitely other sushi restaurants that serve better fish than here for the amount we paid here. \n\nAlso, just to give you a glimpse of how much we spent, our total bill came out to be about $153 without tip -  $85 per person plus tip.

Whenever someone raves about a sushi place in SF, they start with \"my favorite roll...\" & I stop listening.  Being a purist, sushi is nigiri or maki not California rolls (not authentic) with a combination of random stuff on it.  \n\nWe ordered items from both the sushi bar & the kitchen.  The cooked food from the kitchen rate 1-2 stars.  The sushi 3.5 stars.  Overall it was an overpriced dinner.\n\nKama - the waitress couldn't tell me if it would be Hamachi, basically any type of fish  kama (collar) is served at the same price.  Supposedly it was Hamachi kama that we got.  I've never seen a kama chopped into the 3 small pieces we were served,  It was overcooked, over salted & dry.  1 star.\n\nButterfish - meh, nothing memorable & def not misoyaki butterfish.  A little piece but at least it wasn't dry.  2 stars.\n\nTamago - was waaay too sweet!  Definitely wasn't trained on how to prepare it like at Jiro's.  1 star.\n\nThe hamachi yuzu miso  - yellowtail, yuzu, lily bulb, miso, celery, carrots $6 was the only great item we ate from the kitchen.\n\nSake maki, negi-hama maki, hamachi, hotate & saba nigiri were great.  Fresh fish but not great cuts.  Sushi rice was good & served at proper (room) temp.   They don't place soy sauce on the table & take it upon themselves to drizzle it on for you.  That annoys me - like a sushi Nazi who assumes all the customers are too stupid to know how to eat sushi.  I know how to eat sushi & don't drench it in soy sauce, in fact sometimes I'd rather not use soy sauce at all.  3.5 stars.\n\nService was good - dishes cleared promptly, water kept filled (despite the drought) & they checked on us regularly but not intrusive.  \n\nTables are close together so if there are loud people seated next to you it can be annoying - we know 1st hand.\n\nTIP:  If you decide to try Wako, book a reservation.  This small place doesn't mark the tables as reserved but most are.  There were many walk-ins who were turned away while we were there.", "author": "Kim S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-06", "description": "It's often difficult to write a review that differs from the majority. A lot of people have given Wako 5 full stars, but after dining there, I found that I couldn't justify a rating above 3 stars. I've been eating sushi since I was 6 years old and have experienced omakase meals in some of the some of the best Japanese restaurants around the world (Tokyo, New York, San Francisco, London, etc.) San Francisco has recently seen an explosion of high-end Japanese restaurants many of which only offer set menus ranging from $95 - $250 per person. When I saw that Wako's reviews were highly positive and their prices were less ($85 for base omakase), I anticipated a meal that was expertly prepared and good value. Unfortunately, very few of the dishes we received hit the mark. \n\nIncluded, please find an overview of our 7 courses. Although, please note that they skipped one of the courses (tempura) that is supposed to be included according to the menu, and we didn't realize it until afterward.\n\n1. Starters: Toro Tartar, Okre with Daikon, & Fig Tempura. The fig was the standout but there was nothing special about the remaining appetizers (and the okre diakon could have been skipped entirely).\n\n2. Sashimi: Incredibly poorly chosen items with terrible presentation (an unappetizing and tasteless piece of eel with small bones, an OK piece of clam, and 2 pieces of blue fin tuna). The quality of the fish was OK, but this certainly isn't the right combination to get a person's palate prepared properly and the whole dish looked like it had been thrown together.\n\n3. Warm Dish: Whole cooked fish with a green vegetable sauce and a fried fish bone on top. This was the prettiest looking dish (photo attached), but after a few bites it was incredibly boring. The flavors just weren't present.\n\n4. Tempura: We never received our tempura dish at all! There was nothing even mentioned, and since they took away our menus, I did not realize this until writing this review.\n\n5. Nigiri: This is where the restaurant shines, and perhaps if I had only been eating Nigiri, I would have also praised this restaurant. I thought the selection could have been a little more intriguing, but the rice was great and the fish was fresh and expertly cut. Honestly, if we had only had this dish, I would have be able to provide at least a 4 start rating.\n\n6. Miso Soup: We opted for the more pungent red miso. The dashi and flavor was excellent. My only complain was there was very little in the soup (only a couple tiny pieces of tofu and a small flake of fish). The broth was excellent but the distribution of the soup could use greater attention.\n\n7. Desert: The deserts were nice. One featured Matcha and the other was sweeter. They were a pleasant way to end the meal.\n\nAll in all, we were disappointed with our meal, and in retrospect are surprised we missed an entire course. The way they served the nigiri (in 2 parts) made it seem like we were receiving all 7 courses, but in retrospect after re-reading the menu, I definitely recall the Tempura course being listed on the menu and missing from our meal. I think for this price point, there needs to be a little more focus on the presentation and the quality of the non-nigiri dishes.", "author": "Justin G."}

The omakase is probably one of the best I've had. There are only two omakase choices on the menu for $90 or $130 (although when I went before it was only $70 for the lowest option, I guess thats what a michelin star does). I always opt for the bar seating right in front of the sushi chef because I wanna see everything made and you eat the food right after it is made. You can even watch the chef grate wasabi right in front of you (for those who don't know, wasabi at most sushi restaurants is dyed horseradish and never real). The service is friendly and servers are attentive. The fish there is extremely tasty and fresh. You may not get the same thing every time you go there because it depends on what is in season and what they can get in the markets. \n\nThe Richmond district is not known for fancy food, because of that, this place is still not as popular because it is a ways off from the hub in downtown.

Although $82 for a seven course omakase may seem pricy, it's a pretty good deal compared to many other omakase in town (*cough sushi hashiri cough*).\nThe food won't necessarily blow you away, but there's something nice about simple dishes that are fresh, well made and balanced.\nAll the fish in the sushi courses were so bright and fresh, and at the perfect size and temperature. The pieces are all pre-seasoned so no soy-sauce dipping needed! Just trust the chef!\nProbably the weakest course for me was the desert - you get a little cake type thing in a cup - but hey, who goes to a sushi restaurant for the deserts!\nBest of all is the atmosphere of the restaurant. The place is tiny, and only seats about 20 or so people, so it feels super intimate and cozy. The service was on point; attentive but not overbearing.

They can at most seat 4 to a table, so be aware of this.\n\nThe chef is very talented, I think and does a great omakase. Not only that but it is worth every penny! It's such a cheap omakase for the kind of food that you get served, and the sushi and nigiri are all expertly cut, freshly sourced and delicious.

I didn't quite understand that until I had the fatty tuna at Wako. It literally melted in my mouth because of how fatty that tuna was. And it was delicious!!\n\nI came here on a Wednesday night around 8:00pm and although this place is pretty tiny (like a max 25 people capacity), we were seated right away. I couldn't decide on the multitude of different nigiri pieces so I opted for the chirashi bowl, which is under omakase. I'm usually not an uni eater because all the uni I've ever had was way too fishy, but the uni that came with my chirashi bowl was SWEET. Apparently fresh uni is sweet and refreshing! I savored that silky piece of deliciousness and made a mental note to order more on my next visit. \n\nAll of the fish that came in my bowl was super super fresh! The food was so delicious that I even ordered dessert and got the sesame daifuku and a matcha daifuku. Although on the pricy side ($5 for a mochi about the size of a golf ball), they were both  chewy on the outside and creamy on the inside, none of that frozen stuff you might get at a meh sushi restaurant. \n\nParking was a bit difficult even at 8pm on a Wednesday, but that's typical of Clement Street.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-10-22", "description": "Dining at Wako Sushi is an experience in itself and was probably the closest I could get to the Jiro's and Sushi Dai's of Japan. The owner and sushi chef puts so much care into everything he does, and will go into great lengths to tell you about where each ingredient comes from. I went with the seven-course omakase, which was really the best way to get a good sampling of the menu and their fish specials.\n\nThe meal starts off with a small plate that comes with three components. The plate was probably one of the most beautifully composed plates I've seen, built around the theme of autumn. First is a housemade sesame tofu with a tiny dot of wasabi on top, and the texture was a lot creamier than most tofu. Next was a roasted eggplant slice made to look like a tree stump that was covered with a delicious sauce. Finally, a piece of kombucha squash was carved into the shape of a leaf and roasted just right. All of the flavors were simple and clean, but it was the perfect way to pique my appetite.\n\nThe next course was sashimi, which was served with a bit of lemon zest that really complemented the fish. The best piece was the king salmon, generously sliced and extremely fresh. To round out the appetizers, the tempura plate was the most substantial and further showed the creativity of the chefs. The matsutake mushroom and shishito pepper tempura were relatively standard, but the mackerel was first encrusted with rice cracker and then fried in tempura batter. It gave the tender fish an amazing crunch on the outside, adding both flavor and texture. \n\nThe main grilled course was served in between the nigiri servings, and the day's special was a potato-crusted salmon with seasonal vegetables. The salmon was essentially marinated in a potato puree that really softened the fish, and then it was topped with chestnut, green bean, and carrot. The dish was somehow a complete dish all combined into one piece. \n\nThe seven pieces of nigiri is really the most unique part of the omakase, with each piece served one at a time, with wasabi and soy sauce already carefully painted onto the nigiri in order to avoid any customer drowning their fish in soy sauce and wasting the flavor. The best piece was the toro, or the fatty tuna belly. It's the most buttery piece of fish, and I loved the rice to fish ratio. They're definitely not trying to fill you up on carbs, leaving you plenty of room to really enjoy the fish. Wako has also brought upon my appreciation for uni. I've never really had good uni before this meal, and the uni nigiri with the shiso leaf tucked in between the rice was perfect. The brine-y flavor wasn't overwhelming, but I still got a great flavor of the ocean. Another highlight was the crab nigiri, which was so tender. It was a simple bite, but the perfect way to highlight the crab. \n\nThe meal is finished off with a housemade strawberry mousse, maintaining that light quality that connected the entire omakase. The fresh strawberry chunks made it refreshing, and the mousse itself wasn't at all heavy or creamy. They also serve a complimentary piece of chocolate that they also make themselves, finishing off with a bit of decadence that you didn't realize you wanted after an amazing meal. \n\nWako Sushi is without a doubt one of my favorite Japanese spots in San Francisco, and I highly recommend it to anyone, sushi lover or not!", "author": "Ashley T."}

Before our official course meal started, we ordered a SEASONAL mushroom soup -- this mushroom grows in Japan (also seattle and canada apparently) only under pine trees and because they grow and are at optimal in taste during this time, Wako only offers this soup in Oct/Nov months. \n\nTheir smaller Omakaze menu doesn't change, but they will change up their menu close to quarterly basis for their bigger Omakaze.\n\nCourses:\n\n#1: Tofu and salad\n- Tofu was super soft (possibly home-made) but a bit bland and wasn't too special for me.\n\n#2: Miso glazed sea bass\n- Pretty good but it's not unique to Wako and there isn't anything phenomenally outstanding\n\n#3: 7 Nigiri\n- Beautifully made and very tasty!

So, maybe we should go somewhere nice for dinner.  Mr. J was laughing at me and said no good place would have an open reservation on a Friday night.  Well, I decided it doesn't hurt to try and gave Wako a call to see if their sushi bar is available at 9 pm.  I won't lie, but I was surprised when the lady over the phone told me that they are available.  And there, Mr. J and I rushed out the door.  On the drive over there, we kept thinking if we made the right decision and will we be disappointed at the end of the night.\n\nWhen we walked into Wako, I immediately fell in love with its cozy and inviting environment.  After identifying ourselves, the server sat us down at the best seats in the house with the reserved sign.  There are 10 seats at the bar and we got the perfect front view of Tomo-san and Atsushi-san!  Wako offers four or seven course omakase option and Mr. J and I went for the seven course one and added a few a la carte items as well.  I won't go into too much detail of our dishes as I believe a picture is worth a thousand words.  But, there are a few things worth mentioning.\n\n*** Rice - Mr. J and I are very particular and picky when it comes to the sushi rice.  We both agreed that the sushi rice at Wako is probably the best we've had in the bay area.\n\n*** Size - Some might find their nigiri to be on the smaller side.  But, I find them to be the perfect size to be eaten with hands in one bite.\n\n*** Rhythm - Tomo-san always asks if he may start preparing the next sushi.  And, every nigiri is prepared right before served.  I really hate to compare Wako to Maruya since Mr. J and I like them both.  But, we've seen fishes been sliced together beforehand at Maruya the last time we were there at the sushi bar.\n\n*** Tamago - Not your typical tamago at the sushi restaurant here.  The type they served is Kasutera, the kind that look and taste like the Japanese Castella cake.  And, it's Mr. J's favorite!  Tomo-san asked if we had this kind of tamago before and wanted our opinion.  After I took a bite and he saw my big smile, he said no words are needed as he can see it in my smile.\n\n*** Dessert - I cannot express enough the importance of a dessert at the end of every meal.  I don't care how good of a meal I had if their dessert is weak.  A great dessert = a perfecting ending to a meal.  Mmmm, I am still drooling over their house made matcha daifuku!\n\nTomo-san and Atsushi-san are both funny and interactive.  They totally made our night a happy one!  Mr. J and I were the last two to leave with two very full and happy tummies!  We'll be back soon!!", "author": "Kay Y."}

If one calls Roku Japanese fusion toward the western end of the spectrum, I would call this Californian Japanese toward the Japanese end of the spectrum.\n\nEverything was done with taste, fabulous presentation, great balance of flavor, and ingenuity.\n\nIf you are here with someone, I would suggest to share a 4-course omakase. The nigiris are amazing - seasoned for you already and top quality for fish, rice, and presentation. I even like it better than the ones in Japan since the chef seasons it perfectly to save us Americans from putting too much soy sauce on them. \n\nIf you want to miso soup, I would recommend the misoshiru (traditional miso soup) rather than akadashi (red miso). The second one is a bit more salty and the traditional one has more subtle flavors. \n\nSkip the rolls - a bit too soft for my taste and the pickles are quite strong. \n\nThe starters for omakase were a great way to ease one into the more elaborate nigiris. The sesame tofu surprised me a bit with a nutty overtone and subtle sweetness. Probably one of the best uncooked version of tofu I have ever tasted. The vegetable dish was delicate and light. \n\nThe peach Panna cotta was fabulous. Not too sweet and not too acidic. Beautifully presented. Just the right creamy/airy balance with quite a bit of depth in the flavor. \n\nThe black cod and the tempura were solid.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

Please do make sure that you call during their reservation acceptance hrs. On Saturday, I had to call in to make a last minute change to add 2 more people to the party. Again, they made it happen and we sat at the sushi bar. \n\nOur pleasure and first time was given to Tomo-san who serves around the corner are of the sushi bar. Tomo-san started joking with us when he found out that one person was late. He said, \"Is the person here? Looking for parking?\" I said, \"yes\". He said, \"oh no... Good luck!\" hahaha! The friend ended up spending 15 mins looking for parking. They didn't rush us to order since our timeframe was blocked off specifically for us to enjoy the dinner. \n\nOur party for 4 did the 7 course omakase for $68/head. \nSeven Course 68 small plates (3), sashimi (4pcs.) bincho-grill (1), tempura (3), nigiri (7pcs.), miso soup, dessert.\n\nThe four piece sashimi included King Salmon and Hamachi. Honestly, nothing special for this plate.. King salmon wasn't buttery or creamy enough. Just wasn't a big wow factor for this. \n\nI'm going to skip the grill stuff and the tempura stuff. \n\nRight down to the nigiri, because this is what I like about the place. Best fish of the day is what's this is all about. No soy sauce beyond this point. Everything was lightly prepped without heavy taste. This is where you find out if the fish is fresh or not. My favorite of the nigiri was the Snow Crab. Very close to what I had in Hokkaido Japan. Then there was scallop which was lightly seared. Very juicy and almost melted in my mouth (like tofu, but it has a nice caramel scallop taste). Then it was the toro... and finishing the authentic Hokkaido Uni. You can actually see that the box had hokkaido sticker on it. Very sweet! \n\nWe also had a drink with Tomo-san.. Be sure to order up the Banana Beer that they have. Nothing better than drinking up with the sushi chef and talking about food. Tomo said he loved izakaya's in San Mateo area.   \n\n~Note~\n\nWe requested one of the omakase to have more seared and more cooked items since our friend wasn't a big raw fish eater. Tomo-san was nice and served up some specials for her. He made sure that each item was okay and that she liked what was served. \n\nWish the server were more prompted on refilling tea. We had to ask for a pot since we kept asking for refills. \n\nIf I were to do it again, I would do 4 course meal, use the $25 difference and order some different stuff on the menu. You might get more bang for the buck if your a nigiri person. \n\nOh, don't miss out on the housemade dessert and the chocolate.", "author": "Eric Y."}

The sushi is pricy and I don't mind paying for it as long as the service is also great. \n\nThe customer service deserves a C. \n\nWent here for dinner with my brother tonight for a 11 course omakase tasting. The staff was very nice but when the restaurant started getting busy, the manager name June put the check on our table before us even getting our dessert. The part that was a turnoff is how they brought the check before us even getting our dessert. Which made us feel like we were being rushed versus giving us the opportunity to enjoy the whole dining experience. Especially considering how much money we were spending on dinner.\nWhen we ignored them putting the check on our table, the manager June came to our table and said there was a 2 hour time limit to eat at the restaurant. So we needed to hurry up and finish our dessert. When I asked June where does it say that there was a 2 hour time limit. She responded that it was posted on the website. Later in the evening I went on the restaurants website and there was nothing posted to say there is a 2 hour time limit. So not only June was extremely rude she also lied. June is not a good quality manager who knows how to create lasting relationships with customers to make them want to come back. June belongs in the back washing dishes because she lacks people skills.", "author": "J C."}

For six tortuous months, I have watched my friends, strangers, television hosts eat, discuss, and enjoy sushi. Now, I cannot even remember why I gave up sushi, but I am so glad that Wako was my introduction back into the wonderful world of sushi.\n\nFor my return, I decided that reservations for the sushi bar and the seven course omakase were the way to go. Reservations were easy to get for an early weekday dinner but parking was a headache. If you cannot find parking on Clement, save your gas and drive one block down to Geary.\n\nThe chefs and waitresses at Wako are very attentive and friendly when the restaurant is slower, so I am glad that my experienced ended before the dinner rush. For my appetite the 7-course omakase was not enough and I needed to interrupt with 8 more pieces of nigiri before finishing off with dessert. I enjoyed the small plates, bincho-grill, and tempura, which were perfectly cooked or fried. The nigri was beautifully present and tasty to boot but the cuts were smaller than I expected. At least the chefs downsized the rice to create the right ratio. Wako is a great for a sushi date night, and reminiscent of Koo, but be prepared for the bill. Eating here is an expensive experience. \n\nWhat I recommend:\n- omakase (changes every month according to the chefs)\n- anago\n- tamago (bready and sweet)", "author": "Andrew W."}

Heck, same day if you can swing it. I can feel the difference.\n\nOne piece of sushi I ate and then forgot immediately that I'd eaten it--no impression. It's not the point of sushi. At Kabuto, and Yume, the flavors are divine and they grab me. I could be totally distracted but I taste that fish and oh my god, there it is. At Wako there was a \"je ne sais quois\" missing. It didn't have the X factor. Don't get me wrong--it's not that Wako is bad; it's better than most of what's out there. I won't eat Sushi at 90% of the Japanese places in this town.

The food and service at this cozy and sweet place is absolutely delightful. I've been here at least 4 times since they opened and this place is so impeccably consistent. The servers and sushi chefs, Atsushi-san and Tomo-san are always so polite and friendly. I've sat at the sushi bar a few times and ordered the omakase as well as at a table ordering a la carte. The kitchen dishes are very tasty and the sushi is so so so fresh every time. I personally enjoy the element of surprise of the omakase more and add more sushi if I am still hungry (because I eat a lot). I always make sure to end dinner with the uni. I'm drooling as we speak.

The sushi here, for someone who lived in Tokyo for 4 years, then lived in NYC for 8 years (and bemoaned how there were only two Tokyo-grade sushi joints in all of NYC), was inoffensive.  \n\nRice was properly flavored, though extremely delicately so.  What does it mean when flavor is so subtle it's almost indiscernible?\n\nFish was fine, though ultimately uninspiring.  Bland.  When fish is good, it tastes like life.  This was just okay.\n\nReally, inoffensive is the word that comes to mind.  Where is the rich, nuanced flavor of good rice, balanced with sweetness and sourness and a rich oily piece of live aji on top?  \n\nActually, the kohada was pretty decent.  Thinking about the good pieces, you might be able to make a passable meal if you could just select the few items that are actually pretty good.

The food and the level of detail/attention the sushi chefs have dedicated to their craft hands down is worthwhile.

I would've hoped for an inquiry of whether there were any dietary restrictions or allergies.  It would've been wonderful if when a member of the group got up to using the restroom he/she would return to it nicely folded. It would've been amazing if the empty bottles and glasses were collected as opposed to us having to place it on the side to make room. It would've been great if as our ginger was nearing depletion it would've been refilled. It would've been great if after we finished the main entrees of the Omakasee we would've been asked if there were any additional items we would like to order instead of rudely being forced to pay because they needed to prep for the seating of the next dining group.

The night that we were there, about 90% of the patrons were Japanese.  If I had closed my eyes, I sort of could imagine that I was back in Japan again. \n\nLet's get down to the food.  We ordered the 7 course omakase, holy moly, it was a ton of food!  Wako's strong suite is definitely their cooked dishes.  The grilled fish, uni chawanmushi, ankimo, and tofu.  All were great, well except the ankimo was a bit overdone but the flavor was spot on.  Sushi was good, the technique's there but the quality was just OK.  He didn't have higher quality cuts of fish, and when asked about copper river salmon (it was in season), the chef said that it was an expensive fish.  It is an expensive fish, but other restaurants like Koo manages to serve it.  All of the sushi we had were prepared and seasoned nicely though, so the mediocre quality of the fish isn't as jarring versus if it was prepared the traditional sushi way.  This isn't to say that they have bad quality fish, their fish are leaps and bounds above places like elephant sushi and anami.  I would place it the same quality standard as Roka, which I am a fan of also.   Also in the beginning the sushi rice was really fresh, so it was a bit warm, which heightened the vinegar flavor.  The texture was great though, and after the first few pieces the taste improved dramatically as the rice cooled.  \n\nThe dessert was amazing!  I'm usually not a dessert girl but I could eat a whole bowl of the panna cotta that they served at the end.  I also want to go back to try their matcha mochi, it looked amazing!\n\nWe will definitely be back, order a bunch of hot plates and order a bit of sushi if in the mood.  I'm so happy to have a true authentic Japanese restaurant in the city and be able to do this, usually we're stuck with the options of only sushi or only hot plates.   If Wako improves their sushi, it might be my favorite Japanese restaurant in the city :)", "author": "Christina L."}

I wanted to sit at the bar, but they only do 6pm, 630, and 8pm. I wanted 7pm so we had to sit at a table. You can get 7 course omakase with cooked food for $75 or all nigiri for MP. I got the 7 course and it was so yummy. A little bit of everything. The highlight was the 8 different nigiri you get. No soy sauce needed. Super fresh. Loved it all. The rice was super good. \n\nWe also added a la carte items: ankimo, tomago, tuna roll, steam egg.

The first course consists of a beautifully crafted seasonal vegetable dish, very light, very appetizing.  Almost like an amuse bouche.  Then the grill dish we had was a nicely chared pieced of salmon, with the right amount of fat.  It was almost as buttery and decadent as a piece of black cod.  The 7 pieces of nigiri followed were the highlights of the meal.  The fish super fresh.  The rice chewy and perfectedly cooked.  Each nigiri was nicely seasoned, with a hint of citrus or a pinch of wasabi.  The fish's distinctive flavors were not masked, but elevated.  What ended a wonderful meal was the matcha daifuku, pumped with a creamy filling similar to Beard Papa's famous cream puffs.  Not overly sweet, just the perfect little sweet note to end your meal. \n\nAll for under $50 (excludes tax and tips.)  I think that's a steal.", "author": "Candice B."}

While the food is high quality I feel like the environment and service aren't up to par.\n\nWako is definitely a small restaurant. The center of the restaurant is a sushi bar. Table seating is relegated to about five. Even though the restaurant is very small it is easily a five dynamite stick experience. I've been to party sushi restaurants that are quieter. It's a strange dynamic when you're eating high quality food with the soundscape of a super bowl tailgate.\n\nThe food is broken down into grilled pates, appetizers, small plates, rolls, and nigiri. This isn't a cheap restaurant. Each piece of nigiri goes for $5. But the nigiri does melt in your mouth. The fish has a really high level of luscious fattiness to it. Two of our party, including me, opted for the pre fixe menu. They don't specifically state what you'll receive. It just says the amount of nigiri, small plates, etc. The prix fixe menu is a relatively good value, I think it'd be best to order exactly what you want and adjust as needed. While the food is good overall I feel like it's lacking a bit of that \"oooh\" factor. The one standout dish is the chawanmushi.\n\nService is questionable. Even though there seem to be many servers, the experience felt like an ordeal for both staff and customers. One of the difficulties stems from the number of plates. There are so many plates! For the nigiri they even combine customer's orders on one plate. Then the waiters have to discuss each and every piece to the customer. I feel like the waiters would have a much easier time if the restaurant weren't so cramped. We were never really checked up on, but it was mainly because they were so busy trying to bring us our plates and take away the ones we were finished with.\n____\nHigh caliber Japanese cuisine that you'll most likely forget about thirty minutes after leaving. Chaotic service and atmosphere. Is the food worth the hassle? I'm not sure but it's great on its own.", "author": "Michael H."}

They should rename this place \"Transcendent Sushi.\" I'm not exaggerating. I will remember our dinner at Wako as my first true sushi experience and one of the best meals of my life.

I ate here on Thursday night with my girlfriend; we have been having omakase at all of SF's best sushi restaurants and Tomo and Atsushi are setting a very high standard with Wako. We came here on their 3rd day and the food, service and atmosphere were all exceptional. \n\nAs is our custom, we like to have omakase (chef's choice) to give the chefs the chance to put their best foot forward in their own personal shock and awe campaign. The Omakase began with a few special dishes then sashimi before being served edo-mae style sushi (preseasoned by the chef). All was of the highest quality and creativity. If you are looking for a fantastically authentic sushi experience, Wako is tough to beat in this town. \n\nTomo is from Shikoku (smallest of Japan's four major islands) and was trained in Osaka, which is known for having some of the best cuisine in all of Japan. This training really shines through in the authenticity and quality of the dining experience at Wako. I expect it will soon be very difficult of get a seat at Wako.", "author": "John D."}

The other option included only sushi. Both meals hovered around the same $80/person price point. The reason why the sushi-only Omakase was more expensive was for the Uni and Wagu beef additions, which were more exclusive and higher grade. I personally thought the mixed Omakase was fantastic. I'm a sashimi fan and being able to enjoy both sushi and sashimi made it worth it. As far as highlights, the tuna sashimi was some of the best tuna I've had in my life. The texture, freshness, and taste of the tuna was quite simply exquisite. For sushi highlights, I found both the Toro (fatty tuna), and squid (raw but lightly torched on the top) to be of special significance. The hot appetizer of the day, miso marinated black cod, was also fantastic.", "author": "Nicole W."}

Went for the 7 course and it did not disappoint. \n\nThe highlight is the nigiri which is basically a sampler of a whole bunch of different fish each one extremely impressive on their own, but each of the earlier courses were equally flavorful.\n\nIf you have a large appetite you may have to add something on top of the main meal. We added the grilled squid and the black cod miso which were both amazing. I cant describe the style in which this was prepared but it was absolutely delicious.\n\nPrices are a little on the high side so be prepared to throw down some money but its definitely worth it.

Quite the shame as the neighborhood needed an upscale sushi restaurant to fill the void left by the passing of Sasaki-san (See Murasaki, http://www.yelp.com/biz/murasaki-sushi-bar-san-francisco).\n\nWako is a total racket. The kind of people that dine here and rate it highly fall under one of two categories...either they are too rich to care or they simply don't know any better.\n\nCase in point: Nobu K. For those of you who don't know this man, he is quite the infamous Yelper and an expert on Japanese food in SF. Whatever you may feel about his ranting reviews, he is rarely wrong and has the experience to back up his opinions. Therefore, it was quite the relief to find his Wako experience was identical to mine. Give it a read... http://www.yelp.com/biz/wako-japanese-restaurant-san-francisco?hrid=3eoFpyL1jJqqfXjuD3Kv0g\n\nDetails\n---------------------------------------------\nWe ordered two portions of uni at $10 a pop but what arrived was about a tablespoon of actual food. The smallest portion of uni I have ever seen in my life. Worse, the uni looked chopped up and was slopped upon a bed of daikon. Why would you do that to uni?\n\nWe also ordered the toro, which while of high quality, was also disturbingly small at around 1 1/2 inches long and 1/8 inch thick. Again, the smallest sashimi I have ever seen in my entire life. Shockingly so. Like the uni, the actual preparation of the fish was not so great. My two pieces of toro were totally different jagged shapes and one significantly thicker than the other. No garnishes, no special plating, nothing but a dollop of grated daikon and a single shiso leaf.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of other items and the only stand out was the Wagyu Beef Stew, which was pretty darn good. The Assorted Fish Collars was mediocre at best. Without the dipping sauce the fish was dry and bland.\n\nI was also greatly displeased by the service. Once we informed our server that one of us was a vegetarian, you could tell we were not welcome and the service reflected that going forward. Didn't matter that we had ordered sake for the table and were ordering expensive fishes from the daily specials. When we asked what was available to order, we were shut down immediately. The server made it clear there was nothing he could eat, that even the seemingly veggie dishes contained some form of bonito. She made absolutely no attempts to suggest a course of action. Just to be clear, we weren't expecting too much and were cognizant of the kind of establishment we were in, it was the treatment and service that was a let down. FTR, I believe there are only two veggie items on the entire menu, a cucumber-sesame maki and an umeboshi maki. Everything else has been prepped before service so you won't be able to make edits.\n\nThe real travesty was the pacing. First, all of the non-veggie food arrived first. Meaning, the poor vegetarian sat there for 25 minutes as dish after dish was served to the meat eaters. How long does it take to make a cucumber-sesame maki exactly? Then they mixed serving the raw items with the cooked. That's just not right man! They know they screwed it up as we received one apology near the end when one of the appetizers was served so late, it arrived last, after all the main items.\n\nTL;DR\n---------------------------------------------\nThe prices and portion sizes at Wako are shameful. There are plenty of other restaurants to spend your money at that won't leave you feeling scammed. It was difficult to look down at my plate and realize that I was about to eat $50 worth of fish in a couple of bites. The photos on their website didn't look anything like what we received. It's totally possible that the quality of the fish surpasses other restaurants but who cares if you are receiving bad service and microscopic portions?\n\nIf you really must dine at Wako, just get the omakase. The dishes look more consistent and the small portion size makes sense for a 7-course meal. But honestly, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.", "author": "Sam S."}

I eat alot of sushi, and this tops any sushi restaurant in the bay.\n\nI was a fan of the sushi chef and owner, Tomo, when he worked over at Sanraku in the metreon building.  He is both a fantastic chef and food artist.  When I heard he left to open his own restaurant, I knew it was going to be great.\n\nAt Wako, I was a single diner, so they were able to fit me in at the sushi bar, but reservations are highly recommended as many people were turned away at the door.   It's fun to sit at the sushi bar because you can see these two chefs make their magic.    \n\nTomo would explain each course to me, and the waitresses would also tell me where the fish came from.  It was either locally caught, like the salmon and black cod, or it came from Japan.   They also said that they make the wasabi there, from fresh wasabi root.    Their were two Japanese women sitting next to me, and they were both telling me that this restaurant was very authentic.  I believe them.\n\nI went with the 7 course meal.

My wife loves sushi, and I enjoy Japanese cuisine, so we've got to try the place. I went here recently with my wife for a late Valentine's dinner on a not so perfect day (man, it was raining a lot). I must say overall the food is not bad. We both went for the 9 omasake course. The highlight of them all were the different nigiri sushi pieces. They were all so good, and they included scallop and a variety of different fishes. However, I found them to be small. I guess that's normal for fine-dining = small dishes and high prices. I had to order a couple of extra nigiri because they're pretty yummy. We also had a bowl of sashimi, some eggy soup thingy, sweet mousse desserts, miso soup, and some other items I cannot remember what they're made of. The tuna sashimi was very good. I'd rank it as high as the nigiri. The other dishes were okay. And about the service, it was pretty good, but it depends. I like the person who was serving us. She was super friendly and always look happy. However, another lady there who helped to serve us was kind of stern and seemed a little rude. Anyhow, I definitely enjoyed it here more so than my wife, but I left this restaurant feeling unfulfilled and went to get McDonald's on the way home. 3.5 stars for me.", "author": "Con N."}

The yellow tail was extremely fishy and the miso sauce tasted like mayo.  My friend told our waitress that the yellow tail was very fishy and she responded with \"thank you for telling me\".  \nIt had been roughly 20 min since they served my girls food and she was still waiting for our omakase to eat her sashimi.  40 MIN LATER we had had enough and asked our waitress what was taking so long.  She said that a lot of people ordered at one time and our food would be out soon.  Really?  What is this amateur hour?  These guys have been open for 6+ months and should have this dial in.  We told the waitress we have waited for over an hour and were going to leave. She said that our food was going to be coming out in 5min...one piece at a time.

Good shari (rice) to fish ratio, edomae style sushi where they paint on the sauce so you dont need soysauce. Everything was very fresh, and delicious favorites were the bluefin tuna marinated in jalopeno soy, so flavorful, and the tuna a very good quality grade tuna. Scallop was also high on the radar, considering normally I dont like scallop, this says a lot. The searing added a good texture to the normally mushy scallop...delish!\n\n\nadd ons to make our belly full!\n\nA5 wagyu nigiri, x 2- $10 a pop, but totally worth it. Beef comes cooked (seared I think so eat it while its warm) buttery & so tender\n$8 hokkaido uni chawanmushi, - almost as good as aki-san at sushi sho in el cerrito! except this one was highighted due to the hokkaido uni included inside! so precious and yummy\n$8 ankimo - the best ankimo weve ever had. Most ankimos have the gritty taste in the middle, but this one was SUPER smooth, velvety like foie. OMG!\nfried mackeral fish bone - on the house, one of our favs\n$3 tamago- so good, get it last for dessert, not a traditional tamago but has hints and notes of vanilla or coffee, almost like cake!\n$5 matcha daifuku- house made mochi with redbean and matcha inside. heavenly\nblueberry panna cotta $5 - good, not mind blowing, mild tasting like most japo sweets\ngrilled hokke- $8 this grilled fish was such a pleasant surprise. Its a grilled fish filet with bones, grilled over charcoal. You can tell the care the cook used to grill this fish to perfection, its normally a \"dry cured\" fish and they grill it so it comes hot, but it was the most moist and delicately seasoned fish. Comes with a side of yam. so delicious and healthy.\n\n\n\nHubby is generally a hater of small foods, and was pleasantly surprised at the japo chefs behind the counter.

Both my fianc\u00e9 and I tried the Omakase and it was so great to have the wide variety of sushi, tasty grilled fish (with the perfect crisp crust), and amazing tofu appetizers.  If you're looking for a traditional Japanese restaurant, this is it.  I don't eat raw fish that often but did tonight and it was amazing- better than I have had at any other sushi restaurant in SF!!!  They even lightly flavor each piece of sushi so you don't need soy sauce for dipping and can better taste the natural fish flavors.  I will be coming back here again soon!", "author": "Mindy R."}

In Japan, Edomae is a kind of niche style which chef usually put the sweet sauce on sushi. The sauce here was a bit more salty so I do not have to put additional soy source at all. This style is good fit with Omakase because I do not have to worry about what kind of sauce I should put on to each sushi. Anyway I am so happy to have Edomae in SF!!!", "author": "Ted H."}

I knew from the moment my husband and I sat down at the sushi bar, that ordering off menu and just asking for your sushi/sashimi omakase was the way to go.  The freshness of your ingredients, your amazing rice, and your subtle flavors -- all I can say is thank you.\n\nOrder what you will, but do yourself the pleasure of sitting back and putting your trust in the sushi master.  The man is an artist, and the sushi is worth every penny.", "author": "Hannah H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-22", "description": "I hate the typical Yelp review that starts, \"I've never had sushi before, but this is the best restaurant!\"  I've eaten a crapload of sushi, both in the Bay Area and in SoCal, but I have to admit that I haven't eaten at any of the other newish high-end places in San Francisco.  My partner lived in Japan for six years, and I may have picked up some of her fussiness about Japanese food, but I'm really just enthusiastic without being deeply knowledgable.\n\nThat said, this place seems like the real deal, with very traditional menu, and delicious fish with awesome texture.  Service was prompt and reasonably friendly.  It was certainly the best sushi I've had in San Francisco.  (Although now that I've read a few more of these reviews, I may be checking out the competition!)\n\nKoshihikari Echigo beer is ubiquitous in the Southland, but a bit tougher to find up in the Bay Area, so I was happy to see it here.", "author": "Kevin L."}

Portions are small and the nigiri rice seemed overcooked - a bit like unsweetened rice pudding underneath a morcel of fish. Even the sake that was recommended wasn't great. Decor was nice.  But think pay more for the \"Japanese-Iness\" of the place. Form over substance.", "author": "Tess A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-10", "description": "I would love to give this restaurant more stars! It just recently opened, but I have been here twice already. Both of the times, they went above and beyond my expectations. My family and I got the 7 course meal for the two times we were here. I believe it was $68 for a 7 course meal, but let me tell you, IT WAS WELL WORTH IT! Dish #1 was a three part appetizer: sesame tofu, mushroom medley, and okra and shishito pepper tempura. #2 maguro and seared hamachi sashimi #3 kyoto style grilled belt fish #4 hirame tempura #5 seven different nigiri sushi #6 miso soup #7 dessert. We also got chawanmushi in addition. It was the best chawanmushi I've ever had in the bay area. It was $8 and it had all sorts of things in it which included a fat piece of uni, white fish tasted like tai fish (not sure), snow crab, and it was just a whole lot of YUMMM. Not only does the food taste good, I love their presentation. It makes the meal enjoyable through the palate as well as the eyes. I know this place will never disappoint. If you are thinking about trying it out, you should do it soon because it just opened and it's already super busy. Weekends are pretty much reservations only because of their limited seating.", "author": "Saki S."}

The Norwegian mackerel was among the highlights.\n\nI will definitely be back.", "author": "andrew m."}

Got here at that time and we were seated near the door where it's a 4 seat table...wtf? We were not sitting comfortable. We asked to move to a roomier spot and they refused. Fine. Whatever...ordered the 7 course omakase for $68....omg...so not worth it!  The first 3 small tiny little plates tasted good but the portion size so small!  Nigiri's were okay sized, rice was good but again not worth 7 nigiri, 3 small plates, 1 grill, tempura, miso soup, and tiny ass dessert. Ordered one of their rolls where you can choose up to 7 items- good but way too small.  Sushi Sam is still by far the best!!  At least their salad order is a good portion size to share. We ordered some kind of a salad here and it was the size of my palm! Waste of time and money. Oh and forgot to mention- They charge you for wasabi if you ask for extra the 2nd time!!! Just cuz it's fresh doesn't mean you should charge $3 for so little wasabi!! Each order of raw fish should come with some sort of wasabi, correct? But only 2 of our many orders came with wasabi. We had to ask for more and when we did, they told us that it's $3 for extra....", "author": "Alyce l."}

The inside is so traditional Japanese style that I got the feeling that I was in Japan. The waitresses were very cordial and polite and the Sushi Chef was fun to chat with. Of course the reason I went there was because of the food. The presentation is absolutely beautiful and too good to eat. The fish is very very fresh and the other customers commented on this is what they were impressed with. Japanese restaurants run by other nationalities other than Japanese is fearful if you are looking for Sashimi or Nigiri. I have gone to other restaurants such as Sanraku Metreon and I would say that the price is quite reasonable for the quality you get. I will definitely go back again and recommended this restaurant to many others especially the caucasians and other nationalities who really know the true Japanese cuisine like in Japan.", "author": "Frederick K."}

It's a small restaurant stuck into a crowded part of Clement Street, so find it and make a reservation. You won't want to miss this. We enjoyed fresh butterfish and sweetfish nigiri sushi, plus several other items from the menu, which changes daily depending on what fish they can get as fresh as they can. Among other things, we had the roasted seafood and vegetables, which were served in an abalone shell. I brought my girlfriend there for her birthday dinner, and while we were not late for our reservation, we didn't have time to go home and dress appropriately for our dinner. I was dressed in long shorts and felt embarrassed to go into such a classy restaurant, but the waitpersons could not have been more gracious and accommodating to us. Thank them  for such a wonderful and memorable dinner. We enjoyed every taste and dish we had, but especially enjoyed the black cod with eggplant, and loved the grilled fish collar, which is sometimes butterfish but happened to be salmon that night. What an elegant, gracious, lovely meal.", "author": "Susan R."}
