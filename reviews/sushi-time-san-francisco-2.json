It's a little difficult to find if you're not paying attention -- it's located inside a dark alley almost. I found it by just paying attention to the actual address (2275 Market). There's a little sign inside the alley that will direct you to Sushi Time, just walk down the short stairs and you'll see it to your left! \n\nThis place is definitely super tiny, so seating is limited. Service was quick and friendly. I was lucky enough to get a tight table but don't be surprised if you have to wait or sit at the bar! \n\nSushi was great. The sashimi was very fresh ($8.25 for 3 pcs) but small portioned. I suggest getting nigiri if you want something raw -- the slice will be bigger (2 pcs for $5.25) \n\nI ordered the spicy salmon roll (roughly $7) and the oshinko roll ($3.50). Both were decent! \n\nThis is a great spot if you want fast, fresh and delicious sushi for a fair price! Also very clean which is a plus. Definitely a cozy and nice, casual date place.

The three of us sat at the bar area, where we had a view of the chefs making their creations. \n\nService staff was quick and courteous. The ambiance is cozy, romantic. Lots of quirky wall decor. Lots of tables of twos. \n\nI ordered the tekka don (tuna on rice with miso soup and side salad). It was a little pricey ($22) but I think well worth it. The tuna was absolutely delicious!

Came here for a last minute happy hour dinner with my cousin. I had to sit at the bar because she hadn't arrived yet so make sure your whole party is there if you want to sit at a table. \n\nI only had ten minutes to order so I got four rolls, the tofu salad, the sashimi five, two scoops of sesame ice cream, and a large hot sake. The happy hour deal isn't actually that great. The rolls are only $1 off the regular price and its bizarre how they try to nickel and dime you at every turn. It costs $1 if you want a shiso leaf like wtf?! The whole menu has shit like that. Minimum charges per person, extra $1 here, extra 50 cents there. Oh and they charge for gluten free soy sauce too wtf. Werid. \n\nThe rolls were huge and tasty. The spicy tuna roll is SUPER spicy though. I've never had one so spicy before. The sashimi was just okay. The first piece of salmon sashimi I had was super fishy and gross but the other pieces were fine. Loved the tofu salad and its huge. Ice cream scoops were big too. We left completely stuffed. \n\nDecor here is beyond cute. I love every little detail of it. Service is fine too. Everyone here I think is Chinese. It was kind of funny hearing the chefs speak in Chinese about how they were going to have noodles for dinner.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

I feel Takara has better seasonal menu, but is harder to get into if you don't time it right.\n\nThe first time I went to Sushi Time was one of the last nights my friend was in town before his worldly travel session. He let me know its a bit difficult to find - you enter a courtyard, head downstairs to something that feels oddly authentic. With the curved front window, small bar, and only a handful of seats this feels like something you could experience in Japan. \n\nThe menu is fairly simple as this is primarily focused on sushi - they have some basic appetizers, some standard nigiri and the biggest option/reason to come are the affordable rolls. That said, always take a look at their specials menu. On my most recent trip they had Hawaiian kampachi and Hamachi Toro.\n\nThe first time I came, I did a mix of the nigiri (because I'm a fish snob) while my friends mostly did the rolls, and then I ate some of their rolls. The second time my friend and I split a few rolls. We got:\n\nHawaiian kampachi sashimi: I wanted to introduce my friend to a fish he can't get back on the East coast. A nice, flavorful whitefish and these were solid sized pieces (looking at you Akiko!)\nRainbow Roll: It's a rainbow roll. If you like a variety of fish, this is the safest bet\nAstroboy: They weren't kidding with the spicy scallop. This had plenty of heat but was really good.\nSpeed Racer: Tuna and mango. Simple, cheap, but yummy.\nBarbie Roll: Basically a rainbow roll but with all salmon. \n\nFor drinks they offer a solid selection of teas and sake. I've had the delightful genmaicha from the tea menu and I've done a sake sampling here before. \n\nSo if looking for an affordable, accessible, roll-focused sushi place in the Castro that's also a cute date spot, can definitely recommend Sushi Time. If looking for a fish purist spot, would probably hit up Takara instead.", "author": "Michael C."}

I wasn't sure what \"a lot\" is, but we didn't press the issue. Several entrees that were ordered came with soup and salad. There's a lack of awareness with the servers, they overall didn't come off very friendly/welcoming. One was right by our table but it still took two inquiries to get spoons for the soup. The food itself was received well with the group. I personally loved the barbie roll. Also be aware that there is a minimum order of $10/person.

It looked like a glass tube of a metro train car or something sticking out from a wall.  The entrance was small, with lots of Japanese decorations, and the fun, cheerful decoration continued inside all the way from the entrance to the back. We were greeted with very warm smile and welcome by Japanese owner and staff. I was super happy to see that it was operated by Japanese people, that meant that I was going to have some good, authentic sushi!\n\nInside was a bit narrow, just like a train car. Even though it is located underground, the glass tube exterior brought in lots of light. In order to provide some privacy, they had bamboo and cloth covering on that side. Not many seating there, the sushi counter extended about half or a bit more than half of this \"train car\" shaped restaurant, and several tables and chairs behind it. Once it gets crowded, it can get a bit warm, since they don't have any window or good ventilation (they had a fan running at the back to provide some air flow). \n\nWe went during the happy hour, and got some sashimi and sushi.

They end up overnight in those little capsule-shaped compartments with their wives nary the wiser for their drunken escapades. I only bring those up because when I entered Sushi Time, that's what it feels like. I walked by the sandwich sign for the place all the time, so my curiosity got the best of me one evening and I gave it a try. I walked down the staircase (photo: http://bit.ly/1JvYCho), turned left and made the startling realization that the sushi bar and the tables next to the greenhouse-like window are all this place has to offer (photo: http://bit.ly/1HtEIS5). Am I in the Ginza?\n\nIt was a good thing I was there early on a Monday evening since I was their first solo customer. Even though they told me to sit anywhere, I sat at the end of the sushi bar assuming this place would fill up quickly. It did, and I was fairly well scrunched into my little space. Sleeping tube redux. The menu is full of sushi and sashimi treats though not quite as fanciful as Takara Sushi nearby. For a breather, I started with the no-risk $3.50 Edamame (photo: http://bit.ly/1Nupyg0). Pretty standard. I moved on to the $6.95 Kamikaze Roll, which turned out to be five pieces of yellowtail, avocado and scallion rolled in rice sprinkled with tobiko. On the same plate was a couple of Chutoro (Yellowtail Belly) Nigiri which were blessedly unaccessorized for maximum flavor (photo: http://bit.ly/1GYaapU).\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the $8.95 Baked Mussels, a quartet prepared almost like Oysters Rockefeller with the mussels mixed with crab meat, tobiko, panko crumbs and their own mayo sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1HwlRrh). Even though it was fairly filling, they were just a bit too fussy for my taste. I probably should have gone for more rolls. Two young sushi makers were keeping busy in front of me, while one waitress handled the whole room. By the time I finished, I have to admit Sushi Time was a pretty adequate spot for a sushi fix in teh Castro, even if it does pale in comparison to the likes of Ino Sushi in Japantown or Akiko's on Bush in the FiDi. Unless you really, really want to eat in a sleeping tube. I don't think they let you sleep there though.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...sushi is pretty good, not outstanding and those baked mussels taste like they belong in another generation\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...sleeping tube\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...nice at first but increasingly elusive as it got crowded\nTOTAL - 3 stars...tiny greenhouse of a sushi spot in the Castro provides a satisfactory sushi fix", "author": "Ed U."}

The service is extremely friendly and the price point is so reasonable for such yummy sushi. The husband and I usually order a bottle of the unfiltered sake special (which is only $10 for an entire bottle that we can split among two folks) and do a more bottomless approach with our sushi... basically, we order almost everything on the menu! \n\nWe're so obsessed with their sashimi selection of salmon, red tuna and yellowtail, as well as the two chef's special nigiris, fatty tuna and spanish mackerel. In terms of the more fusion rolls, we love the Barbie Roll (crab, avocado and fresh salmon) and the Speed Racer Roll (tuna, mango and tobiko). Lastly, the tamago and uni nigiri are such classics and must-orders. \n\nFor 2 people with an insanely gluttonous appetite and a bottle of sake to share, the bill usually comes out to less than $100. \n\nAs much as I'd love to keep Sushi Time a secret, I must do the business some justice and provide the accolade that it truly deserves. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

Kinda slow but whatever.\n\nMy friend and I started with the green salad, which was okay. The dressing was good. We ordered an assortment of nigiri and I thought the fish was decently fresh (yay) but the rice was mushy. The Barbie Roll (recommend by Yelpers) was also disappointing. There was no real flavor. Anyways, I had a good time only because I was with good company, and we ordered a giant thing of sake.

I had the salmon bowl, my friend had the assorted sashimi bowl, and my other friend got the bento box (which included: Eel, spicy tuna roll, salad, and 3 slices of abalone). She wanted the Clam Miso Soup to be switched out with the normal Miso Soup that it came with, and it was a simple switch of $6. It was definitely worth it.

You have to search for it as it's in a strip-mall-type building and downstairs with a glowing neon \"sushi\" sign with an arrow pointing straight to the door. When you walk in you're welcomed to this teeny-tiny hole in the wall the size of a semi-truck trailer, decorated really beautifully and simple. It's intimate, fun, and a nice change of scenery from the new, clean-cut San Francisco that I'm not used to yet.\n\nAnd the food is incredible. They have an abundance of tea, sushi, sashimi, nigiri, and maki choices, and I don't think you can make a bad choice.

I'm pretty sure I could hear them debating the merits of Silverlake versus Los Feliz from the street out front, had I left... which I almost did. Except they were sitting two feet away and I couldn't hear a word my dining companion said because of it.\n\nBottom line: On an empty night, I think I'd like it. But every table was full, and I felt like I was in a middle seat on a Southwest flight. Too cramped, too loud, too little personal space. The food was tasty if not amazing, but it was a bit pricier than even the upscale places in the neighborhood, and the portions were small-ish.\n\nIt's rare that my rating differs so much from the 'mean' score on a Yelp review, but in this case, it's a two-star place for me.

Probably one of the best sushi rolls I've ever had. The salmon was like butter, and all the ingredients were rich and creamy. I also got the Speed Racer Roll, which was a hit and miss. A few pieces had lots of mango and were great, whereas most of the others had very little and tasted unbalanced. Also got the miso soup, which is especially great on a cold day.\n\nThe sushi menu is also great; from Astro Boy, to G.I. Joe, to Teddy Bear, this would definitely be a fun menu to explore!\n\nI've mostly had sushi at buffets before, and the quality of food here was incomparably better. I was also surprised to find that 16pcs were more than enough for me to leave the restaurant feeling pleasantly full.\n\nThe service was attentive and friendly.\n\nThe atmosphere was terrific. The place is tiny and covered with Japanese styled wallpaper and knickknacks. Really felt like a hidden gem; the name \"Underground Sushi Time\" is absolutely perfect.", "author": "Drini C."}

Way better than Baracada sushi (down the street), which oversauces their rolls. The place is intimate (get ready to be close your neighbor) but surprisingly romantic and relaxed.\n\nGet the sea urchin - it's creamy and cold; and the Barbie Roll - which is I believe California roll wrapped in salmon and thin lemon slices on top for a nice zing.

I gave 2 stars because their service wasn't that bad and the decor was pretty cute. We went there around 9:30pm and there were only a few customers in the restaurants. At first, I thought the place looked pretty decent and authentic but then when I stepped in, I could hear the chefs were from China and they spoke very loud in Mandarin and Cantonese then I immediately knew that this restaurant is not authentic at all and probably not that delicious also. My bf ordered Chirashi Don and he said it was the worst he have ever had, by visual appearance, those sashimi were not fresh at all and they only gave a little but with so much rich on the bottom. The portion was just weird. Whenever, I go to a Japanese restaurant, I will always order natto roll if they have it, and so this restaurant actually got natto roll! Unfortunately, the natto roll was so bad that I don't know what to say because natto roll is so easy to make, just put natto with the rice and roll it, like you don't have to cook it or whatsoever. The natto was very warm and a little like 2 - 3 only in one roll, ARE YOU SERIOUS?! I can go to 99 ranch and buy 3 packs of natto and only cost me 10 bucks. I was so disappointed with that and the maki rolls was terrible x2. The rolls were so blend and not even FRESH at all! I honestly don't know why there were so many good reviews, I hope it was just only a bad day for me but I will definitely won't recommand anyone to go to this place for AUTHENTIC Japanese food.", "author": "Tina W."}

Ok I'm exaggerating with the Harry Potter but it's so tucked away I've never noticed it!! \n\nSushi Time is a tiny intimate spot. It's a kitschy place decorated with origami and what I would call \"leftover Japanese Christmas wrapping paper.\" There's really only the sushi bar and maybe 4 small tables. It CAN get busy here. I dropped in on a weeknight at 6pm and there was only one couple at the bar. Another time I was at Dinosaurs and peeked over to see that they were at max capacity with a wait list so I stuck with my plans of banh mi at Dinosaurs. \nI wouldn't necessarily make it a destination spot. If you're in the area and it happens to not be so busy, sure you can give it a try. \n\nThey have a happy hour from 5-6pm. I can't recall the entire menu but I did a quick scan and saw some basic appetizers and basic maki on there. We got with 5 piece sashimi off the happy hour menu. Waitress was kind enough to offer it to us even though it was 6:02pm. \n\nIn total we ordered: \n\nSushi 5 ( 5 pcs sashimi)  - 3 salmon, 2 albacore.  Decent quality no complaints here. \nBaked mussels -  chopped green mussels with crab, tobiko and mayo. too dry. Needs more sauce and a little lacking in flavor. Maybe another ingredient. Cheese? \nSpicy walu roll - walu, avocado, spicy mayo.  The rich butteriness of the walu is lost in the mayo and avocado. Maybe not again next time. \nAstro boy roll - spicy scallop, mango, cucumber ,  & tobiko. YUMMMMM get this!!! Naturally sweet scallop with spicy sauce and mango is such an amazing combo. Then you get the cool crunch of cucumber and the pop of tobiko. Great flavors and texture, my favorite of the night. \nHello kitty roll - mango, cucumber, tobiko, & albacore. It comes with a side of ponzu sauce for dipping, but it didn't compliment the roll at all. I just used a teeny bit of soy sauce instead. Although it sounded tasty to me, this roll was just mehhh ok. \n\nSpent close to $50 and I would have to say... I wasn't overly stuffed and as a matter of fact we went to Taco Bell after.

The later was with crab, avocado inside and topped with salmon and fresh lemon.  The other roll came with tuna and mango and tobiko on the outside.   What I really liked was the simplicity of the rolls, their kitchy names and the combination of ingredients wasn't off the crazy.\n\nA glass of sake and a large Asahi to wash it all down.  I sushi rolled myself right out of there full and happy.  It's always SUSHI TIME in my book so this place definitely hit it out of the park for me.", "author": "Caesar R."}

It's a small and quaint sushi joint. luckily we didnt have to wait and sat at the bar. \n\nwe got the 10-piece combo from the appetizer section and it was DELICIOUS. we also ordered the 5 piece walu special which was also super tasty. we were still a bit hungry after 15 pieces and had a great experience so we ordered a rainbow roll which was just as good. \n\nsushi time definitely does not dissapoint. also, it's a great date spot but you probably dont want to go there if you want to talk about anything personal.", "author": "Janet Y."}

A tiny sushi place with rave reviews on Yelp? I was down. We walked down Market Street to no avail, but then we saw a small opening of what looked to be an indoor mall area across the street. We ventured over there and there it was -- the neon Sushi Time sign!\n\nThe location makes it seem secretive and kind of trendy, but I love how intimate it is. There's a bar area with about 8 or so seats and another 8 tables for 2. Walking in, we were immediately greeted by the host/waiter and seated in a cozy corner. On the table there's a small container of soy sauce, a little plate for your soy sauce, a napkin, and wooden chopsticks held together in a wooden case. It was simple and cute. \n\nWe ordered some sake (which turned out to be too much to finish for either of us). When you order the larger size, it comes in a cute glass and they let you pick out your own shot glass to pour it in from their little collection.\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered the Barbie Roll, the Spicy Tuna Roll, and the Rainbow Roll. Not too long after we ordered, our rolls were delivered to us all laid out on a single plate. They were all nicely put together and I almost didn't know where to start! The Rainbow roll was tasty and just as I remembered. The Spicy Tuna roll was pretty average, though mild when it came to the spice. The one that I was pleasantly surprised with was the Barbie Roll! Maybe it was a hidden chunk of wasabi that I had mixed in with my soy sauce or the zip of sourness from that unassuming bit of lemon so delicately placed on top of each piece, but there was a spicy/sour flavor that just popped out at me and it was GOOD! I can honestly say that it was my favorite of the meal and one of my favorites ever!\n\nI think our total came out to close to $50 after tax. The prices are pretty average compared to other places I have been to. I think the thing that put our bill over the top was the sake that we barely made a dent in. \n\nThe restaurant is a cute date night place because it's small, intimate, and casual. Yes, you have to ask for a key from the host to use the bathrooms, but it's all part of the hole-in-the-wall ambiance of the place. The staff is very polite and attentive and the food is great! Sometimes you have to be careful about the quality of your food, especially if you're eating raw fish, but I didn't question this place at all. It looked amazing and tasted amazing!\n\nFor their service, ambiance, and unique sushi rolls, I hope I get to come back again!", "author": "Leana L."}

Perhaps a subway station in the bowels of new York or Tokyo?  So much fun.   Tons of decorations, and a layout you have to see for yourself. \n\nAs for the food:\nSake:  we found a very nice bottle (Hikoshima maybe?).  it was nice and smooth.  They brought a box of mismatched glasses out and we got to select which one we wanted to use.  Fun!\n\nI'm vegan so my choices were a bit limited, but I was delighted by the following. \nMiso soup!   They had a vegan option!   Thanks sushi time!   It had a good amount of tofu and seaweed, yummy.   \n\nVeggie roll:  fresh and very tasty. \n\n3 veggie salad:  they had three salads in one, this was a special.  Asparagus with a very light and delicate dressing.  This was so good, I could have eaten a bucket of it.  Mixed green salad, again a very nice delicate dressing.  Finally a wakame salad that was soooooo good I ended up getting a second order of just that \n\nMy husband is omnivore and he said the quality of the fish was great, nothing to write home about, but much better then your usual hole in the wall. \n\nMy two disappointments.  I came here because I wanted to try the vegan Gyoza featured on their online menu.  At the restaurant they told me they are no longer allowed to serve the cooked foods, too bad!  \n\nMy second disappointment was that they had a cold tofu entree on the menu served with 'chicken sauce'.

My favorite was the astro boy as it combines scallop and mango. Yum! Who knew it worked so well together. For the barbie roll, I thought the roll was okay, but there was bit too much lemon on it. Finally, the bf most enjoyed the crunchy roll but that's because it's fried.", "author": "Margaret R."}

Very, very, very good experience!\n\nWe arrived around 5:30pm there was one open table and a few seats at the bar. We decided to sit at the bar. It's a small restaurant but somehow it works. Their happy hour is between 5pm-6pm so we made it in time for that -- we ended up getting a great value for our money. They play good music that isn't intrusive at all. The location itself is a bit tricky and it would be easy to walk right past it without knowing since it's located down a flew flights of stairs and isn't visible from Market Street. Parking can also be a challenge, so be prepared to walk if you drive -- Muni may be the nest option if you live in SF.\n\nThe service was outstanding -- the sushi chefs and the waitstaff were very friendly, attentive and they each thanked us when we left.\n\nAs for the food -- we ordered various rolls and each tasted fresh and satisfied our craving for sushi. \nSpecifically, we ordered-\n--California Roll\n--Philadelphia Roll\n--New York Roll\n--Barbie Roll (highlight of the meal for sure!)\n--Mango Mochi Ice Cream (delicious -- and perfect way to end the meal!!!)\n\n5-star experience.

We started off with two teas. They have a really good selection of infused blends like peach apricot. It's a MUST to get if you come here. For an appitizer, we got the tuna tartar. Presentation was great, along with the taste. I forgot what three rolls we got but they were okay. The sashimi is very fresh and melts in your mouth. It's sliced thinner so it was a different texture to other sushi places that serve it thick. MMM. :)\n\nSetting:  The place was very tiny, but very cozy. It's a nice dinner place to take someone out on a date. You're most expected with a friendly welcome and great customer service. IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON A PARTY OF 6+ THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. It's more of a home-y place for a small group.\n\nPrice: Altogether, the price came out to be around $60. Which is pretty average for a good sushi dinner. What can I say, you pay for what you get! \n\nCons:\nParking: Hard to find if you're going there for a late night dinner. Streets can be a bit confusing. Also the location of the place is pretty hard to find. If you're planning on using an Iphone for directions, you'd feel as confused as I was. \n\nTo sum it up, I would go here again because it was very YUMM.

This time, I wasn't too hungry to endure the wait and I was alone, so the number of seats available wasn't the issue. No, this time, they were just closed. \"Sorry for the inconvenience.\"\n\nThere used to be a cheap, crappy sushi place on the corner, but it took a good long look at itself since the last time I couldn't eat at Eiji and realized that it was living a lie. That is to say, the place on the corner is now a Chinese Restaurant.\n\nAnd that's how I found Sushi Time. Or \"Underground Sushi Time\" as the sign says. As you have read a dozen times by now, it's tucked away inside a deceptively deep outdoor mall that takes up the corner of Market and 16th. Entrances on either street are sushi-accessible. \n\nRock'n Roll - the weak link. I realize now that they don't serve cooked food at all. So no hot kitchen. No broiler for the eel, either, I guess. Which makes me wonder where the eel came from because even though it was served cold, it was still formerly broiled.\n\nSpeed Racer Roll - fun. It took a few bites for me to figure out that when mango is in the equation, even more wasabi than usual is required. Otherwise it was a bit too sweet.\n\nWild salmon nigiri - fresh. The end.\n\nI sat at the bar, drank my fresh sake, ate my sushi, and didn't bother nobody. The atmosphere was cozy and cavelike. The service was prompt.

In the  scale of increasing tenderness and sweet lip:  for example:   tai (red snapper), shima aji (amber jack), kanpachi (greater amberjack, and a personal all time favorite). Advanced  sushi eaters deviate from Tuna eating seeking for the perfect texture.    Please note that: albanoe was available on weekends' special menu\n\nLast week, I tried something very adventurous:  slowly boiled, simmered stingray 'arm' (believe it or not)  Eihire nitsuke. But, whoe!!  What an adventurous  experience.\n\nThe cooking is extremely well executed: thick savory soup to mask the naturally fishy taste, slow cook allow the meat to soften, and the 'bone' was crunchy and edible. But yes, the natural fishy taste will keep me away for a while\n\nDiners are allowed to buy one piece of sashimi at a time - very affordable in this expensive restaurant. That makes Tai - red snapper $3 for a tasting / brief satisfaction.\n\n\nThat being said Kabuto has other more tangible creative dishes: specialty sushi  that you can't find anywhere else. Everyone talks about Cerviche, it was perfectly executed, the halibut was extremely tender and soft, with perfect light flavor of lime and salt\n\nAt first,  I thought about ranking it 3 stars.  The main reason was because the restaurant is rather shabby looking. There is no ambiance for the money you are paying.  The space is so  small and so crammed, such that the wall bare except for a couple of odd decors. Most disappointedly, the waitresses are very busy and less friendly, unlikely to engage in a passionate sushi discussion with us, well, and  perhaps, I strongly suggest that, it is the intensity trickling down from the sushi counter chefs.\n\nSushi chefs are tense and serious, lack of smile or communication even to those sitting at the counter. That is zero words, zero interaction. That really killed one of the best part of the dining experience. If you come here alone, you will be alone forever.And if you come here with a group, the restaurant can barely accommodate.\n\nFighting between 4 stars or 3 stars.......", "author": "Randal M."}

There's no skimping in the portion either, though I wouldn't describe it as generous.\n\nSushi Time's address is on Market Street,but  the actual location is as everyone says is \"underground.\" I don't mind it at all because it reminds me of restaurants in Japan where it's not uncommon to step down and into a cave-like food establishment. The Japanese decorations create a cozy atmosphere to an otherwise fairly cramped space.\n\nAlthough not rude, service at Sushi Time could be improved considerably. It's surprising how the servers often fail to pay attention to the diners considering how small a space they have to watch. The servers strike me as scatterbrains. The kitchen is always a little slow, so perhaps despite the smallness of its size, Sushi Time may be understaffed or lacking trained employees.

It's average in price - I got a yellowtail maki roll (just yellowtail and scallions) for $5, a spicy tuna for about the same, and a salmon / avocado roll for around $5.50.  That sounds super cheap, but you only get 6 pieces instead of 8 in each roll, so if you're a sushi lover or just have a big appetite, you'll probably need 3 rolls, if you stick to the not so fancy items on the menu.\n\nAlso - our rolls came out at lightening speed.\n\nHowever, if you go during happy hour (5pm - 6pm), this place IS super cheap.  They have a good selection of rolls for a dollar or two less than they normally are.  Yes, our experience was so phenomenal on Saturday night that we came back on Monday.\n\nBut trust me, the rolls are worth every penny.  Each roll has a VERY generous chunk of fish.

Nigiris have always been fresh and soft, though their rice is hit or miss (last time too dry, other times too moist).  Rolls are of the solid B to B+ variety. \n\nThey don't take reservations, but if you go with a small group (2 people) you probably won't have to wait more than 15 minutes. Not good for larger groups.

I've had many dragon rolls in my lifetime, but this stood out from all the others. This was the freshest, yummiest dragon roll ever. The crab meat had a bit of a buttery taste to it.

The pro's: Food, Service, Value, and Environment. The con's: Wait times, parking, and limited seating. \n\nPro:\nFood/Value: We ordered some one off pieces of nigiri, and Sushi Combo B, which I thought was a great value. Overall I was really surprised by how delicious the food was and how reasonable the prices were overall. You'll find other sushi places that are a lot over the top and will charge you a lot more but Sushi Time does a good job of giving you excellent food at a great price. \n\nService: Our server was very prompt and friendly. Excellent Service. \n\nEnvironment: I listed environment as a pro and a con because on the one hand Sushi Time has a great fun/light environment but on the other hand the seating is extremely limited and cannot host large parties. I've never been to Japan but I kept feeling that Sushi Time was plucked from the streets of Tokyo and dropped in Castro. \n\nCons: \nWait Times/Limited Seating: Since the seating is so limited I could imagine people experience long wait times. We got really lucky and just walked in but got seating in under 15 mins. We must've just hit the right spot because the dinner rush had arrived right behind us. \n\nParking: Sushi time doesn't have a parking lot of their own but you can find parking in the residential neighborhoods on the other side of Market street.", "author": "Ken C."}

After we ordered, the waiter came back with a box of sake glasses that looks like something you might find at a garage sale.  Some glasses were in a matched set, but others were loners: single glasses that were unique and interesting, but did not have a mate.  This was a very charming way to start off dinner at this hidden gem.\n\nAfter making our selections of the fishes we would devour, the sushi chef offered up his suggestions for what was best that day, and even suggested we upgrade our hamachi to the otoro he had in that day for $1 more.  $1 more?!?!?

Now, I'm used to slightly pungent, fishy tasting collar, but this one was spectacular and cooked perfectly.  The only, minor problem with the preparation was the lack of a crispy skin, which i come to expect from a good collar.

I guess it might have been better if I didn't have such high expectations coming in after reading the reviews on yelp.  The reviews are right about the price and and food quality, but I guess the experience was soured a bit from the beginning.  My roommates (party of 3) went to check this place out on a friday night.  When we got there, it was already 9 so we figured the line couldn't be that long.  The place is extremely small and hole in the wale but it does remind me a typical restaurant in Japan..they do an awesome job with the decorations and laid back Japanese decor.  We walked in and the place looked half empty.  There was one couple waiting outside and I couldn't understand why there was a wait when there were so many open tables and they weren't reserved either.  I believe it was the owner who was taking care of the sign up list.  There were 7 table ahead of us and i kept looking around and there were 4 open tables.  All the names had phone numbers next to them.  The hostess explained they needed to call all the 7 numbers first before they could sit us.  I believe this sign up w/ your number and wait for a call when your reservation method is so stupid. It is bad for business...you should never have open tables, especially when it is a friday night and those empty tables could be working on getting turned over.  Instead we saw two more empty seats open up..this was after 15 minutes of waiting outside seeing half the place empty and the entired sushi bar was empty..another 5 mins passed and then they said ..5 more minutes to wait if the tables on the list don't call back.  They really get rid of the calling the sign up sheet system.  We waited 20 minutes for an empty sushi bar...i've never seen such an inefficient system.  They would give the list a call..and wait like 10-15 and if the people didn't show up, they would seat the next.  They should be like everyone other efficient restaurant and call out and if your not in the waiting area...you move to the next on the list.  Stupid rule..kinda soured our experience but but anyways, enough with the bitching and on to the food.\n\nWe ordered a crap load of food.  I had the GI Joe, Rainbow roll, San-sald, and Ikura over rice.  The sushi rolls are small but the prices are on the spot.  Many of the rolls are just $5.  The san-salad was one of the better salads I've tried in the city...not a knockout but satisfying.  The fish on the rolls were outstandingly fresh.   The meal all in all was pretty good.  We slapped on a few bears and sakes and the bill came out to be about $140 for 3 guys which included a satisfying round of drinks.  \n\nI would recc this place only for parties of 2 as the place is really small.  I really wasn't that impressed...I'd only go back during happy hour where the food is even cheaper and who can argue with that.  I was quite skeptical at first when I walked in because I was one of only 3 Asians in the restaurant as far as customers go.  I eat out a lot and I know a lot of good places but the asian rule usually is when it comes to asian restaurants is if there are more white people than asians sitting down, then the place can be decently good but not outstanding.  The rule was correct in this case.  I think this place was not bad...the pricing point is what would make me go back but I've had better.  For the same pricing point if not cheaper...but better food (but hole in the wall setting), try Tani's Kitchen in Westlake shopping center.  I'm loyal to that place because I still haven't found a Japanese joint that had such good food for that cheap.", "author": "Eric H."}

Regularly, it comes with miso soup, salad, 7pc. nigiri (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, albacore, white fish, shrimp, egg), and 5pc. spicy tuna. For an extra 50 cents during happy hour, you get a small sake or ice cream. I also had their smoked salmon nigiri. \n\nTheir nigiri was okay. Their cuts weren't stingy, but they weren't overly generous either. They put wasabi under the fish. I wished they put more, and used more potent stuff, but I guess they gotta appeal to the masses. White fish? I didn't know what it was, but it had a good texture. Their smoked sake was good, but it can't compare to Sushi Sho's (TRY the smoked salmon after the regular). The spicy tuna was weird...\n\nSERVICE: The waiters were great -- very polite and accommodating. We came in a group, 2 stag, 2 couples. They knew to ask if we wanted separate bills.

There was plenty of green onion and pea sprouts in it and was presently beautifully.

This is by no means the best sushi restaurant I've been to, but it is one of the most comfortable, perhaps even lovable.  The space is puny, with four or five 2-person tables and a sushi bar that seats about 7 or 8.  It's all laid out in one rectangular room.  What you see when you walk in is what you get.\n\nMasa-san himself is a friendly man -- an unpretentious cast member in his own little play.  He works with a small handful of dedicated, personable, occasionally garrulous sushi chefs, all of whom are quite good.  Because the place is so small, you can watch an itamae prepare sushi from anywhere you sit.\n\nOne of the reasons I like this place so much is that Masa-san has a perspective on food, which proves that he cares about the quality of what his diners eat.  For instance, he does not serve toro.  Why not?  Because of its reported mercury levels.  That's fine, although ironic since Masa-san is more interested in what mercury can do to us than in what we do to bluefin tuna by overfishing it.  In any case, he is careful about where he gets his fish, and this care becomes palpable when you bite into a piece of sashimi or nigiri sushi.  Their hamachi and shiromaguro are among some of the best I've had in town.  Although the actual fish selection is smaller than, say, Ebisu, it is consistently good.\n\nAnother reason this place is a winner is that you don't have to endure the clumsy ministrations of a waiter.  Just sidle up to the bar and start ordering from your itamae.  You can even tell him how many pieces of sashimi you want instead of being forced to eat 5 or 6 pieces of prix fixe fish.\n\nIf you've got to have cooked food at your sushi restaurant, you can't go wrong with the baked mussels.  Unfortunately, one order is too large for one person.  Trust me, I've tried to eat a whole order myself.  They make the baked mussels to order, so enjoy other delicacies while the mussels slowly bake for 20 minutes.\n\nIt's a great little date joint, but I wouldn't go here with a party of more than three.", "author": "Andrew L."}

This weekend some friends and I were seeking a sushi restaurant to meet at.  Ideally, one conveniently located nearby public transportation from the Inner Sunset and a short drive from the Mission.  Yelp led us to Sushi Time.  Again, Yelp was right (god damn Yelp - always being right...).  \n\nSushi time is hidden away underground with a sign that is difficult (if not impossible) to spot from the street.  Instead, watch for the address, enter the little cave-like entrance way nearby - and follow a flight of stairs down to the entrance to this street-car sized sushi haven.\n\nMy entire party agreed that the Barbie Roll, G.I. Joe Roll, and the sardines were fantastic.  Good vibe, comfortable atmosphere, and great food at extremely reasonable prices.", "author": "Matthew H."}

I live across the street so it's really convenient to go to.\n\n The servers are really friendly and their demeanor makes me smile each time I'm there. I love that you get to pick your own sake cup when you order a bottle.\n\nThe happy hour is great (5:30p - 6:30p) if you're into the standard rolls and like hot sake. They also have some really good tataki on their special's menu. I've also had their vegetable gyoza which is super tasty. If you're into amaebi they have a great plate that is presented really well. Their uni is good but not as plump and fresh as Eiji or Daimaru.\n\nThe wait can be a bit long if you don't get there early since it's so small, but it's worth it. Sometimes their sushi chef's can get backed up and it will take a bit longer to get your food, but you won't be disappointed.", "author": "craig s."}

Why did I do this? Well, because we are dorks and dorks like goofy stuff like that, but more importantly, so that we could always say...\n\n\"Que tiempo, Stephy?\" \n\n\"It's sushi time, fother mucker!!\" \n\nWell, finally there is a sushi joint that gets it and named itself appropriately, because when it comes to sushi, anytime is a good time and I have the dwindling bank account to prove it! \n\nLast night, I was taken here by a coworker and was definitely curious as he billed it, \"Underground sushi\" Ooooh, how mysterious. Well, underground I don't know. I mean, it's actually just down a flight of stairs, but hey, I'll go with it. \n\nThe place is about the size of my livingroom and totally charming. It's cozy, it's kinda dark and you are practically sitting on top of the person next to you.

Do not come here with a big party or else you won't get to eat! We made reservations for 2 people for a Friday night and it worked out fine. The place was somewhat hard to find since it is somewhat underground. It's not in plain street view but there is a sign that says SUSHI TIME and points to a flight of stairs leading downwards. \n\nKATSUO TATAKI SASHIMI\nI normally wouldn't prefer to eat raw fish but I gave this one a whirl. The fish was fresh because it melted in my mouth. \n\nSAKE\nWe asked the server for their best sake and was present with a $14 one in a small jug. The jug came out to be about 4 shots each and best of all, you can pick your own shot glass to use! They give you a wood basket of about 10 shot glasses in there and you can pick according to your liking. \n\nTheir rolls aren't big, and they're bit sized which is good...\n\nG.I. JANE ROLL (bbq eel, cucumber & tobiko)\nTypical BBQ eel roll. Nothing too special but everything was fresh!\n\nASTRO BOY (spicy scallop, mango, cucumber & tobiko)\nSpicy scallop + mangoes seem to not mix but this was interesting. \n\nBARBIE ROLL (crab, avos, fresh salmon & sliced lemon)\nI think this was my 2nd favorite roll coming close to the crunchy roll. The finely sliced lemon on top definitely added to the flavor. \n\nCRUNCHY ROLL (shrimp tempura, bbq eel, avos, cucumber, tobiko & sweet eel sauce)\nWe ended up ordering 2 of these! It was THAT tasty. Yum. \n\nDinner for 2 which included 5 rolls, 1 appetizer, and 1 small jug of sake came out to roughly $70 after tip/tax. \n\nI wouldn't come back here in the near future, but possibly in half a year or so.

Somewhere small, quaint, cozy and close. Off the top of my head, I quickly go through my short list of local sushi joints: \n\nSebo in Hayes Valley: Great sushi, but a tad too trendy and spendy for my mood. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/VkaWWpI6IvHTov5-_cJlag\n\nOzumo in the FiDi: Ditto above, minus the \"great sushi\" part. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/PNxwbgtfdpldd3CyJFIw3w\n\nRed Box in  the Tenderloin: Not feeling like making friends with drug dealers and hookers along the way. At least not tonight. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/Kl6lQfhhRurgJeBAyb7gyg\n\nAll those great places in the Richmond/Sunset: Too far for tonight. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/search?find_loc=San+Francisco%2C+CA+94175&action_search.x=0&action_search.y=0&action_search=Search&cflt=sushi&nflt=Inner+Richmond%5ESan+Francisco%5ECA\n\nEiji in the Castro: Food Radar went off the charts when I passed here last. Perfect, small, neighborhoody. But there's a 1.5 hours wait. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/-zetzVfO4X0dpiiTmjdeKg\n\nHama-Ko in Cole Valley: Perfect too. But an even LONGER wait. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/uSL7-qazmxfJq3IAqi3Gcg\n\nFinally I turn to Yelp and it leads me to Sushi Time... tiny, unassuming and within walking distance. Perfect. Located on the ground/basement floor of a mini-mall shopping complex, the exterior looks like some kind of mad-max submarine, and when you enter, there are only about 7 tables and a sushi bar in the long narrow space. A cool underground New York/Japanese vibe, reminds me of Decibel or Sakagura in NYC. \n\nDon't expect private conversation, you're crammed in like sardines and  can overhear everything your neighboring tables are saying (Psst to the couple at the next table: It seemed like you two clicked after just this first date. Best of luck.) \n\nWith limited space, and staff consisting of one waiter and two sushi chefs, the waits were long - 20 minutes for a table to open up, another 20 minutes for our poor harried (but cute) waiter to take our order, and another 20 minutes for our sushi to arrive. Even then, we had to remind our waiter to get us plates... then napkins...  then soy sauce... then the bill. \n\nWorth the wait? Unfortunately, not really. The sushi was average-to-good, but not the kind of melt-in-your-mouth delectable goodness that I had been hoping for, especially after such a production procuring the goods. \n\nBut the bill was surprisingly affordable, which makes me think that this is a great place to grab some neighborhood casual sushi if you're expectations aren't too terribly high and you've got some time on your hands (or a free night after say, getting stood up on a date).", "author": "Umami Y."}

After I had some of the salad and miso soup (that comes with the chirashi), I was enthusiastically optimistic.  None of the wilty greens that look like they came from a plastic bag at Safeway that you might get at other sushi restaurants.  This was super fresh and looked like each piece had been placed into the bowl by hand.  There was that much care and attention to detail.  The miso soup was... superb.  It actually tastes like miso and seaweed, and not like the hot watered down soy sauce that is sometimes served at other places.  The tofu was also extremely smooth and very, very good.\n\nAfter that, I was eagerly anticipating sushi that was just as good, and I was not disappointed.  All the fish was extremely fresh and well cut, the sushi rice was perfect, and the baked mussels were delicious.   Service was friendly and prompt, and prices are reasonable.

Tucked in the back lower level of a mini-mall, this is truly a hidden treasure. Now thanks to a friend, I've found it!\n\nBring yourself and one other person. If you're feeling extra special, make it a double date. No more than 4 because this place is tiny. For the first time, my studio apartment actually seemed like a big house in comparison. Pair this up a variety of cute, colorful adornments, a lot of Japanese being spoken, a blocked view to the dinky mall outside...and you can pretend that you are an expat in Japan.\n\nAll imagination aside, I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here with the BF last Friday.  While we looked at the menu, there was a lot of positive talk from the next table about the G.I. Joe and Barbie roll. It was almost too much positivity to refuse, but not wanting to be easily influenced, I decided on the bento box. The BF got Sushi Combo B. Good choices for both.\n\nI was especially pleased with my bento. Unlike the usual bento box with a cold piece of tempura and a slice of orange, the bento box here was fresh, tasty and not sad slice of fruit to be found. The BF seemed quite pleased with his choice as well...although he has higher standards than I do (so he would probably rank the sushi 8/10 vs my 8.5/10). But he did willingly eat the salmon nigiri. Very surprising since he hates salmon. That should say something even if our sushi rankings are slightly different.  \n\nWhen the time came to go home, we had to leave our new found treasure behind. It isn't of the gold coins variety, you see. It is, however, a discovery to be explored over and over again. To restart your adventure, go directly to the \"Sushi\" sign.", "author": "Rona J."}

Sometimes it feels like I've been to every place with an open door from Division to Cesar Chavez.  Then there are times that some wise, benevolent soul shows me the light and I realize there have been these little gems right under my nose the whole time and I've really been missing out.  Sushi Time is one such place.\n\nI have no idea how long Sushi Time has been there.  Furthermore, I do not care.  I only care that they are there now and that they never, and I mean NEVER stop serving or run out of the tuna avocado tartare.  I am not afraid to say this is one of the best dishes I've eaten in a long time, from anywhere.  A formed mound of perfect tuna, asparagus and avocado in a miso vinaigrette.  Simple, flawless, rich, fresh and addictive.  One day, I'm going to go and just order 4 or 5 of these.  Or 10.\n\nTho' that dish is reason alone to go to Sushi Time, there are other great things on the menu.  The delicious tai carpaccio with \"salsa\" of mangos, chiles, and sea salt is nearly as fantastic as the tartare.  The spinach goma-ae, GI Joe roll, speed racer roll, salmon skin roll, crunchy roll, the tataki and the aji nigiri...all consistently excellent and nicely presented even for sushi.  Plus, there are many items I haven't gotten to yet, which sound fantastic.  They have a small but interesting sake list too.\n\nSpeaking of small, did I mention this place is small?  No, I didn't...well, it's small.  Tiny, in fact.  Sort of like eating in a quirky, transparent maki roll if there could be such a thing.  The music is often fun, the service gracious and prompt.  There's not much room, so expect a wait...just know that it is absolutely worth it.\n\nWell done, Sushi time!!!", "author": "Peter L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-16", "description": "Every time I think I've found the happiest place on earth, there's another place that's even happier.  I think Sushi Time is going to hold its place at the top for quite a while, though.  Because, man.  It's like concentrated happiness.\n\nSushi Time is hidden in a very small mall-ish-looking thing in the Castro, and as I descended the stairs toward the restaurant, I had no idea what to expect.  What I got was about the most adorable restaurant in which I have ever had the pleasure of taking up space.  There are only about 6-8 tables for two, and a few places at the sushi bar.  It's all quite snug and cozy, and while the large and/or claustrophobic might find it to be a bit cramped, I felt I had finally found a restaurant that was made just for me.  There's cute little domed window facing the outside, and it's covered in colorful cloth.  There are things that are a bit like mobiles hanging from the ceiling, and the lights are dim, but not too dim.  The whole thing is fantastically womb-like, only much cuter than I imagine a womb to be.\n\nAnd then they feed you.  And that experience, too, was among the best casual sushi restaurant experiences I've ever had.  The menu was expansive, the maki were creative, the fish was very fresh and tasty.  The seaweed salad with which I started was on point, but I would actually recommend the nikumiso tofu.  The toasty ground chicken and miso sauce over the cold soft tofu was both salty and sweet, and made for a melty texture that I liked a lot.  My boyfriend and I also shared the sashimi six, the Hello Kitty roll, the veggie roll, and some nigiri of tai, walu, and uni.  All of it was as fresh as could be, but my favorites included the walu (butterfish), uni (sea urchin roe), and the Hello Kitty roll (mango, cucumber, tobiko, and white tuna).  The uni was my first ever (and I had it with quail egg), so I unfortunately can't compare it to other unis I have know.  But man, it was tasty.  So very creamy and with a taste that was of the sea without being at all fishy.  The Hello Kitty roll was as good as it sounds, and white tuna isn't something that I see often at sushi restaurants.\n\nOverarching things about their food that I liked - I liked the quantity of options that weren't fried.  I liked that there were options that were above and beyond standard sushi fare - spicy scallop in a roll?  Just one of the many reasons I must return.  I mentioned that I liked the freshness of the fish, but I also liked the ratio of all the ingredients.  It's not something I think about much, but so often we are fed rolls that aren't carefully proportioned, or that are glommed with so much rice that we don't necessarily get to taste the goodies within.  It really feels like the sushi chefs are careful not to upset the delicate balance of their art.\n\nSpeaking of the sushi chefs, a larger party bought them some sake, and they were so very happy.  They thanked the people multiple times and beamed from ear to ear.  We were seated at a table, but I watched them chat with the people at the bar.  They just seemed so friendly, and it was clear from the taste and presentation of their food that they were also knowledgeable people who care about what they do.  Not to be outshone, the waitstaff was kind and capable as well.\n\nAll in all, being at Sushi Time just really felt like a treat.  I think it's easy for people who really like food to get sort of compulsive about it.  Do research, travel, consume, ponder, go home.  But Sushi Time just really felt like a special place to be.  And their food felt like special food to eat.  The whole experience had a charm that I haven't felt in a while, and aside from the fact that I could eat sushi every day, I think I could probably eat Sushi Time sushi every day.  I might even go so far as to say that I might haul myself to the Castro to do so.  It's just that special.", "author": "Becca S."}

The place is small, which I like.  The design is cute in an adult, not hello kitty, kinda way.  The service is good.  The sushi and sashimi is always really good.  I don't know how to describe the difference between good sushi and bad sushi, but I have had enough sushi to spot the difference.  Most sushi spots in SF, really anywhere in the US, are disappointing.  Sometimes they put mayo on the sushi or overly thick tempura batter.  This place is not like that.  This is good sushi.  They have a nice and well priced chirashi, which is one of my favorite things to order.  I like how there are numerous options featuring shiso leaf, which I kinda like but I know won't be to everyone's taste.  The unique / special sushi rolls served here are good and interesting.  I remember rolls with a bit of spinach or mango.  Again less of the fried and/or mayo rolls you'll find at many sushi spots in the US.  I like this place a lot.  When I lived in the Castro, years ago, there really weren't many good restaurants.  This was one of the best.

We just finished doing our shopping rounds in the city, and decided to give this place a call to see how long the wait would be. Surprisingly enough, the Japanese accented gentleman on the phone told us they actually had space! We quickly tried to find parking (and by quickly i mean not so quickly since sf parking + quickly is an oxymoron). Thankfully when we go there the spots were still open. I was also very impressed that all the employees here were Japanese *yay!*. One thing to note is that they have super awesome chopstick holders! i don't know if they're really made out of bamboo, but it sure is in the shape of one. I wish I could've stole em. :D\n\nThis is what we ordered for the two of us:\n \nsashimi A (with sake salmon) - very very very fresh! the salmon wasn't too fatty, and it 90% soft and 10% chewy. (5/5)\n\nsan salad - best of all worlds! we couldn't decide which salad appetizer to get, and lo & behold there was san salad which came with the seaweed salad, asparagus goma-ae salad, and tofu salad. Both the seaweed and tofu salads were my favorites. The dressing on the tofu salad was very flavorful and made everything that it touched delightful. I wasn't that big of a fan of the goma-ae salad as the dressing was little too gritty for my liking and I'm not that big of a fan of black sesame. (4/5)\n\nrainbow roll -  One other great things about all their rolls is their perfectly bite size. Not too small to be insignificant and not too big so you have trouble fitting it into your mouth.  They have a good fish/filling to rice ratio ratio too. All the sashimi used for the rainbow were also very very fresh. (4/5)\n\nastro boy roll- I didn't find this roll to be as great as everyone made it sound here, but it was definitely good. I couldn't really taste the spicy mayo at all. This roll could use a bit more filling too. (3/5)\n\nGI-Joe roll - eel, cucumber and avocado goodness. (4/5)\n\nI was a little sad they don't have toro, but I will not be deterred. The food here was amazing, and is now going to be one of the top japanese places i go to in the city.", "author": "Gloria C."}

Friendly sushi chefs, always happy to talk to you and recommend a roll based on what you like.  \nThe place is a little tricky to find the first time coming in off Market St. (enter below the gym, down the hall, down the stairs, turn left.)  The result is you find yourself in a small, cave-like restaurant.  Some might call it cramped, but the small space and atmosphere inside make you feel like you are in Tokyo.\n\nThey have some happy hour specials when I'm in there sometimes, and the Nigiri is always fresh and delicious.  This is the one place in town that I'll actually eat (and enjoy) the salmon.  \n\nThe only downside is that there isn't much seating in there, so it isn't the kind of place you can take 10 people and get a table, but that is also nice because it means it isn't full of yelling saki-bombers.  \n\nNext time you have a hankering for sushi, check out Sushi Time.", "author": "Robert F."}

In fact we had to take 2 midterms b/c he failed to make enough copies of 1 exam, turned it into a take home test, and then gave us another unscheduled midterm a week later in class. What does this have to do with Sushi Time? Well, the manfriend sensed a storm brewing after listening to me bitch about the aforementioned exams and whisked me away to (the new to me) Sushi Time to erase the memories of p-chem. \n\nSushi Time allows you to grab a drink up top somewhere while you wait and calls you when your spot is ready. This is ultra convenient and a stark contrast to SPQR which won't even allow you to call them to check on your table. I had low expectations for S.T. as it's located below street level in an odd little shopping center. That being said, the quality of the fish and inventiveness of the dishes blew me away. \n\nWe started with the cucumber sunomono to prime the palate. From there, we moved on to the delicious tai carpaccio garnished with a tiny dice of mangos, chiles, and salt. Hamachi sashimi and maguro zuke nigiri were next, each one well cut, fresh, and bright tasting. A hello kitty roll and a tuna tartar (for our \"dessert\") followed. \n\nI loved the quality of the ingredients, the friendly service, and the little home-style details like the origami paper menu covers. The wait allowed us to get through 1 cocktail at a nearby bar which is pretty reasonable for a Friday night. My only complaint is in regards to the very meager wine selection. You can opt for a half bottle of Alexander Valley Chardonnay or Cabernet Sauvignon, or a full bottle of their Cab.  These are not the best wine pairing options for sushi in my opinion, or rather they are very confining. I would love to see a crisp, reasonably priced Cava or sparkling wine and a Sauvignon Blanc added to the list. Also, as a novice sake drinker, some descriptions would be helpful in the sake department. Still, that is a minor quibble after a great meal.

It came with a delicious green tea ice cream but it was only two spoonfulls of ice cream.  I am American, I like a huge bowl of ice cream.  but still, it was super delicious, I think it was homemade.  It was part of the meal so no big deal.  i could have ate more but I was broke, lol.

Also, super cheap.\n\nHowever, there were two things that are just unacceptable to me:\n\n- There was NO wasabi under the fish on the nigiri.  What the heck?  The sushi chef caught me lifting up a piece of fish with my chopsticks and told me that white people don't like the wasabi on the nigiri so he doesn't put it on.  Hello?  Do I look white?  And we're in California, not the deep South - people have developed palates here.  Do it right!\n\n- Part of why I love ordering amaebi (other than the sweet creamy texture) is because it comes with the deep fried heads.  They don't give them to you here.  When asked, the guy told me that the supplier doesn't give them the heads.  That seriously makes me question the quality and freshness of their fish.  Also, I felt ripped off.  They should put a disclaimer on the menu.\n\nThe two flaws above are pretty serious to me.  However, I would come back because it's ridiculously cheap and you probably can't go wrong ordering rolls.  I would not order anything particularly unusual though, nor do I think I would order nigiri again.  Definitely falls into the category of lightweight Americanized sushi vs. hardcore authentic sushi.", "author": "Riya K."}

Sushi Time is about as whitewashed as one can get.  Despite the name, it does nothing to scare away potential customers.  The restaurant is located in the downstairs of a mini-strip mall.  Tucked away in a quiet little corner, the restaurant probably seats somewhere in the range of 25 people including the sushi bar.  It's a nice little intimate joint.\n\nWe sat at the sushi bar and the chef was extremely friendly, talkative and wanted to make sure the customers were well taken care of.  As for the sushi it was excellent.  The menu featured different types of nigiri and fresh fish.  Sorry though no chicken teriyaki.  This place tries to stay as pure sushi as possible.  \n\nAs for the cost / taste ratio, this place passes with flying colors.  I had the mixed sahimi over rice and it was SUPERB!

Sushi time is a small place hidden in a small indoor mall away from the curbside. \n\nI liked the decor, it almost reminded me of the small sushi/ramen joints in Japan that I saw on the travel channel. The owner is a very friendly japanese man named Masa, and since I was the only one he and the sushi chef proceeded to strike up a conversation with me as i ate. It was a very pleasant dining experience overall.\n\nI got the Lunch special, Sushi Box C. It comes with a roll of your choice, and 5 pcs of chef's choice nigiri. I got the spicy hamachi roll which was nothing special, but the fish was fresh. My nigiri consisted of unagi, salmon, albacore, maguro, and hamachi. The slices were huge... and very fresh as well. The salmon and hamachi were especially delicious. The chef must have cut a piece close to the belly, because that hamachi melted in my mouth. Very decent rice to sushi ratio as well.\n\nIf you're in the area (castro) and you have a craving for sushi, this place is a very good choice. Overall it's affordable, and the quality of fish was good. If there was a tiny, very picky issue I would say the rice was a little too sticky.

Four of us tried to call Sushi Time before we arrive in case there is a long waiting list. Unfortunately, they don't do \"a list.\" Fortunately, there is no wait, so they say. \n\nThis was my first time there, and I would have never been able to find it on my own. Hidden in a mall-like building on Market street, neighboring a printing shop and some other random stores, it reminds me of Tokyo. \n\nRestaurant is tiny and seats only about 20 people. There were two 2-person tables and the sushi bar available, but we wanted to sit together at a table, so we opted to wait. There is a bookstore upstairs, which helped tremendously in killing time. \n\nWhen we came back after 20 minutes, none of the diners seemed to want to leave this cozy warm intimate joint, so we waited at the sushi bar and ordered some drinks. When you order hot sake, they pass you a basket full of little sake cups so you can pick your own! What a nice touch of detail! On top of that, their chopsticks come in a wooden container that are just adorable. \n\nI love restaurants that pay attention to details and aesthetics in general. \n\nThe food was great. As a starter, we ordered the San salad, which included 3 types of salad to sample. The seaweed, asparagus and tofu salad were all delicious with a strong taste and fragrance of sesame which I love. For sushi, we had hotate, aji, tai, and hamachi nigiri. They were all very fresh and buttery. We also had the Speed Racer rolls, with tuna and mango. And salmon skin rolls, which had burdock and shiso leaves. Both different from your traditional sushi, but with fresh ingredients and no crazy sauces (which I hate.) \n\nPrice is fair, and service friendly.

The sushi is good - I like that they place a dab of spicy sauce on top of the spicy tuna rolls instead of mixing it with the tuna.  That way you can still see the integrity of the fish.  The specialty rolls are also tasty because all the fish is pretty fresh.  The ebi gyoza was funky - kinda too sour and wet rag tasting.\n\nThe service was friendly enough, especially the guy making the sushi.  Maybe it's because the place is so small, poorly lit, relatively empty, and it was cold and rainy outside, but it made me uncomfortable when the staff would laugh behind the curtain and chatter on in Japanese.  It didn't help that the server handed me a glass of lemony water, and immediately switched it out with another glass after I had a chug.  Maybe that's a Japanese thing, but I doubt it.\n\nThe restaurant itself is eclectically decorated with fans, masks, and scrolls.  The music was a bit weird.  During happy hour, it was all Disney songs recreated through whistling, claps, yowling, and other indiscernible sounds.  When happy hour neared its end, the music changed to pop/techno with voice accompaniment.\n\nBTW: There is a $20 minimum credit card charge, and a $7 minimum per person.  So bring cash if you're dining alone and just ducking in for a snack.", "author": "Vicente G."}

When you walk in you feel as if you were transported to Tokyo just for this. So many varieties of sake and tea. The fish is SO fresh, Tai carpaccio is my favorite (HIGHLY RECOMMEND) , with the shrimp gyoza coming in second. They have such a variety of fish that it makes for a unique and fun experience when choosing rolls. I go for my normal salmon sashimi, spicy tuna, hamachi and usually get a more fancy roll to go with it also. It IS small, so if you're not into the kind of place where you can make friends with the (nicest) sushi chef and have a few drinks with him, then this isn't for you.  Another great thing about this place  is if it's packed, they'll give you a time frame and you leave your number and can have a drink at the near-by bar or just hang out (if you don't drink or feel like it) while you wait. Lastly, they have great miso soup. We've taken a few friends from out of town (LA) and they were more than impressed.

We ordered the barbie roll (I love how San Francisco understands the importance of thin lemon when you are eating salmon..), a california roll topped with eel and avocado with a drizzle of eel sauce, and a 2 piece albacore sushi. The eel was delicious but this roll in particular had a bit much rice for my liking - the bottom of the pieces were very dense making it a bit gummy. The albacore was melt in your mouth - it was literally just falling away from itself kind of tender. The service was mediocre but there was only one person running the tables and such but it sucks to sit and watch your sushi just waiting for someone to whisk it away at the bar (yet another reason I hate sitting at tables at sushi restaurants).

We got a table because it was our first time and we were just going to get a couple of rolls to taste (I typically like to sit at the bar). The very first thing I noticed about the bar was that it is no high concept piece of art like the other sushi bars I'd been to in San Francisco. This was mainly traditional sushi with the addition of a select few specialty rolls. Well, I'm a sucker for mixing, so I went for the special rolls. They were absolutely fantastic, especially one topped with Albacore, which literally melted in my mouth. I knew I needed to eat more, so I get a two piece Albacore sushi, which proceded to also melt in my mouth. I had not had tuna the likes of melt since Enshino back in Encino, and I knew then and there that I really could get accustomed to this place.

(and may i recommend, if you cannot make it to aburiya kinnosuke in new york, that izakaya with the raw chicken in berkeley as a replacement.)\n\nthis was pretty harsh, since i'm totally planning on going to sushi time again, i just want to temper your expectations over what's been shown here.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Came here last night with a friend (read, ex) to talk about some future business stuff we had to work out. The place was a little hard to find. You have to go into a little strip mallesque thing, go down a flight of stairs, look for the sign and you're there. The place is small but we were able to be seated right away. If you go here I highly recommend the Tai Carpaccio, it was hands down excellent. We ordered a number of different rolls including the Bochi roll, Barbie roll and I think one other. The Barbie roll was really good, the Bochi wasn't really my style. Neither of them out shined the Carpaccio though. The best part of this place had to be the prices I think we ordered three different kinds of rolls (2 of them specialties) the Carpaccio, and drinks for two with it only coming out to 55 bucks with tax and tip. They also gave us free edamame! \n\nService was really good as well. The guy always made sure our water was full and that we were taken care of. He saw my friend put her jacket on and pretty much immediately came over and asked if she was to cold and would like the door closed. \n\nDon't know if this place would be so great for a large group but for 2 or 3 people I'd put this place pretty high on the list of sushi joints in the city.", "author": "Tommy P."}

The 6 pc. sashimi plate ($9.95)  had 2 pieces of tuna, 2 yellow tail, and 2 salmon - and my goodness was it good.  Next time, I would go for the 10 piece plate because I wouldn't be able to get enough of this stuff.\n\nThere was 3 of us, so we decided to also get an order of edamame and 6 rolls to split among us.  The following is a list of rolls we got, starting with the most delicious:\n\nAstro Boy Roll\nRainbow Roll \nCrunchy Roll\nGI Joe Roll\nBincho Roll\nSpicy Yellow Tail Roll\n\nAll were so delicious, but the Astro Boy with yellow tail and mango definitely wins the award.  It was such a great combo of flavors.\n\nRolls were $4-$10.  The Rainbow was the most expensive.  But even the fun rolls like the Astro Boy or GI Joe were $7-8.\n\nAfter 2 appetizers and 6 rolls (total around $60) among the three of us, we were all at a \"good full\" - not overly stuffed, but at a good full.  This is probably because most of the rolls we got were smaller than the average roll you would find anywhere else.\n\nThe service is great.  The music was fabulous the night we went (funky/loungy covers of pop songs from the 80's and 90's).  The food came out at a decent speed.\n\nI went on a Tuesday night at 8 p.m. and although the place is tiny (only about 6-8 small tables to sit at plus the bar) it still wasn't crowded.

Our waitress wasn't the friendliest, and didn't bring the glass of water I asked for - just the glass - ???. So don't bother okay?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-03-30", "description": "I used to live in the Castro and this was my regular solo sushi place. It has since become the destination for the sushi-madness moods that strike my beau and I on a regular basis. The fish is fresh and delish, the prices are stupid reasonable, the service is friendly and the place itself is cozy and comfortable. \n\nIn the transportive space you feel like you could be in Tokyo (or Paris for that matter) as easily as you could be in San Francisco. It's a hidden little joint tucked underneath Books Inc. and a vitamin store. Once inside, you'll find a narrow, dim room with about six tables for two and a low sushi bar that seats about eight. Despite its size and popularity, it's never too crowded to get a seat and even when it's full, it's never too loud. \n\nThe two servers who are invariably there are both very friendly and efficient. Often, when sitting at the bar, one of the two sushi chefs will take your order directly, while the servers keep you up to your ears in sake and Asahi and tea. If you're one who likes super elaborate, crazy maki rolls with jalapenos and grapes stuck in them, you'll be disappointed with the selections at Sushi Time. It's a back-to-basics kind of place and all of the maki is made with very little more than fish, rice, nori and green onion, occasionally with a spicy sauce for the \"spicy\" rolls. They do have a rarely changing specials list that includes the Speed Racer roll which is your basic tuna roll with some mango and spicy sauce---super yummy, but not over-the-top creative. The tai carpaccio, also on the specials list is difficult to eat, but once it's in your mouth, it's heavenly. \n\nBasically, this place is about the fish, and if you're not into actually tasting the fish in your sushi, you'll be better off with the maki menu at Blowfish or Tsunami (one of these places is not overrated. I'll give you two guesses as to which one. Hint: it's not Blowfish). I can never get enough of the sake nigiri at Sushi Time. I think they get their salmon straight from heaven. \n\nAnd when the bill comes, prepare to put your eyes back in your head when you see that your two Asahis, two large sakes and a gut-splitting amount of fine fish cost...$45. \n\nDude, that's practically free in this town.", "author": "Sage R."}

Everything, and I mean everything we ordered was delicious! We chose: Spicy tuna roll, astro boy roll, boiled asparagus roll, a new sort of Alaskan roll, I can't remember the 5th roll, but we also had seaweed salad, edemame and a delicious pot of apricot green tea.

It is super cute and tasty and the people that work there are really nice. There was a chef there for awhile that kinda stared creepily but I haven't seen him there recently, and it didn't stop me from going there for the good food anyway. I usually order miso soup and a barbie roll. Beyond that it depends on the company and my mood/appetite. Beware tho, it is not good for anything resembling a private conversation.

After a supersecret conversation with the manager the waitress told me it was going to be extra in a manner that suggested I wasnt gonna want it now.  SO I said, \"sure just charge me for it\".  At this she went back to the manager and told him and he came over and told me there wasnt enough for anything but those dishes.  He clearly thought that the threat of an extra charge would \"scare me straight\".   Fucking hogwash.  Terrrilbe customer relations.  Plus there is a 10 dollar minimum per person.

The names of the special rolls are fun and they don't have the tally sheets for ordering sushi at the bar so it's more open to converse with the chef, which makes for a friendlier environment.  First place I've seen rolls with mango incorporated.  The cutesy details make this place special.

When we were finally able to locate the place, we entered and were greeted by a kind Japanese man.  He told use that that the last table was currently reserved for three people but then he kindly informed us that if we would wait just 10 minutes, a table should be ready.  So after about five minutes, the waiter showed us our table and we were seated.\n\nThe decor around the small restaurant gave the place a really cultural and traditional feeling.  The paintings of samurais behind the chefs, the japanese dolls that were placed on the shelves, the pictures of japanese families, everything was pretty interesting to look at.  The restaurant was fairly compact and it kinda feels like you're sitting in an underground greenhouse without the plants.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered the goma miso soup, uni nigiri, barbie roll, maruko zuke sashimi, astro boy roll, speed racer roll, and the hello kitty roll.  \n\nThe miso soup was the best I've had so far.  As for the rolls, all the rolls were nicely displayed and each had something very distinct about them.  For the barbie roll, each piece of sushi had a small piece of lemon on top which the made the roll taste very fresh and provided a unique after taste.  The hello kitty roll was delicious.  The fresh fish eggs that just pop in your mouth and the fish that just melts in your mouth makes this a very surprising dish despite it's name.  The red snapper from the maruko zuke sashimi was very tender and fresh.  The unagi in the astro boy roll, topped with the spicy mayo and avocado, was a great combo of flavor that just melted in my mouth.  The tuna in the speed racer roll was just succulent and I can still taste the unique texture of it within my mouth.  Lastly, the most surprising dish in my opinion was the uni nigiri.  This was the first time my date and I had tried sea urchin.  The sea urchin was coated with a creamy sauce, which my date considered to taste like the \"entire ocean\".  I don't think I felt that splash of flavor but I have to admit that the flavor was completely unique (in a good way) and something that I could not compare the taste to.\n\nI would definitely go here again, probably with a different date.

A sandwich-board sign on Market Street points the way down a hallway, down a set of steps, and through a pair of red curtains.

Walking away in frustration, our eyes caught a discreet small sign that says Sushi Time Fresh Sushi leading to a little alley full of flourescent lights. It looked very bland and unassuming but so hungry were we that we just plowed on, desperate, to see if we could find this Sushi Time. Boy did we ever! Tucked away at the end is the damnedest cutest charming down-to-earth-but-rocking little Japanese joint I've seen in SF. They even brought the checks in cute little Japanese ornate boxes which is a very classy way of business transactions in restaurants. The atmosphere and the service was excellent. The guy behind the sushi counter was working furiously but with great humor. Our waiter was very considerate and put us at ease. I can tell this is a local gem because the waiter, there is only one, asked us how we found this place so he knew we weren't locals. He was surprised we found this place quite by accident and what a great accident it was. The sushi was FRESH and SUCCULENT and the portions were very proper and filling. The prices were quite reasonable too. They served honest-to-God decent green tea the way it should be and the interior was just so authentic and genuine. There were a good number of locals and a good number of serious Japanese customers chatting away in their native tongue. We had a Blonde Roll special that knocked the socks off of us. I can't say enough good things about this place and no it's not because we were starving out of our minds after being kicked out by one other restaurant though that didn't hurt.

Otherwise, great food.", "author": "regina k."}

Everything tasted fine, only the sweet shrimp had a slight fishy smell. Service was good as well.  Hmm, I guess my gripe is mostly that I went in expecting a 4.5 star experience from a secret sushi spot in SF and I simply got a decent experience. I suppose I was expecting there to be Toro, fresh wasabi on request, real crab in a crab roll or california roll or something out of the ordinary for people to pass it a 5 star rating. I would say that the yellow tail sushi was very good but overall not the fantastic experience I was hoping for.", "author": "Michael G."}

They don't use too much rice on the nigiri or the rolls. The miso is perfect. And it feels just like any sushi joint in Tokyo: intimate and literally underground. The only draw back is that you're sitting practically on top of your neighbors, but then again, that keeps it quiet and cozy.", "author": "Aimee S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-11", "description": "This is a great restaurant. It's very small and tight, but it was warm (thermally-speaking) and dry on a cold we evening. I had the sashimi plate, and the fish was very, very fresh. The unagi/avocado/tempura roll was acceptable but unremarkable. Just a warning. Be prepared for a very cramped (but friendly) space. I sat at the bar and heard every word of the conversation of the first-date couple next to me, including how butch/fem they thought each other was, what Listz piano pieces they were each working on, why one of them needed a personal shopper, why one of them believed in lists but not new year's resolutions, whom one of them slept with when drunk last, how one of them thought the other's use of the phrase \"can't walk and chew gum at the same time\" was absolutely brilliant, why one was fem because he didn't like gyms, you get the drift; there's NO escape from your neighbors' conversation.", "author": "Ice Cream Truck I."}
