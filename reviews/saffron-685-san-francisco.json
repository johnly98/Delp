At lunch, you're supposed to pick up your own utensils and food at the front counter.\n\nWe started with the fries and baba ganoush. The sauce for the fries and the flavor of the baba ganoush was amazing. They kept bringing over more bread for the dips when we would run out which was great.\n\nI ordered the chicken kebab plate for my entree. I was amazed how how large the plate was for $12.00. The chicken was juicy and the flavor/marinade was amazing. My plate came with a side of rice, hummus, salad, and lavash bread. My rice had some marinade/sauce on it which was delicious and tarte. The hummus was also super flavorful and one of my favorites that I've ever had. The plate is actually very versatile. You can make a wrap using the lavash, you can have chicken and rice, chicken and salad, or just chicken on its own. I ended up having leftovers and took the rest home.\n\nOverall, service and food was great! You definitely get a lot of bang for your buck. Parking was also easy to find. We found parking right in the front and since we came for dinner, parking was free! Score! The only thing missing in this with all the decor might be some hookah, haha.", "author": "Love K."}

We both have other homes. His is right next to a busy street that has Sunday farmer's market and often filled ethnic eats and Asian shoppers, the real Chinatown as they would call it, and I'm in a similar situation but a different neighborhood, and on occasion we would meet up in this neighborhood. Saffron is a nice little neighborhood restaurant that served non threatening middle eastern, mediterranean food. \n\nFor lunch we would order a wrap, and a shawarma salad. He had a side yogurt dip which I thought I could have made for him, and perhaps even better but he was happy with the restaurant version. It was a sunny early afternoon. I have known him for longer than most and there was that sense of comfort you get from knowing someone so long and so many secrets that are no longer so, that you can just sit and eat and chat about nothing. I don't have many friends, and more importantly, I don't have a lot of time. It's important to choose who you dine with carefully when you don't have much of those things, and I think where to dine makes a difference. This is a quiet, conversation facilitation friendly place nestled between a Michelin (Omakase) and a Michelin wanna be (Khai). I have been to both, and felt this little diner seems to outperform its fancier neighbors in its solid food offerings and better restaurant ambience. \n\nI recently ordered a take out from here again. I called the restaurant and they had prepared the food and then called the delivery service to make sure that my food got delivered on time. They were very pleasant on the phone and greeted me by my name. It could serve as a good alternative for home cooking. I will be back.", "author": "Victoria E."}

One of the entrees we ordered was the chicken kebab. When it arrived I stabbed a fork in a piece of chicken and the fork pierced the meat with the same feeling it pierces raw chicken. I then cut it and the knife tore thru the meat. It didn't look raw, tho, so I asked my girlfriend what she thought. She cut another and it was clearly raw, so we brought it up with the staff member (just one person there). He begrudgingly agreed to remake it, hardly caring about us showing him raw chicken. This was honestly the first time I've sent food back (I get way too nervous).\n\n15 min later he brought out another plate and clarified that it is breast meat. It felt like he was saying that's why it has that texture. Once again, my fork went thru it with the same feel. We inspected and couldn't find any evidence of rawness. I ate one piece, but I couldn't eat anymore. The texture was too much for me. The rest of the food was fine, but that hardly makes up for it. He didn't ask how the new plate was or show any care for our experience (no other comments, no comping of anything, etc).", "author": "Nathan C."}

The lamb kebab plate was excellent. \n\nI can't say much about the Moroccan spiced hot chocolate, because I didn't feel comfortable drinking it. I used UberEats, and when it arrived there was a good 2 inches between the drink and the lid. Did it spill in the car on the way over? Was the driver drinking it? Was it a medium drink in a large cup? Given that there was no saran wrap between the drink and the lid, and no tape over the lid spout, I decided to just not drink it. \n\nWhen I called the restaurant the nice person who answered (a few minutes after closing time actually) explained that the hot cocoa has a foamy top, and they fill it all the way, and that it is expected to go down by the time the delivery happens. Also, there's normally a piece of tape on the lid, but they were particularly busy and it's possible that it didn't get on there. \n\nThis did ease my mind a bit, but still 2+ inches seems like a lot.

The location is okay, albeit a difficult to find and kind of off the beaten track. The interior is nice and spacious. There was no one in when I came. \n\nI wanted to get the salmon kebab, but at $17, I didn't think I wanted to spend that amount and get annoyed if it wasn't good. I chose to go with the meza sampler instead, opting for falafel, hummus, and dolma. The hummus is probably some of the best I've had in the city (for some\nreason, this city can't get hummus right!!). The falafel was cooked to perfection and the tahini sauce really hit the spot. The dolmas were also delicious.\n\nOf course, I couldn't resist the homemade baklava. SO.DELISH. Nice, flaky, and soft in all the right places.\n\nSome reviews indicated that customer service was lacking, however I feel that a part of this is cultural. With that said, I didn't find the lone employee to be rude in the least bit, but that could be left up to interpretation.\n\nPros:\n-good hummus\n-nice selection of options\n-homemade baklava (enough said)\n\nCons:\n-a bit inconvenient to find (there's street parking and a closed garage, but otherwise it's a bit hard to find this place).\n-some items are a bit overpriced in my opinion", "author": "Tracy T."}

Some friends and I ended up here on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday .. not clear why we chose the place but whatever we were there and we were literally the only people there that night. Which is not surprising given that it's a Saturday and no one is working in SOMA that day--funny story when we left, we learned from our Uber driver that this was the only area without any surge pricing. anyways.. I digress\n\nThe service here was pretty subpar. We were a party of 10+ so perhaps we were too hectic or something to deal with? It took forever for someone to take our order and then only mid meal did they decide to offer us any water... and that entire process was such a fiasco. I guess to be fair there were only 2-3 employees there that night ... and 2-3 tables filled ... but okay whatever. Like I said it was a very mediocre experience.  \n\nFood itself was decent but nothing amazing. We got the hummus plates, lamb skewers, chicken skewers... jesus we ordered a million things but the fact that I can barely remember what I was eating is a testament to how mediocre I found the experience to be. I could see how this place might be better for a quick grab and go lunch kind of affair but if you try to sit down and have a relatively nicer dinner, it definitely backfires very quickly\n\ntldr; the food is a solid 3, the service is pretty bad though if you try to dine-in....price though is the bomb dot com lol literally spent $11/person even though we ordered 10 or so plates which was ridiculous", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Being in the restaurant business, I am concerned when I see this, and it calls into question what other responsible food practices aren't being followed. When I received the shawarma I was not that happy with its consistency. More importantly, after a few bites, I realized the meat was not hot, with some of it only at room temperature.

Lots of sesame seeds dominated the flavor. Would have preferred straight tahini to dip into; the mix with chopped veggies made it awkward to eat.\n\nOn to the lamb shawerma wrap. I saw the vertical rotisserie had ground meat in a pre-formed cone vs. fresh layers of thin strips of meat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-04-18", "description": "I tried to give this place a second chance because it's so close to my work and other yelp reviews seem to only rave, but it is beyond mediocre and ridiculously overpriced for the quality.\n\nIn full honesty, I've only ordered pick up for lunch, so it might be better dining in or at dinner, but the two times I've done it, food was cold and not that appetizing, service was lackluster, and the price was astronomical. You do get a lot of food, but $16 for a schawerma plate that tastes worse than what I get from a street cart is just ridiculous. The most recent time, they forgot part of my order and they weren't apologetic when I called and accused me of never ordering the missing items. Since I was ordering for a staff lunch, it was very embarrassing that they couldn't get my order right and that the restaurant tried to blame me for the snafu. Would not suggest for work events as their food apparently cools instantly and they are not willing to assist you when they get your order wrong. EDIT! Management was very upset that I said the food was cold. So let me rephrase, I guess it is served piping hot and then cools within the 10 minutes it takes me to get back to the office. Food cools very quickly :)\n\nIn terms of food, the only thing I liked here were the fries and baklava and everything else was below average. (They change up the sides a lot which means it's a crap-shoot if you'll get something you like or not). EDIT!: While they do switch up the sides, apparently you can request different salad sides to your plate. \n\nEDIT! Due to the cattiness of the management, I will not be back, especially because I am apparently banned from them now for being unhappy LOL. But I'm sure if you don't cross them or if you don't care about service, you'll have an ok time here. God forbid if they forget something in your order and you complain about that though, because that apparently was all my fault and I am not welcome there anymore. Good thing I didn't want to come back :)", "author": "Christina R."}

Their home cut fries are extremely yummy and always served fresh. Also comes with their tomato creamy house sauce.\n3. Lentil soup: very light and perfectly spiced\n4. Mediterranean plate: If you like dips, falafel and grape leaves this is the perfect combo (great to share an app between 2 people)\n5. And last but not least is their housemade dessert \"Kenafa\" ask the owner when they will have fresh in the week because it's not always available but so worht going there for.\n\nAnd finally what I also love about Saffron it's quiet atmosphere in the afternoon.

It looks like I'm not alone when I say the service is absolutely awful.  In fact that does not even begin to cover the issue here.  I have never written a completely negative review or even walked out of a restaurant in my life, but there was just no way I was going to eat that food after my experience. I feel that everyone should be spared spending their money at a business that is so clearly ignorant of providing common decency to its patrons.  \n\nI came in for \"happy hour\" and had the nerve to ask about what was included and was basically mocked for my simple question.  I ordered two dishes for myself and a beer.  (my order was taken after the man who came in 2 minutes behind me)  I was asked if I wanted to eat in or take out (odd because I had ordered a beer)  and I said I would stay and eat in.  I asked to pay with a card, but apparently I did not spend enough money so this was rejected.  Only having $6 cash I said I would have to forget the beer then and I would prefer to take out.  I was then informed I could not take out for happy hour.  So I left because every bit of this was conveyed with hostility.  \n\nIt's really a shame, I would have liked to have found a good Mediterranean place to frequent.  But I don't care how good your food is, I will not spend money where my business is so clearly not appreciated.  Too bad because I do not need you food, but judging by how empty the place was you need my business.", "author": "Christina P."}

After drooling all over the furniture at Room & Board I decide to grab some lunch.\n\nMany reviewers rate the service and the attitude of the guy pretty low. In my experience the guy barely made eye contact or acknowledged my existence but I wasn't looking for a connection or a date.  As for the service it's not the fastest but its not like the two people that work there are sitting around either.  They are busy cooking, cutting, and serving people.  If you are in a hurry don't go and especially don't order chicken as it takes longer to cook.\n\nRegardless, today I had one of the most fantastic tasting falafel sandwiches in my life. \n\nI've eaten at many Mediterranean places in my travels throughout the country.  Midwestern friends listen up as you will eat something so tasty and different than you ever experienced. The falafel is perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside which in my opinion enhances the flavor of the chick pea. Plus the sandwich is wrapped with lavish bread and spread with very fresh tahini and hummus. You will notice random pieces of eggplant, fried potatoes, onions and a little hot spice scattered throughout the huge wrap that make for great surprises in every bite.\n\nAlso the decor is modern and had a Room & Board feel. They even have floor sitting tables with cushions in the back which would make for a fun experience on a date.\n\nYes, I'd eat here again!

I ask her for the vinegar and she's about to get it for me when the manager or owner (some middle-eastern looking guy with a beanie) looks at her and gives her a little nod or something.

Their intense level of concentration meant nary a smile while I was in the queue wondering when they were going to ask for my order. Alas, a voice from the register beckoned, and the smiling hostess took it.\n\nI ordered the $11.50 Lamb Shawerma Plate, which was a pretty hefty portion of grilled lamb shards served up with a fresh thick pool of tahini sauce and fresh vegetables. It came with a tasty hummus and a bowl of marinated bean salad. The crispy lavash came in a large folded sheet that you tear up with some dexterity in order to scoop up the ingredients. My friend ordered the same thing but intriguingly, instead of the bean salad, she got a bowl of yogurt sauce. Neither of us knew why, but I chalk it up to rookie employees.\n\nTruth be told, I think their prices are a bit on the high side for what they serve, even though they are marginally more plush than say, Gyro King in Civic Center or Oasis Grill in FiDi.

Had to get up a few times to ask for water, and he wouldn't even fill my glass to the top.  Also, had some of my partners falafel sandwich, which was depressing.  the falafel was dry, and in two huge pieces, which threw off the proportion of the wrap.  we also ordered the mint lemonade, which was bitter, and had a bad aftertaste.  overall, just not very good food, or service.  \n\nAnyways, considering there are not much choices in the area, I imagine this place fills up for lunch during the week, but not because it has good food, probably because most of us only have a short lunch break.

I asked for enough food to feed 45 people and what was provided only fed 25 -30. They offer a kebab tray with 12 skewers at $85 and you would think that they would be pretty decent size skewers, but they were puny. It took 2 or 3  to actually fill you up. And when asking how many trays they recommended they said 4 (only to end up bringing us 3) which was insufficient and so expensive. When I called back to let them know there wasn't nearly enough food they wanted to charge me even more to bring another tray. This place is insanely over priced and really not that great. If you want a good restaurant for catering I highly recommend T-Dubbs. You'll definitely get enough bank for you buck and it SO delicious.\n\nWe will not be ordering from Saffron ever again.", "author": "Alli M."}

Saffron looked like it could be hopping with SOMA folk during lunchtime, but it was deserted for dinner. We did notice a few to go order being assembled so we weren't scared to try it. Plus yelpers had rated it high enough to worth a visit after our REI run. \n\nThe SO (significant other) ordered a shrimp kebab platter, I ate a chicken kebab sandwich, and an order of tzatziki between us. It's really hard to resist the yogurt sauces when eating Mediterranean food.  His was pretty tasty, mine was mediocre but had a nice spicy sauce, and the yogurt sauce was fabulous. The sauce did seem to be a bit overpriced but the quantity was much larger then we possibly could eat in one meal. \n\nThe interior is nice and clean with a variety of tables to sit at. High low, cushy, sturdy etc. \n\nI recommend  the mint lemonade!  Not sure how often this place will be frequented, but it's worth a shot if you're in the area.", "author": "Tina P."}

I guess these guys are reading yelp, because the owner spoke to me about my review.  In length and detail.  While I was with a external consultant on a business lunch.\n\nObviously I had a bad day, and was pretty upset when I wrote my review.  And obviously I upset the ownership here.  And I guess they were successful.  I am changing my review.  They have owned a business before.  And they are improving their service.  And they are reading Yelp, so I guess we have some power.\n\nBut you know what, I don't think I am ever going back there again.  The person I was there at lunch with couldn't believe I was spoken to like that.  I apologized several times.  And you know what, I am actually sorry.  But it still felt unprofessional to me.  And I am frankly afraid to return.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI don't believe the people who own this place have ever owned a restaurant before.  \n\nHow can I tell?\n\nWell, I was sitting here with some coworkers for quite awhile a few weeks ago, and we had a lot of time to analyze the place.  The service is slow, bordering on god-awful slow.  The food comes out in an obscure order that seems to favor eating in over taking out, which makes sense if you want a large group of take out people sitting around in your restaurant.  There seems to be too little space on the grill, and too much space between stations to be efficient.  Watch the guys at Truly Med on 16th & Valencia and then watch these guys and you'll see exactly what I mean.  The difference is, the people who own this place designed these stations themselves.\n\nThen there is the woman who works the counter, who I suspect may be the owner.  She has, dare I say, the oddest customer service of any owner operator I have dealt with.  She will tell every person who orders take out that the kebab's take 12 minutes and the falafel takes 6, pushing people to get the falafel.  The last time I made this choice, and got the falafel, it took at least 15 minutes, and someone who ordered after me got their kebab in 10.  Which pissed off everyone in our group, cause we had all come for kebab and left with falafel.\n\nThe only redeeming quality of the place is that the food is actually decent.  The veggie kebab is really tasty, and the falafel is, in fact, decent as well.  \n\nBut seriously, I would order ahead and avoid the anguish.", "author": "Steve S."}

I'm hesitant to give it more than three stars though because this place still has a few kinks to work out.\n\nFirst, what's good:  the food is very flavorful and it's great to have mediterranean cuisine in the neighborhood.  The falafel has a decent crunch.   The fried potato cakes are very tasty.  The falafel wrap is filled with a nice variety of ingredients and then it's briefly toasted on the outside, which I like a lot.  Customer service at the cash register has improved in tone since they first opened.\n\nNot so good:  as others have mentioned, prices are on the high side.  I understand they are in a brand new building and probably have high rent, but it does preclude me from eating here more often.  While, on the whole, I enjoy the falafel wrap, for some reason the little strips of eggplant they put in there had tough skins one time, which I had to pick out.  Finally, every time I go, there's something about the atmosphere that's not warm and welcoming.  Perhaps its the lack of natural light in the back.  Perhaps its the doors being always wide open.  Maybe if one or two of the staff was more conversant with the customers, that would do the trick.\n\nThis place has potential to be a really great lunch spot.

Coming from a country of immigrants with the largest Syrian-Lebanese community outside those two countries, more than 6 million and their direct descendants, I believe I have the knowledge to elaborate over the subject.\n \nI've tried their falafel sandwiches, shish kabob plates, humus, baba ghanoush, they are all delicious and above all the ingredients are always fresh. The shish kebob is served the way I like it - grilled with lemon in it, where I came from the Lebanese grill with lime - even better. But I've noticed lately the shish kebob plate is being served in smaller portions. I love the humus prepared there, they don't add garlic and you can actually taste it the way it's supposed to be not like other middle-eastern restaurants in the city where they add tons of it - a trick done to disguise the stale taste of days seating in the fridge. Usually I eat my hummus traditionally, soaked in olive oil, I always have to ask for it, they avoid serving that way because like salt you add at your own discretion. The baba ghanoush, my favorite, it's smoked to perfection with the right amount of tahini, I can eat a whole side order (fairly sized) with pita bread in one seat. The tabbouleh salad is really well balanced, I always judge on that, if they cannot get it right, mind as well shut down the business.  \n \nThe owner has been venturing lately into soups, I find them unnaptizing, they are too thick (puree style) to my taste. I think he is trying to cater to the American palate - they love porridge soups. Once I tried the red bell peper lentil soup, but the owner had stepped out for couple of hours and his staff served the soup luke warm - I was already skeptical, you can imagine my reaction.\n \nI noticed last time I was there (a week ago) they have torne down the menu from the wall, I asked why, and found out they are reformulating the entire menu. Let's wait and see what kind of delicacies will be coming out of their kitchen - I bet they will be tasty, the chef/owner is well versed in the kitchen.\n \nRegarding the individual menu, the lay-out needs improvement. All the dishes are crammed on one side of the menu with plenty of room on the other side just for beverage and dessert. Honestly, not even with reading glasses I could discerned the lines, and the poor choice of red ink made it worse to read.\n \nAs for the ambience, the place offer all sorts of seating and tables, my favorite are the lower tables and cushions in the back. It's probably the most clean restaurant in the city, you can eat off the floor, the owner always display with pride its 100 points SF Health Department gave to the establisment - it's been that way for years. They also have a good selection of ambient music playing at all times, jazz, blues, bossa-nova, never heard though classic and/or contemporary middle-eastern music - I wonder why ? \n\nI might be reviewing this venue again later to five star - it will depend what surprises in the future they will have fresh out of the oven.", "author": "Marcello C."}

I wanted to give more stars for the food (it was pretty good)--but the incredibly rude man behind the counter ruined the meal. \n\nWhen we walked in the place was pretty empty, which should have been a sign for us to head out the door. But I was in the mood for falafel and baba ganoush. Our food was ordered and we sat down with our 9 month old baby girl. \n\nShe promptly grabbed the nearby spoon and started banging on the table (a common behavior for babies this age). Before we could stop her, like good parents, the rude man  behind the counter came over, gave her a plastic fork (yes, a fork) and insisted she stop because she was going to wreck the table. Seriously?! \n\nAfter food came, we were eating and my boyfriend's water glass was empty. We very politely asked for more, and instead of pulling out the cold pitcher in the refrigerator where he got our first glasses, he took the glass and walked all the way over to the kitchen sink and filled it up with sink water. Now, it's not that I'm snobby about water, but the entire action of walking farther than the nearby pitcher to give him water from the sink seemed quite insulting. \n\nHe did not talk or acknowledge us--and spent pretty much the entire time trying to look busy. Absolutely ZERO (or if it's possible, negative one) for service. We felt like we were bothering him. \n\nI will not ever come back to Saffron 685 because of the poor customer service. There are many other places with Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food. If I'm going to go out and spend my money, I expect some general pleasantry and to feel like my business matters. \n\nPS: The falafel looked wonderful on the outside, but incredibly dry on the inside. The tziki had excellent flavor but the yogurt was thin and runny. Boyfriend said lamb shawarma was good sized and generally flavorful. Overall, typical dishes--neither really good or really bad. \n***********************************************************\nHi Nicole,\n \nziad t. has sent you a message on Yelp:\n \nSaffron 685\n \n\"Hi there, thanks for your honest opinion in writing about Saffron.\nI'd like to clear up a few things if I may.\nThe place was empty because we have an engagement party @ 5.00 PM, the place was booked for that, I got you in because I saw you coming back and forth and checking the menu outside.\nThe place is not designed for kids, the interior is more for parties and people coming on a dates.\nThe reason I did not give the gentleman water from the pitcher because I was just cleaned and refilled the pitcher beside when you were asked for a drink you said yourself that you wanted a tap water right?\nSorry you found the service bad and the food no good not really bad, however people say we have the best shawerma, the best kebab, the best fries, the best soups, top it up being great place for parties and very efficient service, check the web please, I'm neither lying nor bragging, people out the door here @ lunch time.\nSorry again for the hall trouble, bless your heart & prosper to you, the baby & gentleman\nYour server\"", "author": "Nicole H."}
