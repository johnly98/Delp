There was a good amount of meat in all of them. I liked that they gave us sides of salsa instead of putting it in the actual taco. That way, they didn't get soggy. The grilled chicken and beef tacos both had a good smokiness. The pork was tender. The salsa with the chips was a nice big portion. Though I did wish I could just order the side of salsa as I am not eating deep fried food right now. The chips ended up tossed as I just wanted a side of salsa. The guac was okay. I've had better, but it added a nice creaminess to the tacos.\n\nGreat place to grab some tacos. The rest of my coworkers also enjoyed their burritos and plates. Good hefty portions.

Why not him?  Should I have said something.  Plus, he was horrible at listening.

I've eaten at my fair share of Gordo's spots over the course of my adult life. Never been too blown away. Always thought their burritos were way too soupy. I have to say the 9th/Irving location has forever changed my mind. \n\nFirst of all, the super burrito was HUGE! Filled with so many delicious delights! Refried beans were totally on hit. They were light and everything you would expect from homemade refried beans. I loved the rice! Bright red color, a bit on the salty side, but, hey I like it! The Carnitas was crispy not fatty. SO GOOD!\n\nOnly thing I would suggest adding is lettuce and tomato to your menu.

This review is specifically for the shop on 9th avenue and not Gordo as a whole.\n\nWhat's great:\n\nTheir meats (and burritos in general). All the meats are tasty.  The chicken is particularly tender.  The carnitas could be crispier, but still have good flavor. It's a tasty burrito all around though. \n\nTheir simplicity. There aren't many choices. Regular has meat, beans, rice, and salsa on a smaller (but not that small) tortilla. Super is the same except add cheese and bigger tortilla.  You can get the same in a \"plate\" version. Add things like sour cream if you want.\n\nReasonable prices and decent sized burritos (not the GIANT ones that some places do, but on the generous side)\n\nWhat's not as great:\n\nThe layout of the 9th street store is weird. Where you are supposed to line up to order is unclear and the line does a U shape which is strange. Also, only one person stands at the counter at once which seems inefficient - and a staple of burritos is efficiency.  \n\nYou have to buy chips and salsa. Yep. It's a problem.\n\nSour cream and Guacamole are never included - which is ok - but makes the listed price deceptively cheap (cause really - who doesn't get guacamole and sour cream?).", "author": "Sarah C."}

I have to say, even after coming here for ten years, Gordo has stayed constant with its great prices, decent portion sizes, and overall flavor. \n\nMy recommendation is to go for the super burrito (but the quesadilla is also killer). In it, you get cheese, rice, beans, your choice of meat, and definitely get the hot sauce and salsa. And it's only $7.50. The burrito itself is delicious and wet, and I man literally wet, because I drown my burritos in sauce and salsa. Unfortunately, guacamole and sour cream are extra if that's your thing, and there's no open salsa bar. \n\nSo overall, awesome burrito for the price.

I've been coming here since I was a kid and it is some of the best Mexican food in the city, or at least in my neighborhood. However, I had the worst experience here last Sunday evening. The line was really long but as usual, I waited anyway because I'm used to the line moving along relatively fast. The usual workers here know what they're doing. \n\nWell, this time, I waited for about an hour because it took literally 5-10 minutes per person ordering. There were 3 unfamiliar faces working that night: one guy making orders (he was going so slow and seriously had no idea what he was doing), a kid (maybe 12 years old) working in the back, and a teenager working the register. Actually, there was a 4th guy but I think he was on his 10-minute break the whole time I was there, just lying with his head down at one of the tables. I saw at least 5 customers leave the line because the wait was so ridiculously long. It was nearly silent inside because the guy making burritos was moving so slowly and the place was so understaffed. The dude also messed up a bunch of orders ahead of me. At one point, I saw him plop a bunch of refried beans onto someone's tortilla with such force that the beans got everywhere.

It was a 10in flour tortilla. With half a piece of mozzarella cheese... The chicken regardless was flavorless as well as the hot sauce . You couldn't taste the cheese (there was only half a slice added). Once I paid $10.00 he gave me my quesadilla. I proceeded to sit down & enjoy . The moment i unwrapped it out of its two layers of tin foil. Was the moment I realized it was going to be a disaster. Anyways it was wrapped as if it was a burrito instantly went in for a bite and about 1/4 cup of chicken broth dripped onto the foil. At this point it was still dripping down and I thought I would hold it up so it can continue. At this time I've eaten about four bites trying to give it a chance. It was completely soggy and falling apart. * still dripping broth* I asked for a new quesadilla with no broth and more cheese added & they responded with 'you have to pay for a new one ' .

It took my friends and I 15 minutes to find parking nearby and was about a 5 minute walk to the taqueria. \n\nSETTING: A dinky little taqueria that doesn't have anything too fancy about it. \n\nSERVICE: Not much customer-server interaction as with any other taco joint. Service could be better. The servers are a little unenthusiastic and it's hard to communicate with them because it's so loud inside. \n\nFOOD: I ended up getting a carne asada taco ($2.75) in a corn tortilla shell with additional toppings including salsa, cilantro, beans, cheese, and sour cream. They charge extra for toppings. It totaled up to about $4.60, which I found ridiculous for such a mediocre taco especially on Taco Tuesday. I expected to get shredded cheese but they just gave me a slice of cheese like what?? I found the taco extremely difficult to eat because my taco fell apart the instant I tried eating it. I just ate it with a fork and knife in the end. The taco was very soggy. There was nothing too special about the carne asada except that it was extremely salty, and didn't amaze me. My taco cravings were not satisfied. \n\nThis place doesn't have any taco tuesday discounts so I don't recommend coming here if you're lookin for some cheap eats. It also doesn't offer free chips and salsa, which I find at other locations.

Maybe in terms of price, things are reasonable (about $7 for a super burrito, without avocado or sour cream....but who doesn't get those...). However, in terms of flavor, Gordo is kind of lacking. The mexican rice tastes incredibly bland (not like Mexican rice, but more like rice that had a tiny spoonful of Mexican seasoning in it), the beans are flavorless (Chipotle has more flavorful beans), and the carnitas that I got were not crispy nor salty, and weren't a great complement to the rice, cheese, and beans. I don't like sour cream, so I didn't get it; the guac portions are tiny (three slaps of a tiny rectangular spatula) and kind of disappear into the burrito. All in all, the price is cheap, but the value isn't great.\n\n...especially when the person who made my burrito didn't wash his hands OR use gloves. Additionally, while waiting for my tortilla to heat, he chopped my carnitas...on the dirty countertop (as opposed to the cutting board where he prepares the tortilla). Same guy as everyone else has been getting - a dude wearing an Oakland A's hat who doesn't gel socially well with you.

From one visit to the next, you can have life changing carnitas, or find yourself tossing an inedible burrito or taco into the trash after a bite or two.  It pains me to write these words.  Like so many SF locals, Gordo's was a major food group growing up here.  In fact, Gordo's was so special that two Bay Area natives actually attempted to make an exact replica in New York to satisfy their craving (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/dining/reviews/06unde.html).  Now, Gordo's former magic is all but gone.  The previously perfectly-crisp-yet-chewy-on-the-inside carnitas that exploded with flavor and spice is now just salty and overcooked, unless it's soggy and flavorless.  The O.G. Gordo's with the friendly Giants-loving burritistas and four-item menu, now slaps together a saut\u00e9ed \"veggie medley\" on spinach \"wraps\" with the care and enthusiasm of a high school cafeteria.  On my last visit (probably literally my last visit), I had to toss a carnitas quesadilla that was wrapped in soggy dough soaked all the way through with uncooked vegetable oil.  Couldn't even touch it let alone muster a bite.  Gordo's has all the key ingredients to mount a comeback--it just needs ownership that actually wants to live up to its once-storied reputation.", "author": "Ronald C."}

Don't ask me why, because I can't really explain. Fall is steak, Winter is carnitas, Spring is grilled chicken, and Summer is whatever my hangover feels like on that given day.

I ask if I can please have chips and salsa, plus a water. He looks super annoyed because now he has to ring it up again. Whatever. He grabs me everything and I pay him. My burrito, chips, salsa, and drink are still on the table. I ask him if I can get a bag. He rolls his eyes, sighs, and tells me that it will be $0.10. What planet am I on? It's only $0.10, that is not why I am complaining. It's the fact that they charge for a brown paper bag and the attitude I was getting for simply asking for one.

I was SO disappointed and offended by my experience here. \n\nThe food was alright, not really memorable. \n\nMy discomfort (and poor review) came from the workers, who completely lack good customer service. I've worked in a couple restaurants before and I acknowledge that it can be tough at times.

I was so annoyed by that, but hat's not even the bad part.\n\nI'm Mexican, and a fluent Spanish speaker. Unfortunately, I was able to understand that the employees were just throwing vulgar words left and right. I didn't even feel like I was in a restaurant at this point. As customers, we shouldn't have to listen to that type of language when having lunch. It's beyond inappropriate and rude. It created a very uncomfortable environment for my friends and I.  \n\nWe partly ate our food, and we were finishing up our drinks, catching up with some good conversation. Then my sister and I overheard one of the workers say in Spanish, \"they haven't left, they're just taking their time talking and laughing\", and then they all laughed about it.    \n\nUh...EXCUSE ME!?\nSince when is it wrong to sit down with your friends, catch up, and try to have a good time? I was so infuriated. I would have been more understanding if we had been causing a riot and being really loud, but it was nothing like that.

Too bad because good Mexican food is so hard to find out here on the avenues. Wish I could get a great burrito without the trek to the mission. \n\nI have a couple issues with the burritos at Gordo. First, they are never tightly wrapped so the thing falls apart halfway through and spills out. Ideally a burrito should be just the right width and very tightly wrapped so you can eat the whole thing without it caving until you get down to the nub. My second problem with the burritos is the texture - they always seem too wet. I think they don't properly drain the beans so that you get too much moisture in the burrito. The quality of the meat is pretty good. I think their carnitas is nicely cooked, expect for a few burnt dried pieces that can make their way in. Their steak is just ok - I like it more finely chopped than they do it here and the flavor leaves something to be desired. My last complaint is about the rice - for some reason I just don't like the way it tastes - it's almost under-seasoned. Hard to put my finger on it.

The less mariachi music I hear and the fewer sombreros on the wall, the better the food usually is. \n\nAnd that holds true with Gordo's, my favorite burrito in the Sunset or the Richmond. All the budget that normally goes into the decor got reallocated to the meat, where it belongs! Get the 'all meat' burrito after a run through Golden Gate Park if you want to know what protein heaven tastes like. \n\nChips and salsa are extra, but chips might be worth it when the burrito eventually self-destructs in your hands and now you have taco salad. There's a small beer selection and a soda fountain, and good on them for having a community bulletin board, but you don't care about that.

This was a typical lunch for me during my high school days, and I can't think about growing up in San Francisco without Gordo's, my all time favorite taqueria. My friends and I took the bus until were old enough to drive ourselves there, where we would chat over our jam packed burritos and sweet horchata. \n\nGordo's supreme burrito crafters know their stuff. With their agile hands they effortlessly handle the hot tortilla and ladle perfect scoops of meat (and some meat juice), topping off the mountain of food with slathers of guacamole and whatever you like. Ask them for some sliced avocado if you're feeling up to it, and please don't forget the extra splash of hot salsa. The finished product is always massive, and be ready to be at least one pound heavier--10 times happier--after consumption. \n\nI've read some reviews about the burritos being bland, but to me, the intermingling of flavors is just right. Stick to what they do best; the grilled meats and carnitas are mouthwatering, and the \"super\" option ensures that you have it all. There's nothing more subjective than one's burrito preference, so I suggest taking a taste for yourself if you haven't yet.

However, one nice thing about getting old is that you've learned what's good and what's not as good.  Or I would hope at least.\n\nSo with that, I start to wonder about Gordo's - have I just found more places that I like better, or have they really started to slip a bit?  I haven't been here in a while, and ended up picking up some food to split with the fam.  Ordered the Carne Asada Super Burrito, a Carnitas Taco, and a side of Chips and Salsa.  The value still works for them, as all of that only cost about $10 or so pre-tax, so kudos to them for staying budget friendly.\n\nThe Carne Asada super burrito is still about the same - plenty of rice and beans, good helping of meat, and I had some guacamole thrown in there as well.  Definitely consistency there as it still tastes like the first one I ever bought.  However, have their carnitas always been this greasy?  The taco was just dripping with oil.  It tasted good, but still...so much oil.\n\nAlso, maybe it was just a bad batch, but their salsa was just sad.  It tasted so watered down, with the only distinct flavor being cilantro...AND I HATE CILANTRO.  As in, I abhor the damn thing.  So you can imagine how a (small) part of me just died with that first and only bite of salsa.  It's not so bad if it's just a trace in the background, but not when it's the only flavor.

Is there a cruel joke behind this Gordo Taqueria aimed at me?  Do they secretly know my weakness for burritos and mock me for it?  \n\nI was told Gordo's carnitas are their highlight.  So that's what I ordered, a carnitas super burrito with black beans and a chicken burrito with pinto beans for Bun.  At around ten bucks, you get generous portions of everything.  From the rice and beans to the meat laced with guacamole and salsa, each bite was filled with every ingredient in the burrito.\n\nThe carnitas were on point of expectation, but only tipped barely over delicious scale.  After sampling a bite of the chicken, I found it on the salty side.  Compared between the two, the carnitas were definitely better.  I'll have to try out their other meats with a special curiosity for the chili verde.\n\nThe obvious reason to come here is for a decently made burrito in mere seconds.  At five bucks you can have enough for lunch and dinner at an affordable price.  My personal preference still leans toward El Burrito Express on Taravel with a better tasting burrito and at around the same price.", "author": "Arnold T."}

The facade is almost all window, which lets the occasional Inner-Sunset District sunshine pour into the space, Ceiling fans keep the room from getting stuffy. \n\nI offered a gentleman at the counter a cheery, good afternoon greeting which was met with cold, indifferent silence. I placed my order, which he immediately repeated, getting one of the ingredients I mentioned incorrect. My poor treatment was continued by the cashier, who upon seeing me at the front of the line immediately helped someone else. I got my food and took a seat at a table littered with crumbs from the previous guest only to discover that my Jarritos non-twist off cap was left in place. A return trip to the counter and my cap was removed. \n\nBy now I was regretting my decision to eat here but with food in hand I figured, why not, and proceeded to bit into my chicken burrito. Imagine my astonishment when I realized it was surprisingly good. The chicken was flavorful, moist and evenly distributed. As I ate I looked up periodically at the counter which was peopled by a vast, steady array of neighborhood types including a cop, a guy decked out in Giants gear, two moms with babies, an old couple and several students grabbing a quick bite between glances at massive textbooks. I'll say one thing for this place, it sure is where the melting pot melts.\n\nI know many neighborhood places are austere and run on a tight budget. This one appears to be among them and I'm fine with that. However, there is no place for curt behavior on the part of the staff. If I were the owner I'd attempt to give these gentlemen some customer service training, or at the least, teach them the magic words of please and thank you.

The meat options are pretty standard, but the size is pretty large. The burrito was good, but a little messy due to the very loose wrapping job they do. I like it when they stretch the hell out of that tortilla and make a tight cylinder out of that burrito. The grilled chicken was good, and the balance of beans, rice, meat, and sauces weren't out of whack. \n\nSo a few gripes. I asked for black beans and boiled chicken. He gave me grilled chicken (which I was ok with), and was going to put in pinto beans if I hadn't caught him. Dude, I just told you my order like 3 seconds ago.

I'm normally not a tomatillo person, but as pico was my only other choice on salsa, tomatillo it was.\n\nOverall, I prefer La Fonda or L'Avenida for Mexican food in the Sunset due to their larger menu, better selection of meats, and the fact that they actually have a choice of salsa as compared to Gordo's effectively nonexistent selection. And while I do like the cheap prices at Gordo's, you get what you pay for in a 10\" tortilla rather than the 12\" that is my standard fare. \n\nI'll purposefully not compare Gordo's to Mexican outside the Sunset as I think it's basically pointless to do so there aren't so many people coming to the Sunset specifically for the Mexican food, instead if you live here, it's like I said, quick, cheap, and pretty good.", "author": "Chris S."}

Ask for extra cilantro. They have a mound of freshly chopped cilantro in the cooler and will pile it on upon request. \n3. Extra cheese. Always. They have the best cheese and it is melted right onto the tortilla to latch onto all the rice and beans...mmmm... \n4. If your calories are not an obstacle than go with the quesadilla.

My order normally consists of a Super Quesadilla with grilled chicken, rice, tomatoes, sour cream, and extra extra extra hot sauce. Trust me, the extra extra extra hot sauce (green sauce) makes everything taste 10X better than how it originally taste. Not saying it's bad without it though, it's just a whole lot better.\n\nTheir quesadilla is made with a flour tortilla with a slice of cheese in it. They then place it on the grill allowing the cheese to melt onto the tortilla, which makes it taste a lot better in my opinion. The tortilla is also then a bit crispy which is an added plus.\n\nQuick Service and great food, what much more can you ask for ? I've been a fan of this place and still am.\n\nWhy no 5 stars? It's because of all the times I go there, they always charge me different prices. It seems to me that they like to sneak in extra charges. For example: today I noticed they charged me an extra 65 cents for guacamole when I never got any. I would've said something but I figure since I'm a long time customer, I wouldn't mind letting them keep the extra change.\n\nOverall, try this place out. Lots of seating inside, but parking may be hard. My order of Super quesadilla normally costs me around 6-7 dollars.

The burrito was big, but the carne asada pieces were a little small and dry and could have been a bit more flavorful.  The cheese was a slice of unidentified white cheese laid into the burrito which later must have gone into the witness protection program since it completely disappeared once I took a bite.\n\nThe burrito was okay, but there was something about this burrito in general that just missed the mark.  Can't quite put my finger on it, but it just lacked that depth of flavor, that certain rich authentic burrito goodness that makes you crave it when you eat it.  Despite that, if you value trendy fresh taste in a burrito, you'll probably like this one.\n\nFor me, the overwelming flavor profile of this burrito from first bite is tart, fresh salsa.  Salsa, salsa, and more salsa.  Some people love that, I don't.  Other burritos I've had and craved have a different quality to them, a certain indescribable heavier depth of flavor, a magical melding of meat, bean, cheese and rice that just screams authentic.  This one was more reminiscent of La Salsa.    \n\nFood is a funny thing as it's so subjective.  What's awesome for one person is just okay for another and vice versa.

However, I sat down to eat my food and that's when I saw it for myself, the guy lived up to the reputation of an a-hole, now as I stated earlier I'm from south central LA so I don't mind dudes trying to be funny or whatever but this guy had a shtick of being obnoxious, arrogant and rude and wasn't funny at all, it was a problem to me because there were kids (Hispanic) and a white young couple there so both groups found and understood what he was saying to be volatile, the food was ok, but to be fair I'm from a city where there is a taco stand literally in every corner. So with that being said, I hope management or someone from that restaurant reads these reviews and I don't want anyone to get fired but at least reprimand him", "author": "Jay C."}

They're bursting with flavor of all that juicy meat, rice, beans, guacamole, sour cream and salsa you can handle.  Quesadillas are pretty awesome, too.  Gordo gives you lots of meat, and all of it (I've had chicken, steak and carnitas) is really good.  All the ingredients are super fresh, too.  Gordo is hardly good for your diet, but opt for boiled chicken instead of grilled if you're counting calories.  The boys here don't skimp on the butter, though, so I don't know if boiled chicken will help.\n\nPrices are reasonable ($5.50 for a super burrito, $4.50 for a quesadilla) and you get a free bag of tortilla chips, too.

You also may be thinking that just because I'm from Jersey I don't know what good Mexican food tastes like.  Let me assure you that I know what I'm talking about, especially when it comes to Gordo's...or at least its burritos.  You can really taste every ingredient separately, unlike most burritos where they are mashed together.  The burritos taste so fresh, not like most fast-food.\n\nQuick Tips\n1. Don't be afraid of getting a dry chicken in the burrito.  The chicken is moist and flavorful\n2. If you like your burrito spicy, ask for extra hot sauce!\n3.

They have wheat tortillas, grilled chicken, black beans and awesome guacamole (for my splurge.  I can't give THAT up too).  I get mine without rice and it's still a huge burrito for cheap.  Plus, they don't charge extra to NOT have things in your burrito.  \n\nWhen I feel like being bad, their quesadillas are awesome.  Don't get a quesadilla expecting it to be a standard, flat \"tortilla grilled cheese\" becuase they don't do 'em like that at Gordo's.

This may seem like a minor detail, but to me, it really makes a difference.\n3) the hot sauce is GOOD.\n4) Carnitas\n5) prices are beyond reasonable\n6) they will make whatever you order, exactly how you want it\n7) all the meat options are really good (Carnitas, Pollo asada, Carne asada, Pollo (boiled).  I haven't tried the verde)\n8) have I mentioned the carnitas?\n\nMy favorite is a Super Burrito, Carnitas (duh!), pinto beans, rice, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream.  No, I don't like Guacamole.  Although, I have also enjoyed the tacos and quesadillas.  The black beans are also good.\n\nWas Gordo's the only reason I moved to California, no.  But it was definitely a consideration.", "author": "Justin H."}

If so, march on back to the sunnier side of the city because you are about to be sorely disappointed.\nThe hands down best thing at Gordos is the quesadilla. Whether corn or flour, they are dipped in oil and fried with cheese (yes, you have officially entered a place loosely translated as Fatties). Top that with either some mouth watering carnitas or boiled chicken and you are good to go partner. Get a Gordos plate with carnitas and you will be equally satisfied. If you do decide on a burrito, remember that Gordos burritos are the melty cheesy kind and that the usual king of meats, carne asada, is sub-par here.\nAt the end of the day, if you know what to get, Gordos will satisfy you in a very unique way as compared to a mission taqueria, and thus, it should not be treated as such.\n\nP.S.

They are generous with the servings of everything, making huge burritos.  \n\nUnfortunately, they charge for chips and there's no free salsa. Normally I would automatically deduct a star for this. However they are damn lucky. Why? Because the spicy salsa here is the best pico de gallo in town, Mission district included.

I've been going to this place since I was a wee lad, and while it's not the best taqueria in SF (I'd say either El Matate or Taqueria San Francisco take that prize), it is cheap and consistently good. Their carnitas never fails, and I love their guac. The guys are friendly and willing to listen as you try to practice your broken Spanish, which is nice.", "author": "Daniel K."}

I get excited like a junkie knowing they are going to get a fix, it's sick. Never too fatty or sloppy or greasy.", "author": "Marilyn P."}

Just try Carmelina's down the street.  Gordo's burritos make a great burrito...I don't know what it would take to get 5 stars....I'm not sure that burriitos can actually attain 5 stars...so i'll give this place 4 stars with the declaration that they're muy delicioso!", "author": "Iris M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-02-05", "description": "Good, big, cheap burritos.  Not amazing across the board, but for the price I cant complaim.  If you find them too bland might want to try La Fonda around the corner, but be prepared to pay another $2 for that extra flavor.  Tip: Ask for pico de gallo, black beans, sour cream, and extra green hot sauce at least.  The guacamole isnt that great, but better than nothing.  If you dont mind dining on swine, the carnitas seems to be my favorite meat option.", "author": "Jared D."}

Of course, this is wet and fatty.....that's why it tastes so good.   So calorie watchers beware.    Not nice places to sit, but you'll be happy with the food as long as your expectations are right.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-10-31", "description": "There is nothing remarkable about this place; I could make these myself, but when I'm in San Francisco, they're good enough to grab.  However, they kind of screw you.  In most places \"super burrito\" means a burrito with cheese, guacamole, and sour cream.  So I ordered the super burrito.  He asked whether I wanted beans (of course) and rice (of course.), then whether I wanted salsa (of course), and also then whether I wanted guacamole and sour cream (asked as though they were a single item).  I said, yes, but only guacamole (liquid in a tube, really), but it was too late; two squirts and I had both.  And then when I got to the cashier the burrito was about two bucks more than the posted price.  It turns out guacamole and sour cream weren't included in the price, and, even though I didn't want the sour cream, I was stuck with it.  I suppose \"super burrito\" is never defined anywhere in the store, but it's still a bit misleading considering what it means at every taqueria in the Mission.  And I suppose I should have guessed with their low prices, there was some sort of scam going on, but I fell for it anyway.  Buyer beware.", "author": "M. B."}
