It's obviously not high end fancy dining, but the food is just GOOD. \nIt's hard to get calamari right, but every time I get it here it's melt-in-the-mouth good. It's also grilled and not battered/fried like so much of the calamari in little Italy. \nI really enjoy that they make the pizza right in front of you, and I always try and sit at the bar which looks over the pizza oven area so I can watch in anticipation. The ingredients are just super simple and fresh and good. The BURRATA my god it is so creamy. My latest thing is getting the pizza topped with the burrata, which is creamy enough to dip your crusts into. You're welcome.\nThe only thing I'm sad about is the fact they removed the Yelp waitlist feature, and for that reason I wouldn't visit at peak times.", "author": "Poppy C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-14", "description": "Here's the breakdown:\nReal Rating: 4.5\n\n1. This place is lit. As in, it's busy and crowded. Expect a wait if you come on a weekend during the usual dinner time. I went for a late dinner (9:30pm) on a Sunday and luckily for us, a table for two just opened up so we didn't have to wait. But the place was packed even at that time. \n\n2. The Prosciutto pizza was delicious ($18.75), the Lasagneria ($15) was okay. The pizza's dough was cooked perfectly where it had the perfect amount of chewy and crunchiness. The toppings were great and fresh. This pizza was just straight up amazing. The Lasagneria was a bit bland for my taste, but it was the only vegetarian pasta option and as my friend was vegetarian and craving pasta, that was our only choice.\n\n3. The interior is nicely decorated. It's dim and dark yet romantic and fun. It does get a bit loud. It's a perfect place for a date or going out with a group (or a couple) of friends.\n\n4. The service was okay. It did take the servers some time to take our order and they only checked up on us once, which I understand since it's busy. But the service didn't feel warm and welcoming. I kind of got a feel the servers didn't want to be there. This is the sole reason I couldn't hand out a 5-star rating, sadly.\n\n5. The prices range from $16-19 for a pizza and is $15 for the lasagna. You can always add more topping to the pizza which hikes up the price. I think the prices are fair for what they provide. \n\n6. The crowd is young and lively. Expect a mixture of techies, hipsters, and just really fashionable people. It's a fun group of crowd.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place for their pizzas. So delicious and would definitely come back. I would recommend for a date or a small friend gathering. It's a bit crowded for a large group of people.", "author": "Shin L."}

Everything came out very fast, and it was delicious. The Lasagna was really juicy and perfectly cooked. \n\nThe cheese with flat breads and salad was delicious, wanted to lick the place to get all of the olive oil from it.\n\nThe pizza was also very delicious and the servers taking care of us made sure we always had water and everything else we needed.", "author": "Carlos P."}

Lots of seating available. Not super busy during lunchtime on Saturdays earlier in the afternoon. \n\nIl Casaro || $17.50 \nMozzarella, grana padana cheese, cremini mushrooms, San Daniele prosciutto. Add burrata +$4. I was craving burrata so obviously added it as another cheese to the pizza. This pizza is perfect to share between 2 hangry people or 3 relatively hungry folks! Crust is perfectly crisp and chewy. Generous portions of cheese, mushrooms, and prosciutto! The prosciutto is on the saltier side, so I almost felt like there were too many slices in proportion to the pie-- but if you love meat, you'll appreciate the serving cuts. The burrata adds an amazing creaminess to the experience!\n\nOverall, I highly recommend trying out the burrata here! The pizzas are DELICIOUS.

But they've also got great pizza and amazing appetizers. \n\nWe ordered the carpaccio salmon which was delicious with the squeezed lime slices that they provide. The calamari skewers are also fresh and tasty. We got a couple of pizzas and they were amazing too. The crust was soft but had that crispy charred part on the crust, and the sauce was flavorful. They also have a number of great desserts, including soft serve ice cream! I was definitely impressed by that, as I've found it hard to find soft serve, especially at restaurants and not dedicated dessert shops.\n\nThis place is a bit pricy, but I think it's probably worth it.

This might not be the bestest, most spectacular Italian fare ever, but it's still really good. Best of all, in an increasingly expensive and inaccessible West Bay, prices are quite reasonable and the atmosphere and service quite welcoming and casual. \n\nAlthough the menu is fairly compact, sometimes simpler is better. Even then, the menu covers a good range of items, all of them satisfying and super delish. Apps like the polpette al sugo (ground beef meatballs with napoletana tomato sauce), the saffron risotto and mozzarella-stuffed arancini, or the nduja-stuffed potato croquettes are all very solid and could form a tapas-like meal. \n\nThe pizza, meanwhile, was slightly less superlative. It's thin crust all right, but unless you use a fork and knife, it'll fall apart if you try to grab it with your hands. Nevertheless, you can't go wrong with the diavola or the prosciutto, and you can see everything being made before your eyes in the open preparation area and brick oven. \n\nService is on point, and despite the compact nature of the space, there's a reasonable amount of seats for parties large and small.

Well, mostly, I just rediscovered my love for amazing thin crust proper Italian pizza and was on the search for some in SF.\n\nI was so pleasantly surprised by Il casaro's pizza. It tasted like it could rival some of the better establishments in NYC!! \n\nWe ordered (for 2 people) the Margherita and the Il Casaro pizzas, as well as the \"imported burrata\" and wood fired asparagus. Quite a lot of food but we were ok with getting some to go. I loved the margherita, I thought it was perfect tomato to cheese to crust ratio. Burrata was also excellent. I was surprised they named the il Casaro pizza after their establishment because I felt like the flavors were just ok. My boyfriend really liked that one though. He said he could taste garlic coming through but it just wasn't quite there for me. Still a great pie though! \n\nIt was also really chill atmosphere on a Friday evening, not too many people and not too loud. That's truly a miracle for a good place in SF. No line out the door?!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-26", "description": "Ok, so I think it's fair to say that Il Casaro doesn't need my positive review of their pizza, with its delicately-burned crust and dollops of bufala dotted over a perfectly-seasoned red sauce. Nor do they need too much more commentary on the ever-bustling scene that is their restaurant almost every single night of the week, a mix of hungry tourists and families, alongside locals who know about a good thing or three.\n\nWhat I'm focusing on is a guy named Francesco Covucci, one of the owners of Il Casaro, who simply put, lives and breathes customer service. My review actually starts with Caviar, which failed horribly in delivering pizza from here a month or so ago. I tried the usual measure to contact them but they were the opposite of caviar service, and in my opinion, give those fish eggs a bad name. On a whim, I emailed Il Casaro, mentioning my frustration. In minutes, Francesco wrote back with diplomacy and understanding, immediately calming me down. At the whim of a venture-backed delivery startup, my pizza was clearly at risk. Not in a forced way, Francesco said that if I'd consider it, to come in and sit down for a meal.\n\nWeeks went by but finally last night, we did, and there he was, gracious without trying to be, but also making sure our dishes arrived and we were always attended to (this while he ran the front of the house). We didn't see much of him after that, but his presence was there until the very end, and you could tell that our waitress was prepped to win us back as customers.\n\nAs some of you know, I used to work at Yelp years ago, where I pushed the idea of humanity and connection between reviewers and small businesses. That ideal has faded from Yelp over the years (sad!) but it's good to see Francesco and his team realizing that, while food is why customers might initial go, it's the human touch that keeps bringing folks back. Which we intend to, time and time again. \n\nThanks, Francesco, for renewing my faith in why I choose to go out and dine in this city.", "author": "Nish N."}

We were put on the wait list but only had to wait about 3 minutes and quite luckily, we got the best table in the place. We started with ros\u00e9 which the waitress recommended. Honestly, it was a little dark for me as I told her I prefer lighter colored ros\u00e9s. BUT OH WELL. Still drank the whole glass. Shortly after we ordered the beet salad and a 3 cheese pizza with arugula added on top. They brought out the salad first (which was fine) but we thought they would come together. Beet salad was v good. The pizza was...subpar...mainly because it was slightly undercooked for my tastebuds. But also the fault lies partially on me for not asking for crispier/burnt crust (yes I'm one of those weirdos). Loved how they had chili flakes on the table for us spice addicts. \n\nGood dining experience and loved the minimal wait but we watched people wait for much longer after we were seated. I can bet you'll find other great pizza places in North Beach so don't be too bummed if Il Casaro doesn't make it into your dining plans, but definitely try to fit it in if you can!", "author": "Kara N."}

The buratta was creamy and nice. They added some olive oil and pepper to the arugula, which was perfect. The bread was chewy and a good complement to the buratta. 3.75/5.\n\nThe il casaro pizza came with mushroom and proscuitto.  Filling enough for 3 (albeit smaller sized) people.

Chewy (but not hard to pull apart) crust, which felt more like a very delicious breadstick. Compared to other spots, the crust has a little more charred taste to it (not in a bad way though).

We loved everything, although the eggplant on the Norma wasn't really doing much to enhance the flavor of the slice. The crust had the perfect amount of bite and chewiness, and the cheese and sauce were flavorful and nice complements to each other. This was some of the best Neopolitan style pizza I've had in SF! Pizzas are 12\" and we felt like this was plenty of food for two people, so we opted to share one instead of get two, and definitely didn't need a second. \n\nWe also shared a bottle of house red (that day it was nero d'avola) for just $30!

Wood oven baked. 5 stars.\nThe mozzarella was nice but definitely not the best I had. \"OK\" I'd say.

The inside is airy and relaxed, and the service is absurdly speedy. In fact, everything about Il Casaro felt like it was fast-forwarded -- when my party of four rolled up to the waitlist the server told us to wait \"1 to 4 minutes\", which seems REALLY specific. It's probably a pretty high-traffic world and turning tables of tourists as rapidly as possible is the name of the game. \n\nMaybe a little TOO airy--we were seated as far from the door on a fairly temperate evening and it was crazy cold. Then again, with the door closed the pizza oven might heat the place up way too fast. \n\nSpeaking of the oven, the food was real fast--just like the wait and the service. I assume the oven is heated to like a zillion degrees and the pizzas are in there for half a minute. Which is fine by me, because the food's great. It's hard to find solid pizza in town and Casaro's is more than acceptable. Definitely get something, anything, with buffalo mozzarella on it. \n\nGreat place for a quick (keyword: quick!) meal. I went on a Monday night; it might be a nightmare to get a seat on a Friday or Saturday, but that says more about the neighborhood than Casaro itself.", "author": "Jim M."}

After burning off calories exploring the area we decided to look for an Italian place to eat.  We turned to trusty Yelp. \n\nWe got here about 6:15pm on a Friday. As with most places in the city that we have seen it is not very large in size but they use the space well. There are probably seats for 40 to 50 people including the counter area around where they prepare the food.\n\nWe reviewed the menu and placed our orders. We ordered the Polpette Al Sugo (ground beef meatballs with napoletan tomato sauce) appetizer, a Diavola pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, Italian salami and calabrian peppers on the side) and a calzone (tomato sauce, mozzarella, ham, mushroom, arugula, raspa dura cheese). \n\nThe Polpette Al Sugo was an amazing start, very tasty. The main courses were also fabulous. The pizza had just a little bite.\n\nWithin 45 minutes of our arrival, there was a line outside.\n\nOverall a great experience.

Although, if you have more than 4 people there's a good chance you won't be able to hear or make conversation with anyone but the person right next to you until you're both into yelling- which after a few drinks is actually totally fine, turns out. \n\nThe service was on point and we had no problem digging into the menu. The cauliflower was definitely my favorite item. I'd go back for that alone but next time I won't be sharing. The olives were as to be expected and same for the shishito peppers. The arancini was good, filling, and piping hot but even after all that I somehow found myself regretting not getting the corn since they did the cauliflower so well and I would've loved to have drizzled some of their fantastic Calabrian chili oil on it. Just another reason to come back, I guess. \n\nThe pizzas are around 10\" but if you're a crust-hater like me it's worth noting that a significant number of those inches are taken up by toppingless crust. I'm just not a bread person and never have been so I'm usually always the person who has the plate full of crusty pizza ends at the end of the night and that was definitely the case here. I ate the center of the pizza and really enjoyed it, but when I lined up all the crust at the end it ended up being just shy of half the pizza. Personally, if I'm getting a pizza, I want the topping to go all the way to the edge of the crust... otherwise why not just order bread? \n\nI did LOVE their few but delicious add on topping options like a farm egg, the saltiest olives ever, mushrooms, and Calabrian chilies which are basically my favorite things for a pizza. \n\nFor dessert I ordered myself a Nutella and banana pizza and less one slice, I ate the whole thing. And let the record show that with the dessert pizza they actually spread the toppings further so there's less crust. Yay! \n\nThe pizzas were also priced really well with my base margarita being just $12. That's a price tag I'll definitely come back for as I have a friend who I know would absolutely love this 'za.", "author": "Candice G."}

If you're a Bay Area native, you know that this neighborhood (aka \"Little Italy\") is mostly home to cheesy tourist spots. But I'm happy to report that this Neapolitan pizzeria is legit.\n\nI had the Diavola pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, Italian salami, Calabrian peppers served on a thin, chewy crust). With each bite, my taste buds were shouting \"Mamma mia!\"\nIt's actually quite a large pizza for one person, especially if you have an appetizer or two beforehand. I'd recommend sharing your pie with a friend. I could only eat half of mine, and wound up doggy-bagging the rest for lunch the next day. Though truth be told, by the time I got home, I couldn't help but dive back in to the leftovers. Yes, the pizza is that good.\n\nIf pizza ain't your jam, Il Casaro has other tasty offerings. I highly recommend the Polpette al Sugo (meatballs with tangy tomato sauce); the Cavolfiori (Roasted cauliflower, capers, garlic, calabrian chili oil); and the Arancini (fried rice balls with melted cheese in the middle). Everything was de-lish!\n\nService was friendly and fast. Keep in mind, this place gets crowded and loud. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this spot for an intimate date. And if you go with a group of 4 or more people, you'll have to shout to hear one another.\n\nMy only gripe is that they don't take reservations. So if you come here, be prepared to wait.

This time it did not work out, I was honestly so let down.  We came to il Casaro hoping to taste the authenticity and craft in their pizzas.  What ended up happening was poor customer service and poor pizza.  I'm not quite sure how they manage to make a pizza that is both soggy, yet completely burnt.  With a Margherita pizza there aren't many toppings to cover up a bland sauce so it is important that time is taken to make sure that the couple ingredients that are used, are used well.  Unfortunately they missed the mark here; it was not something I would ever come back for.  I will however come back for the burrata appetizer plate, though I would advise the restaurant to serve it with more than three tiny pieces of pizza dough, it was amazing!

While I was disappointed to find out they only serve mozzarella and burrata but no special variations on either (served simply with arugula, tomatoes, and crusty pizza dough triangles), I was very happy with the quality of the burrata. It was delicious and I could have eaten 3 more servings, easily. We also got the roasted calamari and zucchini which was PERFECTLY cooked. \n\nMy only critiques for both dishes - a touch of salt would have gone a long way on the calamari and an herb infused olive oil as an accoutrement for the pizza dough triangles - but maybe I'm being picky because other people were just slathering the burrata straight on the triangles. I was just happy eating it straight off the plate, lol.\n\nThe place is small and packed - we got lucky that we were only two people and got seated at the pizza bar right away. We loved the show!

The servers happily oblige and bring fresh grated cheese (very finely grated, like snow texture) in a small bowl to us.\n\nWe sprinkle the cheese on top and continue eating our amazing pizza.

Seriously, if you're thinking about ordering anything aside from the burrata or pizza, don't. Unless it's wine. They have a great wine list, and wine is delicious. \n\nIl Casaro is amore a prima vista. It's an intimate restaurant with windows that open onto the sidewalk for an al fresco feel. There are Italian servers and patrons filling the air with thick accents and clinks of wine glasses. The smell of the wood fired oven lingers like a sweet perfume.\n\nThe first time we came for dinner in a group of 4. We ordered the arancini, burrata, the tagliatelle carbonara, and the prosciutto pizza to share family style. The burrata was really good. Sadly the carbonara was pretty bland and disappointing and felt like a waste of a dish. Our arancini came out at the same time as our pizza, and was barely warm, so I think they had forgotten about it. The pizza was outstanding and flew off the pan - it was the only thing we really liked about the meal. Service was a little slow, but it was a weekend night so it was to be expected.\n\nOn our second trip, we had a group of 3 for lunch. Wiser after our first visit, we each ordered a different pizza. We tried the diavola (which was outstanding), a margherita, and the prosciutto again. The pizzas were all fantastic, with the diavola standing out as the clear favorite. \n\nThe main issue with this visit was the service. There was just one server, and the poor girl looked like she might have a breakdown at any moment. Although it wasn't crazy busy, it was evident that she was scrambling between tables and trying to keep up. She took our order by writing on her hand because she had lost her paper and we went without drinks for most of our meal. I felt bad for her, but it was not a good dining experience. \n\nI think if they hired more help, it would make a huge improvement to not just the service, but getting the food out hot and fresh.

I had heard good things about Il Casaro and wanted to try it out even tho it was freezing and there was a crowd of people waiting outside. Luckily we didn't wait too long because the crowds outside were all big groups of 5+ and we were just two so we sat down at the counter after like 15 minutes. Tables were empty and the bar had space but staff seemed to be still figuring out what their game plan was for the big groups. The place has good enough seating but I wouldn't say it was good for groups yet the place was packed with groups of 6+. \n\nI love sitting at the counter because this way I get to see the big pizza oven, and get to see all the other orders being made. We started our night with a glass of chianti, and a burrata plate. The burrata was so delicious! It came with a side of hot pizza bread, arugala and tomatoes. Wonderful way to start our meal. We then shared the pappardelle which was perfectly al dente and possible the widest pasta i've ever seen. It was almost so wide, I started to wonder if I'm eating the noodles that lasagna's made from? Either way the sauce was delicious and i loved the dish. \n\nThe pizza is where we probably went wrong. I loved eating broccoli and sausage pizza in Italy so I was immediately drawn to it on the menu and ordered it. But as I watched the staff make pizzas for other tables I noticed no one else ordered it but us. Everyone else probably knew better because the pizza came out and it was kinda soggy. I'm not sure what made it soggy and kinda flavorless... but it was. I've had better sausage and broccoli pizza before but the pizza dough itself was still really good- chewy and fluffy and just great dough.  I had to soak up the pappardelle sauce with the pizza to add some flavor. \n\nOverall good experience, friendly staff, lively place, good eats.

We got the lasagna, the carbonara, a salad, some fried risotto balls and a mozzarella flight..... Lasagna was great, with a really rich, meaty sauce. The carbonara was impressive-- often times I feel like carbonara feels over wrought-- just too much oil or too heavy with cream or cheese, but they got this perfectly done. The risotto balls were not oily at all, and were able to retain a lot of their flavor even though they had been deep fried. The mozzarella flight I did not really partake in, but my friends assured me that it was the creamiest, silkiest mozzarella that they have had. \n\nI took off one star because our server didn't really check on us, so it was hard to put in our order or ask for more water, get drinks, etc. I also really liked this place though because it's not pretentious at all and is in the heart of North Beach!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-21", "description": "Nearly all the restaurants in North Beach are named after famous Italians - Marco Polo, Cristofo Columbo, Mona Lisa - so we figured that a restaurant named not after a person but a food profession was a good choice. Il Casaro a.k.a. The Cheesemaker is a reference to the mozzarella tasting bar that this restaurant is organized around. Rather than the kitschy hanging cured meats, baskets and giant wine bottles of other Italian restaurants, Il Casaro has the fresh, open feel of a modern kitchen. \n\nWe sat at a small table by the open window so it felt as though we were sitting outside but were more protected from the sound, heat and debris of the busy street. My friend and I had just had a drink at Vesuvio so opted for water but they had a really interesting wine and beer list. I would love to come back sometime for a drink and a cheese appetizer. But today, we shared the Margherita pizza with prosciutto and a beet salad. \n\nThe beet salad was amazing. Fresh, delicious, light and flavorful. Several kinds of beets, greens, and cheese and nut crumbles. Really nice. The pizza, however, was a bit of a disappointment. Terribly bland. Despite the prosciutto, it needed salt and I never add salt to my food at a restaurant. The crust was nothing spectacular, nice chew but too much bread, soggy in the middle and not crispy at all. I rarely eat pizza and experiences like this one remind me why. It so rarely lives up to its promise.", "author": "Angelique L."}

The antipasti plate is served with a small bed of arugula and a few slices of warm baked pizza bread. The salad was a bit salty but the remainder of the dish was delicious. Spicy coppa was amazing (perfect portion amount) and the bread was tasty. Almost made me wish we had ordered a small pizza.\n\nThe mozzarella was ok. I've tasted fresher buffala but not entirely bad considering many Italian restaurants don't offer this menu option. Castelvetrano olives was fresh and perfectly brined.

That's like the pizza here for your taste buds instead of your ears. Do you get it now?\n\nFive of us went on a Wednesday night. If you're there early enough like 6 to 8 pm I don't think there would be any issues for a table, but then later it started getting a bit busy and some folks had to wait a bit for it to clear out. I'm imagining on the weekends it's pretty packed. \n\nThe pizza is phenomenal. There is no other word for it.\n\nI was starving and got to the restaurant an hour earlier than my friends. I couldn't wait, so decided to have a little appetizer. I ordered what I thought was going to be a tiny plate of meat and bread and it was a huge plate for $4.50! I got the mortadella. AWESOME. All the cured meats comes with argugala, cherry tomatoes and their delicious bread. It was such a great starter and I thoroughly enjoyed even before tasting the glorious pizza! \n\nFor 5 of us, we ordered 6 pies. That's right. 6 pies which means on average every one of us ate more than a pie!? That's insane.\n\nThe pizza dough is out of control. You can see on the tear how beautifully it's made. The char is a little bit on the stronger side, but not too much to over power with a smoked flavor. The sauce is absolutely perfect. Tart, but still just enough sweet. And the pizza comes out HOT with cheese falling off if you're not careful. The mozzarella is obviously ridiculously fresh. Both the regular and the burrata. \n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nQuattro formaggio \nBurrata x 2\nDiavola (spicy salami)\nMargherita X 2 \n\nMy favorite was the one with the salami because I love meat on my pizza, but everything else was cooked to perfection. The four cheese one is good, and I really enjoyed it but the goat cheese could be a bit intense for some people. \n\nThis climbed to the list of my favorite pizza places in the U.S!

Good pizza is hard to find in SF and this place is at the top of our list now.\n\nUpdate: Went back again a few times, to try out other menu items in addition to the pizza. Let me just say that the meatball appetizer is drenched in the most delicious tomato sauce ever. So delicious in fact that even though I was suffering from some pretty bad pregnancy heartburn, I still sopped it up with bread and ate it all because it was way too good to waste.

Norma pizza was a basic Margarita pizza topped with eggplant. Simple flavors, yet delicious. But it was a lot more soggy than Prosciutto pizza....  Along side the pizzas, there were red chili soaked in spicy oil. It was SO GOOD! Gives the pizza a great kick of spice. When you're done with the middle part of your pizza slice, dip the end crust into the spicy oil - trust me, you will leave no crusts behind! \n\nOverall, fairly delicious pizza restaurant with great atmosphere. It's a great place to go if you cannot bear the wait at the other famous pizza restaurants.  \n\n\nFavorites: \n* Prosciutto pizza ($18.75) - San Daniele prosciutto, arugula, tomato sauce, mozzarella, cheese\n\nOther orders: \n* Norma pizza ($15.75) - mozzarella, tomato sauce, ricotta salata, fried eggplant", "author": "Victoria L."}

This is what I ended with after each slice of pizza. Was it good? Sure. It was alright. It was tasty in fact; with the addition of hot pepper flakes and Parmesan! Would I return? Highly unlikely. \n\nShortly after being served the pizza was cold. Their Margarita pizza is floppy and soggy. The Prosciutto pizza was okay. I would have been content with just the prosciutto slices and parmesan slices to be honest. Our wine had to be served in heavy water glasses because they 'ran out of wine glasses'. Not the end of the world. But still. Plus the wine really should have had a moment to breathe for oh.. I don't know, maybe an hour or so. \n\nOur table of four was situated snugly against a wall of fire logs. Undoubtedly for use in the fire-wood pizza oven. It's a nice decor statement. Except when you're wearing a silk dress, attempting to squeeze in behind the table next to you without snagging. \n\nThe salad was delicious. My favorite item on our table!", "author": "Jaylena P."}

I used to rarely eat pizza even when I was living in Italy, but my husband is a great lover. We went there after the movie theatre where I ate too many pop-corns so I arrived there without any hunger, therefore I decided to order a salad. Ingredients: romaine heart lettuce, roasted pine nuts, olive oil, lemon. Price: $9.5, which sounds crazy, but first, it's San Francisco and, second, maybe it was quite abundant. \n\nMy husband ordered a marinara + mushrooms. It was about 1.45pm.\n\nAfter a wait of about 40-45 minutes, our plates arrive! In the meantime, I got really hungry and there was no bread or breadsticks to bunch on as we usually have in Italian pizzerias. But that's ok. Unfortunately, beyond a little bunch of romaine heart lettuce leaves, roasted pine nuts, olive oil and lemon, there was grated cheese all over the plate! Wonderful, I can't eat cheese. So I send them back my plate and I order calamari, that cost only 50cents more of my previous choice and are way more nutrient and satisfying. \n\nPizza: nope. Slightly burnt at the bottom and in little dots on the perimeter, quite uncooked the rest, yielding a very soft and pillowy pizza, with zero crunchiness. It was also full of black olives - which have a strong flavor, so he removed 1/2 of them - and the mushrooms were simply cremini - in Italy, you almost never put cremini on a pizza. At the end, he said no. We won't return.", "author": "Valentina G."}

So glad I made it here during my long weekend in SF. Let me tell you why Il Casaro was such a great experience... \n\nFor one thing, their wait for a party of 6 was reasonable - about 30minites. We were originally going to go to Tony's, but after we were quoted a 2.5hr wait time we decided to go somewhere else. I had seen good reviews on Yelp for Il Casaro so we made our way over. Upon arrival we put our name on the list. Only 2 parties ahead of us! Score! Finally after about 30mins of waiting we were seated. \n\nIl Casaro is small... I think the biggest table I saw seated 6 and it was the one we had. I love small restaurants though, so much more intimate. When you walk in you see the huge pizza oven right in the center with the pizza makers right there tossing the dough. So cool to watch them work their magic. \n\nOnce seated we ordered wine and beer - very reasonably priced. Next up we got the burrata appetizer. If you have never had burrata you are seriously missing out. It is amazingly creamy mozzarella! It was served with flatbread, arugula, and cherry tomatoes. So fresh and a great beginning to what was to come. Or party of 6 ordered 3 pizzas: the prosciutto, the buffala, and the broccoli rabe. \n\nMy favorite, hands down was the prosciutto! YUM!! So much prosciutto, delicious cheese, and a fabulous chewy crust. The buffala was a close second. Our whole party agreed though that the broccoli rabe & sausage pizza was a kiss. The flavors didn't mesh well. I'd skip this one if I were you. The broccoli rabe was too bitter, in my opinion. \n\nOverall this was an exceptional pizza experience in Little Italy. Check this superb place out when you are in SF.", "author": "Sara W."}

Il Casaro on Columbus Ave was among the restaurants that had later hours on a Sunday aside from the usual suspects that have sidewalk dining. We looked at the menu outside and decided to try it out. First impression aside from a semi-busy crowd for a late Sunday night is how warm the room is because of the wood fired pizza oven. It definitely warms up the room. But even on a cold night like that, it was still a little too warm for my liking. \n\nWe were seated at one of the high tables towards the back side of the space. Our server was attentive and friendly and knew when to leave us alone & when to ask us if we needed anything. We started off with some mortadella which was served with some crostini, arugula and roma tomatoes drizzled in olive oil. It was excellent. The mortadella along with the crostini and greenery were great. It had great flavor and was a perfect appetizer. \n\nThe pizza we ordered was the broccoli & salsiccia. It came with italian sausage, broccoli rabe and mozzarella cheese. The crust was good, the cheese was great, so was the italian sausage but the broccoli rabe was just too bitter to my liking. I dont think I would get that pizza again. They have several other choices that I would rather try out. \n\nIl Casaro was a nice option for a casual meal in North Beach. Street parking only.

You could lure me off a cliff with their cheese.\nTake all of that, pair with a decent beer list, plunk it all down in a pumping area of the city, and you have Il Casaro  - a pizza joint worthy of pilgrimage.", "author": "Dan O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-10", "description": "After finally trying out the pizza at Il Casaro, I think it deserves a review update since my last review only had me trying their Salumi Plate and Burrata.  Ate here for dinner with a few friends and we ordered a couple of pies along with their Buffala Mozzarella\n\nBuffala Mozzarella --  http://bit.ly/1AZTDQZ\nLike their Burrata this was served with arugula, cherry tomato and bread.  This was very good!  Nice and creamy with a smoked flavor.  Though I still prefer their Burrata, you can't really go wrong with any of Il Casaro's cheese selections.\n\nDiavola -- http://bit.ly/1CZoegJ\nmozzarella, tomato, spicy salami\nThis seems to be the most popular pie at Il Casaro.  And it's a really good one.  It's a simple pie, but the spicy salami does shine and gives the pizza the spicy kick it needs.  This was my favorite out of the two pizzas we had.\n\nCapricciosa -- http://bit.ly/1AZT3md\nSan Marzano tomato, mozzarella, artichoke, black olives, prosciutto cotto, mushrooms\nThis pizza didn't hit out of the park for me.  It might have been the mix of toppings used which made the pizza very watery and when taking out a slice the toppings would all slide off.  On paper it sounds delicious, but it didn't taste that good for me.  It's possible though I may try this pizza again in the future.\n\nAnd for dessert, we shared a Raspberry Panna Cotta.\n\nRaspberry Panna Cotta -- http://bit.ly/1EXLhNH\nYou really can't go wrong with any Panna Cotta.  I'm a huge sucker for it.  And Il Casaro's was delicious!!  Just the right amount of sweetness from the creamy gelatin and raspberry compote.\n\nSo after having a full dinner service at Il Casaro, I still think it's a solid 4 star pizza joint.  I didn't thoroughly enjoy every pizza I had but their pies are still solid nonetheless and their burrata is incredible!  I enjoy the casual atmosphere and they always seem to have tables open which makes it a great spot if you're in North Beach with a few friends and don't have any dinner reservations for the night.", "author": "Rodney H."}

Well this finally happened to me last night and I was oh so sad!\n\nI made almost bi-weekly stops at Il Casaro for dinner - making sure I get my Napoli-style pizza and Burrata fix. To this day, I have no complaints about the quality of the food, however, the state of the service last night was thoroughly disappointing.\n\nWe arrived at 8:30PM last night, figuring we would miss the dinner rush - wrong! This place was packed, and for good reason, of course. We added our name to the list of waiting patrons, and waited for about 30 minutes. To pass the time, we browsed the Il Casaro's Yelp page and noticed that their was an open reservation for a table at 9:30PM that same night. We decided to book that in case we would have to wait longer (smart right). Wrong. When 9:30 finally rolled around I went inside and informed the hostess of our reservation.  The hostess simply told me NO. and then repeated that and said: \"No, you did not have a reservation. No. No. No.\" No questions asked. Even though we had confirmation that we made one. Luckily, right at that time, a table opened up and we were next on the waiting list, so we got a spot. \n\nWe sat down browsed the menu and I settled on ordering what I always do: aperol spritz, burrata, and the prosciutto pizza.  Sadly, there was no aperol available last night, the aperol supplier had gone MIA - weird! We then ordered our appetizers and our main courses and excitedly waited for our food to arrive and boy did it arrive quick! Our pizza arrived within 5 minutes of ordering it....however our appetizers were nowhere in sight. We politely asked the waitress, thinking maybe she had forgotten, but no...they just weren't ready yet. We waited 15 minutes more, finishing most of our pizza before our appetizers ever arrived. I guess it doesn't really matter in which order you get your food, but when I order the appetizers first, I usually want to enjoy them pre-meal. A friendly warning and apology would have been nice as well. \n\nOther than the state of the customer service last night, I always enjoy the food at Il Casaro. I'm sure the staff were overwhelmed with all the hungry, impatient guests. I just hope that next time they are a bit better equipped to deal with the situation.", "author": "Aletta B."}

That's because all of their pizza is made the right way -- in a magnificent wood fired oven -- which leaves each one coming out perfectly cooked and ready to be devoured. In addition to using traditional methods, their ingredients are also extremely fresh, generously piled onto each pizza, and perfectly complimentary to their crusts which are slightly chewy, slightly crunchy, and entirely delicious.\n\n(Side note: I focus on the pizza because to be honest - I wasn't a huge fan of the burrata. But that stuff in general just kinda weirds me out, so it would be unfair to knock them for that. I'm just not a burrata guy it seems.)\n\nAnyway, again the pizza here is truly fantastic. I actually think I finished my entire pizza in less than 10 minutes, and I wasn't even that hungry. It's just that good - somehow even BETTER than the pictures, which already make things look mouthwatering. You just need to try it.\n\nFinally, I recommend sitting near-enough to the kitchen area so that you can watch their chefs go to work. It is truly an experience watching their expert pie-makers go about their craft. You can see the prosciutto as it's being thinly sliced into delicious ribbons that pile gently into delicious layers onto a pizza that's - quite literally - fresh out the oven. And when you realize that the pizza you are watching is about to come your way, I guarantee you that you will never be happier that you today is the day you decided to drop into Il Casaro and see what all the fuss is about.", "author": "Brian S."}

We arrived very hungry, and hesitant to put our name down on what seemed like a lengthy list. We waited around, and tables didn't see to be turning. So we walked across the street to The Stinking Rose, were quoted a short wait. While waiting, I received a text on my phone from here that our table was ready. Without hesitation, we decided to hop back across the street. This was the best decision. Our server was really awesome, loved her personality and honesty when asked about her favorite pizza. We ended up getting the fresh buffalo mozzarella app which came with fresh baked bread, arugula drizzled with evoo and cherry tomatoes. It was beyond amazing, clearly very fresh cheese! It was everything and more. Loved the Calabrian chili oil at the table. We also ordered the four cheese pizza (Mozzarella, goat cheese, asiago, gorgonzola), and added mushrooms to it. It sounds basic--but holy moly was it delish! Regretful that we didn't have room for dessert. I highly recommend this place. Also, great music, and open windows at the front of the restaurant.

There were 5 of us and I am happy that they have seating for large parties. We were seated at the high tables and were instantly presented with menus and water. We had a vegetarian with us so we decided on the Prosciutto, Norma and Margherita pizzas.\n\nThe Prosciutto came with hand cut slices of cheese on top that was very divine. The prosciutto itself was hard to find but were an amazing touch to the thin slice pizza. I liked that the crust was very puffy and doughy with a slight crunch.\nThe Norma was really nice as well. I felt that the sauce overpowered the dough from the pizza and left it in a swamp. It slid off my pizza and took the cheese with it. Norma was meant to be eaten with a knife and fork.\nFinally the Margherita pizza had a sweet touch. There were thin slices of sweet vegetables that were an amazing touch to the cheese and dough. \n\nThe place was lit, open and welcoming. I enjoy the modern design, seating and the large pizza oven. I felt that the pizzas were delicious but I wouldn't have minded if they cooked it a little longer. I felt that my pizzas were hard to pick up and had to be eaten with a fork and knife.

The pizza is Napolitano style- thin and crispy.  The dough, tomato paste and excellent cheese on our margarita pizza were simply a marriage of taste and simplicity.

We placed our order and requested for it to all come at the same time. \n\nWe ordered: burrata mozzarella, margherita pizza, marinara pizza, bucatini pasta.\n\nHaving just gone back from a trip to Italy we were ready for some pizza and this place delivered. The dough is thin, tasty and the tomato sauce is superb. Why did this remind us of an authentic Napoli pizza? The center is soft, tender and the cheese is soupy in the middle- yummy. We would definitely come back to try all the other pizza. \n\nThe burrata was creamy and soft. My boys devoured it and claimed it to be so close to the ones they had in Italy. \n\nThe bucatini pasta was aldente. The sauce was perfectly balanced by a hint of sweetness from the onions. We cleaned off the bowl with our pizza dough. \n\nOverall, really good place to eat and experience oven wood pizza Napoli style. The place has more of an upscale, hip vibe to it that we did feel a bit out of place (with 2 boys with us). Seems like the manager was walking and talking to everyone but  never managed to acknowledge us- which is fine, we had a great server (May have been the busy Saturday afternoon too). \n\nOverall, I give it 4 stars.

Unfortunately my last experience here was by far the worst experience at a restaurant I have ever had, note that I was a waiter for 5 years a could never fathom treating a customer like this waiter treated me. I was seated by the host and told her that 2 friend from out of town were joining ( note the restaurant had at the time 5 tables open). The plan was to meet and eat there but unfortunately they were too hungry to wait until I got off work and arrive late and full. Already the waiter, who is always there, perhaps the manager, was irritated because they were late and didn't want to order. After 10 mi. A coworker of mine said he would join me and I let the waiter know he was coming. He rolled his eyes dramatically and later came back reprimanding me saying that this was not how the business was ran. That I shouldn't have sat down if my whole party was here and that someone can't just show up and order at a later time than the rest of the table. He was clearly angry and taking it out on me. I told him I could order for my friend who would arrive shortly and he answered rudely with a \"fine! But this is not how we run our business, there are other people who need the table\". I honestly regret even paying for my meal from how horribly I was treated, not to mention the embarrassment from his loud scorns  that the other tables heard. I had recommended this place to a bunch of friends and coworkers but now wont be back and will inform them of my experience. It was clearly about the money and that my other 2 friends didn't order.

Server was legit Italiano, super friendly and kind and outgoing. \n\nWe started with a half bottle of Prosecco. Perfectly bubbly , dry and not too sweet. We ordered 2 arancinis and 2 croquettes. The potatoe croquettes were delish, crispy on the outside with a spicy meat inside. \n\nNext we ordered the bufalina pizza and added sausage. We enjoyed watching the pizza man make the pizzas in the wood fired oven. Our pizza took about 3 mins and then handed over to us piping hot. The mozzarella was creamy and tasted great. The tomato sauce was bold and flavorful. Some of the reviews talk about the crust being soggy.... pick up a fork, start in the center and enjoy delicious pizza. This is authentic to Italy! \n\nWe finished with a macchiato and cappuccino. After I gave my server a hard time about needing a creamy cappuccino, he asked me to trust him, (insert Italian accent here) \"that I make it a thea Italiano way\" Trusting him was best because it was the most creamy and bold cappuccino I've had! \n\nMy husband and I enjoyed the service, atmosphere, food and experience.

I strongly recommend that a quality restaurant cleans up its act by replacing careless, rude and lazy waiters, with people qualified to work at their restaurant. \n\nFood: While the pictures online look incredible, the pizza was served 30 minutes after it came out of the oven - good ingredients but for having the oven right there, it came out soggy and cold - probably more a result of our inattentive waiter than the cooking.", "author": "Amit A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-04", "description": "There's nothing worse than a limp, flaccid...\n\nPizza.\n\nAm I right, ladies? And gentlemen. \n\nWhat did you think I was going to say? Pervs. \n\nI visit North Beach as much as I visit my dentist...which is never. Both are pain in the ass for different reasons. Tater Tot had a grooming appointment in North Beach so what better way to kill time than to knock off some of my North Beach bookmarks.\n\nI've had II Casaro bookmarked since they opened in early 2014 so I was super ecstatic to finally pay a visit especially with all the glowing reviews. However, after our visit, I was scratching my head as to where all these glowing reviews are coming from (mainly from tourists). I held off on writing my review in the event our experience was an off day. With some recent bad reviews, our experience is unlikely a fluke so here we go...\n\nSorry folks, this is another overrated North Beach restaurant for tourists. Their current 76/100 health score is a bit scary as well especially with an open kitchen. \n\nII Casaro's menu: Antipasti (fried cheese, meatballs, aracini), Mozzarella Bar, Salumi (prosciutto, spicy coppa, mortadella), Piatti (tagliatelle, spaghetti, lasagna, gnocchi), and Pizzas (12+ options). Prices are really reasonable for this touristy area with mains in the $14-$16 range. Reservations accepted. \n\nWe started with the Imported Burrata & Proscuitto San Daniele ($7.75, $8): http://bit.ly/1MKvxPt. The burrata was hands down the best I've had. It was deliciously milky and soft with a tinge of sea salt and pepper to make it pop. I could eat this all day with the accompanying flatbread. I'm totally lactose intolerant (and had no lactaid) which made for a fun ride home with my dining companion. *emoji with medical mask* The prosciutto was ehhh; very salty and very lean.\n\nIf you're looking for deliciously tender balls, look elsewhere. The Polpette Al Sugo: Ground Beef Meatballs, Napoleon Sugo ($7): http://bit.ly/1IVSejR was by far the worst meatballs I've had. They were hard, dense, and clearly overworked. I've had better balls at Buca Di Beppo which is pretty sad. Best meatballs ever can be found nearby at Tosca Caf\u00e9. It's $4 for a tiny golf ball sized meatball but they're life changing. \n\nThe biggest disappointment of the night was the pizza. We shared the Broccoli + Salsiccia: Scamorza Cheese, Broccoli Rabe, Italian Sausage ($16.50 + $4 egg): http://bit.ly/1DnpfU1. The pizza was amazing to look at with its alluring leopard spots but it seriously made me want to cry. As soon as I picked up a slice, all the toppings slid off to reveal a bottom crust drenched in liquid. Now, I know Neapolitan pizzas are supposed to be a little soggy in the center but the center was like a wet sponge. We had to tear off the center crust and just eat the outer crust. The sausage was flavorless and very dry (tasted like turkey sausage) while the broccoli rabe was very bitter. Not a good combo. Who doesn't love a little egg porn? Well, there was egg porn in all its glory but the egg white was still translucent and raw (when you cut it). The menu stated it was $3 for \"eggs\" but we were charged $4 for one egg. WTF. \n\nOur waitress was really nice which was redeeming and it wasn't crowded so we got our food rather quickly. For the hour we were there, the owner or manager (?) was sitting at one of the four top tables in front on his ipad and talking on his cellphone. This was rather unprofessional. \n\nWe went on a Saturday and reservations were not needed as it wasn't even busy. When we left during peak dinner time, it was less than 1/4th filled with tourists. Plenty of seating (high tops) for larger groups.\n\nSorry II Casaro, I just wasn't feeling you...even after several drinks at The Boardroom. Maybe, Mr. Viagra can help ya.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I've waited long for food (Paxti's for example also take an hour, but they tell you ahead of time), but my biggest gripe was they didn't warn us or let us know that it was going to take awhile because their kitchen was backed up. We were excited because we came in at 8 and no wait.  Our saga began...\n\n10 min: It started in the beginning when we noticed our waitress taking orders first from other tables that came in much after us.  \n\n40 minutes: she apologizes to a different table how their pizza is taking a long time. We flag her down to make sure that our order is actually in, as now we're also getting concerned- she assures us that the kitchen is just back logged.  \n\n1 hr mark: We watch other tables around us who came in after us get their pizzas as we are slowly withering away from lack of food. An hour after sitting in the restaurant, we ask again as now we're pretty concerned our order was forgotten.  Boyfriend is seething and asks me if we should just leave the restaurant.\n\n1 hr 15 min: we finally get our pizza. It's decent but not as mind blowing as I made it out to be after watching maybe 20 pies go by.\n\n1 hr. 30 min: We gobble down the pizza in 15 minutes and leave\n\nI get that you're back logged and short staffed, but let us know so that we can order other things in the meantime.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-05", "description": "TL;DR:\n\nFor the love of tastebuds, have I not been transported to Napoli itself with these familiar flavors!? Yes, brethren & sisters, I've been to the Old Country and supped at its greatest pie houses. This is an experience not less glorious.\n\nTHE DEETS:\n\n***IMPORTED BURRATA\n\nThough many a burrata have I ravaged, I do declare that never until today have I experienced burrata as it was truly intended. This celestial dairy must have poured forth from the most holy of golden calves, hand-fed the hand-manicured artisanal grass of an immortal world. The milk & cream from this cow are superior to all before it, and the cheese-making methods employed here are esoteric & second to none. There is no toughness, only gooey joy. When you bite in, the fresh panna flows forth as a divine gift.\n\nThe bread strips served with this dish were magnificently charred, soft as silk, and drizzled with potent premium olive oil (no canola blend detected). With it was a simple arugula & grape tomato salad, which masterfully satisfied the need for complexity by offering bitter & sweet notes.\n\nI'd come back for this dish alone.\n\n***DIAVOLA PIZZA - Mozzarella, tomato sauce, spicy salami\n\nI've searched high & low for true Napoli pizza on this continent and have not once found crust so beautifully charred and yet perfectly supple. Surely a sign of doppio zero flour. It was so soft that you could roll it up and wipe your face with it. The sauce was infinitely light & as delicately fruity as can be, enabling you to eat slice after slice without being bogged down by the slightest shadow of heaviness. The fact that they stuck \"Mozzarella Bar\" as part of the establishment's name corroborates my experience--these were sinfully moist, meaty, & yet somehow light chunks of moo product. And yes, the crucial basil centerpiece was equally toasted & wilted as is the divine degree.\n\nThe soft red chillies & spicy salami was a lovely treat, providing just enough heat & flavor without overwhelming the batch. \n\n***PROSCIUTTO PIZZA - San Daniele prosciutto, arugula, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese\n\nThe crust, sauce, & mozzarella were just as meticulous & present as the last pizza; in addition, this pie was topped with delicious prosciutto, arugula, & raspadura shavings. The prosciutto provided a luxuriously moist layer, while the arugula offered some pleasant bitter contrast. The raspadura, while extremely fresh and flavorful, was in my opinion slightly excessive due to the dry nature of the cheese and the copious amounts that had to be consumed to get to the pizza below. Still, if generosity was their fault, the quality of the ingredients made this more than forgivable.\n\n***PANNA COTTA with raspberry sauce\n\nI've had more panna cotta than I can recall, but the consistency of this product (as had become a theme throughout the meal with each additional dairy offering) was much more refined & dare-I-say velvetier that anything I'd previously encountered. It was truly a cream-filled delight, finished gracefully with fresh vanilla bean seeds & tangy raspberry pur\u00e9e.\n__\n\nJust remember, you're very welcome.", "author": "Elliott D."}

The menu is fairly small but great. We ordered 2 beers, the grilled cauliflower, beet salad and sampler mozzarella plate to start off and let me tell you it was heaven. Then we ordered the Capricciosa pizza but substituted the prosciutto for the salami and substituted the black olives for the green olives. It was incredible. Very friendly staff, good service (could have been a little better but there were only 2 servers so it is understandable why the service wasn't the fastest). Loved this place, maybe the best pizza I've ever had. We also got the tiramisu and the strawberry gelato which was delicious too. will definitely be back", "author": "Ilana B."}

The wait might be a little long during rush hours due to the limited seating, but the max I've ever waited was probably 30 minutes at 7pm on a Saturday night, which makes sense since every single restaurant in the city is packed at that time.\n\nGo there!!

Il Casarro is San Francisco's main contender. \n\nThe pizzaiolo is Salvatore Di Stefano, who trained under THE \"TONY GEMIGNANI\" of Tony's in North Beach. \n\nBut here's the thing. Tony's is not what it used to be. I gave it 3 chances. Each was a flop for the margherita. Especially having tried the best of NY's neapolitan styles, Tony's could not compare. In fact, I can tell if it'll be good the moment I pick up the slice (yes, I eat my neapolitan style with my hands sometimes. I like to appreciate the dough and feel it... and tear the crust to dip into the sauce on the plate) \n\nAt Tony's, I'm bored after the first slice. At Una Pizza Nepoletana, it's better than Tony's, as I could enjoy it to the last slice. But it was still lacking. Both Tony's and Una Pizza have too much blistering on the crust for my taste. \n\nBut finally, I found Il Casarro. Best in town. Hands down. The moment I pick up the first slice each and every time, I know it's good. I know it's properly made. I know the crust is just right, not too burnt and not too plain. It's just right. the blistering ratio is spot on. \n\nI've brought many people to this establishment and they all LOVE it. \n\nOh the burrata is pretty good too.", "author": "Gregory F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-02-04", "description": "I am a San Francisco native recently retired and work part time as a delivery person for Caviar for extra cash. Recently, I accepted a Caviar delivery order for Il Casaro on a Monday night.  Legal parking is extremely difficult in North Beach.  Since my app said the order was ready, I parked illegally expecting to pick up the order immediately.  The waiter told me it was almost ready and they they were \"working on\" my order.  They kept me waiting for about 20 minutes while I was parked illegally.  I asked three times how long I needed to wait. The only answer they would give me is they were \"working on it\". Around that time I noticed a traffic officer writing parking tickets across the street.  Since the restaurant refused to me give a direct answer about how long I needed to wait, I decided to have my delivery reassigned and move my car to not risk receiving a parking ticket. I immediately informed the Caviar Dispatcher and expected the delivery order to simply be given to another driver. Instead, I was deauthorized for three days without any recourse until the Caviar office contacted me. I lost three days worth of income.\n\nApparently, the restaurant told the dispatcher that they told me the order had been ready for five minutes before I left. THEY ARE LYING!!!  It doesn't even make sense that they would tell me an order was ready and that I would THEN wait ANOTHER five minutes (after waiting for 15-20 minutes already), while I am anxious to avoid a parking ticket, and then leave WITHOUT the order!  That scenario strains credibility. \n\nThe restaurant, Il Casaro, somehow screwed up the order and refused to tell me when it would be ready.  Then, to further cover up their mistake, they blatantly LIED to my dispatcher with the consequence that I was unable to earn an income for three days. That is an extremely crappy way to treat ANYONE who is dealing with any business or restaurant. I recommend that no one patronize this restaurant that I had never heard of before and instead go to any of a dozen or two excellent Italian Restaurants within a couple of blocks of Vallejo and Columbus. Il Casaro is in a space that used to be called the MDR Cafe (Minimum Daily Requirement) where I used to hang out in the 60s when I was in High School (Galileo). I grew up a few blocks away and worked for many years in the neighborhood and have never encountered treatment like this in any North Beach establishment.", "author": "Alexander S."}

We were sat by the open windows which was so nice because there was a cool breeze once in a while. \n\nOrdered the burrata, wild boar salumi, asparagus and marinaded castelveltrano olives to start with. Burrata is my absolute favorite and is the whole reason I booked this reservation. It did not disappoint. It was served with a couple of slices of bread and a light arugula salad. Everything was so good. I'm usually not an asparagus fan but they were roasted and stacked with grated cheese, how could I NOT like it! \n\nWe ordered two pizzas - the buffalo mozzarella margherita and the broccoli and sausage. The buffalo mozzarella gave off a lot of water so it made the pizza kind of soggy. But the creamy mozzarella with the freshness of the basil was very nice. The broccoli and sausage was my favorite - no sauce so just cheese, broccoli rabe, and fennel sausage. The broccoli rabe was a little bit bitter but complimented the fennel sausage and cheese. OH, and don't forget to use the chili oil on the table! It was just a nice kick to the pizza but not overwhelming at all. A little goes a long way! \n\nWe ended dinner with cappuccinos and espresso shots, it was a nice way to end it all. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like about it was the cleanliness of the restroom.

Walking in, the place was about 1/2 full & we got a table right away.\n\nService was sort of friendly & fairly attentive. We ordered Burrata & Asparagi to start + Margherita & Diavola pizzas. Our starters were served in short time. Both were excellent & seemed to be a good sign of things to come.\n\nOur pizzas, curiously, took a while. When they finally did make their appearance at our, they looked fine. But were just OK once we started chowing down on both. The general consensus around the table was that both pizzas were average, not the best, not the worst.\n\nAltogether, eating at Il Casaro Pizzeria & Mozzarella Bar was OK.

From creeping on the other tables' pizzas, I could already tell they had a major flaw: bad dough. Not to say their dough is bad tasting per se, but I could see it was going to be rather chewier and doughier than I would have liked. Sure enough, that is what we got. It lacks the flavor and thin/crispiness that I want from a napoletana pizza. The cheese atop the pizza was decent but not your melt-in-your mouth mozzarella.\n\nHowever their one redeeming quality was their tomato sauce. It's better than most around and it's soupy pink. I know that sounds gross, but my favorite pizza in NY also has a similar sauce. It must be the way the tomato sauce mixes with the mozzarella cheese.

It comes bread they made right in the brick oven. The burrata is drizzled with olive oil so pure you can drink it. If you've never tried burrata, it's like eating heavenly pillows of cheese that gently caresses your mouth. Must try.\n\nMy favorite favorite pizza here is the Prosciutto. They shave fresh parmesan on top and watching it melt slightly but still hold its structure is one of my favorite things to see in the world. I would frame it in an art installation if I could - if I didn't eat it first. Every bite is a perfect balance of meat and cheese and sauce and crust. \n\nMy second favorite is Capricciosa because the olives, artichoke, and mushroom add a lot of extra flavor but is so simple still.\n\nThe crust on their pizzas is so light that it doesn't over power any of the other ingredients. It's not too salty or oily or thick. And I love using the crust to mop up the extra sauce and oil. And because the oil they use is so good, you don't feel disgusting eating it.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is great, too. I like sitting at the bar so I can watch them make the pizzas. They also have three TVs that always have some sort of games on, which tones down any sort of pretentiousness the scratch made nature of the place might get.\n\nI'm only scared that this place will get too popular and I won't be able to get a seat right away on a Friday night.", "author": "Jamie C."}

It paired perfectly with the charred bread, herb seasoning, arugula and tomato.\nWe shared a capricciosa pizza and the tagliatelle for our mains.

Luckily, we're located in Chinatown and the many pizza shops of Little Italy / North Beach are just a step away. We were tempted by a few pizza by the slice joints on our way to check out Il Casaro, but we're glad we opted to discover the pizza here. We got the $13 margarita pizza which was a good amount to share for two. The cheese was fresh, sauce was dribbling, and the basil was aromatic. It's authentic Italian pizza with a wood fire stove that reminded me of Gusta Pizza from when I studied abroad in Florence. The service was friendly (cute waitress!) and I liked that the staff spoke Italian. It's not a super pretentious place, but since it was a bit loud inside we opted to take our pizza to-go and eat it out on the streets while walking around.", "author": "Electra C."}

This spot is casual but feels elegant still. With an open kitchen where you can see the pizza made, the place feels warm and lively but not loud.\n\nThe burrata is excellent and comes with some of their delicious fresh cooked bread (same dough as pizza I believe).

The menu is short and to the point: one salad, a couple of antipasti, and a selection of mozzarella are only a pretext for the main attraction, the pizza. \n\nWith chicory, dandelion greens, and shaved fennel, the insalata ($9.50) is topped with raspa dura (young, full flavored Lodigiano cow'a milk cheese) and dressed with a red wine vinaigrette with fierce acidity. The Napolitana pizza arrives with just the right amount of blistering on the crust. Neither too crispy, nor too chewy, it is just right. With mozzarella, tomato sauce, and spicy sausage, the diavola ($14.75) is pleasantly piquant. Piled high with San Daniete prosciutto, the aptly named prosciutto ($17) is a sight to behold. \n\nService is friendly and well-meaning, but a little slow and confused.  The pizza arrived before the insalata, but otherwise everything else went smoothly. The all Italian wine list is short, but contains ample red and white selections to pair with the cuisine.

I was searching for something, & I thought the Internet could help me find my true match. I opened up my favorite site, Caviar, hoping to find the answer to my dilemma. I began to scroll through the photos, focusing on the \"type\" I was looking for tonight - Italian. Gorgeous photos of pizza were everywhere. But I'd been through so many of them before. Sure, they were fine, but I was sure that tonight I could do better. Some were clearly gold-diggers (Tony & his $45 pizza - yikes). I started to despair. Maybe this whole internet thing just isn't for me. Maybe I should just go old-school and call an old regular.\n\nBut remember, I'm lazy so I persevered. Suddenly, I came upon Il Casaro Pizzeria & Mozzarella Bar. The pictures were all I needed to see, not to mention the elevation of amazing mozzarellas in the very name. It was love at first sight. I could see us in Italy in a beautiful, romantic restaurant. I could use all the Italian words I know: per favore, Grazie, delizioso, formaggio, etc. \n\nArriving early, and not the worse for wear after the indignity of being shoved in a cardboard box for the trip across town, I was blown away by what came through my door. Always wondering if the photos would match the reality, and ladies (& gentlemen!) did it ever. This was the real deal. So, I'm here to say, do yourself a favor & spend an evening with il Casaro.\n\nP.S. I ordered the calzone (San Marzano tomatoes, smoked mozzarella, ham, & mushrooms) and the imported Burrata. Both were outstanding. The arugula & cherry tomato salad w the calzone was a wonderful touch. My only gentle complaint: two small bread pieces with the Burrata was not nearly enough. Maybe at least double that for take-out?", "author": "Fran C."}

But you don't always want just a slice of pizza and you don't always want an expensive sit down experience. This is the perfect in-between. A friend of mine and I just wandered in one day and have been back a few times since! They do simple Italian pizzas that come out pretty fast. Have a decent wine and beer selection. The Buffalo appetizer is soooo yummy. \n\nThe service is great too! Everyone is really friendly and laid back. We went in once right before a Giants WS game and ordered a Margarita pizza. The chef made the cheese into the SF logo because we were clearly big fans. So sweet! 5 stars all around :)", "author": "Mandy A."}

Definitely some of the best Italian I've had.\n\nI went in around 3pm and it was very quiet so service was not lacking.\n\nI ordered the bruschetta and the imported burrata, and was surprised by the portion sizes of each - together it was more than enough food for one person.\n\nThe bruschetta was lovely, sweet red onions, and soft red capsicum and zucchini over velvety ricotta. The crispy, chewy bread was the perfect texture to accompany the soft toppings and wasn't soggy at all.\n\nI would recommend coming here for the imported burrata alone. Absolutely gorgeous. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. It was creamy and silky soft with still a little elasticity.

Finally, one of the kitchen staff members who was cooking right in front of me asked if I had placed my order and I mentioned that the server had taken it. It appears that the server forgot to put in my order which was a reason for the decline in stars in this review.\n\nOverall, the pizza was quite tasty and spot on especially compared to Una Pizza Napoletana for example at the price point.

They have a wood-fired oven which is good.\n\nI got a seat at the counter and enjoyed watching the pizzaiolo make the pizze. It took a while to get a menu and order. I ordered the pizza magrherita and a beer. They have like six beers on tap and two in bottles but the waiter said they were out of all the beers except for Sierra Pale Ale. How can you be out of seven beers?\n\nI saw they were slicing the pizze before delivery. How odd, I thought. So, I leaned toward the glass and told the pizzaiolo that I didn't want my pizza cut. So, naturally, he cut it and handed it to me over the glass. I should have refused it, but I didn't. Big mistake. The reason you don't cut the pizza is so that the soggy middle doesn't seep under the crust and make it soggy and that's exactly what happened. \n\nAlso, for my taste, it was a little too undercooked and doughy. They have a marinara pizza listed with ingredients other that just sauce and garlic. HUH? What kind of marinara pizza is that? \n\nThe price was OK at $13.00 for the pizza and $6.00 for the beer.\n\nThe search continues for authentic Napolitano pizza in San Francisco. Obviously, it's not here and I will never go back.", "author": "Tom T."}

The owner started screaming at him in Italian- so embarrassing for the chef- and the owner didn't stop.. He kept going and going until the man making the pizza walked out.. I have no idea what they were saying but it was incredibly unprofessional and ruined my experience. I understand they want things in a orderly manner but to scream at the man in front of everyone was humiliating and straight bullying. My waitress apologized for my bread being delayed and I said the man yelling was more of a disappointment then my bread taking a few minutes longer.

It turned out they were out of bananas, so they basically brought us a full sized pizza covered in nutella...

Not too shabby!\n\nThe ambiance is a bit modern but not over the top. Inviting but not pretentious. The service itself was attentive and thoughtful.\n\nWe had an appetizer, two pizzas and a glass of wine each. \n\nThe asparagus appetizer was very nice (though a bit overpriced) but the kicker was the shaved parmesan that it was served with. That was OUTSTANDING. They even serve a plate of parmesan shavings for $4, I will get that next time. Never knew parmesan could taste that good!\n\nI asked if I could have some Calabrian chiles with my margerita pizza and the server as confused. She went to ask the kitchen and they nodded yes. When the pizza came out it had two chiles in the middle and a side dish of whole chiles in oil. So delicous!\n\nThe pizza itself was very good. Good sauce, generous fresh fior de latte cheese and the crust while not full of char and bubbles had decent flavor (just how I like it). If I had a gripe I'd say that the sauce was heavy on liquid so caused the center of the pizza to sag and flop - bit of a fail.\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable experience.

I got a margherita which probably isn't as good as the one at Tony's or A16 but definitely good enough and very reasonably priced at $13 compared to $20 at Tony's. But it needs more basil. There were only 2 or 3 little pieces of it. In addition to the usual boring dry chilli pepper flakes, they have whole chillies marinated in oil which is delicious. Their tiramisu was also good. The slice was large enough for two people and had thinly-sliced strawberries on top. \n\nAfter several visits, my feelings about the place is mixed. The quality of pizza assembly is inconsistent. Instead of placing the cheese so that it melts into lilypad-like puddles across the pie, sometimes they put about 20 clumps of it mostly in the center which don't melt enough and slide right off when you pick up a slice. \n\nOn several occasions, I put down a $20 for a $14 check and was asked \"do you need change?\" This has happened with two different servers and I'm not sure whether they were greedy or just boneheaded.\n\nThis could easily become a great place to sit down and have a neapolitan pizza if they had a better staff at the oven and at the tables.", "author": "keith s."}

They said they were going to talk to their manager and get back to the customer to fix it. I came back later on that evening to pick up another order and the manager was there so I checked in with him to make sure that he knew what happened earlier.  I'm a little codependent as well as a former restaurant manager so I thought I would just see if everything worked out for my customer.  I presume it didn't because this manager was a complete tool!!!! He was rude to me!! He didn't want me to wait inside the restaurant for the order that I was picking up and even though it was freezing cold outside he wouldn't tell me how long it was until the order would be ready!! I saw another driver come pull up looking for their order. I got the name for their order and went back in to tell them so they knew that driver was there too. Of course the manager bit my head off and told me \"I told you to wait outside!! Get out of my face\"!!  So I went back to my car and swallowed my pride I was parked directly in front of the door and then he came out 12 minutes later to bring me the order and had the nerve to say to me \"I told you to wait outside the door I don't have time to deliver things to your car!!  Its not my fault you're parked illegally!!\" Yeah because the four feet extra are you had to walk to step off the sidewalk and walk directly out front of your door to my car window is so time consuming! !! Wow I don't know what kind of customer service skills he was trained with but I wouldn't talk to an ex that showed up at a restaurant I was managing that poorly!!! I'm  providing a service to them and I'm   not employed by them!!  So you would think he would be a little nicer! I work for sidecar who's given a lot of these small businesses an opportunity to expand their business and do deliveries without having to pay for a full time or part time delivery driver they can't afford! !!

This place blew my mind and tastebuds away, hopefully they will come back. I just came back from Naples, Italy and literally had the best pizza in my life. It was a struggle coming back to the states knowing the same pizza would be difficult to find. But Il Casaro delivers - I had the Bufalina which is just tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella, basil, and olive oil - plain and simple but that's what makes it so good is that the natural flavors of all these ingredients stand out so well. When it was served to me, I went straight for the middle which is how they do it in Italy because its supposed to be the soupy delicious part from all the sauce. It passed the test.

My girlfriend and I had the olives (amazing), house-made buffalo mozzerella (really good), a margherita pie (delicious) and a marinara pie (also tasty). \n\nEverything was good. I only gave 3 stars for a couple reasons:\n\n1. Pricey--13 bucks for a small pie is too much\n2. Although the dough was great, it was a bit undercooked in the crust of our first pie. I'd totally take that over having it over done, and it was still delicious, so it's not a big deal.\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience. We'll likely be back.", "author": "Steve B."}

As we approached there was a short line. When we asked we were informed that there was about a 30 minute wait so we put our names on the list. Reviews were good and 30 minutes didn't seem that long. However, we waited almost an hour outside. We inquired twice and we're told only a few more minutes.  There were limited options around so we were pretty limited. That's why we waited. After being sat, 52 minutes later, the hostess took our drink order. We then waited another 10 minutes with not even water delivered. I then inquired about the mozzarella and was told she needed to ask another employee. We waited another 5 plus minutes before we just walked out. On a late Monday night I'm sure this place was busy for a reason, but I'll never know due to the poor customer service. When you watch 2 men that seem to either work or own the place just walking around laughing and drinking instead of helping the staff you tend to get impatient and irritated.

Quickly discovered why there was a line out the door here. The owner/manager was so nice and got us in as fast as possible (probably a 25 minute wait on a busy Saturday night). The staff was so attentive and nice and authentic (our waiter was 100% Italiano and recommended our wine). Got a bottle of great wine, the olives, burrata, croquettes (because they ran out of arancini - understandably) and the Calabrese pizza all for $84. Not only is that an incredible deal but the food was phenomenal. Everything we ate tasted better than than the last.

The service was both fast and friendly.  My husband and I especially liked the bus boy.  He was super friendly and attentive.  Prices are reasonable with our tab including tip hovering right around $30.00.  We chose the table next to the front window so that we could \"people watch\" as we ate.

It's very well-balanced, and allows allows it's ingredients to shine. A lot of other pizza joints, particularly American pizza places, love piling on the toppings. Sometimes that works and sometimes you may crave a pizza like that, but overall I feel like that style of pizza is overpowering and takes away from the fine balance that pizza should have. Il Casaro does an amazing job of showcasing it's excellent mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil on an even more excellent crust. Also, I love the little spicy peppers they give you.

In this restaurant on our last night in SF, we had a fantastic dinner of creamy, fresh Burratta served on dressed arugula with wood fired, crispy bread, castelvetrano olives, roasted asparagus with shaved Parmesan, and a margherita pizza, all greedily washed down with icy cold Peronis.  This dinner couldn't have been better.  It's the first pizza we've had that is equal to Gusto's pizza in Florence, Italy.  Piping hot, the fresh mozzarella perfectly melted, the crust charred and crispy on the outside but chewy and delicious inside.  It was just the absolute best pizza we've eaten in the US.

We placed our wine order, which came out in a timely fashion and was pretty good, but when we put in our pizza order, they forgot to make it....twice. After about 40 minutes or so, we asked the server (who was also the hostess) how much longer it would take. Since the kitchen is open air so everyone can see in, we witnessed a brief, yet terse argument between our server and the kitchen staff. She came back and said it should be only a few more minutes, but it was pretty obvious they forgot to make it. After about another 30 minutes or so, still no pizza. We flagged down our server and asked AGAIN how long it would be. She went back for fight-with-kitchen-staff #2, which was in plain view. She came back and said it would just be a few minutes, but they clearly forgot to make it....again. It finally came out about 5-10 minutes later and the dough was clearly undercooked. If you're going to take over an hour to make a damn pizza, at least make it right. This place could be a good pizza joint; the chef knew what he was doing with the dough and the pizzas certainly had potential, but there was a severe lack of communication between the serving staff and the kitchen staff that makes this place a real mess. To make matters even worse, the server didn't offer to comp anything. She didn't even apologize. There is no excuse for that.", "author": "Mike L."}
