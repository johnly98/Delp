I heard about it by word of mouth from some man I helped shoot a short film with. I have been to Chloe's in Noe Valley. And you could get your egg scramble at Crepevine. Well, the outdoor seating is cute and nice on a nice day. And so that's what I ended up with. I was solo. I went around noon 12pm and it was pretty busy. There's gonna be a line with names on the board. I snagged my outdoor table first come first served. \n\nAnd then I decided I had to try the virgin Bloody Mary and have an Italie scramble with potatoes and white toast. The scramble had tomatoes and rare cheese, but I didn't even eat one chunk of cheese at the end. I didn't finish one piece of bread either.

It was a beautiful day and colleagues spoke very highly of Zazie's weekend brunch menu. It's important to arrive early, especially on Sunday. Zazie opens at 9:00 am and there will be a wait. We arrived at 9:05 am and there was already several families outside waiting. Each party has to sign up on a paper sheet indicating your eating preference (outside or inside) and how many in your party. Zazie has a small eating area both in the front and the back of the establishment. Our waiter, Adam, was knowledgeable and very friendly. He did a great job providing recommendations as our server! We ordered the following:\n1. Divorcee Eggs Benedict\n2. Two Egg Special with chicken sausage, potatoes, and wheat toast\n3. One pancake with Bacon\nThe food was really good.

On a foggy weekday morning, we were the second party in line for a table as all tables inside were occupied.  After a few minutes, we were seated at a table in the back of the front dining room (didn't know at the time, but there is a rear dining area too).  After studying the menu, we quickly ordered and I tried the following:\n\nDouble lemon coffee cake, shared (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=fBbKmNCAiOOu3f8igDlKJQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Not really shared as my friend took one bite and found this too sweet.  I enjoyed it though I caution that it's not for the health conscious diner.\n\nMiracle Pancake, shared (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=yEYSJtcyrbK7AVOr2IyvoA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - This was interesting and, from afar, it almost looks like a large Danish.  This had a nice chew and the lemon curd and strawberries were enough flavor.  We did not use the offered syrup at all.\n\nScrambled eggs Mexico (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SC667wwZ0I6bBPU0PFYTzQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Debating between this and the Fontainbleau, the salsa tipped the scale for me.  This was pretty good though the oil from the chorizo made this a bit saltier than I hoped.\n\nService was efficient and not particularly warm which is to be expected given the popularity of the restaurant and the lines here.  The tables in the main dining room are arranged pretty tightly so it's probably not a good place to close a business deal or discuss your most intimate thoughts.  We were in and out of the restaurant at just under an hour.  Do come early as, on another attempt to dine here, the line was quite long.  Hope to return again and try some of their other menu offerings.\n\n*** Recently dining here again, I forgot to mention the menu prices already includes gratuity for the staff.", "author": "Mike C."}

This is some of the best brunch food the city has to offer and the restaurant is cute.\n\nThis review is aimed towards our server who I believed is named Sarah Jane, whom was our server yesterday morning. Now no one will know what went through Sarah's mind when this occurred and admittedly this could simply be BAD service. And we do live in a hypersensitive environment, however if it was racism then there is zero tolerance for that in this city. Racism can be subtle, it can infest our lives and poison our thoughts. In this case we have reason to believe the actions of Sarah Jane have led us to believe she had unfavorable service towards us, we were a table of 2 Asians. \n\n1. She refused to simply take a photo of my friend and I having brunch, claiming she was too busy. Not a big deal and very understandable, right? However, she promptly and happily volunteered to take the photo of a Caucasian family literally at our neighboring table!!! WTF\n2. She, asked us where we were from, also not a big deal. But why ask if you have no intention of making small talk or other bs, and simply and blankly walk away.\n3. She conveniently forgot to refill our water, when we verbally asked for a refill. Also, not a big deal, maybe she's just a bad server. But maybe not! \n\nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

It was a very nice area with natural light and fresh air, and a lively atmosphere, perfect for good conversations and aesthetic pictures. \n\n\nOur server was very nice, but a bit slow. We waited almost ten minutes before we got his attention to take our orders. We ended up getting the French toast Tahiti, special mix pancakes, and a side of potatoes. Everything we ordered was delicious. The pancakes were super fluffy and soft and the potatoes were tasty. \n\nThe only con about this place is probably the price and service. I understand that the food is very good, but $11 for a piece of bread and puree is pretty expensive. However, tips are factored in, so it kind of makes up for it. It also took forever to get one of the server's attention because they were constantly coming and going to bring food and seat people. \n\nKnowing that I will always have to wait when I come to eat, to be seated and to get the server's attention, it'll be a while before I come back again.", "author": "Kristine P."}

On a Sunday morning, we finally made our way over here. After about 45 minutes of looking for parking and waiting for a table, we were finally seated inside. Note that there's a couple tables in front that's first come, first serve.\n\nI ordered the Divorcee Benedict ($21) with 2 eggs and half/half on the salad and home fries (actually potatoes). The benedicts were topped with bacon, avocados, and fontina cheese over English muffins, which was a great combination of ingredients especially with a perfectly poached egg. This was actually quite filling to me that I was hardly able to eat the Pancake Flight ($19) we ordered to share. This sweet dish came with 1 buttermilk, 1 ginger, and 1 french toast. Unfortunately, this dish fell short and I was rather disappointed in the flavor and texture --hard pass.\n\nOverall, good brunch spot though.

Pretty good but not as good as I had anticipated perhaps??? \n\nI liked the French toast significantly more than the La mer. Given the wait time and price point I was conflicted between three and four stars . After  I was seated it took the server quite awhile to greet me and take my order which Im typically not too picky on but it was longer than normal at similar venues. \n\nSo an improvement on the wait system and taking the orders when inside was the determining factor of my 3.5 star review being bumped down to a 3.

However, I finally went today and realized they have a good system in place: you put your name in line, get an estimate (approx 1 hr for brunch) and then you can wait at the bar next door having a drink until you're called. \n\n1st Visit (Indoor Seating) \nBefore we knew it, we were escorted inside into the French Bistro next to a winding iron staircase (loved it!). \n\nThere were lots of mimosas to choose from- I got The Magical Mimosa which had a scoop of peach sorbet and mint syrup. Very nice!\n\nWe also ordered the day's special omelette stuffed with bacon, mushrooms, and brie. It came with a side of soft, buttery garlic house potatoes that barely required chewing. \n\nNext was a very cheesy, creamy croque monsieur with a side salad. \n\nFor dessert we ordered an exquisite lemon ricotta pancake with lemon curd.\n\nThe service was fantastic and the food was served in neat, generous portions. \n\nI would definitely come back to try the mango mimosa w tajin rim and the extensive selection of Benedicts. \n\n2nd Visit (Patio Seating)\n\nThe patio is both beautiful and romantic! It didn't feel as crowded as eating indoors and the tables were a little bigger. \n\nThis time, I had the spicy mango mimosa with tajin rim and another one with a blooming rose at the bottom which made it look pretty and taste wonderful.\n\nSince it was during the fall, I got to try some yummy seasonal dishes like the French Toast Tahiti, which was like a Bananas Foster with caramelized bananas, a Pumpkin Pie Pancake served with a dollop of pie on top, and a pumpkin latte! So GOOOOD!\n\nThere were so many benedicts to choose from, but we settled on the Monaco- with Prosciutto & Tomato with lemon Hollandaise sauce. Very tasty. \n\nSo now, this place is Two for Two! I love this place and it's totally worth the wait. \n\nAn added plus- the restaurant is Tip Free.

Everything from the service, food, wine, atmosphere, cleanliness, etc. - it was all wonderful. On the top of their (dinner) menu it reads \"All of our menu prices include a living wage, revenue share, paid family leave, fully funded health & dental insurance, paid time off, and a 401(k) with employer match for all of our hard working employees.\" I really think this helps the staff relax about whether they are doing well enough to get a good tip, which I think dramatically improves their level of service. Our server was so nice and funny, and he really gave us great service for the 2 hours we were there. We even tried to tip him more at the end but they wouldn't let us! 'Tips are included.' \n\nI ordered the Etxea Rose after asking for a dry Rose, and it was great. I then moved to the Tablas Creek red wine, which was also delicious! Everyone received a warm bun after sitting down which was a nice touch and start to the meal. We ordered the mussels marinieres to start - super creamy and yummy, followed by the French onion soup. I wish the soup had a stronger onion flavor but it was still great regardless. I then ordered the Moroccan lamb tagine as my entree and wow was it good. Slowly braised lamb stew with eggplant, tomato, almond, and served over couscous, and it was extremely hot when it came out which I appreciated. Just because I know it didn't sit at all after they finished preparing it. I ended with the vanilla creme brulee which was perfectly baked, although I didn't feel like the strawberries on top added anything to it. They were just cut up and sitting on top of the brulee and I felt like they didn't go with the dessert BUT they were fresh and I ate them before digging into the creme brulee so it all worked out fine.\n\nI can't wait to come back on their Tuesday no corkage night, and I will definitely be coming back multiple times over.\n\nThe restaurant is always busy so I highly recommend that you make reservations rather than just drop in.", "author": "Bri T."}

Buddy, lemme tell you the difference it makes. The Portobello mushroom and tomato within were unabashedly garlicky. If you choose the fries instead of the salad, you'll be rewarded with gorgeously crispy potatoes and FRIED GARLIC. I LOVE garlic. I LOVE crunchy things.

It was a nice day outside so we walked around. We finally got seated in the front booth area (which is a little awkward because it's right in the window). We started with a few of the mojitos (wow, they have quite an extensive selection) and the seasonal cinnamon roll. The roll was fantastic, soft, moist and flavorful. The service was a little inattentive (probably didn't help that we were way in the front of the restaurant in the window/nook area. \n\nI ordered the eggs vincent. The dish was good, it was essentially polenta (which I'm typically a fan of). My sister was a huge fan of her eggs benedict. The brunch menu is quite extensive, especially the eggs benedict section if you're a fan of that dish. I'm not sure if this place was good enough to warrant a visit back with a wait of that caliber (maybe 30m?). It was also relatively expensive - probably because they offer incredible benefits for their employees and they're tip free. I'd recommend giving this place a shot if you're in the area and trying it out for yourself.", "author": "Katie Y."}

It is a super cute restaurant with a really great ambiance. It would make a cute date spot for sure. They also include tips in all of their pricing so there is no need to tip at the end.\n\nThey have a great selection of wine and have really really tasty mimosa combinations and I'm not talking about your typical traditional mimosas these have wonderful exotic flavors. For dinner I ordered the Le Canard Piallat which was a beautifully cooked duck leg served with potato salad and haricots verts. It was simply delicious! We then opted to all share a dessert and we chose the Le Deux Cremes. It was a chocolate pot de creme and creme brulee. Both were very rich and super yummy. \n\nOverall, I definitely want to go back to Zazie, I definitely want to hit it up for brunch. The service was great and the food was amazing!

We appreciated the wall art decor and the personalized Zazie magnets posted everywhere. \n\nOur waitress was peppy and charismatic. I love that about a place; it helps bring that community atmosphere. We also appreciate the fact that Zazie offers their employees full benefits and proper wages. They do not require a tip at this place!\n\nOur food came out and we were ready to eat! My dish was essentially a cheese sandwhich, with blackforest ham and an egg on top.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-22", "description": "When you look up best brunches in SF, you'll notice that Zazie is consistent across MANY if not all of the articles, blogs, etc. I feel like I've had Zazie bookmarked for a while but being in Cole Valley I really had to set some time up to come check it out for weekend brunch. \n\nPRO TIP: If you don't care for waiting, grab any of the open tables in the front of the restaurant because they are first come first serve. We came at around 10:30 aka peak brunch time, but we luckily nabbed one of the tables in front and avoided the 1.5hr + wait time. While this is also a pro there's also a reason why they do this - it can get hot on a sunny day because they don't have any cover or umbrellas out front for shade. So if you're willing to do this option definitely slather on that sunscreen. \n\nFUN FACT: Zazie is tip free because their menu prices include a living wage, PTO, etc for their employees. Makes the not ridiculously crazy price tag sound even better right? \n\nTheir menu itself if quite extensive ranging from starters, eggs any style, eggs benedicts, scrambled egg dishes, griddle dishes, soups, salads, and their plats du jour which is constantly changing. Needless to say the menu is quite egg-cellent. What's great about Zazie too is that they price based on how many eggs, griddles, etc you want in variables 1, 2, and 3 so prices can be as low as $9 and as high as $38.\n\nI ended up getting the the 2 Albert Benedict (bacon, white cheddar, salsa fresca) w/home fries for $21. I thought the portions were decent for the price and the quality was there. The bacon was crispy, cheddar melted, and eggs yolky enough. The home fries are the clear winner though especially with the chunks of garlic mixed in. If you're in a drinking mood try the spicy mango mimosa - basically a mangonada for breakfast!\n\nCan't complain about our service experience here either. Our waiter was attentive and he never made us feel like we weren't taken care of in the front of the restaurant. All in all, not a shabby first time here at this infamous SF brunch spot. Next time I'll be sure to actually walk through the place and see the inside and outside patio in the back.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

So many options on the menu, everything sounds so good- from omelet, pancakes, to American style breakfast. Drinks are good too. Price is bit on the higher end but that's because tips and taxes are included as part of the total price so no additional tips necessary.  I recommend sitting in the patio if weather is good outside.

They also take reservations for dinner, and probably walk ins too (it wasn't too crowded).  Anyways we started with a grilled fig toast with goat cheese & arugula which was sweet and savory.  For dinner we had the lamb tagine, hanger steak and pork chop.  While all dishes were good, the real winner is the pork chop.  It's thick and juicy and comes with a kale, mint cous cous.  In my opinion it is a rival to Nopa's chop.  We ordered the lemon mouse and rotating cobbler.  THE COBBLER WAS AMAZING! We got it with gelato but it would have been better with the cream.

But I was determined to wait it out, so my friend and I killed some time by grabbing coffee at the Peet's nearby, and then we hovered around Zazie's entrance for the remainder of the time. \n\nFinally our names were called after an hour or so, which was faster than I was expecting.The space inside was bigger than I thought, as there is not only a regular seating area but a patio all the way in the back. I only caught a glimpse of the patio as I was going to the bathroom, but it looked really cute.\n\nFood wise, my friend and I decided to each get a savory item and share a french toast. I ended up with the Eggs Fontainbleau ($16), which is scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms and spinach. I know you're probably thinking, how good could scrambled eggs be, it's just scrambled eggs! But I was in love with the eggs here.They were so soft and fluffy and not overcooked at all; And I don't know how they prepare their potatoes, but it was perfectly seasoned and soft on the inside but surprisingly crunchy on the outside. Both of us were pretty obsessed with the potatoes as well.\n\nMy friend ordered one of their benedicts, which they're known for, and commented that their lemon hollandaise sauce was very light compared to the other hollandaise sauces that she's had.\n\nThe french toast was also good but not as mind blowing as the savory dishes were for us. This could've been because we ate it last, so it had been sitting on the table getting cold for a while before we dug in?\n\nAlso I LOVE that for a lot of their dishes, you can choose your portion size. Not too many places in SF will let you only order one benedict or three if you're feeling extra hangry from the wait :P\n\nOur server Megan was amazing. Upon learning it was our first time at Zazie, she gave us a rundown of the most popular items on the menu and was just super helpful in general. I also really appreciated the fact that despite how busy the restaurant is and how many people are waiting outside, I never once felt rushed. She first grabbed our drink orders, and then came back and asked for our food orders instead of doing everything at once.\n\nParking wasn't too bad. I was able to find a spot two blocks away on a residential street pretty easily.\n\nAll in all, this was one of the best brunches I've had yet in the city, and I definitely want to come back, maybe try to get patio seating next time?", "author": "Dianna H."}

We got here at about 10 am and waited about about an hour to get seated. If there is only two of you, the outdoor seating before you go inside the restaurant is first come, first serve (you don't have to signup on the waitlist). You either have a choice to sit inside, out in the front or out in the garden (back of the restaurant-- which is such a cute outdoor area). \n\nThe first thing we noticed when we got the menu is that the food is a few dollars more than what you would typically see at a brunch place. All of their menu prices include a living wage, revenue share, paid family leave, fully funded health & dental insurance, paid time off, and a 401(k) with employer match for their hard working employee-- which is amazing.Servers/workers in restaurants don't get paid enough for the work they do or people aren't generous enough to tip even when the service is phenomenal. Since they have this tips are not expected. \n\nMy bf and I ordered La Mer and the french toast Tahiti. Both are so delicious-- perfect combination or sweet & savory. \n\nThe reason I'm giving this place a 4/5 is because of a few reasons:\n1) Completely understand that the menu is a little more pricey because they want to make sure the employees are compensated. However, all of the items are a little more than average price. If a person were to order an appetizer,entree, side, and a drink... the costs to compensate definitely adds up. The French toast Tahiti was about $20 and the La Mer for two eggs was almost $30 \n2) Depending on the weather and where you sit, you can smell the garbage in the garden area.", "author": "Hazel R."}

Personally I think the 1 hour wait for a table for two seriously detracts from the experience, especially because there is zero seating outside and you just have to stand outside in a line trying not to get too jealous of those seated outside eating in front of you. Other places like Plow have wait seating that is separate from the outside tables.\n\nWith that said, the food and service is impeccable. I had a Florentine Eggs Benedict which was very tasty, my girlfriend had an omelette with a huge latte, and we shared a pumpkin pancake. Everything was served on cute plateware in a cozy restaurant with servers with great attitudes and service. Plus there is a zero tip and the servers are paid a living wage. Probably why the servers are so pleasant.

The restaurant is pretty small with 4 two seater tables in the front (good for people with pets), some seat insides, and some seats in the heated patio in the back. Definitely not recommended for a party of 5+. There's a tiny unisex restroom. There isn't much walking space inside the restaurant since they try to cram as much seats as possible. The staff is super friendly and attentive. The meals are pretty pricey but that's because the restaurant pays their employees full benefits, so they encourage their customers to not tip.", "author": "Sylvia H."}

It's a small little place and I believe they have a garden out back. From the small glimpse I got, the garden looked beautiful and I am sure it was because there was a wedding reception going on. \n\nThere was quite a wait to be seated inside. You sign your name in and they will call your name when there are seats. I recommend coming here for a lunch date for 2 to 4 people. Seating is pretty small and mostly for 2. They can put tables together, but I'm sure the wait would be a little longer. The seating in the front of the restaurant is first come first serve, so you don't have to put your name down for it. Just grab the table as soon as you see someone get up. \n\nThe service is amazing. The staff always checked on us.  Boyfriend got a omelette. It was the special for the day. It was filled with sausage, mushrooms and some other things. I was too focused on my food to remember his. It was tasty though. Food wasn't too salty. The omelette did have a little run in the middle, but my boyfriend lives for that. I got the crab Benedict. It was delicious! You can ask for 1 or 2 eggs. It comes with a side of salad. They do not skimp you on the crab meat. It's pretty light and the salad goes really well, which left room for all the sweets I ordered. \n\nWe got French toast Tahiti and miracle pancakes. You get to choose how many slices of French toast or pancake you want. The French toast came with caramelized bananas and in between the slices of toast there were some crushed walnuts mixed in cinnamon. It was pretty delicious. Definitely got my French toast fix. Appreciated that it wasn't that sweet and that the center of my French toast wasn't a soggy texture. The pancakes though!!! The miracle pancakes are really a miracle. It had poppy seeds and a lemon sauce with strawberries! It was freaking to die for. It's perfection! It's everything! I believe it was part of the special menu. I'd go back just for that! I'd go back for all of that! \n\nAs for the drinks, I got the chai tea with almond milk. It comes in a big ol' bowl! Loved every bit of it. It wasn't too sweet and it was just right. The boyfriend got the lemonade soda thing. It was just the right amount of tang, but my drink was greater than his drink. \n\nOverall, really great experience.

I'd definitely wait for the patio if I were you.\n\nTo start, I ordered the spicy mango mimosa that has a tajin rim and OMG.  This drink is first of all gorgeous and totally IG worthy.

I would definitely recommend this mimosa -- it's super unique and fun.\n\nI also ordered the special pumpkin latte, which was so delicious!  This latte legit comes in a bowl - like a bowl lol.  It's pretty big, and you have to drink out of it while holding it with both hands.  Loved it.\n\nI order another mimosa, but I sadly don't remember what it is called!  Our server recommended it to me because it's red and it comes with a flower that looks like a rose that sits on the bottom of the glass.  It was very \"beauty and the beast\" looking -- so IG worthy and delicious.  \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the \"french toast tahiti\" - which is stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts.  YUM.  This dish is beautiful and delicious -- definitely recommend.  \n\nI also ordered the \"monaco eggs benedict\" -- which caught my eye because it has prosciutto.  I love that you can select how many eggs you want - 1,2, or 3 -- because I can never finish two, so this was perfect.\n\nOur server was great, the venue is cute, the food is delicious and IG worthy.

I ordered from the pre fixe meal, which i thought was a great deal. You get an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $39. I ordered the mussels for an appetizer, and oh boy, delicious. The sauce that they have the mussels in was so good, definitely sopped up all the extra sauce with the bread they give you. Next, was the trout. This was also good, it came with ratatouille on top of the fish and a generous portion of wild rice on the side. Last up was the dessert. I really wanted their chocolate lava style cake for dessert, but that wasn't on the pre fixe menu, but with an upcharge you could definitely exchange it. OMG so chocolatey and delicious! Also, the server overheard it was my birthday, so she added a little candle which was really sweet. Also, the service we received was so great. When we first got there we waited for a table outside, for not a considerably long time, but for the wait, they offered us a free glass of champagne.

My dining companion shared his home fries with me and they were super flavorful -- cooked with whole cloves of garlic, yum!\n\nThis is such a cute, cozy restaurant that serves up a stellar brunch.

Zazie just seems pretty ordinary. And the dishes weren't even completely warm when we got them so... The service was not very attentive. The waiting process was ridiculous (their estimate was off by a lot so we didn't come back in time and missed our spot and had to put our names down again -- took us 2.5 hours for a table of 4).

We were seated right away, with our choice of indoor or outdoor seating, which was lovely. I mean, this is expected for a Tuesday anyway, right? Anyway, my friend and I ordered food within 10 mins of getting there. We didn't receive our food until 11:40am!!!! Omg. Mind you, the restaurant is only 50% full of customers. So basically, half empty.\n\nNot only that, but the food was disappointing. I ordered the Genevieve scramble, which comes with black forest ham, white cheddar, and haas avocados, with your choice of toast and home fries or salad. To be honest, the scramble was too watery and cheesy. A weird combo. Usually avocados can save the day, but they barely put any. Maybe 1/4 of a small avocado. The home fries were too crispy, slightly burnt. \n\nThe service was frustrating. Yes, they were extremely friendly and seemed to love their job. However, why the hell did it take half an hour to get our food?! The whole restaurant was NOT even slammed at all. It seemed like the cooks in the back were on their 30 min lunch break. And why did it take another hour to get our check?! I wish they were more attentive to us. I don't know WHY they AUTOMATICALLY include service charge when their service is ABSOLUTE CRAP. \n\nIf I am paying for your health insurance, and automatic tip, I expect top of the line service. It says on their website that, \"All of our menu prices include a living wage, revenue share, paid family leave, fully funded health & dental insurance, paid time off, and a 401(k) with employer match for all of our hard working employees.\"\n\nI should have complained that their employees are NOT hard working. It is employees like these that expect high wages, great benefits, for sitting on their butts while working. I know another job for them; it's called an office job.

The interior of the restaurant makes you feel like you've been transported to France. It's adorable decorated  and has a very cozy atmosphere.  We asked to sit on the back patio, and if the weather is good I totally recommend it! It's a small space cloaked in vines and greenery, and it's absolutely beautiful. The perfect spot for a nice quiet brunch.\n\nVegetarian options:  There were quite a few yummy options to pick from.  To avoid having to decide my friend and I decided to share the Eggs Vincent (grilled corn cake with spinach, avocados, spicy goat cheese, and poached eggs) and Fresh Lemon Ricotta raviolis.  The flavors were simple but well balanced, and it was overall a yummy meal.  I do wish the portions were slightly larger for the prices, but otherwise I had no issues with the food.\n\nCocktails:  I would definitely recommend this place if you like mimosas with your brunch because the widest range of options and some of the most unusual placer combos I have ever seen.  They infuse their mimosas with flavors like mint and elderflower, and instead of using juice they add small scoops of sorbet. So refreshing! We ordered the special \"Magic Mimosa\" which contained mint and green apple sorbet, and it was so delicious! They will even let you customize the flavor of your mimosa. The options are endless.\n\nService:  The staff was nice and attentive, and the service was all-around very quick.\n\nI'll be keeping this spot in mind for the next time I'm in this part of the city.

The brunch at Zazie is second to none; they have a fantastic selection of sweet and savory dishes, with rotating specials that are always worth considering. Their Bloody Mary is spicy and flavorful, and the home fries are a perfect mix of crunchy and salty, with roasted garlic mixed in. My favorite dishes are the New York scramble (with lox, green onions, and cream cheese) and the Salade Ni\u00e7oise (perfectly seared tuna and very fresh veggies). If you are indecisive, get the Un Deux Trois with a miracle pancake and a side of fresh fruit.\n\nBecause it is San Francisco, you can expect a significant wait for weekend brunch. That's okay; Cole Valley is super cute. Put your name on the list and walk north to Ice Cream Bar (sundaes before brunch are totally acceptable, don't tell me otherwise). If there's a long wait and the weather is nice, you will probably even have time to walk to Tank Hill Park and back.\n\nDon't overlook Zazie for dinner either.

They have a great outdoor back patio, and as such get quite busy - even on a weekday. I've only been for brunch so that's what I'll talk about. \n\nThey are a tip less restaurant, which I know - some people  are really for and some people are really against. But whatever your view is on the topic, when looking at the prices, when they look high to start, remember you won't leave tip (and if you were going to leave 18-20% like you should it's pretty comparable). \n\nI got the omelette du jour which was quite good! Bacon, arugula, carmalized onion and goat cheese. Delicious combo and plenty of all the fillings. I like their potatoes because they have whole roasted garlic cloves in them. \n\nThe Benedicts are fun too because you can order one, two, or three eggs.

They are known for brunch - but you have to try Zazzie's for dinner. \n\nService was spectacular.  Prompt delivery of food and drinks, with friendly chatting.  \n\nFood - we had a simple salad with goat cheese, the polenta squares, and white trout.  The polenta sat in an awesome tomato based sauce.  The trout was cooked perfectly.   Lemon cake to share - incredibly good.  \n\nWe sat outside on the patio under the canvas cover on a night when it rained - monsoon-like rain.  The wind blew rain onto us diners. We didn't get too wet and it added to the outdoor patio experience.  If its raining, shoes your seats wisely. \n\nI highly recommend Zazzie's.  \n\nAn economic note - Zazzie's advertises that it pays its staff a living wage, provides medical and retirement benefits and so on.  They do not have a tip line on the CC bills.  No tipping.  I like that Zazie's has built a business model that charges an amount to pay for staff benefits and a wage that does not require tipping.  I did not consider the cost of the meal to be out of line with other SF restaurants.  I do not like when restaurants (like some in, for example, San Mateo) add a surcharge to the bill to cover minimum wage increases or other mandated costs.  This is a cost of doing business in a city and state that has decided to be \"progressive\" and the restaurant has chosen to do business there.  They should all do as Zazie's has done - get over it and charge what is necessary to make a restaurant in a high cost of living location work.  I applaud how Zazie's is making the economics of having a business in SF work for them and their staff.", "author": "Raymond M."}

Since it is prime brunch time, we ended up waiting for a little over an hour to get seated and maybe another 20 to 30 minutes to get our food.\n\nAll of us ordered some variation of the eggs benedict, but I was really impressed with the St. Trop or the smoked salmon. I also really like how you could customize the size of your order. Because I wasn't too hungry, I just got one eggs benedict with home fries. Their hollandaise sauce is not too creamy and light, so it doesn't feel like a heavy meal. The home fries are exceptional potatoes with fried garlic. They are super crispy. The lemon pancakes are also some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The flavor of the pancakes was subtle, but the lemon curd really brings it home and the tartness of the raspberry just makes it even better!

I feel like most restaurants have dry, crumbly home fries just to take up space on the plate, but these were SO GOOD. They were golden brown and crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. The seasoning and garlic really hit it out of the ball park. They even had some roasted garlic with the potatoes. So so decadent.

This is a solidly 4 star brunch joint, but because of that, I actually don't think it's worth making the effort to go to.\n\nI'll start with my knocks. First, it's kind of out of the way. Cole Valley isn't one of the hot areas in the city to visit, so you probably will have to make a specific trip to get here. Second, the wait is very long. We arrived around 10AM to see many people milling about outside in the sun. Our wait for 2 ended up being about 2 hours. Third, it is a small restaurant, so it's a bit cramped inside, and because of the wait, there's enough social pressure to hustle along.\n\nDespite all of those qualifiers, the actual meal was great. The service was friendly, and the menu is standard American brunch fare with a few twists. The menu allows you to order pretty much everything in 1s, 2s, or 3s (e.g. eggs, french toast), and they have a few daily offerings in addition to their regular menu, so you have reasons to go back. We ended up splitting the Tahitian french toast and eggs benedict. Both were delicious, and with 2 pieces each, we were plenty full. Oh, and their home fries are delicious.

Our server was friendly enough, and the interior is well-lit with interesting decor.\n\nThis place seems to get a lot of hype for brunch and I must admit I don't quite understand why - while I enjoyed my meal, there wasn't anything exceptional about it that warranted the wait.", "author": "Oliver L."}

They have outdoor seating up front on a first come first serve basis and a back patio that's very nice. I sat by myself in the front and enjoyed my Smoked Salmon Benedict so much under the sun. It was delicious and my drink was awesome.  There's a very tasty and creative cocktail menu. They allow you to choose one, two, or three of eggs of Benedict! I think that is great because sometimes I'm more hungry than other days. They treat their employees well with a good benefits package. Their prices include the tip so you don't have to add one unless you want to bump it. This makes it easy for splitting the bill with a big group. They do actually accommodate small to large groups even at lunch/brunch time. The dude makes it happen.

NOTE: If you have an appointment or some schedule to keep to, you might want to skip it, it's a long and somewhat unpredictable wait even on weekdays. This is also NOT a place to visit with a group size larger than 4.\n\nIt's pretty cramped and small inside, guests have to shuffle around as new guests come and go. It's busy and bustling so the noise quotient is on the higher end, which may not be to everyone's liking. \n\nThe menu is pretty standard fare, with fresh/zesty spins on traditional items. I ordered the Mexican mocha and tuna sandwich off the brunch menu. The mocha arrived in a ceramic bowl, piping hot and sprinkled with just the right amount of cinnamon on top. The tuna sandwich was fresh, crisp, and bursting with flavor and hit the spot. Don't leave without trying the jam sitting in a jar on your table, you'll regret it, trust me.

I was a little skeptical at the seemingly steep price, but I soon did not care for anything. The bread was cut into thick slices which were slightly crispy on the outside and extremely soft on the inside. There was a banana mash mixture with walnuts as a filling sandwiched between the two pieces, slices of fresh banana on top, a mini metal pitcher of syrup, and a dusting of powdered sugar. Drizzle some syrup over it all, cut a piece of the toast, layer on some banana mash, and complete the perfect bite with a fresh banana. Honestly some of the best french toast I have eaten. Not so sure about the savory items, but I hope to be back!\n\nIt's a very warm atmosphere - waiters are extremely friendly and they truly care. One table adjacent to me asked their waiter where the best donuts were, and he proceeded to relay his own suggestions, as well as going to the back to as a cook for some more suggestions. The lady sitting in front of me seemed to be a regular and was welcomed by who I believe was the manager, and they had a nice exchange.\n\nBy the time I left around 11:30am, there was a line of hopefuls waiting patiently for some tasty brunch food.", "author": "Gina L."}

Zazie doesn't take reservations for brunch, so the wait can easily be over an hour. Pro tip to cut down the wait - get there at 8:30-8:45am at the latest for weekend brunch. You'll end up waiting until they open at 9, but it's likely that you'll end up getting seated in the first round when they open. I also don't recommend coming with a group of more than 4 unless you want to wait forevs.\n\nNow on to the food. My two favorites are the Albert benedict and the miracle pancakes. The benedicts come with their house potatoes which are AMAZING. They come with baked cloves of garlic which are a dream for garlic lovers like me. I normally don't like pancakes but Zazie's miracle pancakes are the exception. The flavor changes according to what's in season, but they're always incredible.\n\nAs most people have also said, Zazie is tip-free so the price you see on the menu you pay (plus tax).

They cook them along with garlic cloves, which become nice and soft afterward. \n\nOverall, Zazie is a wonderful brunch place. Prices are a little high, but the experience is quite pleasant.

I think this in itself is enough to describe the experience I had at Zazie. But it wouldn't be a very good review...\n\nAHHH Zazie has been on my list for the LONGEST time. My friend and I were walking around Cole Valley trying to find the establishment, and right as we were about to pull up Google Maps, we saw a hella long line...without a question, we knew we'd found our destination. It was a Monday morning (holiday), and the line was sooooooo long!! We put our name on the list, and ultimately, I think it took close to 2 hours to be seated?? You can specify where you want to sit (which may take longer). We asked to be seated in the heated outdoor patio area (which was absolutely beautiful and had the coziest, homiest, brunch-y vibes!!)\n\nThe food:\n- Fontainbleau scrambled eggs ($16): This came with portobello, shiitake, porcini, spinach, and fontina. I chose wheat for my toast and home fries as my side. I LOOOVE scrambled eggs!! They're my favorite kind of eggs, and Zazie did it right!! The eggs weren't overcooked and were super light and fluffy and had the perfect texture. I am also a hugeee sucker for mushrooms, so I really enjoyed this dish!! THE HOME FRIES. AHHHHHHH. Home fries are hands down my favorite brunch food. I absolutely loved Zazie's!! Some of the best I've ever had!! The texture is just PERFECT. None of that mushy all over potato business. Crispy on the outside and just the right amount of mashed potato-like softness on the inside!! The home fries came with roasted garlic and an absolutely divine seasoning!! I asked for hot sauce, and the server came out with a green sauce that they make in-house (I think). Smother the potatoes all over in hot sauce and...*drools*\n\n- Florentine eggs benedict (3 portion for $21): This came with saut\u00e9ed spinach and portobello mushrooms. My friend chose the salad as her side. The dish itself is served on an English muffin with lemon hollandaise. I kinda really, really, really don't like eggs benedict...I don't particularly like my eggs poached, and I REALLLLLLLY don't like hollandaise. But I genuinely enjoyed this dish?? The eggs were cooked just right--nice and runny when you cut 'em down the middle, giving you that good ol' #yolkporn!!\n\n- Pain de Mie French Toast (2 portion for $16): We chose the version of the dish that came with fruit. This French toast is made using an orange cinnamon batter, and mannnn, is it DELICIOUUUS!! I can't handle too much of anything overpoweringly sweet, but this was just amaaazing!! The French toast was super fluffy and flavorful, and it came with a mountainful of seasonal fruit (ours had cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberry, and pineapple). Drizzle it all over with syrup or add some of the delicious jam they have on the table!!\n\nYou have the option of ordering things in 1/2/3 sized portions, which is really cool, especially if you're not feeling super hungry but want to try more stuff. It's also really helpful if you're with a bunch of people and planning on ordering multiple things so you can try a lot of stuff off the menu!! They also had a bunch of really creative mimosa flavors!! I don't think they do bottomless\n\nBottom line: Don't let the line scare you. It will be WORTH. Put your name on that list and talk a walk around the neighborhood, stop by La Boulangerie for a nice warm soy latte to combat that freezing cold SF weather (I am a weakling). There is a two card max per table. Kinda really pricy, but I guess that's what you can expect from hipster brunch places in SF...you can definitely taste the quality!! And they don't take tips. The price on the menu includes living wage, revenue sharing, paid sick leave, insurance, parental leave, and 401(k)!! Pretty rad!! I will definitely be back!! I WANNA TRY EVERYTHING ON THE MENU. Move over, La Note!! I HAVE FOUND MY NEW FAVORITE BRUNCH PLACE. I would wait 2 hours for you any day, Zazie. I love you", "author": "Kithumini J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-04", "description": "Two words: crab benedict. The crab was fresh. The hollandaise sauce was decadent. And the eggs perfectly cooked. The only negative was how expensive it was. At the time of writing, 1 crab benedict was $19. Add a second one and it comes to $29! That's right, $29 for a pair of crab benedicts. Ok, I get it. Crab is expensive, especially if it's fresh. But do the math, and if a benedict is $10, then the potatoes are $9!! Really?? $9 for a side of potatoes (that are really really good, btw)?? If you look at the other benedicts, the potatoes actually cost even more ($10 to $11). So, bottom line, the benedicts here are expensive. But you know what?? The crab benedict was soooo good, I think I would pay for it again. Now, when I went, I only ordered 1 (because I'm cheapo and benedicts are generally pretty filling) but I think when I return, I'll have to order 2 (my poor wallet).\n\nWe also had the french toast tahiti, again, only ordering 1 piece. At $10, it was reasonable especially since it was quite filling and a pretty good size. So this place is definitely good but the wait was pretty long.

Finally came here on a weekday morning and was fortunate enough to only wait about 5-10 mins for a party of 2 around noontime. \n\n[AMBIENCE] - There's a back patio to the restaurant and I'd highly recommend try grabbing a seat back there rather than the front portion of the restaurant. The ambience in the back is very nice :)\n\nThe first thing listed on their menu is that tipping isn't necessary since all the prices are fixated to account for it. They also provide good benefits to their employees, which is always nice to know a business actually cares and are grateful for the backbone of their restaurant.\n\n[FOOD] We ordered the La Mer Benedict (w/ Dungeness crab) [100% RECOMMEND] and the Un, Deux, Trois (sub french toast instead of pancakes) [98% WOULDN'T RECOMMEND]. \n\nThe Benedict was delicious in every way from the pairing of avocado to their hollandaise sauce, to their perfect poached eggs!! \n\nThe Un, Deux, Trois was just alright...  Not great but nothing bad to say... my only complaint would be that the bacon was kind of rough and dry to eat. I'd probably wouldn't ever order again or recommend. \n\n[CONCLUSION] The food was good, but didn't blow be away. The staff is very friendly. It did take a really long time to get our food but its understandable since their kitchen is so small.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd probably come back if I was in the area and there wasn't a wait.

That way we get the best of both worlds--savory and sweet. We opted with the home fries to go with the egg dish and though I'm not a big fan of home fries (I prefer hash browns), these were good.

Though I didn't rate it as 4 stars, I did enjoy the food and atmosphere.\n\nFood: Best friend and fellow Yelper, Jen J., and I did our usual dance of getting something savory and sweet and sharing. That way, we get to try the best of both worlds. We decided on the Divorcee which was eggs benedict with avocado, bacon, and some hollandaise sauce. For sweet, we picked the French toast a la Diable which was french toast with poached bing cherries and whipped mascarpone. I liked that we got to decide on the number of eggs and slices of toast which coincided with an increase in price, of course. I liked the eggs benedict very much. You could tell it was all about the egg and didn't have an overpowering amount of sauce. The French toast was \"okay\" but I don't think I'd order it again. It was sweet but didn't stand out.\n\nAtmosphere: We ended up sitting in the patio which actually seemed much more comfortable than sitting inside. The heat lamp definitely did its job even on a chilly San Francisco morning. Very cute outside.\n\nWait: We got there right at 9 am on a Saturday (when it opens) and waited 25 minutes. The method of calling people didn't make sense to me. They only seated an entire table when everyone was there but if people showed up late they still tried to seat them first. It was a little frustrating but understandable, I guess. It seemed like somehow, people also got reserve seating if they knew people at the restaurant(?).

We gave Zazie a try on a Thursday and again, a line but hey, maybe this is just how it has to be so we waited. It was about a 30 minute wait, another 30 minutes to get our food. The inside decor wasn't quite what I had expected but it was nice -- a nice homey vibe. We both got two eggs benedict, smoked salmon and the dungeness crab cause, I mean, why not?  I did have to wait in line for this. We also got their cream cheese coffee cake to share.\n\nThe house potatoes were pretty good. I love that they add huge gloves of garlic to to them. After eating those babies and a benedict we were already stuffed so just took the other little guys to go. Service was okay but kind of minimal since they were busy.

The vibe here is unmistakably Parisian with the brick interior and classic French posters. When you arrive, say a little prayer for an open table at their gorgeous back patio. Even if it's a little chilly outside, there are a bunch of heated lamps there to keep you nice and toasty.\n\nAlthough the prices on the menu might seem daunting at first, keep in mind that tip is already included. Also, they are pretty serious about the whole no substitutions thing. We tried ordering Sarah Jane's Griddle Flight, substituting in the Miracle Pancake and the French Toast Tahiti, but they wouldn't allow it. There was no stopping us from ordering each one separately though, so we ended up creating our own flight anyway.\n\n// Miracle Pancakes ($9 / 1 piece) - 5 stars\nIncredibly light and fluffy! I found that the maple syrup was unnecessary since the pancake came with a generous dollop of lemon curd.\n\n// French Toast Tahiti ($9 / 1 piece) - 4 stars\nOrder this if you enjoy banana desserts. There is a layer of mushed bananas and walnuts in between the two pieces of toast.\n\n// Gingerbread Pancakes ($9 / 1 piece) - 5 stars\nThe gingerbread flavor was quite predominant. This pancake had an almost cake-like consistency. It is certainly thicker and more dense than the Miracle Pancake.\n\n// Eggs Benedict St. Trop ($21 / 2 eggs) - 4 stars\nThe creaminess of the hollandaise and the tartness of the capers really shined through. However, I wish there were more salmon and less red onions. The side of home fries came with delicious roasted garlic cloves.", "author": "Miko B."}

The list is posted outside so we signed up knowing it would prob be a looong wait. We got coffee and pastries at La Boulangerie to\nhold us over meanwhile. We got called at 45 minutes (yay earlier than expected!) The waitstaff were friendly and efficient! There's no tips expected at Zazies as they state their prices cover for their staff.\n\nFOOD: I got the St. Tropez (salmon Benedict) with salad. I appreciated that the egg yolk wasn't too runny and instead was the perfect medium of softness. It was good but prob not worth a longer wait. The S/O got the three sampler thing of -gingerbread pancake, buttermilk pancake and French toast. I don't like ginger taste so can't comment on that. The buttermilk pancake was soft and fluffy but honestly was not that special. The French toast was pretty terrible I have to say. Tasted super plain and was not a soft texture... Weird. \n\nVIBE: typical SF brunch place themed French. There's an outdoor patio in the back and that looked like a fun place to sit. There are two small tables out in front of the restaurant that's first come, first serve but it might a little too up close and personal with the mass mob of hungry brunchers waiting outside to be called. \n\nI must also comment about the bathroom. There's only one bathroom  and a line can queue up. It is super small, reminded me of the size of an airplane bathroom! \n\nOverall, a good place to brunch on the weekend for a small party.

The water is self pour, the cramped space is ill-fitted for a comfortable brunch, and the hollandaise is not made to order (and considering the price and wait you would expect quality). Their breakfast \"fries\" are bland home-style potatoes and the price is STEEP for breakfast, but hey, you're in San Francisco.

Our server was so nice to us! He was all smiles and cracked jokes too. The food was amazing but it took a while to get to us, I am guessing it's because they wanted all the food to arrive at the same time. The restaurant doesn't take tips, they mentioned that their employees are getting enough to have a live able wage. \n\nThe reason why it's not a 5 Star review - during our brunch, we asked one of the servers (it wasn't the one appointed to us) to turned the heater a little higher due to the cold climate, he decided to make the heater the highest it could be so we were all burning, the heat was so strong! We then asked for some hot sauce and he rolled his eyes and walked away. By the end of our brunch, my girlfriends had given the kitchen a cake to surprise me and they asked for the cake, the server brought the cake in its bag with everything inside. I was shook! Obviously, my girlfriends had asked for them to bring the cake out so it could be consumed. We were already so surprised at this person's attitude we decided to just take the cake home because why bother giving him another task right?

We came in during the holidays on a weekday, and the wait was still about an hour and a half, though the front patio seating is first come first serve. We expected the wait, so no stars knocked off for this.\n\nWhen we were finally seated, I was surprised that the tables were actually decently spaced out, and we had good amount of privacy. The menu is diverse with a good amount of selection for vegetarians. I definitely am not a brunch person because I dislike eggs and sweet breakfast-y items, but I saw that they had some really unique savory, non egg-centric items. I ultimately decided on the toasted baguette with cream cheese, tomato and basil (brilliantly simple item, but so good) and one Miracle Pancake. The Miracle Pancakes are accurately named because the one I had was so delicious and fluffy, without being overly sweet and decadent. I also love the option of being able to choose 1, 2 or 3 pancakes so you can venture out and try other things without a huge stack of leftover pancakes. In conclusion, as a non-brunch person, I give this meal an A+.\n \nThey also have a great selection of brunch drinks, I loved the Magic Mimosa and the Mango Mimosa. \n\nOverall, Zazie is definitely worth at least one try. Our bill came to about $40 per person, which is decent for SF considering we each ordered two drinks. The service was also AMAZING considering how overwhelming it must be to have such a huge crowd waiting outside the restaurant hungrily waiting for their names to be called.

We got a table outside (which is first come first served). I ordered the buttermilk pancake and 1 Florentine Eggs Benedict, with an iced coffee. Every single thing about this brunch was perfect. The ice coffee was strangely delicious, the buttermilk pancake (which i had tried before in a pancake flight but realized buttermilk was the best) was out of this world and the florentine eggs benny rocked. I honestly could not have been happier. \n\nLast night my dad took me and my 2 roommates here for my bday dinner which i was very excited about since i had never been here for dinner. We brought a bottle of wine and ended up ordering another one (Red Zin) in between the meal and dessert. We started off with the sampler app platter with mussels, figs fagaro, and the pate de volaille. I'm not a huge mussels fan, but gave it a try. Still not a fan. Also was not expecting to enjoy the pate but it was actually really tasty and rich. The figs fagaro (grilled black mission figs, wilted arugula, and warm ch\u00e8vre\non grilled garlic levain) was by far my favorite. \n\nFor entrees, the 4 of us split the truite meuniere (white trout w/ preserved meyer lemon butter and toasted almonds, served w/ green salad), Grilled Niman Ranch Hanger Steak (with portobello mushroom cream sauce, mashed russet potatoes, and saut\u00e9ed local broccolini), and the Fresh Lemon Ricotta Raviolis (wilted arugula, melted leeks, white wine, and parmesan) and a side of mac n cheese (fresh organic pasta w/ creamy cheddar sauce and parmesan crust) because why not. oh my goodness everything was incredibly delicious. The trout was so good, not too fishy, the hanger steak was perfectly cooked and paired nicely with the mashed potatoes and broccolini, and the lemon ricotta raviolo was so unique and wonderful. Also the mac n cheese was unreal. perfect side dish. For dessert, we ordered the Cuit de Chocolat Chaud (signature \"Baked Hot Chocolate\" w/ golden marshmallows) and the Crumble aux Fruits (fresh fruit crumble, served warm w/ cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche). The special of the night for the crumble was strawberry and we also got a side of vanilla gelato. \n\nWow i cannot even fully express how awesome this meal was. Plus on monday nights they have puppy night where you get $10 off a bottle just for bringing your dog. best thing ever! Tuesdays are no corkage fee so you can bring in your own bottle of wine and not pay a corkage fee PLUS they have an adorable back patio that I have yet to sit in but am making that happen the next time I come here.

I came here with my friend on a Saturday around 10:45am, and there was a big blob of people already waiting! Not a surprise since it was prime brunch time, but brunch crowds never cease to amaze me. There is street parking (meter parking right out front) and residential parking in the area, which might take some time to find. Luckily, I dropped my friend off so she could put our name down for the waitlist while I drove around to find parking. The downside to putting your name down on the waitlist is that the staff doesn't let you know how long the wait is, which I understand is hard to gauge, but it's always nice to know a time estimate. A seating tactic that my friend and I found out when we got to Zazie is that outside seating is first come first serve, so if you're lucky enough to snag a spot outside after a party has left, you will be served even if you haven't put your name down on the waitlist or if you haven't been called yet. We didn't know this, and after an hour of waiting, we snagged a seat outside. I ordered the Fontainbleau scramble and it was delicious! It's a vegetarian scramble with spinach and mushrooms, and it comes with toast and home fries, which were equally delicious. I especially loved the jam, which comes in a small jar that was on the table, so you can grab as much jam as you want! The service was quick and attentive, considering the constant business the restaurant got. This place is also tip free, so you don't have to tip since it is already covered in the cost of the dishes.

This review is mainly for the service. I come from the restaurant business and understand how important service to a restaurant's success. I'm hoping that the owner will take my review in consideration that including gratuity in the food prices is a bad idea. What leads to this is lazy, inattentive servers in which all they care about is how much you order. At least our server was like this. \n\nWe were a party of five from out-of-town that included my two daughters ages 2 and 5, my wife, my mother-in-law, and myself. My mother-in-law was not eating and my girls can barely finish one pancake between the two of them. So basically I only ordered two plates. Our waiter was beside himself for what we had ordered. He said, \"That's it!? For a party of five, that's not very much food.\" He jotted down our order and shook his head. First off, he shouldn't worry about how much we order. It's none of his business. His attitude goes to show that he only cares about the quantity of food he puts down on his ticket. Most likely because it reflects his tips. He made us feel uncomfortable for taking up five seats and only ordering two plates. He never came to our table to ask how everything was. We felt like we were being rushed to finish so they can seat the next group. \n\nZazie obviously has its followers with a crowd of people waiting outside to be seated. Their popularity seems like it has given them a free pass to not give good service. Since the servers tip is already included, it really doesn't matter to them whether they perform well or not.

Anyways, let's get back on topic...\n\nThe food is on the pricier side, but I think it's because they have a no tipping rule. The food itself was ok. I liked how they put entire garlic cloves in their potatoes. They leave the skin on so they're really crispy. My husband ate them with the skin on, but I prefer peeling them off. Other than that, I've had better. The brunch menu didn't appeal to me much, but the options for dinner looked really good. I think I would try going back for dinner instead.", "author": "Katherine C."}

How amazing is it to find a place that consistently serves amazing food for brunch and dinner?!\n\nThe vibe for dinner is completely different than the craziness of brunch. It becomes an intimate french bistro with an impressive wine list. I came here for a group dinner so got to experience a lot of the menu. The highlights for me was the chicken liver pate on a crustini, hanger steak with portobello cream sauce, and the trout with butter, lemon and almonds. Everything was cooked perfectly, full of flavor, and paired well with the wine our waiter recommended. \n\nAdditionally, the desserts were out of control. You can't leave without ordering the baked hot chocolate with toasted marshmallows. It's unlike anything I've ever had before. It's honestly indescribable so just go get it. The fruit crisp was also amazing. \n\nOn top of everything I've already said about how amazing brunch and dinner is, on Mondays you can bring your dog and have dinner on the patio, and Tuesdays there's no corkage fee.

There's just something satisfying about sleeping in, rolling out of bed and into my yoga pants, and out for a bloody and some eggs. Who needs three meals a day? \n\nSan Francisco, unlike my little East Coast Portlandtown, gets that people want brunch all day erryday. And the line on a Friday morning at 1030ish here at Zazie's proved that. It's a small space, so before entering you write your own name on a clipboard hanging on the window (taking Candice G's advice, I wrote S T E F F in the nicest, most legible penmanship of my life). Check if you want inside or outside, if your whole party is there, and then stand back and wait. Don't worry, though, the wait here is not that long: they really do move people in and out. \n\nWhat tipped me over to the five star over the four star was the staff/the policies. Number one: tipping isn't necessary because the employees are paid living wages and revenue shares (and amazing benefit packages). That's amazing. You can tell they're happy and dedicated. Number two: I wanted a bloody. I asked if it was made with worcestershire (since most worcestershire contains fish, and that's no bueno to this vegetarian). They regretfully let me know that they did make theirs with it. About fifteen minutes later a manager came up to our table to tell me that he had no idea that fish was in most worcestershire, thanked me for letting him know, then proceeded to go through all of their sauces/condiments to see what was veg-safe. The worcestershire they use is fish free, and out came a beautiful drink to my table. Bravo, folks, for caring that much! \n\nThe food itself was good, though I thought the portions were a bit small. I got the Eggs Vincent (grilled corn cake with spinach, spicy tomato-goat cheese sauce, avocado, and two over easy eggs with a side of home fries). Everything was cooked to perfection, flavorful (there could have been more goat cheese, but I'm a freak for the stuff), and I loved the big cloves of garlic in my potatoes. It was filling, but not overtly so, meaning instead of a nap afterwards, I wanted to walk (and walk I did - who wouldn't want to in such a charming neighborhood).\n\nYum.", "author": "Steff D."}

Upon reading the menu online I saw that Zazie is tip free as their \"menu prices include a living wage, revenue share, paid family leave, fully funded health & dental insurance, paid time off, and a 401(k) with employer match for all of our hard working employees.\"  To me that is huge, especially in this day and age.\n\nIt was packed on a rainy Thursday at noon, but my group of 3 only waited about 30 mins.  We had a very comfortable seat and did not feel crammed in like sardines.  Table, however, was small for the amount of food we ordered.  I like that you can order 1, 2, or 3 benedicts, pancakes, french toast, etc.  I highly recommend the miracle pancakes.  I got to get my fat girl on with bread pudding pancakes, which were life changing.  The divorce benedict was good, but I've honestly had better.  And my husband really enjoyed his Croque Monsieur, which was huge.  Our waitress was also lovely.

I've had this place on my radar for a very long time; not just because of the thousands (yes I said thousands) of Yelp reviews but because I've heard some very good things about their food.\n\nLocated directly on Cole St. (adjacent to Carl St.), \"Zazie\" has been serving quality food ever since they opened their doors back in 1992. What makes this restaurant uniquely special is that the owner takes great care of his staff and employees by providing them with full insurance, sick pay, vacation, and 401K. Additionally, they are a \"no tips required\" restaurant meaning every single menu item is paid out directly to the staff as revenue share. If only more places can adopt this concept, there will be many, many more happy employees!\n\nI came here with my lovely lady on a Sunday morning around 10:45am. As I wrote my name on the waiting list, there were at least 15 names above mine. Luckily, we were able to walk to a nearby Peet's Coffee (which is only about 50 feet away) to grab our cup of Joe while we waited. I was expecting at least an hour wait; fortunately they called my name in only 35 short minutes! But when dining here, you should definitely expect to wait awhile; especially on busy weekend mornings.\n\nOnce we were seated, I noticed that the interior is relatively small (hence the reason for the long wait). However, there are a few tables in the front as well as an impressive back patio (that I only briefly saw) that can seat many parties. Some of the neat features of \"Zazie\" are its spiral staircase near the front, brick walls to give it a classic rustic feel, and a lot of French artwork throughout.\n\nWithin just a few minutes, our waiter takes our orders. My beverage of choice was their \"Zazie Spritzer\" (cranberry juice, orange juice, and Perrier water) while she opted for a freshly squeezed \"Odwalla orange juice\" (both priced at $3.25). My meal of choice consisted of their \"Monaco Poached Egg\" dish (priced at $15.00). This consisted of prosciutto and tomatoes proven\u00e7ales complete with Hollandaise sauce on an English muffin and a side of home fries. Her meal was a basic one egg breakfast complete with white toast and home fries (priced at $9.00).\n\nAs busy as it was, the staff were working very quickly to get everyone's dishes out in a timely manner. Our meals came out in about 20 minutes which was a respectable time considering how busy it was. As far as the presentation, my meal looked on point. It was a bit on the small side (hence the reason for deducting one star) but considering that the tip is included, I don't want to be too critical of the portion size. As far as the flavor, I loved the consistency of the prosciutto while the eggs were cooked to perfection. It wasn't the best I've ever had but definitely on the higher end of the spectrum. She also loved her meal as the garlic added a nice zest to her home fries.\n\nI do have to say, as a first-time at \"Zazie's\", I was quite satisfied with my brunch. The menu is quite extensive as they offer several traditional breakfast options as well as a few unique items with that French twist. And if breakfast just isn't your thing, their dinner menu offers many eclectic entrees and desserts. I do know with the regulars and locals that frequent this place, I don't see this place going away anytime soon. So definitely check them out; the wait is well worth it!", "author": "Donovan H."}

Often times, you have to wait for an hour or so on weekends. The tables outside are first-come-first-serve. So if you're lucky, you could be sitting down and eating in no time. Alternatively, you can also wait in the bar next door getting some drinks in first.\n\nI love getting eggs Benedict and french toast at Zazie. They just taste so darn good!! I'm also in love with their drinks menu, both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic options. You can make your perfect lemonade here if you like :P I usually end up spending around $25-30 here with food and drinks, which is a bit expensive, but I think the it totally deserves it!\n\nZazie also opens for dinner though I have never tried it. I'm curious whether or not dinner will be as good as their brunch selections :)", "author": "Angel C."}

We arrived at 8:30 and waited in line for 20 minutes to add our names to the waitlist. We were seated right after 9am when they open.\n\nI always love the patio space with their outdoor tables and heat lamps. It was a cozy fall vibe. We ordered coffee cake, the Divorcee (eggs Benedict with bacon and cheese) and the omelet special with tomatoes and chicken sausage. The food is really where things were bad. The omelet was cold in the middle and SO heavy on the garlic. The eggs Benedict was warm but I wouldn't call it hot. It had a tiny amount of avocado and for $20 it's ridiculous even for SF. Service was fine but I really can't get over the logistics and the wait for barely mediocre food.", "author": "Emily L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-18", "description": "Zazie is a French-inspired restaurant located in the heart of Hayes Valley. This is a super popular brunch place in the city, reinforced by the long wait list when we came on a Sunday morning. After about two hours, we were finally seated and ordered a few dishes (which themselves took a while to arrive). I got the Eggs Maya from the special menu, which were eggs benedict on top of achiote pork, salsa, and avocado on an English muffin. The egg was perfectly poached and topped with a lemon hollandaise sauce, which was delicious; the egg yolk ran out perfectly when cut in half and enveloped the pork-salsa-avocado mixture in rich, creamy goodness. While this dish was decent, the pork was actually slightly cold (perhaps it had been sitting out for too long), and I wouldn't say that the flavors were overwhelming good or particularly special.\n\nI also got to try the gingerbread pancake with lemon curd and poached pear, which I found to be very aromatic and definitely not overly sweet. My favorite part of this dish was the poached pear, which was tender and fruity, along with the lemon curd; while the gingerbread pancake was good, I'm sure I've had better. We also had the miracle pancake (a \"bread pudding\" pancake) served with caramelized banana. This pancake was unlike any other I've had--the texture was incredibly chewy and dense--very unique for a pancake!\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Zazie doesn't expect customers to leave tips, as they pay their workers a living wage--this was certainly a plus, and we noted that the service was just as friendly as any other restaurant that does accept tips (though a little bit slow at times). Overall, this was a decent brunch restaurant, but I wouldn't say that it was necessarily worth the wait or the price. However, I would definitely be interested in visiting for dinner and checking out some of their other dishes there.", "author": "David K."}

He sat us at a table for FOUR (that's right, not 5) and when we didn't fit demanded that if we didn't accept this table we had to go back down the steps and wait.\n\n3 - When we tried to explain that the 85-year old woman with a walker can't easily walk down the stairs, stand around for an unspecified amount of time, then hop back up the stairs again, he got agitated and aggressive, saying \"well that's just the way it is\".\n\n\nCould we have made due with a table for 5 (as the host himself thought was the case) and squeezed around?

They have an amazing backyard patio which I'd easily prefer over the indoor seating.  Came here for brunch and only had to wait about 45 minutes for a table of 4.  It's a bit strange, but they seem to seat people based on party sizes of 3 and below or 4 and above.  Kind of works out well for larger parties.  \n\nWe were seated in the backyard, it felt a lot more open back there.  What I really think is cool about this place is that you can order a lot of their brunch entrees by 1, 2, or 3 pieces!  This is an excellent option.  It's great for sharing or if you just aren't too hungry.  I ended up with the Monaco Benedict which had prosciutto and tomatoes provenceles.  I loved every bit of it.  Mines came with a lot of Hollandaise sauce, more than my friend got on his benedict.  One of the eggs was cooked really well and had a very runny yolk.  The other was a bit overcooked.  Still a great benedict, the tomatoes added a lot of flavor.\n\nI really enjoyed this place.  If you're coming here for brunch though, expect a long brunch here.  While the wait to get in wasn't too bad, the wait for our food was actually equally as long.  They get very busy here, but I think it was worth the wait.  They also offer quite a bit of unique things here to spice up their brunch menu!", "author": "Bryson L."}

All but one in our party ordered this divine entree , which arrived steaming to the table , the aroma of all the spices of the Silk Road before us , succulent braised chunks of lamb falling apart with just the thought of a fork , beautifully spiced couscous and eggplant supporting this dinner of kings .

Zazie's was good. \n\nLocated on Cole St., there's no doubt that Zazie's was going to be busy especially on a Sunday afternoon. Parking was also hell so I should mention that. My boyfriend and I circled a few residential blocks before finally parking 3 blocks away. But the weather was nice so the walk wasn't too bad. \n\nZazie's has a wait list posted on the window near the door so be aware of that. Don't just stand around with the people outside waiting. There are four 2-seater tables outside that are FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE. So even if you're number 20 on the list and there are other couples before you, if you grab a table out from then you're good. Seems like a dick move really, but that's what my boyfriend and I did. And it was a good thing, too, because the manager ended up calling my boyfriend's name for a table right when we were pretty much done eating so if we didn't swoop in then we would've had to wait a good 40-50 mins just for a table. \n\nService here was okay. The waiter we had wasn't overly friendly but he worked efficiently and the bus boy was nice enough to clear the table when we first sat down even though he already had a lot of plates in his hands. There's no tipping involved here because they all get paid a living wage which I've never heard of before but sounds pretty darn awesome!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered their miracle pancakes (which changes flavors so I'm not quite sure what to tell you) but it had lemon curd and strawberries on top and it was good. Their sides are a tad expensive for one egg and sausages. I got their Tahiti French toast with caramelized bananas and walnuts and it was delicious but ended up being too sweet towards the end.

The waiter was not terribly attentive, and it took some time to get another glass of wine.\n\nDessert was the same problem. The four of us ordered 3 desserts and 2 coffees. The first coffee arrived after 5 minutes, then a dessert, then the second coffee, and finally, perhaps 15 minutes after the first coffee, a second dessert arrived. It was only after waiting another 10 minutes we figured out that the 3d dessert wasn't going to come (the waiter hadn't heard us, or forgot). At no time did the waiter ask if we had everything and if everything was OK.\n\nLuckily we really enjoyed each other's company during what turned into a 2.5 hour meal.

People are OK with waiting over an hour for a foodporn benny or a special french toast...stuffed, sprinkled, or fried...whatever form it comes in. So excuse yourself if you can't handle this review. We waited an hour on Saturday brunch, which is typical for SF when you \"do brunch.\" That wasn't a problem, since I've waited over an hour at Plow in Potrero Hill before. But if you're a brunch spot with that long of a wait, you should be blowing my mind. Zazie was delicious and all sorts of French-cute, but the small portion sizes and our \"over it\" server was not the business.\n\nFor our two-top, we shared a single LA MER (crab) benny, which was disappointing. We paid $17 for a sad, small plate (pictured below)...at least fill the plate up with homefries so it kind of looks like it's worth $17. Our favorite was the special pumpkin miracle pancakes, which weren't too sweet...and topped with a scoop of real pumpkin on top. The special omelette that weekend was a great combo of squash, goat cheese (I don't usually like goat cheese, but it was a GREAT pairing) and greens. We were extremely satisfied with the food, but we felt like the La Mer wasn't worth the $17. ONE EGG doesn't cost that much, even though the egg price has risen recently.\n\nService is \"barely there,\" which is great if you're looking to chat with your brunch partner(s) and don't want any interruptions. Our dude was pretty chill, but being a server myself, I was glad that I didn't have to tip him for his lackluster performance. I hope Zazie's system of paying their employees a great wage is working out for them...this guy just didn't seem too pumped to be at work.\n\nLastly, their restrooms need more work. There's a tiny one wedged in the back of the house across from the kitchen window...so if there's a line (which there always is for women), then you'll find yourself standing in the space of the servers/kitchen/BOH, and just feeling in the way. This is probably an infrastructure detail they can't fix since SF is so tight for space. But it's not convenient. In all, I wouldn't make a special trip to come back to Zazie, but I'm glad I tried it and checked out their French-esque brunch theme.

The food is great but definitely on the pricey side (which is not too unexpected for French food).\n\nMost recently in 06/2017, I visited Zazie and had their prie fixe dinner menu which consisted of:\n\nAppetizer\n-P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Volaille\n---The chicken p\u00e2t\u00e9 was provided with one slice of levain bread lathered with the p\u00e2t\u00e9 and included a side salad.  As far as the p\u00e2t\u00e9 itself, it was very creamy and smooth and had a good depth of flavor.  It did not taste wild/gamey and did not have the metallicky/organ taste that some p\u00e2t\u00e9's have.  The levain bread was made well and had a nice toasted texture to it.  I wish it was just more than one slize of levain with p\u00e2t\u00e9 given the normal appetizer costs $13.  The side salad was a nice addition to help cleanse the palette.\n\nEntr\u00e9e\n-Truite Meuni\u00e8re\n---The trout was very flavorful and the skin had a nice crisp which worked well together with the crunch of the almonds.  Unfortunately the portion size of the trout was pretty small and I wish they had maybe given a bigger fish or some additional hearty sides to go with the dish because the side salad provided with the dish was much bigger than the fish itself.\n\nDessert(s)\n-Decadent Vanilla Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\n---The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was very small portioned and the consistency was pretty typical of a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  The thin layer of caramelized sugar on top provided a nice crunchy texture to offset the soft texture.\n\nI do like how they have now employed the no tipping rule as this is how it is done in other foreign countries as well so the waiters/waitresses are not paid by tips with a low base pay.  The staff was great and attentive to our needs and accommodating for a baby in the party.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-22", "description": "When I first looked at this menu I was shocked at how expensive everything was, but Zazie is unique in that they don't accept tips - it is essentially included in the price so all workers, regardless of position, are paid more equally. They also receive health benefits and insurance, so kudos to you for fair worker treatment!\n\nThe food itself is stellar as well. My Florentine benedict came with a good ratio of spinach and portobello mushrooms, and the egg was perfectly runny. The house fries were tasty, with crispy smaller pieces and fluffy larger pieces; while a little saltier than I'm used to, I loved that they included a whole clove of garlic as well (if you read my reviews, you know I love garlic). My friend ordered the Albert benedict with bacon, white cheddar, and homemade salsa fresca, which she demolished. I like that you can choose whether you want 1, 2, or 3 eggs for poached eggs, so you can pick your portions or try some of the more expensive options if you're on a budget. \n\nService here is efficient and all the workers are friendly and polite, holding doors for customers going through the narrow hallway. It was crowded inside the restaurant, but the back patio proved to be a pleasant dining experience as well, with festive decorations and heat lamps. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!", "author": "KC W."}

I enjoyed it.\n\nMy girlfriend and I got here right at opening and there were already around 4 or 5 other parties waiting. While we were seated right away, I can definitely imagine the giant crowd that is mentioned in other yelp reviews. So be sure to come early, or expect to wait if you come later. \n\nNot gonna lie the names on the menu were hard and I really don't remember what I ordered. I just know I got scrambled eggs and I don't remember which nationality I chose to model them after, I just know they were tasty. My girlfriend also got the benedicts and a slice of French toast on their challah bread. I never tried the benedicts but the French toast was good too. \n\nThe service was very friendly and you can definitely tell there are a lot of regulars there. I guess I'm only giving it 4 stars because if I had to wait in line, I'd rather wait for Mama's on Washington Square. It's just a preference thing, but if I were you I would definitely try Zazie, I think it's great. \n\nI also really like how they provide their employees with decent wages.

We came by at a busy brunch hour, and the wait time was approximately 1.5 hours. Luckily about 40 minutes in, we spotted a patio table open up, which is first-come-first-serve. Being the incredibly busy restaurant that this is, it takes the waitstaff quite some time to get around to everyone's orders so don't expect the fastest service even once you have the fortune of being seated. Considering the hectic environment, the staff truly are doing their best, however. The food is a little on the higher end of the $$ category, but they pay their staff a living wage so you don't have to leave a tip (though I'm sure extra cash would be appreciated). \n\nThe food is absolutely incredible, especially their breakfast items. I also ordered a Zazie spritzer, which is honestly really over-priced for the amount they give you even considering the living-wage situation. We also tried their burger, which was fantastic. Their fried potatoes which come with the eggs and can even come with the burger are to die for. Their eggs benedict are fantastic as well, though they weren't my favorite item. Their french toast was delicious but a tiny little bit too rich for my taste. \n\nOverall, I recommend this spot for anyone who is a visitor or a local to SF.

I have YET to hear about this place before finally coming and when I had seen all the people standing in front of the restaurant at 10A.M. I knew this place was quiet popular.\n\nMario, the general manager explained to us that it would be an hour wait if we wanted to sit in a group. AN HOUR WAIT!! I was SO not pleased to hear that but I totally understood. I explained to him that we were celebrating birthdays and needed to be seated together. He explained that he was a man of his word and if we waited at the Peet's Coffee right by the Zazie restaurant then he would come get us in an hour.\n\nA little after an hour our table was FINALLY ready and Mario called us! Yayy! We had a great seat in the back patio (which is such a nice area) I truly recommend seating in the back if you can! We even had complimentary Miracle Pancakes on the table waiting for us for our wait! SAY WHAT?? Could this get any better? HAHA YESSS, I'm not nearly done explaining!  \n\nWe finally ordered our brunch and I must say that everything looked SO DELICIOUS!!! If I had room to taste everything on the menu I think I probably would! Our server Servando was amazing at taking our orders and making sure we were well supplied with water. \n\nI ordered:\n~ La Mer- which comes with hand-picked Dungeness crab, avocados, green onions w/ home fries and French Toast Tahiti stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts.\n\nEverything was so delicious!

Their  \"no tips required\" business structure combined with great food and service makes this place a top brunch favorite for me.\n\nI came to this popular brunch spot on a weekday and the wait was less than 10 minutes. Of course I should note that I came here an hour before it closed for brunch, hence why the wait was so short. They do have a sign in sheet near the door, but I should warn those who want to brunch on the weekends to be prepared to wait, especially if your party is big!\n\nZazie offers patio, indoor and outdoor seating. During winter, the store puts up heating lamps on the patio and outdoor seating area. The patio section also offers blankets for those who wish for one! The menu here at Zazie is also unique in that they offer small, medium and large portion sizes for most of their dishes here. The price for most of their food is quite fair (~$11-$20) and keep in mind that you dont have to tip, so consider this place to be WORTH.\n\nI ordered the french toast (2 slices) with fruit for $15 and I was more than happy with my dish. The 2 slices turned out to be 4 thick, half sliced bread toppled with strawberries, cantaloupes and pineapples. I thought the french toast was great. Having the fruit ontop of the warm toast made the fruit all warm. I might suggest having fruit on the side so one does not have to eat \"warm\" fruit.

The food is solid and plentiful if nothing necessarily stands out, but then again I've only been once. Among the many fabulous places to enjoy a weekend brunch in the city this is probably in the top 15, and that still says a lot in a competitive market like San Francisco.\n\nZazie is a comfortable cute little bistro that specializes in brunch and lunch dishes with a French flair. And I personally love French food, mind you that none of us in our party actually got French food to dine on. The drinks are a real delight here. I had the signature refresher called Le Metro which has fortified wine, sparkling lemonade, lavender simple syrup, and champagne. I found it to be a delight that was zingy and not over powerful. My friend had the summer drink special called the Pamplune Spritz which contained rose wine with grapefruit and peach essence topped with champagne. That drink felt way too watered down and quite frankly, didn't have a kick.    \n\nZazie has become one of many San Francisco establishments that have done away with gratuity for their staff and have increased prices to make sure their staff is paid a decent wage by increasing their dish prices. Now I have never eaten here before, so I don't know if their was a significantly increased prices on their dishes. But the menu also says they have fully funded health and dental insurance, paid sick leave, and a 401K with an employer match for ALL of their employees. Now that says a lot for a small restaurant to do all that for all of their staff!\n\nMy friend had a dish on their summer brunch special menu called the \"Eggs En Fonte\" which was two over easy eggs served on a corn cake with spinach, avocados, tomato-chevre sauce all served on a iron skillet. Not sure what was French about that dish but my friend loved it none the less. I got as usual my signature Eggs Benedict dish this time called La Mer with hand picked dungeness crab, avocados, and green onions with a side of home fries. I liked my dish, it was 24 dollars even for a two egg dish, which was a good deal for the intricately pulled crab pieces. You can tell they use fresh ingredients and that is what matters here!\n\nI like Zazie, if you're in the Cole Valley neighborhood and looking for a bite for brunch or lunch, then it's worth a visit. Not exactly sure if it's worth a drive all the way out to the western part of San Francisco, where parking can be limited. But a small locally owned restaurant with fresh ingredients and a little flair that boasts about treating their employees with dignity gets an extra star in my book.", "author": "Jason F."}

Weekends are too crazy for me most of the time to get out and brunch it up, but many of the places I had bookmarked only offer brunch on weekends! Fortunately Zazie was one of the eateries open for brunch on a weekday. Zazies is a little gem, a shop on the smaller side, located in a cramped (what isn't cramped in SF) street along a hill. A friend and I went at about 12ish and there was a group of people outside waiting and a list full to the next page. Parking here is definitely a struggle, but luckily we snagged the spot right in front. It's cool that they offer the first come first serve seating right in front, in addition to a waitlist hanging on the window. Even though it looked like there were many people ahead of us on the waitlist, it went by really quickly! Our party of two was called over and man, everyone here is so friendly. Definitely one of the friendliest places I've been to! As soon as they see you walking ahead, theres someone holding the door open for you, every single employee you walk by greets you hello and goodbye, all genuinely friendly, warm smiles, and welcoming. Maybe they were lucky and just hired a great group of individuals, or their forward thinking no tip/better pay rule really makes them happier workers (which in that case, every shop should consider implementing this if they can!). \n\nSo we walk through the restaurant to get to the back patio and it's so cramped inside that my cheeks were definitely brushing against every person and table and chair. The outside patio is a tiny bit more spacious than inside, however I still had to move my chair every so often to let the person at the next table go in and out. We ended up ordering the New York scrambled eggs, 1 miracle pancake, and 1 french toast Tahiti. Normally I like to stay benedickin' during brunches (plus poached eggs make for better egg porn), but the cream cheese in the scrambled eggs was a deal breaker for us and we had no regrets. The cream cheese complimented the salmon and the soft scrambled eggs, so it was melt in your mouth goodness. The potatoes came with garlic which I loved, but they could definitely give more potatoes and a little less garlic. The french toast was also amazing! I loved that it was actually not too sweet at all. It was not a sugary sweet, but rather just a sweetness that came from the bananas. The miracle pancakes were a miss for us, however! The miracle pancakes are a special with a weekly flavor-this week is lemon ricotta pancakes with meyer lemon curd. Lemon curd sounded amazing, WHICH IT WAS, but then it also came with a raspberry sauce on it which was overly sweet and took away from the lemony flavors. We double checked the menu and on the ingredients, it didn't even say it would come with raspberry sauce! Because of preference, we just didn't like it, but what if we were allergic to it? It really should say so on the menu in the future so people won't be confused. \n\nAt the end of our meal we left feeling super stuffed and satisfied. Zazie's is definitely on my brunch rotation!", "author": "Maleah M."}

The pancake was homemade and fluffy, with a taste similar to a crepe. The Monaco was good, and the potatoes come with roasted garlic. D-lish. \n\nA friend ended up joining me and had the florentine. Looked delicious.  We both had one egg, but you can choose how many you want, up to three. \n\nThe Zazie mimosa was delicious and a great balance of champagne and fresh OJ. The bloody Marie tasted a little watery.\n\nThe service was great. Zazie makes it a point not to tip because they compensate their staff well. I like that approach. \n\nFun place for brunch.

We waited over an hour after putting our names down for Saturday breakfast. This wasn't a really a big deal considering it was the weekend and a holiday one at that. I don't mind waiting for a delicious meal but this wasn't one worth waiting for. \n\nThe monaco poached eggs came with prosciutto and tomatoes. It tasted like many other poached eggs I've had and wasn't truly impressive. We also shared a side of bacon, that was overcooked, and also chicken apple sausage, which honestly was probably the best item from the things we ordered. My friend liked her challah bread french toast so I'll take her word for it. Beyond that, I'm not sure much needs to be said other than that this is an average breakfast place with average offerings. I still have some high hopes for the dinner menu though.\n\nWhat I love is the fact that they provide their employees with a decent wage along with benefits. All employers should do this and their efforts make it commendable. Their staff seemed happy and there's built in convenience with not having to awkwardly decide how much to tip at the end of your meal.", "author": "Quoc N."}

I will say though, the wait is worth it. Although many of the items on the menu were enticing, I finally decided on the french toast de diable - it came with poached bing cherries and whipped mascarpone cream, which is what sold it for me. I got three pieces, but the pieces were pretty big that I could've gone by with just one piece of french toast and a side of cream cheese coffee cake - which by the way, is a must when you come here. At first glance, I thought that maybe the cake could use a little more cream cheese, but after that first bite, I was secretly hoping that none of my friends would ask to try some. But it was too good, I thought that would be a crime to not let them try. Lastly, if possible, ask to be seated at their outside back patio - which had a very charming feel to it.", "author": "Heather S."}

But he was really talking it up with the other tables. \n\nHe was very good at using his personality to cover up his poor service. We overheard the table next to us complaining about him as well. \n\nBesides his energy, his lack of attentiveness was very apparent. He forgot a dish in our order. We sat with empty plates on our table for about 15 minutes. We never saw him during our main course. When he did have the plates cleared, I asked for a box to take home my leftovers. I watched him walk to another table, where he was laughing and talking and schmoozing it up. We sat at our empty table with a single plate of leftovers for another 10 mins. Then he brings the box over.... No apology, just dropped the box off. \n\nWhen we paid our bill, we left two cards but he came back with the entire bill on charged on one card AND the other card was missing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-08", "description": "Getting a good brunch in San Francisco on weekends is always a hassle - there are quite a few famous ones but the lines are always suuuuuuper long. Read some reviews from fellow Yelpers about how getting to Zazie at 9am on Sunday (which it opens at 9 by the way) still ended up a one-hour wait, I decided this is not going to happen to me.\n\nArrived on Sunday 8:25am and got the first spot in line woohoo! (sorry for being silly but I sacrifice sleep time for good food and *relatively* efficient-er use of time) But Yelpers are right the lines get crazy pretty early - at 8:50am there were about 25-30 people already and clearly, once the restaurant opened it quickly filled up.\n\nA lot of research has been done before getting there. Quickly decided what I wanted. One thing I really like about their menu is that its flexible - for eggs you can choose 1 to 3 eggs and so do pancakes as well.\n\n#La Mer: A-.\nLa Mer is a poached-egg-on-muffin dish with dungeness crab meat. I ordered one egg only since I wanted to try many dishes. The poached egg was very nicely made - perfect temperature and texture. The lemon hollandaise with muffin and avocado worked great together as well. Crab meat on the other hand was a bit disappointing - quantity is very little and perhaps the hollandaise covered it (?) I couldn't really find the crab meat taste at all. I would go for other meat type (the prosciutto one?) next time.\n\nEach poached egg dish comes with a side - either home fries (more like potatoes) or salad. I don't know about the salad but GET THE HOME FRIES! It was so good and became highlight of the dish. The potatoes were perfectly grilled/fried and with a strong sense of garlic. In fact there was one piece of roasted garlic included (accidentally?) and it was super tasty even though I'm not really a eat-whole-piece-garlic of person. Wonderful!\n\n#French Toast Tahiti: A-.\nOrdered one toast for this. While the caramelized banana was simply within expectation, it was the walnuts filling that set a major difference. I'm a huge fan for walnut - the filling perfectly carried out the original walnut taste without being too sweet. The french toast itself was above average.\n\n#Gingerbread Pancake: B+.\nI usually like gingerbread a lot (e.g. the seasonal gingerbread latte from starbucks) and although this pancake did have a sense of gingerbread to it, I did not find it to be impressive. The texture of the pancake was fluffy and that was about it. But luckily the lemon curd saved it - it was so lemonish and this combination of lemon curd and pancakes was so brilliant.\n\nBeing a restaurant with thousands of good reviews I was expecting mediocre service - but not really. My server was super nice and willing to patiently explain the menu to the customers on next table. Very attentive as well and kept coming back to my table for coffee refill. \n\nI would definitely come back for other poached eggs and probably the miracle pancakes too!", "author": "Simon C."}

If you don't have much patience, they have a couple of tables in the front of the restaurant for first come, first serve smaller parties that want food right away/are possibly way behind the wait list that they can't wait too long. Do realize that if you come here on a weekend, you will be eating in front of large groups of people if you do take these seats! We wanted our privacy so we ended up with a little corner in the small garden patio towards the back.\n\nWe ordered and shared three things; the La Mer eggs benedict, New York scramble and the Tahiti French Toast. Everything was really, really good and super filling! I like how they have the options of adding however many eggs (for the benedicts) and pieces of toast (for the French Toast) so it's makes it more easier to share. I would totally recommend all three dishes, especially because they were huge portions for what it was. We were able to devour the egg dishes but ended up taking half of the french toast to go.\n\nThe service was great here too! The servers and the host were really friendly. I would come back here again (or maybe get take-out if the line is way too long) and try their other brunch dishes. Also one important aspect to note; they don't expect tips.

(Yes, we dared to go on Sunday morning. Beware of the line, impatient people!!!!). We arrived around 9:15 (opens at 9), put our name down, and waited a little less than an hour for a table. Seems like a while, but with good company, it really isn't so bad! Also if you're a party of 2, make sure to watch for those 4 front tables. It's a first come, first serve basis, so you can just swoop the table when another party leaves and you don't have to wait on the list!\n\nAfter careful consideration, I ordered Eggs Guillame, which is an eggs benedict that comes with prosciutto and asparagus and home fries or salad. It was very hard to choose which benedict I wanted because they all sounded so good!!! But when the eggs guillame arrived and I got to try it, I was happy with my choice. The eggs were poached perfectly--like literally, perfect. The hollandaise was super tasty too even though i'm not used to it being so lemony. The earthy asparagus balanced out the salty prosciutto wonderfully and a bite of everything together was like a party in my mouth hahaha. I was also really impressed with the home fries. Usually I don't like breakfast potatoes that much, but they were crispy, hot, and garlicky! Garlic makes everything taste better. :P\n\nI also got to try some of the famous miracle pancakes and the Tahitian french toast. Both of them were heavenly!! I can't wait to come back and try them again. One of my friends also really enjoyed her omelette, which was on the special menu as well. She said it was one of the best she's tasted!!\n\nThe service is also amazing here. Our waiter was really friendly and nice about constantly bringing us water (#thirsty), and just very personable in general. When you interact with someone in such a good mood, you get in an even better mood!! Also when a different waiter brought over my benedict, one of the poached eggs fell over to the side so all the hollandaise was on the side of my plate. I guess he saw the disappointment on my face, so he brought me a small container of hollandaise so I could pour it over that egg myself!! :') Service like that is really great to see and makes you wanna come back.\n\nAlso, there is a $1.25 charge per person for the employees health benefits and 401(k)'s.

It was make it or break it, and I really wanted Zazie to wow me. And you know what? They did. I ordered the \"Eggs en Fonte\":\n\n\"Grilled polenta cake w/ spinach, wild mushrooms, spicy tomato-chevre sauce, and two over easy eggs in a cast iron skill w/ home fries or salad\"\n\nThis dish was the best.

After having tried Kitchen Story, Mama's on Washington Square, Sweet Maple, Griddle Fresh, Mission Beach Cafe, Chloe's Cafe, and the like, I've developed a pretty high standard on what good brunch is like.\n\nI decided to stop by on a weekday in an effort to avoid the wait and managed to grab a table right away. Decided to order the florentine Benedict ($15) that comes with mushrooms and spinach. While it may seem that $15 is a bit on the pricy side for a vegetarian eggs Benedict, the fact that Zazie is \"tipless\" (their prices cover a living wage + employee benefits), makes it totally okay with me. \n\nHowever, the food was not totally okay with me. One of the poached eggs on my (2) eggs benedict was completely dwarf sized-- literally half the size of a regular egg. It was pretty unusual and I was surprised that they were okay serving a tiny, deformed egg next to a perfectly round poached egg. Not to mention, the dwarf egg was overcooked and not runny like the one next to it. (see pic) As a side, I had the potatoes and the portion was definitely smaller in comparison to brunch spots like Kitchen Story and Griddle Fresh. Sadly enough, a few of my potatoes were also burnt to a crisp.... like totally black.... so that was disappointing.\n\nWith tax, it came out to be $17 for a very mediocre dish in addition to spotty service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-07", "description": "Every year, when searching for a place for my annual holiday outing, I consider then quickly rule out Zazie.  Their \"no weekend reservations\" policy coupled with the popularity of their brunch makes the place a deal breaker for that event.  But still, with more than 2,800 mostly favorable reviews, it was a place I was interested in trying.  \n\nFirst, I can barely get my head around their popularity.  Cole Valley isn't exactly Valencia Street.  The fact that 2,800+ yelpers went there, found parking, and went on to write about it just about makes my brain explode.  I'd bet there's another 1,000 potential Zazie reviewers still trolling the area looking for parking.  \n\nYou would think a Monday night would be the quietest of nights.  It's the night when most people stay home and most restaurants are closed.  Well, throw that hypothesis out the window.  By 7:45 on a Monday evening, Zazie was packed.  The adorable back patio, every seat inside, and the handful of tables out front.  People were waiting on the sidewalk for a table to open.\n\nMake that people and dogs.  Monday at Zazie is \"bring your dog\" night entitling you to $10 off a bottle of wine and your dog to a bowl of biscuits. Word is out.  Neighbors can't even walk their dogs by here on a Monday without them straining at the leash looking for a Zazie handout.  It's sort of amazing.\n\nAnd I knew all of this why?  \n\nBefore arriving I'd spent a bit of time on their web site trying to ascertain their corkage fee.  I saw an amazing Tuesday night deal where you could bring as much wine as you like and pay zero corkage but for the life of me I could find no info on the normal fee.  But I saw the dog thing and reasoned that I'd bring her and get the discount in case the normal corkage fee was exorbitant.  It wasn't.  Corkage is $15/bottle every day except Tuesday.  \n\nBringing your dog here limits you to outdoor (heated) seating.  On this night, two wedding parties had rented out most of the patio which left me with front patio seating only.  It was far less charming than either the patio or the packed interior but it grew on me as the evening progressed, likely a result of the good wine, the great food, and the comped birthday combo of Chocolate Pot de Creme and Creme Brulee.  \n\nZazie offers a nightly fixed price menu ($29) which is not a bad deal but I wasn't tempted.  That meal provides only 1/2 portioned appetizers and 1/2 portioned desserts, and only certain ones of both.  Entrees are full-sized but also limited.I opted instead for an appetizer of mussels ($12) and an entree of rabbit in a Dijon mustard sauce with fettucini ($24).  Both were wonderful.  This is French bistro fare done perfectly; not frou frou, just rich and satisfying.  \n\nIt's clear that Zazie is not just embraced by locals.  It's something more akin to a love affair.  While finishing the last of my wine I heard a repeat customer (waiting for a table with his dog and two friends) tell them that \"I've had the pork chop 3 times now and it's the best pork chop I've ever had in my life\".  I'd wanted to sit on the back patio and, between the busyness of the night and the two private parties, it hadn't happened.  At the end of the evening the host came and sat down beside me to apologize, ensuring me that I'd get a seat out there \"next time\".  \n\nZazie is very confident that a one-time customer will be a return customer.  That confidence is not unfounded. .", "author": "Tracey A."}

It makes it a little awkward how the people waiting outside, stare you down for a table if you're eating outside. It's first come, first serve for outside patio so be prepared to swoop on a seat if you don't want to wait for a table inside. \n\nLove the theme of this place! Reminds me of a little French bistro in the middle of hipster-ville SF. The menu is as interesting as its name. \n\nI got the cornmeal pancakes with lemon curd and strawberries. The lemon was very tart, a little too tart, but it the flavor balanced well with the sweet strawberries. The pancakes are THICK. I'm sure I could have only ordered one and been full. The consistency has a lot of texture, kind of close to cornbread pancakes. I think I like them better than buttermilk. \n\nMy boyfriend got the Maya benedicts. It was obviously Latin-inspired. Pulled pork with salsa, avocado, perfectly poached egg with hollandaise sauce. So savory! It also comes with a side of \"home fries\" which are red potatoes with cloves of roasted garlic.

I'm crazy right? Yes, I'm crazy. When I arrived, there was at least 50 people standing outside. I was instantly regretting my decision, until I saw that outside seating was first come first serve. Right there an then, I decided to make that my goal as many people came with a party larger than two. I managed to get a table about 30 minutes into my wait. Not bad at all. \n\nAnyways, the food. How was the food? Amazing! I knew off the bat I wanted the poached eggs with bacon and avocado. The eggs were perfectly poached and just absolutely tasty. I'm very impressed with the cooks dedication to really mastering poached eggs as even before I got to try it myself I heard nothing but praise. For seconds I had the French Toast with fruit, and that was just as good. I love that they give you such a hefty portion of fruits. I walked out a happy guy.\n\nFinal verdict: Zazie already has a strong reputation behind it as one of the best brunch places in the city. Now that I've tried it first hand, I completely get why.

I had two french brunch places as I was up here and this was one of them. Came here on Labor Day weekend and only waited about 20 minutes for a table (I think I just got lucky...)\n\nEnvironment - during brunch, the place is very quaint and very nice. There's about 6 tables outside and a bunch of small tables inside. I would think this place is good for 2 people dining together; anything more than 4 for sure would be way too crowded as everything in San Francisco is a little cramped. It can get pretty loud indoors, but nonetheless, you can still hear your partner very well if you lean in a little bit. There's this cute spiral staircase to the front right of the restaurant and i wish there was seating upstairs but it's just a little office that you can see old menus hanging.\n\nService - the servers are very nice and no doubt enjoy what they are doing. Once they found out it was my first time there they immediately gave recommendations on what to eat.\n\nFood - french brunch? yes please :) i definitely foresaw that it was going to be a buttery and delicious meal.\n\nEgg with Crab Benedict - you always have an option of 1,2 or 3 yolks. My boyfriend got 1 yolk and it was definitely enough for him. I understand that Benedicts have the tendency to slide all over the place if not properly eaten... but for the sake of this one, try and cut properly and eating all layers in one bite so you can get the full taste. The crab was fresh and there was such a good amount. I would get it again, no doubt. The side of potatoes was delicious!! NOMNOM. I'm probably such a biased potato-lover. I want to eat this again.. the egg was so soft.. drool!\n\nMiracle Pancakes - I got these because there were so many good reviews and photos on it! So like a good Yelper I was, i got it. Unfortunately, it was not my most favorite thing eaten here. I'm not sure how french pancakes are supposed to be but they were too doughy for my taste. I loved the flavor of the lemon ricotta though. It was my first time having such a flavoral pancake! :) I would hold off on smearing both the butter and syrup on in order to get the full taste.\n\nCoffee - smooth, dark, good.\n\nIf you're in the city and looking for a nice french brunch, you should totally come here.

Literally in front of the restaurant which was a rarity here in San Francisco.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThis little French restaurant is one of those hidden gems in the city. I'm glad that I found this place via Yelp - you're always saving my restaurant-lust. The restaurant is a bit tiny with an outdoor and indoor seating. Before you're seated, you're required to enter your name, seating preference, number of people in your party, etc. in a form outside. We waited for about 20 minutes (which wasn't THAT bad) and we finally got to sit!\n\nFOOD:\nI ordered the scrambled eggs (Mexican) which came with potatoes and bread. The food took a bit to come out because they were hella busy, but it was fine! The food was amazing! The scrambled eggs was rich in flavor and I couldn't get enough of it. To top it off, I sprinkled it with Tobasco. It also came with garlic and oh my... I love garlic!\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nOur server was on-point! He was very attentive and I liked how he seemed to like his job.\n\nOne thing I totally loved about Zazie was that in the menu, it says that it's tip-free. Meaning that they are paying its servers a livable minimum wage with benefits such as paid time off and a 401k plan. I believe that more restaurants should digress from the traditional business model of tipping and progress with this business model. Less stress for the customers and waiters for tipping which equates into better customer service!\n\nI highly suggest coming here and try Zazie's!", "author": "Aj C."}

The hostess refused to even attempt formulating an estimated wait time. Naturally this made me want Zazie even more now! \n\nI returned the next day- the line was even longer, as expected since it was Sunday. So finally, Monday at noon became my magical hour. We waited only 10 minutes for a table and were greeted by a very friendly and efficient server. \n\nThe menu was overwhelmingly packed with stellar choices, and after much debate I finally settled on the \"Italie\" scramble. The eggs were cooked to perfection and mixed with basil, tomato, and cream cheese. It was an exciting dish, but I found the basil and tomato proven\u00e7ales to be extremely overpowering and oily. It was so greasy that my stomach was uncomfortable for the rest of the day. My friend ordered the Fontainbleau scramble and also commented on the oil, but was thoroughly delighted with her meal. Another friend had the Le Mer poached eggs with dungeons crab and explained it as \"heavenly\".\n\nOverall, the experience was fun and expensive.

But it was a perfect Sunday morning. And every excellent brunch place should start with the sentence of \"it's a perfect Sunday morning.\" We crossed the meadow in GGP, walked up a bit, and there it was, a line, no mistake about it, a line and a wait list. T wrote down my name, as mine had four syllables and his got one. To which I said, \"Most people call me Vic, you know.\" The line was long. We had plenty of time to discuss why only so few people call me by the full name and why so many decided to call me Vic. There was the Coles Hardware store selling pretty flowers across the street. There was a huge line forming after we showed up.\n\nBut her is the thing. You are not guaranteed a table just because you are there first. It appears, you could get in that day if you had 3 or more more people faster. Note to those lovebirds out there, not a date place if you can't stand the other person too long, for you may have to wait outside together and endure each other's presence just ever so slightly longer before you are seated to eat.\n\nA 45 minute wait. Respectful for a table for 2 that day, and it was warm outside. Ordered mushroom omelette that came with exotic mushrooms, yummy. Strong and non acid coffee. Bonus. Kept that cup filled please. T ordered a ham and cheese special omelet, a bit boring imo, but perhaps it was for him to pay homage to his midwestern roots.  Surprisingly though, it was quite tasty, maybe it's the avocado that dressed it up. \n\nIn conclusion, excellent food. Seating is tough. It will try your patience during the weekend brunch hours.

This would be confusing for such an upscale place if it wasn't for the \"TIPS ARE ALREADY INCLUDED\" emblazoned across the menu (which naturally arrives a prompt 10 minutes after being seated). Shockingly, removing the economic incentive for good service leads to ... bad service. Go figure. So there's nothing you can do but sit through the indifferent, excruciatingly slow service, stare at your watch, and dream of the coffee that might someday arrive. It's just like being in France! \n\nOh, and in case you start thinking SOMEone might be interested in providing actual service, there's also a \"NO SUBSTITUTIONS ... our small kitchen does its best to keep up\". Poor things! Obviously the stress of running a restaurant is too much for the little darlings - best to do them the favor of not bothering them with your business.\n\nPerhaps it's all just a ploy to give the full European experience.

It was mom and pops first time eating french style brunch and they loved it! \n\nI had the \"Monaco\" with proscuitto and tomatoes, topped with two poached eggs, house made hollandaise sauce on an english muffin serve with home fries. So yummy and delicious! I especially loved the whole roasted garlic in the home fries. You might think they're not edible, but if you squash it in your mouth, its creamy and delicious! \n\nWe had the French Toast Tahiti to share and they were stuffed with caramelized banana and walnuts topped with more bananas served with butter and maple syrup. Can't beat a stack of carbs, sugar, and fat on a Sunday morning!\n\nThe staff were so friendly and were so nice to my mom and dad, and took a family picture for us. My dad loved his bowl of latte!

So I finally pulled the trigger and came with a group of friends last weekend.  \n\nWe arrived not long after 10 am (Sunday morning) and there was already a huge crowd of people waiting outside.  We thought it would be an excruciating wait but figured, \"why not, we were already there and might as well give it a shot.\"  Little did we know, my name was called just 15 minutes after I wrote my name onto the waiting list.  \n\nThe only issue was they require everyone in your party to be present, otherwise they will only hold the table for a few minutes until everyone arrives.  Okay, fine.  We waited another half hour before the rest of our group shows up (they drove from San Bruno & San Jose) and right when we let the host know the group was here, we were seated quite quickly (about 10 minutes or so).\n\nOnce you walk inside, you'll get a feeling that you've walked into a little cozy cafe in Paris (with much better service of course).  We were greeted by our server right away and he took down our drink orders.  After having a tough time deciding between which dishes to order, he gave us a few recommendations, along with his personal opinion on each one.  \n\nWe had a hard time deciding between whether to order the French toast or gingerbread pancakes so he recommended the flight (buttermilk pancake, gingerbread pancake & French toast).  The gingerbread pancake was perfect!  There was a preserved pear right on top of it and it mixed in very well with the gingerbread flavor.  I couldn't help but hog up that particular pancake while the rest of my friends watched as I ate like a pig!  \n\nI opted for their trout dish.  It was cooked to perfection, topped off with tomato and feta.  And it was still nice and juicy, retaining all the flavors without being too dry like other restaurants that serve trout.  \n\nDon't be too intimidated by the long wait.  They move the tables pretty quick and people were getting called left and right so you won't be waiting too long.\n\nNote, the tables outside by the entrance are on a first come first serve basis.  Try to score a seat there and you won't have to wait!", "author": "Roger M."}

We wrote our name down around 1130 and got a table for 2 within 15m, so there wasn't much of a wait! \n\nWe split the French Toast Tahiti and Smoked Salmon poached eggs. Both were delicious and filling. The prices are moderate and the service is great. As others have pointed out, it is tip free as they do pay their employees a living wage and offer them health insurance, so that balances out the higher than normal prices, I suppose.\n\nI don't think the weekend brunch waits are worth it (especially with so many other brunch options in the city), but I recommend going to Zazie on a weekday.\n\nI also went to Zazie recently for dinner, group of 6. Yes they take reservations for dinner! Though the menu is completely different. We had the benefit of sitting in their outdoor area, which I did not even know existed. It was beautifully lit and very warm with the heat lamps despite the cold temperatures that evening, though it did rain pretty heavily that night and we started to feel tiny droplets fall on us at some point.\n\nThere are some great cocktail options on the menu, I had the Greyhound which was delicious. I had the beef bourguignon which was alright, I've had one home cooked that tasted much more fresh and aromatic than the one at Zazie.\n\nDessert: the portions are large for dessert so definitely consider sharing. The baked hot chocolate I'd interesting though it just tastes like chocolate sauce. The creme brulee was great. \n\nThe dinner menu items are really pricey for the not so high end experience, but again, no tip was necessary.

I think it's just nice to eat outside with the green around. And not so squished like it appears for the indoor seating. \n\nWhen you order you can also kinda choose how much food you want, and there are different prices accordingly. For example you can order two or three pieces of French toast - and it would cost either $6 or $8 depending on the size. Which makes it nice for sharing...or not. My friend ordered three piece for his smoked salmon Benedict so that he can have two for himself and one for me. \n\nFRENCH TOAST TAHITI- looking at pictures I was dying to try this, and found it was a little too sweet for me. It's kinda like having dessert for breakfast, but I did like that there's a lot of banana inside. \n\nSIDE OF POTATOES- if anything, this is what I will order and only order. Like just three orders of their potatoes. It is soooo good. It's super crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside with nice garlic flavors and not drenched in oil or anything.

Tables on each side of the door in the front with heaters above. And inside was narrow from what I could see from the outside. About 45 minutes later, we finally heard our names.

It was a drizzly morning so they had the heaters on. I'm glad we had a chance to dine out here. We ordered right away.

Before meeting her there, I perused the menu on their website and read about Zazie's tip-free environment. They price their menu items to incorporate good wages, 401k, profit sharing, and health insurance. This prompted me to see just how high their food was priced, only to find that it is no more expensive than most restaurants in SF serving this kind of high quality food (entrees range from $19 to $31). \n\nWe started with the Assiette de Fromages (cheese plate) and the Asiette Charcuterie )meat plate). Both came with lots of toast points/bread and each cheese and meat was a healthy portion. I loved having olives, cornichons, dried figs in syrup, and a heaping pile of mixed greens with a lovely dressing served alongside the meat & cheese. The salmon rilletes was the best I've ever had!\n\nOur waitress warned us when we had initially sat down that the kitchen was down to one pork chop.

The pork chop was fantastically seasoned, huge in size, and simply delicious. But, the real show stealer was the savory bread pudding, consisting of challah bread, fontina cheese, and bacon. It was one of the best things I have consumed in 2015. It was so good that I brought a side home for my better half. Everyone should get to experience this dish!\n\nAlbeit very full, we decided to split a dessert and opted for the Cuit de Chocolat Chaud - \"baked hot chocolate\" topped with a massive layer of golden marshmallows. Very decadent and it reminded me of a grown-up s'mores rendition. \n\nZazie's ambiance is very European, it is dimly lit and the main dining room is very cosy. The staff is warm, attentive, and fun. We left will our bellies full of good food and wine (we only polished 2 of our 3 bottles off that we brought). I will be back here to try their brunch soon, but dinner was definitely outstanding!", "author": "Anna R."}

The other egg dishes at our table were the same, good but nothing too remarkable (eggs any style w/bacon, poached egg florentine and an egg special). \n\nThe French Toast Tahiti was a whole other story. These were the fattest most overwhelmingly sweet but somehow very good slices of bread I have ever eaten. The caramelized banana and walnut spread made these stand out and could have been eaten on its own. \n\nThe line is out the door even before the doors open so get there early to put your name on the list.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-11-09", "description": "Zazie is quite hyped up. Some reasons for this are valid. The owner is a woman and they pay their employees excellent salaries and benefits. The prices are reasonable given tip is included in the fees. Having traveled extensively in Asia and Europe, a no tipping policy is refreshing to see in the U.S. The back patio is a nice hangout spot in a city that is surprisingly lacking in outdoor restaurant space. \n\nZazie is very middle of the road in terms of taste of food. This is quite disappointing and leaves me wondering if popularity can influence people's perceptions of quality so easily. This has been proven about wine in research studies. People find expensive wine tastes better when they are told it is expensive wine. However, when they are blinded to price, people often prefer the taste of less expensive wine. (As a non drinker, this is more fascinating than utilitarian.) Everything is filtered through our mindsets. \n\nLastly, Zazie is yet another example of the deleterious effects of social media. Nothing is hidden. The owner went on a rant about children. While nobody likes ill mannered children, this is more a reflection on the parents inability or unwillingness to teach manners. Children who cry are not ill mannered. They have valid reasons for this. I always feel for parents traveling with children on planes. They are viewed so negatively and it's unfair. One would hope the owner would rethink her views on house arrest for new parents. \nhttp://m.sfgate.com/news/article/Zazie-restaurant-owner-apologizes-kids-Facebook-6614956.php", "author": "Zak R."}

I'm not too particular when it comes to the classic late breakfast/early lunch meal, but I know when I've eaten something extraordinary. And this was extraordinary.\n\nThis place has been on my list for awhile and I'm so happy I can now say I've experienced Zazie. A rainy and cold Sunday was brightened by the food, staff, ambiance, and setting of this awesome place. I want to go back. Literally, right now.\n\nIn classic lazy Sunday fashion, our initial brunch plans turned into late (2:30pm) lunch plans. But, brunch was still ingrained in our minds so we went for the Genevieve scrambled eggs (with ham, cheese, and avocado), home fries, and the egg/bacon/pancake combo. Gingerbread pancake?? I've never had one...and holy ---- it was amazing....with a pear on top. My scrambled eggs?? SO GOOD with the ham and avocado. The homefries?? I can't speak...a great combo of garlic/onion/salt/pepper that came together perfectly. \n\nOther stuff:\n-Cool backyard patio that I'd love my house to have one day. Lights, nice wood, ivy, awning, heaters.\n-VERY accommodating staff (they got us a table even though we missed our name being called).\n-Amazing food.\n\nThat's all I need to say.

My friends and i were seated in the patio area since everywhere inside was full. The patio area was very romantic and lit up with heaters at each table. As it got colder into the night, automatic shades stretched out over the patio to seal in the heat. My first impression of this place was the authenticity and the friendly french lady who served us. I think her name was Elsa. She was very attentive and personable and helped us order the dishes she thought we'd like. \n\nMy second impression was based on the menu...the prices. This place is a little pricey so i recommend this place if you wanna impress your date on your classy taste of food. Between us the dishes included mac and cheese, cream of mushroom soup, niman ranch burger, and the pasta. I got the salmon. That was all 80 bucks including the 1.25 each for the bread they give at the beginning. There was four of us so avg... $20 each. Ill admit my salmon dish was delicious. I enjoyed the sauce and the spinach and other veggies that were served cooked in this parchment paper.

Here in SF On a family vacation, and after a few too many meals in the touristy fisherman's wharf area, we are looking for something local and authentic. And did we find it. Fantastic Parisian, coffeehouse feel with great food to match. It was a Monday morning, so no wait. Our waiter was super accommodating. We shared the seasonal poundcake to start and it was delicious. They are known for their eggs Benedict specials but I ordered the fountainbleu scrambled eggs (contains mushrooms, spinach and cheese) with a side salad. My wife ordered scrambled egg whites with gluten free English muffin and bacon. Both were delicious. The restaurant may be a few dollars more per entree than others but it's totally worth it for 3 reasons: 1) the food is delicious, 2) Price includes tip (can leave extra cash if you prefer) and 3) they include healthcare/dental benefits, 401(k), and paid parental leave/time off for their entire staff.

For brunch, you must sign in on a clipboard, and eventually, they'll call your name! To note--Zazie's prices include tip (they don't accept gratuity) so though the prices may seem a little steep, they're not as bad as you might think.\n\nI ordered the eggs benedict Florentine and asked for a few tomatoes proven\u00e7ales on the side. The hollandaise sauce was probably the best I've ever had, the potatoes were seasoned perfectly, and the tomatoes really added a nice touch to the dish. I also had a bloody mary, which was just OK. I dined alone and was texting my French friend throughout the meal. She asked to see the brunch menu, which she found very funny because it's not traditionally French at all. But the whole idea of brunch is American and not French anyway (they don't really do eggs or potatoes in the morning, oatmeal is foreign to them, etc.). So I'd say Zazie brunch is mostly American with some French flair. Their dinner menu looks a little bit more \"authentic French\" but is definitely still American-French fusion.\n\nAll that pretentious \"FYI\" info aside, I very much enjoyed my brunch at Zazie, and I'd say it was well worth the wait!", "author": "Emily G."}

Outdoor seating is first come, first served. We didn't find this out until we  saw a couple of girls went & just sat at the table that just left. So just FYI!\n\nWe only waited like 25 mins tops with about 13 parties in front of us so it was really quick!\n\nThe utilized their space as far as their seating is concerned. We were seated at a two person table that was perfect for us since we are two smaller/shorter people but if we were taller, it would be a problem.\n\nTheir menu states that there is no TIPPING. I took a picture of their little message that they state at the top of the menu. It's pretty much stating that the prices are set at what they're set at in order to take into consideration all that tipping would go towards. Pretty interesting & cool. First restaurant I have been to with that way of thinking. I dig it.\n\nAlright, water is provided upon request as we are in CA & the drought is real.\nThey give you glasses & a bottle of water so that you can pour it yourself.\n\nWhat did I order?\nI ordered the Fontainbleau Scrambled Eggs which is their term for omelet I believe. It had portabellos, shiitake, porcinis, spinach & fontina. I asked for fruits on the side instead of the hashbrowns but I should've just asked for the hashbrowns with the fruit because I was charged full-priced any ways. I guess their menu was right in saying there is no substitution. OMG, it was BOMB though. Sooooo yummy! So much flavor!

We got in line at 8:45, and we were lucky and snagged one of the tables out front that is first come first served out front. For the other seating you have to put your name down on a list. 15 minutes before opening was perfect- we would've gotten seated right away even if we had put our names on the list! We decided to try 3 dishes between the two of us- we got 2 of the divorcee eggs benedict, 2 of the french toast tahiti, and 3 of the miracle pancakes (they were bread pudding that morning)! Everything was awesome- I like to think of myself as somewhat of an eggs benedict conoisseur, and I have to admit these were amazing! The hollandaise was rich and creamy, eggs perfectly poached, and the avocado, cheese, crispy bacon combo is to die for. The home fries that came with the eggs were also awesome with sweet pieces of caramelized garlic cloves mixed in with the potatoes! The french toast and the pancakes were both great as well. The french toast was sturdy and hearty, and it came with a banana walnut mixture sandwiched between the two slices giving an extra layer of flavor. The bread pudding pancakes were also super unique with a great combo of the breadiness of the bread pudding intermixed with the fluffy pancake. I personally liked the pancake a little better, but the boyfriend preferred the french toast, but order either and you won't be disappointed!

The food arrived after 15 minutes. \n\nLet's talk about the food:\n\nThe miracle pancakes were definitely to die for. I'm usually not so hungry during breakfast/lunch time, so one pancake definitely hit the spot for me. It came beautifully, the pancake with the perfect amount of lemon ricotta on top, a dollop of butter, and maple syrup on the side. This pancake was the first of its kind to be tasted with my taste buds. I expected the pancake to be fluffy and light, but this one was different. Instead, it was dense and rich, in a good way. The lemon had the right amount of tangy and light, which complimented the rich pancake. However, the syrup sealed the bite, as it gave the bite the right amount of sweetness. Overall a perfect pancake.\n\nI can't give the eggs benedict a thorough review because I only took a few bites, as I was full from my pancake. However, from watching my boyfriend eat it, I'm sure it was great as well. It passed the egg porn test, as the yolk was oozing out of the egg in the most elegant way.

Not to worry though, the wait time wasn't that long. An employee checked our names on the list and said it would be about a 45min wait and he was about right. People come in and out pretty quickly. Also note, you can sit outside in the back where the shaded patio is, inside, or the front of the restaurant (sunny). While waiting you can go to the front door and read the menu and how they treat their employees. The employees get full perks here so there's no need to tip. \n\nIn Vietnam portions aren't as big, so when I got back I was still on that mindset. I ordered the eggs benedict with bacon and avocado with 2 eggs (you get an option of 1,2 or 3). Also ordered some pancakes (3 stacks?) with strawberries. When the food came out, I thought, crap, I ordered too much food. \n\nEggs Benedict (Bacon, Avocado):\nThe eggs were cooked to perfection, nice and runny the way I like it. The hollandaise sauce had a sour taste that was a tad more distinct than i'm used to. It was different, but wasn't bad. The bacon was crispy and the avocados were fresh. Overall the eggs benedict was really good. The meal also came with potatoes on the side (you can get salad if you want). I wish they had crispy potatoes or hash browns instead. I didn't care of the potatoes that much. \n\nStrawberry Pancake: \nI really enjoyed the pancake, I thought it was the best part of the meal. I only had a couple of bites because I was stuffed, but the pancakes were delicious! It was perfectly fluffy, wasn't too sweet, and the yellow sauce they put on top of the pancakes give it a whole different flavor. It didn't taste like your typical pancake. \n\nZazie is a great brunch place!  It's a bit pricey, but considering how well they treat their employees I don't mind paying a little extra.

When we were driving there, I knew I've been craving some poached eggs, but also heard so much about their carb heavy french toast and gingerbread pancakes.  I've been craving poached eggs, especially since they can be a little tricky to make at home..always go with your gut instinct/craving, right?  \n\nAbout a minute after being seated on the patio I finally decided on two poached eggs, but the dilemma was which one?  I wanted the crab one, but crab season was over, so I went with the Monaco, which was a proscuitto and tomato provanceles.  He went with the two egg St. Trop which consisted of smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers and red onions.  We both also chose the side of home fries over the salad, after all it's breakfast NOT lunch..haha.  \n\nAfter some time, our wonderful eggs were presented in front of us.  They tasted as good as they looked.  The eggs were perfectly cooked as the yolk oozed from them as it was punctured, coating my wonderfully salty delicious proscuitto on top of the english muffin.  The hollandaise sauce was nice and light, we didn't taste any hint of lemon though.   His eggs were cooked just as well and the salmon was so fresh.  The cream cheese, red onions and capers worked well with the salmon and the drizzle of hollandaise sauce as well.  We thought it was a little odd that cooked pieces of garlic with the peels on were thrown on to our plate with the home fries.  We cracked open some of the garlic and it didn't have much flavor to them nor did it give the home fries any flavor either.  In fact, the home fries were a little on the bland side.  \n\nLoved the cute patio with those awesome space heaters.  I'd prefer a seat on the patio too as it's a little cramped inside.  Service was a little on the slow side, but not bad.  Glad I finally got to try Zazie.

It did not disappoint. I imagine if you had one day to live and you have three final meals to choose and you choose Zazie for breakfast you would not be criticized too heavily. The atmosphere is relaxed and classy. The little touches are evident, eg bottle cap magnets that hold the check against a piece of metal. I had the croque madame (ham, gruyere, sunny side egg on challah) and it was delicious. We had a miracle pancake (flavors rotate) which was perfectly fluffy. Two tiny downsides: the fact that they pay there staff very well means it's expensive, so you (I) couldn't go here every day, which sucks.

Right when you walk in, everything is decorated in a very artsy and modern way. Including the people dining  as well, I have to say. I went with 2 friends for our first time up there visiting and we decided to sit in the backyard section of the restaurant, since it was a sunny day in SF. And WOW it was so pretty , plants and vines everywhere and the tables were wood and it felt like I was in a fairytale almost. The waiter came right away with water in a glass jar and gave us our menus. We all ordered different things but I believe I got the best dish. I ended up ordering crab and avocado Benedict's with a fresh greens salad. The wait was about 20 minutes, so not so bad. When the food came I have to say presentation, alright, taste fairly good though.\n\n This place is an overall awesome place to go dress up nice and eat, the place is beautiful and there's so much air to breathe in while you sit and chat as well. The costumer service was wonderful and this place is DOG FRIENDLY!!! How cool is that. The taste and quality of the food was very good and this place was just a very unique experience for me.

They have a heated patio garden and the front outside tables are first come first serve but I am a pansy and just moved from San Diego. This SF chill has been killing me. \n\nAnyway between the three of us we had the Gingerbread Pancakes, the Croque Monsieur , and one of the poached egg dishes. Everything was good. The potatoes that come with eggs are crispy and come with whole garlic cloves! The gingerbread pancakes are light but thick with sublime lemon curd. And the croque monsieur was the real showstopper- so much cheese! We also got a round of bloody marys- very good but does not come with many pickled veggies (I always like a lot).\n\nOne interesting thing about Zazie is they don't allow tipping and include everything in the flat price.

The decor and atmosphere felt very French -- a little slice of Paris plopped in the middle of Cole Valley.\n\nFor breakfast, I decided to have poached eggs \"la mer\" style (dungeness crab, onions, and avocados) on English muffins with Hollandaise sauce -- in other words, a crabcake benedict.  And this benedict was absolutely perfect.  I'd never had a Hollandaise so light and flavorful.  And the crab?  Cooked to perfection.  The poached eggs came with crispy breakfast potatoes -- complete with freshly roasted garlic cloves!  Total yum. \n\n(Side note: I love the fact that Zazie lets you customize your portion size.  In the mood for just a little snack?  Order just 1 egg.  Feeling gluttonous?  Order 3.  I split the difference and had 2.  I wish all restaurants let me do this.)\n\nOn the side, I had a cup of fruit (simple but delicious) and, to wash it all down, a glass of the Zazie spritzer.  I really enjoyed the spritzer, which was a blend of fruit juices with carbonated water.  It was a refreshing (and alcohol-free) alternative to the typical mimosa or bellini.\n\nService was fast and friendly, too.

So unless you have some compelling need to have your name called out from a list, after waiting out on the sidewalk, take a seat!\n\nI had something called the Griddle Flight--which I think should be called the Griddle Fight because it's catchier.

One email to Jen and she helped me scheme an over the top surprise for the Mrs.  The restaurant accepted my floral deliveries, provided champagne on arrival, and gave us dark corner on the patio (the very corner we sat in for our wedding dinner, in fact) with white table service etc.  So my surprise dinner successfully turned into my wife's surprise dinner.  Everything was executed perfectly, and communication between all of the staff was perfect.  Not one ball was dropped.  ...and as usual, the food was spectacular.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-22", "description": "This place is so hyped up, so why am I even bothering to write a review? I'll be honest, it's mostly because I think it's worth pointing out that (as of June 2015) they have a really great no-tipping policy. According to their menu, \"Our menu prices include a living wage, profit sharing, fully funded health & dental insurance, paid sick leave, and a 401(k) with employer match for all our hard working employees.\" Definitely something I'm down to stand behind, considering how broken the system of tipping is in America. Props to Zazie for being willing to raise prices in order to build in a fair wage and benefits for their employees.\n\nNo-tipping policy aside, Zazie serves up a pretty great brunch. You can tell by the lines on weekends that brunch here is serious business. Don't be scared off, though, the line moves fairly fast (probably averages an hour wait for 2-4 people), and the host is crazy efficient with the process: they really know how to run a brunch place in SF. Plus, there's a Peet's next door so you can grab coffee while you wait...but don't stray too far, they don't seat you until the whole party is there!\n\nAnyway, enough about the lines, here's some tips (see what I did there?) about the food: Zazie is best experienced with friends. And by that I mean, grab a friend or two and split a few dishes, some savory and some sweet, so you can get the best of both brunch worlds. My personal favorites:\n- Eggs La Mer: In simpler terms, this is a Crabs Eggs Benedict, and it is amazing. Everything you love about crab and avocado and poached eggs in one fantastic combination. Also comes with a side of deliciously well-seasoned home fries.\n- If you're into spice, ask for the house-made hot sauce: It's really spicy and will give everything a nice kick!\n- Gingerbread Pancakes: I'm not particularly into gingerbread, but this is dish is really, really good. The pancakes are soft and thick and fluffy, and the light gingerbread flavor goes really well with the poached pears and butter. It melts in your mouth in the best way.\n\nA friend once described this place as \"a San Francisco staple\" and I completely understand why.

Now, while the latter was true, the wait still sucked, and, with waits like this, the expectations are raised exponentially. We ended up getting a smattering of dishes (to compensate for the long wait, in a way), including:\n\n* Brunch Flight (Challah French Toast, Lemon Ricotta Pancake, Gingerbread Pancake) - A little something our waiter helped put together for us to help us save a few bucks, since we were ordering one of each of these anyway. The Challah French toast had good texture, but was on the bland side (especially compared to the Tahiti), while the pancakes were both enjoyable, but slightly denser and sweeter than I would have preferred. \n\n* French Toast Tahiti - On first bite and impression, the Tahiti is a pretty tasty dish. By the second bite though, you start to find that it's a bit too sweet (even without the additional syrup), and a bit too mushy, with very little to offset the softness of both the toast and the bananas.\n\n* Albert Eggs Benedict - Maybe I just like my savory foods more, but this was definitely the best of the bunch. Even then though, I found it a bit lacking. Also, I think this is the first time I've ever had shredded, unmelted cheese on a benedict.\n\nSo, in the end, nothing really wowed me.

The potatoes on the side were delicious though!\n\nI was really hoping to love Zazie's because of everything I heard about it. Sadly, it didn't play out like that.

How I haven't posted a review yet is beyond me (although its probably my subconscious selfishly not wanting any more people to know about them than already do!).\n\nAlways busy and bustling, no matter what time or day of the week. I cannot speak warmly enough of the staff, but ESPECIALLY Mario!! He is fantastic and makes every visit that much better. Mario is so friendly and accommodating, always seats me out on the back patio that I love so much and sometimes even brings me a little something extra to make my morning even sweeter.\n\nTheir Monaco Benedict (with prosciutto and tomatoes proven\u00e7ales) has absolutely ruined me, as in I can no longer order any Benedict anywhere else because theirs is so consistently fantastic and delicious, and no other restaurant can hold a candle to them. I can't help but order this every single time I go (with maybe one or two exceptions); it's always perfect and I haven't gotten slightly tired of it in over three years!\n\nAnother favorite would be the Mexico Scramble (with chorizo, white cheddar, and salsa) which is absolutely delicious and dripping with goodness. I love their potatoes (especially the gooey, whole roasted cloves of garlic) but often choose salad instead for something light. Any of their miracle pancakes are incredible, and I have been dying to try the bread pudding ones but unfortunately these are (obviously) incredibly popular and I don't often make it in early enough! Their Oatmeal Brulee with bruleed bananas or French Toast Tahiti are both delightful sweet dishes.\n\nThis review is reaching book proportions, but I should mention their chai and espresso drinks come in giant bowls that are both impressive and delicious, though I am happy enough with just a cup of their drip coffee. \n\nLastly, the owner of Zazie is a wonderful woman who also came from waiting in the service industry and has worked hard to make sure her staff is taken good care of and know they are not just interchangeable. They all receive full benefits, dental, paid sick leave, 401k, and profit sharing. They recently made news by becoming the first restaurant in San Francisco to become tip free! While this may mean a slightly steeper price for each menu item, I for one am happily go out of my way to support and frequent a restaurant that cares about the \"little guy\" and makes sure we service industry workers are treated right and receive a truly livable wage.\n\nPS. If you're scared off by the line, head nextdoor to Finnegan's Wake for a drink before. Just let Mario know you'll be there, and remember to bring cash!", "author": "Sophie H."}

Once you get within a couple blocks of the place, just start looking for parking, as you're not likely to find much very close. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is really small with limited seating. They do have outdoor seating both in front and back of the restaurant as well. The line seemed to move fairly quick, which was a pleasant surprise. The service was also great. Great recommendations and very friendly.\n\nThe food was amazing! It is pricey, but I believe that's because of their no tipping policy, so it's essentially built into the bill. My latte literally came in a bowl, which was pretty awesome. I tried the Monaco, which was delicious. Their lemon hollandaise sauce really is good. The home fries were also cooked perfectly with a nice crisp crunch to them. Also tried Sarah Jane's Griddle Flight. Highly, highly recommend this dish if you can't decide what kind of pancake you want. The gingerbread pancake was delicious!

Just tasted like a typical breakfast place with a very nice outdoor seating area.  I think this place is mainly for the atmosphere.  Way over hyped, but I did enjoy the environment. For breakfast, I can definitely go else where for the same or better quality.  It was pretty pricey too for the amount of food I got!  \n\nI got the \"Monaco\" for $15 (before tax and tip).  Came with two eggs Benedict and a side of potatoes or salad.  My eggs were perfectly cooked, but my friend's wasn't.  His was really over cooked, yolk was practically solid.  My eggs were oozing out when I cut into it, perfect!  Flavors were good.  Had a decent amount of prosciutto.  I got my Benedict with a side of salad.  The salad was super simple! Just some super plain mixed greens and some really light dressing (no flavor in the dressing).  Definitely nothing special at all about the salad.  \n\nGood breakfast food with a very nice atmosphere, but not worth the long wait and price for breakfast.  It's hard to mess up on breakfast, so I could definitely go elsewhere for better price and just the same or better.

We split a pancake flight and then ordered separate savory dishes to share.\n\nI ordered a one egg combo with chicken apple sausage, garlic potatoes, and wheat bread.  The bread is made right in the restaurant and is some of the best bread I've ever tasted.  The subtle blend of apple with chicken also provided a hint of sweet and savory in each bite.

He seemed friendly, casual, and hip, tall with a porkpie hat and I *think* an Australian accent, not sure about that. As we were finishing our appetizers, the couple at the table nearest us gave us their bottle of wine, which still had a third left and they didn't want to waste it. That was a nice surprise. The waiter saw the bottle on our table and came over to charge us a corkage fee, but we explained the situation. He said, \"They should have given me that bottle!\" We thought he was trying to be funny, but maybe he really meant it, because he went off to get himself a glass. He asked if he could taste the wine, which was already weird, but we said sure. He poured himself a WHOLE GLASS and walked off. Then, near the end of the meal, when there was still a bit of wine left in the bottle, he cleared the plates and took the bottle away, without asking us if we were done. He whisked it away--we didn't have a chance to register what he'd done and object. \nThis restaurant does not expect any tips. Instead they charge more up front and give all of their staff decent pay and benefits. This is great...but I wonder if our waiter would have helped himself to our wine if it would have meant no tip.

So don't expect for them to change or substitute much on your orders--basically DON'T BE COMPLICATED. \n& Tip is already included in the bill, so that's a plus that this place cares about their workers. \n\nOverall, great experience every time I brunch here and I would definitely recommend!", "author": "Grace T."}

This place was my breakfast stop before visiting UCSF. Simply, it made me happy. We sat on the back patio that was empty when we walked out but quickly filled up in the next few minutes because it has just opened. It was so sunny and mid 70s so it was hard not to be happy. I started with the chai and the greek eggs with a side of sausage. The chai is big and is a large portion. It's a little less milky with more flaovr than most chais. The greek eggs were standard but I thoguth the chicken apple sausage was particularly flavorful and nice and HOT! which is always nice. I would rate this more of the $$$ range personally than $$ given we paid $6 for the chai if that gives an idea. We came back again when my brother in law came into town, this time on a weekend. The wait was more longer, the energy was good and at that time I got the same chai with the un deux trois which was great having a little taste of everything. I will go back again and hope to have more of these cute cozy breakfast/brunch mornings in this sunny space. Total comfort space.", "author": "Natasha B."}

Once in, it was a small and cramped place but somehow the workers seemed to maneuver through the space with no problem.\n\nSince we had waited for a while, we were able to look over the menu and were ready to order when we sat down. I got Un, Deux, Trois with french toast instead of pancakes (1 carb, 2 eggs, and 3 pieces of bacon). That La Mer (crab benedict) was seriously pulling at me though. My favorite part of the menu was customization of the number of pieces for most of the orders that you could get (1, 2, or 3). It covers most people's stomach sizes and I liked that. My french toast was a bit of a disappointment as it didn't really have any flavor and just tasted like soggy toast to me.\n\nOur server was pretty awesome and even though I can't remember his name, I remember that he was on point with jokes and comebacks!

But be warned, when its a really nice day, you'll be baking out there. I sat out there once and it was ridiculously hot.\n\nAnyway, the food here is always on point. I've had the pierre noir benedict and the tahitian french toast. Both were ridiculously amazing!!

The tip, and the waiters benefits are incorporated into the price of the meal. Pretty convenient, I still feel like leaving a little something, but they let you know you don't need to leave a tip. \n        The place is hard to get into, even on a weekday.

I also make sure to have whatever Miracle-special they've got concocted for the day (cornmeal pancakes, berried french toast, etc). A single bite is enough to illicit the fluttering deep inside, from the sweet melting on your tongue to the melting of your heart.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a catch: there is seemingly always an extraordinarily long line (even on weekday afternoons!). Don't fret, it's just so good that nobody ever wants to leave! It's definitely worth it.\n\nThe supper menu, however, is meh.

Everything we ordered was delicious and my mouth is watering just thinking about the food again.\n\nI came here for brunch with my husband and a friend at around 10:30 am on a Saturday and probably didn't get a table until close to 11:30 am so definitely plan ahead. Make sure you sign in by the entrance!\n\nFOOD:\nLatte & Cappuccino - Both were tasty and served in bowls without mug handles.\n\nAlbert Poached Eggs w/ Home Fries - The eggs were poached perfectly and the combination of hollandaise, salsa fresca, bacon and cheese was delicious. We ordered three eggs (one for each of us) and it worked out great. The home fries had whole cloves of roasted garlic in them which was awesome. I only wished there was more since we had to split the home fries three ways. Next time, I'd order an extra side of  home fries if sharing again.\n\nFrench Toast Tahiti - OMG this was so good. The caramelized banana and walnut combined with the nice texture of the French toast was amazing. We ordered two pieces to share between three people and it was the perfect amount for tasting. I would definitely order this again.\n\nMiracle Pancakes - These were some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The special flavor was fresh strawberries & lemon curd which was delicious. I only wish there was more lemon curd to go with each bite of pancake, but the syrup that was provided was delicious also. The pancakes had a cornmeal-y texture that I really enjoyed. We ordered two pancakes to share between three people and again, it was a good amount for tasting. I would definitely order this again.\n\nSERVICE:\nOnce seated, the waiter was very friendly, quick and attentive. The food came out quickly and a bottle of water was provided on the table so we always had water stocked. What more can you ask for?\n\nOVERALL:\nI want to go back to Zazie for brunch again and again! Everything I tasted there was so yummy.

The wait was minimal after 9 AM the Tuesday post-Memorial Day. Unfortunately, the backyard dining area was still closed since it was in the process of drying off from the earlier precipitation.\n\nOur waitress was a cheerful and smiling gal. The atmosphere was cute and decorated with small French posters. Seating was sorta cramped. I heard more than enough of the conversations at the adjacent tables. A man at one of tables next to us had one of those voices that jabbed right into our ear canals, annoying.\n\nThe organic signature tea ($4.95) was my selection for a beverage. I thought it was for one person, but it came out in a big silver pot and was the gift that kept giving. So I would recommend it for two or more people. Thankfully you can get a to-go cup for the rest! It kind of reminds me of Sleepytime tea, wish the apricot flavor were stronger however.\n\nMy brother and I decided to share the gingerbread pancakes and the St. Trop and La Mer Benedicts. Each pancake is pretty substantial. We both loved these cakes of the pan! The lemon curd is such a wonderful complement, and the roasted pear looks like a potato but is lovely. Squeeze the orange wedge for a little extra citrus taste. And the syrup adds the just perfect touch of sweetness.\n\nYou can get one, two, or three eggs with your Benedicts, and you have your choice of home fries or salad. It was tough to decide which Benedict was better. We liked them both equally! I joked that we got West Coast ones and East Coast ones since the salmon, capers, and onions reminded me of NYC bagel accoutrements.\n\nThe kitchenside bathroom was an adventure. You pull the door closed, but it doesn't close completely. Since I had to wait to use it, I occupied my time by staring at a tremendous tower of bacon in a pan and spied on some naked Benedicts getting clothed.\n\nZazie's been penciled in for a return brunch when I'm back in the city!", "author": "Lisa H."}

One of my friends also happened to be in the city and we really wanted brunch food, so we decided to check out Zazie. \n\nAlthough all of the other restaurants in the area were pretty empty on a Friday morning, Zazie was quite packed. My friend hadn't arrived yet, so I put our names on the list and waited with a crowd of other people. \n\nI had a book with me, but I couldn't resist eavesdropping on the conversations of the other people waiting outside. Basically, it seems like everyone in SF just hooks up with random people all of the time, and no one is happy about how the experience went. However, I guess the unsatisfying hook ups are not bad enough for people to change their behavior or for them to be too ashamed to tell their friends at brunch (in great detail, mind you). Well, that's SF for you, I guess. \n\nEventually, my friend showed up and we were seated inside. Everything on the menu looked great, but I ended up selecting the Eggs en Fonte. This dish consists of grilled polenta cake with spinach, mushrooms, and a \"spicy\" tomato-chevre sauce (the quotation marks indicate that I think it wasn't actually spicy at all), all covered by two over-easy eggs baked in a cast iron skillet. I ordered my dish with home fries and bacon. \n\nSome elements of this dish were outstanding. The bacon was top notch. It was crispy, thick, and perfectly salty. When I cut into the eggs, the yolk oozed down into the spinach and polenta adding a richness to them. The tomato sauce was zesty, but certainly not spicy. The mushrooms just seemed to get in the way of the other flavors without really contributing anything to the dish. Overall though, I really enjoyed this. \n\nThe service was quite French, which is to say that it was very slow. If you come here for brunch, you should definitely not have plans for at least a few hours. \n\nOverall, I'd probably rate this place 3 stars, but the bacon was so good that I have to give them 4. I'm not really a fan of these French brunch places that have long lines and slow service. I live a block away from La Note in Berkeley, and I've only been there four times in three years. For me, good breakfast food isn't that hard to make, and their slightly-better-than-good breakfast food at relatively high prices and with a long wait isn't really worth it.

I also like how as of maybe a year ago, the tip is built into the menu prices, an attribute that I think would behoove other restaurants to emulate. Calculating tip is stressful, time-consuming, and just plain annoying, and this place I think has it right.\n\nI do however, have a major issue. The issue is their bacon. They used to have thick, rich slabs of bacon, one of the essential reasons I began coming here at the initial recommendation of a friend. Probably the best bacon I'd ever had to be quite honest. As of maybe 6 months ago, they began using some other standardized, unexciting, extremely low-to-average tasting bacon, which, while perhaps not unusual for another restaurant, is a huge deal for my relationship with Zazie.\n\nBecause of this I don't think I'll be returning, unless I hear they bring the old bacon back, at which time I would probably bump up the review. Is it fair to downgrade them a star because of one menu item? I think so, given the fact that this was one of their marquee draws and they completely changed it with no explanation whatsoever.

So, I don't know if our ~40 min wait was typical. It was crazily crowded  in front of the restaurant, but the huge number of couples and families sweating it out in the hot sun in order to get a seat motivated me to see what the hype was all about. \n\nTo get both the savory and sweet breakfast types we shared (1) the benedict special of the day, the Eggs Guillaume, which included prosciutto and asparagus, and (2) the popular French Toast Tahiti, which is a soft challah bread stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts. They garnish it with caramelized bananas on top as well. I'm glad we chose to get salad instead of homefries with the eggs since it balanced out the rich hollandaise sauce well. Even though the french toast is already plenty sugary by itself, I couldn't resist dousing it with the syrup provided to serve as breakfast-dessert. Zazie is so successful not for quirky dishes but very classical and well done french food; it is tasty but not unique. Beware that Zazie automatically charges an extra $1.25 per person on top of the assortment of other fees associated with dining in SF.", "author": "Amy G."}

During the wait, my boyfriend and I went down a couple blocks to The Ice Cream Bar, which was good. We came back up and weren't very hungry, but still managed to finish our plates with satisfaction.\n\nAll I can say is, their food may be a bit on the pricey side, but most \"good\" brunches are around the same price now.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-20", "description": "Zazie is a lovely little French-inspired breakfast spot that offers a French atmosphere in a very San Franciscan building with foods like poached eggs, pancakes and sandwiches. They offer some brunch alcoholic drinks like mimosas and they have specials each day. I tried their pancake special for $9 (for 1). You can choose between 1, 2 or 3 pancakes for different prices. You can do the same with the poached egg. The pancake I had (called the miracle pancake) was poppyseed with lemon curd and some strawberries. The miracle pancake flavor changes so just ask or look @ the specials menu to find out what the flavor is. It came with some butter and syrup but the maple syrup wasn't necessary because the lemon curd made the pancake very flavorful. There weren't a lot of strawberries on top but the ones that it did have were super sweet! I think blueberries would have been a nice fruit pairing with the lemon curd and poppyseed. I also tried a poached egg with pancetta and a side salad. The poached egg was perfectly cooked and laid atop the pancetta and a 1/2 English muffin. The dish wasn't quite a benedict because it didn't have the hollandaise sauce. You had the option of having the poached egg with a spring salad or some fries. I opted with the salad which had a really light dressing. It also came with a wedge of orange (the sweetest orange I've ever tasted!). Street parking can be difficult but I lucked out. Unfortunately, where I parked, directly across the restaurant, was 30min parking only so my friend had to exit mid-meal to refill our meter. This restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating  (both out in the back patio and in front of the restaurant). The high prices are warranted because they don't allow you to tip. Not tipping is custom in France. I tried a bite of my friend's mushroom & egg sandwich & thought it was very fresh. I really like the French posters on the wall & the skylight. The ceilings are high which makes the small space seem a little more spacious.", "author": "Brenda L."}

It cost us $69 per person.  Let me just say I've had far better tasting menus around $35 per person, I really have NO IDEA where the $150 went to, I guess it went to paying people to cut our food into heart shapes, because the food was nothing special besides that fact.\n\nI had really high expectations for this place considering how popular it is for brunch and I am so disappointed.  \n\nThe decorations for Valentine's day were over the top in a disturbing and ugly way; everything sparkled and looked like it was bought from the dollar store or like someone let their pre-schooler decide how to decorate the restaurant.  It wasn't romantic at all, but looked like we were at a school day care decorated for valentines day.\n\nService:  They were nice, but oh my god they were so unorganized and kept messing up EVERYONES orders.  Since there were four courses to the menu, people all around us kept getting the wrong course, as well as the wrong dish sent to them.  They didn't even give us our first course for HALF AN HOUR.  \n\nAlso, the seating was a disaster because they squished an extra table in so we literally has to move the entire table if anyone near us needed to use the restroom.  Also, they kept messing up the orders because they kept forgetting there was an extra table there and would confuse the two tables where there was usually one table. \n\nFood: The food was nothing special, everything was cut into hearts and was served room temperature.   I don't particularly like room temperature soup thank you very much.  But I was't going to send it back since I waited HALF AN HOUR for it to even arrive.  \n\nThe second course was pretty bland and unexceptional, and the third course was where things got better, but not good enough to make up for the first two courses.  \n\nThe fourth course, dessert, was ok, not amazing, did not wow me. \n\nFor $69 a person I want to be amazed, especially if you're going to include tip in my check total.  \n\nI left pretty pissed off and dumbfounded we had just dropped that much money to be squeezed into a tiny area, with bad service, and served cold unexceptional food.\n\nWOULD NOT recommend for any pre-fix special dinners.", "author": "Christina L."}

Surprisingly, it was so warm out that there was no need for the heat lamps to be on.   Love.  With the sun beaming down on us, it was hard not to revel in the moment.  So I did.\n\nAn easy A for atmosphere.  But despite Zazies's stellar reputation, I found our brunch to be underwhelming.  \n\nThe Eggs En Fonte were cooked well but lacked flavor.  They were not bad, but I expected better than not bad.\n\nThe Croque Madame w prosciutto added.  Where was the prosciutto exactly?  Eventually I did find it; a very small amount of it bunched together on one end of the sandwich.  Then there's the matter of the b\u00e9chamel sauce.  It was bland.  Croque Monsieur's & all their variations are available on many menus now.  This was just haphazard & unremarkable.  Miss.\n\nThe big disappointment for me?  The French Toast Tahiti.  This was the dish that I was most looking forward to.  Thought this would be just delicious, & it just was not.  I'm sorry, but ANY French Toast at Mama's or Dottie's puts this one to shame.  I especially found the filling to be remarkably unappealing; visually, texturally, & taste wise.  It actually looks like mush.  It has an unpleasant texture in your mouth & no flavor.  Really?  Not what I was anticipating or would want.  The hype over this dish I just do NOT understand.\n\nIf you're looking for an amazing stuffed French Toast, I'd actually recommend Mimi's Cafe over this.  No joke.  \n\nWe didn't order mimosas, which I've heard rock here; but I don't use alcoholic beverages as a bar of measure for a great meal.  Neither should anyone else.  \n\n3 stars to me is mediocre.  Not good, not bad.

The lemon curd dollop along with the pear slice was out of this world as the sweet tangy flavor of the lemon curd is from Meyer lemons I would bet, and the sweetness of pear is just killer.  Then there is the sweetness from the light dusting of confectioners sugar, and if this isn't enough, there is the syrupy sticky sweetness from the maple syrup.  There is also a slice of lemon strategically placed on the plate to remind the eyes that you are sensing a lemon flavor in the curd...\n\nI'm a sucker for Croque Madame's and this one seemed a little ordinary at first until you take that first bite.

The wait is 30+ minutes, but if you're the type of person who thinks superb food quality and taste is worth the time, then waiting at Zazie may be for you. But wait time for weekday brunch isn't as long.\n\nZazie is known for their gingerbread pancakes. I'm not really a pancake person because I find them too doughy, dry, and boring. And don't get me started with all the little holes that give me shivers and make my skin crawl!! But overlooking trypophobia, Zazie's gingerbread pancakes are so aromatic and delicious! They're slightly sweet from all the spices, but the pancake is too fluffy and thick to my liking. But the sweet lemon curd adds a nice touch.\n\nI've tried a few Benedicts as well, including the La Mer (fresh crab and avocado), St. Trop (smoked salmon), and Monaco (prosciutto and tomatoes). My favorites by far are the La Mer and the St. Trop. The La Mer has a generous portion of fresh crab meat, most of which is in large pieces, and three small slices of avocado. The St. Trop has fresh, thin-sliced smoked salmon that is melt in your mouth silky and delicious! I'm not a big fan of raw onions and capers, so I liked how those two ingredients' tastes were very mild. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the Monaco because I thought the tomato flavor was overwhelming and I could barely taste the prosciutto, which is surprising because it's cured meat! The Benedict's eggs are poached perfectly, coming out nice and runny. The lemon hollandiase sauce is very mild and not too heavy, but they don't give enough of it.\n\nI'd avoid using their bathroom. It's literally the size of an airplane bathroom, if not smaller. You can hit the sink trying to stand up (ladies, and men too for #2). Service is non-existent, so you need to flag down the waiters if you need a new water jug or anything. Overall, I love the variety of brunch items Zazie offers. It's quite expensive ($18 for two eggs in La Mer Benedict?!), but the excellent quality and taste will keep me coming back, despite the long wait times.", "author": "Priscilla W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-28", "description": "The SF brunch scene is too real at Zazie: the name alone conjures dazzling connotations.  Add patio seating, unique presentation on a floral plate, a menu with gingerbread and miracle pancakes, plus the proximity to the UCSF campus heavily populated by twentysomethings addicted to brunch and propagating the pandemic on Instagram--well I am exaggerating slightly--you get an extremely popular brunch place that ends up on everyone's bucket list.  (I admit to being guilty of all of the above.)\n\nTo avoid the long wait, I would suggest going on a weekday or early on a weekend (emphasis on early if you have a large group, since the place is quite small).  On weekends, Bambino's next door is a good alternative for a backup; you just have to be okay with the more traditional name that may remind you of Bambi, and the more traditional vibe.\n\nBefore you get inpatient with my review, let me get to the food P:  Like all fancy SF brunch places, the price range is $10-$20 for a decent entree, but I do like how there are different portion options.  The pancakes, waffles, and poached eggs come in 1, 2, or 3; I suggest 1 for breakfast, maybe 2 for brunch if you are really hungry.  After doing my extensive Yelp research and getting excited over the eggs en fonte (yes, the presentation on a cast iron skillet was a factor), I was a bit disappointed when I asked about this and they said they didn't have it that day.  \n\nI went for the French Toast Tahiti ($7 for one piece), stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts.  It tasted both like heaven and hyperglycemia at the same time: already-sweet-by-definition French toast, this sweet and nutty walnut paste, caramelized bananas that were sweeter than fried plantains, a drizzle of syrup.  And, if that's not bad enough, a sprinkle of powdered sugar to look extra pretty in photos.  And, to make things even worse, there is a little cup of syrup to be added PRN, but I felt like the dish was already sweet to saturation.   Sweetness complaints aside, I enjoyed my French toast--it had a good fluffy texture, was not too thick and egg-yolky, and was very tasty with the walnut sauce and bananas.  The only catch was that after trying the caramelized bananas here, I was unable to eat normal bananas for like a week afterwards because it tasted bland in comparison to the caramelized and syrupy version at Zazie's.\n\nThe ambiance is European with a bit of a quaint, small-town feel.  Somehow I'm not surprised at their quaisi-modernist-hipster elements like the water in tall aesthetic glass bottles and baked eggs served in a skillet.  The servers are friendly, similar to what you'd expect at a family-owned restaurant.  My only dissatisfaction was how upset the waitress got when I asked her to take a picture for us on my dSLR and she was confused about how to look through the viewfinnder.. if your hipster games goes strong to dSLR-level, make sure you set the screen to electronic viewfinder in order to avoid the awkwardness of my situation.", "author": "Edna C."}

Nothing parallels  the combination of luscious runny egg yolks, hollandaise sauce, and fresh crab meat over a toasted English muffin. Soooo grood!  \n\nCroque Monsieur: grilled Black Forest ham and melted gruyere sandwich. The gruyere cheese is so distinct, a heavy and decadent dish\n\nFrench toast: not as memorable as the previous two, but a good compliment for those who want something sweet.\n\nAll of those plus reg coffee and mocha, total bill was around $60.

My experience at Zazie was well worth the hour wait, heck, I would have waited 3 hours for the splendid service and bounty of brunch bliss that ensued here. Things started heating up on delightfully heated floral back patio as we began the meal with 2 sultry, spicy mimosa choices--mango chamoy (with chile tajin rim job) and a ginger mimosa complete with candied ginger garnish. Time indubitably stopped as I wrapped my lips around and sunk my teeth into their blt, and I shivered with bliss as the oven roasted tomatoes oozed and squirted all over my hands and mouth. Then came a twosome of pancakes, including the gingerbread pancake with Bosch roasted pears and lemon curd, and the aptly named \"miracle pancake\" with stone ground cornmeal, strawberries, and more lemon curd. I'm ready to take a bath in that lemon curd. Mmmmm. The best part of the meal--this place truly takes care of their employees. The price (which may seem a little steep to some) includes gratuity which goes towards providing all of their employees with health insurance.

Haters gonna hate, but this hater won't make you wait.\nFACT: Even if Johnny Cash himself came back from the dead to cook, serve, and partake in brunch, it'd still be a hard pass from me in my comfy bed with sheets stained of salsa splatters because I have a bad habit of eating nachos in bed... which is also better than brunch.\n\nNeedless to say, I won't be joining Team Brunch anytime soon, but Zazie's Crab Meat Benedict (known as La Mer on the menu) has even a brunch-hater like myself eating a bit of crow. \n\nIt's one of those things where if you only get up early to eat once all year, this is the place to go. \n\nThe wait can be long, so be sure you sign up on the clipboard outside the door ASAP and make absolutely positive you have your most legible writer do the John Hancock-ing because if they can't read that sh*t, they will just pass you over. I recommend writing down whomever's name is the most 'normal' in your group for ease of all. \n\nFor example: If your name is Dostoevsky and your friend's name is Brad, go with Brad and write in big, all caps letters for priority seating. If everyone in your group has a crazy name with silent vowels, and umlauts all over the place, maybe just come up with an agreed upon faux simple name and stand by that? \n\nThere is an area on the front patio that's first come/first serve, but you really have to be ready to duke it out in the most obnoxious way if want it. I really recommend waiting for inside (or the back beautiful back patio- which I can attest to) because even though the wait seemed like it would be all day, in reality it was probably less than 30-minutes for my group of 3. \n\nWe were lucky enough to get a spot on the ivy-laced, shaded back patio and the worst thing about being here (besides that I was up super early on a Saturday) is trying to number down the number of dishes you want -- because you're gonna want at least 10. \n\nThings to know:\n+ The special can run out pretty early.\n+ The La Mer is pricey and worth every red cent with it's large lumps of REAL, fresh crab meat. (GET THIS)\n+ You can customize the amount of food you get with a lot of dishes, depending on if you'd like 1, 2, 3, eggs, biscuits, etc. \n+ They do have beer and mimosas.\n+ Their coffee was wonderful, although they will make no effort to refill your cup. \n+ The service (besides the no coffee refill thing) is perky and pretty on point, while still being pretty leisurely a dining experience.\n+ Waiting for the single bathroom in the only service hallway sucks. \n+  Also, the bathroom is for skinny people only. You'll understand when you see it. I barely made it in/out.\n+ Brunch with no booze will run you between $18-28 a person, but even as a skeptic, I can assure you it's worth it.\n+ Don't come here with more than 4 people. It's a tight space and personally, I think it's just really show-offy if you come to brunch with more than 3-friends. Congratulations, you're popular and you don't mind waiting an hour and half for brunch.

Even after seating ourselves, we were greeted immediately and a host kindly cleaned up the table after us and then came back with the menu.  We started off with a bottle of champagne and did a \"make your own\" mimosa.  We went standard and got the orange juice.  The guy came out with a bucket of ice with our champagne inside and popped it open right in front of us... so fancy.  He then came out with a cute tiny carafe which contained our orange juice, totally worth the $30. \n\nI ordered the La Mer, which is what most people get.  I just had to because the dungeness crab totally caught my eye. It was an english muff with gooey poached eggs on top with avocados.  I mean, can it really get better than that?

The crab itself was extremely tasty already! With the lemon Hollandaise sauce it was a party on a muffin. One of the downfalls of the eggs benedict was the avocado, because there was barely any! I was also extremely disappointed in the serving size of the potatoes, too small to enjoy its deliciousness. \n\nThe French Toast Tahiti, WOWEEEEEEEE, I CAN EAT THE WALNUT FILLING BY THE SPOONFUL! It was extremely tasty and also very light on the sugar. From the french toast to the toasted banana, everything was on point! We ordered 2 slices of the toast and I only ate a quarter. It was extremely filling and the perfect size to get a taste of. I would definitely recommend this dish!\n\nThe Miracle Pancakes for that day (January 2, 2015) were the Cornmeal Pancakes with Lemon Curd and Strawberries.

I also love their Challah French toast with fresh seasonal fruit. The french toast was nice and fluffy. The orange cinnamon butter also had a nice flavor added to the french toast. \nI would say I would come here again. Brunch is my favorite meal!", "author": "Mabel T."}

I got the eggs Benedict and my wife got the French toast Tahiti. Both were solids and I have no complains. But not sure if it was worth paying $60 for 2 for brunch food. Coffee was just plain diner coffee.\n\nA couple of neat things: it's expensive because the employees get full benefits and it's a no tip policy. I really dig how the employees are treated well. \n\nAlso the 4 tables in the front are first come first serve, not bad!

We sat on the back patio on a bit of a chilly morning but the heat lamps kept us toasty. The menu had many great breakfast/brunch options. Egg-forward dishes were a trend for my group. Lots of creative and delicious variations of poached eggs were a hit. The table also raved about the coffee cake if you need a bit of sweet to go with the savory. I went with a traditional breakfast (eggs, potatoes, bacon, toast), and it was done perfectly! Especially make sure you get a side of the home fries which include big chunks of roasted garlic. PRO TIP: If you like to spice up your eggs like I do, ask for the house-made habanero-tomatillo salsa! We will definitely be coming back!", "author": "Ryan H."}

Gahhh so disappointed here... the food was quite good but the service definitely killed the good vibe =/\n\nI was really looking forward to brunch with one of my good friends, and when we arrived there weren't too many people so we didn't feel cramped. I ordered one poached egg (Pierre Noir) with bacon and tomatoes, and one gingerbread pancake. My friend ordered the French Toast Tahiti and one miracle pancake which happened to be poppy seed flavored. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant was cute but they put the tables very close together. Our waitress only came by to take our order and deliver our food; we had to flag her down for the check when it came time. The poached egg was whatever, it was super runny and the white didn't hold up very well for some reason. The bacon and tomatoes were good though. The gingerbread pancake was massive, and the lemon curd on top was pretty tasty; you don't really need the syrup because it's already sweet. I tried a bit of my friend's french toast which was yummy with the caramelized banana, and her poppyseed pancake was tasty too, I actually kind of liked it more than my gingerbread. \n\nAfter we finished our food our waitress brought our check, and it had a fee to pay for the workers benefits which was around $3. Okay, I wasn't aware of this at the beginning of the meal but I was willing to deal with it because hey, it's to help the staff out. BUT THEN I saw that they tacked on 20% TIP for TWO people. WTF. My friend and I wanted to split the bill between our two cards, so when the waitress came back I mentioned we wanted to split the balance, then add tip later. She said this wasn't possible and we had to pay the full 20% (I thought tip was voluntary so what the heck?!). She also failed to run my debit card so I had to use a different card which was annoying. \n\nI don't appreciate being told how much to tip, especially when it's only a party of two, the waitress didn't come by to ask us if we needed anything, and it's BREAKFAST for goodness sake.

That automatically lost two stars for Zazie. Otherwise it was an excellent restaurant. Two of us wanted the coq au vin and were left scrambling when we were told they were out of it. I ended up with a small salad with added chicken and nothing else as I don't eat beef or pork. My guy had the beef as did my friend while her hubby had the pork chop. They brought out fresh warm dinner rolls and I loved the stoneware dishes! The meals arrived and the three of them loved their food. For me, a salad was a salad and I could have gotten that anywhere. Disappointing but gets an AOK rating due to the others enjoying their meals. My boyfriend ordered a coffee and never got it but he got creamer. We asked where the coffee was and the waiter forgot. It happens! One great thing to mention was that there's no tipping here. Tips are included in the price which I thought was great! Not sure if I would return though.

Among our party of three, we shared the New York Scramble, the Monaco poached eggs and the Miracle Pancakes and all were delicious.  We also each ordered a latte or mocha and both came in a huge bowl and were really good.  One of my favorite things about this place is that they pay their employees a living wage + benefits and tip is rolled into the price of the food, which makes me feel great about patronizing this restaurant.  On top of that, the service is really good.\n\nTip: Outdoor seating in front of Zazie is first come first served.  The best way to bypass the wait is to snag a table in front.  Although Zazie has signs informing patrons of this policy, very few pay attention.  I managed to bypass the hour wait I otherwise would have had by noticing that a group sitting in front had just left.  None of the 30+ people waiting outside seem to notice and I was able to sit down with my party right away.  Zazie has heat lamps outside so no need to fear the cold.", "author": "Jessica C."}

When I finally tried it, I realized I was really missing out!  I've come here twice for dinner and once for brunch in the last month.  Although I would like to try more on their brunch menu, so far I prefer the dinner menu better! \n\nI had my birthday dinner here and the owner, Jen, was very helpful in helping me set it up.  For parties larger than 8, I believe you have to reserve a large group party and order on a shared or set menu, which has a minimum price per person.  I had a party of 11, and decided to do the group shared menu.  They also made a cute personalized menu for all my birthday guests which was a nice touch!\n\nWe had the following items for the shared group menu (which I got to choose):\n\nAppetizer: Strawberry Arugula Salad (Salade Guillaume)\nEntrees:  Grilled Niman Ranch Flat Iron Steak, Salmon (Poisson en Papillote), and Fresh Lemon Ricotta Raviolis\nSides: Mashed potatoes and Grilled Summer Squash\nDessert: Signature Baked Hot Chocolate - very rich!\n\nFor the shared group menu for 11, they gave us enough food to feed 15.  Lots of yummy leftovers!\n\nThe food was delicious, especially the mashed potatoes and steak which had a mushroom sauce that was out of this world.  My boyfriend also really enjoyed the hot bun.  \n\nThe restaurant is quite small and quaint, and the service is very good.  There's an outdoor patio area where you can sit, or I've also seen some larger parties rent the whole outdoor area out.

The Tahiti french toast was also bomb - great for those with a sweet tooth like me! The Mediterranean plate was a little lackluster and the plating looked sadly sparse. Overall, no one in our group was particularly full after the rather expensive meal, so we headed across the street for a second meal at La Boulange. \n\nI wouldn't return for brunch unless there was a less than 10 minute line (ha!), but I have heard good things (really from Check, Please!

Oh, I also decided to double down on the fat boy status by adding some bacon on the side. Mmm bacon!\n\nWhile the food wasn't bad, it just didn't quite live up to the hype.

The inside is kinda cramped and the line is a waste of time on the weekends, but the food was yummy and filling. A satisfying meal if you beat the crowd and come on a weekday instead. Brunch does get heavy though, around 1030 seems to be when the SF brunch rush comes craving their selection of mimosas and slightly overpriced meals. I will say that the french toast tahiti was way too many walnuts for me, even though the toast and bananas were great. If you're into that kind of stuff, well, go for it. Best item on their menu has got to be their baked hot chocolate though. Its on their dessert menu but you can ask for it in the morning too. A rich cup of dark chocolate ooze similar to the inside of a molten lava cake and a toasted marshmallow topping. So good.", "author": "Stephanie R."}

She raved about this place, and I was excited to give it a try. I checked out the menu online before coming, and saw that pride themselves in not accepting tips, due to them giving their staff a livable wage. I respect that! Alright, lets get talking about this cute place!\n\nAMBIANCE/CUSTOMER SERVICE: I met my friend there, since she knew about the super long wait. Giving the place 4 stars because we ended up waiting 1 and a half hours all together. It was a super hot day too, so it wasn't enjoyable waiting for our table in the hot sun with little to no shade available. However, we rejoiced as our name was called and we were led to the back patio. It's beautiful there! With greenery and cute tables, I seriously loved the ambiance. Once seated, we got menus and out waiter asked us for beverage choices. I got an orange juice, which was delicious. However, it was a very small size for what I paid for. Waiter was extremely  friendly, and very helpful when I asked questions about the menu. My friend decided on getting the Albert Poached Eggs, while I got the French Toast Tahiti (2 pcs). The wait wasn't too long, probably around 25 minutes. When the food came out, I was amazed. Our plates looked like something from a dream, it was beautiful! \n\nTASTE/FOOD QUALITY: My friend loved her poached eggs. I had a bite, and it was to die for. Eggs were perfect, and the home fries were delicious. My french toast was amazing. I still dream about it sometimes. It was so decadent and sweet. Loved the caramelized bananas on top, with the walnuts. Can't recommend it enough, if you have a sweet tooth, like me. The french toast had a nice crisp on the outside, but was soft as a pillow when I cut my fork to snag a piece. The portions were generous, and I was so full when I was done. The quality of the food was great, loved it.\n\nOverall, this is a spectacular brunch spot. The waiting situation is something to be expected, since it is a very popular spot (and for a good reason!). The food is great, and prices are more on the moderate side.

So one day I actually decided to go on a Friday afternoon. There was a wait, and we ended up sitting outside, so I didn't really get to feel the inside atmosphere. It was a nice day, so we didn't mind outside seating. The waiter was super nice, and he gave me free rolls of bread bc I ordered the ravioli on the special menu and asked if it came with anything else. He said no, but he would throw in the bread., which was really cool. \n\nThe ravioli was really good, but it was around $15. To me, it was too pricey for the food that didn't come with any sides or anything else. Usually for brunch, I like getting breakfast foods, you know, like pancakes, corned beef, eggs, etc. But for some reason, the menu didn't look too appealing and it was just way too overpriced for regular brunch items. I tried something different, but wasn't full. Luckily I had the bread.\n\nI don't think I would come back here because of the long wait anyway. There are other brunch places in the city that are better. Also, there is only one bathroom and it is the tiniest bathroom ever. No changing table or any counterspace for baby. The only reason why it's not a one star is bc of the nice waiter and the location. I love this area.", "author": "Jamie B."}

There was an option to select the number of eggs you wanted, and I decided on 3 eggs (for $24) and a side of home fries. The food was good, and I found the potatoes to be quite tasty, though the dish overall was just pretty standard. Nothing mind blowing, and pretty average. The presentation of the dish could have also used a bit more effort, and the colors on my plate looked rather dull and boring. I also ordered their mimosa with mango flavoring ($10), but didn't quite get any of the mango taste that I was expecting. \n\nService: The host that helped to tell us wait times could have been slightly friendlier, and he always seemed rushed whenever we spoke to him. Our server was friendly when we came to sit down, but I felt was rather absent throughout the duration of our meal. For example, our water jug was never replenished, and there was no offer to do so either. \n\nAtmosphere: The restaurant is small inside, but interestingly decorated. I feel like things were too cramped, especially with all of the guests and wait staff that were around. Restroom facilities were clean enough, but tiny.\n\nZazie had average tasting food overall, but will definitely not be somewhere I come rushing back to for a visit.

I love the houses and the crisp fresh air on a brisk sunny day.  This is what makes San Francisco such a wonderful place.  Every neighborhood has its own unique culture, and I just get so excited every time I discover a new place.\n\nThis neighborhood is just perfect for Zazie.  It has a very intimate country feel, yet the place is always bustling.\n\nLet's start with the drink menu.  They have some pretty unique choices.  The mango mimosa and the elderflower mimosa sounded very appealing.  I opted for the mango, and the flavors were very light and crisp - perfect way to start off a delicious meal.\n\nNext, the food.  Boy oh boy, what a hard decision!  Their pancakes looked amazing.  I was really tempted to get one of their scrambles too.  However, surprise surprise, I got the poached eggs.  I never get benedicts... I don't know why, but it just never appealed to me.  However, the La Mer (hand-picked crab benedict) had such great reviews.  Being a huge crab lover, of course I had to try it.  What a great decision!  It was absolutely scrumptious!  The light hollandaise just made it perfect.   \n\nOur waitress was such a sweetheart.  She was attentive, helpful, and patient!  We were just so absorbed with the place we totally forgot to look at the menu.\n\nThe restaurant is kind of small, and the wait can get pretty long and tedious.

As we seldom have brunch out, wife and I decided to try this Zazie for dinner, a very happy decision! We made reservations for an early dinner on a Saturday (Zazie does take reservations for dinner but not for brunch), and, fortunately, the restaurant was not crowded as we dislike noisy places.  The restaurant has a front section with cute little tables and wooden chairs, an open kitchen, and beyond that, a covered, semi-open section with additional tables.  We were served a freshly baked warm bread which was delightful. The menu was quite French and interesting, and they had a good choice of relatively inexpensive wines, aperitifs, and beers.  We started with kier royale, which was somewhat on the sweet side.  For appetizers, we had mussels marnieres, French onion soup, and a small salad, which were all authentic and wonderful.  I especially liked the mussels with a wonderful creamy sauce which I spooned up to the last drop.  For the main course, we both had the truite meuniere, which was cooked to perfection - the skin was crisp, and the fish melted in the mouth.  We had a bottle of French sancerre ($60) with the meal, which was quite decent.  For dessert, we had the \"baked hot chocolate\" - a rather creative, sweet dish, and worth a try.  The service was very friendly and prompt.  The bill came to about $200.  They pride themselves that the price of food includes the tip and that their employees have full benefits!

I thought it would've been a spicier, per the description on the menu, but I was pretty content.  I finished the entire dish.  We ordered the strawberry-rhubarb crumble, and that's where the meal fell apart.  The dish was lukewarm to cold and mushy.  I expect texture in this dessert.. It seemed like they baked them in masses and let them sit.\n\nOne of my roommates was going to order another dessert,  the Baked Chocolat, that had marshmallows. She maintains a kosher diet, so she asked about the ingredients in the marshmallows.  The menu describes them as \"golden marshmallows.\"  The waiter informed us that they're Kraft marshmallows.  The dessert was $8.  If I'm paying $8, I want my marshmallows house made.\n\nOur waiter was really nice, attentive, and made sure we were welcome.

They have two tables for outdoor seating so it's great to be able to bring your doggy with you for brunch, given it is also a dog friendly neighborhood.\n\nMy favorite dish? Hands down the eggs Benedict. They're eggs are poached to perfection with a good ratio of hollandaise sauce to enhance the flavors of the egg benedicts.

The last time I visited here for dinner was to celebrate my sister's birthday last year.  It went so well with my family that I decided to come by again to celebrate my birthday.  Though for my birthday, they had a special menu since it was on New Year's Eve.\n\nWe arrived there about 15 minutes early from my reservation and we got seated immediately.  The two things that really stood out for us on the menu were the Steak Au Poivre and the Dungeness Crab and Artichoke Ravioli.  Everyone at the table ordered the Steak Au Poivre while I ordered the Ravioli.  The funny part about that was that in the weeks leading up to that night, I kept telling myself that I wanted a good steak for my birthday.  Well, I had so much good beef from the Christmas parties a week earlier, that by the time it came to my dinner at Zazie, I wanted a change of pace by ordering the Ravioli, and yet everyone at my table ordered the Steak.\n\nFresh Dungeness Crab and Artichoke Ravioli w/ Grilled Prawns, caramelized leeks, wilted arugula, white wine, and shaved manchego\n(http://bit.ly/1lmutGu).\nThe Crab and Artichoke filling was really delicious, really light, and almost refreshing in a way considering, that earlier in the day I had my Birthday Food Crawl around the city.  Because of that, I was actually able to slow down and enjoy the Ravioli instead of attacking them at full force.  It was a great choice!\n\nSteak Au Poivre - Grilled Niman Ranch NY Strip w/ portabello brandy cream sauce, white truffle mashed potatoes, and grilled asparagus\n(http://bit.ly/1tpambH)\nLuckily for me, my mom and my sister couldn't finish their Steaks and each cut off a generous portion for me to taste.  So essentially I had Surf n' Turf for dinner!  Their Steaks were perfectly cooked and the brandy cream sauce just made it even better!\n\nLast Sip - White Peach Champagne Sorbet and Black Currant Syrup\nThis was a very refreshing and sweet Champagne cocktail and it complimented my meal very well, especially with the Ravioli.  \n\nOnce again, another very satisfying and successful visit to Zazie.  Even though they're more known for their brunch, I highly recommend you come and try them for dinner.  I'm glad I made the decision to celebrate my birthday here and I will be looking forward to visiting Zazie again in the near future.", "author": "Rodney H."}

I could have just ordered one pancake and still been able to share with the rest of the table. I did wish they were more generous with the toppings though.

The second time around had one of their specials, Eggs en Fonte, which was basically a saucy polenta and egg dish. There was a piece of polenta in a tomato, spinach, mushroom sauce topped with a sunnyside egg. I found the dish to be lacking in flavors and had to add hot sauce to give it a kick. \n\nDrinks: Had a coffee special the first time...supposed to be pumpkin spice latte-esque but the coffee taste bitter, almost burnt.

Like many brunch places in SF, the experience usually gets tainted by the ridiculously long lines especially if you're not mentally prepared for it. I've been to Zazie 3 times, and I've been disappointed only one of those 3 times (coincidentally when I had to wait a while). \n\nThe first time I came here, we didn't have to wait very long because we decided sitting outside would be better than standing outside for even longer waiting for an indoor table. We decided to share the crab Benedict and the French toast Tahiti and they were both amazing! Had to try hard not to eat more than my share because me and my bf had just started dating at the time. It was a great experience.\n\nMy second time here was not so great. I let my bf drag me here in my post-Bay to Breakers drunken/almost hungover state, which was a big mistake. Not only did I have to miserably wait in line for almost an hour self-consciously under the hot sun, I also made the mistake of ordering from their sandwich menu. Don't do it! Stick with the eggs bennies, French toast, and pancakes! I mean it wasn't horrible but the Croque Royale IMO was not satisfying and is not worth $14. \n\nThird time here, all was right again. I came with my coworker during work hours for her good-bye brunch when there was no wait and played it safe and ordered the eggs benedict with avocado and prawns, French toast Tahiti, and a mango mimosa. (I ate all that..?) Just as good as I remembered it the first time. \n\nTLDR: highly recommend their eggs Benedict, French toast, and pancakes, avoid the lunch menu unless you don't mind pricey small portions, service is good, and be prepared to wait on weekends!", "author": "Stephanie G."}

My grandmother ordered the Ahi Tuna Sandwich (with tomatoes provencales, aioli, greens and sun dried tomato pesto), and my grandfather ordered the French Toast Tahiti (challah toast stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts).  Both of them were extremely delicious and I couldn't keep my fork out of their plates! :)\n\nAltogether, I really enjoyed Zazie, as did my grandparents, whom are very picky and judgmental when it comes to good food.  I am excited to be back!\n\n\nP.S. Their house-made tea is absolutely delicious - you must try it.", "author": "Juliana K."}

I assumed an early Tuesday morning would have no wait. My sister and I arrived and snagged one of the last 2 tables inside the restaurant! Score! \nWe looked over the menu and I got the bacon, poached egg on an English muffin. The side were home fries, salad and something else I can't remember. I told the waitress \"I'll take the home fries please.\" She asked \"what kind of potatoes would you like?\" I had to stop and think for a sec is there another potato on the menu? Apparently she wasn't awake yet either cause home fries DUH! That was something to laugh over during breakfast... I also shared the pancake of the day w my sis which was poppyseed w Meyer lemon and strawberries. \nOverall breakfast was ok MINUS the burnt to a crisp piece of home fry I received that was totally inedible. \nWould I wait in the line for this place?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-14", "description": "Finally crossed this one off the foodie bucket list and my goodness was it worth it. \n\nI love absolutely everything about Zazie. The rustic-cozy outdoor patio? Yes. The homey and cute Parisian bistro-esque interior? Yes. The epic brunch entrees that keep you craving for more? Yes.\n\nI don't think it's possible to go wrong with anything over here (literally everything we had was amazing) but just in case, here is a list of my recommendations: \n\n1. Griddle Tasting Platter: This is such a good deal because you get to try gigantic pieces of the Challah Orange Glazed French Toast, the infamous Gingerbread Pancake and the classic Buttermilk Pancake. All three of them are unique, fluffy and thoroughly delicious - definitely a must order. \n\n2. Fontainbleau Egg Scramble: Oh sweet baby jesus, this will cause a yummy spasm in your tummy. The trio blend of portobellos, shitakes and porcinis take this scramble to new heights. And the truffles are perfectly complemented with some delicious spinach and fontina cheese. You simply HAVE to order this unless for some inexplicable reason, you have some unresolved beef with mushrooms. \n\n3. House Special Bacon and Avocado Omelet: This is the first time I've felt so healthy while gorging on bacon. The omelet tasted so organic and fresh that some disillusioned part of my brain was convinced that it's such a healthy entree. I mean, there are avocados, right??\n\n4. House Special Pomegranate Mimosa: Zazie's mimosa menu is quite extensive so I'd highly recommend giving it a once over. We ordered the pomegranate mimosas are were more than pleased! They were deliciously fresh and contained quite a surplus of actual pomegranate pieces. \n\nPerhaps the only potential irksome tenet of Zazie is the infamously disgruntling wait that's almost always north of an hour. Weekends are awful. However, if you head here during the weekdays, perhaps on a light workday or when you have the day off, it's not bad at all. That's the trick. \n\nHappy Brunchin', Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

The highlight of the meal was definitely the hollandaise, but I thought $20 was a bit pricey for the poached eggs.

We were fortunate enough to eat on the back patio (very nice, well-heated), where there is more room than in the awkward main room.  \n\nSeveral at the table raved about the vegetable soup.  My onion soup was good enough.  The burger was small and a little dry - not bad, but below par.  The selection of wine and beers was good, especially for a small, reasonably priced restaurant.\n\nService was not terrible, just annoying.  The waitress visited us rarely, but when she did she would run up and start talking loud and fast, no courtesy moment to let someone wrap up a sentence.  There was no enthusiasm, no warmth, just an exaggerated accent and an inexplicable rush - we were just about the only people there.\n\nIn many other cities Zazie would rate 4 stars.

She was in charge of picking a dinner spot to meet up with a mutual friend visiting SF. Well done, m'lady!\n\nZazie is an unassuming little spot in Cole Valley (which I had never been to before) that will \"wow\" even the harshest critic. The inside is nothing to write home about, but the outdoor patio is what's up. It's quite large and extremely quaint. And you can dine out here anytime since they're well-equipped with heat lamps. We were almost *too* hot if you can believe it. \n\nThe menu is comprised of traditional French fare, all of which sounded delicious. Sure, I was more than a little hungry and a few glasses of vino in before ordering. But I love French food regardless, so this was a special treat. I went with the trout and a side of mashed potatoes. They paired nicely (really, anything goes with potatoes IMHO) and I ate almost the entire thing. \n\nWhat really gives Zazie the full 5-star rating is the dessert. OMG, the dessert. Our table split some sort of chocolate creme brulee and lemon souffle. Still thinking about those tasty little concoctions. Could eat 'em anytime.\n\nAlso, our waitress was extremely nice, even when an extra guest who wasn't part of our reservation showed up and joined the table. She was extremely accommodating, had a wonderful sense of humor and didn't rush us out of there, even though we were the last table in the restaurant on a Sunday night. Props to her and the rest of the Zazie staff for being so nice. \n\nHave a GF coming to town this weekend and am thinking about taking her here for brunch since all the reviews for this place say brunch is also tasty.

Delish!  \n\nThey got my order wrong, but immediately fixed it with a short turnaround time and gave a discount on the wrong order. \n\nCons:  Be willing to wait.  I went with a half hour wait, and it worked out great to go to Pete's a few doors down to get some tea and chat.  Apparently only waiting 30 minutes for a seat is great.  It can be as long as an hour and a half! \n\nBecause of the volume of customers, there was a bit of a lag in service. \n\nIt was a bit pricier than other cafes. \n\nIt was frustrating to wait so long and have to wait a little longer to fix my order. \n\nEven though portions were decent, still left a bit hungry. \n\n\nAssessment:  Even though the food was great, not sure it's worth the wait and the more expensive food prices, or slower service due to the high volume of customers, though I'm thrilled to have the Zazie experience.

This was a special that day. Sitting on top of each toasted English muffin was a poached egg, fontina cheese, avocado slices, bacon and \"fabulous\" lemon hollandaise. Like all scrambles and benedicts, you can order 1, 2 or 3 eggs. I went with 3 and got a side of home fries... Told you sh*t was gonna get real. The hollandaise sauce was good, but I wouldn't call it fabulous. It was pretty standard which doesn't make it a bad thing. It just tasted like typical hollandaise. The benedict was good but not great. Honestly, It tasted exactly like I expected. It didn't blow my mind. However, I really enjoyed the homefries that came with roasted garlic cloves. It's weird, garlic isn't something you ever put in your breakfast, but Zazie made it work with the potatoes. Nice touch. \n\nMONACO ~ 2.5 stars: My gf got this. Poached egg, hollandaise, prosciutto, tomatoes provencales on top of an English muffin. She kept it cool and only got 1. I tried it and it wasn't great. In my opinion, you should never get benedict with prosciutto because it gets lost in the yolk, muffin and hollandaise. Why get something if you can't even taste it? \n\nBEET SALAD w/ GOAT CHEESE ~ 4 stars: Nice salad. The beets were cooked perfectly and the dressing wasn't too heavy. \n\nGINGERBREAD PANCAKES ~ 3 stars: Before you get loco on my ass, let me explain. I don't like pancakes. I don't like waffles. I don't like anything sweet for the first meal of my day. It just doesn't fly with me. However, if you like pancakes, this is something you have to try. After sampling a bite, I can see why so many people love this menu item. It will absolutely satisfy your sweet tooth and tummy. \n\nSABE SAKE VODKA BLOODY MARY~ 4 stars: An excellent Bloody Mary with great flavor. I wish it was a bit thicker but other than that, it was almost perfect. \n\nOne of our friends ordered a scramble and another got something else. I didn't try either one so I can't say anything about it. However, the scramble looked really good. \n\nI wasn't blown away by Zazie. The food was ok, not great. However, I think the ambiance is fantastic. \n\nWould I ever go back? Probably not... I might consider it if they put chicken fried steak on the menu though.", "author": "Bruce C."}

There was a wait as usual (and this was on a Tuesday around 11:30am), but we waited only 15-20 minutes or so. The tables outside are first come first serve, so that is a cool alternative to putting your name on their wait list. The ambiance was as cute as I remembered, and we got to sit in the little alcove by the window. Service was friendly, really no complaints there. The reason for the 3.5 stars is...the pancakes weren't as fantastic as I remembered them to be. I got the 2-stack of Miracle Pancakes (today's special was Poppyseed Pancakes with Lemon Curd), and the pancakes were good, but NOT great. I've HAD great pancakes, and these just weren't. Maybe I came on an off-day, or my pancakes just happened to be prepared subpar, but consistency is important..Zazie, I've always loved you!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-26", "description": "French Toast Tahiti and Eggs La Mer.\n\nHeavenly.\n\nEven at 10:30 AM on a Thursday, there was a line for indoor seating. And who wouldn't want to sit inside the cozy restaurant, with its high ceilings and warm tones? Those who won the first-come, first-serve scramble for the two outdoor tables. For those destined to wait, you'll want sign in on the sheet outside the door, ponder the menu choices (brunch is served for weekday breakfast as well), and drool at the dishes of those around you.\n\nSince we were a group of 4, we had to wait 30 minutes for a table to open up. As such, we were happily surprised by the complimentary bowl full of deliciously ripe mango, mandarin oranges, honeydews, cantaloupes, apples, pears, and strawberries. If the DMV followed a similar policy, the world would be a happier place.\n\nOur first choice was the FRENCH TOAST TAHITI, Pinkie's challah stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts, priced at $6/$11/$14/$17 (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EMUfwwzo4GfgZ6XJVJrL6A/l.jpg). Since we asked for 4 portions, we got 2 French toastwiches cut in halves. The thick, scrumptious challah slices enveloped a nutty mush with soft, sparse chunks of walnut and were topped with a sliver of scrumptious caramelized banana (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hvFqcU-twBiCW-zSSLV_OA/l.jpg). SO. GOOD.\n\nOur second choice was the EGGS LA MER, Eggs benedict (poached eggs on an English muffin with Hollandaise sauce) with fresh hand picked dungeness crab, green onions, and haas avocados, priced at $12/$19/$24/$30 (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RlaHegShuchDKigR_O91CA/l.jpg). The poached egg was perfect with its thick egg white and nice, runny egg yolk (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lUfNmyOt4QosA4wPvnqppQ/l.jpg). The crab was fresh, a great addition. The avocado seemed too sparse to be noticeable. And I usually hate English muffins, but it was toasted just right to soak up the benedict mess without becoming too soggy. Oh, and the side of potatoes comes with huge unpeeled roasted garlic pieces, of which you are not supposed to eat the peels. Well, you could try, but you'll spit them right back out, like I did.\n\nOur third choice, which I wish we had skipped, was the FLIGHT OF PANCAKES, which comes with one of each of their pancakes: miracle, gingerbread, and buttermilk, $14 (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j40Ikbetb3Q3x-WURnK2Ig/l.jpg). Not only were we full from the other dishes, but the pancakes were all dense and dry. The buttermilk pancake was decent, but I couldn't help but equate it to my Krusteaz mix at home. Now, add a dollop of the raspberry jam on your table, and you've got yourself a winner. That jam is like crack! The gingerbread pancake was notably thick and heavy with subtle ginger tones. The stewed pear outshines the pancake by far. And the miracle pancake tasted a LOT like cornbread and definitely needed the lemon curd for flavor. The first few bites were offsetting, but after I readjusted my perspective, I decided that this was the tastiest cornbread I had ever had. Also, their maple syrup was less viscous than expected and not overpoweringly sweet.\n\nService was spot on, and water refills were frequent. They add a surcharge of $1.25 per person to all checks to provide full benefits for the staff, which totaled to a little over $20 per person for a divine breakfast. If that extra bit of money is what it takes to guarantee accommodating and prompt wait staff, I'd suggest the policy at every restaurant.\n\nSkip the pancakes. Get the French Toast Tahiti and some type of Eggs Benedict. And have an amazing day thereafter.\n\n[[How to do SF brunch, Adele-style]]\nSeek EVERYTHING (notably SOUFFL\u00c9 PANCAKES and SMOKED SALMON TARTINE) at Griddle Fresh\nSeek FRENCH TOAST at Park Chow (more affordable) or Zazie's (more unique)\nSeek PANCAKES at Park Chow\nSeek EGGS BENEDICT at Zazie's\nSeek HASH BROWN SANDWICHES at Art's Cafe\nSeek FRITTATAS at Home Plate\nSeek HUEVOS RANCHEROS at Cafe Reverie", "author": "Adele F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-13", "description": "My friend mentioned this restaurant to me when we were both looking for a place to have breakfast. He told me it was very popular and that it was usually super busy during weekends, but since we were going on a Monday, I didn't think we would have a problem with lines or anything like that.\n\nBoy, was I wrong. The line wasn't very big when we got there around 10:30 AM, but it was rapidly increasing as the time passed (it really made me wonder how come all those people weren't busy, oh idk, working or something). The way the line works is that you put your name in a sheet of paper attached to the window, and how many people are in your party. Then, the serves comes out, sees the list, calls your name, and sits you either inside or in the patio. The outside area is in a first come first serve basis, and you do not need to write your name down.\n\nWe got seated within 15/20 minutes, and went to eat in the patio area. The area is very cute, but the only thing that bugged me a little was how close the tables were located. I understand they need to do that in order to seat more people, but it was a little annoying to be almost rubbing elbows with our neighbors. \n\nThey really focus on a \"no tip\" policy, which makes their price a little more expensive than other brunch places, but when you think about, that is also very good. I didn't have any of their poached eggs (which seems to be a favorite) because I'm a really picky eater, but had a Italie Scrambled eggs that was pretty good. I mean, you can't go wrong with scrambled eggs, so it was pretty much a given that it would be good. The salad that came on the side was also really good, as was my friend's fries. \n\nOverall, I think the place is a little overrated. Would I come back here? Yeah, sure. Would it be my first choice? Probably not. Would I come back during weekends? Based on the reviews and my own experience during the weekday, probably not.", "author": "Carolina P."}

We wanted to see what all of the hype was about as we saw a huge amount of people waiting for brunch on Saturday after we had brunch somewhere else. I came in with an open mind. Yes, the prices seem very expensive, but I guess the tip is included. My boyfriend ordered a burger, I ordered the Mexico scrambled eggs with soyrizo ($3 upcharge?!?) and we split 2 miracle pancakes, which we cornmeal and lemon curd. My scrambled eggs were pretty good, but for $19 I expected them to be AMAZING. I definitely wasn't blown away. The pancakes were the best part, but only if you had some lemon curd on them. If you took a bite out of the pancake without it, it seemed pretty plain. Overall, it was pretty good, but definitely not worth the wait.

I do prefer dinner here, though, since it's much easier to get a table, and the food choices are more unique at this time than their relatively standard brunch fare. The service is amazing: waiters are always friendly, very knowledgeable, and attentive. They also know their wines, so don't be afraid to ask for advice!\n\nI love sitting outside on their backyard patio, which also has heat lamps on whenever it's chilly. Definitely recommend opting for this since it's less crowded than their inside seating.\n\nI've had several of their appetizers and entrees, all of which have been delicious and reasonably priced. My favorite thus far has been the Grilled Niman Ranch Flat Iron Steak -- really flavorful and perfectly cooked (I recommend rare). Our waiter that night suggested I get the portobello cream sauce on the side, which was excellent advice, as the sauce itself has a strong flavor and it was nice to titrate the amount of sauce with the meat that's already very flavorful on its own.\n\nAs for dessert... oh man. Save room. Get the Baked Chocolat Chaud. GET IT. Imagine a big mug full of rich hot chocolate, covered in a thick layer of marshmallows, then baked for a while. The end result: the hot chocolate part turns into a mousse-like substance, which is covered in perfectly toasted marshmallows -- basically a s'more without the gross graham crackers getting all up in your business. \n\nCan't wait to go back for more (which will likely be on a Tuesday since it's no-corkage-fee night)!", "author": "Justine M."}

All of the staff were friendly, helpful, and patient, despite running a very busy establishment. I ordered a french toast with a side of chicken sausages. The french toast was delightfully fluffy and really needed nothing besides a bit of syrup. I still decided to overindulge and use the butter AND plop on loads of their berry preserve. The chicken sausage appeared burnt, but I suppose it's necessary to make sure the meat's cooked all the way through.\n\nI also got a cole mimosa, which tasted like a regular mimosa, but with a touch of grapefruit. It was delicious and refreshing. My friend got their smoothie mimosa, which comes with a scoop of sorbet at the bottom. It's really fizzy and apparently quite creamy when you get to the end :)\n\nI would definitely come back.", "author": "Chia-Fen Y."}

The other restaurants reviewed from that show are Pagolac in the Tenderloin and Della Santini's Trattoria in Sonoma. ***\n_____________________________________\n\nZazie is the type of little French bistro that you could easily pass by if you're on a Parisian boulevard filled with similarly inviting eateries. You could even pass by it in the less bustling neighborhood of Cole Valley. Three times. I guess I'm just not that observant without a GPS. I decided to make the evening a group outing in order to try more of their menu. Other friends have come here for breakfast, but nobody I knew has tried dinner there, including me. What a loss for them. At first, I was a bit concerned the noise level would be unbearable given the tight quarters. In my head, I was imagining five bells ringing in the Chronicle listing. \n\nFortunately, the four of us were seated next to the front window, which afforded us a semi-private enclave and even a vitriolic opportunity to comment on the clothing of the diners coming in and out of the restaurant. We started ambitiously by sharing five -- count 'em, five -- starters. First up were the Mussels Marinieres, which they steam very nicely in white wine, garlic, shallots, and parsley, as it all bathes in a creamy broth (see photo). The salads were quite fresh tasting. The Salade d'Ete was the more original concoction with a mix of sliced strawberries, goat cheese, toasted almonds, and even flower petals on a bed of arugula (see photo). It was a dish that seemed to announce the arrival of spring. \n\nDespite its daring French New Wave filmmaking namesake, the Salade Louis Malle was more conventional: spinach, caramelized walnuts, and Gorgonzola in a balsamic vinaigrette (see photo). We all more equally shared the Assiette de Fromages, a nice selection of three soft French cheeses with figs and toasted walnuts. That left me being the most selfish by ordering the intentionally hard-to-share French Onion Soup Gratin\u00e9e with beef stock, a truly fine interpretation of a French classic that offers the irresistible lure of melted cheese (see photo). \n\nI was also able to try four of their entrees, all quite impressive in execution. With keen competition, the best had to be the Roasted Trout, which had a nice texture and an added burst of flavor from the cherry tomatoes in a basil vinaigrette and warm goat cheese (see photo). A close runner-up was the fresh Lemon Ricotta Ravioli, buttery smooth with wilted arugula, leeks, grilled prawns, garlic and aged parmesan cheese (see photo). A more traditional dish was the Lapin \u00e0 la Moutarde, which was the dark meat of the rabbit braised and covered in a Dijon mustard sauce with mushrooms (see photo). Underneath was a bed of fettuccine. It was more of a stew dish than I had envisioned, as the sauce got a bit sloshy, and the little rabbit bones tough to maneuver around. \n\nStill, it was quite tasty. The last entree was a signature dish, the Zazie Burger with cheddar, tomatoes Proven\u00e7al, and grilled Yukon gold potatoes (see photo). It was a good, juicy burger, if you are in the mood for one. We barely had any room for dessert, but for the sake of the show, I felt it was important to try at least one. We all took our spoons and dug into the Crumble Zazie, a generously sized fresh fruit cobbler that either came in a dish \u00e0 la mode or in a bowl drizzled with cr\u00e8me anglais (see photo). Lo and behold, we had both variations in front of us, and they were the perfectly French ender to our meal. \n\nFor what appears on the surface to be a neighborhood eatery, Zazie certainly offers a robust and eclectic menu, and there is even a prix fixe menu on select items in the menu (thus the appearance of the Zazie Burger on our table). For the most part, the waitstaff was quite nice and accommodating. The one hiccup was the selection of our wine. I went for a $32 bottle of the Chateau Horeau Cabernet Franc, definitely one of their more budget-conscious selections, and I swear I got a case of small-mouth from the waitress. \n\nThe place was bustling for most of the evening, but as it was a weeknight, the low hum of dining activity started to die down after 9 PM. I would definitely come back to Zazie in a heartbeat. It's right off the N-Judah line on Cole, so it's a really convenient location for me. And after all, this review is all about me. By the way, several months after my visit, I was able to meet owner Jennifer Piallat and her general manager Mario quite by accident through a friend at Barbacco. They are wonderful people who feel rightfully proud about their business. \n\nFOOD - 5 stars...first-class French bistro but comfortable, not snooty by a long shot \nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...intimate with a nice patio \nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...great, friendly waitstaff beyond reproach \nTOTAL - 5 stars...Jennifer, you should be very proud of your place", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-11-15", "description": "Not exactly sure why there was a long line, but Zazie definitely wasnt worth the one hour plus wait. \n\nThe good thing was that it was around other cafe shops that you can hang out at while waiting, but that is also a con, because most likely, you are hungry and tempted to order more than just a latte, and will not be as hungry for the real breakfast/brunch.\n\nOrdered: Gingerbread pancake, Tahiti french toast, mango mimosa, and Poached Eggs La Mer. \n\nThe Gingerbread pancakes were light in flavor and didnt have too much of that gingerbread flavor I was expecting. I feel like even a normal gingerbread or ginger snap has more ginger flavor than this pancake did. The good thing though was that, it was not too sweet, so when paired with the maple sauce, the sweetness level is just right. I personally didnt feel as if the pear went too well with the dish though. I wasn't exactly sure why it was there.\n\nThe Tahiti french toaste was the opposite of the gingerbread pancakes because it was way too sweet, or at least a lot more than the sweetness I was expecting. It was more like a dessert than it was breakfast, and I didn't like that heavy factor about it. I would need to order a tall glass of milk or black coffee in order to gobble down this entire plate.\n\nThe Mango mimosa was a great alternative to your normal orange juice. I do wish that the mango juice was fresh though instead of tasting as if it was poured out of a minute maid carton.\n\nAt last, the La Mer was delicious and probably the most delicious menu item out of the three ordered. Not too heavy, the avocado paired well with the eggs and the crab and made a yummy eggs benedict. The portion was just right, with two english muffins and the option of salad of home frys on the side. \n\nOverall, I would say the breakfast at Zazie was decent, but was it spectacular? No. Memorable? Probably not either. If there wasn't a wait, I may consider coming back, but most likely, this won't be happening.", "author": "Luby H."}

This rating is based solely off of their shady credit charge practice I experienced and their completely bad customer service (or lack thereof) given by management. If I could give negative stars, I'd give as many as possible.\n\nWent here for brunch with a friend the Sunday morning of Bay to Breakers. We paid our bill using my friend's Amex card and left cash tip. Couple days later, she checks her account and sees that she was charged an additional $8.07 by Zazie. This was a cleared charge, it was NOT pending. I call Zazie and speak with a female \"manager\" who answered the phone. I tell her my concern of being charged an additional amount than what was signed for. This woman, who I failed to get the name of, tells me \"Oh, sometimes credit card companies place a hold on 20% of the amount in case there's no tip left.\" I've never in my life heard that before, but okay, whatever. Woman proceeds to get the last 4 digits of the card used and our time and date of the transaction. She says she'll look it up and call me back in half an hour. I call my friend and tell her what I was told by Zazie and tell her to call Amex. Amex tells her that they never place a hold or charge anything additional to what was signed for. Of course, I already knew that.\n\nI wait an hour before calling back and speak to the same woman I spoke to earlier. This woman has the nerve to give me hella attitude and say to me, \"I'm busy right now. Are you really concerned about $8? I'll check later for your $8.\" I was livid. \n\nMy friend ended up getting refunded the extra amount she was charged, but it's not about the $8 itself. It's about the practice of the employees there, and of this manager, to not see anything wrong with adding their own tip on top of what was already left in cash. And as a manager, a complaint of this sort should be taken seriously and a customer should be given a little more respect.\n\nSo, if you pay by card, make sure to check your charge amount days later to make sure you were charged only the amount you signed for.", "author": "irene f."}

This place is also fantastic for dinner too, so here's a combo of reviews for both, that are well overdue and deserved.\n\n- Mexico Omelet: The chorizo was tasty,and seasoned well, served up with the most delish home fries. I know it's just home fries, but for real, these are the most delish home fries\n- Pancakes; Fluffy, light and memorable.\n- Mussels: My fav, well seasoned and a nice earthy broth to it. \n- Burger: Meaty and flavorful.  Yes. It's a burger, but it is just a tad bit fancy, so you feel like it's all good in the hood when you eat it. \n\nAll in all. This place is great.

I thought that this place was just alright. I've eaten a lot of breakfast at many different popular breakfast spots--I don't think Zazie ranks among the best. We had the Poached Eggs Albert, Poached Eggs Florentine, and the pancake sampler thing. I was thinking about getting the crab poached eggs (La Mer), but I ended up going with the bacon one (Albert). I didn't really taste the freshness I expect from Eggs Benedict and I don't think they were put together well. In other words, I couldn't cut them neatly--they would fall apart as the knife sliced through. Maybe it's because I came first thing in the morning and they were using old ingredients? Who knows. I thought if other popular breakfast spots in SF like Mama's were better. I think I'd rather go to Mama's.\n\nMaybe if there was no hype to this place, I'd give it 3-4 stars. But since I'm going off some high expectations, to me this place should get 2 stars for not meeting that high bar. Bottom line, I wouldn't wait more than 10 minutes for a table here.

I love the salty bacon with the salsa and white cheddar. La mer would probably be my favorite, if it wasn't for the fact that the crabs freshness is a bit inconsistent. I've had it at times and loved it and also had it when it's been a bit fishy. If they ever have a special during fall or winter, get it. Pumpkin pancakes are to die for.

The customer service was excellent and the best I've seen in a long time.  The entire staff was so nice and friendly - from the host, to the bus boys, to the waitress - everybody was really pleasant to deal with.  Even the other diners were nice and friendly.  Since we had our two little dogs with us, we got a table in the back patio.  Monday nights are doggie nights, so practically every table in the back had a doggie diner.  It was a warm night, so I think the heat lamps could be on a low setting.  After a while, it was mighty toasty and we heard other people comment how warm their faces were.\n\nThe food was good.  We had a charcuterie plate, lamb tagine, Alaskan Coho salmon, and cheesecake.  I would say the atmosphere and experience is what would bring me back.  Would definitely want to try breakfast or brunch here.\n\nOne disappointing thing:  I had specified in my reservation that this dinner was for my friend's birthday.  Whenever I have mentioned a special occasion in the past, the restaurant has brought out something special - candle on your dessert or something nice.  I know they do this here because they celebrated an anniversary on our right and another birthday to our left.

The chicken was literally fall off the bone tender. \n\nGrilled Niman ranch hanger steak - a must have for steak lovers. Appropriately crispy coat with a warm nearly rare center. The cream sauce was a delightful compliment without taking away from the meaty steak flavor.\n\nRhubarb crumble with gelato - a fun, tart, sweet, somewhat light dessert that's almost whimsical.\n\nBaked chocolat chaud - imagine s'mores meets French onion soup. It's the insides of a s'more baked in a ceramic dish with a marshmallow protective layer on top. It doesn't stand a chance once you're armed with a spoon.", "author": "Phong D."}

I ordered the french toast Tahiti (Challah toast w/ caramelized bananas and walnuts) for the kids and I got the Monaco (poached egg with with prosciutto and tomato). I thought the french toast was well executed. I personally would not order three slice on my own because it's sweet and it really doesn't need the maple syrup. Not sure why they just don't call the poached egg dishes eggs benedict. Anyways, I enjoyed my dish especially the potatoes. It may be a deal breaker for most but there's a lot of roasted garlics with the potatoes. I like breaking through the garlic peel and pop them in my mouth. They are soft enough that I would smear it on my potatoes and eggs benedict. Overall, this is definitely a top-notch brunch spot in the City.", "author": "Kien M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-07-16", "description": "I recently moved nearby this place and have been here about five times or so. I used to love it and would definitely have thought of myself as a potential regular for the amazing ambience and food. Hands down, amazing. \n\nBut I was very put off by an experience I had today with the staff. My friend and I ordered two different meals -- one (his) was a chicken dish and mine was the pasta (I'm terrible with names). Because I'm vegetarian, I never order meat. You know, because of the whole not-eating-meat thing. After we wait for about thirty minutes, the waitress comes out with two dishes -- both the same chicken dish.\n\nThat's fine, mistakes happen. The waitress apologizes and offers a glass of wine on the house. I don't drink, so I suggested to her that perhaps I could just choose an appetizer instead. Wasn't forceful at all and was sure to use a kind tone with her because I know being in the service industry can be pretty thankless. I'm not one to make a scene over small mistakes and just thought that, because I was being offered something I couldn't consume, I'd offer an alternative. She obliges and lets me pick an item off the menu. I select the cheese dish. Everything is great, well on our way to a five-star review.\n\nThe food comes out, the cheese dish comes out about twenty minutes later. As my friend and I begin enjoying the cheese, a manager pulls out a seat next to us and sits down. He asks about our experience and says he heard we had a bad experience from the staff. I tell him what happened and said everything was fine, thanked him for the cheese dish.\n\nHe gives me a long, intense (okay, pretty angry) stare. After pausing for a few seconds, he tells me that we have a problem. He acknowledges that, while the restaurant can compensate for a mistake through a drink on the house, they cannot do so with an appetizer -- specifically, he notes, the cheese dish. He suggests we are at an impasse. We were blindsided. \n\nThe manager then tells us that we could expense a dessert if we'd like. Ummm... what? We should pay for our own make-good but take a free dessert? My friend and I awkwardly look at each other and tell him we're not really hungry for dessert. He stumbles and says \"Well we can't make-good with the cheese plate. The best we can do is... maybe cover the pasta dish you ordered... or, cover part of the dish.\"\n\nOkay! Music to my ears! You don't want to cover the appetizer, but you're happy covering the more expensive menu item we ordered? Fine by me! Not sure how the math makes sense there or why I'd opt for having part of my meal covered when he just told me they would pay for all of it, but I quickly jump on his offer. Of course, judging from his response and the way he backtracked by offering to pay part of it, I could tell he was very upset with my choice. But then... why offer me that choice?\n\nHe sits back and gives me another threatening stare before slowly getting up. Which, I would COMPLETELY understand had I been demanding, caused a scene, showed to have been remotely upset or threatening to write a terrible review. I did no such thing -- I merely offered an alternative to the waitress' offer on a make-good through a menu item I cannot consume. Had she told me she couldn't honor it or just offered me a dessert to begin with, I would have been ecstatic. I was ecstatic to get a cheese plate. I love cheese. Whatever. \n\nThe waitress certainly took her time getting her bill for us and the manager would routinely walk by our table and shoot us dirty looks. They ended up covering the cost of the pasta dish, but gave us a random \"convenience fee\" of $2.50 for our meal. Talk about passive aggressive. \n\nWe definitely felt uncomfortable, and were made to feel uncomfortable because of how the staff handled a mistake that they made. I realize that it's hard to maintain a business, especially a restaurant in SF. But treating your customers well, or at least not overpromising and underdelivering and then making your customers uncomfortable because of how they went along with what you told them is probably not the best way to maintain customer loyalty. Or get people to recommend you. Or run a business. \n\nWould give them five stars were it not for this experience -- keeping it at two because I think quality and character are best shown not when everything is going smoothly but when things don't go well. These guys definitely don't know how to handle service when they mess up. Would've given them the lowest possible rating though had this been my first experience at Zazie. So, settling at two. \n\nWe ended up leaving a 25% tip because I left feeling guilty (or intimidated... not sure yet) for accepting any generosity at all from them.", "author": "Youssif A."}

There's really no point in singing praise for a breakfast place that is already highly loved, but let me just point out why Zazie stands out among (what I think are many over-hyped) breakfast places in SF.\n\nTHE GREAT:\n\n--- Zazie has amazing special / seasonal pancakes & french toast\n--- The above pancakes & french toast can be ordered with ONE slice only! **\n--- Same thing with their egg dishes, you can get 1, 2, or 3 eggs!\n--- Their special menu, my favorite is the Eggs En Fonte \n--- Very lovely decor inside. Outside patio in the back is nice too.\n--- Their lattes! Goes really well with the pancakes & french toast & everything else.\n\n\nTHE OK:\n\n--- Their regular drip coffee.

Fine, bring a book or chatting friends then.\n\n\n** This is super important to me. I never order pancakes or french toast for breakfast because it is UNHEALTHY to just eat sugar & carbs for breakfast. And I never want that much pancakes anyway.

There isn't a wait if you are in by 8:30 am but we left shortly before 10am and there was a list and a group of people waiting outside the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small but walking through the kitchen area is a patio area with several table and stand heaters to beat the foggy cold. \n\nI am not a fan of walking through an area where employees are working. I feel as though it disrupts work and takes away from the overall experience. This isn't Benihana folks. \n\nFor the food, I ordered a side of scrambled eggs. The eggs are organic and without hormones. Check. I also ordered a bagel with cream cheese, tomatoes and basil. As I assumed the tomatoes and basil were incorporated the cream cheese I was surprised to note that my toasted plain bagel came out with a rationing of cream cheese, huge slices of tomatoes with sprinkled basil. The bagel also came with an ordinary side salad of mix romaine and dressing. The bagel was not my idea of appetizing but that is my fault for the assumption. \n \nMy husband and I decided to get the famous French toast Tahiti. That was a very satisfying brunch item that seems very popular with the brunch crowd. A winner definitely. \n\nMy latte was blah, the customer service was good, the crowd is a mix of family, young professionals and hipsters and the pricing was a little steep for my taste. \n\nI would give this restaurant a 3.5 overall but I'll be nice and round up to 4 stars", "author": "Ramla J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-02", "description": "OVERALL PROS:\n- Adorable brunch spot in Cole Valley, high ceilings with giant skylight, tables out front and in the backyard on a deck. There's this spiral black staircase that goes to a small second level landing at the front. I want to buy out this restaurant and just live in this space.. but then I would never taste their delicious food again.\n- The estimated 1 hour wait became only 20 minutes for the 2 of us (during brunch rush hour - 11am on a Sunday!).\n- Friendly, prompt service. As I was waiting by the kitchen for the restroom, I talked to the chefs as I kept seeing dishes that looked awesome and they were really nice and told me what everything was and what was in it.\n- Love love love that you can order just one slice of French toast/ pancake/ egg. It's slightly more pricey but you get to try so much more off the menu without filling yourself to the brim.\n\nOVERALL CONS:\n- A little on the pricey side, especially if you order a single toast/ pancake/ egg etc. (we did that and it was $21 before tax & tip). But... kinda worth it.\n\nWe ordered.. \n\n* Monaco Poached Egg (w/ prosciutto & tomatoes provencales) - WOW I had no idea I could love eggs benedict so much! I'm totally a sweet (vs. savory) brunch person, but surprisingly in this meal I liked this dish the most. Crispy, almost burnt English muffin + salty chewy prosciutto + tart squishy tomato = all of your sense are flipping out. \n\n* French Toast Tahiti (w/ caramelized bananas) - Incredibly soft, chewy, moist. Really great. However (Miss French Toast here - this is so my thing at brunch) it was really lacking that slight crunch on the outside of the bread. And the caramelized bananas had a kind of odd bitter aftertaste - I found myself putting it on the side so it wouldn't ruin the flavor on each bite of French toast.\n\n* Gingerbread Pancakes (w/ lemon curd & roasted pears)- Oh my god the flavor was wonderful! Very strong but it went perfectly with the combination of sweet maple syrup + tart lemon curd + pear. It was super thick and almost cake-like, fluffy yet dense. However (me being picky again) I found it just a tad too dry - I couldn't handle a single bite without dipping the pancake in syrup or the lemon curd to make it moist. I wish I could enjoy the great ginger flavor of the pancake alone.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

The granola was good (had raisins).\n\nWe sat on the back patio - it was a very enjoyable environment.\n\nWe would eat here again, but the prices are a little high - so probably not until someone came in town or a friend wants to eat here.

We spent forever browsing the menu, because there was just so much that looked delicious. In the end, we got the \"Miracle\" Pancakes and \"Albert\" Poached Eggs. They were both very delicious, not foodgasm worthy, but certainly a delicious brunch well worth the price. As for the atmosphere of the restaurant, it follows the French theme of the restaurant, and it's really a nice atmosphere to be around.\n\nI was pretty neutral to the service: it was friendly, but I wouldn't make a comment on it, positive or negative. It was pretty standard.\n\nAs for cons, the main con I felt was that the restaurant felt a little bit cramped. Also, service did not check up very much.\n\nOnly thing keeping this from a five star is that the service was very standard, and the food, while delicious, was not foodgasmic.", "author": "Benjamin H."}

We stuck to waters since they didn't have bottomless mimosas. Our seats were on the back patio, which was nice but very crowded. I think that maybe they should look into an addition of some sort so that people are not so tightly crammed on the patio on busy days. \nI ordered the shrimp eggs Benedict. It was fairly small, quality was good. Don't think it was worth the 13 I paid. \nMy girlfriend got the salad and crab eggs Benedict. She thought it was good but not overly impressed.

At first I wasn't exactly sure about this place, but I'm glad my friend knew what he was doing. It was cold (and a bit rainy) when we came, but luckily... because of that, no one wanted to sit outside! Outside is first come first serve... and if we had waited for a table inside, we probably would've never gotten in. The staff is incredibly friendly here... and they always seem like they would be super crowded (it was around 2 or 3 pm and there was still a line out the door).\n\nWe got their hot chocolate, which I highly recommended! It comes in a huge bowl cup... and you can get whipped cream on top... and is absolutely perfect on a miserable day. The restaurant is super cosy (two outside tables only) and not that many inside either. Luckily for us, there was an awning outside so we didn't have to sit in the drizzle. They have a great brunch menu... that looks incredibly tasty... I really want to go back and try everything on the menu because it looks so good!\n\nTheir poached eggs... holy crap... you can get one, two, or three eggs (depending on how hungry you are) which is great if you just want to get a taste and try other things. I had the Monaco... which was... AMAZING. It seems really simple, but it's really quite good. They come on English muffins with salad on the side... all the other poached egg options looked really promising too. There's just something about the crunchy English muffin soaking up the perfectly poached egg runny yolk... OMG to die for. Salivating just thinking about it now.\n\nPricing wasn't horribly expensive for the place; I didn't see the bill, but the egg dishes (2 eggs ~$13 average) seemed pretty reasonable for a specialty breakfast place. We had a really late lunch, and this was definitely the place to hit the spot. A bit difficult to get to (parking seemed like it would be incredibly difficult, but we walked there) but you should definitely give this place a shot!", "author": "Denise C."}

Looked for a nice brunch place and this seemed to be one of the highly ranked restaurants. \n\nZazie is a cozy restaurant tucked away in San Francisco. The wait can be quite long, particularly for bigger parties. I believe they take reservations on the phone and write your name on the waiting list that they hang outside. You also write your name and party size on this list as well. The man who calls out the names is quite friendly and gives you an estimated time. We waited about 45 minutes to get seated for a table of 5. \n\nI must say though, the wait was worth it. We ordered various benedicts. For me, I specifically ordered the St. Trop Poached Eggs (with wild smoked salmon, capers, and red onions). The eggs were poached perfectly and the lox was made very nicely. The potatoes were not my favorite - just normal seasoned potatoes. However, made along with the potatoes were these cloves of garlic. Oh man, the garlic was delicious. Slightly buttery with the right amount of seasoning. The garlic was soft and could get sucked out of the skin easily. Meshed very well with the poached eggs! \n\nOverall, the food was very good.

The hollandaise sauce was nothing special but it definitely was tasty. The eggs were cooked to perfection, so much runny yolk. We also got a 2-piece French Toast which was cooked just how I like it, slightly moist in the middle, nice firm edges, with a lot of syrup on the side for you to apply how you wish. I think I might have added a little to much syrup in the end because I was feeling a little sick after eating it all.\n\nService was great, even in the packed conditions of their restaurant.

Did I just so happen to live in the greatest foodventurous city in all of America? I'm sure it was also just a coincidence that I'd happen to play hooky with my girlfriend and wind up at Zazie's for breakfast.\n\nZazie, past the reefer influence streets of the Haight and located nearby the UCSF Medical neighborhood of Cole Valley, is a gem of a luncheonette (they also serve dinner too). The hallway sized restaurant itself is quite small but cozy, with homey decor, paintings, an awesome spiral staircase coat hanger, and available heated patio seating out in the back of the garden. First glance upon their menu and you can already tell that Zazie is something special. \n\nThe Albert - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gqVl3RprESEqkIPeJH0yOg?select=7oS00AnQdPkMIJEHlW-YAA#ozr2HmIPInKnnxl-NBVMyw\nUpon my first go at Zazie's, it must've been predetermined that I would order the Pouched Egg special, Albert. Your choice of 1, 2, or 3 free range eggs, it's served with bacon, white cheddar, and house salsa fresca, each on a toasty English muffin and Zazie's \"fabulous\" lemon hollandaise sauce. Really though, they had me at BACON. \n\nI opted for 3 eggs because Alberts just roll like that. And to no surprise, all three eggs were perfectly poached (see picture) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gqVl3RprESEqkIPeJH0yOg?select=7oS00AnQdPkMIJEHlW-YAA#0CVKzgAjJdUxsmvOxTCdEA, with that ooey-gooey yolk oozing over the bacon chedder muffin.

Grilled soft polenta cake cooked with spinach, wild mushrooms, a spicy tomato sauce, and toppled with 2 over easy eggs all baked in a steamingly endless cast iron skillet, which kept the whole dish pipping hot throughout the meal. Additional for the tangy delicious chorizo; a must get. \n\nZazie is one of those eateries that you'll not soon forget. Despite arriving during prime time for a late breakfast at noon (that's also how Alberts rolls) with the ever growing crowd of hungry San Franciscans at the door waiting to nab some eats, we were seated no more than 15 minutes upon arrival. More impressive was how fast each fine polished dish arrived at our table side. Furthermore was Zazie's service; our waiter was more than just polite and courteous, but he had personality. Anybody can be jolly and refill your drinks, but if you can crack jokes and get on a friendly personal level with your patrons, you know you love your job. \n\nWas it Fate that just so happened to bring me to Zazie's?

As so often happens when you go to a restaurant regularly you learn when service or food quality is excellent or has declined. Unfortunately, the decline bug struck tonight at this year's New Year's Eve dinner for us.. Keep in mind, our reservations were at 5:45pm and we were there early at 5:30pm so way too early on in the evening for the issues we encountered which will make sense later. \nWe were seated promptly as usual however the owner was absent (I'm used to seeing her there as she is so cheerful and welcoming and vested but the guy was totally fine and friendly. The problems came early and continued throughout the meal.\nIt started out as a simple menu change which, on the website, upon return to the house after dinner, from Corvina Sea Bass en Papillotte to Mahi Mahi en Papillotte. While a working menu was stated online, it still says sea bass, this was a horrible substitution and way, way different and less special  if you ask me for a prix fixe. We ordered a bottle of champagne which was fine as how can that be bad? We also ordered iced teas. The woman sitting next to us and  her equally gross children, were sneezing and coughing without covering her mouth/nose requiring us to change tables. I wonder where her kids learned that from? When sitting 1-2 feet apart from neighbors that becomes unacceptable and had my utensils and napkin and dinner roll changed out because who wants mucous when their eating a special dinner? This is the only factor that was out of control of the staff. The starter arrived... one of each. I was shocked at the size of the soup which literally amounted to about 4-6 ounces. Barely acceptable portion size yet simultaneously not acceptable. The salad was good and portion was normal. The dinner rolls as usual were excellent and the best part of the meal looking back. Then the second course arrived. One of each again. The raviolis were as usual excellent and I would have preferred those over the choice of tarte that I had (tonight and previously). The puff pastry was not crispy and the dish was luke warm (I've had that issue here before due to the placement of the kitchen and the back door breeze so was not a huge surprise or issue at the time, I just ate it and said nothing). The flavor was good despite it being luke warm and lacking in quality assurance. The main course arrived and again I was shocked at the portion size. We both got the, \"Braised Pinwheel Niman Ranch Beef Shortribs\" (because again, no sea bass, only mahi mahi). The entr\u00e9e should have been called Braised Pinwheel Niman Ranch Beef Shortrib... minus the s because s means plural and there was only one. While this dish was excellent in flavor, it was again not piping hot and portion for entree was horribly small. Dessert course arrives and again, we had one of each. Toasted Challah \"Pain Trouv\u00e9\" was not warm, it was tepid and the vanilla creme brulee that was on top was both cold and the brulee was not crispy, it was wet brulee as if it had been sitting in the refrigerator covered in plastic wrap and condensation had its way and not bruleed prior to delivery to the table. Chocolate Oblivion Cake portion was also very small. On top of the other shortfalls, they ran out of iced tea after my second glass... ran out! My other half only had one glass. How exactly has this restaurant taken a turn for the worse to such a degree? I myself am unsure but the failure of this evening without the owner present was completely tangible and would make me rethink a retry for any special occasion when this was previously always my go to place. How sad I was upon leaving the restaurant this evening. The words of sorry and argument from the curly haired French accented woman over whether she had asked us if we wanted any more water after they ran out of iced tea, all the while I was wondering why there was no water on the table were totally unacceptable. Not to mention, while I knew they had moved to a no tipping policy due to their employee arrangements, my ability to tip for service and quality was taken away from me and I much would have enjoyed expressing my displeasure through my ability to tip accordingly. I always, having been a server in my past, tipped very well when it was warranted. Tonight, it was not. Walking out unfulfilled on what was supposed to be a special evening left me irritated. Could I have chosen another restaurant? Absolutely. You as a restaurant only get one shot a year at New Year's Eve... it should be perfect. It should be orchestrated and made to be perfect. Perfection just doesn't happen. Was it perfect? No.  Was it close to perfect? No. How the hell can you \"run out\" of iced tea at 6pm on a major restaurant holiday and how can the food be suffering in quality including temperature and portion and no one notices or takes issue with that? Very disappointing.", "author": "David J."}

It was the place I'd take friends from out of town to eat at after fangirling over how awesome their potatoes were, how cute and cozy the atmosphere was, how much I loooooved their french toast. And, to be fair, it's all true, and I really wish I wasn't too proud to never go back.\n\nLong story not really short, after scouring the internet for places to brunch at for my birthday, I decided on Zazie, long line be damned. I knew 12 people was a stretch, considering how small the restaurant is (even with the patio in the back), but I saw other Yelpers mention their large parties in past reviews. I called the restaurant to confirm they would be able to accommodate us at the set date and time and to find out how we could make the situation easier for them. The guy on the phone sounded very friendly and confident that they could take the party without any issues. \n\nAs discussed over the phone, I showed up an hour early to put my name down and indicated what time my party would arrive so they would know what to expect. The outside was crowded as usual. About five minutes later, the host came out and loudly demanded to know who was in the party of 12. I walked up to him to quietly discuss it and, when he saw me, said (again, very loudly and rudely), \"No, I can't do it. I just can't do it.\" I told him I spoke with someone days earlier about the situation and he cut me off with, \"No. It doesn't matter who you spoke with. I can't do it.\" \n\nAweeesoooome I've just been dissed in front of a crowd on my birthday.\n\nAfter shutting me down and not giving me any options, I asked him what exactly he COULD do. He said he could break up the party into 2 tables, but we wouldn't be seated near each other nor at the same time (he wouldn't even look me in the face during this entire exchange). Uh, ok.. I settled on that for a moment. Then I frantically Yelped all the restaurants in the vicinity who took brunch reservations (not a whole lot, I'll tell you).. Luckily, Squat and Gobble on Haight was available, so, 10 minutes til birthday time, I called all my guests to inform them of the schedule changes. Half the people had just gotten off the bus or parked.\n\nI understand 12 people is a lot, especially for a small place. But there needs to be some kind of policy or clearer communication within the restaurant to prevent these kinds of situations. I work in the restaurant industry and I've been a hostess in the past. I know things get stressful during rush hours, but being condescending and humiliating customers isn't going to make things any better. I can take angry and annoyed, but rude is instant Black Out List status.", "author": "Liz M."}

Thus we trekked out to Cole Valley from North Beach and arrived at Zazie a little after 10 am, which we were strategically aiming for to avoid a wait. This was the way to go! Earlier will definitely help you avoid the wait if your party is small. We put our names down and I was afraid we were still going to wait a long time but our names got called about 5 to 10 minutes later. Success! \n\nHad the La Mer (eggs benedict with crab and avocado). Very delicious. My boyfriend had the Albert (eggs benedict with salsa, white cheddar, bacon) and he was also very happy. He ordered a side of the Tahitian French Toast, I ordered a side of the Diablo French Toast .. .DONT JUDGE US haha. The Diablo was a special, it was french toast + cherries and whipped mascarpone.

The lemon sauce they put on top can be a little too over powering so I just eat it with syrup.  We've also had the French toast which came piled with lots of fresh fruit! But if I were to choose between pancakes or French toast I would choose pancakes.  The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e oatmeal is also something I think everyone must try.

So excited to dine at this much talked about establishment off the beaten path, we were greatly disappointed in the food served.\n\nThe restaurant itself was no doubt charming, quaint, and had the appeal of a French cafe. The waiting time, also as expected, was lengthy as we waited slightly over an hour for a table. We were seated in the rear patio, which was a world removed from the crazy crowd of people in the front of the restaurant, as well as the hustle and bustle of the narrow interior of the restaurant. \n\nWe ordered a variety of things to share:\n\n- challah french toast with orange cinnamon batter: My standard benchmark for comparison is french toast. Zazie, what happened to your french toast!? The bread was so, so dry. Clearly looking like it hadn't been soaked in the egg batter, it was a huge disappointment to all of us at the table. We didn't even bother finishing one of our fav brunch dishes. Sad face.\n \n- gingerbread pancakes with bosc pears and lemon curd: Quite the opposite to the challah french toast, the pancakes were loaded with flavor. The flapjacks themselves were well flavored with ginger, and the topping of lemon curd and pears provided the moistness needed for the dfish. A single pancake was gargantuan. Beware of portion sizes.\n \n- Fontainbleau scramble with portobellos, shiitake, porcinis, spinach, fontina: Solid, but nothing special. I make the same scramble at home and it has a lot more flavor. Zazie needs something to set this dish apart from the ordinary. Sadly, I couldn't find that differentiating factor. \n\nAs much as I really want to, I can't say that I'd bother coming back here for brunch given the meal we had in relation to the wait time. It simply wasn't worth waiting for. Friends suggest dinner here is a better option, so perhaps I may give it a shot at some point...", "author": "Mansi A."}

So the above paragraph was one of my first times here, from here on is my updated review: Tonight I had the Mediterranean roasted vegetables again as an appetizer and then ordered the Cassoulet Paillet which is an incredible dish and perfect for a winter meal. It is comprised of white beans in a shallow broth with two types of sausage, then topped with an astounding crispy duck leg and hand cut larger breadcrumbs. My wife had a blue cheese dressed beet salad with an amazing trout for her dinner. I am telling you Zazie is such a cool and amazing place to eat. Very 'Country French'. Even though we arrived a bit early before they had opened, a very nice guy opened the door to tell us it would just be a few more minutes. Then he asked if we had reservations and what name it was under. When we only said our last name he without looking at a thing already knew who we were, and that we had requested the window table for four people. Even though it was just the two of us they reserved the table just for us!

Get one to go.\n\n3. The french toast will put you in a food coma, so plan nap time accordingly.  I highly recommend the Tahiti (w/ caramelized bananas and walnuts).  \n\n4. You will wait for weekend brunch; at least 30-45 minutes. The good news is that it is well worth it, and that there are some interesting stores nearby to help you pass the time.  Two tables in the front patio are first come, first serve.  \n\n5. And in honor of brunch traditions, I have to mention the fruit, granola and yogurt bowl.

The benedict was solid but nothing amazing, and the scramble may have been slightly overcooked.  The sides (home fries and wheat toast) were standard fare, nothing special.\n\nThe menu is pretty great because you can choose your portion size, but they do that thing where they charge you an extra $1.50 per item for employee healthcare benefits.  I do love that they treat their employees well, but I feel like doing that separate fee is just a way around not marking up the price of their food.  Why not lower your menu prices further and charge a separate fee for paying for rent of the restaurant space?

No problem. Put your name on the clipboard out front. (And yes, sitting out back IS worth the wait.)

This time for a party of two the wait was only 20 minutes.  \n\nOn nice days I highly recommend to wait for an outside seat in the back patio. I wished we requested one but we were hungry and didn't want to wait any longer than we needed to. \n\nWe ordered the Italie scramble with potatoes and a wheat toast and an order of French toast with carmelized bananas. I washed it down with a small $9 mimosa that hardly tasted of champagne. Quite honestly food was good but nothing out of the ordinary and was quite run of the mill; definitely not worth the at times lengthy wait. I really don't get what the buzz is all about.\n\nWith so many brunch options in the city I don't think its worth the long line for it. At least we are nearby and didn't make a special trip for this. I see some folks made it out here from as far as San Jose and probably waited an hour or so before they were seated. Ugh, I can't imagine driving 1+ hour and waiting another 1+ hour to be seated and wait anywhere from 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive before you can start eating and the realizing it was just as good as their local hometown favorite. \n\nI would come back but perhaps for dinner when there's a shorter queue and more low key.", "author": "Esther A."}

The sides were a simple salad and potatoes. My friend had the moules mariniere and she loved it.

The staff there were all very friendly and genuinely humorous. \nThe cool part about Zazie is that you can order their poached egg/ (kind of like an egg benedict) or their french toast by pieces. This allowed me to taste the best of both worlds because I can order one piece of the poached egg and one slice of the french toast without having too much food or spending too much money. The price was beyond reasonable considering their quality of both food and service. I got the tahiti french toast, which was pretty amazing, and their florentine poached egg.\nA side of potatoes was only $2; the portion was extremely generous.\nThe bloody mary was made with sake and is pretty popular. We also got the mango mimosa (called Sunshine), which was in my opinion the best tasting mimosa I've ever had.\nWill definitely come back.", "author": "Vicky H."}

It was truly meant to be. \n\nAhhh... coffee.  We were in dire need of this magical liquid and we were promptly presented with it.  \n\nSipping the coffee and transporting myself to France with the help of the decor which consisted of brick walls and various French items, I was in European bliss. \n\nAfter scouring the regular menu, I then noticed the specials and quickly decided on the Eggs Divorce - Poached eggs with crispy bacon, avocados, and melted fontina and home fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gqVl3RprESEqkIPeJH0yOg?userid=gHQ7f1swFlFU8LT2v8EWTQ.\n\nThe hubby ordered the Eggs en Fonte Grilled polenta cake with spinach, wild mushrooms, spicy tomato chevre sauce and two over easy eggs baked in a cast iron skillet with home fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gqVl3RprESEqkIPeJH0yOg?select=vTmHjI2F2LfBqaxhBmkwYQ.\n\nThe Eggs Divorce was sheer happiness in my mouth, and their interpretation of my dear friend Eggs Benedict rocks!  \n\nOk, hubby didn't ask if I wanted to sample his dish.

Came here on a sat afternoon and what do you know... there's over an hour wait (just like every other really good food place in SF). But I don't go to SF as often as I should, so my friend and I end up putting our names down and start walking around in the rain to kill time. Ended up going to Cafe Reverie, which is a great place to kill time and they have killer Chai lattes but I digress...\n\nI really like how this place separates out the food.... so for example... you can order one pancake, or two pancakes or three. Or you can order one french toast, two french toasts, or three... and you can even do it for the egg benedicts (they call them poached eggs)! Well the inner fatty in me came out and I ended up ordering all three. So I got a two pancakes of their season lemon ricotta pancakes... one french toast.. .and one of their bacon benedict with house potatoes. They were all amazing. Seriously if I go again... I'd probably do the same thing except maybe try the gingerbread pancakes (and maybe try to get more)! \n\nThe one that made the biggest impact were the pancakes! It's one of those explosion of flavors you're like \"wow... that was good...\"... so yes they live up to their hype... and if you get a poached egg, then it cuts down the sweetness with some salty not that you really need it all that much but it makes quite a great combo. And the french toast was really good too... but the pancakes and poached eggs were that much better... even the friggen house potatoes were above average! Well cooked and great seasoning. \n\nThe servers were really nice and it wasn't the most cramped place in SF but was nice and quaint.

The wait is really long for brunch, so we got there really early and the wait was non-existent. Read the other reviews if you want to hear what the brunch is like. This review is for Zazie's amazing DINNER!\n\nDinner at Zazie is a completely different experience from the crazy feeling that accompanies the brunch. At dinner, you really feel like you are being taken care of by the amazing staff. They take the time to talk to you and really get a sense of what kind of meal experience you are looking for that evening. The wine selection is good, and on Tuesday nights you can bring your own bottle with no-corkage fee. Amazing! The menu is seasonally based and rotates. You can always count on finding a delicious fish and steak option. My personal favorite is the lamb tagine. Their appetizers (go for the moules manieres) are really tasty, and the desserts are sinful. \n\nDinner at Zazie is one of my favorite activities in my neighborhood. It's got such a great cozy vibe that is almost lost at brunch. Sure, you can't beat that eggs benedict and french toast, but try dinner. You won't be disappointed.", "author": "Kaitlyn N."}

Again, really sorry for forgetting.  BUT!  This general manager was incredibly sweet.  I was super hungry, by myself and arrived about 30-45 minutes before closing.  I believe it was 2pm, the morning of the Bay to Breakers race in SF.  He sat me immediately (because I was just one person) and they served me right away.  I appreciate the sense of urgency and also the service.  My servers name (I hope he is still there so that he gets a chance to read this review) was Patrice, and I will never forget it.  He was kind, attentive, friendly and all smiles while he took my order and continued to check up on me.  His recommendations were wonderful.  I had the 1/2 order of Crab Benedict from what I remember, and a half order of the Tahitian stuffed French Toast.  Pretty sure the benedict was able to be order as a half portion as well.  The side of the benedict with the potatoes, and whole cloves of garlic and cippolini onions was ABSOLUTELY DEE-LISH!  I thoroughly enjoyed these potatoes and have had no others potatoes quite like it before then or after visiting Zazie's!  Complements to the chef!

I'm more of an eggs and bacon breakfast kind of gal... But for some reason, Zazie's pancakes and french toasts were calling my name. And boy, am I glad I listened! \n\nThe miracle pancakes were the FLUFFIEST pancakes I had ever had. There were poppy seeds in the batter - who knew simply adding poppy seeds could make a pancake so delicious?! Also, there was a dollop of lemon curd and a handful of macerated strawberries sitting comfortably on top. THAT LEMON CURD. Oh. my. lord. That lemon  curd was so GOOD. I could eat it all day long... I would definitely order this again if I have a chance to come back again!!! \n\nThe french toast tahiti was also quite good. It was stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts.

The wait was agonizing. I personally didn't know why I was standing out there for so long just to get myself the brunch but of course I took my words back as soon as I took my first bite. The 2nd thing I hate about this place is the fact that I find it kinda small and cramped. I didn't exactly enjoyed my seating that much...it was oddly uncomfortable.\n\nALTHOUGH...I learned to overlook those two big flaws in a restaurant by the taste of their food, their taste of the food, and did i mention their taste of their food? YEA....It was so great that I really want to go back right now to eat it for brunch. I've been comparing so many brunch places to Zazie and honestly they really have nothing on Zazie. Their service was quite nice and I do find it enjoyable. \n\nI tried the Croque Madame...oh *drool* It was sooooooo freaking delicious. It was such a nice and beautiful combination that I really don't want to share with anybody but of course I did because i wanted to try other stuff with my friends and family haha. It was all so fresh and it was just beautifully made when the yolk just slowly leaked out but it just taste so heavenly.\n\nI personally find the French Toast Tahiti the 2nd thing I enjoyed after my Croque Madame. It was so nicely made because the banana was just roasted perfectly and the french toast was just WOWZERS. It was crispy and the roasted perfect bananas just like fuse together with wonderful taste. AH...delicious\n\nNew York Scrambled Salmon Egg was quite nice. I thought the salmon was cooked very nicely unlike the places I have tried in the past. It was seasoned well compare to many other places that I've been and it doesnt have that weird texture to it. \n\nHmm..i guess i didnt find the pancakes that enjoyable.

It's near and dear to many 'a people's left ventricles come the weekend, and few places I've been to provide better tasting sunrise fare in a quaint, Euro setting than Zazie. With enough egg-based dishes to scare the pants off of any spring chicken, and delectable carbohydrates like the Pinkie's Challah French Toast and their signature gingerbread pancakes, every little morsel featured on their menu is a real treat. Personally, I'm all about the omelettes and benedicts, but the sweet stuff always has a Siren-esque quality, testing me to curb my inner fat kid. Even if you possess more of a savory palate, you really should indulge in their sugary offerings. \n\nThe lines can grow pretty long on the weekends, but somehow, I can't recall ever waiting more than 30 minutes for a table.

Brunch is good too. BUT! I can't understand why anyone would queue for hours to get in for breakfast/brunch. To those who wait on the sidewalk can you please get out of the way of other pedestrians?

Busy is a good sign. We put our names on the list outside the front door (because they don't take reservations for brunch or lunch). We were about 20 names down the list, but we had driven all the way from Santa Clara so we waited.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nBasically the whole thing was a clusterfu**. There are two tables outside (first come, first served) so people were hovering over the people eating waiting to snatch a seat which I thought was pretty weird. Also, the host kept sneaking people he knew in before the other people on the list. I'm not one to make a stink, but I thought that was pretty lame as we had been standing in the sun for almost an hour. \n\nAnyway, fast forward about an hour and the host tells us \"ok, you guys are the on the patio outside, second table on the left), then walks away. Uh, this is my first time here, are we supposed to wander aimlessly around the restaurant until we find our table? We eventually found the table which was directly facing another group? Basically it was four little tables, arranged into a larger square in between two corner booths, so we were literally staring at the other group the whole meal. A little awkward but not a problem. The rest of the patio was beautiful. I was surprised how cool it was as it was around 75 degrees outside. \n\nFood:\nI ordered the french toast with the caramelized bananas and walnuts (I forget what they're called) with a side of oatmeal and coffee to drink. Overall, my food was great. The coffee was great. Service was ok, but considering it was so busy I can overlook that. \n\nBf got the omelet with a shitload of mushrooms (obviously thats not what it was called but, again, I forgot the real name. ahah) and a bottle of lemonade to drink. He seemed to really like his food and loved the lemonade. \n\n$55 (plus tip) and 2 hours later we are on our way, full and happy as clams.

It had rave reviews and seemed to be very good, so we decided to try it out. The only thing is the wait is horrendous. We waited for an hour to get seated, so we were starving by the time we got seated. The host is very nice, so it does make you feel less hangry, but still. When we got seated, we ordered just glasses of champagne. Forget the juice for a mimosa, just give it to us straight, and the waiter was more than happy to oblige. I then ordered the un, deux, trois with chicken apple sausage, and a bowl of fruit on the side. The pancake and eggs were delightful. One of my friends got the Florentine, which she said was very scrumptious, and my other friend got the Pierre Noir, and she also said her's was very good. I think that may have been an understatement, because all of our plates were thoroughly cleaned. All of that came up to be less than $100.

Carol L. got the gingerbread pancakes - which had a very cake-like consistency and was probably better as dessert than breakfast fare.  Every dish we saw come out of the kitchen beckoned to us and we were definitely eating other people's meals with our eyes.  My Florentine Benedict was excellent - the portabello mushrooms and the spinach didn't make me miss my usually Eggs Benedict ham at all.

The story is below if you're interested but ultimately, I'm not sure I'll want to to head back to Zazie because I'd rather not ever have have to see Suhail, the night manager.\n\n9 am Sunday, Zazie's open for brunch. My party of 4 was glad to find that the line wasn't long, in fact there were only four names on the list before we added ours (they'd only been open a short while). As we waited, I explained to my friends that from my past experiences, their Sunday brunch is worth the wait. As my last review indicates, I got my friends excited about how the food is good and comes out quickly, service is really good and from my visits has been rather consistent. \n\nAfter 30 minutes had passed, we're still waiting and we're watching some other folks who came after us get seated. We understand that because we have a party of four, we have to wait for a table for four and we're absolutely cool with that. \n\nTo pass the time, I walk up to the sign in sheet for a status check and notice that there are eight names crossed off below mine, including one party of 4 and and another party of 3. Uh-oh, perhaps we were accidentally skipped? I noticed that the usual guy, Mario, isn't there. It's not a big deal but worth asking the substitute host Suhail about, right? Sure.\n\n\"Hi, My name is Jen and my name is listed here. Is it possible that we might have been accidentally skipped?\" I asked. I couldn't believe the response I got, which was, \"I'm pretty sure I'm better at this job than you.\"\n\nWhat?\n\nI'm pretty sure I didn't ask you for your job. I'm pretty sure that was condescending and unnecessary. I'm pretty sure that insult spiked my heart rate. I'm pretty sure there's about 94 other ways you could've responded that would have been more appropriate and professional than the garbage that just fell out of your mouth. \n\nI might have felt better if any of that came to mind in that moment so I could've said it. All I could muster was \"that was really rude man, I can't believe you just said that.\" Not a cool response but an honest one and I'm not even getting paid to handle this guy. I asked \"where's the usual guy? He's cool, he's not rude and he's good at this job.\" At this, Suhail replied, \"you can tell him yourself when he gets back.\" Awesome. \n\nSince I'm undecided about whether I'll head back to Zazie, I may not get the chance to give Mario my message so here it is for all of you fine people. I bet being the Sunday host at Zazie is a real tough job. Mario, thank you for your professionalism, your efficiency, your customer service. People wait around half their day to get into your restaurant for the fine food and service. \n\nTo Suhail, I get that it isn't always fun to go to work but that's the job. What are you doing?  When you told me \"we'll make it up to you,\" I'm not sure what you meant by that because I'm still waiting.  \n\nWhile I just wanted to leave at this point, we continued to hang around in disbelief over the exchange that had just happened. Maybe 10 to 15 minutes later, he called my name. Well, I guess we might as well eat. I asked my friend to go in first because I was feeling pretty stung and didn't want to have to look at the guy. \n\nUnfortunately, he stopped us before we were able to get into the door. He made it a point to walk up to me and explain \"I wasn't being rude; I was being frank.\" Oh Frank; don't man, you're making it worse. Please stop poking that spot you already jabbed. \n\nHe went on to explain how seating works, how if he'd called my name then he would've written the time next to my name and when he went to point to the sign in sheet he actually hit me. He didn't mean to hit me, but he did. One of my friends started laughing; what did Suhail think was happening here? Maybe he did want to hand off his job at this point and was trying to give me instructions.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't have asked a question. Maybe I should have just waited around longer, feeling mildly concerned that our name might have been overlooked. Maybe when I want to give an establishment my business, my endorsement and my money I should just keep my mouth shut and not ask questions. Yeah, maybe that.\n\nMaybe the next time one of my customers asks me a question, I'll tell them \"I'm pretty sure I'm better at this job than you.\" Maybe if I want to lose my job. \n\nCompletely counter to Suhail, Melissa the server was kind and polite and embodied the characteristics I've come to expect from Zazie. I made sure I thanked her for her kind service; I needed her to know I appreciated her positive professionalism. Unfortunately, the good food and kind server couldn't rinse out the bitter start to my Zazie experience. I wish it did.", "author": "Jen Y."}

Entire dish approx. $10-$15...can't complain there.\n\nI held back two stars on this place mainly because they do have some substantial room for improvement. The biggest area in need of some help is \"wait time\" before being seated.  The wait here was somewhere over an hour or so - I had lost track of time standing out in the cold. Maybe if Zazie invested in a few standing heaters or a few benches, the wait would be more bearable and less noticeable. I've been to a few places in San Francisco that allow you to order drinks while you wait...maybe that would be an option for this place. Wait times are part of the business especially when you're a breakfast place with a reputation like Zazie but even then, find a way to make the time more manageable at least!

Put it first in your mind that you are paying a living wage to everyone that works there, even the dishwasher and bus boy! (or girl).  The food is good, really good. What I find wonderful is that the employees have paid benefits, sick leave, and a 401K, just like I do.  Equality makes me feel better about spending a lot.  These are things that most restaurants do not have.  The tip is included, so I can have as much wine as I want and will not have to worry about calculating a tip.  The prices are very similar to what we paid in Australia when we went out.  They too pay a living wage.  Given all this, imagine eating food that is well prepared in a chic ambiance with not too long a wait.  I usually go to Zazie's during off-peak times.  Either early or late.  So, I never suffer like a lot of people do with a terribly long wait.  My favorite dish is the Lamb tagine at dinner.  I have had the beef stew and found it rich and savory with tender pieces of beef.  I haven't had a thing here that I did not like.  Save room for dessert.  And try not to eat too much bread because you will get too full.  During the week they have 1 night where you can bring your well-behaved dog to dinner and another night where there is no corkage.  Plus, the service is very attentive and friendly.  I love this place.", "author": "Yoko O."}

Beginning first with the pancakes, the batter for which is sold on site, it would be hard to decide whether the Gingerbread or Cornmeal option was better but with maple syrup, pears, and lemon curd all accounted for the margin was slim and all were delicious with the texture of the cornmeal cakes toothsome yet light, an achievement not commonly achieved.  Moving next to the French toast it should seem obvious to anyone that a dish with bruleed bananas, candied walnuts, and maple syrup would be delicious but what really set this toast apart was actually the subtle hints of citrus, an unexpected twist that made the entire dish taste slightly tropical and not as overwhelmingly sweet as one might think.", "author": "Michael U."}

So, unfortunately, the secret's been out for over a year, and if you used to be a Zazie frequent flier, you are now dealing with over an hour's wait. Your two options are then: get here incredibly early or around 2:30pm because they close for brunch service at 3. All egg dishes are fantastic here, but I particularly enjoy any they do with bacon because it's always thick and crispy. But really, you're shooting for either a fat miracle pancake or the gingerbread one. So fluffy, so airy, and the lemon curd. Bomb. Either of those will be enough to fill you up, and if you're really hungry, grab a stack of 2, but honestly, everything is good here. Staff is always super attentive, though they get your order wrong kind of often. They're really friendly though and fix things quickly.

Chorizio lacked flavor and any real kick. Home fries were standard fare, also included toast 6/10\n\nBenedict was a disappointment, as I am a huge fan of them. Zazie had a nicely poached egg, soft and runny yolk which I enjoyed. But the whole point of benedict is to have a rich creamy Hollandaise, which Zazie did not deliver. Minimum amount of sauce for me to not complain but definitely skimped. Sauce itself was thin and bland. More zesty than usual but I had to really strain to experience the flavor. Muffin on the bottom was average, nothing special. Crab was decent. Fresh but again nothing special. It was just there. Didn't stand out or enhance the experience. Home fries were standard fare 5/10\n\nThe restaurant has a very quaint feel which I enjoyed. More mom and pop than uber trendy modern and it works. The staff was friendly and attentive. Also, I commend their progressive no tip policy. \n\nBrunch in the city has been tainted with high prices and average food, Zazie is a prime example. San Francisco is an expensive city, trust me I get it. Food here is decent, I just really question how places get away with charging $50 dollars for 5 eggs, potatoes, and coffee (really think about what you are actually paying for). Yelp has over-hyped this place, as it should rated on a whole at around 3 stars. I am practical minded and appreciate value which this place does not have. For this price range I expect an above average (not even spectacular) meal. If this is on your brunch/benedict list (as it was for mine for a couple years) do yourself a favor and skip it.

My boyfriend and I luckily snagged one of the first come first serve tables outside and was able to avoid the wait. Zazie's brunch has a French feel to it, with classic brunch items as well as more traditional French dishes like croque monsieurs. To get a good mix of sweet and savory, we ordered the egg special of the day, which was a benedict with asparagus and prosciutto. Although on the softer side, I loved the potatoes that came with it, especially the garlicky and peppery char on the outside. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the asparagus and prosciutto was a unique addition. The hollandaise wasn't too heavy, but I would've preferred a thicker English muffin. We also had the griddle flight, featuring one piece of French toast, one buttermilk pancake, and one gingerbread pancake. The highlight of this dish is definitely the gingerbread pancake! It's doughy and almost cakey, with just the right touch of gingerbread flavor.

They won't fit and they wouldn't enjoy the food as a large group. Food here is meant to be enjoyed by you and another friend or two. But if you must bring lots of people.. I can't stop you. It's just a suggestion after all (: Anyway, back to the food. Yum! \n\nI ordered a Tuna sandwich and it was tender and not over done! Finally! Great combination of flavors with what looks like a bed of salad right in your sandwich. The whole meal was as satisfying as it was delicious. This place has not seen the last of me until I've tried everything on the menu. Challenge accepted. Until we meet again Zazie!", "author": "Amy C."}

Food is on the decent side, nothing that really will cause me to refer my friends over about.\n\nWe ordered the Croque Madame (2/5) which is their Croque Monsieur with a sunny side up egg on top. Regular white toast, ham was ok, egg, overall just a ham and egg sandwich that I could've made at home.\n\nBenedict (1/5) lacked sauce, was like a drizzle compared to what I'm usually used to. It gives me the impression that they're being cheap.\n\nFrench toast was decent.\n\nOur server is the guy with glasses, poor attitude, slow service, very dry personality and seemingly blind. Passed by our table multiple times, we ordered coffee and usually you'd expect a waiter to notice an empty cup. When asked for sugar, he looked at our tray and said, are those used and starts to grab from our used sugar packs. Are you really that lazy to grab more? I had to grab packs from tables beside us because our waiter was too \"busy\" to grab sugar for us. We asked for extra cream too, 10min later one of the busboys came by and grabbed some for us. Guess that's why they add in the $1.25 per person rule on their menu, no one would tip such a poor service. \n\nEither way, food was decent, but I think I'd stick to Mama's or Butler and the Chef for much better tasting food and better service!", "author": "Dan Y."}

This was my FAVORITE part of the meal, it was very similar to cornbread but in pancake form, the flavors were well balanced and I wish I had a stack of 10 :) \n\nOverall good flavors, a bit on the pricy side, however many innovative flavors.

At Zazie, I truly felt like I was swept away to a little piece of France within the hustle and bustle of the city. \n\nMy one amigo and I experienced about a 15 minute wait time on a Saturday afternoon. There's a sign-up sheet in front of the restaurant to write down your name, and the paper also thoroughly explains how long you can expect the wait time to be. We opted for the patio or inside option, whichever was faster. However, this is one restaurant where I would actually recommend sitting outside. It's so GREEN, and with heat lamps you will still be comfortable even on a chilly San Francisco afternoon. \n\nThe tables in the FRONT are first come, first serve. I guess sit there if you don't have a lot of time on your hands? But why you would choose to rush through an experience at Zazie is beyond me. \n\nOnto the food. Being in a breakfast mood, I ordered the Mexico scrambled eggs, which also came with a salad and toast for around $13. The scrambled eggs were perfectly seasoned that complimented the chorizo inside it. I heard their gingerbread pancakes are good but I'd definitely recommend the Mexico scrambled eggs if you're looking for something on the lighter side!\n\nOur waitress was exceptionally smiley and seemed like she truly enjoyed what she was doing. AND she pointed out that she too had the same spelling of Jeanine, which I've yet to come cross. Who knew. \n\nHowever, one star off for that weird bathroom situation! It's an itty bitty room with nowhere to keep your purse or other belongings and right next to the kitchen/walkway. A little unsettling. Other than that....\n\nAmbiance: 5...Bienvenue mes amis.  \nService: 5...Nothing better than people who love what they do and show you too!\nTaste: 5...Perfectly spicy and savory in the brunch-time hours. \nValue/Price: 5...Standard restaurant price for food that is wayyy above the standard.", "author": "Jeanine W."}

It was a bit of a hike from Russian Hill but totally worth it. I'm a huge nerd, so getting to use their new reservation system was awesome. A well connected set of iPads lets you enter your names and see in real  time where you are on the list. It only took us about 45 minute to get a patio table (it was gorgeous outside). We went nextdoor to Finnegans Wake to meet some neighbors while we waited.\n\nWhen it was time to be seated someone at Zazie's actually came over into Finnegans Wake to let us know our table was ready... talk about freaking service. We sat next to two awesome groups of people and began to order.\n\nThis place has the most extensive mimosa list I have ever seen.

The overall Yelp rating and rave reviews should speak to the quality of the food and service, so instead I wanted to give you a few tips for eating at one of the best brunch places in SF:\n\n1. If you get there between 9-10am or 2-3pm on weekends, the wait is usually a lot shorter.\n2.Despite there being signs stating so, not a lot of people realize that the tables out front are first-come, first-served. Save yourself a 45-minute wait and make small talk with a table that's waiting for their check and and swoop in before the table's bussed. \n3. Try and put your name down for the back patio - it's a beautiful garden-like setting and not as crowded as the dining room.\n4. If you're more than 10 names down on the list, you probably have at least 30 minutes; go get a Bloody Mary at Finnegan's Wake next door.\n5. Order the eggs benedict. Better yet, one of you get La Trop and one of you get Le Mer and share.\n6. If more than three of are getting mimosas, it's more fun to get a bottle of champagne and a couple little pitchers of juice and build your own.\n7. If you're craving it and don't feel like waiting in line, call in a take-out order. (But add 5 minutes to the time they say it'll be ready, or go get a coffee at Peet's next door.) Bring a shopping bag with handles.\n\nHappy Brunching!", "author": "Jon M."}

Of course, this was less preferred by other patrons since it was quite quite cold that day but we were hungry and frankly could care less since they had heat lamps outside anyway.\n\nWe ordered everything on the menu, as always. Whenever I eat brunch, I tend to get really greedy.

So we proceeded to be greedy and ordered to our stomachs' content. And boy was it good.\n\nEverything was delicious, their poached eggs are five stars all around, since you can get them in one, two and three egg varieties.

The menu looked pretty killer and both my boyfriend and I are suckers for a good benedict. We got there before opening and waited, then waited a little bit more (not nearly as bad as Portland!) as the host seated everyone quickly and systematically. I was impressed. We were seated back on the patio, which was gorgeous. They have heat and string lights, making it perfect for any season. We ordered a couple cups of coffee, a half order of the crab benedict, a gingerbread pancake, and a mini baguette. \n\nWe received our coffee promptly and it was quite tasty. Then came the baguette. This is where things started to go downhill. The baguette was toasted (which the menu made no mention of) and that would have been just fine had it not been cold and almost stale by the time it arrived at the table. Okay, maybe it was a bad day for baguettes. It could be worse! Next up was the Dungeness Crab Benedict. This looked promising, but it too was disappointing. The crab was beyond minimal, the english muffin tasted like it had freezer-burn and the hollandaise was almost unpalatably sour. At this point, we just hoped the gingerbread pancake could salvage the breakfast. Unfortunately, it did not. It could have been good. It was not far from being good! As we got further into the pancake, it just became drier and drier. We left most of it behind. \n\nMaybe the kitchen was having an off day, I don't know.

I've only been for brunch.\n\nThe best part about this place, the reason why I'm always stoked to have brunch here, is that you can spend your 1-1.5 hour wait in the bar next door drinking the best bloody mary in town and they'll come get you when your table is ready. I mean if you go out to brunch anywhere especially yummy on a weekend in SF, you're going to have to wait at least that long typically. Why not ease the pain (And your hangover)? That alone justifies the price. Location, location, location.\n\nI recommend the crab cake or salmon benedict. The tuna sandwich is also pretty yummy. If you and a few people in your party want a mimosa, don't order individually, get a bottle and share.", "author": "Sarah W."}

Our party of 6 waited 1.5 hours, but oh my gosh, this place is sooooo good!   Well worth the wait, but next time I think I'll go earlier.  \n\nI had a the poached eggs Monaco-style (with prosciutto and provencal tomatoes), and they were absolutely delicious.  This dish was similar to an Eggs Benedict. The Hollandaise sauce was the perfect viscosity, and the poached eggs weren't too runny or too hard.  It was so perfectly poached, it was so easy to eat this dish.  It came with home fries too (much like skillet potatoes).  I also had a Bloody Mary, which also tasted good.  Not too spicy, and like everything else here...perfect.  I had a taster of my friend's French Toast Tahiti, and that was also SUPER tasty.  The right about of fluffiness and sweetness in one.  \n\nThe restaurant is pretty small (hence the long wait), but the food is unbeatable.   The service is pretty good too.  Fair priced and totally worth it!  I would totally recommend you come here if you're in town.  Otherwise, you're missing out!\n\nOn a side note, they do charge $1.25 per person on each bill to be able to contribute to employee benefits and medicals plans.

My friend got the divorce\u00e9 poached eggs.  All very delicious! But then as I got closer to finishing my French toast my friend notices a piece of crab in the bottom. Disgusting. It smelled very fishy too.  At that point I couldn't eat anymore. Minus 1 star. \n\nKatie came over and checked on us in what seemed like forever as we waited for the bill.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-04-21", "description": "Awww man, I'm so disappointed. Based on hearsay, I was super excited to titillate my taste buds with Zazie's hyped up fare. Unfortunately, not much titillation went down...at least not enough to warrant tackling the weekend crowd. \n\nAs a note to the weary, this place is a battle-zone on weekends...yes a BATTLE-ZONE. Consequently, I was banking on an opportune weekday to present itself before attempting to venture here. And that opportune weekday finally appeared in the form of a rainy Tuesday afternoon. When my friend and I arrived around 1pm,  parking was surprisingly easy and wait-time for a table was zilch. Score! \n\nOne neat thing about Zazie is that the menu caters to varying levels of gluttony as the french toast, egg, and pancake dishes can be ordered in portion sizes of 1-3 pieces. After perusing the options, we decided to split 1 French Toast Tahiti, 2 Gingerbread Pancakes, and a Croque Monsieur sandwich.\n\nOut of what we ordered, the French Toast Tahiti was top-notch and definitely my favorite dish of the meal. It's too bad we only got one piece! The combination of challah stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts was simply divine. However, after the French Toast Tahiti, the meal took a turn for the worse. Next up were the Gingerbread Pancakes with pears and lemon curd. And while it was a pretty solid dish, it wasn't anything to rave about. I expected the ginger flavor to be a little more prevalent. Finally, the Croque Monsieur was the last dish to be served, and it was also the worst. It just wasn't on par with Croque Monsieurs I've had at other establishments. The gruyere baked on top tasted off, and the bread was over-cooked. \n\nAdditionally, while the service was definitely friendly, it was a little questionable for the following reasons: \n1) The waitress was constantly getting people's orders mixed up.\n2) Same waitress was thumbing people's lattes. \n3) Same waitress dropped a steak knife that was centimeters from slicing my ankle during it's fall to the floor. \n\nHumm...is this the same Zazie that everybody is raving about? I'm thinking I just came on an off-day since there are 1,000+ people out there who would disagree with my assessment. Guess I'll have to wait for the next opportune weekday to roll around so I can come back and re-deliberate.

Tiny hole in the wall where a great mix if people come to gather around a hearty plate of eggs. \n\nThe coffee drinks are served in gigantic bowls, which, while somewhat inconvenient, it is totally awesome and really makes you feel like you're in a boutique cafe in France. If I were to know what that was like.\n\nGet the gingerbread pancake and use it as a brunch appetizer. You won't regret it. And then you can fully indulge in the more savory menus items without shame. In fact everything is sold in ones, twos, and threes, so you can do your eggs and sweets to boot! If they're out of French toast that day, which happens because its amazing, there's plenty to choose from but you must come back. The French Toast Tahiti is on my list of death row meals. \n\nMy best recommendation for Zazie though, come on either a crappy foggy day to avoid the bulk of the crowds or come on a beautify sunny day and wait for the outside table which is first come first served. Either way, be prepared for one of the best brunches of your life.", "author": "C. Nikole S."}

The first thing that caught my eye was their restaurant values: supporting the staff to be successful by including built in prices that include gratuity so no actual tips are part of the equation. This helped justify the overly expensive eggs Benedict and pancakes we purchased.  Their form of customizing your own breakfast is neat - instead of ordering a plate you can choose how many eggs Benedict you would like or how many pancakes. This is awesome for portion control and knowing what to expect! If you're a bottomless pit I would warn you to find the nearest typical breakfast place with a little more quantity minus the quality: the quality that zazie puts in its food.\n\nWe ordered three pancakes with a side of apple sausage;  and two of the divorcee eggs Benedict (crispy bacon alongside avacado with a perfectly poached egg on top of the English muffin) with salad. The pancakes were worth every bite - delicious alongside the provided typical maple syrup: Fluffy and thick pancakes. Apple sausage was delicious - not anything new though. \n\nThe eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly with the yolk slightly running when you cut it open but still suspended within the yolk. The hollandaise sauce was a little bland but that's something a little salt and pepper couldn't fix. Perhaps this is the way they would like their guests to cut down on sodium? The avacado was a nice contrast to the bacon grease which added to the overall balanced taste. The salad on the side was also a great way to balance off the meal - aka green mix leaves without dressing. If you don't like plain leaves I would get the fries.\n\nOverall I felt like the staff enjoyed working there and it was evident in the general vibe of the place! I wish the staff asked whether I'd like to sit outside out back - it's quite nice back there! Lastly this is super close to the N line so give it a shot!", "author": "James L."}

Woo Hoo!\n\nNow that the business is out of the way time for the pleasure. And this place was all that. \n\nMy girl and I are visiting San Francisco for the weekend so we searched the web for the best places to eat while we where here. Zazie came up as one of the best places to get breakfast and after reading the menu we decided to go check out the brunch. \n\nAfter finally tracking down the place we came across the worst part of this experience, finding a place to park! Took us about 20 minutes to find a spot. After that little annoyance it was pure bliss.\n\nThere was a line out the door. There is no real host/hostess to speak of but a clipboard outside the door. Put your name on the list and when you can finally sit down they call you. You don't wait in a normal lobby or seating area but outside which was actually really nice considering it was a bright and sunny day. \n\nWe only waited another 15 minutes or so then we were called in. The place is small, but seating feels less congested and more intimate. Like you are in a room full of your friends. Brightly painted, cool art, and if you look around you can see why they named the place Zazie.\n\nThe service was great. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. At one point I dropped my knife on the floor and,  this is no exaggeration, in less than 10 seconds he took the dirty one and replaced it which I really appreciated because I didn't want to stop eating. \n\nOh right, the food.... WAS AMAZING!\n\nI had the French Toast Tahiti and the Mexico style scrambled egg (minus the toast) and she had the New York style scrambled eggs (with the wheat toast). I have nothing bad to say about any of it. The french toast was soft, big, moist, and flavorful. Both of our scrambled eggs were hot and delicious. I did not try the toast personally but she loved it so much we had to get extra butter. I did not confirm it but I am sure they get their bread fresh everyday. \n\nHonestly though my favorite part was the water. It came in this antique looking glass bottle.

But, there's a crepe cafe a block away you can grab a cup of coffee while you're waiting. \n\nThe element that sold me on Zazie was it's outdoor patio: it reminded me of a brunch place I tried in Brooklyn.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-25", "description": "I hadn't been here for about ten years for no particular reason. Got curious about it again after reading about their employment and all-inclusive-prices (except tax) policies. Especially with so many restaurants adding those peevish surcharges, sometimes surreptitiously, this place sounded like it would probably be a lot more fun, and it was.\n\nLow five, but still a five. I will be back.\n\nFirst off, high five to the no tipping policy. Giving the staff profit sharing, making them partners in the restaurant's success, does more for honest, warm service than any need to play to a customer does. Service was excellent. This doesn't mean fast. Expect to spend a full hour or more for dinner.\n\nThe soup of the day, lentil, was delivered quickly and comforting. Four stars. Watch out for the roll - it's hot!\n\nThe lamb tagine was heavenly. The flavors mixed well, providing contrast with different bites. A couple spots were on the dryish side, making this a low five. It is delicious - every bite full of flavor - and I would order this again after trying some of the other dishes. There was a wait for this one - do order an app so you're not starving - and it totally shows in the development of the complex yet simple tastes.\n\nThe petit pot du creme au chocalat was creamy and intensely chocolatey, with a cloud of whipped cream on top. It was petite, as advertised, yet there's nothing more I could have possibly eaten that evening that would have topped it. High five stars. I want to try other things on their dessert menu as well - and the cheese plate - but the memory calls to me \"come back, come back.\"\n\nActually, alternating memories of the lamb tagine and the chocolate call to me.\n\nInteresting that with all the hard surfaces the noise level was so low. The background music was barely perceptable, which probably kept peoples' voices down. One more reason this is a great place. No single-diner attitude, either, and no attitude about my not drinking.\n\nYou really get to understand that dinner is about enjoying a relaxed meal here. More restaurants could do to follow this business model.\n\nOh, and a couple posters on the wall for Zazie Dans Le Metro, I film I enjoyed many years ago.", "author": "Charles B."}

So we ended up waiting another 20minutes. When is our turn, he went \"why look so unhappy?\" Well, we waited for more an hour. \n\nZazie is a good place.

But if you come here for brunch on the weekends (especially on sundays) be prepared for a wait!! You write your name down on a list by the door and they'll come get you when they have something available for you. The one no-no at Zazie is asking how long the wait is. They get really sassy about it because they say it slows them down and what not which makes sense I guess. But you just really gotta wait patiently here. \n\nThere's always a big crowd camped outside since the restaurant is actually really tiny. But they do have a back patio which has more seating. There are two tables out front though which are special. These are first come first serve so if you happen to see someone leaving the table, be prepared to pounce. This is only convenient in nice SF weather though. And only for the brave of heart as everyone waiting out side will judge you as you eat. Every bite. Judgement. Just saying. I've been on both ends. It's intense. \n\nSo yes, this place is mostly a brunch place, though they are a regular restaurant, I haven't been for anything but brunch though. \n\nThey are kind of pricey, but hey it's brunch. So it's worth it. Any of their scrambles are delicious I've had a few of them. It comes with two pieces of toast and either a salad (I think) or home fried. Go for the fries. Come on now. Do you even have to think about it? The homefries come with roasted garlic which is delicious. I like to spread it on the toast and it's so good. \n\nFor brunch they usually have a special going on. This morning, I went and the special was an omelette with white cheddar, asparagus, pesto, and chicken apple sausage. Prime brunch munch perfection. It was delicious and I'm always into getting those not on the menu, only can try once kind of things. \n\nTheir drinks are pretty pricy, but rather large so if you really want your mocha or latte fix, I'd say go for it. The chai I got wasn't so great though. Kind of watered down. But side note - if you want to take whatever's left of it to go when you're finished they'll transfer it to a to go cup which is nice. \n\nAgain, the place is tiny so be prepared for a wait.

We did get frustrated when a table was open for a while and they sat a group of 4 who had literally just arrived before us because I guess they were waiting to put us a table for 2. \n\nI ordered the new york egg scramble (lox, cream cheese and onions) served with homefries and toast. My friend ordered the monacco poached egg also with homefries. The food is really good, no complaints about that at all. \n\nWe had a bit of a hard time getting coffee refills but otherwise service was very good as well. It's not cheap (plan on spending about $15-20 per person) but it's tasty!\n\nA quick note on seating: The tables outside in the front are first come first served. We were seated outdoors on the patio in the back where they have heatlamps but sitting out there it actually got really hot. So definitely layer up or be prepared to wait extra time for a table inside.", "author": "Rachel E."}

After perusing a few stores along the block and grabbing some coffee, before we knew it our table was ready. We scored the awesome table right next to the window to give us a view of the growing hungry crowd gathering outside and waiting patiently.\n\nWe ordered the following: \n\nFrench toast Tahiti - stuffed with bananas and walnuts\nFontainbleau - scrambled eggs with variety of mushrooms\nNew York - scrambled eggs with smoked salmon \nLa Mer - Poached eggs with crab\n\nLatte came out in a bowl. Love it. Felt like I was drinking soup rather than coffee. I also appreciated they let patrons choose how many eggs or slices of French toast they prefer. So from the small to the big eaters, the portion sizes will be tailored to your preference. Everything came with a side of home fries, which were thick chunks of potatoes with whole cloves of buttery garlic. YUM! I could eat them every day. All of the dishes were solid and delicious, but nothing was a true standout for me. The flavors and ingredients have all been done before, and considering the big crowds, I was expecting much more. Maybe I've unknowingly become a brunch snob. Or maybe I've heard way too much hype about Zazie and my expectations were through the roof. Whatever it was, I'm not sure if the food is enough to warrant the ridiculously long wait time. \n\nMinus the line, I would definitely re-visit Zazie again for a consistent and hearty brunch. However, since there doesn't seem to be a time when the crowd ever dwindles, I'd much rather frequent Mama's, Lime, or Foreign Cinema for a more memorable brunch.", "author": "Vivian D."}

We went there with a party of 4 around 1:00pm on a Friday and we got seated right away which was really promising - until we looked at the menu. EVERYTHING was over-priced. \n\nI've been wanting to cut back on the carbs so I opted for a side of 2 eggs and chicken apple sausage (rather than getting the $12 egg platter with toast and home fries). The eggs were $3 (FOR TWO!) and the sausage was $4.50. (Typically chicken apple sausage is more expensive, and I totally get that because I love it and I think it's worth it) \n\nWhen I got my two side dishes I noticed that instead of one large chicken apple sausage link - like they are at EVERY OTHER PLACE IN THE WORLD - I received two small sausages that tasted nothing of chicken or apple and more like a standard italian sausage. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it so I brushed it off and was hoping that they wouldn't charge me the $4.50 and would adjust the price for a standard sausage side. \n\nThe whole time I was eating my scrambled eggs and sausage (which cost me $7.50 + a $1.25 401(k) charge for the employees/person) I kept thinking to myself, \"I could probably 3 of these orders at some sweet family-run breakfast spot somewhere else and the quality would be just the same.\"\n\nOthers in my party got a veggie egg platter and the polenta with egg and pasta sauce (???) special... All of their dishes were SUB PAR. \n\nWhen the bill came I let one of the waiters know about the sausages and he rudely snaps back, \"You must have gotten chicken apple sausage. It's the only sausage we have.\" I was very taken aback by this and I was so fed up with the whole restaurant I just paid the bill and quickly left. I didn't want anything more to do with this terrible restaurant. \n\nBottom line: I wouldn't go here unless you're in the mood for bland, pricey food and servers who think that they're too good to serve you.", "author": "Tiffany M."}

The benedict was fresh and full of flavor.\nThe outdoor eating area is a really nice atmosphere as well!\nI would say I would love to come back soon but I don't live in SF and if I were to come back to the city I would try something else, but if you happen to be in the area and are looking for a place for a good breakfast/brunch, I recommend Zazie!", "author": "Josephine T."}

I used to love coming here but after having bad experiences 3 times I can no longer risk another cold breakfast or scraping of the end of the pan potatoes.  Also if the waiters hungry don't eat in front of customers , I understand we all got to eat but if I'm waiting for my food for more than 20 min and I see your food come out before mine and then watch you eat it while I'm starving I'm going to be pissed . Please The waiter didn't even acknowledge us or ask whether the food was fine or apologetic for the food being cold or taking forever. Ever since the no tip started is when I noticed the change . Theirs some old staff still there and they are very attentive . Ever since the no tipping started is when this place went down. Personally I like to tip .

I mean, eggs are... eggs.  That said, however, I really enjoyed Zazie.  It was a beautiful day (yes, in SF!), and my friend and I waited about 45 minutes for a seat outside on the back patio.  It was well worth it, and the host was very nice about keeping us updated and offering an indoor table earlier in case we wanted it.  \n\nWe were very hungry when we finally sat down, and decided to share two of the poached egg dishes - the St. Trop with smoked salmon and the Florentine with spinach and portobello mushrooms.  I had never had salmon with eggs before, and was a bit nervous.  I needn't have worried, as this is now one of my favorite combinations and has completely reshaped how I view brunch.  The lox was cut into tiny pieces so there were no issues with it getting caught in your teeth or accidentally getting a giant piece all at once.  The lemon hollandaise sauce was, as Zazie's menu describes, light and delicious and not at all overpowering.  The Florentine tasted like a normal omelet, but didn't have any of the wonderful flavors of the St. Trop.  I wish there had been some tomatoes or something a little bit sweeter to offset the earthy mushroom and spinach combination.\n\nMy only complaint is that the server refilled my friend's coffee once (I wasn't ready yet), but then never returned so I only had one cup.

The server was patient and answered all of our questions.  \n\nI cross-checked Yelp and their menu, and decided on the Un, Deux, Trois, which consists of \"One buttermilk pancake, two eggs, and three strips of bacon\". To try everyone's recommendations, I subsituted the buttermilk pancake for the French Toast Tahiti (for an additional $3), and had the poached eggs. \n\nThe french toast is amazing - I love that walnut spread. The bacon was also done to perfection. The poached eggs felt slightly out of place. \n\nNote that there was a line the moment the place opened on Sunday morning, so definitely expect a wait.

But, being San Francisco, that should not have surprised me in any way. \n\n20 million Stars to the Staff for being kind, courteous and understanding that we were going to be late for our reservation. Yes we called, but could only give a estimated time frame of how late we would be as there was road work everywhere slowing us down. When I realized that I was going to have to go blocks farther out to look for parking, I texted my daughter as I knew what I wanted, so she could order for me and not slow down our already late appearance. \n*Remember, Saturday night, everyone is home and parking may be a bit of a problem. I don't mind walking, and found something about 6 blocks away. \n\nNow for the food. Awesome, Amazing, as Good as I thought it would be. Oh my God, can I lick the plate? They will bring out as many of those rolls to wipe your plate clean if you want. \n\n3 of us had the Prix Fix dinners. Good choice as then we could taste each other food. And that we did. My entree of the Fish Soup Provencale was to die for. The soup had just the right amount of soup, and the fish was very tender and I love mussels, so it all was just wonderful. \nMy daughter had the Grilled Mascarpone Polenta cakes with vegetables. It also was great. I love polenta, being Italian, am fairly snobby about polenta. \n\nAfter chatting a bit with the server, I asked to pick me out a wine to go with my dinner, and he was spot on! I got the Andre Vatan \"Les Charms\" Sauvignon Blanc - Sancerre. My daughter got the champagne, Domaine la Grangette Picpoul de Pinet - Languedoc. All French. \n\nWe had 3 choices of dessert. All were wonderful. Creme Brulee, Petit Pot de Creme au Chocolate and the fresh fruit crumble with creme fraiche, which tonight was Strawberry and Rubarb. I also asked for the Vanilla Gelato for 2.00 more. \n\nI have to say that Zazie will be added to my list of favorites when I come into San Francisco. The parking will not detour me to have some of the best French/Californian food I've had since being in France many years ago. I love the California twist, which is why I stated French/Californian. \n\nThank you Zazie for for the wonderful dining experience that we could share with a couple of 16 year olds, that good food is very important to ones palette.", "author": "Sara C."}

Now I wouldn't usually spend $9 on lemonade, but this was actually REALLY good, and I'd consider getting it again (though I might just go with one glass for $3...good enough).  It was again light, sweet and lemony (apparently the theme of my meal!), and not at all sour or pucker-worthy, as some lemonades are.

I mean, I'm sort of a pancake connoisseur and thank goodness I ordered a side of Banana-Walnut stuffed French Toast as well as the Ginger Poached Pear Pancakes with my Croque Madame . Wasn't so much a fan of the mushy brown gunk (walnut mash) in the french toast except when covered in raspberry preserves; but with a generous portion of those preserves I could've eaten my napkin too.

I took off a star for bad service, 1 for stingy portions, and minus 1/2 for false advertising on the corn cakes). \n\nWhen I arrived, a waitress immediately told me that the patio was full and to get on the waiting list.  As soon as I put my name down, the host walked up to me and escorted us to the back patio where there were 5 empty tables.  It wasn't a big deal but the waitress should have double checked before telling me that there were no tables available.  Let's just say she set the tone for the entire experience.  \n\nThe food had hits and misses.  I ordered the St. Trop Benedict with wild smoked salmon, capers, and onion on an English muffin.  The egg was poached just the way how I like my eggs, with the yolk still runny.   While the portion was enough for my small appetite, it was really really really small compared to the Benedict I've had elsewhere.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gqVl3RprESEqkIPeJH0yOg?select=oDWEBuBPPpq4a8sGEt9Jdg\n\nMy friend didn't enjoy the Eggs en Fonte at all.  The ingredients in the dish sounded delicious but it was poorly made.  It was supposed to be housemade sweet corn cakes topped with 2 fried eggs, avocados, salsa fresca, and sour cream that was baked in an iron skillet.  The corn cakes were nowhere to be found.  The order came out with 2 over easy runny eggs and not the medium done eggs that he requested.  There was too much salsa on it.  The whole thing was mushy and runny like soup.

I'd stopped in a couple of months ago for lunch and was sorely disappointed. So it was with a little trepidation that I returned for breakfast here a couple of weeks ago. I'm happy to say, though, that I was pleasantly surprised at how good breakfast was--we had a tasty breakfast and great service here. \n\nI ordered the gingerbread pancakes, topped with roasted pears and lemon curd. They were mighty tasty, but just a couple stops short of great. The pancakes were a little dry, honestly, but had a nice spicy gingerbread flavor. They needed more of Zazie's delicious lemon curd to balance out the dry texture of the pancakes. The pears on top were a great addition, but I would have appreciated more pears, sliced thinner and cooked more tender. And look out--this is a pretty heavy dish. Even with just two pancakes to an order, I was stuffed just halfway through my plate. \n\nMy dining companions were likewise satisfied with their meals. The eggs Benedict with Dungeness crab was a favorite, and the eggs over polenta also got a thumbs up. We decided to split an order of the orange French toast. It was good, but didn't wow any of us.\n\nOur service was very attentive and very friendly. We were seated outside and it was packed inside, not to mention we were a table of five. Despite this, our server never missed a beat--he stopped by our table regularly to make sure things were going OK and he brought out our food in a jiffy. \n\nAfter breakfast here at Zazie the other day, I'd definitely come back. I'm glad I gave Zazie a second chance. It wasn't the best breakfast I'd ever had, but it was certainly mighty tasty.\n\nAnd here's a tip--Zazie can get pretty crowded inside with a long wait list to get a table, but the two tables just out front are apparently free for the taking first come, first served, so snag one if you can.

It took over an hour to get us seated (2 people) and should have been more like 30 minutes.  I love the concept of the staff being paid well and taken care of so you don't have to tip (it's already included in the menu pricing).  The problem was the staff was slow and not motivated like a regular restaurant where getting tables in and out result in more money for the staff.  Things just took way too long and no sense of urgency.  Many times the servers were just chilling at the counter, often just talking or playing on their phone.  It took a long time after we were seated to get a server to take our order.  Also, coffee wasn't refilled.  The gingerbread pancakes were good.  The lobster benedict was average at best.  One egg was already broken when my dish arrived.  There was very little lobster meat (mostly claw, no tail meat) for the price ($28).  It's also ridiculous that there's only 1 single bathroom for the whole place.  We had to wait in a line of 6 people to use it.  Are you kidding?\nOverall, things moved slow in this place and we waited for everything.  Decent food but get it together and pick up the pace.", "author": "love n."}

Here it goes -\n\nMy buddies live up the street from Zazie and have reluctantly passed on going there weekend after weekend due to the intimidating crowd of people standing outside waiting for a table.  I finally made the executive decision to put our name down since we had heard nothing but great things about their food and I was DYING to try it.  You manually write your name down outside of the restaurant and do your own \"how long is the wait?\" calculation.  Roughly 3 mins/every name above yours for groups less than 5.  Estimate 5 mins for groups of 5+ (I think that's what it was).  We had a handful of people ahead of us (~45 minutes) so we put our names down and went back to the apartment.\n\nWe came back in perfect time to be seated up front against the glass in the corner.  Didn't notice until we sat down that they had a nice patio out back which I think I would rather wait for next time. The waitress, who was awesome but i unfortunately forgot her name, took down our drink order (3 bloody mary's, 1 drake's IPA, 1 mimosas and a shit ton of waters -- rough night the night before).  The bloody mary was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.  But wow, I can't stop dreaming about their heavenly food.\n\nThey had a large brunch menu with tons of options..

For people living in the city, parking is not an issue as this restaurant is very close to an N Judah stop.  For those coming in from out of town, you may need to drive around for a while to find a decent parking spot.  Be prepared to walk a few blocks.\n\nIf you are super fortunate (i.e., you arrive with perfect timing and the SF weather is actually nice) and a table out front is available, you can just sit down and avoid the long wait.  Otherwise, you put your name on a paper list on a clipboard attached to the glass window and wait for your name to be called.  There are not many places to sit while you wait unless you're okay sitting on a large wooden planter, and if the fog is gone, you may have the sun right in your face the entire time, so be sure to have sunglasses handy.  Do not stray too far away, because they will not call your name for very long before giving up on you and moving on to the next guests on the list.  You also will not be seated until your entire party is present.\n\nOnce you get inside, you will learn that the food is well worth the wait.  It is a bit cramped and noisy, but that's part of the restaurant's charm.  Zazie makes it clear on their menu that they allow absolutely no substitutions, but you'll discover that it really won't cramp your style, as they have tons of great choices.  I've had the french toast with banana and walnuts which was incredible and I've also had a poached egg dish with eggplant.  The home fries are delicious.  My friend got the dish with a buttermilk pancake, a gingerbread pancake, and a slice of french toast.  She said it was really really good, too.  The food comes out super fast and the server staff is very friendly.\n\nBoth times we've come here, we ordered the table build-your-own mimosa kit.  Be aware (as we weren't told this the first time by the staff or didn't read the menu close enough) that you are entitled to 2 juice choices with the order.  Based on my personal preference, I would like them to serve more juice with the champagne so that I can make my mimosas a little bit weaker without hogging all of the juice for the entire table.  Being able to get 2 mini-pitchers of juice does help with this predicament, though.\n\nThe restroom is located in the back of the restaurant and the waiting area is in a hallway that is the only exit to the patio seating so be prepared to squeeze to the side to let the servers in and out.  Also, be careful if you decide to stand directly across from the bathroom door because you will likely turn on/off up to 4 wall power switches which are unfortunately located right in this area.  The bathroom was clean, although I couldn't find seat covers.", "author": "Danielle P."}

The entire atmosphere is delightful, relaxed, cozy, with great service and a knockout French menu. Their portions are quite ample and I always have to take home half of my entree.   I don't ever remember eating such good French onion soup outside of Paris.  The cheese spills over the side of their traditional brown soup bowls and the crouton is yummy.  Everything is piping hot and flavorful.   Their couscous/lamb is complex and delicious and occasionally they offer Lapin au Moutarde (Rabbit in Mustard Sauce, a Provencal speciality) and it is incredible.  We recently tried a lemon mousse with raspberry sauce and it was a beautiful balance of sweet/tart.  My husband had their eggplant soup and it was wonderful too.  I recommend the 5 p.m. seating because at that time  we have had no problem parking.  Later it gets more difficult.  There is no tipping; the waitstaff is compensated by the owners and included in the price of the food and from what I hear employee benefits are very ample and, IMHOP, well deserved.", "author": "Renna U."}

Despite it being super early (in my opinion) for brunch, there was already a big crowd outside of the place, and I put our name on the list.  The host told us it would be a 20-minute wait, at least, which wasn't too bad since there's enough stores in the area for good window-shopping while you're waiting.  \n\nAfter a quick stroll around the neighborhood, we finally got our table (the wait was maybe about 30 minutes - not too bad compared to some of the other popular brunch places in the City where brunch waiting times can reach 2 hours).  We went indoors, and Lindsay and I immediately started snapping pictures of everything.  The decor was adorable - cute French paintings/posters all along the walls.  The whole place was bright, happy, and quaint.  I dig.  Add a star for the decor/environment.  \n\nThe menu is extensive, and everything sounds delicious.  I opted for the Fontainebleau, which was basically scrambled eggs with tons of different types of mushroom (porcini, shitake, and something else I can't remember), basil (my FAVRIT!), and fontina.  The dish came with a side of toast, and your choice of home fries or a salad.  I opted for the home fries after reading the Yelp reviews glorifying them.  \n\nThe whole dish was alright.  My eggs were kind of on the blander side, and those home fries were total greasebombs!  It was like each bite that I took squeezed a tablespoon of oil into my mouth while also leaving a puddle of oil on my plate.  Oh man, that amount of oil was not necessary!  It actually made me feel pretty sick afterward...but at least it was tasty enough.\n\nI was telling myself that place was a 3.75 while I was eating, but now that I think about it, it's more of a 3.5, rounded down.  Rounded down because it's too expensive for what it is.  That egg dish was something like $11.  Ouch.\n\nMaaaaybe I'll be back in the future, because the area and the ambiance is pretty nice.

I asked for hot sauce or Tabasco for the scramble, and they came back with a small jar of the homemade stuff. Awesome. I almost wanted to drink it straight up. The home fries are awesomely exceptional. Each serving is complemented by cloves of roasted garlic. I've had many a home fries in my days around the country and these are simply the best I've ever had.

We managed parking on one of the neighborhood streets a block away but there were plenty of prime spots along Cole that opened up.  \n\nI really enjoyed the quaint farmhouse-y vibe that Zazie had.  It was simple but still homey, welcoming and just a happy place.  I think I say this because of the pale yellow walls but I stand by it.  Service was quick, efficient and friendly.  As we were starving we ordered immediately upon sitting down.  I ordered the Un, deux, trois - slice of french toast, bacon and eggs.  My boyfriend ordered the special omelet - pesto, chicken apple sausage, cheddar cheese, mushrooms, and something else that I can't remember.   Both were exceptionally good; there wasn't even a spec of food left on either plate.  \n\nI'm really glad that we came to Cole Valley to try our Zazie's.

There is a decent amount of seating indoors and outdoors in the back but when I came, they seem to be all filled as well as people outside waiting eagerly to get in.  If it's worth mentioning, their customer service is superb.  They have someone out there talking to you personally to let you know the status of the wait, as well as making small talk to make it more bearable.  But it doesn't end there, they come around often enough to make sure everything is fine when you're eating and constantly fill your glasses of water/coffee.\n\nI got the Albert with one poached egg served with bacon, white cheddar, and homemade salsa fresca on top of an English muffin with hollindase sauce along with a choice of a salad or fries (country style potatoes) as a side.  The hollindase is delicious, not over the top creamy to allow the other toppings show off their flavor but good enough to have just on the muffin alone.  This place didn't disappoint and hours after eating it I was still complimenting my friend for a good brunch pick.\n\nThe salad was nothing special, I got it because I thought it would be french fries but had I known it was country style potatoes, I would have gotten that instead.  My friend, which did order the fries, were half and half on how they felt.  Some didn't like the abundance of garlic (the garlic was still shelled too) while others enjoyed the garlic.  They give a pretty fair ratio of garlic and potatoes so if you're not a fan of garlic, I'd probably stay away.  \n\nAnd being brunch, my friends were expecting free refills with coffee, which were granted without asking.  Awesome.  I didn't leave gut busting full but I did leave very content with the food hitting the spot.  I mean brunch shouldn't put you to sleep anyway.

I do spy a handful of bandwagon fans but hey, they're a dime a dozen, and Zazie is pretty chill, lovely, and yummy all around.\n\nIt really is a cozy, accommodating cafe.  I emphasize accommodating because my friend and I wandered in at 2:50pm, and the kitchen was doing last call for orders at 3pm.  Our server was totally chill about it, and offered that we please take our time.  That patience alone prompted me to add my voice to the 2000+ Yelp voices for this business.\n\nBEVERAGES: my friend had the house coffee, which was a welcome cup on a windy, chilly June afternoon.  I had the VANILLA ROOIBOS tea.  I was wondering why it was priced so high, but I realize it pays for the portion, as I was given a full pot of delicious, delicious tea.  There was something so sophisticated about that vanilla edge to a typically low-bitters, calming tea.\n\nFOOD: my friend had the soup du jour (ALWAYS VEGETARIAN), which was a CREAM OF MUSHROOM that day.  Very home-y, comfort food.  The bowl was smaller than she expected, but it ended up being a very good, appropriate portion.  She also had EGGS ANY STYLE WITH BACON, A SALAD, AND WHITE TOAST.  She actually ordered only one egg, scrambled, and the portion looked gigantic, as if it were two eggs really.  Seasoned and fluffed well nonetheless.  It was a very generous plate of food, and she didn't finish all the bread.  I went for the CHALLAH FRENCH TOAST, two slices, no fruit.  It was sliced quite beautifully.  Now I'm a French Toast purist, so while my order was cooked well, I believed the slices were a bit airy and I felt it wasn't as moist as other orders I've had elsewhere.  I had to add much more syrup than I typically would.  The flavor was just the right amount of sweet without said syrup, so with a tad more moisture, this dish would have been more phenomenal.\n\nQuick tip: if there's a line for the restroom, you are welcome to just wander into the bar next door.  One of the employees was laidback and laughed \"Oh yea, I do that all the time.  They don't mind, so feel free to skip on over.\"", "author": "Allison C."}

Zazie doesn't usually host the ceremony (just the reception), but they worked incredibly hard to make it a great event.\n\nHere's the condensed story:  Our first venue/caterer fell through.  We found ourselves looking for a new venue late in May with a wedding date of mid-October.  We had under 5 months to start from scratch with a limited budget.\n\nWe needed somebody to step up and that's what the folks at Zazie did.  We contacted Jen about buying out Zazie for our event and she got back to us the next day.  After working through the initial details, Suhail took over and helped us through the rest of the process.  I want to emphasize here that up to this point, we had not dealt with anybody in the wedding industry as responsive and capable as Jen and Suhail.  Committing to Zazie as our venue was a no brainer.  They helped us get back on track.\n\nA couple months before our event, Suhail began working through the specifics with us.  He suggested Loop Flowers & Event Arts for decorations, which proved to be a great recommendation.  In addition to helping us select great food and drinks, Suhail really helped us think through the entire event with regards to timing, transitions, and all the details (sound system, procession logistics, etc.).  For example, I have this one email chain between us and Suhail that was almost 50 messages long.  He remained calm and organized throughout the planning process.\n\nWe used the patio for the ceremony, which required the removal of almost all the tables back there.  In coordination with Loop, Suhail and his crew turned the patio into a beautiful, intimate space for our ceremony.  After that, we all went inside while they converted it back into seating for dinner.  They even returned all of the table runners and decorations to their proper positions.  It was an incredible amount of work and they clearly went above and beyond.\n\nIn addition to the coordination and logistical help, the day-of service was excellent.  Our guest count and the sheer volume of food we ordered (appetizers, 3 courses with sides, desserts) must have pushed their kitchen to its limits, and yet each plate was perfectly done.  Several guests remarked at length about how nice and attentive the staff were, not to mention how mind-blowingly excellent the food was.  Event the foodies in our group were completely satisfied.\n\nSuhail was there the whole time, checking in with us to see if we needed anything.  We got so much more from him and the rest of the super-friendly Zazie staff than we expected.  Because of them, our wedding was a complete success.  Thank you!", "author": "John G."}

The city's human species set out on a mass migration that will take them out from their 750 sq ft. apartments to fill the restaurants and bars that offer what the majority of San Franciscans only can dream of; a back patio. It's a migration with high risk and equal reward, one of probable long waits, and the chance to bask in the golden rays within the city of the golden gate. There may be no better place to migrate to than Zazie. They offer one of the best patio experiences in the city. It's lush, shaded, sunny, spacious, comfortable and adds the perfect touch of umami to your dinning experience. This morning we left our humble abode to set out and enjoy our breakfast Zazie patio style:\n \nThe Le Mer with poached eggs oozing with yoke and fresh hand picked dungeness crab made me wonder if their chefs moonlight as crab fisherman by early morning. The Fontainebleau scramble with portobellos, shiitake, porcinis and spinach was earthy and well balanced. Their Housemade Cream Cheese Coffee Cake, the best coffee cake since the creation of coffee cake, had us eyeing the cake on the table next to us with the kind of jealousy you might not find in someone who just finished their own generous serving of coffee cake. That's how good!\n\nWe have been to Zazie countless times. Always impressed, including everyone visiting who we brought along. There will be a wait and it will always be worth it. You can request the patio, this may add to the wait, but as the city's migration proves, this is the experience you want to have. Today we arrived before they opened, vied for position and found ourselves 3rd on the list. When we walked out, full, happy and patiofied, 20 fellow migrants waited their turn.", "author": "Michael R."}

I expected better from this place reading the reviews on yelp. \n\nDon't be tricked into thinking it's worth your time especially if you are just traveling through San Francisco. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were traveling up from L.A. and San Fran was our last stop. We only spent a day and night there so we made sure where we were going was good. I want this place to be good, but it's not and here's why:\n\n1. It's way too busy (over an hour wait for table of two) not only is the wait bad, the service is slow because there are just too many people. 1 star.\n\n2. The food is NOT that good. It's a high class price for worse than diner food. Runny omelette, watered down coffee, and a poorly dressed salad is not worth the price.   The crab Benedict was fair. 2 stars.\n\n3. The ambiance was okay, just way too busy and crowded for the type of food I was offered. I like that the walls are painted and covered with French paintings and pictures, but it doesn't make up for my awful experience. 3 stars.\n\nThe reason I give it an overall of 1 star: the WORST part was that I went to the bathroom as my boyfriend stepped outside for some air and when we came back, everything was cleared. His beer was gone and my food was gone. I have never left a bad tip, but this time I left a 5.00$ tip on 55.00 tab. \n\nThe waiter was too busy to realize that I had gone to the restroom and didn't tell the bussers. I had even left my purse and jacket there!!! When I returned, a man was sitting in my seat where my belongings were.

From the perfect roasting in their house fries to impeccable poaching of their eggs, they are a master of their craft. The challah French toast is a revelation. It's lightly battered to perfection with hints of cinnamon and orange. Their croque monsieurs are one of the best in the city. The \"Albert\" with it's poached eggs, bacon, white cheddar and pico de gallo is such a flavorful combination of flavors.\n\nService: While the service here is always polite and courteous, it can be a bit slow or forgetful at times.

Obviously, it's difficult to go wrong with this classic and they did it decently.  I was expecting the poach to be a bit runnier though.  The home fries were good as well, nicely seasoned but they left chunks of garlic in the potatoes which look like the potatoes at a quick glance which I think they should remove before serving.  Servers were good despite how busy it was.

The Cole Valley restaurant is small, quaint and charming.  On a Monday afternoon, it was packed and we had about a 20 minute wait for a table.  Despite how busy the place was, once seated in the front dining room, we were immediately greeted by a very nice waiter and brought menus and water.  I can't even tell you how difficult it was to decide what to order.  Everything on the menu was tempting.  I haven't been faced with such a delicious-sounding menu in quite some time.  I finally decided upon a lunch special, the lemon ricotta ravioli.\n\nThe five good-sized ravioli were served in a large bowl, swimming in a lemon butter sauce.  Ridiculously, ridiculously good.  The kind of good where you close your eyes and say \"Mmmmmmmm!\"  The kind of good where you stop talking to your lunch companion because you can't focus on anything but how delicious the food is.  Good.  My friend had the burger with garlic fries (whole bulbs of roasted garlic included) and was similarly enraptured.  Believe me, I am already planning my return visit for another date with those ravioli.\n\nService was excellent throughout the meal.  I've worked in restaurants and know how hard it is to stay cheerful when your tables are slammed.  Our waiter was friendly as can be.  On the way out, I decided to purchase some of Zazie's gingerbread pancake mix.  I can't wait to try it out this weekend.\n\n**update: the gingerbread pancakes are RIDICULOUS.  Best pancakes ever.

I love the high ceilings and that stairwell in the middle of the room. I saw the back garden area and thought it was super cute. \n\nWe started out with an aperitif.. Le Metro. Oh I highly recommend this!! Delicious and bubbly. \nFor appetizer I had the Pat\u00e8 de Volaille (chicken liver). They buttered the bread so generously and the pat\u00e8 spread on top.. perfection! Yum yum. My partner had the French Onion Soup which he thought was the best he's had. We also shared the Mac n Cheese.. tr\u00e8s cheesy!! Oh so good. For main I had the Lamb Tagine.. another perfect dish. My partner commented how it tasted better than any Mediterranean place we've eaten at! It was served over couscous. The lamb was so tender and tasty. The sauce divine. I very highly recommend this dish! My partner had the Grilled Mascarpone Polenta Cakes. Is it too much to describe this as yet another perfect dish? If you're vegetarian this is for you. I thought it tasted so amazing, and surprisingly filling. Oh and we did share a half bottle of Malbec so we were all sorts of happy LOL. To top off the decadent evening we shared baked chocolate in a huge cup topped with golden marshmallow.

Cute decor, check. Laid back, happy staff, check. Backyard patio, check. That's great, if that's your bag, but if you're more concerned with food than ambiance, then read on.\n\nI went to Zazie twice in one week - quite the feat considering the lines that metastasize into existence on the sidewalk outside during the weekend, but fortunately I live close by and had the week off, and so was able to take advantage of my circumstances. \n\nThe eggs were highly touted, so on my virgin run I ordered a dish with poached eggs, bacon, avocado and hollandaise sauce on bread. This was totally fine, but really nothing special. If there were something more to it I'd be happy to go into more detail - really. I tend to avoid reading reviews without details because they don't communicate anything worthwhile - but that was it. It's not as though the eggs were so fantastic to be worth crowing about.\n\nBut then again, eggs are eggs, and it's tough to stand out with them, so I figured I'd go back once more and try something that could stand out, like, say, pancakes. A couple buttermilk pancakes with fresh fruit later and all I can say is that I was just as nonplussed as before. The pancakes are honestly no better than I could get at any old greasy spoon or diner anywhere in the country.\n\nI realize it sounds like I'm ragging on Zazie, which I don't mean to do, only on the hype around it. There's nothing wrong with the food - except the prices: hello frou frou!

Explanation:\n\nThe food: We started with a piping hot plain roll and a smear of butter- a really good omen for the meal. Then, onto the appetizer of figs on a garlic levain with chevre and wilted arugula- the figs were halved and pan seared or something that got them to have this jewel like, shimmering texture. soooo good! but it got even better- my mom's duck leg with fingerling potatoes had a delicious mustard cream sauce, and my pork chop with mint and pine nut cous cous, roasted chard, and a rosemary skewer of figs was seriously delicious. the pork was 98% cooked through so that it was so incredibly succulent and delicious...i was seriously surprised by the top notch dinner we had here.\n\nThe good: Zazie's, even at the mediocre brunch I had, pays great attention to the little things. There are congenial little signs like \"please no substitutions, we're trying our best!\" and even the little tray the check came on was painted in a French cottage esque manner.  The food has no hurried, plate and go kind of mannerism- instead it has an attentiveness to it that makes the presentation beautiful and the food absolutely yummy.\n\nThe bad: This is not a quick dinner place. My mom and I loitered for 2 + hours, chatting over our glasses of water- maybe a glass of wine would have functioned better here. That said, the slowness seems intentional to showcase the food.\n\nAmbiance: cozy French and American fusion cafe \n\nGood for: DINNER, maybe I'll give brunch another try some other time.\n\nIn short: Affordable gourmet French food.

My recommendation is to go as early as you can manage to crawl out of bed.\n\nHowever, after 3 visits, I can easily say waiting for brunch is worth it every time. The beaufriend and I eat there every time I'm in SF, and it's a quick walk from the Haight St area. To be honest, I'd travel to get here.\n\nAs a vegetarian I haven't strayed from what I ate the first time: eggs florentine and skillet potatoes. The hollandaise is easily the best I've ever had. Just the right amount of lemon, and not heavy. The waiter brought us more upon request the last time we ate there. \n\nMy companion always gets one of the styles of eggs \"benedict\" and always asks for avocado on top. They always oblige, even though the menu says they don't accommodate substitutions. \n\nThe last time we went, we ordered 2 slides of the French Toast Tahiti, made with challah, supposedly from some bakery nearby though I'm not sure which. When we went around Thanksgiving, they were completely out of the challah for the weekend, so it was disappointing they hadn't planned ahead for the bakery's closing for the holiday.\n\nThe organic coffee is great, but I wish they would provide soy milk for creamer (at least ask ahead of time). \n\nThe host (always the same guy in a zip-up athletic jacket every time I've been there) plays favorites. He'll let his friends (?) in when they're much farther down the list. Also, he once seated the two of us at a booth for 4. I even told him we didn't mind waiting for a small table so that a larger group could use the space, but he shrugged and walked away. The service also was pretty poor the last time we were there.\n\nAlso, it's a bit small, so be prepared to overhear everything everyone says in here, even out on the patio (which is charming enough to make me forget I'm 18 inches from the loud-talking girl next to me). \n\nHonestly, none of the complaints are enough to stop me from going back again.

You want brunch? The key here is to get here as early as you can. The line starts getting pretty crazy around 11 AM. You need to put your name on a list at the front door. The alternative would be to ferociously battle other patrons for the two outside tables in the front which are first come first serve. However, you will have to sit through an awkward brunch where dozens of hungry eyes (dog eyes included) will be staring at you throughout the meal.\n\nThe eggs benedict here are great. The eggs are poached perfectly. I got the Albert, which consists of bacon and salsa fresca, with poached egg, all topped on a perfectly toasted english muffin. Do get the home potatoes. They are deliciously roasted with garlic cloves and herbs. My friend ordered the florentine, which is the poached egg with sauteed spinach and wild mushroom. Both were epic and tasty.\n\nEnjoy a cup of coffee or a cocktail with your meal. The service was extremely friendly and prompt. The only \"complaint\" is that the seating in the backyard patio is pretty cramped, so you are in prime position to eavesdrop or be eavesdropped on by your dining neighbors.

Mediocrity prevailed its little head.\n\nI didn't want to believe it, but it was bad plate after bad plate. First of all, they were out of the chicken livers, which was not a problem. So, we ordered old faithful, the charcuterie plate. We were told they were out of the pate and would add more of the other ingredients but I've had that so many times, that the portions were no bigger than normal. And to top that off with that dish, they didn't offer us the usual toasted brioche and instead gave me breakfast toast as if I wouldn't notice! I didn't even say anything, but my friend who's never even been there knew that this dish just wasn't right.\n\nI think they were waiting for us to finish our appetizers bc one we were done with the last bite, they immediately took our plates and gave us our entrees which must have been sitting around bc they definitely were lukewarm at best. \n\nMy salmon en papillote was overcooked and her braised beef shanks were dry. I was truly disappointed, especially when I told her this was one of my favorite restaurants!\n\nFor desserts, I ordred the fruit crumble of the day with gelato. At least that was good. She had the duo of creme, creme brulee and pot de creme.

I love indulging in these with a good book in my hand, and the sunshine playing on my shoulders. And I don't want to share!\n\nIt's not just brunch. I've had dinner here plenty of times with friends and family and everyone loves it. I have sometimes made a dinner out of the small plates, rather than order an entr\u00e9e, just to try various things. The chicken liver pat\u00e9 is crazy indulgent and delicious. I nearly wept when the duck cassoulet was cycled out of their menu, but cheered up because it was replaced by some other yummy thing.\n\nOh--and Monday night is BYOD: Bring Your Own Dog. I love dogs and don't have any, so this is a real treat for me. People show up with their dogs in tow and there is a serious overload of Adorable. Or adograble, ho ho.\n\nNot everything is perfectly perfect; I've had a couple of desserts that I didn't care for, but they are exceptions rather than the rule.

A quick Yelp search for brunch places in or near Lower Haight led us to this JEWEL. As we were walking up Cole we noticed a mob of people and as we got closer we realized that those people were all waiting to get seated. We flipped through two pages, yes, TWO pages of people's names, and wrote ours down. \n\nYes! Bar next door! We wrote \"@ 'Finnegan's'\" next to our name on the Zazie list and walked next door. After a while we realized that most of the people inside were also waiting to be seated at Zazie. I noticed a lot of people drinking Bloody Marys and decided to order one myself. It was pretty dang good! A little spicy and it came with a pickled string bean.\n\nA few drinks later and we hear, \"Ethan party of 3!\" \n\nI'll fast forward to the food because that's what really matters in a Yelp review right? I got the Croque Madame and some Lavendar champagne drink and they were absolutely incredible. The service was impeccable, the outdoor patio area was adorable, and my friends and I had the best time ever. I recommend this place to all of my friends who come from out of town!", "author": "Lea N."}

Conveniently located right on the N line, it wasn't hard for an out-of-towner like myself to find.  When you arrive, you write your name down on the waiting list, and stand around for awhile.  I only had to wait about 20 minutes, and it was on a Saturday, so not too shabby.\n\nI was seated in the patio out back, which is a nice, quaint space that makes you forget you're in a really crowded city.  The weather was overcast, which might make a patio seat undesirable for some, but I'm from Phoenix, so cool and overcast is a nice change from the usual hot and sunny.\n\nI ordered the dungeness crab poached eggs, a side of bacon, and a glass of mango juice.  Doing so forced me to turn down such delicious-looking items as the Tahiti French Toast and the Gingerbread Pancakes, but seeing dungeness on a breakfast menu makes me swoon like a shallow teenage girl listening to a forgettable, soulless 1D tune.\n\nThe poached eggs were amazing.  It's basically a benedict, with bread, crab, avocado, runny eggs, and hollandaise, and maybe another ingredient or two I'm forgetting.  Turns out crab and avocado are a winning combination.\n\nThe side bacon was also perfect: crispy and flavorful.  The mango juice was mango juice.  The home fries were OK - I ate them all, but honestly, I had forgotten there were home fries until I saw someone's picture.\n\nAt $35 after tip, I wouldn't say this is the best breakfast deal, but it's money well spent.  The food is good enough to justify the occasional splurge, and you'll have a good time here as well.", "author": "Jeremy P."}

The place is small and quaint, the service is very friendly, and we had no trouble finding street parking. We tried a variety of dishes. The mussels and the duck were amazing, and I really enjoyed the soup of the day (carrot and ginger). Also, do try the hot chocolate dessert, it's quite a creation!\n\nMy main criticism is that they tried to do too much with their menu. There was a lot to choose from, and when it all arrived, we realized that many of the dishes had repeated components. For example, the trout came with half plate of salad, as did the burger, and we also ordered a salad appetizer to start. We didn't realize the first two dishes came with salad, and most of all, we were disappointed to find that it was the exact same salad on all three dishes. I realize it's a small restaurant, but as a suggestion, perhaps it might be better to have a smaller menu that is changed on a bi-weekly or monthly basis.", "author": "Laurent L."}

My favorite place to get french toast was this place in Monterey (yes the city) and every year (if we were lucky) my bf and I would drive 3 hours over there just to eat breakfast food.......NOW that we found Zazie's there will be no more driving long distances for good food.....Zazie's French Toast Tahiti is seriously THE BEST french toast I have ever tasted. It's the Pinkie's challah stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts. I was hesitant at first because I don't like nuts in my food, especially walnuts, however, when the dish came out, I could barely taste and didn't even notice the walnuts. The walnuts were actually a good compliment to the dish (in terms of texture).\n\nI also got to try the Fontainbleau (scramble eggs with portobellos, shiitake, porcinis, spinach, fontina). It was very light and fluffy without being too oily. Their home fries were excellent and not burnt like most places.\n\nI came here on a Friday afternoon around 11:00 and parking was easy to find and I didn't have to wait in line!

We went for Sunday Brunch.  The wait for a table was well over an hour, no reservations for Brunch, so you wait on the sidewalk with many others waiting for what has been billed by so many as a great French restaurant.\n\nFirst, the host is not friendly (he was not French - spoiler right off the bat).  He was very \"as a matter of a fact.\"  Must be nice to be so successful that you don't need to be respectful to your prospective guests (smile and have a little fun buddy, life can't be that bad).\n\nSecond, the Brunch menu is hardly French.  For the reputation, I had set my chops  for something very French and special.  What is that you say; \"no French onion soup on Sunday Brunch menu,\" are you kidding me?\n\nI had hoped for a plate of delicious French cheese, a light and flaky croissant with slices of fresh fruits.  Instead it was cold pancakes, cold eggs and cold bacon. Brunch for 5 $120 out the door.  No coffees, or other special drinks, mostly water at our table.  Oh yes; bring cash they do not take American Express cards.\n\nLots of rules like 'no substitutions because our staff is very busy and the kitchen is too small.'  Really?  Again; not about the guest but their staff instead.\n\nPlan on spending around a half hour looking for a parking space.\n\nThe server was very nice; but, clearly working too many tops for the demand.", "author": "Gary J."}

We would both get the two things on the menu we thought would be great and share them.  It worked out perfectly.  I got La Mer eggs benedict (3 total) and she got eggs benedict with bacon (2 total).  This was the ideal situation.  I got the best of both worlds.  The La Mer eggs benedict was great.  Perfect little English muffin with crab meat, a poached egg, avocado, and glorious Hollandaise sauce.  Life's good. Substitute the bacon for crab and you've got the other benedict.

The wait for me was about 15-30 minutes for an outside table, but I think that it was cuz I totally staked it out with my crutch and huge leg cast lol.  The servers were so sweet in accommodating me with an extra chair and I appreciate them for their help.  Parking here is a bust, so be prepared to make your rounds around the neighborhood.  \n\nThat being said, I wasn't thrilled with their food.  I had their french toast with fruit, and while it was good, it didn't blow me away.  The addition of fruit also cost me extra.  I tried my cousin's salmon plate, which was a lot better but one thing that I definitely have to praise is their mimosa!  It was so deeelic that I ordered 2 glasses of that nectar.", "author": "Mary N."}

First major plus: breakfast until 2:30 every day.\n\nMy partner and I stopped in on a Monday morning. Rustic and quant decor; I particularly like the spiral, wrought iron staircase to the right of the door (reminds me of Philly!). Interior is crowded despite the off time--about 11:10 or so--with only two recently-vacated tables available. We opt for the back patio seating (word?), which still sounds alluring despite a chilly, misty morning; we soon discover there are heat lamps, so this turns out to be an excellent move. We walk directly past the open dish station and kitchen to get outside: green wooden bench seating along the perimeter, rattan bistro chairs, green metal tables, wooden deck, greenery with flowers growing along the top of the property-dividing wall. Overall, excellent aesthetic outside.\n\nThe latte my partner ordered was enormous and served in a giant bowl-like apparatus. My coffee was on par and never dipped below half-full.\n\nWe order the Eggs Benedict Divorcee (special: bacon, avocado, fontina cheese) and the Eggs Benedict Monaco (proscuitto and tomatoes provencales): both dishes were cooked perfectly. The combinations of ingredients worked well, and the lemon flavor of the Hollandaise sauce complimented both dishes nicely, giving an added refreshing element to the meal. \n\nThe Lemon-Ricotta Pancake special definitely stole the show--one is definitely NOT enough, as we learned the hard way. Soft and springy, moist and plump, the creaminess of the ricotta was translated nicely into the finished product, with just the right amount of tang from Meyer lemon. A Meyer lemon and raspberry puree adorned the top of this fluffy treasure and finished the dish perfectly--skip the syrup!\n\n$1.25/guest surcharge ensures \"full benefits for our hardworking staff\n[including health insurance, dental insurance, and an employer funded 401(k)].\" This is a novel concept to me, but one about which I am ambivalent: why would you intentionally manifest to your guests the fact you are surcharging them? To show you are committed to employee welfare? Why not just build said benefits into the business plan?\n\nDespite this confounding surprise at the finish, I will definitely return to this neighborhood gem.", "author": "Justin M."}

The service was good and the food was AMAZING. I saw pictures and reviews about the pancakes and french toast and was dying to try them, but I didn't know there were like 5 different options! So lucky for me, there was the Sarah Janes Griddle Flight (or something like that) and it included \"sampler\" sizes of 1 buttermilk pancake, 1 gingerbread pancake, and 1 french toast! From the first to last bite, it was just a journey of yummy-ness. I think the buttermilk pancake was probably one of the best I've ever had. The gingerbread one was my least favorite but it was still good. I picked the french toast tahiti and I liked it a lot, but I wouldn't suggest it unless you really like bananas because they load that shit on. My friend got like the lox bagel and the dungeness crab benedict I believe. I only took a bite out of the benedict but it was enough for me to say that it was really good. Better than squat and gobbles, they actually used fresh crab meat here.. Anyways, our main dishes were incredible, but the shining star was the housemade cream cheese coffee cake! Every bite was perfection. It was warm and moist and the cream cheese just topped it off! The portion was huge too! I mean it was $7 but I guess we paid what it's worth. I couldn't stop eating it, so I definitely recommend getting that to start you off. Zazie's is one hell of a brunch place. No doubt am I coming back to try their other dishes!", "author": "Holly P."}

I can literally say this is the best brunch I've ever had.\nI ordered the Florentine poached eggs dish with 2 eggs and a side of fries. Delicious!\nLight, yet flavorful.

For beverages, we had the following mimosas: peach sorbet with currant, mango, and elderflower.\n\nThe poached eggs la mer had nice big chunks of crab meat with nicely poached eggs on top. \n\nThe omelette was fluffy and delicious.\n\nThe french toast was yummy as well, not too sweet, and the fresh fruit complemented the french toast well. Can't go wrong with freshly cut fruit!\n\nMimosas were great too! around $10 a piece, but they have a great deal where you can get a bottle of champagne and a pitcher of juice for like.. 20? 20something? We wanted to try different flavors so we opted out of that deal. I think my favorite was the mango mimosa, although the sorbet made me feel fancy haha. But you can add a scoop of peach sorbet to any mimosa for an additional charge. \n\nThe table next to us had a side of house potatoes with their dish, and the potatoes had big cloves of roasted garlic in it... and they smelled delicious... next time i shall have the potatoes...\n\nCute little cafe with delicious food.

Cole Valley is a bit out of my usual stomping grounds but I am so glad that I ventured out here! My friends and I came here after a recommendation from Sosh and it obviously the word has gotten out about the greatness of this gem because it was packed! The outside tables are first come first served so if you're sneaky enough you might not have to wait, for the amount of people that were waiting I was pleasantly surprised by the 25 minute wait on a Saturday for brunch. They have a pretty efficient system and multiple options of seating (inside, patio, and outside)\n\nI love the options of this restaurant also! You can choose how many of an item you get. So if you want a little bit of sweet and savory you can get a piece of their scrumptious stuffed french toast. And then get one poached egg la mer (poached egg with Dungeoness Crab, Avocado, and topped with light hollandaise sauce) The food was absolutely phenomenal. I can't wait to come back and try more!\n\nI can't recommend this restaurant more! This will definitely become a regular in the rotation!", "author": "Megan S."}

My partner and I managed to get in before the Friday lunch crowd with a 5-10 minute wait, which was pretty fantastic. With the numerous options of mimosas, it was a must to at least try one. We ordered the Sunshine and the Bourgogne, and they were so amazing. The Bourgogne was by far our favorite, and we were very glad our waiter recommended it when deciding between that and one on the specials list with coconut sorbet. \n\nIf you're unable to decide between which pancake or french toast option to choose from, the Sarah Jane Griddle Flight was fantastic. You could try them all! The original pancake was by far my favorite with its lightness and fluffiness that could absorb the syrup we poured. We also got the La Mer Poached Eggs, and that was equally delicious. It was well-balanced and cooked perfectly.  You could really enjoy the crab, muffins, eggs, avocado, and other ingredients. Best of all it wasn't oversalted, which  tends to happen with seafood brunch items at other establishments.\n\nI will definitely go back, and if they had bottomless mimosas, I'd never leave.", "author": "O L."}

About two months ago, I finally woke up earlier than usual and bused there for a brunch date. I mean it was a great day because there was no line and it was sunny, crazy. We were seated quickly and ordered the poached eggs with spinach and mushrooms and French toast Tahiti. It took awhile for the orders to come but it was okay because I got to have a nice talk in a nice place. And I understand that the kitchen is tiny and there are a lot of orders to make.  Both plates were amazing, the eggs were done perfectly and the French toast was just beautiful with the glazed banana and walnuts. The whole experience was flawless, including my visit to the bathroom. In this jam packed place, the bathroom is super tiny and the door and lock match this place very well. The door is a sliding door and the lock is only a hook. \n\nFood is TERRIFIC. Service is pretty good. Love the atmosphere and the bathroom is just omg.

They do take reservations and I used the \"Open Table\" app. All of reviews I see on Yelp are for brunch and a breakfast type of fare. This will be a dinner review.  The food was even better, my wife had the Trout dish and i had the French Provencal fish soup. Both were on the pre-fixe dinner list for $37.00 and it is a very good value. The pre-fixe dinner includes an appetizer, main course and desert.  All one needs, plus on Tuesday night you are encouraged to bring your own wine with no corkage fee. We brought a Bonny Doon wine, a eight year old Clos de Gilroy, it went well with the meal.  They were not familiar with Bonny Doon in spite of the fact Randall Graham the owner is in the Culinary Hall of fame, they seem to have a preference for french wines. Oh well. had the mussels for the appetizer and they were in a Garlic cream sauce that was the best part of the meal for me.  My wife's appetizer was the chicken pate with brandy sauce.  She said it the best she has had in a long time.  The main course the French Fish soup had a vegetable base to it, but it is filled with lots of salmon, mussels (more) and other fish.  Very good hearty fare,  Yet plenty of delicate flavors.   My wife's Trout was completely de-boned had a lemon butter sauce to die for.   To top it off, the Deserts were as good as the main courses.  My wife's Cream Broule was hard on top and wonderfully smooth on the inside, as it should be.   My Creme au Chocolate and very delicious not too sweet, just right a dark chocolate dish.  This restaurant has a no tipping policy, as according to their website their employees are well compensated including a medical and 401K plan.

My wife and I are frequent diners at Zazie and we can't seem to get enough of it.  The breakfast is incredible but the long waits can get a bit annoying, so we actually prefer to dine here for dinner (they take dinner reservations, not breakfast reservations).  The backside patio is awesome, they provide heaters and blankets if you are feeling a bit chilly, the atmosphere is really great and the menu is superb!  While they seem to keep some staple items on their menu at all times, quite a few of their dishes are changing frequently, which makes each experience a little more fun and exciting, and if it hasn't changed, we are usually just as excited because we know whatever we order will be fantastic.  We love the Tuesday night no corkage fee night, and it you can't come here on a Tuesday, I think their corkage fee is only $12, which is very reasonable and well worth it if you want to enjoy a quality bottle of wine that you have been saving at home with an incredible meal!  They also offer a quality wine list if you don't bring your own!\n\nDishes we love:\n\nAppetizer:  \nAssiette de Fromages - Cheese plate with all three cheeses and their figs, simply awesome, the toasted walnut levin that comes with it is perfect!\nSalade Louis Malle - We love the caramelized walnuts and gorgonzola on this salad, it's great!\nFrench Onion Soup Gratinee - I'm a huge fan of French onion soup, this one is good, but not the best I have ever had, the bread that comes on top of it could be a bit crispier.  But if you have a craving for French onion soup, go for it, you probably won't be disappointed, it gets the job done.\n\nDinner:  \nLamb Tagine - Awesome, I love this dish, it's new, and I hope it stays on their menu for awhile.\nTruite aux Noisettes - Broiled white trout with toasted hazelnuts is awesome, I love the salad that comes with it, it keeps it light and refreshing  \nThey recently offered a Rabbit dish that was delicious but I'm not sure if it still on their menu.\nTheir duck is usually great as well. \n I know everyone usually raves about the pork chop, I'm just not a pork chop kind of guy, I have tried it, but I wasn't blown away by it.\nThe grilled niman ranch hanger steak is good but definitely not the best hanger steak I have ever had, I would go with something else rather than the steak.\nThe Fish Soup Provencale is great too, definitely worth a try if you have a craving for fish soup!\nThey used to offer a beef shank dish served over vegetables and potato's that I loved!  Unfortunately this dish is no longer on the menu, but I'm hoping it will return sometime soon, it was GREAT!!\n\nDessert: \nBaked Chocolat Chau -We love the hot chocolate cake dessert, it's one of the best desserts we've had in a long time, and the melted marshmallows that come on top of it are awesome with just the right amount of crisp!!  Be careful though, the dish that it is served in is super hot!\nLes Deux Cremes - We love cr\u00e8me brule, this dessert offers a cr\u00e8me brule and a separate chocolate dessert as well that is great if you have the craving for both!\n\nLong story short, if you can't make it here for breakfast, definitely try it for dinner!

I have eaten many times here before and I feel that the service has gone down over time and now the food is mediocre. I requested my Pinot Noir by the glass to be freshly opened bottle. The waiter said he can not do that as there are too many bottles from last night that need to be finished first. I greatly appreciate this guy's honesty (instead of bringing me a one day old wine and telling me he just opened it). But I don't understand why it is so difficult to open a fresh bottle when the customer specifically requests it. The food was OK and wasn't worth a 20 minute wait. \n\nI like their brunches. I do not like their lunch food anymore.", "author": "bora o."}

This was the last meal nice meal I had in SF before our flight.  It was a Tuesday, so I figured it wasn't as crowded as a weekend, in which this place was packed.  We were able to secure a table outside in the sun, which was wonderful.\n\nThey have a unique brunch in which you can order how many eggs you want for your meal.  This gives you a chance to try different things, I guess.  They had a special eggs benefit with fresh crab, so I ordered two of those eggs.  My fiance went with only one of these eggs and then ordered the coffee cake.  He was feeling a little salty and sweet, I guess.\n\nThe server was super nice and took our order right away.  She was super busy so it was difficult for her to be fully attentive, but I could see she was trying.\n\nFood came out after a little bit and it was really delicious.

Either I forgot about this place after awhile or I didn't wanna drive, or ended up somewhere else but after finally trying this place out, I was not disappointed at all.   When you first walk into Zazie, the high ceilings caught my eye.  The workers there were very friendly and welcoming as my friend and I entered and although they were quite busy, we were seated immediately outside on the patio where we could enjoy the ambiance of the outdoors.   I looked at the menu and I must admit, it was quite pricy.   However, you definitely pay for the the quality.   I went with the St. Trop poached eggs which did not disappoint at all.   The eggs were perfectly cooked and there were just the right about of onions and salmon w/ capers.   Their homemade fries which are just garlic roasted potatoes added a filling touch to the meal.   My friend ordered the breakfast special which at the time was called La Mer which was what I got but instead of smoked salmon with onions, it was crab with avocado.   I had a bite and it was equally delicious.   Overall, I'm glad I tried this place.   I would have given them 5 stars but I'm not used to paying $15avg for breakfast but other than that, I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to try a good breakfast place =)  One thing I may add is that unless you live around the area, all of the parking is street parking and with a 30min limit.", "author": "Shelly W."}

They started making in house salsa but I wasn't the biggest fan (tomatillo sauce for those of you that like that) so I stuck with some tapatio.\n\nWe also shared the often reviewed French Toast Tahiti.

It's my favorite meal of the week, and Zazie does it right.\n\nCame here with my gal friend for the first time last week.  Wait was about 45 min.  Not terrible for Sat, but if you get impatient, good thing about Zazie is that it's in a neighborhood of many other brunch spots...so you can always give up and go dine elsewhere.  Considering the flower shops and boutiques around -- the wait can go by easy.   Tip: I think the two tables up front are exempt from the waiting list and are first come first serve! so if you dont mind grubbing in front of long lines of people staring out of jealousy...consider it.\n\nCoffees come in a big bowl -- just like I like it.  People seems to be ordering the French lemonade all around us, so will have to try that next time.  I ordered one of the week's special -- Procuitto Eggs Benedict ($12 for two).  You can pick between 1, 2, or 3 eggs ($9/$12/$15) -- what it actually means 1, 2, or 3 english muffins sandwiches.  So two was more than enough.  Comes with potatoes or salad too...so more than you can finish (see my pic!).  Procuitto was delish, and entired plate very savory.  \n\nI tried the French Toast Tahiti per everyone's recommendation ($6 for one).  Should've ordered it at the end, b/c it came with my benedict and by the time i took my first bite, it was a bit cold.  Perhaps that's the reason why, but I didnt think it was THAT amazing.

Of course, I had friends who had nothing but good things to say about it, so that sealed the deal for me. It was fate that we would meet!\n\nI came here with my Dad after an outing to the Academy of Sciences museum. On a Monday at noontime, we only had to wait 10 minutes or so. We grabbed a seat inside and pored over the impressive menu of breakfast, lunch and brunch items, as well as a separate menu for specials. I ordered a mango mimosa and he had an Anchor steam, then we dove into the real thing: the food.\n\nHe ordered the basic poached eggs with spinach and portabello mushrooms, paired with a salad. I opted for the less healthy, but much more savory, eggs de la mer special - eggs benedict with real dungeness crab, avocado and a light hollandaise. Delish! The hollandaise sauce is very delicate and not overbearing - just enough to highlight the richness of the poached eggs and bring out the flavor of the crab. Insanely good.

It's a small place, so the wait is fairly long. It may be better to get here a little early for parking and so you don't have to wait so long. The service is great here, very friendly. Prices seem a bit high, but you really shouldn't mind considering the quality of the food here. I came here with my boyfriend, aunt, and daughter. My daughter had a short stack of their pancakes with fruit. Nice and fluffy; and I don't normally like thick pancakes, but theirs were delicious and had a bit more texture to it which I loved. My aunt, boyfriend, and I decided to order items that we could all share. The menu seems small, but there are so many good items that it was difficult to come to a consensus. So many choices, so little table space. \n\nI love poached eggs, so was excited to find a section of their menu dedicated to poached eggs with different choices of what goes on top. We decided on the La Mer: with fresh hand picked dungeness crab, green onions, and haas avocados. SOOO GOOOOD!! My aunt ordered the pancake sampler which came with three different pancakes from their menu. I was not too fond of their gingerbread pancakes, but their buttermilk pancakes are great! My boyfriend ordered the Mexico scrambled eggs, which he almost devoured before my aunt and I could get a bite. A side of potatoes, their \"home fries\", came with the egg dishes and they were amazing! I'm not sure what it is that makes these potatoes so special, but they're addicting!

The process of finding parking is unbearable!  To make matters worse, Zazie does not take reservations for lunch/brunch.  Because we arrived late at 2pm, however, the wait was only approximately 20 minutes.  Twenty minutes - to me - was manageable.\n\nThe restaurant itself is fairly small - a modest French bistro with a warm, light-hearted atmosphere.  The best part of the place is their charming patio area in the back - which was where we were seated luckily.\n\n[ DINING EXPERIENCE ]\n\nAs an eggs benedict connoisseur, it was a given that my hungry eyes would immediately go to their \"Poached Eggs\" section.  I ordered the \"Albert,\" which comes with bacon, white cheddar, and salsa fresco.  (Though, with my taste buds not feeling that adventurous this day, I asked for no salsa.)\n\nMy dish was delectable!  The poached eggs and bacon were cooked to my absolute satisfaction.  The eggs were not watery at all, and the yolk was cooked to perfection.  (Note: You can always tell how well a poached egg is cooked by examining how the yolk flows when you cut into it with your knife).\n\nMy dish was also accompanied by salad, but how much can you say about a side salad?  I picked at my frends' home fries and they were simply fair in my opinion.  They were engrossed with a nice garlic flavor, but were too soggy for my liking. \n\nOverall, I had a memorable meal and will definitely come back for more!  Maybe try their dinner too - which I've heard is fabulous.", "author": "Judy C."}

He was also confused by the fact that I was dining alone, but offered me an inside table where I would have been stared at by all the other patrons for being a lonely fool, or outside on the gorgeous night.  \n\nThe back patio was quite full, and it seemed to overwhelm the waitress.  As someone who waited tables for many years, I know that when you get triple-sat, life sucks, but she just seemed flustered and angry instead of addressing the situation.  All she had  to say is \"I'm busy, but I'll be right with you.\"  I also was sitting next to some of the most pretentious douches and their wives, but that wasn't the waitress' fault.  Seriously, one couple at this table didn't know what country their former nanny was from, and was bemoaning the fact that their au pair was pissed because she didn't have a car.  It was all I could do to keep from stabbing myself in the ear and bleeding on them.\n\nANYWAY I got the burger and roasted potatoes which is probably now my favorite burger...but I was extremely saddened by the service.  I might go back for dinner (not alone) on a Tuesday when they have their wine special for that burger, but I am not in any hurry.", "author": "Pam S."}

Parking was a bit hard to find since streets surrounding Zazie was metered and 1 hour limit. I didn't use my UC Berkeley instincts so well and didn't read the sign so I was like WHAT? Why doesn't it take anymore quarters?! I had go to the local shops to ask for change. I suppose people do that a lot around here, so this lady from the antique shop automatically denied me. But Tully's was nice enough to give me change. \n\nThe wait was about 40 minutes, which was not bad. We were seated inside. My  friends and I went for the poached eggs dish. While my 2 other friends took the sweeter route. Here is what we got:\n\n1. I got the Pierre Nior. Which is a roasted tomato, bacon, and a perfectly cooked poached egg on top of a thin biscuit \n2. My friend got the St. Trop which is: smoked salmon, red onions, poached egg on a biscuit\n3. Florentine: portobella mushrooms, spinach, and poached eggs on a biscuit\n4. The Challah french toast\n5. Gingerbread Pancakes\n\nAll the poached eggs dishes were mighty delish! The portions were great for me since I eat small portions in the morning. I was able to clean my plate!! Hallelujah! All the poached eggs dishes also came with either a salad or home-fries. This place has the best home-fries I ever tasted. Oppose from a red potato that a lot of restaurants uses (since it hold the form of a potato wedge better), Zazie uses an Idaho potato which is the starchiest!\n\nI didn't find the sweet dishes to appetizing since the one layer of pancake and french toast was huge. it was so thick i felt like it was more of a bread than a pancake. But to each its own! \n\nThe eggs rule since there are five different ways you can have your egg! Definitely a place to check out if you are into breakfast foods. \n\nI gave this place fours stars oppose to 5 is because I do not live in SF, I live in the the east bay, so driving all the way was a far stretched since it is in the castro area.

I typically go for the sweeter options, but my fellow diners raved about the eggs Benedict as well. \n\nBe forewarned: The prices here are steep - $6 for one pancake. I definitely went home and concocted a copycat recipe of my own so that I could enjoy gingerbread pancakes anytime and spare my wallet a little hardship.

My boyfriend and I just moved to this part of the city and are trying to find a new brunch place.  However, we are resigned that people who have reviewed Zazie's recently have never had good brunch.  Zazie does not make good brunch. \n\nThis place cannot even do the basics.  Let's first look at the home fries.  They are unevenly cut and therefore unevenly cooked.  It's not rocket science.  Today one of my potatoes basically seemed it had never been heated and another was so burnt I had to spit it out.  Yes, there are garlic cloves in the potatoes.  Yes, this is yummy, but its also not that creative and not that difficult.  Second the toast is not even toasted.  I am not kidding.  Third, the ingredients in my omelet were not even chopped up. \n\nI left Zazies today really sad.  I wish it would have worked out, but it seems this used to be a great place that has lost its ability as its clientele has expanded. \n\nNormally I would give it 2 stars, but I think it needs to get knocked down in the ratings, so I am giving it a 1 star.

We went really early from Berkeley, since the reviews said there was always a 45 minute wait for a table on Sundays. \n\nTo our disappointment, the food wasn't good, and was quite overpriced. \n\nWe ordered the gingerbread pancakes, the cornmeal pancakes which was a special, the brulee steel cut oatmeal, an OJ, and a coffee. And it came to $54, after figuring in a 15% tip. We don't mind that it was a comparatively expensive breakfast. The problem is that it wasn't worth it. \n\nOne thing that we don't understand is: why was it all the food we ordered, including the coffee, came to us lukewarm, bordering to cold? And when everything was so lukewarm rather than warm, not to say hot, it become very difficult for us to enjoy it!\n\nI think the worst dish that we ordered was the brulee steel cut oatmeal. It was meant to be a small laddle of cream brulee put at the center of a big bowl of steel cut oatmeal with banana slices inside. Unfortunately, there was so little brulee and the oatmeal wasn't cooked well - it was  extremely thick and there was still a lot of big 1\" lumps in there!  As a result, it tasted blank. Given its blankness, you would think that this would be served with a lot of hot milk and some brown sugar, if only to give it taste and  loose up the big oatmeal lumps. However, none of them came with the oatmeal and I had to ask for them. \n\nThe special cornmeal pancake was okay, only that it was border to cold. Our first cup of coffee was also not warm either. \n\nGiven so many quality breakfast places in SF, we could have gone to another good one.", "author": "Clara L."}

Really good breakfast/brunch food--TRY IT OUT!\n\nTip #1: Crazy crowded...my sister and I ventured here on a Thursday morning. Shouldn't have been so bad as a Friday/Saturday/Sunday morning. Unfortunately we waited a good 25 minutes only to get seated outside (it was slightly chilly). So if you want to get a good seat (and indoors), prepare to come early and wait your turn because it's pretty much crowded all the time from what i hear and what i experienced. We also arrived at 2pm, making it even weirder that it was so crowded! Basically our tips to avoid the traffic didn't do much for us :( \n\nAmbiance: Cute little breakfast spot in SF. There is street parking so that's nice but the restaurant itself is slightly cramped in my opinion. But regardless, the outdoor seating is cute and a great place to enjoy your brunch IF the sun is out. \n\nFood: Ordered my standard egg dish and split a dessert dish with my sister. I had the Fontainbleau scramble that came with with portobellos, shiitake, porcinis, spinach, fontina. For $12, yes it was a little pricey but they don't skimp on the ingredients so you get a lot of food and the whole wheat toast was soft and delicious! The scramble was heavy, but not in a bad way. I enjoyed the whole meal thoroughly. If I had to change one thing though I would make the dish a little less creamy. For some reason my egg scramble was a little less...solid? than I would like it to be. Maybe it was the cheese or the yolk not quite sure but it was too runny and so it tasted super cheesy and heavy overall. But just a nuance, overall really good dish! We also ordered a Pinkie's Challah French Toast with orange cinnamon batter. This was HEAVENLY! I am usually not a fan of sweet brunch dishes but I read good reviews about this one so I just had to try it and boy am I glad I did. Perfectly soft, gooey and sinful bites with fresh fruit on top. The cinnamon taste added a perfect kick and I love that you could order just one piece rather than a stack of the french toast (same with their pancakes). \n\nDrinks: Did not get anything but got a chance to taste my sister's Cole Valley Mimosa that came with orange and cranberry. A little pricey for $8, but still pretty good in taste. \n\nTip $2: The restaurant has a strict no substitutions rule (unless you ask for something with meat, without, which is what my sister did).\n\nVerdict; Definitely worth the amazing food! 1 star off for the kind of runny scramble.", "author": "Anu P."}

I think they pretty much just got the texture of a pancake but not the essence. I didn't taste any of that ginger-y goodness I was expecting. Pretty disappointing. \n\n-La Mer (crab with poached egg on top of an english muffin): I liked it! I liked poached egg on top of chunks of crab meat all over an english muffin. You crack open the egg and all the juicy goodness of the yolk comes spilling out all over the english muffin and the crab chunks. And then the english muffin soaks up the yolk of the egg and you eat it all together into a perfect bite of happiness. Thumbs up on this dish! \n\n-french toast: The pieces of french toast were sandwiched between a layer of caramelized walnuts topped with some syrup covered bananas. I personally think that whole combination SOUNDS good but it was TOO SWEET for me. That's just me though. I don't particularly enjoy getting all sugared up that early in the morning, so I wasn't all goo goo for this dish. However, if you scrap all that caramelized sugar layer off and just eat the french toast alone, it was really good. The bread was very soft and french toasty! Hello Breakfast :) \n\n-organic vanilla soymilk: Taste like a good glass of silk soymilk! yay!\n\n-hot chocolate: came in this big bowl and you had to drink it with a spoon. Very creamy and chocolately but not too sweet! Great drink to compliment a good breakfast! \n\nService: Decent. No complaints but nothing worth praising either. \n\nPrice: A bit pricey. For everything we ordered, it came out to be ~ $46. \"Now that's a spicy meatball\" for breakfast! X_X\n\nAmbiance: REALLY CUTE! I've personally never been to France, but this place embodies my impression of what a cute French cafe would look like! It had this really relaxing and soothing feel to it. The whole place just sings: \"it's just a lazy Sunday morning and you are just enjoying the beautiful sunshine. The morning is going to last forever, so take your time here and enjoy life.\" Call me crazy, but that was seriously how I felt when I ate here this morning.

Good thing I had a scarf, hood, and I was well bundled. You see, I didn't have alcohol to keep me warm like others did.  It is cool to eat outside for dinner.  We had the prixe fix, $27, starters:  mussels in great broth & chicken liver for me.  Entrees: Trout with goat cheese and salad & soup provencale for me (mussels, salmon, and a dense soup.  Dessert:  Creme Brulee (I would pass on this one.  Too starchy, not enough eggs)  & Ginger Pear Crumb (warm and perfect for cold night).

Interesting!  One of these days, I got to wake up early to try their weekend brunch!   Beware, they add $1.25 per person for health insurance.

So I'm a fairly harsh critic, having tried a lot of places, but Zazie is EASILY in my top 5 brunch places.  This review is based on the poached eggs, potatoes and excellent service.\n\nIll start with potatoes, or 'home fries, since usually I can judge a brunch place on the potatoes alone.  Zazie were pretty unique, a kind of fried country potatoes with whole cloves of garlic in the mix.  The potatoes were a perfect combination of crisped on the outside, but still tender.  And the garlic was surprisingly pleasant to eat whole.  Usually i prefer crispier potatoes since country potatoes aren't seasoned well enough and lack flavor, but these were really tasty.  4/5 stars.\n\nThe poached eggs were served sort of eggs benedict style.  I ordered the one with bacon and white cheddar and my brother the one with smoked salmon.  Both absolutely delicious and easily the best eggs I'd ever had prepared that way.  5 stars.\n\nWhat really confirmed the 5th star for Zazie was the waiting staff.  The restaurant is fairly small and decently long waits outside every weekend.  I was late coming to meet my family and in the midst  of catching up, we probably sent the waiter away a couple of times before ordering.  But throughout our time their he was really courteous, attentive, and made the whole experience great.\n\nCon - No fresh squeezed OJ, which was extra disappointing since I was hungover on holiday party wine and its my brunch drink of choice.", "author": "Dhiraj S."}

The reason why I give this a 2 star rating is because going on the weekend is a nightmare. I went with my husband and daughter and when we arrived, it was busy, but not crazy. There were 3 people ahead of us. \n\nThe problem was after a while, I noticed the host allowing the \"regulars\" to go ahead of us. This was ridiculous. I watched as people would come well after we did and sign in after us and get a table. And it would be groups larger than ours. I asked politely on our status and he kept assuring me it would be soon.. but we had 3 people, he said. That was ridiculous since I watched him seat his \"regulars\" who had groups of 4.\n\nI wanted to leave, but we were so hungry that we knew if we went anywhere else at that point, we would be in for a longer wait.. So we ended up waiting for at least an hour and 10 minutes. This was just disappointing. \n\nSo if you go, go EARLY or on a weekday. And of course, if you're a regular, go anytime... you'll get in way ahead of those of us that actually bother to think a sign-in method is fair.", "author": "Kelly F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-02", "description": "This is my FAVORITE brunch spot in SF- hands down!\n\nFOOD:  The Zazie reviews speak for itself-- amazing and delicious!  We ordered a ton of food for only ~$20/person.  There are those typical \"breakfast / brunch places\" and then there are those fabulous breakfast/brunch places that make you realize how much you LOVE breakfast foods like eggs (poached, scrambled, omelet-style), bacon, ham, Eggs Benedict, bagels, toast, sandwiches, juice and oatmeal.  \n\nI had been getting into a sad rut where I loved breakfast foods but had not found a place that really showcased such breakfast items in a way that justified spending $12 on eggs and carbs and also make me think, \"WOW.\"  Zazie changed that with their hearty yet delicate lunch that was delicious through and through!  :)\n\nGINGERBREAD PANCAKES (4/5):  Light and delicious, the flavor of the gingerbread pancakes were brought out by a sweet lemon curd along with a slice of caramelized pear.  YUM.  A stack of 2 gingerbread pancakes will easily feed a table of four.\n\nTAHITI FRENCH TOAST (5/5):  Yes, it's that good!  The french toast was huge and buttery soft and paired perfectly with walnut cream and caramelized strips of banana.  SO exquisite and delicious.  This French Toast doesn't make you feel like you're just eating filler carbs because this is a great dish in its own right. A definite must order with your brunch entree.\n\nEGGS BENEDICT (5/5):  Whatever you order (the Floretine, Pierre Noire, the Albert), the poached eggs are huge and perfect!  The eggs benedict made me fall in love with breakfast all over again.  The poached eggs had the perfect consistency (not overdone, a little runny, held its perfect little shape on top of the English muffin, tomatoes and bacon). \n\nThe roasted potatoes and garlic that accompany the egg dishes are delicious.  The potatoes are a little oily but there's some kind of intense, robust flavor that makes it hard to stop eating the potatoes and doesn't make you feel like you're just eating those typical roasted rosemary potatoes.  You really feel like you're eating a hearty, flavorful breakfast that someone took a lot of thought into preparing.  So good!  You can choose from 1 to 2 to 3 eggs at different prices ($9 / 12 / 16 (i think)).\n\nSANDWICHES (4/5):  Very good as well!  We had the sandwich with a fried egg, ham, melted cheese and a side salad of mixed greens.  The sandwich is very good, but we found ourselves going to the eggs benedict more.  I think my friends had a delicious ahi tuna sandwich-- will definitely try that next time. \n\nWAIT:  We waited for approximately 30-40 minutes on a Sunday at 1 p.m.  The wait dies down significantly by 2 p.m., but that's because the restaurant closes at 2:30 p.m.  This place is worth the wait- you won't be disappointed. \n\nUNIQUE:  Zazie is an affordable and unique local gem that embraces SF's \"go green\" mentality and features a delicious brunch that'll have you talking about it the entire day (no joke!).  Zazie has two outdoor seating tables in front of the restaurant, a handful of wooden tables indoors and a beautiful backyard/patio seating area outside.  \n\nCUTE:  Everything about this place is great!  Zazie has super cute, painted plates and a comfortable (and comforting) feel to the restaurant.  You'll find yourself spending over an hour or two eating and chatting with friends without even knowing it!  There's homemade jam (slightly sweet and tart) on the table as well.\n\nMIMOSA:  The mimosa drinks looked delicious.  They had a fresh mango mimosa that I would definitely try. (Reminds me of what The Grape Leaf Inn served in Napa.)\n\nDINNER:  The dinner at Zazie looks pretty darn good, especially since they pair it with community-friendly outreach-type incentives like no corkage-fee nights, dog-friendly nights and prie fix menues for ~$28.  Will definitely have to check it out next time.", "author": "Sunny S."}

It was a crisp 48 degrees out and we checked the \"first available\" box to insure we'd get a table within a reasonable time period. We were a group of five and, miraculously, were seated within about 10 minutes of putting our names on the list. We were seated inside and ordered our dishes, a build-your-own mimosa and an order of the cream cheese coffee cake. \n\nSurprisingly, the food came out also shockingly quickly and was shockingly good. I ordered the monaco, which is eggs benedict with proscuitto and tomato. The hollandaise wasn't overwhelmingly rich but was delicious and the potatoes were crisp and savoury as well.

I had a group of 3 and most places try to squeeze you into a 2-person table, but they were all about pushing two tables together and giving us a 4-person space. And while this might seem like a trivial thing, it's the sort of stuff I really appreciate.  \n\nThe brunch menu is mouth-watering. I am always torn between a protein-filled egg dish or a sugar-carb extravaganza. This time I chose the latter and had the 3-pancake sampler. Of the 3 pancakes, all were delish but I liked the miracle and buttermilk the best. Surprisingly, the gingerbread pancake was my least favorite. I thought it lacked flavor and was a bit dry, in comparison to the other two. Also, on the sampler, they just have the pear compote topping which I actually wasn't a huge fan of - a little too sweet for me so I took most of it off. I wish they did another fruit topping option for the sampler. I had the regular coffee which was fine. My friend had a cafe au lait that looked great. I would love to try the egg dishes and poached egg specialties next time. \n\nI'd be fearful of the weekend brunch line, so a weekday brunch/lunch is ideal if you can make it. Street parking is also much easier on the weekday, or take the N-Judah.", "author": "Veronica H."}

Sorry, Zazie. \n\nThe Pros: \n\n-Zazie is such a great little breakfast/brunch spot. Right in the heart of Cole Valley and cozy and quaint. \n-The Tahitian French Toast is amazing! Sweet and nutty and banana-y and gooey and soft and crispy and delicious. But it's huge. So if you're 2 little asian girls, don't go ordering a stack of 2. Order 1, and split it. That is, assuming you're also going to be ordering the gingerbread pancakes. \n-I love the mimosa selection! It was nice to see options when deciding how to buzzed at 9:30 in the morning. Mango mimosa all the way. YUM. \n\nThe Cons:\n\n-Parking is ridiculous. Streets are relatively narrow and there is always some kind of construction going on. I miss the days of free street parking. \n-The wait time is also ridiculous. Luckily we got there--well, I go there--at 9am to put our name in so it wasn't too bad, but this place gets insanely crowded. \n-I wanted to love the gingerbread pancakes because everybody raves about them! But I found ours to be heavy and doughy. The marmalade on top, however, was excellent. \n-The sausages are tiny. \n\nOverall, Zazie is a nice neighborhood brunch spot, and I would definitely go back for the French toast and get a mimosa or two. Or three.", "author": "Michelle Q."}

At last, I can say I'm a satisfied customer and will be coming back very soon!\n\nOn a beautiful 75 degree Saturday in SF, my friends and I came here for brunch.

It was a perfect day to have brunch outside and simply made the whole experience even better.\n\n- Bloody Mary: bland, not enough spices, tasted mostly like tomato juice with splash of vodka, comes with a celery & string bean (interesting)\n\n- Fontainbleu Scramble: EXCELLENT! I love mushrooms and this had the right combo of eggs, mushrooms, spinach, fontina, and seasoning. I was also able to get it with egg whites so extra points for that. comes with a thick piece of toast and I opted for the salad (average tasting mista salad).\n\n- Spritzer: my friend insisted i write a complaint about her drink in my review, so here it is. The spritzer was supposed to be a combo of OJ, cranberry, and pellegrino, but tasted like OJ only with a weird aftertaste. There was no carbonation and no trace of cranberry whatsoever.

As everyone else has mentioned, it's pretty consistently great, and we always enjoy our time there.\n\nFor this review, though, I'm writing about our experience hosting an event at Zazie. We had about forty out-of-town wedding guests to Zazie for our rehearsal dinner, and it was one of the highlights of our wedding weekend.\n\nWe took over the back patio for the first half of the evening in late June. It's always risky planning something outside on a June evening in San Francisco, doubly so in Cole Valley. But the patio heaters and umbrellas are enough to make sure you won't have too many issues - and they have blankets out back if you need them in a pinch.\n\nWhen you have a large party, they have a per-guest minimum, which is generally pretty reasonable. If you have a lot of kids coming, it might be a challenge - if they take up a seat, they get charged the same as an adult, similar to an airline. \n\nOur meal was awesome. They served family-style, which keeps things flexible and relaxed, which is just our style. The salad was refreshing. The meyer lemon ravioli was a hit. The steak was perfect. The steelhead trout (like salmon) had a fantastic texture. For dessert, our guests were fawning over the baked hot chocolate, and the strawberry rhubarb crumble was right up my alley. There was something for everyone - the foodies were thrilled, and there was something to please the pickiest of eaters as well.\n\nThe wine was good, but the lemonade they serve was one of the underdog winners of our night. We have to find out where to get it ourselves.\n\nBest of all, Jen (the owner) and Jeff took great care of our group. Even as a few people arrived late and we had some logistical issues to deal with, they made sure it never felt like a big deal.\n\nIt was the perfect place to share a great meal while introducing our friends and family to our neighborhood. If you can get a space there for your event, take it - you'll be in great hands.", "author": "M. Jackson W."}

I used to live around the corner in a basement apartment that included leaky water pipes that hung from the ceiling. But that is another story for another review. \n\nA four course dinner with each course paired with the perfect wine for $69 per person sounded like a bargain and jumped all over a reservation. All you can drink wine is usually enough to get me calling, but when you toss in some amazing food that may be the best kept secret in San Francisco made this night truly exceptional. \n\nThe owner/hostess was gracious and very accommodating and made sure the bottles of wine were flowing throughout the evening. She made sure that every need however small was met and did so with a smile. Her staff was professional and friendly and added to the great evening. We were seated in the back patio which I found to be very comfortable and kept warm by the strategically placed heat lamps.\n\nThe courses? \n\n1. Arugula salad, goat cheese, raspberries and shaved almonds. Lightly but perfectly tossed in a flavorful olive oil. \n\n2. Cheese and fig ravioli that may have been some the best ravioli I have ever tasted. \n\n3. Rabbit served over linguni and mushrooms. I opted for the vegetarian option, but according to my dinner companions they all agreed the rabbit was prepared perfectly and judging by the \"oohs\" and \"awws\" after each taste probably was pretty good. \n\n4. Duck,-Again I went with the vegetarian option, but my wife who usually will shy away from duck because of the \"richness factor\" was very impressed with the execution. \n\n5. Chocolate cheesecake, we ate every bite...enough said. \n\nA huge bonus at the end came when the restaurant announced there were a few bottles of wine leftover and would be available for sale at their cost. AWESOME! \n\nZazie does not attempt to sell itself as a Gary Danko or French Laundry, but if you are looking for a fun neighborhood experience with a fun atmosphere, then look no further and do yourself a favor and check them out.", "author": "Rene C."}

I was expected one of the best breakfast I would have but it wasn't like that at all. Not that the food wasn't good, it was, it's just that my expectations were a little bit high I guess after reading all those positive great reviews. I came in knowing I would probably order either french toast, pancakes, or croque madame. From all the pictures and reviews, those sounded the best.\n\nAfter meeting up with my favs, Tracy A. and Steven T., we headed over here, had to wait just a couple minutes before a table cleared up. I really wanted to sit outside but it was a rainy day so I guess next time I come back to try the things I initially wanted to try. After getting seated, we looked through the menu. Plenty of options, their regular menu and specials that day. For some reason, when I got seated, I didn't really feel like ordering any of the food that I had wanted to and was craving... Instead, I went with one of their specials, Eggs Genevieve. I don't know if it's because I love the Ms. Yelper herself, Genevieve Y., but I ordered that. It was a omelette/scramble with white cheddar, ham, and sliced avocado with side of home fries and toast of choice. Also order a orange juice.\n\nSo, when the waitress arrives with our drinks, spills it on poor Steven T, without notice, and proceeds to place the drinks on the table. HHAHA sorry Steven for ordering OJ! It would of prob been better if it was water... So after a little bit, our food arrives. Looks amazingly good. Especially if my avocado slices weren't bruised! YAY for that! First thought, WOW these home fries are loaded with oil!!!!! First bite? WOW, there's a WHOLE handful plus of white cheddar. Overwhelming. I felt like I was eating a Squeeze omelette (Squeeze Inn's squeeze burger) Not that I don't like cheese, I love it, but it was a lot! Ham were all on one side, the side I wasn't eating yet. And by the time I got to it, I was full. Filled with cheese, and oily but yummy crispy potatoes, I didn't wanna continue eating..\n\nAll in all, food was OK.

My only complaint was the hollandaise sauce, which was tasteless and bland. \n\nThe French Toast Tahiti stuffed with a walnut spread and topped with caramelized bananas was delicious. I think some type of walnut spread or syrup is required for good French toast. The three pieces of toast was a lot of sugar for one person so it's better to share that. I think the French toast at Brenda's with its honey walnut syrup still edges the toast here.\n\nWas the food worth waiting over an hour to try? Probably not, but that's what we get for trying to cram 7 people into a small restaurant for Sunday brunch.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

Entrees were where things got spotty. Trout entree was quite good, well cooked with tender fish and crispy skin, but they brought out a chicken entree instead of steak. Apparently they gave my steak to the wrong table? Not really a big deal except it took probably 15-20 minutes to get my entree by which point the trout was consumed. I found the steak entree rather odd, mostly the sweet nutty sauce that it was presented with. Steak with mushrooms and gorgonzola works, but throwing in a sweet sauce didn't make sense to me. The mac 'n cheese was alright, I felt the pasta was a little too firm/thick for my tastes. Dessert seemed alright, they comped us the side dish for making us wait, which is cool, but I guess their kitchen is too small and busy to expedite a messed up order.\n\n-1 star for messed up order taking too long\n-1 star for not enjoying steak entree", "author": "Steven C."}

I've been wanting to visit and try you for so long, and today I finally got to. \n\nEver since I went on a Brunch craze a couple months ago, I wanted to find somewhere in the Bay Area to try. Zazie's reviews caught my eye, and the menu made it a definite that I wanted to visit someday. The timing was never right, but this week while my girlfriend was in town for New York City, we decided to try it out. Before heading to Zazie, I already knew what I wanted to try (definitely did my menu and review researching before, there's so many options and I want to be sure to try the best ones). \n\nMy friend and I ordered the French Toast Tahiti, Gingerbread Pancakes, La Mer (poached eggs), and Florentine (poached eggs). First off, all four dishes were so delicious - I really liked that each ingredient in the dishes tasted perfect and were cooked to perfection. Usually I'm not a fan of anything sweet, but the French Toast and Pancakes are to die for. I noticed a lot of good reviews for the pancakes, and I am a french toast lover so I just had to try both. \n\nThe poached egg dishes were very delicious as well. The potatoes that accompany the dishes are so good - I wanted to be good and opt for a salad, but with potatoes that good, you gotta be bad! Poached eggs were delicious along with each of its ingredients and english muffins were toasted very well. \n\nI LOVED each and every dish we tried today. The service was on point and friendly, and we were so lucky to have got to Zazie around 12pm today, and we didn't have to wait at all. I really liked the atmosphere - small and cozy, yet not too cramped. They also have a very cool spiral staircase at the front which I love, and wondered how the employees shoot up and down that thing carrying storage items.\n\nNot sure when I can return, but Zazie was definitely a wonderful brunch experience.

To be honest, when I generally give food reviews, it's usually just about the food. But let me just say here that this place really knows how to create the right ambiance for a Sunday brunch.\n\nI came here with a friend of mine who's from outside the city, and knowing that she is a huge foodie who absolutely loves ANYTHING and EVERYTHING sweet, we decided to try Zazie for their lauded gingerbread pancakes. I ordered one of the breakfast specials (scrambled eggs, dungeness crab, and English Peas) and my friend gave those pancakes a whack. Both orders came out in a timely-fashion and our server was a pleasant fellow.\n\n1) My dish was simple, delicious, and got me where I needed to be. Nothing too special unfortunately, so I can't say much else. 3 stars\n\n2) My friend's pancakes looked amazing. And they tasted amazing too!! She gave me a generous taste and even after sitting on her plate for 10-15min, it tasted divine. The lemon curd and bosc pears were such excellent pairings and the \"gingerbreadiness\" of the pancake itself made me think about Christmas. A real treat. 4 stars\n\n3) The ambiance is the kicker that rounds up my review to 4 stars. It has a homeliness to it that takes you to the countryside with a clientele that represents the city of San Francisco. The noise level was at a minimum, making conversation easy. The walls are lined with Picasso-esque portraits and landscapes, and they have an outdoor patio area that especially appeals to dinner-diners. And the entrance has a winding staircase! (something my friend has always wanted in her house growing up). 5 stars.\n\nWith wonderful, friendly service in a simply pastoral atmosphere and delectable brunch food with a French influence, Zazie was great find.

I have trouble thinking of words to describe it. I should invest in a thesaurus. \n\n I had Souffle Gateau Zazie for dessert. Molten cake invaded dessert scene a couple of years ago and I always feel they are pretty standard until now. Our dessert took a while because it exploded in the oven.  I have a active imagination so I just thought of the Muppet chef freaking out in the kitchen. :)  Their souffle is a white chocolate with lemon!!!! The berries were a excellent touch to really balance the sweetness of the white chocolate. I don't usually like fruity flavors in my chocolate but the lemon add a little extra something to really make this dish delicious. \n\nService: 2 stars.  The service was great in the beginning since there was only 5 of us in the restaurant. I measure service on how they refill my water glass...does my cup empty or does it always stay full? I waited 10 mins for water and bread. That will give you a idea if you should take my service review with a grain of salt.  We had to wave our waiter down twice for our bill. It took about 20 mins to get the bill. I didn't mind that much since my friend and I can entertain each other for hours so if you have a friend who likes promptness it can be a problem. \n\nOverall, great experience and good french food. I just think the service needs some improvement. I would say this place is a good pick for dinner to catch up with friends.  Make a reservation! \n\nThanks for reading my super long review! If I could I would give you 5 stars!", "author": "Denise F."}

I must say, this place is DELICIOUS. It's a small place but the ambiance is so welcoming; it almost feels as if you are at home in your pajamas, eating a home-cooked meal. \n\nMy brother ordered the Gingerbread Pancakes and they taste like Christmas morning! Mind you, I'm not a big fan of ginger but I would eat that any day. My sister and I shared the French Toast Tahiti and one of the specials which was the Poached Egg with Prawns. The french toast was amazing! It was crispy and light and the filling was not too sweet which made everything come together! Don't forget the maple syrup! Hands down a french toast that will not disappoint. The Poached Egg with Prawns was my favorite dish from the three. I'm a little biased due to the fact that I eat more savory food but this was amazing! The hollandaise sauce was creamy, smooth and decadent. Make sure you order the home fries, you will NOT be disappointed! The potatoes are cooked to perfect and they have WHOLE GARLIC CLOVES included in the home fries! Any place that cooks with whole garlic cloves is on top of my list!\n\nI'm not a big brunch person, but I wouldn't mind eating here everyday. The food is wonderful and the staff are super nice!

The best part wasn't their service (which was great), or their mimosas (which were fabulous), nor their eggs benedict (which were amazing). No, the best part of this place are their country potatoes, hands down. \n\nImagine a plate of crispy potatoes with other onions and peppers which have obviously been sitting on a low griddle for at least 2 hours to get that wonderful caramelization. Well, the best part is that for every piece of potato you get, you also have a huge garlic clove. At first I was confused as to why they would serve garlic still in its skin. Then I saw that these pieces of garlic were slow roasted and that you can literally squeeze the garlicky goodness out like a spread and spread it all over each piece f potato. When garlic is slow roasted to the point where it's really soft, it becomes really savory, fragrant, and sweet. Talking about this makes me want to have some of their potatoes right now.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this place! This place also makes me miss the time when I was living in France.", "author": "Rylan C."}

Around the table we got both french toasts, the fountainbleu scramble, the Albert, the St. Trop and the Valence.\n\nOverall:\nBloody Marys/mimosas: ok. Bloody Marys had too much pepper taste for my liking. Mimosas were good but stick with the original.\nFrench Toasts: the two are essentially the same, so get the one with walnuts and bananas. Delicious. It leans toward the bready rather than eggy side of things.\nAlbert: Exactly as it sounds.\nSt. Trop: great combination even though it sounded weird.\nValence: the tomato-chevre sauce was so good.\n\nOf the three poached eggs we got though, I felt most were overdone. Not quite runny enough for my taste.\n\nEnvironment: Patio is adorable. And the heat lamps make it perfect when it's a bit cold outside.\nService: The server mostly just leaves you alone.

There was a mini-flock of denizens gathered in front of Zazie's ~ around it was pretty quiet.  I think some that saw the wait trickled over to the other eateries.\n\nMy friend was about to keel over, so we took a quick jaunt over to La Boulange ~ another charming place, and ordered a snack for her and a cup of perk for me.  We debated whether to order a meal here, but decided to hold out for Zazie.\n\nOne of those rare warm days, so standing on the sidewalk with the sun on our backs was a bonus.  We got sun *and* nourishment this morning - a double treat!\n\nThe inside of Zazie is comfy, but I'm glad we got to sit on their cozy back patio ~ I was amazed at how well they laid out their sliver of backside.\n\nI highly recommend the Ginger pancakes.  You can order a stack of 1, 2, or 3.  They are huge!  My friend and split an order of 2 pancakes, and an order of 2 eggs, with toast, salad (or you can choose home fries), and add bacon.  We should've ordered 1 pancake to share between us ~ we couldn't finish it since we were bursting with great food.\n\nThe staff are really nice.

Next time I'll get the salmon, though some of the salads looked interesting. \n\nThough I don't normally have tea or coffee at lunch, they were good. Water is served in a large, pretty caraffe of iced water, sans the ice. Tasty. From someone born in SF, take that as a compliment, Zazie.\n\nZazie gets a five mostly for the all-around excellent service. I liked the way the staff busily planned for a large wheelchair before the disabled customer arrived. They obviously knew ahead of time. When he arrived, he too was treated nicely. \n\nHopped on the J, so I can't tell you about the parking. I don't think it's great there.\n\nOnly minus: Don't think the waitress spoke French. Not for the snob appeal -- French is truly a beautiful language, but if your website says \"Bienvenue\" in as (sorta) cosmo a city as San Fran, Zazie, please teach your staff some basic French.  There are plenty of French and French-speaking people in the Haight and Inner Sunset.", "author": "Robert F."}

We love to come here for a delicious breakfast.  And we mean delicious.  Your cappucino comes European style in a bowl.  \n\nThe  menu is varied and wonderful, with french flair.  The ambiance is cafe like with fun francaise touches, and deco art on the walls. We love the french toast with carmelized bananas and poached eggs with various toppings and hollaindaise.  They even serve Aidell's sausages and deligious real home fried potatoes.  There is always a wait though, so be prepared and don't grumble - it doesn't get you a table sooner.\n\n When the morning fog clears, they open their rear garden area - which is always a treat.  There isn't an item on their menu that isn't worth having.  Even their burger at lunch has flair.  Also -if something isn't too your liking - they will make it again...it only happened once when i received the wrong omlette.  \n\nI take every visitor and my clients when they are available, here for breakfast.  Coles hardware is across the street and a great beauty supply is on the same block too.  It's a fun little neighborhood for shopping after your gorgeous breakfast.  \n\nLove - Love - Love Zazies, they do it right, exotic and delicious...what more can a luxury real estate group look for in San Francisco.

So, I was super excited to try their eggs benedict and, since it was a holiday weekend, they had some extra special options on the menu.  I selected the eggs benedict with avocado, bacon and Fontina cheese.  I was somewhat skeptical about the Fontina, as it melts well, but can be sour and overpowering.  And, that's exactly what I got.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, runny and poufy, and the avocado and bacon were delicious.  But, the Fontina really added a sourness to the dish that took over everything else. To top it off, my English muffin had been burnt and the meal was lukewarm when it got to the table.

I just left my jacket and scarf on and I was fine with the heaters. It made for a picturesque dinner with the white lights they have strung on the patio! The complimentary hot roll they bring every time is always fresh out of the oven hot and a perfect start to the meal. I ordered the trout and my companion the pasta a la courge with prawns- both ah-mazing.

But on the bright side, we came in late enough that there was no wait.  \n\nNot like we really minded sitting inside.  The restaurant is quite charming, and has the homey feeling of a cute Parisian bistro.  It reminded me a lot of La Note in Berkeley, down to the adorable menus and the menu offerings.\n\nWe ordered the following items:\n- Salade Marius (spinach, caramelized walnuts, gorgonzola cheese, and roasted bosc pears): Very good!  The poached pears were delicious and the ingredients complemented one another perfectly.  \n\n- Florentine poached eggs with spinach and portabello mushrooms:  Hands down, the BEST eggs florentine I've ever had!  I usually don't love eggs florentine because the spinach is not terribly flavorful and the hollandaise sauce can be very hit or miss.  But not here!  The mushrooms were an excellent touch and helped add a delicious hearty flavor.  The hollandaise sauce was also quite good and not too heavy, as it can often be.\n\n- French toast Tahiti (Pinkie's challah stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts):  Uh-MAZING!  We are fiends for french toast and we both agreed that this was some of the best we've had!  The caramelized banana-walnut mixture that they spread over the french toast was heavenly.  I would absolutely order it again!\n\nWe originally put in a full order of all 3 items, but the waiter informed us that it might be too much food and suggested downgrading the French Toast to a single order.  I LOVE when waiters do this!  I feel like it doesn't happen enough.  Of course, we had the PERFECT amount of food when everything came out.

We went for brunch on a Monday, and surprisingly the line was long, but well worth it.  My sister and I shared the \"build your own mimosas\"...they smartly use 90% bubbles and only 10% juice (the perfect ratio!), so the juice comes in a small carafe.  We shared an order of the French Toast Tahiti and the Gingerbread pancakes.  Both were absolutely delicious, and I usually don't care for pancakes, but the flavor combination of gingerbread, pear and lemon curd was too good to resist!  \n\nAs if the food and setting weren't enough, the service was fantastic!  The host offered us a choice between two tables (we elected to wait for a window booth, which was well worth the extra wait!), and our server was so friendly and hospitable.

The crowd appears to be older during dinner and it's much quieter than it is during brunch. \n\nMussels Mariniere - classic dish with a deliciously rich sauce. I think it would go great with pasta as well. \n\nCharcuterie plate - I was expecting a few slices of meat on a plate and some bead but you get a huge thing of salad, olives, pickles, ham that reminds me of jamon, chicken liver pate, and salmon rilettes. It's worth the $14. \n\nRoasted Trout - this is a whole trout that is de-boned. You can eat the whole thing. Came with a pile of greens and some sort of olive tapenade/salsa thing. \n\nLamb Tagine - the star dish of the night. It's lean lamb meat that must have been braised for hours and served with cous cous. \n\nPork Chop - the prep was good but I wasn't a fan of the sweet cider sauce.

When we got there it was prime Sunday brunch time and there were already a lot of people waiting outside, so we just put our names down on the list and had some coffee a few doors down. After that, we walked around for a little while and then went back to check on how close we were to being seated, which was not very close at all. \n\nBut, here's an important tip: the two tables in front of the restaurant are first come, first served! When we walked up we noticed the sign out front saying as much, and so we just sat down at one of tables that was empty since no one else seemed to be taking it. We asked a server to double check that we weren't stealing someone else's table, and he confirmed that we could just help ourselves and gave us menus! We noticed some glares from people who were waiting nearby and didn't realize they could have sat down, but it was a small price to pay for the wait time we saved by snagging one of these tables...many of the people who were standing around when we were seated were still waiting when we left.\n\nThe food was pretty tasty, there were a lot of sweet and savory dishes to choose from that looked good, the staff was friendly, and the surrounding area was cute.

I didn't know the back deck was so substantial.  We passed through the tiny kitchen -- how do you make so much damned food in such a small space?\n\nThe hostess squeezed us into a table outdoors.  We were well shaded by an umbrella and trees.  Soft music played through speakers -- a great outdoor setting.\n\nThe menus arrived quickly and the food and drinks soon after.  Two of us ordered the smoked salmon sandwiches, and the other the tuna sandwich.  The salmon was moist and smokey, the bread crispy and the greens fresh.  The tuna sandwich was amazing;  a giant seared piece of tuna served with some sort of seasoned pepper.  The tuna was definitely better than the salmon sandwich, but I'm not complaining.\n\nThe mimosas were the only area of criticism.  We ordered mango mimosas, but couldn't taste the fruit against the strong flavor of the champagne.  Oh well.

When we first moved to Cole Valley five years ago, we were here once a week for dinner- didn't even try the brunch until several months later. Since then we've been hardcore regulars and the food has only gotten better.\n\nDinner: I love so much of the menu it is hard to pick, but my all time faves are the beef shank, the hangar steak, any preparation of duck they serve (the confit has awesome potatoes with a tangy mustard sauce). There was a pork chop on the menu at one point with bread pudding (if I remember correctly) that was what I imagine crack must be like. The Mediterranean vegetable plate is a perfect starter, along with any soup that they make. Beet salad is good too. \n\nDesserts range from great to earth-shattering- my favorites are the fresh fruit crumble and the godlike Baked Chocolate Chaud (baked hot chocolate). I swear this stuff is not of this world- it morphs between a cakey-brownie-like texture which quickly gives way to thick melted chocolate, with an almost pudding-like consistency. Plus it's topped with melted marshmallows. I swear it will knock your socks clean off.\n\nBrunch is great too, but get there early, and get to know the man behind it all- Mario. The experience and often long waits become much more bearable. Of brunch fare my favorites are hands-down the Tahiti French Toast and any eggs benedict on the menu. The Gingerbread pancakes are awesome too, and if you like mimosas, get the one with the elderflower syrup.\n\nSome of the servers have become good friends of ours in our long patronage here, and Jen is one of my favorite business owners in the neighborhood. She runs a great establishment, one where we will most definitely eat until we fall off of our chairs. Highly, highly recommended. For dinner, get reservations ahead.

You can wake up at noon, nurse your hangover until 1, and then stumble over to Zazie.  Sweet, right?  Yeahhh maybe.\n\nZazie was a post-mini-DYK brunch spot for a group of six.  We arrived at around 1:45, spent 15 minutes looking for parking, and put our name down at 2pm.  The place was packed.  We were told that there was a 1 hour wait for a table.  Okay, fine.  We came all this way from the Marina, so we might as well wait it out.  The girls ended up heading down the street to do some shopping while the rest of us waited outside.\n\nThe food itself is not bad, but the portions seem kind of small for what you're paying.  The mimosas appear to be mostly champagne with a hint of orange juice -- the only way to make a mimosa! :)  The coffee cake is not bad, but also nothing special.  It seems like the same stuff I've had at a dozen other coffee shops.  My main course was a grilled tuna steak sandwich.  The tuna was grilled just right for sandwich-based consumption.  Pretty good and definitely the star of the party.\n\nFour stars for the food (mostly for the tuna sandwich, really), minus a star for the wait, price, and portions.", "author": "Andrew C."}

Besides, it gave me an excuse to develop a semi-tan from standing in the sun at the front of the place and the short stretch of Cole, dotted with cute little shops, restaurants, bars and cafes, was definitely interesting.  After 15 minutes, our table at the back patio was ready.\n\nThe service was flawless - the first table that we were seated at, in the back patio, was unfortunately the only one available, the sun was right above us and wasn't going anywhere for another couple of hours at least, and I thought I got 'just' enough tan for the day so I wasn't expecting to be under the sun throughout the duration of our meal.  As soon as we voiced our concern to our server, the host was notified and they were doing their best to accommodate us: inside table? another table on the patio? lucky for us another party of 2 just left so another table just became available.  It was cleaned out in a few seconds and we got seated rightaway.  Our server was sweet yet efficient - within minutes of taking our orders, the food arrived.\n\nNow the food was something else.  I was perhaps expecting something more sensational from a dish that is worthy of the 7X7 Big Eat SF 2010 entry: eggs benedict with hollandaise, toasted english muffin, avocado and dungeness crab with a side of garlic potatoes.  It was unfortunately ordinary and one of the eggs' yolk was hard and overcooked.  \n\nThat said, the whole experience was enjoyable and I definitely would love to give it another try.\n\nAt least I knocked off #77 - Eggs Benedict at the back patio of Zazie and, at 25%, I still have a LONG way to go!", "author": "Ange L."}

Yesterday was my first time back since they changed their policy to include tips in the price.  A great idea - or so I thought. Unfortunately the service was anything but great. It took a long time until we could order, my coke came without ice, their signature Le Metro cocktail ($10), though pretty, had no detectable alcohol in it and wasn't really cold, the lemon ravioli were half cold and had we had to send them back to the kitchen.  We were sitting outside and during the entire meal the waiter didn't check on us even once. Though the lemon ravioli were delicious after they came back hot, the portion was tiny and at $27 seriously overpriced for pasta without anything special in it. The included tip, certainly calculated at a minimum of 20% on top of health care and a 401K, is ok with me if the service warrants it - but unfortunately this was not the case at all.

You're gonna wait, gurrrl. There was a short lull in names being called, but then all of a sudden the flood gates opened, and at least 10 parties had gone MIA.

The table next to us were speaking in French, which kindof added a level of authenticity to the French cuisine they offer (though I think I was just lucky) and it seems like a popular hang out spot for the real housewives of Cole Valley. \n\nOther note-worthy dishes to try are the fish soup, it has a great, light seafoody flavor. The only (odd) thing to note is that the chai comes in a bowl, rather than a cup. I'm not sure of the reason why, but it tastes great according to my friend.

Towards the end of our meal, the service really improved and they comped us a 2nd bottle of champagne (we ordered a first bottle with our meal) for our understanding of the wait. It was unexpected and unnecessary, but VERY much appreciated. \n\nAlso: If you write \"BAR\" next to your name on the wait list, you can go to the pub next store and enjoy a pre-brunch beverage and they will look for you inside the pub once your table is ready. Zazie was the birthday girl's choice last weekend and the longish wait for a table really flew by once we discovered this trick!", "author": "Amanda S."}

I think our expectations were too high though, holding Tartine and Universal Cafe as our standards for Weekend Brunch.\n\nFirst, we were definitely clueless about your outdoor table policy.  For these 2 tiny 2-tops, it's first-come-first served (no need to put your name on the list). I could see where this may lead to potential disagreements?\n\nSecond, the menu just didn't seem to inspire. On a recent visit the special was a chicken-apple sausage scramble.  When a side of chicken-apple is already on the menu, putting it in a \"special\" made me think you were just trying to get rid of old/ aging stock.\n\nSo. On to the food - I ordered the Fontainbleu -- the mushroom - fontina - spinach scramble.  Nice selection of mushrooms (portabello and small shiitakes were included at the time), and the eggs were cooked well, but the dish needed a bit of salt/ seasoning.  The boy ordered their crab benedict which was fine and actually fairly tasty with some nice chunks of crab.\n\nVery decent Bloody Mary - nicely spicy and tangy (but when you've got Universal Cafe in mind with their house pickled veggies, plain tomato juice and horseradish just does not compare...).  I ordered the Sunshine -- mango juice and sparkling wine -- and could barely taste the mango.\n\nOn another visit Danny was more pleased with their Mexican scramble with chorizo, red peppers and salsa.  I chose their eggs florentine with a side of the chicky-apple sausage.  Their hollandaise could have been a bit tangier.  Decent, but nothing that wowed me.\n\nA note - when sharing the banana stuffed french toast with walnuts (Tahiti), do not take it apart the layer by layer.  You'll discover a not-so- appetizing smear of smashed bananas staring you in the face... perhaps it's better to cut crosswise first.  Oh - and we found perhaps 2 walnuts in the entire dish.

Got excited after seeing 4 stars rating. So I immediately think it's a must try. It's a Saturday brunch, so I already expected a wait (which is fine, thinking it's worth for the high rating food and experience).... The wait wasn't too long, about 20-30 minutes. Which is pretty good. But the negatives begin.... With a high expectation about the quality of the food and the price they charge, I would think I will fall in love with this restaurant. I ordered French toast with SEASONAL FRUITS, and the La Mer crab Benedict with homemade fries. The wait for the food seem longer than the wait for a table. Ticket time for food should not be longer than 15 minutes max! But exclude the time I have to write for our server to take our orders, I still have to wait for 20-25 minutes for my food to come. But I still give benefit of doubts cause it's 4 stars.... Can't be that bad. Once the food came, the presentation of the food was horrible. I mean HORRIBLE! Not even good enough for Instagram. For the Benedict, the crab, avocado, and poached egg was placed messily. And the \"homemade fries\" seems like just steamed potatoes (tasteless). My French toast wasn't bad itself but thinking the seasonal fruits is mixed fruits... It's only strawberries, sour ones too. They should describe their entree as French toast with strawberries topping instead of seasonal fruits. (My opinions). Lastly, the bill came out with a total $55. So not worth my money for sure. Never again I will come back here.", "author": "Carol Y."}

My friend and I got to the restaurant a bit before 12PM, and were seated in 30-40 minutes. There were about 15 parties ahead of us on the sign-in sheet. The guy calling out names was too dedicated to his job; he went into nearby bars and shops to check if someone on the list was in there! Luckily, some people didn't show up!\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a seat on the patio (nice, on a sunny day), but I have to agree with Christine, this place is a bit squishy so it's best to come with just a few people. \n\nI ordered the La Mer poached eggs w/ 2 eggs (eggs benedict) since it was on the 7x7 while my friend ordered 2 pieces of the French Toast Tahiti,\n\n(WOOT!) La Mer [$17]: It was tiny, but surprisingly good! The english muffin was cooked perfectly. It wasn't soggy or too crispy; it was perfect enough to cut through it without any difficulty. The eggs and the hollandaise complemented each other as usual, and the crab gave it an extra kick.\n\n(WOOT!) French Toast Tahiti [$10]: It had a sort of paste with chopped nuts in between each piece of toast to give it more flavor. I probably could have eaten it without the maple syrup, but I'm just too used to pouring it all over my breakfast.\n\nWe also had the 2 mimosas ($6/glass).

Am I just crazy? I mean when the menu says you have your choice of toast with your eggs, and the waiter offers you 2 different kinds (which is all they have), wouldn't you be a little shocked when your bill comes back with an extra charge for $1.10 for it? We were given the choice of sides with out eggs, so we chose a small fruit cup. Oh wait that's also $2.50 extra. My girlfriend didn't want cheese on her eggs (she's lactose intolerant), well that counts as a substation - another extra $1.00. For real?!?!\n\nWe obviously complained to the snobby waiter we had, so he took the bill back, and returned with a new bill where he gave us $0.75 off. No joke 75 cents!!!!!!\n\nWith how snippy the waiter was, mixed with the nickel and dime billing, and how utterly pertinacious this place is - I mean they acted like we should have been honored to be there - they won't be seeing us anymore.\n\nThe wait stuff acts like you being there is bothering them.

The eggs served on the side were great with whole roasted garlic cloves - YUM.\n\nService was crazy fast.  As I said, we were seated quickly because we were 2 but then when we ordered, we were served our meals in minutes, as if we were the only people they were cooking for.  The servers were friendly and attentive.\n\nI am not giving up on this place though.  Too many people have good things to say and keep going back.  Maybe they just weren't having the best day.", "author": "Jenni S."}

Never disappointed! Every time I go there I feel like overeating because it's that good.\n\nBrian is a good server and recommends awesome dishes. He's very thoughtful and caring for making sure his customers are satisfied. He would give us time even when it's super busy. \n\nSo the last time I was there, the restaurant was packed, and there was a billing snaffu where I was overcharged accidentally for an item. I realized it a few days later after doing expenses and so I emailed Suhail, the events coordinator, about my issue since there was no other email address I could find. A few days later, Jen, the owner, emailed me and told me she would refund me the overcharge + tips. Now that is excellent customer service! Jen and I also had a good conversation on the phone too. She's very amiable and cool. This is why I love the small, quaint restaurants in SF. Zazie's is very awesome!", "author": "J T."}

It was a busy Saturday night, and we had reservations for 7:30. Three of our party arrived at 7:20 and the fourth member arrived at 7:35. We had menus and water almost right away, but we weren't greeted by our waiter for at least 25 minutes (something all of us remarked on). When he did finally come by, however, he apologized for making us wait and was friendly and very helpful in guiding us through the menu. Overall, he did a great job.\n\nThroughout the meal, however, the delays continued. We all noticed that there was a fairly slow pace to the service - with significant gaps between courses and a long delay before our dessert order was taken. We figured the kitchen was either super busy -- or it was just Zazie's way of embracing its Frenchness -- i.e., embracing the notion that meals and diners should not be rushed. Either way, we were having a good time and weren't too concerned. \n\nWe finally finished dessert and paid our check and were wrapping up our conversation when the owner (Jen) approached our table, and without even introducing herself announced in a rude and annoyed tone, \"Um, we have another reservation that needs to be seated at this table. You've been here over two hours. You need to go.\" And that was about all she said before turning her back on us. \n\nThis treatment would have been frustrating in and of itself, but the fact that meal had been so long due to what appeared to be delays in either their kitchen or waitstaff made it seem truly unfair. We would have been completely understanding if Jen had approached us in a more respectful manner and politely explained that she hated to rush us but it was a very busy evening and they didn't want to keep the next reservation waiting too long. We'd totally get that. But her tone of annoyance and her implication that we, the diners, had done something knowingly wrong left all of us with a very bad taste in our mouth. Unfortunately what had been a celebratory dinner turned into a very negative experience. I expected better from them - and I certainly would have expected that the owner of the establishment would have taken better care of her customers. As it is, I'm not sure we'll be back.", "author": "Laura M."}

Being late to the game however, I recently discovered dinner here. I highly recommend Zazie for dinner if you are looking for something outside of the Mina, Blvd, Dankos circuit. Zazie belongs and ranks high in the Cafe Claude, La'rdoise and Bistro Central Parc club. The restaurant evokes charm and warmth and serves up delicious french influenced homestyle cooking. \n\nI highly suggest having dinner on the patio during a warmer night in SF (few and far between, I know). Currently (month of November), they are featuring their Autumn menu. We were able to enjoy Butternut squash soup with curry (delicious!!), a beef shank and vegetable stew, as well as the porcini mushroom ravioli dish. For dessert, we ordered the warm ginger cake with coffee gelato. This dessert was incredibly good and seasonally fitting. We were satisfied with our meal and the service. It was certainly a treat to dine at Zazie for dinner.\n\nBottom line: Not a trendy restaurant by any means but a homey french bistro that serves good food with fresh seasonal ingredients.

She did it fairly soon after my posting, I just haven't had a chance to update this. \n\nShe was apologetic and wanted to make it up to me by sending me a coupon for a free slice of coffee cake. I haven't had the chance to use it, but I really appreciate the fact that she is concerned about the reviews, both good and bad, and really reaches out to her patrons (even out-of-towners like me!) to make sure I have the best experience possible. I still don't like that it happened (which is why this is 4 instead of a 5), but Jen reacted quickly and made me feel like she wanted to make the wrong right. Which she did. Thank you and I look forward to going back!\n\n\nI had to have their coffee cake. So my friend dropped me off, since parking is sooooo bad in that area, to check to see if they even had it at 5:00 pm on a Saturday. I went in, since the door was open. They were getting ready to re-open at 5:30. So I asked the guy there if they served coffee cake during dinner. He said, \"Yes, I think so.\" And he, since I think he was helping clean up, asked the guy behind the counter if they served coffee cake at night. He asked him in Spanish, and since my four years of Spanish helps me in situations such as eating, when it's most important, I understand that he asked if they served it at night. And the guy behind the counter said yes, they do. And I said, so you'll have it tonight, right? And he said yes. So I said, okay, you're open at 5:30 tonight? And he said yes. So I said great, I'll be back at 5:30!\n\nWell, after driving around for 35 minutes looking for parking, the parking gods were finally merciful and granted us a spot right out in front. We walked in and the talk skinny guy with glasses asked us if we were a party of two? I said, yes, then just for grins said, \"You serve coffee cake right now?\" To which he replied, \"Oh no. We have it for breakfast, but not for dinner.\" And I said, \"Well, I came by earlier and asked someone and they said that you did.\" And he said, \"Well, they must've misunderstood you or something. And whoever said that should be spanked.\" Then I said, it's that guy right over there and pointed to the guy behind the counter. Then the guy just said, \"Oh no, we don't serve it at night.\" Needless to say, I was a little miffed. \n\nNow, after driving around for 35 minutes looking for parking in the hell that is Cole Valley where parking spaces don't fit anything bigger than a tricycle AND with gas prices this high AND me being from out of town, I don't appreciate being told that I was misunderstood. Especially since I confirmed AND was dropped off just to verify this fact. \n\nI'm giving it 1-star for this experience, since there was no apology given for the \"misunderstanding.\" See my review on their coffee cake though.

There were suppose to be pecans or walnut or something on the French toast and I didn't taste any. \n\n3. The Albert Benedict- English muffin was grossly soggy. For having many poached egg options on the menu I thought their poached eggs would be perfectly poached with a semi runny inside. Instead they were practically raw and the white was runny too. The hollandaise had no flavor whatsoever and was more like melted butter!\n\n3. La Mer Benedict- Same issues with the above. The crab and avocado were very fresh though!\n\n4. Gingerbread Pancakes- The only saving grace to our breakfast. Fluffy, tasty and moist!\n\nI don't think for the price this meal was up to par!

The restaurant's succulent Hanger Steak was  delicious, again grilled to perfection. \n\nFor dessert, the Creme Brulee and Chocolate Mousse were the highlights of the day, each very smooth and creamy. Zazie deserves a try from anyone far and wide. It is a true insight into the sheer depth of the San Francisco culinary scene.", "author": "Garrett P."}

Regardless- the former of these two phrases would completely sum up my mother's view on beloved breakfast. Not only is the the most important meal of the day- according to my mother, it's the only meal of the day and should be eaten for lunch, dinner, and dessert as well.\n\nSo taking my mother out to breakfast to celebrate Mother's Day was really a decision made for me. Fellow Yelpers- you did not steer us wrong with Zazie- what an amazing little place!\n\nZazie has a \"small beach town place\" feel tucked into San Francisco's very own Cole Valley. The atmosphere immediately put this small-town girl at ease- it's a comfortable, cozy, and friendly joint. It also has a local feel to it- which is always a plus in my book.\n\nMy mom and I arrived at 9:30 a.m. on a Saturday and we're seated nearly immediately. (I dropped her off, parked the car, walked back to the restaurant, and she had already been seated.) Mind you- parking in Cole Valley isn't easy...though it is doable! I can absolutely see why people recommend getting their early- as the morning meal went onwards, more and more people waited around outside for a table.\n\nMom ordered the special of the day- an omelette with apple-chicken sausage, red peppers, avocado and more. I ordered the 1/2/3 special (1 pancake, 2 eggs, 3 strips of bacon- which I substituted with sausage). Although I am not usually a breakfast fan, I absolutely loved my meal. Oh- and mom's potatoes? AMAZING. (Rosemary always makes roasted potatoes so good!)\n\nI will not hesitate to tell friends and family about this place, and will certainly return with breakfast enthusiasts. :)", "author": "Annalise F."}

Unfortunately, I left a disappointed. I don't mind going to a nice restaurant and throwing down $50+ for food, but it needs to be good food. Zazie had good decor and service, but the food was uninspiring and at times inedible.\n\nPat\u00e8 de Volaille: chicken liver and brandy pat\u00e9 on grilled garlic levain - I'm not a pate fan.  It leaves a bad aftertaste in my mouth.  My friend, however, loved it.  To each their own.\n\nGrilled Hanger Steak w/ mashed potatoes, green beans, and portobello brandy cream sauce - You can never go wrong with steak and potatoes.  The dish was good.  Very filling, but there was nothing excellent or inspiring about this dish.\n\nFresh Black Truffle and Porcini Raviolis w/wilted arugula, wild mushrooms, garlic, and aged parmesan - This dish looked watery. Never a good look for a pasta.  Needless to say, my friend who ordered this dish didn't finish it. \n\nBaked Chocolat Chaud- our signature \"hot chocolate\" w/ golden marshmallows - WAY too sweet.  My friend and I split this and we couldn't even finish it between the two of us.  The chocolate pudding and marshmallows were so sweet it was sickening.  I noticed other people who ordered this dessert didn't finish it either.\n\nDecadent Vanilla Creme Brulee w/ fresh berries - I am picky about my creme brulee since it's once of my favorite desserts.  Zazie's creme brulee needed a thicker layer of crunchy sugar on top, but was totally forgettable otherwise.\n\nSkip dinner, but definitely try this place for brunch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-19", "description": "Zazie is the least known best French restaurant in San Francisco.  Widely known for it's brunch excellence, the restaurant's dinner service has a much smaller, if not less enthusiastic, following.  The tiny kitchen produces a wide array of slow-cooked meats and excels in producing such Gallic staples as French onion soup, moules marinieres, & cassoulet.  Service is attentive & timely, and the entire staff appears to have been trained to create a warm, inviting atmosphere that caters to a loyal neighborly clientele.\nA couple of pointers: if you are seeking avant garde preparation (sous vide) and artistic presentation, this is not your best bet.  Instead, make this your authentic rural French staple.  If you are overly concerned with refined ambiance that borders on snobbishness, stay away.  Oh, and do yourself a favor and request the back patio for your dinner rez; it is quite magical.", "author": "Tudor J."}

If you haven't been here, try it out soon because you're missing out.\n\nThe atmosphere is very relaxed and social and the waiter provided excellent service. On a nice day, you can sit outside and enjoy a warm summer breeze with your coffee and pancakes.\n\nAbout those pancakes: Among many great choices, I decided to try the Buttermilk Pancakes with Fresh Fruit (Available as 1, 2, or 3- I had three). The pancakes are fluffy with subtle flavors, not too dry, but just moist enough to complement the butter and syrup. Actually, go lite on the syrup because they have something better. Zazie has a fresh berry jam that one must try on the pancakes! It's better than maple syrup. Regarding the \"fresh fruit\" aspect of the pancakes: The fruit includes sliced pare, apple, orange, and other fruits. Personnel, I prefer fresh seasonal berries (strawberries).\n\nOverall, highly recommended and I will return.", "author": "Nathan E."}

Caramelized bananas on top with a walnut filling, drizzled with sweet, sweet syrup.  YUM.  If you're not gonna order it, that's fine.  But REALLY?  You're just gonna sit there with your poached eggs or whatnot?  It's your loss if you don't order it.  \n\nWhat else is there that is not said about Zazie already?  The other items for brunch are good, not super duper fantastic.  I've only tried the La Mer and the New York scrambled eggs dish.  I'm actually not a huge fan of the La Mer, but a lot of people seem to like it.  The made-in-heaven combo of cream cheese and smoked salmon made the scrambled eggs dish a star.  I wouldn't mind having that again. Food comes with a side of home fries, which is typical.  But what I LOVE is that they give you cloves of garlic along with it.  It goes so well with the potatoes.  As a die-hard garlic fan, I actually wish they gave me a side of roasted garlic instead.  \n\nSo there is one gripe:  They don't seat you if your party is not all present.  Understandable, since they usually have a long wait list.  My friend walked away for a moment and so we got skipped.  But then later on, the guy who seats everybody proceeds to seat another group that was missing one person...ugh.  How shady.  He's an exception though.

Located in the heart of Cole Valley, an amazing spot for brunch/lunch.  With a sunny interior with seat cushions, hardwood floors, tables for families, and couples; a back patio to enjoy your food in the sun complete with umbrellas for those who don't want to get too warm; and a front dining area on the sidewalk to people watch, I was pleased.  Although I haven't tried it for dinner, I imagine that the place dims the lights and turns it into a mood-setting spot.  Maybe romantic?  \n\nWe had the Fresh Grilled Tuna Sandwich (with tomatoes provencales, aioli, and sun dried tomato pesto with greens on toasted levain for $11) and a large size of the Gingerbread Pancakes (with bosc pears and lemon curd for $13).  I like to eat healthy/organic when I can, and everything that we had tasted fresh - like it had just been picked from the trees and the bread had been freshly baked.  Also, I appreciate that portions were not too large, so I didn't feel stuffed after.  Although it wasn't enough for a doggy bag (is that what they're called still?  take out box?), it was perfect for an afternoon meal.  I felt energized and ready to go after!  A nice afternoon treat is to walk to Golden Gate Park after - it was only about a 10 minute walk away.\n\nGranted, Cole Valley is a residential area for families and children, this spot was a bit more mature and I didn't see any kids when I went here.

I've actually been here twice now--once by myself right after I moved (and my husband was still wrapping up his job in DC), and then a second time with my husband and a good friend who lives in the neighborhood.\n\nThe first time I went I was underwhelmed. I got the regular French toast, and while the bread was thick, good quality bread, it was pretty standard French toast. And I felt the same about the sides.\n\nMy second experience was much, much better. First, we were lucky enough to snag one of the window seats at the front of the restaurant. And the dishes I ordered were significantly more noteworthy. I ordered the scrambled eggs with tomatoes, goat cheese, and basil. The eggs were a bit loose, but this was likely partly due to the juice from the tomatoes infusing the eggs. They didn't skimp on the goat cheese (and I love goat cheese with eggs), and the basil was a great balancing note.\n\nI also ordered the French Toast Tahiti, and it was fantastic. The thick bread absorbed the flavors from the toppings. The bananas were caramelized into sticky sweetness, and the walnuts added a nice change of texture. I'm a slow eater, and my husband remarked on how quickly I inhaled the dish. If you have a sweet tooth (which I do), this is definitely a dish to try.

The self described \"fabulous light lemon hollandaise\" is accurately named. It is fabulous and it is somehow light. Good flavor. Unfortunately the Albert part seemed a bit sparse. You have an awesome egg with awesome sauce ontop of barely anything... okay fine using the word \"barely\" is pushing it. But even to the eye it seems like not enough and the taste confirms. after having the french toast I was expecting the taste to prove the eye wrong. Not enough bacon, not enough white cheddar, not enough salsa. It was almost like they were trying to play the dish safe by avoiding having too much original flavor.

Here is our experience. We got there around 7p with our 2 well-behaved kids who were exceptionally patient and we all were so hungry. They told us that it would be 10-15 minutes wait. There were three other walk in parties after us with 5-6 people. They were all seated BEFORE US! Then a couple of reservations walked in and they were seated. WTF?? It was 50 minutes before we were seated. Then we waited in our seats, 20 minutes and no waiter. I had to ask for one. She finally came over and remarked \"good, now you must know the menu very well and can order quickly.\" We didn't appreciate her humour, at all. Overall, the grilled cheese ($10) was crappy, the french onion soup was like out of a can (6ozs for $10), the baked salmon dish was very smelly, sort of dry, bland, veggies under it was overcooked ($28), and the hamburger was bland. Seriously, my bill at Absinthe would have been far less, service would have been exceptional by this standard, and the food would have been outstanding. We will NEVER go to Zazie again. I do appreciate the progressive pricing structure and doing away with the separate tip thing.

You should try it sometime.  It's delicious.\n\nBut brunch shouldn't be the main attraction here because the dinner menu puts it to shame.  How could you choose eggs and potatoes over roasted trout or hanger steak or the true king of the menu, the lamb tagine?  You can't.  Which is why you should go here for dinner  Also, you can make a reservation like a civilized person and not have to wait outside for 45 minutes.\n\nIn terms of food it's Southern French bistro fare mussels, figs and goat cheese, charcuterie, more cheese, duck, roast chicken, and the aforementioned trout, tagine, and steak.  Pair it with a good wine list and it's a tough menu to top.  It's well-prepared, very fresh, and served with a nice competent, casual style.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-03", "description": "I don't know what it is about French restaurants, but I'm a sucker for their charm and delicious fare. Zazie definitely hit the mark in terms of my standards for French food. The atmosphere was quaint and cozy, the servers were polite and attentive, and the food was downright tasty.\n\nOn a recent vacation to San Francisco, we made a reservation for 7pm on a Saturday night. Upon arriving, I was happy that we made a reservation considering how small the restaurant is. There is maybe 20-30 seats in the entire restaurant, and it butts up to the kitchen which takes up about 2/3 of the space of the building. Upon being seated at our table, we were presented with a beer and wine menu, and we quickly put in an order. My boyfriend went with one of the local brews and I chose a Sonoma County Pinot Noir. We both were more than happy with our selections, and when the waitress came back we put in our order, which was as follows:\n\n1) Charcuterie Plate- (Consisting of a pat\u00e9, proscuitto, salmon rillettes, olives, greens, and a side of spicy mustard): This was a great way to start the meal. My favorite of this dish was the salmon rillettes, as the dish was more salmon vs mayo, and you could taste how fresh the salmon was. The proscuitto was next in line in terms of my favorites as it hide a nice spice to it, as well as a great balance of fat and meat. The pate missed the mark in my opinion, and normally I adore pates. It was really cold when it came out and got a little liquidy as it sat there, which was offputting texture wise and the flavor wasn't as strong as I would've liked. The mustard was also incredibly strong and overpowered any meat that it was paired with, which was unfortunate. The side of greens were wonderfully dressed in a house dressing and was a great way to cleanse our palate in between the other items on the plate.\n\n2) French Onion Soup: This was your standard French Onion soup. It had a nice beef base that was well seasoned and loaded with onions. My only complaint is that the amount of cheese made it very difficult to eat, it was incredibly melty in the soup, but as soon as it touched the spoon it solidified making the balance of flavors nearly impossible to achieve. I ate about 3/4 of the soup before giving up.\n\n3) Hangar Steak: We decided to split this entree, which I'm thankful for because the portions were more than generous. The steak was sliced into seven large pieces and topped with a cream based mushroom sauce. The flavors of the steak were great on their own, and a little bit of the sauce really made the dish come together. The mashed potatoes, on the other hand, were bland and uninspired. Luckily the asparagus that was served as a side to the dish were perfectly cooked and delicious.\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert, but they had a few items that looked worth indulging in. Zazie was a great find and a fantastic meal, so if you're up for an amazing French meal, make sure to hit up Zazie with a reservation.", "author": "Megan K."}

Have only had brunch food, and I have enjoyed the pancakes (except the gingerbread), the eggs benedict of many permutations. Pancakes are delightfully fluffy with good texture and add ons. Eggs benedict is usually quite good but it depends entirely in what you get with it. The hollandaise sauce is pretty solid, and the muffin is toasted nicely, and the eggs have a well cooked white with runny yolk, but its the crab or smoked salmon that make it unique. Side note, chicken  apple sausage is small, expensive and underwhelming. The only problem is that so many people enjoy this restaurant and the wait is often over 1 hour even on a slow day.

The ambience is pleasant, whether you are inside or on the deck out back, under the heat lamps. The food is consistently good, often first-rate, and very reasonably priced. \n\nThe Mediterranean Roasted Vegetable Plate is very nice. I recall that I find one of the vegetable a little heavy on the vinegar, but in general, the piquant flavors of this dish whet the appetite, and the whole is more than the sum of the parts. The mussels are fine; I don't know what it would take for me to be blown away by mussels (though Moulin Rouge in Monterey came close). \n\nOn to what you should be there for, which changes with the season. On a chilly autumn night, order the beef shank on a puree of winter vegetables. Tender, juicy beef shank atop mashed parsnips (and maybe potato). The waitress raised her eyebrows when she saw how quickly I had eaten it. What can I say--I was cold and hungry, and the dish was de-lish.\n\nOr you can have the Hangar Steak, the accompaniments of which change with the season. I had it recently with green beans, mashed potatoes, and a portobello cream sauce; tip-top. But the best time to have it is in late summer, when it comes with a baked tomato topped with cheese (was it gruyere or gorgonzola?). Somehow, the tomato, cheese, and steak produced an out-of-this-world combination of flavors. \n\nI hope that next summer the dessert menu also includes the cherries that I had one evening last summer. All I recall are cherries, orange zest, and a bit of cinnamon; perhaps there was vanilla ice cream as well. An exquisite light dessert--hands down, the best one I have ever had. \n\nOne dish that isn't as good is the salmon en papillote, which simply lacks flavor. The lamb tagine is fine but not mind-blowing; perhaps I'm simply no longer a fan of couscous. The kale and butternut squash topped with parmesan CAN be a very interesting combination of flavors, provided you insist that they cook the veggies thoroughly. Those are two that simply can't be sauteed lightly.", "author": "Nat C."}

My boyfriends egg dish, which he's ordered before - the one with the cream cheese - was totally lacking in cream cheese.  \n\nSo he decided to comment to the server, who was kind and got him a fixed new plate, but tried to say, \"yeah - we're just so busy on the weekends\"... you mean you're so busy that brunch now is not as good as brunch at a different time?  I'm confused - are you actually saying it's not as good as it could be?  Anyway, when restaurants mess up, I wish they would just say sorry - be honest, not try and cover it up.  \n\nWe will be back because I do really enjoy it here...but I'm wary...\n+++\nFor a nice Frenchie experience, I love Zazie.  The staff is just un-attentive enough and the brunch food is fabulous and decadent - each item I've tried has been perfect.  \n\nI especially like that you can order the french toast, panckes and egg dishes with 1, 2 or 3 of the item.  So big and small appetites get just what they need and no food has to go to waste.  Also, this makes it great to share - order an egg dish and one challah french toast and you have your perfectly balanced breakfast.  The potatoes are divine with pan roasted whole cloves of garlic.  YUM!  \n\nYes there is a wait, but I don't mind as they move people through quickly and efficiently without feeling rushed.\n\nSo, why not 5 stars?  I have yet to sit on the patio and I think I should try dinner before fully committing.  The space is a bit cramped & can be loud as well - like last weekend having to listen to some guy blather on about his Mr. Smartypants thoughts.", "author": "Mac M."}

I made a reservation by phone ahead of time but the only time they could guarantee me was at 7. I knew that they don't ever reserve all of their tables so I figured if we came early then we could still get a table. We arrived a little before five thirty and sat at their curbside seating until they opened their doors. We were the only people there and they didn't mind seating us right away.\n\nThe waitress got us water right away (which was awesome because it was a long walk). We were able to drink water and talk as we enjoyed the decor which included quirky photos and peculiar architecture. The people that trickled in after we did were generally older but in great spirits (especially after the spirits). The waitress came by often enough that she knew when we were ready to order and when we needed more water. The food came quickly and the complimentary bread kept the hunger at bay in the meantime.\n\nShe got the porcini ravioli. It came on a large plate so it looked nicely prepared but small. It ended up not being too small at all and maybe even a little too much if dessert is added on. I got the tomato fennel soup and the roasted trout. Honestly it was all ridiculously good. The ravioli screamed of natural umami and the trout had a super yummy crispness in the skin (also no stray bones). The soup was very flavorful and all of the veggies were nicely prepared. We also got some bread pudding for dessert and it was fantastic.\n\nThey were prompt about giving and taking the check but not pushy for us to leave so we could stay around and talk.

She had a simple request, she gets ill from asparagus and asked to change to the spinach which I had on my dish. The waiter refused. I asked why and all he did was pick up a menu and point to the phrase saying \"no substitutions.\" I said that is not the reason why, how come. His snotty toned response was the kitchen is too small to make substitutions. Both my parents are chefs and I was literally raised in restaurants my whole life. I can affirm without any doubt that it takes no more effort to put a spoon of spinach on a plate as it does a few spears of asparagus.\n\nConsidering that the wildly popular EOS just went out of business a few doors down, this restaurant, no matter how loved it may be, needs to learn the lesson of what CUSTOMER SERVICE and LOYALTY to neighborhood customers means! A vegetable substitution is not a big request. But, let me explain to the owners and the management, that it indeed cost them a lot! Our bill was approx $100 that night.

Having had three superlative dinners at Zazie, I'm eager to come back for their much-lauded brunch service.\n\nFood:\nThe real draw of Zazie is the food; I've never disliked anything that has come out of their kitchen, over the course of three visits with friends who aren't shy about sharing.  French onion soup, salads aplenty, fruit crumbles, corn cakes, lamb curries, pork chops, and burgers with white cheddar - every dish has been expertly executed, and crafted from ingredients of the highest quality.  The flavors (across the menu) are marvelously nuanced - with every bite, you can discern the spices and foods that make it up, if you put your mind to it, but you find yourself unable to fathom how such simple parts can make such a satisfying, balanced whole.\n\nDecor:\nCute, provincial furnishings, with lots of wood and soft yellow colors, hint at the French countryside, though maybe that tone is set more firmly by the framed French-language movie posters hanging on the walls, including a couple featuring the restaurant's namesake: the protagonist of a 1960 film by Louis Malle.  The key here, as with the cuisine, is subtlety: the design is understated, and avoids the heavy-handedness often found in themed or chain restaurants.  It feels cozy and vaguely domestic in the main room, and there's an undeniably romantic quality to the excellent outdoor patio (well equipped with greenery, strings of bare bulbs, and space heaters).\n\nService:\nThe wait staff have all been wonderful, every time.  Friendly, efficient, and attentive.\n\nPrice:\n$$$\n\nOverall:\nZazie is very, very good at what it does, and the only reason I won't give it a perfect five-star rating is because \"what it does\" is relatively safe.  I tend to think of five stars as denoting chefs and owners who take risks which pay off, and Zazie's team seems more intent on keeping the overall quality of the food consistently high than with wowing foodies with an always-dramatically-evolving menu.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, so don't let the four-star rating mislead you: I highly recommend Zazie for an intimate dinner (grab a table on the patio) or an evening with friends (laugh over wine and shared appetizers in the main room).", "author": "Will T."}

I must have been in a really pissy mood because every other meal I've had since that day has been phenomenal.  The French toast Tahiti with the just the right sweet and tender caramelized bananas texturally went really well with the crunch of the almonds.  The New York and Greek scrambles are great for a salt lover like me.  Lunchtime fare is equally well executed.  Today, it was Croque Royale--a rich concoction of grilled bread, prosciutto, tomatoes provencale and gruyere.  It would have been perfect had it not been for the tomato slices that made the whole thing a little too wet and soggy for my taste.  A leisurely lunch at 2PM was a wise decision, as both parking and seating were both ample.  The service as usual is friendly, relaxed and casual.  At the end of my meal and after handing my empty and licked up plate to our waiter, I joked, \"It wasn't very good, just kidding.\"  \"OK then, no charge.

And as an added bonus to them - five stars and my 100th review!! I was saving that honor for something special and they have earned it my friends. Even though they are astoundingly awesome and popular and I'm pretty sure they just made it into the 7x7 whatever AND even though it was brunch time on a Sunday - only a 20 minute wait. I was pleasantly surprised...and almost a little nervous...and to write a fair yelp review I of course had to try nearly one of everything. Ya know. For research purposes and all. \n\nDown to business...got the Tahitian French Toast, Gingerbread pancake and um...what I kept calling the Jew Benadict. Because I'm Jewish and so I can get away with that and it was lox and caper deliciousness. And the french toast was with challah - even more jewliciousness!! And to ease your minds - I ordered one piece of each and shared the french toast and the pancake. It was still a shit ton of food but soooo good and worth every damn calorie. I should mention - the Tahitian French toast was described as stuffed french toast but that's not what it was. It was more of a sandwich with filling in the middle but really - big deal - it was still damn good. And another weird point - I got the salad with the single (!) benedict and the lemony dressing was fresh and kind of perfect with all the other heavy breakfast food I was shoveling down my gullet. \n\nAnd my last and final point (and a note to all other restaurants) it is fully, awesomely, amazingly fantastic that they serve things in ones, twos or threes. I have never in my life seen benedict served as one (or really a half I guess?) and it is like the coolest thing ever. It didn't cut the cost in half - and really it shouldn't since you're getting the salad or home fries - but it was the perfect amount to eat and then not feel guilty about eating a pancake also.

But when we walked in, it was packed and grew into this beautiful, cozy, approachable dining atmosphere.  And when I say cozy, I mean cozy- not to much space between tables.  The menu had so many delicious options, and we knew we'd try some kind of benedictine blessing.  We opted for the specials du jour- Eggs en Fonte (mushrooms, spinach, polenta cake, in a tomato sauce, baked with over easy eggs) and Eggs Divorcee (english muffin, bacon, avocado, fontina, with hollandaise) AND one piece of the Challah French Toast. I really like how you can order how many poached eggs you'd like - one two or three. You can really control your portions and order more to share! \n\nYou know that feeling when you're hungry, but you don't really know if you want to eat what you're about to eat, but only because your stomach can't make up it's mind?!  That was me.  I wanted the Eggs en Fonte because it seemed different, and Eggs Divorcee because they were supposed to have good poached eggs on muffins.  That feeling of ambiguity quickly dissipated as I took my first bites of our dishes.  I was so blown away by the Eggs en Fonte!! That tomato sauce and the runny eggs were perfectly soaked up by the polenta cake.  Yum.  The Eggs Divorcee had perfectly poached eggs on a perfect crispy muffin.  And the home fries had a surprise full head of roasted garlic hiding inside.  YUMMMO.  The French Toast was what I expected.. classic, but still exceptionally done.\n\nFriendly service and atmosphere, yummy, yet slightly pricey food. Worth the splurge for those special mornings.

Califrench fusion, I would call it.\n\nTheir house bubbly is better than some of the by the bottle varieties at other SF restaurants, which makes their mimosas and other juice/bubbly blends terribly, awfully, DUI-inducingly delicious.  But please, don't drink and drive.\n\nGo for the elderberry. Oh, and note that the glasses for your mimosa blends aren't traditional (small) champagne flutes - they are much bigger, beautiful glasses in the Bodum tradition.\n\nSpeaking of drinks, if you're looking for a hangover-healing bloody mary on a weekend morning, you can get that too - made with Soju.  Deelish.\n\nAny of their poached eggs will delight - over the past four years I've had them all.  La Mer - with crab, avocado, and their delicious, light hollandaise. \n\nEverything tastes fresh, clean, and hits home in the culinary gut.  \n\nThe service is also really good - which I define as:  attention when you need it, space when you need it, and pleasant all the time.  Pretty simple.  \n\nBetween Zazie and Universal Cafe, this tummy has all she needs for brunch in the city.", "author": "Jessie S."}

Also, DISHONEST - THESE PEOPLE ADDED THEIR OWN TIP ONTO MY CREDIT CARD SLIP. Had to dispute the tip amount through my credit card company. This is a matter of principle for me b/c frankly, it is a waste of my time to be making calls and faxing receipts over a small amount but I am appalled by this unethical behavior on Zazie's part.\n\nRudeness #1: I was accused by the host of adding my name to the top of the wait list. Our party of 2 put our name on the waiting list (wait at 10:45AM weekday was about 30 minutes). I had to move the car, and when I got back, I checked the list and thought our name had already been crossed off. I started to write my name again, saw that we were still on the list, stopped, put the list+pen back down, and then the host came, got the list, and called our name. I guess since he saw me with the pen just before he called our name, he was confused, but he was very rude - no smile, just an accusation that we jumped the line. I felt uncomfortable as I explained that I had just gotten back from moving our car. I then asked him if the spot I snagged directly in front of him was an ok spot (I'm new to SF driving), and he dismissively stated, \"I can't help.\" WHOA -   So we're off to a bad start before even being seated. Then we get the worst seat in the house - small, right next to the door, too drafty for my 82 year old grandmother. But the host has already left.\n\nRudeness #2: I snag down a server's attention (not our server b/c he hasn't introduced himself yet despite our being seated for 15 minutes). This server refused to reseat us to the table front of us, away from the door's breeze. The man I asked just curtly said no, that table was intended for three people (vs. our two). I can understand that, but he wouldn't reseat us to another two-person table, despite there being two available tables. Keep in mind, we had not received our food yet, so this would have involved minimal effort on their part. I was close to leaving right then, but this place was my grandmother's choice for new brunch place to try.\n\nRudeness #3: We received NO SERVICE WHATSOEVER from our waiter. We were there for 90 minutes (from the moment we sat down to our drafty table to the moment I stalked out after paying) and the waiter came to our table ONLY TWICE - once to take our order and once to drop off the bill. My water glass remained unfilled for over an hour, and we only got our bill because I walked to the back and requested it from the host. The waiter never smiled at us during these two brief encounters.\n\nOther Disgusting Behavior: I saw another server put his finger in someone else's food. The bathroom is right next to the kitchen and the serving station (gross), and as I stood waiting for the bathroom, one of the servers picked up a plate and his fingers were clearly in the eggs on that plate. Keep in mind I just saw that server handling money earlier. How unsanitary. \n\nFinally, I was so fed up over everything that I decided to let my money do the talking. I left a one-cent tip on my credit card slip. I have never, ever stiffed on a tip b/c I was a server for years - I know people raise their family off of tips. But this experience was too unpleasant. My grandmother, who had so looked forward to trying Zazie, had a terrible time, and said this restaurant was the worst dining experience she's had in 82 years.\n\nEven after all of this, I was not going to write a negative Yelp review. But then I discovered their unethical behavior. \n\n******************Dishonesty #1: Weeks later, upon reviewing my credit card bill, I discovered someone decided to add their own tip to my credit card slip. The total I was charged did not reconcile with what I authorized. I was and still am enraged. I disputed the charge through my credit card company, and I have filed a complaint to the credit card processor.**************************************************************\n\nDishonesty #2: Their dishonesty with the tip leads me to believe that they are dishonest in general. The table next to ours received a bill that had several drinks on it that they did not order. They complained, and the server apologized. At the time, I assumed it was an honest mistake, but who knows? Too many coincidences. Notably, that table and I shared the same server.", "author": "B B."}

But they were under construction back then and so we were forced to try again.  Went today after perusing Yelp reviews for the best options and had the Tahiti French Toast and Greek Scramble with home fries and wheat toast.\n\nTahiti French Toast:  Quite tasty.  Smallish portion in the two piece (medium) option, but enough to get a good taste.  I've had better french toast in the city (Brenda's, Dottie's...), and this one did not \"Wow\" me.  My gf felt the same.\n\nGreek Scramble:  The eggs were fine, but not abundant.  The toast was toast.  The best thing was the potatoes, which featured whole roasted garlic cloves (still in skin, so be aware).  This entree was definitely nothing spectacular, but the eggs were soft and overall it was pleasant enough.\n\nCoffee:  Oh lordy, what horrid coffee!  I haven't had their espresso drinks, but having had their regular coffee I would definitely recommend having something other than that.  Uck.  There's not enough sugar and cream in the world to make slightly burnt coffee taste good.  Also they only offer packets of white sugar as your non-diet sweetening option.\n\nOverall I'd say - Go to Zazie if you're in it for the potatoes, happen to be right outside the door when hunger hits you, or you just don't have the energy to find somewhere better.  For Vegetarians I'd recommend Boogaloo's, Dottie's or Brenda's French Soul Food as awesome alternatives.", "author": "K W."}

This place is an oasis and the outdoor seating is not overcrowded with tables.\n\nZazie has a wonderful dinner menu that changes frequently. The Figs Figaro appetizer was delicious - it had very tasty goat cheese and the mission figs were delightful. I had the lemon ricotta ravioli and my spouse had the summer corn cakes. Both entrees were absolutely delicious, flavorful and fresh. We ended our meal with dessert and it was absolutely worth it. My spouse had the raspberry chevre cheesecake - so good. And I had the cherries, almonds and flower petals with a lovely creme fraiche - very light and so delightful. The staff there is amazingly attentive and the service is very friendly. I will definitely return to Zazie in the near future and I've already recommended it to several friends traveling to the Bay Area - what an amazing gem in Cole Valley!", "author": "Katy J."}

So 1 star for lovely ambience.\n\nThe menu has quite a variety of breakfast/brunch treats. I like how you can choose the size portions - it allows you to mix & match sweets and savouries. I had a cafe au lait which was very delicious. Its also huge, so for $4 or $5 its a good deal. Another star\n\nI was with two other people and we shared a plate of eggs benedict with tomato and prosciutto - it was very tasty (third star). For myself, I ordered a toasted baguette with butter and jam.  Food takes a long time to arrive - which is nice if you want to have a slow meal but not ideal if you are rather hungry. The hot meals the other two had ordered came and after about a 5 minute wait, I caught the attention of the hostess to ask if my toast was still on its way. A few minutes later it arrived without jam. Ha. So I asked another waiter for jam. That was definitely disappointing - I figured something as basic as my order would not be so delayed. Its always a bit awkward waiting around for the final plate on the table to arrive.\n\nAll in all, the food/menu is great and the setting is cozy but it was a mediocre experience as far as service went.", "author": "Marie J."}

When we visit San Francisco, this is our number one neighborhood, bistro-style restaurant. First and foremost, the food is fantastic. Second, the service is friendly and attentive. And, finally, it's very reasonably priced for a city that is generally an expensive dining experience. Zazie is in Cole Valley, one of The City's nicest neighborhoods. Parking can be an adventure, but, if you arrive for an early dinner, you can usually find a non-metered parking space within a couple of blocks. On our last visit, I had their soup du jour and the fish soup entree. Many restaurants over salt their soup, but Zazie served a perfectly balanced tomato-based, white bean and kale soup. The fish stew can best be described as a cross between a bouillabaisse  and a cioppino. My wife had a delicious cheese ravioli with a lemon-wine sauce. The menu offers lots of option including a very reasonable fixed price choice of three courses. There's a very nice selection of wines that are not over priced. Try this restaurant for a intimate dinner with your sweetie or bring the whole family.", "author": "Barry V."}

There were a number of choices, I was concerned because one of us was vegetarian, and we were all really happy.\n\nThe service is relaxed and friendly. Just the right amount of attention. We were never wondering where the waitress was. \n\nI had Cassoluet which was delicious and only needed just a trifle more salt. The beans were perfectly cooked and the duck was tender and juicy.The chicken liver pate was also quite nice, but I would've preferred to spread it on the bread myself, rather than having it come to the plate partly melted on the warm toast. It's a minor quibble. \n\nOthers at our table had salmon in parchment over spinach a dish called Chicken with Grandma Sauce (it sounds better in French) and Polenta cakes. Everyone seemed to love everything they had. \n\nThe wine we wanted turned out to be on special that night and the bottles were $10 off, so we had two!

Yummy!\n\nWe were both so torn about what to order that we decided to split a medium order of the gingerbread pancakes (medium was the rec of our server & I VERY much appreciate her warning:  we couldn't finish the medium, and never would have made a dent in the large we initially intended to order).

Trish the Brunch Dish was in town and the rare Ligaya Time was set! \n\nMy ginger pancakes (x2) with Bosch pear and lemon sauce was delicious, though I would recommend getting just one pancake instead of two since it's a lot of carbs and getting eggs or other items with it instead. \n\nThe menu was set up so that you can have a la carte on a little of everything instead of just eating 7 French toasts by yourself. \nLigs' poached eggs looked delicious! I'm totally getting those next time! \n\nThe wait is definitely more bearable than Brenda's. The two front small tables, the inside, and the patio made it accommodating, especially with heating lamps in the patio. The restroom was clean and decorative as well!

Figuring it would be a long wait, we put our name down and prepared ourselves. However, we were seated within 15 minutes, which is awesome considering the typical wait for a popular brunch locale in the city (lucky us we were only a party of two though).\n\nWe ordered the gingerbread pancakes with the lemon curd and bosc pears, as well as the Florentine Benedict (had to cross one off of the list for the 7x7!). The Benedict was great - lighter hollandaise sauce, perfectly poached free range eggs and uber-garlicy home fries. The gingerbread pancakes were equally amazing: oversized ginger bread pancake served with a huge dollop of lemon curd and half a poached bosc pear. The flavor combination was heaven! \n\nThe atmosphere at Zazies is very cute: French cafe with sky lights and an unforgettable back patio. This is an excellent brunch choice!", "author": "Amanda D."}

I'm extremely critical when it comes to my reviews and don't take them lightly.  I was extremely surprised when I came here to say the least.\n\nTwo of my friend's and I came here on mother's day this year.  As I arrived with one friend, we had the option of sitting outside as it was first-come-first-serve.  Luckily, a table had just gotten up.  Within a matter of moments the table was cleared and we were given menus.  When my third friend arrived, the server walked out immediately with another menu for him as well.  \n\nAs far as service is concerned, our server was amazing.  He seemed to know exactly when to come by.  Any time a dish was finished we showed up to clear it.  Any time we needed a refill, he was there.  Even better was how he handled dessert.  He brought out our check and asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu.  When we said no, he had the check so we didn't have to wait for him to go back and retrieve it.  This is one of the key characteristics of an excellent server.  Amazing....\n\nAs for the food, I was really impressed.  All of our dishes were excellent.  The croque royale, eggs benedict, and such were to-die-for.  We ordered a bit of french toast as our dessert to share when we placed our brunch order.  It was quite excellent as well.\n\nThere were only 2 things I didn't like about this place.  Firstly, they don't take Amex.  This can be easily remedied, but we shall see.  Secondly, I don't really like the fact that the bathroom is right next to the food expedition window, but the place is small so I can understand.  While waiting for the bathroom, in fact, I saw they had scored a health score rating of 100, so that made me feel better.\n\nIf you're looking for a brunch place and have not come here, you're missing out!", "author": "Brent A."}

Ordered the French Toast Tahiti, the famous gingerbread pancakes, a special-of-the-day egg scramble, and the Zazie spritzer. Food came within a reasonable time frame (about 15-20 minutes). The French Toast Tahiti was amazing, and I definitely recommend this if you like bananas and walnuts (some people hate bananas, crazy I know) because this dish was the highlight of the meal. The gingerbread pancakes were very dense and probably the worst pancakes I've ever had in my life. Fortunately, the waiter did not charge us for these substandard pancakes so kudos for that. And finally, the egg scramble was made of red peppers, Aidell's chicken-apple sausage (a complete fail), and onions.The scramble was extremely greasy and lacked good flavor. Order the home fries because they are actually some really good potatoes and not fries as the name would lead you to believe. The Zazie spritzer was a sparkling beverage made of cranberry and orange juice. It was really good, and I recommend it if you're looking for a non-alcoholic mimosa-like beverage.

Plainly, it's not worth the wait or the crowd. Simply put, go somewhere else - you're not missing out. \n\nMy biggest beef with the food is that it's all too prepared. It feels very heavy and processed: to me it lacked the light hand of a home-kitchen, which is what I'd expect from a SF mom-and-pop joint.\n\nSpecifically, though, I had the universally acclaimed gingerbread pancakes, french toast tahiti, and the home fries. All were quite good. \n\nThe pancakes were a tad dense, the pears added nothing special and the lemon curd didn't complete the flavors well. A fine pancake dish, but I've had better.\n\nThe french toast tahiti was fine as well. It's a bit more interesting, and indeed may be among the better french toasts I've had, but still lacked a depth/complexity that some simple modifications could have provided.\n\nThe home fries were good. I loved the cloves of garlic and the overall composition of the dish. The major problem here was execution: it was erratic and uneven. The cloves sometimes had skins that couldn't be chewed, but otherwise had ones cooked through. Likewise, the potatoes ranged from barely-finished to burnt. Not attentive cooking here. \n\nOn the whole, no major complaints. A fun place to have brunch, but if, like me, you'd like a comfortable place to kick back and have a leisurely weekend brunch, this isn't best-in-class. Come here if you will, don't if you won't.

It's a great dish and I love how you can see actual bits of fresh crab meat, however, the dish was a little bland to me (even with a splash of tobasco).  I think I'm used to a cafe in LA that has the best crabcake eggs benedict I've ever had so my expectations were a little high when I had this dish.

I'm not a huge french toast fan but I've tried a lot and this was so good that I took a few more bites than I normally do of it.\n\nLastly, the mexican omlette was absolutely delicious.

By far, my favorite dish was one of their specials, a challah bread pudding with fontina cheese and fried eggs on top that was out of this world. The PERFECT use of cheese in a dish. \n\nAs for the atmosphere, I must say... well... the wait can be pretty painful. Go early, avoid the line if you can.

Stop by and put your name on the list.  The note posted next to the list informs you that you might be waiting awhile, since their \"best guess\" is 3 minutes of wait time for each party on the list.  We showed up at 9:20 am on a Saturday and waited about 5-7 minutes.  The people who showed up at 10 loitered on a sidewalk. waiting for their name to be called.  It looked like it could take awhile.\n\nZazie looks like a real French bistro.  There are tiny wooden tables that have seen better days.  There is a tiny spiral staircase that seemingly leads nowhere.  There is a tiny patio that is always full.  There are tiny French movie posters that add a flair of sophistication.  You can almost imagine yourself having breakfast in Paris . . .  \n\n[snaps fingers].  Snap out of it and look around!  Sleepy American couples, sporting bed hair, pajama pants and once-white t-shirts, are drinking coffee trying to wake up.  You know what helps me wake up in the morning?  A shower!  Dorothy, I don't think we're in Paris anymore . . .   Actually, given what they think about showers in Paris . . . Ah, forget it.\n\nI ordered their Un, Deux, Trois special.  The special includes un pancake, deux eggs any style and trois bacon strips for $8.95.  I added un more pancake because I am not French and I like having hearty breakfasts.  While waiting for our food, my friend and I took the time to catch up and enjoy our drinks.  I had regular coffee served in small cups, which our waitress refilled early and often.  My friend had a mocha in a giant bowl with no handles, which looked like something you might make in a beginning pottery class at a community college.  Not sure what kind of coffee they served, but it was really good.\n\nMy meal was just OK.  Everything seemed to be slightly overcooked.  My pancakes, both of them, were charred on the bottom just enough to taste the bitterness of blackened dough.  The pancakes were very fluffy, but I just couldn't get over their burnt taste.  The scrambled eggs were a bit too hard, and even bacon was way too crispy.  Oh, and they didn't have sugar-free pancake syrup.\n\nZazie is a nice neighborhood place with a pleasant European vibe, solid service and decent food.  I live nearby, and I would probably come back here for an early breakfast some other time.  Maybe I'll even get a table on the patio . . .", "author": "Yan G."}

I had called during the week and was told that there was going to be a wait for breakfast so to get there early. So when I got there and had to add my name to the bottom of a list I wasnt surprised. The place was packed! We waited about 30-40 mins. Once we got in the place is tiny! I had to literally climb over the couple sitting next to us so I could sit at the table. THIS is the reason I give it 4 stars. We might as well have sat together at one table that was how close we were to each other. \n\nNow the food is amazing! I had the french toast tahiti style. So good and thick! Filled with bananas and walnuts. I got two slices and that was more than plenty. My better half got the Albert eggs benedict. This would be the reason why I will come back! Egg benedict filled with bacon and fresh salsa! So freaking good! The coffee came in cute bowls and it was plenty. Its a tad pricey for being a breakfast spot but its totally worth it! The only thing is the space. Even walking out we had to wait for the line of waitresses to get the food from the line and move.

I think the locals love this place because it is the only breakfast place around this neighborhood with variety in its menu. I have been here a couple of times for brunch to meet friends who live in the city. I had to drive in. I have not been impressed by the food. I know tons of better breakfast places both in and out of the city that cost less. Breakfast with coffee cost me $22 including tax, tip, and health tax. I had one of the breakfast specials today, the Eggs En Fonte (?), which came in a skillet about 4 inches in diameter. The amount of food that occupied the skillet did not fill in this tiny area. It basically was one tiny, thin square piece of  polenta topped with bits of mushroom and spinach with a splash of tomato sauce topped with two eggs. The taste was not awful, but I would not crave it again and would not recommend it to anyone. It came with choice of salad (just lettuce sprinkled with olive oil) or home fries. I opted for salad, but my friend chose home fries which amounted to a small pile of whole roasted garlic cloves and about three chunks of potato. The restaurant has a cool vibe. Tables are a little crowded for me, but I am a little claustrophobic. Service was odd, not quite friendly and somewhat temperamental (waitress seemed pissed off when we got there, but her mood improved by the end).

Main goal for the trip was the De Young's Impressionist exhibit on loan from the d'Orsay. \n\nAnyhow, while at breakfast we asked our friendly barista for a recommendation for lunch near GGPark and she mentioned Zazie's with a hands down affinity for the French cafe. \n\nCole Valley proved a very pleasant neighborhood and pretty accessible to the park as it is not too far from Haight or Lincoln. The address is small and quaint, while a busy flow gave the lunch crowd a good vibe. Service is casual and competent and the menu tempts indulgence. I have sworn to eat a Monte Cristo whenever I encounter one, but broke from this practice when noticing the Croque Monsieur on the sandwich list. (I just ate at Mollie's again the previous Saturday, u know!) \n\nI shot for the Nicoise as it has been quite a while since the days of Elements in Santa Barbara and their incredible red wine vin and haricot verts.

There is a garlic butter fry to the toast and the prosciutto is \"silk teddy sexy\" while the chevre has the perfect tart cream nature to coax the fig into sweet splendor.

We wrote our names on the list and waited for about an hour for our table. The two adjacent restaurants were almost completely empty, while Zazie was overflowing with hungry patrons. \n\nI got the Zazie hot tea and an elderflower mimosa, both of which were delicious. Jeremy ordered a bagel and spinach salad with walnuts, gorgonzola and pear, which he deemed \"very good.\" My bff and I each ordered a benedict with two eggs. I ordered the benedict with bacon, white cheddar and salsa and asked for my eggs to be poached easy and bff ordered the benedict with prosciutto and tomatoes provencale. I also ordered a cup of the white bean soup with kale. This is where things started going downhill. \n\nThe benedicts came before the soup and were lukewarm upon arrival. Both of our eggs were poached medium-hard, neither of our english muffins were toasted thoroughly, and the cheese was not even close to being melted. The potatoes were decent, though uninspiring and the soup (after cooling off for 20 minutes) would have been better if the beans were slightly more tender and the broth properly salted. To top it off, the server left the check on the table halfway through the meal without offering another mimosa or asking how our meal was. \n\nThat said, we went at the tail end of a busy Sunday. My bff and I both agreed that, properly prepared, the dishes had great potential. All ingredients were fresh and the hollandaise was light and tasty. When I return, during the week when they are not as busy, I vowed to order the same dishes so that I can hopefully update my review with a more positive assessment.

Sometimes more and once in a while less.  However, hungry people become angry people and I've had some very unenjoyable meals there due to the wait.  It's not the fault of Zazie at all.  They handle it quite well.  However, keep this in mind if you want to go here on the weekends.

Be prepared for a wait, but a wait that's definitely worth it. If you can, get there early on a weekend for a better possibility of fast seating.

I don't usually eat white bread, but when it's fresh, I'm totally enamored.  I think the mussels are really one of the best I've ever tried- ask for more bread to dip in the leftover cream sauce!  My favorite is the grilled hanger steak w/ mashed potatoes.  I also really like the spinach stuffed chicken and the coq au vin.  The baked hot chocolate is fantastic!  It's definitely to be shared because you can only really take a few bites of it.  The pot de cr\u00e8me and cr\u00e8me brulee are pretty delicious also.\n\nYesterday, our server noticed that my boyfriend opened a birthday card.  We didn't even ask, but when our dessert came, she brought cr\u00e8me brulee with a lit candle- free of charge!  How thoughtful!\n\nI imagine coming here many times in the future.\n\nSide note:  When I eat out, I like to have really rich food (I have a salad everyday for lunch!), and Zazie serves a pretty decadent dinner.

The tender salmon was perfectly complimented by the sweetness of the onions, the salty capsules of capers, the light yet warm English muffin, and the perfectly poached egg. This was amazing. The home fries were teased with a pinch of seasoning, while still maintaining the warm flavor of the potato.

(which are rare to find in food, but so delicious)\n\n*PATE- mmmm....when is Pate ever bad? I thought the bread it was served on could have been a little more interesting that what seemed like plain toasted breakfast bread.\n\n*MUSSELS MARINIERES- OUTSTANDING!!! Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and served warm.\n\nWhat we had for mains... (only two dishes, as the three of us are small/slow eaters and could hardly finish these despite their brilliance)....\n\n*MOROCCAN LAMB STEW- well, I make a moroccan stew at home. its not bad. but its not this good either. the lamb is soooo tender, in perfect (large) spoon sized chunks to pair with bites of flavorful couscous and ALMONDS (the apparent trick to good moroccan stew!)\n\n*GRILLED RANCH HANGER STEAK- not the most French thing on the menu, but cooked just right, with fresh asparagus (its the season, don't ya know!) and fluffy, not too buttery, mashed potatoes.\n\nWe indulged in the three desserts for a fixed price- even though we all claimed to be entirely stuffed from the meal and 2 bottles of wine (C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne is a great inexpensive red that I buy often at the market and that Zazie happily carries). I can't remember exactly what their contents included, but one was a bread pudding (3/4 stars), another was a chocolate mousse (4/4 stars), and the third was some sort of berry fruit tart concoction that deserves 5/4 stars. \n\nYeah...Zazie is pretty damn good.", "author": "Raquel C."}

They have such a charming back patio, and last night, I'm sure the weather was in the mid-50s, but their well-engineered heat lamps helped us forget we were outdoors in a SF restaurant! Love the no corkage policy! We brought in several bottles of wine, and they were so hospitable in giving us their different glasses that were appropriate for the certain pours we had - a petite syrah, a cab, and flutes for our prosecco... and the best thing? An ice bucket for the prosecco. Who wants to have warm prosecco, right??? \n\nWe had a great server, Christine (very knowledgeable and personable), and a server-in-training (who was French, nice touch!) but was very good about checking up on us, and making sure we had a great time. Given, I have the most fun group of girlfriends to dine with, all open-minded in regards to trying new foods, so we always have a fabulous time together, but the restaurant was so warm, and we started very late. I got out of yoga late, and we didn't put our orders in until at least 9:15pm when we were all settled (and the restaurant closes at 9:30pm!), but they were so attentive, up until 10:45pm. Sorry guys! We just had a good time, and so much wine to enjoy, we didn't want to leave! We'll just have to start earlier next time! Didn't really take a careful look at the dining room, but it was quite packed for a later dinner hour on a Tuesday. Not much going on in Cole Valley, but diners who know what's up. Plus, they have a strong Zagat following (which I discovered on my way out!) and I wholeheartedly feel they deserve it.\n\nMenu items we enjoyed - the French onion soup, mmmm! It was the perfect size, and the gruyere (I think) that coated it was gooey, but caked on. I was at a French bistro, so I had to have French onion, right?! My friends had the rabbit (Le Lapin- slowly braised Sonoma rabbit w/mustard sauce, mushrooms, and fettuccine persillad) which was not gamey at all, and I enjoyed the Salmon en Papillote- w/ fingerling potatoes, spinach, leeks, and fennel, w/ shallot cream sauce. I've probably had better salmon elsewhere, but the portion size was perfect, and the experience made it exceptional.\n\nZazie is a great restaurant that is no-frills, and even with limited offerings on their menu, they do it all well. It is a great place for a girls night out, and a first date! It's casually elegant, and the prices are very reasonable. They even feature a prix-fixe  so you can get a starter, main course, and dessert, all for $23.50! Bring some bottles of wine and you have a fun, affordable night!\n\nThe best thing about French restaurants??? Their desserts! We ended our night on a very sweet note with the Souffle Gateau Zazie- meyer lemon and white chocolate molten cake w/ berry coulis and fresh strawberries! Best thing ever, and ample size for 4 girls. They are so careful about their precision, that if there is one minute flaw, they will re-do the souffle (which they admitted to us). It was so delightful!!!\n\nMy only complaint???

Limit yourselves to only 4 people MAX. Anyway, we put our name down for 7 people and waited 1.5 hours only to find out that the host was going to split us up into a table of 2 then 5. Why didn't he tell us this earlier? Every 10 minutes he would go back to the chart and look at who was signed up and I'm sure he could have told us. We were disappointed that we couldn't sit together. \n\nNow onto the food, which wasn't bad at all...\n\nFRENCH TOAST TAHITI\nThe walnut paste that comes with it is delicious! I like how you can get 1, 2 or 3 slices of big fatty toast. It's one slice of bread, walnut paste, bread, bananas, etc. Comes with a side of syrup which honestly doesn't need to be used b/c this dish was flavorful enough.\n\nCROQUE MADAME\nThis was somewhat messy. The cheese was a bit on the watery side so it was hard to cut my sandwich and keep it a sandwich. It soon turned into a pile of bread, cheeses, ham, and runny egg. It was still good. I didn't even bother touching the side of greens on my plate. \n\nBENEDICTS\nI believe Zazie is the only place I know of in SF where you can get 1, 2 or 3 benedicts. THREE?? HELL YEAH. Three of my buds ordered 3 different kinds and ended up swapping. I was able to try three kinds: ALBERT (bacon, white cheddar, salsa), MONACO (prosciutto and tomatoes), and the LA MER (crab, avos, green onions). \n\nALBERT - The bacon was definitely very flavorful and thus took over the taste of the benedict. Nonetheless, it was still good.\nMONACO - the prosciutto was a bit chewy but I think this was the best benedict. The flavors of the prosciutto wasn't over powering and everything went well together.\nLA MER - Bland!! Since the hollandaise sauce is a light lemoney sauce, this definitely did not help that the crab wasn't very flavorful, and the fact that avos don't really have much of a taste to it. This was just mushy from the avos and sauce, and stringy from the crab.\n\n7x7.com states that you have to have a benedict at Zazie before you die, but I honestly beg to differ. The poached eggs on the la mer benedict was overdone. It wasn't runny at all. We should have had them change it but we already waited so long for food we didn't really care. The hollandaise sauce for the benedicts could have been a tad bit more flavorful, but I do appreciate how it wasn't overpowering. \n\nAll in all, Zazie is a good place to come to brunch if you want to control the portions you eat for breakfast since you an order 1, 2 or 3 pieces of french toast and same goes with benedicts. YAY FOR PORTION CONTROL! Too bad that wasn't practiced.", "author": "Heidi C."}

After reading the reviews, I was a little worried about the wait, but we got there at around 10:45 and probably only waited around 30 minutes for a party of 2.  Compared to Brenda's, Dottie's and Mama's, the wait at Zazie's was like child's play.  \n\nWe were seated at a table in the back, and soon after, a party was seated at the table next to us, making it pretty much impossible to get out.  But, you're at a small restaurant in San Francisco, so what can ya do.\n\nThe gingerbread pancakes are AMAZING, and I'm not even really a pancake person.  Also tried the French Toast Tahiti stuffed with carmelized bananas and walnuts, which was also good, but I thought the pancakes were better.  French toast was a tiny bit dry.  \n\nThe croque monsieur was extra cheesy and could have used a little bit more ham - the cheese to ham ratio was a bit overwhelming.  I got a side of home fries with my sandwich, and they were fantastic!  I usually prefer hash browns, but the home fries were crispy and garlicky and delicious!  \n\nAll in all, I would definitely come back.", "author": "Jenny R."}

It's a perfectly filling meal for me. Their french toast was really good, a bit on the doughy side, but I like them that way to begin with. \n\nThe service was nice and the patio seating was nicer.

I need to eat gluten- and dairy-free and I called in advance to make sure they could use olive oil in the food preparation instead of butter.  Not all restaurants -- especially small ones -- have the flexibility to do this because some dishes are prepped in advance, so made sure to call first.  I was connected to the kitchen and the woman assured me that they could make their trout dish, including the sides, with olive oil -- \"no problem.\"  Great!  We make the reservation and I'm looking forward to it all day on my birthday.  \n\nWe settled in at Zazie and I ordered the trout dish, mentioning that I spoke with the kitchen the day before about dairy free.  The server came back after our orders were placed and said, in a relatively nonchalant way, \"Oh, well, we can only give you the fish and a side salad -- the sides listed cannot be made without butter because they are all made in advance.  There really isn't much on the menu to substitute, either, because nearly everything is made with butter.\"  Great.  If I had wanted just a piece of fish and some greens, I could have prepared that at home.  I felt totally duped. \n\nI don't automatically expect that restaurants can prepare things dairy-free, but when I specifically call in advance and am assured that they can for a specific dish, only to arrive and find out that they won't and seem relatively uncaring on a special evening for us -- that's pretty disappointing.", "author": "Jen H."}

Hard to believe but Zazie is my first dining experience in this part of the neighborhood. It was an amazingly sunny day with lots of relaxed middle-aged to older diners living the life of seeming luxury. My excuse for being out and about in the middle of the day is being unemployed, which didn't stop me from enjoying a delightful brunch with a good friend.\n\nIt was both our first foray to Zazie but had excellent praises. We glanced at the menu, and though while it was just after 12p, we still opted to try the breakfast foods since that was what Zazie was known for. \n\nWe were both taken with the Daily Specials menu which included the Miracle Pancakes and the Eggs en Fonte. Sad to say, they ran out of both of these items! Disappointed we tried 2 other dishes instead:\n- Eggs Albert (poached eggs with bacon)\n- Challah French Toast (4 halves of thick egg bread with stewed bing cherries)\n\nBoth were solid brunch dishes. The the eggs had a nice tang from the chopped marinated red onions. Not overly done on the hollandaise which is great. The side of roasted potatoes were nicely browned on the edges, though I prefer my actual potato to be a bit softer.\n\nThe french toast was good too, not too eggy nor dense. The stewed cherries were a complementary seasonal touch and added a sense of difference.\n\nBoth dishes ranged about $11 or $12. Not the cheapest but you pay for the better quality of ingredients and care made in the food.\n\nI can see why Zazie is a favorite weekend brunch destination.

After waiting a good hour or so, we were seated. We waited. And Waited. And Waited. And were ignored. We watched 4 tables be seated after us. Then we watched all four tables be greeted and offered the daily special. Then they were given water. Then they ordered. We waited so long to be spoken to that people seated AFTER us were brough their food before anyone took noticed. Only after I grabbed the HOST were we given menus, then water, and were we able to order. Until a food came up did any of the actual wait-staff acknowledge us. Then the waitress' effort was shitty at best. \n\nI usually love this restaurant, and their Gingerbread pancakes and Benedicts are to die for.

To start with, they don't have a straight-up eggs benedict (a growing trend, it would seem). What they do have is a long list of variations, many of which are served with tomatoes. Seriously folks, tomatoes have no place on a benedict and I made sure to avoid those that listed tomatoes.

Unfortunately, I had a reality check today that was disappointing. I ordered the Avignon scramble with tomatoes, eggplant, gruyere cheese and all I can say is that it looked like something I would make in my kitchen. When I go out to brunch and order something -- even if it's a scramble -- I want the eggs to be light, fluffy, with vibrant colors and excellent taste. As in, something I couldn't quite concoct in my kitchen with my humble cooking skills. Everything looked pretty brown-ish on my plate and I am not kidding when I say that it was bland. I'm not heavy handed with salt and I really needed to give those eggs some love. My dining partner also ordered the Florentine Benedict and the poached eggs were overcooked and the mushrooms were slimy. We were hungry and so we ate the food, but I won't be coming back.

The cakes were good, too much curd, too tart.  Should've had the curd on the side, I love lemon curd but not that much.  I couldn't finish the 2 pancakes and had it for breakfast the next day and it tasted even better!\n\nHubby had one of their eggs benedict-like breakfasts, over muffins.  He raved about the chunks of potatoes cooked with whole cloves of roasted garlic (with skins on).  Add coffee, tea, the damage came to over $30.  Definitely your special breakfast kind of place at that price.  They charge $2 extra for health care tax.   Overheard a regular commenting that she loves their gingerbread pancakes.  Another reason to come back?\n\nAfter i wrote this review, I was contacted by the owner, thanking me for writing about the place. Evidently, she checks to see if there're any problems from time to time.  I like that....small business owners who are responsible and care about what their customers think.  That's good business, not the kind of stuff they teach in business schools nowadays.  (Enron, mortagage companies, etc.)", "author": "Ry T."}

I walked from Potrero Hill (down 17th through the Castro) to get over here to try the Gingerbread Pancakes.  YUMMM!  It was a very pleasant walk and their delicious food was a great way to reward myself for hiking the hills.  I made the mistake of ordering two pancakes instead of one.  I have a fairly big appetite, so it's hard to imagine what normal sized woman could eat more than one.  I mention this point because if you order two thinking you'll be able to eat them both, you'll be wasting five precious dollars.  Also, beware of the home fries if you don't like garlic.  I can't imagine not loving garlic, but my husband couldn't bare to eat the potatoes because of the strong garlic flavor.  Another waste of money.\n\nI also love this place because the staff was extremely friendly.  Much more friendly than the average San Francisco brunch staff.  I will definitely go back here, and I'll definitely order a gingerbread pancake with pear and lemon curd again!  \n\nIf you are going to trek over here on foot like I did, I'd recommend climbing up to Tank Hill when you're finished with brunch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-11", "description": "Most reviews on here talk about brunch: I am here to tell you that Zazie plated up one of the best dinners out I've had in quite a while. \n\nWe had two entrees, two appetizers, and two desserts, plus coffee and Pellegrino, and the bill pre-tip was $82.50. (YMMV -- I got the Prix Fixe option, and we didn't have wine.)\n\nBefore I get into the food, I'll tell you I picked this on the suggestion of three friends who are pastry chefs. I named some places I liked and told them I wanted to impress my date without intimidating him, that he liked traditional steak-type food, and that I wanted a place we could actually hear each other talk. Many of my favorite places in this price range are too-cool-for-school in terms of ambiance and music, which is great if you know your dinner companion really well, or if you want them to know how cool you are, but not so much if you want to have stillness as part of the menu.  Zazie is a small place and quiet enough to hear your dinner partner without having to shout and without having to ignore anyone else's conversation, but it retains a certain sense of stylishness that isn't at all quaint.\n\nAND THE FOOD!\n\nI had the salmon, wrapped in parchment and cooked over potatoes and greens, and it was delicate and juicy and melted in my mouth, seriously. My date had the hanger steak, cooked to perfection so you could taste it while it was still on the fork. We had mussels to start, and I shit you not they were the best mussels I've ever had. The sauce was just lemony enough -- I'm not a big lemon-on-seafood fan -- to make the cream interesting. We also had the cheese plate, which I wish I'd asked for a description of the cheeses, because they were great. Everything was great. The rolls and butter to start? Yes, oh, yes.\n\nWe had dessert, too -- I had the pot du chocolat -- one of my favorite menu items of all time, and theirs was luscious. He had the creme brulee, the only complaint about which was that they don't bring it to you on fire, or set it on fire at your table. It's well out. Which is too bad, because he ordered it as a birthday dessert, and when we said, \"Hey, it isn't on fire!\" the put a candle in it and got the whole restaurant to sing happy birthday. Waiter had a lovely singing voice, I have to say, but it was a bit silly -- like being at ChiChis without the sombreros. But silly is good. A date without silly is like a dinner without butter.", "author": "Tarin T."}

The food--whether it's brunch, lunch, or dinner--is consistently amazing.  The pancakes are light, fluffy and to die for.  The french toast is also fantastic.

They had been closed about a year ago for remodeling and I thought we'd go check it out.\n\nI'm going to sound like such a jerk, but yet again I was disappointed by this place.  Every time I go I feel kind of guilty because I feel like I'm spending way too much money on something I could make myself, better.\n\nThe best part about Zazie is the ambience.  I wish I could just sit on the patio and drink tap water  That, and their overpriced mimosas come in stemless flutes, which are rad.  And the servers are all sweet.\n\nBut the food is always a a let down!  I think this is my least favorite place in the Cole Valley-Haight Ashbury-Sunset area.  Nothing ever looks appetizing, but I ended up getting Oatmeal Brulee, which I admit I'd never seen before.  It was basically Quaker oatmeal with delicious creme brulee and caramelized bananas.  I unfortunately had to eat it with a fork, which was weird, and the oatmeal is very plain and bland,  so I asked for some brown sugar, and it arrived when there was no longer any oatmeal in my bowl.  (Our server had the whole patio but was very very very sweet and calm.)\n\nI'm not a complaining guest, as in, i'll just eat my oatmeal because i'm hungry and want to get it over with and won't make my server take it back and get me something else, but I feel like yesterday was one of those days that I should have.... :(\n\nSo I've really decided to never go back, (I've been probably 10 times).  However, one day we wanted to go and they were closed for construction, and the little place next door, Bambino's, was AMAZING!!!  Delicious food, very clean interior, excellent service, leagues better.  I don't know why people wait for an hour on Sundays just to sit on that damn patio.", "author": "Kicker .."}

I do prefer to sit in the patio rather than inside, as it's too cramped. Zazie does the best poached eggs, and I love their gingerbread pancake and grilled chicken sandwich. I have had some pancakes that weren't spectacular ... that was before I tried their gingerbread pancake which is a must-order for me now.", "author": "Diana B."}

My boyfriend and I wanted brunch and called before hand to see if they would take a reservation.  The person who answered the phone said that it was first come, first serve and that we should come down as soon as we could.  Done, we left our house quickly and were there in 10 minutes.  \n\nWhen we got there at 1:45 and asked the host to put my name on the list, he replies with a \"I'm sorry, we're not taking any more names.\"  Of course I was upset because I really, really wanted to try their brunch.  I mentioned that I had just called and was told to come in and he said \"Well since you misunderstood, I can fit you in.\"  First off, I didn't misunderstand shizzle and was a little put off by the fact that he blamed me.  Did I mention that they stop serving brunch at 3:00?  I was expecting to wait a really long time since he had no room for us, but I didn't mind.  20 minutes later he calls my name.  I just thought it was strange that he was trying to turn us away when it was so easy to fit us in (not to mention we were finished dining by 2:40).\n\nThe food was awesome.  I had a crab benedict and by boyfriend had the smoked salmon benedict.  I though his was better, but they were both good.  We also split an order of French toast with bananas and it was absolutely delicious.  I like the fact that you can order 1, 2, or 3 eggs or toast with your meal so it's possible to try a little of everything.  The potatoes were excellent as well.  We also had a mimosa and a soju bloody mary.  Both were yummy.  \n\nI can't say much about the service.  The server brought the food and never checked back.  We really wanted some more drinks, but she never stopped by.  Oh well, the food was excellent.  The staff wasn't very friendly or very helpful, but I understand that it's very busy there.  It was weird to me that certain people were seated after us although we were supposedly last on the list and they had absolutely no more space for anyone and were turning people away left and right.  I guess they were special.\n\nOverall, the service was just okay but the food was delicious.  I want to give Zazie another try, but I will just make sure to get there early next time before the staff is burned out.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

I'm already predisposed to sweating in unnecessary situations, so imagine what happens when I put on a t-shirt, baggy basketball shorts and am asked to take the 'physical challenge' on my bike. Yeah, that's right. I get sweaty. And not in that 'hot-guy-with-sweat-stains-in-all-the-right-places' way. Oh no, I'm out of breath, my knees get red and my hair gets frizzy and curly. \n\nAnyway, this is what I looked like when my friend had us ride up Cole and suggested we grab something to eat. I was thinking \"we can run into a store, grab the first things we can find, and devour it like lions in the African plains far away from anyone's immediate sight.\" Instead, we went to Zazie. \n\nAlthough I was worried that we were better suited for Dunkin Donuts, no one seemed to take notice to our outfits. We sat in the front of the store, but I wish we could have been outside on the patio. We were immediately greeted with water which won my heart. Orange juice was oredered as well since we needed a quick sugar rush. I ordered the Eggs Mexico (suh-prise) and it was pretty good. \n\nI enjoyed the decor at Zazie, but the food (nor the decorations) really scream FRENCH to me.

I got the La Mer, which had crabmeat and avocado on it. They definitely did not skimp on the avocado or the crab, which is awesome because I feel like a lot of breakfast places will do that, especially with avocado and only give you the tiniest sliver of a piece. \nMy bf also got the eggs benedict, but he got the Monaco style one, which has prosciutto and tomato. The tomato really added a cool flavor to the eggs benedict. \nWe came here for brunch on a Sunday morning, but got there at 9 am, so we were able to get a table right away on the patio outside. But even after sitting there for 10 min, a HUGE line already formed, and pretty soon the wait seemed like it was closer to 30 minutes (at least). I would highly recommend getting here early. Also, they don't seat you until your whole party is here, so keep that in mind.

It's easiest as a two top with no indoor/outdoor preference - hardest as a four top, at 11, with patio wishes. We've had to wait an hour with the latter in the past.  That's when you head over to Finnegan's for a bloody (if it's after noon).\n\n- gingerbread pancakes have a wonderful flavor and texture but aren't gingery enough for me (but I'm an extreme ginger fan). The poached pears are what get me to order this over and over tho...\n- eggs - they use organic eggs that have bright orange yolks and are totally delish, any way you serve em. We prefer to get the eggs albert (like a benedict but with cheddar and bacon - mmm, bacon) and my man likes to get 3 of them.\n- I think it's called Tahitian french toast - something like that - whatever it's called it out of this world.\n- mimosa selections - YUMS. It really is a great way to get over a hangover - or just take the edge off.\n\nHonestly, I don't really have an absolutely must have favorite - I try whatever I'm feelin' at the time and I'm always happy.  \n\nService is always just fine - attentive, efficient and not pushy.  I've never had a server rush us out.\n\nThe dining room and patio are pretty tight fitting tho - you have to squeeze past servers and runners thru the kitchen on the way to the patio. You have to squeeze into your seat on the patio and get to hear everyone's conversations around you (and make facial expression comments to your dining partner).  \n\nI can let those things go for the food tho - it's worth it.", "author": "Adriene C."}

It's perfect. \n\nIn the evening, le menu est un petit peu plus francais and if you plug your ears with cotton so you drown out the sound of the American accents and squint your eyes a bit, you just might think that you are dining in a neighborhood bistro somewhere in the countryside of France. \n\nWell done, Zazie.", "author": "Julia Y."}

But I can't and I won't, because for me, a dining experience is all about the food and the food was fantastic.\n\nZazie's has that quaint French countryside feel about it that I love. There's a charming spiraled staircase that probably leads to a storage area on the side, clunky wooden tables and chairs that are wedged right next to each other and seating out front and at the patio out back. It's a little cramped, but it's charming. I dig it.\n\nThe wait was a little excessive, especially since my friend and I especially planned to get here before the rush - at 9:30-10, and we still ended up waiting around forty-five minutes. The Tully's right down the block is a godsend! Just grab a small drip coffee from there, take a walk around the block and it helps kill a lot of time, especially on a beautiful San Francisco morning (we've been getting more and more of those).\n\nThe food however, was fantastic. I ordered the egg scramble (Fontainbleu) with spinach, wild mushrooms, and fontina cheese folded in and it was ridiculously tasty and decadent. The potatoes are especially notable - unlike most brunch places that either burn their potatoes so that they're brown and hard or under cook them so that they're still grainy and lukewarm, Zazie's potatoes were perfect - crispy and hot on the outside, soft and delicious on the inside. With a pinch of rosemary, whole roasted garlic cloves (perfect for spreading on your potatoes, yum!) and probably a vat of butter (totally not complaining) I know I'd remember the potatoes.\n\nMy friend and I split an order of the gingerbread pancakes that came with a poached pear and lemon curd on top. While this in theory sounded like an orgasm in the form of a hot cake, it fell a little short. The flavors were all intact, I just would've liked my pancakes a little lighter and more moist.\n\nI wasn't blown away and was initially disgruntled when walking out of there because of the price (I was left almost twenty bucks poorer, from brunch?!), but a. I'm in a good mood today  and most importantly, b. the fact that I still find myself craving my scramble has got to say something.

We had pre-planned EVERY meal for her visit from Friday afternoon through Sunday night, oh, maybe 2 months in advance. So when Sunday morning came we hiked over the hill to Cole Valley. On the way out of the Mission I pointed out the ridiculously long line in front of Tartine and told my pal, it's like that ALL the time... I've stood in it once, never again.\n\nAnd of course as soon as we pull up in front of Zazie, there is a mob scene and an hour wait. We roll our eyes at each other at our brunch ignorance and debate whether to head to one of the other eateries in the area. Stomachs are growling and our normally chipper banter has become mono-syllables... we decide we should just stay put and wait it out - her weekend visit was too short to include any meal that wasn't incredible.\n\nBut finally... FINALLY we get a sweet tap from the host and we walk back to the patio for our table. The place is teaming with happy folks enjoying their weekend rituals and I feel blessed to be among them at last. Our meals were both delicious - chorizo and eggs for Viola, along with home fries which I'm pretty sure I saw her licking her fingers after she finished them, and an amazingly tasty BLT (which I added avocado to). The crunchy bread, the tangy goat cheese, bacon - like there could ever be anything wrong with that.

This is the 714 review I've written.\n\nZazie's brunch items are good but I actually prefer their dinner menu and don't think brunch is worth the long wait.  Sometimes the bacon and home fries are overcooked.  For brunch I like the eggs valence - poached eggs with eggplant, tomato & chevre - it's healthier because it doesn't come with Hollandaise sauce but it is still packed with flavor.  I've been here quite a few times, for brunch and dinner, because we lived in the neighborhood and brought our out-of-town guests here.\n\nDinner is a better value and far less crowded.  I usually get the prix fixe option ($23.50 - comes with an appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert).  I always get the mussels marinieres as a starter - steamed mussels with white wine, garlic, shallots, cream and parsley - delicious, fresh and very flavorful.  The broth is SO good.   My favorite entr\u00e9e is the fish soup Provencale - luscious, thick, creamy tomato-based soup, with chunks of fish and mussels - one of the best soups I've had and it comes with yummy crunchy croutons, cheese and rouille.  Yes, I love mussels.  For dessert I like to get the cr\u00e8me brulee.  A perfect meal (and you get complimentary bread).

(Though, this doesn't seem to deter anyone because there's always a wait!!)\n\nLocated in the adorable Cole Valley, this French bistro offers a delicious, affordable brunch with options to spare.  We decided on the Eggs Fontainbleu (with wild mushrooms, spinach, and fontina, served with a side of red potatoes) - $10.95; the Pancakes du Midi (buttermilk pancakes with fresh fruit, including melons, pineapples, apples, mango, and strawberries) - $13 for 3, $10 for 2, or $4.95 for 1 pancake; and I indulged in a mango mimosa - $5.95 (off of which I got a fantastic little Saturday afternoon buzz).  \n\nThere was not a crumb left on either of our plates after we ate, and these are probably the best pancakes I've had, possibly ever.  \n\nTIPS:\n- don't ask how anyone who works here how long the wait is for a table, as there is a sign on the window right next to where you write your name down.  The workers here get a little annoyed if you ask, so don't say you weren't warned!\n- if you have time to spare, request patio seating - it's beautiful out there on a sunny day\n- Mondays are \"Bring Your Doggie to Dinner\" night on the aforementioned heated garden patio, and it's $10 off \"Portrait of a Mutt\" Zin\n- Tuesdays are No Corkage nights*\n\n*I suppose I'll have to make the trip out here for dinner sometime to take advantage of their wine nights.\n\nThough not cheap by any means (I said it's reasonable, not cheap!), I really do consider Zazie a great value for what you get in portion sizes and ambiance.", "author": "Kira K."}

Yes, Zazie is open for dinner.  \n\nIn deference to Jeff A's insistence that I increase my calorie count, but more because it's the weekend and I want to eat out, we cruised town for a good place to eat.  Innumerable lunatics are waiting up to an hour for a table in Stonestown, can you believe that?  Margaret always comes up with a good idea, and tonight she brought us to Cole Valley for French food.  \n\nConsidering I'm feeling pretty good tonight, I believe I was able to crank up the calories without concentrating on butter, the French staple.  Here's how it went down:  \n\nStarters:  a salad for her, and tiger prawns for me.  Five nice big tiger prawns, with evidence of garlic butter, but not dripping in it.  The salads had balsamic vinegar in them, which added interest to what were probably Earth Bound mixed greens.  \n\nEntrees:  She chose duck, which came with spinach and mashed potatoes.  I took a bite of the duck, and delighted in the crispy skin.  A small bite, I swear!  I ordered the fish soup provencale, which was mussels and salmon in a red sauce similar to a bouillabaisse.  Amazingly, the fish soup has no butter!  Like Moses and Isaiah, I have skipped dying and gone straight to heaven.  \n\nBeverage:  green jasmine tea\n\nDessert:  Oh yes, dessert.  Chocolate pot de creme.  No comments, please.  \n\nService:  EXCELLENT! \n\nTab:  $60 \n\nIt's OK, I worked out today.  Jeff, I raised the weights and the speed on the treadmill.

The servers were nice but busy and the decor of the place was very inviting, very San Francisco.\n\nI ordered trout and salad and my friend ordered an egg, toast, potatoes, bacon and the french onion soup.  The trout was seasoned well but a little soggy and the salad was nicely dressed.  I also tasted a little bit of my friend's soup and it was quite tasty.  I longed to take a bite of her fabulously runny egg on toast with a bite of bacon, but I just kept stuffing my mouth with fish and salad feeling sad but strong that I was not cheating on my elimination diet.

I imagined that if I got to Cole Valley before 10:00 a.m. I'd be able to snag one of the sidewalk tables and enjoy a little breakfast with my dogs (see my Boulangerie review - I don't actually share my breakfast with my dogs).  Lo and behold, not only were there 20 people out front waiting for tables, all four of the sidewalk tables were already occupied - at 9:45 this morning!  Jesus, people!  Sleep in, would ya!?\n\nI can still review Zazie (even though this morning I was forced to eat at the Bou instead) since I've eaten there so many times.  For breakfast, brunch, and lunch, there's not a better spot in the neighborhood.  They make eggs benedict about 10 different ways (I am partial to the La Mer - that's with crab and avocado - YUM!), fresh squeezed orange juice, good coffee . . . they even make a pretty good burger.  The sidewalk seating is nice with my dogs - and on Monday evenings you can even bring your dogs to the outdoor patio in the back (Mondays are dog night at Zazie), and I think they don't charge corkage if you bring your own wine.  Can't beat that!  Dog night at the Bou!\n\nFinally, since it's right across the street from Cole Hardware, you can combine your breakfast outing with your quest for a phillips-head screwdriver and a paint sample.

On weekends There's always a line out the door at this place and if you can stand to wait outside and pay enough attention to hear your name called, it's totally worth it. Actually the first time we went there was no line at all and we were seated right away, but i think it was because it was a weekday.\n\nAt any breakfast or brunch place I always order Eggs Benedict if its on the menu, and Zazie has a great variety of Benedict's to enjoy- my fav is La Mer, which is served with fresh dungeness crab. Sooo yummy and decadent but not too rich! They also have a salmon version as well as a veg version with spinach. You can either order  1 or 2 poached eggs with the benedict, depending on how hungry you are and how full you get off of mimosas which leads me to....\n\nTheir build-your-own mimosa kit! The build your own gets you a bottle of sparkling wine with a small pitcher of Oj or they have a variety of other juices if you want to get funky- last time we went we got the elderflower version so our bottle came accompanied by a small pitcher of yummy fragrant syrupy liquid that makes your sparkling wine taste like an intoxicating flower garden. Totally delicious.\n\nTheir back patio is really cute and has a garden feel to it. The inside seating area is small but just as cozy.\n\nWe  have only gotten great service here. Even though the servers are under a lot of pressure to turn tables over (or at least i would be if i was constantly reminded of the huge crowd waiting outside) but it has never made the service suffer. This place is great for brunch with friends or whoever you're meeting up with in the city.

It also didn't help that the dining area was full of women having brunch who all stopped in the middle of their conversations to gape at me, some random guy who was dumb enough to wear all black on a beautiful day.  Any reservations I had were erased when, to my delight, the server appeared at my table with a bottle of water and a smile and told me to take my time with the menu.\n\nI'd heard that the poached eggs were the best thing going on here, so I had my server order some Eggs Albert - poached eggs with bacon, white cheddar and salsa fresca - and a cup of coffee.  As the server put it \"I love the crispiness of the bacon mixed with the softness of the eggs.\"  As I put it, \"It's got cheese and bacon!  How can I lose?\"  The salsa fresca was unexpectedly super fresca and spicy which made the meal that much better.\n\nZazie lived up to my expectations - a good little restaurant with a beautiful back patio (which I didn't get to sit in because it was packed on this nice day), quick and friendly service and good food in a super laid back atmosphere.

A cool refreshing fizzle to start the day was just what I needed. I ordered the Eggs Pierre Noire which comes with homefries. I like how they give you an option of ordering one, two, or three eggs. I chose one, just so I wouldn't look like TOO much of a heffer because I really wanted to try the French Toast Tahiti (stuffed w/ caramelized bananas & walnuts). I normally don't care for french toast, but I think it was the best french toast I've ever had. \n\nMy bf ordered the Eggs Mexico (with chorizo, white cheddar, roasted peppers & homemade salsa). With his first bite his reaction was, \"Mmm! This is damn good.\" I took a bite. Ooh, he no lie. \n\nBefore I forget, Zazie adds $1/person onto the total bill. It has something to do with trying to get SF to launch a universal health care plan, which I'm all for. \n\nService is real friendly. Environment is comfortable. Food is awesome. Can't ask for anything more, really.", "author": "Jen Y."}

A touch of salt kicked them into gear, which is okay as I'd much rather the kitchen leave the salting up to the guests.  \n\nWe started off with a simple house salad (terrific balsamic orange dressing), a cheese plate (good, but not great) and the cream of asparagus soup (okay, but nothing special).\n\nI'll definitely be back.", "author": "David L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-05-25", "description": "I came to Zazie looking for something unique and left with a bad taste in my mouth. Literally. \n\nThe location is great the host is great. The price sucks, the wait sucks, the coffee was really bad, and the quality of the ingredients is questionable. Our server liked to stare off into the distance from the order station for minutes at a time & forgot an item. When all of these factors come together it leads to an unsatisfactory meal.\n\nI could taste the French influence, as they liked to play with flavor concepts and stay away from the basic salt & pepper. This can be good, but many times here it lead to blandness or very sour tasting food.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Cream Cheese Coffee Cake\n- Coffee\n- French Toast Carmelized Banana w/ Walnuts\n- Gingerbread Pancakes w/ pears & lemon compote\n- Bacon, Spinach & Fontana Cheese eggs\n- Side of Bacon\n\nThis was just our experience here; Meaning I won't be back as there are much better places for a solid breakfast such as Absinthe, Mama's, random cafe A, crepe shops, even Stacks (for their consistency). The best items were the coffee cake (which was very bland) and the gingerbread pancakes mostly for the pears. I really enjoyed the pancakes at first. They have a nice flavor that is just straight up gingerbread with pear and the lemon compote mix. After eating them almost 1/2 way through, I realized that there wasn't much else to them though. Gingerbread pancakes are really just a gingerbread muffin, but flatter and w/ stuff on top. The consistency was closer to a muffin as well. \n\nBiggest flops were the omelet because the cheese was too sour to really enjoy it. The coffee because the 1st cup was burnt sour and the 2nd was only slightly better. The bacon, because it was below Denny's fare in quality. The potatoes because they had no flavor. The water because it smelled like a dog licked the glass clean. \n\nThis is more like 2.5 stars, but since 3 should be average and there are so many unnecessary 5-Star critics in SF I'm starting to award lower scores to spots that are hot due mostly to spastic local hypers.", "author": "Nick V."}

I loved the outdoor seating in the patio area. Super cute gardenesque atmosphere where you could actually hear the people you're talking with (I'd ask for seating back there, because seating indoors seems a bit hectic). The La Mer poached eggs were okay. Not my favorite, but the potatoes came on the side came with garlic, and that was the money bit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-28", "description": "So, the best way I can think to write this is reviewing the experience in chronological order. Sorry its kind of lenghty I know, hopefully its worth the read. \n\nDriving to this place anticipation of another great meal grew. We had eaten here before, but this would be our first brunch experience. We're kind of brunch fanatics. I can't think of any kind of food better than really good breakfast food. We got to Zazie and were greeted by a crowd of people waiting to get sat. We briefly drove by this crowd and considered going elsewhere. The closest place I could find to park was on cole and haight, and that spot was metered. So keep in mind if the line was as long as it seemed, it meant we would walk the roughly 6-7 blocks to get to Zazie, we would then get our name on the list hopefully get sat, then I would run 6-7 blocks to feed the meter, then run back. As I said, we love breakfast food. \n\nSo now, were parked and at Zazie with our name on the list. According to the little \"wait time formula\" they have posted on the window (3 min X every party in front of you on the list) we were in for a 45 minute wait. It seemed like a small price to pay, considering all that we had heard about brunch at Zazie. Then opportunity unfolds. Ten minutes into our wait, and group who is parked virtually in front of Zazie is leaving, I convince them to wait two-three minutes before leaving their spot while I ran to my car and moved it closer, to hopefully avoid the trek to feed the meter mid meal. So I am, running, sprinting rather, down to haight to get my car. I get in the car, and on my way to Zazie I realize my fiance called to tell me these fools left and the spot was taken. Ugh. not really a Zazie ugh, but ugh none the less.\n\nBeing the quick thinker I am, I hang a right pulling a california roll at the stop sign (think traffic not sushi) and I stumble on free parking on parnasus right around the corner. Well can you see how this is becoming an emotional rollercoaster? So I walk back to Zazie, happy as a clam that the day is looking up. I get back to Zazie, and we wait. Wait some more. Something tells me this is going to be worth it, so we wait some more. At some point I have to go back to the car for something. On my way back I get a text from my fiance stating they called us, and would not seat us as I'm not there. I think we both understand. It makes sense we'd have to wait for the next available two person table to open up, given the extensive wait list. Well this is where I get lost. When I approach the host, to let him know entire party is here, he says shortly \"well I dont have a seat for you now\". Ok. *sigh* but why. He didnt seat anyone else since calling our name. And why did the host proceed to seat another two person table before us after I informed him we were all here? I don't think I'll ever understand that, but I'm letting it roll off, because again, we love breakfast food. \n\nFInally, the moment we've been waiting for. We're in. Perusing the menu, and there is so much to choose from. All of it looks and sounds delicious. The place smells delicious. I ordered 2 slices of french toast with a side of chicken apple sausage. My fiance ordered a variation of eggs benedict. Mine was out of this world good. Hers was life altering, earth shattering good. Every flavor that was present on either plate perfectly complimented flavors it was surrounded by. Zazie has changed my list of top 2 breakfast places to a list of top 3. All things considered, from the wait to the parking fiasco to the perfectly executed food we will definitely be back to Zazie, and I can not wait.

(The flower box adjacent to us provided a temporary good place to shelve our extra condiments and plates when our table got too full.) Our party shared a bottle of bubbly to \"build your own mimosas\" which was cool and very reasonably priced. I had the crab Eggs Benedict (indulgent, I know, but it WAS my birthday, and I was hungover), which was excellent. The table also shared a blueberry pancake which had fresh lemon curd on top, which was mouth watering and mind blowing. I'm more into savory and sweet in the AM, but I could have eaten a double stack of these pancakes.\n\nMost recently we sat out on the back patio on another sunny SF day (yes, two this summer, what a nice surprise!) and I tried the veggie panini sandwich, which consisted of yellow squash, red onion, roasted peppers, pesto and goat cheese and came with a salad. Yumtastic. Also insanely good was the sparkling lemonade, which was frosty ice cold and refreshing. (Was great on its own, but reminded me a bit of sipping on lemoncello and could have been great as an alcoholic drink too.)\n\nEverything about this place is cute and delicious, and worth the wait if you have time, but don't be in a rush because while service is fine, it's always busy.

In more than a word:  Savory with questionable service.\n\nI came to Zazie's alone on a weekday at 10 a.m. with a Chronicle in hand.  I was allowed to take any table I wanted (that always makes me happy), but the back patio was closed, so I'd have to stay indoors.  There were only two or three other parties brunching away, and I settled in for a long brunch at a table for two all by my lonesome.\n\nI ordered the Fontainbleu scramble, earl grey tea, and a Zazie Spritzer.  The Fontainbleu is a mixture of two (or was it three?) types of mushrooms, spinach, and fontina cheese.  The scramble itself was incredibly rich (but I expected this, having ordered an omelette with fontina cheese in it), with approximately four bites of spinach in it.  They were good bites, though.\n\nThe scramble came with a side of toast (wheat or white--I ordered white, and was happily surprised to find that it would be two thick slices of Challah).  The toast alone warranted a star here--well, actually, the raspberry preserves sitting in a cute little jar on every table deserve the star.  Really fabulous stuff, but if you don't like seedy jams, it's not for you.  \n\nMy scramble also came with a scoop of Zazie's famous breakfast potatoes. The thing about the breakfast potatoes is that they're not BREAKFAST potatoes--and they're fantastic.  The chef has halved and quartered red potatoes and roasted them with whole, skin-on cloves of garlic until everything is a mooshy, garlicky mess.  They're a rich, buttery delight--but they taste a little more like salt itself than like a dish that's been highlighted by a sprinkle of salt.  \n\nSadly, nothing ruins good food like bad service, and if you have good food, it makes me even more angry that you're careless about your service.  My $3 Zazie spritzer never came (although it wasn't on the bill either); I never got water; my waitress literally never cracked a smile; & I got my check delivered to my table before I had a chance to even ask for the Zazie spritzer for a second time.

I've found meat in sauces I didn't inquire about or something like that, but never had a specified veggie, tofu, soy ,etc.  order come out with meat in it.  When we questioned whether the much touted 'Rizo was real or faux, our server gave us a \"Hmm\" look and took the plate away without a word.

When you do enough covers, there's no way to avoid mistakes in the kitchen, but I was more thrown by the inconsistencies in service.  \n\nIn other news, the fruit bowl wasn't ripe enough, the benedict eggs were under poached, the home fries and banana french toast were delicious, and I totally dug the 22 oz.

The mussels were well done but the sauce does not compare to the Public (I'm biased with you Helen F!). The pesto pasta I ordered was lacking the flavor department, but this could just be personal preference. I like food with a kick. But the strawberry rhubarb crumble was divine. Mmm...tarty sweet goodness!\n\nI do have a bone to pick with the service. When my friend and I first entered the restaurant, we stood there for a good couple of minutes and not one server or hostess (was there even a host working that night?!) came up to us to ask us to be seated or if we had a reservation. My friend, needing to go to the bathroom was the one who informed me that our party was sitting out back in the patio. No one looked at us, no one even wanted to make eye contact with us to seat us. WTF?\n\nTsk tsk on the service, people. If I was a non-reservation/birthday dinner going patron, I would have left the restaurant due to lack of attentiveness. That's you losing business. Boo.\n\nEDIT: The very kind owner of Zazie, Jennifer P., PM'ed me and said this: \"I'm glad to know that you and your friend went so unacknowledged tuesday night... I will definatly speak to the host and the waitstaff about that.  The waiters have come to assume that the host will greet people, but if he's on the patio that's not always fast enough.

I can't think of a better neighborhood place for an outstanding but not super expensive dinner.

I made a reservation for a party of 14 and they probably gritted their teeth and said, \"Won-der-ful... what time?\"  This place does not look like they generally hold such a big group.  A group for them would be like 6 people.  They gladly anticipated our arrival.\n\nThey did however ask that we opt for the prix fixe menu, because taking in ale carte orders would have been ball-busting for their wait staff and kitchen.  Absolutely understandable and likely best for us as well!  We've rolled through with a bigger group to another restaurant before and by the time we got our food all at once, some were cold, while others were raw.  A hurried kitchen tends not to deliver a quality product.  So good call on having us do thier prix fixe menu, which btw had some great choices.\n\nJennifer, the owner, thoroughly made sure we were squared away before our arrival.  She even asked if they could personalize the menu knowing this was a special occassion.  We all sat down to a thoughtful message on top - \"Happy Birthday 'Chris T.'s friend'!\"  I got cool points from friends for setting that up!  (by the by... I am still accepting Cool points, fellow Yelpers. hehe)\n\nI had anticipated we'd get patio seating for such a big group and I dreaded that as it had started to drizzle that day.  To our surprise upon arrival, they sacrificed half their inside room for us!  Awesome!  The waitress immediately asked for us to point out the Bday girl... again, we did not ask for this but they brought her a special dessert at the end.  The kind and attentive service prevailed throughout the entire night.  Buns warmed and reloaded often, water refilled, bowls set for shells, and speedy feet to run across our 15 foot table.

Plus, I was a bit scared off after reading all the comments about how long the wait is. When I wake up on a Saturday or Sunday morning in the mood for a good breakfast, I usually don't like to wait. \n\nIn any case, we made a special trip over to this part of town to see what all the hype was about. There were tons of people milling around on the sidewalk and after figuring that we had about a 90 minute wait ahead of us, we slipped into the cute little hardware store across the street to poke around and then grabbed some coffee at the Tully's a few doors down. When we went back to check on the list, our name had already been called, but they were nice enough to bump us to the top. All in all the wait was about 35-40 minutes. Not bad at all.\n\nI always seem to have the same dilemma when choosing a breakfast dish - sweet or savory? Savory usually wins out, but this time I just couldn't pass up the gingerbread pancakes with pears and lemon curd, and boy I'm glad I did. They were seriously delicious, although I think next time I would ask for extra pears, since they only came with two measly slices. I also really liked that all of the pancake/waffle dishes allow you to choose how many you want (as do the egg dishes). I got two pancakes, but I think one would have been plenty.\n\nI would have liked to sit outside in the back, because the patio looked really cute, but the inside is really charming, if a bit crowded.

Definitely great service. \n\nHere's a review of the stuff we ordered\n*assiette de charcuterie - this was a plate with p\u00e2t\u00e9, salmon rillettes, and prosciutto served with pieces of brioche. I didn't care much for the prosciutto, but the salmon and p\u00e2t\u00e9 were delicious and I highly recommend getting it. The p\u00e2t\u00e9 was buttery smooth and the salmon had amazing flavor. The fish wasn't fishy and the p\u00e2t\u00e9 had only the slightest taste of liver. \n\n*p\u00e2t\u00e9 de volaille - chicken liver and brandy p\u00e2t\u00e9 served on a grilled garlic levaine. this was also very good and highly recommended. Similar to the previous, the p\u00e2t\u00e9 was perfectly smooth and not gritty like I've had in some other places\n\n*grilled porkchop -  the porkchop was pretty juicy, but it was nothing memorable. \n\n*fresh black truffle raviolis - a must must must get! this was the best dish next to p\u00e2t\u00e9. It wasn't overly heavy with cheese but instead cooked perfectly al dente with delicious innards and piping hot on arrival. \n\n*le canard crispy duck leg - the duck was a little dry and flavorless, but the fingerling potato salad seasoned with pancetta and mustard was delightful. The potatoes were perfectly seasoned and super addicting. The sauce they had for that was so good, I lathered the duck in it.\n\nI'll definitely be coming back here to try out their poulat francais (stuffed chicken) that happened to be all sold out by the time we got there!", "author": "Gloria C."}

Usually everything is excellent and I walk away saying,  \"best brunch in the city,\" but not so much this Saturday.  The patio was as pleasant as ever, as was the service, but the gingerbread pancakes were burnt and my foutainbleu scramble was a bit runny.  Sad.  Perhaps I am expecting too much of Zazie.  Please tell me this isn't the new you.\n\n----------------\nUpdate: 12/19/07\n\nJen, the owner of Zazie, messaged me to let me know that the day I visited the restaurant (in my above review) was indeed an off day for them.  Bill, the head chef, was out sick!  No wonder.  Now while Bill seems to be a superman in the kitchen, i have to respect that the man is human and is likely to fall ill once in a while. \n\nSo Zazie, I'm coming back.

Bar Tartine has been my go-to brunch spot, and I'm stoked to have finally found another great place to add to the mix for my favorite weekend pastime.\n\nI admittedly was a bit nervous about the wait considering that we arrived at PBH (prime brunch hour...with how I roll, that's 11ish), but we only had to wait about 25 minutes, which seemed to go by in a snap. My friend and I were lucky enough to snag a spot on the very pleasant back patio. It felt like you were dining in some quaint little cafe in France. I emphasize the \"little\" because they kind of cram you in like sardines on the patio...my friend and I got stuck in this weird little corner table that had another table right in front of it and on the side of it so the only way you can get out is by asking one of the other tables to move to let you out. That aside, I loved the atmosphere!\n\nThe food was terrific - my friend and I each tried different scrambles that were very flavorful. We also split a small order of the gingerbread pancakes with lemon curd and poached pear that were amazing! The other aspect of the menu that I loved was the variety of champagne-based breakfast cocktails to choose from. They certainly have branched out from the standard mimosa, offering a variety of other juice pairings like black currant, which I ordered and really enjoyed.\n\nZazie was definitely a treat and for those rare warm, sunny days like yesterday, I'm making a beeline to it for brunch on the patio.", "author": "Rachel G."}

Too lazy to make breakfast after being on the phone all night, I searched Yelp for a place that was in reasonable distance from the house.  It was between Zazie and Park Chow, places we've never been before.\n\nThe older kids were happy with their order of pancakes and fresh fruit.  My youngest was much pickier with her french toast and fruit.  I wasn't sure what she didn't like or if she had her heart set on waffles which they don't carry.  As for me, I got the 3 item selection on the menu, 1 pancake, 2 eggs, and 3 strips of bacon.  The pancakes are amazing, light and fluffy.  The bacon was only partially crispy on one end and limp on the other.  I've never had bacon that way and it wasn't how I like it prepared.\n\nThe waiter offered suggestions for drink, for me it's always coffee.  The kids got 1 make it yourself lemon aid (complete hit) and 2 spritzer which is a mix of juices I assume.  The sip I had was good and not overly sweet.\n\nThis place was crowded on a Tuesday morning and a waiting list was started on a clip board.  If you've never been here, you add your name to the list.  \n\nBest part of the menu is that you have the ability to control the portions.  For example you can order 1, 2, or 3 pancakes, same with slices of french toast, eggs, etc.  \n\nI would love to go back for more try more items on the menu.

It seemed like she'd had a long day, so I wasn't going to hold that against her. \n\nSecondly, when my gingerbread pancakes arrived, there was a fairly large dead mosquito perched atop one of the pears. Yeah, I guess it might've been a good source of protein, technically, but that's a very bad first impression. They didn't treat it like any kind of deal -- I didn't really expect shock & horror, but they asked me if I wanted a new pear or something. YES, thanks for the offer. Shouldn't that go without saying? I hardly threw a fit over it. Sometimes I'm a ridiculously good patron in the face of small disasters, like the time I got full glasses of water spilled on me TWICE by the same waiter during the same meal. I even gave that dude a good tip because he felt so terrible & it was clear he was having a shitty day (I won't mention what place because I actually really do like that place & have been back since to stellar service).\n\nThirdly, when the bill came, there was some sort of $2 health care initiative fee. What's THAT all about? Not only that, but my girlfriend ordered the complete opposite of what she'd wanted to order because there were seperate $2 charges for eggwhites only, for soy milk instead of regular milk, & for fruit instead of home fries. I can see for the fruit, & maybe a lesser charge for eggwhites, but isn't soy milk cheaper than regular milk? Wouldn't they charge LESS? And why am I paying for an undisclosed health care initiative that doesn't seem to have any bearing on my dining experience?\n\nAnyway, for having heard such impeccable things about Zazie, I've gotta say I was pretty disappointed on the whole. I'm not a very good Yelp Hater, & more often than not I bite my tongue or look on the bright side of the experience, but my experience at Zazie was pretty overwhelmingly negative.\n\n**UPDATE on the situation with the health care ordinance. I've been told that costs for restaurants in the city have been skyrocketing of late due to (among other things) Paid Sick Leave, increased minimum wage, high gas prices causing new delivery charges, and a 400% rise in the cost of flour. Most of these factors come from measures passed by SF residents in elections. I can understand wanting to be a progressive city & set a high standard of living, but sometimes it seems a bit ridiculous that we're voting to raise our own taxes every single election period. C'mon people, a little restraint from time to time!\n\nAnyway, I guess this is Zazie's way of getting political. Rather than incorporate price changes into the items on the menu, they're showing you that your vote matters, & will directly translate to higher bills when you eat out.", "author": "Pete J."}

I think it might be the set of circumstances for my visit, but when I came to Zazie I thought it was cute, decent, but given the amount of brunch places I've been to in the city it wasn't ... the best.\n\nI ordered the Eggs St. Trop and they were prepared pretty well, and I liked the pairing with the capers.  However, the potatoes were not good.  They weren't crispy and didn't have the right texture, and the skin made the whole thing kind of chewy (eh).  There were roasted garlic cloves with it, which was okay I guess, but still not the best texture.\n\nTheir fresh lemonade was cool in theory (they give you a class of lemon juice, water, and simple syrup) but I am not a seasoned lemonade maker and it took awhile for me to get the portions just right.  The spritzer was okay.\n\nIf you go, I suggest the french toast tahiti and if you get eggs, substitute it for something else.  Also, the day we went was abnormally and slightly abysmally hot, so it made dining a bit more difficult (through NO fault of Zazie, I admit - though it would have been nice if they had more umbrellas).\n\nNow that yelp has an update option, I want to give this place another shot ... but for now, there are so many other brunch places to discover....", "author": "Shay F."}

It's friendly, the food is well prepared and fresh, and the decor is just so comfortable and inviting.  \nAfter 10 am on the weekends, the waits for brunch can be terrible...but they are friendly, will happily bring you a mimosa or coffee--and if you go to Finnegan's Wake next door for a STRONGER drink, you can just let the guy working the list at Zazie know, and they will come get you.

The wait was out the door (Saturday morning around 10AM) but we were seated in about 30 min or so. \n\nWe had quite the feast this morning, as everyone was starving. The three of us had 5 plates of food. \n\nOne of the things I like about this place is you can order a smaller or larger portion depending on hungry you are (or think you are, for those like myself who's eyes are bigger than their stomachs). This is great, as I love ordering just one piece of french toast or one poached egg if that is what I'm craving to go along with my main meal. Yes, this is even good if you just want to eat a light snack (although the wait may be ridiculous for someone who isn't really going to chow down). \n\nBack to the meal. We ordered: \n\n1) the special banana pudding pancakes (very good, moist and two small slivers of caramelized banana on top with whipped cream). \n\n2) Three Egg Monaco, which is poached eggs over prosciutto and tomato with holandaise sauce. (Excellent, with home fries that included huge chunks of garlic cloves) \n\n3) 1 slice of Challah French toast (which was ok, not spectacular because it was not as moist as I prefer, but had a subtle orange cinnamon batter) \n\n4) Eggs Fontainbleu, which comes with salad and toast (This was good, and had mushrooms spinach and fontina) \n\n5) Croque Madame.

So, no line and no waiting for table service. \n\nInstant snapshots~\n- very expensive, they charged us for a side of mustard, and instead of a substitution, they charged for a full side without letting us know in advance (salad instead of toast and potatoes).\n- pretentious crowd, except for the guy there with his aging dad, let's be frank, they were both aging, anyway, it was sweet\n- bathroom is so small that anyone with a double wide behind will have to save it for later\n\nI won't be going back.

Three strips of bacon (or other meaty product), two eggs  (I like 'em scrambled -- I know, I'm twelve), and one perfect, perfect pancake. This used to seem stingy until I finally accepted the fact that perfect pancakes can only be served solo. They're like unicorn steaks that way.\n\n2. The creme-brulee-ish oatmeal. I'm sure there a more correct term for this. All I know is they harden the top of the oatmeal with a blowtorch, just like creme brulee, and just like creme brulee, it's delicious. Not on the menu, so if you order it you'll seem super-cool and insider-y and possibly even French.\n\nUPDATE: Had brunch again at Zazie's. Un Deuz Trois was PERFECT.

But, in the words of Randy Jackson, it was just OK for me, Dog. \n\nthe BF and I made this our 3 year anniversary celebration dinner spot this year because our day fell on a Tuesday and they have no corkage fee on Tuesdays! Being the cheap ass bargain maximizer that I am, I thought this sounded like the perfect combination of creative fare at reasonable prices.  So, off we went.\n\nEverything started out really well... rockstar parking after only 1 trip around the block (Impossible!), adorable tables outside with twinkling candles, cozy/mildly romantic interior and a $5 (yes $5!) gold star bottle of petite syrah.  I saw more twinkling lights out back, so I hurried out to scope the patio... ADORABLE!  My expectations were mounting by the minute (note to self... expectations only get you into trouble).\n\nI returned back to my table after an arduous journey  (caught behind an elderly woman that took about 30 minutes to cross the restaurant from the patio... this was no one's fault but my own curiosity). I sat and gazed into bf's bearded face when out of the corner of my eye I couldn't help but notice... the dated, faded foam core backed French posters about the walls all crumpled and crinkled on the edges.  Come on guys... it's time to up date.  ok no big deal... a couple of ratty posters isn't a make or break issue at a charming restaurant. I just thought it worth mentioning.\n\nThe bread arrived.  Its was warm and tasty with melting butter; another plus for Zazie.  We made our selections: He the fixed price menu of Salmon with soup starter (a bargain at $23 inc. dessert) and I the trout with spinach salad. \n\nThe salmon was perfect. Delicious! BF couldn't have been more excited when he tasted the \"mashed potatoes\" under the salmon because he didn't remember it coming with potatoes (his favorite)!  It didn't... it was pureed celery root or cauliflower or something and it was tasters!!  I love trick food that gets the BF to eat healthier. It also came with the most delectable brussel sprouts with pecans.  HEAVENLY!  I think I ate as much of his entree as he did.  \n\nUnfortunately, my trout missed the mark entirely.  The trout itself was decent, but the accompaniments were way off.  Everything tasted OK, but it wasn't a good combo and didn't look very appetizing either. The trout came with \"sweet pie pumpkin,\" chevre, and leeks (or fennel, I dont remember).  Sounds delish doesn't it? It wasn't.  The pumpkin was flavorless and kind of underdone... when it mixed on the fish with the chevre and leek/fennel it all took on a goopy tan/beigey/gray tinge that looked more like something you'd scrape off your plate into the compost than something to scoop with a fork into your mouth.\n\nIn the end we had a very nice night and it was a pleasant experience overall.  this is a place I will visit again.  The service was warm, friendly, helpful and mostly attentive.  I liked the neighborhood vibe and simple charm of the over all experience.  The prices are exceptionally reasonable and I think an even \"Just ok for me, Dog\" experience is acceptable at $15 a plate.  One can't always expect perfection.  They get 4 stars for value and ambiance and the salmon!\n\nSounds like brunch is the bomb here, so I will have to come back for that sometime.", "author": "shannon m."}

Mere blocks from the far more colorful Haight Ashbury neighborhood, Zazie is surrounded by wholesome little shops and town houses. People actually have babies/young children in this area (gasp). \n\nThe food is phenomenal whether you're an egg or carb-oriented breakfaster. I am equally obsessed with the fontainbleu egg scramble and the french toast tahiti (sinfully decadent - its stuffed with carmelized bananas and walnuts). I've also sampled and enjoyed the gingerbread pancakes (topped with roasted pears) and the Valence poached eggs. \n\nThe menu's best feature: most items are available in quantities of one, two and three - this goes for french toast, pancakes, and the multiple poached eggs variations. When my brunch companions and I have been particularly hungry or just feeling indulgent, we'll often get a single pancake or slice of french toast as a \"side\" in addition to our entrees. Conversely, it is also a good option for cost conscious brunchers. \n\n$$ and the long wait seem to be the two primary concerns about this spot, and I'd like to weigh in on both. With respect to cost, my personal philosophy is that brunch is invariably a good deal because you're getting two meals (breakfast and lunch) for the price of one. Even better, this form of justification/denial is equally applicable to food consumption - calories are spread out over two meals. (Yay loopholes!)\n\nAs for the wait, I've been here a bazillion times and have never waited for over 30 minutes. Maybe it's luck, but there's also a surprisingly well kept secret: the tables on the sidewalk are first come, first serve, so if it's a nice day put your name on the list and stake out the diners nearest to finishing. Also, dining in smaller parties helps (especially in twos), as tables for larger groups are limited. But alas, if you do have to wait, the Zazie host couldn't be nicer and remembers all regulars by sight and even name. \n\nI'd like to end this rambling review with an image that I believe is testament to Zazie's greatness. For a few weeks in the spring, Zazie closed for renovations. Being rather slow in the morning, I forgot this and showed up only to find the interior dark and a notice on the door. But it was worth the trip just to see the thousands of post-it notes from forlorn patrons that papered Zazie's windows, begging it to reopen soon.

This place has that type of a work force, and it's such a refreshing change compared with some of the newer stuffier places I've been to since moving out here. Examples: our waiter advising my date against the soup of the day, as he said there were better things on the menu, and the dude at the door bringing us not one but two rounds of complimentary bubbly as we waited for our table--and sharing in our snarky grumbling about the couple that was taking waaaay too long to vacate the table that was to be ours.\n--Food is equally fantastic, and original, AND decent-sized servings. I had the duck, my date had the polenta, and we shared the cheese plate as an appetizer. All were great, originally prepared AND left us both stuffed--a rarity for me and my big appetite, at French places especially.\n--Atmosphere is warm and friendly. No stuffiness here, and the place just has a general good mood vibe--proven by the point that it was pouring outside the night we went but somehow everyone who entered still seemed to instantly be in a good mood.\n--Tuesday nights (when we went) are BYOB with no corkage fee. So a great way to keep the bill down, and adds to the friendly non-stuffy vibe (have I mentioned I hate stuffy restaurants)?\n\nAnd things that I was fine with but you may not be:\n--Yes, you may have to wait for a table. Even if you make a reservation. We waited about 20 minutes (but there was free bubbly!). If that possibility throws off your universe, this might not be your place.\n--The tables are pretty close together. But as I said, everyone who entered seemed to be great, so overhearing conversations between great people sitting next to you, and inevitably engaging them in conversation, didn't bug us a bit.\n\nSo check out Zazie for dinner and enjoy it. Just don't tell any people you know who suck.", "author": "Nathan W."}

Everything I could have asked for.  Rich and sweet and savory.\nIn fact, my only complaint would be with their bacon - I felt it was a bit on the thin and ordinary side.  I like my bacon to be thicker, heartier, and more like a fat country slice.  See: Mama's in North Beach for a classic example of the genre.  It was also cold by the time it showed up at the table.

This place is PACKED ALL the time. No matter what time you go, there's always a huge line. My girlfriend and I came here yesterday and there were 15 parties ahead of us! Since I knew how the wait can be, we put our names down and went to Tully's next door for our coffee. After 35 minutes of waiting (not TOO bad), we got a nice table outside in the garden patio. Although it was a chilly day in SF, the heat lamps worked like magic.\n\nI'm always torn between savory and sweet when it comes to brunch, so I love how you can order a lacart. I ordered 1 french toast and two eggs over hard. It was perfect. I LOVE their french toast. The bread is thick and grilled to a crunch. My friend had the New York scramble with smoked salmon, cream cheese and scallions. YUM. On a previous visit, I had their mushroom fontina scramble which was delicious.

Get a table inside or in the patio at the back\n\n+ They recently changed their menu to offer you a choice of 1/2/3 in a bunch of dishes (French toast, eggs, pancakes). So, now you can order 3 slices of French toast or 2 scrambled eggs, rather than however many eggs they used to put in\n\n+ Try their drinks, don't just stick to coffee\n\n+ Take the N Judah muni if you can, it's around the corner.

We started with a delightful cocktail of elderberry liquor and champagne. Daniel and I ordered enough food to completely cover our small table for two. Three gingerbread pancakes, two chicken-apple sausages, Eggs Fontainbleu, Eggs Italie.\n\nWe demolished it. (Well, mostly. There was a small pile of pancake left, which I took home as a desserty snack for later.) My eggs Italie were perfectly cooked, with delicious flavorful tomatoes (and really, you can't go wrong with cream cheese in anything). The side of potatoes with roasted garlic still in the sac? Brilliant. The sausage were good, but not really worth the price. And the pancakes. I'm a sucker for anything with ginger, especially gingerbread, and these did not disappoint.

We waited over ONE HOUR all while parties of 2, who had arrived after us, were being seating within 15 minutes. You can see who writes there names in  as they arrived. I was so upset when i saw that they had seating literally 10 parties of 2 who had arrived much later than us! When I asked the manager, hey why haven't you seated us? He said waiting for a table (to seat 3)!! I looked inside and there were 4 tables for 2 open! I said, can you just put two of those tables together so we may sit already? I told him he has seating several parties of 2 who had only waited maybe 10 minutes and it was not fair! he told me \"let me do my job\" and continued seating parties of two. WOW extremely wrong. I don't agree with the service and the management doesn't know what they are doing. Will never go here again. Unless I am with a party of 2. thumbs down.", "author": "Bella S."}

Ordered the un, deux, trois which includes scrambled eggs, pancakes and bacon. First, everything was cold when it got to the table. Two, the scrambled eggs were runny (yuck!) and third the gingerbread pancakes were flavorless. If it wasn't for the lemon curd and pear topping I would of thought they forgot to substitute the buttermilk pancake for gingerbread.\n\nMy partner in waiting commented his croque madame was good but not worth the hour wait. For me, the mocha in the big ass cup was good but bitter, I needed loads of sugar (cane sugar).\n\nOh and how could I forget the smelly water glasses. After the first sip the strong smell of egg yolk hit my nose. Now how did egg yolk get into both our water glasses, who knows. Perhaps they dropped an egg into the sink while washing them or they're using some fancy organic dish soap that smells like eggs. In any case, no thanks.\n\nNext time, we'll go hang out with the crackheads for 20-30 minutes and have our breakfast at Dottie's True Blue Cafe.

If you enjoy the heavenly fusion of breakfast and lunch that is brunch as much as I do, then you will love Zazie. Technically they still call it breakfast here (and they serve it until 2:30!!!). The surrounding area on Cole reminded me of a calmer locale (maybe like Carmel or somewhere in Marin) perfect for enjoying a nice, quiet laid back meal. \n\nI had the Eggs Divorcee: eggs benedict with bacon, avocado, fontina, and of course, hollandaise. I was pleasantly surprised that the hollandaise didn't have that annoyingly strange sour flavor that store-bought and/or Denny's eggs benedict would have. The egg was poached to the point that you could still find traces of translucent egg white, but firm and semi-runny. The english muffin was so crispy we had a hard time cutting into it, but with the thick cuts of bacon and the creamy avocado, each bite was really perfect texture-wise and flavor-wise. The home fries had a sickly ugly-duckling piece of potato that turned out to be a beautiful head of roasted garlic. Just awesome.\n\nWe also had the Eggs en Fonte which might have been even better than the Divorcee. The combination of perfectly poached egg, tomato sauce, mushrooms and polenta was fantastic. I would comment more but I'm tired of raving about this place. You just have to go try it. \n\nBlew away all premature notions about eggs benedict. Cinco estrellas.", "author": "Dennis M."}

The patio did have a very nice atmosphere, other than someone at a another table talking a bit too loud about his philosophy of life and other things that I obviously don't care about.  Still, that really is a risk anywhere.\n\nThe food was amazing.  The mussels were in a nice butter/white wine sauce, and there were a large number of them, always a pleasant surprise in an appetizer.  Similarly, the stuffed chicken breast was heavenly, I will have to have it again.  The duck was nice but I only tried a bit of it.  For dessert I tried the fruit crumble [apple] which was near molten and very tasty.  Ginger cake is lost on me, so I can't comment on whether it was any good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-12-29", "description": "Overall impression:\n1) Best priced French restaurant in town. I hate the ones that try too hard and charge too much. Great food with reasonable price. \n\n2) Very cute patio seats, but I personally prefer indoors seats, cozy and sweet. \n\n3) Great, tentative, yet not pushy service. The waiter was very laid back, chill, but right there when you just about to need him.\n\n4) Prefer dinner much more than the brunch. Everything is excellent, but a bit too crowded and loud at brunch on weekends. But that's the point isn't it? Best place to go with hangover, and a great force to make sure you get up early on weekends and get there 10 minutes before 9. \n\n5) The owner loved me, so did the dishwashers.\n\nBrunch food:\n1) French Toast Tahiti: perfectly prepared french toasts, thick, fluffy, but heavenly soft. Caramelized banana adds the creamy texture, and the walnuts adds the crunchy kick. Nice and filling, yet not heavy.\n\n2) Gingerbread pancake: incredibly spongy and flavorful pancakes with a touch a lemon cream on top. Very yummy. Try it with the raspberry jam on the table. Much try at Zazie, and you'll see why it's always on the menu.\n\n3) Lemon Ricotta pancake: not the best I've tried. The best lemon ricotta cake that I've had is believe it or not, at the bar Feve in Oberlin Ohio. The cakes are too heavy, and a bit lack of flavor. The first one I got was not cooked through that tasted like the batter. Cookie dough is yummy, but not the pancake batter. Sent it back, got a better one, but still nicht so gute.\n\n4) Eggs Italie: scrambled eggs with tomatoes, cream cheese, and basil. Use your imagination. It's a great combination with good preparation. I personally make better scrambles with some pesto and sun-dried tomatoes. But Zazie cooks my brunch and takes care of the dishes, why not?\n\n3) Eggs Florentine: Best Egg benedict besides Chef and Butler. It is traditional and straight-forward. The Hollandaise is creamy but not heavy, doesn't leave the unpleasant stickiness in your mouth. Eggs perfectly poached. Bravo.\n\n6) The mimosa (grapefruit and something): not impressing at all. Couldn't finish it.\n\n7) Cappuccino: very very good, so good that I hate the fact that you can't have it refilled like a regular coffee.\n\nDinner:\n1) French Onion Soup: I would come here just for this bowl of dreams come true, especially at the end of a long tough day of 45 degrees. Very rich flavored soup, with bread crumbs that have still crunchy crust, OH MY GOD CRUNCHY CHEESY TOP.\n\n2) Salade Betterave: I love beets, and here you get 3 kinds of beets, green, gold, and red beets. I love fennels, and here you get fennels. Avocado and white gorgonzola vinegrette give the creamy texture. Yum. Everything I love thrown together, well balanced and light.\n\n3) Pate de Volaille: I hate liver of any animals. Just hate the taste. But, this one is AMAZING, like O.M.G. So smooth and creamy that just melt on your tongue, yes, THAT good. It doesn't have the nasty liver-y taste at all. One of our favorite dishes of the night. \n\n4) Mussels Marinieres: a little disappointed. The combination of white wine, shallots, parsley and cream is nice, very nice. But I don't like food that's \"slightly warm\", not cold, not warm, not hot, just slightly warm. It's not the best temperature to serve something creamy, I think.\n\n5) Lamb Tagine: braised lamb entree, looks much better on the menu than it tastes actually. Maybe just not my thing to throw everything together and serve it like a chinese congee. Not my favorite dish, but very well prepared I must say.\n\nDessert:\n1) Toasted Challah Bread Pudding: hands down, the best bread pudding in town, even slightly better than Tartine. Although it's not fair to compare 2 different ways of making bread pudding, I like it better at Zazie. I just love the variety of texture in the bowl, crunchy, creamy, bready, eggy, sweet, smooth, warm, but wow with the pumpkin spice icecream. Bravissimo!\n\n2) Cafe d'AUTOMNE: very interesting combination of Ciao bella Tahitian Vanilla bean and pumpkin icecream, pound cake crumbles, shot of espresso, whipped cream, and toasted almond. Interesting, but for some reason, it's just too much going on for me. But worth a try.\n\nTips: go with a group of people, like 4, get the sampler platter, choose 3  appetizers from the list of 6, and the dessert sampler platter choose 3 out of 7.

I arrived with reservation on a Tuesday night and the place was jam-packed, obviously a very popular destination amongst ucsf students and local adults.  We were immediately seated and thankfully we were not put in the claustrophobic looking middle aisle seating.  The dining area is very quaint with some French posters and paintings on the walls.  The clamor of the kitchen and the noise of the dining guests is pretty much all you can hear...although there is smooth jazz playing in the background.\n\nThe menu has some amazing sounding food on it.  Unfortunately we might've ordered all the wrong stuff because every single thing I ate that night tasted very, well, BAD.  \n\nFirst off, I definitely hope they are not popular for their french onion soup because it was one of the worst things I've ever tasted.  The broth tastes like an  MSG soup and there is a layer of cheese sitting on top that just melts and turns the top layer of soup into...goop.  As someone who is lactose intolerant (trust me I tolerate as much as I can regardless, yumyum) I was hoping that every dish wouldn't have such an unreasonable amount of cheese piled on top as a shortcut for flavor.  I order the soup du jour which was nothing special... tomato eggplant I believe.  Our appetizers of mussels was ok...tasted like anything you could grab at a tapas bar.  Finally, it comes down to our entrees.  I ordered the Grilled marscapone polenta cakes and I was completely turned off.  I took 3 bites and I was done.  The cheese was all you could taste so I tried rinsing it off in the orange sauce on the plate but as you can probably tell I was not having it.  My boyfriend's beef shank was very plain.  I was expecting to be wowed for a $98 tab but the items we ordered were not delicious. I doubt I will ever swing by here again.  \nMy rating: C+", "author": "Amber R."}

Last time I was at Zazie, my friend Katia drank FOUR mimosas while waiting for the food to arrive (don't worry, she's Ukrainian).

Their menu, while changing occasionally, maintains a core offering that - while not extensive - still beckons indecision every time you go. Which, in my case, is weekly. \n\nTuesday nights are No Corkage Fee night (a \"secret\" I'm somewhat loathe to share as to not lose our favorite patio table) and they offer a prix fixe menu that often wins my vote.

Throw a couple of cute French photographs on the wall, some French-inspired d\u00e9cor and a patio with ambient lighting, but don't be fooled.   This is only pretty much as good as a French \"IHOP.\"  I respect the restaurant industry and how hard they work, and simply only ask for a few things for my money and time:  Quality food, and service.  The dishes are not what they live up to, very dismal and soul-less.   I wish restaurants would return back to basics, simple and delicious, instead of overdoing a French toast or pancakes with overwhelming, inconsistent flavors.  I had a cold egg dish I could have made at home and split the gingerbread pancakes with my friend for a truly disappointing finale.  The cream that came with my coffee seemed like it had expired and was thick and poured out slowly.   Another detail: the waiter was one of the most unpleasant person I've ever seen in this kind of job.    The service staff to guest ratio is very low and it takes forever to get something, as well as get out of there. \n\nOnly nice point : the place is good looking and looks pretty much as good as a real brasserie and they are dog-friendly.   \n\nMy advice:  Don't waste your time.

The good thing about this place is you can chose your meal size on almost everything from the menu, from 1 to 3 eggs. \n\nI am a Florentine fan and this place has at least 5 different options to chose from! I got mine w/ salmon, capers and red onions with a side of spring salad. Yum! The poached egg was cooked to perfection and the hollandaise sauce was very light. It was perfect amount since I only ordered 1 egg, but next time I'll get 2 because that's a better deal, plus I can easily handle it if it tastes good like that! Aaron had a Greece scrambled eggs with spinach, feta, and red onions with a side of homefries. This was also flavored light but tasteful.  Eggs were cooked nice and fluffy, and the raw crunchy onions added the nice texture to it. The homefries were soft (not burned like other places) and nicely flavored.\n\nNo wonder why this place gets a good review.

It was totally delicious though: the fish soup, perfect on a damp and gloomy evening. I'm Bengali and I love \"macher jhol\", so I've been sampling fish stews whenever possible. Savory, tomato-y, and utterly comforting. I wish they swapped out mussels for more chunks of tender snapper, but that's just my personal mussel animosity talkin'. Crisp bread with jalapeno butter? Delicious, and kicky.\n\nI liked the small intimate space, and the way a fellow diner busted out a tuneful \"Happy Birthday\" for his companion, with extra vocal flourishes added by the waiter. The same waiter who turned butterfingers and knocked over our water jug twice.

If you have not been to Zazie for dinner, you have not been to Zazie. This is a very quaint and cozy French restaurant tucked away in Cole valley in San Fran. It's not fancy or pretentious, it's just a simple bistro  with surprisingly decent food.  Zazie is a great place for a casual meal or maybe a glass (or bottle) of wine with a few appetizers. Perfect for couples or small parties (4-6 people). The menu here doesn't disappoint. They have a very nice selection that should satisfy most needs and wants. Their mussel appetizer was very nice and the waitress even brought extra bread (without being asked to do so) just so we could sop up all the delicious broth. In addition, the waitress also brought us wine samples while we attempted to decide upon a wine selection, so the service was excellent. Dishes at the table included trout, pork chop, duck and the fish soup. All items were very well prepared and tasty and fairly authentic. While we were all too full to order dessert, the dessert menu also looked very appealing. Had I not been so full by the end of my meal I would have happily tried Zazie's Pot De Creme. I did however manage to choke down a latte. This was no easy task because the latte's here are HUGE. They're served in a large bowl (no handle) and while you might expect such a large latte to be quite milky and weak, my latte packed a punch. In fact I'd say Zazie is worth checking out for their latte's alone! If you've only been to Zazie for brunch, it's definitely worth a visit for dinner.

I had a gingerbread pancake with lemon curd and roasted pear plus a side of eggs.  To drink I ordered the zazie spritzer (cranberry, oj, seltzer).  Everything was good, but really nothing spectacular.  The bathroom, however, was the opposite of good.  There's only one - it's co-ed, about 2 feet from the kitchen pass-through window, the door slides closed and there's about a 1 inch gap most of the way around, it closes by one tiny hook latch, and there is exactly enough room inside for you to turn around in place.  Fine if you're a guy.  I'm not.\n\nUPDATE***\nAfter writing my review above I got an email from the owner explaining the bathroom situation.  Apparently Zazie is housed in a historic school building and bound by codes when it comes to remodeling, which prevents them from improving the bathroom situation.  I thought it was super cool of her to write, so I thought I'd give Zazie another try.  Met a girlfriend here for lunch with her 3 month old during the week.  This seems to be THE place to be if you have a small child at that time.  I ordered the burger and she had the croque madame.  Food was good, service was good, atmosphere was pleasant.

Five stars only if you're perfect!  That leaves few five stars.  I have been going to Zazie more often and i finally tried one of the benedict platters and realized why this place is awesome.  I hate poached eggs and i *crave* poached eggs from the zazie.  Plus, i have gotten to know the manager, Mario, especially well and realize that man works his tuckess off to make that place so awesome.  \n\nSo i have been here several times for breakfast, and the advantage with breakfast is that often you get it without the fuss, and fanfare of a busy dinner with other diners trying to snap up the waiter's attention before you can.  \n\nThe most redeeming part of Zazie is their Mango mimosas.  The second most redeeming quality is that i can order two eggs and a pancake of any kind and not have a plate served to me with a 5 egg omelet and a short stack.  They have the option on their menu to sample a little bit of everything (which i always encourage) in ones, twos and threes (olay!).  \n\nSo far i've tried the gingerbread pancakes with lemon curd (huh?) and it was interesting, but the pancakes end up being too dry and the only reason you even want that lemon curd is because you need something to moisten the pancakes because the syrup doesn't taste quite right with them.  \n\nI have also tried the lemon poppyseed pancakes that are only made occasionally and Damn!  Tha's all i can say.  Actually, i can say more.  Know how i mentioned the poached eggs?  i wanted more pancakes and that is just not like me....\n\nThen there is the Zazie omelet (or omelette du jour) which adds some avocado atop a cheesy eggedness and bacon.  This is a really fantastic omelette.  I recommend toast, and a big belly.\n\nThe Pain Paradise is just that.  Cinnamon french toast with bing cherries.  I don't think i've had something so good in a long time!  \n\nThe home fries are actually garlic roasted potatoes with full cloves mixed in and top off an already delicious and satifying breakfast.  While it's all a little pricey, it's worth the portions that are ample and the creative strokes added to commonality.  \n \nI have been lucky.  At opening hour, everyone has been amazingly considerate, except for the gruff \"it's not 8 o'clock yet.\" when i try to sit down inside at 7:55.

This was actually my 2nd trek to Zazie, the first, however I left because it was too crowded. This time i actually waited, which was much much faster than I thought. Although loads of people were waiting outside and we were the 11th name down on the list, the wait was less than 15 min. I guess people either just leaves or eat very fast. The little bistro style restaurant was quite snug and crowded, but yet cozy. \n\nMenu was simple/typical brunch food, many egg dishes, pancakes, bagels, etc. I ordered the Greek Scrambled eggs, a buttermilk pancake, and a coffee. The egg came with a side of sauteed potatoes quarters and 2 slice of toasts. The portion was bigger than I expected, maybe I shouldn't have ordered the pancake. Overall food was good and the service was excellent. Downside, a bit pricy for breakfast food (comparable to Stacks) and parking was difficult.", "author": "Peter L."}

It was a very common french bistro.  There was a back garden area that my friend and I sat.  It was cozy and very cute.  We were the douche bags that came in 5 mins before they closed for brunch.  I was still drunk from the night before so my perception of time was clouded.  The waiter graciously welcomed us considering the fact....When that happens to me, I want to stab people who love to come and eat at a restaurant before closing.  Anyways, I had some poached eggs with chorizo and hash potatoes.  They also had a complimentary tomatillo sauce that was off the hook.  The food was nothing fancy, but well composed and flavorful dishes.  So Good.  We ate like kings drank mineral water, expresso, and a dam good Bloody Mary with a pickled string bean.  I really couldn't ask for more.  The service was optimal.  The guy was a great waiter.  I wish more places like this existed.", "author": "A K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-23", "description": "The previous reviews already say how great this place is, so I won't repeat what you've already read. However, I did notice a few things that I thought would be helpful to share. First off, if you're going to have weekend brunch here, know how to ride the wait list wave. This place opens at 9am and by 9:10am every table is full. If you can't get there for 8:45am to put your name on the wait list, stay in bed an extra 45 minutes and show up at 9:45am to get a seat for 10am when the first wave exits. Get it? Good. \n\nSecondly, this is a tiny space where you need to play the tile game with the tables in order to wedge yourself into your seat. Don't get me wrong, it's cozy and cute, so it's all good, but god forbid you get seated next to one of those Hummer baby strollers - and if you have one, leave it home or get a ulock and secure it to one of the bike rails. \n\nLastly, for those of you who like a hearty breakfast with meat, check the menu beforehand. While you might see one or two entries with ham and one with chicken apple sausage, there isn't a wide selection and most of the time it's added on an extra. Also, the brunch menu basically has three sections - pancakes/french toast, scrambles and eggs benedict (which are wonderful) and there isn't a lot of crossover, so don't have your heart set on a fried egg (is it even on the menu?) and french toast (one of my favorite combos) with the extra chicken apple sausage, cause it isn't there. Unless you order each individually, which, you know... is extra. \n\nSeriously though it's great food with friendly people in a cozy place on a great street. I guess that makes it extra special too.", "author": "Michael A."}

People might rave about the homefries, but the potatoes at Zazie aren't homefries.  Good homefries should be perfectly seasoned and crisp, almost fulfilling a \"craving of French fries for breakfast\" as my high shcool friend, Larry H., put it.  The potatoes at Zazie are roasted potatoes.  There is a huge difference. Roasted potatoes tend to not be crisp and made with olive oil and herbs.  The roasted potatoes at Zazie weren't bad, a 3 star rating, but if you are looking for my definition of homefries, you'll be disappointed with Zazie's potatoes.\n\nThe Challah French Toast was another miss for me, a borderline 3 rating.  Challah is usually a great choice of bread for French toast but the bread didn't absorb the egg enough for me, and the French toast, though not bad, didn't have any distinguishable flavoring or unique taste that would motivate me to order again.   \n\nThe French Toast Tahiti was very good, a solid 4 star rating.  The French Toast Tahiti is stuffed with caramelized bananas and walnuts.  The caramelized bananas are particularly delicious.

The gracious host was very sweet to excuse my sudden burst into the restaurant that put a pause in everyone's conversation. \n\nThe host was exceptionally professional and offered to seat me immediately.

Given such a delay, I thought we were at the host's liberty. Surprisingly, the host did not pull any stunt or attitude. Instead he treated us like any other punctual dinner patron and comfortably seated us up front behind the fish bowl window, the best spacious table, IMHO. Another point for great service.\n\nEverything on the menu resonated with my palette that evening. To simplify my decision, I chose the prix fixe deal, comes highly recommended at a great value for $23.50 which covers an appetizer, entree, and dessert. The prix fixe dinner is available for every single dinner with no restrictions on day, hour, or portion.\n\nThat helped narrow my decision down to a pate de vollaile, fish soup provencale, and decadent vanilla creme brulee. My friends ordered mussels marinieres, salmon grillade, and petit pot creme au chocolat. The pate was wonderfully flavorful. \n\nGood gawd! I wonder if Zazie specializes in French seafood dishes. My fish soup included a juicy salmon. Although the menu listed sea bass, the wait staff did not mention the substitution, which was a bit odd, but the delicious dish made me quickly brush that \"dust\" off my shoulder. I tried my friend's succulent grilled salmon. I was expecting a dry texture, but the chef was able to seal in the moisture. All the seafood dishes tasted very fresh.\n\nFinally the desserts topped off the great evening. The prix fixe is a fabulous deal to satiate even the hungriest patron! I would recommend this place in a heartbeat!", "author": "Cathy H."}

But it is near my house, which is wonderful because I don't ever have to find parking and don't have to experience driving out to Cole Valley only to see hoards of people in line for breakfast! Living close by actually means that I get to come here sometimes when there is no wait, and that is a fabulous thing. \nThere are a zillion reviews for Zazie, so I won't bore you with the same old review, but I will list a few of my favorites and a few I'd rather not have ever again.\n\nBEST: Eggs Albert (although I get my eggs scrambled), un deux trois with chicken apple sausage (did someone say \"combo made in heaven?\"), pancakes in general, provencal fish soup (the small bowl)\n\nNO THANKS: Salade Betterave (it was not a cohesive salad and tasted thrown together, plus the beets weren't very good), Oatmeal Brulee (it was just a bit bland), the Scrambles in general are just too furiously scrambled... there is nothing delicate about them, which is important when scrambling eggs or else it winds up tasting like mush.\n\nCOMPLAINT: I think they should make more omelettes and they should make their omelettes differently. I hate omelettes that are like egg paties folded over the other ingredients. If I wanted an egg patty with a side of mushrooms, I would have ordered that... so put them inside the omelette, already! I don't care if that is a standard technique, it is not yummy and that's the most important aspect of good food... it tastes good. Plus, when I ordered an omelette once (and only once, in all fairness), it looked like my chihuahua could have eaten it and still been hungry. I know it comes with potatoes and toast and stuff, but if I want omelette, I want to eat mostly omelette and not rely on the accompaniments to fill me up. I love you Zazie, but really, fix the omelette problem.", "author": "Amanda C."}

Zazie has numerous variations of poached eggs on english muffins.\n\nAlso, they allow you to determine the size of your brunch.  Would you like one poached egg or two (or three or...)?  One piece of french toast or two (or...)?  I know, why don't you just eat one and leave the other?  Because I have no self-control.  I eat *everything* put in front of me, even if I'm way past full.\n\nI've also had their French Toast Tahiti (I think that was the name) -- french toast \"stuffed\" with carmelized bananas and walnuts.  While they weren't really stuffed (more like, put between two pieces of french toast), it was still quite tasty.  Although, I realize that I prefer savory for breakfast (but it just sounded sooo good).\n\nI subtracted one star b/c my eggs over medium were really eggs over easy.  There was even uncooked egg white, which kinda grossed me out.  I'm almost tempted to subtract another star for their slow service and long waits.  But the service, while slow, was still pleasant, and all good brunch spots seem to have ridiculously long waits these days (or rather, years?  I thought the dot-com bubble burst in '01 was going to bring us back to normal brunch waits; ***sigh***).\n\nUPDATE:  So, after writing this review, the owner writes me a very nice note.  I write her back and mention that the next time I go, I'll say hello.  \n\nI went again Presidents' Day Monday.  Things were quite busy, and I think the owner was working as the hostess.  I was going to say hello, but our service that day was just so bad, I didn't even feel like bothering. \n\nOur waitress was totally absent -- she never checked in on us, we had to keep looking for her to come outside again and then flag her down (can we get menus?  can I get another mimosa?  can we get more coffee?  hot sauce?  extra hollandaise?).  She never asked how our food was or else they would've gotten the feedback that there wasn't any hollandaise sauce (ok, maybe just a wee bit) on my boyfriend's poached eggs (albert) and that my poached egg was cooked hard (st. trop).\n\nEven if our service was terrible, our food was still pretty good (once we got the extra hollandaise, and I just got over the fact that if I wanted a new poached egg, I'd probably be waiting forever for it...  way past after my boyfriend would be done with his breakfast...).\n\nRelatedly, my boyfriend's sister went to Zazie for lunch last week and also had terrible service and terrible food (I only remember she'd mentioned cold toast brought with butter, which she wasn't able to spread).  So, I think this may be our last trip to Zazie for a while...  which I must admit I'm a little sad about b/c I do like their eggs...  but it's no good to leave brunch on a beautiful day feeling pissy b/c of your service.

If so, this is the place for you!  You can't from their menu online but you can order small portions of their brunch items like pancakes, french toast, etc., so you can order 1 french toast and 1 pancake so you can try 2 things at once.  Each piece is still pretty big and the total price would be the same as if you ordered 1 large item.  \n\nI tried the1 Gingerbread pancake which was probably 10 inches in diameter!  Huge!  The lemon curd and roasted pear was yummy but it seemed too little for the size of the pancake.  I also tried a piece of the Challah french toast which was just as delicious.  My husband had the egg benedict with crab meat that you can order a small portion of 1 (but he had 2) and this wasn't a huge portion even for 2.  It was quite tasty.  I love crab.  It comes with potatoes which was very good too.  We even ordered an extra side of potatoes for the table to share.  The group of us ordered a bottle of champagne a carafe of juice to make mimosa for the table.  If you're a big group, go for this option.\n\nWe went on a Sunday, a group of 8, and had to wait about 1 hour.  They don't take reservations, it's first come first serve, put your name on a list, and wait to be called.  If you're a smaller party of 2 to 4, I think you can get a seat within 1/2 hour since they serve their food pretty quickly.  If it's a long wait, you can always go to Peet's next door and get a cup of joe first.\n\nZazie has outdoor patio seating in the back which is great on a nice warm day.   It's very cute!

Been going there periodically for five years....not anymore.  Was in for breakfast, eggs were supposed to be over medium and instead came with yolks almost totally cooked while whites were runny....and all edges were burned. I sent them back and ordered scrambled instead.  I didn't make a big fuss.  They brought back the pancake and bacon and at that point (I\"m thinking long before however) those things were bone cold....I mean, the butter wasn't even close to getting soft on the pancake and the bacon...well, at least it was cooked.  I at less than half, paid and tipped properly and went to speak to the manager, who I think may be the owner.  I asked to step away from the customers and he said, \"no, right here I'm very busy\".  So I explained that my food was very cold and that I thought there may be an issue with the kitchen since I heard another table sending food back.  Instead of apologizing, he basically accused the other table of not ordering the right way and completely ignored my feedback about my cold food.  At that point it was very clear he didn't want to hear it so I told him I wouldn't be back.  I was not abusive or rude in any way at any time, and I was not trying to get a comped meal which is why I specifically paid and tipped first....I was merely trying to provide feedback about my experience and he didn't want to hear it.

The wait was around 1 hour at 10:30 in the morning.  So, if you're not up for waiting for a while, put your name down, go walk around and check out the area and then come back every 15-20 minutes to check if your table is ready.  The place is very very cramped so not really conducive for large parties unless you're willing to wait for a really long time.  \n\nThere were three of us so we got three different dishes so that we could share:\n\n1) Gingerbread Pancakes\n2)  Tahitian French Toast\n3)  La Mer (Dungeness Crab with Poached eggs and avocado in an English Muffin)\n\nAll were very yummy, but I would have to say that their Tahitian French Toast was my favorite.  It wasn't too sweet and it was just the right portion.  The Gingerbread Pancakes were good too, but not sure it lived up to all the hype other yelpers gave it.  The dungeness crab is hard to go wrong.  The one thing I will say though is that the poached egg was cooked to perfection and oozed just the right amount.  \n\nHighly recommended for a brunch place if you don't mind the wait.", "author": "Kristie G."}

Delicious thick toast cooked very well: crispy toasted outside, perfectly soft inside.

I'd heard good things about it - especially the benedicts - so I was looking forward to a great meal.  They have a large variety of items to choose from but since I'd heard so much about the benedicts, I decided upon 2 poached eggs with shrimp, avocado and hollandaise sauce.  The eggs were poached hard (and I mean nothing running at all and light yellow) and they were the smallest eggs I've seen served at a restaurant.  The sides of them were stringy and tasted like vinegar and there was barely enough hollandaise sauce to cover the eggs let alone dip your muffin into and keep it moist.  The side of potatoes was ok and I liked the additional touch with the roasted cloves of garlic even if I chose to not eat them since I was going somewhere afterwards.  The avocado was fresh and the shrimp were tender and tasty but given the sad shape of the egg, it was not worth the money.\nMy bill included a $1.00 surcharge per person for SF medical care.  While I'm in favor of paying for heath care, I don't think it should be a surcharge but it should be added into the prices upfront or state it clearly/put it on the menu so that you don't take your first time diner by surprise.  While I don't live in SF anymore and don't get to eat there that often I have not run into it anywhere else.  I ate at two other places that day that didn't have a surcharge and I've been going up about once a month to different places I used to frequent and not seen it at any of those places.

I must say that I dragged my boyfriend out of the house to try this place because I am a fan of breakfast and even more so of new places. We got to Zazie's around 12pm, not so much breakfast but they do serve it till 3pm on the weekends. We put our name on the list and waited for about 20 min....not too bad. ( don't get frightened by the long list..it actually moves really fast) \n\nWe got seated in the patio area which was nice since the weather was amazing. The table was very small and i had to climb over a post to get to my seat. My boyfriend is a football player so he definitely did not appreciate the tiny table. The waitress came up right away and was friendly yet not annoying ( a rare combination :) ). She bought me coffee which was strong and good and my bf had a fresh squeezed orange juice. I ordered Fontainbleau: with portobellos, shiitake, porcinis, spinach, fontina. It came with Toast and Potatoes. The scramble was a little too wet and i wasn't a fan of the cheese but that might have been my fault for ordering it. The potatoes are made with roasted garlic but tasted a little bland. My bf had simple eggs, pancake, and bacon combo. He said also that the eggs were a lil wet and bacon was good but no crispy. The pancake was very good and flavorful. Overall for the two of us it was $35 breakfast with tip. A little too pricey for a not so spectacular of a meal.

All I remember about it was shivering on the patio and remarking to my companions that it was the most expensive breakfast I'd ever eaten - which I didn't intend to sound cheap, but rather just observational, with wonder. So now, several years later, I'm there for dinner and I'm financially better off, so it was less noteworthily expensive (though still not cheap). We were there on a Wednesday night and it was crowded only a few minutes after we arrived for an early dinner before the Morrissey show, so if the place looks empty - hurry in there!\n\nMy friend and I both got the prix fixe option, which is a pretty good deal for $21.50 - a choice of select starters, appetizers, and a dessert. We both started with the Salade Louis Malle (it all makes sense - Louis Malle directed 'Zazie dans le metro'!), which was good - cheese on a salad = yay. Then as en entree, I had the salmon grillade, which I liked. Though it seemed a bit dry - kind of crying out for some oil or sauce or something. My friend had the fish soup, which looked good. Especially the cheese (some of which I stole to give some moisture to my fish) and the spicy toasts.\n\nWe ended with the best part - pot du creme au chocolat!!! It was heavenly. It made up for the dry fish and slow service (I think we were sussed out by the waitress as cheapskates or something. It seemed like a lot of the time she was standing by the kitchen not doing much rather than meeting our gaze when we needed anything). \n\nFinal verdict - a little too pricey for my budget on a regular basis, but definitely enjoyable.", "author": "Emily M."}

So our minds gravitated to the next best thing...brunch! You thought I was gonna say sex didn't you, admit it ;-) \n\nWe decided to walk around and check out what Cole Valley had to offer before settling on Zazie.

The restaurant is really small and they have an outdoor patio in the back but it was way too cold for that. We had reservations at about 6pm and only 1 table was occupied at the time. However, over the span of our 1.5 hour dinner, the place became packed. All the tables were full and people waiting for their reservation/table were crowding the entrance.\n\nThey were baking the crumble dessert during our dinner and the whole restaurant smelled delicious. My mouth was watering as I waited for my food and it just smelled like Christmas.\n\nI ordered the hanger steak for my entree. The mashed potatoes were really good and the brandy cream sauce was delicious. I wish I had more of it! The steak was average. I ordered it medium and felt that the middle of the steak was very well cooked. However, the outside was too charred and felt tough. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the crumble because I had to see what the smell was about. It was a HUGE portion. The crumble was steaming hot and served in a medium-sized cereal bowl/cappuccino mug sort thing. And there was a generous scoop of ice cream on top. It was delicious. I didn't dominate the dessert as much as I would have liked because I was so full from my main course.\n\nStaff was average. Food was decent but I will have to come back and try their brunch to see what that hype is all about.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

It also serves up some of the most authentic, perfectly-cooked French fare in the entire city, has cozy decor, impeccably friendly and prompt service from happy staff, fantastic special events, and completely caters to its guests.  Jen Piallat, the owner, is one of the most welcoming restaurant personalities I've ever had the pleasure of coming across, and is earning rave reviews for every possible good reason there is.

I had the Le Mer poached eggs with dungeness crab and the crab portion was half the size of the same dish I had a week before. Needless to say this was disappointing. The first time I had it it was beautifully done with big hunks of lump crab and silky avocado slices. The second time it looked like a very tired cook scraped what was left of the crab and stuck it on my serving. Consistency is important since I was being charged $14.95 for a poached egg dish. Still, I like this place a lot and the staff rocks!!! They'll get a couple more chances before I search for another brunch spot. \n\nBurger at lunch during the week is 4.5 Stars. One of the best and well made burgers I've had in the last year. It would have gotten a 5 Star rating if it had been served with some good Frites. It is $9.95 but I thought it worth every penny. The downside is they don't serve it on the weekend brunch menu. Try it medium rare or medium. You will not be disappointed!!!", "author": "Huy N."}

For a vegetarian to find a delicious, well-spiced, nuanced dish that is also gluten free is a rarity in this city of bone marrow eaters.  My friend had the Hanger Steak with mushroom sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus - the asparagus was perfectly done - it seemed to be roasted so the flavor bloomed - and he said the rest of the plate was very good, and he has eaten all over the world.  We shared the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e for desert with a bit of Port, and they both were delightful.  This place really feels European.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-06-30", "description": "6/30/2007: I walked past this place on my way to the Haight with some friends who were visiting from out of town. I saw Zazie in the corner of my eye and was immediately drawn to it from across the street. When I walked into the restaurant, I was very warmly greeted by one of the servers and when I saw that they had a gorgeous little back patio, I was immediately reminded of La Note on Shattuck (which is arguably one of the most adorable eateries I know of in the Bay Area) \n\nNaturally, I opted to eat out in the back patio and enjoy some sun on what was a really lovely day, but when I was led outside with my friends, we were hastily seated by a flustered server. It took about 15 minutes to have our order taken. She looked quite busy as she looked like she was the only server on the patio that day. Having been a server myself in the past, I understood the stress she must have been feeling and tried to be as empathetic as possible. However, having realized that she didn't take our drink order, I tried to ask her for water for myself and my friends when she had the chance to do so. I was incredibly turned off when she basically snapped at me in front of my friends and curtly said \"Look, I'm really busy right now. I'll get it for you when I can.\" \n\nMy friends at that point were so turned off that they just wanted to up and leave, but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. We stayed and chatted, and people watched and about 10 minutes later, we noticed an older couple that walked onto the patio looking to be seated. The same server basically told the couple in the same curt manner that she spoke to me in, that there was no room on the patio (there were 5 tables open) and when they pointed that fact out to her, she said that they were closing in 2 minutes. The couple looked baffled and turned to leave the restaurant. The manager intervened and had the couple seated, and the server and manager had a bit of a row. She also seemed to have had a mild breakdown and left the patio altogether for a few minutes while mild chaos ensued. \n\nIt was an awkward scenario to have found myself in and my friends and I were really uncomfortable. Finally our food came. My friend had an eggs benedict dish with crab, and I had the grilled chicken sandwich. I was half expecting something delicious like La Note's grilled chicken, but I was turned off by the dried pieces of chicken jerky sitting on two slices of wheat toast. To be fair, my friend's dish was pretty good and I should know better than to order something so banal as a grilled chicken sandwich at a place that probably has what is otherwise great French food. However, I cannot ignore the fact that my dish was simply subpar and the service I experienced on the patio was incredibly unprofessional and just plain rude. \n\nWe tipped 10 percent, which  I NEVER do, but I truly felt that our server gave us the worst service I've experienced here in the city. It's a shame because all of the other servers were warm and friendly. Perhaps it was an off day at this place, all I know is that I will not be coming back to give it another chance.\n\nUPDATE 7/4/07: So within a few days of writing this review, I received a  very nice message from the owner of the restaurant apologizing profusely for the incident and assuring me that it was not a common thing to have happen and promised to rectify the situation in any way she could. I am so pleased that she genuinely takes interest in what her customers' satisfaction and I have added one star for her merits.", "author": "Clarissa S."}

If I were looking for a brunch place next time, I'll probably end up coming to Zazie again.  \n\nThe wait is tolerable despite the conspicuous crowd outside.  Or at least the cheerful wait list guy (apparently keeping track of the wait list is a full time job cuz it's THAT busy) makes it seem okay.  He is smiling and joking around with customers, so I end up not feeling frustrated and cranky either.\n\nI am not a big Brunch person because I always get French Toast.  I bore myself with that choice.  So I took a risk and ordered the Poached Eggs St. Trop, with two eggs and some smoked salmon.  Oooh, delicious!  Probably because the Hollandaise sauce isn't overpowering like a lot of places tend to make them.  We also tried the French Toast which I am glad that I didn't get.  It just seems to have too much \"stuff\" in there.  Bananas and nuts, maybe? Possibly some other ingredients too.  I don't know. \n\nMy favorite part is the atmosphere.

I'm visiting a friend who lives a block from Zazie, so he's already put our name down.\n\nNevertheless, we wait...and wait...and wait.  Oddly enough, I wasn't cranky from the wait, perhaps b/c it was just a glorious day, I was with friends, and I was distracted by all the cute babies and dogs on the sidewalk.  But I'm just saying - we WAITED a loooong time.\n\nAnd that wait was well worth it.  We sat out back on the charming patio.  Weakened by the hunger and the wait, I made two potentially debatable decisions: (1) I ordered a Bloody Mary (hair of the dog and all that...) and (2) I ordered one of their dishes with Hollandaise.  Now, there was just a reasonably high-profile \"bad hollandaise\" food-poisoning scandal at a popular brunch spot in LA, but I took the risk anyway since half of Zazie's menu involves the stuff.\n\nAll I can say is I did some of my best decision-making that morning, hungover and all.  Bloody Mary - perfectly iced and salted/peppered - wiped away the headache and the eggs were amazing.  Perfectly poached eggs + hollandaise + BACON = heaven.  Also, the home fries were fantastic-ly garlic-y.\n\nThe garden patio is awesome too.\n\nJust go and wait - it'll be worth it.", "author": "Eric T."}

I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich with a small cranberry juice and my friend ordered the ahi tuna sandwich. The food was alright: quality was good but the portions are not worth the money. The sandwich was about $13.50 and there was hardly any salmon in it, most of it was just lettuce. The small cranberry juice I ordered was incredibly small and warm as well, not worth it's price in my opinion. The aspect that really docked off points was the service. We had a rude waiter who treated us like he wanted to just seat us, serve us, and get us out asap. When he handed me my cranberry juice, he literally just held it out for me to grab and wasn't even looking in my direction, like serving me was a nuisance to him. My friend was short changed for the bill but in their defense, it was only 2 cents, nothing to cry over. However, when we told the waiter he said \"Ok\" and dumped our bill on some counter top and never got back to it. We waited about 5 minutes to let them sort it out and when it was apparent no one was going to take care if it we just decided to take our change and leave. Again, I don't think 2 cents is worth complaining about but he wasn't asking the waiter to perform a difficult task either.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-22", "description": "Zazie is a romantic little French restaurant that gets very little ink for just how good it is. Every dish has been delicious (I've heard, as I only order one thing, save for the surprise Prix Fixe menu on Valentine's Day). Zazie is perfect for a special occasion; the atmosphere is really great inside, which you will almost never hear me talk about, but for a nice place it lacks the snobbishness of many others. Every meal starts with an incredibly fresh and hot roll, which is far too small for how delicious it is. This roll was definitely a precursor of what was to come. And to end the meal they have some insanely decadent desserts. My favorite is the chocolate-coma inducing Baked Chocolat Chaud, which tastes almost like brownie batter topped with tons of melted marshmallows. Absolutely delicious.\n\nBut none of that matters here. What is important is that Zazie is hands down the best place to take your significant other for a special occasion/romantic dinner, and still have one of the best burgers you can get your hands on. They offer one burger, the Zazie burger, with white cheddar, tomatoes proven\u00e7als, and a side of grilled potatoes. I don't know what tomatoes proven\u00e7als are, so they are swept off to the girlfriends plate. The bacon for a $2 additional charge is well worth it, and brings the total for this bad boy to $14.\n\nThe whole time you wait for your burger, all you can do is think about that tiny roll they served you early on. I think the service is reasonably quick, but after eating that little roll the only thing running through my head is how I could probably eat about 20 more, or if the people at the table next to me won't be looking when the waitress drops off their rolls. Time seems to just crawl, which is just about all I can do after eating the burger and then the dessert. Finally the burger arrives, and it delivers. The bun is just as good as that little roll, buttery and crisp on the outside. White cheddar has been popping up more often lately, and it is a trend I like (hopefully it becomes the next pomegranate or avocado or sweet potato fries). The white cheddar and bacon, again a crucial addition, are a stellar combination. It's obvious Zazie takes pride in what they serve, and both the cheese and bacon are rich and flavorful. The bacon is crispy enough where you won't have to worry about pulling the rest of it out when you first bite into it, which as we all know can throw off the whole balance of a burger. Surprisingly, the fancy leafy greens on top also compliment the burger very well.\n\nThis has to be one of the most well-balanced and refined burgers out there, while still being a true burger. I didn't know this burger existed when I went to Zazie for the first time, and was expecting to have to eat something way too \"fancy\" where I'd just end up pushing about half the plate to the side. Instead I was absolutely blown away by this burger. Wouldn't matter if this was from a burger shack, a trailer, or the fanciest restaurant, this is a top 5 burger all the way. Add in the killer dessert, and the fact that you can impress your date there, who will be more than happy with their menu whatever their taste may be, and you've got one of best experiences for any burger lover.\n\nIf this burger were any cheaper, I'd be there twice a month for sure.\n\n-Burger and Destroy", "author": "Mike M."}

Here we were, a group of 5, on one of the biggest brunch days of the year, New Years Day (AKA national hangover day must enjoy the hair that bite the dog so I don't kill myself). The waiting list was three pages. We were on page three. The staff told us we could wait at the bar next door. They were never touchy when you came back to see where you were on the list. In fact, they were nice! All and all, the hour wait went by rather quickly. \n\nWhen we finally sat down, the service was also good. We ordered a rather expensive, but rather crisp and delicious champagne. My friends and I were having SUCH a good time and that champagne was really working it's magic on my hangover. As for food, I ordered the ALBERT which comes with poached eggs over tomatoes and bacon with hollandaise. My friends all got different variations of poached egg dishes. One of them got the LA MER with avocado and crab, which she really enjoyed. All in all though, I wasn't very impressed with the food. When the bill came I was sad that I had to pay 28 bucks (large parties = gigantic tip that boosts up your costs even if you only had one thing). My friend's boyfriend found his meal really bland and said that it really wasn't worth what we walked out paying. I'd have to agree. I enjoyed my time there but the food was really unexceptional. I kept thinking about how great our day was but how much greater it would have been had we eaten at the French restaurant I'd just been to in Philadelphia, Parc. There everything was so good, and I mean everything. Why can't more restaurants in SF be reasonably priced and have EVERYTHING that hits your table be a smashing hit?

The weather in cole valley is not the best, but the heat lamps in the back help. The eggs genevieve was delicious. The eggs were light, fluffy, and delicious. The white cheddar and black forest ham provided nice contrast to the egg. The home fries were soft with crispy edges and well seasoned. The avocado was sliced fresh while the toast was nice and crisp. The smoked salmon sandwich was awesome. The salmon had the right amount of salt and smoke, without overpowering the fish. The capers and red onion complimented the fish wonderfully. There didn't seem to be any cream in the cream of mushroom soup, but it was still good. The earthy flavor of the mushrooms was brought out by just the right amount of salt.\nOverall, everything here was great. I can't think of any place with better brunch food.

Mine did not.  \n\nWe waited a minute.  I told them to eat so their food wouldn't be cold.  They cut into their fancy benedict breakfasts and one egg on each plate was rock solid.  Since I still had no food in front of me, my sister gave me a bite of the one egg that was OK, we had eaten half of the little benedict stack  when the server finally arrived with my food.  My sisters asked to have their solid eggs replaced.  We asked for a little plate to put the over cooked eggs on so we could continue eating what was properly cooked.  Instead the server took both of their plates away.  Now I was the only one with a plate.  After a few minutes we asked the server how much longer until we got the replacement eggs.  The server replied, \"well at least you have one plate\" .  WTF?!\nStarving... my sisters and I ate all the food on my plate.  Our server was at this point no where to be seen.  Fifteen minutes later the two plates came back to our table.

Fortunately the wait was fairly short (~15 minutes) and we were able to sit outside in the back.  \n\nAlmost everything on the menu looked pretty good and I couldn't decide between pancakes or eggs, but I ended up going with the Fountainbleu scamble.  The neat thing about the menu is that you have the option of choosing 1, 2, or 3 eggs or pancakes so you can make your own combo for those that like to have the savory and sweet at the same time. \n\nMy eggs were ok, but was almost cold by the time I got it.  The BF's BLT ended up being one side of an open faced sandwich consisting of a slice of some sort of crusty artisan bread shmeared with some of cheese (I forgot what kind), sitting under a few strips of bacon and some roasted tomatoes.  The lettuce part came in the form of a salad on the side.  \n\nService could have been improved a little.  We didn't get utensils until after our food arrived and we had to have another server help us since our server wasn't around.  \n\nOverall, if I was really hungry, I wouldn't go here because of the parking, the wait and the not-so-huge portions.

Everyone south of the Marina knows about brunch but my favorite is the Tuesday night \"no corkage\" dinner. Bring your friends, a bottle or three of your favorite wine, and enjoy country French cuisine with exceptional (yet chill) service.\n\nRecently, some friends and I had the Steak au Poive - which never disappoints, the lamb chop and cous cous with currant special - insane and perfectly prepared, and the rabbit which was, as expected, quite good. The salad Betterave, which I\"ve had before, was a little lacking in flavor...but fresh and fair enough.\n\nThe food is solid and unpretentious while being a bit off the beaten SF path.

The Zazie spritzer was a nice fresh juice in the morning that wasn't too sweet and extra bonus points for filling my cappuccino mug with drip coffee after I was done, the wait staff knows a caffeine addict when they see one.\n\nThe interior is very warm and welcoming and all the French stuff on the walls add a touch.

I'm talking about the friends of mine who've been like \"hey, Zazie is really good!\"\n\nThen again all my friends eat crap.\n\nUsually Zazie has about 217 (fairly accurate estimation) people waiting and shuffling around in front between 11am and 1pm on the weekends.  I went over to Tully's and sucked down a few quarts of coffee before going over there at about 1:50pm.  We put our name in before walking around for a few minutes:\n\nProps on the service.  The guy hosting outside actually made an effort to come up and ask if we were waiting and where we were in the list.  On seeing we were next for 2, he immediately seated us at a just cleaned table.  Our waitress was very nice and eschewed sweet-talking us.  We asked her to contrast the pancakes with fruit and the gingerbread pancakes with lemon curd.  She told us straight out that the gingerbread were absolutely awesome and the pancakes with fruit was something we could probably get somewhere else.  That takes some balls.\n\nThe food was delicious.  The (Ron) Mexico scramble (chorizo, eggs, cheese, salsa) was great and the garlic potatoes were tasty.  The whole thing came with thick ass slices of fresh wheat toast.  The gingerbread pancakes with lemon curd were absolutely awesome.  I'm not a huge pancake fan, but I had to start digging into my dining partner's leftovers.  I thought they would be too sweet but the gingerbread worked well with the curd.\n\nThe prices are also great.  I had an awesome, proper sit down brunch that was higher in quality and cheaper than what I had a Frjtz recently.  I know those two places don't exactly compare well but you would think Zazie would be more expensive.  The decor was good as well.  It's obvious it promotes itself as a sort of pseudo French bistro, but it doesn't go overboard and try to \"convince\" you that this in fact what it is.  The spaces can be a little cramped but hopefully you're too focused on the food to let that bother you.\n\nIt does kind of blow that you have to come here either at 9am or after 1:30p, but as I've mentioned before, it's probably for a good (tasty) reason.", "author": "Steven R."}

(Note: the eggs were scrambled, and we both subbed in a gingerbread pancake with lemon curd and a baked Bosc pear.) The pancake was heavenly: easily the best carb-based experience I've had in the past year, if not ever. The tanginess of the lemon curd complemented the spices in the pancake, and the pear had just the right texture. Bacon was pretty good, though a bit fatty. The eggs (in both orders) were undercooked; my boyfriend, being the agreeable person that he is, ate his, but I just picked at mine. My mimosa was heavy on the champagne(!) Despite the runniness of the eggs, I will be back! In the meantime, I'm going to scout a recipe for gingerbread pancakes...\n\nUPDATE: This time around, Zazie did not fail to impress. The gingerbread pancakes were as good as I remembered, the bacon was leaner (and crispy: holla for cronchy bacon!), and the grapefruit juice mimosa was the most refreshing boozy breakfast drink I've had in quite some time. Service was also friendly. Yay, Zazie: our out-of-town guests were also smitten!", "author": "Kate G."}

We got seated on the patio, which is lovely on those rare warm days in the city.  You're close enough to other tables where it's a bit intimate, but not too nosy.  We split a carafe of a Rose wine and had quite a bit of food to wash it down with during our 1.5 hour meal.  We got served hot bread & butter, then ordered buttered noodles for the lil' one, mussels and a cheese plate for ourselves for appetizers and the lamb and salmon for entrees.  All of the food was well-prepared and nicely presented.  The lamb entree is large and definitely good for 2 people.  The salmon was steamed in parchment and a little over-done for our taste, but still tasted good. For dessert, we got the fruit crumble and it was nice, especially w/ice cream on the side.  Zazie's also very kid-friendly; they brought out paper and crayons for the lli' one right away and on Wednesdays there's free mac-n-cheese or ice cream for the lil' ones.  \n\nWhile I think the food is delicious, it wasn't quite 5-star worthy.  I think this is a nice neighborhood-y eatery -- the service was good and the food was good.  Still, it wasn't \"great\" enough to make me want to come back here often.  It may be a repeat for brunch if I can get there early enough, based on all the other Yelp reviews of long waits on the weekend.", "author": "T M."}

Somehow, though, after you're finally seated, you aren't made to feel rushed - although there are still 3000 starving people camped out on the sidewalk.\n\nNote: If you're willing to sit at outer sidewalk tables, there's usually no wait. Inside, moderate. Garden, give it at least 20-30 minutes.\n\nBut it's ok b/c Mario (the host most weekends) has a way of making you feel tended to despite the wait. Then, if you go back again and again, he goes out of his way to greet you each time, make you feel this is your own private Cheers spot. He might easily do this for everyone he vaguely recognizes - but I am happy to buy the illusion that I am special when I walk in the door. Why not?\n\nThey have a nice dinner, too - $20 prix fixe. Slower, quieter hour for this place. The food is good (esp the fresh pasta) - but the portions are inconsistent at times. But if you're lucky, Suhail might treat you to a glass of wine for no reason at all. \n\nAnd yes, for non-neighbors, parking is a bitch.

It must be a new form of product placement. William Gibson would be proud. \n\nIt seems that Zazie offers the best brunch experience in the City. I mean, brunch is the best meal of the week, so you should not accept any compromise. Choose the best and forget the rest. Choose life, choose Zazie! Believe and obey.\n\nIt seems that Zazie's menu features all the right keywords: Mimosa, Sunshine, Soju, Pancakes, French Toast, Tartine and Toilette. \n\nIt seems that all the movie buffs are in love with this place because it is named after Louis Malle's whimsical \"Zazie dans le Metro\" (1960). No, it is not an example of the French Nouvelle Vague, but it quite enjoyable nonetheless. Like Zazie's dishes.\n\nIt seems that everybody agrees on one thing: Zazie has a killer patio. People would do anything to get the best spot. Murder is one of the options. All is fair in love and war.\n\nIt seems that people come from all over the world to have brunch at Zazie. For instance, I moved to San Francisco because commuting every weekend from Europe had become a bit too intense. Don't get me wrong, Air France is cool but they don't offer a killer patio.\n\nIt seems that everything here is great but coffee. Ok, I don't want to start a feud here, I love the French, but they still don't know how to make a proper espresso. Now, there's is no need to recall the Zidane-Materazzi incident here. Why can't we all get along?\n\nIt seems that people are willing to do spend hours in line just to get a table with some food on it, so it must be good. Psychologists call this 'the social proof effect'. I met a gorgeous psychologist at Zazie once,. I'm telling you, it's true. [Also known as a false syllogism]. \n\nIn short, how can you possibly not love Zazie?\n\nGuideline: Rent the movie, first. \n\nThen, order a pancake. \n\nEverything will make sense, in the end. It always does.\n\nPS\nThe best line in \"Zazie dans le metro\"?

I went here with my fiance and his family today for breakfast. There were 5 of us and we had to write our name on the list that was hung on the front of their door. I think our wait time was approximately 25-35 minutes. Once we were seated, the waiter told us of their daily special: open face omelette with bacon, cheese, and basil. I ordered that and had mine with a side salad instead of home fries. The omelette was very good and the portion was decent for me. However, two of the people that I went with had to order extra pancakes. Overall, I was very satisfied with the food and service. I recommend this to people who like to try new places and don't mind a little wait.", "author": "Anh W."}

An ex-colleague's boyfriend works there (his name's Ryan, and he's fabulous, so tip him well, friends!) and she recommended it as a fantastic place for brunch. In fact, I'd heard positive reviews from SO many people, I simply had to try it for myself. The line is LONG on Sundays, so make sure you wear some warm clothes and stay close by after you put your name on the reservation list. My friend and I realized we had a long wait, so we perused Cole Hardware and walked a few shops over to Tully's. We overestimated our wait time and lost our seats, but the reservation guy was nice enough to seat us asap when we explained what had happened, so it all worked out well. \n\nDecor/atmosphere: cozy, intimate, Parisian, love it!\n\nWaitstaff: Busy, polite, and not overly intrusive... our waiter forgot the mimosas we'd ordered, but got them for us immediately.\n\nFood: With the vast array of brunch choices, it was difficult to make a decision. My friend and I both ordered poached eggs/eggs benedict. I chose the Pierre Noir (with bacon and tomatoes provencales) with a side salad and he chose the Monaco (with proscuitto and tomatoes provencales) with home fries. There are whole cloves of garlic in the home fries, so be careful!  So, finally the waiter brings our plates... and my food was cold. *sigh* It was disappointing, to say the least. I'm a bit of an eggs benedict afficionado and order it whenever I go out to a new breakfast/brunch joint, and I have to say that I was really not that  impressed with what Zazie put in front of me. I did like the lemony Hollandaise sauce, which was not too heavy or overpowering (like some sludge a greasy spoon might use). Perhaps I'd have thought differently about the meal it if it had been hot. My Corsica (champagne and grapefruit juice) mimosa was absolutely divine, though, so I might just come back next Sunday for another and get something other than poached eggs. The portions are not that large, but you're allowed to choose one to three eggs for the benedict plates. One was obviously not enough for me,so I'd recommend that you get at least two... and three for those with larger appetites!\n\nI rate Zazie as a 3.5 (but a 4 for Yelp because there are no halves available) and hope that the next time I go, I can give it a 5!\n\nhttp://zaziesf.com/zaziesf/home.html", "author": "Suzi G."}

Waited in a line that didn't move for a half an hour.  Went over to Zazie.  Heard good things.  Waited another 20 minutes.  But the line was moving along and got seated.  The staff was nice, efficient, prompt.  The customers were the usual bougie obnoxiousness one finds in highly reviewed, or French, place (this one gets the daily double).  Mainly white, boring, snobby clientele.  There was a table behind me that was pretty sweet, of some older dudes just chillin.  They were talking loudly and were way pumped, which bummed out a lot of aspiring soccer mom yuppie ladies with sour lemon looks on their faces but put a smile on my face.  Why do people in the bay area hate loud talking so much?  I'm from LA, which I guess is similar to New York in that being boisterous and in a good mood is a sign of life and something to be encouraged rather than frowned upon.  But anyway, ordered Croque Madame, which is pretty standard.  My woman chose some Hollandaise.  We had coffee.  The coffee was outstanding.  The water glasses smelled like poo-poo.  Not sure why.  I'm a filthy man and drank the water anyway, I don't care.  My woman was bummed though, and barely touched it after she sniffed the situation.  The food was adequate.  I enjoyed it.  The problem is this: the reviews for this place are far overzealous, and the bill is disproportionate to both the quality and the amount.  For thirty bucks I expect us to walk away having eaten amazing food or at least feeling full.  Neither thing occurred.  I'd honestly rather get some tasty desayunos for less than ten dollars and not wait in a line next time, but you live, love, laugh, learn, and try bougie, highly-reviewed places.", "author": "Whitney D."}

It's a beautiful space -- both indoors and outdoors -- with great service and delicious food.  Even before my husband and I got engaged, we always talked about what a great place it would be to get married.  We both liked the idea of an intimate, unique space in the city that was special to us and yet still large enough to accommodate 70-80 guests.  When we did decide to get married -- on three months' notice -- one of the first things we did was email Zazie and we are so grateful that we did.  We met with Zazie's owner, Jen, and instantly knew that we wanted her and her restaurant to be a part of our wedding.  Jen thought it was hilarious how soon we wanted to get married (she initially thought we were asking about May of the following year not the May ten weeks away) but was unflappable and so supportive and enthusiastic about making our plans work out the way we wanted.  She also recommended both the florist (Anna from Loop Event Arts) and ceremony venue (Golden Gate Park) that we ended up using.  We met with Jen a few times to sample food and wine and put together our menu, but other than that she and our florist worked together to handle everything which was perfect since my husband and I both had a million things going on during that time.  The reception itself was so special and meaningful.  Jen was there the entire time tending bar and overseeing everything, and the Zazie staff was incredible.  By the end of the night, our guests were on a first name basis with everyone working our wedding, and they really made us feel as though we were at home there.  As won't be a surprise to anyone that's eaten at Zazie, the food was incredible and we got so many compliments from our guests that it was the best food they had ever eaten at a wedding.  After dinner, we cleared the tables out of the indoor dining area to convert the dining room into a dance floor.  There was no cut-off time and our guests stayed as late as they wanted.  We feel so blessed to have been able to have the exact wedding that we wanted and are so grateful to Jen and everyone at Zazie for making it happen.", "author": "Meghan W."}

When you've got a neighborhood place like this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner you're lucky. \n\nIt was hell to get a table here during the dot com boom, though I overheard the most absurd detached conversations about SF, fine expensive wine, and the tech biz.

Not sure how he keeps his cool on weekends given how testy the hungry customers can be, but he does. I hope he's paid for it.

It was hard to imagine that anyone could deal with it the way Julia did but Mario stepped up to the plate. \n\nMy sweetie bemoans the portions (small in his opinion), hates the new teapots, and usually comes on Sunday when the service and food is admittedly the worst.

Their gingerbread pancakes are amazing, and I love the fact that you can order one, two, or three eggs for many of their dishes. I hate brunch, but I'll come here because it's worth it. I recommend getting here early unless you like waiting for an hour, although they do a good job of crowd management without it feeling like a stressful clusterfrack.\n\nIt's also an excellent spot for dinner. Their food is simple but good, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and they have a great wine list. The prix fix makes it doable for more than just a special occasion.", "author": "Patrick T."}

My boyfriend and I moved to San Francisco fairly recently and have been working our way around the city's various brunch spots.  I've wanted to try Zazie for awhile especially based on all the stellar reviews.\n\nAnyway, we made our way over to Zazie this morning where we waited for about 45 minutes which was to be expected.  Once inside, the service was fast (maybe a bit too fast) as the food was pretty lukewarm by the time it made it to our table.  We ordered two of the poached egg dishes and a gingerbread pancake.  My bf had coffee and I had hot cocoa.\n\nThe food was ok, pretty much standard brunch fair, with a slight twist and a few extra dollars added to the price to match.  It tasted like any non-descript quickly prepared brunch food.  We got the check and were slightly surprised by the $40 price tag.  I mean, it was good but not that good.  After studying the check a bit more we came across a random charge for .75.  We asked about it and the waiter told us it was for whipped cream being added to the hot chocolate i had ordered.  !?!?!  Talk about adding insult to injury.  At a place that clearly makes a killing every weekend and probably during the weekdays, too, charging extra for adding whipped cream to hot chocolate is just petty.  Needless to say, we will not be back.", "author": "Jana R."}

The smoked salmon sandwich was exactly as expected, and while no surprise, it was exactly what the fish eater of us wanted.\r\n\r\nThe dessert menu has so many amazing looking items that it would be hard to choose.

The fish soup is so buttery and fresh. The salmon is always cooked perfectly and the macaroni and cheese is a must on top of your entree, but it's sometimes sold out.\nAnd then to end this delicious meal, I usually have the fruit crumble with a side of gelato.

However, no complaints about the flavor from me. Poached eggs were disappointing as they were way overcooked, but by that point we were hungry. I like that they put whole garlic cloves into their home fries, but we both thought they needed flavor, and had to add quite a bit of salt.

You can eat out for the amazing food, but this is not the place for that, or you can eat out for a nice dining experience, and this is not the place for that either.\nFood tastes great, but it's overpriced for the portion size and the service is rude.\nDetails: Friday morning, slow, we sit and pick our food quickly. The server is delighted we don't need more time to decide and we order coffee, that comes with refills, and breakfast. While we wait for our breakfast, the coffee doesn't come. We watch the server go up and down the aisle re-filling cups without giving us ours. After 10 minutes of this, we ask her to get our coffee and we get a blow off, \"i'm sure it's coming soon.\" What? It's coffee, you're holding a coffee pot, go get two cups and fill them.\nThen, a lone man enters and says, \"Im waiting for a friend, may I sit down?\" and the host says, \"Well, you can sit unless other people come in with complete parties and then you'll have to move.\" The man graciously stays despite the incredible rudeness. They put him at a table for two. What if he had just come in alone, do they have a table for one they could have put him at instead. I can understand if one person comes in for a table for 4, but no additional space is lost to one more person AND the place was half empty. The host chose a table for him, and then, moved him to a different table, later, even while the original table stayed empty. The coup de grace however was when his friend came in, he turned out to be a friend of the restaurant staff and suddenly the man's service improved.\nThen, there was the woman who made a 9:30pm reservation by mistake and got a completely snarky response to the host about it.\nAfter we got our coffee cups, we had to demand refills, while watching other tables get their coffee refilled.  Turns out our particular waitress is bad at refilling coffee, but she was delighted to slap down our check interrupting our request for a refill. At the end of the day we paid $3.00 for two tiny lukewarm cups of coffee, and lousy, lousy service.\nOh wait, and adding a slice of tomato to a sandwich costs $2.00.", "author": "Sarah S."}

So we ventured out one Sunday morning and braved the crowds.  Our party of 8 was seated by a friendly staff after a quick 45 minute wait.  Being famished and the ambitious eaters that we were, we ordered enough food for probably twice as many people.  Since I wasn't sure when I would be back I decided to go all out and order the Pierre Noir, the Croque Madame and I split a French toast tahiti.  Like I said, we were ambitious eaters.\n\nWhen the food arrived, the portions were ample for all the dishes, but I was definitely up to the task.  First I attacked the poached egg dish.  I was actually quite disappointed because when I stuck my fork through the egg, I didn't get the little oozing river of golden yolky goodness that one would expect with a poached egg.  I was disheartened and wondered what type of establishment they ran here.  Fortunately  there was also bacon on my plate which helped to placate me somewhat.  The croque madame's egg was cooked perfectly overeasy which paired perfectly with the crunchy and cheesy  sandwich.  This helped to redeem Zazie further.  Then I bit into the pancakes which were tender and fluffy and quite tasty.  The service was quick and friendly and the prices mostly reasonable for the quality.  This place would be a solid 4 if it weren't for my overcooked poached eggs, but even still a rounded up 3.5 isn't bad.  I'd definitely come back again.", "author": "Gary L."}

But luckily for me, I did. =P  I took advantage of my day off by starting it off with a nice walk through inner sunset to Cole Valley for brunch at Zazie!  Again, luckily for me I did not encounter the massive mob outside waiting for a seat at Zazie.  I walked in and was seated within 1 minute.  We had the option of going to the outside patio or the inside, but it was a little chilly outside, so we opted for the inside seating.  The inside of the restaurant isn't anything remarkable, but it feels very homey. \n\nThey have a good selection of breakfast/brunch foods with the option of one/two/three pieces of what you order (French toast, eggs, pancakes, etc).  I went with the French Toast Tahiti, which were french toast with caramelized bananas and walnuts.  It doesn't come with any sides, but you don't really need any... 2 french toast is defintiely enough for one person!  It's different from any other french toast in that it comes with \"stuffing\" --pureed bananas and walnuts in between the french toast pieces.  Might seem and look a little weird, but it's actually VERY delicious!  It has lots of banana flavor.  You actually don't even need a lot of extra syrup because the french toast and banana stuffing are already sweet as is.  I was actually pretty good with just 1 piece of french toast... if I were to have eaten 2 pieces of french toast, I might've had too much banana overload.  I also split the Omelette de Jour - chicken apple sausage, white cheddar cheese, tomato provencale, and basil.  It was good but was a little bland in my opinion.  I needed some ketchup to spice it up.\n\nOverall, the food was good, but a little on the pricey side... for 2 people: 1 glass of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice ($3.50), french toast ($10), omelette ($10.95) = $28.32... doesn't add up right? well, of course being in SF, they added on a $2 charge for the SF Health Care plan... Total was $32 for BRUNCH.  It was good, but I probably won't be going back every weekend until I make real money... $32 is a little much for brunch.", "author": "Diane L."}

So you can enjoy a mimosa or bloody while waiting.  All good. :)  We actually didn't even need to wait that long.  THey've got a few tables in front, inside, and out back.  We sat out back under a heater and I was plenty warm (which is saying a lot!) The service was fast, super friendly, and efficient.  The tables are close together but it didn't both me. THe menu is creative and fun with lots of different options.  We shared the lemon ricotta pancakes.  Wow.  They had this great lemon coulis on top, along with a little raspberry coulis too.  They were sweet but not overly which was perfect.  I had a couple eggs over easy with this soft, chewy, crusty thick white italian bread.  The potatoes were big and came with sauteed garlic cloves.  SO good.  What I like about this place is that the menu feels a little diner like - they have lots of basics, but they really spicy them up and give them some extra love, so that even the basics are special.

But, do I have an uncontrollable need to gush & wax lovingly, over-the-toppingly about this place?\n\nMost definitely.  \n\nSince so many reviewers have rightly touted the truly fabulous breakfasts here (this is my favorite purveyor of Eggs Benedict), I'll focus on the delectable dinners.  First of all, love the Prix fixe.  You get: starter, entree, & dessert.  I recently had the mussels (exquisite), salmon cooked in parchment paper (heavenly, perfectly cooked), & I ALWAYS order the pot de creme (insanely good little bucket o' orgasm - in my mouth, and also in my . . . well, I'll spare you).  Conveniently, the prix fixe is available any night (including weekends), and is quite affordable at $23.50.  The rest of the menu has a rather varied selection, which is helpful when dining with someone who only eats, say, chicken, or pork, or whatever.  The coq-au-vin is good stuff, & I can't remember others at the moment.  (The difficult combo of being a seriously food-lover as well as & a penny-counter nearly always steers me toward the prix-fixe.)  As a unique feature, Zazie also offers theme nights.  I think Monday is bring-your-dog night (& sit outside on the patio), Tuesday night is bring-your-wine night, for no corkage fee.  Not sure about any others.\n\nAnd, since I have somewhat of a faerie light fetish, this review would not be complete if I didn't ooo & aaah about the pleasant, well-heated patio decorated w/ white faerie lights.

Here's why: \n\n+ Familiarity is my friend and somehow every time I eat here, the same guy is expertly whizzing through the seriously long wait list and seating people left and right. He's just the right combo of helpful and sternly strict when he needs to be. Like when people ask him how much longer it's going to be before they sit. Tell me, aside from assuming he's polling his seated customer's every ten minutes, how the hell is he supposed to know? I hate when people ask this. Seriously, people, your self entitlement is showing. \n+ Love me a good bistro. Show me some exposed brick, a smattering of mismatched yet quaint decor, and serve me food like a heaping plate of french toast with caramelized bananas, a choice of one, two, or three of a whole list of various kinds of poached eggs and I'm sold. \n+ Again, an outdoor patio with lots of plants and flowers can get me in to see you without even having to serve good food. Zazie does both. \n+ M-I-M-O-S-A-S. Champers + several types of fresh fruit juice = WIN\n+ Zazie for dinner. Great roasted veggie plate, tasty salads, and a serioulsy great burger. I'd stay away from the pasta though. \n+ Bring Your Doggy to Dinner Night (Monday's). It warms my heart when I can bring my pooch to supper with me AND enjoy wine specials because of it. \n\nThe only complaints I have: \n- My poached eggs are always cold. Maybe it's because they think placing my freshly poached thus hot egg on top of the cheese and whatever else might go under it will keep the bottom toasty but it never, ever works. I do have to add here that the only time I complained, they gave me the entire entree, plus my dining partner's, free. Above and beyond. \n- The darn home fries. They're just not good but I do admit that I'm not a huge fan of them in general. How hard is it to cook a quartered red potato so it's soft all the way through but crisp and pan charred on the outside? Oh, is it that hard?

The space is decorated with posters of the French movie character, Zazie. There are a few tables next to the front window which have excellent views. There is also a heated outdoor patio. I've been here for dinner and weekend brunch. \n1.) Dinner\nDinner was definitely less hectic than brunch. We came on a Sunday evening, early, around 5 and were able to get a table immediately. The service was incredibly slow. We had been there nearly an hour before the waiter delivered a basket of hot rolls, fresh from the oven. We then shared a french onion soup that was made with beef broth, bread, and gruyere cheese. The onions in the soup gave it a sweet flavor. Next came a beet salad (marinated beets with anise), avocado, with baby lettuce and a gorgonzola white balsamic vinagrette. Not as good as the beet salad at Olivia, but certainly palatable. The last course on our dinner menu was polenta cakes with marscapone, red pepper cream sauce, portabello mushrooms and spinach. A very busy dish, with competing intense flavors, but worked out in the end to please my tastbuds. So overall dinner was not bad. \n2.) Brunch\nI thought I would come back for brunch, since their french toast tahiti looked amazing (brioche with caramelized bananas and walnuts). Big mistake. The line was out the door, and once we got a table (took nearly an hour) they informed us that they were out of the brioche for the french toast. Okay, I thought, I'll get the pancakes instead. I asked for fruit on the side, to make up for the fact that I wasn't getting my banana french toast. In any event, they brought a huge stack of normal buttermilk pancakes (which I'll have to say were decent, but nothing special), but no fruit. Just syrup and jam. Way too starchy. And the waiter was gone (and made himself scarce) before I had a chance to complain. So I was not impressed with the brunch at Zazie, but am still waiting to try their french toast tahiti!\n3.) Brunch take 2\nWent to Zazie again for brunch today because I had a hair appointment at a nearby salon and figured if I was in the area, maybe this would be my lucky day and I would finally get to try the french toast tahiti. Having been here for a weekend brunch before, I planned ahead. My friend who lives in Cole Valley agreed to put our names down on the waitlist 30 minutes before I was due to arrive. This worked out perfectly, not only did we not have to wait, but we ended up with an adorable table on the back patio. As the weather was sunny and warm, this could not have been a more perfect brunch location. And to top it off, they had the bread for the french toast today (my mistake, it is challah, not brioche). While the service was still slow, the  french toast tahiti was worth the wait. This delectable creation is composed of orange infused challah with a banana walnut paste, caramelized bananas, and topped with a caramel sauce.

They lost one star because the place is so damn good, you have to wait an hour for a table. Not their fault, but it is what it is. I personally think the food is better at Citizen Cake in the Hayes, but they do not have the awesome outdoor seating that Zazie's has. Its true, the garlic accompanying the potatoes is not skinned, so be prepared to chew and spit. A little unusual, but damn I do love me some garlic.

Vibe, service, and the food is super consistent and worth the trip, and price.  The wait can be insane on the weekends so I don't push it unless I have something really good to read or can walk around the lovely Cole Valley.\n\nNow the food.  I am partial to the Eggs Florentine basically a version of Benedict with spinach and mushrooms.  Their home fries when well-done and crispy rock and have whole cloves of garlic.  The straight up breakfast which is about $7-$8 bucks is strong, as are Challah French Toast, and the 1, 2, 3 (in French that is) which gives you a taste of pancake, meat and eggs without the toast or home fries.  They also will sub a salad for potatoes without charge.  Good choice of morning drinks including Bloodies and Mimosas.  The chicken sausage is sublime.  The Gingerbread Pancake should vy for greatest breakfast item in SF.  Strong words, I know, in an amazing food town.  I will stake my rep on Zazie.", "author": "Lo F."}

We had 2 pancakes, the gingerbread one with lemon curd, pear, butter, syrup, and one of the specials of the day, cornmeal pancake with lemon curd, butter, syrup. Both were good, 2 out of 3 preferred the cornmeal, myself included, but both are recommended. The lemon curd is tasty. I had the poached eggs florentine, with a light lemon hollandaise sauce on an english muffin with salad on the side. Hollandaise is good, not too rich, not too lemony--try it.

In addition, potatoes were undercooked and bland.  My friend ordered the gingerbread pancakes (4 stars) which were quite good but we thought it needed more of the pears and lemon curd.  Also, I'd advise against ordering 3.  They're pretty big and no matter how good the pancakes may be, I think it gets a little boring after a while.  Last, my other friend had the french toast tahiti (3.5 stars).  While it may taste pretty good, it doesn't hide the fact that mashed up bananas is pretty nauseating to look at.

YOU HAVE TO SPLIT UP!\" \"Ok,\" I say. \"YOU MIGHT NOT SIT TOGETHER!\" \"Ok, that's fine,\" I say. \"MAYBE NOT AT THE SAME TIME!!\" \"Yes, ok, I understand, that's fine.\" I was really surprised at his aggression, considering I offered zero resistance, and in fact, totally expected this outcome.\n\nWe waited for a while, which one always does at Zazie. I never asked how long it would be, or anything. We just stood quietly on the sidewalk with everyone else. After a time, he took the first group of four inside to a table. We sat, ordered drinks, etc. Almost immediately, a table of five across the room leaves, and the bussers set the table again for a group of five. We think, \"Oh good, they won't have to wait long, and we'll all finish about the same time.\"\n\nBut! The host seats a different group of five at the table. \nWe are confused.\nSome time later (ten minutes?), the rest of our group is seated outside.\n\nWhen a member of our group (politely!) asked about it, the host rudely replied that he did that on purpose to TEACH US A LESSON!! He went on to say, how dare we come to his restaurant with nine people!  At which point we all almost got up and left, but I wanted my gingerbread pancakes one last time. When we asked to speak to the manager, we were informed by our (nice, sympathetic) waitress that HE was the manager! Great.\n\nThis would be different if even *once* we had offered resistance, or complained. As it went down, however, I see no difference between a group of 4 people signing the list immediately before a group of 5 who know each other, or who are total strangers. It's two tables of business.\n\nBut hey, I sure learned that lesson! Now I won't bring ANY people to Zazie, and many people I've told this story have vowed not to go there either.\n\nSigh. I miss the nice lady who used to be the host. She was sweet, and once wore a hat made out of pancakes.", "author": "AG J."}

I looooved the roasted garlic cloves in the homefries that I was able to spread on my english muffin.  The gingerbread pancakes were really good too.  Fluffy and not too sweet.

I don't remember much about the meal (just because it was years ago) except that we sat on the cute back patio, and that we both wanted the cheese plate, and that we knew instantly at that moment that we'd be friends again. And we have, ever since. \n\nSo, for my birthday this year, I wanted to find a cute place to celebrate after running my very first half marathon that morning (I decided it would be a good idea to get up at 4 am on my birthday? What was I thinking?). A brunch at The Girl and the Fig in Sonoma made me think I wanted a place with a cute patio, so naturally I thought of Zazie. We ended up with a group of about ten, so there was quite a wait, but it was so worth it. Granted, I had just run 13.1 miles and may have been REALLY hungry, but this was one of my best breakfasts ever. The gingerbread pancake with roasted pear and lemon curd was outstanding, as were the Eggs Florentine. I adore poached eggs, and they have so many options. I also got bacon for the first time in 15 years. Boy was I missing out.  Yes, I ate all that, and then the cupcakes my friends brought me for my birthday, too (and a pint of ice cream later that night - because when would I ever have it be my birthday and have just run a half marathon on the same day again? No guilt there). And we split a bottle of Handley pink champagne, yum. The corkage fee was not bad, if I remember correctly.\n\nI'm not normally a pancake person at all (like them, but I'm just much more likely to order eggs), but the gingerbread ones were so good on my birthday that I had to order them again when I went back there for breakfast today (out to breakfast before work! how novel!) with Jen. Even without a thousand-calorie deficit hunger, they were fantastic. Our waiter was great - super friendly and funny and there was no wait at all. I definitely recommend going during the week.

We were fortunate not to have to wait long to get e table on the patio to enjoy such a beautiful day. Service was SLOW - but the menu kept us busy while we waited to be helped. Our server was extremely friendly and charismatic too. I think she was also the only person working out there. But we did have to wait a really long time to get attention and then greeted and then water and then take the order and then get it and then forever for the check and then forever for her to process it. Again, pretty sure she was out there on her own - I would have hoped someone was managing the floor and giving her more of a hand. We ordered elder flower? mimosas and I also got a latte - I was grateful to be able to get a soy latte and the elder flower didn't have as much flavor as I would have hoped, but  still decent. I ordered the burger because my BF wanted to try it and he ordered an egg dish that I was going to nibble on....His egg dish was good with salmon and  a TON of sour cream in the center. (I personally wouldn't have picked it - but that's my own taste) My burger was only ok - it was good for what it was, but so mild in flavor - I didn't eat more than 2 bites before passing it over . The potatoes were great with whole cloves of garlic mixed in! My other housemate had a mixed salad with seared tuna and Anchovy - he said is was really great. We also shared a Gingerbread pancake recommended to us by Marie K. with lemon curd and Bosc Pears. It was my favorite. The pancake was so fluffy and full of flavor, I couldn't have asked for something better. Definitely going to try this place again soon. Next time, I wont let the BF persuade my order.

I went yesterday which was a gorgeous SF day and which also meant that everyone and their brother wanted to eat outside.  Not knowing any better, when I wrote my name down the list, I checked the \"seat as early as possible\" box instead of the \"patio seating only.\"  Not that there was anything wrong with the inside dining room, it is small but it has some character.  More so, it is just gorgeous outside -- and would be a much nicer place to brunch the morning away as opposed to being inside in kind of a small-ish dining room.\nSo the food was OK -- I got the un, deux, troie (sp) with the challah french toast.  I was a little surprised that everything came out as greasy as it did.  Zazie did not strike me as being a greasy diner type place, but my scrambled eggs were runny not from being undercooked but because they were swimming in so much butter.  The bacon -- I actually didn't even end up eating it really because it was laden in grease.  The french toast slice was amazing and it was probably lathered in a lot of butter but I didn't seem to notice since it had such an incredible taste.  \nSo yes Zazie, I will be back and fully intend on giving you more stars, I just now know what to order and where to sit.", "author": "Katie P."}

Brunch, lunch dinner, everything is spectacularly fresh (except the bathroom... yes.. thats 1 single bathroom.. located across from the kitchen).   Let's start with how to get a seat.  From my past experiences, a reservation is the way to go, especailly if you have a large group.  It's usually pretty easy to get one and sit down within 5-10 minutes.  Without  a reservation, you might b waiting for a quite a while, as this is a teeny tiny restaurant with just a few tables. Also going on a weekday helps too.  Brunch:   I love their Challah french toast  2 pieces is plenty to fill u up!  so fluffy, sweet and delicious (not soggy at all).  Also their egg scrambles and egg florentine use the freshest free range eggs!  For dinner, if you get their prix fix dinner for $25 you get 3 courses of excellent fare although it's limited selection, it still comes out to be tasty and filling. I usually get the soup, salade louise malle or mussels.  The mussels are particularly good.. the sauce they cook it in is so good, I ask for extra bread to soak it all up in.  For the entree, I would recommend the polenta cakes (excellent!) or salmon if you're getting the prix fix menu.  If you're doing a la carte, I'd highly recommend the Poulet or Le Canard.. they sure know how to cook their birds usually crispy skin and succulent juicy meat. If you're looking for more meaty stuff, get the pork chop or hanger steak.  Almost anything you get here will impress you !!

Annoyingly I missed some parts and got the crunch sensation... BUT.. it was good. I just didn't like having to be distracted fo 10 minutes before eating (it's one thing if it's a bowl of shrimp... not for a salad). Anyways... moving on, for my entree I had the osso bucco stew which I was pretty excited about since I hadn't had it in awhile. But what came out was really good stew, but with only 20% edible meat because the rest was just chunks of fat. Several times I had to spit the chunks out into my napkin. (GROSS!). If it weren't for the poor selection of meat, I thikn I would've enjoyed it MUCH more. I guess I just picked the wrong things that night because everyone else really loved what they had (great prefixe menue). Especially the veggie ravioli. I decided to order dessert to see if they could redeem themselves, and picked the vanilaly creme brulee. Good... but I've had better. The creme was too thick to my liking, almost flan-ish and a bit too eggy, which took away from the vanilla. Service was great, our waitress was very nice, and on top of things. And their soju cocktails are very tasty. I think I will have to go back for brunch though since that seems to be their specialty.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: went for brunch, and it was a much more pleasant experience. I had the eggs fontainbleu scramble with a side of oven roasted heirloom tomatoes (YUMM!!!!!) and a sunshine (mango juice with champagne)... best mimosa alternative I have had. Will definitely go back to try the french toast. Looked soooo good!", "author": "Marina K."}

I always try something different when I come here and I am always happy.  Their specials are really something else - they just came out with a new breakfast special, polenta cakes with spinach and mushrooms in a tomatoe-chevre sauce with two over easy eggs in a cast iron skillet.  Oh.  My.  God.  They served it with thick, warm slices of whole wheat toast that were perfect for sopping up the sauce and egg yolks.  Yummy.  I also adore their seafood eggs benedict with Dungeness crab - minus the avacado for me due to an allergy, but I can only imagine how good it would be with it on top.  They also have amazing french toast (and eggnog french toast for the holidays, ohmigosh how good does that sound!?) and great pancakes...and I don't even like french toast or pancakes!  They have a great portion option as well...one, two or three with prices scaled appropriately.  Their lunch sandwiches are also fantastic.  I love their black forest ham with gruyere cheese and egg.  They also have an awesome build your own mimosa as well as a delicious juice spritzer for the non-alcoholic route.  It's not too expensive but a good sit down.  \n\nThe decor is cute, country french-y, fun and light french music piping in and small architectural details like a wrought iron circular stair and comfy wooden benches that makes you feel as though you are a million miles away from a busy city.  The storefront windows provide lots of natural light on sunny days (and it always seems to be sunnier in Cole Valley) and they have a delightful little garden in the back that is PERFECT for eating outside on warmer days.  \n\nThe major downside to this restaurant is that it is NO secret to how good it is.  It is a neighborhood gem...that the whole neighborhood knows about.  FORGET about getting in there for breakfast, brunch or lunch on a weekend...you'll wait for over an hour, and they have no foyer, so you'll be waiting on the sidewalk outside.

The one thing that puzzled my friend and i was coffee served in a soup bowl. We saw two gentlemen next to us enjoying their morning JOE in this bowl and had to ask to confirm our curiosity.

The French toast was solid - very eggy, rich and infused with vanilla. The gingerbread pancakes were a little more unique in taste. It was more on the cakey side than light and fluffy but still awesome. The lemon curd and bosc pear that it came with added another dimension. We split one pancake and it was very satisfying.

They have heaters back there so don't worry about the chill. The coffee is excellent, the poached eggs exquisite, and the wait staff friendly and attentive. Dinner is elegant and yet affordable.

MMM.  \n\nthe service was friendly and accommodating, and extra points for dealing with my unladylike drunk ass.  speaking of which, go on a tuesday and bring your own wine.  no corkage fee!\n\nedit:  came for brunch (sober).  decided that i want to die by drowning in a vat of zazie's hollandaise sauce.  death by hollandaise...too morbid?", "author": "Katherine K."}

Every time I pass by during brunch hours, however, the sidewalk is just packed with people waiting to get in, which makes me wonder what sort of crack cocaine they are lacing their brunch, but not their dinner offerings with.  Mysteriously Zazie was not packed for brunch on the day after Thanksgiving, and the liquid crack cocaine is somewhere in either the hollandaise sauce, the roasted potatoes or those deliciously caramelized pieces of roasted garlic that they serve you along with the potatoes.  I drooled a little just from typing that.", "author": "Jan C."}

I guess it's because it's one of the few brunch places around with table service.  And it wasn't bad.  There are lots of poached egg dishes on the menu which is a great start - grease-free, nicely contained, half hard eggs - very good.  I don't know why people eat Hollandaise sauce, but Zazie actually makes theirs interesting by adding a touch of lemon tang.  Ginger pancakes -  yum!  There is an option to have salad instead of potatoes which is a plus, except that the lettuce leaves come large and unmanageable.  The fruit cup looked good on other people's tables, but ours was unfortunately sad and juicy, perhaps because it was from the bottom of the barrel.

Love, love, love eating outside in the back when the weather's right for it.  Tried eating outside on the sidewalk on only one occasion, but quickly moved inside when we suddenly had about 15-20 people surrounding our table waiting to be seated.  Big mistake (unless you enjoy having every bite scrutinized . . .).\n\nNot to cheat or be lazy, but I'd have to agree with an earlier reviewer:  the chai here is really bad, which is too bad, because I like the idea of drinking chai from a bowl.  But only good chai.\n\nI'd also concur that Zazie is really only good for breakfast.  The roommate and I tried dinner there and it was completely unremarkable.  That was less than a year ago, and there is nothing from that experience which remains in my memory.  I've \"lunched\" there on my own on more than one occasion and was similarly unimpressed.\n\nOne final comment:  I've had consistently good service at Zazie but be forewarned:  they are very focused on turning the tables quite rapidly to accommodate the throngs waiting outside.

Also, tonight was chosen because it was No Corkage night. We brought along 2 bottles of wine and enjoyed that thoroughly. When we were seated, we started getting our bread rolls. They were warm, but we finished eating them and asked for some additional. We ordered appetizers, but still no bread. And for some of us, no silverware or plates. One of the appetizers we got was pate. Was not a complete pate without any of the usual sides. I had the soup of the day, mushroom soup. It needed salt. The entree I ordered was the Niman Ranch beef shank with polenta. It tastes pretty good, but was not really enough food. The other entrees on our table were pork chop (probably the best), Burger and Seafood pasta. The burger was requested to be welldone. It came back at a good medium. If any of us get mad cow, we're coming for you! All the food could have done with more salt. Finally, after asking for a third time, some additional dinner rolls showed up.

Half of us ordered off the pre fix menu.  Disappointment #1: AH ordered the spinach salad off the pre fix menu and got it served on a bread plate. DIN ordered the \"regular\" spinach salad and got it on a normal salad plate. Excuse me? What's up with that? Are we suffering from a spinach shortage??? BTW, I know my plate sizes bc I once worked at Pottery Barn. You can't fool this chickadee.  Disappointment #2: You only get one hot, little bun. There is no bread basket. Each person just gets one bun. ONE BUN. I had no idea that bread was so pricey. What's up with restaurants being cheap with the carbs??? Home makes you ask for the bread. And that's what I had to do here. After I ate my single bun, my bread plate was promptly removed. When I was working on my starter, I had to ask for THREE ADDITIONAL buns. Way to go Zazie! Make a girl feel guilty for asking for more carbs to go with your super rich butter garlic sauce. Disappointment #3: The little pot of chocolate was the size of a yo baby yogurt and is valued at $6. Puh-lease. There ain't nothing special about your cold, little pot of chocolate fat. \n \nThe mussels that I had for my starter get all three stars.  Perfectly cooked and the sauce was rich and garlicky. Don't be shy and ask for a basket of bread to soak it up.\n\nUPDATE: Got a message from Jen at Zazie. She explained that our serve should have told us the prefix menu comes with a half size starter and half size dessert with a full size entree. And due to the whole low carb craze, they've had to throw away a lot of bread, hence the single servings. Thanks Jen for clearing that up!  One more star!", "author": "Jacquee P."}

While the French Toast Tahiti was good, it wasn't amazing (definitely not $10 amazing).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-05-30", "description": "Finally got a chance to check out Zazie, supposedly one of the best places in SF to get breakfast/brunch. Not impressed.\n\nMy wife and I lucked out and only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. The greeter was professional and efficient.\n\nZazie itself is quite attractive, even if seating is cramped. Looking around, I noticed that the food presentation was excellent. Everything looked good.\n\nOur waiter was efficient and friendly enough, giving us the specials and taking the order in a reasonable amount of time. The food came out rather quickly, too.\n\nThe problems began with the food itself. I ordered the Tahitian French Toast with caramelized bananas and walnuts ($13 for 3 pieces). What the kitchen means by caramelized bananas is a banana sliced in half, sprinkled with sugar and flamed with a propane torch. The other side is mushy. The brioche the French toast was made out of was dry. So, the French toast accomplished the (not so) neat trick of simultaneously being dry and mushy. There was no custardy mouth feel, either, and the dish didn't have much flavor. Looked pretty, though. It needed all the maple syrup I poured over it ($1.25 for about a 1/4 cup of syrup, room temp). By the way, when you're charging $13 for French toast, slapping on an extra $1.25 for maple syrup is just bad form.\n\nMy wife's dish was a little better. She had the Eggs Fountainbleu scramble with spinach, wild mushrooms and Fontina cheese (10.95). The eggs weren't scrambled hard, as is often the case, and they were seasoned properly. The toast came cold, with little balls of butter on top. The breakfast potatoes were a bit of a joke, which is common enough, I suppose. They were cut in oversized chunks, underdone and tasted of little more than salt and garlic. The garlic flavor came courtesy of some cloves of garlic, roasted whole and unpeeled.\n\nThe iced tea my wife ordered was an unfortunately mix of English Breakfast and mint. She said it tasted like chemicals. I wouldn't go that far, but it wasn't very good.\n\nTo add insult to injury, our waiter dropped the check about a minute after we started eating, saying \"There's no hurry on this.\" Yeah, right. I know that Zazie has a perpetual waiting list, and they want to turn and burn, but that's just rude. The waiter could have at least waited until we were almost done to drop the check. Once we put down our credit card, our check was processed quickly, which I appreciated.\n\nI'm not quite ready to give up on Zazie. It's not like there's a ton of awesome breakfast places in San Francisco to choose from. And my wife's eggs did taste good. Maybe we'll try again the next time we get bored with the choices in our neighborhood.", "author": "Michael K."}

I was sitting in the back patio with some friends when a lady from the table behind us started to scream. Everyone on the patio turned around to find a rat on the table just sitting there. Everyone on the patio got a good look at the rat until the waitress finally got someone to remove him. At that point the rat had run into the ivy and down towards my table. A kitchen staffer grabbed the rat and carried him through the patio into the kitchen and out of the restaurant. The Zazie staff then carried on as if nothing happened and even still charged every table for their full meal and the SF healthcare fee. The owner/manager who is there every time I have dined there and clearly knows me as a regular, knew I was there and still didn't even take a moment to stop by the table and apologize.

It was closed but there was a guy there who appeared to be running the show and he came out and chatted with us, all smiles and very friendly. He told us they would be open at 5:30 and took our reservation. When we came back he remembered us, greeted us warmly, and seated us right away. We sat in the pretty little patio out back. The waitress attended to us nearly immediately, and was also very friendly and jovial. She took our order (I wanted to try everything on the menu!) and after a bit brought back fresh-baked (piping hot!) crusty rolls with butter. Yummmm... The food took a bit on the long side to get to us but I think that was intentional, as it's one of those sit and drink wine and carry on a conversation type places. My mother and I both ordered the chevre/fig raviolis with arugula (?) and crispy prociutto, and my father ordered the marscarpone polenta cakes.  Everything was *so* good. So many flavors. I'm not sure I can do them justice with words so I'll just say, go there and try it yourself! The entrees were on the small side, so I would recommend getting appetizers or a salad or something. We didn't do that, so we had plenty of room for dessert. I got the dessert dish that came with a little dish of vanilla creme brulee and a little dish of chocolate pots de creme. Mmm. The creme brulee was not quite as creamy I'd like it to be but it was still quite tasty. The pots de creme was ridiculous. So rich and thick and creamy and chocolatey and delicious. I had to get my dad to help me finish it! My mom got the challah bread pudding with white and dark chocolate and caramel. It was ludicrous. So good.\n\nThroughout the whole meal the waitress was very attentive (without being annoying) and joked with us lightheartedly. After we'd paid, the guy who took our reservation and seated us came by to chat a little, asking us how our meal was and giving us well wishes. I think he was the owner maybe? I have to say, the whole experience, which was already great because the food was so good, was made exceptional by how wonderful the staff was.

I told her that the eggs were under cooked and asked if they could re-do them. She said ok and took the plate away. Well, about 10 minutes later, I got the replacement and it was exactly like the first. The waitress said \"You have to ask for them to be cooked medium\" before she took the plate away and I was surprised that when it came back it was still undercooked. The waitress then basically said \"Well, people here like their eggs undercooked.\" Well, that's all well, but when you send plates back, it might be in their best interest to do it the way the customer wants it.. \nIn general the menu is decent, not great and the atmosphere is very nice as well.

My wife had the eggs Florentine a type of Benedict with spinach and portabello mushrooms and my friend had the eggs Fontainbleu which was a scrambled eggs with mushrooms spinach and fontina. The disappointing thing was that every one of our eggs were cold. We couldn't figure out why because we saw the plates come up and our waitress delivered them right away. They were properly poached but oddly cold.  My friends scrambled eggs were cold too.  My hollandise was very bland, tasted almost like they forgot to put lemon or salt in it.

It actually was fine but when you eat it along with the avocado that lies underneath the crab it tastes rotten. Not a good combo. It was OK separately.

Up to two hours is not impossible, so if you are like me and just have to eat when you get hungry then you certainly need to plan ahead. I have tried to have brunch here a couple of times but even though the food is good I do not think it is worth the wait actually, not sure why anyone does. There are other places in the neighborhood that actually serves better brunch if you ask me. However, it seems like it has become more of a tradition to come here than anything else and I certainly get that. But, if you want to find a good place for brunch but do not want the wait then why don't you just go to Bambinos right next doors, actually better food, or why not Reverie Caf (good food, great backyard)? If you feel more like a salad or open faced sandwich then Boulange is an option too (Boulange is actually the best caf ever).\n\nSo, even though the food is good (I do not think the food here is excellent), the service is good, their backyard is good, I actually do not ever have brunch here due to the wait.

Slow cooked oatmeal takes 30-45 minutes to cook so I was suprised when they said they'd have me a \"new\" bowl with in 5 minutes. This \"new\" bowl was no better - more of the same disgusting slop- and no one even asked if I was ok with the second attempt.  I told the manager how disappointed I was that they tried to serve me the same goop twice and he told me \"Well, oatmeal is water and oatmeal\". I tried to explain that it wasnt cooked and clearly not edible but I got nothing back. No apology, no \"can I get you something else?\", no acknowledgement that he had a very disappointed customer.

My hubby and I went today at noon and we sat right down despite the wait! The tables out front are first come first serve and no one wanted to sit there for some reason (kinda cold).  I had a great dish, which was the tomato and bacon poached eggs. It was basically an egg benedict - the best I'd ever had. My husband's dish - he ordered nicoise salad and he hated it. But this is my review on my experience, so im rating it a solid 4. The waiter was super nice and the food was delish. I love that they have a zillion special brunch drinks and a bunch of ways to have eggs benedict.  I was here a few months back for lunch and you can still order breakfast (which i LOVE at any time of the day), so I had the banana french toast and it was to die for.  Highly recommend this place, it's delish!", "author": "Veronica P."}

The prices are very reasonable and the wait staff is very friendly and accomodating. The food, however, is exceptional and I would dine here a lot if it were not for the parking situation. Luckily, it was a beautiful day in SF and everyone was driving somewhere at Brunch time. All of the eggs benedict dishes that I tasted were divine and the scrambles/omelettes that I tasted were even better. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict is very light and not heavy like other places. Oh and for dessert, do have the gingerbread pancakes with Lemon Curd on top (we had both the lemon curd and the pear, but the lemon curd complemented the pancakes better). There was five of us and we all wanted to taste it. You don't need butter and you don't need syrup (though they do come with it). The pancakes have a life of their own an melt in your mouth as is. As far as the portions, they are just right. They do not give more than what your stomach can handle and you cannot leave this place starving. The coffee is just okay, however. The best part about this place are the mimosas. Zazie has a large choice of Brunch drinks including several mimosa flavors (we all ordered one and our favorite is the one with mango juice and champagne) and Soju cocktails (which I intend to try next time).

I wanted a table for two, and my friend was five minutes away. I was asked, \"Is the rest of your party here'?\" \"No,\"I said, \"but do you have any such thing as a table for one?\" I was then told that everyone had to be present and ready to order. \"Isn't that sensible?\" the manager asked. \"No, it is not,\" I said. \"Well,\" he snapped, \"if you don't like it you can go elsewhere.\" Which I would gladly have done, except that my friend really wanted to eat there.

I had the smoked salmon sandwich, which was good, but for $9 all you get is the tiny sandwich, a side salad or home fries are another $1.50, so I ordered the salad and it's just a handful of greens. The bf's french toast didn't come with anything else either, granted its a good serving size, he could have eaten more and I guess I'm just used to such items being accompanied with others (such as at crepevine).

About ten maybe fifteen minutes passed and I started to wonder what had happened to my waiter and my drinks when I noticed he was being chatty with some customers for some period of time , so finally this waiter returns to take my order and I asked if I could have water ... (hint hint, I really feel thirsty and can you serve me please?)  He replies, \"Of course,\" takes my order and goes to another table!!!  The restaurant is tiny, it doesn't take any leg work to go to the counter and retrieve my tea, water, and my bloody mary sitting on the counter getting cold getting warm... and it was not busy.  \nI finally got up and asked to switch tables... and there on the counter were all my drinks waiting to be served to me and there was the guy chatting with the customers again!  He was not taking orders he was chatting... I was starting to think I had a moron for a waiter.\nThe guy still did not take notice of me as I got up to use their restroom and to switch tables... the restroom by the way was filthy which made my stomach turn.  \nWhen I got my food, I thought the poached egg was cold.  For some reason, the food was not delectable as I thought the food was the first couple of times I had been there... every thing was just heavy and bland and overly sweet.  The tea had a weird bitter aftertaste.  \nI believe a good part of the dining experience can be elevated or dampened by how you are being treated by the server... in my case, I felt ignored and not served well by my first waiter who basically failed to pay attention to me and bring my water, drinks as I sat there for over fifteen or more minutes feeling a little neglected, and that may have done it in for me there at Zazie's.\nI did tip my second waiter well (over twenty percent) but I have a tendency to overtip because I feel waiters USUALLY work pretty hard...", "author": "lucia P."}

My wife had the shrimp lobster ravioli in some sort of white wine and lemony sauce that was really rich and perfectly balanced with the shrimp. I, of all things, had the burger. I know, I know... It's a French restaurant  and you had a burger? Well, this wasn't just any old burger. It had a great buttery bun with melted cheese and a vinaigrette  salad mixture that was on top of the burger patty and it was quite good.

Also, if it's a really nice day out, and you are fortunate enough to get a table out back, it's a really nice experience.  The back deck is really small and it feels like you're being served brunch at someone's home.  It's a nice break away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  My only gripe is that they give you your bill right as they serve your food and say 'Don't Rush!', but really, you do feel rushed.
