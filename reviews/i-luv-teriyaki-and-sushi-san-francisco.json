The biggest source of sadness was just the teeny size of my hamachi sashimi. 4 small slices and small bed of radish was pretty much it. \n\nThe order of eel sunomomo wasn't much better. I never did find the eel, although the shrimp and cucumber were tasty. This overall was probably my favorite dish, but it likewise did not feel like $6 worth.\n\nThe one exception is the gyoza, which I wolfed down half of after the other two dishes because I was still hungry. 8 gyoza at a restaurant for $5 is a solid deal any way you slice it. \n\nAll told I paid almost $25 and was expecting a couple meals out of what felt like a fat order, but in the end I got only slightly more than one. Disappointing to be sure - I'm glad I ordered extra.", "author": "Chris S."}

The second time I ordered my food to go due to the experience just mentioned and when I asked for a chili hot sauce to go (turned out they only had Siracha hot sauce), I was sarcastically advised that normally it is 25 cents, but that this time I can get it for free.

This is one of my favorite spots, and though I've been away from SF for a few years, whenever I visit, I make sure to stop in.

On the first visit I had the Tofu Curry (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/suoD2N1T4bVUkxHMbfWlAw/l).  I liked it so much that on the second visit I ordered the Chicken Curry (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/R15yBg1k0KIKWxOLa_BGpg/l).  While the curry here doesn't come close to matching the curry at Muracci's I enjoyed the flavor very much.  My only wish is that it would be just a bit spicier.  The tofu in the Tofu Curry is of a medium firmness and is not deep-fried like the tofu curry at Muracci's.  I actually liked the tofu better not fried.  The base curry sauce is cooked with chunks of carrots and potatoes.  The two vegetables are very much melt-in-your-mouth soft.  The sauce features a slightly sweet curry taste with a very nice aroma.  \n\nUnlike the tofu the chicken in the Chicken Curry is actually chicken katsu and is deep-fried.  The menu did not state this.  It's a very thin piece of chicken rolled in panko crumbs and fried to a crispy brown.  I was not expecting the chicken to be served katsu-styled and would have definitely preferred the chicken without the panko crumbs.  Also, I prefer brown rice but I can't have that here either.  The curry dishes are served with a cold mixed salad with miso dressing, a cold bean sprouts and cabbage salad and edamame.  All of the accompaniments are good.\n\nI've ordered a basic roll on each of my visits also.  Occasionally, I order fancy, crazy rolls but I haven't done so in awhile because I'm not a crazy fan of the sweet, silly sauces often found on those \"jive-ass\" rolls.  My New York Roll (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/n8o52Nq-le1l_RrohbkzsA/l) was very fresh as was the Kanpai Roll (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/DeEaYExR59g4RKk0CeJbhA/l).  Besides the fresh ingredients I liked that both of the rolls held together well because I'm darn tired of rolls that fall apart as soon as they are touched by my chopsticks.\n\nExpect fast, friendly and courteous service.

The teriyaki wings is not on the printed menu but it's posted on the wall.  It's a little on the sweet side but overall (at least to me) enjoyable.  They give a pretty nice side salad to come along with it.\n\nI haven't tried their sushi, but I have at Nama located on King Street a short walk west of AT&T Park.  This restaurant is apparently related to that one and I do like the sashimi combo at Nama's, soemthing I go for occasionally before a Giants game during the baseball season.  Therefore, if the sashimi como here is like the one there then for me it would be a positive thing.\n\nNice staff here, especially the waitstaff ladies (and one in particular) that was here last Thursday when I came for lunch.

I often order the Salmon Teriyaki Box for $8.50, a really good deal that comes with rice, grilled broccoli florets or edamame, salad with miso dressing and clear noodles. If I've been a really good person, I may get one of their special rolls like the $8.95 Rainbow Roll. I love going through the photo flipbook of their special rolls, creative concoctions that look like dragons, caterpillars and other lower life forms. It just seems like the inevitable next step is a porno version that looks like...oh jeez, is it just glad to see me?\n\nIt's always busy but never that crowded. Not that much on atmosphere since it is part of the Potrero Shopping Center next to the Boston Market.

There was only one woman working and she was really sweet and friendly. The parties that were there before us were quite large and she handled everyone's order so efficiently and patiently.\n\nI ordered the chicken udon and Lion King. My friend had some of the udon and immediately said she could taste that it was chicken just from the first sip of broth. I enjoyed it, too. The Lion King roll was quite impressive. It was a California Roll with baked salmon on top of it with \"special\" sauce-- which happened to be mayonnaise (which I am not a big fan of). Oh well, my mistake. It was delicious none-the-less and ate both of my udon and roll. \n\nMy other friend ordered the Salmon Teriyaki bento and a Nama roll which I couldn't figure out what was in it, but she said it was delicious! \n\nThere are pictures of a lot of their rolls on the menu so you can actually visualize what you may want to eat (which quite possibly could be everything!)\n\nThe prices were actually quite reasonable as well. My udon went for $7.95 and the Lion King $8.95. I was mostly impressed by how much of a roll you get for what you pay! \n\nI just wish I Luv Teriyaki & Sushi wasn't so far! \nBut whenever I'm in the Mission, I will definitely pay it a visit!", "author": "Angela A."}

The special rolls menu is one of the most extensive I have ever seen on a menu. My friend and I walked in and was seated immediately. I was happy to see that we were not the only customers as 5 or so other parties were also patrons.\n\nFollowing the advice of other Yelpers, match the sushi photos with the menu to get a much better idea of what your rolls will look like. My friend and I took at least 10-15 minutes to decide on what to order. The server came by the table at least three times before taking the order. The good appetizers are so expensive! Agedashi tofu for $6 is more expensive than some rolls! The potato croquettes cost $4.50 and only include two, which is insanely wrong. I got the vegetable curry entree (includes rice, salad) $7.50 and the J.D. roll. My friend got the lion king roll and the caterpillar roll.\n\nThe food took a while to be served so I suggest getting an appetizer if you are hungry. The sushi arrived first. The caterpillar was a really skinny roll and my friend said that the avocado didn't taste very fresh. The lion king roll was pretty good but i have had better. My J.D. roll was absolutely amazing, highly recommend. My veggie curry arrived last and when I saw it, I was disappointed as it wasn't truly real Japanese curry. I'm very sure it is a package from the supermarket with powder mix. The veggies were only carrot bites and potatoes. I should have just got another roll instead of the curry.

And besides, it's too close to my office to ignore forever.  \n\nFirst up: I Luv Teriyaki & Sushi, tucked away on the Potrero Ave side.  So am I supposed to order teriyaki or sushi?  Well, when in doubt, don't order sushi.  Besides, strip-mall teriyaki brings back some good high-school memories.  \n\nOn a hot day, this place is baking inside, but the staff was friendly enough, and the layout of the place actually has a bit of pep.  Now, I like my teriyaki like a double ice cream cone: a big scoop of meat over an even bigger scoop of rice (with enough sauce to soak well into the rice--but that's really more of a snowcone metaphor) .  So I was disappointed when it arrived in a rather shoddily-arranged bento box, and with a less-than-generous serving of rice.  The meat itself was ok, but nothing spectacular.  Who knows, maybe sushi is their specialty after all?  One thing's for sure: I really need to figure out where the quality teriyaki is in this town.", "author": "Wes M."}

There are way too many over-priced sushi restaurants in this town.  Even their sister restaurant (NAMA http://www.yelp.com/biz/nama-sushi-san-francisco#hrid:-z3WIKYLVFW7sPlUOb9CkA/query:nama) is more expensive (albeit, it is in a prime location near SBC/AT&T-whatever-the-hell-the-sponsor-is park).  \n\nAnother positive is that it's located in the Potrero Center which boasts a plethora of parking.  So even if it's not your hood, it's easily accessible by MUNI or car.  Not only that, you can tag grocery shopping onto your sushi fix as there's a Safeway next door (okay, maybe this is stretching it as a positive, but it works for me).\n\nOh, and the food - very good.  Nothing over the top spectacular, but fish is fresh, seaweed salad is excellent (always a determining factor for me) and the service is fast.  My only negative is that they serve their edamame cold.  I prefer it warm (with lots of salt) so I don't usually order that when I visit.\n\nNot much atmosphere, but when you consider the speed and the price, it's worth it.  Definitely somewhere you should check out if you're looking for a quick, inexpensive sushi/Japanese restaurant.

I was actually in a good mood after yelling at the guy behind the counter at Comcast, but I didn't have a lot of time left to eat so I figured I'd give this place a try. \n\nI agree with some earlier reviewers that the ambiance of the place is much like what you'd find at a shopping mall food court but at 1:30pm it was packed with the local lunch crowd so I figured it was probably safe to eat there.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Teriyaki & Tempura special - $9.90 and I also decided to try the sparking sake (Ozeki hana-awaka) just because I read a post on Yelp just a few days back going off about how good it was.\n\nService was good, if just a little slow but again it was pretty packed. I don't fault them for it. The meal itself was plentiful and very tasty. I usually don't have a problem finishing of a lunch but in this case I couldn't finish all the sides, cold noodles, Edamame, and even some of the rice. (where was my miso soup?)\n\nThe sake was sweet as I expected it would be but I can't say I'm a big fan of the carbonated sake drinks. I should've just ordered green tea (ordered?). \n\nSo I finish quickly and jump on my motorcycle to get back downtown and when I'm almost there my stomach starts to really ache. I actually had flashes of me puking in my helmet. I'm not sure what that was about but it didn't last long so I doubt it was any problem with the food. Maybe I just ate to fast or got a weird reaction to the sweet alcoholic drink. \n\nAnyway I would probably eat here again although I'm not usually in that neighborhood but I'm definitely staying away from sweet sake. *pugh*.  Now mixed Soju drinks are a different story but that's for another review.\n\nupdate - 09/20/07\nOn my way home today I stopped by Super Tokiko and found the same sparking sake I had at this place (Ozeki hana-awaka). I'm sipping it now as I write this note and I do like the taste. I doubt it was the sake that made my stomach turn after lunch that day. Another plus is at ST the same bottle was only $4.50, Bargain!", "author": "Johnny H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-09-03", "description": "Here are three very easy general rules to figure out whether you're going to a mediocre Japanese restaurant catering to white people.\n\n1) Does the ricer dinner-set include miso soup?\n\n2) If so, does the miso soup come with your main entre, as opposed to the beginning?\n\n3) Are Bento boxes available only during lunch, and not dinner?\n\nIf all three of these answers aren't \"yes\", then chances are you don't need to bother. This restaurant falls under the \"keep away\" category. FYI, bento box is Japanese for lunch box. Yes, you think the nifty partitioned plastic tray looks exotic, but it's a ridiculous gimmick that only Japanese-food noobs fall for. Who wants a lunch box for dinner? I had neither the teriyaki nor the sushi, but I don't need either to figure out this place isn't worth it. Reasons:\n\n1) Gyoza. Japanese people almost never deep fry it--they pan fry the bottom and let water boil the top. Fail. Tastes like frozen microwavable pork pot stickers you can buy at any market.\n\n2) Tempura. I didn't eat it, but just looking at it I could tell it wasn't right. It's supposed to be very light in taste and texture, this was much darker.\n\n3) Sesame seed fried chicken. I ordered this, and it was actually pretty decent. But I've never even heard of such a dish (was expecting karaage but got this instead).\n\n4) Sushi. Don't bother with sushi restaurants that have a giant selection of non-sushi entres. If it's a good sushi restaurant, then they'd be spending all their time/money getting quality neta (fish), and skilled itamae-sans to make them. (this rule also generally applies to ramen)\n\nThe only redeeming quality is that the price isn't too bad, and the food was ok.

From the dodgey location and hokey signage you would think this place is to be avoided if you didn't want to get food poisoning. However, my Asian co-workers, who have frequented this place for a long time before I cam e along, are not wrong about this place. I don't know much about the owners but I get the feeling that this place is family run and there seems to be a lot of dedication about their business and warmth from all of those who work here. The mood is jovial and quick during the lunch rush. Food wise, I only order rolls of which this place has many variations including some rather creative or  \"experimental\" ones that have names like \"Chris's Roll\" or \"Jake's Roll\". I assume that these are rolls named after employees who created them but who knows. All I know is that for a non-sashimi sushi eater, this place is perfect. Also, the rolls are big and come in many pieces. Two rolls with a small salad is MORE than enough for lunch, in fact I couldn't even finish mine. The box lunches that my co-workers order also look very good and plentiful.\n\nThis place is surprisingly great, at least for lunch, and would eat here even if I didn't work around the block.", "author": "Alotta F."}

I've never had a better rainbow roll, even though I've paid more for others.   Also recommended are their warm  \"Love roll\", which is a sushi topped with fresh scallops and a seafood newberg sauce, their \"Craig's roll\", which is wrapped around tempura and topped with three colors (black, green and orange) of caviar, and their croquettes, which are crisp and light.  \n\nWe've been going there regularly for the past few months.

It is truly amazing for the price. The sushi is fresh, tender and simply delicious. One of the great achievements of this restaurant is their ability to offer such unique dishes (you'll see once you've scoured the menu for yourself). \n\nThe restaurant itself is nothing special and the service is not that great (at least in my own experience. It seems the table next to us was getting great service). We ordered a lot of food for four people, but they forgot to bring us two of our bento boxes. It wasn't a big deal though, as they apolgized and gave us a free plate of chicken teriyaki which was EXCELLENT :)\n\nAll in all, as I said in the beginning, the quality of food and the price is what you're coming here for.

My personal experience was not so great. When it comes to restaurants, I'm huge on cleanliness. This place just didn't give me a clean feel. Maybe it was because it was fairly empty on a Saturday night or gross bathrooms which require you to use a dirty looking key to get in. Honestly, I felt that touching the key defeated the purpose of washing my hands before I eat. Or maybe it was the shady looking couple that smelled of weed sitting near us. Or maybe even the random bit of rice, origin unknown (none of the tables near us were eating yet), that fell on my sweater right when I sat down. Setting aside, the American-style sushi was only okay, nothing to write home about and they used a good amount of rice and less fish. In terms of price, it was very slightly less than normal though not slight enough to balance out the yucky feel the place gave me. On a positive note, the waitress was very friendly and sweet, and the picture album of the rolls is a nice touch. Still, I'd rather go to Sushi Zen any day!

Honestly, it's not my absolute favorite sushi bar in town but it's the one that I'll frequent the most.  The reason:  The price is excellent for the wonderful quality of food and friendly staff.  They are a perfect spot for dinner or lunch, and even perfect for an hour lunch break at work.  I started going here because you can get a killer Bento Box with teriyaki chicken, edamame, salad, clear noodles, veggies, and rice for cheap that fills you up.  Oh yeah, in about 3 minutes as well.  Then I slowly started expanding to get sushi and maki.  Boy was I impressed.  They always have awesome sushi chefs that I love to sit at the bar and chat with while watching the masters at work.  My favorite roll is the Spicy Crab Crunch roll, or the \"Chris Roll\" which is the above mentioned with Salmon and Avocado on it as well.  The salmon is EXCELLENT, rich and buttery and a staple for nigiri when going here.  I also love their spicy tuna roll, ryan roll, april roll, and the dream gina roll just to name a few.  There are honestly not too many rolls I haven't tried here as I try to go at least once a week.  Once they got three beers on draft, it's hard to pull me away from the counter.
